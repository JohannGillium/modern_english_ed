                    EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION.</head>


<p>I WAS invited to pass a month last summer
in Buckinghamshire by a friend, who paid annually
a visit to his mother, a lady pretty far advanced
in years, but extremely chearful, sensible,
and well-bred.
</p>
<p>She lived altogether in the country, in a good
old-fashioned house, which was part of her jointure;
and it was to this hospitable mansion he
carried me.
</p>
<p>The lady received me very politely, as her son's
friend; and I have great reason to be obliged to
him for the introduction.
</p>
<p>My friend and I generally dedicated our

<pb n="4"/>
evenings to the entertainment of this obliging
lady.  She loved reading, and was a woman of
an excellent taste; but as her years rendered
that employment not so easy to her as it had
been, her son and myself usually spared her the
task, and read to her such authors as she chose
for her entertainment; nor was she so confined
to particular studies, as not to allow us to vary
our subjects as inclination led us.
</p>
<p>It happened one evening, which was on the
eve of the day appointed for our departure, that
we had made choice of the tragedy of Douglas
for our entertainment, when a neighbouring
lady (a sensible woman) who had drank tea with
us, desired to make one of our auditors.
</p>
<p>After the tea-table was removed, we entered
on our task; my friend and I reading alternately,
to relieve each other, that we might not injure
the performance by a wearied or flat delivery.
</p>
<p>When we had finish'd the reading of it, they
each in her turn bestowed high praises on it;
but the visitor lady said, that notwithstanding
the pleasure it had afforded her upon the whole,
she had one great objection to it.  We were all
impatient to know what it was.  I think, said
she, that the moral, which it inculcates is a discouraging
lesson, especially to youth; for the

<pb n="5"/>
blooming hero of this story, though adorned
with the highest virtues of humanity, truth,
modesty, gratitude, filial piety, nobleness of mind,
and valour in the most eminent degree, is not
only buried in obscurity, by a severe destiny, till
he arrives at manhood, but when he emerges
into light, is suddenly cut off by an untimely
death, and that at a juncture too, when we might
(morally speaking) say his virtues <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have
been rewarded.
</p>
<p>We each spoke our thoughts on the subject,
as opinion led us, when the old lady drew our
attention, which she always did, whenever she
delivered her sentiments.
</p>
<p>I should think as you do, madam, said she, if
there were not too many melancholy precedents
to give a sanction to the fable of that tragedy.
I do not say but that the poet, who is a liberty
to dispose as he pleases of the works of his own
creation, may as well reward and punish according
to the measures of justice established in the
world; it might, perhaps make a better impression,
and indeed afford a more prevalent example,
to the generality of young people.  I say,
therefore, I do not take upon me to support an
opposite conduct as the best, but surely the poet
who prefers that course, may be justified in it
from every day's experience.  If we always saw

<pb n="6"/>
virtuous people successful in their pursuits, and
their days crowned with prosperity, there would
be more force in your objection; but the direct
contrary is a truth, which every body who has
lived but a moderate number of years, must have
been convinced of from their own observation.
Amongst heathens indeed, who looked no farther
than <hi rend="italic">this</hi> life for good and evil, and whose
only incitement to virtue was the praise of men,
or what <hi rend="italic">they</hi> called glory, such morals might be
dangerous; but surely amongst us Christians they
<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi>, at least <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> not to have any ill effect.
</p>
<p>On the contrary, I think it should serve to
confirm that great lesson which we are all taught
indeed, but which we seldom think of reducing
to practice, viz. to use the good things of this
life with that indifference, which things that are
neither permanent in their own nature, nor of
any estimation in the sight of God, deserve.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, to consider the evils which
befal us, as equally temporary, and no more
dispensed by the great ruler of all things for punishments,
than the others are for rewards; and
by thus estimating both, to look forward for an
equal distribution of justice, to that place only,
where (let our station be what it will) our lot is
to be unchangeable.  It is in this light that I
was instructed in my early days to consider the

<pb n="7"/>
various portions that fall to the share of mankind;
which very often, as far as we can see,
appear extremely partial; and no doubt would
really be so, were there not an invisible world
where the distributions are just and equal.  From
this reflection I have drawn comfort in many
trying incidents of my life; but in none more
than the unhappy fate of a lady, who was my
particular friend; and who, tho' a woman of
most exemplary virtue, was, through the course
of her whole life, persecuted by a variety of
strange misfortunes.  This lady, to use your
expression, madam (addressing her friend) to all
human appearance, <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> at last to have been rewarded
even here&mdash;but her portion was affliction.
What then are we to conclude, but that God
does not estimate things as we do?"  It is ignorant,
as well as sinful to arraign his providence.
We daily see its dispensations with our own
eyes, in the various accidents of life.  Why
should we not then allow the poet to copy from
life, and exhibit to our view events, the probability
of which are founded on general experience?
</p>
<p>We are indeed so much used to what they call
poetical justice, that we are disappointed in the
catastrophe of a fable, if everybody concerned in
it be not disposed of according to the sentence of
that judge which we have set up in our own
breasts.

<pb n="8"/>
</p>
<p>The contrary we know happens in real life;
let us not then condemn what is drawn from real
life.&mdash;We may wish to see nature copied from
her more pleasing works; but a martyr expiring
in tortures is as just, though not as agreeable, a
representation of her, as a hero rewarded with
the brightest honours.
</p>
<p>We agreed with the venerable lady in her observations;
and her son taking occasion from
her mentioning that unfortunate person, who
was her friend, told her, he would take it as a
particular favour, if she would oblige me with
the sight of that lady's story.
</p>
<p>She answered, that as we had fixed upon the
next day for our departure, there would not be
time for me to peruse it, but that she would entrust
me with it to town, that I might read it at
my leisure.  It is drawn up, said she, for the
most part, by the lady herself, and the occasion
of its being so was this: She and I had been intimate
from our childhood; we were playfellows
when young, and constant companions as we
grew up.  We always called each other sister,
and loved as well as if we had really stood in that
relation to each other.  It was our continual
practice from children to keep little journals of
what daily happened to us; these, in all our
short absences, were matter of great entertainment

<pb n="9"/>
to us; we constantly communicate them
when we met, or if we chanced to be separated by
any distance, we made a mutual exchange by the
post of our little diurnal registers, having made
each a solemn promise, not to conceal an incident,
or even a thought of the least moment,
from the other; and this promise I believe was
religiously kept up during a correspondence of
many years.
</p>
<p>I had a brother about three years older than
myself; a very promising young man.  He was
an only son, and the darling of his parents: when
he had finished his studies, my father thought
of sending him abroad, but his fondness
for him made him resolve to accompany him
himself.
</p>
<p>A better tutor or a better guide he could not
have found for him; my father was then in the
prime of life, he had not other children but him
and me.  My mother, as fond of me as he was
of his son, and perfectly affectionate to my father,
expressed her wish, that we two should be of this
party.  She said, the thought a young lady under
proper conduct, might improve as much
by seeing foreign courts, and the various customs
of different nations, as a young gentleman.
</p>
<p>I was then about sixteen; my father readily

<pb n="10"/>
consented, as he perfectly loved my mother; and
we all four set out on our tour together.  It was
my lot, after I had been some time abroad, to
marry an English gentleman, then resident at
Vienna; this occasioned my continuing there
some years, and it was during that space of time
that I had the occurrences of my friend's life
from her own hand.  As she had kept up to the
method we had agreed on of communicating
everything that happened, even to trivial matters,
it generally encreased the bulk of the packets I
used to receive from her to a prodigious size:
these she sent off occasionally, at nearer or more
distant periods of time, accordingly as I gave
her the opportunity, by letting her know our
motions.
</p>
<p>I have from those papers selected the most material
parts of her history, and connected them
so as to make one continued narrative.
</p>
<p>There were long intervals of time between
many of the most important incidents of her life;
but as the passages which intervened were either
foreign to the main scope of her story, or too
trivial to be recorded, in copying her papers
they were omitted.
</p>
<p>I have, myself, prefixed to her story, a very
brief account of the lady's family.
</p>
<p>Thus much, Sir, added the good lady, I thought

<pb n="11"/>
necessary to premise to you, for your better understanding
her history, which I have never yet
shewn to any one but my son.
</p>
<p>When I took my leave, she put the manuscript
into my hands, with a charge to be careful of
it.
</p>
<p>We returned to town, and in less three weeks
I had the mortification to hear that this respectable
old lady, by whom I had been entertained
with so much friendship and politeness, was
dead.  Her son (my friend) was on this occasion
obliged to go down into Buckinghamshire; it
was some months before I saw him again, as he
had a good deal of family business to settle.
</p>
<p>When he came back to London, I offered to return
him the manuscript, which he had quite
forgot.  He told me, as he had all the original
papers, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> copy was at my service.
</p>
<p>I then expressed my wish that it were made
public.  To this he at first objected, as he said
there were several persons living related to the
parties concerned in some of the principal events
of the story, who might take umbrage at it.  I
told him, that this might easily be obviated, by
changing the names both of persons and places,
which I would undertake  to do throughout the
whole; and I was afterwards so urgent with him
to comply with my request, that he at last yielded.

<pb n="12"/>
with his consent therefore I give it to the
world, just as I received it, without any alteration,
excepting the proposed one of a change of
names.</p>

<head>MEMOIRS<lb/> OF<lb/><lb/> MISS SIDNEY BIDULPH. </head>

<div2 type="note" id="d8">
<head>Editor's note</head>

<p>MRS. Catharine Sidney Bidulph was
the daughter of Sir Robert Bidulph of
Wiltshire.  Her father died when she was
very young; and of ten children none survived
him but this lady, and his eldest son,
afterwards Sir George Bidulph.  The family
estate was not very considerable, and
Miss Bidulph's portion was but four thousand
pounds, a fortune however at that
time not quite contemptible; it was in the
beginning of queen Anne's reign.
</p>
<p>Lady Bidulph was a woman of plain
sense, but exemplary piety; the strictness

<pb n="14"/>
of her notions (highly commendable in
themselves) now-and-then gave a tincture
of severity to her actions, though she was
every esteemed a truly good woman.
</p>
<p>She had educated her daughter, who
was one of the greatest beauties of her
time, in the strictest principles of virtue;
from which she never deviated, through
the course of an innocent, though unhappy
life.
</p>
<p>Sir George Bidulph was nine or ten
years older than his sister.  He was a
man of good understanding, moral as
to his general conduct, but void of any
of those refined sentiments, which constitute
what is called <hi rend="italic">delicacy</hi>.  Pride is
sometimes accounted laudable; that which
Sir George possessed (for he had pride)
was not of this kind.
</p>
<p>He was a weakly constitution, and
had been ordered by the physicians to
Spa for the recovery of a lingering disorder,
which he had laboured under for
some time.  It was just on his return to
England that the busy scene of his sister's
life opened.  An intimate friend of hers,

<pb n="15"/>
of her own sex, to whom she revealed all
the secrets of her heart, happened at this
juncture to go abroad, and it was for her
perusal only the following journal was
intended.  That friend has carefully preserved
it, as she thinks it may serve for
an example, to prove that neither prudence,
foresight, nor even the best disposition
that the human heart is capable of,
are of themselves sufficient to defend us
against the inevitable ills that sometimes
are allotted, even to the best.  'The race
is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong.'</p></div2>

<p>MY dear and ever-beloved Cecilia
is now on her way to Harwich.
How insipid will this task of recording
all the little incidents of the day now
appear to me, when you, my sister,
friend of my heart, are no longer near
me?  How many tedious months will
it be before I again embrace you?  How
many days of impatience must I suffer

<pb n="16"/>
before I can even hear from you, or communicate
to you the actions, the words,
the thoughts of your Sidney? &mdash; But
let me not grow plantive, the stile my
friend hates. &mdash; I should be ungrateful (if
I indulged it) to the best of mothers, who,
to gratify and amuse me on this first occasion
of sorrow which I ever experienced,
has been induced to quit her beloved retirement,
and come on purpose to London,
to rouse up my spirits, and, as she
expresses herself, to keep me from the sin
of murmuring.
</p>
<p>Avaunt then complainings!  Let me
rest assured that my Cecilia is happy in
her pursuits, and let me resolve on making
myself so in mine.
</p>
</div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d11">
	<head><date value="1703-04-03"><hi rend="italic">April 3</hi>.</date> </head>
<p>We have had a letter from
my brother George; he is landed, and
we expect him hourly in town.  As our
house is large enough, I hope he will consent
to take up his abode with us while
we stay in London.  My mother intends
to request it of him: she says it will be
for the <hi rend="italic">reputation</hi> of a gay young man to

<pb n="17"/>
live in a <hi rend="italic">sober</hi> family.  I know not how
Sir George may relish the proposal, as our
hours are not likely to correspond with
those, which I suppose he has been used to
since he has been absent from us.  But
perhaps he may not refuse the compliment;
Sir George is not averse to oeconomy.
 &mdash; How kind, how indulgent,
is this worthy parent of mine!  She will
not suffer me to stay at home with her,
nay scarce allows me time for my journal.
'Sidney, I won't have you stay
within; I won't have you write; I
won't have you think&mdash;I will make a
rake of you; you shall go to the play
to-night, and I am almost tempted to
go with you myself, though I have
not been at one since your father's
death.' &mdash; These were her kind expressions
to me just now.&mdash;I am indeed indebted
to her tenderness, when she relaxes so
much of her usual strictness, as ever
to <hi rend="italic">think</hi> of such a thing.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d12">
	<head><date value="1703-04-05"><hi rend="italic">April 5.</hi>&mdash;</date> </head>
<p>My brother returned to
us this day, thank God! in perfect

<pb n="18"/>
health.  Never was there such an alteration
seen in a man; he is grown fat, and
looks quite robust.  He dropped in upon
us just as we sat down to dinner: what a
clutter has his arrival made!  My mother
was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> rejoiced, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> thankful, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi>
full of praises, and asked <hi rend="italic">so</hi> many questions,
that George could hardly find
words enough to answer the over-flowings
of her kind inquisitiveness, which lasted
all the time of dinner.
</p>
<p>When the cloth was removed, my mother
proposed his taking up his abode
with us: you see, said she, your sister
and I have got here into a large house;
there is full room enough in it for you
and your servants; and as I think in such
a town as this, it will be a reputable place
for you to live in, I shall be glad of your
company; provided you do not encroach
upon my rules by unseasonable hours, or
receiving visits from such as I may not
approve of for the accquaintance of your
sister.  I was afraid Sir George would
disrelish the terms, as perhaps some of
his accquaintance (though far from faultey (?)

<pb n="19"/>
ones) might fall within my mothers' predicament:
but I was mistaken, he accepted
of the invitation, after making
some slight apologies about the inconvenience
of having so many servants: this
however was soon got over.
</p>
<p>To say the truth, I am very glad that
my brother has consented to be our guests,
as I hope by his means our circle of acquaintance
will be a good deal enlarged.
There is no pleasure in society, without a
proper mixture of well-bred sensible people
of both sexes, and I have hitherto been
chiefly confined to those of my own.
</p>
<p>I asked Sir George jocosely, what he
had brought me home?  He answered, Perhaps
a good husband.&mdash;My mother catched
up the word&mdash;What do you mean, son?  I
mean, madam, that there is come over with
me a gentleman, with whom I became acquainted
in Germany, and whom of all the
men I ever knew, I should wish to have
for a brother.  If Sidney should fortunately
be born under the influence of <hi rend="italic">uncommonly</hi>
good stars, it may happen to be
brought about.  I can tell you (applying

<pb n="20"/>
himself to me) he is prepossessed in your
favour already; I have shewn him some
of your letters, and he thinks you a good
sensible girl.  I told him you were very
well in your person, and that you have
had an excellent education.  I hope so,
said my mother, looking pleased; and
what have you to tell us of this wonderful
main that so much surpasses every body?
Why, madam, for <hi rend="italic">your</hi> part of his character,
he is the best <hi rend="italic">behaved</hi> young man I
every saw.  I never knew any body equal
to him for sobriety, nor so intirely free
from all the other vices of youth: as I
lived in the same house with him for some
months, I had frequent opportunities of
making my observations.  I have known
him to <hi rend="italic">avoid</hi> many irregularities, but
never saw him guilty of <hi rend="italic">one</hi>.
</p>
<p>An admirable character indeed, said my
mother.  So thought I too; but I wanted
to know a little more of him.  Now, Sidney,
for your share in the description, I
must tell you he is most exquisitely handsome,
and extremely sensible.
</p>
<p>Good sense to be sure is requisite, said my

<pb n="21"/>
mother, but as for beauty it is but a fading
flower at best, and in a man not at
all necessary&mdash;.A man is not the worse for
it, however, cried by brother&mdash;.No, my
mother answered, provided it does not
make him vain, and too fond of the admiration
of giddy girls.&mdash;That I will be
sworn is not the case of my friend, answered
Sir George; I believe nobody with
such a person as his (if there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be such
another) would be so little vain of it; nay
I have heard him declare, that even in a
woman he would give the preference to
sense and virtue.
</p>
<p>Good young man! cried my mother.
I should like to be acquainted with him.
(So should I, whispered I to my own
heart.)
</p>
<p>Well, brother, said I, you have drawn a
good picture; but to make it complete,
you must throw in generosity, valour,
sweetness of temper, and a great deal of
money.&mdash;Fie, my dear (said my good
literal parent) a <hi rend="italic">great deal</hi> is not necessary;
a very moderate fortune with <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a man
is sufficient!

<pb n="22"/>
</p>
<p>The good qualities you require in the
finishing of my piece, answered my brother,
he possesses in an eminent degree,
&mdash;will that satisfy you?  As for his fortune,
&mdash;<hi rend="italic">there</hi> perhaps a difficulty may step
in.&mdash;What estate, madam (to my mother)
do you think my sister's fortune may intitle
her to?
</p>
<p>Dear brother, I cried, pray do not
speak in that <hi rend="italic">bargaining</hi> way.
</p>
<p>My mother answered him very gravely,
Your father you know left her but four
thousand pounds; it is in my power to
add a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> to it, if she marries to please
me.  Great matters we have no right o
expect; but a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> good girl, as my daughter
is, I think, deserves something more
than a bare equivalent.  The equality,
said my brother (with a demure look) I
fear is out of all proportion here, for the
gentleman I speak of has but&mdash;six thousand
pounds a year.
</p>
<p>He burst out a laughing; it was not
good-natured, and I was vexed at his joke.
My poor mother dropped her countenance;

<pb n="23"/>
I look silly, as if I had been
disappointed, but I said nothing.
</p>
<p>Then he is above our reach, Sidney,
answered my mother.
</p>
<p>I made no reply.&mdash;Have a good heart,
Sid, cried my brother, if my nonpariel
likes you, when he sees you (I felt myself
hurt, and grow red) and without a
compliment, sister (seeing me look mortified)
I think he will, fortune will be no
objection.  I have already told him the
utmost extent of your expectations; he
would hardly let me mention the subject;
he has a mind for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sister, and if he finds
personal accomplishments answer a brother's
(perhaps partial) description, it
will be your own fault if you have not
the prettiest fellow in England for your
husband.
</p>
<p>My mother reassumed her pleased countenance.
Where is he?  Let us see him.  I
forced a smile, though I did not feel myself
quite satisfied.&mdash;We parted on the
road, my brother answered; he is gone
to Bath for a few weeks; he has sent his
servants and his baggage to town before

<pb n="24"/>
him, and has commissioned me to take a
house for him in St. James's Square, or
some of the adjacent streets; so that we
shall have him in our neighborhood.
</p>
<p>My mother enquired on what account
he went to Bath.  Sir George said, he
complained of a weakness in one of his
wrists, which was the consequence of a
fever that had seized him on his journey
in their return to England.  It seems he
had finished his travels, on which he had
been absent near five years, when my
brother and he met in Germany.  The
liking he took to Sir George protracted
his stay, and he resolved not to quit him
while his health obliged him to continue
abroad; they took a trip to Paris together,
and returned home by Holland.
</p>
<p>The name of this piece of perfection
is Faulkland, Orlando Faulkland.  What
a pretty name Orlando is; My mother
says it is romantic, and wonders ho
<hi rend="italic">sober</hi> people can give their children such
names.
</p>
<p>Now I am dying with curiosity to see
this man.  A few weeks at Bath,&mdash;what

<pb n="25"/>
business had he to go to Bath till he had
first settled his houshold at London?  His
wrist might have grown well without the
pump.  I am afraid he is gone to Bath
only to shew himself, and that he will
be snapped up before he comes to town.
I wish Sir George had kept the account
of him to himself, till he returned to
London again.

	<head><date value="1703-04-07"><hi rend="italic">April 7.</hi>&mdash;</date></head>
<p>We have settled Sir George's
oeconomy within doors: my mother has
been very busy all day in fixing trunks,
portmanteaus, and boxes, in their proper
places; and in appropriating the rooms
for his men, which she has taken care
shall be as remote from those of our servants
as the house will admit.  She says,
she knows our own domestics to be orderly
and regular, but she cannot answer
for what other people's may be.
</p>
<p>I begin to recover my spirits: my bother's
arrival has given new life to the
family; my mother thinks, that in <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
company, with a lady or two, there will
be no impropriety in suffering me to go,

<pb n="26"/>
at least, half a dozen times into public
during the season, even without the sanction
of her presence.&mdash;How kind, how
considerate is this dear mother!  I find this
was one (amongst others) of her principal
reasons for wishing Sir George to be with
us, as it will save her form the necessity
of going to public diversions, which otherwise
she would have done, rather than
have me debarred the pleasure of partaking
of them, through the want of a proper
protector.  Every day lays me under
fresh obligations to her.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d14">
	<head><date value="1703-04-20"><hi rend="italic">April 20.</hi>&mdash;</date> </head>
<p>My brother has had another
letter from Mr. Faulkland.  He
has been but a fortnight at Bath, and already
has found benefit from the use of
the pump; I wish his wrist was quite
well; I never was so impatient to see any
body.&mdash;But, Sidney, have a care&mdash;this
heart has never yet been touch'd: this
man is represented as a dangerous object.
What an ill-fated girl should I be, if
I should fall in love with him, and he
should happen not to like me?  Should

<pb n="27"/>
<hi rend="italic">happen</hi>, what a vain expression was that?
I would not for the world any one should
see it but my Cecilia.&mdash;Well, if he should
not like me, what then? why, I will not
like him.  I have a heart not very susceptible
of what we young women call
love; and in all likelihood I shall be as
indifferent towards him, as he may be
towards me.&mdash;Indeed, I think I ought to
resolve on not liking him; for notwithstanding
those fine out-lines of a character
which my brother gave of him in the
presence of my mother, I have since drawn
out of Sir George, who is always talking
of him, some farther particulars, which
do not please me so well; for I think
he is made up of contrarieties.
</p>
<p>Nature, says Sir George, never formed
a temper so gentle, so humane, so benevolent
as his; yet, when provoked, no
temper is more furious.  You would imagine
him so humble, that he thinks every
one superior to himself; yet through this
disguise have I discovered, at certain times,
a pride which make shim look down on
all mankind.  With a disposition formed

<pb n="28"/>
to relish, and a heart attache to the
domestic pleasures of life, he is of so enterprising
a temper, that dangers and difficulties
rather encourage than dishearten
him in the pursuit of a favourite point.
His ideas of love, honour, generosity, and
gratitude, are so refined, that no hero in
romance ever went beyond him; of this
I was convinced from many little incidents
which occurred in the course of my acquaintance
with him.  The modesty and
affability of his deportment makes every
body fansy, when he is in company with
them, that he is delighted with their conversation;
nay, he often affects to be improved
and informed; yet there is a sly
turn to ridicule in him, which, though
without the least tincture of ill-nature,
makes him see and represent things in a
light, the very opposite of that in which
you fancied he saw them.  With the nicest
discernment, where he permits his judgement
alone to determine, let passion interfere,
and a child can impose on him.
Though, as I have already told you, he is
very handsome, he affects to dispise beauty

<pb n="29"/>
in his own sex; yet it is easy to perceive,
by the nice care he takes in his dress
(though the farthest in the world from a
fop) that he does not altogether disregard
it in his own person.
</p>
<p>Are not these faults?  Yes, surely they
are; yet Sir George protests he has none;
or at least says, if these be such, they are
so over-balanced by his good qualities,
that unless it by <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, sister (flattering creature!
though that is seldom his failing)
I don't know the woman that deserves
him.  I did not thank him for the compliment
he paid me, at the expence of
the rest of our poor sex.

<p>A month is past since my brother
arrived, and Mr. Faulkland does not
yet talk of coming to town.&mdash;If Sir George
had drawn half such a flattering picture
of me to him, as he has done of him to
me, his curiosity would have brought him
here sooner.&mdash;My mother has mentioned
him several times, and asked when he is to
be in town.  My brother has taken a very
handsome house for him in the Square.

<pb n="30"/>
We are all in expectation of this blazing
star's making its appearance in London.
If he stays much longer, my patience will
be so tired, that I shall not give a pinch
of snuff to see him.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d16">
	<head><date value="1703-05-19"><hi rend="italic">May 19.</hi>&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Six weeks, and no news
of Mr. Faulkland's coming!  I'll positively
give him but another week; I
begin to think myself affronted by his
stay.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d17">
	<head><date value="1703-05-23"><hi rend="italic">May 23.</hi>&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Now, now, my Cecilia,
I can gratify your curiosity at full: he is
come at last; Mr. Faulkland, I mean; Orlando
is come! we had a message from
him this morning, to enquire after all our
healths; he was just arrived at his house
in the Square: Sir George flew to him
directly, and said he would bring him
without ceremony to take a family dinner.
My mother bid him do so; and she held
a quarter of an hour's conference with her
cook.  She is always elegant and exact
at her table; but we were more than ordinarily
so to-day.  My brother brought

<pb n="31"/>
Mr. Faulkland a little before dinner-time,
and presented him to my mother and
me, with that kind of freedom that almost
look'd as if he were already one of the
family.
</p>
<p>We had both been prepossessed highly
in favour of his figure, a circumstance
that seldom is of advantage to persons
on their first appearance: but here it had
not that effect; Sir George did not overrate
the personal accomplishments of his
friend.  Now you'll expect I should describe
him to you, perhaps, and paint this
romantic hero in the glowing colours of
romantic exaggeration.  But I'll disappoint
you,&mdash;and tell you, that he is neither
like an Adonis nor an Apollo,&mdash;that he
has no hyacinthine curls flowing down
his back; no eyes like suns, whose brightness
and majesty strike the beholders
dumb; nor, in short, no rays of divinity
about him; yet he is the handsomest
mortal man that I ever saw.&mdash;I will not
say that his voice is harmony itself, and
that all the loves and graces (for why
should not there be male as well as female

<pb n="32"/>
graces?) attend on his motions; that
Minerva presides over his lips, and every
feature has its attendant Cupid.&mdash;But I
will acknowledge that his voice in speaking
is inexpressibly pleasing (you know
how I admire an agreeable voice); that
his air and motions are easy, genteel,k and
graceful; his conversation sensible and
polite, and without the least tincture of
affectation, that thing, which of all others,
would to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> destroy the charms of an
angel.&mdash;In short, without hyperbole, that
he is, what every one must allow, a perfectly
handsome and accomplished young
man.
</p>
<p>I never saw my mother appear so
pleased with any one.  The polite freedom
of his address, the attention and deference
he seemed to pay to her sentiments
(and the dear good woman talked
more to him, I think, than every I heard
her do to any one on so short an acquaintance)
delighted her beyond expression.
I bore no great part in the conversation,
but was not, however, quite overlooked
by Mr. Faulkland.  He referred to

<pb n="33"/>
me in discourse now-and-then, and seemed
pleased with me; at least I fancied so.
My brother endeavoured to draw me
out, as he said afterwards.  The intention
was kind, but poor Sir George is not delicate
enough in those matters; I should
have done better if he had let me alone.
I thought of the conversations we had so
often had about Mr. Faulkland, and could
not help considering myself like a piece
of goods that was to be shewn to the best
advantage to a purchaser.  This reflection
threw a sort of constraint over my behaviour,
that (fool as I was) I had not courage
enough to shake off, and I did not
acquit myself at all to my own mind.  I
had, notwithstanding, the good fortune to
please my mother infinitely.  She told me,
after our visitor was gone, that my behaviour
had been <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi> proper; and
blamed Sir George for his wanting to
engage me too often in conversation.
You may assure yourself, son, she said,
that a man of Mr. Faulkland's understanding
will not like a young lady the
worse for her silence.  She spoke enough

<pb n="34"/>
to shew that it was not for want of knowing
what to say that she held her tongue.
The man who does not reckon a modest
reserve amongst the chief recommendations
of a woman, should be no husband
for Sidney.  I am sure, when I married
Sir Robert, he had never heard me speak
twenty sentences.  Sir George agreed
with her as to the propriety of her observation,
in regard to a modest reserve;
but said, people now-a-days did not
carry their ideas of it quite so far as they
did when his father's courtship began
with her; and added, that a young lady
might <hi rend="italic">speak</hi> with as much modesty as she
could hold her tongue.
</p>
<p>I did not interfere in the debate, only
said, I was very glad to have my mother's
approbation of my conduct.  This put
an end to the argument, and my mother
launched out into high encomiums on
Mr. Faulkland.  She said, upon her
<hi rend="italic">truth</hi> he was the finest young man she
ever saw, in every respect.  So modest,
so well bred, so very entertaining, and
so unassuming, with all his fine accomplishments:

<pb n="35"/>
She was quite astonished,
and owned she almost despaired of finding
a young gentleman, of the present
mode of education, so <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unexceptionable
in his behaviour.  If his morals
answered to his outward deportment,&mdash;
there she stopped; or rather Sir George
interrupted her.  I hope you'll believe,
madam, that my knowledge of mankind
is not so circumscribed, but that I can
distinguish between a real and an assumed
character; and I will venture to assert,
that, int he whole circle of my acquaintance,
I do not know <hi rend="italic">one</hi> so unobjectionable,
even in your strict sense of the word
<hi rend="italic">morals</hi>, as Mr. Faulkland.
</p>
<p>Well, said my mother, I have the pleasure
to observe to you (and I think I
am seldom mistaken in my judgment,
that Mr. Faulkland is at least as well
pleased with Sidney as we are with him.&mdash;
What say you, daughter?  Ay, what say
you, sister? cry'd Sir George,&mdash;I think,
madam, that Mr. Faulkland is an accomplished
gentleman, and&mdash;'and that
you could be content to look no farther,

<pb n="36"/>
if matters are brought to bear;
eh, Sidney?'  (I need not tell you whose
speech this was.)&mdash;Brother, that is going
a little too far, for the first time of my
seeing him.  A great <hi rend="italic">deal</hi> too far, my
mother said; let us first know Mr. Faulkland's
mind from himself, before we say
a word more of the matter.
</p>
<p>Sir George told us, that Mr. Faulkland,
at going away, had requested he would
sup with him at his own house, as he said
he had a few visits of form to pay, and
should be at home early in the evening.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d18">
	<head><date value="1703-05-24"><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 24.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>My mother and I were in
bed before my brother cam in last night,
though he keeps very good hours in general.
When we met this morning at
breakfast, I saw by Sir George's face that
he was brimful of something.&mdash;Faulkland
don't like you, Sidney, said he, abruptly;
&mdash;How can you or I help that, brother?
cry'd I, colouring; tho', to tell you the
truth, I did not believe him; for I knew,
if it <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been so, he would not have come
out with it so bluntly.  But my mother

<pb n="37"/>
who always takes every word she hears
literally, took him up very short; 'If he
does not, Sir, it is not polite in you to
tell your sister so; I hope Sidney may
be <hi rend="italic">liked</hi> by as good a man as Mr. Faulkland,'
and up she tossed her dear honest
head.  Sir George burst out a laughing.
My mother looked angry; she was afraid
her sagacity would be call'd in question,
after what she had pronounced the evening
before.  I looked silly, but pretended
to smile.  Sir George was clown enough
to laugh on; at last (to my mother) 'But,
my dear madam, can you believe me
serious in what I said? have you so good
an opinion of my veracity, or so ill a
one of my breeding, as to suppose I
would shock my sister by such a rude
declaration, if I meant any thing by it
but a joke?'  Indeed, Sidney (looking
half smiling at me) I would not be as
much in love with our sovereign lady the
queen, as poor Faulkland is with you,
for my whole estate.
</p>
<p>This put me a great deal more out of
countenance than what he had said at

<pb n="38"/>
first.  Nay, brother, now you are too extravagant
the other way.&mdash;My mother
looked surprized, but recovered her good
humour presently.&mdash;Dear George, there is
no knowing when you are in earnest and
when not: but, as Sidney says, now you
are rather too extravagant.  You might
say so to Faulkland, answered my brother,
if you were to hear him; I could get nothing
from him the whole night but your
praises.  I thought, said my pleased mother,
he had not <hi rend="italic">disliked</hi> the girl.&mdash;Now
you see, son, her <hi rend="italic">silence</hi> did her no harm;
and she smiled tenderly at me.  Come,
said Sir George, things are mighty well
on all sides.  Faulkland has begged of
me, that I would use my interest with
you, mother (whom he thinks one of the
best of women) that he may be permitted
in form to make his address to Miss
Bidulph.  <hi rend="italic">My</hi> interest he knows he has,
and I hope, madam, he will also have your
approbation;&mdash;He desired me to explain
minutely to you every circumstance of his
fortune: what his estate is I have told
you; and his family is of known distinction.

<pb n="39"/>
He begged I would not <hi rend="italic">mention</hi>
Sidney's fortune; and said, that if, upon a
farther acquaintance, he should have the
happiness to be acceptable to my sister,
he should insist upon leaving the appointment
of her settlement to lady Bidulph
and myself.  I told him I would lay this
proposal before you, and could for his
present comfort inform him, that, as I
believed my sister had no prepossessions
in favour of any one else, I was sure, if he
met with your concurrence, her's would
follow of course.
</p>
<p>A very discrete answer, said my mother;
just such a one as I would have
dictated to you, if I had been at your elbow.
I believe we may venture to suppose,
that Sidney <hi rend="italic">has</hi> no prepossessions;
and as this is as handsome an offer
as can possibly be made, I have no objections
(if you have none, my dear) to
admit Mr. Faulkland upon the terms he
proposes.
</p>
<p>What answer ought I go have made,
Cecilia?  Why, to be sure, just the one I
<hi rend="italic">did</hi> make&mdash;I have <hi rend="italic">no</hi> prepossessions, madam,

<pb n="40"/>
looking down and blushing, till it
actually painted me, for I was really startled.
My Cecilia knows I am not a
prude.
</p>
<p>My dear! cry'd my mother, and took
me by the hand&mdash;
</p>
<p>Poor Sidney, said Sir George, how you
are to be pitied!  Mr. Faulkland purposes
waiting on you in the afternoon, if he is
not <hi rend="italic">forbid</hi>, and he looked so teazingly
sly, that my mother bid him leave off his
<hi rend="italic">pranks</hi>.
</p>
<p>The day is over,&mdash;Mr. Faulkland spent
the evening with us, no other company
but our own family.  My mother likes
him better even than before&mdash;Thy <hi rend="italic">mother</hi>
&mdash;disingenuous girl! why dost thou not
speak thy own sentiments?  (There is an
apostrophe for they use, my Cecilia.)  Well
then, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sentiments you shall have, you
have an undoubted right to know them
on all subjects, but particularly on this
interesting one.
</p>
<p>I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> think Mr. Faulkland the most
amiable of men, and if my heart were
(happily for me it is not) <hi rend="italic">very</hi> susceptible

<pb n="41"/>
of tender impressions, I really believe
I should in time be absolutely in love
with him.  This confessions will not satisfy
you: may be it is not enough&mdash;yet, in
truth, Cecilia, it is all that at present I
can afford you.
</p>
<p>The thoughts of the aukward figure I
should make in the evening visit, sat
heavy on my spirits all day.&mdash;Can you
conceive any thing more distressing than
the situation of a poor girl, receiving the
visit of a man, who, for the first time,
comes professedly as her admirer?  I had
conceived a frightful idea of such an interview,
having formed my notions of it
only from romances, where set speeches of
an ell long are made by the lover, and
answers of a proportionable size are returned
in form by the lady.  But Mr.
Faulkland soon delivered me from my
anxiety.  His easy, but incomparably
polite and sensible freedom of address
quickly made me lose my ridiculous
fears.&mdash;He made no other use of this
visit, than to recommend himself more
strongly to our esteem, by such means

<pb n="42"/>
as proved how well he deserved it.  If he
was particular to me, either in his looks
or manner, it was under the regulation
of such a nice decorum, that I (who supposed
I must have sunk with downright
confusion) was hardly disconcerted during
the whole visit.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d19">
	<head><date value="1703-06-10"><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 10.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I do really think my good
mother grows so fond of Mr. Faulkland,
that if he goes on at this rate, he will
get the start even of Sir George in her affections&mdash;
'Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland</hi> said so and so;
Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland</hi> is of opinion; and I am
sure you will allow Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland</hi> to be
a good judge of such and such things.'
</p>
<p>To say the truth, the man improves
upon you every hour you know him.
And yet I have discovered in him some of
those little (and they are <hi rend="italic">but</hi> little)alloys
to his many good qualities, which Sir
George at first told me of.  The interest
I may one day have in him makes me a
closer observer than I should otherwise
be.  There <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that sly turn to ridicule
which my brother mentioned; yet, to do

<pb n="43"/>
him justice, he never employs it, but
where it is deserved; and then too with
so much vivacity and good humour, that
one cannot be angry with him.
</p>
<p>We had a good deal of company at
dinner with us to-day; amongst the rest,
young Sayers, who is just returned from
his travels, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> calls it.  You remember
he went away a good humoured, inoffensive,
quiet fool; he has brought no one
ingredient of that character back with
him, but the last; for such a stiff, conceited,
overbearing, talkative, impertinent
coxcomb does not now exist.  His mother,
who, poor woman, you know originally
made a simpleton of the boy, contributes
now all in her power to finish the fop;
and she carries him about with her everywhere
for a shew. (?)  We were assembled
in the drawing room before dinner: in
burst (for it was not a common entry)
Master Sayers, and his mama, the cub
handing in the old lady.&mdash;<hi rend="italic">so</hi> stiff, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi>
aukward, and <hi rend="italic">so</hi> ungraceful, and so <hi rend="italic">very</hi>
unlike Mr. Faulkland, that I pitied the
poor thing, who thought that everybody

<pb n="44"/>
would admire him as much as his mother
did.  After he had been presented to the
ladies (for it was the first time we had
seen him since he came home) he took a
turn or two about the room, to exhibit
his person: then, applying himself to a
picture which hung over the door (a fine
landscape of Claude Lorrain, which Mr.
Faulkland himself had brought over and
given to Sir George) he asked my brother,
in a tone scarce articulate, whether we
had any <hi rend="italic">painters</hi> in England?  My mother,
who by chance heard him, and by greater
chance understood him, answered, before
Sir George had time, <hi rend="italic">Painters</hi>, Sir! yes,
sure, and some very good ones too: why,
you cannot have forgot <hi rend="italic">that</hi>; it is not
much above a year since you went abroad
(for you must know he had been recalled
upon the death of an uncle, who had left
him his estate).  I observed Mr. Faulkland
constrained a very sly laugh, on account
both of the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of my mother's taking
his question, and her innocently undesigned
reprimand.  Sayers pretended not
to hear her, but looking through his

<pb n="45"/>
fingers, as if to throw the picture into
perspective, that is a pretty good piece,
said he, for a copy.  Oh! cry'd his mother,
there is no pleasing <hi rend="italic">you</hi>&mdash;people who have
been <hi rend="italic">abroad</hi> are such connoisseurs in painting.
&mdash;No body making any immediate
answer, Mr. Faulkland stepped up to Mr.
Sayers, and with such a roguish humility
in his countenance, that you would have
sworn he was a very ignoramus, said,
'Are you of opinion, Sir, that that picture
is nothing but a copy?'  Nothing more,
take my word for it, Sir: When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was at
Rome, there was a Dutchman there, who
made it his business to take copies <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
copies, which he dispersed, and had people
to sell for him in different parts, at
pretty good prices; and they did mighty
well; for very few people <hi rend="italic">know</hi> a picture,
and I'll answer for it there are not many
masters of eminence, but what have a
hundred originals palmed upon them
more than every they painted in their lives.
</p>
<p>Mr. Faulkland then proceeded to ask
him abundance of questions, which any
one, who did not know him well, would

<pb n="46"/>
have thought he proposed for no other
end but a desire of information: and the
poor coxcomb Sayers plumed himself
upon displaying so much travelled knowlege,
to a wondering ignorant Englishman,
who had never been out of his own
country.  The company were divided
into little chatting parties, as is usual
when people are whiling away an half hour
before dinner.  Mrs. Sayers, my mother,
and I, were sitting together on a couch,
near enough to hear the conversation that
passed between the two gentlemen, at
least as much as was not sunk in the affected,
half-pronounced sentences of Mr.
Sayers.  His mother, to whom he was
the principal object of attention in the
company, seemed mightily pleased at the
opportunity her son had, from the inquisitiveness
of Mr. Faulkland (whom she
did not know) of showing his taste in the
polite arts, and often looked about to observe
if any body else attended to them.
My mother, dear literal woman! (as I often
call her to you) took every thing seriously,
and whispered to me, how pretty that

<pb n="47"/>
is, Sidney! how condescending in Mr.
Faulkland! you see he does not make a
parade of his <hi rend="italic">own</hi> knowlege in these
matters, but is pleased to reap the benefit
of other people's.  I, who saw the latent
roguery, could hardly contain myself.  Indeed
I was amazed at Mr. Faulkland'
grave inquisitive face, and was very glad
my mother did not find him out.
</p>
<p>Sayers, elated with having shone so conspicuously
(for he observed that both my
mother and I attended to his discourse)
proceeded to shew away with an immensity
of vanity and frothy chat, beginning
every new piece of history with
'When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was at Rome, or, when <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was
at Paris'.&mdash;At last, unluckily for him,
speaking of an incident (which made a
good deal of noise, and happened at the
first-mentioned place) in which two English
gentlemen had been concerned, he
said it was about eleven months ago, just
before he left Rome.  My mother, who
had heard Mr. Faulkland relate the same
story, but with some very different circumstances,
immediately said, Mr. Faulkland,

<pb n="48"/>
have I not heard you speak of that?
You were at Rome yourself when the affair
happened; and if I be not mistaken, it was
through your interest with the cardinal
of&mdash;that the business was made up.
</p>
<p>If a spectre had appeared to poor Sayers,
he could not have looked more aghast.
He dropped his visage half-way down
his breast, and, for the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> time, speaking
very <hi rend="italic">plain</hi>, and very loud too, with a
stare of astonishment, Have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> been at
<hi rend="italic">Rome</hi>, Sir?  I was there for a little time,
Sir, answered Mr. Faulkland, with real
modesty; for he pitied the mortified buzzard;
and I know the story was <hi rend="italic">represented</hi>
as you have told it; the circumstances
differed in a few particulars, but the facts
were nearly as you have related them.
</p>
<p>How obligingly did he reconcile the
out-of-countenance Sayers to himself
and to the company?  Were you long
abroad, pray Sir? said the coxcomb:
About five years, Sir, answered Mr.
Faulkland; but I perceive, by the conversation
I have had the honour of holding
with you to-day, that many accurate

<pb n="49"/>
and curious observations escaped me,
which you made in a much shorter space
of time; for the communication of which
I think myself extremely obliged to you.
Whether the poor soul thought him serious
(as my mother did) I cannot tell; he
made him a bow, however, for the compliment;
but was so lowered, that he did
not say a word more of Rome or Paris
for the rest of the day: and in this we had
a double advantage; for as he had nothing
else to talk of, his mouth was
effectually stopped, except when Mr.
Faulkland, out of compassion, asked him
(as he often did) such questions as he
thought he could answer, without exposing
his ignorance: for he was contented
to have enjoyed it in their t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, and was far from wishing the company
to be witnesses of it.
</p>
<p>I think such a bagatelle may give you
some idea of this man's turn.  I told it
to Sir George; he laughed heartily, and
said it was <hi rend="italic">so</hi> like him!  My brother
loves even his faults, though he will
not allow me to call them by that name.

<p>You are unkind, Cecilia,
and do not do justice to my sincerity, when
you say, <hi rend="italic">you are sure I am in love with Mr.
Faulkland</hi>.  If I were, can you conceive
it possible that I would deny it to you?
Ah! my sister, must I suspect <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of
wanting candour by your making a charge
of disingenuity against your friend?  Indeed,
Cecilia, if I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> in love with him, I
do not <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> know it myself.  I will repeat
it to you, I think him the most amiable
of men, and should certainly give him
the preference, if I were left to a free
choice, over all the rest of his sex; at least
all that I have ever yet seen; though possibly
there <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be handsomer, wiser, better
men, but they have not fallen within
my observation.  I am not however so
prepossessed in his favour, as to suppose
him a phoenix; and if any unforeseen
event were to prevent my being his, I am
sure I should bear it, and behave very
handsomely.
</p>
<p>And yet perhaps this may be only bragging
like a coward, because I think a very
short time will put it out of the power
of fortune to divide us.  Yet certain as
the even of our marriage appears to me
at present, I still endeavour to keep a sort
of guard over my wishes, and will not
give my heart leave to center <hi rend="italic">all</hi> its happiness
in him; and therefore I cannot rank
myself amongst the first-rate lovers, who
have neither eyes, nor ears, nor sensations,
but for one object.  This, Mr.
Faulkland says, is his case, in regard to
me.  But I think we women should not
love at such ar ate, till duty makes the
passion a virtue; and till <hi rend="italic">that</hi> becomes
my case, I am so much a philosopher in
love, that I am determined not to let it
absorb any of the other cordial affections,
which I owe to my relations and
my friends.
</p>
<p>I think we ought always to form some
laws to ourselves for the regulation of our
conduct: without this, what an impertinent
dream must the life be of almost
every young person of our sex?  You, my
dear, though with an uncommon understanding
of your own, have always been
intirely conducted by your wise parents;

<pb n="52"/>
and in this I make it my boast to have
followed your example.  I have been accustomed
from my infancy to pay an implicit
obedience to the best of mothers;
the conforming to this never yet cost me
an uneasy minute, and I am sure never
will.

	<head><date value="1703-07-05"><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 5.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>A little incident happened
to-day which pleased my mother wonderfully.
She had been at morning prayers
(as you know is her daily custom;) when
returning home in her chair, one of the
men happened to slip his foot, and fell
down just before Mr. Faulkland's house.
He was so much hurt, that he could go
no farther; and the footmen immediately
opening the chair, told her she had better
step into Mr. Faulkland's, till he called
another, or got a man to assist in carrying
her home.  One of Mr. Faulkland's servants
happened to be standing at the door;
so that, without any previous notice, she
was immediately conducted into a parlour,
where Mr. Faulkland was sitting at
breakfast.  She found with him two

<pb n="53"/>
pretty little children at his knee, to one
of whom he had given some cake; and
the elder of the two, a boy of about
five years old, he was gravely lecturing,
though with great gentleness, for having
told a like.  My mother asked him, with
some surprize, whose children those
were?  He smiled, and told her they were
his coachman's; and then ordered the
footman to carry them down, bidding the
little boy to be sure to remember what he
had said to him.
</p>
<p>My mother inquired, if he permitted
them to be in the house?  He said, he did;
and that he had been induced to it from the
distress he had seen their poor father in a
few days before.  He is an honest careful
fellow, continued Mr. Faulkland, and has
lived in my family from a boy.  He was
married to a good sort of a body, who took
great care of these children, and helped
to maintain them decently by her work.
The poor woman died in childbed last
week; and the person who attended her in
her illness (for she had no servant) took
that opportunity of robbing the lodging;

<pb n="54"/>
and after plundering the poor creature of
every thing that was worth carrying away,
locked up those two children, which you
saw with me, and the new-born infant,
with the corpse of their mother.
</p>
<p>The poor little wretches continued in
that dismal situation all night, having
cried themselves to sleep, without being
heard, though there were some other people
in the house.  The morning following
I happened to make an early visit in the
neighbourhood of this distressed little family,
and my coachman, who was a very
affectionate husband and father, took that
opportunity of calling on his wife, whom
he had not been able to see for three days.
The cries of his children (now awake and
almost starved) obliged him hastily to
break open the door of the room, where
the poor fellow was shocked with the
dismal spectacle of his wife's motionless
corpse in bed, the infant almost expiring
at her side, and the other two poor little
famished creatures calling to their dead
mother for bread.
</p>
<p>The sight almost deprived the man of
his senses.  He snatched up his two eldest

<pb n="55"/>
children in his arms, and ran raving to the
house where I was, tearing his hair like
a madman.  He told me his mournful
story; with which I was so affected, that
I ordered one of my footmen to carry the
two children home to my house directly,
and desired their father to look out for
some body to take care of the young one,
which he soon did.
</p>
<p>The honest poor fellow was delighted,
when he came home to find his two children
well and merry; for they were sensible
of no want but their food.  But his
grief returned on him with great violence,
at the thoughts of his being obliged to
put them in to the hands of people, who,
he said, he was sure would not be so kind
to them as their own poor mother had
been; and my man told me he did nothing
but kiss them, and cry over them the whole
day.  To make his mind easy at once, I
let him know they should remain here under
his own eye, till they were old enough
to be put to school; and accordingly directed
my housekeeper to see that they

<pb n="56"/>
were taken care of; which has made their
father very happy.
</p>
<p>The little rogues have found their way
up to me, and I love sometimes to hear
them prattle; but this morning the eldest
having told me a lie of his brother, I
was checking him for it when you came in.
</p>
<p>My mother was so pleased with Mr.
Faulkland's conduct in this little history,
that she repeated it to me word for word
as soon as she came home, and concluded
with observing how <hi rend="italic">good</hi> a <hi rend="italic">creature</hi>
Mr. Faulkland must be, who in so tender
a manner interested himself in his poor
servant's misfortune.  Most young gentlemen,
said she, would have thought they
had done enough in giving the servant
money to have provided for his children
as well as he could: it is in such trifles as
these that we often discover the excellence
of the heart.
</p>
<p>You will suppose, my dear, that I am
not displeased at any circumstance that
can raise Mr. Faulkland's character in my
pious mother's esteem.  I heard the story

<pb n="57"/>
with great pleasure; but not making any
comments on it, Sir George (who was
present at the relation) said, Well, Sidney,
you are either very affected, or the greatest
stoic in the world; why, any other girl
would be in raptures at such a proof of
the honest tenderness of that heart which
she knows she possesses intirely, and on
which the whole of her future happiness
depends.  I am very sensible of Mr.
Faulkland's worth, brother, I replied, and
I can feel without being transported.  I
will be hanged, said Sir George, if I
think you love Faulkland, at least not
half so well as he deserves; and I dare
swear you have not been honest enough to
tell him yet whether you do or not.  It is
time enough for that, I replied; if Mr.
Faulkland and I should be married, I hope
I shall give him no cause to complain of
my want of affection.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">If</hi> you should be married! said my brother;
I know of no possible <hi rend="italic">ifs</hi>, unless they
are of your own making.  I know of none
neither, answered my mother; yet I think
Sidney is in the right to be doubtful about

<pb n="58"/>
all human events.  Many things, added she
gravely (for she has a great veneration for
old sayings) fall out between the cup and
the lip.
</p>
<p>I think mother, said Sir George, bluntly,
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> were disappointed in your <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
love; I have heard you speak of it, but
I forget the circumstances.  As I had never
heard my mother make any mention of
this particular, I begged she would oblige
me with relating it.
</p>
<p>When I was about one and twenty,
daughter, said she, a match was concluded
by my father between me and a
very fine gentleman.  I loved him, and
(as I suppose all young women do in the
like circumstances) believed myself equally
beloved by him.  The courtship had been
of a year's standing; for you must know
I was not very easily won.  Every thing
was settled, and the day appointed for
our marriage arrived; when, instead of
the bridegroom, whom we every minute
expected, there came a letter from him
directed to me.  The contents were, that
having formerly been engaged to a young

<pb n="59"/>
lady by the most solemn vows, he had,
unfortunately for them both, forgot them
all on seeing me, and had broke through
every obligation divine and human to obtain
me.  He intreated mine, and my
family's pardon, in the most pathetic
manner, for having engaged our esteem
so far as to consent to an union, of which
he found himself unworthy, and which
it was impossible for him to accomplish;
for, said he, the wrongs I have done the
woman, whose youth I seduced, rise to
my imagination with so much horror,
that, for the empire of the world, I would
not complete my guilt, by devoting that
hand to another, to which she only as a
right.  He enlarged greatly on the sufferings
of his heart, in the struggle between
his love for me, and his duty to
the person who had his first vows; and
whom, he declared, his infidelity had almost
brought to the grave.  He claimed
my pity, both on his own and her account:
and repeatedly intreated my forgiveness
of his fault.

<pb n="60"/>
</p>
<p>The whole letter, which was very long,
was so expressive of a mind overwhelmed
with despair, that I was exceedingly
shocked at the reading of it.  What
could I say?  The plea he offered for his
seemingly strange conduct, was too just
to admit of any objections.  I own the
disappointment afflicted me, but I bore it
with a becoming resolution.  My family
were at first exceedingly exasperated
against my doubly unfaithful lover; but,
upon inquiring into the facts, they found
the truth to be as he had represented it.
The conclusion was, that, upon the very
day on which he was to have been married
to me, and on which he had writ me
that gloomy letter, he was seized with a
melancholy, which encreasing on him daily,
soon after ended in absolute madness,
and he was confined for the remainder
of his life.  The young lady lived but
a short time after the melancholy fate of
her lover, and died, as it was said, of a
broken heart.
</p>
<p>It was a great comfort to me to reflect,
that my fate disposed otherwise of me

<pb n="61"/>
than to this unhappy gentleman; for I
am very sure, had these fatal events happened
in consequence of my marriage
with him, that I should never have survived
it.
</p>
<p>This extraordinary anecdote of my
mother's life, which I had never had a
hint of before (for she could not speak of
it without great emotion) very much affected
me.  Sir George said, the story
was more tragical than he had apprehended,
and told my mother, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> was
an accident which fell out between the
cup and the lip with a vengeance.
</p>
<p>My mother continued thoughtful for a
good while; and I was sorry that the
memory of this melancholy story had
been revived; but Sir George talked and
laughed us both into spirits again.

<p>This Mr. Faulkland is a
princely man; he has sent me <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a set
of jewels!  My mother says they are too
fine for a private gentlewoman; but
George tells her they are not a bit too fine
for Mr. Faulkland's <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>, and only suitable

<pb n="62"/>
to his fortune.  You know I have but
few of my own, these only which were
my mother's when she was a maiden.
The greatest part of her's, and by much
the finest, were presented to her by my
father; but those she reserves for Sir
George, against the time of his marriage,
as a present for his lady; for they
are family jewels.

<p>My probation is over, my
Cecilia.&mdash;The formidable question has
been put to me, and I have answered
it&mdash;Ay marry, say you, but how?  In the
<hi rend="italic">negative</hi>, to be sure, my dear&mdash;No, no, my
Cecilia; a valuable (psha! what an affected
cold word that is) a lovely and most worthy
man, with six thousand pounds a year,
is a prize that a country girl must not
expect to draw every day.  Mr. Faulkland,
in <hi rend="italic">lover-like</hi> phrase, demanded from
me the time of his destined happiness: I
referred him to my mother.  She, good
and delicate as she is, referred him to
Sir George.  George blurted out some
sudden day that startled us both, when

<pb n="63"/>
Mr. Faulkland reported it to us.  I stammered
out something; my mother hesitated;
Sir George came in, and blundered
at us all; so I think we compounded for
the time, and amongst us fixed upon this
day month&mdash;And full soon enough, says
my Cecilia: you have known the man
but about six weeks, and surely a month
is as little time as you can take in preparing
fineries.  True, my girl, true; but
it is all George's doings.  Indeed, my
Cecilia, without affectation, I had much
rather have had a longer day; though I
think I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the man as well in those six
weeks, as if I had been accquainted with
him so many years; for he has spent
most of his hours with us every day
during that time; and my mother says, he
is one of those in <hi rend="italic">whom there is no guile</hi>.
</p>
<p>Sir George is downright insolent; he
declares I am not sensible of my own happiness,
and that I deserve to be married
to some little petty Wiltshire 'squire.  He
so piques himself upon making this match,
there is no bearing him.  He has taken
all matters of settlement upon himself,

<pb n="64"/>
and insists on my mother's not interposing.
She acquiesces, but charges my
brother not to let Mr. Faulkland's generosity
carry him too far, and bids him remember
what is due to his friend, as
well as to his sister.

My mother, you know, is exactly
punctilious in every thing.  Such a quantity
of things <hi rend="italic">are</hi> bought, and such a
quantity to <hi rend="italic">be</hi> bought, that there is no
end of journeys into the city.  Then milleners
and mantur-makers!  One would
think I was going to pass the remainder
of my life in a remote country, where
there were no kind of manufactures or
artificers to be come at; and that I was
to provide cloathing for half a century.

<p>I have much upon my

employ a secretary, to give you a minute
detail of all our foppery; for I shall not

<p>Sir George has often told
me, that he knows of no fault Mr.
Faulkland has, but a violence of temper
when provoked.  I saw an instance of it
to-day, which I was sorry for, and the
more so, as I was in some measure accessary
to it.  Mr. Faulkland, my brother,
a lady of our accquaintance, and myself
took a ride in Hyde-Park this morning.
We were to dine at Kensington (where
my mother was to meet us) at the house
of the lady (a relation of Mr. Faulkland's)
who was with us.
</p>
<p>We rode into the stable-yard of her
house, in order to alight.  My horse,
which happened to be a young one that
Sir George had newly bought, saw some
object that made him shy of advancing,
and he turned suddenly about.  A footman
of Mr. Faulkland's, who chanced
to stand just behind me, very imprudently,
though I am sure without design
of harm, gave him a stroke with his
whip, which made the animal plunge and
throw me, as I had not time to recover
my seat from the first short turn he made.

<pb n="66"/>
I luckily received not the least hurt, and
was on my feet in an instant.  But Mr.
Faulkland, who had leaped of his horse
even before I fell, was so enraged at the
fellow, that he gave him two or three
sound lashes with his whip across the
shoulders, which fell on him as quick
as lightning.  I am inclined to think
the servant was not sober; for he had
the insolence to lay hold of his master's
whip, and muttered an oath or two.
Mr. Faulkland's attention being quickly
turned to me, he took no farther notice
of the man.  We went into the house;
and after I had assured them all I was not
in the least hurt, I begged of Mr. Faulkland
to forgive the footman, who had undesignedly
caused the accident.  He made
a thousand apologies for having let his
anger so far transport him, as to chastise
his servant in a manner he was not used
to do; but the peril he put you into, madam,
addressing himself to me, made me
forget myself.  I repeated, I hope, Sir, you
have forgiven him.  I wish, my dear Miss
Bidulph, said he, that the fellow were

<pb n="67"/>
guilty of no other fault but this, that I
might shew you my readiness to obey you;
but he is such an intolerable sot, that there
is no keeping him with safety.  I have
forgiven him several idle things; but as I
had determined to part with him before
this happened, I hope you will be so good
as not to insist on my retaining him.  I
could not intercede for the foolish fellow
after this; so said no more.
</p>
<p>This little incident convinces me that
Mr. Faulkland is of too warm a temper;
yet I am not alarmed at the discovery;
you know I am the very reverse; and I
hope in time, by gentle methods, in some
measure to subdue it in Mr. Faulkland.
His own good sense and good nature
must incline him to wish it corrected.
My brother says, he has often lamented
this vice of his nature to him, and said
he had taken infinite pains to get the
better of it; and had so far succeeded, that
he seldom was surprized by it, but on
very sudden and extraordinary occasions,
such as, I suppose, he looked upon this
to be, which I have related.

<pb n="68"/>
</p>
<p>We passed the day delightfully at Kensington,
and did not return to town till
late.  I think I have got cold, as we
walked a long time in the garden.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d27">
	<head><date value="1703-07-14"><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 14.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have got an ugly sore
throat: my mother insists on my being
let blood; I am afraid of alarming her
by complaining, though I had very little
rest all night.  Mr. Faulkland came early
this morning to enquire after my health:
my mother told him I was not well.
How tenderly dejected were his looks,
when I came into the room.  Sir George
made his stay to breakfast; he scarce
tasted any thing; he was quite cast down,
My brother rallied him (I thought it unseasonable)
on the chance he had the day
before of losing his wife.  Mr. Faulkland
answered, I wish I had followed the first
motion of my thoughts, and discharged
that wicked fellow a month ago.  Sir
George said, as it happened, there had
been no harm done; but he thought Mr.
Faulkland would do well to dismiss such
an insolent rogue from his service.  He

<pb n="69"/>
has saved me that trouble, said Mr.
Faulkland, he has dismissed himself;
but took care first to rob me.  To
rob you! we all repeated in the same
breath.  Yes, said Mr. Faulkland: I told
him, after I got home, that he was to
deliver up such things as he had in his
charge to my own man, as I meant to
discharge him in the morning.  He made
me no reply, for he was a sullen fellow;
but when the family were asleep, he contrived
to pick the lock of a bureau in my
dressing-room, where I sometimes keep
money.  I believe what induced him to
it was, his having seen me yesterday
morning, when I was going to ride (a
precaution which I generally use) put my
pocket-book into this place, and I suppose
he concluded there were bank notes
in it, for he took <hi rend="italic">that</hi> (I presume without
staying to examine it) and all the money
he could find besides, and very cleverly
made his escape out of a back window,
which was found open this morning.
</p>
<p>My mother lectured Mr. Faulkland a
little, for suffering a servant, whose fidelity
he was not sure of, to see where he

<pb n="70"/>
deposited his money; which, she said,
might prove a temptation to one, who
was not so ill inclined as this man.  Mr.
faulkland acknowledged it was careless in
him; but said, in his justification, he
had been accustomed to very honest
people about him, which rendered him
less suspicious.
</p>
<p>He appeared so anxious and unhappy
about my indisposition, that I affected to
make as light of it as possible; though
indeed I find myself very much out of
order.  With what a kind sorrow did he
observe my looks; sighs now-and-then
stole from him, as his eyes were fixed on
my face.  I am obliged to him, yet I
think I should be as much concerned for
<hi rend="italic">him</hi>, if he were ill.
</p>
<p>Here is a whole cargo of silks and
laces just sent in to me&mdash;Heigh-ho! I can't
look at them&mdash;I am not well&mdash;and I
have such a gauntlope to run of visiting
and racketting that the thought makes
me sicker.

<p>After a fortnight's, a dreadful
fortnight's intermission, I reassume

<pb n="71"/>
my pen.  I have often told you, Cecilia,
I was not born to be happy.  Oh! I
prophesied when I said so, though I
knew not why I said it.
</p>
<p>I will try to recollect all the circumstances
of this miserable interval, and relate
them as well as I can.  The last line
in my journal (which I have not yet ventured
to send you, as your stay at Paris is
so uncertain)informs you that I was ill.
I was let blood; but my disorder increased,
and I was in a high fever before next
morning.  I remember what my reflections
were, and am sure my apprehensions
of death were not on my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> account afflicting,
but grievously so at the thoughts
of what those should feel whom I was to
leave behind.
</p>
<p>My mother and Mr. Faulkland, I believe,
chiefly engaged my mind: but I did
not long continue capable of reflection.
The violence of my disorder deprived me of
my senses on the fourth day, and they tell
me I raved of Mr. Faulkland.  I remember
nothing, but that, in my intervals of
reason, I always saw my poor mother in

<pb n="72"/>
tears by my bedside.  I was in the utmost
danger, but it pleased God to restore me
to the ardent prayers of my dear parent.
In about ten days I began to shew some
symptoms of amendment, and inquired
how Mr. Faulkland did.  My mother
answered, he is well, my dear, and gone
out of town, but I believe will return in
a day or two.  Gone out of town, said
I, and leave me dying!  Indeed that was
not kind of Mr. Faulkland, and I shall
tell him so.  My mother was sitting on
the bedside, and had hold of my hand;
my brother was standing with his back to
the fire-place.  I observed they looked at
one another, but neither made me any
answer.  Pray, Sir George, I cried, would
you serve the woman so whom you were
so near making your wife?  My brother
was gong to reply, but my mother
frowned at him; he looked displeased,
and went out of the room.  Dear madam,
said I, there is something the matter with
Mr. Faulkland; don't keep me in suspence.
I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> there is something, which
you and my brother would conceal from

<pb n="73"/>
me.  Is Mr. Faulkland sick?  Not that I
know of, I assure you, answered my mother;
he was well yesterday, for we had
a message from him to enquire after your
health, as we have had every day, for he
is but at Richmond; and you know, if
he were in town, he could receive no other
satisfaction than hearing from you, as you
are too ill to admit of any visits. My
mother rang the bell immediately, and
asked me to take something; I saw she
wanted to turn the conversation.  My
maid Ellen came into the room, and I
asked no more questions.
</p>
<p>My mother staid with me till it was
time for her to go to rest: but avoided
mentioning Mr. Faulkland's name, or
giving me any opportunity of doing it;
for she tenderly conjured me to keep myself
quite composed, and not to talk.
The doctor assured her this night that he
thought me out of danger; and she retired
with looks of cordial delight.
</p>
<p>She was not sooner gone, than I called
Ellen to my bedside, and charged her to
tell me all she knew concerning Mr.

<pb n="74"/>
Faulkland.  The poor girl looked concerned,
and seemed to study for an answer.
Lord Bless me, madam! what should I
know of him more than my lady has told
you?  When did you see him? said I:
Not for several days, she answered.
Where is he?  At Richmond, I heard Sir
George say; but I suppose he will come
to town as soon as he hears you are well
enough to receive him.  I catched hold
of her hand; 'Ellen, I know there is
something, relative to Mr. Faulkland,
which you all want to hide from me;
don't attempt to deceive me; you may
be sure, whatever it be, I must soon
be informed of it; in the mean while,
my doubts make me very unhappy.'
</p>
<p>The good-natured girl's trouble and
confusion increased as I spoke; My dear
madam, she replied, when you are better,
my lady will tell you all: 'No, no, Ellen,
I must know it now; tell it me this minute,
or you must never expect to see
me better under such uncertainty.  What
is the <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, the frightful <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, that I am to
be told?  How you have shocked me

<pb n="75"/>
with that little word!'  I know nothing,
madam, answered Ellen, but what I gathered
from Sir George's loud angry talk
with my lady; and I should be undone if
her ladyship were to know I mentioned it
to you.  I assured her my mother should
not know it.  Why then, madam (speaking
lower) I am afraid that Mr. Faulkland
has misbehaved, or has been belied
to my lady&mdash;She stopped at this&mdash;How?
how? cry'd I eagerly; what has she heard
of him?  Something of another courtship,
she replied; but I hope it is all false&mdash;You
trifle with me&mdash;speak out, and say all you
know.  The poor creature started at my
impatience: 'I know no more, madam,
than that I heard my lady say to Sir
George, I had rather Sidney were in her
grave than married to him.  Sir George
said, But why will you not let Mr.
Faulkland justify himself, madam?  Justify
himself! my lady answered; what
can he say?  Is it not plain that
he is false to another woman?  They
talked lower; but at last Sir George
raised his voice, and said, he would
give half his estate to have the villain

<pb n="76"/>
punished;&mdash;And this, madam, I overheard
by mere accident.  Sir George
was going abroad; his linen was lying
ready for him in his dressing-room; and his man desired me to put
a stitch in one of his master's point
ruffles, which was a little ripped in the
gathering.  I had come up the back
stairs into the dressing-room, just as my
lady (who was with Sir George in the
bed chamber) said the words I first repeated;
and while I stood doing the
ruffle, I heard the rest.  There was a
great deal more said, but I could not
distinguish any thing besides, except a
word here and there, which Sir George
seemed to speak in a very angry tone.
This was the second day of your illness.
Mr. Faulkland had been here in the
morning to inquire how you did; my
lady saw him, and I thought they parted
very friendly.  I met Mr. Faulkland
coming down stairs; he looked full of
grief; my lady stood at the dining-room door, and wished him a good
morning.  About an hour after came

<pb n="77"/>
a letter directed to you; it was brought
by a porter, who said it required no
answer.  As you were too ill to read
it, I gave it to my lady; and it was
soon after this, that I heard the conversation
between Sir George and her
ladyship.  Mr. Faulkland came again
in the evening.  Sir George was not
at home; but my lady had him above
an hour in the drawing-room; and
the footman, who let him out, said,
he looked as if he were in sad trouble.
He has never been here since, but sends
constantly every day to know how you
do.  My lady ordered me, if any letters
came for you, to deliver them to
her.'  'And has there any come to me?'
No, madam, word was always sent to
Mr. Faulkland of your being so ill,
that to be sure he thought it would be
in vain for him to write to you.'
</p>
<p>This was all I could gather from the
maid.  What a night did I pass!  I scarce
closed my eyes.  Ellen lay in a field-bed
by me; she had watched several nights,
and I obliged her now to undress and go

<pb n="78"/>
into bed.  She slept soundly; how I envied
her tranquillity!  If I forgot myself
for a few minutes, my slumbers were
distracted, and I started at the recollection
of what I had already heard, and the dread
of what I had <hi rend="italic">still</hi> to hear.  Mr. Faulkland
absenting himself from the house so long;
my mother wishing me in the grave, rather
than be his wife; my brother denouncing
vengeance on the <hi rend="italic">villain!</hi>  These were the
terrible ideas that haunted me till morning.
What can he have done? I cried
aloud several times.  I summoned to my
aid all the fortitude I was mistress of, and
resolved not to sink under the calamity,
be it of what nature it would.
</p>
<p>My mother, ever kind and tender,
came early the next morning into my
room.  She inquired after my health, and
looked as if she <hi rend="italic">pitied</hi> me.  I was ready
to cry at her compassionate glances; they
mortified me, but I was determined not
to let her perceive it.  I told her I was
much better; and, what is surprizing, I
was really so, notwithstanding the uneasy
state of my mind.  She talked of indifferent

<pb n="79"/>
things, and said, she hoped I should
soon be able to go into the country for a
few days, to recover a little strength.  I
answered, I hope so too, madam.  We
were both silent for a while; my mother
had her indulgent eyes fixed upon me;
mine were cast down: at last I resolved to
speak out.  Madam, said I, looking
stedfastly at her, what is the cause of
your coldness towards Mr. Faulkland?
'Tis in vain for you to hide it longer;
you say he is <hi rend="italic">well</hi>, and gone out of town.
If he has shewn any slight towards me,
tell me so at once; and do not entertain
so mean an opinion of your daughter, as
to suppose she cannot bear the news.
Your tenderness, I see, would conceal
<hi rend="italic">something</hi> from me; but believe me, madam,
I am prepared for the worst.
</p>
<p>My dear, replied my mother, it gives
me great pleasure to hear you say so.  I
pray God preserve my child, and grant
her a better lot than she could hope for in
a union with Mr. Faulkland.  What has
he done, madam?  My dearest Sidney, she
answered, this is the first trial you have

<pb n="80"/>
ever had of your patience; but I have no
doubt that your goodness and discretion
will teach you to act as becomes your character.
</p>
<p>I did not intend to have spoken to you
on the subject, till you were better able to
bear the knowlege of what I am going to
acquaint you with; but your prudence, I
think, makes you equal to every thing;
and I hope your health will not be endangered
by the discovery of Mr. Faulkland's
baseness.  (What a dreadful preface!)
</p>
<p>The day after you were taken ill, a
letter, directed to you, was brought hither
by a porter, which your maid (very discretely)
delivered to me.  As you were not
in a condition to read it yourself, I thought
proper to open it.  The cover contained
a few lines addressed to you; and in it was
inclosed a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland.
Good God, added she, taking the
papers out of her pocket, how little reliance
ought we to have on a fair outside!

<pb n="81"/>
</p>
<p>Here are the letters; read what is in
the cover first.  I did so; it was ill writ,
and worse spelt.  These were the contents.
</p><div4 type="epistle" id="d29">

<opener>Madam,
</opener>
<p>I hear you are soon to be married to
Mr. Faulkland; but as I think it a
great pity that so virtuous a young
lady should be thrown away, this is
to inform you, that he does not deserve
you.
</p>
<p>The inclosed letter, wrote to him by a
fine and beautiful young lady that he
decoyed, shews you how false he is.
When you tax him with it, he will know
from whence you got your information;
but let him deny it if he can.

<div4 type="note" id="d30"><p>The letter to Mr. Faulkland, in a very
pretty female hand, and the date but a

</head>
<p>'Oh! Mr. Faulkland, I am the most
unfortunate woman in the world!  Fatal
have you been to me, and I am undone
for ever.&mdash;I was in hopes that our mutual
fault might have been concealed; for,
while we staid at Bath, I kept my aunt
intirely ignorant of what passed between
us, though she often pressed me to confess
the truth; but it can now no longer be
concealed.  I am but too sensibly reminded
of the unhappy consequences of my
own weakness, and your ungoverned
(would I could call it) love.  I never
meat to trouble you with complaints;
but my present condition calls loudly for
your compassion.  Are you then really
going to be married?  There wants but
this to complete my destruction!  Oh! Sir,
before it is too late, take pity on me!  I
dare not continue in the house with my
uncle much longer.  My aunt says, that,
when my affliction becomes so conspicuous
as not to be any longer hid, she will
form a pretence, on account of my health,
for me to be absent for some months, under

<pb n="83"/>
colour of going to Bath, or to London,
for better advice than I can have
here.  But what will this avail me?  I
have no relations, no friends, nor acquaintance,
that I can trust with the secret
of my miserable situation.  To whom
then can I fly, but to you, the cause of all
my sorrow?  I beseech you, for heaven's
sake, write to me, and tell me, if indeed
you are going to give yourself away for
ever!  If you are, your intended bride,
perhaps may have no other advantage of
me, but what you in an evil hour deprived
me of.  Write to me, dear, though cruel,
as you are; and think of some place of
refuge for your unhappy</p>

<div4 type="section" id="d32">
<p>When I had read these letters, my mother
asked me, what I thought of Mr.
Faulkland?  Indeed, I was so astonished,
that I scarce knew what answer to make;
but replied, Madam, are you satisfied
that this letter is not forged, with a design
to injure Mr. Faulkland?  Ah! my dear,
said she, I am sorry you strive to catch at

<pb n="84"/>
so slender a twig; you may be sure I am
but too well convinced that the letter is
genuine, or you should never have had
a moment's uneasiness by the knowledge of
it.  Mr. Faulkland himself does not deny
it, and it is with his permission that I
kept it.  I promised to return it, but desired
leave to retain it for a few days.  He
could not refuse me this, though he might
easily imagine I designed to shew it to
you.  That, indeed, was my intention, when
I desired to keep it a little while in my
hands, and I did so, that I might have
your judgment on the letter itself, as well
as fully to justify my own proceedings in
what I have done.  Ah! dear madam,
cry'd I, scarce knowing what I said, I
rely on your maternal goodness; I am
sure you have done what is proper.  Yet
has Mr. Faulkland nothing to say for
himself?&mdash;But I will ask no more
questions&mdash;I know too much already&mdash;
My love, said my mother, you have a
right to know every thing relative to
this affair.
</p>
<p>I shewed the letters to your brother, as

<pb n="85"/>
soon as I received them.  Sir George at
first seemed quite confounded, but afterwards,
to my very great surprize, he
smiled and said, he knew of that foolish
business before.  I asked him if he knew
of it before, how he could answer it to
his honour, his conscience, or the love
he ought to bear his sister, not to divulge
it immediately?  Why, said he, I assure
you it is a trivial affair, that ought not to
make you uneasy.
</p>
<p>What, George! answered I, a trivial
matter for a man to ruin a fine young
lady, forsake her, and date to involve an
innocent creature in his crimes!  Do you
call this a <hi rend="italic">trivial</hi> affair?  If you knew the
circumstances, said he, you would not view
it in so disadvantageous a light.  Faulkland
certainly gained the affections of a
young lady, though without seeking to
do so; he never courted her, never attempted
to please her, much less to win
her heart, and least of all to ruin her
virtue.  I know that is an action he is not
capable of committing.  How comes it
to pass then that he <hi rend="italic">did</hi> so, said I, interrupting

<pb n="86"/>
him?  Why, the girl was silly,
and she was thrown in his way by a vile
designing woman that had the care of her.
'And was he (again stopping him) to
take advantage of her folly, and join
with that <hi rend="italic">vile designing</hi> woman, to destroy
a poor young creature's honour?'
The <hi rend="italic">best</hi> men, said he confidently, may
fall into an error; and if you expect to
find a man intirely free from them, you
look for what is not possible in human
nature.
</p>
<p>I may expect to find a man without
flagrant crimes to answer for, I hope; and
I believe I spoke it with warmth.  Do
you call <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one, madam? said he, with
still more assurance: I hope Sidney will
not be such a chit as to think in this
manner, when she comes to hear the affair
explained.  I really grew down-right
angry, and could not forbear saying, I
would rather see you married to your
grave than to such a man.  Your brother
then begged I would hear Mr. Faulkland
justified, and be a little cool till that was
done.  I told him there was a terrible

<pb n="87"/>
fact alledged, of which I could not conceive
it possible for him to acquit himself.
</p>
<p>George said, he had a letter to shew me
on the subject, which he had received
from Mr. Faulkland while he was at
Bath, and which he was sure would
convince me, that the whole affair was
so trifling, it ought by no means to be
objected to Mr. Faulkland, nor, in his
opinion, even mentioned to him.
</p>
<p>I told him, I was sorry to find that he
and I thought so differently; for that I
was determined to speak to Mr. Faulkland
immediately about it, and, if he
could not satisfy me intirely on the score
of the injured lady, that he must never
think of Sidney more.
</p>
<p>Your brother said, that the letter which
was sent to you had come from the revengeful
dog who had robbed his master,
and that he would give half his estate to
have the villain punished as he deserved.
Mr. Faulkland, it seems, had told him
this himself.  The fellow found it in the
pocket-book which he had taken out of
the escrutore, and his disappointment

<pb n="88"/>
perhaps, at not getting a better booty
(for he found but twenty moidores besides)
joined to his malice against his master,
incited him to make the use he did
of this letter.  Now, continued my mother,
though the fellow is undoubtedly a
vile creature, yet, my dear, I think <hi rend="italic">we</hi>
are obliged to him for this discovery,
providentially as it has come, to save
you from what, in my opinion, would
be the worst of misfortunes.
</p>
<p>The loss of this letter had alarmed
Mr. Faulkland so much, that he put an
advertisement into the papers next day,
worded in so particular a manner, as shewed
how very fearful he was of that letter's
coming to light; for, no doubt, he suspected
the man might make a dangerous
use of it.  The advertisement said, that if
the servant, who had absconded from his
master's house in St. James's Square the
night before, would restore the papers
which he took with him, they should be
received without any questions being
asked, and a reward of twenty guineas
paid to any person who should bring them

<pb n="89"/>
back.  The advertisement, which, to be
sure, the fellow either did not see at all, or
had not time enough to avail himself of
it, shews you to what sad resources people
are driven, who, having done unwarrantable
actions, are often in the power
of the lowest wretches.  I own this circumstance
gave me a very ill impression
of Mr. Faulkland.  Your brother says,
he remembers this man was one of the servants
he took with him to Bath, and, without
doubt, he knew of his amour.  The
advertisement has since been changed, by
Sir George's advice.  I find the man is
named, his person described, and a reward
of fifty pounds offered for the apprehending
him; but I take it for granted
he has got out of reach.
</p>
<p>Though this little digression was very
pertinent, I was impatient to know what
had passed between my mother and Mr.
Faulkland on the fatal subject, and could
not forbear asking her.
</p>
<p>I shall tell you, said she, in order.
Your brother and I had some farther altercations;
and indeed, my dear, it amazes

<pb n="90"/>
me to find, that a young man, educated
as Sir George was, in the early part of
life, in the strictest principles of virtue,
and the son of parents, who, thank God,
always gave him the best example, should
have so far deviated from the sober paths
he was brought up in, as to treat the most
glaring vices with a levity that shocked
me.  But, I suppose, the company he kept
abroad, among whom this hypocrite
Faulkland was his chief, has quite perverted
him.  He gave me the letter to
read, which he had received from his friend
whilst he was at Bath; and which, he said,
was to convince me that it was such a
<hi rend="italic">trifling</hi> affair, that we ought not to take
the least notice of it.  And all his reason
for this was, truly, because that loose
man treats the subject as lightly as he
does.  I am afraid Sir George is no better
than himself, or he would not have
ventured to make him the confident of
his wild amours; and that at a time too
when he was encouraged to address you.
He tells him of a very pretty young lady
(innocent he says too) that he got acquainted

<pb n="91"/>
with, who came to Bath under
the care of an aunt and uncle; he talks
some idle stuff of avoiding her, when he
found she like him, and that the aunt
(wicked woman!) contrived to leave them
together one evening, when, I understand,
the poor young creature fell into the snare
that was prepared for her.  For, would
you believe it, my dear, the monstrous
libertine, notwithstanding his pretences,
owned that he had paid a price for the
girl to her aunt.  The betrayed creature
herself knew not of this.
</p>
<p>I own I had not patience to read the
letter through.  To say the truth, I but
run my eye in a cursory manner over it; I
was afraid of meeting, at every line, something
offensive to decency.  And <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was
the account, which, in your brother's
opinion, was intirely to exculpate Mr.
Faulkland.  I think I never was so angry.
I threw the letter to George with indignation,
telling him, I was ashamed to find,
that he, after knowing an incident of this
kind, had so little regard to the honour
of his sister, as to promote a marriage between

<pb n="92"/>
her and such a rake.  He answered,
if I kept you unmarried till I found such
a man as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should <hi rend="italic">not</hi> call a rake, you
were likely to live and die a maid.  That
for his part, he was very sorry, as well
for Mr. Faulkland's sake as yours, he had
ever proposed an union, which he found
was likely to be overthrown by unseasonable
scruples.  And the gentleman, in a
violent passion, flung out of the room,
without deigning even to take up the
letter, which had fallen on the floor.
</p>
<p>I presume he went directly to his friend
Faulkland, and told him all that had
passed; for the plausible man came to me
in the evening, and with looks, full of
pretended sorrow, but <hi rend="italic">real</hi> guilt, begged
I would hear him on the subject of a letter
which, he said, he found had unfortunately
prejudiced me against him.  To be sure
he was prepared, and had, with George's
help, contrived an artful story to impose
on me.  He took me unawares; but I
was resolved not to give him the advantage
or arguments, but proceed to ask him
a few plain questions.  I therefore cut

<pb n="93"/>
him short at once, by saying, Mr. Faulkland,
I am extremely concerned and
shocked at what has happened; I will
say but a few words to you; and desire
to hear nothing more than answers to
my questions: he bowed, and remained
silent.
</p>
<p>I then asked him, taking the young
lady's letter out of my pocket, whether that
was from the same person, of whom he
had written an account to my son whilst
he was at Bath?  He answered, It is,
madam; and I hoped from that letter,
which I find Sir George has shewn you,
you would be induced to believe that I
never formed a thought of injuring that
young lady, till some unfortunate circumstances
combined, and suddenly surprized
me into the commission of a fault
that has made us both unhappy.  Sir,
said I, I don't pretend to know people's
hearts, I can only judge of them from
their actions.  You acknowlege that she
was a fine young woman, and you believe
innocent: What excuse can you offer for
being her destroyer?  Dear madam, don't

<pb n="94"/>
use so severe an expression&mdash;Sir, I can
use no other: How can you extenuate
the fault, by which you merit so severe an
appellation?  To a lady of your rigid delicacy,
madam, said he, perhaps what
youth could offer, in extenuation of the
fault, might appear but a weak plea: yet
'tis most certain, that I was surprized into
the fatal error: I ;am under no promises,
no ties, no engagements whatsoever
to the lady.  No ties, Sir! (interrupting
him) Is your own honour no tie
upon you, supposing you free from any
other obligation?  You see the Consequence
of this fatal error, as you call it: here is
a young person, of fashion, perhaps (I
don't inquire who she is, but she seems to
have had no mean education) who is likely
to bring a child into the world, to the
disgrace of herself and her family.  ON
you, Sir, she charges her dishonour, and
mentions your marrying another, as the
blow which is to complete her ruin.  Mr.
Faulkland, is not all this truth?  Be so good
as to give me a direct answer.  Madam,
I cannot deny it; you have the proof of

<pb n="95"/>
it in your hands: from all that appears
to you, I am indeed very blameable; nay,
I do not pretend to vindicate my folly;
but, madam, do not aggravate my fault
in your own thoughts, by considering the
affair in a more unfavourable light than
what even her letter puts it.  I conjure
you, madam, to suffer Sir George to be
my advocate on this occasion; he is acquainted
with every particular of the
transaction, and can give you a detail that
I will not presume to do.  Be pleased,
Sir, replied I, to tell me what you mean
to do in regard to this lady?  I mean to
do all that I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> do, answered he; I shall
provide a place of retreat for her, where
she will meet with the utmost care, tenderness,
and respect; and where she may
continue with privacy till she is in a condition
to return home again to her friends.
You may be sure, madam, as to the rest,
I shall acquit myself consistently with honour.
That is as much as to say, Sir,
said I, that you will take care of the maintenance
of your poor babe.  He looked
as if he had a mind to smile, forward

<pb n="96"/>
man! but constrained it.  Doubtless, madam,
I shall do all that is now in my power to do,
in every circumstance relating
to her.
</p>
<p>I felt myself exceedingly displeased with
him; I was so disappointed in my opinion
of him, that it increased my resentment.
Sir, I proceeded, I must inform you, that
there is as much <hi rend="italic">now</hi> in your power as
ever there was.  You are still unmarried;
the way is open to you to repair the mischief
you have done: I will never bring
down the curses of an injured maid upon
my daughter's head, nor purchase her
worldly prosperity at the expence of the
shame and sorrow of another woman, for
aught I know, as well born, as tenderly
bred, and, till she knew you, perhaps as
innocent as herself.  For heaven's sake,
madam! he cry'd, don't, don't, I beseech
you, pronounce my fate so hastily.&mdash;
You must pardon me, Sir, said I, if I
beg to hear no more on this subject.  Sir
George has already said every thing you
could expect of your friend to say in your
justification, and more than became him

<pb n="97"/>
to utter.  All I can find by either you or
him, is, that you think the loss of honour
to a young woman is a trifle, which
a man is not obliged to repair, because
truly he did not <hi rend="italic">promise</hi> to do so.  This
young creature, I understand, is a gentlewoman,
very charming in her person, by
your own account; one who loves you tenderly,
and will shortly make you a father.
Is not all this so?  I grant, it, madam, said
the criminal.  Then, Sir, what reason can
you urge in your conscience for not doing
her justice?  None&mdash;but your own
inconstant inclinations, which happen now
to be better pleased with another woman,
whom, perhaps, you might forsake in a
few months.
</p>
<p>I cannot pretend to repeat to you all he
said upon this last article: words of course
you may be sure.  He intreated, over and
over again, that I would permit Sir
George to plead for him.  I told him, that
after the facts he had granted, it was impossible
that either he or Sir George could
make the affair better; that I was very
sorry to find myself disappointed in a person
of whom I had conceived so high an

<pb n="98"/>
opinion; and added, that as your illness
made it very improper to let you know
any thing of the matter for the present, I
should take it as a favour if he would permit
me to retain the lady's letter to him
for a few days, or till you were in a condition
to have the matter broke to you.
In the mean while, I requested that he
would dispense with my receiving any
more visits from him.
</p>
<p>He said some frantic things (for the
man seems of a violent temper); but finding
me peremptory, took his leave with
respect.
</p>
<p>I understand from Sir George, that he
flew directly down to Richmond, to a
little house he has there, where he has remained
ever since; but sends every day
to enquire after your health.  Sir George,
I am sure, sees him often; for he frequently
goes out early in the morning,
and stays abroad till night.  The increase
of your illness, from the time I received
the last visit from Mr. Faulkland, to such
a degree as to alarm us for your life, I
suppose, prevented your brother from reassuming
the subject; though I can perceive

<pb n="99"/>
he is full of anger and vexation
on the occasion.  You are now, my dear,
God be praised, in a hopeful way of recovery,
and I expect that George (who has,
by espousing this man's interests so warmly,
very much offended me) that George, I
say, will renew his solicitations in his favour.
What do you say, my child?  I should
be glad to know your thoughts, with regard
to the part I have acted, as well as
with respect to Mr. Faulkland's conduct.
</p>
<p>Shall I own my weakness to you, my
dear Cecilia?  I was ready to melt into
tears; my spirits, exhausted by sickness,
were not proof against this unexpected
blow; a heavy sigh burst from my heart,
that gave me a little relief.  You know
my mother is rigid in her notions of virtue;
and I was determined to shew her
that I would endeavour to imitate her.  I
therefore suppressed the swelling passion
in my breast, and, with as much composure
as I could assume, told her, I thought she
acted as became her; and that, with regard
to Mr. Faulkland, my opinion of
his conduct was such, that I never desired
to see him more.  This answer, dictated

<pb n="124"/>
perhaps by female pride (for I will not
answer for the feelings of my heart at that
instant) was so agreeable to my mother,
that she threw her arms about my neck,
and kissed me several times; blessing, and
calling me by the most endearing names
]at every interval.  Her tenderness overcame
me; or, to deal with sincerity, I
believe I was willing to make it an excuse
for weeping.  Oh! my dear mother, cry'd
I, I have need of your indulgence; but
indeed your goodness quite overpowers
me.  My dear love, said she, you deserve
it all, and more than it is in your mother's
power to shew you.  What a blessed escape
have you had, my sweet child, of that
wild man!  Little did I think, my
Sidney, when I told you the story of my
first disappointment, that a case so parallel
would soon be your own.  With
respect to you and me indeed, the incidents
are nearly alike; but there is a wide difference
between the two men.  My lover
had the grace to repent, and would have
returned to his first engagements, if a
dreadful malady had not overtaken him;
but this graceless Faulkland persists in his

<pb n="101"/>
infidelity, and would make you as culpable
as himself.  I own to you daughter,
that the recollection of that melancholy
event which happened to me, has given
me a sort of horror at the very thoughts of
an union between you and Mr. Faulkland.
You remember the sad consequences
which I related to you of an infidelity
of this kind; the poor forsaken
woman died of grief, and the dishonest
lover ran mad.  Think of this, my child,
and let in encourage you to banish such an
unworthy man from your heart.  I
was afraid your regard for him might
make this a difficult task; but I rejoice
to find your virtue is stronger than your
passion.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> loved as well as you, but I
overcame it when I found it a duty to do
so; and I see your mother's example is not
lost upon you.
</p>
<p>The honest pride that my mother endeavoured
to inspire me with, had a good
effect, and kept up my spirits for a time.
</p>
<p>She told me, she was sure that Sir George
would quarrel with us both, when we came
to talk upon the subject of the marriage;

<pb n="102"/>
but she was entirely easy as to that, now
she knew that <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sentiments corresponded
with her own.
</p>
<p>You know my mother has ever been
despotic in her government of me; and
had I even been inclined to dissent from
her judgment in a matter of this importance,
it would have been to no purpose;
but this was really far from my thoughts.
</p>
<p>I was as much disgusted with Mr.
Faulkland as she was, and as heartily
pitied the unhappy young creature whom
he had undone.
</p>
<p>You may recollect, my dear, that my
mother, tho' strictly nice in every particular,
has a sort of partiality to her own
sex, and where there is the least room for
it, throws the whole of the blame upon
the <hi rend="italic">man's</hi> side; who, from her own early
prepossessions, she is always inclined to
think are deceivers of women.  I am not
surprized at this bias in her; her early
disappointment, with the attending circumstances,
gave her this impression.
She is warm, and sometimes <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi>, in her
attachments; and yet it is not always difficult

<pb n="103"/>
to turn her from them.  The integrity
of her own heart makes her liable
to be imposed on by a plausible outside;
and yet the dear good woman takes a sort
of pride in her sagacity.  She had admired
and esteemed Mr. Faulkland prodigiously;
her vexation was the greater,
in finding her expectations disappointed;
and could I have been so unjust to the
pretensions of another, or so indelicate in
regard to myself, as to have overlooked
Mr. Faulkland's fault, I knew my mother
would be inflexible.  I therefore resolved
in earnest to banish him from my thoughts.
I found my mother was mightily pleased
with her own management of the conversation
she had held with Mr. Faulkland.
I think I talked pretty <hi rend="italic">roundly</hi> to him, said
she; but there was no other way; he is
an artful man, and I was resolved not to
let him wind me about.  He would make
a merit of having <hi rend="italic">formed no designs</hi> upon
the young lady; why, possibly, he did
not, till he found the poor soul was so
smitten with him, that he thought she
would be an easy prey.  Sir George impudently

<pb n="104"/>
insinuated, that a man <hi rend="italic">must</hi> not
reject a lady upon these occasions.  I was
ashamed to hint to Mr. Faulkland at the
circumstance of his having actually paid a
price for the girl; it was too gross; and
I think, had I mentioned it, must have
struck him dumb: though very likely he
might have had some subterfuge, even for
that aggravating part of the story.
</p>
<p>How I am shock'd, my Cecilia, to
think of this!  I was glad my mother had
spared his confusion on this particular;
for though probably, as she observed,
he had come prepared with some evasion
to this charge, yet what a mean figure
must a man make, who is reduced to disingenuous
shifts, to excuse or palliate an
action, despicable as well as wicked!
</p>
<p>My brother came in, during our discourse,
to ask me how I did.  My mother
answered his question before I had
time to speak.  She is pretty well, thank
God! and not likely to break her heart,
though she <hi rend="italic">knows</hi> your friend Mr. Faulkland's
story (and she spoke in scornfully).
My brother said, Sidney, Are <hi rend="italic">you</hi> as

<pb n="105"/>
averse to Mr. Faulkland as my mother
is?  I replied, Brother, I wonder you can
ask me that question, after what you have
been just now told.  I always said, answered
he, that you did not know the
value of the man, and now I am convinced
of it.  I wish he had never seen
you!  I wish so too, said I.  Sir George
walked about the room, and seemed vexed
to death.  For heaven's sake, madam,
(turning to my mother) now my sister is
tolerably recovered, suffer her to see Mr.
Faulkland; let her hear what he has to
say in his own vindication: I think you
may trust to her honour, and her discretion;
and if the affair appears to her in
so heinous a light as it does to you, I
will be contented to give Mr. Faulkland
up; but don't shut your own ears, and
your daughter's too, against conviction.
</p>
<p>Sir, you are disrespectful, said my
mother angrily. Dear brother, I cry'd
I beg you will spare me on this subject;
my mother <hi rend="italic">has</hi> given me leave to judge
for myself; she has repeated all that you
have said, and all that Mr. Faulkland has

<pb n="106"/>
been able to urge on the occasion; and I
am sorry to tell you, that I think myself
bound never to have any farther correspondence
with him; therefore you must
excuse me for not seeing him.  And so
the match is broke off, cry'd Sir George.
<hi rend="italic">It is</hi>, said my mother peremptorily.  It
is, echoed I faintly.  Why then, replied
Sir George (and he swore), you will never
get such another whilst you live.  A
pretty figure you'll make in the world,
when you give it for a reason that you
refused <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a man, after every thing was
concluded upon, because truly you found
that he had had an intrigue!  Why, Sidney,
you'll be so laugh'd at!  He addressed
himself to me, though I knew he
meant the reproof for my mother.  Sir,
answered she, neither your sister nor I
shall trouble ourselves much about the
opinion of people who <hi rend="italic">can</hi> laugh at such
things.  You may put the matter into as
ridiculous a light as you please; but this
was no common intrigue; you <hi rend="italic">know</hi> it
was not, however you may affect to speak
of it.  I don't suppose <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of you are

<pb n="107"/>
<hi rend="italic">saints</hi>, but, I trust in Heaven, some are
better than others.  Oh! madam, madam,
said my brother, if you knew the world
as well as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do, you would think that Mr.
Faulkland is one of the best.  God forbid!
my mother answered coolly.  Well,
well, madam, cry'd Sir George, I see it
is to no purpose to argue; there are many
families of more consequence than ours,
and ten times the fortune, that will be very
proud of Faulkland's alliance; and will
hardly make it an objection to him, that
he was led into a foolish scrape by the
wickedness of one woman, and the folly
of another.  If you make my sister wait
for a husband, till you find a man who
never offended in that way, I think mother,
you had better take a little boy
from his nurse, breed him up under your
own eye, and by the time Sidney is a
good motherly gentlewoman, you may
give her the baby to make a play-thing
of.  For my own part, I am heartily
sorry I ever interfered.&mdash;People of such
nice scruples had better chuse for themselves;
but I cannot help thinking, that

<pb n="108"/>
both Faulkland and I are very ill used.
I told you (said my mother to me) how
he would behave.  Sir George, I desire
you will not distress your sister thus.  (She
saw me sadly cast down: I was ill and
weak): if you have no respect for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, have
a little tenderness for her.&mdash;I beg your
pardon, child, said he, I did not mean
to distress you, I pity <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, indeed Sidney.
I could have cry'd at his using that expression,
it humbles one so.  Madam (to
my mother), you shall be troubled no farther
by my friend or myself; all I shall
say is this, that whenever my sister gets
a husband of your ladyship's chusing, I
wish he may have half the worth of the
poor rejected Faulkland.
</p>
<p>My brother left the room with these
words.  My mother was downright in a
passion, but soon cooled on his withdrawing.
</p>
<p>My spirits were quite fatigued; and my
mother left me, that I might take a little
rest.
</p>
<p>What a strange alteration have a few
days produced! our domestic peace broke

<pb n="109"/>
in upon by the unlucky difference between
my mother and my brother.  My near
prospect of&mdash;of&mdash;oh! let me be
ingenuous, and say Happiness, vanished&mdash;
Poor Mr. Faulkland!  <hi rend="italic">Poor</hi> do I call him?
for shame, Sidney&mdash;but let the word go;
I will not blot it.  Mr. Faulkland forbid
the house, myself harrassed by a cruel disorder,
and hardly able to crawl out of
bed.  All this has fallen on me within
these last fourteen black days.  Then I dread
the going abroad, or seeing company,
I shall look so silly; for the intended
wedding began to be talked of;&mdash;and the
curiosity of people to know the cause of
it's being broke off&mdash;What wild guesses
will be made by some, and what lies invented
by others!  Then the ill-natured mirth of
one half of the girls of my acquaintance,
and the <hi rend="italic">as</hi> provoking condolements of the
other half&mdash;I am fretted at the thoughts
of it&mdash;but it cannot be helped; I must
bear it all&mdash;I wish I were well enough to
get into the country, to be out of the reach
of such impertinence.
</p>
<p>I long to know who this ill-fated girl

<pb n="110"/>
is, that has been the cause of all this.  <hi rend="italic">A
gentlewoman, and very pretty; one that loves
Mr. Faulkland, and will shortly make him
a parent.</hi>  Thus my mother described her
to Mr. Faulkland, and he assented to it.
Oh! fie, fie, Mr. Faulkland, how could
you be so cruel to <hi rend="italic">her?</hi>  How could you
use <hi rend="italic">me</hi> so ill? and Sir George knew of all
this, and makes light of it! it is a strange
story!  My mother is severe in her virtue,
but she is in the right&mdash;My brother
would sacrifice every consideration to
aggrandize his family&mdash;To make a purchase
of the unhappy creature, and that
without her knowledge too, it is horrid!
Away, away from my thoughts, thou
vile intruder&mdash;Return to your Bath mistress,
she has a better right to you than
I have; she implores your pity; she has
no refuge but you;a nd she may be every
way preferable to me&mdash;I wish I knew
her name, but what is it to me; <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> will
never be Faulkland, <hi rend="italic">hers</hi> ought.  Perhaps
Mr. Faulkland may be induced to
marry her, when he sees her in her present
interesting situation.  He says he will

<pb n="111"/>
provide a retreat for her; to be sure he
will have the compassion to visit her: and
then who knows what may happen?  If I
know my own heart, I think I do most
sincerely wish he may make her his wife;
but then I would not chuse to have it
known suddenly; that might look as if he
forsook me for her.  <hi rend="italic">That</hi>, I own, would
a little hurt my pride.  I wish not the
truth to be known, for mr. Faulkland's
sake; but then I should not like to have a
slur thrown on me.
</p>
<p>I will add no more to this, but send
the packet off at all events; I think I
will find you at Paris.

<p>My health promises to
return: my mother praises me, and calls
me a Heroine.  I begin to fancy myself
one: our pride sometimes stands in the
place of virtue.
</p>
<p>Sir George went to Richmond yesterday.
We have scarce seen him since the
tift he had with us the other day.  What
strange creatures these men are, even the
best of them! and how light they make of

<pb n="112"/>
faults in one another, that shock us but
to think of!
</p>
<p>My mother takes his behaviour very
ill: he staid all night with his friend, and
returned to town this morning: he only
looked into my room, to ask me how I
did: my mother was sitting with me.  I
believe that hindered him from coming
in; for he looked as if he wanted to speak
to me.  He bowed to my mother, but
said not a word; he went abroad again as
soon as he was dressed, and did not come
in till late.  I fear his conduct will oblige
us to separate; for my mother will not
brook any liberties to be taken with her:
she hinted as much, and said she believed
Sir George was tired of living regularly.
</p>
<p>She anticipated the request I intended
to make to her, of letting me go out of
town; for she said, as soon as I was able,
I should remove into the country for a
while.  Sidney Castle is too long a journey
for me at present to think of undertaking,
and she talks of going into Essex,
on a visit to Lady Grimston, which we
have long promised her.  I shall like this

<pb n="113"/>
better than going down to Wiltshire, where
the want of my Cecilia would make my
old abode a melancholy place, especially
at this juncture.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d34">
	<head><date value="1703-08-04"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 4.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Sir George continues
sullen and cold to us: he never has had
an opportunity of saying any thing particular
to me since the day he said so
much.  My mother scarce ever leaves me;
he seems nettled at this.  I believe he
would endeavour to work on <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, as he
knows the attempt would be vain in regard
to <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.  As I am now well enough
to receive the visits of our intimate acquaintance,
I am never without company.
I am really in pretty good spirits, and bear
my disappointment (as I told you I
would) very handsomely.  I never hear
Mr. Faulkland's name mentioned, no more
than if such a man did not exist.  We
are to set out for lady Grimston's house
on Tuesday; it is but twenty miles from
London; and I am already strong enough
to bear a longer journey.
</p>
<p>My mother told Sir George, that if he

<pb n="114"/>
liked it, the house we are now in was at
his service during her time of it, of which
there are some months to come; for she
said, she meant to go directly home from
Essex.  Sir George thanked her, but did
not say whether he would accept of her
offer or not.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d35">
	<head><date value="1703-08-05"><hi rend="italic">August 5.</hi>&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have been obliged to turn
away my poor Ellen.  She was so imprudent
as to receive a letter for me from
Mr. Faulkland's man, contrary to my
mother's express commands.  She brought
it to me, and I gave it to my mother unopened;
who put it directly into the fire
without reading it, and told me it would
oblige her, if I would part with the servant
who had presumed to take it after her
prohibition.  I instantly obeyed, and have
just discharged her.  I should have a sad
loss of her, only I am in hopes of having
her place well supplied by an old acquaintance
and play-fellow of ours, poor
Patty Main; her father is dead, and she
is obliged to go to service, for he has left
a widow with six children.  The eldest

<pb n="115"/>
son, you remember, served his time to his
father, and is just now setting out in
business; but a young surgeon in a country
town must take some time to establish
himself; though he is a very worthy youth,
and I hear clever in his profession.
</p>
<p>Patty came to town last week with a
lady from our neighbourhood, who applied
to my mother to recommend the
girl to wait on some person of fashion.
My mother has been looking out for a
suitable place for her; but she told me today,
she thought I could not do better
than take her to myself; I shall be very
glad to have her, for she is an amiable
young woman.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d36">
	<head><date value="1703-08-06"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 6.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>We go out of town at
seven o'clock to-morrow morning, as we
are to dine at Grimston-hall, and purpose
going at our leisure.  I will steal a few
minutes from sleep, though it is now very
late, to give you a short scene which passed
in my chamber about an hour ago.
</p>
<p>Sir George (who, according to his late
custom, had been abroad all day) came

<pb n="116"/>
into my room, where my mother and I
were sitting together.  He asked us, Did
we hold our purpose of going out of town
next day?  Yes, certainly, my mother
said.  And you intend going from lady
Grimston's to Sidney Castle?  We do.
Then, madam (to my mother), as it is the
last trouble you are likely to have from
Mr. Faulkland, I hope you will not refuse
to read this letter, which he has sent
you; and he took one out of his pocket,
and presented it to her.  She did not
make an offer to receive it, but answered,
Sir George, it is to no purpose for Mr.
Faulkland to sollicit me; you know I
don't easily alter my resolutions when
once they are fixed: he has given himself
an unnecessary trouble; pray excuse me:
it was not handsome of him to write to
my daughter, after he knew my sentiments.
You need not be afraid of fresh
sollicitations, madam, said my brother;
I knew enough of your <hi rend="italic">firmness</hi> (and he
spoke the word firmness reluctantly, as if
he would rather have used another, perhaps
less respectful term); I knew enough

<pb n="117"/>
to assure Faulkland there was not the least
hope left for him; and though I do not
know the subject of that letter, I can
venture to assure you, it is not intended
to move you in favour of his pretensions:
this he declared to me, before I would take
the letter from him; but what puts it past
doubt, is, that he set out this very evening
from London, in order to embark
for Germany.  I could not help breathing
a sign when Sir George said this; but no
body heard me.  He still held the letter
in his hand, and again offered it to my
mother; You need not be afraid of it,
madam; I presume it may be no more
than to take a civil leave of you.  I wish
him well, said my mother, taking the
letter; if that be all, what he says may
keep cold; and she put it into her pocket
without opening.
</p>
<p>This being the eve of our journey,
some little domestic matters, which my
mother had to settle, called her out of the
room.  Sir George took that opportunity
to ask me, whether my mother had shewed
me the letter which he had received

<pb n="118"/>
from Mr. Faulkland while he was at Bath,
relative to that cursed affair, as he called
it.  I told him, my mother had repeated
great part of the contents of it to me;
and that the principal observation she had
made, was not favourable to <hi rend="italic">him</hi>, on account
of his being made the confidant of
such an affair.
</p>
<p>I am very sorry for your sake, Sidney,
said he, that our mother is of so inflexible
a temper; you have lost by it, what you
will have reason to regret as long as you
live.  Such amazing obstinacy! such
unaccountable perverseness!  I do not
want to shake your filial obedience; but I,
for my own part, think that nothing but
infatuation can account for your mother's
conduct&mdash;Does she want a man without
passions?  Or have you filled your
head with such chimaerical notions as to&mdash;
I interrupted him (for my brother is not
always nice in his choice of words);&mdash;Dear
Sir George, say no more; I am very well
contented as I am.  I will not increase
your uneasiness, said he, by telling you
what Faulkland has suffered on this occasion.

<pb n="119"/>
If ever love was carried to adoration,
it was in the breast of that generous,
charming fellow&mdash;but you have lost
him&mdash;and I have lost him; thanks to my
wise scrupulous mother for that.  I begged
of him to drop the subject.  My mother
came in to us again.  Sir George bid
us good night, and wished us a good
journey.  The parting was cool enough.
I am glad, however, there is not a total
rupture.  I believe he will continue in our
house in town for a time, at least.
</p>
<p>Patty Main, who gladly accepted of the
offer of my service, came home to me
this evening.  She is grown very tall and
genteel.  I hardly know how to treat her
as a servant; but the good girl is so humble,
that she does all in her power to make
me forget that I ever knew her in a better
situation; but in this she fails of her purpose,
for it only serves to remind me the
more strongly of it: she is so ready, and
so handy, that she does twenty little offices
that do not belong to her place, and
which are not expected of her.  My mother
is exceedingly pleased with her, and

<pb n="120"/>
says it is such a happiness to have about
me a young person virtuously brought
up, that she almost considers her as one
of the family.

<p>We arrived here yesterday, and met a
most friendly reception from the lady of
this mansion.  But before I say any more
of her, I will hasten to a more interesting
subject.  I have got Mr. Faulkland's letter
to my mother; she has just put it into
my hands; and while she walks in the
garden with lady Grimston, I will make
haste to transcribe it.  Thus it is:
</p>
<lb/>
<div4 type="epistle" id="d38">
<head><name type="recipient">Dorothy</name>
<name type="corresp">Faulkland</name>
</head>
<opener>Madam,</opener>

<p>I submit to the sentence you have passed
on me.  I am miserable, but do not
presume to expostulate.  I purpose leaving
England directly; but would wish,
if possible (a little to mitigate the severity
of my lot), to convince you, that
the unhappy rejected man, who aspired
to the honour of being your son-in-law,

<pb n="121"/>
is not quite such a criminal as he now
appears to you.
</p>
<p>To Sir George's friendship I know I
am much indebted for endeavouring to
vindicate me.  It was not in his power,
it was not in my own; for you saw all
which I, in unreserved freedom, wrote to
him on the subject of my acquaintance
with Miss B.
</p>
<p>I have but one resource left; perhaps,
madam, you will think it a strange one.
To the lady herself I must appeal.  She
will do me justice, and I am sure will be
ready to acknowledge that I am no betrayer
of innocence, no breaker of promises;
that I was surprized into the commission
of a fault, for which I have paid
so dear a price.
</p>
<p>Her testimony, madam, may perhaps
have some weight with you; though I
propose nothing more from it, than that
you may think of me with less detestation.
You have banished me from your
presence: I am a voluntary exile from
my country, and from my friends: I
submit to the chastisement, and would

<pb n="122"/><note></note>
do any thing to expiate my offence against
you and Miss Bidulph.  There is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
command which you can possibly lay on
me, to which I would not pay a perfect
and ready obedience; but that act, perhaps,
is the <hi rend="italic">only</hi> one which would make
me appear worthy of your esteem.
</p>
<p>The lady whom it has been my ill fate
to render unhappy, and by whom I am
made unutterable so, will, ere long, come
to a house at Putney, which I have taken
on purpose for her.  I have placed in it
my housekeeper, a grave worthy woman,
under whose care she will be safe, and attended
with that secrecy and tenderness
which her condition requires.
</p>
<p>I have written to her a faithful account
of every thing relative to my hoped-for
alliance with your family, and the occasion
of the treaty's being broken off.
As she must, by this means, know that
your ladyship is acquainted with her story,
I have told her, that, perhaps you might,
from the interest you took in her misfortune,
be induced to see her in her retirement.
Let me, therefore, conjure you,

<pb n="123"/>
madam, by that pious zeal which governs
all your actions, and by the love you bear
that daughter so deservedly dear to you,
to take compassion on this young lady.
She has no friends, nor any acquaintance
in this part of the kingdom; her situation
will require the comfort of society, and
perhaps, the advice of wisdom.  It will be
an act worthy of your humanity to shew
some countenance to her.
</p>
<p>I think she will be in very good hands
with the honest woman who waits her
coming; but if any thing should happen
otherwise than well, it would make me
doubly wretched.
</p>
<p>To one who has no resources of contentment
in her own bosom, solitude cannot
be a friend; this I fear may be the
lady's case; and this makes me with the
more earnestness urge my request to you.
Forgive me, madam, for the liberty I
take with you; a liberty, which though
I confess it needs an apology, yet is it at
the same time a proof of the confidence I
have in you, which I hope will not affront
either your candour or your virtue.

<pb n="124"/>
</p>
<p>If you will condescend to grant this request,
I shall obtain the two wishes at present
most material to my peace; the one to secure
to the lady a compassionate friend, already
inclined to espouse her cause; the
other, to put it in your power to be satisfied
from the lady's own mouth of the truth of
what I have asserted.  I trust to her generosity
to deal openly on this occasion.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I wish you and Miss Bidulph every
blessing that heaven can bestow, and am,
with great respect,
<lb/>
Madam,<lb/>
<lb/>
Your ladyship's most obedient,<lb/>
<lb/>
Humble Servant,<lb/>
<lb/>
     ORLANDO FAULKLAND.<lb/>
<lb/>
</p>
<p>P.S.  The lady will go by the name of
Mrs. Jefferis: you will pardon me for not
having mentioned her <hi rend="italic">real name</hi>.  I never
yet told it even to Sir George; but I presume
she will make no secret of it to you,
if you honour her with a visit.
</p></div4>
<div4 type="section" id="d39">
<p>Poor Orlando! unhappy Miss B.!  I
could name a third person, that is not

<pb n="125"/>
<hi rend="italic">happy</hi> neither.  What a pity it is, that so many
good qualities should be blotted by imperfections!
how tender is his compassion
for this poor girl! how ingenuous his conduct!
but still he flies from her.  I fear
she can never hope to recover him.  There
is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> thing, he says, which <hi rend="italic">he would not
do; the only act, perhaps, by which he could
make himself appear worthy of my mother's
esteem.</hi>  The meaning of this but too plainly
shews him determined against marrying
Miss B.  I don't know any thing else
which would reconcile my mother to him.
</p>
<p>I make no doubt of her complying
with Mr. Faulkland's request in seeing
the lady: she is very compassionate, particularly
to her own sex.
</p>
<p>What a <hi rend="italic">strange resource</hi> indeed is this
of Mr. Faulkland's, to appeal to the lady
herself!  What am I to judge from it, but
that the unfortunate victim, ignorant of
the treachery that was practised against
her by her wicked aunt, and that her
destroyer paid a <hi rend="italic">price</hi> for her dishonour,
exculpates him from the worst part of
the guilt, and perhaps, poor easy creature,

<pb n="126"/>
blames her own weakness only for the
error which a concealed train of cunning
and perfidy might have led her into?
</p>
<p>But even supposing Miss B. were generous
and candid enough (and great indeed
must be her candour and generosity)
to justify this guilty man, What would it
avail?  Did not my mother tell me she
conceived a <hi rend="italic">sort of horror at the bare idea
of an union between Mr. Faulkland and me?</hi>
This arises from the strong impression
made on her by the unlucky event which
blasted her own early love.  Strong and
early prejudices are almost insurmountable.
</p>
<p>My mother's piety, genuine and rational
as it is, is notwithstanding a little
tinctured with superstition; it was the
error of her education, and her good
sense has not been able to surmount it; so
that I know the universe would not induce
her to change her resolution in regard
to Mr. Faulkland.  She thinks he
<hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to marry Miss B. and she will <hi rend="italic">ever</hi>
think so.  I wish he would; for I am
sure he never can be mine.  The bell

<pb n="127"/>
rings for breakfast; I must run down.
My mother came up to dress just now,
and stepped into my room.  I returned
her the letter, and she asked me, What
I thought of Mr. Faulkland's request?
Madam, you are a better judge of the
propriety of it than I am.  I shall have
no objection to seeing the unhappy lady,
said she, since it seems he has apprised
her of my knowlege of her affairs.  I am
glad he has the grace to shew even so
much compassion for her; perhaps it may
be the beginning of repentance, and time
may work a thorough reformation in
him, if God spares him his life and his
<hi rend="italic">senses</hi>.  You see which way my good
mother's thoughts tended.  I did not, she
added, intend to return to London again;
but this occasion, I think, calls upon me;
and I believe I shall go for a while, in order
to see and comfort this poor young
creature.  She cannot yet be near lying
in; and I suppose she will not come to the
house Mr. Faulkland speaks of, till she
can no longer remain undiscovered at
home; so that month or two hence

<pb n="128"/>
will be full soon enough for me to think of
going to town.
</p>
<p>I saw my mother rested her compliance
with Mr. Faulkland's request, merely on
one point; that of compassion to the girl.
As for the other motive, said she, the
hearing him justified from the <hi rend="italic">lady's own
mouth</hi>, I am not such a novice in those
matters, but that I know when a deluding
man has once got an ascendency over a
young creature, he can coax her into
any thing.  Too much truth I doubt
there is in this observation of my mother's.
</p>
<p>But it is time to say something of lady
Grimston.  My Cecilia has never seen
her, though I believe she has often heard
my mother speak of her.  They are nearly
of an age, and much of the same cast
of thinking; though with this difference,
that lady Grimston is extravagantly rigid
in her notions, and precise in her manner.
She has been a widow for many
years, and lives upon a large jointure at
Grimston-hall, with as much regularity
and solemnity, as you would see in a

<pb n="129"/>
monastery.  Her servants are all antediluvians:
I believe her coach-horses are fifty
years of age, and the very house-dog is as
(?) bald as a badger.  She herself, who in her
youth never <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have been handsome,
renders herself still a more unpleasing
figure, by the oddity of her dress; you
would take her for a lady of Charles the
First's court at least.  She is always dressed
out: I believe she sleeps in her cloaths,
for she comes down ruffled, and towered,
and flounced, and fardingal'd, even to
breakfast.  My mother has a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> high
opinion of her, and says, she <hi rend="italic">knows more
of the world</hi> than any one of her acquaintance.
It may be so; but it must be of
the old world; for lady Grimston has
not been ten miles from her seat these
thirty years.  'Tis nine years since my
mother and she met before, and there was
a world of compliments passed between
them; though I am sure they were sincerely
glad to see each other, for they
seem to be very fond.  They were companions
in youth, that season wherein the
most durable friendships are contracted.

<pb n="130"/>
I believe her really a very good woman;
she is pious and charitable, and does
abundance of good things in her neighbourhood;
though I cannot say I think
her amiable.  There is an austerity about
he that keeps me in awe, notwithstanding
that she is extremely obliging to me, and
told my mother, I <hi rend="italic">promised to make a fine woman.</hi>
Think of such a compliment to one
of almost nineteen.  My mother and she
call one another by their christian names;
and you would smile to hear the two old
ladies (begging their pardons) <hi rend="italic">Lettying</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">Dollying</hi> one another.  This accounts
to me for lady Grimston's thinking <hi rend="italic">me</hi>
still a child; for I suppose she considers
herself not much past girlhood, though
to do her justice, she has not a scrap of
it in her behaviour.

<p>All our motions here
are as regular as the clock.  The family
rise at six; we are summoned to breakfast
at eight; at ten a venerable congregation
are assembled to prayers, which
an ancient clergyman, who is curate of

<pb n="131"/>
the parish, and her ladyship's chaplain,
gives us daily.  Then the old horses are
put to the old coach; and my lady, with
her guests, if they chuse it, take an airing;
always going and returning by the same
road, and driving precisely to the same
land-mark, and no farther.  At half an
hour after twelve, in a hall large enough
to entertain a corporation, we sit down to
dinner; my lady has a grace of a quarter
of an hour long; and we are waited on
by four truly venerable footmen, for she
likes state.  The afternoon we may dispose
of as we please; at least it is a liberty
I am indulged in; and I generally spend
my time in the garden, or my own chamber,
till I have notice given me of supper's
being on the table, where we are
treated with the same ceremonials as at
dinner.  At ten exactly, the instant the
clock strikes the first stroke, my lady rises
with great solemnity, and wishes us a
good night.

<p>You cannot expect, in
such a house as this is, my dear, that I

<pb n="132"/>
can be furnished with materials to give
you much variety.  Indeed these four last
days have been so exactly the same in
every particular, excepting that the dishes
at dinner and supper were change, that
I had resolved to hang up my pen till I
quitted Grimston-hall, or at least resign
it to Patty, and let her plod on and tell you
how the wind blew such a day; what sort
of a mantua lady Grimston had on such
a day (though by the way it is always the
same, always ash-coloured tissue); what
the great dog barked at, at such an hour,
and what the old parrot said at such a
time; the house and the garden I have
exhausted my descriptive faculties on already,
though they are neither of them
worth describing; and I was beginning to
despair of matter to furnish out a quarter
of an hour's entertainment, when the
scene began to brighten a little this
auspicious day, by the arrival of a coach
full of visitors.  These were a venerable
dean, who is the minister of our parish,
his lady and daughter, and a Mr. Arnold,
a gentleman who is a distant relation

<pb n="133"/>
of lady Grimston's.  He has a
house in this neighbourhood, and is just
come to an estate by the death of his
elder brother.
</p>
<p>This visit has given me hopes that I
may now-and-then have a chance for seeing
a human face, besides the antiques of
the family, and those which are depicted
on the arras.  Though not to disparage
the people, they were all agreeable enough
in their different ways.  The old dean is
good-humoured and polite; I mean the
true politeness, that of the heart, which
dictates the most obliging things in so frank
a manner, that they have not the least
appearance of flattery.  Being very nearsighted,
he put on a pair of spectacles to
look at me, and turning to Mr. Arnold,
with a vivacity that would have become
five-and-twenty, he repeated,
</p>
<p>(?)(?) </p>
<p>'With an air and a face,
</p>
<p></p>
<p>'And a shape and a grace,&amp;c.'
The young man smiled his assent, and
my mother looked so delighted, that the
good-natured dean's compliment pleased
<hi rend="italic">me</hi> for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sake.  Lady Grimston, who is

<pb n="134"/>
passionately fond of musick, has a very
pretty organ in one of her chambers;
Mr. Arnold was requested to give us a
lesson on it, which he very readily obliged
us with.  He plays ravishingly; the creature
made me envious, he touched it so
admirably.  I had taken a sort of dislike
to him when he first came in, I cannot
tell you why or wherefore; but this accomplishment
has reconciled me so to
him, that I am half in love with him.  I
hope we shall see him often; he is really
excellent on this instrument, and you
know how fond I am of musick.

<p>This packet is already so
large that I am sure it will frighten you.  I
will therefore send it off before I increase
it; especially as I am now so much in the
hum-drum way, that I ought, out of
policy, to make a break in my narrative,
in order to encourage you to read it.
Positively, if things do not mend, and
that considerably too&mdash;Patty shall keep
the Journal; for I find myself already
disposed to sleep over it.

<p>I have looked over what
Patty has writ for the five last days; upon
my word she is a very good journalist,
as well as amanuensis; and she has given
you, to the full, as good an account of
matters and things as I could.
</p>
<p>My time passes rather more tolerably
than I expected.  The dean's family seem
to have broken the solitary <hi rend="italic">spell</hi> that
hung over the house, and we have company
you see every day.  Mr. Arnold never
fails.  I always make him play' he is
very obliging, and, if he were not good
natured, I should tire him.

<p>I have had a letter from
Sir George; he mentions not Mr. Faulkland;
I too am endeavouring to forget
him.  When my mother goes to London,
I will try to prevail on her to let me
go down to Sidney Castle.  I have no
inclination to go to town, and less to stay
here.  We are to have a concert to-morrow
at Mr. Arnold's house.  My lively
good old dean touches the bass viol, his

daughter sings prettily; I am to bear my
part too; so that we begin to grow a

<p>Are you not tired of my
Grimston journal, my Cecilia?  Day after
day rolls on, and the same dull repetion!
Lady Grimston, the Dean, and Mr.
Arnold, perpetually! there is no bearing
this, you cry.  Well, but here is a new
personage arrived to diversify the scene a
little.  Lady Grimston's daughter, a
sweet woman; but her mother does not
seem fond of her.  It amazes me, for she
is perfectly amiable, both in temper and
person; she is a widow of about eight-and-twenty.  Lady Grimston appears to treat
her with a distance very unmaternal;
and the poor young woman seems so
humbled, that I pity her.  She is come
but on a visit, and we shall lose her in a
week, for which I am very sorry, as I
have taken a fancy to her.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d46">
	<head><date value="1703-09-01"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 1.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Poor Mrs. Vere! that
is the name of lady Grimston's daughter.

<pb n="137"/>
I can now give you the cause of her
mother's coldness to her; I had it from
herself; she told me her little history
this evening in the garden, with a frankness
that charmed me.
</p>
<p>How happy you are, dear Miss Bidulph!
said she: you seem to be blessed
with one of the tenderest of parents.  I
am indeed, I answered; she is one of the
best of mothers, and the best of women.
She sighed, and a tear started into her eye;
I too was happy once, said she, when my
indulgent father lived.  I hope, madam,
lady Grimston is to you, what my good
mother is to me.  She shook her head:
No, Miss Bidulph, it must be but too obvious
to you that she is not.  I should not
have introduced the subject, if the cold
severity of her looks were not so apparent
that you must have taken notice of them.
My mother is undoubtedly, a very good
woman; and you may naturally suppose,
that my conduct has been such as to deserve
her frowns; I will therefore tell you
my melancholy, though short, story.  It
is now about twelve years since Mr. Vere

<pb n="138"/>
paid his address to me. He was the
eldest son of a gentleman of family and
fortune, who then lived in this country.
I was about sixteen, and the darling of
my father; who was perhaps the more
indulgent to me, as he knew my mother's
severity.  Mr. Vere was but two years
older than myself, and a childish courtship
had gone on for some time between
us, before it was suspected by any body;
and to say the truth, before I was well
aware of the consequences myself.  It
happened, that an elderly gentleman of
a great estate, just at that time saw and
liked me, and directly made proposals to
my mother, as she was very well known
to hold the reins of government in her
family.
</p>
<p>This offer, I suppose, was advantageous;
for she immediately consulted my
father upon it, or rather gave him to understand
that she meant to dispose of her
daughter in marriage.
</p>
<p>My father, who had no objection to the
match, told her he was very well satisfied,
provided I liked the gentleman; but said

<pb n="139"/>
he hoped she would not think of putting
any force on my inclinations.  My eldest
sister had been married sometime before
by my mother's sole authority, and quite
contrary to her own liking; the marriage
had not turned out happily, and my
father was resolved not to have me sacrificed
in the same way.
</p>
<p>My mother told him, she was sorry
he had such romantic notions, as to think
a girl of my age capable of having any
ideas of preference for one man more than
another; that she took it for granted I
had never presumed to entertain a thought
of any man as yet, and supposed her precepts
had not been so far thrown away
upon me, as that I could let it enter into
my head that any thing but parental authority
was to guide me in my choice.
</p>
<p>My father, from the gentleness of his
nature, had been so accustomed to acquiesce,
that he made no other reply than
to bid my mother use her discretion.  He
came directly to me notwithstanding, and
told me what had passed.  It was then,
for the first time, that I discovered I loved

<pb n="140"/>
Mr. Vere.  I burst into tears, and clinging
round my father's neck, begged of him
to save me from my mother's rigour.
My gesture and words were too passionate
for him not to perceive that there was
something more at my heart than mere
dislike of the old man.  He charged me
to deal sincerely.  I loved him too well,
and was myself too frank to do otherwise.
In short, I confessed my inclination for
Mr. Vere, and his affection for me.
</p>
<p>Though my kind father chid me gently
for admitting a lover without his or my
mother's approbation, yet at the same
time he told me, he would endeavour to
dissuade her from prosecuting the other
match; though he could wish, he said,
I would try to bring myself to accept of
it; adding, he was afraid my mother
would be much incensed by a denial.
</p>
<p>My mother was fond of grandeur; and
would not like to have me marry any
one, who not could at once make me
mistress of a fine house, and a fine equipage;
which I knew I must not expect
to be the case with Mr. Vere.  His father

<pb n="141"/>
had several children, and was very frugal
in his temper: besides, as he was but of
the middle age, and of a very healthy
constitution, his son's prospect of possessing
the estate was, to all human appearance,
at a very great distance.
</p>
<p>These discouragements, however, did
not hinder me from indulging my wishes.
My father's tenderness was the foundation
on which I built my hopes.  I told
Mr. Vere the designs of one parent, and
the kind condescension of the other.  Emboldened
by this information, he ventured
to disclose his love to my father, begging
his interest with my mother in his favour.
He had a great kindness for the youth,
and was so fond of me, that he would
readily have consented to my happiness,
if the fear of disobliging my mother had
not checked him.  He represented to her
in the mildest manner, the utter dislike
I had expressed of the proposed match,
and conjured her not to insist on it.  My
mother, unused to be controuled, was
filled with resentment both against him
and me; she said, he encouraged me in

<pb n="142"/>
my disobedience; and that, if he did not
unite his authority to hers, in order to
compel me to marry the gentleman she
approved of, it would make a total breach
between them.
</p>
<p>My good father, who loved my mother
exceedingly, was alarmed at this
menace.  Unwilling to come to extremities
either with her or me, he was at a loss
how to act.  His paternal love at length
prevailed, and he determined, at all
events, to save me from the violence
which he knew would be put upon my
heart.
</p>
<p>My mother had never condescended to
talk to me on the subject: she thought
my immediate obedience ought to have
followed the bare knowledge of her will.
She forbad me her sight, and charged me
never to appear before her, till I came
with a determination to obey her.
</p>
<p>However severe this prohibition was,
I yielded to it with the less reluctance, as
my father's tender love made me amends
for my mother's harshness.  Perhaps, had
she vouchsafed to reason a little with me,

<pb n="143"/>
tempering her arguments with a motherly
kindness, she would have found me as
flexible as she could wish; but the course
she took had a very contrary effect.  I
thought myself persecuted, and that it was
for the honour of my love to persevere.
On the other hand, my father's secret
indulgence encouraged me in the sentiments
I entertained, and I now determined,
not only to refuse my old lover,
but to have my young one.
</p>
<p>My mother had given me a stated time
in which I was to come to a resolution,
and if I did not, at the expiration of it,
acquiesce, I was to be pronounced a reprobate,
and to be no more considered as
her child.  In this emergency I had recourse
to my father.  I told him there
was nothing which I was not ready to suffer,
rather than marry the man I hated:
my greatest affliction was the uneasiness I
saw him endure on my account; for my
mother reproached him daily with my
obstinacy.
</p>
<p>My father said, he thought the alternative
offered by mother, was to be

<pb n="144"/>
avoided but in one way, and that was by
marrying Mr. Vere: For, added he, when
she finds you resolute in your refusal of her
choice, not even my paternal authority
will be able to screen you from her severity,
and your life will be made miserable,
without your father's being able to relieve
you.  On the other hand, when you are
out of her house, she cannot distress you,
nor prevent me from doing you the justice
which I owe my child.  Nay, possibly in
time, I may be able to work out a reconciliation
between you; but she must not
know that I was consenting to this marriage,
lest an irreconcileable quarrel
should ensue.  I fell at my father's feet,
and embraced his knees, for this tender
and unexpected proof of his affection.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vere's father was no stranger to his
son's attachment, and we were very sure
he would readily come into the proposal
which my father intended to me.
</p>
<p>The two parents had a meeting secretly,
where all the terms of portion and settlement
were speedily and privately adjusted.
Mr. Vere the father, who had been long

<pb n="145"/>
intimate in our family, knew very well
the necessity there was for keeping the
secret.  After this, my lover and I were
to be married privately, without the
knowledge, seemingly, of any one in either
family, excepting one of the Miss Veres,
who was to be present; and when the
time of my probation was expired, my
father was to let my mother into the
knowledge of this affair, as a thing he
had just discovered; and to pacify her
anger as well as he could.
</p>
<p>Every thing was conducted in the
manner proposed.  I was married with
the utmost privacy, and continued in my
father's house till the day arrived, when I
was to give my definitive answer.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for me, my mother
chose to receive it from my own mouth,
and called me into her presence.  I appeared
before her trembling and terrified:
I had not seen her for a fortnight, and I
was in dread, lest the discovery I had to
make, should banish me her sight perhaps
for ever, unless my father might
influence her in time to forgive me.  She

<pb n="146"/>
asked me, with a stern brow, What I had
resolved on?  I had not courage to make
her an answer, but burst into tears.  She
repeated her question; and I could only
reply, Madam, it is not in my <hi rend="italic">power</hi> to
obey you.  She did not comprehend the
meaning of my words, but imputing them
to obstinacy, commanded me to leave
the room, and not to see her face till I
came to a proper sense of my duty; at
the same time ordering me into my chamber,
where I was to be locked up.
</p>
<p>I flew to my father, and conjured him
to let my mother know the truth at once,
that I might be no longer subject to such
harsh treatment; for I knew the being
sent home to my husband would be the
consequence of her being told that I had
one.
</p>
<p>My poor father was almost afraid to
undertake the task, though he had been
the chief promoter of my marriage, and
his authority ought to have given sanction
to it.  He ventured however to let her
know, that I had confessed to him what
my fears of her immediate resentment

<pb n="147"/>
would not suffer me to discover whilst I
was in her presence; and what my aversion
to the man she proposed to me, and
the rigours I had been threatened with,
if I refused him, had driven me to.  The
rage my mother flew into, was a little short
of phrenzy, and my father made haste
to send me out of the house.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vere's whole family received me
with great tenderness; but I was sorry
at leaving my father, whose visits to me
were made but seldom, and even those
by stealth.
</p>
<p>My situation, though I was united to
the man I loved, and caressed by all his
family, was far from being happy.  My
mother's inflexible temper was not to be
wrought upon, notwithstanding my father
did his utmost to prevail on her to see and
to forgive me; and she carried her resentment
so far, that she told my father, unless
he cut me off intirely in his will, she
was determined to separate herself totally
from him.  This was an extremity he by
no means expected she would have gone
to.

<pb n="148"/>
</p>
<p>In a fit of sickness, which had seized
him a few years before, he had left me
ten thousand pounds; five of this he had
secretly transferred to Mr. Vere on the day
of my marriage, and had promised him to
bequeath me five more at his death.
</p>
<p>In consequence of this disposition, he
purposed making a new will, so that he
the less scrupled giving my mother up
the old one, with a promise of making
another agreeable to her request.
</p>
<p>My mother's jointure was already settled
on her; my eldest sister had received
her portion; so that there was little bequeathed
by this testament, but my fortune,
and a few other small legacies.
</p>
<p>My mother tore the will with indignation,
and not satisfied with my father's
promise, insisted on his putting it into
execution immediately.  In short, his
easy temper yielded to her importunities,
and he had a will drawn up by her instructions,
in which I was cut off with
one shilling, and my intended fortune bequeathed
to my eldest sister.  My mother
was made residuary legatee to every thing

<pb n="149"/>
that should remain, after paying all the
bequests.  This would have amounted to
a considerable sum, if the half of my
portion, which was already paid without
her knowledge, had not made such a
diminution in the personal estate, that
after paying my sister the whole of what
was specified in the will, there was scarce
any thing likely to remain.
</p>
<p>Had my mother known this secret, she
would not perhaps have been so ready
to have made my father devise all my
intended fortune to my sister.  My father,
who was aware of this, durst not however
inform her at that juncture, how
much she hurt herself by forcing him to
such measures.  She insisted upon his leaving
the whole of what he designed for me
to my eldest sister; as well to convince
him, she said, that she had no self-interested
views, as to be an example to other
rebellious children.
</p>
<p>My father had no remedy on these occasions,
but a patient acquiescence: the
will was made, and my mother herself
would keep it.

<pb n="150"/>
</p>
<p>My father took an opportunity the same
day to inform me what he had done; but
assured me, he would immediately make
another will, agreeable to his first intentions,
and leave it in the hands of a faithful
friend.
</p>
<p>This was his design; but alas he lived
not to execute it!  He was seized that
night with a paralytic disorder, which at
once deprived him of the use of his
limbs and his speech.  They who were
about him believe he retained his senses,
but he was not capable of making himself
understood even by signs.  Alarmed with
this dismal account of my beloved father's
situation, I flew to the house without
considering my mother's displeasure; but
I was not permitted to see him.  I filled
the house with my cries, but to no purpose
I had not the satisfaction of receiving
even a farewel look from him, which
was all he was capable of bestowing on
me.
</p>
<p>He languished for several days in this
melancholy condition, and then, in spite
of the aid of physic, expired.

<pb n="151"/>
</p>
<p>The loss of this dear father so intirely
took up my thoughts, that I never reflected
on the loss of the remaining part
of my fortune; but it was not so with
my father-in-law.  There had been a
settlement made on me in consequence of
the fortune promised; though not equal
to what it demanded, yet superior to the
half which was paid.  He relied on my
father's word for the remainder, and had
no doubt of its being secured to him,
knowing his circumstances, as well as his
strict integrity, and that my sister had
actually received the same fortune which I
was promised.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vere had four daughters, and it
was on this fortune he chiefly depended
to provide for them.
</p>
<p>The news of my being cut off with a
shilling exceedingly surprized and exasperated
him.  Unluckily I had not mentioned
to him, nor even to my husband,
the will which my father had been obliged
to make.  The assurances he gave me, of
immediately making another in my favour,
prevented me; as I thought it would

<pb n="152"/>
only be a very severe proof of my mother's
enmity to the family, which I could have
wished to conceal from them; especially
as I did not imagine it would have affected
me afterwards.  Mr. Vere the
elder was from home when my father
died, and his business detained him for
more than a month after his funeral was
over.  My husband, on this occasion,
shewed the tender and disinterested love
he bore me; he affected to make as light
as possible of this unexpected disappointment,
but at the same time expressed his
uneasiness, lest his father should carry
matters to an extremity with my mother,
from whom he knew we were to expect
nothing by mild methods.
</p>
<p>It was now thought adviseable, that I
should write to my mother, to condole
with her on my father's death; again to
intreat her forgiveness of my fault, and,
as some mitigation of it, to acknowledge
that it was not only with my father's privity,
but even with his consent and approbation,
that I had married.
</p>
<p>I wrote this letter in a strain of the utmost

<pb n="153"/>
humility, without mentioning a word
of my fortune; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I thought it would
be time enough for me to do, if I could
prevail on my mother to see me, and
would at all events come better from my
husband or his father, than from me.
But I gained nothing by this, only some
unkind reflections on my father's memory,
and a message, that since he thought
proper to marry his daughter in a manner
so highly disagreeable to her mother,
he should have taken care of providing for
her; as he could not expect a parent, so
disobliged as she had been, would take
any notice of me.
</p>
<p>My mother had been left sole executrix
to my father's forced will; and she took
care to put my sister, and the other legatees,
into possession of what was bequeathed
to them, in a very short time after his
decease.  She found there was an unexpected
deficiency in his personal fortune,
insomuch that there was barely enough to
pay his debts; and that her being left the
residue, after the specified legacies were
paid, amounted to nothing.  On the contrary,

<pb n="154"/>
had my father's just intentions
taken place, in leaving me five thousand
pounds, she would have come in for the
other five; but the whole ten thousand
now went to my sister.
</p>
<p>She was not long however at a loss
to know how this came to pass.  Mr.
Vere determined to assert his own, and
his son's right; and being exceedingly
provoked at my mother's behaviour,
wrote to her immediately on his return
home; and having informed her of the
settlement made on me, on account of the
fortune already paid, and what was farther
agreed on to be paid by my father, told
her, he expected that this promise should
be punctually fulfilled.  He said, he knew
she had it in her power to do this; and
since it was by her contrivance I had
been robbed of my just right, if honour,
and the duty of a parent, would not induce
her to make me proper amends, she
must excuse him, if he made use of such
means as the laws allowed him, in order
to compel her.
</p>
<p>Such a letter, to a woman of my mother's

<pb n="155"/>
temper, met with such a reception
as might be expected.  She tore it before
his messenger's face; and desired him to
tell his master, that as what he had already
obtained was by fraud, so he was
at liberty to make use of force to recover
the remainder; but, with her consent, he
never should have a single shilling.
</p>
<p>This exasperating reply made my
father-in-law directly commence a suit
against her, in which the other legatees
were made parties.  The distress I felt on
this occasion is scarce to be imagined;
the breach was now so widened between
my mother and my husband's family, that
there remained not the least hope of its
ever being closed.  Mr. Vere unwillingly
joined with his father in pursuit of these
measures.  He would for my sake much
rather have yielded up his expectations,
than supported them at the expence of
my quiet; but his father's will, and justice
to the rest of his family, compelled him
to proceed, and deprived me of any pretence
for interposing.
</p>
<p>The law-suit was carrying on with

<pb n="156"/>
great acrimony on both sides, when an
event happened, that made me then, and
has indeed ever since, look with indifference
on every thing in this life; it was
the death of my husband.  He was
snatched from me by a violent fever, before
he reached his twentieth year.
</p>
<p>I will not pretend to describe my sufferings
to you on this sad occasion; they
were aggravated by my being near the
time of lying-in.
</p>
<p>Whatever affliction Mr. Vere felt for
the death of his only son, it did not make
him forgetful of what he owed his daughters;
and he was resolved to carry on the
law-suit with the utmost vigour.
</p>
<p>You may suppose the house wherein I had
lost a beloved husband appeared a dismal
place to me, especially in my present situation.
I thought too, my father's looks
began to grow colder to me than they
used to be; and I begged I might have
his permission to remove for a while.  He
did not oppose it, and I went, at the
pressing intreaties of your favourite, the
good old dean, to his house; where he and

<pb n="157"/>
his lady behaved to me with more than
parental tenderness.  My health was in
so declining a way, that this worthy man
(as I have since learned) made several applications
to my mother to see me, but
without success.  At length the hour of
my delivery arrived, and I was brought
to-bed of a dead female child.  The
estate, in case of Mr. Vere's dying without
issue, devolved on his sisters; and I
was in hopes this circumstance, so favourable
to the young ladies, would have
induced their father to have been less rigorous
in persisting in his claim.  But in
this I was deceived; he loved money,
and was besides full of resentment against
my mother.  I thought however of an expedient,
which I flattered myself might
work upon him; and by good fortune
it succeeded.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vere, though I had left his house,
visited me constantly, and kept up a shew
of tenderness, which I am sure he had
not in his heart: I told him one day,
whilst I was still confined to my bed, that
as I had now lost both my husband and

<pb n="158"/>
my child, a very moderate income would
be sufficient for me; and that as I valued
my mother's peace of mind, beyond any
selfish consideration, I was very willing
to give up half my jointure, provided he
would drop his suit.  Mr. Vere seemed
surprized at the proposal: he said, he
wondered I could be so blind to my
own interest, and that all he was doing
was purely for my sake.  I thanked
him for his pretended friendship, but assured
him, he could serve me no way so
effectually, as by coming into the measure
I proposed.  Mr. Vere said, I talked like a
child; but he would consider of it.  The
following day he called on me again, and
told me, that to make me easy he was
willing to come into my proposal; that
he would have the proper instruments
drawn, by which I was to relinquish half
my jointure; and he in consequence to
give up all claim on my father's estate.
</p>
<p>I was much better pleased at this losing
agreement, than if I had acquired a large
accession of fortune.
</p>
<p>Mr. Vere soon got the proper deeds
ready, and they were executed in form.

<pb n="159"/>
</p>
<p>I now relapsed into an illness, from
which I was supposed to have been quite
recovered, and my life was thought in
great danger.  I have since been told,
that Mr. Vere repented his agreement at
that juncture, and told some of his
friends, that if he had not been so hasty,
he should have had a chance for my
jointure and my fortune too.
</p>
<p>I begged of the dean to go to my mother,
and use his last efforts on her, to
prevail with her to see and forgive me,
before I died; at the same time I sent
her the release I had procured from Mr.
Vere, which I knew was the most acceptable
present I could make her.  The dean
urged the danger I was in, without its
seeming to make much impression on her.
I am willing to believe, that she thought
the dean exaggerated in his account of my
illness.  He owned to me himself, that
he was shocked to find her so obdurate.
At length, he took the paper out of his
pocket, and presenting it to her, I am
sorry, madam, said he, I cannot prevail
with you to act like a parent or a christian;

<pb n="160"/>
your daughter I fear will not survive
her present malady; but she will have
the comfort to consider, that she has left
nothing unattempted to obtain that forgiveness,
which you so cruelly deny her.
I hope, lady Grimston, your last hours may
be as peaceful, as hers I trust will be from
this reflection.  There, madam&mdash;she has
by that instrument left you disengaged
from a troublesome and vexatious law-suit, that would, if pursued, infallibly
turn out to your disadvantage; it was all
she <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do, and what few children, used
like her, <hi rend="italic">would</hi> have done.
</p>
<p>My mother, a good deal alarmed at
the dean's manner of speaking, now examined
the contents of the paper.  She
seemed affected, and called him back, as
he was just leaving the room.  She told
him, she was not lost to the feelings of
nature; and that if he thought her presence
would contribute to ease my mind
of the remorse it must needs labour under,
she was not against seeing me.
</p>
<p>The good man, glad to find her in this
yielding disposition, told her she could

<pb n="161"/>
not too soon execute her intention; and
pressed her to come to his house directly.
She suffered him to put her into his
coach, and he carried her home with him.
The interview, on my side, was attended
with tears of joy, tenderness, and contrition.
My mother did not depart form
her usual austerity; she gave me but her
hand to kiss, and pronounced her forgiveness
and her blessing in so languid a
manner, as greatly damped the fervor of
my joy.
</p>
<p>She staid with me not more than a
quarter of an hour, and having talked of
indifferent things, without once so much
as mentioning what I had done, she took
a cold and formal leave.
</p>
<p>This interview, as little cordial as my
mother's behaviour was to me, had so good
an effect on me, that I began perceptibly
to mend from that hour.  She sent indeed
constantly to inquire how I did; but
avoided coming, lest, as she said, she
should meet with Mr. Vere, whom she
could never forgive.  As soon as I was
in a condition to go abroad, I went to

<pb n="162"/>
pay my duty to her.  She received me
with civility, but no tenderness; nor has
she ever from that time made me the
least recompence for what I have lost;
her permitting me to see her, she thinks
sufficient amends.
</p>
<p>I did not choose to return to Mr. Vere's
house, as I had only a polite, not a kind
invitation.  One of his daughters, she
who had been present at my marriage,
and who always had shewn most affection
towards me, was about this time married
to a gentleman, whose estate lay in another
county.  When the bride went
home, she pressed me to go with her so
warmly, that I could not refuse her; and
during the time I staid with her, I received
so many marks of tenderness from
her, that I resolved to settle in her neighbourhood;
and have now a little house
near her, where I have resided constantly
ever since.  I come once or twice a year
to pay a visit to my mother; but my reception,
as you may see, is always cold,
and I seldom stay more than a few days.
</p>
<p>Old Mr. Vere is dead; and his daughters,

<pb n="163"/>
who were coheiresses to his estate,
are all married, so that the family is intirely
dispersed; but notwithstanding this,
and the number of years that have passed
over since my marriage, my mother cannot
yet endure the name of the family:
and always, as you may have observed,
calls me by my maiden name.
</p>
<p>I was much affected at the story of the
amiable Mrs. Vere.  The sweet melancholy,
which predominates in her countenance,
shews that the spirits, when broken
in the bud of youth, are hardly to be
recovered.  What a tyrant this lady Grimston
is!  I did not admire her before,
but I now absolutely dislike her.  What a
wife and a mother has she been to a husband
and a daughter, who might have
constituted the happiness of a woman of a
different temper!  And yet, she passes for
a wonderful good woman, and a pattern
of all those virtues of a religion which
meekness, and forgiveness characterise.
She is mistaken, if she thinks that authority
is necessary to christianity.  The most
that my charity allows me to believe of

<pb n="164"/>
such people is, that they impose on <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>,
at a time when the most discerning
perhaps think that they are endeavouring
to impose on others.
</p>
<p>What an angel is my good mother,
when compared to this her friend, whom
her humility makes her look upon as her
superior in virtue!  I am very angry with
Sir George, who is in his resentment, said
to me once, that she was like lady Grimston.
I then knew but little of that
lady's character, or I should have reproved
him for it.
</p>
<p>I conjured Mrs. Vere to make her visit
longer than she had at first intended.  She
told me, she would most gladly do it;
but that it was a liberty she did not dare
to take, unless her mother asked her to
prolong it; which, she said, she possibly
might do in complaisance to me.

<p>My mother I find has
made lady Grimston her confidant in relation
to my affairs; the dear woman never
keeps her mind to herself on any subject.
Lady Grimston highly applauds her conduct

<pb n="165"/>
in that business;a nd bestowed a few
civil words on me for my filial duty, intermixed
with an ungrateful comparison
of her own daughter's behaviour.  And
she condoled with herself, by saying that
<hi rend="italic">good parents</hi> had not always <hi rend="italic">good children</hi>.
She told my mother, that she wished to see
the child (meaning me) happily disposed
of; for that, notwithstanding the prudence
of my behaviour, the world would be apt
to cast reflections on me, on account of the
abruptness with which the match was
broken off, without the true reasons being
known: and my illness, she said, might
be imputed to the disappointment; which
might incline people to suspect the rejection
had been on Mr. Faulkland's side.
What a provoking hint was this, my dear!
it has really alarmed my mother, who depends
much on the judgment of her
friend, and has at the same time so nice
a regard to the honour of her family&mdash;I
wish that formal old woman would mind
her own business.

<p>My mother and lady

<pb n="166"/>
Grimston have had abundance of private
confabulation these two days, from which
Mrs. Vere and I are excluded.  I wish
there may not be some mischief a brewing.
One thing, however has given me pleasure;
lady Grimston has invited her
daughter to stay at Grimston-hall as long
as my mother and I continue here.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Vere tells me, she suspects the
subject of their conferences; but she is
perverse, and will not tell me what she
thinks, for fear, as she says, she should
have guessed wrong, and her surmises
would only teaze me.

<p>A packet sent me
from London&mdash;A letter from Sir George
&mdash;one from my Cecilia&mdash;and so soon too!
Welcome, welcome, thou faithful messenger
from the faithfulest of hearts!
</p>
<p>Thou dear anticipating little prophetess!
What put it into thy head to call
Mr. Arnold a new conquest, upon my
but barely mentioning him to you?  I was
just going to tell you all; and behold
your own whimsical imagination has suggested
the most material part to you already.

<pb n="167"/>
You desire me to be sincere: was
that necessary, my sister, from <hi rend="italic">you</hi> to <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>
You say, you are <hi rend="italic">sure Mr. Arnold is, or
will be my lover</hi>; and insist on my being
more particular in my description of him.
What a strange girl you are!  Again I ask
you, What put this into your head?
What busy little spirit of intelligence
flew to you with this news before I knew
it myself?  For as to the fact, it is but
too certain.
</p>
<p>This has been the subject of my mother's
and lady Grimston's private conferences;
and Mrs. Vere (sly thing as she
is) guessed it.  It seems Mr. Arnold disclosed
his passion to lady Grimston, in order
to ask her advice about it.  She loves
mightily to be consulted; and, ill-starred
as I am, did me the honour to recommend
me strongly to him; and she has
prepossessed my mother too in favour of
this new man.  I wish the meddling old
dame had been dumb.  Now shall I go
through another fiery trial!  Heaven help
me, if lady Grimston were to be my
judge!  But my mother is all goodness.

<pb n="168"/>
</p>
<p>Well, but you want a description of
this man.  I will give it to you, though
I have scarce patience to write about him.
Indeed, Cecilia, I am vexed; I foresee a
great deal of trouble from that quarter.&mdash;
But come, I will try what I can say.
</p>
<p>The man is about thirty, genteel, and
handsome enough; at least he is reckoned
so, and I believe I should think him so,
if I were not angry with him.  He is
very like your brother Henry; and you
know he is an allowed handsome man.
He seems to have plain good sense, and
is good-humoured I believe: I do not
know of what colour his eyes are, for I
never looked much at him.  Lady Grimston
says he is a <hi rend="italic">scholar</hi> (a thing she pretends
to value highly) and a mighty sober,
pious, worthy gentleman.  He is of
a very good family; and has an estate of
about fifteen hundred pounds a year, upon
which there is a jointure of three hundred
pounds a year, paid to his brother's
widow.  Part of the estate is in Kent,
and part in this county of Essex, where
he has a mansion-house, a well-enough

<pb n="169"/>
looking old-fashioned place, something
in the Grimston-hall stile, at about a mile
distance from this; where he passes most
of his time.
</p>
<p>I have told you already, he plays divinely
on several instruments; this is the
only circumstance about him that pleases
me.
</p>
<p>He has not yet made his addresses to
me in form; yet we all know that he
intends it, from his uncommon assiduity
towards me; but he has a sort of
reserve about him, and loves to do every
thing in his own way.
</p>
<p>Bless me!&mdash;here he is&mdash;his chariot has
just driven into the court; and Mrs. Vere
peeps in upon me, and with a most vexatious
archness, bids me come down to
the parlour; but I will not, unless my
mother desires me.  I will go into the
garden, to be for a while out of the way.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d50">
	<head><date value="1703-09-11"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 11.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Yesterday evening
was productive of nothing but looks and
compliments, and bows, and so forth;
except two or three delightful pieces of

<pb n="170"/>
musick, which he executed incomparably.
But this morning, my Cecilia!  Oh, this
morning! the man spoke out, told me in
downright plain English, that he loved
me!  How insipid is such a declaration,
when it comes from one who is indifferent
to us!  I do not know how it was, but instead
of being abashed, I could have
smiled in his face when he declared himself;
but you may be sure I did not; that
would not have been pretty.
</p>
<p>I was sitting in the little drawing-room,
reading,w hen he came in.  To be sure
he was sent to me by the ancient ladies,
otherwise he would not have intruded;
for the man is not ill-bred.  The book
happened to be Horace; upon his entering
the room, I laid it by; he asked me
politely enough, what were my studies.
When I named the author, he took the
book up, land opening the leaves, started,
and looked me full in the face; I coloured.
My charming Miss Bidulph, said
he, do you prefer this to the agreeable
entertainment of finishing this beautiful
rose here, that seems to blush at your neglect

<pb n="171"/>
of it?  He spoke this, pointing to a
little piece of embroidery that lay in a
frame before me.  I was nettled at the
question; it was too assuming.  Sir, I
hope I was as innocently, and as usefully
employed; and I assure you, I give a
greater portion of my time to my needle,
than to my book.
</p>
<p>You are so lovely, madam, that nothing
you can do needs an apology.  An
apology, I'll assure you! did not this
look, my dear, as if the man thought I
ought to beg his pardon for understanding
Latin?  For this accidental, and I think (to
a woman) trivial accomplishment, I am
indebted, you know, to Sir George,
who took so much pains with me the
two or three summers he was indisposed
at Sidney Castle.
</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me how
much he admired, how much he loved
me! and that having been encouraged
by lady Grimston's assuring him that I
was disengaged (observe that) he presumed
to tell me so.  Oh, thought I,
perhaps thou art thyself a Grimstonian,

<pb n="172"/>
and do not think it necessary that the
heart should be consulted.  I answered
him mighty civilly, and mighty little to
the purpose.  Sir, I thank you for your
favourable sentiments&mdash;Lady Grimston
does me a great deal of honour&mdash;I think
myself happy in her good opinion&mdash;But
he was not to be so put off, he pressed
me to give him hopes, as he called it.
Alas! I have no hopes to give him.  He
said, he would not presume to mention
his love to my mother, though lady
Grimston pressed him to it (it was like
her) till he had first declared himself to
me.  This was not indelicate; my heart
thanked him for it, though I only returned
him a bow.  We were seasonably (to
me, at least) interrupted here, by the arrival
of my friend the dean.  He had come
to see lady Grimston, just as Mr. Arnold
had entered into conversation with me;
the old gentleman had a mind to walk in
the garden; the little drawing-room,
where we were, opened into it by a glass
door; so that lady Grimston and my mother
were obliged to bring him that way.

<pb n="173"/>
Though I was glad that the conversation
was broke off, yet I could have wished
that I had first had an opportunity of
throwing a little cold water on Mr. Arnold's
<hi rend="italic">hopes</hi>, lest he should have put
too favourable an interpretation on the
reception I gave him, and mention the
thing to my mother, before I had time
to speak to her.
</p>
<p>I was in some confusion at their entering
the room.  Mr. Arnold had at that
minute laid hold of one of my hands,
and I had but just time to withdraw it,
when the door flew open to give entrance
to the two ladies and the good man: the
latter lifting up both his hands, as if conscious
of having done something wrong,
with a good-humoured freedom, asked
pardon; but with a look that seemed to indicate,
he thought the apology necessary
both to Mr. Arnold and me.  This disconcerted
me more; my mother smiled, and
lady Grimston drew up her long neck, and
winked at the dean.  I took up my hat,
that lay in a window, without well-knowing
what I did, and said, I would wait on

<pb n="174"/>
them into the garden.  Mr. Arnold followed
my example; but looked at me, I
do not know how&mdash;impertinently&mdash;as if
he thought I did not dislike him.  I took
one turn with them, and then slipped
away under pretence of going in to dress.
I ran directly into Mrs. Vere's room, and
told her what had passed between Mr. Arnold
and me.  She laughed, and said,
she could have told me long ago it would
have come to that.  I knew Mr. Arnold
admired you, said she, the first time I
saw you in his company; he is no contemptible
conquest I can tell you.  He
assured my mother, that you were the
only woman he ever saw in his life that
had made an impression on him; and I
am inclined to believe him, for he is not
a man of an amorous complexion; nor
did I ever hear of his making his addresses
to any one, though he might have his
choice of the best fortunes, and the best
families in the county; for the ladies, I
must inform you, admire him exceedingly;
and when you are known to be his choice,
you will be the envy of all the young

<pb n="175"/>
women in the county.  I sighed (I don't
know why) and said, I desired not to
create envy on that account.  Mrs. Vere
said, why really Miss Bidulph, if your
heart is at liberty, I know of no man
more worthy of it than Mr. Arnold; but
perhaps (looking with a kind earnestness
on me) that may not be your case.  I
told her my heart was not engaged (as it
really is not; for indeed, Cecilia, I do not
think of Mr. Faulkland); but that I did
not find in myself any great inclination
towards Mr. Arnold.  Oh, my dear, said
she, if you find no disinclination, it is
enough.  I married for love, yet I was
far from being happy.  The vexation
that I occasioned in my own and my
husband's family, was a counter-balance
to the satisfaction of possessing the man I
loved.  Mr. Arnold, besides being very
amiable in his person, has good sense and
good temper; and if you marry him with
nothing more than indifference, gratitude
will soon produce love, in such a breast as
yours.  Were there any thing like aversion

<pb n="176"/>
in your heart, then indeed it would
be criminal in you to accept of him.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Vere delivered her sentiments
with such a calm sweetness, such a disinterested
sincerity, that what she said made
an impression on me.  We are apt, contrary
as it may seem to reason, to be more
wrought upon by the opinion and advice
of young people like ourselves, than by
that of persons whose experience certainly
gives them a better right to form judgments:
but we have a sort of a natural
repugnance to the being dictated to,
even by those who have an authority to
do it; and as age gives a superiority, every
thing that comes from it carries a sort of
air of prescribing, which we are wonderfully
inclined to reject.
</p>
<p>Had lady Grimston said this to me, it
would have put me upon my guard, as
suspecting a design on my liberty of choice.
Even my good mother might have been
listened to on this subject not without uneasiness;
though my duty to her would
not suffer me to give her a moment's pain,
unless I was sure that my eternal as well as
temporal happiness was at stake.

<pb n="177"/>
</p>
<p>I told Mrs. Vere that I had no aversion
to Mr. Arnold; on the contrary, that if I
had a sister, I should wish her married to
him.  Now, my Cecilia, the mischief of
it is, there <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be no reasonable objection
made to him: he is a very tolerable
man; but I knew a man once that I liked
better&mdash;but fie, fie upon him!  I am
sure I ought not to like him, and therefore
I will not.  I am positive, if I were
let alone, I should be as happy as ever.
</p>
<p>I told you I got a letter from my brother;
he says in it, he has had one from
Mr. Faulkland, who is now in your part
of the world.  He tells Sir George, that
'that if my lady Bidulph will be so good as
to see Miss B. and converse with her,
he is not without hopes that she may so
far exculpate him, as to induce my lady
to repeal his sentence of banishment.'
Sir George adds his own wishes for this,
but says (go give you <hi rend="italic">his</hi> words) he fears
the wench will not be honest enough to
do Faulkland justice&mdash;Justice! what
can my brother mean by this?  How ungenerous
these men are, even the best of

<pb n="178"/>
them, in love matters!  He knows the
poor girl doats on her destroyer, and
might perhaps take shame to <hi rend="italic">herself</hi>, rather
than throw as much blame on him as
he deserves.  I think this is all the justice
that can be expected from her; and how
poor an extenuation would this make of
his guilt!  It would only add to the merit
of <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sufferings, without lessening his
fault.
</p>
<p>To what purpose then would it be?  I
know my mother's sentiments already on
that head.  I would not shew Sir George's
letter to her, he had said so many ridiculous
things about lady Grimston in it,
which I know would have offended her
highly; otherwise, on account of Mr.
Faulkland's paragraph, I should have
been glad she had seen it.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d51">
	<head><date value="1703-09-12"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 12.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Ah, my sister! my
friend!  What shall I do?  Oh that officious
lady Grimston&mdash;What ill star
drove me to her house?  Nothing would
serve her but she must know what Mr.
Arnold said to me in the drawing-room

<pb n="179"/>
conference; and how I had behaved.  She
made her inquiry before my mother and
the dean, after I had left them in the
garden.  What could the man do?  He
had no reason to conceal what passed, and
frankly owned he had made me an offer
of his heart.  Well, and how did miss
receive it, asked lady Grimston?  With
that modesty and polite sweetness that she
does every thing, answered Mr. Arnold.
He could say no less, you know.
</p>
<p>He thence took occasion to apply particularly
to my mother, apologizing at
the same time for his not having done it
before.  What the self-sufficient creature
added, I know not; for my mother, from
whom I had this account, did not repeat
all he said; but it seems it was enough
to make her imagine I had not heard him
reluctantly, and accordingly she gave
him her permission to win me and wear
me.
</p>
<p>I could cry for very vexation to be
made such a puppet of.  This eclaircissement
I dreaded before I had time to explain
myself to my mother.  The best of

<pb n="180"/>
women, still anticipating what I had to
say, congratulated me on my extraordinary
prudence, in not letting a childish,
misplaced attachment keep such a hold
on my heart, as to make me blind to the
merits of a more deserving object.
</p>
<p>Dear madam, said I, sure Mr. Arnold
did not say, that I had encouraged his addresses.
Encouraged, my dear! why
sure the hearing, from a young lady of
your education, is encouragement enough
to a man of sense.&mdash;I heard him with
complaisance, madam, because I thought
<hi rend="italic">that</hi> due to him; but I had not time to
tell him, that it was my wish to remain
single, at least for some time.  My mother
look surprized.  "Sidney, this is
not what I expected from you; I flattered
myself you thought no longer of Mr.
Faulkland."
</p>
<p>She contracted her brow a little.
Madam, I do not; indeed I think no more
of him; but may I not be permitted to
continue as I am?
</p>
<p>Had you never had any engagement
with Mr. Faulkland, answered my mother,

<pb n="181"/>
I should be far from urging you on this
occasion; but, circumstanced as you now
are, I think your honour is concerned.
</p>
<p>Lady Grimston has put your affair in
such a light to me, as I never considered
it in before.  How mortifying must the
reflection be, my dear, to think that it
may be said Mr. Faulkland perhaps flew
off, from some disadvantageous circumstance
he discovered in regard to you.  The
world wants not envious malicious tongues
enough to give it this turn.  Your unlucky
illness, and your brothers ill-timed
assiduity in going so often to him when
he was at Richmond, looks as if we had
been endeavouring to recal him.  Every
body knows the marriage was almost concluded;
and lady Grimston, though she
thinks our reasons for breaking it off
were extremely cogent, yet as she knows
the world well, thinks it has not virtue
enough to believe those to be the true
reasons, and that it will be much more
apt to put an invidious construction on
the affair, that may be very detrimental
to you in your future prospects.  These

<pb n="182"/>
considerations alone ought to determine
you; but there is one still of greater
moment, which I hope, from the goodness
of your heart, will have still greater
weight with you.  That unfortunate
young lady, who <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be the wife of
Mr. Faulkland if you were once put
beyond the reach even of his most distant
hope, would stand the better chance
for having justice done to her; at least it
would leave him void of that pretence
which he at first pleaded, and which probably
he will continue to do, while
you remain single.  Think seriously of
the matter, my love.  I shall only add,
that Mr. Arnold is every way an unexceptionable
match, and that your acceptance
of him will be extremely agreeable
to me; as, ont he contrary, your refusal
will give an uneasiness to your indulgent
mother, which she never yet experienced
from you.
</p>
<p>She left me with these cruel words;
cruel in their kindness&mdash;Oh! she knows
I am flexible by nature, and to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> will
yielding as air.  What can I do?  My

<pb n="183"/>
heart is not in a disposition to love&mdash;Yet,
again and again I repeat it, Mr. Faulkland
has no interest there.  What he once
had he has lost; but I cannot compel it to
like and unlike, and like anew at pleasure.
Fain would I bring myself chearfully
to conform to my mother's will, for
I have no will of my own.  I never knew
what it was to have one, and never shall,
I believe; for I am sure I will not contend
with a husband.
</p>
<p>I have told Mrs. Vere what my mother
said to me; she is intirely of her mind;
every body is combined against me; I am
treated like a baby, that knows not what
is fit for it to choose or to reject.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d52">
	<head><date value="1703-09-15"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 15.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have been searching
my heart, my dear Cecilia, to try if
there remained a lurking particle of my
former flame unextinguished; a flame I
call it, as we are allowed the metaphor;
but it never rose to <hi rend="italic">that</hi>; it was but a
single ray, a gentle glow that just warmed
my breast without scorching: what it
might have arisen to, I will not say; but

<pb n="184"/>
I have the satisfaction to find, that the
short-lived fire is quite extinct, and the
mansion is even chilled with cold.
</p>
<p>This was a very necessary scrutiny before
I would even entertain a thought of
Mr. Arnold; and believe me, had I
found it otherwise than I say, I would
rather have hazarded my mother's displeasure
by owning the truth to her, than
injure any man, by giving him my hand
with an estranged heart.
</p>
<p>I will acknowlege to you, my sister,
that it was not without a struggle I reduced
my mind to this frame.  My heart
(foolish thing!) industrious to perplex itself,
would fain have suggested some palliating
circumstances in Mr. Faulkland's
favour; but I forbid it to interpose.
Trifler, said I, let your guardian, your
proper guide, judge and determine for
you in this important cause, whereon so
much of your future peace depends.  It
sighed, but had the virtue to submit; and
I arraigned Faulkland before a little tribunal
in my breast, where I would suffer
reason only to preside.  The little felon,

<pb n="185"/>
love, knocked at the door once or twice,
but justice kept him out; and after a long
(and I think a fair) trial, he was at length
cast; and in order to strengthen my resolves,
and justify my mother's, as well
as my own conduct, these are the arguments
which I have deduced from the
evidences against him.
</p>
<p>If Mr. Faulkland feared the frailty of
his virtue, why did he not fly when he
was first alarmed with the knowlege of
the lady's passion for him?  If not for his
own sake, yet at least for her's.  If he
could not return her love, was he not
cruel in suffering her to feed a hopeless
flame?  But since his evil fate urged him
on, and the unhappy girl lost her honour,
was he not bound to repair it?  He had
never seen me at that time, was under no
personal engagements to me, and might
easily have acquitted himself to my brother,
from so justifiable a motive.
</p>
<p>What if I had married him, ignorant
of this secret, and it had afterwards come
to my ears, how miserable would it have
made me, to think that I had stood between

<pb n="186"/>
an unfortunate young creature and
her happiness?  For had Mr. Faulkland
never heard of me, had he not been prejudiced
in my favour, this young woman's
beauty and innocence (which he acknowleges)
might have then engaged his
honest vows; the wicked aunt would not
have been tempted to betray her trust,
nor he (shocking thought! whenever it
recurs) to buy that favour he might have
obtained on virtuous terms.  His prior
engagements to my brother was the fatal
plea that undid them both!  Had he not
been furnished with this excuse, her hopes
might have supported her virtue; or, if
ignorant of this, she fell, what pretence
could he offer, after the injury <hi rend="italic">was</hi> done,
for not fulfilling an obligation of so much
more importance?  I could not have suffered
by not obtaining a man I never saw;
Miss B. is undone by losing him: Yet his
word to Sir George, the breach of which
could have been attended with no ill consequence,
was to be preferred to an act
of justice.  This is that false honour upon
which the men pique themselves so much.

<pb n="187"/>
An innocent child stigmatized; an amiable
woman abandoned to shame and
grief!  I thank heaven I made not myself
accessary to this.  <hi rend="italic">Had</hi> I married Mr.
Faulkland, <hi rend="italic">knowing</hi> his fault, I could not
say so, nor have blamed any thing but
my own imprudence, if <hi rend="italic">I</hi> in my turn
found myself deserted.  Who knows but
he might (after having bound me in
chains) return to his neglected mistress;
and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> love, which, when it would have
been meritorious in him, he disrelished,
he might have pursued with eagerness
when interdicted.  This might have been
the case.  I believe you may remember
an instance of it among our own acquaintance.
Mr. Saunders, who refused a young
lady for his bride, from an absolute dislike
of her person, took uncommon pains
to debauch her when she became the wife
of his friend.  Had Mr. Faulkland so
behaved, what a wretch would it have
made me!  You know I have not a grain
of jealousy in my composition, yet I am
sure a neglect of this kind would make
me very miserable.

<pb n="188"/>
</p>
<p>You have not forgot, I believe, that
about two years ago there was a match
proposed to my mother by the bishop of
B. between me and his nephew.  The
young man was heir to a good fortune,
was reckoned handsome and accomplished,
and I think he really was so: I was
intirely free from prepossessions in favour
of any one, and had no objection to him,
but that I knew he had a most lamentably-vulnerable heart, for he had been
in love with two or three women of my
acquaintance.  My mother mentioned
him to me upon the good old prelate's
recommendation, and I gave her this as
my reason for disliking the offer, which
she approved of so intirely, that the thing
went no farther.  Indeed I think that
woman is a fool who risques her contentment
with one of a light disposition.  Marriage
will not change mens natures; and
it is not every one who has virtue or prudence
enough to be reclaimed.  Upon the
whole, I am satisfied with my lot; and
am sure I could hear with pleasure, that
Mr. Faulkland was married to that Miss B.

<pb n="189"/>
I wish I knew the other letters that compose
her name.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d53">
	<head><date value="1703-09-16"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 16.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>My mother asked me
to-day, Had I considered of what she had
been saying to me?  I told her I had, and
only begged a little more time. She
kissed me with tears in her eyes.  To be
sure, my dear, as much as you can reasonably
desire.  I know my Sidney is
above trifling.  Mrs. Vere was present
when my mother left the room.  Oh, Miss
Bidulph, said she, who would refuse to
gratify such a parent as that?  Had <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
mother condescended to treat me so, I am
sure she could have wrought on me to do
any thing she liked, even though it had
been repugnant to my inclination.  Dear
madam, I replied, how sweetly you inforce
my duty&mdash;Yes, I will obey that kindest,
best of mothers.  I believe I spoke this,
tho' without intending it, in a tone that
implied something like making a merit of
this concession; for Mrs. Vere immediately
answered, There's a good child!
that, to oblige its mamma, will accept

<pb n="190"/>
of a very handsome young gentleman,
with a good estate, and one that many a
girl in England would give her eyes for.
I felt the rebuke; but turning it off with
a smile, said, but you forget, my dear, that
I am not dying for him.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d54">

<p>How will you plume
yourself on your sagacity, Cecilia, when
you read this account of my love, which
you so wisely foretold?  I can tell you
I am trying to like Mr. Arnold as fast
as I can; I make him sing and play for
this purpose from morning till night,
for he is here every day, and all day.
Lady Grimston holds her head a quarter
of a yard higher than she did before; and
looks, as who should say, it was <hi rend="italic">I</hi> that
brought this about.  The dean is as frolick
as May-day upon it; for he is very
fond of Mr. Arnold; but tells him he
will not forgive him for robbing him of
his second wife; for such he says he intended
me.  I think his daughter (a pretty
girl of about seventeen) looks a little
grave of late.  I hope she does not like

<pb n="191"/>
Mr. Arnold herself.  I wish my mother
would take it into her head that she was
in love with him, and that Mr. Arnold
had promised to marry her; then should
I a second time crown me with a willow
garland.  But there is no fear of this, or
rather no hope.
</p>
<p>Lady Grimston has given my mother
<hi rend="italic">such</hi> a character of Mr. Arnold, that if
you will take her word for it, there is not
a man like him in the world; and my mother
firmly believes every syllable she says.
She told me to-day she would write to
Sir George, to give him an account of
the matter, and desire his advice.  This
is a compliment she would not omit paying
for any consideration, tho' I know
my brother's judgment has now lost all
credit with her; and that, let his opinion
be what it will, she is firmly resolved on
her new plan.  Knowing as you do my
mother's firmness when once she is possessed
with a thing, you will not wonder that
I did not make attempts to alter her
mind, which I knew would be fruitless.
She likes Mr. Arnold prodigiously; she

<pb n="192"/>
piques herself on her skill in physiognomy,
and says, if she is deceived in this
gentleman, she will never again rely on
that science.  Lady Grimston is so fond
of him, that I wonder she did not marry
him herself.

<opener>Madam,</opener>

<p>I thank you for the honour you do me
in asking my advice, in regard to the
proposal of marriage you have received
for my sister; but I am intirely disqualified
from giving you any, as I am an absolute
stranger both to the person and
character of the gentleman you mention;
and know no more of him, than that I
have heard there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> such a person, who
has some estate in the county where you
now are.
</p>
<p>As you are absolute mistress of your
daughter's will, as well as of her person,

<pb n="193"/>
I shall not presume to interfere in this
nice point.  If the marriage is not <hi rend="italic">already</hi>
agreed upon (which may be the case, notwithstanding
the compliment you dome
the favour to pay me) I think it would
be generous in you to see Miss B. and
hear what she has to say, before you proceed
farther; but in this, as in every thing
else, your own discretion must guide you.

<p>My mother was exceedingly displeased
with this letter.  She said Sir George had
a haughtiness in him that was very offensive

in applying to him, and shall give
myself no farther trouble about him or
his opinion.  As for Miss B. I think she
can hardly be under a necessity of coming
to town as yet, and that affair may keep
cold, for I have but little curiosity to hear

<opener>Dear Sidney,</opener>
<lb/>
<p>I received with concern (though I
own not with surprize) an account from
my mother of a new treaty of marriage
that is on foot between you and a Mr.
Arnold, of whom I know nothing.
Instead of congratulating you on this occasion,
I cannot help condoling with you;
for I have a better opinion of your heart
than to suppose it can have so soon renounced
poor Faulkland.  I do not reproach
you for your acquiescence in
giving him up: I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you could not do
otherwise; but why in the name of precipitancy
are you to be hurried into wedlock
already?  You went into the country
to recover your health, I thought; prithee,
how comes this new husband into
your way?  I know, child, it is not of your
seeking, and do from my heart pity you.

<p>I would by no means have you guilty
of a breach of duty to our mother: but
for heaven's sake, why don't you try
your influence over her, to have this sudden
scheme of matrimony suspended, till
she sees and talks to this girl that Faulkland
refers her to?  If the wench owns
that he was not to blame so much as she
herself was, and relinquishes all pretensions
to him, don't you think she (my
mother I mean) would in that case remain
bound in honour to yield you to his prior
claim?
</p>
<p>Indeed, Sidney, I must blame you for
this part of your conduct; it looks like
a strange insensibility in you.
</p>
<p>I know you will urge your perfect submission
to your mother's will; and I
know too, that <hi rend="italic">will</hi> is as absolute as that
of an Eastern monarch.  I therefore repeat
it, I do not mean to reproach you with
your compliance, but I am vexed to the
heart, and must give it vent.
</p>
<p>I see plainly that old piece of formality,
lady Grimston's infernal shrivelled
pay in all this.  For my mother of herself,

<pb n="196"/>
I am sure, would not have thought of disposing
of you, without your liking, so
soon after an affair that had created you so
much uneasiness, unless it had been suggested
to her by somebody.  Prithee
tell me what sort of a man this Arnold
really is, for I do not depend on the partial
representations I have had of him.
</p>
<p>I wish Miss B. were come to town,
but she is not yet arrived.  I inquired for
her of Faulkland's housekeeper, by the
name of Jefferis.  The woman is at the
house at Putney waiting to receive her,
but does not know how soon she will
come.  Would she had been buried before
Faulkland saw her!
</p>
<p>I shall expect a letter from you soon.
How comes it that you never mentioned
Mr. Arnold to me in any that you have
writ?  But I excuse you, and am

<p>You see this is Sir George himself, my

<opener>Dear Brother,</opener>
<lb/>
<p>I thank you for your condolements, but
can assure you my heart is not in such a
situation as to require any.  I own I had
all the esteem for Mr. Faulkland which
I thought his merit deserved.  Duty to
my good mother, and an undeniable blemish
in his character, first wrought a
change in my sentiments towards him:

<pb n="198"/>
my own peace of mind now requires me
to improve that change into indifference.
</p>
<p>You do me justice in supposing that
I should never think of seeking a husband;
and you have formed as right a
judgment in regard to lady Grimston's
being the promoter of this union.  As
for Mr. Arnold, though perhaps (had I
never known your friend) he might not
have been the man of my choice, yet
have I no dislike to him.  I believe him to
be a very worthy gentleman; and that
my mother has not been partial in her
representations.  I am sure, at least, she
has said nothing of him but what she has
seen or been told, and has good reason to
believe.
</p>
<p>I wish, dear brother, you had writ with
more caution, that I might have laid before
my mother what you said in relation
to Miss B.  It may have its weight with
me, though I cannot answer for its
having any with her.  Do you forget her
having told me, that she conceived a sort
of horror at the thoughts of my marrying
Mr. Faulkland?  She cannot but be

<pb n="199"/>
sensible, that Miss B. is not without her
share of blame in that affair which has
so perplexed us all.  But you know too
that does not exculpate Mr. Faulkland.
The young lady's relinquishing her hopes
(for a claim I think she does not make)
would only the more excite my mother's
compassion, and interest her in her favour.
To sum up the whole in one word, my
mother is resolved, and you yourself acknowlege
that her will is absolute.  She
has used the most irresistible argument to
obtain my consent, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>, that it would
make <hi rend="italic">her</hi> happy.  Spare then, my dear
brother, unkind reflections on any part of
my behaviour; for I am determined to
pursue, through life, that rule of conduct
which I have hitherto invariably adhered
to; I mean, that of preferring to my own
the happiness of those who are most dear
to me.

<p>Mr. Arnold has so
many advocates here, that his interest cannot
fail of being promoted.  Mrs. Vere

<pb n="200"/>
admires him; the Dean commends him;
my mother praises him; lady Grimston
extols him to the skies.  No one is silent,
but the young girl that I mentioned to
you before; she only colours and hangs
down her head when he is spoken of.  I
really begin to fear that the poor thing
loves him; but he never made any addresses
to her, and I hope does not suspect
it.
</p>
<p>Things are now gone so far, that my
mother and lady Grimston talked to-day
of settlements.  Mr. Arnold receives but
twelve hundred pounds a year from his
estate; his brother's widow, as I have already
told you, having a jointure upon it
of three hundred pounds a year.  She
lives intirely in London, and is, I am told,
a very imprudent woman, and not at all
esteemed by the family.  The elder Mr.
Arnold and she were married several
years, but never had a child; the last
two years of his life his wife and he
lived separate, her conduct having given
room for some suspicions very injurious
to her husband's honour.

<pb n="201"/>
</p>
<p>The Arnold estate was originally a
very considerable one, but has been dissipated
by the extravagance of the successive
possessors.  What remains, however, is
quite clear, and is likely to be kept so by
the good management of the present owner.
His late brother was exceedingly remiss
in his affairs, and spent most of his time
in London; and if it had not been for
Mr. Arnold, the mansion-house would
have fallen to the ground; but his brother
lent it to him, and he kept it in repair for
his own use, as he is fond of the place:
though he has a pretty house in Kent, belonging
to another estate of abut three
hundred pounds a year, which came to
him by his mother, for he is the son of
a second marriage.  And this, till his
brother's death, was the whole of his income;
but he is so good an oeconomist,
that he always made a genteeller figure
on his three hundred pounds a year, than
his brother did on twelve.
</p>
<p>My mother, who you know is integrity
itself, thinks that I ought not to have
more settled on me than the widow of Mr.
<pb n="202"/>
Arnold's brother had, whose fortune was
superior to mine.  Mr. Arnold makes
a much handsomer proposal; lady Grimston
is for laying hold of it.  The dean
was for striking a medium.  I do not
care how they settle it; but I fancy my
mother will have her own way in this.
</p>
<p>She purposes going to town next week,
that the wedding&mdash;(bless me! whose
wedding is it that I am talking of so
coolly?) well&mdash;that it may be celebrated
in her own house.  This to be sure will
send Sir George directly out of it.  I cannot
help it; I am born to give, and to receive
vexation.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold speaks of taking a house
in London, where my mother is to have
an apartment whenever she chooses to be
in town.  This is a pleasing circumstance
to me; and she likewise proposes our being
sometimes with her at Sidney Castle.
That is a prospect which loses much of
its charms, by the reflection that my dear
Cecilia is not there.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d62">
	<head><date value="1703-10-01"><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>All preliminaries are
settled.  There has been a fuss with parchments

<pb n="203"/>
this week past.  My mother has
carried her point in regard to the jointure;
and has made choice of that little
estate in Kent to be settled on me, as it
is a complete three hundred pounds a
year, detached intirely from the rest, and
has a pretty house on it.  This was all
she would accept of, though, to do Mr.
Arnold justice, he would have been much
more liberal; but, my mother says, a
single woman, bred in retirement as I
have been, who cannot live on that, does
not deserve to live at all; adding, that as
the estate was already subject to one jointure,
and the widow so young a woman;
if it should be also my misfortune to become
one early, a great part of the fortune
would be swallowed by dowagers,
and the heir not have enough to support
his rank.

<p>This morning my mother,
lady Grimston, the dean, and Mr.
Arnold (who is the idol of them all) took
a rumbling together in the old coach, by
way of taking the air, in a dusty road,

<pb n="204"/>
and what do you think was the result of
their deliberations in this jaunt?  Why
truly lady Grimston, proud of her handywork,
would needs see it accomplished;
and nothing will serve her, but I must be
married at her house.  My mother opposed
it at first; but the Dean seconded
the proposal, that he might have (as he
expressed himself) the satisfaction of contributing
<hi rend="italic">himself</hi> to make Mr. Arnold
happy; and Mr. Arnold (audaciously expecting,
I suppose, that this would hasten
the ceremony) joined his intreaties so effectually,
that my mother was obliged to
yield.
</p>
<p>What a tormenting old woman is this
lady Grimston!  I hoped, at least, for
the respite of a month, by getting to London.
I thought first to have delayed the
time of our going to town, and then to
have faddled away a good while longer
under pretence of preparations; though
there is but little room for that now, as
all my fineries, destined I thought to
another purpose, are lying quietly in my
trunks at home.  But then one might

<pb n="205"/>
have contrived many little occasions of
delay.  There was a house to be fixed
upon, and I had twenty things to do;
and, as my mother says, many things fall
out between the cup and the lip.  But all
my expectations are blown away, and I
have but one poor fortnight given me to
recollect my scattered thoughts, when
they are all to be centered in Mr. Arnold.
I am not merry, my Cecilia, but I am
determined not to appear sad; neither
am I so; I hope I have no reason.
</p>
<p>My mother purposes writing again to
Sir George, to desire his presence at my
marriage.  I hope he will behave respectfully
to every one here, if he should come.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d64">

<p>Mr. Arnold has writ to
town, to bespeak a new chariot; he will
do nothing in regard to the house, till I
am on the spot to please myself.  I intend
sending Patty to town to bring me down
my bridal trappings.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold has given some necessary
orders for the new decking of his person,
as well as some of the apartments in the

<pb n="206"/>
old mansion-house, which seem a little to
want refurnishing; most of the goods having
been inhabitants there since the time
of his great grandfather.

<p>A week, but a short week, to come,

will soon have an indisputable right to it;
and it is my firm purpose to use my utmost
endeavours to give him intire possession

my esteem.  If his talents are not so glittering
as I have seen some others possessed
of, he is nevertheless master of an exceedingly
good understanding, which a sort of
diffidence in his manner does not suffer
him to shew at once to the best advantage.
His temper is extremely sweet, and
he seems to have an openness of heart
(when he throws off a little shyness which
he has contracted) that is exceedingly engaging.
His love for me appears as fervent

Miss B. to interpose.  Mr. Arnold seems
to be one of those who are born to pass
quietly through life.  He has already attained
to the age of thirty, without one
event ever happening to him, but such as
happen to every man every day.  May
no future storm ever interrupt his or my
tranquility; for they will soon be one and

<p>The die is thrown,
my Cecilia, and thy Sidney is the wife of
Mr. Arnold!  This day we were married;
the good Dean joined our hands, and his

<pb n="209"/>
daughter was one of my bride-maids.
The poor girl was taken ill during the ceremony,
and was obliged to leave the
church, which has confirmed me in my suspicions
&mdash;Oh, how I pity her!  I believe
indeed she only feigned illness for an excuse
to retire.  Mrs. Vere went out with
her; but she would not suffer her to attend
her home.  She promised to dine
with us, if she should be better; and so
she did, and seemed chearful and pretty
well; but I thought she looked as if she
had been crying.  She made my heart
ach&mdash;but I am in hopes it is but a slight
would; she is exceedingly lively, and I
dare say will soon get the better of it.
</p>
<p>Lady Grimston was downright tiresome
with her compliments; and preached an
hour long about the duty of children to
their parents; and how good a wife that
woman was likely to make, who had always
been exemplary in her filial obedience.
Ah! lady Grimston, thought I,
by what I have heard of you, you did not
seem to number obedience among wife-like virtues in your own case, though you

<pb n="210"/>
can preach it up to others.  But I knew
this sermon was chiefly intended for poor
Mrs. Vere's use.  My mother was all
kindness and complacency.  She seemed
so delighted, that I rejoiced in having
had it in my power to give her so much
happiness.  Lady Grimston did the honours
of her house on this occasion with
great magnificence, and I believe I need
not tell you, with most exquisite decorum.
Indeed this wedding was conducted
with such a decent festivity, so rationally
on all sides, and such a comfortable
privacy, that I was not half so much
shocked as I expected to have been.
</p>
<p>We have no company here besides the
family of the house, my dear good old
Dean, his lady and daughter, one young
lady more, and a relation of Mr. Arnold's;
a gentleman who came from London
on purpose to be present on this (as
it is called) joyful occasion.
</p>
<p>We shall leave this house to-morrow,
Mr. Arnold and I, I mean.  I am to be
put into possession of the old mansion of
Arnold-abbey.  Mr mother is to continue

<pb n="211"/>
with lady Grimston a week or a fortnight
longer, and then she goes to London, on
no other call, as she says, but to see and
administer comfort to poor Miss B. who
she supposes will be by that time come to
her retreat.
</p>
<p>I believe I shall remain in the country
while the weather continues pleasant, but
am not yet determined.

<p>We took leave of lady
Grimston this morning, or rather of her
house; for her ladyship, my dear mother,
and all the good folks that were our guests
at Grimston-hall, are to dine with us today
at Arnold-abbey.  I desired I might
be permited to go home without any
parade, and in as private a manner as possible;
for you know how I hate a bustle.
Mr. Arnold very obligingly indulged me
in this request, and conducted my sweet
Mrs. Vere and me home in his own
coach, at eight of the clock this morning.
I found every thing in exact order
at Arnold-abbey.  The house is very spacious
and convenient, though very old-
<pb n="212"/>
fashioned.  Some of the rooms however
are newly fitted up, perfectly neat and
handsome.  The servants are orderly and
well-behaved, and every thing seems to
be exactly well regulated.  You may be
sure I have taken my own Patty home
with me; I intend to constitute her house-keeper, and give her an additional salary
for her additional trouble.  Mr. Arnold
had nobody in that capacity before, as his
houshold had not been settled since the
acquisition of his fortune, and he reserved
the choosing of so material domestic to
me; but as I do not love to multiply
servants, and know that Patty is very capable
of the place, I shall take no other.

all the gentry in the neighbourhood
for some miles about have been to
pay us their compliments; at least, I
hope by this time they have <hi rend="italic">all</hi> been here,
for we have not had a minute to ourselves
these three days.  It will take me up ten
to return them, as many of the families
live at a good distance from hence.

<pb n="213"/>
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, whose mourning has been
laid aside since our wedding-day, seems
to have a very good taste in dress; he is
perfectly well shaped, and appears to
great advantage in colours; in short he
is more amiable than I thought he was.
It is with great pleasure that I observe
my young acquaintance, on whose heart
I feared Mr. Arnold had made an impression,
has recovered her usual vivacity.
With people extremely full of spirits,
love is not apt to sink very deep, or last
long, when it does not meet with a return.

<p>My Mother sets out for
London to-morrow, and Mr. Arnold has
proposed to me, that he and I should accompany
her.  He says, he wants to
look out for a house, and should like to
fix in one before the winter advances;
and that we may take up our abode at
my mother's till our house is ready for
us.  My mother is charmed at this proposal:
she dreads the thoughts of parting
with me; and as she intends going (after

<pb n="214"/>
a convenient stay in London) down to
Sidney Castle, if I remain here, our separation
must be immediate.  I know this
is Mr. Arnold's kind reason for desiring
me to go; he thinks I shall be less affected
at parting with my mother, when
in the midst of the various scenes which
London affords, than I should be if I
were to continue here.  He gives not this
for a reason, but I know it is his true
one; for he is not fond of London himself,
especially at a season of the year
when the country is so much more agreeable.
I thanked him for this mark of
his tenderness, and am determined to
go.

<p>Once more returned
to London in very good spirits, after a
stay of little more than two months in
Essex, in which time so material and unexpected
a change has been made in my
condition.
</p>
<p>Lady Grimston took a most affectionate
leave of my mother, and asked her, with
more tenderness than I thought her capable

<pb n="215"/>
of, How many ages it would be
before they should meet again?  As for
Mr. Arnold and me, she considers us as
her neighbours.  The Dean pleases himself
with that expectation too; and the
dear Mrs. Vere, who shed tears at bidding
me adieu, promises herself the happiness
(as she kindly expressed herself) of spending
many delightful days with me next
summer.  She set out on her return to
her own house, at the same time that we
left ours to go to town.
</p>
<p>My bother is still in Wiltshire; but I
find he did not leave town at the time
he mentioned in his letter to my mother,
nor for some days after.  This Patty
learnt from the servants; but I hope it
will not come to my mother's ears, for
she would take it extremely ill of him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, for the first time, mentioned,
that he was very much disappointed in
not having had the honour of seeing Sir
George at his house in the country; but
he hoped, when he came to town, his
brother and he should make up for this,
by being the more together.  I wish Sir

<pb n="216"/>
George may behave as he ought to this deserving
brother.  Mr. Arnold little imagines
how much he was an enemy to the
match, and much less his reason for it.
I should be very sorry Mr. Arnold were
to know how near I was being married to
another man; it might give a delicate
mind pain, lest there should remain any
traces of this former attachment in the
breast of a woman he loves; but I
hope there is no danger of his hearing of
it; certainly no one would be so indiscreet
as to mention it to him.  Mr. Arnold
has lived chiefly in the country, and may
never have heard of Mr. Faulkland, as
he was so short a time returned from his
travels, on which he had been absent
more than five years; and as he is now
out of the kingdom, probably he will
not be spoken of.  I have begged of my
mother, who is naturally communicative,
never to name Mr. Faulkland to Mr.
Arnold, and have given my reasons for
desiring this.  She says, she thinks it
would be better to tell him the whole affair
at once; but I cannot agree with her

<pb n="217"/>
in that opinion; and have at last prevailed
on her to promise me she will not speak
of it.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d74">

<p>My mother drove out
in my new chariot to-day (a very fine gay
one it is) and went to Putney to inquire
after Miss B. by the name of Mrs. Jefferis.
She soon found the house, a very neat
box, with a pretty garden behind it.
The door was opened by a servant maid;
and my mother being told the lady was
at home, sent in her name; and was immediately
conducted up stairs into a very
elegant little dressing-room, where the
lady was sitting at her toilet; and Mr.
Faulkland's housekeeper (whom my mother
had seen before) assisting to dress her
head.  On my mother's entering the
room, Miss B. Rose off her chair, and
soon discovered by her shape (for she was
without her stays) that it was high time
for her to seek a place of concealment.
The housekeeper immediately withdrew;
and the young lady seemed in the utmost
confusion; my mother says, she herself

<pb n="218"/>
was at a loss how to begin the conversation,
but Miss B. relieved her, and spoke
first.  She thanked her for the honour she
did her by so charitable a visit, which,
she said, Mr. Faulkland had long ago
made her hope for; and which she must
consider as the greatest consolation in her
present unhappy circumstances.
</p>
<p>My mother place herself by her.  Madam,
said she, Mr. Faulkland made it a
point with me before he left England,
that I should see you, and afford you all
the assistance in my power, or that you
should stand in need of.  You seem to be
commodiously situated here, and I understand
have a very careful good woman to
attend you.
</p>
<p>I have so, madam, she answered; but
the most material circumstance is wanting
to my relief: Mr. Faulkland!&mdash;He
is not here: Tears started into her eyes
as she spoke.  You were apprised of his
absence, said my mother, before you
came to town.  I was, madam, and with
the cause of it; she hung down her head,
and was silent.

<pb n="219"/>
</p>
<p>My mother reassumed the conversation.
She told her, she thought it a most providential
discovery, that had given her the
knowledge of Mr. Faulkland's ill behaviour
time enough to prevent his marriage
with her daughter; assuring her, she
would not, for the universe, have had me
the wife of a man under such ties, as she
must consider Mr. Faulkland to be.  Miss
B. brightened up a little upon my mother's
saying this.  Did Mr. Faulkland ever tell
you, madam, how the unhappy affair
happened?  Mr. mother told her, she
knew not particulars; that she had been
referred to her for a full explanation;
that Mr. Faulkland had always endeavoured
to excuse himself, and went so
far as to say, He was sure the lady herself
wold acquit him in a great measure.  Ah,
madam! Miss B. cried, and shook her
head.  'Tis as I expected, said my mother;
Mr. Faulkland is an ungenerous
man.  A young lady of your modest appearance,
I am sure, he just have taken
more pains to seduce, than he will acknowlege.
Miss B. blushed exceedingly&mdash;

<pb n="220"/>
Oh! madam, you have a charitable, generous
heart, I was <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> seduced.  I
knew it, replied my mother.  Did he
promise to marry you?  She coloured
deeper than before.  I will not accuse him
of that, madam.  My mother proceeded;
You have a relation, madam; I understand
she was accessary to your misfortune.
Yes, the barbarous woman, answered
the lady; she was the contriver of
my destruction; and if I could have
avoided it, I would never have seen her
face again.  Tears of grief and indignation
again burst from her eyes.  Have
comfort, madam, said my mother, all
may end well yet.  I can have no hopes,
answered Miss B.  Mr. Faulkland flies
me, you see, nor can I ever expect to recover
his heart, since so charming a young
lady, as I hear Miss Bidulph is, has possession
of it; and though your goodness
disappointed him in his late views, he
may not yet despair.  I found by this,
continued my mother, that Miss B. knew
nothing of your being married, and made
haste to tell her.  I never saw joy so

<pb n="221"/>
visible in a countenance.  She clasped her
hands together, Dear madam! what do
you tell me?  How you revive my drooping
heart! then I am not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> homeless,
there is a <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> in my favour.
</p>
<p>She then asked my mother, if Mr.
Faulkland had acquainted her with her
real name, or that of her relation.  My mother,
who had once or twice called her by
the name of Jefferis, assured her he had
not.  That was generous in him, said
she; he <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be generous in <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> points.
But I have no reason to conceal it from
so prudent and worthy a lady as you are;
my real name is Burchell; that of my
cruel relation I will forbear to mention,
out of respect to my good uncle, whose
wife she is.  Mr. Faulkland, she added,
left a bill of five hundred pounds with
his housekeeper, to provide every thing
for me that I should want; with assurances
that he would take the tenderest
care of&mdash;the poor young creature hesitated,
and could proceed no farther; but
my mother said she understood her
meaning.  They had a good deal more
discourse: my mother promised to see

<pb n="222"/>
her often during her confinement, and
took her leave.
</p>
<p>She tells me, she is exceedingly pretty,
and has such an air of innocence and simplicity,
as very much engages one in her
favour.
</p>
<p>I have set down this whole conversation,
with every other particular, exactly
as my mother related it.
</p>
<p>She, who has a most circumstantial
memory, repeated it word for word, and
I, from a custom of throwing upon paper
every thing that occurs to me, have habituated
myself to retain the minutest
things.
</p>
<p>I know not, my dear, whether you
will be of my opinion; but I cannot help
thinking, that there was something like
art in miss Burchells' behaviour, far from
that candour which Mr. Faulkland seemed
to expect from her.  My mother mentioned
the <hi rend="italic">pains</hi> that she supposed had
been taken to <hi rend="italic">seduce</hi> her; he deep blush
at this hint, makes me suspect that her
answer was not dictated by sincerity.  She
saw my mother was not acquainted with
particulars, and that she was willing to

<pb n="223"/>
pass a favourable judgment on her fault;
it looks to me as if she laid hold of this
prejudice&mdash;and yet she <hi rend="italic">owned</hi> that Mr.
Faulkland had never promised to marry
her&mdash;I know not what to think; but
there appears to me, upon the whole,
something evasive and disingenuous in
her conduct.  My mother, who is all
openness and integrity, saw it not in this
light.  But be it as it may, it is no
longer of consequence to me, which was
most to blame, the gentleman or the lady:
Miss Burchell is certainly the injured
person; perhaps I too may have wronged
her in my surmises; if I have, I beg her
pardon; the observations I have made on
her behaviour are only en passant, and I
do from my heart wish Mr. Faulkland
would make her his wife.  You may perceive,
from what I have told you, how
little this interview was likely to produce
in Mr. Faulkland's favour, had it even
been brought about sooner.  My mother
is now more than ever confirmed in her
opinion, that the poor young creature
has been deceived; and she prays, that

<pb n="224"/>
Mr. Faulkland may not be overtaken
with a judgment, which she thinks nothing
but his marrying the girl can avert.

<p>We have at length
fixed upon a house to our liking, a handsome
convenient one in St. James's-street.
We are preparing to get it furnished as
fast as we can, that we may go into
it; for if my brother should come
to town, I know <hi rend="italic">our</hi> being with my
mother will be an objection to his
lodging in her house: this I should be
sorry for, as she told him he might
make use of it while it remained in her
hands.

<div3 type="entry" id="d76">

<p>Thank my stars!  I
have got over the fatigue of receiving
and paying a second round of bridal
visits, and I am really so tired of it, that
uninviting as the season is, I could wish
myself in quiet at Arnold-Abbey; but I
cannot think of leaving London while
my mother continues in it, and she is now
resolved to do so till Miss Burchell, or

<pb n="225"/>
rather, on this occasion, Mrs. Jefferis, is
brought to-bed.  You can't imagine how
solicitous she is about her; every time
she sees her she seems more and more
pleased with her.  I am very glad it has
happened so, for the poor young woman's
sake; my mother is as warm in her attachments
as in her resentments.  She visits
her almost every second day; for the poor
thing it seems is ill at present, and can't
leave her chamber.  She tells me she is
extremely melancholy, and seems much
to dread the approaching hour.  I greatly
honour my good mother for her humanity
towards her: in her terrifying situation,
she must want the tenderness of a
well bred as well as a sensible friend; for
it must be a melancholy thing, in such
circumstances, to have no one about her
but servants, and those strangers too.
</p>
<p>She told my mother, that her altered
looks, and frequent sicknesses, gave her
aunt (who was privy to the cause of it
all) a pretence for asking her uncle's permission
for miss to go to Bath, which
she told him would do her more good

<pb n="226"/>
than any thing.  He consented, and supposed
she was actually gone thither under
the care of a lady, whom her aunt
named, who was really going there in order
to settle for life, and to whose house
she went for a day or two to give a colour
to this story.  Her aunt contrived that
she should not take any servant with her;
giving it for a reason, that as she might
be as well attended by the lady's servants
with whom she lodged, and be considered
by her as one of the family, a
maid would only be an unnecessary incumbrance.
She added, that her uncle
was so afflicted with the gout, that he
never stirred abroad, and saw very little
company, so that it was not likely he
should ever be undeceived.

<div3 type="entry" id="d77">
	<head><date value="1703-11-20"><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 20.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>We have just received
a very odd piece of news, that I
own has a little alarmed me.  It is, that
the widow of Mr. Arnold's brother is
found to be with child.  There was o
mention of this at the time her husband
died, nor indeed any cause to suspect it;

<pb n="227"/>
but the strongest presumptions in the
world to the contrary, as her husband and
she lived a-part.  It has not been even
whispered, till since our arrival in town.
The lady pretends that she was not conscious
of it herself till within this fortnight;
yet her husband has been dead four months.
This I am told is very possible, though
not very common.  She has herself wrote
a letter to Mr. Arnold, to inform him of
it; at the same time declaring, that she
and her late husband had been reconciled
a little before his death; and that, had he
recovered, she was to have lived with him
again.  All this is very strange.  The
elder Mr. Arnold killed himself with excessive
drinking.  His death approached
him by slow degrees; but as he could
never be persuaded to think it near, he
took not the least care either of his spiritual
or temporal concerns.  His brother was
in the country when he was seized with
his last illness, which he had precipitated
by some extravagant excess.  He was
almost at the last extremity before he
could be prevailed on to let a physician

<pb n="228"/>
attend him, or suffer his brother to be
sent for.  In regard to the latter, he
told those about him, that as he was
his heir, of course he had made no
will.  He mentioned not his wife.  The
jointure which had been settled on her,
he allowed her for a separate maintenance.
They had for a long time pursued separate
pleasures, and not of his friends
knew that they had ever met, or so much
as seen one another from the time they
parted.  My Mr. Arnold arrived in town
just time enough to close his brother's
eyes; he was speechless when he came,
and expired in less than an hour after he
entered his chamber.
</p>
<p>As his wife had been very obnoxious
to the family, there was little notice taken
of her by them, more than what common
forms require.  She seemed as indifferent
about the death of her husband, as she
had been towards him in his life-time; and
did not then hint a word of this reconciliation
between them, or of her having had
an interview with him.  I am told, she is
a very weak, as well as a very loose woman;
and Mr. Arnold thinks she has got

<pb n="229"/>
into the hands of some designing person.
However that matter may be, it is a
serious affair; and he designs to take the
opinion of an eminent lawyer upon it.
My poor dear mother is frightened sadly.
If this child should make its appearance
in the world time enough to prove the
possibility of its being the offspring of
the last Mr. Arnold, she says, it must be
considered by the law as his heir, notwithstanding
the husband and wife lived
apart.  Mr. Arnold laughs, or affects
to laugh at this; we shall, however, wait
with patience till the lady is brought to-bed.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d78">
	<head><date value="1703-11-25"><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 25.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Our house is intirely
fitted up, and we shall remove into it
this evening; my mother chooses to continue
in her own, though Mr. Arnold
presses her to accept of an apartment in
ours; but we shall be near neighbours,
and she does not like to change.
</p>
<p>We have received the opinion of
our lawyers, who tell us, that in case
the child should be born within such a

<pb n="230"/>
period of time, as to give colour to its
claim, yet the lady must prove her assertion,
in regard to the pretended meeting
between her and her husband; which
it is imagined is not in her power to
do; and her indifferent character, together
with several favourable circumstances
which Mr. Arnold has on his side,
makes them quite sanguine in their expectations
of overturning her claim.  We are,
however, likely to be engaged in a disagreeable
law-suit; but as M. Arnold
seems perfectly easy about the issue of it,
I will make myself so too.

<p>I am more and more
reconciled to my lot, my dear Cecilia,
every day that I live.  Mr. Arnold's assiduity
and tenderness towards me deserve
the gratefullest return my heart can make
him; and I am convinced it is not necessary
to be passionately in love with the man
we marry, to make us happy.  Constancy,
good sense, and a sweet temper, must
form a basis for a durable felicity.  The
two latter I am sure Mr. Arnold possesses;

<pb n="231"/>
Oh, may I never experience his want of
the former; I hope my own conduct will
for ever ensure to me his love.  That
can only secure the tranquillity of my future
days.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d80">

<p>My brother arrived
in town last night; and came this morning
in company with my mother (and I am
sure at her request) to make us a formal
visit.  My kind Mr. Arnold received him
with tenderness; Sir George was coldly
polite.  He owned, however, to my mother,
upon her asking him his opinion of
his brother-in-law, that he seemed to be
a <hi rend="italic">good clever sort of a fellow</hi>.  I wish I
could cultivate a friendship between them;
it will not be Mr. Arnold's fault if there
is not; but Sir George, you know, is
not of a very pliant disposition.
</p>
<p>He asked my mother, when they were
alone, Whether she had yet seen Miss B. or
Mrs. Jefferis (for he knew her by no other
name) and what she had to say for herself?
My mother told him, he had better
not touch upon that string.  I will be
<pb n="232"/>
hanged, replied Sir George, if the artful
young baggage has not imposed upon
you.  My mother, who is always angry
at having her sagacity called in question,
told Sir George he was rude, and she
should give him no satisfaction on that
head.  My brother answered, as it was
<hi rend="italic">now</hi> of no consequence what the wench
affirmed or denied, he had no farther
curiosity about her.  My mother called
him a bear, and so the enquiry ended.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d81">
	<head><date value="1703-12-20"><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 20.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I congratulate you,
my sister, my friend, my ever beloved Cecilia.
Happy! happy may you be in your
nuptials! but in the midst of my joy for
your being so nobly and worthily bestowed,
self love forces a sigh from me.  I
have lost the pleasing hope of seeing you
at the time fixed for your return.  The
station your husband holds at the court
of Vienna, will, I fear, long detain my
beloved in a foreign land.  But you are
not amongst strangers; a husband, a
brother, and tender parent, must make
every part of the globe equally your

<pb n="233"/>
home.  I will therefore seek for my contentment
in yours, and rest satisfied with
believing that you will always continue
to love me.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d82">
	<head><date value="1704-01-10"><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 10, 1703-4.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I begin to find
my thoughts so much dissipated, that I am
angry with myself; Mr. Arnold's excessive
indulgence will spoil me; he is always
contriving new scenes of pleasure, and
hurries me from one to the other.  I do
not wish to be perpetually fluttering
about.  The calm domestic life you know
was always my choice; but I will not oppose
my kind Mr. Arnold in his fond desire
of pleasing me: besides, I find that
by his constantly gallanting me to public
places, he begins himself to acquire a
sort of relish for them, which he did
not use to have: at least his prudence
made him so to conform to the necessity
of his circumstances, while his fortune
was small, that he never indulged himself
in any of the fashionable expensive
amusements; nor does he now in any
but such as I partake of with him.  I

<pb n="234"/>
find he is by nature open and liberal to
excess.  I must take care, without his being
conscious of it, to be a gentle check
upon his bounteous spirit; I mean only
so far as it regards myself: indeed this is
the most material point, for in every other
instance his generosity is regulated by prudence.
I am every hour more obliged
to him, and should hate myself if I did
not find that he had an intire possession of
my love.
</p>
<p>Sir George hardly ever comes near us
but by formal invitation, and then his behaviour
to Mr. Arnold is so very civil,
and so very distant, that it mortifies me
exceedingly.  Mr. Arnold cannot but perceive
it; but either his tenderness for me
makes him take no notice of it, or else,
not being well enough acquainted with
my brother to know his disposition, he
may impute his coldness to his natural
temper.
</p>
<p>My mother says, he never names Mr.
Faulkland or Miss Burchell to her.  I
wish Sir George could intirely forget that
unhappy affair.

<div3 type="entry" id="d83">
	<head><date value="1704-02-01"><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 1.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>There is a story propagated
by the widow Arnold about the
meeting between her and her husband;
the circumstances of which are as follow.
</p>
<p>She says, she had dined one day in the
city, and was returning home to her lodgings
in York-building in a hackney-coach;
that the driver, by his carelessness in coming
along the Strand, had one of his forewheels
take of by a waggon, which accident
obliged her to alight: the foot-boy,
who was behind the coach, had by the
jolt been thrown off and received a hurt,
which made it necessary to have him carried
into s hop for assistance.  That the
lady herself, being no otherwise injured
than by a little fright, found that she was
so near home, that she did not think it
worth while to wait for another carriage,
but pursued her way on foot.  It was fine
dry evening, about nine o'clock: and
though there was no light but what the
lamps afforded, yet as the streets were
full of people, she had no apprehensions
of danger.

<pb n="236"/>
</p>
<p>In this situation she was accosted by
two gentlemen, who, seeing a lady well
dressed and alone, insisted on seeing her safe
to her lodgings.  However disagreeable
such an encounter was, she said she did
not give herself much concern about it,
as she was so near home, and expected to
shake off her new acquaintance at the
door of the house where she lodged; and
accordingly, when she got there, she told
them she was at home, and wished them
a good night; but the impertinents were
not so easily to be put off.  The door having
been opened by the maid of the house,
they both rushed in; her landlady, a single
woman, happened to be abroad, and
there was not man in the house.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Arnold thought she had no way
left, but to run up to her dining-room,
and lock herself in; but in this she was
prevented, as the gentlemen, whom the
servant of the house vainly endeavoured
to oppose, got up stairs almost as soon as
she did.  Her own maid, on hearing the
rap at the door, had lighted candles in
the dining-room; the two sparks entered

<pb n="237"/>
with her; but how was she surprized to
find that one of them was her husband.
Her fright, she said, had prevented her
from discovering this sooner, as she had
not looked in either of their faces, though
there was alight in the hall; and Mr.
Arnold's being half drunk, she supposed,
was the reason of his not perceiving sooner
who she was.
</p>
<p>The astonishment that they both were
in, and the exclamation that each made
in their turn, soon informed the companion
of Mr. Arnold who the lady was.
He congratulated them both on this fortunate
mistake, and saying, since chance
had been so propitious to Mr. Arnold as
to throw him into the arms of so charming
a woman, he hoped his discovering
her to be his wife would not render her
the less agreeable to him; but that this
unexpected meeting might be a means of
re-uniting them in their former amity.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold, she says, in the presence
of this gentleman, advanced with open
arms to embrace her, which she not declining,
his friend having again felicitated

<pb n="238"/>
them on their reconciliation, took
his leave, and Mr. Arnold remained with
his lady.
</p>
<p>That at parting, which was not till
late (as she would not, on account of her
reputation, permit him to pass the night
at her lodgings) he promised to bring
her home to his house in a day or two;
but unfortunately for her he was taken ill
in the interim, which she did not know of,
till she had an account that Mr. Arnold
had lost his senses.  The reason she assigned
for not inquiring after him sooner was
that her pride would not suffer her to
make any advances to a man, who had
been so injurious as to part with her; and
she thought it his duty to recal her, without
her taking any step towards it.
</p>
<p>This story seems plausible; yet none
of our friends believe a word of it, and
imagine somebody has contrived it for
her.  The gentleman, who was the
companion of Mr. Arnold that night, she
says, can, at a proper time, be produced
as a witness, as also her own maid,
who can testify the truth of this story.  In

<pb n="239"/>
the mean time this maid is kept out of
the way, and nobody can guess at the
gentleman, for his name is kept a profound
secret.
</p>
<p>I am delighted at the sweetness of Mr.
Arnold's temper: vexatious as this affair
is likely to be, even at the best, he does
not suffer it to interrupt our pleasures or
his own good humour.  On the contrary,
he is the more studious of promoting
every thing which he thinks will
entertain me.

<p>At length the poor
Miss Burchell is happily rid of her burthen;
a pretty little boy, my mother says
it is: it was, immediately after his birth,
at which my mother was present, privately
baptized by the name of Orlando,
and sent away with its nurse, a careful
body, who had been before provided for
it.  It passes for the son of a captain Jefferis,
abroad with the army.  Miss Burchell
would never suffer the nurse to see
her; for as she intends to reassume her
own name, as soon as she shall be in a

<pb n="240"/>
condition to leave her present retirement,
she would choose not to be known by the
woman, in case of her gong to see her
child.  Every thing was managed with
so much privacy, and Miss Burchell has
lived so perfectly recluse, nobody ever
visiting her but my mother, that in all
probability this affair will always remain
an intire secret.
</p>
<p>My mother says, that as soon as Miss
Burchell (to whom she considers herself as
a kind of patroness) is tolerably recovered,
she will go down to Sidney Castle; for she
thinks herself in a strange land any where
but there.  And would you believe it, my
dear, she has taken such a fancy to Miss
Burchell, that she talks of inviting her
down with her, if she can obtain her
uncle's leave.  The girl must certainly
have some very amiable qualities, so to
captivate my mother, or she has an immensity
of art.  I dare say the young lady
will gladly accept of her invitation; it will
undoubtedly be a most eligible situation
for her.  I do not know what Sir George
may say to her carrying her humanity so

<pb n="241"/>
far, as he hates the name of this poor
girl; but no matter, it may be a means
of preserving her character, which probably
she might not long keep, if she returned
to live with so vile a woman as I
conclude her aunt to be; nor can she
have any colour for quitting her whilst
her uncle lives; for I find she is an orphan,
and has no relation but him.  She must
however go home for a while, in order
to get leave from him for this visit to
Sidney Castle.

<p>I am told the
widow Arnold computes the time of her
lying-in about the latter end of the next
month; if it should happen, she saves
her distance, as her husband died in July,
a little before we went to Grimston-hall.
Mr. Arnold treats the affair very lightly,
and is only concerned at seeing my mother
so much affected by it.  For my
part, I form my behaviour upon Mr.
Arnold's conduct; and a long as he appears
easy, I shall certainly be so too.
</p>
<p>My brother throws out some unkind

<pb n="242"/>
reflections: he says, he wonders the old
sybil at Grimston-hall did not foresee
this; and congratulates me on my good
fortune, in having my jointure settled on
that part of the estate which is not disputed.
I really think he shews a sort of
ill-natured triumph even in his condolements;
for he generally concludes them
with thanking his stars that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had no
hand in the match.  I trust in God we
shall none of us have any cause to repent
it.  I am sure I never shall; for if Mr.
Arnold were reduced to the lowest ebb
of fortune, I should find my consolation
in his kindness and affection.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d86">
	<head><date value="1704-03-27"><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 27.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>My mother is preparing
to leave town.  Miss Burchell is quite
recovered, and purposes going down to
the country to obtain her uncle's consent
for the intended visit.  She says, she
can easily tell him she made an acquaintance
with lady Bidulph in her late excursion
to Bath, from whom she received
an invitation, and she is sure he will not
refuse to let her accept it.

<pb n="243"/>
</p>
<p>Sir George laughs exceedingly at this
plan.  He says his mother ought not to
be surprized at Faulkland's falling into
the girl's snares, since she herself has done
the same; but he supposes my mother
thinks she is doing a very meritorious
action, in affording an asylum to this injured
innocence.  I give you my brother's
words for I assure you, as to myself, I
approve of my mother's kindness to her,
and think it may be a means of preserving
the girl from future mischief.

<p>Miss Burchell is gone into
the country; and this morning, for the
first time, severed me from the best of
mothers.  I cannot recover my spirits; I
have wept all day.  Mr. Arnold, ever
good and obliging, would needs accompany
her some miles on her journey; you
may be sure I was not left behind.  Sir
George was so polite as to say, He would
escort her down to Sidney Castle.  I was surprized
at it; for he does not often do obliging
things.  My mother gladly accepted
of his company, and said, she would

<pb n="244"/>
make him her prisoner, when she had him
there; for she should be quite melancholy
without me for a time.  Now though I
should be very unwilling not to allow
the merit of a good-natured action to Sir
George, yet do I attribute this in some
measure to its answering a propose of
convenience to himself.  You know, before
his illness sent him to the Spa, he
always spent his summers with us at the
Castle, though he has another very convenient
house on his estate.  When he
was in London he never had any thing
but lodgings, for which I have often been
angry with him.  My mother, since his
return, made him a compliment of her
house; but as the time she took it for
is now expired, and it is let to another
family, he could not longer continue
in it.  Mr. Arnold, in the most affectionate
manner, pressed him to accept of
an apartment with us, which he declined.
Now as he could not, without shewing
us an apparent slight, continue in town
in other lodgings, I believe he, for this
reason, preferred going down with my

<pb n="245"/>
mother.  Be it as it may, I am very glad
that she will have his company; for I
make no doubt of his staying with her
some time, unless Miss Burchell should
frighten him away.

<p>I have been so cast down
since my mother's departure, that Mr.
Arnold's obliging tender assiduity to
please and entertain me seems redoubled;
but indeed I am wearied with a continual
round of noisy pleasures, and long to get
back to Arnold-abbey.  I hope to be
there in about three weeks, or a month at
farthest.  My mother has dispensed with
our going down to her this summer.  She
thinks it might be attended with inconveniencies
to me, and talks of coming to
town again in a few months; but I shall
insist on her not giving herself the fatigue
of so long a journey, unless she comes
to stay all the next winter with us.

<p>My mother writes me
word that Miss Burchell has obtained
leave of her uncle, and is coming to Sidney

castle: she says, she never saw a better
behaved young creature.  Sir George
has taken so much offence at her coming,
that he talks of going to his own house.
My mother adds, "He behaves however
with manners, but I shall not press him
to stay.'

<p>An important birth, my
Cecilia! the widow Arnold has produced
a young miss.  I assure you the little
damsel has been ushered into life with all
the ceremony due to a young heiress; and
her mother introduces her as one whom
an unjust uncle debars of her right.  Now
you must know, that upon an exact calculation,
this little girl has made her appearance just twelve days later
than she
ought to have done, to prove her legitimacy,
dating the possibility of her being
Mr. Arnold's, from the very day whereon
he took that illness of which he died, and
which confined him for five days to his
bed.  In all that time his servants never
left him for a minute; this has occasioned
various speculations; our lawyers say that

<pb n="247"/>
it is enough to destroy her pretensions;
but some physicians, who have been consulted
on the occasion, are of a contrary
opinion; and declare they have known
instances of children being born, even so
long after the stated time alloted by nature
for their coming into life.
</p>
<p>It is a very unlucky affair, and has involved
us in a law-suit.  Who the person
is that secretly abets the widow, we cannot
find out; but it is certain she has
somebody; every one believes this is an
infamous and unjust claim; and the woman's
folly almost frees her from the suspicion
of its being of her own contriving.

<p>You cannot imagine, my
Cecilia, how happy I think myself, after
such a hurrying winter as I have had, to
find ;myself once more restored to my favourite
pleasures, the calm delights of solitude.
Arnold-abbey seems a paradise to
me now.
</p>
<p>Lady Grimston shewed me a specimen
of her humour this morning, in talking
of the widow Arnold.  She said she was

<pb n="248"/>
an <hi rend="italic">harlot</hi>, that having already disgraced
the family, now wanted to beggar them;
but that if Mr. Arnold did not make an
example of her, she would never own him
for a kinsman.
</p>
<p>My chearful old dean says, he is now
completely happy, having lived to see his
daughter married (while we were in town)
very much to his and her satisfaction.  I
am heartily glad of it; neither am I
sorry (for her sake) that she has left the
country.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d92">
	<head><date value="1704-05-11"><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 11.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Mrs. Vere is come to
spend a few weeks with me according to
her promise.  She is a truly amiable creature;
her disposition so gentle, her temper
so mild, such a sweet humility in her
whole deportment, that it astonishes me
her mother can still persist in her unkindness
to her.  But the eldest daughter was always
her darling, who I understand is
pretty much of her moth's own cast, and
makes a very termagant wife to a very turbulent
husband.  So that notwithstanding
their title (for he is a baronet) and immense
riches, they are a very miserable pair.

<pb n="249"/>
</p>
<p>They were lately to pay lady Grimston
a visit; but there happened such a fracas,
that probably it may be the last she will
ever receive from them.  The husband
it seems, though very rough and surly in
his nature, is, notwithstanding, a well-meaning man, and not void of humanity;
which had induced him to give a small
portion to a young girl, a distant relation
of his own, who had been left an orphan.
She was beloved by the son of a substantial
farmer, a tenant of the baronet's, and
had an equal affection for him; but the
young man, depending intirely on his father
for his future prospects, durst not
take a wife without something to begin
the world with; for his father had just
put him into the management of one of
his farms.  The young lady and her mother
(who was a widow, and is but lately
dead) had boarded for some years at this
honest farmer's house, and in that time's
mutual love had been contracted between
the young people.  The old man himself
liked the girl so well for a daughter-in-law, that his only objection was her want of

<pb n="250"/>
but this was such an obstacle as
was not to be surmounted by a man, who,
being accustomed to earn money by indefatigable
industry, put the utmost value
upon it.  His regard to his son's happiness,
however, made him resolve to try
an experiment in his favour, and accordingly
he plucked up courage, and went
to his landlord.  He told him, in his own
blunt way, that he came to speak to him in
behalf of a poor young gentlewoman that
was his (Sir William's) relation.  I have
a son that loves her, said he, and she
loves him, but I cannot afford to let the
boy marry a wife that has nothing; and
you know she has no portion.  I would not
desire much with her, for she is a good
girl, and very housewifely; But if you
will be so kind to give something to
set them a-going a little, I shall be content;
if not, you will be the cause of my
son's losing a wife, for he swears he will
never marry any other woman; and she,
poor thing, may pine away for love.  I
do not desire this match out of the ambition
of having my boy related to you,

<pb n="251"/>
but because I think the girl is an honest
girl, and may make him happy.
</p>
<p>The rough honesty of the farmer
pleased his landlord so well, that he gave
the young woman five hundred pounds,
to set them a-going, as the old yeoman
termed it.  Though this sum was but a
trifle to a man of his fortune, and the
giving it was a praise-worthy action, yet
did it exceedingly displease his lady,
especially as he had not thought proper to
consult her on the occasion.  She was not
contented with venting her indignation
on her husband at home, but she renewed
the quarrel, by complaining to lady
Grimston, that her opinion and advice
were not only despised, but that Sir William
was lavishing away the fortune <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
had brought him upon a <hi rend="italic">tribe</hi> of poor
relations of his own.  Lady Grimston
immediately took fire; she could not
bear the thoughts of having her daughter's
authority of less weight in his family
than her own had been, and she attacked
her son-in-law with acrimony on the subject.
His answer to her was short.  Look

<pb n="252"/>
ye, lady Grimston, you made a very obstreperous
wife to a very peaceable husband;
your daughter, I find, is mightily
disposed to follow your example; but as
I am not quite so tame as my father-in-law was, I will suffer her to see as little
of it as may be.  With this he turned
from her, and ordering his coach and six
to be got ready immediately, with very
little ceremony he forced his wife into it,
and carried her home directly, leaving
lady Grimston foaming with rage.  The
altercation had been carried on with so
little caution, that the servants heard it,
and the story is the jest of the neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>I confess I am not sorry for this breach;
it may be the better for poor Mrs. Vere;
for though her mother's jointure reverts
to a male relation, on whom the estate
was settled, yet as lady Grimston has a
large personal fortune, it is in her power
to make her daughter full amends for the
injury she did her.

<p>How delightful are
the new sensations, my dear Cecilia, that
I feel hourly springing in my heart!
Surely the tenderness of a mother can never
be sufficiently repaid; and I now more
than ever rejoice in having, by an obedience,
which perhaps I once thought had
some little merit in it, contributed so

<pb n="254"/>
much to the repose of a parent to whom
I have such numberless obligations.  I
never see my dear little girl, but I think
such were the tender sentiments, the
sweet anxieties, that my honoured and
beloved mother felt when her Sidney was
such a brat as this.  Then I say, surely
I have a right to all the duty, all the
filial love that this creature can shew me,
in return for my fondness.  As for Mr.
Arnold, he idolizes it; you never saw so
good a nurse as he makes.  Lady Grimston
declares, we are both in a fair way
of ruining the child, and advises us to
send it out of the house, that we may
not grow too fond of it; but we shall
hardly take her counsel.

<p>I informed you before
that Miss Burchell had been summoned
home by her uncle, who was then
very ill.  She has lately written an account
to my mother of his death; and
that as she has now her fortune in her
own hands, she intends immediately to
quit her aunt, and look out for some

<pb n="255"/>
genteel and reputable family in London
(where it seems she chooses to reside) to
lodge with.
</p>
<p>My mother, in her letter to me, expresses
great satisfaction at her resolution
to leave her aunt, but is not without
her fears, that so pretty a young woman,
left to her own guidance, may be liable to
danger; though she thinks both her natural
disposition, and her good sense, sufficient
to guard her against actual evil.
</p>
<p>Our lawyer writes us word, that he
has had an offer of a composition, proposed
by the widow Arnold's people:
he says, though the sum they mention
is a very round one, yet it plainly
indicates the weakness of their hopes;
and concludes with telling Mr. Arnold,
that if six-pence would buy them off, he
should not, with his consent, give it to
them; as it would tacitly admit the legality
of their claim, and might be productive
of troublesome consequences hereafter;
and therefore he would by all
means have the issue fairly tried.  Mr.
Arnold laughs heartily at the proposal,

<pb n="256"/>
but says he is very much obliged to the
lady for condescending to give up more
than half, when her daughter has a right
to the whole; without whose consent he
supposes it is not in the mother's power
to make terms.
</p>
<p>I wish we were rid of this troublesome
affair, as it must hurry us to town sooner
than we intended, and the country is still
delightful.

<p>Again, we have
quitted our sweet retirement for the noise
and bustle of London; but this law business,
it seems, must be closely pursued,
though our antagonist's motions seem a
little dilatory.  We cannot find out the
secret spring that sets the machine a-going;
the wheels however do not seem
to move with such alacrity as they did;
though the widow still talks big, and
says, we shall repent of having rejected
her offer.

<p>My brother is arrived
in town, but took care to settle himself

<pb n="257"/>
in handsome commodious lodgings before
he paid us a visit; for fear, I suppose,
that we should again press him to accept
of apartments in our house.  I see he is
determined to keep up nothing more than
an intercourse barely civil.  Mr. Arnold
cannot but be disgusted with his behaviour,
but he is too delicate to take notice of
it to me.

<p>I am disapointed in my
hopes of seeing my dear mother in town
this winter.  Her apartment was ready for
her, and I delighted myself with the
thoughts of seeing her in possession of it, at
least for a few months; but she writes me
word that her old rheumatic complaint is
returned on her with such violence, that
she cannot think of undertaking the journey.
Sadly am I grieved at this news,
and shall long to have the winter over,
that Mr. Arnold and I may fly to Sidney
Castle; he has promised me this satisfaction
early in the summer.
</p>
<p>My mother informs me that Miss Burchell
constantly corresponds with her:

<pb n="258"/>
she tells her that her aunt is come to
town to solicit for her pension, but that
she never sees her; and as she means to
drop all correspondence with her, she does
not intend even to let her know where she
lodges.  I commend Miss Burchell highly
for this, as the acquaintance of such a
woman may be hurtful to her reputation.

<p>Again, my dear
Cecilia, I am able to reassume my pen.
I have read what Patty has writ, and
find she is admirable at the anecdotes of
a nursery.  Am I not rich, think you?
Two daughters, and both perfect beauties,
and great wits you may be sure!
</p>
<p>The new-born damsel was baptized this
day by the dear-loved name of Cecilia.

<pb n="259"/>
I am angry with Mr. Arnold, he takes
so little notice of this young stranger;
his affections are all engaged by Dolly:
indeed, I am almost jealous of her; for
he spends most of the time he is at home
in the nursery.
</p>
<p>Our antagonist is grown alert again,
and has renewed her efforts, which we
thought began to flag a little, with fresh
vigour.  Whence she derives those revived
hopes is still a mystery; but she now
says, she would not accept of a composition
if it were offered.  My poor Mr. Arnold
begins to fret a little; it now-and-then
makes him thoughtful; not that, he says,
he has the least doubt about his success, but
he has been much harassed with the necessary
attendance that the cause requires,
and downright tired with dangling after
lawyers; besides, they say the cause cannot
come to an hearing in the ensuing
term, though they before made us hope
that it would be at an end long before

<div3 type="entry" id="d104">
	<head><date value="1705-07-03"><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 3.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I am mortified exceedingly, my

<pb n="260"/>
dear Cecilia: I find I am not likely to see
my mother this summer.  I thought I could
not have lived so long from her sight.  Indeed
it was purely in the hope of making
her this visit, that I prevented her coming
to town in the spring, which she purposed
doing, though far from being well
enough to undertake the journey.  I own
I have been impatient under my confinement,
as that, and my previous circumstances,
detained us so long in town, and
I this day asked Mr. Arnold when we
should set out for Sidney Castle.  He answered
me, that he feared it would not
be in his power this season to pay the intended
visit to my mother: he says, he has
not been near his estate in Kent these five
years, except for a day or two at a time,
and that he thinks it necessary to see what
condition it is in.  I believe I have told
you ;that there is a pretty house on it.
The place is called South-park, and is
that which my mother chose for my settlement.
Mr. Arnold, who always preferred
Arnold-abbey to it, hardly ever
visited this place; and as he never resided

<pb n="261"/>
there, and only lay at an inn when he
went down, the house is unfurnished, excepting
a room or two, which a man who
receives his rent has just made habitable
for his own convenience.
</p>
<p>But that I have laid it down as a rule
never to oppose so good, so indulgent a
husband as Mr. Arnold is, in any instance
wherein I do not think a superior
duty requires me to do so, I should certainly
shew some disapprobation of what
he now purposes doing.  It will be attended
with so much trouble, so much
expence too&mdash;he has ordered the house at
South-park to be completely furnished,
and says, he hopes I shall like it so well
as to be induced to pass the remainder of
the summer there.  Most sure it is, every
place will be delightful to me where I can
enjoy his company, and have my dear
little babes with me; but methinks two
country houses are an unnecessary charge,
and more than suits our fortune.  I pray
God this tender husband may not have
a strong and prudent reason for this conduct,
which out of kindness he conceals;

<pb n="262"/>
perhaps he thinks this little spot at South-park may some time hence be the whole
of our dependance, and he has a mind to
be before-hand with ill fortune, in rendering
that retreat agreeable to me, and
rather an object of choice than of necessity.
If this be his motive, how much
am I obliged to him?  He has not hinted
any thing like it; nor would I dash the
pleasure he seems to promise himself
there, by insinuating the least suspicion of
what his reasons are for going to it.  If
we lose Arnold-abbey, and the whole
estate belonging to it, I shall only regret
it for his sake.

<p>We are to set out to-morrow, my Cecilia, for our place in
Kent.  I have made the best apology that
I could to my mother, and Mr. Arnold
too has writ to her; but I know she
will be extremely disapointed at not seeing
us.

<p>We are safely arrived at
South-park, Mr. Arnold in high spirits;

<pb n="263"/>
and my two young travellers bore the fatigue
extremely well.
</p>
<p>I am not surprized that Mr. Arnold
liked the old family-seat better than this.
I cannot say I am much charmed with
it, but I will not let him see that.  I affect
to admire, and seem pleased with
every thing that affords me the least opportunity
of commendation.  The house
is a very neat one; it has not been many
years built, and is in perfectly good repair.
It is genteely, though plainly furnished,
and we have tolerable garden; but as
the whole domain is let, we are obliged
to take a few fields from one of our tenants,
to supply our immediate wants.
we are in a very genteel and populous
neighbourhood, and within a mile of a
good market town.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d107">
	<head><date value="1705-07-20"><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 20.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have regretted nothing
so much in my absence from Arnold-abbey, as the being cut off from the hope
of seeing my amiable Mrs. Vere.  We
can have but <hi rend="italic">one friend</hi> to share our
heart, to whom we have no reserve,

<pb n="264"/>
and whose loss is irreparable; but I perceive
the absence of a pleasing acquaintance,
whose society is no farther necessary
to us, than as it contributes to enliven
solitude, and gets a preference to
others merely by comparison, is a loss
easily supplied; this I find by experience.
There are Mrs. Veres every where; but,
alas! there is but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> Cecilia!
</p>
<p>I was visited to-day by two ladies that
I am charmed with, though it is the first
time I have seen either of them.  The
one is Lady V. of whom you have formerly
heard.  Her lord and she came
together; their seat is within a mile of us,
and Mr. Arnold has a slight acquaintance
with lord V. before.  My lady is about
forty, and has that kind of countenance
that at once invites your confidence; I
never saw integrity, benevolence, and good
sense, more strongly pictured in a face;
her address is so plain, so perfectly free
from affectation, or any of the little supercilious
forms of ceremony, that a person,
ignorant of what true politeness consists
in, would imagine she wanted breeding;

<pb n="265"/>
yet she received her education in a
court; but she seems to let good sense
and good nature preside over all her
words and actions rather than form.  She
told me she had deferred her visit to me,
longer perhaps than the laws of decorum
would admit of, as we were such near
neighbours; but, said she, I was determined
not to be over-looked in the crowd
of visitors that have been thronging to
you every day, since you came down.
The character I have heard of you, makes
me wish for an intimacy with you, and
you are not to look upon this as a visit
of ceremony, but as an advance towards
that friendship I wish to cultivate.
</p>
<p>She spoke this with so frank an air,
that, flattering as the compliment appeared,
I could not help believing her sincere;
and thought myself, that my appearance
did not diminish that good opinion which
she said she had conceived of me from
report.
</p>
<p>Lord V&mdash;is many years older than his
lady; a robust man, as plain in his way
as my lady is in her's; though <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way

<pb n="266"/>
and <hi rend="italic">her's</hi> are very different, for he is
frank even to bluntness, but the best
humoured man living.
</p>
<p>The other lady whom I mentioned is
a widow; her name is Gerrarde, and she
lives upon a little estate she has in this
neighbourhood.  I think I never beheld
so fine a creature; she is about six-and-twenty; her stature, which is much above
the common size, is rendered perfectly
graceful and majestic by one of the finest
shapes in the world; if her face is not
altogether so regularly beautiful as her
person, it is, however, handsome enough
to render any woman charming who had
nothing else to boast of.  Whether her
understanding be of a piece with the rest,
I have not yet been able to discover.  Her
visit to me was but short, for she had not
sat with me an hour, when lady V&mdash;came
in, and she then took her leave; but by
what I could observe in that little time,
she seems to have as much vivacity and
agreeable humour, as I ever met with in
any one.  She pressed me to dine with her
at her cottage, as she calls it, to-morrow,

<pb n="267"/>
and I like her too well to refuse the invitation.
</p>
<p>These two charming women, I think,
I shall single out for my chief intimates,
from the crowd which have been to
compliment me on my coming into this
country.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold is mightily pleased with
them both; but he gives the preference
to lady V&mdash;, whom, though he had a
slight acquaintance with her lord, he never
saw before.  But he is almost as great a
stranger in this place as I am: he is
highly delighted at my having met with
people who are likely to render it agreeable
to me.

<p>We dined to-day according
to appointment with Mrs. Gerrarde.
A cottage she called her house, nor does
it appear much better at the out-side, but
within it is a fairy palace.  Never was any
thing so neat, so elegant, so perfectly well
fancied, as the fitting up of all her rooms.
Her bedchambers are furnished with fine
chintz, and her drawing-room with the

<pb n="268"/>
prettiest Indian sattin I ever saw.  Her
little villa is called Ashby, and her
husband, she told me, purchased it for
her sometime before his death, and left
it to her; but she has since had a considerable
addition to her fortune by the
death of a relation.
</p>
<p>Our entertainment was splendid almost
to profusion, though there was no company
but Mr. Arnold and I.  I told
her, if she always gave such dinners, it
would frighten me away from her: indeed
it was the only circumstance in her
whole conduct that did not please me,
for I was charmed with the rest of her behaviour.
They must surely be of a very
churlish disposition, who are not pleased
where a manifest desire to oblige is conspicuous
in every word and action.
If Mrs. Gerrarde is not as highly polished
as some women are, who, perhaps,
have had a more enlarged education,
she makes full amends for it by a
perfect good humour, a sprightliness always
entertaining, and a quickness of
thought that gives her conversation an

<pb n="269"/>
air of something very <hi rend="italic">like</hi> wit, and which
I dare say passes for the thing itself with
most people.

<p>I have returned lady V&mdash;'s
visit, and am more delighted with her
than before.  Mr. Arnold went with me;
but my lord not being at home, he went
to ramble about the grounds, so that I
had a long <hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</hi> with lady V&mdash;.  She
is an admirable woman, so fine an understanding,
such delicacy of sentiment,
and such an unaffected complaisance in
her manner, that I do not wonder my
lord perfectly adores her.  There is a
tenderness, a maternal kindness in her behaviour
towards me, that fills me at once
with love and reverence for her; and,
next to my Cecilia, I think I never met
with any woman whom I could so highly
esteem as lady V&mdash;.  She is an admirable
mistress of her needle, and every room
in her house exhibits some production of
a very fine genius, united with very great
industry: for there are beds, chairs, and
carpets, besides some very pretty rural

<pb n="270"/>
prospects in pannels, executed with inimitable
skill, and very excellent taste.
She tells me, if I will give her leave to
bring her work with her, she will live
whole days with me.
</p>
<p>I am rejoiced now that Mr. Arnold
thought of coming to South-park.  How
valuable is the acquaintance of such a
woman as lady V&mdash;! and I might never
have known her, but for a circumstance
to which I was at first so averse.
And then my agreeable lively Mrs. Gerrarde!
My accquaintance at Arnold-abbey begin to fade upon my memory:
to say the truth, I think of none of them
with pleasure, but Mrs. Vere, and my
good humoured old dean.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d110">
	<head><date value="1705-08-04"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 4.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde is a little
saucy monopolist; she grumbles if I do
not see her every day, and is downright
jealous of my intimacy with lady V&mdash;.
They are acquainted, but I don't find
there is a very close intercourse between
them: Mrs. Gerrarde says, her ladyship
is too good a housewife for her; and as

<pb n="271"/>
she is not very fond of needle-work herself,
she cannot endure people that are always
poring over a frame.  I find indeed,
that this sprightly rogue is fonder of
cards than of work; she draws Mr. Arnold
and me in very often for a pool at
piquet: at her house I am obliged to submit;
but at my own, I often take up a
book, when she and Mr. Arnold are engaged
at their game, and make them decide
the contest between them.  Nay, I threaten
that I will, some night or other, steal to-bed, and leave them; for she is unconscionable
at late hours; and as she lives very
near us, and keeps a chariot, she does
not scruple to go home at any hour of
the night.  What a pity it is so amiable
a woman should be thus fondly attached
to so unprofitable an amusement! for I
begin to see play is her foible; though,
to do her justice, she never engages but for
very trifling sums, and that only in our
own little domestic way.  But this passion
may grow upon her, and she may be
led unawares into the losing more than
her fortune can bear.

<pb n="272"/>
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d111">
	<head><date value="1705-08-12"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 12.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I never was so disconcerted
as I have been this day: you will
be surprized when I tell you, it was by
my good lady V&mdash;.  She came to pass
the day with me, Mr. Arnold being
engaged abroad.
</p>
<p>We were both sitting at work in the
parlour: lady V&mdash;had continued silent
for a good while; at last looking at me
with a most benign smile, for I had at the
same instant cast my eyes at her; I was just
then thinking, my dear Mrs. Arnold, said
she, that I once (though perhaps you did
not know it) flattered myself with the
hopes of being related to you.  Her words
threw me into confusion, though I did
not know their meaning.  It would have
been both an honour and a happiness to me,
madam, I replied, though I don't know by
what means I was ever likely to possess it.
She continued smiling, but seemed in
suspence whether she should proceed.  You
will pardon my curiosity, my dear, said
she, but give me leave to ask, whether
Mr. Arnold was not once near losing the
happiness he now enjoys?  I felt my face

<pb n="273"/>
glow as she spoke.  There was once a
treaty of marriage on foot, madam, I
answered, between me and another gentleman.
I am sorry I mentioned it, said
my lady, observing my confusion; but
as I was no stranger to the affair while it
was transacting, and Mr. Faulkland is a
kinsman of mine, I hope you will forgive
my inquisitivness; for I own I have a
curiosity, which I believe nobody but
yourself can gratify; and if I did not
think you the most candid, as well as the
best tempered creature living, I durst not
push my inquiry.  My lord, you are to
know, was in London at the time Mr.
Faulkland was first introduced to you;
and as they are extremely fond of each
other, Mr. Faulkland did not scruple to
disclose his passion to him, nor the success
it then appeared likely to be crowned
with, giving him at the same time such
a character of you, as I have since found
you deserve.
</p>
<p>When my lord returned to V&mdash;hall,
which he was obliged to do very soon
after Mr. Faulkland had made this discovery

<pb n="274"/>
to him, he informed me of the alliance
my cousin Faulkland was going to
make; and we were pleasing ourselves
with the thoughts of congratulating him
on his happiness, when we received a letter
from him that put an end to all our
expectations; this letter contained but
four distracted lines: he told my lord, in
broken sentences, that he had lost all
hopes of Miss Bidulph; that an act of
indiscretion had been construed into a
capital crime; and that being banished
from the presence of the woman he
adored, he was immediately about to bid
adieu to England, perhaps for ever.
</p>
<p>This was the substance of what he
wrote to us: we have heard from him
since a few times, but he never cleared
up the matter to us, nor ever so much as
mentioned it.  I have not been in London
since; my lord has; but he never
could get any light into the mystery: he
heard from some of our friends, who
knew of the intended match, that it was
broke off nobody knew why.  There were,
however, several idle surmises thrown

<pb n="275"/>
out; some laid the blame on Mr. Faulkland,
and some on you; but the truth I
believe remains still a secret.  Now, my
dear, if my curiosity is improper, or if
there was any particular motive to this
disapointment of my kinsman's hopes,
which you don't choose to reveal, forgive
my inquiry, and think no more of it;
but take up that book, and read to me
while I work.
</p>
<p>Though my lady gave me this kind
opportunity of evading her question, I
did not lay hold of it: I did not indeed
choose to reveal the whole of this affair,
because I did not think myself at liberty
to divulge Miss Burchell's secret, however
I might discover my own.  I told
my lady in general terms, that though
Mr. Faulkland might pretend to a lady
every way my superior, yet there was an
objection to him of no small weight with
us; that my mother had been informed
of a very recent piece of gallantry he had
had with a person of some condition, and
that it had disgusted her so much, she
could not think of uniting me with a

<pb n="276"/>
man whose passions were not a little more
staid; and that this was the sole reason of
her dislike to a gentleman, who was in
every other respect unexceptionable.  I
am glad it was no worse, said lady V&mdash;,
smiling; I am sure Mr. Faulkland is not
capable of a <hi rend="italic">base</hi> action; youthfull follies
he may have had, though I believe as few
even of those to answer for as most men
of his years.  I make not the least doubt,
however, that lady Bidulph was guided
by prudence in what she did.  She certainly
could not be too cautious in the
disposal of <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a child as you; and whatever
Mr. Faulkland's disapointment may
be, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I hope are happy.  Lady V&mdash;
looked at me as she pronounced these
words, with an inquisitive, though tender
regard.  I was glad of an opportunity
of enlarging on the merits of Mr.
Arnold, and told her, I was as happy as
my heart could wish, or the worthiest of
men could make me.  I am glad of it,
said she, with a quickness in her voice;
but don't imagine, my dear Mrs. Arnold
(and she took me by the hand) that I introduced

<pb n="277"/>
this conversation merely to gratify
a curiosity which I fear you must
condemn in your private thoughts, though
you have been so good as to satisfy it: I
had another reason, a much stronger one.
What is it, dear madam? almost starting
with apprehensions of I did not know
what.  Don't be alarmed, said she, smiling,
it is only this; a great aunt of Mr.
Faulkland's is lately dead, who has left
him a considerable personal estate, and he
is coming over to take possession of it;
otherwise I don't know when we should
have seen him in England.  My lord had a
letter very lately from him; he was then at
Turin, where he had met with our eldest
son, who is now on his travels: he told us
he had letters and some tokens of love to
deliver us from him; and that he should
immediately on his arrival in England
come to V&mdash;hall, where he would pass a
month with us.  Now as we expect him
daily, I had a mind to apprize you of his
intended visit, that you might not be surprized,
by perhaps unexpectedly meeting
him at my house.  I thanked her ladyship

<pb n="278"/>
for her obliging caution, though I thought
it had something in it that mortified me.
I told her, that though I should not seek
to renew my acquaintance with Mr.
Faulkland, I had yet no reason to avoid
him.  Lady V&mdash;, who is extremely
quick of apprehension, replied, Without
doubt, madam, you have not; but you
might be surprized at seeing him notwithstanding.
</p>
<p>She presently turned the discourse: but
made me happy the whole day, by that inexhaustible
fund of good sense and improving
knowledge of which she is mistress.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold came not home till very
late; he complains that he is got into a
know of acquaintance that like the bottle
too well; but I am sure his natural sobriety
is such, that it will not be in the
power of example to lead him into intemperance;
though I am vexed he has
fallen into such acquaintance, because
I know drinking is disagreeable to him:
yet a country gentleman must sometimes
give a little into it, to avoid the character
of being singular.

<pb n="279"/>
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d112">
	<head><date value="1705-08-22"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 22.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Surprized I was not,
because I came prepared; but I own I
was abashed at seeing Mr. Faulkland to-day.  Mr. Arnold and I were invited to
dine at lord V&mdash;'s, and his lordship,
and his guest, came in from the fields,
where they had been walking, just as we
were ready to sit down to table.
</p>
<p>There happened to be a good deal
more company; Mr. Faulkland was not
introduced; so that there was no room
for any thing constrained or improper of
either side.  I presently recovered the little
embarrassment, that his first entrance
into the room occasioned.  I am sure nobody
took notice of it; for dinner being
immediately served, there was a sort of
bustle in hurrying out of the drawing-room.  The crowd we had at table destroyed
all conversation; and nothing
particular was said during dinner.  Lady
V&mdash; soon with drew, and all her female
friends followed her.  I observed she frequently
glanced her penetrating eyes at
Mr. Faulkland, while we were at table,
but I did not choose to make any observations

<pb n="280"/>
on him.  We had not been long
seated at our coffee, when four of the
gentlemen slipped from their company
and came to us: these were Mr. Arnold,
Mr. Faulkland, and two others.  My lord
is pretty free at his bottle, and none of
these gentlemen I suppose were fond of
that entertainment.  Lady V&mdash; and I were
sitting on a couch: I called to Mr. Arnold,
and placed him between us: Mr.
Faulkland approached me, and then, for
the first time, with a respectful distance,
inquired after my mother and Sir George,
telling me he had missed of the latter
when he was in London, being told he
was at Sidney Castle.  After a few more
indifferent questions, he took a dish of
coffee, and retired with it to a window.
Mr. Arnold asked me in a whisper, if I
was acquainted with Mr. Faulkland; I
could only answer, that I was formerly
very well acquainted with him.  Nothing
more passed between Mr. Faulkland and
me the whole evening: he returned soon
to the company in the next room, and I
saw no more of him.

<pb n="281"/>
</p>
<p>I can with the utmost sincerity assure
my Cecilia, that I now behold Mr.
Faulkland with as much indifference as I
do any other man of my acquaintance.
Time, joined to my own efforts, must,
without any other help, have intirely subdued
an inclination which was always
restrained by prudential motives, and
rendered subservient to my duty; but I
have, besides this, now acquired a shield
that must render me invulnerable; I mean
the perfect and tender affection I bear my
husband: this has completely secured me
against the most distant apprehensions of
being alarmed from any other quarter; yet
notwithstanding all this, I can't say that
I am quite satisfied at this renewal of my
acquaintance with Mr. Faulkland.  I
hope, and indeed it is reasonable to suppose,
that I have now as little interest in
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> heart as he has in mind: it is but natural
to believe that a gay young man, like
him, should not be so weak as to nourish
a hopeless passion for more than tow years,
especially as he has never once seen the
object of it in all that time; and must

<pb n="282"/>
without doubt, have had his attention engaged
to others in all likelihood much
preferable to her; so that I think I have
reason to be as easy on his account as on
my own.  But still I am disquieted in my
mind; I have a delicacy that takes alarm
at the veriest trifles, and has been a
source of pain to me my whole life-time:
it makes me unhappy to think that I am
now under an almost unavoidable necessity
of sometimes seeing and conversing
with a man, who once had such convincing
proofs that he was not indifferent
to me.
</p>
<p>Mr Arnold's ignorance of our former
connections makes it still worse.  At the
time I was so averse to his knowing any
thing of this affair, I flattered myself I
should never see Mr. Faulkland more, or
at least never be obliged to have any intercourse
with him; but I know lament
that I did not take my mother's advice,
and disclose the whole affair at first.  Oh, my
Cecilia! when the smallest deviations from
candor (which we suppose discretion) are
thus punished with remorse, what must

<pb n="283"/>
they fell whose whole life is one continued
act of dissimulation?  If Mr. Arnold had
been acquainted with my former engagements,
my heart would be more at ease,
and I should then converse with this man
with all the disengaged freedom of a
common friend.  I wish Mr. Arnold's curiosity
would excite him to ask me some
questions relative to my acquaintance with
Mr. Faulkland, that I might have an opportunity
of telling him the secret.  But
the inquiry he made at lady V&mdash;'s was in
a careless manner; he was satisfied with
my reply, and spoke not of him since.
</p>
<p>You will laugh perhaps when I tell you
that I have not courage to mention it
first: Mr. Faulkland is reckoned a very
fine gentleman, and I think it would have
such an air of vanity to tell my husband
that I refused him: then it would bring
on such a train of explanations, and poor
Miss Burchell's history must come out;
for a husband on such a subject might be
disgusted with concealments of any kind;
and I doubt whether even some circumstances
in my particular share of this story

<pb n="284"/>
might not displease him.  In short, I am
bewildered, and know not what to wish
for; but must e'en let things take their
course, and rest satisfied in the integrity
of my own heart.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d113">
	<head><date value="1705-08-26"><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 26.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Oh, my dear!  I am
mortified to the last degree, lest Mr. Arnold
should, from some indiscreet tongue,
have received a hint of my former engagement;
he may think me disingenuous
for never having mentioned it, especially
since Mr. Faulkland has been in
the neighbourhood: I think his nature is
too open to entertain any suspicions essentially
injurious to me; yet may this affair,
circumstanced as it is, make an unfavourable
impression on him.  I wish I had
been before-hand with any officious whisperer:
he has got so much abroad, that the
story may have reached his ears.  God
forbid it should affect his mind with
causeless uneasiness; I would Mr. Faulkland
were a thousand miles from V&mdash;hall.
I think Mr. Arnold is altered since his arrival

<pb n="285"/>
there&mdash;Colder he appears to be&mdash;I
hope but <hi rend="italic">fancy</hi> it&mdash;yet there <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a change
&mdash;his looks are less kind&mdash;his voice has
lost that tenderness that it used to have
in speaking to me&mdash;yet this may only be
his temper&mdash;a man cannot always be a
lover&mdash;Oh, I sicken at the very thought
of Mr. Arnold's entertaining a doubt of
my true affection for him!  I would not
live in this suspence for millions.  I would
rather he should treat me roughly&mdash;if I
discovered that to be his humour, though
it would frighten me, yet should I patiently
conform to it.

locked up in his own breast.  It cannot
be that a whisper, an idle rumour should
affect him thus.  What if he <hi rend="italic">has</hi> heard

<pb n="286"/>
that Mr. Faulkland loved me once?  That
we were to have been married?  Cannot
he ask me the question?  I long to set his
heart at ease&mdash;yet cannot mention the affair
first after so long a silence; it would
look like a consciousness.  I consciousness
of what?  I have nothing to accuse

</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d115">
	<head><date value="1705-09-01"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 1.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I am no longer in
doubt.&mdash;The cause, the fatal cause of Mr.
Arnold's change, is discovered.  This
miserable day has disclosed the secret to
me: a black, a complicated scene of mischief.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning.
He told me he was to dine with a gentleman
at some miles distance, and should
not return till late in the evening.
</p>
<p>He was but just gone, when a lady of
my acquaintance called in upon me, to
request I would go with her to a play
that was to be performed at night.  You
must know we have had a company of
players in the neighbourhood for some
time past, and it was to one of those

<pb n="287"/>
poor people's benefits that she desired my
company.  I promised to attend her,
though you know I don't much admire
those sort of entertainments in the country,
and seldom go to them.
</p>
<p>The lady and her husband called upon
me at the appointed hour, and I went
with them in their coach.  The place
which the players had fitted up for their
purpose, had formerly been a pretty large
school-room, and could, with the addition
of a gallery (which they had made) with
ease contain above three hundred people.
The play had been bespoke by some of
the principal ladies in the neighbourhood,
who had used all their interest for the performer,
so that the house was as full as
it could hold. The audience consisting
chiefly of fashionable people, it was with
difficulty that we reached the places which
were kept for us in the pit, as they happened
to be on the bench next the stage, and
the door was at the other end of the house.
The first object that I observed on my
coming in was Mr. Faulkland; he bowed to
me at a distance, but made no attempts to

<pb n="288"/>
approach me.  The play was come to the
latter end of the fourth act, and the curtain
was let down to make some preparation
on the stage, when we were alarmed
with the cry of fire.
</p>
<p>It happened that the carpenters, who
had been employed in fitting up this ex-tempore theatre, had left a heap of
shavings in a little place behind the stage,
which had been converted into a dressing-room; a little boy belonging to the company
had found a candle in it, and having
piled up the shavings, set them on
fire, and left them burning: the flame
communicated itself to some dry boards
which lay in the room, and in a few minutes
the whole was in a blaze.  Some
persons who heard the crackling of
wood, opened the door, when the flame
burst out with such violence, that the
scenes were presently on fire, and the
curtain, which as I told you was dropt,
soon caught it.
</p>
<p>The consternation and terror or the
poor people, whose <hi rend="italic">all</hi> was destroying,
is not to be described: the women skrieking,

<pb n="289"/>
threw themselves off the stage into
the pit, as the smoke and flames terrified
them from attempting to get out any
other way, though there was a door
behind the stage.
</p>
<p>The audience were in little less confusion
than they; for as the house was composed
chiefly of wood, every one expected
it would soon be consumed to ashes.
</p>
<p>The horror and distraction of my mind
almost deprived me of the power of motion.
My life was in imminent danger;
for I was scorched with the fire, before I
could get at any distance form the stage,
though the people were rushing out as fast
as they could.
</p>
<p>The lady who was with me was exceedingly
frightened; but being under her
husband's care, had a little more courage
than I had.  He caught her round the
waist, and lifted her over the benches,
which were very high, giving me what
assistance he could with his other hand.
But the terror and hurry I was in occasioned
my foot to slip, and I fell between
two of the benches, and sprained my
ancle.

<pb n="290"/>
</p>
<p>Some people pushing to get out, rushed
between me and my company; the excessive
pain I felt, joined to my fright,
made me faint away; in this condition
Mr. Faulkland found me, and carried
me out in his arms; for my companion
was too anxious for her own safety, to
suffer her husband to stay to give me
any assistance, so that he had only time
to beg of the men about him not to let
me perish.
</p>
<p>I soon recovered, upon being carried
into the open air, and found myself seated
on some planks, at a little distance from
the booth, Mr. Faulkland supporting me,
and two or three other people about me,
whom he had called to my assistance.
</p>
<p>Indebted to him as I was for saving
my life, my spirits were at that time too
much agitated to thank him as I ought.
</p>
<p>He told me he had stepped behind the
scenes to speak to somebody, and was
there when the stage took fire; that he then
ran to give what assistance he could to
the ladies that were in the house (observe
he distinguished not <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in particular)

<pb n="291"/>
and had just come in when he saw me
meet with the accident which had occasioned
my fainting away, and when the
gentleman, who was with me, was calling
for help, but at the same time getting out
as fast as he could.
</p>
<p>I now began to recollect myself; I was
uneasy at Mr. Faulkland's presence; I
wished him away.  I beseeched him to return
once more to the booth, to see if
every one had got out safe, for I told him
I had seen several of my female acquaintance
there, for whom I was alarmed.
With the assistance of the people who
were about me, I said I could make a
shift to get to the nearest house, which
was not above a hundred yards off, from
whence I should send home for my chariot,
which I had ordered to come to me
after the play.  He begged I would give
him leave to see me safe to that house,
but I would not permit him; and he left
me in the care of two women and a man,
who had come to be spectators of the
fire.
</p>
<p>With the help of these people, I contrived

<pb n="292"/>
to hobble (for my ancle pained me
exceedingly) to the place I mentioned,
which happened to be a public house.  All
the rooms below were full, and the
woman of the hose very obligingly helped
me up stairs into her own chamber.
I called for a glass of water, which
was immediately brought me, and I desired
the woman to send some one to my
house, which was about a mile's distance,
to order my chariot to come to me immediately.
</p>
<p>While the woman went to execute my
instructions, I had thrown myself into a
chair that stood close to the wainscot.  I
heard a bell ring, and presently a waiter
entered, and asked if I wanted any thing;
I told him, No.  He ran hastily out of
the room, and entering the next to that
where I was sitting, I heard a voice, which
I knew to be Mr. Arnold's, ask, Were the
servants found?  The man replying that
they were not; Then, said Mr. Arnold,
tell your mistress she will oblige me if she
will let me have her chaise to carry this
lady home.  The waiter presently withdrew,

<pb n="293"/>
and without reflecting on the particularity
of Mr. Arnold's being there with a lady,
about whom I formed no conjectures, I
was about to rise off my chair to go in
to him; but being almost disabled from
walking, I was obliged to creep along,
holding by the wainscot; when a tender
exclamation of Mr. Arnold's stopped me.
My dearest creature, said he to his companion,
you have not yet recovered your
fright.  A female voice answered him with
some fond expressions, which I could not
hear distinctly enough to discover whose it
was; but I was soon put out of doubt,
when the lady added, in a louder tone,
Do you know that your wife was at the
play to-night?  Mr. Arnold answered,
No; I hope she not see me.  Mrs.
Gerrarde (for I perceived it was she who
spoke) replied, I hope not, because perhaps
she might expect you home after the
play.  Though Mr. Arnold, in his first
emotion of surprize at hearing that I was
at the play, was only anxious lest I should
have observed him, yet he was not so lost
to humanity as to be indifferent whether

<pb n="294"/>
I escaped the flames or not: I am surprized
I did not see her, said he; I wish
she may have got out of the house safe.
You are very solicitous about her, replied
Mrs. Gerrarde, peevishly; there was
one there perhaps as anxious for her preservation
as you are&mdash;The conversation I
found here was likely to become extremely
critical for me; but I was prevented
from hearing any more by the woman
of the house, who just then entered
the room to ask me how I did, and to
know if I wanted any thing.
</p>
<p>I had heard enough to convince me that
my presence would be very unacceptable
both to Mr. Arnold and his companion,
and I resolved not to interrupt them; nor,
if possible, ever let Mr. Arnold know
that I had made a discovery so fatal to my
own peace, and so disadvantageous to him
and his friend.
</p>
<p>The messenger who had been dispatched
for my chariot met it by the way,
and was now returned with it; I was told
that it was at the door; and it was

<pb n="295"/>
with difficulty I got down stairs, leaning
on the woman of the house.
</p>
<p>I found Mr. Faulkland at the door;
he saw that I wished to disengage myself
from him after he had carried me out of
the booth; and though probably he did
not take the trouble to execute the sham
commission I gave him, which was indeed
with no other view than to get him
away, yet I believe he had too much
respect to intrude on me; and came then
with no other design than to inquire if
my chariot had come for me, and how I
was after the terrible condition he had
left me in, sitting at night in the open
air, with nobody but two or three ordinary
people about me, and those strangers.
This was a piece of civility which humanity,
had politeness been out of the
question, would have obliged him to.
He told me the fire was extinguished,
and happily nobody had received any
hurt; and that he had only called at that
house to know if I were safe, and recovered
from the fright and pain he had left
me in.  I thanked him, and was just

<pb n="296"/>
stepping, assisted by Mr. Faulkland, into
the chariot, when Mr. Arnold appeared
at the door: he was alone, and I concluded,
that having heard the chariot rattle
up the court-yard, he supposed it was
the carriage he had ordered for Mrs.
Gerrarde, and came down to see if it was
ready to receive her.
</p>
<p>The light which the servant, who attended
me out, held in his hand, immediately
discovered Mr. Arnold and me to
each other.  I could easily distinguish surprize
mixed with displeasure in his countenance.
He asked me abruptly, How
I came to that place? which I told him
in a few words.  The cold civility of a
grave bow passed between him and Mr.
Faulkland, who leaving me in my husband's
hands, wished me a good night,
and got into my lord V&mdash;'s coach, which
waited for him.
</p>
<p>Though I knew, from the discourse I
had overheard, that Mr. Arnold did not
mean to go home with me, yet as I was
now seated in the chariot, I could not
avoid asking him.  He told me he was
<pb n="297"/>
engaged to sup with company at that
house, and that probably he should not
be at home till late.  I knew this before-hand, and without troubling him with any
further questions, drove home.
</p>
<p>I have thrown together the strange occurrences
of this evening, as well as the
tumult of my spirits would give me leave:
I shall now lay down my pen to consider
of them a little more calmly.  My heart
sinks in me&mdash;Oh, that I had remained in
ignorance!&mdash;
</p>
<p>Is it possible, my Cecilia, that Mr.
Arnold, so good a man, one who married
me too for love, and who for these
two years has been the tenderest, the
kindest husband, and to whom I never
gave the most distant shadow of offence,
should at last be led into&mdash;I cannot name
it&mdash;dare not think of it&mdash;yet a hundred
circumstances recur to my memory, which
now convince me I am unhappy!  If I had
not been blind, I might have seen it
sooner, I recollect some passages, which
satisfy me that Mr. Arnold's acquaintance
with Mrs. Gerrarde did not commence

<pb n="298"/>
at South-park.  I remember lady V&mdash;
once asked me, Had she and I been acquainted
in London?  I said, No.  My
lord laughed, and in his blunt way said, I
will swear your husband was, for I have
seen him hand her out from the play more
than once.  I never asked Mr. Arnold
about this; it made no impression on me
at the time it was spoke, and went quickly
out of my thoughts.
</p>
<p>'Tis one o'clock: I hear Mr. Arnold
ring at the outer gate; I tremble all over,
and feel as if I feared to see him.  Yet
why should I fear; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have not injured
<hi rend="italic">him</hi>.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d116">
	<head><date value="1705-09-02"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 2.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Mr. Arnold staid long
enough in his dressing-room after he came
in last night, to give me time to go to-bed before he came up stairs.  Not a
word passed between us: I slept not the
whole night; whether he did or not I
cannot tell.  He asked me this morning,
when I rose, how I did: I told him in
great pain.  My ancle was prodigiously
swelled, and turned quite black, for I

<pb n="299"/>
had neglected it last night.  He said, you
had better let a surgeon see it, and went
carelessly out of the room.  How new is
unkindness to me, my friend! you know I
have not been used to it.  Mr. Arnold
adds cruelty to&mdash;but let it be so; far be
reproaches or complaints from my lips;
to you only, my second self, shall I utter
them; to you I am bound by solemn promise,
and reciprocal confidence, to disclose
the inmost secrets of my soul, and
with you they are as safe as in my own
breast.&mdash;
</p>
<p>I am once more composed, and determined
on my behaviour.  I have not a
doubt remaining of Mr. Arnold's infidelity;
but let me not aggravate my own
griefs, nor to a vicious world justify my
husband's conduct, by bringing any reproach
on my own.  The silent sufferings
of the injured must, to a mind not ungenerous,
be a sharper rebuke than it is in
the power of language to inflict.
</p>
<p>But this is not all: I must endeavour,
if possible, to skreen Mr. Arnold from

<pb n="300"/>
censure.  I hope his own imprudence
may not render these endeavours ineffectual.
I am resolved not to drop my acquaintance
with Mrs. Gerrarde.   While
we continue upon a footing of seeming intimacy,
the frequent visits, which I am
sure Mr. Arnold makes at her house, will
be less taken notice of.
</p>
<p>How Sir George would triumph at the
knowledge of Mr. Arnold's deviating from
virtue!  How my poor mother would be
amazed and afflicted!  But I will, as far
lies in my power, disappoint the malice of
my stars; my mother shall have no
cause to grieve, nor my brother to rejoice;
the secret shall die with me in my own
bosom, and I will wait patiently till the
hand of time applies a remedy to my
grief.&mdash;Mrs. Gerrarde sent a message
to inquire how I did.  Conscious
woman! she would not come herself,
though she knew not I had discovered
her.
</p>
<p>My dear good lady V&mdash; hurried to see
me the instant she had breakfasted: Mr.
Faulkland had told her of my disaster,

<pb n="301"/>
and her tenderness soothed and comforted
me much. She sat by my bedside two
hours, and her discourse alleviated the pain
both of my mind and body; but now she
has left me, I must again recur to the subject
that wrings my heart.  Mr. Arnold is
enslaved to one of the most artful of her
sex.  I look upon his attachment to be the
more dangerous, as I believe it is the first
of the kind he ever had; and no woman
was ever more formed to please and to deceive,
than she who now holds him in her
chains.  Into what hands am I fallen!
Mrs. Gerrarde must have heard my story,
and by the hint I heard her drop, what
cruel misrepresentations may she have
made to Mr. Arnold!  Mr. Faulkland she
can have no enmity to; but me she
certainly hates, for she has injured me.
</p>
<p>'Tis noon: I have not seen Mr. Arnold
since morning; he has been abroad ever
since he rose; Good God! is this the life
I am condemned to lead?
</p>
<p>A new scene of affliction opened to me:
surely my fate is drawing towards a crisis.

<pb n="302"/>
Mr. Arnold has just left me.  What a
conversation have we had!
</p>
<p>After entering my room, he walked
about for some minutes without speaking;
at last stopping short, and fixing his eyes
upon me, How long have you, said he,
been acquainted with Mr. Faulkland?  I
told him my acquaintance began with him
some months before I was married.  He
was once your lover I am informed.  He
was, and a treaty of marriage was concluded
on between us.  You would have
been happier, perhaps, madam, if it had
taken place.  I do not think so Mr. Arnold;
you have no reason to suppose I do.
I had a very great objection to Mr. Faulkland,
and obeyed my mother willingly,
when she forbid me to see him.  I ask not
what that object was, said he; but I
suppose, madam, you will without reluctance
obey <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, If I make the same request
to you.  Most chearfully;you cannot
make a request with which I should
more readily comply.  But let me beseech
you, Mr. Arnold, to tell me what part of my
behaviour has given you cause to think such

<pb n="303"/>
a prohibition necessary?  I do not say,
answered Mr. Arnold, that I have any
suspicion of your virtue; but your acquiescence
in this particular is necessary
to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> peace and your <hi rend="italic">own</hi> honour.
A lady's being <hi rend="italic">married</hi> does not cut off
the hopes of a gay man.  You give me
your promise that you will not see him
any more.  I <hi rend="italic">do</hi>, said I; I will give up
lady V&mdash;, whose acquaintance I so much
esteem: I will go no more to her house
while Mr. Faulkland continues there; and
I know of no other family, where I visit,
that he is acquainted with.
</p>
<p>My pride would not suffer me to inquire
where he had got this information: I already
knew it too well; and fearing he
would rather descend to an untruth than
tell me his author, I declined any farther
questions.  He seemed satisfied with my
promise, but quickly left me, as if the
whole end of his visit to me was accomplished
in having obtained it.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d117">
	<head><date value="1705-09-08"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 8.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>What painful minutes
am I obliged to sustain!  Mrs. Gerrarde

<pb n="304"/>
has been to see me, gay and assured as
ever.  She affected to condole with us
on the accident that happened to my foot,
with such an overstrained concern, such
a tender solicitude, that her insincerity
disgusted me, if possible, more than the
other part of her behaviour.  She told me,
she herself had been at the play, but
very luckily had got out without receiving
any injury.  I said, I was surprized
I had not seen her there.  O,
replied she, I was in a little snug corner,
where nobody could see me; for having
refused to go with some ladies that asked
me, I did not choose to be visible in the
house, and so squeezed myself up into what
they called their gallery, for I took nobody
with me but my maid.  Audacious
woman!&mdash;Is it not strange, my dear, that
Mr. Arnold could be so weak as to humour
her in the absurd frolick of going
with her to such a place?  For so it must
have been; or perhaps she appointed him
only to call for her at the play; and he
might have arrived but just in time to

<pb n="305"/>
assist her in getting out.  No matter which
it was.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d118">
	<head><date value="1705-09-09"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 9.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I was born to sacrifice
my own peace to that of other people; my
life is become miserable, but I have no remedy
for it but patience.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold spends whole days abroad;
at night we are seperated on account of my
indisposition; so that we hardly ever converse
together.  What a dreadful prospect
have I before me!  O Cecilia, may you
never experience the bitterness of having
your husband's heart alienated from you!
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash;, that best of creatures, is
with me constantly; she presses me to come
to her house as my ancle is now pretty
well, yet I am obliged to excuse myself.
I am distressed to the last degree at
the conduct I shall be forced to observe towards
her, yet dare not explain the motive.
Causeless jealousy is always the subject
of ridicule, and at all events Mr. Arnold
must not be exposed to this.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d119">
	<head><date value="1705-09-12"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 12.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I am weary of inventing

<pb n="306"/>
excuses for absenting myself from
V&mdash;hall.  My lady has done soliciting
me, yet continues her friendly and affectionate
visits; I fear she guesses my situation,
though she has not as yet hinted at
it; but her forbearing to press me any
more on the subject of going to her, and
at the same time not requiring a reason for
this breach of civility as well as friendship,
convinces me, that she suspects the
cause of my restraint.  I am now perfectly
recovered, yet do I still confine myself
to my house, to avoid as much as possible
giving umbrage to lady V&mdash;: but
this restraint cannot last much longer;
Mrs. Gerrarde teazes me to come to her,
and I have promised to make her my first
visit.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d120">
	<head><date value="1705-09-15"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 15.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Said I not that my
fate was near its crisis?  Where will this
impending ruin end!  Take, my Cecilia,
the occurrences of this frightful day.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold rode out this morning,
and told me he should not return till night.
He asked me, with that indifference

<pb n="307"/>
which now accompanies all his words,
How I meant to dispose of myself for the
day?  I told him, I had no design of going
abroad, and should spend my time in
reading, or at my needle.  This was my
real intention; but Mr. Arnold had but
just left the house, when I received a message
from Mrs. Gerrarde to know how I
did, and to tell me she was not well, and
much out of spirits, or she would come
and pass the day with me; but that she
insisted on my dining with her.  As I had
told Mr. Arnold I did not mean to go out,
I really had neither intention nor inclination
to do so.  But shall I confess my
weakness to you?  I suspected that he purposed
spending the day (as he often did)
with Mrs. Gerrarde, and the more so from
the question he had asked me on his going
abroad; he thought I might probably pay
her a visit; and this intrusion was a circumstance
he had a mind to be guarded
against, by knowing beforehand my designs.
I had not been to see Mrs. Gerrarde
since my recovery, and it was natural to
suppose I would return her visit.  Possessed

<pb n="308"/>
as I was with this opinion, her message
gave me a secret satisfaction, as it
served to convince me Mr. Arnold was not
to be with her, for she generally detained
me late when I went to her house.
From what trivial circumstances will the
afflicted draw consolation, or an additional
weight of grief!  So it was; I felt a
sort of pleasure in thinking, that for all
that day at least Mr. Arnold would absent
himself from my rival!&mdash;My rival!
mean word, she is not worthy to be called
so&mdash;from his mistress let it be.  In short, I
resolved to go, especially as she had sent
me word she was not well, and I knew my
husband would be pleased with my complaisance.
</p>
<p>I went accordingly to her house a little
before her hour of dining, which is much
later than any body's else in this part of the
world.  I found her dressed out, and
seemingly in perfect health.  She looked
surprized when she saw me; and I
then supposed that she hoped to have received
a denial from me, and was disappointed
at my coming; though I wondered

<pb n="309"/>
that the answer she received to her
message had not prepared her.  This
thought rushed into my mind in an instant,
and I was sure she expected Mr.
Arnold.  I told her, If I had thought I
should have found her so well, that her
message should not have brought me to
her; for that I had determined not to stir
out that day, till her invitation prevailed
on me to change my mind.  Sure, my
dear, said she, there must have been some
mistake in delivering the message to you; it
was for to-morrow I desired the pleasure
of your company to dine with me; for to-day I am absolutely engaged.  However,
I am very glad you are come, for I shall
not go out till seven o'clock.  I was
vexed and mortified: Either your servant
or mine made a mistake, said I, for I was
told you desired to see me to-day; besides
you sent me word you were not
well.  She seemed a little abashed at this:
I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> very ill in the morning, she said; and
though I was engaged to spend the evening
abroad, did intend to have sent an excuse;
but finding myself better, I change my
purpose.

<pb n="310"/>
</p>
<p>Dinner was immediately served, and I
sat down, but with a reluctance that prevented
me from eating.  I would have
taken my leave soon after dinner, but
Mrs. Gerrarde insisted on my staying, and
told me if I refused her, she should think
I had taken something amiss of her.  She
called for cards; I suffered myself to be
persuaded, and we fell to piquet.
</p>
<p>I played with disgust, and without attention,
every minute wishing to break
away.  Coffee was at length brought in;
I begged to be excused from staying, telling
Mrs. Gerrarde, I was sure I prevented
her from going abroad, but she would
take no denial.  I was constrained to take
a dish of coffee, and was hastening to get
it down when the parlour door flew open,
and lo! Mr. Faulkland entered the room.
If an object the most horrible to human
nature had appeared before me,
it could not at that instant have shocked
me half so much.  I let the cup and
saucer drop from hand: to say I turned
pale, trembled, and was ready to faint,
would be too feeble a description of the

<pb n="311"/>
effect this spectre had on me.  I was
senseless, I almost died away.  Mrs. Gerrarde
pretended to be greatly alarmed;
she ran for drops, and having given me
a few in a glass of water, I made a shift
to rise of my chair, and telling her I
should be glad of a little air, tottered to
the street door.  I determined to go home
directly, but the universal tremor I was
now in, disabled me from walking, and
I sat down in the porch to recover myself
a little.  Mr. Faulkland's having been a
witness to the agony his presence had
thrown me into, did not a little aggravate
the horror and confusion of my
thoughts.  Whatever <hi rend="italic">his</hi> were, he had
no spoke to me, nor was it possible for
me to have remarked his behaviour: I
staid not more than two minutes in the
parlour after he entered.  In this situation
you will think my distress would hardly
admit of any addition; but the final blow
was yet to come.  Mrs. Gerrarde had
staid a minute in the parlour to speak to
Mr. Faulkland after I went out, but presently
followed me, and was soothing me

<pb n="312"/>
with the kindest expressions, when I heard
the trampling of horses, and presently
beheld Mr. Arnold alighting at the door.
I now gave myself up for lost.  My mind
suddenly suggested to me that Mrs. Gerrarde
had contrived a plot upon my innocence;
but how she had been able to
bring it about, my thoughts were not then
disengaged enough to conceive.  My
mind was all a chaos; I was not able to
answer Mr. Arnold when he spoke to me.
He soon perceived my disorder, and inquired
the cause.  Mrs. Gerrarde took
upon her to answer, that I was just preparing
to go home, when I was taken
suddenly ill.  I was going abroad, said she,
and as I ordered the chariot much about
this hour, I fancy it is ready, and may as
well carry Mrs. Arnold home; you had
best step into the parlour, my dear (to me)
till it is brought to the door.
</p>
<p>I am now able to walk, madam, said
I; there is no occasion to give you that
trouble.  Mr. Arnold said, I should not
walk by any means; and Mrs. Gerrarde
immediately calling a servant to order

<pb n="313"/>
the chariot to the door, said, as she was
going out, she would leave me at home
herself.  Mr. Arnold answered, it would
be the best way, and that he should follow
soon.  The chariot was presently at the
door.  and I was preparing to get into it,
when Mrs. Gerrarde cry'd, Bless me I
had forgot, it will not be so civil to leave
the gentleman behind, without saying any
thing to him.  Mr. Arnold hastily asked,
What gentleman?  Mrs. Gerrarde replied,
Mr. Faulkland, <hi rend="italic">who took it into
his head</hi> to make me a visit this evening.
She went quickly into the parlour, and
strait returned with Mr. Faulkland; who
bowing carelessly to Mr. Arnold, and
civilly to me, walked away.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde stepped into the chariot
to me, and ordered it to drive to my
house, leaving Mr. Arnold standing
motionless at her door.
</p>
<p>A total silence prevailed on my side
during our short journey home, except to
answer in monosyllables Mrs. Gerrarde's
repeated inquiries after my health.  She
set me down at my own door, and took

<pb n="314"/>
her leave without alighting.  When I
found myself alone, I began to consider
the consequences of this evening's fatal
interview; an interview, which, though
unthought of by me, I judged was contrived
to ensnare me.  I laid all the circumstances
together, and endeavoured to
unravel the clue.  "Tis plain to me Mr.
Arnold was expected by Mrs. Gerrarde
this evening.  She sent for me on purpose
to betray me; the message, which she
pretended was delivered wrong, was only
an artifice, in order to impose on Mr.
Arnold, that he might imagine she did
not expect me.  Indeed, he could not
possibly think she should send for me on
the very evening he was to be with her;
and she had so well guarded her contrivance,
that it was not easily to be detected.
She had sent her message by word of
mouth, though she generally wrote them
down on paper, but this way would not
have been liable to misconstruction; she
had told me she was engaged in the evening,
yet detained me longer than I meant
to stay.  From the first of these circumstances,

<pb n="315"/>
it must appear to Mr. Arnold, that
as I had come unwished for, she wanted
to get rid of me; the latter obviously
served her own purpose; for it is as clear
as daylight that she laid her plan so as
that Mr. Arnold should find Mr. Faulkland
and me together.  All this I have
deduced from a long train of reasoning
on the circumstances.  But the inexplicable
part of the mystery is, how she contrived
to get Mr. Faulkland, with whom
I did not think she was acquainted, to
visit her at so fatally critical a juncture.
Sure some evil spirit must have assisted
her in this wicket scheme: she knew, no
doubt, of the promise Mr. Arnold had
exacted of me, never to see him.  The
apparent breach of this promise, she may
have art enough to persuade Mr. Arnold
was concerted on my side.  But I hope I
shall be able to clear myself of this cruel
imputation to my husband.  Truth <hi rend="italic">must</hi>
force its way into his mind, if he is not
resolved on my destruction.  Perhaps Mr.
Faulkland may be secretly Mrs. Gerrarde's
admirer, and Mr. Arnold is the dupe to

<pb n="315"/>
her perfidy, as I am the sacrifice to her
malice and licentiousness.&mdash;'Tis all a
strange riddle, but I cannot remain long
in this dismal state of suspence; Mr. Arnold,
perhaps, may discover her treachery,
while she is endeavouring to destroy me
in his good opinion.
</p>
<p>I am waiting here like a poor criminal,
in expectation of appearing before my
judge.  I wish Mr. Arnold were come
in, yet I dread to see him.
</p>
<p>I might have spared myself the anxiety.
Mr. Arnold is just returned, but
he has locked himself into another chamber.
I will not molest him to-night! to-morrow, perhaps, he may be in better
temper, and I may be able to justify myself
to him, and dispel this frightful
gloom that hangs over us.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d121">
	<head><date value="1705-09-14"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 14.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Hopes and fears are
at an end, and the measure of my afflictions
is filled up.
</p>
<p>I went to bed last night, but slept not;
the hours were passed in agonies not to be
described.  I think all griefs are magnified

<pb n="317"/>
by silence and darkness.  I well knew,
prepossessed as Mr. Arnold was by my
artful enemy, I should find it difficult to
excuse myself, or persuade him, that
chance, or Mrs. Gerrarde's more wicked
contrivance, had been the sole cause of
what had given him such offence.  I was
resolved, however, to vindicate my innocence,
and was, in my own thoughts, preparing
my defence the greatest part of the
night.  Towards morning, weariness and
grief overpowered me, and I fell asleep,
but I enjoyed not this repose long.  Some
noise that was made in the house suddenly
awakened me; I saw it was broad day,
and looking at my watch, found it was
past sever o'clock.  I rang my bell, and
Patty entering my room, I enquired if her
master was yet stirring.,  The poor girl looked
aghast.  He is gone away on horseback,
madam, said she, almost two hours ago;
and he ordered his man to put up some linnen
and a few other things in a small portmanteau.
I believe he means not to return
to-night; for he bid me to deliver this
letter to you.  I opened the letter with trembling

<pb n="318"/>
hands, from whence I received my
doom in the following words:
</p>
<div4 type="epistle" id="d122">
<head><name type="recipient">Sidney</name>
</head>
<p>"You have broke your faith with me,
in seeing the man whom I forbad you to
see, and whom you so solemnly promised
to avoid.  As you have betrayed my confidence
in this particular, I can no longer
rely on your prudence or your fidelity.
Whatever your designs may be, it will
be less to my dishonour, if you prosecute
them from under your husband's roof.
I therefore give you till this day se'nnight
to consider of a place for your future
abode; for one house must no more contain
two people whose hearts are divided.
Our children remain with me, and the
settlement which was made on you in
marriage, shall be appropriated to your
separate use.
</p>
<p>I have left home to avoid expostulations,
nor shall I return to it till I hear
you have removed yourself.  Spare the attempt
of a justification, which can only
aggravate the resentment of your already
too-much injured husband."</p>

<p>I have for a while suppressed the tumult
in my soul, to give you this shocking
letter.
</p>
<p>O my Cecilia! what a wretched lot is
thy unhappy friend's!  To be neglected,
forsaken, despised, by a husband that I
love!  Yet I could bear that: but to be
suspected, accused too! to be at once the
miserable object of jealousy and scorn!
Surely they know nothing of the human
heart, who say that jealousy cannot subsist
without affection; I have a fatal proof to
the contrary.  Mr. Arnold loves me not,
yet doubts my honour.  Cruel, mean,
detestable suspicion!  Oh that vile woman!
'tis she has done this; like a persecuting
daemon, she urges on the ruin which she
set on foot.
</p>
<p>What can I do?  Whither can I fly?  I
cannot remain here any longer; my presence
banishes Mr. Arnold from his home.
If I go to my mother under such circumstances,
it will break her heart; yet she
must know it.  I must not wait to be
turned out of my own doors.  That
thought is not to be borne.  I will go this
instant, no matter whither.

<p>God preserve me in
my senses!  I have passed two days and
two nights I know not how; in silence
and without food, Patty tells me.  But
I think I am a little recovered.  I will
write to my mother, and beg of her to
open her arms to receive her miserable
child.  I am collected enough, and know
what to say.
</p>
<p>I had just dispatched my letter, incoherent
as it is, and blotted with my tears,
when Patty brought me one that had
come by the post.  I knew my dear mother's
hand on the superscription, and
kissed it before I opened it.  See, my
sister, how the tenderest of parents writes
to her unhappy child, whom she fondly
believes to be the darling of her husband,
and blessed with domestic felicity.

<opener>My beloved Sidney,</opener>
<p>I find age and infirmities are advancing
a-pace upon me.  My last illness
shook me severely, and has left a memorandum
of what I may expect in the next
visit it makes me.  Your family cares

<pb n="321"/>
are now so much enlarged, that I cannot
expect, nor do I desire that you should
undertake a journey to Sidney Castle to
pay me a short visit; yet, my dear, as you
are the comfort of my age, I cannot, in
the present precarious state of my health,
bear to be at such a distance from you;
while God permits me strength I will lay
hold of his bounty, and endeavour to get
to London.  You have told me that you
are not conveniently circumstanced at
South-park as to room; I will not therefore
incommode you, but shall content
myself with waiting your arrival in town,
at your house in St. James's street; but
do not hasten your departure from the
country on this account.  I am in no immediate
danger, my dear, only willing to
lay hold of an interval of health, to get
nearer to you.  If God prolongs my
life, what joy will it be to me to spend
next winter with my darling, and her dear
good Arnold, and to feast my eyes with
my lovely grandchildren!
</p>
<p>If I am called from you, I shall have
the comfort of my child's affectionate

<pb n="322"/>
hands to close my eyes; and shall leave
the world without regret, as I have lived
to see my Sidney happy in the arms of a
good man, who will supply the loss of
parents, and unite in himself those tender
ties which nature must soon dissolve.
</p>
<p>My prayers for yours, and my dear
son's prosperity, I never fail to offer up
to heaven.  Your brother George is with
me, and desires to be remembered to you;
he purposes staying here the greatest part
of the winter.
</p>
<p>As I hope to reach London by the latter
end of the week, direct your next to
me at your own house in town.

<div4 type="section" id="d126">
<p>My heart is bursting&mdash;O Cecilia!
What will become of my fond, my dear,
venerable parent, when she finds this
daughter, this comfort of her age, this
beloved of her soul, a poor abandoned

<pb n="323"/>
outcast; lost to her husband's love, turned
out of his doors, despised, disgraced!  My
children too&mdash;I must leave them behind
&mdash;My God, for what calamities
hast thou ordained thy creature!  Tears,
tears, you may well flow!
</p>
<p>So!  I am relieved, and will endeavour
to fortify my soul against the two events,
that appear to me horrid as an approaching
execution to a guilty wretch, the parting
with my children, and the meeting
with my mother.  As the letter I wrote
will miss of her at Sidney Castle, I shall
write to London, to prepare her to receive
the wretch whom her imagination
has figured to her so happy.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash;!  I hear her coming up stairs
&mdash;I cannot conceal my affliction, nor my
disgrace.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; has left me: let me in
astonishment and new horror.  Mrs. Gerrarde!
Who do you think Mrs. Gerrarde
is?  She is the aunt of Miss Burchell, that
aunt who betrayed her to destruction.
Sure this woman was sent into the world
for a scourge!

<pb n="324"/>
</p>
<p>I cannot collect myself to tell you with
any method, the conversation that passed
between Lady V&mdash; and me.  She found
me with the marks of tears on my face;
they streamed again at the sight of her;
I could not conceal the cause, and I put
Mr. Arnold's letter into her hands, for I
was not able to tell her the purport of
it.
</p>
<p>This is Mrs. Gerrarde's doing, said
she: the detestable creature!  How could
she work on your infatuated husband, to
drive him such horrid lengths?  I know
not, said I, but I hope my lady V&mdash; believes
me innocent.  Innocent! she exclaimed:
My dear creature, your sufferings
almost make me mad.  Do you know
that Mrs. Gerrarde has an intrigue with
your husband?  I fear so, madam, I replied,
but I hoped it was not public.  Poor
child, said lady V&mdash;, his attachment to her
has been no secret, ever since he came
down to this country, though probably
you were the last to suspect it.  I have
often dreaded the consequences of it,
but never imagined it would have come

<pb n="325"/>
to this; I always had a bad opinion of
the woman, and only kept up a face of
civility to her in her husband's time, on
account of her niece, a charming girl that
then lived with her; but since Miss Burchell
has left her, I have almost dropt
my acquaintance with her; though my
lord, who had an old friendship for captain
Gerrarde, persuades me to be civil
to her.
</p>
<p>The name of Miss Burchell had struck
me speechless.  The clue was now unravelled.
With what an unremitting zeal
has this base woman gone on in her career
of iniquity!  Lady V&mdash;, who was intirely
taken up with the thoughts of my unhappiness,
took no notice of my silence or
confusion.  What do you mean to do,
my dear Mrs. Arnold? said she.  Do you
think it is not possible, by the interposition
of friends, to disabuse your unfortunate
husband?  For unfortunate he is in a
higher degree than yourself, as you have
conscious innocence to support you.  Oh
madam, said  I, it is vain to think of
it!  Mrs. Gerrarde has struck the blow

<pb n="326"/>
effectually.  Were Mr. Arnold left to the
workings of his own heart, he might,
perhaps, relent; but that woman, like
my evil genius and his, will take care
to keep his suspicions alive.  She possesses
his whole heart, and my removal is become
necessary to the quiet of them both.
I have taken my resolution, I will immediately
quit this house, and leave it to a
righteous God to vindicate me in his own
time.  You should go no where but to
my house, said lady V&mdash;, with tears in her
eyes, but that I think it an improper
situation for you, while Mr. Faulkland is
my guest.  He will be distracted when
he hears of this.  I conjured lady V&mdash; not
to tell him: My being parted from my
husband cannot long be a secret, said I,
but the cause may.  Lady V&mdash; told me
that Mr. Faulkland was that very morning
set out for Sidney Castle to see my
brother, having received a letter from
him the day before, in which he told
him that my mother was going in a day
or two to London, and begged he would
come and spend a week with him.  She

<pb n="273"/><note></note>
added, Mr. Faulkland purposed doing so,
and then to return to V&mdash;hall, as my lord
had obtained a promise from him to stay
some time longer with them; at least till
the old lady's affairs were settled, who
had left her fortune to Mr. Faulkland,
and to whom my lord V&mdash; was executor.
</p>
<p>I told lady V&mdash;, I depended on her
friendship to keep this affair a secret
from Mr. Faulkland, lest the heat of his
temper should make him take such notice
of it, as might render my separation from
Mr. Arnold doubly injurious to my character.
Lady V&mdash; saw the necessity of this
caution, and promised to observe it.  She
expressed great surprize at Mr. Faulkland's
visiting Mrs. Gerrarde, whom she
said, she did not imagine he had been acquainted
with.  He is no stranger, said
she, to your husband's amour with her,
as it has often been a topic of discourse
between my lord and me; and I can
hardly think he would be so indelicate as
to carry on a love-affair with such an
abandoned creature; especially as I have

<pb n="328"/>
often heard him express the utmost detestation
of her, on account of her robbing
you of your husband's affection;
which I had observed for a good while.
But there is no knowing mankind, added
she: if that should be the case, you may
depend upon it that vile Gerrarde has
laid her plan deeper than we are aware of,
and would out-swear us all, that Faulkland
came to her house for no other purpose,
than to have an opportunity of seeing
you; who to be sure, she said, had
given him a private hint to meet you
there.  Now the worst of it is, it is impossible
to have this matter cleared up to
your husband, without Mr. Faulkland's
concurrence, and that you will not consent
to.  By no means, I replied, I would
not for the world have Mr. Faulkland
interfere in my justification.  If the affair
should really be as you have suggested,
a little time may, perhaps, discover this
wicked woman to Mr. Arnold, and it
will not then be so difficult to clear my
innocence.  At present, her influence

<pb n="329"/>
over him is too powerful for me to combat
with; and I know he wishes for nothing
more than to free himself from the
restraint that my presence lays him under.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; acquiesced in my opinion,
and said, she hoped a little time would
chace away the dark cloud that now
hung over me.  She staid with me the
whole day; it was a day of tears: the
dear woman was quite subdued at parting
with me.  I shall see you no more, dear
lady V&mdash;, said I; I shall go to London in
two days&mdash;Preserve your fortitude,
dearest Mrs. Arnold, she replied; the time
will come when your husband will repent
of the bitter distress he has occasioned to
you: my lord and I will use our utmost
endeavours to convince him of his error.
&mdash;We shall meet in London, my dear;
I shall go thither early in the winter on
purpose&mdash;Have courage&mdash;Your innocence
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> be cleared.  I answered her not,
my heart was too full.  We embraced,
and lady V&mdash; parted from me in silence.

<pb n="330"/>
</p>
<p>I have written to my mother, and directed
my letter to St. James's-street.  I
would have her prepared for the shock
before she sees me; a shock, which I fear
she will not be able to sustain.

<p>Mrs. Gerrarde has
never called or sent to me since I was at
her house.  She has effected her purpose,
and is contented without a triumph.
</p>
<p>I am prepared for my departure.  To-morrow I turn my back upon my husband's
house, and upon my children.  I
have been weeping over them this hour
as they lie asleep in their nurse's arms.
But I will look at them no more.&mdash;Poor
Patty is almost dead with grief; she would
fain go with me, but I have persuaded
her to stay: I can rely on her fidelity and
her tenderness towards my children; she
says, she will be as precious of them as
the apple of her eye, and will give me an
account of their welfare from time to
time.  Sure Mr. Arnold will not turn
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> out too; she is an excellent manager,

<pb n="331"/>
and he cannot do without a house-keeper.
</p>
<p>I have been debating with myself whether
I should write to Mr. Arnold or not,
and have at length determined to depart
in silent.  It is an easy matter for
the guilty to make as bold asseverations
as the innocent, and nothing which I
could now assert would make an impression
on him.  Had I only his suspicions to
combat, there might be hopes: but
his <hi rend="italic">heart</hi> is alienated from me; and while
it continues attached to another, I despair
of his listening to the voice of reason or
of justice.  If ever his eyes are opened,
his error will prove sufficient punishment
to him&mdash;Perhaps my mother or my brother
may put me in a way&mdash;My conduct,
in time, I hope, may justify me&mdash;Mean
while I will not condescend to the weak
justification of words.

<div3 type="entry" id="d128">
	<head><date value="1705-09-18"><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 18.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have bid adieu to
South-park, and arrived this morning
in London in a hired carriage; for I

<pb n="332"/>
would not take one of Mr. Arnold's.  I
found my mother at the house in St.
James's-street, where I now am: she got
here last night, and my letter had thrown
her into agonies, from which she had not
yet recovered.  What have you wrote to
me? said she, as she held me in her arms;
your dreadful letter has almost killed me.
&mdash;Sure, sure, my dear child, it cannot be
true that you have left your husband!
What is the cause?  What have <hi rend="italic">you</hi> done?
or, What has <hi rend="italic">he</hi> done?  I begged my mother
to compose herself a little, and then
related to her every circumstance, in the
same manner you have had them, as they
occurred.  Her lamentations pierced my
heart; she wrung her hands in bitterness
of anguish; Why did not the grave hide
me, said she, before I saw shame and sorrow
heaped upon my child!  I came to
die in peace with you&mdash;You might have
lengthened my days for a while&mdash;But you
cut them off&mdash;My eyes will close in affliction
&mdash;A wounded spirit who can bear!
Had you died in your cradle, we had

<pb n="333"/>
both been happy.  My child would now
have been a cherub! an angel you have
been in my eyes, and I am punished for
it; but that was <hi rend="italic">my</hi> crime, not your's.
But you are a martyr to the crimes of
others.
</p>
<p>My mother wept not all this time; I
wished she had; her passionate looks and
tones affected me more than tears could.
My eyes began to run over, her's soon
accompanied me, and it a little relieved
the vehemence of her grief.
</p>
<p>She then began to reproach herself for
having listened to lady Grimston's suggestions
in favour of Mr. Arnold, and
for her own soliciting this fatal marriage.
But I stopped her on a subject which
I knew would so much torment her
thoughts.  I conjured her not to reflect
on it in that manner; I told her I knew
she had acted for the best, and that nothing
but an extraordinary fatality, which
could neither be foreseen nor avoided,
had made me unhappy.  I said I was
sure Mr. Arnold had been seduced by the

<pb n="334"/>
wiles of a wicked woman, for that he was
by nature a good man, and that he had
more of my pity than of my resentment.
</p>
<p>I found it necessary to reconcile my
mother to herself on this head; she seemed
willing to lay hold on the hint, and
turned all her indignation against Mrs.
Gerrarde.  A <hi rend="italic">practiced</hi> sinner, she called
her, for whom nothing could be said in
extenuation of her crime.
</p>
<p>We now turned our thoughts towards
fixing on some other abode.  You may
be sure Mr. Arnold's house is no place
for us; and my mother declared, she
would not stay another night in it: accordingly
we have dispatched her maid
to take us lodgings immediately.

<div3 type="entry" id="d129">

<p>We have quickly shifted
the scene, my dear Cecilia, and are settled,
at least for the present, in very handsome
lodgings in St. Alban's-street.  We
came to them last night, and my mother
seems a little less disturbed than she was.
I pray God spare her life, but I fear I

<pb n="335"/>
shall not long enjoy that blessing.  She
is sadly altered since I last saw her; a
dropsical complaint is stealing on her fast,
her legs are swelled, and she has intirely
lost her appetite; yet if her mind were a
little more at ease, I should hope, that by
the assistance she can have here, she might
be enabled to hold out against this disorder
for a good while.  I endeavour to
suppress my own grief, that I may not
increase her's.</p>

<p>I WAS surprized to-day by a visitor
to my mother.  Miss Burchell came to
pay her respects to her: I have told you
they corresponded.  My mother, it seems,
had given her notice of the time she intended
being in town: the young lady
had been to wait on her in St. James's-street, and was from thence directed by
the servant, who kept the house, to our
new lodgings.

<pb n="2"/>
</p>
<p>She is really a very lovely young woman;
and there is something so insinuating
in her manner, that there is no seeing
her without being prejudiced in her favour.
She changed colour when my mother
presented me to her by my name;
but, at the same time, surveyed me with
a scrutinous eye.  My mother asked her,
had she seen Mr. Faulkland since his return
to England.  She answered, No, with
a sigh; but that she believed he had been
at Putney.  To see his son? said my mother,
without reflecting, that Miss Burchell had
avoided mentioning that circumstance,
and stopped upon naming the place
where the child was at nurse.  Yes, she
replied, in a timorous accent, and stealing
a look at me.  The woman told me,
that a young gentleman had been there
about six weeks ago, who said he came
from the child's father abroad, and made
her a handsome present.  As I did not
then know Mr. Faulkland was returned
to England, I should not have suspected
it was he himself who had called, if his
housekeeper (that gentlewoman in whose

<pb n="3"/>
care he left me) had not come to me
from him.  She is settled now in a lodging-house; and Mr. Faulkland, on his
coming to London, went to her, to inquire
where the child was.  She told me
he inquired civilly after me, and gave her
a letter for me, which the good-natured
woman joyfully brought me; but it contained
nothing but a bill of a hundred
pounds, with two or three lines, polite
indeed, but not kind, to inform me it
was for the child's use; and I have heard
nothing of his since.
</p>
<p>My mother told her, that as Mr.
Faulkland was returned again, probably
to continue in England, she did not despair
of his being brought o do her justice;
especially as she must suppose the sight of
the child had made an impression on him.
She then, without ceremony, entered into
a detail of my unhappy story: she was
full of it; and being, as you know, of a
very communicative temper, made no
scruple to inform Miss Burchell of every
particular.  She seemed very much affected
with the story, and grew red and

<pb n="4"/>
pale by turns; especially at finding her
aunt so deeply concerned in it.  She exclaimed
against her barbarity, reproached
Mr. Arnold for his injurious suspicions,
and condoled obligingly with me on the
wrongs I had received; and yet, my Cecilia,
would you believe it, I thought I
could discover, through all this, that Miss
Burchell was not intirely free from doubt
in regard to my innocence.  This observation
I gathered only from certain looks
that she cast at me, as my mother related
the passages.  There are little minute
touches on the countenance sometimes,
which are so transient they can hardly be
overtaken by the eye, and which, from
the passions being strongly guarded that
give rise to these emotions, are so slight,
that a common observer cannot discover
them at all.  I am sure my mother did
not; but my sensibility was particularly
rouzed at her relating a story that I did
not then wish to have divulged; and I was
too much interested in the narrative, not
to attend precisely to its effects on the
hearer.  I am neither angry with, or

<pb n="5"/>
surprized at, Miss Burchell, for her scepticism
on this occasion.  She loves Mr.
Faulkland, and had not herself the power
to resist him: she knows he once loved
me, and may fansy he does so still; nay,
thinks perhaps I am not indifferent towards
him: she is a stranger to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> heart;
but is convinced that her aunt is base
enough, first to ensnare to vice, and then
to betray.  Upon the whole, there is nothing
unnatural in her suspicions; but I
think they could not proceed from a virtuous
mind.
</p>
<p>Upon Miss Burchell's taking leave, my
mother gave her a general invitation to
come to her as often as she had leisure:
telling her, she must not take it amiss if
she did not return her visits, as her health
would not permit her to go much abroad.
</p>
<p>Miss Burchell, it seems, has a house
(not lodgings) in a retired street in Westminster,
where she has been ever since she
quitted her aunt, to whom she never discovered
where she lived.  Her fortune
enables her to appear very genteely in the
private manner she chooses to live.  She

<pb n="6"/>
goes but seldom into publick, and has
but a narrow circle of acquaintance.
Those are all of her own sex, and of the
best character; and she has had the good
fortune to preserve her reputation unsuspected;
so that, I hope, she may yet retrieve
her error by an advantageous match,
should Mr. Faulkland still continue averse
to her.

<p>I have had a letter from
Patty: she tells me her master is returned
home; and adds, 'To be sure, that vile
wicked wretch let him know you were
gone.'  She says, he called for the two
dear babes, and kissed them both.  Patty
carried the youngest to him in her arms,
the other in her hand, and she says, he
looked troubled.  How came you not to
follow your lady, Mrs. Martha? said he.
She replied, My lady was willing, Sir,
that I should stay to look after the children
&mdash;And to be a spy upon my actions,
I suppose: Is not that to be part of your
employment too?  Ah! Patty, Patty; Mrs.
Arnold had better have looked to her own

<pb n="7"/>
conduct.  Patty made no answer, but retired
in tears.  Every one in the house,
she writes, is broken-hearted; but that
Mr. Arnold is never at home, spending
his whole time with Mrs. Gerrarde, whom
the girl, in the overflowings of her zeal
for me, heartily execrates.  She informed
him, that I was gone to London, and
purposed living with my mother, who
was now there.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d134">
	<head><date value="1705-10-07"><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 7.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>I have just received a letter
from lady V&mdash;.  She tells me she sent
twice to invite Mr. Arnold to dine with
them, in order, if possible, to lead him
into a conversation, by which they hoped,
in some measure, to have cleared my innocence,
as my lord could take upon him
to justify Mr. Faulkland; but he declined
coming, not knowing, perhaps, that Mr.
Faulkland was absent from V&mdash;hall.  She
said, her lord had gone to South-park;
but neither Mr. Arnold was not at home,
or denied himself.  My lady adds, 'It
is a delicate affair to interpose in; yet
would I have ventured to have wrote to

<pb n="8"/>
your husband, if I had been sure that you
had no objection to my telling him, that
you had made me privy to the cause of
your parting: 'tis plain, by his avoiding
us, it is a subject he does not care
to come to an explanation upon.  Let
me have your sentiments, and I will act
accordingly.'
</p>
<p>I shall answer lady V&mdash;'s letter directly,
and beg of her to leave the matter as it is.
Mrs. Gerrarde's testimony will have more
weight than all my good lord or lady
could urge in my favour: besides, they
are not furnished with sufficient weapons
to combat against such an enemy: they
know nothing of Miss Burchell's story;
my regard to <hi rend="italic">her</hi> character prevented me
from giving my lady this specimen of her
aunt's baseness.  I suppose the same reason
may have closed Mr. Faulkland's lips on
that subject: so that they have nothing to
allege against Mrs. Gerrarde, which would
help to invalidate her testimony with regard
to Mr. Faulkland and me.  Mr.
Arnold, indeed, knows that she has forfeited
her pretensions to modesty; but the

delusion of self-love blinds a man in those
cases; and he can believe, that <hi rend="italic">truth</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">justice</hi>, inhabit the bosom of
her, whose passion for <hi rend="italic">him</hi> alone has caused
a deviation from chastity.
</p>
<p>I cannot think of exposing the poor
Miss Burchell by giving up her secret.
Though it might contribute to clear me,
by turning Mr. Arnold's suspicions on
Mrs. Gerrarde, yet would she have great
reason to resent it; more especially as she
is now, by a blameless life, endeavouring
to blot out the memory of her fault.
Though my lady V&mdash; is very prudent,
her zeal for me, and my lord's good-natured earnestness in my cause, might
render them unguarded on the occasion;
and should they attempt to make use of
this secret, in order to criminate Mrs.
Gerrarde, it might at the same time,
bring malicious censures both on Miss
Burchell and Mr. Faulkland.
</p>
<p>I think, upon the whole, my mother is
the properest person to mediate on this
nice occasion.  When Mr. Arnold comes
to town; she can, with due tenderness to

<pb n="10"/>
the young lady, disclose the whole affair
to him.  The knowledge of this black
part of Mrs. Gerrarde's character, joined
to her arguments, may perhaps have some
weight; though, to tell you the secret
bodings of my heart, I expect not much
from this.  I have lost my husband's love;
Mrs. Gerrarde possesses it all; and who
knows whether he even wishes to lose his
pretence for abandoning an unhappy wife.
I wish, however, Mr. Faulkland were returned
to V&mdash;hall: should Mr. Arnold
know of his absence at this juncture, he
might imagine possibly he was gone in
quest of me.

<p>How the scene is changed,
my Sister!  What a melancholy reverse
is here, to my late prospect of domestic
happiness!  I pass my nights in tears and
bitter reflections on my dismal situation.
My days are spent in a painful constraint,
to conceal the anguish of my own heart,
that I may not aggravate that of my poor
mother.  My endeavours to be chearful,
I perceive, have a good effect on her: she

<pb n="11"/>
is much more composed, and seems resigned
to our fate, patiently waiting for a
change.  I think too she is rather better
in her health; she has had the advice of
a physician of eminent skill; the medicines
prescribed, he gives us hopes, will
keep her disorder at least from gaining
ground; and that she may hold out for
some years.
</p>
<p>I have prevailed on her not to give Sir
George an account of my unhappy story,
till I hear that Mr. Faulkland has left
him; because I know my brother would
conceal nothing from him; and, if possible,
I would have Mr. Arnold's suspicions
of <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> concealed.  I have many
reasons for this; my own delicacy would
receive a wound by it; for who knows
what judgment Mr. Faulkland might
form on this knowledge?  But my most
material objection is, should he attempt
to vindicate his own honour, what might
be the consequence!  I shudder to think
of it.  I know Mr. Faulkland is rash,
when provoked.  Rather let my sufferings
and my disgrace lie wrapped in oblivion,
than bring any disaster on the father
of my children.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d136">
	<head><date value="1705-10-16"><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 16.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>Another letter from lady
V&mdash;.  She tells me, that Mr. Faulkland
is returned from his visit to my brother.
He was soon informed of my parting
with Mr. Arnold: 'tis the talk of the
neighbourhood; every body lays it on
Mrs. Gerrarde.  Mr. Faulkland was very
inquisitive to learn particulars from my
lady, which, he said, he was sure I had
told her; but she took care not to give
him the least hint which could lead him
to suppose that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> had any share in my
fate.  She says, he raves like a madman;
and that she finds it absolutely necessary
to keep him in ignorance of the truth.
She was obliged to tell him, that my having
discovered Mr. Arnold's amour with
Mrs. Gerrarde, she believed, was the sole
cause of our separation.  He asked her,
Was she <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> there was no other? adding,
That he thought my temper had been too
gentle to fly, on a sudden, to such extremes.
My lady took occasion to ask

<pb n="13"/>
him, Whether he did not visit Mrs. Gerrarde?
He replied, He did sometimes,
having formerly known her at Bath.  She
concludes with telling me, That Mr. Arnold
is become quite invisible to every
friend he has, Mrs. Gerrarde engrossing
him wholly.
</p>
<p>I hope Mr. Faulkland may not suspect
how much he is concerned in my misfortune;
my absenting myself, for some time
before I left home, from V&mdash;hall, and my
departure from my husband, immediately
after my interview with Mr. Faulkland
at Mrs. Gerrarde's, may raise some distrust
in his mind; but, while it continues
merely surmise, he can have no pretence
for requiring an explanation from Mr.
Arnold; so that if my husband keeps
his own council, which he seems inclined
to do, and my lord and lady V&mdash; preserve
the secret, I shall rest satisfied.

<p>My mother has wrote to
Sir George, and given him a full account
of my situation, with a request,
which I prevailed on her to make, that

<pb n="14"/>
he would not take any notice of the affair
till he saw us.  My brother, perhaps,
may think of a way, with tenderness and
safety, to remove Mr. Arnold's doubts,
without farther exposing my reputation,
or laying my husband open to mischief.
A prudent, cool, and at the same time
zealous friend, might devise some means
to effect this; but I fear my brother's
disregard to Mr. Arnold, his diminished
love for me, and his resentment to my
mother, will prevent him from engaging
with that alacrity or precaution that the
nicety of circumstances may require.  I
will, therefore, wait with patience, till
God, in his own time, shall raise me
from the state of humiliation into which
I am fallen.
</p></div3>
<div3 type="entry" id="d138">

<p>With what a tortoise pace
does time advance to the wretched! how
dismal are those hours which are spent in
reflecting on lost happiness!  O Faulkland!
how light was thy transgression, if
we consider the consequences, compared
to that which has driven me from my

<pb n="15"/>
home, and from my children! steeled my
husband's heart against me, heaped infamy
on <hi rend="italic">my</hi> head, and loaded my mother's
age with sorrow and remorse!  All this is
the fatal consequence of Mr. Arnold's
breach of his marriage-vow: all this, and
much more, I fear, that is to come.
</p>
<p>We keep ourselves intirely concealed
from the knowlege of all our acquaintance;
not a mortal visits us, but, now-and-then, Miss Burchell; and I have never
stirred out of doors but to church.

<p>Sir George has answered
my mother's letter, just as I feared he
would: he speaks of Mr. Arnold with
more contempt and aversion, than he does
of me with pity or brotherly kindness.
He says, 'It is well for him, that Mr.
Faulkland knows not of his injurious
suspicion of him, or he would vindicate
himself in a manner he little thinks of.'
He tells us, he does not know (at this
distance) how to advise; but that as I
am of so <hi rend="italic">patient</hi> and <hi rend="italic">forbearing</hi> a spirit, he
thinks my wrongs may sleep till he comes

<pb n="16"/>
to town, which cannot yet be these three
or four weeks, having leases to renew with
his tenants, and abundance of other business
to do in the country.&mdash;So much for
George's tenderness.

<div3 type="entry" id="d140">
	<head><date value="1705-10-29"><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 29.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>My comforts are circumscribed
within a very narrow compass;
for I cannot reckon one, but what I receive
from poor Patty's letters, who never
fails to send me weekly an account of
my dear little children.  They are well,
thank God, and not yet abandoned by
their father; but even the knowledge of
this is imbittered by repeated hints of Mr.
Arnold's lost condition.  Lost, I may call
it: for his whole soul is absorbed in the
mad pursuit of his own ruin.  The poor
girl, in the bitterness of her indignation,
tells me, he has made Mrs. Gerrarde a
present of a favourite little pad of mine:
she says, she had a mind to tear her off,
when she saw her mounted upon it.
</p>
<p>I wish not to be told of amy of Mr.
Arnold's motions, and should forbid Patty
to write to me any thing on the subject,

<pb n="17"/>
but that I fear my letter might fall into
Mr. Arnold's hands: his curiosity might
lead him to open it (for the conscious
mind will descend to meannesses); and,
if he should see my prohibition, he would
be satisfied that his servant was too free
in her censures.  I am sure he is quite
unconcerned at <hi rend="italic">my</hi> knowing his conduct;
but I would not, nevertheless, for my
childrens sake, bring this tender, faithful,
poor creature into disgrace with him, by
convincing him of the liberty she takes,
though he may very naturally suspect it.

<div3 type="entry" id="d141">
	<head><date value="1705-10-30"><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 30.&mdash;</date></head>
<p>A lady of our acquaintance,
who happened to see me at church,
came to pay me a visit to-day.  It seems,
she is intimate with the widow Arnold,
who told her, very lately, that she was
impatient for the commencement of term,
as she then expected the cause depending
between her and us would be brought to
a final issue, and determined intirely in
her child's favour.  This account alarmed
my poor mother so much, that she could
not be easy till she sent for our lawyer,

<pb n="18"/>
who was so obliging as to come upon
the first summons.  She acquainted him
with the cause of her apprehensions;
and asked him, whether there was any
likelihood of the widow's succeeding.  He
laughed at my mother's fears, and at
our antagonist's flourishes, as he called
them; and said, he would not give a
best six-pence to insure Mr. Arnold's
estate to him, which the ensuing term,
he says, will put out of the reach of
doubt.  This assurance has quieted our
anxiety on that head.  The loss of our
suit would indeed be a dreadful blow, as
we should have nothing then remaining
but my small jointure, for the support of
Mr. Arnold, myself, and our two children;
not to mention Mrs. Gerrarde,
who, I have reason to believe, has been
no inconsiderable sharer in Mr. Arnold's
fortune.

<p>Six melancholy weeks
are gone since I have been here, I may
say, both a prisoner and a fugitive.  I
count the days as they pass, as if I expected

<pb n="19"/>
some revolution in my fate; yet
whence is it to come?  No prospect as yet
opens to me.  Mr. Arnold's law-affairs
will soon call him to town: something
may then happen&mdash;But does not Mrs.
Gerrarde come too?  He cannot live without
her; and I shall reap no benefit from
this, but the chance of seeing my children
sometimes perhaps; though he may
not bring them with him, or, if he does,
he may be cruel enough to refuse me the
sight of them.  Sir George is cold and
dilatory: were he on the spot, something
might be done; he might expostulate:
my mother too could join arguments to
intreaties: Mr. Arnold perhaps might
be recovered from his delusion; it is but
a perhaps.

<p>My brother is arrived
in town sooner than we expected, and
came this evening to pay us a visit.
My altered and dejected looks, I believe,
shocked him; but George wants
tenderness, or at least a capacity of shewing
it.  After a recapitulation of my

<pb n="20"/>
story, he asked me, 'Could I be so mean-spirited a creature as ever to think of
living with Arnold again, even though
he should be inclined to desire it?'  I
told him, he considered the matter in a
wrong light; and that he ought to reflect
on my reputation, and the future welfare
of my two poor little girls, who would
be material sufferers, from the want of my
care and attention, as they grew up; not
to mention the disadvantages they would
enter into life with, by my continuing
under an aspersion which might in time
become very public, and perhaps be believed
too, as I made no doubt but that
Mrs. Gerrarde would take pains to propagate
it wherever she went.  My mother
added, Mr. Arnold too might be saved
from perdition, if he could be so far convinced
of his wife's innocence, as to be
reconciled to her, and live with her again.
And pray, said Sir George, how is this
to be done, if that damned woman has
put it into his head, that Faulkland and
you are fond of one another?  Do you
imagine that he will believe what <hi rend="italic">you</hi> say?

<pb n="21"/>
what your brother, or your mother, or
even Faulkland himself, could say to the
contrary?  I own to you very fairly, that
I so much despise the man, that, unless
you will give me leave to talk to him my
own way, I will have nothing to say to
him at all.  Would you have me <hi rend="italic">sue</hi> to
him for a reconciliation, and try to persuade
him out of the belief of an imaginary
injury, which probably he was glad
to make a handle of to get rid of you?
No, Sidney; you may be as tame as you
please yourself, but it does not become
your brother to be so.  When I go to
him, I must insist upon not having rules
prescribed to me: your delicacy, in regard
to Faulkland's asserting your innocence,
I have nothing to say against; but there
can be no objection to your brother's vindicating
the honour of his family.  I saw
Sir George's resentment was rouzed to
the highest pitch; his eyes sparkled with
indignation, and his whole frame seemed
agitated.
</p>
<p>Dear brother, said I, I conjure you
(and I fell upon my knees and clasped both

<pb n="22"/>
my arms round his) do not add to my
affliction, by involving yourself and my
husband in a fatal quarrel.  What difference
would it make to me, if Mr. Arnold
should fall, whether it is by your
hand or Mr. Faulkland's?  The loss would
be the same; the misfortune, the publication
of my disgrace, the shame.  Your
husband, said he, breaking from me,
though a little softened, would have as
good a chance as I, if it came to the
hazard; or perhaps he might condescend
to take you again (if you will have it so)
without coming to these extremities, if I
am suffered to argue properly with him.&mdash;
I will not consent to your seeing him at
all, said I, eagerly.  The cause is now
my own, he answered, coolly; but I will
do nothing to aggravate your distress.  I
did not like the manner in which he spoke.
My mother, who till now had been silent,
caught the alarm.  Let me intreat you,
son, said she, to drop the thoughts of any
violent methods with Mr. Arnold.  If
you value your sister's peace, or have
any regard to the obedience you owe me,

<pb n="23"/>
I insist on it, that you neither see him nor
write to him, without our knowlege and
consent; and if you do not promise me
this, I renounce all ties of kindred or affection
to you: your mother has as just a
sense of the honour of her family as you can
have; but it is not on so hot a head, and
so weak an arm, that she depends to see
it justified to the world.  Sir George, who
was nettled at my mother's spirited rebuke,
made her a low bow.  No doubt
of it, madam, said he, there will be a
miracle wrought in my sister's favour.  I
would have you let her try the experiment
of the ordeal: I dare say she would come
off victorious, and then Mr. Arnold will
do you the favour to take her home again.
I wish, said my mother, gravely, that there
was a possibility of bringing my dear
child's innocence to such a proof; I would
not hesitate a minute to put it to the
trial: but since there is no such a thing
<hi rend="italic">now a days</hi>, I will wait till God, in his
own righteousness, shall judge her cause,
and clear her to the world.  Therefore,
son, I insist upon your promise before
you leave me.

<pb n="24"/>
</p>
<p>I give you my word, madam, answered
Sir George, I will not attempt to hold
any conference with Mr. Arnold without
your knowledge.  Will that satisfy you?
It does, answered my mother; for I
think I can rely upon your word.  Sir
George left us not very well satisfied
with each other; his pride and resentment
piqued to the highest.  I cannot censure
him for it here: he has cause; but the
case is a nice and difficult one.  The gratification
of a private spleen ought not to
enter into the measures he should pursue.
Glad I am that my mother's properly-exerted resolution has tamed him a little.
Though George sometimes fails in the
respect which he owes her, yet I never
knew him wilfully to disobey her commands,
or oppose her inclinations.  'Tis
well there is any hold on a disposition so
ungentle and self-willed as his.

son-in-law.  He is, in reality, making his
addresses to lady Sarah P. the daughter

<p>Mr. Arnold is arrived in
town: he came late last night, and his
man called this morning to inquire how
I did.  The poor fellow stole out before
his master was up; and was afraid of
staying a minute, lest he should be wanted
at home.  I called him up to the dining-room: I saw an honest shame and sorrow
in his countenance.  How does your master
do, Frank? said I: Has he brought
the children to town?  No, madam, said
he; but they are pure and hearty.  I believe
my master thought it a pity to bring
them out of the fresh air, as long as Mrs.
Patty is there to look after them.  They
are better where they are.  I asked him,
was Mr. Arnold come to town to make

<pb n="26"/>
any stay?  I believe for good and all, said
he.  This ugly law-suit, to be sure, will
detain him; but he is come <hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, said he,
with an intelligent nod: I don't suppose
though he will continue long so.  Well,
Frank, said I, I am glad to hear your
master and the children are well.  Ah,
madam! shaking his head as he opened
the door to go out, it was a woeful day
for us when you left South-park.  God
give every one their reward!

though, if he did, I am sure he will not

have no hopes of her being able to effect
any thing in my favour: she is now laid
up with a cold, and is not able to come
out of her room; but she pleases herself
with the thoughts of this visit, as soon as
she is able to make it.  She has planned

<pb n="27"/>
what she intends to say to him; and is
resolved to let him into the whole history
of Miss Burchell, that he may know, she
says, the full extent of Mrs. Gerrarde's

woman is not capable, who could set to
sale the honour of an innocent, unsuspecting

<p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 23.&mdash;Amazing, my dear Cecilia!
I thought I should wonder no more
at any thing, yet is my wonder now raised
to astonishment&mdash;I have just received a
letter from lady V&mdash;.  I have read it over
and over again, and can yet scarce believe
my senses.  Here it is in her own words:
</p>
<div4 type="epistle" id="d148">
<head><date value="1705-11-21">17051121</date>
<name type="recipient">Sidney</name>
<name type="corresp">Lady V.</name>
</head>
<p>'I suppose you know, my dear Mrs.
'Arnold, that your husband is in town;
and that he left Mrs. Gerrarde behind
him for no other reason, I imagine, but
that he did not choose to be quite so scandalous
as to let her travel with him; for
we heard that she purposed following
him in a few days.  Patty, I conclude,
may have informed you of thus much;
but the extraordinary part of the intelligence,

<pb n="28"/>
I believe, is reserved for me to
acquaint you with.  Know then that
Mrs. Gerrarde is eloped, nobody knows
whither.  <hi rend="italic">Good</hi>, say you; good, should
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> say too; but for the conclusion of my
story.  It is with Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland</hi> she is
eloped: 'tis positively true; she went off
with him in triumph last night in her
own chariot, and neither of them have
been heard of since.  I own I am so
much confounded at this, I scarce know
what I write.'
</p>
<p>'I am very glad, for your sake, that
bad creature has quitted your husband;
but that she should have drawn my
cousin Faulkland in, is matter of serious
concern to me.  It is evident the
plan was previously concerted between
them; for I am informed to-day, that
Mrs. Gerrarde's maid decamped at the
same time, and took with her every
thing valuable belonging to her mistress,
several of her drawers being found open
and empty.  Mr. Faulkland's servants
have also disappeared; so that we cannot
conjecture which way they are gone.'

<pb n="29"/>
</p>
<p>'Mr. Faulkland, who was about leaving
us, asked my permission to give a
ball to the neighbouring ladies in our
new room, which is just finished.  As
I concluded he would ask nobody but
our own acquaintance, I readily consented;
and my lord, you know, is
fond of those frolics.  I own I was surprized
to see Mrs. Gerrarde amongst the
company, as undaunted as the <hi rend="italic">modestest</hi>
face there.  I would not however affront
Mr. Faulkland so much, as to
shew any disrespect to one, who was, at
that time, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> guest; but I was out of
all patience to find that <hi rend="italic">she</hi>, along with
several others, was asked to supper; my
too-good-natured lord joining in the invitation.
Mr. Faulkland made a pretence
to wait on her home, and the audacious
creature took that opportunity
to march off with him.
</p>
<p>'Now, as Faulkland really purposed
leaving V&mdash;hall the next day, I think it
would have been but decent in him to
have forebore this piece of barefaced libertinism,
till he was fairly from under

<pb n="30"/>
<hi rend="italic">our</hi> roof.  He might have made his assignation
in any other place; but, I suppose,
the lady had a mind to shew the
world she is above restraint, and chose
to make her infamy a sort of triumph.'
</p>
<p>'I am quite angry with my lord, for
only laughing at this, and calling it a
piece of spirited gallantry in them both.
He says, he is delighted to think how
your good man will shake his ears, when
he hears his mistress has left him in the
lurch, and gone off with another lover.
I should smile too; but that it makes me
sad to think, that Mr. Faulkland, of
whom I had so good an opinion, should
so impose upon my judgment, and forfeit
his own character, for so vile a
creature.'
</p>
<p>'Pardon me, my dear madam; I am
so full of my own reflections, on the interest
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> take in this affair, that I have
been forgetful of how much more moment
it may be to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.  Heaven grant
that your husband may think of making
himself amends, in returning to a faithful
and amiable wife, for the loss of a

<pb n="31"/>
deceitful, jilting mistress.  Surely this
event must open his eyes, or he deserves
to lose them.  I hope to embrace you

<p>Well, my Cecilia, what say you to this?
Are you not as much surprized as I am?
Mr. Faulkland to emerge at last the favoured
gallant of Mrs. Gerrarde!  Prodigious!
I confess, my dear, I am so
selfish as not to participate with lady
V&mdash; in her uneasiness on this occasion.
That Mrs. Gerrarde flies from my husband,
I am glad; and that Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland</hi>
is the very man she chose to fly with, I
am still gladder: he, of all men living,
I would have wished (though least expected)
to be the person.  This explains
every thing that is passed.  Surely, as
Lady V&mdash;says, this <hi rend="italic">must</hi> open Mr. Arnold's
eyes.  I can now discover a double

<pb n="32"/>
reason for my poor deluded man's having
his imagination poisoned with jealousy.
Mrs. Gerrarde did not aim singly at separating
my husband and me: this, perhaps,
was but a secondary consideration; or
who knows whether it was at all intended?
But she most certainly designed to secure
herself against all suspicions, by making
me the object of them; and effectually to
blind Mr. Arnold, persuaded him, that
Mr. Faulkland's visits, made to her, were
only in the hopes of seeing me.
</p>
<p>Let her views have been what they
would, this event was beyond my hopes.
Some glimmerings of comfort begin to
break in upon me.  Methinks my heart
feels much lighter than it did.  How Sir
George will stare at this account!  My mother
will life up her eyes; but she has no
opinion of Mr. Faulkland's morals, and
therefore will be the less surprized.  I pity
Miss Burchell: this is an irremediable bar
to her hopes; faint and unsupported as
they were before, they must now intirely
vanish.

<p>I gave you a copy of
Lady V&mdash;'s letter, while the subject was
warm at my heart, and before I shewed it
to any one; but my mother and my brother
have now both seen it.  My mother
(just as I expected) without any great
emotions of surprize, only exclaimed
against their wickedness; but said, she
could not help rejoicing in it, as <hi rend="italic">I</hi>,
she hoped, would derive happiness from
their accumulated crimes.  Sir George
read the letter twice over before he uttered
a word; and then said, It was <hi rend="italic">strange</hi>;
upon his soul, most unaccountable; and
that either Faulkland was run mad, or
that woman had bewitched him.  When
he was with me, said he, at Sidney Castle,
he did not so much as mention her.  I
asked him, whether he was acquainted
with Mr. Arnold (for I had written him
word of your marriage, when he was
abroad)?  He told me he had seen both
you and him two or three times at lord
V&mdash;'s; but that, as he did not wish to
renew his acquaintance with you, he had
never visited your husband.  I presume

<pb n="34"/>
he was not then a stranger to his conection
with Mrs. Gerrarde; at least to the
conjectures of the neighbourhood upon
it: but as it was then but a matter of opinion,
and he knew not of the difference between
you and your husband, 'tis probable
he did not choose to disgust me more
against my brother-in-law, by hinting at
this circumstance.  He expressed great
acknowlegements to my mother, when I
told him of the notice she had taken of
Miss Burchell; though, he said, he found
(from my account of your marriage) that
she had deferred her conference with that
young lady, till it was too late for her
testimony to be of any service to him.
As I knew nothing of what had passed
between my mother and Miss Burchell, I
could give him no satisfaction on that subject;
and the recollection of past transactions
being equally disagreeable to us
both, I avoided ever mentioning them
after our first conversation; nor do I remember
that Mrs. Gerrarde's name occurred
once.
</p>
<p>My mother now began to exult over

<pb n="35"/>
Sir George, and took advantage of the
surprize and consternation that lady V&mdash;'s
letter had thrown him into.  This is your
boasted friend, said she; the man whose
<hi rend="italic">honour</hi> and <hi rend="italic">generosity</hi> were not to be questioned,
and whose <hi rend="italic">utmost</hi> crime was a
youthful folly that he was surprized into
with a silly girl.  I am pleased, however,
that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> has proved I was not so grosly
mistaken in believing him a loose man.
Mrs. Gerrarde is the fittest mate for him,
and I am glad they are gone together.
</p>
<p>Sir George was too much mortified at
the flagrant misconduct of his friend to
attempt excusing him: he contented himself
with repeating, It was the strangest
thing he ever knew in his life.
</p>
<p>My mother then told him Mr. Arnold
was come to town; and that, as things
had taken such a turn, she hoped herself
to be able to bring him to the use of his
judgment; and therefore thought it would
not be at all necessary for my brother to
interfere.  Sir George said, With all his
heart; if her ladyship should be able to
patch up a reconciliation that would save

<pb n="36"/>
his sister's credit, and she could be so <hi rend="italic">extremely</hi>
pliant as to think of living with
such a husband again, he should not give
himself any farther trouble about the matter;
but, in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> opinion, the affair wore a
much odder aspect than it did before.  I
find Mr. Faulkland's behaviour sticks
with him, and has a little cooled his zeal
towards him.

<p>I have had a letter from
Patty, who confirms my lady V&mdash;'s account
of the lover's flight; and she tells
me one of Mrs. Gerrarde's servants is gone
off express to town; I suppose, to bring
Mr. Arnold the news; for they are all in
confusion at her house, and know not
what is become of their mistress; but
they are certain she is gone with Mr.
Faulkland.  Patty adds, The servants believe
this scheme had been long concerted,
Mr. Faulkland having been a private visitor
to their mistress for a good while.
</p><p>I must confess I am astonished at it: it
has sunk the man extremely in my opinion.

<p>Miss Burchell has just
been here.  Poor creature! she is quite
stunned with the news: she could scarce
believe it at first, till my mother desired
I would shew her lady V&mdash;'s letter, and
Patty's, which corroborated all she said.
She then gave way to tears and lamentations;
saying, That cruel woman was born
to be the destruction of every-body she
had any connection with.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have found
it so; <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, madam (to me) have done so
too; Mr. Arnold, I believe, has been a
great sufferer; Mr. Faulkland is <hi rend="italic">now</hi> her
victim.  Inconsiderate and barbarous as
he is, I grieve for him.

<div3 type="entry" id="d153">

<p>I have heard nothing
of Mr. Arnold.  Indeed it is hardly possible
that I should: we are shut up here from
all commerce with the world.  My mother's
illness has confined her to her bed-chamber; we admit no visitors, and I
never leave her.  I long to know how he
takes the ingratitude of his mistress; but
I see nobody who converses with him.
My brother and Miss Burchell are the

<pb n="38"/>
only people we see.  The latter is pretty
often with us: as for Sir George, he only
looks in upon us now-and-then, and we
all seem in an aukward situation.  I wish
my mother were well enough to call on
Mr. Arnold: I am very anxious to know
what his sentiments are; at least in regard
to Mrs. Gerrarde.

<p>I have been almost
asleep, my dear Cecilia, for this week
past; but I have been rouzed this morning
in a most extraordinary manner.  Sir
George called on us; he ran up stairs in
a violent hurry; and had a countenance,
when he entered the room, that spoke
wonders before he opened his mouth.  He
hardly gave himself time to ask me how
I did (though he had not sen me for three
days) before he took a bundle of papers
out of his pocket, which he gave me.
'Tis from Faulkland, said he, and may
be worth your knowlege.  Upon opening
the cover, I found it contained, at least,
four sheets of paper, written on every side.
Bless me, brother, said I, do you expect

<pb n="39"/>
I should take the trouble to read all this?
He answered,you may read it at your
leisure: you will find it will pay you for
the mighty trouble of a perusal.  Sir
George left me presently; and having
read this extraordinary letter to myself,
for I happened to be in my own room
when my brother came to me, I sat me
down to give you a copy of it.  My mother,
who coughed almost the whole night,
is now endeavouring to get a little sleep;
so that I will scribble on as fast as I can,
while I have no interruption.

<lb/>
<lb/>
<opener>My dear Bidulph,</opener>
<lb/>
<p>I am in haste to vindicate myself to
you, but in much more haste to do so to
Mrs. Arnold, who, if she bestows a
thought at all on me, must, I am sure,
hold me in the utmost contempt; and
great reason would she have, if things
were always as they appear.  Methinks I
see her beautiful scorn at hearing I had
carried off Mrs. Gerrarde.  What a paltry
fellow <hi rend="italic">you</hi> must think me too.  And
yet I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> carried her off, and she is now

<pb n="40"/>
in my possession, not displeased with her
situation; and I might, if I would, be as
happy as Mrs. Gerrarde can make me:
but I assure you, Sir George, I have no
designs but what are for the good both of
her soul and body; and I have hitherto
treated her like a vestal.  What a paradox
is here? say you.  But have patience till I
tell you the story of my knight-errantry.
</p>
<p>You are to know then, that as Arnold's
amour with Mrs. Gerrarde was no secret
at V&mdash;hall, from the moment I heard it,
I meditated a design of breaking the detestable
union; not out of regard either
to him or her, but in hopes of restoring,
to the most amiable of women, a besotted
husband's heart, which nothing but downright
magic, infernal witchcraft, could
have robbed her of.  The woman is handsome,
'tis true; but she is a silly toad,
and as fantastic as an ape.  I had formed
this design, I say, from the first notice I
had of the intrigue; and, in consequence
of this, resolved to renew my acquaintance
with Mrs. Gerrarde: for I had <hi rend="italic">known</hi>
her before; known her to my cost.  She

<pb n="41"/>
it was, this identical devil, whom I have now
in my power, that was the cause of Miss
Burchell's misfortune; and therefore the
remote cause of my losing Miss Bidulph.
Had it not been for her, I should never
have had the fall of that unhappy girl to
answer for.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should not, I say (mark
that); for the mercenary witch was determined
to sell her to somebody, when my
ill stars threw me in her way.  I do not
rank this affair in the number of capital
crimes; and yet I never think of it without
a pang.  If half of my fortune would
retrieve the girl's peace of mind, I would
give it freely; but it is past now, and
cannot be helped.  She had the good fortune
never to be suspected; and, if she
keeps her own council, probably never
will.  If I die a bachelor (as I believe I
shall) I will leave her my whole fortune.
What can a man do more?
</p>
<p>How I ramble from my subject!  I
meant only to tell you what my design was
in carrying off Mrs. Gerrarde.  In order
to effect it, as I said before, it was necessary
for me to renew my acquaintance with

<pb n="42"/>
her; and accordingly I put on a bold
face, and made her a visit.  She was not surprized
at this, our former intimacy giving
me a sufficient pretence for it.  She
received me with a pleased familiarity,
which convinced me my company was far
from being disagreeable to her; and I am
sure, had my views been other than they
were, I should have met with as kind a
reception as my heart could have wished;
for she certainly thought of retaining me
in her service unknown to Arnold.  I was
soon aware of this; for, though she often
desired to see me, she always contrived it
at such times as she was sure of not being
surprized by him.  This was, in some
measure, meeting my purpose half way;
but though I wanted to disengage her
from Arnold, I did not mean to sacrifice
myself to her; and our views in the material
point, were very different: mine were
only to part her from her gallant; her's
were to share her favours between us: for
she did not intend to let go her hold on
him; and I believe my backwardness, in
pushing my good fortune, began to disgust

<pb n="43"/>
her; but the time for carrying my
plan into execution was not yet arrived;
it could not be till Arnold's departure
from South-park.  I meant to carry Mrs.
Gerrarde away with the appearance of her
own consent; and I knew this was impossible,
whilst her lover remained so near her.
I had formed but a rough sketch of my
plan when I received your letter, which
summoned me to Sidney Castle; and I
resolved not to apprize you of it, till my
enterprize was crowned with success; more
especially as you were then quite ignorant
of your sister's wrongs.
</p>
<p>On my return from visiting you, the
first news I heard at V&mdash;hall was, that
Mr. Arnold and his lady were parted.  I
curst my own dilatoriness, that I had not
executed my plan before things were
brought to such extremities; for I well
knew it was that artful fiend who had occasioned
it, though I then little thought
how fatally <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had contributed towards the
misfortune of the ever-amiable and most-respectable of women.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; told me, that your sister

<pb n="44"/>
having discovered her husband's infidelity,
had left him on that account; but my
lord soon let me into the whole secret.
Oh, Sir George, that angel, who deserved
the first monarch in the universe, to be
cast off by an undiscerning dolt! and <hi rend="italic">I</hi>,
though innocently, the accursed cause; I
cannot think with patience of what the
divine creature has suffered on my account;
but was it not all, from the beginning,
owing to Mrs. Gerrarde, that avenging
fury, sent on earth as a scourge for the
sins of me and of my ancestors?&mdash;I rave&mdash;
but no wonder&mdash;I am mad upon this subject.
&mdash;But to return: I then recollected,
that the day before I set out for Sidney
Castle, I received a message from Mrs.
Gerrarde in the morning, desiring my
company to drink coffee with her that
evening.  I obeyed the summons, little
expecting to meet Mrs. Arnold at her
house, whom I had never seen there before.
The effect my presence had on her extremely
surprized me: she presently quitted
the room.  Mrs. Gerrarde took that
opportunity of telling me, that she had

<pb n="45"/>
dropped in on her very unexpectedly; but,
as she supposed she would go directly
away, we should have an hour to chat by
ourselves.  She then followed your sister
out, and I remained alone in the parlour.
Whilst I was reflecting on this odd rencounter,
which I did not then imagine
had been brought about by design, Mrs.
Gerrarde came in to me, saying, your sister
was so ill, she was under a necessity of accompanying
her home, and had ordered
her chariot for that purpose: she made na
apology for being obliged to leave me, and
said she should be glad to see me the next
day.  I took my leave, and in going out saw
Mr. Arnold at the door, which I judged
was the true reason of Mrs. Gerrarde's
dismissing me.
</p>
<p>I set out for Wiltshire the next morning;
and though there was something
odd in the whole of this incident, I believed
it was owing to chance alone, and
thought no more of it, till, upon my
lord V&mdash;'s telling me the true cause of
your sister's disgrace, I found that this serpent
had laid the whole plan on purpose

<pb n="46"/>
to destroy her.  You see (for to be sure
you know all the particulars) how she seduced
the innocent Mrs. Arnold into this
fatal visit, having first engaged me to
come at the very point of time when she
knew the husband would surprize us; for
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> coming, you may be satisfied, was not
unexpected.
</p>
<p>I own to you, Sir George, in the first
motions of my rage, I could have stabbed
Arnold, Mrs. Gerrarde, and myself; but
my lord V&mdash; calmed my transports, by
telling me, that it was your sister's earnest
request that this detestable secret should be
kept from my knowlege; and that lady
V&mdash;, who had intrusted to him with it, would
never forgive him, if she knew he had divulged
it.  This reflection brought me
back to my senses, and I burned with impatience
to execute my first plan, which
Mrs. Gerrarde's repeated crimes now called
upon me to accelerate.  I communicated
my design to lord V&mdash;, who was delighted
with it; for he perfectly adores your sister.
This, said he, though not such a vengeance
as that wicked woman deserves, must

<pb n="47"/>
in the end be productive of what you wish,
and Mrs. Arnold may be restored to her
peace, without injury to her character, or
mischief to any-body.
</p>
<p>Having settled my measures with lord
V&mdash;, I went to pay a visit to Mrs. Gerrarde.
The cockatrice affected to speak
with surprize and concern of your sister's
separation from her husband.  I asked
her, had she, who was so intimate with
both, heard any reason assigned for it?
She shook her head, and by a pretended
sorrow in her looks, and a mysterious
silence, invited me to press for an explanation
of her meaning.  She told me at
length, with a seeming reluctance, that
'poor Mrs. Arnold, though to be sure
she was a sensible woman, was not without
the little frailties and passions of her
sex; and that, <hi rend="italic">astonishing</hi> and <hi rend="italic">groundless</hi>
as her suspicions were, she had taken it
into her head to be jealous of Mr. Arnold;
and with whom do you think, of
all people in the world she suspects him?'
I cannot imagine, said I.  Why truly with
<hi rend="italic">me</hi>, replied the undaunted Jezebel, and

<pb n="48"/>
looked as if she expected <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should be as
much amazed as she pretended to be.  I
affected to laugh at it; and changing the
discourse, put at end to my visit.
</p>
<p>The measures I had to observe required
some management.  It would not answer
the full extent of my purpose to rob Mr.
Arnold of his dear, if it did not appear
at the same time that she had left him
with her own consent.  To bring about
this, it was necessary that the flight on
her part should seem premeditated; which
would not carry any face, unless she took
with her such of her moveables as were
most valuable.  This I knew could not
be done without the assistance of her maid,
whom I therefore not only resolved to
trust, but also to make her a partner in
her mistress's elopement.
</p>
<p>Having settled thus much of my plan
in my own mind, I began my operations,
by making the maid presents every time
I visited the mistress; and I took care to
give those visits as much the air of an
amour as I possibly could.  I dare swear
the girl thought Mrs. Gerrarde and I were

<pb n="49"/>
upon the best terms imaginable.  I affected
to come at such hours as I was sure Mrs.
Gerrarde was alone; I always made my
visits short, as if through fear of being
surprized with her; and went so far as to
leave my chariot (when I came in it) at
a distance from the house, and walked to
it alone, with the caution of one fearful of
being observed.  It was a matter of indifference
to me whether Mrs. Gerrarde knew
of this or not; by business was only to
excite suspicions of an intrigue amongst
her servants, in order to answer a future
purpose: but if she were to know with
what extreme precaution I visited her, my
prudence could not but be very agreeable
to her: she had her measures to observe
as well as myself.  As it was of consequence
to her to conceal our acquaintance
from Arnold's knowlege, she must necessarily
be pleased at the pains I took (without
her laying herself open in  making the
request) to conceal it from him; and she
saw I was as careful as she could wish
never to interfere with him.
</p>
<p>In short, we carried on a private intercourse,

<pb n="50"/>
that, if it could not be called gallantry,
was something very like it; for I
amused, complimented, and flattered her
so agreeably, that I believe she began to
think herself sure of me, and wondered I
did not make a better use of the favourable
disposition she was in towards me; but
I trifled with such dexterity, that even she,
with all the cunning she is mistress of, could
not possibly fathom my design.
</p>
<p>Having thus laid the foundation of my
plot, I made no doubt of being able to
execute it, with my lord V&mdash;'s assistance:
he was in raptures at the thoughts of our
enterprize, and swore he would never have
forgiven me, if I had not allowed him a
share in it.  He said, I would give my
right-hand to make Mrs. Arnold happy;
adding, besides it will save her husband
from destruction; for to my knowlege,
that woman has already almost ruined his
fortune.
</p>
<p>I asked him, might we venture to let
my lady into the secret?  He said, by no
means: my lady was too squeamish to be
trusted with such a notable exploit; but,

<pb n="51"/>
when the affair was over, he would take
upon him to excuse me to her, after he
had diverted himself a little with her
surprize.
</p>
<p>I fretted to death at Arnold's staying so
long in the country, as it delayed my enterprize.
There was one circumstance
indeed that a little compensated for this
vexation; and that was, that my long stay
at V&mdash;hall, which could be no secret to
him, though he dropped visiting there on
purpose to avoid me, might in some measure
help to efface his injurious suspicions
with regard to his lady and me; besides,
it gave the better colour to my other designs.
</p>
<p>At last the long-sought-for opportunity
arrived.  Arnold was obliged to go to
London on his law-affairs.  I took care to
inform myself of the day from Mrs. Gerrarde's
maid; and learnt at the same time
that her mistress purposed going to town
in a week after; for she still endeavoured
to save appearances, and dared to the last
to pretend to reputation.  I proposed giving
a ball, to take my leave of the ladies,

<pb n="52"/>
on the night subsequent to the day fixed
for Arnold's departure from South-park.
My lord, almost as anxious for the event
as myself, immediately dispatched invitations
all over the neighbourhood: there
was not a person of any fashion left unasked.
Mr. Arnold and Mrs. Gerrarde,
you may be sure, were not forgot.  From
the former, as we expected, we received a
civil apology; from the latter, a message
that she would be sure to come.
</p>
<p>This was at the distance of eight days
from the appointed time.  In the interim,
I continued to visit Mrs. Gerrarde as
usual, and took care to bespeak her for
a partner.  Arnold went to town as opportunely
as we could wish.  I called on Mrs.
Gerrarde the same morning; and having
my lord's permission for it, engaged her
to come early enough to drink tea, as
there were a good many more ladies invited
for the same purpose; and, at going
away, I dropped a few mysterious hints to
her maid.
</p>
<p>In the evening there was a very large
company met at V&mdash;hall; and having

<pb n="53"/>
concerted my whole plan, when the ladies
were engaged at the tea-table, I slipped
out, mounted my horse, and rode to Mrs.
Gerrarde's house.  I desired to see her
maid; and, taking her aside, told her not
to be surprized; but that her lady was to
go off with me that night: that the thing
had, for certain reasons, not been determined
on till that very evening: that I
had just snatched a minute to desire her to
get all her lady's trinkets together, and
whatever money and bills she might have
in her escrutoir.  In order to this, I gave
her a parcel of small keys, which I had
carried in my pocket for the purpose; and
bid her hold herself in readiness against
seven o'clock, when a person should call
on her, who would conduct her to a place
where she should find her lady and me.
</p>
<p>I needed no arguments to persuade the
girl; the thing appeared plausible enough:
She was fully convinced of the intimacy
between her mistress and me; and knowing
her too well to have a doubt of her
baseness, she concluded I acted by Mrs.
Gerrarde's directions, and promised punctually

<pb n="54"/>
to obey them.  She said she could
easily convey away in the dark as many
things as she could conveniently carry,
and, to avoid observation from the rest of
the servants, she would wait at a cottage
hard by, which she named to me, till her
conductor arrived.
</p>
<p>Whether any of the keys I gave her
would fit the locks or not, I was not much
concerned; if they did not, I concluded
she would think her mistress had made a
mistake, and that she would force them
open rather than fail.  Having settled this
material point, I got back to my lord
V&mdash;'s, without having been missed by the
company.
</p>
<p>Our ball was very well conducted; I
danced with Mrs. Gerrarde, and we passed
a very agreeable evening.  We supped at
twelve, and she had ordered her chariot
to come a little after that hour; but I had
given my fellows their cue.  As the dancing
was not renewed, the company broke up
between one and two.  Mrs. Gerrarde was
one of the first that offered to go; but as
her servants were not to be found, she

<pb n="55"/>
was detained till every-body else had taken
their leave.  At length her coachman and
footman were found in the cellar, with
one of my men, all so drunk that they
were not able to stand.  Her servants were
really so, and mine counterfeited so well,
there was no discovering the cheat.  In
this emergency nothing was more natural
than the offering my servants to attend
her home, and of course to wait on her
myself to see her safe.  She readily accepted
the first offer, but declined the other.
This was easily got over; I handed her
into her chariot, and stepped in after her.
Our route was settled: we drove from my
lord V&mdash;'s door; and turning short
from the road that led to Mrs. Gerrarde's
house, we struck down a lane which was
to carry us by dross roads to our first destined
stage, which was at the distance of
seven miles.  This was no other than a
poor gardener's house, to which place two
of my emissaries had been dispatched that
day to wait our coming, with a travelling
chariot and four stout horses.  I had
taken care, according to promise, to send

<pb n="56"/>
a trusty groom for the maid, with a boy
to carry her luggage.  They were both
well mounted, and had orders to carry
her to an inn on the road to Rochester,
and within about a mile of the town.
This inn was kept by a fellow who had formerly
been my servant; I had placed
him there, and he was intirely at my devotion.
He had already received his instructions,
and his house was to be our
second stage.  I concluded the maid had
arrived there long before us, having had
six or sever hours the start of us, and the
place was not more than twenty miles from
her own house.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde was not immediately
aware of our gong out of the road; she
was in high spirits, and I kept her in chat.
As soon as she perceived it, she cried out,
with some surprize, Lord, Mr. Faulkland!
where is the fellow carrying us?  He
has missed his way.  She called to him;
but the coachman, who had orders not to
stop unless I spoke to him, only drove the
faster.  Pray do call to him, said she; the
wretch has certainly got drunk with

<pb n="57"/>
the rest of the servants.  I told her there
was no possibility of turning in the narrow
road in which we then were: that
when we got out of it, I would speak to
the coachman; and begged of her, in the
mean while, not to be frightened.  The
lane was a very long one, but our rapid
wheels soon carried us to the end of it,
where I had appointed Pivet and one of
my footmen to meet us on horseback.  I
had another servant behind the chariot,
whom I purposed to send back with it in
the morning.
</p>
<p>At the sight of two horsemen, who
were apparently waiting for us, she screamed
out, Oh, the villain! he has brought
us here to be robbed.  She had a good
many jewels on her; and, to say the truth,
had some reason for her fears.  The chariot
had now got on a good open road,
and the horses rather flew than galloped.
The two horsemen joined us, and kept
up with us at full speed.  I saw she was
heartily frightened, and thought it time
to undeceive her.  I was not ill-natured
enough to keep her longer under the apprehensions

<pb n="58"/>
of highwaymen, and thought
she would be less shocked at finding there
was a design upon her person, than on
her diamond ear-rings.  Now, said I, taking
one of her hands, with rather more
freedom than respect, since we are out of
all danger of discovery, or any possibility
of pursuit, I will tell you a secret; and I
spoke with an easy assured tone.  She drew
her hand away.  What do you mean, Sir?
Nothing, madam, but to have the pleasure
of your company in a little trip I am
going to take: believe me, you are not in
the least danger; you are under my protection;
those are my servants that you
see riding with us; and you may judge of
the value I set upon you, by the pains I
have taken to get you into my possession.
Lord, Mr. Faulkland! why sure you can't
be serious!  Never more so in my life,
madam; I have long had a design upon
you; but your connection with Mr. Arnold
&mdash;<hi rend="italic">My</hi> connection with Mr. Arnold,
Sir! interrupting me; I don't understand
you!&mdash;Come, come, Mrs. Gerrarde; you
and I are old acquaintance, you know;

<pb n="59"/>
'tis no time for dissembling.  He has been
a happy man long enough: 'tis time for
a woman of your spirit to be tired of him;
especially as I think I may say, without
vanity, you do not change for the worse
in falling into my hands.  The lady had
now recovered her courage; she was no
longer in fears of being robbed, and her
spirits returned.  You audacious creature!
how dare you treat me thus?  Have you
the assurance to insinuate that there was
any thing criminal in my attachment to
Mr. Arnold and his family?  My dear madam,
I accuse you of no attachment to any
of his family; he himself was the only favoured
person&mdash;Sure there never was such
an impertinent wretch!&mdash;But I know
the author of this scandal: it was Mrs.
&mdash; (and she dared to prophane your
sister's honored name); but I despise her;
and Mr. Arnold shall soon know how I
have been affronted; and she fell a crying.
&mdash;My dear Mrs. Gerrarde, I beg your
pardon; I did not mean to offend you:
if Mr. Arnold admired you, he did no
more than what every man does who sees

<pb n="60"/>
you.  I beseech you to compose yourself;
by all that is good, I mean you no harm:
be calm, I conjure you, and don't spoil the
prettiest face in England with crying.  A
daring, provoking creature, she sobbed;
what could put such an attempt as this in
your head? and to what place are you
carrying me?  Only to France, my dear
creature: have you ever been there?  To
France! to France! she exclaimed; and
do you dare to think you shall carry me
there?  Oh, you'll like it of all things,
said I, when you get there&mdash;What do you
think her reply was?  Why, neither more
nor less than a good box on the ear.  I
catched hold of her hand, and kissed it:
you charming vixen how I admire you
for your spirit!  She endeavoured to wrest
her hand from me; but I held them both
fast, for fear of another blow.  Base, insolent,
ravisher, villain!  As she rose in her
epithets, I replied with, lovely, charming,
adorable, tender, gentle creature&mdash;
She cried again; but they were spiteful
tears, and did not create in me the least
touch of that pity, which, on any

<pb n="61"/>
other occasion, they might have moved
me to.
</p>
<p>I was glad our altercations had a short
truce, by the chariot's stopping at the
gardener's cottage, where I had ordered
my equipage to wait.  All the family were
in bed but the man's wife, who came
curt'sying to the door.  I led, or rather
lifted, Mrs. Gerrarde out of the chariot;
for she would not give me her hand; and
begging she would repose herself for a few
minutes, whilst I gave orders to my servants,
put her into the good woman's
hands.  She went sullenly in, without
making me any answer: and seeing no-body but the old woman, she was convinced
that complaints, or an attempt to
escape, would be equally fruitless, and so
prudently acquiesced.  I soon dispatched
my orders: I made the footman, who
came behind the chariot, mount the box,
and directed him to drive to an inn in the
next village to Mrs. Gerrarde's house, and
from thence to send it home by some one
who did not know to whom he belonged.
I then ordered my own equipage to the

<pb n="62"/>
door; and entering the cottage, told the
lady I was ready to attend her.  The old
woman presently vanished; so that seeing
nobody to apply to, she suffered me very
quietly to put her into my chariot, and I
placed myself by her.  It was made on
purpose for travelling, and I took care to
have nothing but wooden windows; to
which I had the precaution to add a couple
of spring-locks, which shut on drawing
up, and were not without difficulty to be
opened.  One of the windows was already
up, and I flurted up the other as soon as I
got into the coach.  It was a fine moon-light morning, the postillion cracked his
whip, and though the roads were deep and
dirty, the four horses darted away like
lightning.
</p>
<p>I believe, madam, said I, you are by
this time convinced that my scheme is too
well laid to be baffled by any efforts you
can make.  I mean to treat you with due
respect, and beg you will use me with a
little more gentleness than you have done;
that is all the favour I shall ask in return,
till you yourself are disposed to shew more.

<pb n="63"/>
</p>
<p>You are the most amazing creature,
said she, that ever breathed!  What is the
meaning that, in the whole course of our
acquaintance, your behaviour never gave
me room to believe that you were serious in
your designs on me, and now at once
you souse upon your prey like a hawk?  I'll
answer you in two words, said I.  When
we first met, you had a husband; since
the renewal of our acquaintance (you'll
pardon me) it was no secret that you had
a favoured lover in Mr. Arnold:  I am
not of a temper to solicit a lady by stealth,
and I would not give a pinch of snuff for
the woman who is not entirely at my disposal.
Your attachments to Arnold forbad
this, and I was determined to have
you all to myself.  My attachments to
Mr. Arnold! cried she, impudently, again.
Ay, said I, coolly, it began to be talked
of so openly, that your reputation was
mangled at every tea-table in the country;
and had you staid much longer there, you
would have found yourself deserted by
every female of character that knew you.
Mr. Arnold's parting with his wife, was

<pb n="64"/>
by every-body charged to your account;
and as she is reckoned a very <hi rend="italic">good sort</hi> of a
woman (was not that a pretty phrase?)
every one took her part, and were not
sparing in their invectives against you.
Add to all this, that Arnold has certainly
run out his fortune, and is so involved
that it will not be possible for him long to
make those returns of generosity which
your merit deserves.&mdash;You and I have
been acquainted long; I am no stranger
to your circumstances; I know, at Captain
Gerrarde's death, your pension as his
widow, and the very small jointure at
Ashby, was the whole of your income.
Arnold's love, it is apparent, has hitherto
been bountiful; how long it could be in
his power to continue it so, may be a question
worth your considering.
</p>
<p>I found I had mortified her pride, by
mentioning the narrowness of her circumstances,
and the demolition of her character.
If all you say <hi rend="italic">were</hi> true, Sir,
which is far from being the case (with a
toss of her head) you will find it no very
easy matter to make me amends for what

<pb n="65"/>
I shall perhaps lose for ever by this violence
of yours, notwithstanding the <hi rend="italic">smallness</hi> of
my income, which you seem so well informed
of.  I have a considerable sum of
money, and some valuable jewels, lying
by me, of which my servants may very
probably rob me.  I assured her, upon
my honour, I would make good to her
every thing she should lose through my
means, and would take care her situation
should never again be upon the same precarious
footing which it had been.  I did
not choose to mention the circumstance of
my having secured her maid and her money
too; I reserved that for an agreeable
surprize.  I had measures to observe I
did not want to be on good terms with
her too soon for obvious reasons, as nothing
was farther from my heart than a
thought of gallantry.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, I assumed a more
distant behaviour, and affected to shew
her something like respect.  I did not
drop the least hint of my knowing that
Mr. Arnold had made his lady uneasy on
my account, much less that I suspected

<pb n="66"/>
her for the wicked contriver of that mischief.
I deferred the discussing of this
point till a more favourable opportunity
should offer, when it would be in my
power to make a better use of it.
</p>
<p>My design was by degrees to make her
satisfied enough with her situation, not to
wish to return to Arnold.  When I had
once brought her to this, I judged it
would not be difficult to carry her still
farther, to the point I aimed at; and that
was, to write a letter to him of my dictating.
You will think this was a strange
expectation, and yet it was what I resolved
to accomplish.  I knew the turn of the
mind I had to deal with: bring a woman
of this sort into good humour, and it is
easy to wheedle her into compliance.  She
has no solid understanding; but possesses,
in the place of it a sort of flashy wit, that
imposes on common hearers, and makes
her pass for what is called clever.  With a
great deal of vanity, and an affectation
of tenderness, which covers the most termagant
spirit that ever animated a female
breast, her ruling and governing passion

<pb n="67"/>
is avarice; and yet, strange to tell! generosity
is of all things what she professes to
admire, and is most studious of having
thought her characteristic.  Her pretensions
to this virtue I have opposed to her
vice of avarice, as the terms appropriated
to each seem most contrary in their natures;
yet I do not mean by generosity
that bounteous disposition which is commonly
understood by the word: no, no;
she aimed at the reputation of this virtue
in our most exalted idea of it, and wold
fain to be thought a woman of a <hi rend="italic">great soul</hi>.
This phrase was often in her mouth; and
though her whole conduct gave the lie to
her professions, she would tell you fifty
stories, without a word of truth in any of
them, to prove how nobly she had acted
on such and such occasions.  On the knowlege
of this part of her temper, I chiefly
built my hopes of success.
</p>
<p>I kept up a sort of forced conversation
during the rest of our journey.  She was
sullen, but not rude.  As I was far from
desiring to come to an eclaircissement
with her, I did not wish to have her in
better temper.

<pb n="68"/>
</p>
<p>We reached the inn, which was about
a mile on our side Rochester, at eight
o'clock in the morning.  This was a favourable
hour, as by that time every traveller
must have left the stages they lay
at.  The house stood alone, and luckily
enough, had no company in it.  My old
servant, Lamb, had received my instructions
by letter, and was prepared accordingly for
our reception.  This was the place to
which I had ordered the maid to be carried;
she had arrived there some time before
us, and was safely lodged.
</p>
<p>The chariot drove into the court-yard,
close to the door of the inn; the step was
let down in an instant, and Mrs. Lamb
appeared to receive us.  We both darted
into the house.  Dressed as we were for a ball,
we made an odd appearance as travellers at
that hour of the morning.  I believe this
consideration made Mrs. Gerrarde very
readily hurry up stairs with the woman of
the house.
</p>
<p>I inquired for Mrs. Gerrarde's maid,
having given orders to Lamb that she should
not be seen till I first spoke to her.  I

<pb n="69"/>
was carried into the room where she
was: she seemed very glad that we were
arrived.  I desired her to lay out her lady's
toilet, which I concluded she had
brought with her; for that Mrs. Gerrarde
would presently put herself in a proper
habit for travelling.  The maid told me
she had brought her mistress's riding-dress
with her, and as many other things of her
wearing apparel as she could conveniently
carry.  I saw a vast heap of things lying
unpacked on a bed which was in the room,
and asked her how she had managed so
cleverly as to get such a number of things
together without observation.  She told
me she had lost no time, from the minute
I left her till the arrival of her guide,
but had employed the interval in carrying
out some of the best of her lady's cloaths
piece by piece, and conveying them to
the cottage, which she could easily do
without the servants seeing her; for, as it
was dark, she passed in and out without
observation.  Here she huddled them into
a large portmanteau.  After this she went
to examine her lady's escrutoir; but was

<pb n="70"/>
a long time puzzled in endeavouring to
open it, as none of the keys I had given
her answered.  She endeavoured to force
it open with as little noise as possible, but
in vain.  She then had recourse to a second
trial of the keys, when one of them,
which probably had been passed by before,
luckily opened the lock; and she secured
all the money and jewels she could find.
These, said she, kept me in continual
dread all the way as I travelled; for I
have eight hundred pounds in bank notes;
and though my lady has such a quantity
of jewels on her, I am sure I have as many
more about me, which I have hid in different
parts of my cloaths.
</p>
<p>I commended the girl's diligence, as
indeed it deserved; and having before
ordered tea and coffee into Mrs. Gerrarde's
room, I now went in to breakfast with
her.  I found the woman of the house
still with her, at which I was not at all
uneasy; for as she had been tutored by
her husband, I knew she was not to be
wrought upon, if Mrs. Gerrarde had attempted
it.

<pb n="71"/>
</p>
<p>As I did not at that time desire a <hi rend="italic">t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</hi> with her, I contrived to keep Mrs.
Lamb in the room, by desiring her to
drink tea with us.
</p>
<p>When we had done breakfast, I told
Mrs. Gerrarde, that as I feared she was a
good deal fatigued, if it was agreeable to
her, we would remain where we were for
that day; and that I would by all means
have her think of taking some rest.  She
said she was extremely tired, and should
like to get a little sleep.  I think, madam,
you had better go to bed, said Mrs. Lamb;
I have a very quiet chamber ready,
where no noise in the house can disturb
you.  Shew me to it, answered Mrs.
Gerrarde, with a tone of weariness and
ill-humour.  The woman obeyed; I followed:
she carried her to the door of the
room where the maid was, and throwing
it open, Mrs. Gerrarde, who supposed she
was attending her, went in:  I stepped in
after her; Mrs. Lamb withdrew.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde's astonishment at the
sight of her maid, is past description.  Rachael!

<pb n="72"/>
in a tone of admiration.  Rachael,
who did not think there was any
thing unexpected or extraordinary in their
meeting, quite at a loss to guess at what
her mistress wondered, answered her in
her turn with some surprize, Madam!
and waited, expecting she would give her
some orders; which finding the lady did
not, the maid asked her, very composedly,
Would she please to undress?  I hope,
madam, said I, stepping forward, that Mrs.
Rachael has taken care to bring you
every thing you may have occasion for; I
shall leave you in her hands, and wish you
a good repose.  Strange, astonishing creature!
said Mrs. Gerrarde, looking at me
with less anger than surprise.  I bowed, and
left the room.
</p>
<p>I ordered Mrs. Lamb to have an eye to
my prisoners; and heartily tired as I was,
between dancing and travelling, I undressed,
and threw myself into bed.  I
slept till six o'clock in the evening; then
rose, and put myself into a habit fitter for
my journey than that in which I came;
and which I had sent in a post-trunk before
me, by the messenger whom I had

<pb n="73"/>
employed to apprize Lamb of my coming.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde was not yet stirring.  I
called for Rachael, and asked her how she
had come off with her lady, upon telling
her the manner of her falling into my
snare.  Rachael told me her lady wondered
mightily at my art, and said I was
the <hi rend="italic">strangest gentleman</hi> that ever was born.
My friend Rachael softened the expression
I fancy; I am sure Mrs. Gerrarde did not
call me a strange <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi>.  She said her
mistress smiled two or three times at her
relation, particularly at my giving her
the keys.  I found, upon the whole, that
my conduct in securing to her her money
and her jewels, together with the attendance
of her maid, had a good deal appeased
resentment.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde did not rise till near
eight o'clock.  I had ordered as elegant a
dinner as the house could afford; and the
lady having put herself into a genteel
dishabile, with great alacrity sat down to
table, and did not appear to have fretted
away her appetite.  I would suffer no one

<pb n="74"/>
to attend but Rachael.  I told Mrs. Gerrarde
that I purposed setting out for Dover
that night, and that as it could not be
supposed her maid should be able to ride
so far, and that a second carriage with four
horses (as less might not be able to keep
pace with us) would be liable to observation,
I would, if she pleased, resign my
place in the chariot to Mrs. Rachael, and
attend her myself on horseback.  She answered
me coldly, Since she <hi rend="italic">must</hi> go, it
was indifferent to her who was to be her
companion.  Though the motive I offered
for this manner of travelling was not without
its weight, yet my true reason was to
avoid being boxed up so long again with
Mrs. Gerrarde.  My time was not yet come
for explanations, and I was afraid of being
upon good terms with her too soon.
</p>
<p>The remainder of the evening was spent
by her and her maid in carefully packing
up the baggage, which had been brought
in a confused huddle to the inn.  Mrs.
Gerrarde had a convenient trunk bought
at Rochester for the purpose, and assisted
herself in laying them up safely.

<pb n="75"/>
</p>
<p>She equipped herself in a smart riding-dress, and at eleven o'clock, without any
great reluctance, permitted me to put her
and her maid into the chariot.  The
inn had no company in it, at least that
we saw; and our host was too discreet to
let any of his servants be in the way.  I
mounted my horse, and triumphantly
galloped off with my prize.
</p>
<p>We reached Dover early next morning,
and immediately got on board the packet.
The lady by this time appeared so perfectly
serene, that I believe in my soul I should not
have got rid of her, if I had desired her
to have gone back again; but she had assumed
a new air, and affected a fine tender
melancholy in her countenance.  I guessed
at her thoughts, and found afterwards my
conjecture right.  Will you believe me,
Sir George, when I tell you the baggage
had formed serious <hi rend="italic">honourable</hi> designs upon
my person?  Fact, upon my word.  I saw it
presently (you know my knack of reading
peoples minds in their faces) and was not
sorry for the discovery; for though I determined
not on any account to encourage

<pb n="76"/>
such a wild expectation, yet I intended to
make a <hi rend="italic">discrete</hi> use of it; besides, I knew
it would afford me a handle for keeping a
<hi rend="italic">respectable</hi> distance.
</p>
<p>We landed next evening.  She had
been very sick at sea, and continued so
much out of order, that she was put to
bed as soon as we got to the inn.  She
ordered her maid not to stir from her;
the very thing I wished; so that I had
nothing to do but to be very troublesome
in my inquiries after her health, and very
sorry for her indisposition.
</p>
<p>The next morning however, set all to
rights; and after congratulating her on
her recovery, and the revival of her beauty,
I told her I meant to carry her to Boulogne,
whither I had sent Pivet the night
before, to take lodgings for us in a private
house which he knew.  I found that neither
Mrs. Gerrarde nor her maid spoke French;
a circumstance I was very glad of, though
the former bitterly lamented her having
<hi rend="italic">forgot</hi> it.  She made not the least objection
to the travelling from Calais to Boulogne,
as she had done before; her late indisposition

<pb n="77"/>
gave me a pretence for insisting on
Rachael's attending her in the chariot.
</p>
<p>The lodgings Pivet had taken were very
handsome; our apartments were on the
same floor, separated only by a lobby.
Mrs. Rachael had a little bed fitted up
for her by my directions in her lady's
dressing-room.  Thus far I had sailed before
the wind; but now came the difficult
part of my task.  It was impossible for
Mrs. Gerrarde to conceive that any thing,
but down-right love for her person, could
have induced me to do what I had done.
</p>
<p>I had actually ran away with her, put
myself to some hazard, and, what in her
estimation was no small matter, some expence
too.  No other motive had appeared
in all my conduct towards her; and tho'
I had not absolutely made love to her,
yet what other construction could my actions
bear? for my words, to say the truth,
were equivocal.  She must necessarily have
concluded that I had no other view but a
piece of gallantry with her.  Her designs
on me were of a much more serious nature;
and her vanity made her imagine,

<pb n="78"/>
that, notwithstanding my thorough knowledge
of her character, her cunning,
joined to my passion, might lead me into
her snare.
</p>
<p>Now, I had two nice points to consider
of, and two difficulties to surmount.  The
first was, not by any part of my conduct
to carry the deception so far as to give
her the least room to hope I could be mad
enough to marry her.  This, bad as <hi rend="italic">she</hi>
is, and extravagant as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am, I could not
think of doing, even to gain my favourite
point.  The other was, to keep up such
an appearance of gallantry towards her, as
she must naturally expect, and at the same
time avoid all approaches which usually
forerun the catastrophe of an amour; than
which nothing was more repugnant to my
wishes.
</p>
<p>To steer between those two extremes was
the difficult task, particularly the latter;
for, between ourselves, I began to be
much more afraid of her than she was of
me.  I knew it would be impossible for
me to keep up the farce long; the
sooner it was over the better; and therefore

<pb n="79"/>
I determined to enter on my part directly.
</p>
<p>I had been ruminating on my project all
the way as I rode.  When we arrived at
Boulogne, I found myself a little out of
order, having caught cold; and as I was
really somewhat feverish, a thought started
into my head, that this illness might aid
me in my design.  When we came to our
lodgings, I made my excuses to Mrs.
Gerrarde for not being able to attend her:
I told her I found myself ill, and must be
obliged to go to bed.  She said she was
<hi rend="italic">very sorry</hi>, and perhaps she spoke truth.
</p>
<p>I left her in possession of her new apartment
with her maid Rachael.  Their being
strangers to the language of the country,
cut off all communication with the
people of the house, who could not speak
English.  I introduced Pivet to them,
whom they had never seen before (for he
had taken particular care to keep out of
their view during the whole journey) as a
gentleman who was to be their interpreter;
and having thus settled my houshold,
I retired to my bedchamber.

<pb n="80"/>
</p>
<p>Not well, nor sick enough to go to bed,
I threw myself however down on it;
and after revolving in my mind all the
occurrences of the three or four past days,
I started up again, sat down to the desk,
and have given you, my Bidulph, a faithful
narrative of my proceedings down to
the present period of time, being November
25, eight o'clock in the evening.
</p>
<p>You may soon expect to have the second
part of this my delectable history;
'Shewing how Orlando, not being able to
prevail, with all his eloquence, on the as
fair and beautiful, as fierce and inexorable
Princess Gerrardina, to put the finishing
hand to his adventures and most wonderful
exploits, did, his wrath being moved
thereby, like an ungentle knight,
bury his sword in her snow-white, but
savage and unrelenting breast; whereat,
being stung with remorse, he afterwards
kills himself.'
</p>
<p>Would not this be a pretty conclusion
of my adventures?  No, no, Sir George,
expect better things from thy friend.  I
hope my knight-errantry will not end so

<pb n="81"/>
tragically.  But hasten to make my peace
with that gracious creature your sister; yet
why do I name her and myself in the same
sentence?  She cares not for me, thinks
not of me, or, if she does, it is with contempt.
I said this before, and I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> repeat
it again; but tell her, what I have
done was with a view to promote her happiness.
Oh! may <hi rend="italic">she</hi> be happy whatever
becomes of me.  I know the means I have
used will make her angry; but try to make
her forgive the means for the motive's
sake.  Tell her as much of this wild story
as you think proper; but do not let her
see it in my wild rambling language; that
is only fit for your own eye.
</p>
<p>Your mother, I know, is out of all
patience with me.  I am black enough in
her opinion already.  This last action, as
far as she has yet known of it, will dye
me ten shades deeper; but pray put in a
word for me there too.  I know she will
say, that, 'we are not to return evil for
evil; and that it is not lawful to do evil,
though to bring forth good.'  But put
her in mind that there are such things as

<pb n="82"/>
<hi rend="italic">pious frauds</hi> (though, by-the-bye, I do not
take this of mine to be one of them);
'that wicked people are to have their arts
opposed by arts; and that good people
have not only been permitted, but commanded
to execute vengeance on sinners'.
And you may hint at the children of
Israel's being ordered to spoil the &AElig;gyptians,
though far be it from me to spoil
Mrs. Gerrarde of any thing she has.  This
however, and as many wise sayings as you
can collect for the purpose, you may string
together; and be sure you tell her I have
hopes of reclaiming Mrs. Gerrarde from
her <hi rend="italic">evil</hi> courses, and do not despair of prevailing
on her to go into a nunnery; for
Mrs. Gerrarde, you must know, was bred
a Roman catholic, though she conformed
on marrying Capt. Gerrarde.

to give you a good account of my undertaking.
Mean while, if I am not quite

<p>Was there ever such a
piece of knight-errantry?  What a madcap
is this!  Pray, my dear, are you not
astonished at him?  I am sure I am.  I
had not an opportunity to finish the copying
of this very long letter, which I began
yesterday morning, till very late this
night.  My poor mother has been so restless,
and so much out of order these two
days, I desired her leave to read to her
Mr. Faulkland's history, (for I can call it
by no other name), as I sat by her bedside.
She told me, I might let her know
the substance of what he said, as it would
fatigue her too much to attend to so long
an epistle.
</p>
<p>You would have smiled, my Cecilia,
at my good parent's amazement, when I

<pb n="84"/>
told her Mr. Faulkland's proceedings, and
his reasons for them.  She would scarce
give credit to it at first, and I was obliged
to repeat several circumstances to her
over again.  And so, said she, this was
all on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> account, and he had <hi rend="italic">really</hi> no
ill design on Mrs. Gerrarde.  I am
glad of this for Miss Burchell's sake, and
shall be impatient to tell her of it.  I
begged of my mother to wait a while for
the result of Mr. Faulkland's adventure,
before she mentioned any thing of the
matter to Miss Burchell.  We do not yet
know, said I, how this matter may turn
out; Mr. Faulkland, to be sure, will make
haste to communicate to my brother
the issue of this odd affair, and it will then
be time enough to inform the young
lady.
</p>
<p>My mother unwillingly consented to
postpone a discovery which she knew
would be so agreeable to Miss Burchell.
I applaud her humanity; but think that,
good and prudent as she is, she is too
unreserved in her confidences.  This strange
business, is, I think at present in too critical

<pb n="85"/>
a suspence to trust the knowledge of
it to any-body.  If Mr. Faulkland fails in
his design, his avowal of it will be far
from serving me.  Sir George was with
us for a few minutes to-day, only to exult in
Mr. Faulkland's recovered credit.  Has
he not well explained himself? said
he.  Oh, I knew there must have been
some mystery at the bottom of that conduct
which surprized us all so much.
<hi rend="italic">There's</hi> a man for you!  Shew me another
who would carry his noble disinterested
love to such lengths!
</p>
<p>My mother did not like that he should
run on in that strain, and therefore stopped
him.  The end crowns all, Sir George:
let us see how your friend will conduct
himself <hi rend="italic">through</hi> this ticklish affair.  Let
him get through it how he will, answered
my brother a little bluntly, I think Sidney
has obligations to him she ought never to
forget.

<p>More intelligence, my
dear; stranger and stranger still!  I am
sorry I sent off my last packet, as I am

<pb n="86"/>
sure you must be impatient for the conclusion
of Mr. Faulkland's adventure;
and then what sorry stuff has the interval
been filled up with! but I will now make
you amends.  My mother is better too,
thank God! and every thing promises
well.

<p>Sir George has had a second packet

<p>How rude is the hand of sickness, my
Bidulph! it had like to have spoiled
one of the best projects that ever was undertaken,
and consigned to oblivion an
action worthy of immortality.  I have
been very ill since I last wrote to you;
the disorder, which I then complained of,
turned out to be an ugly fever; and I
was for three days in extreme danger.
Mrs. Gerrarde was, during that time,
closely attended by Pivet, whose services
I dispensed with on that account.  He
told me she appeared uneasy at my situation,
and inquired constantly, and <hi rend="italic">kindly</hi>
too, after my health.  When I grew well
enough to sit up, I begged the favour of

<pb n="87"/>
seeing her in my chamber.  She came very
readily, and seemed downright anxious
for my recovery.  I told her I hoped she
had been treated with proper care and respect
during my sickness.  She said Mr.
Pivet was a very obliging, good-natured
man, and had endeavoured to make her
confinement as easy to her as possible.
</p>
<p>The plan she had formed of turning to
the most lasting advantage the inclination
she supposed I had for her, inclined her to
assume a very different behaviour from
what was natural to her.  The weakness of
my condition, while it afforded me a
pretence for a more cold and languid behaviour
than I could with any colour have
put on at another time, gave her an opportunity
of playing off her arts, and facilitated
my design beyond my hopes.
</p>
<p>She was seated by my bedside: our first
conversation consisted of nothing but complaints
on my side, and condolements on
her's.  I sighed several times, and she
sighed in return.  Mrs. Gerrarde, said I,
you are afflicted; but my illness has no
share in your concern.  Something else

<pb n="88"/>
oppresses you; you regret the being separated
from Mr. Arnold, and I am always
the object of your hatred.  Neither one
nor t'other, answered she, in a kind voice.
'Tis impossible to hate you; you know it
is not in nature for a <hi rend="italic">woman</hi> to hate such a
man as Mr. Faulkland.  As for Mr. Arnold,
though I <hi rend="italic">own</hi> my former weakness
in regard to him, yet I hope I have something
to plead in my excuse.  I was married
very early to an old man, and had
never experienced the happiness of reciprocal
love: he died, and left me destitute.
Mr. Arnold's generous, though
I must confess unwarrantable passion, rescued
me from distress.  I did not know
he was married when I first unwarily accepted
of his addresses, and it was too
late to retreat before I found it out;
otherwise the universe should not have
tempted me to have listened to him.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the affluence I obtained
from him, it often grieved me to think
of the injury I did his wife.  There is
nothing, Mr. Faulkland, so grating to a
generous mind, and I think I may venture

<pb n="89"/>
to assert that <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> is one, as to live in
a state of dependence, and at the same time
owe that very dependence to a vice that you
disdain.
</p>
<p>I was delighted to find that she had got
into this strain; it was the thing I wished,
but durst hardly hope for without abundance
of trouble on my part, and a dissimulation
that was irksome to me.  I knew
she had studied this speech, and got it by
rote to answer her own purpose; but in
this, as is generally the case of designing
people, she overshot herself, and became
the dupe to her own artifice.  I laid hold
of the cue she gave: Oh, madam, you
charm me! go on, go on; now indeed you
shew a generous mind: happy would
it be for all your sex, after having deviated
from the paths of virtue, if they
could return to them with so good a grace,
so just a sense of their errors!  To <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,
Sir, said she, with a solemn air, I am indebted
for my present resolutions: I hope
from this time forward that my life will be
irreproachable.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> hope so too, madam.
I guessed she understood these words as

<pb n="90"/>
favouring her design: it was not meet to
undeceive her (a little mental reservation,
you know, Bidulph): she went on, little
thinking she was forwarding my plan,
when she only meant to promote her <hi rend="italic">own</hi>.
I hope Mr. Arnold will be as sensible of
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> fault as I am of <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, and that he will
never fall into the like indiscretion again.
I believe there can be no true happiness but
between a <hi rend="italic">married</hi> pair who sincerely love
each other.
</p>
<p>Good! good! thought I; sure my better
genius prompts the woman to speak
thus.  Ah, Mrs. Gerrarde, how exactly
do your thoughts correspond with mine!
How just are all your sentiments!  What
a true relish have you for virtue!  Yes, I
hope with you that Mr. Arnold will be
able to tread in your steps: it is a pity he
has not your noble example before him.
Mrs. Arnold is a good woman, and he
might still live with her in tolerable contentment,
if he can get the better of his irregular
passion for you.  What a noble
triumph of virtuous resolution would this
be, if you yourself were the instrument

<pb n="91"/>
to bring this about.  For Mrs. Arnold's
and her brother's sake, as well as you
own, I wish this were feasible.
</p>
<p>I would do any thing in my power,
said she (thinking she obliged me by the
declaration); but I know not by what
means such an event can be brought to
pass.
</p>
<p>I was afraid to urge the matter farther;
I was within a hair's breadth of gaining
my point, but did not think it prudent to
press too forward.  We'll think of it another
time, said I, and groaned heavily,
as if my spirits were fatigued with talking.
She took the hint.  I am afraid I
have tired you; you have talked too
much.  I answered her faintly, You are
very good!  She curtesied to me, and retired
with a majestic step.  I saw her no
more that day: she had got upon stilts,
and it was not yet time to take her down.
To-morrow may produce a wonder: I
will wait for it.  I am really weak, but
begin to recover my spirits.
</p>

<p></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Boulogne, December 6</hi>.
</p>
<p>Nothing is so conducive to the body's
health, as the mind's being at ease.  I have

<pb n="92"/>
proved the truth of this observation: my
soul had been racked with suspence and
uncertainty during my illness; the uneasy
state of my mind increased my disorder;
the disorder itself had chiefly given rise to
my apprehensions, as pain and sickness
are naturally accompanied with a gloominess
of thought.  Thus the cause and its
effects were united in mutual league
against me, and reciprocally assisted each
other to plague and torment me.
</p>
<p>My fears were intirely on Mrs. Arnold's
account.  What, thought I, would
be the consequence of my project in case
of my death?  Mrs. Gerrarde will return
back to England; and, upon telling her
story, will be received again by Arnold;
their union perhaps established as firmly
as before, and poor Mrs. Arnold's hopes
ruined for ever.  Then I thought what a
wretch I must appear in her eyes, doubtful,
may be, of my sincerity as to the motives
I urged to you for my conduct.  On
the other hand, if these motives should
by any means happen to be suspected by
Mrs. Gerrarde, it might be the means of
producing the direct contrary effect from

<pb n="93"/>
what I intended; and instead of banishing
Arnold's cruel suspicions of his lady, only
serve to strengthen them; for I knew Mrs.
Gerrarde would leave nothing unsaid or
undone for this horrid purpose; and it is
not every one, Sir George whose hearts
are enlarged enough to suppose a man
may now-and-then take a little pains from
disinterested principles.  This last suggestion
of my thoughts made me almost
mad, and actually brought on a delirium;
and what may seem a paradox, though it
is literally true, the total deprivation of
my senses for two days was the means of
my recovering them afterwards; for I am
sure, had I retained enough of them to
have ruminated longer on this fatal supposition,
and my disorder had still threatened
me with death, I should have run
mad.  The care of a skilful physician recalled
me from the precincts of the grave:
the strength of a constitution, naturally
good, joined to all the resolution I could
muster, did the rest.
</p>
<p>The first use I made of my recovered
reason was, to consult with myself in

<pb n="94"/>
what manner, or by what means, I should
prevail on Mrs. Gerrarde to lend a helping
hand to my design.  Her leaving Arnold
to go off with me, and to all human
appearance with her own consent, was a
material point gained; but the most important
of all, and without which every
thing else would be fruitless, was to get
her to acknowlege, under her own hand,
the injury she had done Mrs. Arnold by
her vile insinuations to her husband.  This
was the grand object of all my wishes.
This, you will say, was difficult: I confess
it did then appear so to me.  I had
not at first weighed all the consequences
of my enterprize with that deliberation
that I ought.  The principal object I had
in view was, the separating Mrs. Gerrarde
and Mr. Arnold, and raising his
indignation against her, on account of the
apparent infidelity on her side.  To say the
truth, I had not considered what I was to
do with her when I had her.  Two things
I had resolved on; the one was, not to
let her return to England; the other, to
provide for her in whatever way she would

<pb n="95"/>
put it in my power (the devoting myself
to her excepted) in such a manner as
should leave her no room to reproach me
with having injured her temporal welfare.
</p>
<p>During my illness, I had revolved all
these things in my mind: the last, viz.
the providing for Mrs. Gerrarde, was not
a matter in which I expected to meet
many difficulties; the other appeared very
formidable.  Several methods presented
themselves, but none of them pleased me,
and I rejected them one after the other;
and, to tell you my mind honestly, I was
almost resolved on using compulsion, and
frightening the poor woman into compliance:
for I preferred even this to artificial
dealings.  I had already used more
than I could have possibly brought myself
to on any other occasion in the world;
and I think I should have threatened her
with a nunnery, the Bastile, or even an
inquisition, sooner than have failed, if she
herself had not beyond expectation, beyond
hope, almost beyond the evidence of
my senses, led me as it were to request the
thing of her, which of all others I most

<pb n="96"/>
despaired of her consenting to, or even
hearing proposed with patience.  And yet,
notwithstanding the seeming strangeness
of this, it was nothing but what was very
natural, and most consonant to her own
designs.  Blinded, and, as I may say, infatuated
by vanity, she imagined, that as
I had taken such uncommon pains to obtain
her, I must love her with an uncommon
degree of passion; and that her steadily
refusing any dishonourable proposals,
might induce me, rather than lose her, to
make her my wife.
</p>
<p>In order to prepare me the better for
this, no means were more natural, than
for her to assume the air of a penitent, to
seem sorry and ashamed of her past sins,
and resolve on a virtuous course for the
future.  At the worst, that is, if she found
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> was not disposed to be as virtuous as
herself, she knew she might play an aftergame;
and could easily relax by degrees
from the severity of her chastity, accordingly
as I made it worth her while.
</p>
<p>This was the master-key to her behaviour,
and when once I had got it, which

<pb n="97"/>
I soon did, it was easy to unlock her
breast.
</p>
<p>She came into my room the next morning
without an invitation, and only the
previous ceremony of sending Rachael to
inquire how I did, and to tell me, if I
were well enough to <hi rend="italic">rise</hi> (observe her
nicety) she would sit half an hour with
me.  I had enjoyed such tranquillity of
heart since my last conference with her,
and had rested so well the preceding night,
that I found myself quite another thing
from what I was the day before; and,
excepting a little weakness, I was as well
as ever I was in my life.  I was up and
dressed, and you may be sure sent a suitable
answer to her kind message, which
soon brought the lady, sailing with an
imperial port, into my chamber.  After
some civilities past on both sides, she,
by way of bringing her own interests on
the tapis, re-assumed the topic of our yesterday's
conversation.
</p>
<p>You can't imagine, Mr. Faulkland,
said she, how easy I am in my mind, since
I have reconciled myself to the loss of

<pb n="98"/>
Mr. Arnold.  I own I had a regard for
him; but I think it had more of gratitude
than love in it; for though her is an agreeable
man, to say the truth, he never was
quite to my taste: he had always something
too formal about him.
</p>
<p>I took the liberty to ask her, how she
first came acquainted with Mr. Arnold;
and, as you may not know it, I will give
you the story.  She answered, with a profound
sigh, It was by mere accident I first
saw him.  After the death of Captain
Gerrarde, which happened in a little more
than a year after we left Bath, for the
gout, poor man, got into his stomach not
long after we returned home (and the crocodile
pretended to drop a tear) I went
to London, in order to solicit for my pension.
As I had formerly been a Roman
Catholic, and had not publicly renounced
that persuasion, some difficulties arose in
the business; and a friend of my deceased
husband, who had undertaken the affair
for me, happening to be an intimate of
Mr. Arnold's, and knowing he had an
influence with the secretary at war, endeavoured

<pb n="99"/>
to interest him in my favour, by
representing my situation in the most affecting
light he could to him.  He kindly
undertook to interfere for me, and was as
good as his word; but could not surmount
the difficulty of the objection which
was made to my claim.  He happened
one morning, unluckily for me, to call
in at my friend's lodgings, to tell him of
his ill success: I, impatient to know how
my affair went on, had dropped in to inquire
about it a few minutes before him,
and was sitting in the dining-room when
Mr. Arnold entered.  I was in my weeds,
and my melancholy looks I believe made
Mr. Arnold conjecture I was the person
for whom he had so kindly concerned
himself.   He told my friend he was sorry
to inform him, that though he had used
all means in his power, with regard to the
affair in which he had employed him, he
found it was impossible to affect the business;
and I am the more concerned, said
he, turning towards me, as I am afraid
this lady is to be the sufferer.  My relation
said I was the person for whom he
<pb n="100"/>
had been so good as to intercede.  I returned
Mr. Arnold thanks, not without
tears, at the uncomfortable prospect I had
before me; for I had then nothing to depend
on but my small jointure in Kent.
I was about to take my leave; but observing
it rained, desired my friend to
give his servant leave to call me a chair.
Mr. Arnold very politely desired I would
permit him to set me down, as his chariot
waited at the door.  I would have excused
myself; but my relation said, 'Tis
in his way, child; and since you have
no hopes of a pension, you ought to
be sparing of chair-hire.  Mr. Arnold
very obligingly offered me his hand, and
led me to his chariot.  He set me down at
my lodgings, and at parting desired permission
to wait on me.  The fatal consequence
of our acquaintance it was impossible
for me to foresee; for I never had
the least hint given me, either from my
own relation or Mr. Arnold himself, that
he was a married man, till he had so far
secured my gratitude, by repeated acts of
generosity, that it was impossible for me
to refuse him the return he demanded.

<pb n="101"/>
</p>
<p>Too-grateful heart, said I (pretending
to believe her cant) what a pity thou wert
not destined to reward a purer love!  But
I thought, madam, you really had enjoyed
a pension?
</p>
<p>It was not necessary, she answered, that
I should let the world suppose otherwise.
I was not at all known when I first came
to town.  Mr. Arnold's excessive profuseness
(quite against my inclination) threw
me into a more expensive way of living
than before.  I found myself obliged to
account for it, to the few acquaintance I
had, by all the probable means I could
devise.  For this purpose, I pretended
that I had not only obtained a pension,
but had also a fortune left me by the death
of a relation.  This was believed, as no-body troubled their heads to inquire whether
it was true or not.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold was passionately fond of the
country, and always passed his summers
there: but as he could not think of parting
with me, he was sadly at a loss how
to have me near him, without bringing on
us both the observation of an inquisitive

<pb n="102"/>
neighbourhood (such as all country places
abound in) if I went down, quite a
stranger as I was, into Essex; particularly
as he told me there were two families
near Arnold-abbey, who made it their
business to pry into other peoples affairs.
These were, a lady Grimston, a censorious
old woman, and the parson of the parish,
who was a mighty strict man, of
whom Mr. Arnold seemed to stand in some
awe.  He therefore determined against my
going into that part of the world: but
having casually heard me speak of my little
cottage in Kent, where poor Captain
Gerrarde and I had lived for two or three
years, he asked me whereabouts it was,
and was delighted to find it joined his
own estate at South park, and was within
a mile of his house.  He begged of me to
go down to my own house, which he insisted
on furnishing elegantly for me, and
obliged me also to keep a chariot.  I (tho'
unwillingly) found myself under a necessity
of complying.  About a fortnight after
I was settled at Ashby, Mr. Arnold
and his family came down: then it was

<pb n="103"/>
that, for the first time, I saw his lady.
I went to pay my compliments to her, as
every genteel family in the neighbourhood
did; and I own I never saw her without
feeling myself shocked to death at the
thoughts of the injury I did her; for I
really believe Mrs. Arnold is a very well-meaning woman.
</p>
<p>Oh, thou scorpion! muttered I to my-self, and yet thou hast pursued her to affliction
and ruin!
</p>
<p>That Mrs. Arnold is a well-meaning
woman, said I coldly, I have no doubt:
yet you see Mr. Arnold's opinion of her
virtue was not strong enough to be proof
against suspicions; for it is most certain,
that, if he had not given credit to your
representations of his wife's conduct, he
would not have gone such lengths as to
have parted with her; for Arnold had
always some regard to appearances.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">My</hi> representations, Sir! with a look of
astonishment; pray do not lay more to
my charge than I deserve: what the particular
reasons were, which induced Mr.
Arnold to part with his wife, I will not

<pb n="104"/>
say; but whatever his suspicions were,
they never took their rise from me.
</p>
<p>I found she intended to brazen this denial
out; but as it was absolutely necessary
to my design to bring her to a confession
of this particular act of perfidy, I resolved
to lead her into it in such a way as should
be least mortifying to her pride.
</p>
<p>Come, come, my dear Mrs. Gerrarde,
said I, I know you are above concealing
any past failings that you are resolved to
mend.  I know very well that it was <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
insinuations, and your's only, that kindled
the fire of jealousy in Arnold's breast.  Such
arts are not uncommon in lovers.  You
loved him then, and wished to have him
intirely to yourself; and a wife, though a
forsaken one, is still intitled to so much
attention from her husband, as a fond mistress
may think robs her of too much.  I
know this was the case, and it is natural:
but were you not an unmerciful little tyrant
to involve <hi rend="italic">me</hi> in the mischief, and put
it into the man's noddle, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had designs
upon his wife?
</p>
<p>The easy manner in which I affected to

<pb n="105"/>
speak of this affair, seemed to reconcile
her a little to the charge; but the last part
of it, which regarded myself, struck her
all of a heap.  She had no notion that I
knew it.  She was going to speak, to deny
the accusation, I suppose, and therefore I
prevented her; and taking her by the
hand, Come now, said I deal, with me
ingenuously; and if you would persuade
me that you are really in earnest, and
mean to repair those little lapses which
you have inconsiderately been led into, tell
me truly, did you really believe that I
ever had any thoughts of an amour with
Mrs. Arnold?
</p>
<p>I chose to give my inquiry this turn,
that she might, with less shame to herself,
by laying hold on the hint, acknowlege
her guilt.  She hesitated for an answer,
and I guessed she was considering whether
to persist in denying the whole charge
against her, or avail herself of the handle
I had given her, and make a sort of merit
of her sincerity, by pretending to believe
what she was thoroughly convinced there
was not the least foundation even to suspect,

<pb n="106"/>
but what her own wicked suggestions
had encouraged in the unfortunate Arnold.
Her silence, thus rightly interpreted
by me, made me go on: You see I know
all your secrets: and you are not the woman
I take you for, if you conceal your
real sentiments in this particular: more of
my quiet depends on it than you are aware
of, and I withdrew my hand from her's
with a serious and almost resenting air.
</p>
<p>She appeared disturbed, and in a good
deal of confusion; but recovering herself,
Why really, Mr. Faulkland, I can't say
but I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> some suspicion of what you
mention.  I was no stranger to your fondness
for Mrs. Arnold before she was married,
and there was nothing very surprising
in a disappointed lover's renewing his
hopes, when he thought the neglect which
a lady met with from her husband, might
incline her to be less obdurate to a man she
was once known to favour so much.
</p>
<p>This was enough: I did not think it
by any means necessary to press her to a
farther explanation; what she said was a
sufficient acknowlegement of her fault,

<pb n="107"/>
though the cunning sorceress had turned
the hint (which I had indeed thrown out
on purpose) to her own advantage; and
had the effrontery to avow an opinion
which had never before entered into her
imagination.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I found it necessary now to carry on the
farce, by assuring her, I had never entertained
a thought to Mrs. Arnold's dishonour;
and that though I made no great
scruple of robbing a man of his mistress,
yet I thought it a crime of the blackest
dye to deprive him of the affection or
fidelity of his wife.
</p>
<p>The serious manner in which I spoke
this a little disconcerted Mrs. Gerrarde.
Well, said she, I can only say, that I am
very sorry I entertained so false a suspicion;
and more so, as it has produced
such unhappy consequences: but I hope
Mr. Faulkland will not believe that I meant
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> any injury.
</p>
<p>That I am sure you did not, said I;
and yet this very affair has given me more
uneasiness than you can imagine; for as
Mrs. Arnold's brother is my most particular

<pb n="108"/>
friend, he must think me the greatest
of villains, if I could entertain a
thought of dishonouring his family: the
fear of losing his friendship, I own, gives
me more pain than I can express, and
there is nothing I would not do to exculpate
myself to him.
</p>
<p>I am very unfortunate, cried Mrs. Gerrarde
(pretending to wipe her eyes) to have
been the occasion of so much uneasiness in
any-body's family.  I wish I had died before
I was so unhappy as to meet with
Mr. Arnold: if it had not been for him,
I might now have been an innocent and a
contented woman; and she <hi rend="italic">really</hi> squeezed
out a tear, though not of contrition.
</p>
<p>Dear madam (again taking her hand)
do not afflict yourself for what is past recalling:
contentment, nay happiness, I
hope, is yet within your reach; it will be
your own fault if you do not lay hold of
it: as for the unhappy family that <hi rend="italic">I</hi>, as
well as <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, have contributed to distress, I
wish from my heart there could be a reunion
amongst them.  Mr. Arnold's having
lost you, might perhaps incline him to

<pb n="109"/>
turn his thoughts towards his wife, if he
were not prejudiced against her by the
suspicions he had entertained of her virtue.
This I am afraid will be an insuperable
bar to their ever living together,
unless your influence, which first gave
birth to his jealousy, is still forcible
enough to remove it.
</p>
<p>I wish it were in my power, said Mrs.
Gerrarde; there is nothing I would not
do to effect it: but what influence can I
have on Mr. Arnold, after what has happened?
</p>
<p>Suppose you were to write to him, said
I: you and he probably may never meet
again; and it would be an effort worthy
indeed of a noble mind, to repair the
wrongs we have done to others, by a candid
acknowlegement of our own faults.
Putting Mrs. Arnold out of the question,
'tis a reparation you own <hi rend="italic">my</hi> character;
for however light the world may make of
a piece of gallantry with a married woman,
it is a matter of serious moment to
me to acquit myself of the supposed crime
to Sir George Bidulph.

<pb n="110"/>
</p>
<p>If you think, said she, that my writing
to Mr. Arnold could produce such good
effects, I am ready to do it; though I
confess I hardly know how to address
him; for he must, to be sure, look upon
me as the very reverse of what I <hi rend="italic">really</hi> am,
and thinks me without dispute an ungrateful
woman.
</p>
<p>We can but try, said I: if it does not
produce the desired effect, it will not be
your fault; and you will have the satisfaction
to reflect, that you have done your
duty.  I stepped to my escrutoir while I
was speaking; and resolving not to give
her time to cool, took out pen, ink,
and paper, and laid them on a little
writing-table before her.  If this unlucky
breach, said I, were once made up, my
mind would then be easy.
</p>
<p>She took the pen in her hand, but
seemed irresolute, and at a loss how to begin.
Come, madam, said I, and confute,
by your own example, the received erroneous
opinion, that if a woman once
strays from the paths of virtue, she never
returns to them.

<pb n="111"/>
</p>
<p>A false and ill-grounded opinion indeed,
said she, lifting up her prophane
eyes as in penitence.  What am I to say?
</p>
<p>[You are to observe, that my notes, as
she went along while I dictated, are put
between hooks.]
</p>
<p>[Begin] 'Dear Sir' [for I would be neither
too familiar nor too cold] 'The terms
on which you and I have lived, intitles
you to an explanation of my reasons for
leaving you so abruptly; and I hope the
generosity of my motive will incline you
to overlook the seeming unkindness of
the action.' [This you may assure yourself
it will, when he comes to consider
coolly.] 'The unhappiness that I occasioned
in your family, by causing the
separation of you and your wife, has,
for a long time, been a thorn in my
heart; and the more so, as besides the
robbing her of your affections, I own,
and take shame to myself in the confession'
[How noble must he think this confession!]
that those aspersions, which I
threw on her, had not the least foundation
in truth.' [This is truly great.] 'I

<pb n="112"/>
always believed her perfectly innocent;
but if I could have had the least possible
doubt of it before, I must now be confirmed
in that opinion by Mr. Faulkland,
who can have no reason for excusing
or concealing facts of this nature
from me at present;' [Here she added
of herself, repeating it first aloud to me]
and I think the preference he has given
me to her, now in her state of separation,
is a convincing proof of this.'  [An
admirable argument] (her vanity would
not let her slip this observation.) [Proceed,
madam.] 'The true reasons of my
insinuations against her, were no other
than that I could not bear to share your
affections with any-body' [and a very
sufficient reason too, which a man that
loves can easily forgive].  'I knew, that
so long as she gave you no cause of
complaint, you were too just to withdraw
your whole heart from her, and nothing
but the whole would content me.'
[Still you see you shew a great mind.
True, said she, going on; but my reason
for leaving him without apprizing him of

<pb n="113"/>
it, what are we to say for that: Oh,
nothing more easy to execute: he will admire
you the more for the reason <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall
give.  Come.]  'My departing without
first making you acquainted with my design,
and going off with another person,
may at first sight seem very strange;
but, to tell yo the real state of my
heart, I found I could not trust to its
firmness on the subject of parting with
you.  I loved you so, that it was with
pain and grief I made the resolution;
and I knew too well, that had you used
any arguments, which to be sure you
would have done to dissuade me, I, like
an easy fool, would have given up all
my good designs.'  [I am only afraid
this will make him love you more than
ever.]  (She smiled as she continued to
write.)  'As for the other article'&mdash;[This
I was more puzzled to excuse than the
first; but, putting on a bold face, I said,
Madam, I hope you will not condemn me
here, while you excuse yourself: the saying
you were <hi rend="italic">run away</hi> with, will knock
all the rest on the head, and he may choose

<pb n="114"/>
whether he will believe that you really intended
to break off with him or not;
therefore that particular had better not be
touched upon.  Well, said she, get me
out of this scrape as cleverly as you
brought me into it.  Fear not, said I; go
on.] 'As for the other article, though I
'shall never love Mr. Faulkland as I have
done you, yet in him I have found a
protector; and through his means, I hope
to pass the remainder of my life in a
manner more suitable to a woman of a
generous way of thinking, than that
wherein she considered herself as encroaching
on the rights of another.  I
hope, by this sacrifice which I have made
of my love to a more heroic principle,
that I shall expiate my former offence;
and that you will follow my example so
far as to make what reparation you can
to the woman we have both injured.'
[How this must raise, how exalt you in
his opinion!  I think it must, cried she,
bridling up her head, as if they were
really her own sentiments.]
</p>
<p>I believe, said I, this is all that is necessary

<pb n="115"/>
to be said: you may add, in a postscript,
that, as he furnished the house for
you at Ashby, every thing in it is at his
service; together with your chariot and
horses, which were also his gifts.
</p>
<p>She demurred to this; and in the midst
of her heroics, said, I wish I could get
somebody to sell them for me privately,
and remit the money to me; for, since I
<hi rend="italic">am</hi> here, I should like to see a little more
of France before I return.
</p>
<p>I told her that would look mean, and
below a <hi rend="italic">great mind</hi>.  Well, said she, let
them go.  I owe all my servant's a year's
wages, and another person about fifty
pounds for a little temple he had just built
in my garden, and not quite finished when
I came away.  I think I had better desire
those debts to be discharged: I have
always been very punctual in my dealings;
and would not for the world <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> any
body.
</p>
<p>You are in the right, said I: it will
look honourable in you to desire those
debts to be paid.
</p>
<p>She now proceeded to conclude her

<pb n="115"/>
letter in the same stile she had begun it,
and added a postscript to the purport I
mentioned.  I hastened to make her seal
it up, and direct it to Mr. Arnold at his
house in London, who, I suppose, has had
the pleasure of receiving it before now;
for I dispatched it off directly.  I flatter
myself with the hope that it will have the
desired effect on him.
</p>
<p>You will think, perhaps, that, as I have
managed it, I have really given her a sort
of merit with him in the acknowlegement
of her fault, and the pretended reason she
gives for leaving him.  No such thing, Sir
George.  Arnold is a man of too much
sense, and knows the world too well, to
be so deceived.  I have been told by my
lord V&mdash;, who knows him perfectly, that
nobody judges better when he is not blinded
by his passions.  All her professions must
go for nothing when <hi rend="italic">facts</hi> are against her.
'Tis plain she went off with another man,
and to all appearances premeditately, as
her maid and her riches bore her company.
'Tis also plain, by her own confession,
that this man stands well with her.

<pb n="117"/>
As for her recanting her injurious aspersions
on poor Mrs. Arnold, 'tis the only
circumstance in her letter likely to gain
belief, as she could have no temptation to
that but real compunction, with which
people of that kind are sometimes visited;
and for the rest of her letter, to any one
of common understanding, that lays circumstances
together, it will appear, as I
intended it should, the contrivance of an
artful jilt, who having almost ruined the
wretch she has had in her power, would
afterwards make a <hi rend="italic">merit</hi> of deserting him;
for they must be hardened reprobates indeed
that would not, if they could, at
least <hi rend="italic">try</hi> to palliate their evil deeds.  This
is the light I expect Arnold will consider
her in.  I know he is hurt deeply in his
fortune by this vile harpy.  I hope the
remnant may be sufficient to support your
excellent sister, if not in affluence, at least
with comfort, should she regain her influence
over him, and submit to live with
him again.,  This, I am sure, will be
the consequence, if he is not blind to his
own happiness.

<pb n="118"/>
</p>
<p>I shall be impatient to know how the
letter operates on him; but this you are
not likely to be let into; and perhaps his
pride may make him endeavour to conceal
it from every body.  My lord V&mdash;, I
am sure, will pick up some intelligence,
and send it to me.
</p>
<p>I think Mrs. Gerrarde's confession, in regard
to Mrs. Arnold (to which she could
have no interested motive) with the corroborating
circumstance of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> going off
with her, at a time when Mrs. Arnold was
from under her husband's protection, injured
by him in the tenderest point, and
aspersed by a barbarous and invidious
world; all this I say must surely clear from
all suspicion that admirable creature: for
who that knows Mrs. Arnold would think
that any man (except her husband) would
prefer any woman upon earth to her?  If
this does not remove all doubt of her conduct
in Arnold, as well as in the rest of the
world, my pains have been to little purpose;
and I know no other human means
that can be used to disabuse the mad credulity
of that man.  I pity him from my

<pb n="119"/>
heart in his present situation; for it will
be some time before he will be sensible of
the good I have done him; and, I dare
swear, the man is at this time so ungrateful,
that, if he could, he would cut my
throat.  I do not want to have him know
the extent of his obligation to me: I shall
be satisfied to sit down in the contemplation
of my meritorious actions, without
enjoying the fame of them.  This greatness
of mind I learnt of Mrs. Gerrarde.
But to return.
</p>
<p>The having gained my material point
put me into such spirits, that I could have
kissed Mrs. Gerrarde; a liberty which, I
assure you, however I never presumed to
take.  She, for her part, seemed as well
pleased with what she had done as I was.
I praised her for the part she had acted, tho'
I very much feared she would repent of it
when we came to explanations, which
I resolved should be on that very day.  I
told her, I hoped she would oblige
me with her company at dinner.  She
consented with a bow.  I had ordered one
to be got ready earlier than usual, and directed

<pb n="120"/>
that it should be in her apartment.
We were told it was on table.  I never
saw Mrs. Gerrarde so agreeable as she was
during dinner; she was in high spirits and
good-humour: I almost thought it a pity
to let her down that day; but I considered
the longer her expectations were kept up,
the greater would be her disappointment;
and out of pure charity, I determined to
put her out of doubt.
</p>
<p>I had been told Mrs. Gerrarde was no
enemy to a chearful glass; but the designs
she had formed upon me put her on her
guard, and I observed she drank nothing
but wine and water, made very small.
This, I was afraid would not be sufficient
to keep up her courage under what I intended
to say to her.  I pretended to be
disposed to drink, and insisted on her helping
me out with a flask of Burgundy.
With affected coyness she suffered me to
fill her glass; the second offer I made,
her resistance was less; the third she made
no objection to at all; and the fourth she
filled for herself.  The wine was excellent;
not that poor sort which is commonly

<pb n="121"/>
drunk in France.  In short, we
finished our bottle.  I thought her now a
match for what I had to say.  I had made
the glass pass briskly, and had filled up the
intervals with singing catches, and rattling
on any subject that came into my head.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde, who no doubt expected
I should make an advance of some kind
or other, seemed to grow a little out of
humour at my levity.  I found the Burgundy
had been quite thrown away upon
her, and had had very little effect: She was
silent for a few minutes, and seemed to
be considering of something: at last she
opened, and I will give you the conversation
that passed between us, by way of
dialogue.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G</hi>. Mr. Faulkland, it is time that
you and I should understand one another's
meaning a little better than we do at present:
you know very well that you have
put an end to all my expectations in England:
indeed, if I were at liberty, I could
not have the face to return there again in
any character but that of your wife.  (I
was glad she began first, and that, though

<pb n="122"/>
I guessed at her views, she had used so
little caution in discovering them, as it at
once roused in me an indignation which I
could not suppress, and without which I
could not have brought myself to mortify
her as she deserved).
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> My <hi rend="italic">wife</hi>, madam! (stopping
her at that tremendous word) be pleased
to tell me if I heard you right?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Yes, Sir, it was your wife I
said: if you think you and I are to live
together on any other terms, you will
find yourself exceedingly mistaken.  (I
smiled, and suffered her to go on.)  I
thought, Sir (stifling the anger that I saw
rising) that the words which you yourself
dictated in the letter which I just now
wrote, where you say, <hi rend="italic">I had in you found
a protector, and one by whose means I should
be able to pass the rest of my life in a manner
more suitable to a woman of a generous way
of thinking, than that wherein she considered
herself as incroaching on the rights of another</hi>
&mdash;Were not these your own words,
Sir?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> They were, madam. (To say

<pb n="123"/>
the truth, there was something equivocal
in the paragraph, though, when I desired
her to write it, this construction never entered
into my head.)
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Then, Sir, how am I to understand
them?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> I protest, madam, you have
forced a construction that I never once so
much as dreamed of.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Why, Mr. Faulkland (with a
very brisk tone) do you fansy that by
changing Mr. Arnold for <hi rend="italic">you</hi> on any other
conditions, that I am such a mighty gainer
by the bargain?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Why really, madam, if that
<hi rend="italic">were</hi> to be the case, I don't think you
would be a very great loser: you have got
as much from poor Arnold as you could
expect: I am able to do better for you;
and, as I am nobody's property, it would
certainly, in <hi rend="italic">that</hi> respect, be rather a more
eligible course.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Sir, you use me very ill!  I did
not expect such treatment.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> How, pray, madam! Did I ever
say I would marry you?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> No, Sir; but your behaviour
has given me room to suppose that such
a thing was in your thoughts.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Are you not then the more
obliged to me for treating you with such
respect as made you fansy so?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Respect! respect (muttering
between her teeth) Mr. Faulkland! (and
she stood up) there is not a man in England
but yourself, after what I have declared,
that would refuse making me his
wife.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> What have you declared, Mrs.
Gerrarde?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Why, have I not ingenuously
owned my failings, shewed myself sorry
for them, quitted them, and made all the
reparation in my power?
</p>
<p>(I was amazed to see how audaciously
she had adopted as her own, the sentiments
which I had suggested to her: it
was so like her, that I could have laughed
in her face.)
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Your behaviour, on this occasion,
has really been worthy of the imitation
of all your own sex, and the praise of

<pb n="125"/>
ours: for a woman <hi rend="italic">voluntarily</hi> to quit an
irregular life, and that too from mere motives
of <hi rend="italic">conscience</hi>&mdash;(I was stopped by a
knavish sneer, which I could not subdue.
She saw it, and fired immediately; but
strutted about the room to cool herself:
at last, for I sat very silent, looking at her,
and playing with one of the glasses)&mdash;
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Mr. Faulkland, if you are
disposed to have done trifling, and will
vouchsafe me a serious answer, pray tell
me, Are you absolutely determined not to
marry me?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Absolutely.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> You are not serious, sure!
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> My dear creature, why sure <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>
canst not be serious in asking me the
question!
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Sir, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> serious, and expect a
serious answer.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Why then,&mdash;seriously, I have
no more thoughts of marrying thee, than
I have of marrying the first sultana in the
grand seignior's seraglio.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Very well, Sir; very well; I
am answered (and she walked quicker
about the room than before).

<pb n="126"/>
</p>
<p>We were both silent.  She, I suppose,
expected that I should propose other terms,
and a settlement; and waited, to try if I
would speak.  I had a mind to teaze her
a little, and hummed a tune.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> (Advancing to me, and making
a low curt'sey, with a most scornful and
sarcastical air) May I presume to inquire
what your mightiness's pleasure is in regard
to me?  Do you intend to keep me for
your nurse against your next illness, or to
send me to the grand seignior's seraglio
to wait upon the first sultana?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Neither (carelessly, and looking
another way).  I have not yet determined
which way I shall dispose of you.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> <hi rend="italic">Dispose</hi> of me! <hi rend="italic">dispose</hi> of me!
why sure the man has lost his senses!
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Look you, Mrs. Gerrarde; we
will play no longer at cross-purposes: sit
down, and be calm for a few minutes, till
you hear what I have to say.
</p>
<p>(Se did so, with a kind of impatience
in her looks, that informed me I might
have made a very free proposal, without
any great danger of her resentment.)

<pb n="127"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> How long have you and I been
acquainted?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Lord! what is that question to
the purpose?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> 'Tis only in order to my desiring
you would look back, and upon recollection
ask yourself, if you ever had any
reason to look upon me as your lover?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> I made that observation to you
when we were travelling together: what
is the use of it now?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Did I, in the course of our
journey, declare myself to be such, or
drop the least hint of devoting myself to
you on any condition?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> We did not talk on the subject
at all.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Did I ever presume, on the advantage
of having you in my power, to
venture on the smallest liberty with you?
or ever deviate from that respect in my
behaviour, that I was used, at all other
times, to treat you with?
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> I do not say you did; and it
was that very behaviour that inclined me
to imagine you had other thoughts than
those I find you have.

<pb n="128"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> You drew a wrong conclusion,
though it is to be confessed not a very unnatural
one.  Such a behaviour might have
been so construed by a lady otherwise circumstanced
than you were; but I think
a woman of your sagacity might have
concluded, that, with Mrs. Gerrarde, a
man would first have tried his fortune upon
gentler terms than those of matrimony.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi> Well, well (peevishly); I do
not understand your riddles: to the point.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Why, the point, in short, is
this; that, without any particular designs
on your person, my whole view, in carrying
you out of England, was to break off
your intercourse with Mr. Arnold.
</p>
<p>(She seemed thunder-struck; but recovering
herself, And is <hi rend="italic">this</hi> what I am to
hear calmly?  And she flounced off the
chair to the other end of the room.
</p>
<p>I followed her; and, taking her hand,
begged she would again sit down, and
hear me out.  I drew her to a chair, and
gently set her down in it.)
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Now, for your own sake, hear
me with patience; violence or perverseness
will be of no use to you.

<pb n="129"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mrs. G.</hi>  Very well, Sir; I am your prisoner;
your <hi rend="italic">slave</hi> at present: say what you
please; 'tis <hi rend="italic">your</hi> turn <hi rend="italic">now</hi>.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr. F.</hi> Well then, madam, as I said
before, I really never had any designs
upon you merely on your own account.  I
allow you to be a very fine woman, and
capable of inspiring love in any man that
sees you; but I must tell you plainly, that
<hi rend="italic">love</hi> has had no share in my conduct.  (I
saw stifled rage in her face; but I proceeded.)
I have already told you the real
motive of my carrying you off: it was, as
I said, to dissolve the union between you
and Mr. Arnold; and my reasons for wishing
to do so are these: Mr. Arnold is
married to one of the best women living,
for whom I have the highest respect, and
esteem, and whom I once adored: That
lady has, by your influence over her husband,
not only been thrown out from his
heart, but even thrust out from his house.
But the calamity stops not there; she is
cruelly aspersed by the world through your
suggestions, and I am the person pointed
at for the injurer of Mr. Arnold's honour,

<pb n="130"/>
and the destroyer of his wife's innocence.
You have brought shame and grief into a
worthy family.  Lady Bidulph (an excellent
woman) has not been able to overcome
the shock of the barbarous treatment her
daughter has met with.  Her brother, the
beloved friend of my heart, suffers equal
distress; for though he is conscious of
his sister's innocence, he feels the wounds
that her reputation has received; nor can
he possibly redress the mischief, as his sister's
injuries spring from a cause which
her delicacy will not permit to be scrutinized.
Her two poor children are left
without a mother; she herself almost without
a friend, and sinking every day under
the weight of such complicated misery.
As for Mr. Arnold himself, I profess no
personal regard for him: I scarce know
him; but, for his family's sake, I would,
on any <hi rend="italic">other</hi> occasion, risque my life to
save him from ruin; for ruin you have
almost brought on him.  I am no stranger
to the sums he has lavished on you; his
purchasing an employment for <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of your
brothers, and redeeming another from a

<pb n="131"/>
prison.  You have lost nothing by my
proceedings but what I shall make up ten-fold to you, if you behave so as to deserve
my kindness.  I have now laid before you
the true reasons for my conduct.  I hope,
that by breaking the inchantment that
tied Mr. Arnold's heart, and blinded his
understanding, he may be induced to do
justice to his injured lady and her family.
If this comes to pass, as I have strong
reason to hope, I have no doubt of the
lady's character being retrieved.  <hi rend="italic">Groundless</hi>
calumnies generally die of themselves,
unless industriously kept alive by malice.
Mrs. Arnold's blameless conduct, the
friendship her brother has all along continued
to favour me with, joined to this last
apparent proof of my attachment to you,
will, I am certain, in the eyes of the world,
acquit her of all suspicion of guilt.  Your
letter to Mr. Arnold will, as far as relates
to your own opinion of her, give unquestionable
evidence of her innocence.
</p>
<p>Now, Mrs. Gerrarde, lay your hand on
your heart, and answer me if I have not
given you reasons, which, though they

<pb n="132"/>
not be satisfactory to you, are in
themselves of weight sufficient to justify
my conduct.
</p>
<p>I had watched her countenance narrowly
during my discourse, which she had listened
to without once looking at me.  I
saw I had shocked and even confounded
her; but I saw no remorse, no contrition
in her looks.  All artifice was now at an
end, and she unmasked the fiend directly.
She started off the chair with the looks
and gestures of a fury; and fixing her eyes
(which had really something diabolical in
them at that instant) steadily on me, You
wretch! she cried with a voice answerable
to her looks, you are such a false, dissembling,
mean-spirited reptile, that if you
had a kingdom to offer me, and would
lay yourself at my feet to beg my acceptance
of you, I would trample on you like
dirt! and she stamped on the floor with the
air of an Amazon.  Do you think you shall
carry on this fine-contrived enterprize?
No, if I perish for it, I will have vengeance:
Mr. Arnold shall know how I have
been deceived and betrayed, and I will at

<pb n="133"/>
least have the satisfaction of getting your
life, if I lose every thing besides.
</p>
<p>A burst of malignant tears now gushed
from her eyes, but she robbed them of
their efficacy, by mixing with them the
bitterest imprecations against me.  She
curst even the innocent Mrs. Arnold, you,
and the whole family, and her own folly,
in being blinded by the arts of such a
worthless milk-sop as myself.
</p>
<p>I let her give vent to her passion, calmly
walking about the room all the time;
only now-and-then casting an eye on her,
for fear she should have rushed on me
with a penknife; for I have not the least
doubt, if she had had such an instrument
about her, she would have made an attempt
that might have given a very  tragical
turn to my adventures.
</p>
<p>When she had done sobbing, I addressed
her in a very stern voice; for I found I
had no baby to deal with, and therefore
resolved to frighten her into submission.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I told you before, madam, that violence
would be of no use to you: your menaces
I laugh at; you are in my power intirely,

<pb n="134"/>
and absolutely at my disposal: to think of
getting out of my hands would be vain;
for it is as impracticable as flying.  No
mortal knows where you are but the people
of this house, who are strangers to
your name and circumstances; and if they
knew both, they are so totally at my devotion,
that it would not avail you.  I
shall cut off all possibility of a correspondence
to England.  What then must be
your resource?  I am prepared against all
events; and I would carry you about
locked up in an iron cage, like a Turkish
tyrant, till I had subdued that termagant
spirit, sooner than you should have
your liberty to do more mischief.  If you
have any regard to your own interest, you
will endeavour to make me your friend:
I have the power and the will to serve you,
I have done you no injury; I said I would
be your protector; and so I will, if you
will suffer me to be so.  I said I would be
the means of your passing your days in a
state more eligible to a woman of either
spirit, discretion, or a grain of honour,
than you have hitherto done.  This I am

<pb n="135"/>
ready to make good, if you will not be
wanting on your part to your own happiness.
You have acknowledged that you
are conscious of your errors, are sorry for
them, and are willing to quit them (this
was turning her own weapons against herself);
if you are in earnest in this declaration,
I will give you the means of quitting
them.  The money you have now in
your possession, even with the addition of
your little jointure, is not sufficient to promise
you such a support as would make
you easy, if you were to return to England
to-morrow; and your story known
(as it would be) what could you expect?
Do you think Arnold could be so besotted
as to receive you again?  What must be
your resource?  Why, to continue, while
your beauty lasts, in a wretched abandoned
course.  Ten thousand to one you
might never light on another whose love
would be prodigal enough to enrich you.
The only choice left you is, to stay where
you are not known, and where, if you
behave well, you may gain the respect and
esteem which you could never hope for in

<pb n="136"/>
a place where your history is known.  If
you will content yourself with an easy fortune,
joined to a life of virtue and tranquillity,
I will provide you with a husband
that many a woman in your circumstances
would bless her stars for: I will
double the portion you have already, and
get it settled on you; and will, on certain
conditions, add a handsome yearly income.
If you do not like this proposal, I have
no other alternative to offer but a nunnery.
I know you were bred a Roman
Catholic: I am sure therefore I shall do
no violence to your religious scruples, if
you have any.  I can get you admitted
with ease: the religious here will think it
a meritorious act in me, especially on the
terms I shall propose; for I will make it
worth their while to receive and treat you
as a lady of the first family in France:
but remember there is a final period to all
intercourse with this world.  If you think
you can bring yourself to submit to such a
life, I would really recommend it to you;
for I am solicitous for your happiness
both here and hereafter: if not, you have

<pb n="137"/>
the other choice to make; and so, madam,
a husband or a convent; take which
you like best: I give you three days to
consider of it.
</p>
<p>I kept up a severe countenance, and a
resolute tone.  I rang the bell as soon as
I had done speaking.  Rachael came in
before Mrs. Gerrarde could answer me.
Take care of your mistress, said I, and
left the room without even the ceremony
of a bow, or deigning to look at her.  I
locked the chamber-door, which I took
care to slap after me; and, putting the
key in my pocket, left the lady and her
maid to consult at their leisure.
</p>
<p>You know, Bidulph, I am not naturally
morose; and that I am not very apt
to be wanting in that complaisance which
all women expect, and which I really think
due to <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> all women: but this one had,
in the preceding scene, so intirely thrown
off her sex, that I could hardly consider
her as a female.  I had known many of
her ill qualities before; but those she now
discovered, if they did not shew her more
wicked, certainly rendered her more disgustful

<pb n="138"/>
to me than the others.  I short, I
found that all decorum was to be laid
aside: I had gone too far not to put the
finishing hand to my work; and I had no
other measure to observe, but to finish
by dint of force what I had begun by
stratagem.  When I mentioned the nunnery
to you in a former letter, it was in
mere gaiety of heart; I had no serious
thoughts of that kind, nor did I now propose
it as a practicable scheme.  I knew
the woman too well to suppose she would
acquiesce; though, to confess the truth to
you honestly, I think, if she refuses my
other plan of accommodation, I must
compel her to accept of this: nor ought
it to be considered in any other light than
that of confining a wild beast, who, having
already done a great deal of mischief,
would still do more, if left at liberty:
but I think I shall not be driven to this.
I believe she will accept of a husband with
a good settlement, sooner than resign her
liberty.
</p>
<p>And now who do you think the husband
is whom I have under contemplation for

<pb n="139"/>
her?  Why, no less a man than my valet
de chambre Monsieur Pivet.  He is young
and handsome, of good parts, and a man
of birth.  He tells me he has an uncle
that is a marquis, and three or four cousins
that are in the high court of parliament.
Without a joke, the fellow is of
a pretty good family: he was bred a mercer,
and in a frolic had run away from
his business, when I picked him up at
Paris, at the time you and I were there
together.  He then told me, that he only
hired with me for an opportunity of seeing
a little of the world, and that he
would one time or other sit down and settle
to his trade.  I have sounded him on the
point in hand, and find him very ready
to accept of the lady with all her faults.
</p>
<p>I told you I had introduced him to
Mrs. Gerrarde, to serve as her interpreter
in the house, at the time I was ill.  I did
not then tell her who he was; and both
she and her maid take him for no other
than an acquaintance of mine, who happens
to lodge in the same house with
us.  The vain rogue has encouraged

<pb n="140"/>
this opinion, and I suppose passes for a
very pretty fellow with them; for you
know Pivet is a beau, and is really not
ungenteel.  But do not fansy that I intend
to impose him on the lady for any
other than what he really is.  All disguise
is now laid aside, and I shall proceed with
the utmost plainness and sincerity, as soon
as I know the lady's mind in regard to
her choice.
</p>
<p>Here, my dear Sir George, I must take
breath a little: it has been a busy day.  I
undertook a difficult voyage without the
certainty of a landing-place; a few storms
I expected to encounter; I hope I have
weathered the worst, and have come at
length to some prospect of an harbour.  I
expect my next greeting to you will be
from a fairer shore.&mdash;Upon second
thoughts, I will not send this off, till I
can put both you and myself out of the
reach of suspence. . . . . . . .
</p>
<p>Congratulate me, Sir George, honour
me, as the first of politicians, the greatest
of negociators!  Let no hero of romance
compare himself to me, for first making

<pb n="141"/>
difficulties, and then extricating myself
out of them; let no giant pretend to equal
me in the management of captive beauties
in inchanted castles; let no necromancer
presume to view with me in skill
for metamorphosing tigresses into doves,
and changing imperious princesses into
plain country nymphs!  <hi rend="italic">All</hi> this have I
brought to pass, without the assistance of
inchanted sword or dwarf, in the compass
of a few days; but take the circumstances
in the order they occurred.
</p>
<p>I left the lady, as I told you, to utter
her complaints to her confidante.  Rachael,
a simple girl, who had just sense
enough to regard her own interest, was
not likely to give her mistress much consolation;
for she was at least as much <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
friend as her's.  How <hi rend="italic">they</hi> passed the night
I know not; for my own part, I slept in
perfect tranquillity.  I desired Pivet in the
morning to go and inquire, as from himself,
how the lady rested.  Mrs. Gerrarde,
who was still in bed, no sooner heard his
voice in the outer room, as he was speaking
to her maid, than she called out to

<pb n="142"/>
Monsieur Pivet, and desired he would be
so good as to step into her chamber.  Pivet,
not much abashed at being admitted
to a lady's <hi rend="italic">r&uuml;elle</hi>, obeyed her summons,
and placed himself in an armed chair by
her.  He said he hoped it was not owing
to illness that he saw her in bed.  Yes,
Sir, said she, I am exceedingly ill: I have
not slept the whole night, and am now in
a high fever.  Has Mr. Faulkland told
you any thing in relation to me?  I had
prepared Pivet, and he had his answers
ready.  Madam, said he, I am not a
stranger to your situation, and am exceedingly
sorry for it: I wish the little influence
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> have over Mr. Faulkland could
be employed for your service; but he is
a positive man, very enterprising, and not
to be controlled by any-body.  Do you
know my story, Sir? cried Mrs. Gerrarde.
He bowed, and looked down.  Mrs. Gerrarde
understanding this as an affirmative,
and raising herself up a little, cried out,
A base, ungenerous man!  Does he intend
to expose me wherever he goes?  By
no means, madam, answered Pivet: there

<pb n="143"/>
is nothing in your story that would do you
the least injury in any body's opinion here:
the ladies in France to not think it any
disgrace to have lovers.
</p>
<p>You are very obliging, Sir, she replied;
and perhaps I have as much to say in my
vindication as any woman: but sure never
was mortal used in the barbarous manner
I am.  Do you know the proposal he had
the insolence to make me last night?  Either
to take a husband of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> choosing (<hi rend="italic">any</hi> low
fellow, I suppose, he thinks good enough
for me) or immediately to go into a nunnery.
Oh, Sir! and she catched hold of
his hand, as you are a gentleman, if you
have compassion, any humanity towards
an unfortunate woman, try to deliver me
out of his hands.  I have a pretty good
sum of money in my possession; contrive
the means of my escape; my gratitude to
you shall be unbounded! and she wrung
his hand.
</p>
<p>Ah, madam! said Pivet, looking tenderly
at her, I would it were in my power;
I should think myself but too happy if it
were possible for me to accomplish what

<pb n="144"/>
you request; but I fear it will be impracticable:
I declare to you, if I were at my
own disposal, I would fly with you to the
remotest part of the world; but I am a
young man, who have my fortune to
make: I am under particular ties here,
and have besides such obligations to Mr.
Faulkland, as makes it impossible for me,
consistently with <hi rend="italic">honour</hi>, to interfere in
this business.
</p>
<p>Sir, said she, eagerly, can't you write a
letter for me, or furnish me with the means
of informing my friends in England of
my situation?
</p>
<p>Madam, said he, before Mr. Faulkland
permitted me the honour of seeing you, he
engaged my solemn promise that I would
not intermeddle in your affairs.
</p>
<p>Lord, what will become of me!  What
would you, Sir, advise me to do?  For as
for that wretch (meaning me) I am determined,
if I can help it, not to suffer
him to come near me.
</p>
<p>'Tis a very nice point, madam: I really
do not well know how to advise: but, to
be sure, a nunnery is a choice not to be

<pb n="145"/>
recommended to a lady of your youth and
beauty, unless your inclinations lead you
that way; then indeed&mdash;
</p>
<p>She interrupted him.  Don't name it
to me Sir; don't  name it: I am determined
to keep out of <hi rend="italic">that</hi> snare, if it be for
nothing but an opportunity to be revenged
on that tyrant: I would marry a beggar
sooner than give up that hope.
</p>
<p>As for that, madam, said Pivet, I suppose
Mr. Faulkland would not be so ungenerous
as to compel you to marry one
beneath you: there are many young men
of good families who would think themselves
honoured by your acceptance of
them: your personal accomplishments
alone are a sufficient recommendation;
but Mr. Faulkland mentioned to me the
additional advantage of fortune.  I dare
answer for him he will not think of bestowing
you unworthily.
</p>
<p>I had charged Pivet not to go too far:
he thought it time to break off the conversation;
and, rising up, he told Mrs. Gerrarde
he was going into my apartments,
and desired to know if she would honour
him with any commands.

<pb n="146"/>
</p>
<p>Sir, said she, I shall only beg you will
tell Mr. Faulkland, that I never <hi rend="italic">can</hi> think
of his proposal; that I am very ill, and
beg to be left in quiet for a few days;
but shall be very glad to see <hi rend="italic">you</hi> whenever
you are at leisure.
</p>
<p>He bowed, and left her; then came directly
to me, and repeated the conversation
he had with her word for word.  I am
glad, said I, to find you are so much in
her good graces: it will accelerate my
plot; but we must not make you too
cheap: if we manage discreetly, she may
possibly think herself very well off to get
you.
</p>
<p>At present I stand pretty well with her,
Sir, said Pivet: she does not suspect that
I am your servant: I fear, if she did, as
the lady seems to have a high spirit, she
would forbid me her presence.
</p>
<p>I found Pivet had no mind to have this
part of his situation explained: his vanity
had been highly tickled at passing upon
her for a gentleman and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> friend.&mdash;He
has, in obedience to my orders, spent
much of his time with her during the few
days that I had been too ill to see her.  I

<pb n="147"/>
had, at my first introduction of him to her,
cautioned him against letting her know in
what capacity he was with me: I did not
then give him my reasons for this, and he
supposed they were no other, than that,
finding it necessary to have him pretty
much with her in her confinement, I did
not choose to alarm her pride by the knowlege
of his station.  I did not hint at my
design till the day before I had prevailed
on her to write the letter to Mr. Arnold.
Pivet did not at all disrelish the proposal:
he had not been blind to Mrs. Gerrarde's
charms: he only seemed surprized at my
being willing to part with her so soon; for
he had not the least conception of my reasons
for carrying her off, and very naturally
concluded I was deeply engaged in
an amour.  It was not difficult to guess
his thoughts on this occasion.
</p>
<p>Pivet, said I, I must premise one thing
to you: I assure you there is not, nor ever
was, any intrigue between Mrs. Gerrarde
and me.  I do not, however, pretend to
vouch for her chastity.  It was no secret
at V&mdash;hall that she had occasioned an unhappy

<pb n="148"/>
breach in Mr. Arnold's family; and
that, and that <hi rend="italic">only</hi> (as I have a most particular
value and affection for that family)
was my motive to the carrying this lady
away.  As I hope the disunion (now the
cause of it is removed) will no longer
subsist, I find it necessary to provide for
Mrs. Gerrarde some way or other.  A good
husband I would wish to bestow on her.
I do not yet know whether I shall be able
to bring her into any measures; but if
she should be prevailed on to accept of
you, and I should make it worth your
while to accept of her, can you overlook
the levity she has been guilty of, and resolve
to use her kindly?
</p>
<p>He promised he would make the best
husband in the universe.  I bid him not
be too sure of success, as I did not yet
know Mrs. Gerrarde's mind, and feared I
should find it hard to bring her into terms;
adding, that though I intended to threaten
her, I should be very unwilling to make
use of compulsion; but if she should happen
to like him, without suspecting my design,
I might accomplish my purpose with

<pb n="149"/>
less reluctance on her side, and much more
satisfaction to myself.
</p>
<p>The conversation he had just had with
her elated him highly: she had made him
her confidant; she had implored his assistance;
she had promised an <hi rend="italic">unbounded</hi>
gratitude; she had prohibited <hi rend="italic">my</hi> visits, and
invited <hi rend="italic">his</hi>.  All this facilitated my work,
and I at one time thought of letting her
e'en work out her fate, and run blindfold
into my trap; for it is plain, if Pivet had
given into it, she would have marched off
with him, and even married him, to get
out of my clutches; and then, you know,
she could have blamed nobody but herself
for the consequences.  But I resolved not
to impose on the gipsey any farther; but
let her know what she was to expect before
the bargain was concluded, and at
least give her her option of having the
power of continuing a jilt, or being canonized
for a saint.
</p>
<p>I found things were now likely to take
such a turn as I wished; but it still required
management.  Pivet, said I, you
must let her see you no more to-day; it

<pb n="150"/>
will make her prize your company the
more: keep out of the way that you
may not be seen by Rachael; and give
such orders in the house, as that there may
be proper attendance for the lady.  One
of my footmen spoke a little French, and
he had been directed to receive and communicate
Mrs. Rachael's orders in the family.
</p>
<p>Tho' Pivet assured me that he though
Mrs. Gerrarde was not so ill as she said
she was, I yet thought it incumbent on
me to have the advice of a physician.
The people with whom I lodged said I
could not have a better than the doctor
who had attended me, as he was reckoned
very skilful.  I told them, in the present
case, I believed honesty was more requisite
than skill.  They said he was very honest
too; so I desired he might be sent
for.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde, being determined to
carry on the farce of sickness, pretended
she was not able to rise; and the doctor
was introduced to her bedside.  As he
could neither understand his patient, nor

<pb n="151"/>
make himself understood by her, I had
ordered the Footman, whom I mentioned
to you before, as knowing a little French,
to wait at the chamber-door; for I was
resolved so far to keep up my resentment
and my importance, as not to vouchsafe
assisting at the conference; which, by
this means, became the most ridiculous
scene you can imagine.  The doctor, having
felt Mrs. Gerrarde's pulse, proposed
his questions by the footman, who just
peeped his nose in at the door.  He explained
them (very ill I suppose) to Rachael
in English, who repeated them to
her lady within her curtains; for she
would not suffer them to be drawn back.
Mrs. Gerrarde's answers travelled the same
round-about way back to the doctor, who
got them mangled in very bad French
from his interpreter.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde, provoked, I believe, at
the doctor's visit, and very much tired of
his questions, asked peevishly where Monsieur
Pivet was?  This inquiry I expected;
and the fellow who told me of it, had
been ordered to inform her that Monsieur
Pivet was not at home.

<pb n="152"/>
</p>
<p>The doctor, after leaving his patient,
came to me, and confirmed the character
I had received of him, both for skill in
his profession, and integrity in his practice;
for he told me very honestly, that
he thought the lady was in perfect health.
I thought the doctor deserved a double
fee, and accordingly gave it to him; requesting
him, however, to continue his
visits: for I told him, that, though the
lady might really be very well, she was,
however, a little vapourish.
</p>
<p>I left her to her reflections the whole day.
Rachael inquired three or four times of the
footman if Mr. Pivet was come in, but was
always answered in the negative.  I was
pleased at her solicitude about him.
</p>
<p>I desired him to wait on her the next
day at the time the doctor paid his visit;
and instructed pivet to ask the doctor, in
her presence, what he thought of her case,
and to report his answer fairly to her; for
I was resolved not to let her imagine that
she imposed on me.
</p>
<p>The doctor, by Pivet's means, discoursed
with her more readily than he had done
the day before.  Pivet asked his opinion

<pb n="153"/>
of her disorder, and the physician declared
it as freely as he had done to me; adding,
he should not have repeated his visit, if I
had not insisted on it.
</p>
<p>Pivet could not help smiling.  Mrs.
Gerrarde observed it; for I suppose, she
watched his countenance, and asked him
what the doctor had said.  He says, madam,
what gives me a vast deal of pleasure;
which is, that your disorder is intirely
imaginary.  He is an ignorant fellow,
said Mrs. Gerrarde; and you may
tell him I desire to see him no more.  The
poor doctor, who knew not what she said,
made her half a dozen scrapes, and withdrew.
</p>
<p>She then threw back her curtain; and
re-assuming the subject she had been upon
the day before with Pivet, asked him if he
had had any conversation with me about
her, and what resolution I had come to.
</p>
<p>Pivet (who had begged I would leave
this conference intirely to his management)
seemed to hesitate a little, and appeared
melancholy.  We have had some talk
about you, madam, said he; and Mr.

<pb n="154"/>
Faulkland tells me, if you reject the nunnery
scheme (which I think <hi rend="italic">he</hi> seems to be
fondest of) that he has a person in his
thoughts, who, he believes, will be a suitable
match for you, if you are willing to
accept of him; if not&mdash;here he stopped.
What if I should not, Sir?  Pray speak.  I
hope, madam, he will not carry matters
to an extremity.  Extremity, Sir!  Do
you think he can be brutal enough to
force me into a nunnery?  Are there no
laws in France?  I <hi rend="italic">hope</hi> he will not, madam;
but I can't pretend to answer for
him: he is a strange man: he seems out
of temper too: the doctor told him nothing
ailed you; he believes him, and
spoke harshly on the occasion.  And what
said she, is the match that he calls <hi rend="italic">suitable</hi>?
One of his footmen perhaps, or his barber?
</p>
<p>Pivet affected to look concerned.  He
tells me, madam, he has cast his eyes on
a young man, well born, and genteelly
educated; not contemptible in his personal
accomplishments, and one who he is
sure will make you a fond and obliging
husband.

<pb n="155"/>
</p>
<p>Pivet sighed deeply, and cast his eyes
languishingly on her.  You seem concerned,
Sir, said she.  Do you know the person?
It is my doubts on that occasion,
madam, that is the cause of my uneasiness.
Pray explain yourself, Mr. Pivet.
Madam, I dare not, he replied, with great
solemnity.  I will only assure you, that
whoever the person be, whom Mr. Faulkland
has not yet named to me, I think
him the happiest man in the world.  What
can be this meaning, asked Mrs. Gerrarde,
for telling <hi rend="italic">you</hi> so much, and yet concealing
the person's name?  He says, he has
not proposed it yet to the gentleman,
madam; and, as he tells me, he can't in
honour conceal any part of your story, he
is fearful&mdash;I beg your pardon, madam;
you will excuse, me if I do not repeat his
scruples on this occasion.  I understand
you, Sir.  He supposes his friend will reject
me.  Some such insinuation he threw
out, madam, said Pivet.  I told him, that
he need only permit the gentleman to <hi rend="italic">see</hi>
you; and if he then made any objection,
he must be the blindest and most insensible

<pb n="156"/>
man alive.  He spoke this with a
warmth that seemed highly pleasing to the
lady.  She bowed, and answered, <hi rend="italic">All</hi> men,
Sir, are not as generous as you.  But
what did Mr. Faulkland say to this?  He
only smiled, and said he wished his friend
might think as I did; that he would tell
me his name another time; and that, in
the mean time, it would oblige him if my
visits to you were less frequent.  Inhuman
monster! said she; would he debar me of
the only satisfaction I have?  Let me but
live to get out of his hands! if I can escape
him by any means, I will find ways
to reckon with him for this.  Be so good,
Mr. Pivet, to tell him, that I am content
to take the person he offers, let him be
who he will: I expect nothing from him
but insults; therefore shall not be surprized
if I see myself sacrificed to some despicable
wretch: but any, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> thing is better
than to be in the power of such a tyrant!
Madam, answered Pivet, you need not
fear the being compelled to accept of an
unworthy object: Mr. Faulkland declares,
that if you should absolutely dislike the

<pb n="157"/>
gentleman, when you see him, he will be
far from constraining you to take him for
your husband.  The other choice is still
open to you, and, by what I can judge,
Mr. Faulkland seems to wish you would
give that the preference.  I would die
first, cried Mrs. Gerrarde.&mdash;The fool,
does he think I can be so entrapped?  No,
no; the authority of a husband, even of
Faulkland's choosing, cannot be such a
bar to my revenge as the walls of a nunnery
would be.&mdash;Sir, I think myself
obliged to you, and flatter myself you
would have served me if yo could.  I
may yet have it in my power to make
you a return for your kind intentions towards
me.  I presume, when Mr. Faulkland
has disposed of his property, you
will then be absolved of your promise to
him in regard to me, and will still have
charity enough to befriend an unfortunate
woman.  She wept, and Pivet owned he
was ready to do so too, but constraining
himself, protested she should command
his life, and withdrew full of seeming
uneasiness.

<pb n="158"/>
</p>
<p>He told me what had passed between
him and the lady, and I could not help
approving his management of this scene,
though the rogue had stretched beyond
the truth; but stratagems, you know,
are allowable in love, and a lover he was
now become in good earnest.
</p>
<p>He had taken care to alarm Mrs. Gerrarde's
apprehensions at every passage of
access.  He had informed her, that I had
a husband for her in my thoughts; and
at the same time, that he avoided the
most distant hint of its being himself, he
engaged her favour by seeming to wish it
<hi rend="italic">were</hi>.  Then he took care to insinuate, at
least, a possibility of her being refused by
the person designed for her, and this he
very naturally supposed would raise his
own consequence with her in case any
suspicion should fall on him of his being
the intended husband.  He pretended I
had taken umbrage at his visiting her,
still more to enflame her resentment
against me, and increase her impatience to
deliver herself out of my hands; at the
same time he artfully hinted that he was

<pb n="159"/>
not the man destined to be happy.  This,
as he saw already he was not unacceptable
to her, he thought would make him
doubly welcome when she should find
herself no worse off.  Then the nunnery
was mentioned, in terrorem, with broad
hints of my resolution.  In short, Pivet
played his part so cunningly, that it had
all the effect he could have wished; and
Mrs. Gerrarde, finding her spirit matched,
was obliged to surrender at discretion.
</p>
<p>I own I did not expect to have succeeded
so soon; and without Pivet, who had
now a feeling in the affair, I certainly
should not.  I resolved directly to make
the best use of the advantage I had gained.
I told Pivet that he should be married
the next day.  He was so transported
at the thought, that he begged I would
give him leave to go to Mrs. Gerrarde
to declare his love and his good fortune
together; for, Sir, said he, you know she
promises to accept of whomsoever you
propose, and I hope she will not despise
your choice so much as she thinks she shall.
Softly, softly, good Monsieur Pivot, your

<pb n="160"/>
violent hurry will spoil all.  I do not
mean that you shall see her till to morrow.
Not till to-morrow!  Ah, Sir! do,
I beseech you, Sir, allow me; she will
think it very cruel.  (Poor Pivet, thought
I, thou wilt have enough of her.)  Simpleton
(to him) this day's suspence will forward
your business more than all you
could say to her in seven hours: is it not
enough you are sure of her?  We have
other things now to mind.  What plan
of life do you propose to pursue?  You
know I have promised to do handsomely
for you.
</p>
<p>Sir, said he, I always intended to follow
the business I was bred to; and if this
piece of extraordinary good fortune had
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> happened to me, I did purpose, tho'
you have been the best of masters to me,
to have asked your permission to return to
my friends, in order to settle in my trade,
as I have some capital of my own.  But
to be sure, Sir, I shall be directed in this,
as in every thing else, by your will and
pleasure.  I approve of your design intirely,
said I; but there are certain conditions

<pb n="161"/>
that must be previously settled between
you and me.  In the first place,
tell me honestly, what is the capital you
say you are worth.
</p>
<p>He answered, his father had left him
about eight thousand livres, which were
in the hands of a banker in Paris, whom
he named to me, and referred me to him
for confirmation of the truth of what he
told me.
</p>
<p>Well, said I, this will go a good way
towards setting you up in your own business.
Where do you think of settling?
</p>
<p>He answered, Paris was the best place
for his trade.
</p>
<p>On that I put an absolute negative; I
said Paris was too much frequented by
my countrymen to be a proper place for
Mrs. Gerrarde to make her appearance
in, as she was likely to meet there with
more of her acquaintance than might be
convenient: I told him I had not objection
to any other large provincial town.
</p>
<p>He said he was born at Dijon, and
should like to go thither, as he had many
friends there.

<pb n="162"/>
</p>
<p>Be it so, said I: What I purpose doing
for you is this.  Mrs. Gerrarde has
eight hundred pounds of her own; I
will ad as much more to it, for which
I will give you my bond, till I can have
the money remitted from England; and
this you shall settle on her, that she may
be sure of a support in case of your death,
and the interest you shall allow her for
her own separate use, but without her
knowing that you are tied down to it,
that you may have it in your power to
oblige her.
</p>
<p>He made no reply, but acquiesced with
a low bow.
</p>
<p>I laughed at the simplicity of his countenance.
Pivet, said I, though I have
taken care of Mrs. Gerrarde's interest, I
do not intend to neglect yours, provided
you make no demur to the terms.  You
already know my reasons for proceeding
as I have done in this affair.  I have great
cause to apprehend Mrs. Gerrarde's vindictive
spirit, if she should find means,
which I know she will endeavour at, to
lay open the real state of this transaction

<pb n="163"/>
to some people in England.  This might
frustrate all that I have been at so much
pains to accomplish; be it your care then
to prevent it.  I cannot wish you to use
harsh measures with your wife; but if
you have address enough to prevent a
correspondence with any one in England
(an elopement, for both your sakes, I am
not willing to suppose; though I think,
for some time at least, you must keep a
strict eye over her) if, as I said, you can
prevent correspondence, I think it will
answer my purpose; and that I may make
it your interest to do this, I will bind
myself, by as strong an obligation as the
law can make, to pay you two hundred
pounds a year English, so long as you
keep your wife within the bounds prescribed;
provided, if after three years, I
find those terms no longer necessary, they
shall, if I then choose it, become void.  I
shall also add something to enable you to
fit up a house and a shop, that you need
not be under a necessity of breaking in
upon your capital.
</p>
<p>Pivet's gratitude overflowed at his lips

<pb n="164"/>
for this (as he called it) noble provision.
He said, he made no doubt of gaining
so fat upon Mrs. Gerrarde's affections, as
to be able effectually to fulfil his covenant
without using violent methods; but, said
he, at all events, I warrant you shall
hear no more of her.
</p>
<p>Preliminaries thus adjusted, I sent for
a notary of reputation, to whom I gave
instructions to draw up two separate articles
for the purposes mentioned; the
latter was to be a secret between Pivet
and me, as it was by no means proper
for Mrs. Gerrarde to be let into it.  The
other, which regarded her own particular
settlement, was intended for her perusal
and approbation.  I charged the notary
to use dispatch, and he promised to have
both the papers ready by next morning,
as also the bond which I was to give
Pivet for the payment of eight hundred
pounds.
</p>
<p>The lawyer brought the papers according
to his promise, and they were signed,
sealed, and delivered in due form.  That
which was to be the private agreement

<pb n="165"/>
between Pivet and me, was worded in
consequence of an article which I drew
up myself, and made Pivet sign; wherein
I set forth particulars at large.
</p>
<p>Pivet was very impatient to see his beloved,
but a little uneasy lest she should
come to know the situation he had been
in.  I bid not be discouraged, telling
him I should set off that circumstance of
his having been my gentleman (for so I
chose to call him) in the most favourable
light.  I presented him with a very elegant
suit of cloaths, which I had never
worn, and which fitted him very well, as
you know he is nearly of my size.  You
cannot imagine how handsome the fellow
looked when he was dressed, for he had
linen and every thing else suitable to his
cloaths.
</p>
<p>I then desired him to wait on his goddess;
but he, who had been so eager a
little before, was now quite abashed at
the thoughts of making his pretensions
known to the lady, and intreated me to
present him to her.  I saw he was quite

<pb n="166"/>
disconcerted at the serious scene he was
going to engage n.
</p>
<p>I pitied him, and told him I would go
with him to Mrs. Gerrarde; but that it
was proper first to prepare her a little.
</p>
<p>He said he thought so too.
</p>
<p>I immediately sent for Rachael, and
speaking to her at the door, without letting
her see Pivet, I bid her tell her mistress
that I purposed making her a visit
in half an hour, and should introduce the
gentleman, whom I expected she would,
according to her promise, receive at my
hands for her husband; reserving to herself
still the liberty of choosing the other
alternative, in case she disliked him.
</p>
<p>Pivet shewed the solicitude of a lover
after this message was sent to his mistress;
Poor dear lady, said he, how I pity her!
What must she suffer in this interval!
But your presence, Monsieur Pivet, said
I, will dispel all her fears, and make her
the happiest of women.
</p>
<p>The poor fellow was out of countenance,
and I dare say as anxious as Mrs.
Gerrarde.

<pb n="167"/>
</p>
<p>As I received no answer form her to
my message, I construed her silence as
leave to attend her; and accordingly, at
the appointed time, I entered her apartment,
leading Pivet by the hand.
</p>
<p>She was sitting at a table, leaning her
head on one of her hands; she cast a
look of scorn at me, and immediately
withdrew her eyes, not so much as deigning
to glance them at Pivet, little imaginning
that it was <hi rend="italic">he</hi> who accompanied
me, though she knew it was her intended
bridegroom.
</p>
<p>Pivet was not able to speak; he trembled,
and, like a true inamorato, ran to
her, clapt one knee to the ground, and
ventured, though with great diffidence,
to take one of her hands.
</p>
<p>This action obliged the haughty fair
one to vouchsafe him a glance of her
eye.
</p>
<p>Her surprize, spite of her assumed
airs of grandeur, was not to be concealed;
it was apparent, she coloured, and
though she intended to have been solemn
and lofty, she even <hi rend="italic">stared</hi>; and I could

<pb n="168"/>
discover a little gleam of pleasure dance
over her countenance.
</p>
<p>What! Monsieur Pivet?  And then she
looked at me, as if for an explanation.
</p>
<p>Yes, madam, said I, Monsieur Pivet
<hi rend="italic">is</hi> the man.  (I was going to say the <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>
man, but I did not meant to compliment
her; my business was to make her think I
was doing her a favour.)  It has been your
good fortune to make a conquest of him;
and in the hope of your making him a
good wife, as I am sure he will make you
a good husband, I have consented to the
match; and I spoke this in the tone of one,
who thinking he has conferred a great
obligation on an undeserving object, expects
to be thanked for it.
</p>
<p>The woman, with all her art and assurance
to boot, was quite confounded.
I did not give her time to recover herself,
but taking the settlement out of my
pocket, and reading it to her, Look there,
madam, and see if I have injured you in
the disposal of your person and your fortune.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde, always alert when her

<pb n="169"/>
interest was in the question, took the paper,
and, notwithstanding her confusion,
read it intirely out.  Pivet's handsome
appearance, joined to her former prepossessions,
had made so good an impression
on her, that she began to think the matter
worth attending to.  When she had
read the paper, she put it into Pivet's
hands.  Sir, said she, it should appear by
this that you have acted generously; but
as I have already been imposed upon by
that gentleman (looking at me) all this
may, for aught I know, be a deceit; but
as it is not in my power to make terms
for myself, it is to no purpose for me to
make objections, or to inquire any farther.
I am ready to accept your offer,
only I should be glad to know who the
man really is, that I am to make my
husband.
</p>
<p>She spoke this with such an air of disdain,
that the poor lover, shrunk up and
diminished in his own eyes, left me to
make an answer.  Mrs. Gerrarde, said I,
I declare to you solemnly that there is
no deception in any thing which you see,

<pb n="170"/>
nor any foul play meant to you.  This
young man, whom I now present to you
for your husband, is well born, and has
many genteel relations in this country;
he has it in his power, to my certain
knowlege, to make good the settlement
he proposes for you, which I will take
care to see properly secured.  That part
of it which is your own property, you
have now in your possession, the other
half I know is in his.  He was brought
up to a creditable business, which he intends
to follow.  I know him to be good-natured, and of an obliging temper.  He
lived with me some time, and accompanied
me in my travels.  I suppose his
having been my gentleman, which station
he did not accept through necessity, will
not be a material objection (and I smiled
and affected to look very proud) and I
only mention it to convince you that I
have no design of deceiving you, or concealing
any part of his character.
</p>
<p>Pivet coloured (for I stole a side glance
at him) and looked sheepish.  He began
an aukward compliment with a bow, and

<pb n="171"/>
'I hope, madam'&mdash;but I relieved him;
and speaking to Mrs. Gerrarde, You know
all now, madam, that can be known;
therefore, if you are disposed to keep your
word, let us put an end to this business
to-day.  To-day, Sir!  Yes, to-day, madam.
What occasion is there for farther
delay.
</p>
<p>Pivet now plucked up his courage, and
begged, since she had consented, that she
would not defer his happiness.  I told
her, between mirth and chiding, that I
was in haste to get rid of my charge, and
was therefore determined to make her
over to Mr. Pivet that evening; and telling
her I would give orders about the
ceremony, left the lovers to make out for
themselves a scheme of conjugal felicity.
Pivet pleaded his own cause so effectually,
that, in the evening, I had the satisfaction
of bestowing with my own hand, that
inestimable treasure of virtue and meekness,
Mrs. Gerrarde, on my faithful
'squire, Monsieur Pivet; to the no small
joy of the latter, and I believe, if the
truth were known, to the no great mortification

<pb n="172"/>
of the former.  Mrs. Rachael
and myself were the only witnesses of this
illustrious union.
</p>
<p>When the ceremony was over, I approached,
according to custom, to congratulate
and salute the bride; but she
turned her saucy cheek to me, and affected
the whole night vast dignity of behaviour;
yet it was so foreign to her nature,
that it appeared ridiculous; however
it was better than ranting.
</p>
<p>I invited them both to sup with me,
and treated Pivet with a familiar civility
that seemed to please him highly, as it
did him credit in the presence of his
lady.
</p>
<p>After supper, Pivet entreated me to
complete the friendly and generous offices
I had already done him, by undertaking
the settlement of all money matters for
him.  As he knew I intended to go to
Paris, he begged I would receive for him
the sum he had in the hands of the banker,
which, he said, if I would remit to him,
it would enable him to enter upon his
business immediately.  At the same time

<pb n="173"/>
he (with no ill grace) presented me my
bond again, assuring me he relied intirely
upon my honour for the execution of my
promise to him, farther requesting that
I would put that, together with Mrs.
Gerrarde's money, if she approved of it,
into such hands as I should judge most
proper for her advantage.
</p>
<p>I was pleased at the openness of his
proceedings, and promised to do every
thing for their mutual satisfaction; but insisted
on his keeping the bond, or lodging
it in some proper hand, till I could redeem
it, by paying the money, which I
should take care should be speedily done.
I told him, I thought the sooner he set
out for his own province the better.  He
said, he should be ready the next day, if
Mrs. Gerrarde (for he did not yet presume
to call her by his own name) did
not object to it.  He appealed to her
with his looks.
</p>
<p>She had scarce condescended to open
her lips before; but now answered, You
may be sure, Sir, I shall not think it too
soon to get out of a prison.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="174"/>
</p>
<p>He asked her if she chose to take her
maid Rachael along with her?
</p>
<p>Certainly, she said; I should not be
fond of having a servant about me, by
whom I should not be understood.
</p>
<p>Rachael was now called in, and the
thing proposed to her.  She seemed rather
inclined to return to England; but I told
her, she could not, in gratitude, desert
her lady in a strange country; and that
if she had a mind to make me her friend,
which she should find me upon any future
occasion, she would attend her home,
and continue with her till her mistress was
willing to part with her.
</p>
<p>The girl upon this consented to stay,
and received Mrs. Gerrarde's orders to prepare
for their departure the next day.
</p>
<p>In the morning I made Pivet a present
for his travelling charges, and Rachael another;
telling her, according to the account
I should have of her behaviour, that
I would be kind to her.  She made me all
the promises that I could desire; assuring
me, that it was purely to oblige me that
she staid with Mrs. Gerrarde.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="175"/>
</p>
<p>Pivet told me, that he would send the
sum which his wife had, in bills to me,
to be appropriated in the manner agreed
on: for he said, that having that morning
mentioned to her my generosity, in
relation to the bond, she had owned, that,
notwithstanding her resentment to me, she
had no distrust of my honour in <hi rend="italic">those</hi> particulars.
</p>
<p>I took this opportunity of telling Pivet,
that when he could get his wife in the humour,
he might prevail on her to give an
instrument, impowering my steward to receive
the little income of her jointure at
Ashby, which I would take care should
be remitted to him; for, trifling as it was,
it might be serviceable.
</p>
<p>When they were ready to set forward
on their journey, I begged leave to speak
a few words to madam Pivet by herself.
She seemed no inclined to the conference,
but her husband very obligingly
pressing her not to part with me in enmity,
and at the same time quitting the
room, she was obliged to hear me.
</p>
<p>I then very frankly asked her pardon

<pb n="176"/>
for the lengths I had gone; telling her
that I hoped time, and her own good
sense, would convince her that she was
more obliged to me, than her passion
would then give her leave to see.  Remember,
madam, I have kept my word
with you.  You are now married to a
very deserving young man; you have a
competent support during your life.  Happiness
is in your power, if you do not
wilfully cast it away from you.  Shew
now that greatness of mind of which you
have so often boasted, by forgiving the
man, who has, as you think, injured
you; and resolving at once on a behaviour
that shall, in your turn, intitle you,
not only to the forgiveness, but even to
the esteem, of those whom you have injured.
</p>
<p>I would have preached on, and given
her more good advice, but she cut me
short, with this decisive answer.  Sir, I
neither desire your counsel nor your good
opinion; Mr. Pivot <hi rend="italic">may</hi> deserve some regard
from me, but <hi rend="italic">you</hi> I never will forgive,
and she flung from me.

<pb n="177"/>
</p>
<p>I called in Pivet, and telling him I
was infinitely pleased at the good disposition
I found his lady in, I wished him all
happiness and a safe journey, and they set
out directly for Dijon.
</p>
<p>And now, my dear Bidulph, stop, to
praise, to admire, to wonder at my virtue!
I, who have had one of the finest
women in England in my possession for
so many days (and by the way was not
her aversion) to yield up her (by me) unpolluted
charms to the arms of another!
Add to this, that it has cost me more to
make one woman honest, than it need
have done to have made half a dozen&mdash;
otherwise.  I had like to have writ a
strange ugly word, that was just at the
nib of my pen.
</p>
<p>If you relate you story with the laudable
partiality of a friend, judiciously
abolishing the context (for which you may
have many precedents) and neatly splicing
together the useful fragments, shall I not
appear to posterity as great as Scipio himself?
Ah, Sir George! if we knew the
secret springs of many of those actions

<pb n="178"/>
which dazzle us, in the histories of the
renowned heroes of old, it is not impossible
but the wondrous page might
dwindle into as insignificant a tale as
mine is.
</p>
<p>Well, I thank my good genius that has
led me safely through such a labyrinth as
I had got into.  In getting rid of that
woman (and not disgracefully neither) I
feel as if I had shaken off a great load.
But what a graceless baggage it is, not to
thank me for my kindness.  I, who have
been more than a father to her, in saving
her first from perdition, and then settling
her well int he world&mdash;but there is no
obliging some tempers.
</p>
<p>I shall leave this place to-morrow, for
I must hasten to Paris, to put every thing
on a good footing for the new-married
pair; and then I will go and ramble I do
not care whither for another year.  I
shall lodge at Paris, where I did before,
and desire you will write me directly
an account of all that passes within the
circle of your family.  Let your sister
and my lady Bidulph know in what

<pb n="179"/>
manner I have disposed of Mrs. Gerrarde,
but be sure you do it discreetly, and take
care not to mention that paultry circumstance
of her settlement, or any other
private agreement with Pivet.  I know
Mrs. Arnold's delicacy would be hurt by
the knowlege of this; therefore beware
of dropping the least hint of it, at your
peril.  Tell lady Bidulph I will pray devoutly
for her daughter's happiness; if
what I have done will promote it, it will
not a little contribute to my own; tho'
I begin to feel it is not to be expected in
this life, at least by such a hopeless wanderer
as I am.
</p>
<p>I could sit now, and indite melancholy
verses, or write an elegy, or make my
will, or do any other splenetic thing: in
short, I have a good mind to turn monk
and go in a monastery.  I am sure I should
have lady Bidulph's vote for that.
</p>
<p>Adieu, my dear Bidulph, you will not
hear from me again, perhaps, till I am
in another region.

<pb n="180"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 17.&mdash;What a strange man
this is, my Cecilia!  The more I reflect
on his conduct, the more I am amazed!
What a mixture is there in his nature!
Wild to a romantic degree in his conceptions,
yet how steady, how resolute,
how consistent, in putting those flights of
fancy into act!  Generous he certainly is;
how few men would put themselves to the
trouble and expence that he has done,
from such a disinterested, such a compassionate
motive!  Nay, on the contrary, I
believe most men would be cruel enough
to take a sort of pleasure in the vexation
of a man, who had succeeded to the love
of a mistress, once so much valued; and
would enjoy a mean triumph in being,
though without reason, the object of <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
jealousy, who had cut them off from all
hope.
</p>
<p>Mr. Faulkland is above this.  I think
myself highly indebted to him, whether
the scheme he has in so extraordinary a
manner undertaken for my service succeeds
or not.  Yet do I wish from my
heart, that the separation between Mr.

<pb n="181"/>
Arnold and Mrs. Gerrarde had been
brought about by any other means.  What
if Mr. Arnold should ever come at the
truth (though I think that hardly possible)
might it not leave him more
estranged from me than he is even now?
or if he should, in consequence of this odd
adventure, return to his poor banished
wife, repent of his injurious suspicions of
her, and restore her to his confidence and
love, can he, can he ever restore to her
that peace she has so long been a stranger
to?  Will no latent sparks of former unkindness
ever rekindle and light up the
fire of discord?  How unwillingly do we
repair the unprovoked injuries which we
find we have done to others!  Poor Mr.
Arnold! if I am so happy as to have my
innocence cleared to him, how miserable
will his own reflections make him!  But
if he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> convinced (which has been my
daily and hourly prayers), he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>not be
unhappy, if I can make him otherwise.
Oh, my dear! it is the wish, the ardent
longing of my soul, to recover the esteem,
though I lose the love, of Mr. Arnold!

<pb n="182"/>
for I call that Being to witness, who knows
the secrets of all hearts, that since I have
been his wife, I have never, even in
thought, swerved from that perfect and
inviolable fidelity which I vowed to him.
What then must have been my sufferings,
deprived of his love, cast out from his
house, and branded with the dreadful
name of an adultress?  For where is the
difference between the intention, and the
act?  To me there is no distinction, and
the husband must be gross that makes
one.
</p>
<p>My mother has suffered me to tell her
the substance of Mr. Faulkland's letters,
though she would not read them.  I own
I was better satisfied that she should receive
her information thus, because his
light manner of expressing himself in
many places would have given her great
offence.  Sir George did not consider this
when he submitted the letters to my mother's
as well as my perusal.  Many grave
animadversions did she make during my
recital, and many times lift up her eyes
in wonder at Mrs. Gerrarde's behaviour.

<pb n="183"/>
She often said Mr. Faulkland was frantic
to undertake such a thing, and wished he
had not taken such a <hi rend="italic">terrible</hi> woman in
hand.  When I came to that part of the
account where Mrs. Gerrarde had been
prevailed on to write to Mr. Arnold, I
begged she would give me leave to read
the copy of the letter to her, as I assured
her there was nothing in it but what would
give her pleasure.
</p>
<p>She consented; and I read it, leaving
out Mr. Faulkland's apostrophes.  My
mother did not interrupt me; and finding
she continued silent when I came to the
conclusion, I looked at her, and saw tears
running down her cheeks.  Yes, my dear,
my innocent child, said she, passionately
throwing her arms round me, you <hi rend="italic">were</hi>
wronged; God knows you were wronged;
and He now proclaims your innocence even
from the mouth of your most inveterate
enemy.  And lifting up her eyes, Thou
has turned the hearts of sinners to the
wisdom of the just; therefore shall the
righteous give Thee thanks.  And then,
God forgive that woman all her sins for

<pb n="184"/>
this one act, and God forgive Mr. Faulkland
<hi rend="italic">his</hi> sins, and reward him for this
goodness.  Sure your husband will relent
now; sure he will long to take my poor,
forsaken, virtuous child (and the tears
gushed as she spoke) to his bosom again.
</p>
<p>I could not answer her for some time;
my own tears almost choaked me: at last
I said, My dear mother, I have no doubt
of Mr. Arnold's returning kindness: he
will, I hope, be convinced that I am guiltless,
and we may yet be happy.
</p>
<p>She dried her eyes: God send, God
send you may!  But what has Mr. Faulkland
done with his poor penitent?  I hope
he will behave honourably to her; for this
excellent parent had no doubt but that the
letter, written by Mrs. Gerrarde, was, in
a great measure, the result of her own contrition;
for as I had not been minute
in giving her a particular account of all
the previous steps taken by Mr. Faulkland
to obtain it from her, she had not
the least idea that Mrs. Gerrarde had writ
in that manner from any other motive
than the good one which appeared obvious
to her.

<pb n="185"/>
</p>
<p>I told her, that I feared Mrs. Gerrarde
was far from being the penitent she supposed
her; and then acquainted her with
the true reasons which had induced her to
write in the manner she had done.  I then
proceeded to tell her of her behaviour
after writing the letter, and how Mr.
Faulkland had acted in consequence of
that; concluding with informing her of
Mrs. Gerrarde's being married, and provided
for in a very reputable way.
</p>
<p>My mother was highly delighted at this
last circumstance; for, she said, Mr.
Faulkland had no right to be the punisher
of her crimes; and if he had not made a
decent provision for her, she would never
have looked upon him but as a dishonest
person.
</p>
<p>She told me, that though she was very
glad, upon the whole, that Mr. Arnold
and that bad woman were separated, yet
she was nevertheless not quite so well satisfied
with the manner of it? for I think,
said she, that it is impossible but that a
man of Mr. Arnold's good sense must,
one time or other, have been convinced of

<pb n="186"/>
his error, and, of his own accord, returned
to a right way of thinking.
</p>
<p>I answered, that might possibly have
happened; but that he might have continued
long enough under his infatuation
intirely to ruin his family: and as for
what regarded me in particular, I knew
of no means so likely to remove his unjust
suspicions effectually, as those which Mr.
Faulkland had taken.
</p>
<p>You are right, my dear, said she; let
us hope the best.  I am glad MR. Faulkland
does not mean to return soon to
England: there is but one event which
could ever reconcile me to his doing so;
and that is, in order to do justice to the
unfortunate Miss Burchell.  If he would
wipe out that blot in his character by
marrying her, I should again allow him
to be a good man: at present, I own, I
can't help being dissatisfied, that one, so
blameable as I think him, should have
laid my daughter under the obligations
which he has done.
</p>
<p>I said it would rejoice me if he could
be prevailed on to make Miss Burchell

<pb n="187"/>
the reparation she mentioned; but I feared
she had no advocate with Mr. Faulkland;
though I was of opinion, if he were made
acquainted with the life of sorrow she led
as well as her reserved and modest behaviour,
he would be inclined to favour
her; especially if he were to see the poor
little boy.
</p>
<p>My mother said, He never could expect
quiet of mind, till he had wiped the tears
from her eyes.
</p>
<p>Miss Burchell came in while we were
speaking of her: my mother is always
glad to see her.  The poor girl has been
exceedingly shocked at Mr. Faulkland's
carrying away her aunt.  She thought this
action put such an invincible bar between
her and her hopes (almost desperate before)
that it went near to distract her;
for though there was no consanguinity in
the case, yet the degree of relationship
between her and Mrs. Gerrarde, made her
look upon this amour (for so she considered
it) with the utmost horror.  She
had often expressed her sense of it in so
lively a manner, both to my mother and

<pb n="188"/>
me, that had Mr. Faulkland ever been
inclined to offer her his hand, she could
not, consistently either with virtue or common
decency, have accepted of it.
</p>
<p>My mother, ever delighted with acts of
humanity, was in haste to communicate
the true state of the case to Miss Burchell.
It was her interest to keep our secret;
therefore I made no scruple of trusting her
with it; especially as I knew it would so
much contribute to her peace of mind.
</p>
<p>My mother accosted her with saying,
Miss Burchell, I have something to tell
you, that I believe will give you pleasure.
The unhappy young woman lifted up her
melancholy eyes; and, shaking her head,
answered, <hi rend="italic">That</hi> I believe, madam, is now
impossible.  Your aunt is married, said
my mother, but not to Mr. Faulkland;
and, what is more, there has never any
thing passed between them that need be
a bar to you, if he could be brought
to consider you as he ought.  Miss Burchell
looked amazed; then turned her
eyes from my mother to me, as if for an
explanation.  My mother desired me to

<pb n="189"/>
acquaint her with the history at large of
Mr. Faulkland's proceedings; I did so,
and took care not to omit the tender manner
in which he had mentioned her in one
of his letters.  She dropped some tears at
the recital; and then, turning to my mother,
My dear good madam, you have
snatched me from despair by this discovery:
I was overwhelmed; I think I could
not have got the better of my grief: a faint
ray of glimmering hope is once more
let in upon me.  Mr. Faulkland may <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>
be mine without a crime; or, if he is not,
I shall at least have the satisfaction to
think him not so abandoned as he appeared
to me an hour ago.  Oh, worthy and
lovely Mrs. Arnold! said she, addressing
herself to me, you see how Mr. Faulkland
reveres you: oh, that you would
but engage in my behalf! <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can influence
his heart; <hi rend="italic">you</hi> can guide his reason;
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> are his fate!
</p>
<p>Her fine eyes, which she fixed on me,
filled with persuasive eloquence, let me
into the whole of her meaning, and conveyed
more to me than it was in the

<pb n="190"/>
power of words to do.  I understand you,
dear madam, said I: and it grieves my
heart to think that I cannot, must not interest
myself for you in the manner I
would most ardently undertake to do, if
there were not such obstacles in my way,
as it is impossible for me to get over.
Mr. Faulkland, you see, is free from the
guilt we all feared he had plunged himself
into: he is full of remorse for the injury
he did you, and I dare believe retains
in his heart a tender sense of your
merit: he is still free; nay, he has declared
his intentions of continuing so.  These
circumstances give large room for hope:
your unobjectionable conduct, joined to
paternal affection, may still bring about
that wished-for, happy event; but this must
be left to time, and the workings of his
own heart.  You know Mr. Faulkland is,
in his natural temper, impatient of restraint;
he is but a very young man, and
has a few of those levities which a little
more settled age infallibly will correct,
where a good heart and a good understanding
are united.  Pardon me if I add,

<pb n="191"/>
that Mr. Faulkland is not ungenerous,
however blameable he may have been in
regard to you.  All these circumstances
considered, I say, may warrant your indulging
a hope, that he will at last be
brought to make you the reparation, which
is mine and my mother's wish as much
as your own.  Ah, madam! said she,
but Mr. Faulkland is a great way from
me: the remembrance of me is already
but too much worn out; distance, time,
and a variety of objects, must intirely efface
it.  <hi rend="italic">Your</hi> hand, the powerful magic
of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> touch, would soon brighten up
the colouring of those faint, faded traces,
that he but scarcely preserves of me in his
memory.  What could not your pen,
guided by a heart so tender, so sympathizing
with the grief of others, effect on
the man who considers you as a divinity?
If he had any hopes of <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, madam,
it would be presumption in me to put in
my claim; but as you cannot be my rival,
be my advocate: do, dear angelic
lady! (and she lifted up her hands to me
fervently) write to Mr. Faulkland; if you

<pb n="192"/>
can restore him to me, what prayers will I
not pour out for your happiness?
</p>
<p>My mother, who was greatly affected at
her discourse, said to me, Indeed, my
dear, if you could effect that, it would
be a very meritorious work.  Who knows
what the high opinion Mr. Faulkland has
of you, and the great deference he pays
to your judgment, may produce?
</p>
<p>I was sorry my good mother's openness
of heart had made her enter so suddenly
into Miss Burchell's sentiments: it encouraged
her to renew her intreaties; she
snatched both my mother's hands, and
kissed them; she wanted words to thank
her.
</p>
<p>I was unwilling to appear cold in Miss
Burchell's interest, or to refuse doing
what my mother seemed to approve; but
the resolution I had long before made,
never to see, or on any account whatsoever
to hold the least correspondence with
Mr. Faulkland, determined me.  If strict
prudence might on so extraordinary an
occasion have dispensed with this promise,
which, as I had made it to my own heart,

<pb n="193"/>
I thought amounted almost to a vow, I could
not however answer it to that decorum,
which I had, as an inviolable law, determined
to guide myself by, in so critical
a situation.  And I resolved to have it in
my power to say, in case Mr. Arnold and
I were ever to united again, that I had not
in the smallest article departed from it.
</p>
<p>I told Miss Burchell there was but one
reason which could prevent me from complying
with her request; but it was one
of so much weight with me, that, after
my informing her of it, I hoped she
would be so good as not to urge me farther.
I did, said I, upon my parting
with my husband, make a firm resolution,
not only never to see Mr. Faulkland, but
never to receive from, or write a line to
him, nor in any manner whatsoever to
keep up the least intercourse with him.
</p>
<p>I did not know but that Mr. Faulkland
(if he should learn the truth)
considering himself to be (as he really
was, though innocently) the cause of
that unfortunate separation, might, either
with a design of consoling me, or

<pb n="194"/>
of vindicating himself from any suspicion
of blame, have endeavoured to see me or
write to me.  In this I was mistaken;
his prudence, or his respect for me, prevented
him from attempting either.  The
resolution I had made, however, I
thought due to my husband's honour, as
well as my own.  The same cause still
subsists; the weight of it perhaps more
in my own imagination than in reality;
but if it even be so, indulge me, dear madam
(to my mother) and dear Miss
Burchell, in this singularity.  I have (not
improbably) the happy prospect of being
restored to Mr. Arnold's esteem; let me
then be able to assure him, that these
eyes, these ears, these hands, have been
as guiltless as my heart, and all equally
estranged from Mr. Faulkland.  This is
a declaration I think due to that punctilio,
or, give me leave to call it, that delicacy,
I have endeavoured to preserve in
all my conduct.  Mother, you always
taught me to avoid even the shadow of
reproach.
</p>
<p>Very true, my dearest, answered my

<pb n="195"/>
mother; I believe you are in the right.
Miss Burchell, I think my daughter cannot,
conformably to that discretion by
which she has always been governed, undertake
your cause at present: it did not
appear to me at first in the light wherein
Sidney has now put it.
</p>
<p>Miss Burchell made no answer, but by
her tears; we were both affected, and I
wished sincerely to have had it in my
power to serve her.  I told her, if Mr.
Arnold and I should ever be re-united,
that I would endeavour to draw him so
far over to our party, as to obtain his
permission to correspond with Mr. Faulkland:
that I was sure he would join with
me in wishing her the reparation she
hoped for; and that I would make no
scruple of engaging warmly for her in
such a case.  But then, madam, said she,
with what face can you interest yourself
for me, so long as Mr. Arnold shall think
that my aunt has been criminal with Mr.
Faulkland?  That thought, said I, did
not occur to me before, as is indeed a
difficulty; for should Mr. Arnold know

<pb n="196"/>
that the elopement of Mrs. Gerrarde was
against her will, and the letter she wrote
him extorted from her by Mr. Faulkland,
it might perhaps injure me as much in
his opinion, as Mrs. Gerrarde's false suggestions
had done before.  Those intricacies,
dear Miss Burchell, must be left to
time, which I hope may unravel them
favourably for us all.  The attempt to
disclose this affair to Mr. Arnold must not
be sudden; indeed I must be well assured
of his restored confidence and affection
before I can venture upon it at all.  When
ever that joyful event happens, assure
yourself of my best endeavours to serve
you, if I have really any influence over
Mr. Faulkland, and circumstances should
so happily concur as to put it in my power
to make use of it.
</p>
<p>Be contented, good Miss Burchell, said
my mother, with this promise which my
daughter has made you: if Mr. Arnold
and she should live together again,
Mr. Faulkland may probably return to
England; as nothing I believe now
keeps him abroad, but to avoid giving

<pb n="197"/>
Mr. Arnold umbrage, in the present unhappy
disunion between him and his
wife.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 18.&mdash;My brother continues
sullen; he seldom visits us, and when he
does, the meeting on his part is cold.
He has made himself master of many
particulars relating to poor Mr. Arnold's
unhappy connection with Mrs. Gerrarde;
for since her elopement the affair has been
more talked of than it was before, and
her whole history traced out.  She was
the daughter of an innkeeper in a country
town, and ran away with Capt.
Gerrarde, in his march through it, upon
an acquaintance of but a few days.  The
husband, who was passionately fond of her,
concealed the meanness of her birth, and
put her off to his relations for a young
lady of a reputable family, with whom
he got a good fortune.  This induced his
sister, a widow lady, the mother of Miss
Burchell, to leave at her death the care
of the unhappy girl to Capt. Gerrarde.
The captain, whose infirmities increased

<pb n="198"/>
fast upon him a few years after his marriage,
got leave to retire upon half-pay
into the country; and he lived for the
most part as Ashby, a little estate which
he had purchased and settled upon his
wife: it seems he had a pretty good personal
fortune, which he had squandered;
for his fondness could refuse her nothing,
except living apart from him at London,
which he could never consent to, though
it was always her desire; but being debarred
from this, she betook herself to such
pleasures as the country afforded, and was
always a leading woman at horse-races,
assemblies, and such other amusements,
as were within her reach: which, together
with expensive treats at home, and card-playing (her supreme delight) left her at his
death, which happened about five years after
their marriage, int he indignant state she
in her account of herself to Mr. Faulkland
acknowledges.  It was then Mr. Arnold
became acquainted with her, and in the
manner she represented; for my brother
has lately fallen into the acquaintance of
that very <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> (as she calls him) which

<pb n="199"/>
she mentions, as Mr. Pinnick, at whose
lodgings they first met.  This gentleman,
who was in reality nothing more than an
humble servant of the lady's, though she
called him cousin, the better to screen a
more particular connection, was so provoked
at her deserting him in favour of
Mr. Arnold, whom he said he was sure
she had insnared, that he made no scruple
of telling all he knew of her.   He
said, she had two brothers, very great profligates;
one of whom had been put into
prison for forgery, and would have been
hanged, had not Mr. Arnold, at the expence
of a very considerable sum, saved
his life.  The other, some very mean
retainer to the law, a plausible fellow,
and Mrs. Gerrarde's great favourite, for
whom she had art and influence enough
to prevail on Mr. Arnold to purchase a
considerable employment.  It would be
endless, said Mr. Pinnick, to tell you the
variety of stratagems she made use of to
get money out of those whom she had in
her power, and who were able to supply
her.  I, for my part, was not rich enough

<pb n="200"/>
for her, which was the chief reason I suppose
of Mr. Arnold's supplanting me; and
I take it for granted, that those arts, which
she practised on me to little effect, succeeded
better with him.  One time her
poor father was in gaol, and his whole
family would be undone, and her other
sent a begging, if he was not relieved
from his distress, by a trifling sum; fifty
pounds would do.  Another time her sister's
husband, a country shopkeeper, was upon
the point of breaking, and would be inevitably
ruined if he was not assisted.  And
then she had a formal letter to produce
from her sister upon the melancholy occasion.
These circumstances she made
no scruple of laying open to me, as she
knew I was no stranger to her origin,
having resided for some years in the town
where she formerly lived, though I did
not then know her.  Her mother was a
Roman Catholick; and in order to have
her daughter brought up in the same principles
with herself, had sent her to a relation
in Dublin, where she received her
education in a nunnery.  Though her artifices

<pb n="201"/>
to get money from me were grown
quite stale, I make no doubt but she
practiced them all over again on poor
Arnold.  She was not contented with the
lodgings <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had placed her in, but obliged
him to take a handsome house, elegantly
furnished for her: a very fine chariot
and horses were the next purchase; for a
hired one the lady would not vouchsafe to
sit in: and I am sure I have seen her in
the boxes at the play with as many jewels
on her as any lady there.
</p>
<p>All these ungrateful particulars, which
Sir George had received from Mr. Pinnick,
he took a sort of ill-natured pleasure
in repeating to my mother and me.
Unhappy Mr. Arnold! into what a gulph
didst thou unwarily plunge thyself!  Is it not
amazing that this affair was even so long
a secret?  That it was so to <hi rend="italic">me</hi> is not
strange; for it is natural to suppose that I
must have been the last person to receive
a hint of this nature; but that my brother
should never have been informed of
it is surprizing.  'Tis certain Mr. Arnold
was at first very cautious in his visits,

<pb n="202"/>
making them generally at night, and even
then he never was carried in his own chariot.
I am shocked to think of the mischiefs
which I fear he has done to his temporal
affairs, for his childrens sake as well as
his own; but since he is delivered from
the thraldom in which this woman held
him, the rest, I hope, by future good
management, may be retrieved.,  Would
to heaven, I had nothing left me to lament,
but the waste of his fortune!  Sir
George says he is sure he is deeply in
debt.  The law-suit too I hear is likely
to go against us; if that is to be the case,
it will be a blow indeed!
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 19.&mdash;How miserable is a
state of suspence!  I am, if possible, more
unhappy now, than when I was without
hope of recovering my dear, and now
more dear, because undone Mr. Arnold.
Our cause came to a final hearing many
days ago (though I was not told it till
this morning, and only prepared for it
yesterday) and it is given against us.  Mr.
Arnold by this stroke loses 900 pounds

<pb n="203"/>
a year, besides considerable costs.  Nothing
now remains but my jointure.  Into
what an abyss of misery is my unfortunate
husband plunged!  Oh, that I could
but see him! that I could but regain his
confidence! that I might sooth and comfort
him in his afflictions!
</p>
<p>My brother is very unkind; after telling
me the fatal news, he said, he
thought I should be much to blame if I
returned to Mr. Arnold, though he were
even desirous of it.  What prospect can
you have with him but beggary? said
he; for I suppose his next step will be to
wheedle you out of your jointure, the
only support you have now left for yourself
and your children.
</p>
<p>Oh, brother, brother! said I, you have
no heart!  I could say no more, for I burst
into tears.
</p>
<p>Perhaps you may not be put to the trial,
answered he cruelly; but if you should,
you are to take your own way, Mrs. Arnold,
for my advice had never any weight
with you or my mother.
</p>
<p>My mother replied, Sir George, you
do not use either me or your sister well.
Let her, in the name of God, follow the
dictates of her duty.  If the unfortunate
Mr. Arnold sees his error, can you be so
unchristian as to endeavour at steeling
his wife's heart against him?  O son,
this is not the way to obtain forgiveness
of God for your own faults!  Far be it
from Sidney to reject the proffered love
of a repenting husband.  My dear (to
me) don't afflict yourself; if your husband
has grace, you shall both be as happy
together as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can make you.  Misfortunes,
said Sir George, are mighty great
promoters of <hi rend="italic">grace</hi>; I don't doubt but
Mr. Arnold will repent most heartily&mdash;
the having lavished away his fortune,
and the hopes of repairing it, may give
him the <hi rend="italic">grace</hi> to take his wife again.
</p>
<p>Sir George, said my mother, angrily,
you will oblige me if you say no more on
the subject.
</p>
<p>I have done, madam, said my brother,
and took his leave.
</p>
<p>I had almost forgot to tell you by what
means the widow Arnold carried her suit

<pb n="205"/>
against us.  You may remember I informed
you she had at the beginning
threatened to produce a witness, who could
prove, that her late husband had been
with her on a particular night, a very
little time before his death.  Who this
witness was, had been kept an impenetrable
secret.  She did, however, produce
him, when the cause came to be
tried; and the witness proved to be Mrs.
Gerrarde's brother.  That very brother
whom Mr. Arnold had redeemed from a
gaol and peril of hanging.  This man it
seems had been very intimate with her
during her husband's life-time, while she
was in a state of separation from him:
but whether he was at all acquainted with
the late Mr. Arnold, we have no other
testimony than his own.  'Tis however
most certain, that she was suspected of an
intrigue with him, and in all human probability
that child, which is to inherit the
Arnold estate, is his.
</p>
<p>This concealed villain undoubtedly was
the person who first suggested this vile attempt
to her, and secretly abetted her in

<pb n="206"/>
all her proceedings.  It was after the
commencement of the law-suit that he
was put into gaol, and Mr. Arnold little
imagined, when under Mrs. Gerrarde's
influence he obtained his liberty, that
he was bestowing on this wicked wretch,
power to ruin him.
</p>
<p>I do not imagine Mrs. Gerrarde was in
this secret.  I suppose she would not
knowingly have contributed to beggar the
man by whom she was supported in
affluence.  But be that as it will, the evidence
of this fellow, who was bred an
attorney, together with that of Mrs. Arnold's
maid, established the proof on which
the issue of the whole affair turned.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, we could find
nobody capable of giving any testimony
which could overthrow theirs; and the
irregularity of the late Mr. Arnold's life
gave these evidences an appearance at
least of truth.  God forgive those people
the foul play they made use of!  I would
not possess a king's revenue on the terms
they now enjoy the Arnold estate.  'Tis
whispered, that the widow is supposed to

<pb n="207"/>
be privately married to this attorney; she
owes him a recompence; for I fear he has
risqued a great deal to serve her.  The
wretch had the effrontery to acknowlege
his obligation to Mr. Arnold; and at the
same time declared, that nothing but the
justice which he owed the widow, and the
orphan of his late friend, could have extorted
a testimony from him to his prejudice.
</p>
<p>I need not tell you in what light my
poor Mr. Arnold looks upon this affair.
He said to a gentleman, from whom Sir
George had the account, that he was justly
punished for having furnished such a villain
with the means for undoing him,
and execrates the memory of Mrs. Gerrarde,
who prevailed on him to do it,
for he scarce knew the fellow at that time,
having only seen him once or twice at
her lodgings.  But let me drop the mention
of such wretches at once.  My heart
is full of impatience to hear something
from Mr. Arnold.  Mrs. Gerrarde's letter
I fear has had no effect on him; he
must have received it long since.  What

<pb n="208"/>
can this dreadful silence mean?  My mother
now expects the advances towards
a reconciliation should be on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> side.  I
would I were rid of my suspence.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 23.&mdash;Lord and lady V&mdash;
arrived in town last night.  They sent a
compliment to me as soon as they alighted
at their house, which was not till nine
o'clock; and this morning at the same
hour I was agreeably surprized by a visit
from my lord; surprized I say, for he is
seldom out of bed so soon.  I had him
up to my dressing-room; my mother had
never seen him, and as she was undressed
did not choose to appear.  Well, my good
lady, said he, after saluting me, have
you heard any thing from Mr. Arnold
lately?  I told him I had not.  I don't
know whether you are apprized, said he,
that I am in all your secrets: Mr. Faulkland
and I correspond, and I know how
all matters stand.  You are not made acquainted,
perhaps, that I was aiding and
abetting to a certain scheme.  I told him
that Mr. Faulkland had writ my brother

<pb n="209"/>
the whole account, and that I was sure of
his kind participation in every thing that
related to me.  That you may depend
on said he; the thing cannot be named
that I would not do to serve you.  I understand
from Mr. Faulkland, that Mrs.
Gerrarde has writ to Mr. Arnold: Have
you heard of no effects produced by that
letter?  I told him, I had never heard a
word from Mr. Arnold since he had received
it.  I hope it will not be long before
you will, answered he: I called on
you this morning on purpose to prepare
you; for I suspect Arnold wants to
be reconciled: he wrote to me ten days
ago, conjuring me in the strongest terms
to come to town, and to prevail on lady
V&mdash; to accompany me: he said he had
something of the utmost consequence to
consult us upon, in which our friendship
might be of most material service to him;
he concluded with telling me, that the
whole happiness of his life depended on
our complying with his request.  Now as
this was immediately on his receiving
Mrs. Gerrarde's letter, for I had regular

<pb n="210"/>
intelligence of the whole proceeding, I
flatter myself that it was in consequence of
that letter he made this request, with a
design, as I hope, of getting us to mediate
between you.  As I could not just then
attend his summons, having business at
V&mdash;hall to detain me, I wrote him word,
that I should certainly be in town as on this
day; and that lady V&mdash; would be sure to
accompany me.  I have not heard from
him since till last night, when I sent a
message to his house to desire his company
to breakfast with me this morning; I expect
him at ten o'clock.  Now I had a
mind to inform you of his opening,
which to me seems to promise very favourably
for you.  I shall not mention
my having seen you, so that I can say
nothing from you to him.  I asked him,
was my lady acquainted with the affair as
it really stood?  He said she was; for that
she had been so exasperated against Mr.
Faulkland on his first going off with Mrs.
Gerrarde, whom she thought he had run
away with upon a very different design,
that he was very glad to undeceive her,

<pb n="211"/>
and that she would presently have done
the same by men, after the letter she had
wrote me about that affair, but that he
prevented her, thinking Mr. Faulkland
would be better pleased to unravel the
mystery himself.  He added, that she was
too much my friend, not to enter warmly
into my interests, and had been extremely
impatient to come to town.  I
thanked my lord for his and his lady's
friendship.  He then asked me how our
law-suit went on?  I answered, it had been
determined some days ago, and we had
lost our cause.  He turned pale at the
news.  Good God! what an unfortunate
man your husband is! said he: What
will become of him?
</p>
<p>He put an end to this visit immediately,
telling me, that either he or his lady
would call on me in the afternoon, to let
me know the result of their conference
with Mr. Arnold.
</p>
<p>I flew to my mother, to tell her the
joyful news.  She offered up a prayer that
it might turn out as my lord V&mdash; had
suggested; and said, she herself was of
the same opinion.

<pb n="212"/>
</p>
<p>With a heart elated with pleasure, my
dear Cecilia, I have scribbled over the
occurrences of this morning.  God grant
I may be able to close my journal of to-day with the happy wished-for event!
</p>
<p>I never counted the clock with such
impatience as I did this day, waiting the
promised visit of lord and lady V&mdash;; and
I ordered myself to be denied to all
company but them.  At one o'clock
good lady V&mdash; came, without my lord.
When I heard the rap at the door, and
saw form the window it was her equipage,
I was seized with such a trembling, that
when lady V&mdash;, who hurried up stairs,
entered the room, I was unable to speak,
or salute her.  She ran up to me, and
taking me by the hand, affectionately
embraced me.  My mother was present;
I made a shift to present her to lady V&mdash;.
She then led me to a chair, and sat down
by me.  Come, my dear Mrs. Arnold,
said she, recover your spirits; all will be
well.  I began to apologize for giving
her ladyship the trouble of coming to me,
when it was my duty to have waited on

<pb n="213"/>
her.  Do not mention ceremony, said
she; I was in too much haste to bring you
good news, to think of forms.  We have
had Mr. Arnold with us till within this
half hour, and indeed he more deserves
your pity now than your resentment.
</p>
<p>Oh, I feared it! said I, and tears started
into my eyes.  If you are so affected
at the barely knowing this, said my lady,
I must not tell you the particulars of our
conversation; it will be enough for you
to know, that your husband is convinced
of the injuries he has done you, and desires
nothing more than your forgiveness.
</p>
<p>Dear lady V&mdash;, said I, excuse me,
my heart is really so softened with sorrow,
that I cannot command my tears.  But I
beg that may not deter you from indulging
me with the particulars of what
passed between you and Mr. Arnold.  If I
do weep, as my tears no longer proceed
from grief, do not let them interrupt
you.
</p>
<p>My mother joined in begging lady V&mdash;
to inform us of all that passed in that
morning's interview.

<pb n="114"/><note></note>
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; obligingly complied, and
gave the following account of it.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold came exactly at ten o'clock;
my lord was just returned from his visit to
you, and had got in but a few minutes
before him.  Poor Mr. Arnold looked
abashed upon seeing me; his countenance
and his voice discovered the humiliation
of his mind.  After the first
compliments were over, we sat down to
breakfast; your husband drank a dish of
coffee, but ate nothing.  We were in
haste, that the servants should leave the
room, and dismissed them as soon as we
could.  Mr. lord then opened the conversation,
by saying, Well, Arnold, here
are lady V&mdash; and I come to attend your
summons; now tell us what service you
have to employ us in, for I assure you,
we are both ready to do you any act of
friendship in our power.
</p>
<p>My lord, I thank you, said Mr. Arnold;
the friendship you honour me
with, I flattered myself, some time ago,
might have been serviceable to me; I
must not now think of making use of it.

<pb n="215"/>
When I requested the favour of lady
V&mdash;'s presence and your's in town, I
meant to intreat your interposition between
me and Mrs. Arnold.  I know I
have wronged her so, that were she any
other than the woman she is, I could
never hope for forgiveness; but from <hi rend="italic">her</hi>
I did hope it, and thought your good
offices might bring about a re-union.  But
that is all over, I neither desire nor wish
it now.
</p>
<p>I am sorry for that, Mr. Arnold, said
I; I am sure nothing in this world besides
can ever make either your lady or
you happy.
</p>
<p>Do you know, madam, said he (and
the poor man really looked wildly) that
you see an absolute beggar before you?
A man without a foot of land, overwhelmed
with debts, and who shortly will
not have a house to shelter himself in.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
deserve it all, but Mrs. Arnold does not.
Do you think, that after all the wrongs I
have done her, I will involve her in
poverty too?  No, lady V&mdash;, no.  I am
not such an abandoned wretch.  All I desire

<pb n="216"/>
now of your ladyship is, to tell my
wife that I beg her forgiveness, and request
she will take care of our two children;
though the scanty pittance that her
mother's scrupulous nicety retained for
her will hardly enable her to do it; but
while lady Bidulph lives, I believe she
will not see them want.
</p>
<p>He uttered all this with so much eagerness,
that we never once attempted to interrupt
him.
</p>
<p>As I did not then know of the loss of
your cause, I was surprized to hear him
speak of his circumstances being so desperate,
and really feared his head was
turned.  But my lord soon explained the
matter, by saying he had heard that
morning of the issue of his law-suit, yet
still hoped, that matters were not so bad
as he represented them to be.  He then
told Mr. Arnold, he was extremely glad
to find that his wife had recovered his
good opinion; adding, that <hi rend="italic">he</hi> always
had the highest one of your virtue.  It
amazes me, Mr. Arnold, said I, that you
ever could entertain a doubt of it.  So it

<pb n="217"/>
does <hi rend="italic">me</hi> now, madam, said Mr. Arnold;
but I have been for this year past in a
dream, a horrid delirium, from which
that vile sorceress, who brought it on me,
has but just now rouzed me.
</p>
<p>I wanted to draw Mr. Arnold to this
point.  Have you heard any thing of her
since she left you, Sir? said I.
</p>
<p>He drew a letter out of his pocket, and
without answering me, put it into my
hands, and desired me to read it; then
rose off his chair, and walked about the
room.
</p>
<p>My lord and I read Mrs. Gerrarde's
letter together; we were both curious to
see it, Mr. Faulkland having mentioned
it in his correspondence.  Mr. Arnold,
said I, returning it to him, <hi rend="italic">without</hi> any
such proof as this, I believe nobody that
knows your lady would think her guilty;
nor could I ever entertain so bad an opinion
of Mr. Faulkland: I have known
him from his boyish days, and never had
reason to believe him capable of a dishonourable
action.
</p>
<p>I believe him innocent as to <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, answered

<pb n="218"/>
Mr. Arnold, but you cannot conceive
the pains that were taken by that
vile woman to make me think otherwise;
neither would her retracting all she said
now work so much on me, as other corroberating
circumstance: her running
away with the very man of whom she
raised my jealousy, after having plundered
me of almost every thing I had to bestow,
does not look like a sudden resolution:
the scheme must have been concerted
for some time, and Faulkland, I
suppose, was <hi rend="italic">her</hi> paramour, at the very
time she so basely slandered Mrs. Arnold;
for I am not so blind, even to the personal
charms of my wife, as to imagine
the greatest inconstant would grow tired
of her in so short a time.
</p>
<p>Why, I must own, said my lord, that
is a natural inference, which joined to the
perfidy and falshood of Mrs. Gerrarde,
puts it out of dispute, that she traduced
Mr. Faulkland and your wife merely to
gain her own wicked ends; one part of
which I am inclined to think she confesses
in her letter; that is to say, to have

<pb n="219"/>
you intirely in her own hands, though
not for the reason she there gives.  Her
other motive, I think, now plainly appears
by the consequence: she thought,
if you were jealous of your wife, you
would hardly suspect <hi rend="italic">her</hi> with the same
person, whose visits, to my knowledge,
were pretty frequent at her house.  Then,
said I (throwing my weight into the
scale) the unobjectionable character of
Mrs. Arnold, her pious education, her
modest and affectionate behaviour to you
for so long a time, and the recluse life
that she has led with her mother since
you parted, makes the thought of any ill
in her quite incredible.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash;, said your husband, impatiently,
I am as conscious of it all as you
can possibly wish me.  I know I am a
blind infatuated monster: What can you
say more?  Faulkland, I thank you for
ridding me of such a pest: Oh, that you
had taken her before I was so curst as to
see her face!  If you had, I should not
now be the undone wretch I am!  My
lord, my lady, will you do me the favour

<pb n="220"/>
to tell my wife and lady Bidulph,
how contrite I am (and he laid his hand
on his breast): while I had any thing
to offer her besides repentance, I could
have thrown myself at her feet for pardon,
and conjured her to have returned
to my bosom, and to her own deserted
house, form whence my madness drove
her; but I have now no house to bring
her to, and do not desire even to see her
face.
</p>
<p>His manner was so vehement, that I
really feared the agitations of his mind
might disorder his brain. k My lord told
him he was too desponding, and said, he
hoped all might be yet retrieved.  He
then inquired into the particular situation
of his affairs, which are, I am grieved to
say it, very bad indeed.  We were told,
when we were in Kent, that a part of
South-park was mortgaged, but did not
believe it, as we knew it was settled on
you.  Upon being asked, Mr. Arnold
himself acknowleged it, confessing at the
same time, that he had been prevailed on
to do this, in order to deliver Mrs. Gerrarde's

<pb n="221"/>
brother out of gaol, and that it
was the other villainous brother who had
transacted the affair for him.  I find, besides
this mortgage, that, with the costs
of his suit, he owes near seven thousand
pounds; to answer which, he says, he is
not worth six-pence, his plate and the
furniture of his houses in town and country
excepted.
</p>
<p>Though I had shed many tears, whilst
lady V&mdash; was describing Mr. Arnold's
behaviour at the beginning of her discourse,
I heard this latter part of her account
with a composed attention.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; took me by the hand: I am
sorry, dear Mrs. Arnold, said she, that I
am obliged to repeat such uncomfortable
tidings to you, but you must know all,
soon or late, and it is as well now as hereafter.
I am sure your patient temper and
good sense will enable you to bear up
against misfortunes.
</p>
<p>My lord then proceeded to ask Mr.
Arnold, if his friends could make his
circumstances a little easier, and Mrs. Arnold
would consent to live with him
again, had he any objection to it?

<pb n="222"/>
</p>
<p>My lord, answered your husband, from
the moment I heard of Mrs. Gerrarde's
elopement, I flattered myself with the
hopes of being restored to my senses, and
my peace, by a re-union with my wife;
for I own to you, her innocence from that
very time became evident to me, and it
was mere shame that prevented me from
making my application to lady Bidulph,
for the purpose of a reconciliation.  The
receipt of Mrs. Gerrarde's letter&mdash;(whether
the wretch has <hi rend="italic">really</hi> felt compunction,
or whether her cruelty to me, in order to
make me more unhappy, has drawn it
from her, I know not) the receipt of that
letter, I say, wherein Mrs Arnold's innocence
is so intirely cleared, convinced
me I ought not to delay making my wife
all the reparation in my power.  Though
I was shocked to think how much I had
foolishly squandered away, I was still in
possession of an estate of nine hundred
pounds a year; for though it was then in
litigation, my lawyers amused me to the
last, with a belief that I should carry my
suit; and notwithstanding that the payment

<pb n="223"/>
of my debts would lessen it, I knew, with
one of her contented and gentle spirit, it
would be sufficient to make us happy, and
her jointure (which I hoped soon to clear)
added to it, would enable us to sit down
in the country in tolerable affluence; and
I had come to a resolution to make it the
study of my life to render Mrs. Arnold
happy.  I know she is an admirable oeconomist;
I resolved to imitate her, and I
hoped in time to retrieve our circumstances.
These were my sentiments, my
lord, when I wrote to you, to beg that
you and my lady would come to town.
I own I had not courage enough to make
any efforts towards the so much wished-for re-union, without the interposition of
friends, whose good hearts I knew would
rejoice, could their endeavours bring it
about, and whose influence over Mrs.
Arnold I was certain would make the
accomplishment easy.  Do me the justice,
my lord, to believe, that if I had not
thought it in my power to have made
Mrs. Arnold amends for the injuries I have
done her, this hand should have been

<pb n="224"/>
sooner employed to send a pistol bullet thro'
my head, than to have endeavoured to procure
your mediation in the affair.
</p>
<p>But as things have turned out, I would
not for this earthly globe involve her in
my ruin; nor shall her family have it to
say, I sought their friendship when I was
abandoned of every other hope.
</p>
<p>As to that point, answered my lord,
I can bear you witness, that your first
overture to me, in order to bring about
a reconciliation, arrived before there was
any likelihood of your standing in need of
assistance, either from your wife's friends
or your own; for I believe they all, as
well as yourself, were pretty sure of your
carrying your suit, which, if you had done,
your affairs might, with a little care, have
soon been, in a great measure retrieved.
Therefore, if they should attempt to make
the ungenerous charge you apprehend, I
can confute it, and will to all the world;
and for the rest, we must manage as well
as we can.
</p>
<p>My lord then proposed some methods
to make his affairs a little more easy; as

<pb n="225"/>
I am sure his friendship for Mr. Arnold
and you will make him endeavour to
settle them to the best of his power.
</p>
<p>My lady V&mdash;'s politeness and generosity
would not suffer her to mention the
particulars of the methods proposed; but
I have reason to believe, my good lord
V&mdash; will interest himself rather farther
than I wish.
</p>
<p>When my lord and Mrs. Arnold, she
proceeded, had talked over these matters
for some time, in which my lord had
much ado to get the better of Mr.
Arnold's obstinacy, he told him that I
should undertake to explain his situation
to you and lady Bidulph.  That he
made no doubt of your tenderness in forgetting
all that was past, and being willing
to embrace his fortunes, let them be
what they would; for, said he, I am sure
Mrs. Arnold would think herself happier
with you, on three hundred pounds a
year, than she would with twice so many
thousands without you.
</p>
<p>Oh, madam! said I, interrupting her,
my lord has read my very heart.

<pb n="226"/>
</p>
<p>My lady smiled and went on.  Lady
Bidulph, said my lord, is so good a woman,
that as she must look on you in the
light of a repenting sinner, you may be
assured of her pardon and favour.  That
he may rest satisfied of, answered my mother.
My income is not considerable,
and I have never been able to lay any
thing by; but if Mr. Arnold can be extricated
from his present difficulties, so as
to be able to retire quietly into the country,
I will share that little with him.
</p>
<p>My lady V&mdash;'s eyes moistened, mine
were quite suffused.  I assure you, said
lady V&mdash;, it was not without abundance
of arguments used by my lord, and downright
quarrelling on my side, that Mr.
Arnold could be prevailed on to consent
that any other application should be made
on his part, than that of acquainting you
with his penitence, and communicating
his resolution, together with his motives
for it, of never seeing you more.
</p>
<p>He says, Sir George Bidulph never
was his friend; and, as he supposes him
more now his enemy than ever, he would

<pb n="227"/>
be sorry to be under any obligations to
him.
</p>
<p>My mother, who never conceals her
thoughts, answered directly, of that I believe
he need not be apprehensive; Sir
George is not very liberal; he would
have persuaded his sister against returning
to her husband, and I am sure will not be
willing to contribute towards making their
re-union happy.  Besides, as he is now going
to be married, he troubles himself
with little else than his intended bride.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; seemed shocked; I was sorry
my mother had spoke so freely of Sir
George, to one who was an intire stranger
both to him and her; but she is so
good, that even her errors proceed from
virtue.
</p>
<p>Well, said lady V&mdash;, we have now seen
the worst side of the prospect; let us turn
our eyes towards the pleasanter view.
What do you mean to do, Mrs. Arnold?
</p>
<p>Mean, madam! said I, to go directly
to my husband.
</p>
<p>Well, well, replied she, smiling, <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
I suppose; but how do you purpose to
settle your little houshold matters?

<pb n="228"/>
</p>
<p>I think, said my mother, the best thing
you can do is, to go directly down to
my house in Wiltshire.  You know <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
and the furniture are mine, during my
life; they go to your brother afterwards.
Send for your two children and honest
Martha; dispose of your house in town,
and all your effects here, as well as at
South-park and in Essex&mdash;let the produce
be applied to the payment of debts,
as far as it will go.  You will then have
your jointure to receive, to which I will
add two hundred pounds a year, which
will enable you, by degrees, to pay off
the rest of your debts, and I do not see
why you may not live comfortably besides.
</p>
<p>Extremely well, said my lady, with
Mrs. Arnold's good management; especially
as they will not have the expence of
house-rent.  I am sure my lord will willingly
undertake to manage Mr. Arnold's
affairs in town for him, and I would have
you both get into the country as fast as
you can.
</p>
<p>I am intirely of your opinion, lady

<pb n="229"/>
V&mdash;, said my mother.  What do you
think, child?  Dear madam, I think that
I am the happiest woman breathing.  Such
a parent as you, such a friend as lady V&mdash;,
and such a husband, as I promise myself
Mr. Arnold will prove&mdash;How can I be
otherwise than happy?  I am ready to do,
to do joyfully, whatever you direct.
Dear lady V&mdash;, ought not I to see poor
Mr. Arnold immediately?
</p>
<p>Why, said lady V&mdash;, I would not have
you surprize him; he is to dine with us
to-day, and I will prepare him to receive
you in the afternoon at my house, if you
choose it.
</p>
<p>By all means, my good lady V&mdash;.  I
will come to your house at five o'clock.
Well, said she, bring a few spirits with
you, and do not let the interview soften
you too much.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; then took her leave, as she
said she should hardly have time to dress
before dinner.  My mother and I spent
the interval between that time and evening,
in talking of our future scheme of
life.  Remember, my dear, said she, that

<pb n="230"/>
when I die, you lose the best part of your
income, as my house, together with my
jointure, revert to Sir George; and you
have no great reason to expect that he
will continue either to you; it therefore
behoves you to use oeconomy, as well for
the sake of <hi rend="italic">saving</hi> a little, as to accustom
yourselves to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> upon a little.  I would
myself accompany you down to the country;
but as my son's marriage is so near,
he would have reason to take it amiss of
me; and I know I shall have his imperious
temper to battle with, on our making
up matters between you and your husband;
but I shall make myself easy, by
reflecting that we have both acted agreeably
to our duty.
</p>
<p>You never, my Cecilia, experienced
such a situation as mine, and therefore
can have no idea of what I felt, in expectation
of seeing the person, whose presence
I most ardently wished for, and yet
was afraid of the interview.  My fears were
not on my own account; conscious as I
was of my innocence, I had no apprehensions
on that head: but I could not

<pb n="231"/>
bear the thoughts of beholding poor Mr.
Arnold, in the state of humiliation in
which I supposed I should find him.  I
wished the first encounter of our eyes
over; and as the appointed hour approached,
my anxiety increased: I was
faint, and seized with universal tremors.
</p>
<p>My mother did all she could to encourage
me, and a little before five o'clock, I was
put into a chair, and carried to lord
V&mdash;'s house.
</p>
<p>My lady met me on the stairs; I could
scarce breathe.  She carried me into her
dressing-room, and made me sit down
till I recovered a little; she was affected
herself, but endeavoured to raise my spirits.
I wish, said she, smiling, you had
been in my lord's hands, he would have
prepared you better than lady Bidulph
has for this meeting; he has been trying
to make Mr. Arnold drunk, in order to
give him courage, he says, to face you.
Poor man, he could scarcely credit me
when I told him you were to come this
evening.  She proposed my taking a few
drops, which I agreed to; and bidding

<pb n="232"/>
me pluck up my spirits, said she would
send Mr. Arnold to me.
</p>
<p>I catched lady V&mdash; by the hand, and
begged she would desire him, from me,
not to mention any thing that was past,
but let our meeting be, as if the separation
had only been occasioned by a long
journey.
</p>
<p>She left me, and Mr. Arnold in a few
minutes entered the room.  He approached
me speechless; my arms were extended
to receive him; he fell into them; we neither
of us spoke; there was no language
but tears, which we both shed plentifully.
Mr. Arnold sobbed as I pressed him to
my bosom.  My dearest Sidney, said he,
can it be!  Is it possible that you love me
still?
</p>
<p>If lady V&mdash; delivered my message to
you, my dear Mr. Arnold, sure you would
not speak thus to me.
</p>
<p>I understand you, said he; Oh, my
dear!  I never wished for wealth or length
of days, till now&mdash;but what I can I
will.
</p>
<p>Forbear, my love, said I; remember

<pb n="233"/>
my request.  I wanted to give his thoughts
another turn.  My mother longs to see
you: When will you visit her?
</p>
<p>I will throw myself at her feet, said he;
I want a blessing from her, and she has
sent me one, throwing his arms again
round me.
</p>
<p>How much are we obliged to good lord
and lady V&mdash;! said I.
</p>
<p>Oh, they have opened to me the path
to heaven, he answered&mdash;If it had not
been for them&mdash;I think we had better
go to them, said I; they will partake in
our happiness.
</p>
<p>He took me by the hand without answering,
and led me into the drawing-room.
</p>
<p>I have, my sister, endeavoured to recollect
our disjointed conversation, in order
to give it to you as well as I could.
All that I can remember I have set down,
though I am sure a good deal more
passed.
</p>
<p>Lord V&mdash;'s eyes sparkled when he saw
us enter together; but my lady and he,
I suppose, had agreed before-hand to say

<pb n="234"/>
nothing that could recall any past griefs,
for they only smiled at our entrance; and
my lord said, Arnold, you really hand
your lady in with as gallant an air, as if
you were married within these three hours.
And so I have been, my lord, answered
Mr. Arnold.  My lady presently called
for tea, and we chatted as if nothing had
happened.  The servants waiting in the
room made this necessary; though I could
observe the two footmen, who had lived
a good while with lord V&mdash;, looked with
no small astonishment at Mr. Arnold and
me.
</p>
<p>When the servants were withdrawn,
my lady introduced the subject of our
going out of town.  She had before acquainted
him with my mother's proposal,
and I repeated what she had said to me
on that head, after lady V&mdash; had left us.
My lord renewed the kind offers of his
friendship, and said, as we meant so
shortly to part with our house in St.
James's-street, that he thought it would
be better for us not to go into it at all,
but make use of his house while we staid

<pb n="235"/>
in town; as perhaps Mr. Arnold might
not like to be at lady Bidulph's, on account
of Sir George's coming here.
</p>
<p>I readily assented to this proposal; and
Mr. Arnold said it would be most agreeable
to him.  I told him, however, I
should be glad of my mother's approbation;
and asked Mr. Arnold if he did
not think it would be right of us both
to wait on her together, to let her know
of my lord's kind invitation.  My lady
V&mdash; said, by all means, and the sooner
the better; if you please, I will order
the chariot: I would have you see lady
Bidulph directly.  Mr. Arnold said, it
was what he purposed doing that very
night.
</p>
<p>The chariot was presently at the door;
lady V&mdash; said, I have an apartment ready,
and shall, with lady Bidulph's permission,
expect you back to-night.  We promised
to return, and drove to my mother's.
</p>
<p>I left Mr. Arnold in the parlour, whilst
I ran up stairs to inform her of his being
come to wait on her.
</p>
<p>Unluckily, as well as unexpectedly, I

<pb n="236"/>
found my brother with her.  I judged by
his voice, as I came upstairs, that he was
talking warmly to my mother; he stopped,
however, when I came into the room.
He was standing, and had his hat under
his arm.  I concluded he was going, and
was not sorry for it; he cast a cold look
at me, and, with an ironical smile, I
wish you joy Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Arnold</hi>, and he pronounced
my name with an emphasis.  Tho'
I was stung at his manner, I would not
let he see it.  Thank you, brother, said
I; God be praised I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> cause to rejoice.
Oh! no doubt on't, said he; so have we
all, that your husband has been graciously
pleased, after beggaring you and
your children, turning you out of doors,
and branding you with infamy, to receive
you at last into his favour.
</p>
<p>Sir George, said I, you shock me exceedingly:
where is the need of those
cruel repetitions? indeed you are very
unkind; and I could not refrain from
tears.
</p>
<p>The more blameable Mr. Arnold's conduct
has been, said my mother, the more

<pb n="237"/>
cause have we to rejoice in his amendment.
We must make allowances for
human failings.
</p>
<p>Ay, madam, I wish you had thought
of that in Mr. <hi rend="italic">Faulkland's</hi> case, cried my
brother.
</p>
<p>My mother seemed disconcerted at the
rebuke.  Sir George looked and smiled,
with an air of ill-natured triumph.  As
my mother was not quick in answering,
I replied, The cases are very different,
brother; what duty obliges us to pass by
in a husband, it is hardly moral not to discountenance
in another man.
</p>
<p>You say true, child, said my mother;
a woman certainly ought not to marry a
loose man, if she knows him to be such;
but if it be her misfortune to be joined
to such a one, she is not to reject him,
but more especially if she sees him willing to
reform.  Where is your husband, my dear?
Madam, he is below in the parlour; he is
come to receive your forgiveness, and
your blessing.  He shall have both, said
my good mother, and my prayers too.
Sir George looked a little surprized: I

<pb n="238"/>
will not interrupt so <hi rend="italic">pious</hi> a ceremony,
said he, but I hope you will give me
leave to withdraw before you desire him
up stairs; saying this, he bowed slightly
to my mother, and left the room: we
neither of us said any thing to stop him;
my mother rang the bell, but before a
servant could attend, he went out, and
clapped the door violently after him.
</p>
<p>Go bring your husband up to me, said
my mother.  I begged she would not
mention any thing of Sir George's behaviour.
I found Mr. Arnold impatient at
my stay.  Poor man, his situation made
him jealous of every thing that looked like
a slight.  I told him, my brother had
been above stairs, and as I did not think
a meeting would at that time have been
agreeable to either of them, I waited till
he was gone.  I perceive he knew <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was
in the house, said Mr. Arnold, by the
blustering manner of his departure.  I
made no reply; but, taking him under
the arm, led him to my mother.
</p>
<p>That best of women received him with
a tenderness that delighted me; he put

<pb n="239"/>
one knee to the ground while she embraced
him with maternal love, then
raised him, and taking his hand and mine,
joined them, holding them between her
own.  God bless you, my children, said
she; and may you never more be separated,
till God, who joined you, calls one
or other of you to himself!  Amen, cried I
fervently.  Amen, repeated Mr. Arnold.
</p>
<p>He then besought my mother to forgive
him for all the affliction he had occasioned
both to her and me; assuring
her that his veneration for her, and his
tenderness for me, were augmented an
hundred-fold, and should for the future
influence his whole conduct.
</p>
<p>After this, we fell on the subject of our
domestic affairs: we informed my mother
of my lord V&mdash;'s proposal, and said,
as we should stay in town but two or
three days, we had accepted of the offer
of being at his house, rather than by our
presence banish my brother from her's.
</p>
<p>He is an untractable man, said she; but
as I do not wish to quarrel with my children,
I think it will be prudent for you

<pb n="240"/>
to stay at my lord's rather than here.
Mr. Arnold said his obligations to lord
V&mdash; were unspeakable; for that he had
promised not only to see all our affairs properly
settled, but to take the mortgage of
South-park into his own hands, as he
fears the person who now has it will not
be so tender a creditor as himself.  He
also proposes (as the sale of my effects
cannot amount to what my debts come to)
to pay what may be deficient, and make
himself my sole creditor.  If it had not
been for such a prospect as this, added my
dear Mr. Arnold, notwithstanding your
goodness and lady Bidulph's, I had resolved
never to have appeared before
either of you.
</p>
<p>We determined to set out for Sidney
Castle in three or four days at farthest;
and took leave of my mother for this
night.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 21.&mdash;I told lady V&mdash; this
morning, that though I was determined
never to mention our past misfortune to
Mr. Arnold, yet I owned I had a great

<pb n="241"/>
curiosity to know what means Mrs. Gerrarde
had made use of, to work up his
suspicions to the high pitch she had done;
but I would rather remain unsatisfied,
than mortify him by the recollection of
this particular.
</p>
<p>I can inform you of her whole proceedings,
answered lady V&mdash;, as I had it
from Mr. Arnold himself; for to tell you
the truth, I was as curious about that as
you, and took the liberty to ask your
husband concerning it yesterday, when we
had him to ourselves.  It was the interval
between dinner, and the hour that
you were expected here in the evening,
that I laid hold of for this purpose, as I
found him then composed enough to bear
the inquiry.
</p>
<p>He told me, that form the time of his
going down to South-park, Mrs. Gerrarde
had begun to throw out insinuations
concerning you, that had a little
alarmed him.  She asked him, Whether
you made a good wife? which he answering
in the affirmative.  She replied, she was
glad of it; for that she had been told your

<pb n="242"/>
affections were formerly deeply engaged
to a very fine young gentleman, who, as
his fortune was very much above your
expectations, your mother, fearing your
violent fondness for him might lead you
into some act of indiscretion, had carried
you out of town on purpose to avoid him;
and was glad to marry you as hastily
as she could, to put you out of the reach
of harm.
</p>
<p>Your husband acknowleges, that he
believes he had himself casually informed
Mrs. Gerrarde of the manner of
his first becoming acquainted with you,
and the suddenness with which his marriage
was concluded; yet she pretended
to him, she was before apprized of these
particulars.
</p>
<p>He owns that those hints, though far
from giving him any suspicion of your
virtue, had nevertheless made some impression
on him.  You know, madam,
added he, that, madly devoted as my affections
were to Mrs. Gerrarde, I had always
behaved to my wife with great tenderness
and respect.  This I suppose it

<pb n="243"/>
was which raised Mrs. Gerrarde's jealousy,
and made her leave no method unattempted
to part us.  Mr. Faulkland had not
been long at V&mdash;hall, when she asked
me, with uncommon earnestness, whether
he visited at my house?  I told her did not
not, and asked the meaning of her inquiry.
She affected to turn it off, and
said, she had no particular reason for her
question; but her manner was such, as
the more excited my curiosity.  At length
she was prevailed on to tell me, that Mr.
Faulkland was the man (for she had not
before named the person) whom my wife
had so passionately loved.  Prepossessed
as I was with jealousy, I now took the
alarm.  I recollected that Mrs. Arnold
had told me at lord V&mdash;'s, upon my first
seeing him, there, that she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been very
well acquainted with him; and I even
thought that I had observed something
particular in his countenance when he addressed
her.  I was now sure that he had
come into the neighbourhood merely on
her account.  The hell that I suffered is
not to be described; for though I really

<pb n="244"/>
fancied that I had conceived almost an aversion
to Mrs. Arnold, I yet could not bear
the thoughts of being dishonoured.  An accident
happened which served to strengthen
my suspicions: he then related the circumstance
of his seeing you at the public
house on the night of the fire, and of his
finding Mr. Faulkland putting you into
your chariot.  He owned at the same
time, that he was there with Mrs. Gerrarde,
whom he had conducted out of the
playhouse, having called for her there in
his return from making a visit, as he had
promised to sup with her that night.
Mrs. Gerrarde, when she had him at her
house, affected to speak with some surprize
of your imprudence, in suffering a
young man of Mr. Faulkland's <hi rend="italic">known</hi>
turn for gallantry, to attend you to <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a
place, and at that hour.  Though, added
he, Mrs. Arnold's own account of this
had satisfied me at the time, yet Mrs.
Gerrarde's insinuations blew up the fire
anew in my breast.  She pretended to
sooth me; but the methods she took
rather increased my uneasiness.  She told

<pb n="245"/>
me, she believed my honour as <hi rend="italic">yet</hi> had
received no injury; and to preserve it
effectually, she thought I could not do
better than to forbid my wife to see Mr.
Faulkland.  The designing vile woman,
continued your husband, knowing that
this prohibition would cut off her visits at
V&mdash;hall, no doubt apprehended my wife
would not so readily acquiesce under
it; and she was sure any resistance on her
part would but the more inflame me.
But in this she was disappointed; for I no
sooner required Mrs. Arnold's promise on
the occasion, than she, without the least
hesitation, made it.  My requiring so
extraordinary a proof of her obedience,
induced Ms. Arnold to inquire into the
cause; and upon my explaining it, she
acknowleged that Mr. Faulkland had
once been her lover, and that the match
was broken off by her mother, who had
conceived some dislike to him.  This was
so far from gaining credit with me, that
it only served to corroborate what Mrs.
Gerrarde had told me.  I was, however,
contented for the present with the promise

<pb n="246"/>
that my wife had made me; of which
I informed Mrs. Gerrarde.
</p>
<p>He then proceeded to tell me of his
finding you and Mr. Faulkland together
one evening at the house of Mrs. Gerrarde.
I must confess, continued he, this unexpected
incident transported me beyond the
bounds of patience: I suffered, notwithstanding,
Mr. Faulkland to go quietly out
of the house, more for Mrs. Gerrarde's
sake than any other consideration, and permitted
her to go home with my wife (who
I then thought <hi rend="italic">pretended</hi> illness) waiting
in the mean time at her house for her return,
in order to have this extraordinary
and unexpected meeting explained.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde on her return expressed
the utmost concern and resentment on
the occasion.  She told me, that as she
had expected me that evening (which
was really the case) she had sent to my
wife to engage her for the next day, in
order to prevent her coming to interrupt
us, which was not unlikely, as Mrs. Arnold
had not been to see her from the
time she was laid up by the hurt she received;
and she said, she did not care to

<pb n="247"/>
lay herself so open to her servants, as to
have herself denied to the wife, whilst she
entertained the husband.
</p>
<p>I myself, continued he, having the
same apprehensions, had asked Mrs. Arnold,
on my going abroad in the morning,
how she purposed to dispose of herself for
the day; and she had told me she intended
to stay at home.  Mrs. Gerrarde said,
that notwithstanding her message, she
was surprized with a visit from Mrs. Arnold
just as she was sitting down to dinner;
that she however put a good face on
the matter, and received her very cordially;
but in order to get rid of her soon,
told her, she was engaged abroad in the
afternoon.  Mrs. Arnold, she added,
however thought proper to stay, and I
could not avoid asking her to drink coffee.
While we were at it, behold, to my
very great surprize, Mr. Faulkland sent
in his name, and immediately entered the
parlour.
</p>
<p>As I guessed, continued Mrs. Gerrarde,
that this was a settled assignation, I own
I was extremely provoked at it.  Mr.
Faulkland, with whom I formerly had a

<pb n="248"/>
very slight acquaintance at Bath, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> slight
indeed as never to be visited by him, now
very audaciously made an apology for not
having waited on me sooner; but said,
that he did not hear of my being in the
neighbourhood till a day or two before,
and hoped I would allow him the honour
of renewing his acquaintance.  I had
hardly temper enough to make him a
civil answer; but said, I was sorry I was
engaged that evening, and must be obliged
to go out immediately.  I thought this
hint was enough for Mrs. Arnold; and
that she would have had the discretion
to have taken her leave.  She asked pardon
for having kept me at home so long,
protesting she had really forgot that I
told her I was engaged.  She begged she
might not detain me any longer, saying
she had ordered her chariot to come for
her in the evening, and that she would
wait for it, as she found herself not very
well, and therefore not able to walk home.
I now saw into the whole scheme: Mr.
Faulkland would naturally stay to keep
her company,a nd they would have my
house to themselves; but I resolved to

<pb n="249"/>
disappoint them both; and telling Mrs.
Arnold I would leave her at home, ordered
the chariot to the door. l Mrs. Arnold
opposed this, under pretence of not
giving me so much trouble, and pretending
to be sick and faint, said, she would
step to the door in order to get a little
more air; I followed her hastily, and
your coming in the instant, I suppose,
detained Mr. Faulkland in the parlour;
for he could not but see you from the
window.  You know the rest, added
Mrs. Gerrarde; and I leave you to judge,
whether Mrs. Arnold be inclined to keep
her word with you, in regard to Mr.
Faulkland.
</p>
<p>Can you blame me, madam, proceeded
your husband, if, after what I now
saw and heard, I was enraged almost to
madness against my wife?  The base woman,
who had not accomplished her
wicked purpose, encouraged me in my
desperation.  In the midst of my fury,
however, I could not help making one
observation, which was, that as Mrs.
Gerrarde's going, or pretending to go out
that evening was a casual thing, they

<pb n="250"/>
could hardly have expected an opportunity
of being <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> at her house, even
though the meeting was concerted.  Mrs.
Gerrarde answered, That was very true;
and she supposed there was nothing at
first farther intended, than that the <hi rend="italic">lovers</hi>
should have the pleasure of seeing and
conversing together, as they had been so
long separated; the other, to be sure, said
she, was an after-thought, which the opportunity
suggested: she then, after making
me swear secrecy, told me, that Mrs.
Arnold had, when she followed her out to
the door, conjured her not to tell me that
Mr. Faulkland and she (Mrs. Gerrarde)
were acquainted; for, said she, as Mr.
Arnold is of a jealous temper, and has
heard that Mr. Faulkland formerly courted
me, he would not suffer me to come near
your house, if he knew that Mr. Faulkland
visited you.  I promised her I would
not, added Mrs. Gerrarde; and I make
no doubt but that she hoped in time (relying
on my good nature, my seeming
fondness for her, and the easiness of my
temper) to engage me as the confidant and
abettor of her loose amour.

<pb n="251"/>
</p>
<p>Mrs. Gerrarde concluded with saying,
that she believed nothing criminal had as
<hi rend="italic">yet</hi> passed between Mr. Faulkland and my
wife, at least since his coming to V&mdash;hall;
but as there was no with-holding a woman
from her will, it was very probable that
Mrs. Arnold would contrive the means of
meeting, though not at <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house, yet
somewhere else.  I raved, threatened,
talked of fighting Faulkland, and locking
up my wife.  She artfully dissuaded
me from such violent measures by a
number of arguments, which I will not
trouble you with repeating: amongst
other things, she said, that I had no right
to call Faulkland to an account merely
from surmise, which was all I had to
ground my charge on; and though there
was the strongest reason to believe he had
dishonourable designs on Mrs. Arnold,
yet as I could not directly accuse him of
them, I should be laughed at for engaging
in a quarrel, which to the world would
appear to be so ill-grounded.  As to what
I threatened in regard to my wife, she
said, such measures only make a woman

<pb n="252"/>
desperate, and would be far from preventing
the evil; in short, that it would be
better to part quietly, without embroiling
myself with her friends, or undertaking
the hateful office of becoming gaoler to my
wife.  She found me but too well disposed
to follow her fatal counsel.  I wrote that
cruel letter to my wife, which turned her
from her home, at Mrs. Gerrarde's house.
She kept me with her till midnight, and
had worked up my resentment to such a
pitch, that I determined not to see Mrs.
Arnold any more.  To avoid expostulations,
I went to a friend's house, at the
distance of several miles.  When I came
back, Mrs. Gerrarde told me that Mr.
Faulkland was absent from V&mdash;hall, and
she concluded the lovers were now together.
</p>
<p>I interrupted your husband at this part
of the story, pursued lady V&mdash;, and told
him, that to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> knowlege Mr. Faulkland
had gone to Sidney Castle to see Sir George
Bidulph, before you left your own house;
and did not set out from thence on his return
till about three weeks after your

<pb n="25"/><note></note>
separation; at the account of which he
was exceedingly surprized.
</p>
<p>Dear lady V&mdash;, said he, do you think
i <hi rend="italic">now</hi> want any farther arguments to convince
me what an injurious wretch I have
been to the best of women?
</p>
<p>I have one observation to make to you,
Mr. Arnold, added I; which is, that your
lady's misfortune was intirely owing to
her great delicacy, and the nice regard
she had to your peace and honour.
</p>
<p>I do not understand you, madam, he
replied.
</p>
<p>Know then, said I, that your wife was
well acquainted with your connection with
Mrs. Gerrarde, from the very night that
you found her at the public house, to
which the accident that happened to her
obliged her to go.  She owned to me, at
the time you drove her form her home,
that she had discovered your amour from
a conversation she overheard that night
between you and Mrs. Gerrarde.  This
I extorted from her, by letting her know
I was no stranger to the intrigue.  I then
repeated to him the discourse that passed

<pb n="254"/>
between him and that wicked woman, as
far as you had told me, and he very well
remembered it.  Now, Mr. Arnold, said
I, to prove the assertion I made in regard
to your lady, had she reproached you
with your infidelity, as <hi rend="italic">some</hi> wives would
have done, tho' it might have occasioned
a temporary uneasiness to you both, yet
would it have prevented her from falling
a sacrifice to that most artful and wicked of
her sex; for you could not then have had
such an improbable falshood imposed on
you, as that Mrs. Arnold would have
made choice of the <hi rend="italic">mistress</hi> of her husband
for a confidant, and fix on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> house as the
rendezvous for a love-intrigue.  The base
woman herself had no reason, from Mrs.
Arnold's prudent and gentle behaviour,
to think she was suspected by her.
</p>
<p>Your husband lifted up his eyes to heaven,
and striking his breast, Blind, blind
wretch! he cried; infatuated, ungrateful
monster! are there no amends&mdash;no
amends in thy power for such goodness?
</p>
<p>I could not hear such a description of
my poor Mr. Arnold's deep contrition.

<pb n="255"/>
I stopped lady V&mdash;; and, being now informed
of all I wanted to know, changed
the conversation.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 22.&mdash;We are preparing to get
into the country with all speed.  I have
writ to Patty to set out with the two children
for Sidney Castle as soon as possible.
Mr. Arnold has put his affairs intirely into
the hands of our worthy friend lord V&mdash;,
and we think, upon a calculation, that what
we have in town, at South-park, and at
Arnold-Abbey, will go near to answer the
present demands that are upon us.
</p>
<p>Lady V&mdash; is the best creature living!
she knows that neither Mr. Arnold nor I
choose to see any visitors, and she has let
in none these two days.  I am vexed at
laying her under such a restraint, although
her good-nature will not suffer her to think
it one.  We shall go out of town on
Monday; to-morrow we spend with my
mother, as do lord and lady V&mdash; (who
are mightily charmed with her) and then
adieu to London, perhaps for ever.  If
my mother comes down to me, as she intends

<pb n="256"/>
to do, I shall have no temptation
ever to return to it.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Sidney Castle, December 29.</hi>
</p>
<p>Here I am, my dear, in the house of
my nativity.  Your Sidney and her Arnold
as happy as a king and a queen! or,
to speak more properly, happier than any
king or queen in Christendom.  My two
dear little girls are well, thank God! and
look charmingly.  Poor babes! they could
have no idea of their loss when I left them,
yet they now seem pleased at seeing me
again.  My faithful Patty is almost out
of her wits with joy.  I have no maid
but her, and an honest servant, whom my
mother left here to look after her house.
Mr. Arnold has retained but one of his
men: the garden is taken care of by an
old man in the neighbourhood, to whom
my mother allows something for keeping
it in order.
</p>
<p>With what delight do I recal the days
of my childhood, which I passed here so
happily!  You, my dear Cecilia, mix yourself
in all my thoughts; every spot almost
brings you fresh into my memory.  The

<pb n="257"/>
little filbert-wood, the summer house, the
mount, and the chesnut-close that you
used to love so! but the sight of your old
dwelling makes me melancholy.  I think
I could not bear to go into the house; the
deserted avenue to me appears much darker
than it used to do; and your poor doves
are all flying about wild, and I think seem
to mourn the absence of their gentle mistress.
Oh, Cecilia! how exquisite are the
pleasures and the pains that those of too
nice feelings are liable to!  You, whose
sensibility is as strong as mine, know this.
From what trifles do minds of such a turn
derive both joy and grief!  Our names,
our virgin names, I find cut out on several
of the old elm trees: this conjures up
a thousand pleasing ideas, and brings back
those days when we were inseparable.  But
you are no longer Rivers, nor I Bidulph.
Then I think what I have suffered since I
lost that name, and at how remote a distance
you are from me; and I weep like a
child&mdash;But away with such reflections: I
am now happier, beyond comparison happier,
I think, than I was before my afflictions

<pb n="258"/>
overtook me.  Mr. Arnold's <hi rend="italic">recovered</hi>
heart I prize infinitely more than
I did when he first made me an offer of
it; because I am sure he gives it now
from a thorough conviction that I deserve
it, and therefore I am certain never
to have it alienated again.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 4.&mdash;It is almost three years
since I left this place; and the welcomes
I have received from all our old neighbours
and acquaintance, have given me
more satisfaction than I can express.  Mr.
Arnold is highly pleased with the marks of
affection which he sees me daily receive
from those who have known me from my
infancy.  I am the more delighted with
it, as I think it gives me an additional
value with him.  'Tis a proof at least
that I never misbehaved during the long
number of years that our former friends
knew me; and we must needs be pleased
to see the object of our love approved of
by others.  This I speak from my own
experience. Mr. Arnold is exceedingly
caressed by all our friends, and seems

<pb n="259"/>
equally delighted with them: you know
we have some of the best of people in the
world amongst our old set of acquaintance.
If you, my mother, and good lady
V&mdash;, were within my reach, I should
think Sidney-Castle a paradise.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 10.&mdash;I have had two letters to-day; one from lady V&mdash;, the other from
my dear mother.  Lady V&mdash; tells me her
Lord is bustling about for us, to put affairs
in the best condition he can.  She says,
he has already got a purchaser for the
lease of our house in St. James's-street;
and all the moveables in it, as they now
stand.  They have been valued at two
thousand seven hundred pounds.  As most
of our plate is there, as well as our chariot
and a pair of horses, this has fallen
very short of our expectations; but lady
V&mdash; says, she is sure there was not more
allowed for the furniture than half their
original value, though they have not been
a great while in use.  She tells me, that
my lord has employed a person to go down
to Arnold-Abbey, to dispose of the things

<pb n="260"/>
there; but she fears we shall receive a
very indifferent return from thence, as
there is but part of the furniture of Mr.
Arnold's putting in, the old goods going
together with the house to the widow.
My lord's steward at V&mdash;hall has instructions
about South-park: he writes word
to his lord, that he believes the whole of
what is there will not sell for more than
four hundred pounds: the house indeed
was but small, and the furniture not expensive.
Mrs. Gerrarde, he says, has had
an attachment laid on her house by a person
who built some bauble for her in her
garden, for which he claims a debt of
ninety pounds, though the steward says it
is not worth thirty.  'All things, however,
my lady adds, shall be adjusted in
the best manner we can; and my lord
will not let Mr. Arnold be distressed on
account of any deficiency that may happen
in those sales.'  What a jewel, my
Cecilia, is an honest, warm friend!
</p>
<p>The contents of my mother's letter are,
That Sir George was married yesterday to
lady Sarah P&mdash;.  She says, the bride was

<pb n="261"/>
most extravagantly fine; but looked neither
handsome nor genteel.  This was
much for my good mother to let drop
from her pen; but I know she never liked
lady Sarah, nor did her ladyship ever
treat her with the regard due to her character,
and to the person of one who was
to stand in the close and respectable degree
of relationship to her, which my mother
now does.  But I believe I have before
told you, that the blessings of good sense
and good temper are bestowed but in a
moderate degree on lady Sarah; and for
a woman of quality, lady V&mdash; tells me
(for I have never seen her) that her breeding
is not of the highest form.  But you
know a great fortune covers a multitude
of imperfections in the eyes of most people,
and I hope her love for my brother
will make her a good wife.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 23.&mdash;I am grown a perfect
farmer's wife, and have got a notable
dairy: I am mistress of three cows, I assure
you, which more than supply my family;
then I have the best poultry in the

<pb n="262"/>
country, and my garden flourishes like
Eden.  Mr. Arnold is such a sportsman,
that we have more game than we know
what to do with; but his chief pleasure is
hunting.
</p>
<p>Your little namesake promises to be the
greatest beauty in the county.  Dolly,
who is a pretty little cherry-cheek, and
her father's great favourite, prates like a
parrot.  How delightful will be the task
of expanding and forming the minds of
these two cherubs! how joyfully and how
thankfully do I look back on the troubled
sea which I have passed!  My voyage indeed
was not long, but my sufferings
were great while they lasted.  I never,
since I was married, enjoyed life till now.
You know my match was originally the
result of duty to the best of mothers; and
though, if I ever knew my own heart, it
was absolutely freed from all attachment
to any other person, yet was it not so devoted
to Mr. Arnold, as to have made
him my choice preferably to all other men,
if I had not resolved in <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, as in every
other action of my life, to be determined

<pb n="263"/>
by those to whom I owed obedience.
When I married Mr. Arnold, I esteemed
him; a sufficient foundation, in the person
of a husband, whereon to build love.
That love, his kindness and my own
gratitude, in a little time produced in my
heart; and I will venture to say few wives
loved so well, none better.  You know
I could never bear to consider love as a
childish divinity, who exercises his power
by throwing the heart into tumultous
raptures: <hi rend="italic">my</hi> love, tho' of a more temperate
kind, was sufficiently fervent to make
Mr. Arnold's coldness towards me alone
capable of wounding my heart most sensibly;
but when this coldness was aggravated
by the cruel distrust which he was
taught to entertain of me, the blow indeed
became scarce supportable; and I
did not till then know the progress he had
made in my affections.
</p>
<p>Sorrows, my Cecilia, soften and subdue
the mind prodigiously; and I think my
heart was better prepared from its sufferings
to receive Mr. Arnold's returning
tenderness, than an age of courtship in

<pb n="264"/>
the gay and prosperous days of life could
have framed it to.  I exult in his restored
affections, and love him a thousand times
better than ever I did.  He deserves it; I
am sure he does: he was led away from
me by enchantment; nothing else could
have done it.  But the charm is broke,
thank heaven! and I find him now the
tenderest, the best of men.  Every look,
every word, every action of his life, is
expressive of a love next to adoration.
Oh, I should be too happy, if the blessings
I now possess were to be my continued
portion in this life!  There is, however,
but <hi rend="italic">one</hi> about which I can rationally indulge
any fears&mdash;My mother&mdash;Her
years, and her growing infirmities, will
not suffer me to hope for her being long
absent from her final place of felicity.
You always used to say I anticipated misfortunes:
this event <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be farther off
than my anxious fears sometimes suggest
to me; so no more of it.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 10.&mdash;My good lady V&mdash; writes
me word, that all our business is finished.

<pb n="265"/>
The whole amount of our effects came
but to three thousand four hundred pounds;
our debts (including some charges which
have occurred in the transacting of our
affairs) exceeded eight thousand.  Our
worthy lord V&mdash; has paid the whole,
and has made himself our only creditor.
We have nothing now that we can call
our own, but my jointure.  I do not
reckon upon my mother's bounty to us;
our income from her, and the house we
live in, will be Sir George's, whenever it
is our misfortune to lose her.  But she
tells me she is well, and talks of coming
down in a fortnight.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 11.&mdash;I am here in a scene of still
life, my dear; and you must now expect
to hear of nothing but such trivial matters
as used to be the subjects of our journals
when we were both girls, and you lived
within a bow-shot of Sidney-Castle, and
saw me every day.  The last three months
of my life have glided away like a smooth
stream, when there is not a breath of wind
to ruffle it; and after you have read the

<pb n="266"/>
transactions of one day, you know how I
pass all the rest.
</p>
<p>I have told you of every-body that
came to see me, and all the visits that I
returned: I have given you an account
of all our old acquaintance, and of some
new ones.  You know what my amusements
are, and what my business: indeed,
what I call business, is my chief
pleasure.  You, who are surrounded by
the gaieties of a splendid court, had need
of the partiality which I know you have
for your Sidney, to desire a continuation
of her insipid narrative.,  But, I suppose,
if I were to tell you, that on such a day
my white Guiney-hen brought out a fine
brood of chickens, you might be as well
pleased with it, as I should be to hear from
you of the birth of an arch-duchess.  Indeed,
my Cecilia, there is such a sameness
in my now tranquil days, that I believe I
must have recourse to telling you my
dreams, to furnish out matter of variety.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 19.&mdash;We have had a wedding
to-day in our neighbourhood.  Young

<pb n="267"/>
Main (Patty's brother) has got a very
pretty young gentlewoman, with a fortune
of five thousand pounds.  It seems, this
pair had been fond of each other from
their childhood; but the girl's fortune put
her above her lover's hopes: however, as
he has, for a good while, been in very
great business, and has the reputation of
being better skilled in his profession than
any one in the country, he was in hopes,
that his character, his mistress's affection
for him, and his own constancy, would
have some little weight with her family.
Accordingly he ventured to make his application
to the young woman's brother,
at whose disposal she was, her father having
been dead for some years; but he was
rejected with scorn, and forbid the house.
</p>
<p>The girl's father, it seems, had been an
humourist, and left her the fortune under
a severe restriction; for if ever she married
without her brother's consent, she was
to lose it; so that, in that particular instance
of disposing of her person, she was
never to be her own mistress.   In the disposal
of her fortune, however, he did not

<pb n="268"/>
so tie her up; for after the age of one-and-twenty, she had the power of bequeathing
her fortune by will to whom she pleased.
</p>
<p>The brother who is a very honest man,
had no motive, but a regard to his sister's
interest, in refusing poor Mr. Main: a
man of a good fortune had proposed for
her, whom the brother importuned her
to accept of; but she was firm to her first
attachment.
</p>
<p>The young lover found means to convey
a letter to his mistress, in which he
told her, that as he was in circumstances
to support her genteelly, if she would
venture to accept of his hand, he would
never more bestow a thought on her fortune.
This proposal the prudent young
woman declined on her own part, but
advised him to make it to her brother, as
she was not then without suspicions that
he wished to retain her fortune in the family;
and that it was only to save appearances
he had proposed a match to her, of
which he was sure she would not accept.
But in this opinion she injured him.  She
thought, however, the experiment might

<pb n="269"/>
be of use, in giving the better colour to
her marrying afterwards the man whom
she loved.
</p>
<p>But it was an ill-judged attempt, and
succeeded accordingly: for, if the brother
should have given his consent, he could
have no pretence for with-holding her portion;
or if he did, by so mutual agreement,
his motive for denying his consent
before, must appear too obviously to be a
bad one.
</p>
<p>The young people, not considering this
sufficiently, resolved to make the trial;
accordingly Mr. Main wrote to the brother
a very submissive letter, telling him
he would, in the most solemn manner,
relinquish all claim to his sister's fortune,
if he would make him happy by consenting
to their marriage; without which, he
said, the young lady's regard for her brother
would not suffer her to take such a
step.
</p>
<p>This letter had no other effect than that
of making the brother extremely angry.
He sent a severe message to the young
man, to acquaint him, that he looked

<pb n="270"/>
upon his proposal as a most injurious affront
to his character; but that he was
ready to convince him, and every-body
else, that he had no designs upon his sister's
fortune, as he would not refuse his
consent to her marriage with any other
man in the country, but himself.  This
was a thunder-clap to the poor lover: he
comforted himself, however, with the
hopes that his mistress's heart would determine
her in his favour, notwithstanding
the severity of the brother.
</p>
<p>There had been, it seems, besides this
gentleman's not thinking Main a suitable
match for his sister, some old family pique
between him and Mr. Main's father.
</p>
<p>These transactions happened some time
before I came to the country.  Just about
that juncture, the poor girl had the misfortune
to receive a hurt in her breast, by
falling against the sharp corner of a desk
from a stool, on which she had stood in
order to reach down a book that was in a
little case over it.  This accident threw
her into a fit of illness, which put a stop
to all correspondence between her and her
lover.
</p>
<p>
<pb n="271"/>
</p>
<p>In this illness, a fever, which was her
apparent complaint, was the only thing
to which the physician paid attention, and
the hurt in her breast was not inquired
after; so that by the time she was tolerably
recovered from the former, the latter
was discovered to be in a very dangerous
way, and required the immediate assistance
of a surgeon.  You may be sure
poor Main was not the person pitched
upon to attend her; another was called in,
of less skill, but not so obnoxious to the
family.
</p>
<p>By this bungler she was tortured for
near three months; at the end of which
time, through improper treatment, the
malady was so far increased, that the
operator declared the breast must be taken
off, as the only possible means of saving
her life.
</p>
<p>The young gentlewoman's family were
all in the greatest affliction; she herself
seemed the only composed person amongst
them.  She appointed the day when she
was to undergo this severe trial of her
fortitude; it was at the distance of about

<pb n="272"/>
a week.  The surgeon objected to the
having it put off so long, but she was
peremptory, and at last prevailed.
</p>
<p>On the evening preceding the appointed
day, she conjured her brother in the most
earnest manner to permit Mr. Main to
be present at the operation.  The brother
was unwilling to comply, as he
thought it might very much discompose
her; but she was so extremely pressing,
that he was constrained to yield.
</p>
<p>The attending surgeon was consulted
on the occasion; who having declared,
that he had no objection to Mr. Main's
being present, that young man was sent
to.  He had been quite inconsoleable at
the accounts he received of the dangerous
state in which his mistress was, and
went with an aching heart to her brother's
house in the morning.
</p>
<p>He was introduced into her chamber,
where he found the whole chirurgical apparatus
ready.  The young woman herself
was in her closet, but came out in a
few minutes, with a countenance perfectly
serene.  She seated herself in an elbow

<pb n="273"/>
chair, and desired she might be indulged
for a quarter of an hour, to speak a few
words to her brother, before they proceeded
to their work.  Her brother was
immediately called to her, when taking
him by the hand, she requested him to sit
down by her.
</p>
<p>You have, said she, been a father to
me, since I lost my own; I acknowlege
your tenderness and your care of me with
gratitude.  I believe your refusal of me
to Mr. Main, was from no other motive
but your desire of seeing me matched to
a richer man.  I therefore freely forgive
you that only act in which you ever exercised
the authority my father gave you
over me.  My life, I now apprehend, is
in imminent danger, the hazard nearly
equal, whether I do, or do not undergo
the operation; but as they tell me there
is a chance in my favour on one side, I
am determined to submit to it.
</p>
<p>I put it off to this day, on account of
its being my birth-day.  I am now one-and-twenty, and as the consequences of
what I have to go through, may deprive

<pb n="274"/>
me of the power of doing what I intended,
I have spent this morning in making my
will.  You, brother, have an ample fortune;
I have no poor relations; I hope,
therefore, I shall stand justified to the
world, for having made Mr. Main my
heir.  Saying this, she pulled a paper
from under her gown, which she put into
her brother's hand, that he might read it.
It was her will, wrote by herself, regularly
signed, and witnessed by two servants
of the family.
</p>
<p>Sir, said she, turning to the other surgeon,
as soon as my brother is withdrawn,
I am ready for you.  You may imagine
this had various effects on the different
persons concerned.  The brother, however
displeased he might have been at
this act of his sister's, had too much humanity
to make any animadversions on it
at that time.  He returned the paper to
his sister without speaking, and retired.
</p>
<p>Poor Main, who had stood at the back
of her chair, from his first coming in, had
been endeavouring to suppress his tears
all the time; but at this proof of his mistress's

<pb n="275"/>
tenderness and generosity, it was
no longer in his power to do so, and they
burst from him with the utmost violence
of passion.
</p>
<p>The other surgeon desired him to compose
himself, for that they were losing
time, and the lady would be too much
ruffled.
</p>
<p>The heroic young woman, with a smiling
countenance, begged of him to dry
his eyes; perhaps, said she, I may recover.
Then fixing herself firmly in the
chair, she pronounced with much composure,
'I am ready.'  Two maid servants
stood one on each side of her, and the
surgeon drew near to do his painful work.
He had uncovered her bosom, and taken
off the dressings, when Mr. Main, casting
his eyes at her breast, begged he might
have leave to examine it before they proceeded.
The other surgeon, with some
indignation, said, his doing so was only
an unnecessary delay; and had already
laid hold of his knife, when Mr. Main
having looked at it, said, he was of  opinion
it might be saved, without endangering

<pb n="276"/>
the lady's life.  The other, with a
contemptuous smile, told him, he was
sorry he thought him so ignorant of his
profession, and without much ceremony
putting him aside, was about to proceed
to the operation; when Mr. Main laying
hold of him, said, that he never should
do it in his presence; adding, with some
warmth, that he would engage to make
a perfect cure of it in a month, without
the pain or hazard of amputation.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The young lady, who had been an eye-witness of what passed, for she would not
suffer her face to be covered, now thought
it proper to interpose.  She told the unfeeling
operator, that he might be very
sure she would embrace any distant hope
of saving herself from the pain, the danger,
and the loss she must sustain, if he
pursued the method he intended.  She
was not however so irresolute, she said,
as to desire either to avoid or postpone
the operation, if it should be found necessary;
but as there was hope given her
of a cure without it, she thought it but
reasonable to make the experiment; and

<pb n="277"/>
should therefore refer the decision of her
case to a third person of skill in the profession,
by whose opinion she would be
determined.
</p>
<p>The two women servants, who are always
professed enemies to chirurgical operations,
readily joined in her sentiments,
and saying it was a mortal sin to cut and
hack any Christian, they made haste to
cover up their young lady again.
</p>
<p>The disappointed surgeon hardly forbore
rude language to the women; and
telling Mr. Main he would make him
know what it was to traduce the skill of
a practitioner of his standing, marched
off in a violent passion, saying to his patient,
if she had a mind to kill herself, it
was nothing to him.
</p>
<p>The modest young man, delighted to
find the case of his beloved not so desperate
as he had supposed it to be, begged
she would permit him to apply some
proper dressings to the afflicted part, and
conjuring her to call in the aid of the
ablest surgeon that could be procured,
took his leave.

<pb n="278"/>
</p>
<p>The brother of the lady being apprized
of what had passed, lost no time in
sending an express to Bath; and by a very
handsome gratuity, induced a surgeon of
great eminence to set out immediately for
his house, who arrived early the next morning.
But in the mean time poor Main
had like to have paid dear for his superior
skill in his profession.  The other surgeon
had no sooner got home, than he sent
him a challenge, to meet him that evening
in a field at some distance from the
town.  They met; Main had the good
fortune, after wounding, to disarm his
antagonist, but first received himself a dangerous
wound.
</p>
<p>This accident was kept from the knowlege
of his mistress; but on the arrival of
the surgeon from Bath, as he would not
take off the dressings, but in the presence
of the person who put them on, it was
thought proper that both Mr. Main and
the other man should be sent for.  The
latter was not by any means in a condition
to attend; but the former, though
very ill and feverish, desired that he might

<pb n="279"/>
be carried to the house.  The Bath surgeon
having, in his and the brother's
presence, examined the case, declared it
as his opinion, that the complaint might
be removed without amputation; adding,
that it was owing to wrong management
that the grievance had gone so far.  He
consulted with Main, in the presence of
the family, as to his intended method of
treating it for the future; he agreed with
him intirely, with regard to the propriety
of it; and having assured the friends of
the girl, that he thought him a skilful
and ingenious young man, took his leave,
being obliged to return directly home.
</p>
<p>The testimony of this gentleman, whose
skill was undoubted, and whose impartiality
must be so too, having never seen
any of the parties concerned in his life
before, wrought so much on the brother
of the lady, that he did not hesitate to put
his sister under the care of her lover.
</p>
<p>Poor Main, though scarce able to leave
his bed for some time, was nevertheless
carried to his patient every day, at the
hazard of his life.  His skill, his tenderness,

<pb n="280"/>
and his assiduity, were all exerted in
a particular manner on the present occasion;
and in less than five weeks he had
the pleasure to see his mistress restored to
perfect health.
</p>
<p>The consequence of this incident was
very happy for them both; the brother,
exceedingly pleased at his whole behaviour,
told him, he was an honest generous
fellow; and since he was convinced
it was his sister's person, and not her fortune
he was attached to, he would, with
all his heart, bestow both on him; and
accordingly Mr. Arnold and I had this
day the satisfaction of seeing this worthy
young pair united in marriage.
</p>
<p>My Patty is not a little delighted at
her brother's good fortune.  The honest
youth, who has ever since his father's
death supported his mother, and as many
of the younger children as were not able
to gain their own livelihood, has now invited
his sister Patty to live with him;
but the faithful girl declined the offer;
telling her brother she would never quit
me, while I thought her worthy of my regard.

<pb n="281"/>
</p>
<p>I look upon myself to be much obliged
to her for this, as the station she is
now in, cannot be so advantageous as I
hoped to make it when I first took her
into my service; but I will make up in
kindness what may be wanting in profit.
Indeed I consider her rather as a friend
than a servant, and Mr. Arnold always
treats her with respect.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 20.&mdash;I am very uneasy at not
having it in my power to fulfil my promise
to poor Miss Burchell; but that is a string
I dare not as yet touch upon.  Indeed I
cannot bear any conversation that leads
to the subject.  Whenever Mr. Arnold
begins to accuse himself for his unhappy
conduct, in relation to Mrs. Gerrarde,
which he often does, I always stop him,
or turn the discourse to something else.
He never speaks of her now, but with a
contemptuous indifference; and is so firmly
persuaded that she went off willingly
with Mr. Faulkland, that I dare not as
yet undeceive him; which I must necessarily
do, should I express even a wish

<pb n="282"/>
that Mr. Faulkland should repair the
niece's wrongs by marriage.  Mr. Arnold
knows nothing of Miss Burchell's affair.
I went once so far as to say I had heard
Mr. Faulkland formerly liked this young
lady.  Mr. Arnold answered, I am glad
it went no farther than liking; if it had,
probably I should not have been so soon
delivered from my thraldom to her aunt.
This reply silenced me; I am exceedingly
perplexed about it.  Would to Heaven
Mr. Faulkland would of himself think of
doing the amiable unhappy girl justice!
</p>
<p>My mother writes me word, that Sir
George had informed Mr. Faulkland, by
letter, of the success of his project; and
that his answer was full of congratulations
and expressions of joy.  He is now
in Italy; but talks of returning to England
next summer.  He says, he hears
sometimes from Pivet, and that he and
his wife live very well together.
</p>
<p>My mother says she often sees Miss
Burchell, and that she encourages her
with the hope of what may happen when
Mr. Faulkland comes back.  If this

<pb n="283"/>
match should ever take place, it would
give me most sincere satisfaction.  The
girl's family is not contemptible; her
fortune is pretty large, her person lovely;
the unfortunate false step she made is an
intire secret, except to the persons immediately
concerned; so that with regard to
the world, her character too is good.
Mrs. Gerrarde, at worst, was only her
aunt by marriage; but if that circumstance
should be the only rub in her way
to happiness, I would sooner declare the
whole affair, and run the risk of Mr. Arnold's
being let into this ticklish secret,
than be a hindrance to the poor young
creature's welfare.  This affair never comes
a-cross me, but it makes me sigh.  God
send a favourable issue to it.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 26.&mdash;Alas, my Cecilia! we
have received most heavy news!  My good
lord V&mdash;, that stedfast, that worthy, that
best of friends, is no more!  He was preparing
to go to V&mdash;hall three days ago, but was
seized with an apoplexy, as he was coming
down stairs to go into his coach, and

<pb n="284"/>
died before any assistance could reach
him.  Oh, we have a severe loss in the
death of this most dear and valuable man!
&mdash;but why do I mention <hi rend="italic">our</hi> loss?&mdash;
his lady&mdash;poor lady V&mdash; is almost distracted
&mdash;and well she may&mdash;the
loss of husbands, fathers, every thing!
His eldest son, who is abroad, is sent for
home on this melancholy occasion.&mdash;
My poor mother is afflicted exceedingly:
every body that knew him must be so.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold and I have lost more than a
father.  How <hi rend="italic">self</hi> recurs every minute;
let me think of lady V&mdash; again, and not
dare to complain on my own account;
but my obligations to him were of such a
nature, as claim all my gratitude to his
memory, and all the tears that I have
abundantly shed for him.
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold is largely in his debt; we
have no room to expect the same friendship
from the present lord V&mdash;, that we
experienced from his father.
</p>
<p>This circumstance did not occur tome
till poor Mr. Arnold put me in mind
of it: my thoughts were too much absorbed

<pb n="285"/>
in grief, which the death alone of
our friend occasioned.  My mother hinted
at it too, in her letter to Mr. Arnold;
for it was to him she wrote the mournful
tidings.
</p>
<p>What a dark cloud of sorrow is now
spread over Sidney Castle! and how this
stroke has imbittered our little domestic
joys!  But let me not carry my complainings
into presumptuous murmurings.  I
have lost a sincere and truly valued friend;
but do I not still possess infinite blessings?
My husband, my dear Mr. Arnold, my
two sweet children, the best of mothers,
and thee, my ever-beloved Cecilia, whom
I still call mine, though at such a distance
from me.
</p>
<p>Then I comfort myself with reflecting
that lady V&mdash; has sons, who, I hope, will
be a blessing to her; that her fortune is
affluent, and that my lord had passed
through a well-spent life, to a pretty advanced
age: he was turned of sixty.  All
these considerations sooth my mind, and I
acknowlege, that, upon the whole, I
have, by far, more cause to be thankful,
than to repine.

<pb n="286"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 30.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;'s journey
down to V&mdash;hall having been so fatally
prevented, she is obliged to remain in
London.  The shock she received has
brought on her a fit of illness. I find my
lord has not left any ready money; his fortune
was large, but as they always lived
in great splendor, he laid none of his
income by: the whole sum which he
could command, he laid out for our use.
My lady's jointure is pretty considerable;
if it were ten times more, she deserves
it.  Oh, may her sons prove worthy of
such a parent!  The youngest I hear is
a very fine youth.  He is come to her
from Oxford to comfort her, till the arrival
of his eldest brother.
</p>
<p>My mother writes me word, that her
old friend lady Grimston is dead.  She
has left her whole fortune to charitable
uses: not a sixpence to either of her
daughters.  Poor Mrs. Vere!  She is content
with her little income, and has no
loss of so unnatural a parent, who carried
her vindictive spirit with her to the
grave.  As for the eldest, she did not

<pb n="287"/>
stand in need of any assistance from her;
but I own, though I had no great esteem
for lady Grimston, I could not help being
shocked at the brutal behaviour of her
son-in-law to her in her last hours.  She
had never seen either him or her daughter
from the time I told you they had
quarrelled; but when she found herself
dying, she sent a message to this favourite
daughter, desiring to see her; her husband,
whether out of disregard to the old
lady, or his wife, or both, absolutely refused
to let her go.  My mother remarks
on this passage in these words, 'Thus was
'this unfortunate parent punished in kind,
for denying her late husband the satisfaction
of seeing his youngest daughter,
when he was in the same circumstances
with herself.'
</p>
<p>My mother is nevertheless very much
troubled for the death of her old acquaintance;
who, she says, was a valuable woman:
she considers her decease as a memento,
which warns her of her own approaching
end; for they were just of an age.
</p>
<p>I fear my mother is not well, though

<pb n="288"/>
she does not say so; for she has put off her
coming down to Sidney Castle, without
giving me a reason for it.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 22.&mdash;I thank you, my beloved
Cecilia, for your cordial wish.  Your
opinion, that all my troubles are at an end,
is consonant to your desires, but I doubt
far from the real fact.  The young lord
V&mdash; is returned home; but oh, how unlike
that honest man whose title and fortune
he inherits!  How deceived were his
worthy parents in their hopes of him! he
is a stranger to every sentiment of virtue.
I have had a letter this day from my lady
V&mdash;, where she laments the degeneracy
of her son, whom they were made to believe
a pattern of excellence: but the tutor
to whom they entrusted him was as
profligate as himself.  In short, she says
he is quite a reprobate; she has not the
least authority or influence over him; she
laments this, particularly on our account:
we are indebted to him near five thousand
pounds, and my lady says, she fears he
will press Mr. Arnold.  He is profuse,

<pb n="289"/>
she says, in his expences, without being
generous.
</p>
<p>What can we do, my dear?  There is
not the least prospect now of our being
able to pay this money, but by our selling
the only remaining stake we have left.
Had my lord lived, he made us hope that
by his interest he could procure Mr. Arnold
some employment, which would
have enabled him to discharge this debt
at his ease, without our being obliged to
strip ourselves of our all.  As we purposed
living with the utmost oeconomy, this
might have been accomplished in a few
years.  This prospect is now lost to us.
We must submit.  I have begged of Mr.
Arnold to think immediately of selling
my jointure, for we have no reason to
expect any lenity from a man of such a
character as the present lord V&mdash; is.  We
can subsist upon the income which my
mother is so good as to allow us: it is
precarious, it is true, but something may
happen; I rely on that providence, who
has hitherto protected me.

<pb n="290"/>
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 28.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;'s apprehensions
were but too well founded.  We
have had a letter from her son's agent.
The debt <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be paid; and we are come
to a resolution to sell two hundred and
fifty pounds a year.  We shall then have
but fifty pounds a year in the world which
we can call our own!  I reckon not upon
my mother's life, these afflictions I fear
will hasten her departure to another world.
From Sir George we have nothing to expect:
he is absorbed in vanity; his new
alliances engross him intirely.
</p>
<p>My dear lady V&mdash; writes us word, she
will do her utmost to promote Mr. Arnold's
interest.  She has numerous and
powerful friends; and says, she makes
no doubt of obtaining something for him
worth his acceptance.  Believe me, my
Cecilia, I am not disheartened at this fresh
blow.  If my dear Mr. Arnold could reconcile
himself to it, I could be well contented.
I will not now (though you used
to accuse me of it) anticipate misfortunes;
we have still enough for the present to
live on decently; and if my lady V&mdash;'s

<pb n="291"/>
kind endeavours should succeed, we may
yet be happily provided for.  I will not
let the thought of my mother's death
interfere: let me but calm the anxious
fears of my poor Mr. Arnold, and all
will be well.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 12.&mdash;Thank God we have done
with the merciless lord V&mdash;!  his money
is to be paid directly to him.  I have recovered
my tranquility; I enjoy my little
in peace; and have the comfort to see Mr.
Arnold's mind more at ease, and reconciled
to his lot.  To lady V&mdash;'s goodness,
as well as my own earnest endeavours, I
impute this.  She says, she has the promise
of an honourable and a profitable
post for him; but we are to wait some
months for it.  The person who is now in
possession of this place is to be preferred
to a better, and she says, she has the word
of an <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> man on the occasion; 'he is
'a very <hi rend="italic">great</hi> man too, says my lady in
her letter; but as it is on the first part
of his character chiefly we are to depend,
I mention the other only by-the-bye.'

<pb n="292"/>
</p>
<p>Now, my dear, have I not reason to
be contented?  A thankless heart should I
have if I were not; but I am, indeed,
my Cecilia, I am; and I begin again to
be happy.  Our domestick felicity was
but disturbed for a while, it was not
overthrown.
</p>
<p>Here will I close; I have an opportunity
of sending this immediately by a
private hand to my beloved.
</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">Here Mrs. Arnold's maid Patty continues
the journal</hi>.]</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 15.&mdash;By my lady's orders I
take up the pen; and she has charged
me to set down every particular.  God
knows I am ill able to do it! but I will
strive to obey her.  My poor dear lady is
in such trouble, she has not the heart to
write, nor scarcely to do any thing.
</p>
<p>My master&mdash;Oh, madam! how shall
I express myself! my poor master, now
he is so good, we are going, I fear,
to lose him: I must write, according to
my lady's custom, every thing in the best
order I can.

<pb n="293"/>
</p>
<p>You cannot think, madam, how happy
they have lived together ever since my lady
came home to him again.  He seemed to
grow fonder and fonder of her every day;
I believe he perfectly adored her, and he
had reason.
</p>
<p>You know, madam, my lady was always
used to a chariot; but they never
attempted keeping one since they came
down to Sidney-Castle.  She asked my
master once, if he had a horse quiet
enough for her to venture to ride on to
church.  I observed my master turned
away his face, and put his handkerchief
to his eyes.  I believe he thought of a
little favourite pad that he had given to
Mrs. Gerrarde.  I have not one, my love,
said he, that I would trust you on.  You
had once a pretty horse that you were
fond of, but my desperate folly has not
even left you that; but I will look out
for one that will suit you.  No matter,
my dear, said my lady, smiling, and taking
him by the hand.  I will ride double,
I think that will suit me best.  Dearest of
women! said my master (and he fetched

<pb n="294"/>
a deep sigh) when shall I be able to
make you amends?  He lamented hourly
the loss of his fortune for her sake.
What will become of you, my dearest
creature, and my two poor children, said
he (when he was obliged to part with her
jointure) if I should die before you? and
then he cried, and wrung his hands.
My lady begged of him to put such melancholy
thoughts out of his head, saying,
they never disturbed her.  I hope,
said she, I shall never see your death;
but if it pleases God to punish me so far,
a little, a very little, will content me for
the rest of my days.  My master embraced
her and the sweet children; and
said, if heaven spared him life, he would
yet be the happiest man in the world.
Many a time have I been witness to such
discourse between them; for they knew
my love for them was so great, that they
would never scruple talking of their affairs
before me.  Oh, madam! I believe
there was never a truer penitent than my
master.  My dear lady has said to me,
since they were forced to speel her jointure,

<pb n="295"/>
Patty, though we are now reduced to little
more than two hundred pounds a year,
I have much more comfort than when we
had twelve.  I have the satisfaction of
seeing Mr. Arnold such as I wish him;
he is an altered man, Patty; he is truly
virtuous, and I am sure he loves me now
from right reason.  I am content with the
little that is left us.
</p>
<p>I always prayed for her prosperity;
but, madam, God is pleased to order
things otherwise than we poor silly mortals
think the best.  My lady has always
been good and pious, and I hope He will
yet bring her out of her troubles, though
they are great and many.
</p>
<p>My lady always charged me to be minute,
and to write particulars; but, good
madam, excuse the silly way I put my
words together.  I have not yet come
to the dismal part of my story, and I
hardly know how to go on, for indeed I
am forced to break off every now-and-then to cry.  Reason enough I have, to
be sure; but what is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sorrow compared
to my lady's!

<pb n="296"/>
</p>
<p>The day before yesterday my master
was asked by some gentlemen in our
neighbourhood to go a hunting: he had
no mind to go, for my lady was not very
well, and he was unwilling to leave her;
but she persuaded him, because she knew
he loved hunting dearly: she has blamed
herself for it ever since; but she could
not know by enchantment what was to
happen.  He left my lady in bed, and
went out about five o'clock in the morning.
At eight, as my lady was sitting at
breakfast, and I attending, the other
maid called me out.  Our man, who had
gone abroad with my master, was in the
kitchen, and looked as pale as death.  I
asked him what was the matter?  The
poor fellow could hardly speak; but at
last said, my master has got a desperate
fall in leaping a ditch, and I am afraid has
hurt his skull: he is lying at farmer Hill's
cottage, and one of the gentlemen is rid
off for a surgeon; but that is no place
for him, we must get him home: but I
thought it best to prepare my lady before
she sees him.  My lady rung her bell before

<pb n="297"/>
I could answer him; I ran in, but I
am sure I looked like a ghost, for my lady
started when she saw me.  Bless me!
Patty, said she, what is the matter?  Not
much, madam, said I.  He is killed! she
cried, and sprung out of her chair.
Indeed he is not, madam, I answered,
standing between her and the door; but
he has got a fall, and is a little hurt.
She made me no answer, but flew down
stairs, out at the front door, and down the
avenue as quick as an arrow.  I ran after
her, and the other servants after me; we
could not overtake her; but she was
soon stopped, for she met my poor master
borne by four men.  I suppose she thought
he was dead, for she fainted away directly,
and we carried her in after him.
</p>
<p>My master was put to bed; he was
alive, but not able to speak.  He had got
a dreadful cut in his head, and was sadly
bruised besides.
</p>
<p>As soon as my lady came to herself,
we told her my master was not killed.
She went into his room, but had not

<pb n="298"/>
power to speak, but sat like a stone statue
at his bed-side.  The surgeon came
in less than half an hour.  I believe he is
but a sorry one; for after he had dressed
the wound, he said there was not danger in
it.  At first we were all in hopes that it
was so; for about two o'clock my master
got his speech again; he complained of
sickness at his stomach, and violent pains
all over him.
</p>
<p>My lady, on hearing him speak, seemed
to be rouzed as if out of a deep sleep.
Several of the gentlemen, who had been
out with my master, had come to inquire
how he did; and though some of them
came into his chamber, my mistress did
not speak, nor seem to regard any of
them.  The first word she uttered was to
call me; Patty, said she, what is the
reason I do not see Mr. Main here?  It was
my brother she meant, who is a surgeon;
and I believe, madam, she has mentioned
him to you, as one that is reckoned
pretty skilful in his business.  One of the
gentlemen immediately said, By all means;
let him be sent for directly.  My brother

<pb n="299"/>
was soon fetched, and he thought proper
to bleed my master in the arm.  He would
not take the dressings off his head, as the
other surgeon had declared the skull was
not touched; but said, he would be present
when the would was dressed the next
day; and would watch all night by my
master.
</p>
<p>My lady was not to be removed from
the bed-side, nor could we persuade her to
take any sustenance the whole day.  My
poor master was in a high fever all night;
and I thought he strove to stifle his groans,
that my lady might not hear them.  She
did for all that; and I am sure every one
of them was worse than a dagger to her
heart.  She stole out of the room several
times for a minute, and I could hear her
bursting into tears as soon as she was
without side the door; then she would
come in again, and sit by him, till her
heart was again so full, she was forced to
go out to give it vent.  The whole night
passed over in this dismal way.
</p>
<p>When my master's head was examined
the next day, my brother found that the

<pb n="300"/>
skull was not touched where he had received
the cut, but that it was broke in two
other places, and in so dangerous a way,
that it was impossible to save his life,
as it was not in a part where he could be
trepanned.  The other surgeon, who
found he had been mistaken at first, now
joined with my brother in opinion that
the world could not save my master's life.
Oh, madam! if you had seen my lady
when this was declared to her!  I shall
never forget her looks.  I remember a
piece of fine painting at your house,
which I used to hear your family commend
mightily.  It was a picture of
despair.  My lady put me in mind of
this piece; she had the very countenance
of it; but I think, if she had then sat to
a painter, he could have made a stronger
and more heart-breaking look even than
that picture has.
</p>
<p>Such another dismal day and night I
believe never was passed in this house.
My brother staid with us, though he
could do but little service, except to watch
my poor master, for he was between
whiles quite out of his reason&mdash;
<pb n="301"/>
</p>
<p>No rest did my lady take all last night.
She could not be got out of the room;
she has tasted nothing these two days, nor
slept a wink these two nights.&mdash;She will
destroy herself&mdash;What will become of us?
&mdash;I have wrote to my lady Bidulph, to let
her know the deplorable condition we are
all in&mdash;My God! what will become of
the poor children, if my lady goes on at
this rate!  She cannot hold out to be sure,
such a load of sorrow at her heart, without
nourishment or sleep&mdash;.  Oh,
my good madam! I am not able to go
on with my task&mdash;We have not the least
hopes in the world&mdash;My master grows
worse and worse every hour: he has his
reason now, and is sensible that he is
dying.  Heaven knows, if I could lay
down my life to save his, how gladly I
would do it!  I should be no loss, but he
will be a grievous one&mdash;.
</p>
<p>Lord help me!  I am not able to go
on&mdash;I have writ this by bits and scraps&mdash;
</p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">Mr. Main in continuation.</hi>]
</p>
<p></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May 16, Three o'clock in the morning.</hi>
</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold has been delirious the

<pb n="302"/>
greatest part of yesterday; but about six
o'clock in the evening, having come a
little to his senses, he was conscious that
he was going fast, and desired that prayers
might be read by him.  His lady sent
for the minister of the parish, but he was
gone to London: the gentleman whom
he had left to do his duty, was taken ill
the night before, and was not able to
leave his bed.  He sent the messenger
that went for him, to another clergyman,
who lived about four miles farther off, to
request he would attend in his stead; but
he was engaged on the same duty in his
own parish, and could not come, he said,
till next morning.  The servant had
wasted above two hours on this errand;
it was nine o'clock when he returned.
Mr. Arnold, during this interval had had
several ramblings; but was now again a
little composed, though apparently worse.
I whispered the apothecary, who just then
came in, that he could not live till morning.
Mrs. Arnold observed me, and
begged to know what I said.  I told her
tenderly, that I feared Mr. Atkins (that

<pb n="303"/>
was the clergyman's name) would arrive
too late, if he deferred his visit till next
day.
</p>
<p>She made me no answer, but seemed
to study a little; then went composedly
to Mr. Arnold's bed-side.  My dear, said
she, Mr. Downs is unluckily from home;
his assistant is sick in bed; and we cannot
to-night get any other clergyman to visit
you: but as you are desirous of offering up
your prayers to Almighty God, I hope
it will not be improper if I read the service
for the sick by you.  He stretched
out his hand towards her, and said, in a
faint, yet eager voice, Do, do, my good
angel!  Tears stood in the lady's eyes as
she turned from him; but she quickly
wiped them off, and requested of me and
the apothecary to join with her in the solemn
office she was going to perform,
which she said, though she was sensible it
was an irregular act, yet she hoped, from
the necessity of the case, would be accepted
in the sight of God.
</p>
<p>She ordered my sister to fetch her a
prayer-book; and then kneeled down at
Mr. Arnold's bed-side.

<pb n="304"/>
</p>
<p>Surely nothing ever appeared so graceful'
her fine hands and her fine eyes lifted
up to heaven, while the book lay open before
her on the table.  Such a reverential,
such an ardent, yet such a mournful supplication
in those fine eyes!  She looked
like something more than human!  After
having in this posture offered up a short
petition in silence, she began the service.
</p>
<p>Never did I see true devotion before;
the fervor of her looks, and the tone of
her voice was such, you would have
thought she beheld her Creator with her
bodily eyes.  For my part, I looked on
her with such reverence, that she appeared
to me like an angel interceding for us
poor mortal sinners.
</p>
<p>She went through the office with admirable
strength of mind (omitting the
exhortation) till she came to that part of
the prayer, which says, 'yet forasmuch
as in all appearance the time of his
dissolution draweth nigh,' <hi rend="italic">Etc</hi>.  Here
her voice faultered, and she stopped; but
soon recovered herself, and proceeded with
an unbroken tone to the end.  Every

<pb n="305"/>
one present wept but herself.  She thanked
us for our kindness in staying, and
begged we would continue by poor Mr.
Arnold, while there was the least possibility
of administering any relief to him.
</p>
<p>I told her I would most willingly obey
her commands, and sit up all the night
with him, though it was not in human
power to give him any assistance.
</p>
<p>She repeated her thanks, and then sitting
down by the bed-side, remained composed
and silent.
</p>
<p>About twelve o'clock, finding Mr. Arnold
speechless, I entreated her to retire to
her own chamber, and if she could not
sleep, to take some little refreshment; for
she had taken nothing that whole day, nor
for the two preceding ones, but a dish of
tea, which my sister had forced on her.
</p>
<p>Mr. Main, said she, suffer me to continue
a little longer; my task will soon be
over.  I was unwilling to urge her; and
she remained sitting in her place.
</p>
<p>About two o'clock we heard Mr. Arnold
give a deep groan: He is gone! said

<pb n="306"/>
she, and started off her chair.  I stepped
to his bed-side, and found indeed he had
breathed his last.  She snatched up one
of his hands that lay upon the coverlid of
the bed, held it for near a minute to her
lips, and then, without any audible token
of grief, went out of the room.
</p>
<p>I pray God to support and comfort
this excellent woman.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">Patty in continuation</hi>.
</p>
<p>Amen! Amen!&mdash;Sure my dear unhappy
lady is enough to break one's heart
to see her.  I was not able to go on, good
madam, and begged of my brother to
set down what happened, and he has put
it in better words than I could.  My lady
shut herself up for the remainder of the
night, and would not suffer any one to
come near her; it is easy to guess how she
spent her time: rest, to be sure, she took
none; she could not, if she had been inclined,
for there was no bed in the chamber
where she locked herself up.  In the
morning, a lady, who is our neighbour,

<pb n="307"/>
a worthy good woman, came in  her own
coach, and took away my lady and the
two children.  She neither consented nor
refused; but seemed to let us do what we
would with her; for she said nothing,
but suffered the lady and me to lead her
down stairs, and put her into the coach.
But the sight of the two children threw
her into such an agony, that I thought
I should have died on the spot only with
seeing her.
</p>
<p>I have writ again to lady Bidulph: if
she is able, to be sure she will come
down; but I had rather she would send
for my lady, for this is a sorrowful place
for her to stay in.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 20.&mdash;My lady has received a
letter from her mother, desiring her to
come to town directly with the children.
She says she is not able to come down for
her, as her health is but bad; and my lady
V&mdash; has been so good as to send down
her own coach to carry the little family to
town.
</p>
<p>My brother has taken the care of my

<pb n="308"/>
master's funeral upon himself.  He is to
be carried to the family burying place at
Arnold-Abbey.  As soon as that is over,
we must try to get my lady to town; she
has no business to go into her own lonely
house again; it would be enough to kill
her.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 30.&mdash;Thank God we have got
back safe to London.  My lady keeps
up wonderfully, under the load of grief
that she has at her heart.  She does not
complain nor lament herself, as I have
seen some do, who have not been in half
her trouble.  She hardly spoke a word
during her whole journey, and strove as
much as possible not to cry; but I could
observe that she never turned her eyes on
the two little babes, one of who sat in
my lap, and the other beside me, but
the tears ran down her cheeks.
</p>
<p>It was a doleful sight, the meeting between
her and my lady Bidulph.  The
poor old lady grieves sadly, and looks
mighty ill: I am afraid she will not hold
out long; she has had great trials, for a

<pb n="309"/>
lady so far in years.  Sir George came to
see my lady; he looked troubled; I hope
he will be good to her.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 1.&mdash;My lady asked me this
morning if I had thought of keeping any
journal for this fortnight past.  I told
her I had, and she desired to see it.  She
shed so many tears while she read it, that
the paper was quite wet when she gave it
to me again.  She ordered me to make
up the packet, and send it off, as she was
not in a condition to add any thing to it
herself.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>[<hi rend="italic">Mrs. Arnold in continuation</hi>.]
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 20.&mdash;Yes, my dear Cecilia, I
have need of the tender condolements,
with which your last kind packet was
filled.  Well may you call me a child of
affliction; I am now so exercised in sorrows,
that I look forward to nothing else.
</p>
<p>Patty, I find, has been a faithful journalist;
and has carried down her melancholy
narrative to this day: this day, on which,

<pb n="310"/>
for the first time, I have taken a pen in
my hand for more than two months: but
my eyes are much better, and I hope I
shall not have occasion for the assistance
of her pen, unless some new calamity
should again disqualify me from using my
own.
</p>
<p>Yet in the midst of my griefs, ought I
not to return thanks to heaven, that I
have such an asylum to fly to, as the arms
of one of the best of mothers?  Oh, my
dear! while I have her, I ought not to
say, that I have lost every thing.  Sir
George has been more obliging since my
fatal loss than he was before; but still
there wants that cordial heart which he
formerly had.  As for his lady, I know
very little of her.  She came to see me
twice since my arrival in town, in all the
formal parade of a state visit.  How ill
does the vanity of pomp suit with a house
of mourning!  Her visits were short, formal,
and cold.  She seems to be intolerably
proud, and I thought looked as if
she was disgusted at visiting people in

<pb n="311"/>
lodgings, who were so nearly related to
her.  My brother and she are to go down
this summer into Scotland, to see a nobleman
who is her uncle by her mother's
side.  She is ridiculously vain of her family,
and has taught Sir George to be
so too; so that now he hardly vouchsafes to
own a relation that is untitled.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 21.&mdash;Lady V&mdash;, whose friendship
has been one of the chief resources
of comfort to me, went out of town this
morning.  She is retired, for life I fear,
to a distant part of Lancashire, in order
to spend the rest of her days with her
eldest sister, a widow lady, of whom she
is very fond.  Her son's ill behaviour
has disgusted her so, she has broke with
him intirely.  Her younger son is gone
into the army, not, I find, with her approbation:
and she told me, she has
nothing now worth living for, at least
nothing for which she should subject herself
to the cares of life.  She insisted
on my corresponding with her; and renewed
her assurances of that kind attachment,
which I have already so strongly
experienced.
</p>
<p>At another time the loss of this dear
woman's society would have affected me
more sensibly; but I am so inured to disappointment
and grief, that I am almost
become a stoic.
</p>
<p>Patty has already informed you, that
Miss Burchell is often with us; she is more
solicitous, more assiduous than ever in
her attendance on my mother.  I find she
even sat up with her two nights, on an
illness which seized her on her first hearing
the news of my misfortune.,  Poor
girl!  My mother tells me she went so far
as to express her apprehensions on my being
again single; but my mother quieted
her fears on that head (not without a soft
reprimand for her doubting) by putting
her in mind, that besides the circumstances
not being altered in regard to her, she had
received my solemn promise, that, whenever
it was in my power, I would use my
whole influence (whatever that might be)
in her favour.  I did make her such a
promise, and shall fulfil it to the utmost.

<pb n="313"/>
</p>
<p>Mr. Faulkland's absence from the kingdom
hitherto put it out of my power;
nor would I, without my beloved Mr. Arnold's
participation, have ever attempted
it.  Had he lived, fully restored as I was
to his confidence and good opinion, I
should have ventured to disclose the secret
to him, and got him to join with me in
such measures as I should have thought
best for Miss Burchell's happiness.  It now
rests upon myself alone, and I will leave
nothing unattempted to serve her.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 22.&mdash;You will be surprized perhaps,
my Cecilia, when I tell you that
Mr. Faulkland is now in England.  Miss
Burchell told me so this day.  She mentioned
it in a careless manner, rather directing
her discourse to my mother.  She
had too much delicacy to hint at consequences
of any kind from this circumstance,
and quickly turned from the subject.
My mother asked her impatiently,
when he came; where he was; and several
other questions; to none of which she
could give any answer, but that she heard

<pb n="314"/>
he had been returned above three months,
and was at his seat in Hertfordshire.  I
am surprized Sir George never mentioned
this to me: to be sure he knew it; he is
not extremely nice in his notions; however,
this is a decorum for which I am
obliged to him.  Lady V&mdash; doubtless
was ignorant of it, or she would have
told me.
</p>
<p>There is nothing now to prevent me
from warmly interfering for Miss Burchell.
Charming young woman, how is
she to be pitied!  The tedious years of suspence,
of almost hopeless love, that she
has passed, deserve a recompence; and her
little boy, my mother tells me, is a lovely
creature.  Miss Burchell brought him
once to see my mother; Mr. Faulkland's
former house-keeper visits the child often,
and has brought his mother frequent and
large supplies for his use.
</p>
<p>I told Miss Burchell at parting to-day,
that I had not forgot my promise: and
that, as soon as decency would permit,
nothing should hinder me from being a
most strenuous advocate for her.  She

<pb n="315"/>
squeezed my hand, and whispered, dear
madam, my fate is in your power.
</p>
<p>I would it were, then should she soon
be happy.  But I will acquit myself as far
as I am able.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 23.&mdash;I was prevailed on to
dine at my brother's to-day; the first
time that I have been abroad ever since I
came to town.  I had no mind to go; but
my mother, not being well, had excused
herself; and she said, it would be taken
amiss if I did so too, lady Sarah, herself
having made the invitation.  Her
ladyship said, I need not be fearful of
meeting strangers at her house, as it was
to be a private day.  So much the better,
thought I; nothing else should induce me
to go.
</p>
<p>It was the first time I was in Sir
George's house, which is a very magnificent
one, within a door or two of Mr.
Faulkland's, in St. James's-square, as
lady Sarah did not approve of that which
he had before.  But, my dear, the ostentation
of this woman made me sick; such

<pb n="316"/>
a parade of grandeur, such an unnecessary
display of state and splendor, I thought,
looked like an insult upon me.  I was
carried into a most sumptuous drawing-room; but as this was a private day, as
she called it, the furniture was all covered
up with body cloths: and the room,
having been newly washed, felt extremely
cold.
</p>
<p>I was told her ladyship was dressing,
though it was then, as I imagined, her
dinner-time.  After I had shivered here
for about half an hour, lady Sarah's woman
came to desire me to walk up stairs.
As the woman did not know me, and
from the little ceremony she saw me
treated with, concluded I was some humble
visitor, she took me up the back stairs
to her lady's dressing-room, where I found
lady Sarah, who was not yet half dressed,
in consultation with her millener.  The woman
was trying some head-dresses on her
before the glass.  She made me a very
light apology for having kept me waiting
so long; and, to mend the matter,
told me, as she was not near ready, if I

<pb n="317"/>
chose looking at the house, I should have
time enough to do it before dinner.  I
thanked her; but said, I had already sat
so long in the cold, that I felt myself chilled;
and, with her ladyship's permission,
would place myself at her fire-side till dinner
was ready.  She asked her woman carelessly,
why I had not been shewn into the
dining-parlour.  She then turned to her
millener again, to whom she gave a particular
charge to have a suit of very rich
point, which she had fixed on, done up for
her against the next night; by which I
found my sister was going to throw off
her mourning intirely; that which she
had on being so slight, that it was scarcely
to be distinguished for such.
</p>
<p>My brother entered the room while she
was thus employed; and having saluted
me, looked at his watch, and asked lady
Sarah, had she ordered dinner later than
usual?  She told him, she had ordered it
half an hour later than ordinary, as she
had a mind to make a long morning,
having dedicated it to trades-people,
with whom she ad a hundred things to

<pb n="318"/>
settle.  My brother cast a side glance at
me: I thought he looked a little abashed
at the impertinence and ill-breeding of his
wife.
</p>
<p>Lady Sarah had by this time huddled
on her cloaths: a laced footman appeared
at the door, who summoned us by a silent
bow to dinner.
</p>
<p>The millener gathered up her frippery
and put them into a band-box; telling
her, she would wait on her ladyship again.
Lady Sarah answered, You have a monstrous
way to go, Mrs.&mdash; (I forget the
name); and, as I have not half done with
you yet, you may stay and dine here, as
we are alone, and I will look over the rest
of the things in the evening, as I shall
not have another leisure day while I am in
town.
</p>
<p>This was going a little too far: Sir
George felt it.  I believe, lady Sarah,
said he, this gentlewoman has a coach
waiting for her at the door (he had seen
it, for he was but just come in); perhaps
it may be inconvenient to detain her; she
may leave the things, and call another

<pb n="319"/>
time.  The woman took the hint, though
she before seemed inclined to accept of the
honour lady Sarah had done her.  She
made her curt'sey, and withdrew.  As
this, however, had brought on a variety
of fresh instructions, it detained us so
long, that the dinner was quite cold; nor
was our repast, had it even been warm,
by any means answerable to the elegance
of the service, the superb sideboard, and
the number of attendants.  In short, the
dinner was composed of a parcel of tossed-up dishes, that looked like the fragments
of a feast.  You know there is nobody
more indifferent to the pleasures of the
table than I am; yet I own that this,
joined to the rest of this foolish woman's
behaviour, nettled me extremely.  There
was such a mixture of sordidness and vanity
in the whole apparatus, as made it
truly contemptible.
</p>
<p>I made haste to put an end to my visit,
as soon as I possibly could after dinner,
with a resolution never to repeat it.
</p>
<p>From these few sketches of lady Sarah,
you may form some kind of an idea of

<pb n="320"/>
what sort of a creature it is.  I should
pity Sir George, but that I think her disposition
is not extremely opposite to his
own.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 24.&mdash;I am told that the widow
Arnold is actually married to that vile attorney
who was the contriver, and more
than partner in her iniquity.  I am really
glad she has lost the name of a family to
which she was a disgrace.  Every-body
now believes that I and my children have
been greatly injured; but how unavailing
is compassion; it only mortifies, when it
is expressed by the pitying words and looks
of people, who have it neither in their
power nor inclination to assist you.  This
Mrs. Arnold, bad as she is, is visited and
caressed.  Favour always follows the fortunate.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 25.&mdash;This day Sir George and
his lady set out for Scotland.  He came
to take his leave of us; but made an apology
for lady Sarah, whose hurry would
not permit her to call on us.  My brother

<pb n="321"/>
says, they shall stay some months at her
uncle's, lord K&mdash;.  He told me, at
parting, he should write to me as soon as
he got to his journey's end, having something
very particular to say to me.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 7.&mdash;I have read over my journal
of the last fortnight, and am startled to
think what a poor insignificant being I
am.  Not a single act worth recording, even
to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>.  My whole life perhaps may have
passed so; yet one is apt to fancy that they
are doing something of importance, while
they are engaged in the little bustle of the
world, be it in ever so trifling a manner;
and when you find you have a variety of
incidents to relate, in which you yourself
were concerned, that your time has not
been spent in vain.  But for these last
fourteen days, had I kept a journal for
my cat, I think I should have had as
much to say for her.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 8.&mdash;I shall grow busy again: I
have received the promised letter from Sir
George; an extraordinary one it is: but

<pb n="322"/>
I will not anticipate the contents; read
them yourself.
</p>
<p>Dear Sidney,</p>
<p></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi>4, 1706.
</p>
<p>I have a serious subject to offer to your
consideration, which made me the rather
choose to engage your attention in this
manner, than in a conversation between
ourselves; liable as that would be to interruptions,
objections, and frivolous punctilios,
from which you have already suffered
so severely.
</p>
<p>I have paid so much regard to that decorum
of which you are so fond, as never
to have mentioned Mr. Faulkland's name
to you since you were become a widow,
though it is near four months since he returned
to England.
</p>
<p>As I kept up a correspondence with
him when he was abroad, you may be sure
I informed him of your reconciliation to
your late husband; a reconciliation which,
if you thought it a happiness to you, you
were indebted to Faulkland for.  This
single circumstance it was that inclined
him to return to England, which otherwise

<pb n="323"/>
perhaps he would never again have
seen, though the necessity of his affairs
here, which he had left at random, required
his presence.  To avoid giving
umbrage to your husband, he repaired
privately to his house in the country,
where I paid him a visit.l  Few of his
friends, except myself, knew of his being
in the kingdom.
</p>
<p>Remember, Sidney, the great obligations
you have to Mr. Faulkland, and let
that prepare your mind for what I am going
to say.
</p>
<p>You are now become a free woman:
Faulkland loves you still, with an unparallel'd
affection.  I had a letter from
him soon after your arrival in town,
wherein he mentions the revival of his
hopes from your present situation, and
intreats me to be mindful of his interest.
He charged me, however, not to mention
his name to you, till a decent time was
passed; otherwise probably you would
have been acquainted with these particulars
sooner: but Faulkland himself has
a little too much of that ridiculous nicety

<pb n="324"/>
which you admire so.  I think I have
waited till a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> decent time, as you have
now been almost three months a widow.
</p>
<p>I have very little reason to imagine that
<hi rend="italic">my</hi>influence, on this occasion, will have
any weight either with you or my mother:
I have had proofs of this already; but
I hope you will not be so blind to your
own interest, as to refuse the good that
fortune once more throws at your feet.  I
can hardly suppose you so weak, as to let
the absurd objection, which formerly prevented
your happiness, still prevail with
you to reject the same happiness, so unexpectedly
again offered to your acceptance.
</p>
<p>My mother and you have by this time
learnt how to forgive <hi rend="italic">human frailties</hi>.  Indeed
you forgave such enormities, that
Faulkland's transgression, in comparison
of them, was innocence.  But I will not
reproach the memory of the dead.
</p>
<p>Whatever pretence yo might formerly
have had to carry your punctilios to an extraordinary
height, certain circumstances
in your life have now made your situation

<pb n="325"/>
very different.  You are destitute of fortune,
incumbered with children.  Reflect
on this, and let your own imagination
supply the rest.  To any-body but yourself,
I should think all that I have said
needless; but I know the minds that I
have to deal with.
</p>
<p>I must take this opportunity of telling
you, that I am surprized at my mother's
continued attachment to Miss Burchell;
she is an artful creature, and, I think, by
no means a proper acquaintance for you.
I am far from wishing to injure her; but
such an intimacy may be dangerous.
</p>
<p>You will certainly hear from Faulkland
before it be long.  I repeat it again, You
owe him more than ever you will be able
to repay: the recompence he desires will
ensure your own happiness and prosperity:
your gratitude, as well as your prudence,
will now be put to the test, and your conduct,
on this occasion, will determine me
as to the light in which I shall henceforth
consider you.
</p>
<p>Present my duty to my mother.  Lady
Sarah desires her service may be accepted.
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.

<pb n="326"/>
</p>
<p>What a letter is this, my sister!  But,
Sir George is still himself; gross; void of
sentiment: he dreams of nothing but the
glaring advantages that fortune and rank
in life procure.  And how he argues too!
Weak Arguer!  He <hi rend="italic">will not suppose that the
objection</hi> (absurd he calls it) <hi rend="italic">which formerly
prevented my happiness, should still prevail
with me to reject the same happiness</hi>&mdash;Why
not?  Is the nature of Mr. Faulkland's offence
changed?  Has he ever repaired it?
Has not Miss Burchell the same claim she
ever had?  Nay, a stronger than ever, if
years of unabated love can give it her?
<hi rend="italic">My mother and I have by this time learnt to
forgive human frailties; nay, we forgave
enormities</hi>&mdash;Unkind brother, to rake up
the unfortunate ashes of my beloved.  We
have, indeed, learnt to forgive human
frailties; but they were the frailties of
a husband, a repenting husband, who was
seduced to the commission of those crimes
which he abhorred: but surely that is no
pleas for my overlooking the faults of another,
to whom I am under no such tie.
I am now <hi rend="italic">without fortune, and incumbered</hi>

<pb n="327"/>
<hi rend="italic">with children</hi>.  Indelicate man! does he
think <hi rend="italic">that</hi> an argument in favour of his
proposal? it is a strong one against it.
Shall I, who, when I was in the virgin-bloom of you, flattered with some advantages
of person, which time and grief
have since impaired, and not destitute of
fortune; I, who then rejected Mr. Faulkland
from motives which still subsist; shall
I, now that I have lost those advantages,
meanly condescend to accept of this rejected
man?  This would, indeed, be acknowleging,
that the humiliating change
had levelled me to those principles which I
formerly condemned; would lay me under
mortifying obligations to Mr. Faulkland,
and destroy the merit of that refusal which
proceeded from such justifiable motives.
</p>
<p>No, my sordid brother! if I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> recompence
Mr. Faulkland as he deserves at
my hands, I <hi rend="italic">would</hi> do it; but, with such
a mind as I bear, it cannot be done your
way.  I say nothing of the promise I made
Miss Burchell; if I had never made her
such, my sentiments would be the same
from those other considerations; but such

<pb n="328"/>
a promise, binding as it is, determines
my conduct beyond the possibility of a
doubt.
</p>
<p>How unreasonable are Sir George's prejudices
with regard to this unhappy young
creature!  He is for ever throwing out
some invective against her.  It is cruel;
but I am tempted to forgive him, as I
know it proceeds from his attachment to
his friend.  He need not put me in mind
of the gratitude I owe Mr. Faulkland; I
am thoroughly sensible of it; but Sir
George and I differ widely in our ideas of
expressing this gratitude.  My <hi rend="italic">conduct in
this affair is to determine him as to the light
in which he is hereafter to consider me</hi>.
Why, be it so.  He has long lost the
tenderness of a brother for me; I will not
regain it at the expence of my honour.  I
know the worst that can befal me is poverty.
I have already experienced almost
every possible ill in life but that, and for
that I am prepared.  But I will not call
myself poor while I have an upright
heart to support me; and the means, poor
and despicable as they are, of sustaining

<pb n="329"/>
life.  But what do I call despicable?  Have
I not an estate, my dear, a whole fifty
pounds a year, that I can call my own?
This much was reserved to me out of my
jointure when the rest was sold; and on
this, whenever it pleases heaven to take
my mother away, will I retire to some cottage
in a cheap country, where my two
children and I will live, and smile at the
rich and the great.
</p>
<p>My brother's letter has vexed and disgusted
me exceedingly.  <hi rend="italic">Lady Sarah presents
her service</hi>.  Vain woman! is that a
becoming phrase to the mother of her husband?
I am so provoked, I think I shall
not answer her: he has no relish for such
arguments as I could produce in support
of my own opinions, and my writing to
him would only bring on disagreeable altercations.
My mother is in a downright
passion with him: Selfish wretch! she called
him; and said, he would sacrifice both
honour and justice to his own pride.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 19.&mdash;Miss Burchell; poor soul,
how I pity her!  Her anxiety increases

<pb n="330"/>
every hour.  She, you may be sure, keeps
a look-out on all Mr. Faulkland's motions;
for, she tells me, she hears he is
arrived in town.  I suppose I shall receive
a notice of some kind or other from him.
The unhappy girl! she grieves me to see
her!  There never was so extravagant a
love as her's: she has nourished it in solitude,
and I believe has a heart naturally
tender to an uncommon degree; otherwise
she could not, for so long a time, and
with so little hopes, have preserved so undiminished
a fondness; but some accidents
have, I know not how, combined
to feed this flame.  She acknowleges that
Mr. Faulkland's being disappointed in espousing
me, gave the first encouragement
to her hopes; for, she said, she had reason
to believe that I was the only woman
in the world that stood between her and
her happiness; and Mr. Faulkland's remaining
single ever since, confirmed her
in that opinion.  Then the generous attention
that he paid to her welfare, in recommending
her to my mother's notice,
when he first left England; the noble

<pb n="331"/>
supplies that he constantly furnished her
with ever since for the child's use; his
behaviour to Mrs. Gerrarde, who, she
says, is the most ensnaring of creatures;
the tender manner that he mentioned her
in his letter to my brother; my mother's
constantly indulging her in the belief that
she would one day recover Mr. Faulkland's
affections: all these circumstances,
I say, joined together, have kept alive
the warmest and most romantic love I ever
saw or heard of.  Well may the men say,
that forsaken women are always the most
passionate lovers: it may be so, and Miss
Burchell is one instance of the truth of
this observation; but I think <hi rend="italic">I</hi> should never
make another.  There is something to
me unaccountable in this; but Miss Burchell
is all made up of languishments and
softness.  I have heard her speak of Mr.
Faulkland in so rapturous a strain as has
amazed me; and she once owned to me,
that she is sure she must have died, if he
had not returned her love.  Return it!
Ah, my Cecilia, how did he return it?
How mortifying is her situation! to be

<pb n="332"/>
compelled to court the man who flies her,
and to make use of a rival's mediation
too! but let me forget that name; I am
no longer so to her, and shall do my best
to prove it.  She wearied me with importunities
to write to Mr. Faulkland now he
is come to town; but I beseeched her to
have a little patience, till some overture
was first made by him toward a renewal
of our acquaintance, which, I told her,
it was very probable I should soon receive.
You may be sure I took care not to let
her know of the intimation I had from
Sir George.  She seems fearful of my seeing
Mr. Faulkland.  Oh, madam! said
she, if he beholds your face again, I am
undone, unless you can first prevail with
him&mdash;She stopped.  'I understand you,
dear Miss Burchell; I give you my word
I will not see Mr. Faulkland, unless I
am first convinced I can restore him to
you.'  'How good you are, madam!
your influence, all potent as it is, can
work miracles.  If Mr. Faulkland is
<hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you never will be his, perhaps he
may return to his <hi rend="italic">first</hi> love.'  My dear,

<pb n="333"/>
ought she have said so?  But it is no
matter; it is nothing to me now, who was
his first or second love.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 20.&mdash;It has happened to my wish;
a billet from Mr. Faulkland, sent with
compliments and how-do-ye's, to my mother
and me.  Miss Burchell, who almost
lives with us, was present when I received
it: her colour came and went several
times while our servant delivered his message.
I gave the letter into her hand as
soon as I had read it.  There is nothing
alarming in it, madam, said I; see yourself;
only a few friendly lines, such as I
might expect.  Her hands shook while
she held the paper.  Now, madam, said
she, returning it; now you have a charming
opportunity of writing to him.  I shall
not fail, said I, to make use of it, and will
let you see what I write.
</p>
<p>These are the contents of Mr. Faulkland's
letter:
</p>
<p>Will you, madam, permit a forgotten
though not the least zealous of your
friends, to inquire after your welfare.

<pb n="334"/>
Forgive me, if I renew your grief, when
I tell you, that, as I must participate in
every thing that relates to you, I have
deeply mourned with you on the late calamity
that has befallen you.  When lady
Bidulph opens her doors to her general
acquaintance, if I may presume to mingle
in the crowd, and kiss her hands, I shall
esteem it as a particular honour; but will
not, without her permission, attempt it.
She is too good to refuse me this indulgence:
you, madam, I hope, will not
forbid it to
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The humblest, and
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most devoted of your servants,
<hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi></p>
<p></p>
<p>ORLANDO FAULKLAND.
  <hi rend="italic">morning</hi>.
</p>
<p>Yes, Orlando, I must forbid you; I know
the consequences of thy insidious visits.
I'll try you to the quick.  You have given
me an opportunity of writing to you (I
think) without any impropriety.  Miss
Burchell's interest is uppermost in my
mind, and I will at least try what my influence

<pb n="335"/>
on this romantic wayward heart
can effect.
</p>
<p>How happy should I think myself, if <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
mediation, <hi rend="italic">all potent</hi> as she called it,
would have the desired success.
</p>
<p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 21.&mdash;I wrote to Mr. Faulkland
last night: my mother approved of the
letter, which I shewed her before I sent it.
Mr. Faulkland was abroad when it was left
at his house; but as I received an answer to
it early this morning, I will give you copies
of the two letters together.
</p>
<p>I thank you, Sir, that you from my
heart, for your friendship, and beg you
will not think my ungrateful for having
thus long deferred to pay you my acknowlegements
for the signal favours I have received
at your hands.  I am sensible, Sir,
that it was owing to your compassion, your
generosity and disinterested nobleness of
mind, that I was once indebted for the
greatest blessing of my life.  To you I
owe the vindicating of my suspected faith,
and the being restored to the affection of

<pb n="336"/>
my dear husband.  For this goodness I
have never ceased to bless and pray for
you, and shall continue to do so while I
live.  But oh, Sir! while you have given
<hi rend="italic">me</hi> so much cause for gratitude and esteem,
why will you leave one heart to sigh for
your unkindness?  a heart that admires,
that loves, that adores you! a heart worthy
of your acceptance, and which has a
right to demand all your tenderness.  Need
I name the possessor of this heart?
I need not; there is but one woman in the
world who owns this description: for her
let me become an advocate; she has won
me to her party: indeed, Sir, she, and
she only, deserves your love.  Her's, I am
sure, you have ever possessed unrivalled,
though her youth, her beauty, and charming
accomplishments, must have made
her the object of every one's wishes who
saw her.  'Tis above three years since you
first won her virgin affections.  What has
been her portion since that fatal time?
Tears, solitude, and unremitting anguish.
How can a mind like yours, susceptible
as it is of pity for the woes of others,

<pb n="337"/>
condemn <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a woman to perpetual sorrow?
How can that generosity, which has
been so active on other occasions, droop
and languish where there is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a cause to
call forth all its exertions?
</p>
<p>Do, Mr. Faulkland, permit pity to
plead in your bosom for the dear Miss
Burchell.  I should urge paternal affection
too; but to the voice of nature you cannot
be deaf.  Your sweet little son calls
upon you to do him and his mother justice;
the injured lady herself implores
your compassion; my mother, who equally
admires and loves her, intreats you; I,
whom you once esteemed, conjure you;
the secret monitor in your own soul must
join in our solicitations.  Why then, why
will you shut your ears against the united
voice of reason, of conscience, and of gratitude?
You cannot, you will not do it.
Miss Burchell's merit and sufferings must
be rewarded; and I shall bless Mr. Faulkland
as the guardian of the injured, the
patron of the afflicted, the assertor of his
own, as well as of my honour.  This is
the light, and this only, in which I shall
rejoice to see him.

<p></p>
<p><hi rend="italic">Mr</hi>. FAULKLAND'S <hi rend="italic">Answer</hi>.
</p>
<p>You do well, madam, you do well to
anticipate my suit; and with so much
cruel eloquence to bid me despair.  Yes,
I see Miss Burchell has won you to her
party; but what have I done to merit
such a malevolent fate, that <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, you of
all created beings, should become <hi rend="italic">her</hi> advocate?
I little thought Mrs. Arnold
would make such a barbarous use of her
power.  Tell me, thou dear tyrant, how
have I deserved this?  Would it not have
been kinder to have said at once, Faulkland,
do not hope; I never will be yours;
I hate, I despise you, and leave you to
your fate?  Oh, no! you are artful in
your cruelty; you would prevent even my
wishes, and cut off my hopes in their
blossom, before they dare to unfold themselves
to you.
</p>
<p>But you have furnished me with weapons
against yourself, and I will use them
with as little mercy as you have shewn to
me.  If three years are past since I won
Miss Burchell's affections, is it not also <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
long that I have loved you with an ardor&mdash;

<pb n="339"/>
Oh thou insensible!  Were you not mine by
your own consent, with your mother's
approbation?  Was not the day, the hour
fixed, that I was to have led you to the
altar; Miss Burchell's hopes were never
raised to such a pitch as mine, when an
avenging fiend snatched the promised
blessing from my grasp.  Think what were
then my sufferings!  I saw you afterwards
in the arms of another.  Miss Burchell
never suffered <hi rend="italic">such</hi> torture.  Had I seen
you <hi rend="italic">happy</hi>, I might have been consoled.
If Miss Burchell loved me as I have loved
you, she would rejoice in the prospect of
my felicity.  I should have done so in
your's, heaven is my witness!  Had you
been happy, I should not have thought
myself miserable, though you were lost to
my hopes.
</p>
<p>Why do you compel me to urge an
ungrateful truth in regard to Miss Burchell?
Madam, she has no claim to my
vows: my gratitude, my compassion, she
has an ample right o, and she has them.
More might by this time have been her's,
if I had never seen Mrs. Arnold.

<pb n="340"/>
</p>
<p>Remember, I do not yet desire permission
to throw myself at your feet; I revere
you too much to make such a request;
but do not banish me your presence.
I cannot always be proof against
such rigours.  Indulge me at least in the
hope that time may do something in my
favour.  I will not desire you to tell me
so; but do not forbid it.  Lady Bidulph
knows I respect her; but she is still obdurate.
If <hi rend="italic">she</hi> relented, would not <hi rend="italic">you</hi>,
madam, do so too?
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>How this man distresses me, my dear!
What a difficult task have I undertaken!
yet I will go through with it.  I am fearful
of letting Miss Burchell see this answer,
so discouraging as it is for her; yet how
can I with-hold it from her sight?  'Tis necessary
I should conceal nothing from her
on this occasion; she confides in me, and
I must not give her cause for suspicion.
<hi rend="italic">She has no right to his vows</hi>.  This he
always said.  It is necessary the lady should
be quite explicit with me.  I doubt she

<pb n="341"/>
has not been altogether sincere in what she
has said to my mother on this subject.  I
shall see her presently, and discourse with
her more particularly on this head than I
have ever yet done. . . . . . .
</p>
<p>I have had a conference with Miss
Burchell, a long one, and in private; for
I told my mother I wished to talk with her
alone.
</p>
<p>I began with shewing her Mr. Faulkland's
last letter.  It had the effect I expected.
She was exceedingly shocked.  I
laid my finger on that paragraph, <hi rend="italic">She has
no right to my vows</hi>.  It is necessary, my
dear madam, said I, that you should be
perfectly open and candid with me on this
head.  I have entered the lists for you,
and will not give up your cause; but it
depends on you to furnish me with every
possible argument in your favour.  If you
mislead me by wrong insinuations, instead
of putting it in my power to serve you,
you will only create to yourself fresh obstacles.
</p>
<p>It is a nice subject, madam, and what
I have ever been cautious of touching

<pb n="342"/>
upon to you; but in the present situation
of your affairs, it is of the utmost importance
to you, that you should have no reserves
to me.  When Mr. Faulkland first
recommended you to my mother's acquaintance,
he referred her to your honour
for an explanation of certain points,
of so delicate a nature, that I am loath to
touch upon them.  But, pardon me,
dear Miss Burchell, you must be open
with me.  Mr. Faulkland was obliged to
declare, in his own justification, that he
never sought to gain your affections; and
was so far from endeavouring to take advantage
of the kind sentiments you had
for him, that he avoided all opportunities
of improving them; that he was even
surprized into the fatal step, which has
since made you so unhappy, by the artifices
of that vile woman, who had the care
of you.
</p>
<p>Mr. Faulkland relied so entirely on
your candour, that, as I told you before,
he referred my mother to you for a confirmation
of the truth of what he advanced;
imagining that your testimony

<pb n="343"/>
would in some measure extenuate his
fault.  My mother, I have reason to believe,
has heard the story from you in a
light less favourable to Mr. Faulkland.
I was married before she received any information
on this subject from you; and
as any extenuation of Mr. Faulkland's
side was then become a matter of indifference
to me, I inquired not into particulars;
but by what I could judge from
my mother's discourse then, and from
hints which she has many times dropped
since, I am inclined to believe, that either
Mr. Faulkland concealed some particulars,
or that you, from a delicacy very
natural to a young lady in such circumstances,
chose to draw a veil over some
parts of your story.  But, dear madam,
all disguises must now be thrown aside;
depend upon it, your candour will more
effectually recommend you to Mr. Faulkland's
esteem, than any thing else; and
perhaps your justifying him to <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, may
be no immaterial circumstance in your
favour.
</p>
<p>Variety of passions discovered themselves

<pb n="344"/>
on her face while I spoke, but
shame was predominant.  She was mute,
and hung down her head.  I took her by
the hand, Do not think, my dear, I
mean to ensnare you; far be such perfidy
from my heart!  Have I not promised you
my assistance?  I declare, by every thing
that is sacred, you shall have it to the utmost
stretch of my power; but do not let
a false bashfulness stand between you and
sincerity; you will stop up the way to
your own happiness if you do.  Speak,
dear madam, has Mr. Faulkland been
just in his representations?
</p>
<p>She burst into a flood of tears: Oh,
madam, you read my very soul! what
disguise can I make use of before such
penetrating eyes as yours?  Yes, Mr.
Faulkland <hi rend="italic">has</hi> spoke the truth; shameful
as the confession is for me, I own it.
Mrs. Gerrarde, base woman! betrayed
me; my own mad passion did the rest.
Mr. Faulkland told me, a few days after
the fatal evening, that he was the most
miserable man on earth for what had
happened: he said, there was a lady in

<pb n="345"/>
the world to whom he was bound to offer
his hand; that her brother was his
particular friend; that his marriage was
then actually negotiating; and he was
pressed on that occasion to return to London.
He owned he had never seen the
lady, but as his honour was engaged to
her brother, he could not look upon himself
as a free man.  He cursed his ill fate,
that he had not had an opportunity of
informing me of this sooner; which, he
said, might have prevented me from casting
away my affection on a man who
could not deserve it.  What could I say,
madam?  There was no room for reproaches
or complaints.  I made none; I
had nobody to accuse but myself.  I had
declared my frantic love to Mr. Faulkland
unasked: I had implored his in return:
in one dreadful moment I fell a sacrifice
to my own weakness.  The only hope
that now remained for me, was built on
that circumstance of Mr. Faulkland's
having never seen his destined bride.  Had
I know you, madam, to have been the
person, there could have sprung but small

<pb n="346"/>
comfort from that consideration; but ignorant
as I was of the lady's merit, I
thought it not impossible but that some
objection might have arisen either to her
person or temper; or the lady, perhaps
(though that I thought almost incredible)
might not approve of Mr. Faulkland:
in either case, some glimmerings of
hope remained for me, Mr. Faulkland's
generous compassion for me, gave me
room to think he did not hate me, and I
was unwilling to lose the little interest I
thought I had gained in his heart, by
<hi rend="italic">fond complainings</hi>, much less upbraidings,
for which he had given me no cause.  I
therefore acquiesced, determined to wait
for what my fate was to do with me; resolving
privately in my own mind, that
in case Mr. Faulkland's intended nuptials
should not take place, to remind him of
my love.  I did not confess to my aunt
what had been the result of that interview,
which she had contrived between Mr.
Faulkland and me: shame would not suffer
me to divulge it.  But it was not long
in my power to conceal it: to believe indeed,

<pb n="347"/>
she suspected it before.  She reproached
me for the error which she herself
had caused; but I believe, what most
nettled her was, Mr. Faulkland's having
escaped the snare; for I am sure she would
have been base enough to have had me
retain him as a lover, though I could not
secure him for a husband; for he was not
the first, that this bad woman would have
seduced me to favour, for her own private
interest.
</p>
<p>In the midst of the horror into which
the condition I found myself in threw
me, I heard that Mr. Faulkland was on
the point of being married.
</p>
<p>The prospect I had before me drove
me to despair.  I knew I could not remain
long in my uncle's house.  I knew
not whither to fly.  In my distraction I
wrote to Mr. Faulkland: You, madam,
saw the letter, that ill-fated letter, which
deprived Mr. Faulkland of his happiness.
</p>
<p>I soon received an answer, wherein Mr.
Faulkland related to me at large the unfortunate
consequences that letter had produced.
He lamented, in the tenderest

<pb n="348"/>
manner, my unhappy situation; told me,
he would provide me a proper place for
my retreat; and, as I was an intire stranger
in London, having never been there,
would recommend me to the notice of one
of the best of women, lady Bidulph,
from whom, as my unhappy story was
known to her, I might expect the utmost
humanity.  And here, madam, with blushes
let me own it, he urged me not to conceal
a single circumstance of the truth from
that lady.
</p>
<p>'You know, said he, my dear Miss
Burchell, I am not a <hi rend="italic">seducer</hi>; rescue me
from that black suspicion; and, as far
as the unhappy case will admit, clear
my honour to lady Bidulph.  See what
a reliance I have on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> honour, when
I trust the vindicating of my own to
you, in such delicate circumstances.  He
concluded his letter with telling me
frankly, that though he had been rejected
by Miss Bidulph, he loved her
with such an ardent passion, that it was
impossible for him ever to think of any
other woman; and till he had a heart

<pb n="349"/>
to bestow, he should never entertain a
thought of marriage.'
</p>
<p>You known Mr. Faulkland at this
juncture went abroad; and thus was I
circumstanced when I came to that house
which he had provided for me.  And so
frank and noble were his proceedings,
that I solemnly declare, I was determined,
though at the hazard of divulging my
own shame, to have acquitted him to the
utmost of my power to lady Bidulph;
and should have rejoiced, could I have
been the means of procuring him the
happiness he deserved, in regaining your
favour; as I had been, though unknowingly,
the unlucky cause of his losing it.
But fortune had disposed of you otherwise
before I saw lady Bidulph.  This
she quickly informed me of, and I will
own to you, madam, that as I found there
was now an insuperable bar to Mr. Faulkland's
hopes, I was mean enough not to
have the courage to speak truth.  I saw
it could not avail him, in regard to his
prospects with you.  Lady Bidulph's eye
awed me; yet I think she led me into a

<pb n="350"/>
justification of myself, so great were her
prejudices against Mr. Faulkland.  Or,
perhaps, having already disposed of you
in marriage, in vindication of this step,
she did not wish to be undeceived.  Yes,
again, in spite of my confusion, I must
repeat it, I was not sincere; I threw out
such hints to lady Bidulph, as must have
made her think Mr. Faulkland had taken
pains to undo me: to this act of disingenuousness,
my sole motive was, that I might
appear inn a less culpable light in the eyes of
a lady of such strict virtue as your mother.
By making her my friend, I was in hopes
one day of making you so too.  Devoted,
as Mr. Faulkland was, to the
most charming woman in the world,
I was not afraid of his making a second
choice.  I thought, if he <hi rend="italic">were</hi> to be induced
to marry, he might, in time, be
prevailed upon to turn his thoughts towards
me.  In this hope I have dragged
on so many tedious years.  I was not mistaken
in my opinion, that he could find
none worthy to succeed Mrs. Arnold in
his heart.  He loves you still, madam;

<pb n="351"/>
but you have declared you never will be
his; he is still free; these are the circumstances
that nourish my hope.  My heart
is in your hand; I have made you mistress
of my dearest secret.  Can you forgive
me, madam?  But you have an heroic
soul!  Remember, Mrs. Arnold, to
your generosity I now trust what is dearer
to me than life.  Should Mr. Faulkland
know, should lady Bidulph know, how I
have abused their confidence, I think I
could not out-live it.
</p>
<p>They never shall, madam, said I: I
thank you for this frank acknowlegement
of your heart; such a proof of your confidence
in me, I should be a wretch to
abuse; and I hope to make such a use of
the candid confession you have now made
me, as will greatly promote your interest.
</p>
<p>And is it possible, madam, said she,
you can yield up the interest you have in
Mr. Faulkland without a pang?  Oh,
the exquisite charmer! and she said it with
such an emphasis, drawing out her breath
in long sighs.  But you are heroic, as I

<pb n="352"/>
said before: Nature did not mold your
heart, as she has done those of the rest of
your sex.  Who that was beloved by Mr.
Faulkland, would yield him to another?
Worlds! ten thousand worlds would I
give to be beloved by him as you are!
but you are a prodigy of a woman!  I
stopped Miss Burchell in her transports.
There is less merit, madam, than you
ascribe to me in my conduct: I readily
acquiesced under my mother's rejection of
Mr. Faulkland, when he <hi rend="italic">had</hi> some interest
in my heart; but there is no self-denial
in what I am now about to do for you.
My affections have long since changed
their object, and now lie buried with him
in his grave.
</p>
<p>My tears here bore witness to the truth
of what I said: Miss Burchell wept too.
Her mind was agitated; the confession
she had made to me had humbled her;
her heart overflowed with fondness; I
had filled her with pleasing hopes: all
these sensations combined together, melted
her into tenderness: she is made up of
tears, and sighs, and romantic wishes.

<pb n="353"/>
</p>
<p>I can now, said I, assure Mr. Faulkland,
that you have done him justice, and that
he is highly obliged to your candour.
</p>
<p>She interrupted me; But, madam, if
he should know how <hi rend="italic">late</hi> my acknowlegements
came&mdash;He need not know it,
said I; my mother shall not know it neither;
leave every thing to my management,
and depend upon my word.  She
snatched my hand eagerly, and kissed it.
</p>
<p>But oh, madam! above all things, said
she, let not Sir George Bidulph know
any thing of your intended goodness in
mediating for me.  He hates me, implacably
he hates me.  I upbraid him not
for it: his strong attachment to Mr.
Faulkland is the cause of it: he accuses
me in his heart of being the occasion
(which I own I was, though ignorantly)
of Mr. Faulkland's disappointment.  I
am sure, were he to know what you design
in my favour, he would counterwork
you, and use all his influence over his
friend to ruin me.
</p>
<p>I made her easy on this head, by assuring
her Sir George should know nothing

<pb n="354"/>
of the matter; and put her in mind now
lucky it was for her that he was absent.
</p>
<p>I cannot help thinking, my Cecilia, that
there is a sort of a fatality has attended
Mr. Faulkland's attachment to me.  By
what a strange accident did we come to
the knowledge of Miss Burchell's affair!
How strong were my mother's prepossessions
against Mr. Faulkland; and how
many little circumstances concurred to
encourage her in this disposition!  His
letter from Bath to my brother helped to
confirm her in her dislike of his conduct;
Miss Burchell's letter to Mr. Faulkland,
though meant very differently, was a
strong motive of condemnation.  The
only means of justification left for him
my mother did not apply to, till it was
too late; and then that very circumstance
of its <hi rend="italic">being</hi> too late to serve him, Miss
Burchell acknowleges, was the reason that
the very method which he had proposed
for his defence, was turned to his condemnation.
</p>
<p>Rooted, as my mother's prejudices
were, she engages herself, she engages me,

<pb n="355"/>
in a promise, to use my endeavours to
promote Miss Burchell's marriage with
Mr. Faulkland.  Does not all this look
as if some unseen power, who guides
our actions, had set a stamp of disapprobation
on the union between this man
and me.
</p>
<p>I wish I had seen that letter which Mrs.
Faulkland wrote to my brother from
Bath: my mother said, she did not read it
through.  He treated the subject lightly,
and there was one circumstance in particular
in it that shocked her; and yet surely
if the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> might not have borne a favourable
construction, Sir George would
not have shewn her that account, by way
of justifying his friend.  This reflection
comes too late!  Why did it not occur
sooner to my mother or to me?  We drew
no other inference from Sir George's disclosing
this letter, than that as Mr. Faulkland
treated the affair ludicrously, it was
therefore expected, both by him and my
brother, that we should consider it so too.
That could not have been the case.  Miss
Burchell's confession has opened my eyes.

<pb n="356"/>
&mdash;Poor Mr. Faulkland!  What a wayward
fate is thine!  But let me beware of
relenting; that might be fatal.  There is
still one indelible blot remains upon his
conduct.  Miss Burchell, blameable as she
acknowleges herself, was still betrayed;
and though not by Mr. Faulkland, yet
sure his having paid the price of her
innocence to the wicked aunt, renders
him so far guilty, as that he owes her a
great reparation.  This was a particular I
durst not touch upon; the unhappy girl
herself being ignorant of it.  There is a
wide gulph fixed between Mr. Faulkland
and me.  How many things are leagued
against him!  Alas! he thinks the principal
bar to his hopes is removed, and
that if Miss Burchell has been just, he
ought to be forgiven.  But he little knows
thy Sidney's heart; critically delicate as
my situation is, in regard of him, I am removed
a thousand times farther than ever
from his wishes.  Neither knows he the
engagements I am under to Miss Burchell;
which alone would put an ever-lasting bar between us.  Unhappy Miss

<pb n="357"/>
Burchell!  She has bound me to her by
stronger ties than ever.  She has been ingenuous;
she has owned her weakness to
me; she declares she would have done
this sooner, if it could have promoted my
happiness: perhaps she would; shall I not
then endeavour to promote her's?  I will,
I must; by word is given.  Yet Faulkland
deserves&mdash;oh, he deserves a worthier
lot!</p>

<p>I NOW send you, my Cecilia, my
second Letter to Mr. Faulkland.
</p><p>
</p><p>'Why do you compel me, Sir,
noble and disinterested as your conduct
has been towards me, to accuse you
now of unkindness?  You call me insensible
&mdash;oh! it is from my too great sensibility
that all my sorrows have sprung.

<pb n="2"/>
Destitute as I am of happiness myself, or
even of a possibility of ever attaining it
here, I look for no other comfort in this
life, but what must arise from seeing those
whom I most esteem in possession of that
tranquillity of mind, which I can never
hope to enjoy.  If Mr. Faulkland were
happy, if Miss Burchell were happy, I
should be less miserable.  Remember, Sir,
it was not this lady's fault that you were
disappointed in your former hope.  She
did not try, by female wiles, to engage
a heart which you refused her.  She used
no ungenerous arts to cross your wishes.
Loving you, as she did, almost to distraction,
she yielded you up in silent anguish
to a rival; a rival superior to herself in nothing.
I acknowlege, Sir, I was to have
been yours, and with my own consent;
but was it not also with my own consent
those bonds were cancelled, by which we
were to have been united?  I was then
convinced Miss Burchell had a prior
claim; I think so still, and ever shall.
Miss Burchell's family is not mean, her

<pb n="3"/>
fortune is considerable; her beauty and
personal accomplishments inferior to none;
and, but for Mr. Faulkland, she had been
innocent.  Yet do not imagine I would
aggravate your fault; Miss Burchell's candor
could not suffer this.  How charmingly
ingenuous was her confession!  In the
midst of tears and blushes, she owned her
weakness; you, she said, were not to
blame.  She praised your generosity, your
compassion, the integrity and frankness of
your whole behaviour towards her; and
could Miss Burchell's suffrage have
ensured to you the completion of your
wishes, Mr. Faulkland would have been
indebted to her for what he once thought
his happiness.  But though her testimony
could not avail you in that particular,yet
are your obligations to her the same.  Does
not then Miss Burchell love Mr. Faulkland
with a generosity equal to his own?
Do years of fervent and unalterable affection
deserve no return?  Does the child,
the dear innocent that calls you father, deserve
no consideration?  He bears your

<pb n="4"/>
name, Sir; let him not blush to own it:
he may one day be an honour and a comfort
to you.  Put it in his power to make
it his boast, instead of his shame, that Mr.
Faulkland was his Father.  The amiable
lady, whose very life is bound up in you,
has, in the midst of her affliction, one
great source of comfort; her character has
escaped the malignity of cruel tongues,
by the privacy with which she conducted
her measures, till after the birth of your
son.  The retirement she has since lived
in; her prudent, her modest, her exemplary
conduct, have created esteem in
every body that knows her; this circumstance,
as it is a peculiar felicity to herself,
so ought it to be a motive of encouragement
to you, Sir, to compleat her
happiness.  The false judging part of the
world will have nothing to point at; Miss
Burchell's relation, or even connection
with Mrs. Gerrarde is hardly known here;
she has had no correspondence with that irregular
woman since she became a widow;
and her character had not suffered before,

<pb n="5"/>
in such a manner, as to reflect dishonour
on the young lady, who was then under
her care.  How then can you persist in a
cruel rejection of this lady?  You own she
is amiable; I am sure she has a thousand
good qualities.  Is her love for you, her
unparallelled love, to be imputed to her
as a crime?  If it be one, long and bitter
has been her punishment!  On you it rests
to recompence her sufferings.  What may
you not expect from a grateful heart that
worships you?  Such a fervent, such a
faithful love (deserving as you are) you
perhaps may never again meet with in
woman.  With her you may be happy,
she will make it the whole study of her
life to render you so.  Your own heart,
conscious of having acted nobly, will
confirm your happiness.  Would to God
I could inspire you with such sentiments
as would induce you to make the generous
experiment!  How would your character rise
in the esteem of the two persons whom you
profess to revere!  How would you be adored
by the amiable sufferer! but above
all, how delightful must be the exultations

<pb n="6"/>
of the self-approving mind!  There wants
but this act to render you the most deserving
of men.  I would fain esteem,
respect, admire you as I ought; but you
will not let me: you will be a <hi rend="italic">common</hi>
man, and undistinguished amongst the
light ones of your sex.'</p>
<p>     I shewed this letter to Miss Burchell; she
read it with grateful tears running down her
cheeks.  In about an hour I received the
following answer to it.
</p><p>
</p><p>'Miss Burchell may triumph, Madam,
since she has obtained <hi rend="italic">you</hi> for her advocate.
Well have you acquitted yourself
of the task your rigid heart has undertaken.
I thank the lady for the justice her
charming ingenuousness (as you rightly
call it) has done me.  But what have I
gained by this?  Have I not raised the fair
complainant still higher in your esteem,
given her a stronger claim to your pity,
and furnished you with arms against my-self?  Wretch that I am, I do, I must acknowlege
the force of every thing that

<pb n="7"/>
you have urged.  Miss Burchell is amiable,
her sincerity, her constancy and (by
me) unmerited love, deserve to be greatly
recompensed.  I would to heaven I
had a heart to give her! but I have not;
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> know I have not; <hi rend="italic">she</hi> knows it too.
Could I have made Miss Burchell the return
she deserves, I would not thus long
have shunned her presence.  I acknowleged
the state of my heart to her even
at the time I had lost all hopes of possessing
you.  And in the spite of my own
struggles, after years of confirmed despair,
I found myself still enslaved.  How then
could I offer a hand, devoted as my whole
soul was to another object, to a lady,
whose constant, tender, and delicate affection,
demanded all the return that a
sensible and grateful heart could make?
This, Madam, is all the plea I can urge
in answer to those arguments you offer to
promote your favourite wish.  Consult
your own delicacy, let Miss Burchell consult
hers, and then perhaps I shall stand
acquitted of ingratitude.'

<pb n="8"/>
</p>
<p>'I hoped, Madam, that cleared as I have
been of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> imputation, I might have recovered
some favour in yours and Lady
Bidulph's thoughts.  I was flattered with
this consolation, small as it was, when
every other hope forsook me.  But when
an unexpected event again brought happiness
within my prospect, this reflection,
I own, became of more importance, and
served to strengthen my then revived
hopes.  But you dash them with an unrelenting
hand; and again build up those
barriers between us, that heaven itself had
overthrown.  What can I say to you, inflexible
as you are? has Miss Burchell <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
your pity?  You may command my life,
Madam; I would lay it down freely for
you; but I cannot, must not, will not
give up my love; and till you declare in
express terms that I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be miserable, I
will not even give up my hope.
</p>
<p>                    ORLANDO FAULKLAND.' </p>

<p>     See, my Cecilia, the heart I have to
deal with.  Hard to be subdued, and obstinate

<pb n="9"/>
in all its purposes.  I expected difficulties,
but was in hopes he would be
less determined in regard to his perseverance
towards me.  I think however I have
gained some ground; he acknowleges
Miss Burchell's merit, and seems obliged to
her for the part she has acted towards him.
I have been under some difficulties on this
occasion; for as Miss Burchell was not so
candid in her acknowlegements to my mother
as she has been to me, I cannot let her
know the whole of her confession; for this
reason, I only told her the general purport of
what I wrote last to Mr. Faulkland; and in
reading his answer to her, I passed over such
passages as I thought might induce her to
require an explanation.  I own I am a little
hurt at Miss Burchell's former perverting of
facts on this occasion; but, as I have already
said more than once, there are great
allowances to be made for one in her very
critical situation.  Neither have I the least
right to reproach her for it even in my
thoughts; for had she been ever so explicit
at my mother's first interview with her, it
could not have availed me.

<pb n="10"/>
</p><p>You find, my dear, it is necessary I
should speak plainly to Mr. Faulkland.  I
shall write to him again, and here you shall
have a copy of what I say; but I must lead
this violent spirit with gentleness, and endeavour
to convince his reason, without
wounding his tenderness.
</p><p>
Mrs. Arnold's third letter to Mr. Faulkland.
</p><p>
</p><p>'You give me pleasure, Sir; I begin
to descry hopes for your and my amiable
friend.  I know such a heart as Mr.
Faulkland's cannot be proof against sentiments
of gratitude and compassion; it
will not be difficult to convert those sentiments
into love, when the object is so deserving.
Try, Sir, try; the experiment
cannot fail.  How much to your honour
will so noble a triumph be over an ill-fated passion!  What delightful returns
may you not expect from the obliged,
the grateful partner of your happiness!
Do not call me inflexible, or rigid; filled
as I am with gratitude, and a sense of
your merit, I should hate myself, if I did

<pb n="11"/>
not acknowlege that you deserve more
from me than it can ever be in my power
to repay.  I must be plain with you, since
you require it; it is impossible I ever can
be yours.  Sorry I am, that the necessity
of circumstances compels me to make so
early a declaration, from which I thought
my present situation would have exempted
me; but I forgive you, Sir, for urging
me on this head, and draw a happy presage
from your resting your hopes in relation
to me, on my own determination.
You appeal to my delicacy, whether you
ought, with a heart estranged, to offer
your hand to Miss Burchell?  Were delicacy
alone to be consulted, the answer
perhaps might be easy; but there are superior
considerations in your case to be
taken in.  Love, without doubt, demands
love in return; but where injured honour
is to be repaired, where the disgrace of a
darling child is to be prevented, those nicer
sentiments of the soul must and ought
to give way: and I will venture to pronounce,
that Miss Burchell would, with
raptures, receive the hand which would

<pb n="12"/>
confer such valuable blessings on her;
leaving it to time, and her own unremitting
tenderness and assiduity, to get an interest
in the heart, which, by such an act,
proved its own rectitude.  On this subject,
I, from experience, am qualified to
speak.  You know, Sir, the interest you
once had in me; you cannot think me so
light a creature, as to suppose I so soon
after my breaking with you, bestowed my
affections on another.  I did not; obedience
to my mother's commands was the
sole motive which engaged my vows to
Mr. Arnold; and I married him with no
other sentiments, than those of esteem and
gratitude for the great love he bore me.
Yet from these seeds sown in my heart,
sprung a tender and ardent affection: never
did wife love a husband better than I
did Mr. Arnold; his kindness merited,
and <hi rend="italic">did</hi> win my whole affections; nor
could a temporary alienation of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> heart,
dispossess him of the place he held in
<hi rend="italic">mine</hi>.  His returning love (for which,
will all thankfulness, I own myself bound
to you, Sir) made him still dearer to me

<pb n="13"/>
than ever, and I now possess myself wedded
to his memory.  You have a right,
Sir, to expect that I should explain myself
at once to you on this subject; for
your own sake, and for Miss Burchell's,
I must not suffer you to entertain a doubt
of my resolution.  You compel me to repeat,
that I think Miss Burchell deserves
your love, and has a just right to your
hand.  She throws herself upon your
honour, without pretending to have any
<hi rend="italic">lawful</hi> claim; if she <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, I should not
condescend to sollicit the man who could
refuse to do her justice.'
</p><p>
</p><p>'My mother is firm in her first resolves;
could you place a crown on my head, her
integrity would still oblige her to reject
it; nor would a crown tempt me to forfeit
the duty which I owe to her.'
</p><p>
</p><p>'See then, Sir, if that <hi rend="italic">unexpected event</hi>,
which you mention (a fatal event to me!)
has brought you nearer to your wishes;
and here let me add, in justice to my
own particular sentiments, that I think
Mr. Faulkland is the last man who
ought to be my choice, even if my heart

<pb n="14"/>
were disposed to make one.  Reproach
me not with ingratitude, or caprice till I
have explained myself.  It is not long,
Sir (blameless and unconscious as you
were of the injury, and nobly as you repaired
it) since you were the cause of a
separation between me and my husband.
I know you will say that our mutual innocence
on this occasion, and the secret's
being known but to a few of our friends,
make the objection of little weight.  I grant
you, with many it might be so; all minds
are not equally susceptible; 'tis my unhappiness
to have a too resenting heart.  My
own honour (scrupulous you may call it)
would not suffer me to let the man succeed
Mr. Arnold in my love, who was
the occasion of so much uneasiness to
him, and the cause of my being suspected
in my fidelity.  Would it not be an
insult to his memory?  Oh, Sir, what is
the world's opinion to the approbation of
our own hearts!  Mine has never yet reproached
me, and this has been my support
in all my trials.  Thus much I say
for the reverence I bear my dear Mr. Arnold's

<pb n="15"/>
memory: but I have other reasons
to offer in my excuse; refinements you
will call them, but my heart feels their
force.  I am not the same woman whom
you once loved; afflictions have impaired
my health, and those little advantages of
person which nature bestowed on me,
have not been improved by time; my
spirits, broken by misfortunes, have left
me languid and insensible to joy.  Peace
is the utmost of my wish, and all that I
am now capable of relishing.  The bride,
whom Mr. Faulkland once sought, was
in the bloom of youth, admired and caressed,
by a flattering world; unblemished
in her character, her fortune equal to her
wishes: her heart, her virgin heart, was
then a present (with pride let me say it)
worthy of any man's acceptance.  It was
then in her power to bestow happiness,
and Mr. Faulkland would not have been
matched unequally.  But the scene is
changed; what should I now bring to
your arms?  A person faded by grief; a
reputation (though undeservedly) once
called in question; a little helpless family

<pb n="16"/>
without fortune; a widowed heart,
dead to love and incapable of pleasure.
Oh, Sir! could I bear to be your wife
on such conditions?  Indebted to you as
I am, past a possibility of my ever making
you a return, to what a mighty sum
would you raise the obligation?  How
poor would you make me in my own
eyes?  Humbled as I am by adversity,
my soul has still too much pride, or let
me call it delicacy, to submit to this.
No, if there was no Miss Burchell in the
world, no parental sway to guide me, in
my present circumstances, I never would
be yours, '
</p><p>     'You have now before you my final determination.
I shall trouble you no more
on the subject.  If your heart relents towards
Miss Burchell, great will be your
reward.  In her you are sure of a tender,
faithful, and charming friend; who will
more than repay every act of kindness towards
her; and he who is the author of
justice and mercy will not fail to bless
you. '
</p><p>                    'I am, &amp;c.
</p>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>
</p><p>Methinks, my dear friend, I have now
eased my heart of a load that oppressed it.
What can I say more?  Mr. Faulkland now
knows my determined purpose in regard to
myself; and if he is not quite insensible,
I think Miss Burchell must at last obtain
the wish of her soul.  Oh, my Cecilia, I
would not have my heart devoured by such
a flame as her's, for the whole world.
But have I not acted as I should do?  I
hope I have; I feel satisfied with my own
conduct, and I never yet found that to be
the case when I acted wrong.  There are
some nice points, in which our own hearts
are the best, as well as the most impartial
judges.  If Mr. Faulkland persists in rejecting
poor Miss Burchell, I can urge
him no farther; but I am determined not
to see him.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 25.&mdash;How uneasy has been my
suspense these three days!  I question if
Miss Burchell's is much greater.  No answer
from this strange man; perhaps he is
flown off again.&mdash;No, I wrong him, a letter

<pb n="18"/>
is this minute brought up to me from
him.&mdash;Read it, read it, my beloved, and
congratulate me.
</p><p>'You were born to conquer, Madam;
what is there that you cannot effect?
My heart was made for you, and you can
mould it as you please.  Enjoy your triumph,
if it be one.  I will receive Miss
Burchell as <hi rend="italic">your</hi> gift; and since I cannot
obtain your love, I will at least compel
your esteem.  Why should <hi rend="italic">your</hi> generosity,
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> compassion for an unhappy
lady, to whom you have no obligation,
exceed that of a man who owns
himself bound to her in gratitude?  I wish
I could repay her the debt of love I owe
her, but I will try to repair my fault
hereafter; and in her gentle bosom perhaps
I may recover that peace, to which
I have been so long a stranger.  She will
forgive the waywardness of a heart, which
never disguised its anguish to her; and
which she knows has been torn by a fatal
passion, that, like a cruel disease, was not
either to be resisted or subdued.  But

<pb n="19"/>
thanks to you, Madam, I think I begin
to feel my cure approaching.  Miss Burchell's
tenderness will finish what you
have begun.  You shall never reproach
me more; if I <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> had an interest in
your heart, I will not forfeit it now, but
make that proud heart acknowlege, spite
of itself, that Faulkland was not unworthy
of it.'
</p><p>Ha! my Cecilia, what do you say to my
Orlando now?  <hi rend="italic">My</hi> Orlando let me this
once call him.  Has he not a noble mind?
Happy! happy Miss Burchell! you are at
length arrived to the summit of your
wishes.  Long may you enjoy them, and
may you make your love as blest as he
deserves to be!  My mother clasped her
hands together in joy, when I read this letter
to her.  God bless him, God bless him,
said she; he is now indeed a righteous man.
How rejoiced I am, my dear, that I have
been the means of bringing about this so-much-wished-for event.  And yet, methinks,
if I were in Miss Burchell's place,
though my heart doated on the man to

<pb n="20"/>
death, I could not receive him on such
terms.  He accepts her as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> gift; it is
to raise himself in my esteem, he does her
justice: Nay, I think the assuming man
seems to insinuate a sort of superiority over
me, by this concession.  Why let it be so,
I shall be content in my humiliation, if <hi rend="italic">my</hi>
gift will restore him to his peace.  If it
does, which I pray heaven it may, ought
he not to think himself indebted to me?
</p><p>I think I should not let Miss Burchell
see this last letter; he does not consent
with a good grace; and it may damp her
joy.  Though, upon second thoughts, I
question whether she has delicacy enough to
be much affected by this circumstance.&mdash;
</p><p>I am saved the trouble of observing any
decorum towards Miss Burchell.  She has
been just here, wild with transport; and was
several minutes in the room before I could
get her to speak coherently.  She had received
a letter from Mr. Faulkland, written
by his own angelic hand, she said.  She
made no difficulty of leaving it with me,
and here it is.

<pb n="21"/>
Mr. Faulkland's letter to Miss Burchell.
</p><p>'Is it possible, Madam, that I can still
be dear to you, careless and remiss as I
have been towards you, since you first honoured
me with your affection?  If you
can forgive this, I am ready to offer you
my hand; and hope, by devoting my future
days to you, to make you amends
for those years, during which (deserving
as you are) I have withheld that heart
which was your due.
</p><p>'I never had any merit towards you but
my sincerity; and I will not now give up
that virtue to arrogate to myself another
to which I have no title.  I own to you,
Madam, that it is to Mrs. Arnold's superior
prudence, and nice honour, I am
beholden for being brought to a just sense
of your worth, and my own obligations
to you.  If you will give me leave to attend
you this afternoon, you will receive
a man filled with sentiments of gratitude
and esteem for you, and who is determined,
by his future conduct, to deserve
a continuance of your love.
</p><p>                    'I am, &amp;c.'

<pb n="22"/>
</p><p>I congratulated Miss Burchell (after reading
this letter) on her approaching felicity.
She had not words to express her acknowlegements
to me.  The service I
had rendered her was indeed to her a most
important one; and there are some occasions
where <hi rend="italic">words</hi> are of no use; Miss Burchell
can be eloquent without them.  She
embraced me a thousand times, and wept
in tender transport on my neck.
</p><p>My mother is as much delighted at this
happy event, as if it immediately concerned
her own welfare.  She recommended it
to Miss Burchell, to have her little boy
with her when Mr. Faulkland came to visit
her.  It seems he has not seen the child
since his last return to England: he did
not care to go to the house where it was
boarded, for fear of drawing any observation
on himself to Miss Burchell's prejudice;
and the people never permitted the
child to be taken abroad by any one but
Miss Burchell (who passes for its aunt)
or Mr. Faulkland's house-keeper; but
this good woman, happening to be sick

<pb n="23"/>
when he came to town, Mr. Faulkland
had not an opportunity of sending for it.
</p><p>Miss Burchell greatly approved of the
motion, and flew from us to prepare for
this so-much desired interview.
</p><p>And now, my Cecilia, do you not think
Mr. Faulkland has proved himself a disinterested
(lover shall I say) of your Sidney?
Indeed he has given a noble testimony of
his esteem and deference for me, as well as
he formerly did of his affection.  If Miss
Burchell does not render herself worthy of
him, how I shall hate myself for having
brought about this union!  But she loves
him too ardently, and is herself too lovely,
not to get possession of his heart, when it
becomes his duty, as well as his interest,
to give it up to her.  All acquaintance between
her and me, must now cease: for
her sake, as well as Mr. Faulkland's, this
will be necessary; my presence my disturb,
but never can contribute to the tranquillity
of either of them.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 26.&mdash;Miss Burchell was in too much
haste to communicate her joy to us, to defer

<pb n="24"/>
the giving an account of what passed between
her and Mr. Faulkland yesterday
evening.  She hurried to us last night, at
almost ten o'clock.
</p><p>He came to her house, she said, at six,
the hour she had appointed him; and looked
<hi rend="italic">so</hi> enchantingly.  She herself was dressed
out very elegantly to receive him, and I
thought looked really charming; her countenance
was so lightned up with joy, that
she did not appear the same woman.
</p><p>She had endeavoured, she said, to compose
herself for this interview, and had tried
to assume something of dignity; but it
all vanished when her conqueror approached,
and the tumult of her heart so intirely
banished all recollection, and presence of
mind, that she was not able to tell me in
what manner she received him.  She only
knows, she says, that having snatched up
her little boy, who stood by her and hung
on her gown, she put him into his father's
arms, and bidding the babe thank him for
his goodness, she burst into tears.  Mr.
Faulkland tenderly embraced the child, not
without a visible emotion of countenance;

<pb n="25"/>
and having gently set him down again, he
placed himself by Miss Burchell's side.
She was still sobbing.  Those generous tears,
Madam, said he, taking her by the hand,
reproach me too much: I have not deserved
this tenderness; I cannot look upon you,
nor that dear boy, without blushing; but
you have forgiven me: it shall be the study
of my life to make you both happy.  Oh!
Madam, continued Miss Burchell, what an
exquisite joy must such a declaration give
me from the beloved of my soul.  I wrung
his hand; Oh, Sir, you are too, too good:
What return can I make you?  One thing
only say to me, that you do not offer me a
<hi rend="italic">very</hi> reluctant hand, and I shall then be the
happiest of women.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland paused a little while, and
then, with a noble frankness, replied: 'You
know, my dear Miss Burchell, with what
an excess of passion I have ever loved
Mrs. Arnold:  Had no such woman existed,
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> would have been my choice, preferably
to any other: but when I first knew
you, I looked upon myself as bound to
her, though, at that time, I had never

<pb n="26"/>
seen her: my knowledge of her afterwards
confirmed me her's.  I made no secret of
this to you, and you may remember what
my declarations to you were, even at the
time my hopes were frustrated.  I have
loved her fervently ever since; even in the
arms of a husband I adored her; and I
will be candid enough to own to you,
that, as my attachment to her has, during
all that time, estranged me from
you, so should I still, had I the least hopes
of succeeding, have persisted in my suit.
But she has cut off all hope; she has declared
she never can be mine, and at the
same time has represented my obligations
to you in so strong a light, that I am convinced
I ought to be your's.  And let me
own, Madam (you who are generous,
and know what it is to love, will pardon
a declaration which I durst not make to
any other woman) to you I will confess
that Mrs. Arnold is arbitress of my fate;
and in approving myself to her, I do so
to my own conscience.  I do not therefore,
though my actions have been guided
by her, yield with reluctance to her will;

<pb n="27"/>
her virtue, her religion, and enlarged
mind, have only dictated to me, what
my own reason tells me I ought to do.
I have been a slave to a hopeless passion
too long; I am now resolved to struggle
with my chains: you, Madam, must assist
me in breaking them entirely; and I
make no doubt but that time, joined to
my own efforts, and aided by your sweetness
of disposition, your tenderness, and
admirable sense, will enable me to conquer
what I must now call a weakness,
and make the triumph equally happy for
us both.  But remember, Madam, I never
see Mrs. Arnold more.  'Tis for your
peace sake as well as my own, that I
make this a preliminary to our marriage.
I will, when you shall vouchsafe me the
honour of your hand, receive it, if you
please, from Lady Bidulph; and as I
presume it will be agreeable to you to
have the ceremony intirely private, that
I may, for our dear little boy's sake,
present you rather as my acknowleged
wife, than as my new-made bride, I will,
with the utmost speed and secrecy, have

<pb n="28"/>
such disposition made, as shall be suitable
to my condition, and your own merit.
</p><p>'I should like, after we are united, if
you have no objection to it, to pay a visit
for a while to an estate I have in Ireland;
which I have never yet seen, and which I
intended to have looked at, if this event,
this happy event (and he kissed my hand)
had not taken place.'
</p><p>Penetrated as I was, pursued Miss Burchell,
with a sense of the generosity and
openness of his heart, I could not forbear
raising his hand to my lips; he tenderly
withdrew it from me, as if abashed at my
condescension.  He then turned the discourse
to less interesting subjects, and after
three delightful hours spent with me, took
his leave; not without having first fixed on
Wednesday, next Wednesday, to be the
blessed day that is to make him mine for
ever.
</p><p>Happy, happy may you be, said I! you
<hi rend="italic">must</hi> be happy; but let me see you once
again before you are Mrs. Faulkland: there
are not many hours to come before that
name will be yours.  My dear Madam!

<pb n="29"/>
said she, and patted my bosom with her
hand, I hope all is well <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; she looked
earnestly in my face, and then added, but
you have a noble heart.  'Tis an honest
one I hope, said I, a little disconcerted at
her manner.  Why did she address me thus,
my dear?  I hope I did not discover any
thing in my behaviour as if I repined at her
good fortune; if I did, far be such a wretched
meanness from the heart of they friend.
Was it not my own act to make Miss Burchell
the happy woman she now thinks herself?
Yet I own there is something in Mr.
Faulkland's conduct which has raised my
esteem to admiration.  Oh may his future
days be blessed, else shall I indeed be
wretched!
</p><p>My mother told Miss Burchell, it would
give her inexpressible satisfaction to bestow
her in marriage on Mr. Faulkland; and
desired she would let her know to-morrow
at what time and place the ceremony was
to be performed.  She answered, at her
own house, as she could be no where else
so private; and that Mr. Faulkland would
engage for the purpose a clergyman, a particular

<pb n="30"/>
friend of his, and fellow-collegian,
on whose discretion he could rely.
</p><p>Miss Burchell's spirits were too much exhilarated
to let her think of rest; she staid
with us till it was very late, and having taken
occasion to mention how grieved she
was at the thoughts of losing my society,
and of the necessity of Mr. Faulkland expressed
himself under of never seeing me more,
my mother took that opportunity of gravely
entering into the subject of matrimonial
duties.  She highly applauded Mr. Faulkland's
resolution on that head, and told
Miss Burchell, it ought exceedingly to enhance
his merit towards her.  Let this be
a memorandum to you, my dear Madam,
said she, how sacred the bond is to be held
that is now going to unite you: He will
not, you see, run the hazard of being tempted,
even in thought, to swerve from that
faith which he is going to plight to you;
your situation is delicate, and it will require
the utmost prudence and circumspection
on your part, to secure such an interest
in his heart as he now seems inclined to
give you.  It is not on your personal charms

<pb n="31"/>
that you are to rely, for subduing or preserving
the affections of such a man as he
is.  They alone, you see, were not able to
effect this: it is to Mr. Faulkland's honour
rather than his love, that you are now obliged
for the justice he has done you: never
let this be out of your thoughts; be grateful,
but let your gratitude have dignity in
it; and by your behaviour convince your
husband that honour was with you a first
motive to wish this union, love will then
come in with a better grace as a secondary
inducement.
</p><p>The freedom of my mother's observations,
and instructions, I was not surprized
at, because she always speaks her mind;
but the emphasis with which she delivered
herself was unusual.  Miss Burchell expressed
herself as obliged to her, and joined intirely
in her opinion; I could perceive,
however, she was not pleased with the
lecture.
</p><p>When Miss Burchell was gone, my mother
told me, she thought it necessary to
speak as she had done.  Miss Burchell,
said she, is not <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> the girl I took her

<pb n="32"/>
for; so much modesty and reserve, I
thought I never had met with in a young
creature before; when she used to speak
of Mr. Faulkland, it was with affection
indeed, but with such a nice decorum as
convinced me of the innocence and purity
of her heart.  But of late I have observed
she has been less delicate in her expressions
of tenderness; such passionate flights have
sometimes broke from her, as I did not
think becoming in a young woman, and
which indeed almost offended me; and
this night her joy has been ungoverned.
Great reason she has for joy 'tis true; but
there are some considerations which ought
to have made her chasten that joy into a
sober, and, at least seemingly, moderate
satisfaction.  She loves Mr. Faulkland,
but let her beware of disgusting a man of
his sense by too strong an expression of her
fondness.
</p><p>My mother's observation, and her uncommonly
forcible manner of expressing
it, struck me prodigiously.  It is true I had
made the same remarks myself, but as
you know she is not extremely penetrating,

<pb n="33"/>
and in general, but a superficial observer, I
was the more surprized at what she said.
Miss Burchell's behaviour must have been
formerly very different from what it now
is, to have made my mother so sensible of
the change.  <hi rend="italic">Some considerations</hi>, she said,
ought to have made her chasten her joy.
Perhaps, she meant no more than that the
young lady, even in the midst of that joy,
had, upon reflection, cause for humiliation.
I hope, she did not think that her gaiety on
this desired event affected me, who had so
warmly promoted it.  My mother is too open
not to give the full meaning of her thoughts.
This may be only the suggestion of my
own fancy, yet it has mortified me.  I had
but little rest last night, and rose this morning
by day-light, to throw together in writing
the above particulars.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 27.&mdash;Miss Burchell came not to us
till late this evening; pleasure danced in her
eyes.  I whispered to her, We rejoice with
you, dear Madam, sincerely rejoice, at your
approaching felicity; but our present state
will not suffer us to keep pace with you in

<pb n="34"/>
that gaiety, however justifiable it may be
from the cause: restrain yourself a little;
my mother will not think you kind, as we
are so soon to part with you.  She smiled,
and thanking me for the hint, immediately
composed her features to such a decorum
(I will not call it demureness) that it was
impossible to discover she was agitated by
any extraordinary emotion.  I own, I was
amazed at the command she so suddenly assumed
over her countenance.  I was glad,
however, she did so, that my mother might
not have fresh cause of dislike towards her.
</p><p>She told us that Mr. Faulkland had settled
a thousand pounds a year on her, and
that too without ever having informed himself
of the state of her fortune: for, in the
hurry of her thoughts, she had neglected to
mention it to him: (Generous man! whispered
I to myself.)  She then, with great
gravity, applied herself to my mother, and
told her, she hoped for the honour of her
presence, the next morning, at her own
house; where the ceremony was to be performed,
before no other witnesses but her
ladyship, and the gentlewoman, who had

<pb n="35"/>
been Mr. Faulkland's housekeeper; and
that the following day they purposed retiring
to Mr. Faulkland's seat in Hertfordshire,
and, after a short stay there, to
set out for Ireland.
</p><p>My mother commended Mr. Faulkland's
diligence, for having so suddenly disposed
every thing for this important event, and
told our friend she would not fail to attend
her at the appointed time.
</p><p>Miss Burchell's behaviour was extremely
composed; she either really was, or affected
to be, extremely sorry at parting with
me; she could not stay long with us, she
said, as she had many things still to settle in
the remaining part of that evening.  On
taking leave of me, I shall not see you
again, worthiest of women, said she, at least,
for many months; but my love, my respect,
and my gratitude towards you will be
as lasting as my life.  You shall hear often
from me, and be so good as sometimes to
tell me I am not forgotten.  She embraced
me with tears in her eyes, but I thought she
tripped down stairs to her chair, as if her
heart was very light.

<pb n="36"/>
</p><p>My mother liked her deportment: she
said, she believed the flightiness of her behaviour
before, was owing to her being quite
intoxicated with the suddenness of her joy,
on so unexpected a turn of fortune; but
that, since she had time for recollection, she
had recovered her wonted bashful and sober
air, with which she used to be so delighted.
My mother says, she will contrive to carry
a rich white brocade gown with her, in order
to slip it on at Miss Burchell's house; for
she would not, on any consideration, appear
in mourning on this joyful occasion.  You
know the reverence she has for omens.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 28.&mdash;The important event is over,
my Cecilia.  Miss Burchell is now Mrs.
Faulkland.  My mother is just returned,
and saw the nuptial knot tied.  The lady,
she said, looked very lovely; and it was
easy to observe she gave her hand with all
her heart.  Mr. Faulkland's behaviour was
polite and unconstrained; but his attention
to his bride was more gallant than tender;
and his whole deportment was that of a man
who seemed to endeavour at acquitting himself

<pb n="37"/>
with a good grace of an act of duty,
rather than of inclination.  The latter part
of the observation is mine, not my mother's;
but I collected it from certain little
particulars, which she related to me in her
own way, without drawing any inference
from them.
</p><p>He thanked her in a most respectful manner
for the honour she had done him, and
for her former friendship to Miss Burchell;
but did not once mention my name.  So
much the better; I hope he will forget me.
</p><p>My mother is mighty alert on the occasion,
and felicitates both herself and me
on our having brought about this very important
affair.  She joined heartily with me
in praying that the new-married pair may
be happy in each other.  She is quite reconciled
to Mr. Faulkland.  What a pity
it was, said she&mdash;and stopped; then added,
But every thing is for the best.  I understood
her, but made no reply.
</p><p>They go out of town to-morrow morning;
all happiness attend them!
</p><p>I expect Sir George will be quite outrageous
about this marriage.  My second refusal

<pb n="38"/>
of his friend, with the addition of his
now being wedded, through my persuasion,
to a woman my brother never could endure,
will, I fear, exasperate him beyond a possibility
of reconciliation.  I cannot help it;
I have acted agreeably to the dictates of
my duty; that must be my consolation:
life is in itself a warfare, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> life has been
particularly so.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 8.&mdash;My mother is far from being
well; her spirits have been a little heightened
for these few days past, but her disorder
I see gains ground: the swelling in her legs
is returning, and her rest at night quite
broken.  I am hourly habituating myself
to think of her dissolution; or in other
words, am preparing myself for the worst
evil that can now befal me.  I hope I shall
find myself equal to the trial.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 10.&mdash;Here is a storm for you my
dear; a letter from Sir George.  I wanted
such a thing to rouse me from the almost
lethargic dulness that was creeping on me.
Mr. Faulkland has acquainted him with his

<pb n="39"/>
marriage.  Pray observe his brotherly address.
</p><p>MRS. ARNOLD,              <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 6, 1706.
</p><p>'For I disclaim all relation to you.  I
have just now had a letter from Faulkland,
wherein I am at once informed of your
having finally rejected him, and of his being
married to Miss Burchell.  As for
the first, your own folly be on your head.
You will have time enough for repentance,
and I need with you no other punishment
than what <hi rend="italic">will</hi>, and for me <hi rend="italic">shall</hi>, be the
consequence of your obstinate adherence
to your own romantick wild opinions.  But
what in the name of blind infatuation could
provoke you to urge the man, to whom
you owed such obligations, to his destruction?
<hi rend="italic">You</hi> I know have done it; he could
not be so mad but under <hi rend="italic">your</hi> influence.
You and my mother I suppose fancy you
have done a righteous deed; but you
have done what I am afraid poor Faulkland
will have reason to&mdash;I will suppress
the shocking word, that my indignation
suggested.

<pb n="40"/>
</p><p>'Why was not I made acquainted with
this precious design of marrying my friend
to that insinuating little viper?  I might
perhaps have prevented the mischief; for
I cannot think if she had not imposed upon
you, that you would have pushed your
chimerical notions of honour to such extremities.
</p><p>'Perhaps you meant well; but it has
ever been your peculiar misfortune I think
to have your good intentions productive
of nothing but evil: this last action I fear
will be a severe proof of the truth of this
observation.  I warned you in time against
this woman, but my advice has always
been despised.
</p><p>'I will say no more on the hateful subject;
what is done is irrevocable: but I
believe you will hardly be able to answer
it to yourself, if you find that you have
condemned one of the noblest fellows in
the world to the arms of a prostitute.'
</p><p>Lord bless me! my Cecilia, was there
ever such a barbarian? with what an implacable
aversion does he pursue this poor girl!

<pb n="41"/>
But what does he mean by the odious epithet
with which he closes his horrid letter?
Sure Miss Burchell merits not that name.
Her weakness in regard to Mr. Faulkland
cannot bring on her so detestable a charge.
If George knows any thing more of her
character than I do, why did he not tell
me so before?  It cannot be; his aversion to
her makes him cruel and unjust.  He says
true; I should not indeed forgive myself if
I were the means of making Mr. Faulkland
unhappy; and his observation would be
dreadfully verified, that all my good intentions
produce nothing but evil, if this marriage
should prove to be unfortunate.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 20.&mdash;I have had a letter from Mrs.
Faulkland.  She and her husband are arrived
safely at his estate on the borders of the
north of Ireland, within less than thirty
miles of the capital.  It is a pleasant part
of the country she says, but as Mr. Faulkland
has no house there, they have taken
up their lodgings for the present a the house
of his steward.  Her letter is filled with declarations
of the felicity she enjoys; she

<pb n="42"/>
says, she would not change her lot to be the
greatest Queen on earth.&mdash;May she continue
to deserve her happy fortune, and to
render her husband as satisfied with<hi rend="italic">his</hi> lot
as she is with <hi rend="italic">hers</hi>! then shall I triumph
over Sir George for his vile insinuations.
</p><p>I have heard from my good lady V&mdash;,
in answer to the letter I wrote her, giving
an account of Mr. Faulkland's marriage.
As he had not made her acquainted with
his return to England, I knew not whether
he had informed her of this particular; and
I find he had not.  As lady V&mdash; was a
stranger to his former connection with Miss
Burchell (with whom I have already told
you she was acquainted, and that she entertained
a very favourable opinion of her)
she expressed no displeasure at the alliance;
but said, she supposed he married in a
tifft, upon my refusal of him; for which I
gave her such reasons as I had before given
Mr. Faulkland, excepting those which related
to Miss Burchell; which, for both their
sakes, must now be no more mentioned.
Lady V&mdash; says, she <hi rend="italic">will not condemn the
delicacy of my sentiments, though she owns</hi>

<pb n="43"/>
<hi rend="italic">her wish was, that it could have been got over,
as she is sure that Mr. Faulkland can never be
happy with any one but me</hi>.
</p><p>[Here follows an interval of near two
months, in which nothing material occurred.]
</p><p><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 13.&mdash;The time approaches,
my Cecilia, when thy friend shall be poor
and destitute.  I know thy generous heart
will more than sympathize with me in my
calamity, from the aggravating reflexion
that it is not in your power to assist me.
The account you have given me of your
husband's close disposition has too fully
convinced me of this.  Nor should I have
mentioned my apprehensions to you at this
time, but that I am bound not to conceal
a thought from the friend of my heart.
</p><p>Sir George has dropt all correspondence
with us, I have nothing to expect from
him; nor does that mortal live (yourself
excepted) to whom I would, on such an
occasion, be indebted.  I have already
sighed too often under the weight of obligations
I which could not repay.

<pb n="44"/>
</p><p>My mother is hastening apace towards a
better world.  She sees her end approaching
with such a calmness, such a truly pious
joy, as almost makes me ashamed of
lamenting her loss; for what is it in me,
my dear but selfishness?  'Tis true, the
loss of a tender parent, a faithful friend, at
a time when all other comforts of life are
fled, is an evil one would wish wholly
to avoid, or at least to postpone to the
longest date possible: but when I consider
<hi rend="italic">her</hi> welfare, ought I to indulge myself in
such a wish?  Her life is already become
a burden to her; her infirmities are painful,
and without hope of cure; she longs
to be released, and to receive that reward
of her righteousness, which cannot be obtained
on this side of the grave.
</p><p>If we had a friend, who, in compassion
to our wants or weakness, consented to live
with us, though under the pressure of years
and bodily pain; and that friend were invited
to a remote country, with an assurance
of recovering health, of having youth
renewed, and of possessing all the riches,
power, honours, and accumulated pleasure

<pb n="45"/>
that this world can bestow; should
we not blush to own even a wish to detain
him from such a station?  What but a love
of ourselves, superior to that which we
bear to our friend, could suggest such a
thought?  How much more to be desired
then is the change, to which my mother
looks forward, with an assured hope!
</p><p>But there is something dismal in the idea
of death! 'tis only our prejudices make it so.
I have been endeavouring for many days
past to familiarise it to my thoughts, and
to consider death only as the name of a
region through which my mother is to pass,
in order to get at that delightful country
to which she is invited, and whither <hi rend="italic">I</hi> shall
assuredly follow her.  Such is the present
frame of my mind; judge then, my sister,
if this philosophy will not bear me up
against the expected blow when it falls
upon me.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 15.&mdash;'Tis strange, my Cecilia,
that this best of parents, who has always so
tenderly loved me, expresses now not the
least uneasiness at the forlorn condition in

<pb n="46"/>
which she must soon leave me.  Her
thoughts are employed on higher objects,
and she seems to have weaned herself from
all worldly attachments.
</p><p>I am going from you, my daughter, said
she to me just now, and have no other legacy
to leave you but a parent's blessing.
Your brother possesses all when I die; I
wish you had the means of enjoying life
with comfort; but you must be contented.
See that you bear your lot as becomes you.
I perceive your grief for the melancholy
condition to which I am reduced; but added
she smiling, I shall soon be released.
Remember how David behaved on the
death of that son, whose life he had for earnestly
besought of his maker: let that
serve you as an example, not to give yourself
up to unprofitable sorrow.  Bring up
your children in the principles that I
taught <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, and God will take care of them;
for <hi rend="italic">I have never seen the righteous forsaken,
nor his seed begging their bread</hi>.
</p><p>She said, she found herself drowsy, and
desired me to leave her for a while.  I have
left her, going to hope to get a little sleep;

<pb n="47"/>
she breathes with so much difficulty that she
cannot bear to lie down, and never gets any
rest but by snatches, as she sits in an arm-chair supported by pillows.
</p><p>How heavy and cast down do I feel my
spirits; but I know the worst&mdash;<hi rend="italic">that</hi> is
something.&mdash;
</p><p>It is all over: and my mother, blessed
woman! opens not her eyes again
but to a joyful resurrection.  Oh, my
dear, there is no terror in death when
he seizes us not unprepared!  I went into
my mother's chamber, in about half
an hour after I had quitted it, at her
desire: I found her leaning back in her
chair, her eyes shut, and a complacent
air diffused over her face, which made me
hope that her slumber was sweeter, and
more profound than usual.  I sat down by
her to contemplate her benign countenance;
and was some minutes before I discovered
that she did not breathe.  I took
her hand, she had no pulse; and I soon
found that the happy spirit had escaped
from its house of clay.  May <hi rend="italic">I</hi> die the
death of the righteous, and my latter end

<pb n="48"/>
be like hers!  No murmurings, no, no my
sister, I will be patience itself!
</p><p><hi rend="italic">September</hi> 25.&mdash;I have sent the remains
of my venerable parent down to Sidney-Castle, there to be interred with her ancestors.
I wrote my brother an account of
her death on the day it happened, but have
as yet received no answer.  Unnatural son!
but I will not reproach him; some accident
might have prevented his writing immediately
on the receipt of my letter.  He never
intirely forsook the duty he owed his
mother, but he has of late been quite
estranged from us; his wife, vain, weak
and imperious, governs him totally.  I
must now begin to look about me for a
place of abode suited to my present circumstances.
My whole income would not pay
more than half the rent of these lodgings in
which I have lived with my dear mother.
My poor Patty!  I am grieved for <hi rend="italic">her</hi>.  I
begged of her to seek another mistress,
who might be able to reward her merit,
and provide for her as she deserves; but

<pb n="49"/>
the worthy affectionate girl told me, it
would break her heart, if I talked of parting
with her.  You must have a servant of
some sort, Madam, said she, why may not
I do as well as another?  If I were able to
make you a proper return, Patty, said I,
you should not leave me; but I cannot afford
to pay a servant of your abilities as
you deserve; and I must be my own maid
for the future.  Never, never, Madam, cried
the honest creature, bursting into tears,
while I have hands to serve you.  Let me
but attend on you, and the two dear children;
I desire nothing.&mdash;I want nothing.
Your goodness has all along supplied me so,
that I am sure I have cloaths enough to serve
me during my life; and if I could not put
up with the same humble way of living that
my mistress does, sure I should be a presumptuous
wretch!  My tears thanked the
grateful girl; and taking her by the hand,
I told her, that I would not talk of parting
for the present, but when any thing worth
her acceptance offered, I should then insist
on her embracing it.

<pb n="50"/>
</p><p>I am determined to retire to some village
at a distance from London, and either to
take a little cottage to myself, or board with
my children at some farm-house, as I shall
find most convenient.  Fifty pounds a year
will be but a slender support for three persons
brought up in affluence.  My little ones
indeed will not now be sensible of the
change, and by the time they are grown
up, they will be so inured to their homely
board, that they will not, I hope, aspire
after what cannot consistently (perhaps,)
with virtue, lie within their reach.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 27.&mdash;After paying the expences
of my mother's funeral, discharging our
lodgings, and some other demands, I find
my purse will be so extremely reduced, that
I shall have but barely enough to keep out
want, till my small income becomes due to
me.  I must therefore, for the present, defer
putting my scheme into execution, as I
am not qualified to undertake a journey
with my little family; especially as I am
as yet uncertain what place to fix on for my
residence; neither will I afford my brother

<pb n="51"/>
(though I have no reason to expect any
thing from him) a farther pretence for reproaching
me, by giving him room to say,
I left London without consulting him, or
waiting for his return to it.  I shall therefore
look out for a lodging of a small price,
where I will conceal myself from every body
that knows me, and wait for Sir George's
arrival.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 28.&mdash;How happy you make
me, my ever dear friend, by your approbation
of my conduct; since my receiving
your last packet, which came to my hand
late last night, I am better reconciled to my
present lot than I was before I heard from
you.  I <hi rend="italic">could not do otherwise</hi>, you say, after
my solemn promise given to Miss Burchell,
than use my utmost endeavours to promote
her marriage with Mr. Faulkland.
True; I could not: but I wish you had
entered more into my sentiments, in regard
to those punctilios, which, you tell me, you
think <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have been got over, if that
young woman had been out of the question.
I could not help smiling at your wish, unchristian

<pb n="52"/>
as it was; but my dear, if that
<hi rend="italic">were</hi> to happen, do you think Mr. Faulkland
so void of reason, nay of feeling, as
after all that has past to persevere?  Or if
he did, that I could be so mean as to owe
the very bread that I and my children should
eat, to his generosity?  Would you, my
Cecilia, wish to see your friend so humbled?
Tis not in the power even of the
cold, hard hand of poverty itself, to dash
me so low as that would do.  But where is
the need of forming resolutions, or even
making declarations about what never <hi rend="italic">can</hi>
happen?  I see notwithstanding, that you
think my heart has <hi rend="italic">again</hi> done itself some
violence:  You know that heart too well for
me to attempt to hide from you its secret
workings.  I own to you honestly I now
feel my own unhappiness in its full extent.
I look back, and take a survey of the past,
and cannot help thinking that I have had
the most wayward fate alloted me that ever
woman had.
</p><p>Disappointment in a first love, has, I
think, been ever accounted a grief scarce
surmountable even by time: but this can

<pb n="53"/>
only be the case, where the heart, extremely
vulnerable by nature (like Miss Burchell's)
suffers itself to be so entirely immersed
in that passion, that all the other duties
of life are swallowed up in it; and where
an indolent turn of mind, a want of rational
avocations, and perhaps of a new object,
all contribute to indulge and confirm
the disease.  This you know was not my
case.  I loved, 'tis true; but it was with
temperance; and though my disappointment
afflicted me, it did not subdue me.
I got the better of it, I think I got the better
of it even before I married; but sure I
am, I totally conquered all remembrance
of it after I became a wife.  I then laid
down a new Scheme of happiness, and was
for a time in possession of it; how I was
thrown from this is still bitter to remembrance.
You well know what I suffered,
when I found myself deprived of my husband's
love, and suspected of a crime at
which my soul shrunk.  But it pleased the
just God to deliver me from this heavy misfortune,
and I think the happiest days of
my marriage were those which I passed with

<pb n="54"/>
Mr. Arnold after our re-union.  Then it
was, I was thoroughly sensible that the
heart <hi rend="italic">can</hi> love a second time, truly and ardently;
but I was soon again plunged into
affliction by the death of a husband endeared
to me more than ever by his misfortunes.
My grief for him was proportionate to my
love.  Yet, my friend, as time is an universal
conqueror, it might have healed this
wound as well as the former one; and a
few, a very few years would perhaps have
disposed me to return Mr. Faulkland's still
unabated passion, if a variety of circumstances
had not interposed, that strongly
forbad our union.  Convinced as I was of
this, I acted agreeably to the dictates both
of my reason, and my conscience, in persuading
Mr. Faulkland to make Miss Burchell
his wife.  I should have been grieved
and mortified had he rejected her, and I
had determined never to have seen him
more.  Yet how deceitful is the human
heart! this very act which I laboured with
so much assiduity to accomplish, and on the
accomplishment of which, I had founded,
I know not how, a sort of contentment for

<pb n="55"/>
myself, has been the very means of destroying
what little peace of mind I was beginning
to taste before. Sure that man was
born to torment me in a variety of ways!
If I was disappointed in my early love, I
had however duty, and a consciousness of
what I then thought superior worth, to support
me.  If on his account I suffered cruel
and injurious aspersions, the innocence of my
own self-acquitted heart bore me up under
it: but he has at length found the way to
punish me without leaving me any resource.
My pride is of no use, he has raised himself
in my esteem superior to every thing.
His whole behaviour so generous, so candid;
a love so disinterested, so fervent;
what noble, what uncommon proofs has
he given me of it! and at length what a
triumphant sacrifice has he made of that
over-ruling passion, to the sober call of reason
and humanity!  He has left me, my
dear, to gaze after him with grateful admiration!
and sometimes perhaps to sigh
that our fates rendered it impossible for us
to meet.  But if I do sometimes sigh, it is
not at the advantages of fortune, which I

<pb n="56"/>
might have enjoyed with him; no, no,
surrounded as I am with distress, I do not
envy Miss Burchell's affluence or splendor.
If <hi rend="italic">that</hi> motive could have had weight with
me, I might have been mean enough not
to have acted as I have done.  'Tis the
qualities of the man's mind I esteem; I
think our souls have something congenial
in them, and that we were originally designed
for each other.  And if I believed
the doctrine which teaches us that there are
little officious spirits that preside over the
actions of men, I should think that our
two evil geniuses laid their heads together
in conjunction with Miss Burchell's active
demon, to thwart and cross all our measures.
</p><p>I have nothing now left but to pray for
the happiness of one whose lot in this life
he has suffered <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to determine; and to beseech
Heaven that he may never stand in
that fatal predicament which Sir George,
with such outrageous barbarity, marled out
in his vile letter.
</p><p>I now return to myself, and to my present
state; which I think I may say brings

<pb n="57"/>
up the rear of my misfortunes.  Let the
chastisement stop here, and I shall bow me
to it with resignation.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 29.&mdash;Ah, my Cecilia, what an
aggravation is here to the already too deep
regret I began to feel on Mr. Faulkland's
account!  His triumph over me is now complete!
</p><p>In sorting my mother's papers (as I am
to leave these lodgings to-morrow) I found
that letter which Mr. Faulkland wrote to
my brother from Bath.  You may remember
I told you my mother had, in her resentment,
flung it to Sir George, and that,
as it happened to fall on the ground, he had
quitted the room in a passion without taking
it up.  My mother, I suppose, when
she cooled, laid it by, though I dare say
she never looked into it afterwards.  Read
it, and see by what a fatality we have been
governed.

<pb n="58"/>
Mr. Faulkland's letter to Sir George
</p><p>Bidulph.
</p><p>               Bath, May 9, 1703.
</p><p>'How you mortify me, my dear Bidulph,
when you tell me of the happiness I lose
by staying so long at Bath!  <hi rend="italic">The ladies are
impatient to see me</hi>, say you?  Ah! Sir
George, thou hast spoke better of me than
I deserve, I fear.
</p><p>'I am sadly out of humour with myself
at present.  I have got into a very foolish
sort of a scrape here.  My wrist is quite
well, and I should have thrown myself at
Miss Bidulph's feet before now, but to
tell you a secret, my virtue not being proof
against temptation, I have been intercepted.
</p><p>''Tis but a slight lapse, however, a flying
affair; neither my honour, nor my heart
in the question.  A little vagrant Cupid
has contented himself with picking my
pocket, just lightly fluttering through my
breast, and away.

<pb n="59"/>
</p><p>'Are you fallen so low as that, Faulkland,
say you? to <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> the favour of the
fair?  No, George, no; not quite so contemptible
as that neither: and yet, faith,
I did <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> it too, for it cost me three hundred
pounds; but the lady to whom I am
obliged knows nothing of this part of her
own history; at least, I hope so, for my
credit sake.  The case in short is this:
an old gouty officer, and his wife (a very
notable dame; a fine woman too) happened
to lodge in the same house with me.
The man came hither to get rid of his
aches; the lady of her money, and her
virtue, if she has any, for she is eternally
at the card tables.
</p><p>'Under the conduct of this hopeful
guide, came a niece of the husband's;
an extremely fine girl, innocent too, I
believe, and the best dancer I ever saw.  I
don't know how it happened, but she took
a fancy to me, which, upon my word,
and I am sure you have no doubts of me,
I was far from wishing to improve.  You
know I always despised the mean triumph
of gaining a heart, for which I could not

<pb n="60"/>
give another in return.  I saw with pain
her growing inclination for me; but as
we lived in the same house, and met every
day in the rooms, it was impossible for
me to avoid her as much as I wished to
do.  The aunt I found, had her eyes upon
me, and took some pains to promote
a liking on my side.  I saw her
design, and was so much upon my guard,
that she, who I soon found was an adept
in love-matters, almost despaired of gaining
her ends.  The young lady's inclination
however seemed to increase; a pair
of fine blue eyes told me so every day;
and I was upon the point of flying to
avoid the soft contagion, when an accident
happened that totally overthrew all
my good resolutions.
</p><p>'I had not seen the young lady for two
or three days; I enquired for her, and her
aunt answered, with a mysterious smile,
She is ill, poor thing, why don't you look
in upon her, and ask her how she does?
I replied, if the lady will permit me, I will
do myself that honour, and intended literally
to have kept my word, by just

<pb n="61"/>
asking her at her chamber door how she
did.
</p><p>'You are very cruel, said the aunt;
would you persuade me that you don't
know the girl is in love with you?  Oh,
your Servant, Madam; if you think me
vain, I thank you for the reprimand.
Come, come, said she, this is all affectation,
we'll drink tea with her this evening.
Upon my word, said I, if I am to
believe what you say, I think you ought
not to desire me.  I am not blind to the
young lady's merit, but am so unfortunate
as not to have it in my power to
make such returns as she deserves.  I
found the occasion required my being serious.
</p><p>'If you have not love, said she, you
may at least have a little complaisance.
Was there ever such a barbarian, not to
go and see a woman that is dying for him?
I promised to bring you, and she expects
you.  What is the pretty creature afraid
of (patting my cheek).  I'll stay by it all
the while.  There was no withstanding
this; I promised to wait on her.

<pb n="62"/>
</p><p>'She knocked at my door about six
o'clock, and looking in, asked if the coy
Narcissus was ready?  I went with her, and
she led me directly to her niece's chamber.
The young lady looked pale and languishing,
but very pretty.  I was really grieved
to see her, and enquired with an unaffected
concern after her health.  The tea-things were set, and I tried to force something
like conversation, but I believe I
was rather formal.
</p><p>'When we had done tea, the aunt looked
at her watch, started off her chair,
said she had outstaid her appointment
with the party she was to meet at cards,
and turning to me, I hope, Sir, you will
have the <hi rend="italic">Charity</hi> to stay with my niece;
and then hurried out of the room.  I begged
leave to hand her to her chair, intending
to take that opportunity of slipping away,
and resolved to quit the house the next
morning.  But the determined gipsey
was prepared for this motion, and insisting
that I should not stir, thrust me back
from the door, which she shut, and flew
down stairs.

<pb n="63"/>
</p><p>'What was to become of me now,
George?  My situation was dangerous,
and really critical.  To be short, I forgot
my prudence, and found the young lady's
heart too, too tender.
</p><p>'I never felt remorse before.  I never
had cause.  I accuse myself of indiscretion,
but I have not the aggravating addition to
my fault of oaths and promises to fly in
my face.  I made none&mdash;love, foolish love
did all, and led a willing victim to his
altar, who asked nothing in return for
the sacrifice she offered; and received nothing
but unavailing repentence on my
side.
</p><p>'I know not any thing now that would
give me so such pleasure as to find that
the girl hated me heartily, though I have
given her no cause.
</p><p>'A just reparation I cannot make her.
Every thing forbids that thought.  I do
not consider myself as free; but if I were
so, I am not a seducer, and therefore do
not think myself bound to carry my penitence
to such lengths.  The damned aunt
has been the serpent.  And here let me

<pb n="64"/>
explain to yo what I call buying the
lady's favour.  You must know, the aunt
one night (the greatest part of which she
had spent at hazard) lost two hundred
pounds; at least she told me so the next
morning, and with tears in her eyes besought
me, in the most earnest manner, to
lend her that sum.  She said, she should be
undone if her husband were to know it,
and that she would pay me in a very few
days, as she had as much due to her from
different people who had lost to her at
play.  Though our short acquaintance
could hardly warrant her making such a
request, I nevertheless did not hesitate,
but gave her the money directly.  She
meant indeed to pay me, but it was in a
different coin, and this I suppose was the
price she set on the unhappy girl's honour.
</p><p>'My reflections on this unlucky affair
make me very grave.  I have explained
my situation to the young lady, and expressed
my concern at not having it in
my power to be any other than a friend
to her.  She blames her own weakness,

<pb n="65"/>
and her aunt's conduct, but does not reproach
me.  She cannot with justice, yet
I wish she would, for then I should reproach
myself less.
</p><p>'Tis a foolish business, and I must get
off as handsomely as I can.  Prithee, Bidulph,
say something to encourage me,
and put me into more favour with myself.
You have often been my confessor, but
I never wanted absolution so much as
now; nor ever was so well intitled to it,
for I am really full of penitence, and look
<hi rend="italic">so</hi> mortified, you would pity me.  I am
ashamed of having been surprised into a
folly; I who <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to have been upon my
guard, knowing the natural impetuosity
of my own temper.
</p><p>'I must not conclude without telling you,
that this very morning, the precious aunt,
instead of paying me the two hundred
pounds she had of me before, very modestly
requested I would oblige her with
another hundred, to redeem a pair of diamond
ear rings which she had been obliged
to part with for the supply of some
other necessary demands; and with abundance

<pb n="66"/>
of smooth speeches, she assured me,
in a fortnight she would pay me all together,
having notes to that value which
would then become due to her.  I was
such a booby as to give it her.&mdash;Why,
far it well&mdash;I never expect to see a shilling
of it.  She thinks, perhaps, there is
value received for it.  Vile woman!  The
affair fortunately for us all, has not taken
wind; and for me, the names of both
aunt and niece, may ever stand enrolled
amongst those of chaste matrons and virgins.
The family quits this place soon, as
the old gentleman is better.
</p><p>'I thank you for your care, in relation
to my house.  I hope to take possession of
it in a week or ten days; you are very
good in fixing me so near yourself.  Adieu.
</p><p>                    'I am, &amp;c.
</p><p>What do you think of this letter, my
Cecilia, written in confidence to my brother?
Mr. Faulkland could not conceive it
probable that any body but Sir George
should ever see it; he had no reason therefore

<pb n="67"/>
to gloss over any of the circumstances.
<hi rend="italic">Had</hi> I seen it but in time&mdash;Oh what anguish
of heart might we all have been spared!
Miss Burchell singly, as she <hi rend="italic">ought</hi>,
would have borne the punishment of her
folly.
</p><p>My mother had not the patience to read
this letter through; nice and punctilious as
her virtue was, she passed a censure on the
crime in gross, without admitting any palliating
circumstance.  But I blame her not;
the excellence of her own morals, made her
scrupulous in weighing those of others;
she read the letter in a cursory way, and
it is plain but half of it; prepossessed as she
was before, by knowing the material point.
</p><p>The account was given with levity at the
<hi rend="italic">first</hi> mention of the young lady.  Then she
understood he had <hi rend="italic">bought</hi> her of her aunt;
there is a paragraph which <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> like it, and
to be sure she attended not to the explanation.
Fatal oversight! she read not far
enough to have this matter cleared up.
She took nothing but the bare facts into her
account.  A young lady dishonoured, her
disgrace likely to be public, then her tenderness

<pb n="68"/>
for the man who had undone her,
and that man rejecting her, and on the point
of marrying another.  These were the only
points of view in which my mother beheld
the story.  Her justice, her humanity, and
her religion prompted her to act as she did;
and her conduct stands fully acquitted to
my judgment, though my heart must, upon
this full conviction of Mr. Faulkland's honour,
sigh at recollecting the past.
</p><p>I know that the memory of my mother's
own first disastrous love wrought strongly
on her mind.  She was warm in her passions,
liable to deep impressions, and always
adhered strictly to those opinions she first
imbibed.  Her education had been severe
and recluse; and she had drawn all her ideas
of mankind from her own father and mine,
who, I have been told, were both men of
exemplary lives.  From all these considerations,
I must again say, that I entirely acquit
my dear mother, in regard to her whole
conduct, however I have suffered by it.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">October</hi> 30.&mdash;I am now fixed in a very
humble habitation.  Shall I own it to you,

<pb n="69"/>
my Cecilia?  I was shocked at the change.
A room two pair of stairs high, with a
closet, and a small indifferent parlour, compose
the whole of my apartment.  Hither
did my faithful Patty, my tow children,
and myself, remove this day.  It put us not
to much trouble, having nothing to take
with us but our wearing apparel, which is
all the worldly goods of which I am now
possessed.
</p><p>When I wrote to Lady V&mdash;, (which was
a day or two before my mother's death) I
mentioned not that she was then in so dangerous
a way.  I know the generosity and
good nature of that worthy woman; but
I have already been too much obliged to
her to lay any fresh tax on her friendship,
which I am sure she would too readily pay,
if she were acquainted with my situation.
I shall therefore, as long as I can, defer acquainting
her with my mother's death; and
when I do, I shall not give her room to
suspect that my brother has cast me off,
which I have now too much reason to believe
he has; otherwise sure, in more than
a fortnight, he might have found time to

<pb n="70"/>
write to me.  I neither expect ceremony,
nor tenderness form him; but the occasion
of my letter demanded some notice.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nov</hi>. 2.&mdash;Patty has just now been informed,
that Lady Sarah Bidulph is arrived
in town.  She met one of their servants,
who told her that my brother is not come
with her; it seems, they parted on the road.
He is gone to Sidney Castle, which is now
his, and Lady Sarah chose to come to London.
She has, I find, been in London four
days, though she has not yet vouchsafed to
send me any notice of her arrival.  She
could not be at a loss where to find me, as
I left my direction at my former lodging, in
case of any letter, or message, coming from
any of my friends; though I desired the
people of the house not to inform any indifferent
visitants where I was to be found.
</p><p>Though George has, in his turbulent
way, renounced me, as his sister, yet sure
his wife, whom I never disobliged, ought
not to depart so from humanity and common
good breeding, as not to enquire after
the sister of her husband, who has an

<pb n="71"/>
occasion of grief so recent, in which she
ought to partake.  I shall not however take
notice of this slight, but am preparing to
send Patty to her, with an enquiry after her
health, and to know when my brother is
expected in town.&mdash;
</p><p>Patty is just returned from her embassy
to Lady Sarah; I will give you the conversation
she had with her.
</p><p>Patty sent in her message, with great
respect, by a footman, and waited for her
answer in the hall; though her pretty figure
and genteel mourning-dress had induced the
servant to ask her into the house-keeper's
room.
</p><p>Lady Sarah was alone in the parlour, and
desired her to be called to the door.  So,
young woman, said she, your mistress desires
to know when Sir George will be in
town.  I am really surprised after the letter
she received from him, that she can fancy
Sir George means to concern himself about
her.  Do you know her business with him?
you are in your mistress's secrets I suppose.
I do not know, Madam, answered Patty,
what particular business my lady may have

<pb n="72"/>
but I believe it would be a comfort to her
to see her brother in her present melancholy
circumstances.  I don't know that there is
any thing uncommonly melancholy in her
circumstances, replied the lady; her mother's
years and infirmities made her death
a thing to be looked for; I suppose your
mistress is not in <hi rend="italic">want</hi>.  My poor ingenuous
Patty said, she blushed at the cruel
indifference with which Lady Sarah spoke
this.  Not in immediate want, Madam, I
hope, but your ladyship must needs think
she is in a destitute way, with two children,
and but fifty pounds a year in the
world.  What do you mean, woman, cried
Lady Sarah? it is impossible but Lady Bidulph
must have left money behind her;
Sir George, I am sure, has got nothing
but what she could not keep from him.
Patty answered, Lady Bidulph, Madam,
left no money behind her more than what
was barely sufficient to defray some necessary
expences that occurred immediately after
her death.  Well, and so your mistress, I
suppose, after having behaved so ill as she
has done to her brother, expects he should

<pb n="73"/>
provide handsomely for her, and her children;
<hi rend="italic">Arnold's</hi> children for the rest of their
lives.  I know not, Madam, returned Patty,
what my Lady's expectations are, but I believe
she would be very glad to see Sir George
before she goes out of town, or at least inform
him of her design.  What <hi rend="italic">is</hi> her design,
pray, asked Lady Sarah?  To retire
into the country, Madam, as she has not
wherewithal to subsist on in London.  She
can't do better, I think, said the Lady.
Where does she live now?  My poor maid,
who thought this question tended to the
proud woman's calling on, or at least sending
to me, made haste to inform her; she
lodges, Madam, at a milliner's, at the corner
of the Hay-market, the left hand as you
turn&mdash;Oh dear! pray stop: you need not
be so particular, I have no design of paying
her a visit in her corner-shop; my only reason
for enquiring was, to know whether she
had thought proper to keep those expensive
lodgings her mother was in, in expectation
of Sir George's continuing <hi rend="italic">her</hi> in them.  My
Lady has no such view, I believe, Madam.
Well, you may tell your <hi rend="italic">Lady</hi>, that if she

<pb n="74"/>
will go out of town with her children, I will
endeavour to prevail on Sir George to allow
her something.  He will not be in town this
month, so that she need not wait for his arrival.
She might, if she would have been
guided by her brother, have been a credit
to her friends, instead of what she now is.
Patty owns, she was so full of indignation,
that she wished at that moment not to have
been a servant, that she might have reproached
he with her hard-heartedness.  Oh, my
dear, these are the stings of poverty!  It is
not the hard bed, nor the homely board,
but the oppressive insolence of proud prosperity;
tis that only which can inflict a
wound on the ingenuous mind.
</p><p>As for that mean woman, I despise her
too much to suffer myself to be obliged
to her.  <hi rend="italic">She will endeavour to prevail on my
brother</hi>.  If his own heart cannot prevail
on him, I disclaim her influence; I
know she means not to use it in my favour;
on the contrary, I make no doubt
but she will endeavour to irritate Sir
George against me by misrepresentations.
Her pride makes her wish to have an indigent

<pb n="75"/>
relation out of the way, yet her avarice
would not suffer her to enable me to retire;
and she will make my continuing here
through necessity a pretence for still with-holding any assistance from me.  Let it be
so; I would rather submit to the most abject
drudgery, than owe a wretched dependant
existence to such a woman.  I am sure
my brother, notwithstanding his resentment,
if he knew what my situation truly
is, would not behave with cruelty; but my
mind is not become so sordid, fallen as I
am, as to turn petitioner for relief.  But
no more, my Cecilia, let not my fate interrupt
your happiness.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 4.&mdash;I have had a letter from
Mrs. Faulkland, filled with the overflowings
of a joyful heart.  She says, Mr.
Faulkland is so delighted with the country
he is in, and finds his estate capable of such
vast improvement, that he thinks of making
a longer residence there than he at first
intended: the rather as he has some suspicions
that his agent has not acted faithfully
by him; and as he is sure the extensive plan

<pb n="76"/>
that he has now laid down, will be better
executed under his own eye.  He purposes
building a little convenient lodge on a very
charming spot in the centre of his estate,
where he may reside whilst his works are
carrying on; so that Mrs. Faulkland promises
herself much pleasure, in spending
her time partly there and partly in Dublin.
She has already made a large circle of acquaintance,
and bestows high encomiums
on the great politeness and hospitality with
which they are received by all the fashionable
people in the county.
</p><p>She knows not of my mother's death;
yet in my answer to her letter, I cannot
avoid mentioning it.  Though I could with
for obvious reasons to conceal it.  Mr.
Faulkland well knows the ruin of our fortune;
and though he cannot suppose while I
have a brother living that I am driven to
such streights, yet I know what his liberal
heart may suggest to him on this occasion,
which might lay me under fresh difficulties.
</p><p>I have but just now apprised Lady V&mdash;
of the decease of my dear mother, but
have not insinuated any other grief than

<pb n="77"/>
the loss of a tender parent, and an agreeable
companion.  Indeed I have carried my
dissimulation so far as not to desire this lady
to change her address to me, lest if I gave
her my present direction, she might be led
to think, necessity had obliged me to change
my former lodgings for worse.  I shall use
the same precaution towards Mrs. Faulkland,
as I have obtained permission from
the gentlewomen whose house I lately left,
to have my letters sent thither: when I go
into the country a general direction to the
post-house may suffice.  I shall now look
out for some little spot to retire to, where
I can support life on the cheapest terms.
In two months I shall have my small pittance
due to me, which I reserve to carry
me out of town, and to settle me in my
new scheme of oeconomy in the country.
If I could persuade my poor Patty to quit
me, and see her settled in some eligible situation,
I should then have no material concern
to attend to, but the bringing up my
children in the paths of virtue and humility.
Humility, that happy frame of mind,

<pb n="78"/>
on which so much of our temporal as well
as our eternal welfare depends.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 9.&mdash;Who shall say, now is the
measure of my griefs complete: Providence
thou canst inflict no more!  Oh my
sister, in the midst of other sorrows, I
thought not of one that still remained behind;
my children, my two little angels!
both dangerously ill.  The small-pox is
their distemper, and of the worst kind.
The disease has been hanging over them
for some days, and my close attendance on
them, prevented me from using my pen.
The cruel distemper now appears with the
most malignant symptoms.  The eldest always
slept with me; I have resigned my
bed to her for these three last nights, and
have watched by her.  Patty has done the
same by the youngest.  A humane and
skilful physician attends them, but my reliance
rests not on him.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 12.&mdash;Three days and nights of
sorrowful anxiety have at length produced a
little comfort to me.  The distemper has

<pb n="79"/>
now reached one crisis, whence the physician
can form a judgment with some degree
of certainty, and he bids me hope.
Oh if it were not for that healing word,
how could the wretched drag on existence
from day to day?  I do, I will hope, for
there is a merciful providence that superintends
his works.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nov</hi>. 21.&mdash;Thank God! thank God!
my Cecilia, the dear babes are out of danger.
Fifteen melancholy days and nights
has their disconsolate mother watched by
the poor little sufferers; but I am fully
repaid by having them restored to my
prayers.  They are now able to sit up, and
open their pretty eyes which had been closed
for many days; and to add to my satisfaction
I think they will not be marked:
but they are still so feeble that it will be at
least another fortnight before I can think of
venturing their little tender frames out of
doors.
</p><p>The physician's care and diligence deserved
a greater recompence than I had it in
my power to make him; however what I

<pb n="80"/>
have done has reduced me to a single guinea.
But this affects me not; I shall make
no difficulty of parting with some of my
now unnecessary fineries, which neither I
nor my children probably will ever again
have any pretensions to wear.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 22.&mdash;I have felt the wounds of
grief, the pangs of disappointment, and the
smart of indignation! yet was my heart never
more sensibly affected than it was just
now by a circumstance proceeding from a
cause very different from all these.  I had
taken out of my drawers a few superfluous
ornaments, which I desired Patty to dispose
of as if they were her own, to the woman
where we lodge; being things in her own
way of business.  The poor girl looked at
me for some time with a grief in her countenance
that pierced me to the soul.  There
is no need, Madam, said she, with her voice
almost stifled, there is need I hope as
yet for this.  You don't consider Patty, said
I, that the children's weak condition requires
now a more than ordinary attention to their
diet; and I have not sufficient to supply

<pb n="81"/>
them long with such necessaries as they
want.  I have no occasion for these trifles,
and I cannot see my little ones droop for
want of such comfortable nourishment as
may restore them to their strength.  Nor
shall they want it Madam, answered Patty;
don't be angry with me Madam, if I beg
you will let me use my endeavours to supply
them.  What do you mean, said I, I
know the goodness of your disposition, but
how have you it in your power?  You know
Madam, said she, I am pretty expert at my
needle; and as our landlady has always
abundance of work on her hands, I undertook
to assist her, and have for this fortnight
past, while I was closely confined to
miss's room, finished a piece of curious
work, for which she has this day paid me
thirty shillings.  You amaze me, said I, I
never saw you employed otherwise than in
your attendance on the child.  I was afraid
you would be displeased, Madam, she replied,
and always hid my work when you
came into the room, which I could easily
do, as it was only a fine piece of point which
I was grounding; and as I sat up night and

<pb n="82"/>
day, I had an opportunity of sticking almost
constantly to it, which enabled me to do in
a fortnight, what to another hand would
be a month's labour.  Now, Madam, with
your leave, I can go on in this manner,
and though perhaps I cannot always earn so
much, yet I am sure I can still procure
enough to prevent your being drove to the
necessity of parting with your apparel, till
we are in a condition to leave such an expensive
place as London is.  And do you
think my dear Patty, said I, with tears of
affection and gratitude in my eyes, that I
will consent to take the fruits of your ingenious
and honest industry from you?  No,
no, if you can find time by these means
to procure a little supply for your own
pocket, do so; but I will not suffer you to
expend a farthing of what you can earn, on
my account.  I saw she looked distressed
and confounded; excuse me, Madam, said
she, but I have made bold to lay out part
of the money already; I thought the poor
children would want a little wine to nourish
them, and indeed, Madam, you spirits want
some support after your long fatigue.  I

<pb n="83"/>
have bought a few bottles of win, Madam,
and some other little necessaries; I hope you
will not take it ill.
</p><p>I pressed the affectionate creature's hand;
I cannot be angry with you, Patty, for your
goodness, but such proofs of it as these distress
me more than my wants could.  I accept
of your kindness for this time, but insist
on your not doing such a thing again.  If
there be occasion for it, I can apply to my
needle as well as you, and would sooner do
so, than part with any of my things, since it
gives you so much uneasiness.
</p><p>The poor girl was rejoiced at my acceptance
of her friendly and tender offer, and
produced her little purchase, which was indeed
both seasonable and useful
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nov.</hi>23.&mdash;I had this day a letter from
Lady V&mdash;.  I send you a copy of it.
</p><p>'I condole with you, my dear Mrs. Arnold,
on the afflicting loss you sustained in
your good mother's death.  You mention
not any particular consequences from this
accident; but I know, that by Lady Bidulph's

<pb n="84"/>
death, you are deprived of a considerable
part of your income, and on this
account I have taken the liberty of friendship,
to send you a supply, which your family-calls may require, till your affairs are
settled upon a better footing.
</p><p>'Let me know how you and your brother
stand; if he should not be so kind to you
as he ought, I insist upon your looking on
me as your banker, who know not how to
make so good a use of my income, as sharing
it with those I love as do you.
</p><p>                    'I am, &amp;c.'
</p><p>The supply which Lady V&mdash; mentioned,
accompanied this letter, and was a bank bill
of three hundred pounds.
</p><p>I own to you, my Cecilia, that my first
emotions were only those of joy, surprize,
and gratitude, for so unexpected and important
a donation; but when those were a
little subsided, I began to reflect on the nature,
and manner of this noble act of friendship.
I know Lady V&mdash; is one of the best
women living; that she is generous, and
compassionate, and has always honoured me

<pb n="85"/>
with a particular regard; yet I must confess
to you, her present now comes to me suspected.
I believe I told you, that Lady V&mdash;
had retired into Lancashire, to live with an
only sister she has there: this Lady is a widow,
and I have since been informed, was
left with a very numerous young family, and
an income scarce sufficient to support them
genteelly; they are now most of them grown
up, and all the girls, of which there are five,
unprovided for.  Since Lady V&mdash;'s departure,
I have been told, that it was principally
on account of these young girls, of
whom she is extremely fond, that she went
to reside with her sister, in order to support
them more agreeably to their rank; their
father having been a general officer, and a
man of high birth.  Lady V&mdash;'s jointure is
a thousand pounds a year; but as I hear the
family make a respectable figure in the
country, and I am sure Lady V&mdash;'s fondness
for her nieces, would induce her to
save what she could, in order to leave them
something at her death, I cannot reconcile
it to her prudence, notwithstanding the
liberality of her spirit, and the friendship

<pb n="86"/>
she has for me, that she should make so considerable
a present, and at the same time
give me as it were an unbounded letter of
credit on her.  Had she sent me the sixth
part of the sum, I should not have doubted
its being only the effects of her kindness towards
me; and in her present situation, as
considerable a proof of it, as she ought in
regard to her family to have given to one
whom she has already bound under strong
obligations.  But the largeness of the sum
renders it suspicious; and to tell you the
secret inspirations of my heart, I fear it
comes from a different quarter.
</p><p>I made Mrs. Faulkland acquainted with
my mother's death, about the same time that
I informed Lady V&mdash; of it.  To neither did
I give the most distant hint of my circumstances,
yet Mr. Faulkland knows they cannot
be happy.  He too knows better than
any body, how far Sir George's resentment
may carry him.  Is it not natural then, my
dear, to imagine that this man, who is generosity
itself, should have taken this method
of making Lady V&mdash; the channel through
which he conveys his liberality?  I am sure

<pb n="87"/>
it must be so.  It is three weeks since Lady
V&mdash; had the notice of my mother's death;
Why thought she not sooner of reaching out
her supporting hand, if she imagined I
stood in need of it?  I gave her no cause to
believe I did; otherwise I make no question
of her ready friendship, as far as her abilities
would go: but <hi rend="italic">she</hi> could not know as well as
Mr. Faulkland how much my brother was
exasperated against me, and therefore could
not suppose me to be as destitute as I really
am.  She desires to know how my brother
and I stand.  This question is not Her's;
Sir George, for his own credit, perhaps has
not told Mr. Faulkland what his conduct
has been towards me, but he wants to be
informed.  Contriving man!  I will disappoint
him; nor shall he heap such obligations
on me as must sink me under their
weight.  I will not receive this suspected
gift of Lady V&mdash;'s; but it is a delicate
point, and, whilst I refuse, I must take care
not to offend.  I will send Lady V&mdash; her
bill back again, but in such a manner as to
shew her, I refuse her gift for no other reason
but its being too valuable.

<pb n="88"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 24.&mdash;See, my Cecilia, whether
I have succeeded in my endeavours to refuse,
with a good grace, my Lady V&mdash;'s offered
kindness.
</p><p>This is my answer to her.
</p><p>     To Lady V&mdash;.
</p><p>'You oppress me, my dear and ever honoured
Lady V&mdash;, by a generosity and
friendship that knows no bounds.  Why
will you force me to appear proud, or ungrateful,
by refusing the favours of so true
a friend?  But, my dear Madam, do not
believe me either the one or the other.
Had you sent me a trifling token of your
love, you would have been convinced of
my respect for you, by the thankfulness
with which I would have accepted it; but
do not seek to humble me so far, my good
Lady V&mdash;, by heaping favours on me,
which I can never have a prospect of returning.
With equal respect and gratitude,
permit me, Madam, to return your
too considerable present.  I cannot, in
honour, receive a liberality, which I am

<pb n="89"/>
so little intitled to; and the less, as Justice
now demands, that your bounteous heart,
so diffusive in its generosity, should a little
restrain itself.
</p><p>'I cannot say that my circumstances are
as happy as they have been; yet have I,
I thank Heaven, accommodated my mind
to them.  My brother has not been in
town since my mother's death; but I am
not without hope that he will make my
situation easy.  On this account, I know
my dear Lady V&mdash; will the more readily
pardon my refusal of her obliging offer,
and believe that her goodness is not bestowed
on an unthankful heart.
</p><p>                    'I am, &amp;c.'
</p><p>In this letter I re-inclosed her bill, and
have sent it off.  Did I not well, my Cecilia?
If, as I strongly suspect, this present
came from Mr. Faulkland, I should never
endure myself, had I retained it.  If it
should have really come from Lady V&mdash;
herself, I must still approve my own conduct.
The sum (circumstanced as she now
is) was certainly too much for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> to bestow,

<pb n="90"/>
or <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to receive; and in the manner
of my refusal, I think I have insinuated
this, with as much deference for Lady V&mdash;'s
judgment as I could shew.  She will see
my motive, and I think that will be a sort
of touch-stone, whereby I shall discover,
from her behaviour, whether my doubts are
well grounded or not.&mdash;
</p><p>Patty has, by her enquiries, heard of a
little pleasant retirement in the country,
about fifty miles off, where my children
and I can be tolerably lodged and boarded
for thirty pounds a year, at the house of an
honest farmer, a relation of hers; thither I
shall repair as soon as my little girls are in
a condition to be removed.
</p><p>     [<hi rend="italic">Continued by Patty.</hi>]
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nov</hi>. 26.&mdash;The dismal task is fallen upon
me again, to keep an account of our
melancholy days.  My dear suffering lady is
seized with a fever, and confined to her bed.
She orders me, Madam, to write down every
thing as it happens.  Lord keep us! there
is nothing but sorrows in this world: I am

<pb n="91"/>
sure, at least, my poor lady has had her
full share of them.  Her close attendance
on the children, and the loss of rest for so
many nights, has brought this new affliction
on her.  Oh, Madam, the loss of health is
a grievous thing, even when there are
riches: what must it be in my lady's circumstances?
But she has the patience of
Job himself.  To be sure, Madam, her trials
are enough to put another beside themselves;
but I think my lady's courage encreases with
her troubles.  I was obliged, to-day, with
an aching heart, to dispose of a fine lace
head of my lady's.  I heard her say, it cost
sixty pounds; but, though it never was wet
but once, I got but fifteen for it, and this,
perhaps, may all go to the doctor, if my
lady's illness continues long.  What does it
signify?  We cannot buy health too dear.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nov</hi>. 30&mdash;My lady is better between
whiles; the doctor says, her disorder is
chiefly on her spirits; and, though it is not
dangerous, he is afraid it will be very
tedious.  Lord! what will become of us
if it is?

<pb n="92"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 3.&mdash;My lady has had a letter
this day, from Lady V&mdash;, which she has ordered
me to send you, Madam, a copy of.
</p><p>     To Mrs. Arnold.
</p><p>'You cannot imagine, my dear Mrs. Arnold,
how uneasy you have made me, by
your not accepting of the bill I sent you,
because I too well know the occasion you
have for it.  But, since you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> refused
(and I know the sincerity and strength
of your resolutions) I must not take to
myself the merit of this friendly and generous
offer; too liberal indeed, as you,
with great delicacy, hinted, for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> to
make.  To let you into the secret at once,
ad that your gratitude may be directed
to the proper place, it was from our noble
friend Mr. Faulkland that I received
that sum, with instructions to send it to
you, as from myself, for he well knows
you would not have accepted it from him;
but, since I see you determined to reject
it, as coming even from me, I think I

<pb n="93"/>
ought, in justice to him, to place this act
of friendship to the right account.
</p><p>'I had a letter lately from Mr. Faulkland,
wherein he tells me, that having
heard, from your correspondence with
Mrs. Faulkland, of Lady Bidulph's death,
he fears you are, by her loss, rendered extremely
unhappy in your circumstances.
He is not a stranger to the losses you formerly
sustained in your fortune, and he
says besides, he knows your brother's warm
temper so well, that he is apprehensive he
will carry an unreasonable resentment he
has taken up so far, as to deny you that
brotherly kindness and assistance, which
you have a right to expect from him.  "If
this should be the case" (he adds) "what
must be Mrs. Arnold's situation?"  'He
then conjures me to convey to you that
trifle (as he called it) under the sanction
of my own name, that being the only one
from which he had a hope it would not be
refused; and he farther said, that if you
should be prevailed upon, on account of
the friendship which he knew there was
between you and me, to accept of my

<pb n="94"/>
service, he would contrive, from time
to time, to furnish you with such little
supplies, as might make you easy, 'till
Sir George and you should be on better
terms.  Now, my dear Mrs. Arnold, you
have the truth of this whole affair.  I own
it was with great reluctance I lent my
name to impose on you, but, as it was so
much for your benefit, I overcame my
scruple.
</p><p>'I could wish your extreme nicety had
not forbid you to accept this offer: I have
reason to be angry with you on this account;
yet my amiable, sagacious friend,
perhaps you had your doubts.  Be that as
it will, remember you said you would not
have refused a small token of my love; I
wish I could send you one worthy of your
acceptance, and the love I bear you; we
should then see whose punctilio should get
the better.  As it is, I send you a very
small token, which I insist on your taking,
if you have the least occasion for it; if
this should be the case, I know the candour
of your heart, and that you will be too
ingenuous to grieve me by a refusal.

<pb n="95"/>
</p><p>'I hope Mr. Faulkland will not be angry
with me for betraying his secret; But what
would it now avail to keep it?  I would
have <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as well as myself, know his
worth.  Oh how I lament&mdash;but it is
to no purpose&mdash;Adieu, my dear good
creature! you are tried like fine gold, and
your excellence is become the more conspicuous
by adversity&mdash;.
</p><p>                         'I am, &amp;c.'
</p><p>My Lady's spirits were greatly affected by
reading this letter; she wept bitterly, and
was so cast down all day, I was afraid it
would make her disorder much worse.  The
good Lady V&mdash; inclosed a bill of fifty
pounds in it.  My Lady said she must not
refuse it, but would thank her ladyship
whenever she was able to take a pen in her
hand.  God knows when that will be; for
though she struggles with her illness, it still
gets the mastery.  The two young misses
mend but slowly; they do not gather the
least strength, and one of them has such a
weakness in her eyes that she cannot bear
the least light.  Indeed, Madam, this is a

<pb n="96"/>
most melancholy family.  I pray to God
night and day to keep me in my health,
more for their sakes than my own; for I
think it would quite break my heart if they
should want my attendance, and I should
not be able to give it to them.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 6.&mdash;I write on, Madam, as I
am ordered, though I have but little to say,
in the confinement of a dismal sick room,
where I never see any body but a doctor and
an apothecary: but my lady is unwilling to
let this packet go, till she is able herself to
tell you (with her own hand) that she is better,
for fear my dull account should make
you uneasy.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">December</hi> 7.&mdash;There is such changes and
turns in my lady's disorder, that we do not
know what to make of it.  One while we
think she is a little better, and then again
the next hour she seems much worse than
before.  The doctor would have a consultation,
though my lady is quite against it;
but these doctors love to bring in one another.
My Lady V&mdash;'s present came in

<pb n="97"/>
good time, but if they go on at this rate it
will not last long.  My lady said to me today,
Patty one would think that I was of
great consequence, and mighty happy, by
this bustle to preserve my life; but there is
the tie (pointing to the children); for
their sakes I must try to get well.
[After an interval of six weeks written by
</p><p>Mrs. Arnold in a hand scarce legible.]
</p><p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 20.&mdash;Restored at length by the
mercy of God from the jaws of death! restored
to my children, to my dear Cecilia,
and just able to tell her with a feeble hand
that her Sidney lives.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 25.&mdash;I am now able, my dear,
to reassume that task, once the most pleasing
of my life, when health, joy, and prosperity
gilded all my days.  The scene is now
changed; and I think I have nothing the
same about me, but the feelings and affections
of my mind.  You cannot imagine,
my Cecilia, how I am altered; you would
not now say, that you envied my white and
red; you would hardly know me, and it is

<pb n="98"/>
not to be wondered at, preyed on as I have
been for near two months by a slow but
tormenting fever.  It is with difficulty that
I hold my pen, but my willing hand obeys
my heart when it would pour itself out to
thee.  I have made a shift to scrawl a few
lines to my good Lady V&mdash;, to thank her
for her kindness.  I could not refuse it! it
would indeed have been disingenuous, considering
the footing on which she put my
acceptance of it.  I should have been driven
to extreme streights, if it had not been for
her present, confined as long as I have been
to the languishing bed of sickness.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 26.&mdash;Patty heard to-day that
my brother has been in town some time,
but he takes no notice of me.  I have not
a relation in the world but himself.  He
could not sure be so cruel, if he knew all.
But Lady Sarah keeps it from him; she
thinks perhaps I am slunk into some obscure
corner, where she leaves me to distress.
Sir George is not of a savage nature, yet
his humanity is not strong enough to seek
out the afflicted.  His pride too I know is

<pb n="99"/>
gratified by having me out of the way of
observation, and so long as I do not call
upon him, I find he will not enquire after
me.
</p><p>The winter is now so far advanced, and
I am in a condition so extremely weak, that
I cannot, till the spring advances a little,
think of taking my flight to my peaceful retreat
in the country.  I look eagerly forward
to the time of my enlargement; such
I may call it, for indeed, my dear, my
spirits are quite exhausted with my long
confinement in a little close lodging in this
irksome town.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 27.&mdash;The gentlewoman with
whom I lodged in St. Alban's-street, told
Patty, who went to her house to-day to enquire
if there were any letters for me, that
there have been, at different time, several
people of my former acquaintance to look
for me; but I do not find that one enquiry
has come from my brother.  I had given
the gentlewoman instructions not to tell any
stranger where I lodged.  I believe this
caution was needless, there are few who

<pb n="100"/>
give themselves the trouble to trace out the
steps of the unhappy; and I dare say, that
those whom common form obliged to pay
me a visit of condolence on my mother's
death, were none of them much hurt at the
disappointment of not finding me.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 30.&mdash;I have been laying down
a little sort of plan for my future life.  I
told you the terms I could live upon with
the farmer whom Patty found out for me;
but as I cannot expect to be boarded at so
cheap a rate when my children are grown
bigger, I have been devising the means
how to enlarge my scanty income against
the time that our wants must necessarily
increase; for I am firmly resolved my kind
Lady V&mdash; shall never augment the debt I
already owe her.  You know, my dear, I
am pretty dexterous at my needle; the woman
where I lodge deals in embroidery,
which is much in fashion, and I think I
have not seen any, though she pays largely
to her artificers in this way, equal to some
pieces of my own work.  Now, my Cecilia,
I have resolved to apply myself to this when

<pb n="101"/>
I get into the country.  I shewed the woman
a small fire-skreen wrought by me
when I was a girl, the same which I remember
my poor Mr. Arnold accused me
of neglecting for my Horace, and which
had never been made up; she said the work
was so curious, that she would give any
price for such a hand.  Patty is well skilled
in this sort of work too, and as I find she
is determined not to quit me, I must, in
return, endeavour not to let the poor girl
be too great a sufferer for her kindness.
</p><p>I think we shall between us be able to do
a good deal, and my landlady has promised
to receive and dispose of our work for a
small consideration, as fast as we can send
it to her; which we shall have constant opportunities
of doing.
</p><p>You cannot imagine how pleased I am
with my scheme.  Patty is in raptures at
the thoughts of her being permitted to continue
with me.  I would even now set
about my project if my health would allow
me; but alas! my Cecilia, I am still so feeble,
I am not able to sit up more than an
hour or two at a time; and cannot walk

<pb n="102"/>
a-cross my narrow room without help.
Fresh air and a little gentle exercise would
I am sure, more than any thing, contribute
to restore my strength; but the means to
procure these, are not conveniently within
my power; so that I must wait that slow,
but generally sure remedy, patience.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 10.&mdash;I have a wonderful incident
to relate to you! you, my Cecilia, I
know will join with me in admiring and
praising God for his gracious providence!
</p><p>This morning I was but just risen and
got down into my little parlour, when
Patty came to tell me, a man desired to
speak with me.  I immediately ordered him
to be admitted.  Patty accordingly introduced
the person, who had stood in the entry
whilst she was speaking to me.  He
seemed to be a man between forty and fifty
years old, mean in his apparel, though
clean.  I nodded to my maid to leave
the room, which when she had done, I
civilly demanded of the stranger his business.
</p><p>I was standing when he entered the room,

<pb n="103"/>
and continued doing so while I spoke to
him, not thinking from his appearance that
he was intitled to sit down with me.  You
know I am not proud, but there is a sort of
usage established, which we naturally fall
into.  The man who had advanced some
steps into the room, looked over his shoulder
as if for a chair; so I understood the motion,
and accordingly sat down myself, and
bad him do so too.  He did, and with an air
as if he considered the civility to be only
what was due to him.
</p><p>I believe, Madam, said he, though you
do not remember me, that you cannot be
ignorant of your having had a relation of
the name of Warner, who went to the West-Indies about five and twenty years ago.  I
answered, I do remember to have heard of
such a person.
</p><p>You see that unfortunate man before
you, he replied; I am your near relation,
Madam, your father was my mother's
only brother: I have been very unhappy,
I lost, in my return to England, what almost
five and twenty years industry had
scraped together: the sum was but a moderate

<pb n="104"/>
one, yet sufficient to have supported
me decently for the remainder of my
life.  I asked him, how it happened?  I
began, said he, to grow sickly abroad, and
was told that my native air might restore
me.  This advice so well agreed with my
own inclinations, which were, for a long
time past, bent upon returning home, that
I took the first opportunity of a ship bound
for England; but we were unluckily met
by a French privateer, who stripped me of
every thing but the cloaths on my back,
and set me on sore on the coast of Spain,
whence I begged my passage to England,
having nothing to support me but a few
shillings, part of a collection, made for me
and my fellow-sufferers, amongst some
English gentlemen.
</p><p>Whilst he spoke, I thought I could discover
a likeness in his face to my father.
He was reckoned extremely to resemble his
sister, the mother of this unhappy Mr.
Warner; she was a fine woman, and I had
seen her picture.  His story was credible;
and I had no reason to doubt the truth of
what he said.
</p><p>
<pb n="105"/>
</p><p>And here I will give you a brief account
of what occasioned this unfortunate relation
to be thus long an alien from his family.
</p><p>His mother, as you have just now heard,
was my father's sister, who threw her person
and her fortune away upon a broken officer.
This act disobliged my father so
much, that from the time of her marriage,
to the hour of her death, he never would
see her.  Her husband died, when this their
only child was about nine years old; the
poor mother survived him but a short time,
and the orphan boy was left to my father's
mercy.  I have often heard him say he was
very unlucky, and never could be persuaded
into a love of his book; he was, however,
put to school, and my father bestowed the
same expence on his education, as if he had
been his own son.  When he was about
sixteen years old, as he wrote a good hand,
and had a great capacity for figures, he
bound him apprentice to a merchant, in
which situation he had been above a year,
(and during that time he had made several
elopements, and was with difficulty reconciled
to his master, through my father's mediation)

<pb n="106"/>
when he committed such a misdemeanour
in his master's family as obliged
him to abscond.  Accordingly he stole,
unknown to any body, on board a ship
bound to the West-Indies, of which his master
was partly owner, where he hid himself,
and nobody could tell what was become of
him, 'till my father, about nine months after
his departure, received a letter from him,
dated from Jamaica, wherein he begged
pardon of him, and his master, for his
elopement, told him, that he had been taken
into a merchant's compting-house, and declared,
that he meant, by his diligence and
good behaviour, to make amends for his
past ill conduct.  This was the only letter
my father or any of his friends ever had
from him.  He answered it, but had no
return; nor could he, from repeated enquiries,
made two or three years after, learn
any thing of him; so that all his relations
concluded him dead.
</p><p>These particulars I had heard before from
my father, and his relations perfectly agreeing
with them in every circumstance, I
could have no doubt but that he was the

<pb n="107"/>
man.  Sir, said I, I very well remember
to have heard your story; your likeness to
my father, who was the image of your mother,
leaves me no room to question your
being the Mr. Warner, of whom I have so
often heard: you are indeed my near relation,
and it grieves my heart to see you in
such distress; and the more so, as I have
not the ability I could wish to assist you;
but we will talk over more particulars after
breakfast.  I rang the bell, and ordered
Patty to get some coffee.  While we were
at breakfast, I asked my new-found kinsman
by what means he had discovered me
so soon? (for, by the way, I should have
told you that he said he had been arrived
but two days in London).  He answered,
that one of the English gentlemen, who
had been kind to him at Cadiz, had given
him a letter to a gentleman in London, for
whom he was to leave it at a coffee-house
in Pall-mall; that as he was delivering it,
he perceived another letter lying on the
bar, directed to Sir George Bidulph.  The
two names struck him, remembring them
to be those of his cousin.  His uncle,

<pb n="108"/>
he supposed, was dead; but he determined
to enquire who that gentleman was,
and if he found it to be my brother, to apply
to him for assistance.  He had soon an
opportunity of being satisfied; my brother
happened to come in his chariot to the
door, just as mr. Warner was going out;
he knew the arms, and had some recollection
even of his features.  It was past three
o'clock, said he, and I heard Sir George direct
his servant home.  I concluded he was
gong to dinner, and that the morning was
the properest time to call on him, and having
informed myself where he lived, I accordingly
went yesterday morning.
</p><p>He stopped, and sipped his coffee for
some time without speaking.
</p><p>And did you see him, Sir?  Yes, Madam,
I saw him, and heard him too.  He has got
a fine house, and seems to have every thing
very elegant about him.  When I was let
into the hall, I desired the footman to acquaint
his master that a gentleman, newly
arrived from the West-Indies, wanted to
speak with him, being commissioned by
Mr. Warner, a relation of his, to enquire
after him.  The footman went upstairs,

<pb n="109"/>
and returning presently, asked me if
I brought a letter from the gentleman I
mentioned.  I said, No, but I had something
to say to him.
</p><p>The servant, after delivering this message,
came half way down the first flight of
the stairs, and leaning over the banisters,
he bid me walk up.  I found your brother,
and his lady (I suppose) in her dressing-room, at breakfast.  There was tea and
chocolate on the table.  I bowed very respectfully;
the lady scarce moved her head;
your brother said, Your servant, Sir, and
viewed me from head to foot, but fixed his
eyes earnestly on my face.  The footman
who introduced me had withdrawn.  Sir,
said I, have you quite forgot me?  I remember
you well.  He answered hesitatingly,
and with a change of countenance that
boded me no good, I protest, Sir,&mdash;I&mdash;I
know nothing of you.  'Have you forgot
your cousin Ned Warner?'  He looked at
his wife, and she at him; he forced a smile
at her, which she returned, without knowing
for what.  'I do remember there was
such a one related to the family, whom we
all supposed to be dead; as for recollecting

<pb n="110"/>
his person&mdash;'tis really so long ago&mdash;
that I&mdash;can't say I do.'  All this while
he let me stand, he was lolling in an easy
chair, and had a dish of chocolate in his
hand, of which he sipped and spoke to me
by turns.  His wife was feeding a monkey
that was perched on her shoulder.
</p><p>I am indeed more altered than you, Sir
George; the hardships which I have undergone,
and my long residence inn a warmer
climate, may readily account for that; but
have you no traces of my features?  No recollection
of my voice?  I have carried you
many times in my arms.  'Sir, I do not
dispute the <hi rend="italic">identity</hi> of your person, but I
should be glad to know your commands
with me.'  <hi rend="italic">Commands</hi> I have none, Sir:
the poor must entreat, not command.
</p><p>I then proceeded to tell him my unhappy
story in the same words I just now gave it
to you.  His lady seemed not to mind me,
but kept talking to her marmouset.  He
listened to me, but with so much impatience
in his looks, as quite abashed me.  I
was still standing, but a little to take off

<pb n="111"/>
the aukwardness of my posture, I had ventured
to rest one arm n the back of a chair.
</p><p>When I had done speaking, your brother
got up in a violent passion, to which he
seemed to have been working himself up
during the time I took to explain myself.
He whisked away the chair on which I was
leaning, and walked to the other end of the
room; then turning to his lady, Is not
this a pretty fellow to force his way in upon
us, by a sham story of a message from a relation?
and now truly, by way of an agreeable
surprize he turns out to be that very
relation come a begging in his own proper
person.  Sir, said I, I ask your pardon for
the liberty I took to gain admittance to you,
but you will be the more inclined to excuse
me, if you please to consider that it was out
of respect to you that I would not in the
mean appearance I now make, acknowlege
myself to any of your servants; for
the same reasons I imagined, that had I not
sent a message which I was in hopes would
have a little interested you in my favour,
I might have been ordered to send up my
business by your footman, which would

<pb n="112"/>
I thought have been quite improper.  You
might have writ, said he, interrupting me.
Ah Sir, (shaking my head) if I <hi rend="italic">had</hi>&mdash;and
I stopped short.  'You might not have
been much the better for it: Is that what
you would say? (with a contemptuous
half sneer.)  In short, Sir, I can do nothing
for you; what is it that you expect I
<hi rend="italic">should</hi> do?'  I do not mean to be a burden
to you Sir, I replied, I was bred to business,
I write a good hand, and understand accounts.
I hope to get into some merchant's
house; but in the mean time I am starving.
I am an utter stranger here, though
in my own country.  I observed he had
slipped his hand into his breeches pocket,
and seemed to be feeling for a bit of money.
Sir George, said the lady, (who had
observed him as well as I) 'tis to no purpose
to give any thing to these sort of people;
assist one, and They will send another to
you, and so there is no end to such claims.
Your brother withdrew his hand from his
pocket, as if checked by his lady's looks.
Sir, it is not in my power to assist you.'
I then asked him if you were living, and

<pb n="113"/>
where I could find you? for though you
were not born when I left England, I heard
afterwards that Sir Robert Bidulph had a
daughter.  Your brother replied peevishly
he knew nothing of you, as you preferred
the friendship of strangers to that of your
relations.  He then rang the bell, and calling
his man to dress him, went out of the
room without casting a look at me.  I ventured
to ask his lady your name (if you had
changed it) and where you lived.  She told
me your name, but said she knew not where
you lodged, adding I might spare myself
the trouble of enquiring you out, for to her
knowlege you could do nothing for me.
</p><p>I took my leave, but enquiring of a
footman whom I found in the hall, he directed
me to St. Alban's Street, where you
formerly lodged.  I went there, and it was
with difficulty that I could prevail on the
woman of the house to tell me where you
now lived; but my necessities made me urgent,
and I waited on you this morning,
Madam, to make my distress known to
you; but I am afraid the information I had
from your sister-in-law concerning you has

<pb n="114"/>
but too much truth in it.  As he spoke
this he cast his eyes round my meanly furnished
parlour, looked at the poor equipage
of my tea-table, and again sipped his unfinished
and now cold dish of coffee.
</p><p>Sir, said I, when my sister informed you
that I was poor, it is certain she spoke
truth; I am not, however, I thank God, <hi rend="italic">so</hi>
poor, but that I can spare you a little; if
you will take a cheap lodging near me, I
will supply you with enough to pay for it;
and if you can eat as I and my little family
do, you shall be welcome to us every day
till something can be done for you.  I see
but very few people, but I will speak to
such as come in my way to try to have you
recommended to some one for employment.
I then put my hand in my pocket, and
taking out five shillings (all the silver I had)
I put it into his hand: Sir, you may owe
some little trifle were you have slept these
two nights, I fear your lodging has been
but poor, but if this will not discharge it
tell me freely.
</p><p>He suffered me to drop the shillings into
his unclosed hand.  He fixed his eyes eagerly

<pb n="115"/>
on my face, but instead of replying
to what I said, he only cried out, Good
God! good God! and undoing two or
three buttons at his breast, he sobbed as if
his bosom was bursting.  I was affected
with his gratitude, and tried to disperse the
tears that mounted to my eyes.  I wish I
could weep, said he, but I can't; and may
these be the last tears that ever you shall
have occasion to shed! my worthy, my
generous, my pious relation!  God forgive
me for trying such a heart, but I will reward
it, amply will I reward your goodness.
</p><p>He then drew a red letter-case out of his
bosom, and, opening it, he put a bill into
my hand for two thousand pounds on the
bank of England.  Think, my dear, how
I stared at such a vision!  Sir, you amaze
me! was all I could say.  I beg your pardon
for deceiving you, said he, but it was
with a good intent.  I suppose it is needless
to tell you that I am not that poor forlorn
wretch that I represented myself to you.
Hear the real truth of my circumstances.
You see before you (of a private man) one

<pb n="116"/>
of the richest subject of these dominions.
You have heard that my setting-out was no
other than that of a common writing-clerk
in a merchant's counting-house at Jamaica;
from whence I wrote twice to your father,
but never had any answer.  I interrupted
him to tell him, I had heard my father say,
he had got one letter from him, and had
writ to him inn return, and afterwards made
many enquiries after him without success.
Perhaps he might, said he, but I never received
it, nor heard of any enquiries made,
which piqued me so, that I resolved never
to write again.  In a little time I made my
self so useful to my master that he grew exceedingly
fond of me; and having no heir
but an only daughter, who it seems had
conceived an inclination for me, though
without my suspecting it, but which her
father had by some means discovered, he
frankly made an offer of her to me in marriage;
with an assurance of leaving me all
that he was worth at his decease, and an
immediate proffer of entering into partnership
with him.  The only return he required
on my part, was to change my name,

<pb n="117"/>
and assume his, which was Collet.  I made
no scruple of complying; for though my
regard to the young lady had never risen to
what is commonly called love, I yet thought
her in all respects an unexceptionable
match.  I married her; my patron punctually
fulfilled his promise; and at the end
of three years I found myself by his death
in possession of a considerable estate.  The
following year I lost my wife in childbed of
her first child, who died with its mother.
The changing of my name was probably the
occasion of my not being found out by
those employed to enquire after me; and I
perhaps ought now to acknowlege myself
careless in not acquainting my friends with
my good fortune.
</p><p>I had such uncommon success in trade
that my wealth increased amazingly.  In
about five years after the decease of my
first wife, I married the widow of a merchant,
with whom I got an immense fortune.
This lady I truly loved.  She was
an amiable creature.  I had one son by
her, a fine youth, and we lived happily together
for twelve years; at the end of

<pb n="118"/>
which it pleased God to take from me both
wife and child.  Poor man! his tears began
to flow here.  He proceeded.  After
this loss my own life began to grow tiresome
to me; I had more riches than I
knew what to do with, and had nobody to
leave them to; my health began to decline;
I grew weary of the place, and resolved,
partly to diver my melancholy, and partly
through affection to my native country, to
see England once more.  I settled my affairs
in the best manner, sent considerable
sums of money over before me, and brought
a large one with me.  During my voyage
the whim took me, that I would enquire
privately after your family, and present
myself to you as I have done, in order to
make trial of your dispositions, resolving,
according as I found you worthy of it, to
share my fortune amongst you, as I knew I
had no other relations in the world.
</p><p>I have been in England above a month.
The first thing I did was to go down into
Wiltshire, where I was soon informed that
your father and mother were dead, and that
your brother was married and resided for the

<pb n="119"/>
most part in London; you, I was told, had
been married and was a widow, but I could
learn no more about you.  On my return
to town I soon found where your brother
lived, and had the pleasure to hear a good
character of him; but I had determined to
make my own experiment on him, and I
did intend, had he received me ever so
kindly, to have made the same experiment
on you, before I disclosed my plot to either
of you.
</p><p>I dressed myself in these old cloaths on
purpose, and what the success of my scheme
has been you know.  Your brother, narrow-hearted, inhuman wretch, I blot forever
from my thoughts: it will be the better
for you, though I have more than
enough for you both.
</p><p>Your kindness, I tell you again, my valuable
relation, I will repay an hundred-fold.  Accept of that bill in your hand for
your present use.  I am sure you want it;
and accept of it only as an earnest of my
future friendship towards you.  That brother,
in affluence himself, who could see
his sister, <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a sister want, must have lost

<pb n="120"/>
all regard to ties of blood, and 'tis no wonder
that I, so much further removed in kindred,
met with such treatment at his hands.
</p><p>See, my Cecilia, what an amazing turn
of fortune!  What could I do but lift up my
eyes, as I did my heart, in silent adoration of
that God, who is a father to the fatherless,
and defendeth the cause of the widow!
</p><p>It was some time before I could frame
my mind to discourse on ordinary subjects.
I gratefully accepted my cousin's noble present.
He enquired minutely into my situation;
there was no need of concealing
any thing from him, nor did I attempt it.
He was very inquisitive as to my brother's
behaviour towards me.  I told him the
whole of it; he was even bitter in his invectives
against him, and Lady Sarah.  But,
said he, I will have my revenge on them;
I will make you triumph over him, and
that proud upstart his wife.  What lodgings
you are in my poor dear creature!  Is
this your best room?  I told him I had nothing
but that and a bed-chamber where the
children and I lay, and a closet for my
maid.  He desired to see the children, and

<pb n="121"/>
I had them both brought in.  He kissed
them tenderly; poor babes! you have a
cursed uncle, but you have a very good
mama, and I will take care of you all.
</p><p>I will dine with you to-morrow, said he;
let us eat a comfortable morsel together,
and for your life not a word of what has
past to any body.  He then took an affectionate
leave of me and departed.&mdash;Let
me here lay down my pen, and wonder at
my fate!
</p><p>I have got into a flow of spirits, my dear.
What scenes of happiness might now open
upon me, if happiness consisted in riches
alone? but no, no, it does not.  My heart,
broken by vexation, cannot recover its
tranquillity so soon.  Yet is there room
for joy, joy springing from a rational, from
a humane, from a commendable motive;
and I will a little indulge it.  I can now in
part return the vast obligation I owe Mr.
Faulkland, as far at least as relates to pecuniary
debts.  I can now repay many-fold
the kindness of my good lady V&mdash;.  I can
provide for my affectionate worthy Patty.
I have the delightful prospect of giving my

<pb n="122"/>
children an education suitable to their birth;
and, if my life is prolonged, of seeing them
honourably and happily settled in the world.
I shall have the glorious power of diffusing
benefits!  Oh, my dear, 'tis good for me
that I have been in trouble, it has so enlarged
my charity, that I feel transports
which prosperity is a stranger to, at the
bare idea of having it in my power to succour
the afflicted.  Who would not suffer
adversity to have the heart so improved?
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 11.&mdash;My new-found relation
dined with me to-day according to promise.
Patty had provided two dishes of the
best things in season, and dressed them admirably;
I need not tell you in what satisfaction
Mr. Warner and I enjoyed our little
chearful meal.  He had sent me in the
morning a hamper of excellent wine, and
seemed to relish his bottle with an extraordinary
good goust.
</p><p>When Patty had carried the children up
stairs, and we were left alone, he told me
that he had been that morning looking out
for a house for me; you must quit these

<pb n="123"/>
lodgings directly, and submit a little to my
management; for I <hi rend="italic">will</hi>mortify your paltry
brother and his wife.  You shall have
as handsome a house as his, and better
furnished too, or I'll know why.  You
must know I mean to set you out like a
dutchess, and you shall roll by that worthless
puppy's door in a better equipage than
his minx is carried in.  But I do not intend
to live with you as well as I love you; for
though I am an old weather-beaten fellow,
you are young and handsome, and the world
I know is full of scandal.  I shall therefore
content myself with a lodging some where
in your neighbourhood, and come and see
you now and then.  I thanked him for the
prudence of his generosity, and suffer me
to live in that moderate state, which, if I
had ever so much riches, would be my
choice.  Don't oppose me coz, said he;
pray don't.  I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have my way in this,
I have set my heart upon it.  You shall
<hi rend="italic">blaze</hi> for a while at least; when I have had
my revenge, you may live as you please
afterwards.  I was unwilling to contradict

<pb n="124"/>
him in his odd humour, yet was very much
afraid of the consequences of <hi rend="italic">blazing</hi>, as he
called it, all at once.  But dear Sir, said I,
what will the world think of my emerging
thus from obscurity into the splendour you
talk of? though you do not live with me,
as I am still young, may it not give room
for censure? busy people will pry into the
source from whence I draw my affluence,
and envy will not be backward in putting
wrong constructions on an appearance by
which it will be so much excited.
</p><p>He listened, looking me earnestly in the
face; then nodding his head, with a very
grave countenance said, You are a sensible
woman, coz, and I commend your prudence,
but I must have my will for all that.
I could not forbear smiling at his manner;
and going on, if said I, I were to enter
again into public life with a moderately
genteel appearance only, nobody's curiosity
would be excited, as it might easily be supposed
that my brother had enable me to
support a decent figure in the world.&mdash;I
soon found that I had made use of a wrong
argument, which put my friend into a violent

<pb n="125"/>
passion.  A fiddle-stick for you and
your brother too, said he; do you think I
will let that whelp have the credit of what
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> mean to do for you? no, no, set your
heart at rest about that; what I do, all the
world shall know, and my reasons for it too.
I'll have my own way; there is no hurt I
hope in providing for a near kinswoman,
that is left to starve by a still nearer relation.
I make you my heir, look you, and I'll
spread it all over the town.  Is there any
harm in that?  God knows I have no more
ill in my heart than one of your children;
but I am a little resenting may be, so say no
more of it.  I found Mr. Warner was
pretty positive, therefore thought it the
wisest way to insist no farther upon the argument;
but told him I would submit intirely
to his discretion.  It will be best for
you, said he; consider me as your father,
and I will <hi rend="italic">be</hi> a father to you.  He then told
me that he had been trying to get a house
for me near my brother's, that I might <hi rend="italic">nose</hi>
him as he called it; but that as there were
none empty in the square, he had fixed on a
very handsome one in an adjoining street.

<pb n="126"/>
I did not like the furniture, said he, so I ordered
it out, and have bespoke new of an
upholder, who promises me, in a week or
ten days at farthest, to have every thing
completely fitted up.  In the mean time I
can't bear to see you in this sorry room;
poor soul! how long have you been here?
I told him near four months, and that, with
his permission, I would continue in these
lodgings till the house was ready, as it was
not worth while to change them for so short
a time.  Well, said he, you may do as you
will for that; I'll see that every thing is to
your satisfaction.  I took his leave with
an affectionate shake by the hand.
</p><p>How miraculous is all this, my dear! this
messenger of good tidings, is he not sent to
me by providence? as I found he intended
not to make a secret of his designs in my
favour, I was in haste to divulge the joyful
news to my friends.  I have accordingly
writ to my Lady V&mdash;, giving her an account
of the wonderful revolution in my affairs;
and I intend, as soon as I can fix
upon some curious present worth her acceptance,
to make her a large return for

<pb n="127"/>
her favours.  I have also acquainted Mrs.
Faulkland of the happy turn in my fortune,
and I design a magnificent present for her
as soon as I have time to prepare it.  To
neither of these ladies have I hinted at my
brother's behaviour, either to myself, or
Mr. Warner.  I have made the good woman,
with whom I lodge, stare wonderfully
at the relation.  I could get nothing from
her but exclamations of astonishment, her
hands and eyes lifted up, 'Good God!
Lord bless us! what strange things come
about! what luck <hi rend="italic">some</hi> people are born
to! and this was your <hi rend="italic">own, own</hi> cousin that
you never set eyes on before?  My goodness,
what a swarthy gentleman he is! but
tumbling in gold, I warrant him.  It
would be long before such good fortune
would happen to me, though I have a
cousin beyond seas too.'  I could plainly
see that this poor woman envied my prosperity,
though she tried to congratulate
me; but it is the less to be wondered at, as
she knew not that I was born to any better
prospect, than that of working for my bread
in a two pair of stairs room.

<pb n="128"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 15.&mdash;I have not seen my honest
kinsman these four days; but he sent me a
note to inform me that he was busy in seeing
every thing put in order in my new
house; and that he abstained form visiting
me out of <hi rend="italic">discretion</hi>, this word he marked,
the more to impress his full meaning.  He
says I shall not see any thing till all is ready,
neither has he yet so much as told me
the street where I am to live.  I find he
<hi rend="italic">will</hi>, as he himself says, have his own way.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 22.&mdash;Now, my Cecilia, I may
reasonably hope that my afflictions are at an
end: as far as wealth can promote felicity,
that felicity is mine.
</p><p>I had just settled with my landlady, and
having paid her for her lodgings, made her
a present, a little to reconcile her to my
prosperity, when a new chariot most superbly
gilt stopped at my door; a black
and a white footman in rich laced liveries
behind it.  One of these brought me a note
from Mr. Warner, who informed me that
he had sent my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> equipage to carry me

<pb n="129"/>
home, where I should find him waiting to
welcome me to my <hi rend="italic">own</hi> house.
</p><p>Patty seemed to have got wings to her
feet; she flew up to me with the welcome
notice, and begged of me to observe from
the window, that the servants were in our
own family livery; with this difference,
that the lace was silver instead of what we
used to give.
</p><p>On expressing my surprise at this, Patty
told me  that Mr. Warner had, at his second
visit, enquired of her, as she let him out,
what liveries we used to give, but bid her
not mention it to me; which she said she
would not do, as she guessed he meant to
surprise me.  But this was not all, he had
been so minutely correct, as to have the
Arnold arms in a lozenge elegantly painted
on the doors; what these were, he was at
the pains of informing himself elsewhere.
My Patty almost frantick with joy hurried
the two children down stairs, and stuck
them up in the chariot, telling them both
it was their own as she put them into it;
but the poor babes fell a crying, and were
not to be pacified by the novelty or finery

<pb n="130"/>
of the thing till I came to them.  She staid
behind to send our little baggage after us,
and I drove to my new house in Pall-mall;
where I found my generous benefactor waiting,
as he had promised, to receive me.
</p><p>Oh my dear, he is a princely man! such
grandeur, such elegance! he led me thro'
every room,w here wealth and magnificence
were displayed even to profusion.  From
top to bottom there is not the smallest article
wanting that luxury itself can imagine.
The carpets, skreens, cabinets, and an
abundance of fine china, are beyond comparison
more beautiful than any thing of
the kind I have ever seen.  'Tis but eleven
days since my kinsman mentioned his design
to me, and you must believe he has been
indefatigable in his diligence, since he has
left nothing for me to do, but at once to
take possession of this splendid mansion.
All the necessary domesticks are hired, and
ready in their respective stations; and I am
already as much settled in a few hours, as
if I had lived here so many years.
</p><p>Mr. Warner told me that as a trifle would
not be sufficient to keep up every thing in

<pb n="131"/>
proportionable state about me, he intended
to allow me three thousand pounds a year.
This appointment, said he, you are to consider
as your own property, and just call
upon me as you would on your steward.
I am sure you will employ it well, you gave
me a proof of that in <hi rend="italic">your five shillings</hi>.  You
need not be afraid of being too profuse in
your charities; when I die you will find
yourself possessed of the means of continuing
them.
</p><p>Dear sir, said I, long may you live to
feel and rejoice in the blessings which <hi rend="italic">your</hi>
bounty will, through me, I hope, draw
down on us both.  I leave you to enjoy yourself,
said he; but I am impatient till your
brother knows what he has lost by his hard-heartedness.  He cannot long be ignorant
of it, Sir, replied I; but indeed I flatter
myself that he is not quite so much to
blame in regard to me, as we have both
imagined.  You see he seemed to know
nothing of my situation when you enquired
after me, and even threw out something
like a reproach for my having withdrawn
myself without acquainting him where I

<pb n="132"/>
was; I am very sure lady Sarah never informed
him of my having applied to her.&mdash;
It was his duty to have enquired you out,
said he; did he not know you were poor?
He knew, said I, that my circumstances
were very much streighten'd, but he did not
know <hi rend="italic">how</hi> much.  Well, well, answered
Mr. Warner, it is good in you to excuse
him, but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> know him to be a narrow-hearted poltroon.  He took his leave, and
said he would see me soon again, having
taken lodgings for himself in my neighborhood.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 23.&mdash;I begin to doubt, my Cecilia,
whether I am really awake or not!
Tis all enchantment!  I am afraid my old
kinsman is a wizard . . . . . . . . . . I have
been talking to, and examining my servants,
to see if they are real living people, or only
phantoms; I look at, and handle the rich
furniture of my apartments to try if it be
substantial!&mdash;'Tis all so&mdash;every thing real&mdash;
I beg my cousin's pardon for suspecting him
of sorcery; I believe he deals in no charms,
but that all-powerful one&mdash;money.

<pb n="133"/>
</p><p>Now, my sister, what a spacious field is
there opened before me!  Three thousand
pounds a year! how many hearts will be
in my power to make glad! and I will
make many glad.
</p><p>'O Lord God, who hast showered down
thy blessings in abundance on my head,
vouchsafe me such a portion of thy grace,
that I may become an humble instrument
of they mercy, to those whom the rod of
adversity has laid in the dust.  Teach me
so to use this thy bounteous favour, that
<hi rend="italic">Thy</hi> honour, not <hi rend="italic">my</hi> worldly desires may
be promoted; that <hi rend="italic">Thy</hi> praise, not <hi rend="italic">,y</hi>
pride may be exalted.  And if, O Lord,
thou has chosen me to be the dispenser of
thy fatherly kindness to the afflicted that
cry unto thee, quicken in my heart such
diligence, humility, and integrity, as
may render me not unworthy of the important
trust.  But if, O my God! thou
hast sent riches only to be a trial of my
strength, unsupported by thee; be merciful,
take them from me, and restore to

<pb n="134"/>
me that poverty, which first taught me to
know myself.'
</p><p>Upon my knees I have poured out this
prayer to the Almighty, and it is the fervent
wish of my soul that he would grant it.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 26.&mdash;You will smile, my dear,
as I did, in pity of the meanness of poor
Lady Sarah; but proud people are always
mean.  I have been here but four days, yet
I find she has already heard of my metamorphosis.
Indeed she could hardly do
otherwise, so near her as I am.  Mr. Warner
has been very urgent with me to drive out
in my new chariot; this I readily complied
with, as both the children and I wanted air
and exercise, and yesterday we drove to
Hyde-Park.  I did not however go at the
hour when there is most company, but I
conclude I was seen either by Lady Sarah
herself, or by some one who told her; for
this morning, prodigious! she sent her woman
to me with a message.  I had her called
up stairs, and enquired very civilly after
by brother and his lady.

<pb n="135"/>
</p><p>She told me that Lady Sarah sent her humble
service to me, and was very much surprised
that she had not heard from me in so
long a time; that she supposed I was gone
out of town, but as Sir George seemed uneasy
that I never wrote to him, her ladyship
had sent her to enquire for me at my old
lodgings in the Hay-Market, from whence
she had been directed to me here; and that
she was ordered to tell me that her lady had
talked to my brother about the affair that I
knew of, and that Sir George would act
agreeably to her request, if I would call or
write a line to him.
</p><p>I found the woman had been instructed
to feign an entire ignorance on her lady's
part of the change in my circumstances, but
I was resolved to let her see I had detected
this paltry artifice.  I could observe that the
servant, though she endeavoured to avoid
it, eyes every thing in my apartment with
surprise and curiosity; and I concluded that
Lady Sarah had sent her for no other purpose,
but to satisfy herself from her maid's
account, whether the report she had heard
concerning me was true.  Tell your lady,

<pb n="136"/>
said I, she needed not to have been at the
pains of framing such a message to have
gratified her curiosity; my house is open
to any one who has a mind to look at it,
even to Lady Sarah herself.  You shall see
it all over, and may report to her ladyship
what my cousin Warner's bounty has done
for me; and she may then judge whether
I stand in need of the assistance she now pretends
to offer me.  The woman looked
abashed, and though she seemed inclined to
ask questions, was ashamed to do so.  This
was the very servant who had so unceremoniously
led me up the back stairs when
I went to visit her lady; but I appeared in
a quite different light to her now: I rang
the bell, and ordered a footman to <hi rend="italic">shew her
the house</hi>.  She curtsied in silence, and withdrew.
</p><p>What a poor creature is Lady Sarah!
Mr. Warner called upon me before her woman
went away.  I told him the whole
passage.  Oh! how he chuckled, and rejoiced,
shrugging his shoulders, and rubbing
his hands!  He wanted to see the servant,
but I was afraid he would be too

<pb n="137"/>
strong in his insults, and turned him from
the point.
</p><p>He told me, he invited himself to dine
with me; and accordingly he favoured me
with his company, and staid during the
greatest part of the evening.  He is a man
of a strong natural sense, though he is careless
of improving it.  He has passed his
life in business, and in acquiring riches.  He
does not let me into the particulars of these,
though he is in other respects very communicative
and entertaining.  There is a
whimsical vein runs through his conversation.
He now, for the first time, desired
me to give him the particulars of my life
from my childhood, which he had but a
partial account of, at different time, from
myself.  I took up my story at the earliest
period of my life, wherein any thing interesting
had occurred, and traced every circumstance
minutely to the hour he first saw
me.
</p><p>I could easily see that he had a tender
sympathizing heart, for he was moved to
tears more than once during my relation;
nor was he ashamed of them, for he suffered

<pb n="138"/>
them to run down his cheek, whilst he listened
with mute attention to my story.  He
praised Mr. Faulkland highly, said he was
a man after his own heart, and deserved the
best woman in the world.  I wish you had
married him, said he, such a princely fellow
deserves a princely fortune.  He owned
my brother had some reason to be nettled at
my refusal of such a man.  Our sex, said
he, have not such <hi rend="italic">chimaera</hi> notions as you
women have; but still that does not excuse
his sordidness.
</p><p>I took this opportunity of telling Mr.
Warner that my brother did not really
know the very great distress I was in, and
that I had reason to believe, from the general
tenor of Lady Sarah's character, that she
had either concealed it from him, or made
misrepresentations of my case; doubtless she
had not informed him to what streights I
was reduced immediately upon my mother's
death; and who knows but Sir George,
having left me for a while to feel the effects
of that resentment, with which he had
threatened me in his last letter, still meant
to shew himself a brother; for if he were

<pb n="139"/>
ignorant, as I am willing to believe, of that
particular which I have mentioned, he could
not suppose that I was driven to absolute
want; and from Lady Sarah's insinuations,
perhaps he thought that my mother left a
sum of money behind her.  He knew not
of the illness that my children and I were
visited with; and indeed it appears to me,
from what he hinted to yourself, that he
was quite unacquainted with my situation.
</p><p>To say the truth, my Cecilia, as you
know I am of a placable disposition, I should
be glad to be on good terms with my brother,
the only relation (my kinsman excepted)
that I have in the world.  I was willing
therefore, if possible, a little to reconcile
Mr. Warner to him; as I durst not, without
his permission, seek a reconciliation with
Sir George.
</p><p>There <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be something in what you
say, coz, answered my friend; perhaps he
had a mind to let you bite on the bridle for
a while, and I am willing to suppose with
you, that hereafter, may be, he would have
given you some dirty trifle; for a generous
thing I am sure he is not capable of, from

<pb n="140"/>
his sordidness to me.  I found this stuck
most with the good man.  Oh, Sir, said I,
but consider Lady Sarah's influence stepped
in <hi rend="italic">there</hi> too.  My brother, you acknowledge,
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> going to give you something,
till she interposed.&mdash;Half a crown, I
suppose, said he: To say the truth, I believe
she is the worst of the two.  She has
a great deal of pride, Sir, answered I; she
has communicated some of it to my brother;
probably he was mortified and disconcerted
at the sight of so near a relation,
in his wife's presence, whose exteriour appearance
could do him no credit; perhaps,
had you applied privately to him, he would
have behaved better.  You have not much
worldly wisdom, replied my cousin, to excuse
him thus; however, I think the better
of you for it, whatever I may do of
him.  But speak honestly now, don't you
want to be friends with Sir George, that he
and his wife may have an opportunity of
seeing you in all your finery?  As I knew
Mr. Warner's temper, I was resolved to
humour him in it, and thought I could not
give my desire of seeing my brother a better

<pb n="141"/>
turn than this, to one of my kinsman's
disposition.  To deal openly with you, Sir,
said I, I think our triumph over Lady Sarah
will not be complete, unless she herself
is a witness of that high fortune, of which
she might have been a partaker, had it not
been for her own meanness of spirit.  And
to be sincere with you, my Cecilia, I did
think Lady Sarah deserved this mortification,
though it did not so far influence me
as to make me desirous of being on terms
with her: as for my brother, I was governed
by no other motive than affection towards
him.
</p><p>Well, said Mr. Warner, suppose you
were to invite them both to dine with you,
and to have me at table, handsomely dressed
out (for I can dress fine when I please) and
let them see that the man, who was not
thought worthy to sit down in their presence,
they had better have used with more
ceremony.  Oh, Sir, said I, that would be
too severe an insult; besides, I doubt whether
my brother would come; you know
he is angry with me, and thinks he has reason.
If you will permit me first to call on

<pb n="142"/>
my brother, when we are reconciled, I can
afterwards ask both him and his lady to my
house; and though I am sure you have too
much good nature and politeness to shock
them all at once, by violating the laws of
hospitality in this house, which your bounty
has made mine, yet will you have sufficient
room for retaliation, by treating them,
in your turn, with neglect.
</p><p>Thou art a milky thing, answered Mr.
Warner; but as I am willing to please you,
you may do as you like; but by&mdash;, and
he swore a tremendous oath, they shall
never have a cross from me.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 27.&mdash;Having obtained Mr. Warner's
consent, I went this day to my brother.
He was not at home, but I was introduced
to Lady Sarah, for whom I enquired.
Poor woman! how she looked!
My resentment was disarmed; even my
contempt subsided; and I felt nothing but
pity.  Her confusion was so great, she knew
not how to receive me: she curtsied, without
knowing what to say, or how to behave.
I would not embarrass her too far, but taking

<pb n="143"/>
a chair by her, As you favoured me
with a message yesterday, Lady Sarah, said
I, in as obliging a tone as I could speak, I
thought it a sisterly duty to wait on you and
Sir George: I hope my brother is well, I
long to see him, and flatter myself he will
forget all former coldness, and again be my
brother.
</p><p>I spoke this long sentence on purpose
to give her time to recover her herself.  She
rubbed her hand over her forehead, I believe
to hide the glow that was in her face
from my first entrance; 'Lord, Mrs.
Arnold&mdash;I am so surprized&mdash;this visit
was so unexpected&mdash;I thought you were
in the country'&mdash;(her woman you know
had been with me the day before, I passed
this by however) I have not been out of
town at all, Madam, I was detained by illness
&mdash;'I am mighty sorry for it&mdash;I hope
you are quite recovered&mdash;pray, why did
not you let me know you were ill?'  As I
had heard nothing from you, Madam, after
my first message, I was afraid that the mediation,
you were so kind as to promise
me, had failed, and that my brother's resentment

<pb n="144"/>
was so great, he would not hear of
me.
</p><p>'Oh dear, that is true indeed&mdash;it was a
sad affair&mdash;I mentioned you to your brother
when he came to town; but he was
in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a passion, I durst not name you to
him again.'  (She durst not name me,
observe that, my dear; poor George, whom
she governs with despotic sway).  Then probably,
Madam, my brother knew not <hi rend="italic">all</hi>
my distress?  I protest I don't know&mdash;said
she&mdash;you know your brother is very warm,
and whenever I attempted to speak of you,
he always stopped me short&mdash;so&mdash;I
don't know how it was; but I never could
get to tell him your situation&mdash;I should
think I had great reason to resent my brother's
cruelty, Madam, said I, if he had
known those particulars of which my maid
informed <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, but since he did not, I will
not reproach him; neither will I accuse
your ladyship of unkindness in concealing
them from him.  My sufferings are, thank
God! at an end, and I am now come to
offer you, and Sir George, my sisterly love;
I hope he will not refuse me his love in return,

<pb n="145"/>
I have nothing else now to ask for.
She blushed again, and seemed in great
confusion; 'You are very good, Mrs.
Arnold, we must forget and forgive.'&mdash;
Shall I not be permitted to see my brother,
Madam?  By the message I received from
you, I was in hopes you had prevailed on
him&mdash;The <hi rend="italic">poor</hi> woman was now struck
dumb.  She felt for her snuff-box, and
<hi rend="italic">would</hi> not find it in her pocket; but got up
to look for it to gain a little time; rumaged
her toilet, and, at last, took it out of
her pocket; offered me a pinch of snuff,
then sat down again.  Why, that message,
to tell you the truth, said she (forcing a
conscious silly smile) your brother knew
nothing of; but not having heard from
you in so long a time, I was resolved to
enquire after you; and was determined
myself, out of my own pin-money, to
allow you what I could spare, till I could
get Sir George in better temper; but I
made use of his name because I thought
you would more readily accept of any
thing from him than from me.  Your brother
thought you were actually in the country,

<pb n="146"/>
try, till we were surprized with the account
of the <hi rend="italic">wonderful</hi> fortune that has come to
you lately.  'Then you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> heard of it,
Madam, interrupted I, before you sent to
me?' an untoward question, my dear;
it plunged her again in the mud, and she
flounced and floundered to get out, which
only sunk her the deeper.  We had heard
a strange flying report, said she, of which I
did not believe a word, and therefore sent
Holmes (that is her woman's name) to you
to offer you my service.
</p><p>I was not ill-natured enough, my Cecilia,
to persist in embarrassing this mean
woman any farther, though the insincerity
of her whole behaviour, and the low falsities
she had recourse to, very well deserved
reproof.  I was glad to find my
brother was not so culpable as he had at
first appeared; for I could easily discover
from the whole tenor of her discourse, she
was so far from giving him any intimation
of my distress, that she had prevented him
from enquiring after me, by telling him
that I was gone out of town; probably too
with some aggravating circumstances, either

<pb n="147"/>
of a pretended neglect on my side towards
them both, or, perhaps, some other falshood
still more injurious.  It was very apparent
that she had sent her maid only as a spy,
and, by way of passport, with a sham offer
of kindness, of which she knew I stood not
in need: and she depended on my pride
and resentment so justly provoked, for my
never coming to any explanation either
with her or my brother.  No wonder then
she was confounded at the sight of me,
and the more so as she apprehended I might
reproach my brother, who could so well
excuse himself by pleading ignorance of my
situation: and her conduct must then appear
so despicable to her husband, that
hardy as she is, she would be at a loss to
justify it.
</p><p>All this being very obvious to me, I
determined to make her easy at once.  I
shall think no more of what is past, Lady
Sarah, said I, I only wish to be on terms
of friendship with my brother and you;
and since he knows not of the message you
sent to me, I will not mention it to him,
nor any thing else that can recal past unkindness.

<pb n="148"/>
I hope this visit will be taken as
it is meant, out of pure affection, and that
you, Madam, will be so kind as to make
my peace with my brother; whom I am
very sorry I was under a necessity of disobliging;
but as I never did offend him,
and I am sure never should but in that one
instance, wherein <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was so much more nearly
interested than himself, I hope he will
think no more of it; but restore me to a
share of his love, which is all that is now
wanting to my happiness.
</p><p>This declaration (as I intended it should)
entirely restored Lady Sarah's tranquillity.
Her countenance brightened up; I'll take
upon me to answer for Sir George, said she,
that he <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> restore you to his affection; I
shall insist upon a general act of oblivion
being past on his side, and I beg, sister, on
your part, that you may not, by reproaching
your brother, revive the memory of
your past coldness.
</p><p>The weakest people are often very cunning;
this caution of Lady Sarah's, artfully
enough introduced, conveyed an obvious
meaning to me, very different from her pretended

<pb n="149"/>
reason; she was afraid of an eclaircissement.
I promised her I should meet
my brother, whenever he would permit me,
as if nothing had ever happened to disturb
our friendship.
</p><p>See, my dear, how this woman, who
<hi rend="italic">durst</hi> not name me when I was poor, took
upon her now to <hi rend="italic">make</hi> her husband, whose
anger had so much intimidated her, subscribe
intirely to her opinion: but I was
now become an object of attention; a finer
house, and a finer equipage than her ladyship's,
gave me an indisputable title to that
regard, to which, as a <hi rend="italic">sister</hi>, and in distress,
I had not the least claim.
</p><p>She now ventured to ask me some particulars
relating to the very extraordinary
change in my fortune.  I satisfied her minutely,
not without mentioning the cause of
Mr. Warner's having made me the <hi rend="italic">sole</hi> object
of his bounty.  Poor Lady Sarah could
not conceal her vexation at the thoughts of
what she had lost by her ill-timed pride and
parcimony.  A strange whimsical old mortal,
she called him, to come upon them so
abruptly, and in such a scandalous garb,

<pb n="150"/>
that Sir George was quite ashamed of him.
I am glad, however, Mrs. Arnold, that he
has made <hi rend="italic">you</hi> the better for him; I hope he
will continue his fondness; but such odd
humourists are not to be depended on.
Don't tell him, however, what I say; I
should be glad to show him any civility in
my power, for his kindness to you.
</p><p>I took my leave of her ladyship, with a
cordial invitation to come and see me;
which she said she would not fail to do.
</p><p>Mr. Warner called on me for a few minutes
in the evening to know the result of
my visit, as I had told him I intended to
make it.  I related every thing that had
passed between Lady Sarah and me; he enjoyed
her confusion as I described it, with a
triumphant satisfaction, which nothing but
a very strong resentment could have excited
in so good-natured a man, as he really seems
to be.
</p><p>He has added to my store of china today
(of which I have already an abundance)
a pair of most magnificent jars, above four
feet high, which he values at a hundred
and fifty pounds; these, with an entire

<pb n="151"/>
service of the finest Nankeen china, and a
most beautiful Persian carpet, I have set
apart as a present for Lady V&mdash;, and
shall send them to her the first opportunity.
</p><p>Mr. Warner very much approves of my
design, as he knows the obligations I have
to her.
</p><p>I have also got him to bespeak a set of
jewels to the amount of fifteen hundred
pounds, with which I intend to present
Mrs. Faulkland.  This sum will not exceed
my debt to Mr. Faulkland, if his agreement
with Pivet stands in force for the
term prescribed.
</p><p>Mr. Warner, who mightily loves to be
employed, has undertaken to get these
jewels made up for me in the most elegant
taste.
</p><p>This man's generosity is as inexhaustible
as his riches; I fancy he is still some way
concerned in trade, though he does not tell
me so.  These jars he said he had just received
by the arrival of an East India ship,
and I understand that his former dealings
were extremely extensive:  all over the

<pb n="152"/>
world, he said, where there was commerce,
he put in for his share.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 29.&mdash;Lady Sarah has returned
my visit; she was not slow you see in her
ceremony. <hi rend="italic">So</hi> obliging, <hi rend="italic">so</hi> polite; every
thing praised, and admired; and <hi rend="italic">sister</hi> at
every second word, and the children caressed,
<hi rend="italic">Arnold's</hi> children.  What a fine thing
it is, my dear, to be independent!  I shewed
her all my house; but not with ostentation.
I thought it would have looked affected
not to have recommended so much
wealth and elegance to her notice.  My sideboard
she says is absolutely the handsomest
she ever saw; indeed both for workmanship
and richness it does surpass any I have
seen.
</p><p>She told me she had talked to my brother
and that though he still resented my
obstinacy, as <hi rend="italic">he</hi> called it, yet as I had made
such advances towards a reconciliation, he
was very ready to meet me, and desired
every thing might be forgotten on my side,
as it should be on his.  He would have
come to see you, added Lady Sarah, but as

<pb n="153"/>
he does not chuse to meet Mr. Warner, he
would rather that the first interview between
you were at his own house.  I told
her ladyship I would breakfast with her the
next morning, and we parted upon wonderful
courteous term.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">February</hi> 30.&mdash;Just returned from my
brother's.  Sir George received me with
open arms, and I returned the embrace with
the utmost cordiality of affection.  Surely,
my dear, there is something wonderfully
powerful in the natural affections; Sir
George, spite of his resentment, his turbulence,
and the threats denounced against me,
could not at sight of me, after an absence of
so many months, resist the first impulse of
his heart, in giving me strong tokens of brotherly
love; though probably, had he not
seen me, the latent tenderness might have
lain for ever dormant in his heart.
</p><p>I entered immediately on the topic of my
extraordinary acquisition, as I was determined
not to lead to a subject which might
bring on the explanations so much dreaded
by Lady Sarah; and I could observe that

<pb n="154"/>
my brother avoided any thing tending that
way as much as I did.
</p><p>He congratulated me heartily on my
good fortune, but said, between jest and
earnest, that if he could have divined his
cousin Warner had come to him to make
experiments, he should have taken care to
have treated him better.  But I don't know
how it was, said he, he came in an evil
hour; and I was in an ill humour.
</p><p>Lady Sarah kept up the conversation
with a great deal of vivacity; always taking
care to keep us clear of the rock she was
afraid of, till a lady, with whom she was engaged
to go to an auction, called to take
her up.  Sir George would fain have detained
me, but she insisted on my going with
her, to have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> judgment she said on the
things she intended to buy.  It appeared to
me that she did not chuse to leave my brother
and me together, for fear mutual confidence
(in the fulness of our hearts) might
have brought her disingenuous proceedings
to light: but cunning people often over-act
their parts; she was so extremely pressing,
that my brother could not but take notice

<pb n="155"/>
of it.  I acquiesced to avoid giving her uneasiness;
having first engaged my brother
to dine with me on Friday.  Lady Sarah
and he both consented, but premised that
Mr. Warner was not to be of the party;
this I ventured to promise, as I was resolved
if Mr. Warner invited himself, which is
his usual way, to put him off by fairly
telling him the truth, and trusting to his
good-nature for the consequence.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 2.&mdash;After the trivial incidents of
these two last days, my Cecilia, now hasten
to more interesting particulars.  But first
a word or two of my cousin Warner.  I
had not seen him since the day that my brother
and I met, till this morning; when he
called to ask me how I did, and to know
how the puppy George, as he calls him,
had behaved to me.  After having satisfied
him in this enquiry, in a way the most favourable
I could for my brother, I told him
that as I had really found both him, and his
lady extremely penitent and mortified, I
had asked them to dine with me that day.
I am glad of it, said he (very quick) I'll be

<pb n="156"/>
here to snoutch them.  Dear Sir, said I, for
heaven's sake have a little compassion: you
cannot conceive how humbled they are;
they dare not look you in the face, and it
was one of their conditions with me, before
they would consent to come, that they
should not see you.  Ho, ho, said he, exultingly,
have they changed their Note?
Well, I will not distress  you so far in your
own house, as to mortify them with my
company at dinner, but if I should take it
in my head to drop in, in the afternoon,
you must not take it amiss.  I only want to
see them look a little like fools.
</p><p>I could not venture to oppose him in this,
but resolved to make it as easy as possible
by preparing my brother and sister for his
visit.
</p><p>I told him that would do extremely well,
and he went away rejoicing at the thoughts
of his intended triumph.
</p><p>Mr. Warner had but just left me when I
was surprized with a message that Sir George
was below.  I went down to him directly,
and seeing him in his morning-dress, imagined
that something had happened which

<pb n="157"/>
prevented their dining with me and that he
called to excuse himself; but he undeceived
me presently.  As I had not an opportunity,
said he, of asking you any questions the
other day, and shall be prevented probably
in the same manner this day, I am come to
have an hour's chat with you before dinner.
And first pray inform me, Sidney, where
you have lived ever since my mother's
death, and how it comes to pass that in all
this time you never took any notice of either
Lady Sarah or me?  As to your first question,
brother, it is easily answered, I have never
been out of London: for the rest, let us
avoid all retrospection, which can now answer
no end to either of us.
</p><p>You surprize me, said he, I understood
you had been in the country; Lady Sarah
was told that you were gone to Lady V&mdash;.
</p><p>She was misinformed, I replied&mdash;
</p><p>What was the meaning then, said he, that
you never called, or sent to her?  <hi rend="italic">She</hi> had no
resentment to you, though <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had.
</p><p>Dear Sir George, ask me no more questions.
I thought it had been premised that
we were not to talk of the past.

<pb n="158"/>
</p><p>I see, Sidney, answered he, there is something
you have no mind to explain; you
know I love and respect my wife, and that
I cannot easily be brought to take any thing
ill of her; but she was so extremely earnest
with me not to ask you any questions, that
it made me suspect there was something she
had in mind to conceal from me.  What
confirms me in this opinion is, that as I
know you are ingenuous and open to conviction,
you would have made me some apology
for a neglect both of me and Lady Sarah,
which, you could not but suppose, offended
me, if you had not looked upon
yourself as by much the most injured
Person.
</p><p>You urge me very home, brother; I
thought I was injured when you disclaimed
all relationship to me, if I did not comply
in a certain particular, which I was not at
liberty to do.
</p><p>I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> very angry with you, said he, but
should not have carried my resentment any
lengths after my mother's death, if you had
made any concession, or desired to throw
yourself under my protection, instead of a

<pb n="159"/>
stranger's, for Lady V&mdash; comparatively is
one.  I could not suppose you were in immediate
want of my assistance, as I understand
my mother's private purse was not inconsiderable,
and to tell you the truth, I
was resolved till you did condescend to inform
me of your situation, not to give myself
any pain about you.
</p><p>I can only tell you in two words, Sir
George, that you have been extremely misled
in regard to me; I wish not to revive so
disagreeable a subject, pray say no more of
it.
</p><p>But one word more, said he, just for my
own satisfaction, and then I have done:
was Lady Sarah made acquainted with your
circumstances?  You must have lived in miserable
obscurity to be so long in London
without my knowlege.
</p><p>You love and respect your wife, brother;
you must not take any thing ill of her.
</p><p>I am answered, he replied: He walked
about the room, and I could see he was
ashamed and affected.
</p><p>You will make me very unhappy, Sir
George, said I, if you resent any thing on

<pb n="160"/>
my account to your lady; she did not think
perhaps that things were quite so bad with
me as they really were; but if she heard
(which by the way I knew was an invention
of her own) that my mother left any thing
behind her, she was deceived, there really
was nothing.  But let us call another subject.
&mdash;When did you hear from Mr. Faulkland?
It is some time since I have had a
letter from his lady.
</p><p>His lady he repeated, and stamping with
his foot, cursed be the hour which gave her
that title!
</p><p>Dear Sir George, you shock me! how
can you be so uncharitable, so unchristian?
</p><p>If you know her as well as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> do, said he,
&mdash;and shook his head.
</p><p>You are so strong in your indignation
against her, I replied, that you almost make
me suspect that you <hi rend="italic">do</hi> know more of her
than I do; her weakness in regard to Mr.
Faulkland excepted; I could never entertain
an ill thought of her; but you have
raised a curiosity, which, though I tremble
to have it gratified, yet I must beg you to
speak out.

<pb n="161"/>
</p><p>Do not think me malicious, Sidney, said
he, a woman's reputation is too sacred a
thing to be trifled with; if her weakness as
you call it, had been confined to Mr. Faulkland,
<hi rend="italic">hers</hi> should be so with me: but I cannot
think with temper on the sacrifice that
noble fellow has been forced to make to
caprice.
</p><p>Dear brother, explain yourself, you terrify
me.
</p><p>My heat on this occasion, he answered,
would be unjustifiable, if I had not <hi rend="italic">proof</hi>
for what I say; Miss Burchell, for I will
not call her by my friend's name, is that
monster, a female libertine, a rake in the
worst sense of the word.
</p><p>Monstrous! cried I, your prejudice
makes you believe every cruel tale you
may have heard.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Heard</hi>, he interrupted with an indignant
smile, the d&mdash;l's in it if I have not more
than hear-say for my knowlege.
</p><p>Lord, brother, you make me shudder,
what do you mean?
</p><p>He replied, you will not believe me perhaps
when I tell you that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am as much

<pb n="162"/>
obliged to Miss Burchell's favour, as Mr.
Faulkland was.
</p><p>If Sir George had plunged a dagger in
my heart, I could not have felt a sharper
pang.  He saw me struck with amazement
and grief.
</p><p>I knew it would shock you, said he, but
you extorted the secret from me; for a secret
it has, and ever should have remained,
but in my own justification you compelled
me to disclose it.
</p><p>You know, said he, that from the first I
never considered Faulkland's engagement
to her, as a serious one, nor in any shape
binding: this judgment I formed without
knowing any thing of the woman, but from
Faulkland's own representation of the fact;
tho' to say the truth, he always spoke of her
with more tenderness than she deserved,
and imputing her frailty to her love of him,
was, as most men are apt to do on such occasions,
disposed to judge favourably of her.
The first time I saw her was at Sidney-castle;
that time when my mother invited her, and
when, you may remember, I went down
there in compliment to my mother.  I

<pb n="163"/>
own I thought her extremely agreeable,
which was alone sufficient, to make me a
little more than barely polite; but my mother's
extraordinary attachment to her, engaged
me to go still farther, and to oblige
her, I was more than ordinarily attentive
to please Miss Burchell.  When I assure
you upon my honour that I had no farther
views, I believe you will not doubt my veracity;
but whether Miss Burchell mistook
my civilities for fondness, or whether, as
I rather believe, her natural disposition was
so loose that every man she saw lighted up a
flame in her heart, I know not; but certain
it was, she made me such advances, that I
must have been extremely stupid not to have
understood her, and absolutely frozen to
have repelled her.
</p><p>My good mother's unsuspecting temper
permitted us too many opportunities, and
the light ones of your sex do not easily forgive
the neglect of those.
</p><p>In short, Miss Burchell yielded to the impetuosity
of her wishes, and I followed her
lead, more through vacancy, and a want of
better employment, than out of inclination.

<pb n="164"/>
I was very glad when she was recalled
home, for I was heartily wearied of her.,
The day before she left Sidney castle, when
we were alone, she said to me, I have too
great a reliance on your honour, to suppose
you capable of injuring my reputation by
ever divulging what has passed between us;
I am easy therefore on that head.  But
there is one circumstance on which you must
give me the most solemn promise that is in
your power to make, without which I shall
be the most unhappy creature in the world.
I know there is a friendship between you
and Mr. Faulkland, and I am not ignorant
that you men, in your unreserved moments
of confidence, do not scruple to disclose such
secrets as I have trusted you with; I do not
fear your imprudence with regard to any
one else; but it is of the utmost importance
to me that <hi rend="italic">He</hi> in particular should never
know what my tenderness for you has led
me into.  You know I have a son by him;
he has hitherto provided liberally for the
child's maintenance; and to let you into a
secret, which nobody besides must know,
I myself am indebted to him for the principal

<pb n="165"/>
part of my support; though he, as well
as the rest of the world, believe that I have
a fortune.  Now though I do not entertain
the least hope, nor indeed wish, ever to be
Mr. Faulkland's wife, yet would it be of
terrible consequence to me to forfeit his regard,
which you may naturally suppose
would be the case if he were to come to
the knowledge of what has happened.  He
has given me to understand by his house-keeper that when he comes to England he
will provide for me; the woman hinted
something like a design of his making a
handsome establishment for any worthy man
of whom I shall make choice; insinuating
at the same time that this depended on my
conduct.  I have no thoughts of marrying,
but as mine and my child's future welfare
must be chiefly owing to Mr. Faulkland,
you see the necessity there is for my preserving
his good opinion.  For this reason then,
my dear Sir George, you must swear to me
that you will never betray me to him.
</p><p>The reasons were so plausible, and the
request so natural, that I made no scruple of
giving her a solemn oath to preserve the

<pb n="166"/>
secret inviolable from Faulkland's knowledge;
for so she herself worded the promise
she urged me to make: in regard to any
one else, she said she was satisfied all assurances
were needless.
</p><p>You see, continued my brother, that by
this declaration she laid me under a double
tye of secrecy.  As I had no conception
that Faulkland could ever be brought to
think of marrying her, I thought myself
bound not to injure her in his opinion: and
therefore religiously kept my promise.
Faulkland was not then in England, but
when he returned, and came to visit me at
Sidney-castle, just at the time you parted
from your husband, he spoke of Miss Burchell
in a manner, which though it convinced
me he had a regard for her, and wished
to see her happy, yet was it far from alarming
me on his own account; I therefore
should have thought it the highest baseness
and cruelty to have hurt her in his esteem.
</p><p>I never have had the least intercourse
either by letter, or otherwise, with Miss
Burchell, since we parted.  I make no doubt
but she has dispensed her favours wherever

<pb n="167"/>
her inclination has led her, and you see she
has had the good fortune to keep all her
amours secret.  But what hope can there
be that such a profligate will keep her faith
to <hi rend="italic">one</hi> man, though that man is the most
amiable in the world.
</p><p>Oh brother, what a scene of iniquity
have you disclosed!  I would to Heaven you
had kept the horrid secret to yourself, or
divulged it time enough to have prevented
the misery into which I, unhappy that I
am! have precipitated your friend.  But I
ought not to blame you, you acted agreeably
to the dictates of honour.  Detestable
woman! I cried in the bitterness of my
heart, I do not wonder at her cautioning
me against letting you into my design of
urging Mr. Faulkland to marry her; I then
little knew the reason you had for the opposition
she said you would give to this fatal
match: every thing fell out to her wish,
and coincided to promote her successful
guilt.&mdash;Your absence from London, mine,
and my mother's urgency, and the too generous
yielding of our dear unhappy Faulkland.
I burst into tears&mdash;my heart was torn

<pb n="168"/>
with anguish, and in that instant my tenderness
for him revived.  Sir George strove
not to comfort me.  He was too much affected
himself.
</p><p>I have but one hope, said I, and that is
in the extraordinary love she has for Mr.
Faulkland, and his uncommon merit, which
may probably ensure to him the continuance
of it.
</p><p>You know not what you say, answered
my brother; the merit of an angel could
not secure the fidelity of such a heart as
her's.  Her love is gross; a new object
will always have charms for her.  Had I
been as credulous as Faulkland, I should
have thought myself the idol of her soul,
so lavish was she in her expressions of tenderness.
</p><p>Is it not strange thought, I asked, that
with so loose a mind, she should have so
long preserved an attachment to Mr. Faulkland?
for most certainly her affection to
<hi rend="italic">him</hi> has at least been sincere.
</p><p>Her affection to his estate, answered my
brother, has, I believe, all along been sincere:
Do you not know she is a beggar?

<pb n="169"/>
</p><p>I told him, in this she had imposed on
him, to answer her own ends, in engaging
him the more firmly to keep her secret;
for to my knowlege, she had seven thousand
pounds, as I was informed by Lady
V&mdash;, who knew her circumstances.
</p><p>Sir George vented two or three curses on
her head.  I am not surprized at any instance
of her falshood, said he; she is made
up of deceit.  Such characters as her's are
not uncommon; but none of them ever fell
in your way before, and I hope never will
again.  If you will look back on her whole
conduct, however it may surprize you, you
will find there is nothing inconsistent in it.
She is only a sly rake in petticoats, of which
there are numbers, that you good women
would stare at, if you knew their behaviour.
She considers men just as the libertines of
our sex to women.  She likes for the present;
she seduces; her inclinations cool towards
an old lover, and are warmed again
by a new face.  She retained not Faulkland
long enough to grow tired of him, and
therefore possibly still preserved some tenderness
for him; indeed his uncommon attractions

<pb n="170"/>
must have made an impression
even on <hi rend="italic">her</hi> heart; but this did not hinder
her from indulging her inclinations elsewhere.
You must throw into the account
too, that she had by accident got a sort of
hold on him, of which, by my mother's indulgence,
and some other concurring circumstances,
she hoped one day or other to
avail herself.  With so pretty a person as
she has, and the fortune you tell me she is
mistress of, do you think she could have
failed of marrying creditably, if that had
been her view?  No, no, she meant not to
confine herself.  Her passion for Faulkland,
whether real or pretended, gave a colour
to her preserving that liberty, in the licentious
use of which she placed her happiness:
nor would she in the end have confined
herself within the bounds of marriage, if
an immense fortune had not sweetened the
restraint.
</p><p>I pray heaven it may, answered I; 'tis all
we have now to trust to.  You have given
me an idea of a character, which I thought
was not in the female world.

<pb n="171"/>
</p><p>I own, replied Sir George, I live in perpetual
fears of her relapsing into vice.  A
woman without principal, Sidney, is not to
be relied on.  Love (if in such a breast it
can merit that name) even towards the most
deserving object, is never permanent.  Fear,
and even shame, are subdued by repeated
crimes; what hold then remains?  Interest
alone (where that happens to interfere;)
but if detection can be avoided, even that
can have no farther influence.
</p><p>Sir George took his leave of me, in order
to go home to dress; but I was not to
say a word of his morning visit, so that I
found I needed not to be under any apprehensions
of reproaching Lady Sarah with
her behaviour towards me; for he meant
not to let her know he was informed of it.
So much the better; I should be extremely
sorry to be the occasion of any difference
between them.
</p><p>They came at the appointed hour; I entertained
them magnificently; and we were
all harmony and good humour.  When
dinner was over, I told them, they must not
be surprized, if we should have a visit from

<pb n="172"/>
our West Indian relation, in the evening,
for that it was very probable he would call,
and if I should be denied, he would never
forgive me, as he possibly might find it
out.  Lady Sarah looked frightened, and
said she would not stay; but Sir George
declared he would arm himself with a few
bumpers, and stand his ground.
</p><p>I affected to treat the interview with pleasantry
and reconciled them both to it; for
I was really apprehensive that Mr. Warner
would take it very ill, and think I betrayed
him, if I let them escape.  I supposed too,
that after he had indulged himself in a
short triumph all would be over, and they
might afterwards meet on better terms.
</p><p>In less than half an hour, we heard a loud
rap; Lady Sarah turned pale; Sir George
laughed at her, but was himself a little disconcerted.
The parlour door flew open&mdash;
a footman entered&mdash;Mr. Warner&mdash;and in
stalked my kinsman, with a very stately
tread.  He was dressed out, I assure you.  A
large well powdered wig, tied with a rose;
a suit of the finest cinnamon-coloured cloth,
and over it a surtout of the richest mohair

<pb n="173"/>
and silk, with gold frogs; and a fine clouded
cane, with a gold head; silk stockings
of the same colour with his coat; a fine
lace-cravat, his hat under his arm.  He
really looked very gentleman-like, and venerable;
for he appears older than he is.
</p><p>He glanced his eyes, with a supercilious
scorn, over my brother and sister, who stood
up at his entrance, and making up directly
to me, saluted me, and took his place by
me.  A short silence ensued, which was
broken by my asking Mr. Warner to drink
a glass of wine.  I could almost have smiled
at the embarrassment of my brother and
Lady Sarah; the old gentleman enjoyed
it, and looked at them both, but as if he
knew neither.  My brother had recourse
to the bottle, he drank my health, and civilly
enough bowed to Mr. Warner, just
pronouncing the word Sir!&mdash;the other
scarce returned it by a slight inclination of
his head.
</p><p>At last, addressing himself to me, cousin,
if you have no aversion to tobacco, I should
be glad you would indulge me with a pipe;

<pb n="174"/>
tis my custom after dinner, but I have not
smoaked yet.
</p><p>As I had never observed him to do this
when he had dined with me before, I took
it for granted the compliment was meant
for Lady Sarah.
</p><p>I said <hi rend="italic">I</hi> had no objection, and referred
myself by a bow to Lady Sarah.
</p><p>She made no reply, and my kinsman,
without seeming to mind any one else, rang
the bell, saying, if <hi rend="italic">you</hi> don't dislike it, there
is no more to be said.  The black, whom
he had given me, presenting himself at the
door, Mr. Warner desired him to stop to his
lodgings for his pipe and some tobacco.
The man quickly returned with a long
japaned reed, with a boll fixed at the end of
it.  Mr. Warner called for a lighted taper,
and throwing himself back in his chair with
one leg crossed over the other, lighted his
pipe with much composure, puffing large
clouds of smoak a-cross Lady Sarah's nose,
who sat at his right-hand.  My sister, who
had really an unaffected aversion to tobacco,
could not bear this; she coughed excessively,
and, with tears in her eyes, rose off

<pb n="175"/>
her chair, and retired to the other end of
the room.  My old gentleman laughed till
he wheezed, nodding his head after her,
and looking at me, as much as to say, I am
glad I have sent her off.
</p><p>Sir George, though determined not to be
put out of humour, thought this was going
too far; I was really uneasy myself, and
hardly knew how to act; for if I shewed
any mark of distinction to Lady Sarah, I
knew it would be construed by Mr. Warner
as an affront to him.  I ventured, however,
to tell her that if she would sept into the
drawing-room, I should order coffee, and
wait on her immediately.
</p><p>Ay, said my brother, approaching his
lady, and taking her by the hand, let us get
out of the horrid atmosphere that this honest
gentleman has raised about us.  The honest
gentleman vouchsafed not to look at him,
and my brother and sister withdrew into the
adjoining room.
</p><p>As soon as they were gone, Mr. Warner
threw down his pipe, and stroking the table
with his clenched fist, burst into a loud
laugh.  Lord, Lord! said he, pride <hi rend="italic">will</hi>

<pb n="176"/>
have a fall.  I think I have brought them
down a little; how like asses they both
looked!  Well, now I am satisfied&mdash;I have
had my revenge, you may go and drink
your coffee with them, I'll bid you good-by.
</p><p>He immediately withdrew, and I joined
my brother and sister, who were heartily
rejoiced that they had got rid of him.
</p><p>Sir George said, he saw his design, but
was resolved not to give an opportunity for
insults, and so held his tongue.  As he is
your friend, Sidney, said he, I would not
distress you by engaging you as a party on
either side, which must have been the case;
for that old fellow would not have suffered
you to remain neutral.
</p><p>I told him our kinsman was whimsical,
but that as he was now thoroughly satisfied
at having paid them in kind, I was sure he
would never again seek to give them any
offence, and they ought to forgive him by
the law of retaliation.
</p><p>They laughed at the singularity of his
manner, and the whole passed off in mirth:
though Lady Sarah declared he had made
her quite sick with his nauseous tobacco.

<pb n="177"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 3.&mdash;The ridiculous scene of
yesterday, my Cecilia, for a while called off
my thoughts from the melancholy subject
which is now nearest my heart, I mean the
shocking account which Sir George gave
me of Mrs.&mdash;, can I bear to call her&mdash;
Faulkland! but it now recurs to me with
all its horrors.  Oh, my dear, what a fatal
wretch have I been to Mr. Faulkland! my
best purposes, by some unseen power, are
perverted from their ends.  I wonder the
food which I take to nourish me is not converted
into poison when I touch it.  But I
will calm my troubled mind with this reflexion,
that I <hi rend="italic">meant</hi> not to do evil.  Mr.
Faulkland, ignorant of his own misfortune,
may (as hundreds of others int he same
situation are) still be happy, if that light
creature has but a single grain of honour
or gratitude.  I will not think of it&mdash;anticipating
as you used to call me, I will banish
the hateful idea from my mind.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 12&mdash;What do you think, my
Cecilia?  Mrs. Gerrarde has eloped from

<pb n="178"/>
her husband, and is now at Paris in quality
of mistress to a young nobleman who maintains
her in vast splendour.  I had this
news in a letter from Mrs. Faulkland today.
</p><p>Poor Pivet wrote his master an account
of it.  You know the agreement to pay
this young man an annual sum was conditional.
Upon Mr. Arnold's death, Pivet
tired of the termagant spirit, and intolerable
coquetry of his wife, was very glad to
relax his discipline; and declared, were he
to have had a thousand a year, he would
not undertake to keep her within bounds;
and that nothing but his great respect for
Mr. Faulkland could have engaged him in
the task so long.  He acknowleges that
he is very glad to be rid of her, and as
Mr. Faulkland enable him to set up very
handsomely in his business, I really think he
is happy in his loss.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 14.&mdash;I have been deeply affected,
my Cecilia, within these two days.
If it had not been in my power to relieve

<pb n="179"/>
the distress I have been a witness to, how
unhappy would it have made me!
</p><p>I was stepping out of my chariot yesterday
morning, when a young woman who
stood at my door, in an old linnen gown,
presented to me a little band-box, open
and filled with artificial flowers; she spoke
not, but the silent anguish in her looks
drew my attention.  She seemed about
eighteen, and very pretty.  As an appearance
of industry I think doubles the claim
which the poor have to our compassion, I
took out of her box a small sprig of jessamin,
very naturally imitated, and asked
the young woman if she made those flowers
herself.
</p><p>She modestly replied, she did.  And cannot
you, child, said I, find any one who
would give you constant employment in
this way to prevent your wandering about
the streets to dispose of your work?
</p><p>She answered, Yes, Madam, but I have
a poor decrepid father in jail, who cannot
be without my assistance.  I live with him,
and only come out once a week to sell my
flowers.  I might go to service, but he

<pb n="180"/>
would die if I were to leave him.  Her
gentle speech, her youth, and the unaffected
tender sorrow that appeared in her face,
when she spoke of her father, touched me
to the heart.
</p><p>I bade her come in, and taking her into
the parlour, was desirous to ask her some
questions.
</p><p>You look, said I, as if you had not been
bred in poverty; pray, what is your father?
</p><p>She blushed, and with down-cast eyes
replied, A clergyman, Madam.
</p><p>A clergyman, I repeated, what misfortunes
(for such I must suppose they were)
drove him to the distressed situation you
mention?
</p><p>It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a misfortune, Madam, and not
any crime, answered the girl with tears in
her eyes; my father is as good a man as
ever was born.
</p><p>I asked his name, and she told me it was
Price.
</p><p>My curiosity was excited by her manner.
I desired her to sit down, and relate to me
the particulars of her story.

<pb n="181"/>
</p><p>She obeyed with a sensible politeness that
pleased me.
</p><p>A bout twelve years ago, said she, my
father had a little cure in Berkshire; he
was reckoned a fine preacher and a very
great scholar, and what was more than
either, one of the best of men.  In the
parish to which my father belonged, lived a
gentleman of a very great estate, his name
was Ware; he was himself a very worthy
man, and had so high an opinion of my father,
that he pitched upon him to go abroad
in quality of governour to his only son,
then a youth of about nineteen.  As my
father had travelled in the same capacity
once before, he was very well qualified for
the employment; and had no objection to
the acceptance of it but his leaving my mother,
of whom he was very fond, and me
his only child, then scarce more than an
infant.  The elder Mr. Ware assured him
he would be a friend and guardian to us
both (and so he was) and that he would, in
his absence, allow us double the income
which my father received from his cure.

<pb n="182"/>
</p><p>This, together with the appointment,
which he was to receive as his son's governor
was too handsome an offer to be refused,
especially as the gentleman promised he
should never want a patron in him while he
lived; and every body knew he had interest
enough to make his promise of consequence.
My father was then past fifty, but as he was
of a very healthy strong constitution, he did
not think it too late to undertake, for the
good of his family, what he said was a very
troublesome talk.
</p><p>I could not help interrupting the young
gentlewoman to ask her how it came to pass
that her father, such a man as she represented
him to be, was not better provided for at
his time of life, especially as she said he had
before been intrusted with the care of a pupil,
whom I presumed to be a person of fortune,
as scarce any others are sent to travel.
</p><p>She said, he had a small patrimony of his
own, and that his original design was to study
physic; but being persuaded by the
particular love he bore a young gentleman,
to whom he was private tutor at the university,
to go abroad with him, he had for

<pb n="183"/>
some years, while they continued on their
travels, been obliged to decline this study.
When he had brought his pupil safe back to
England, he intended to pursue it, and for
this purpose was preparing to go to Leyden;
but the gentleman, who really had an affection
for him, declared he could not part with
him; and that if he would consent to stay
and take holy orders, he would get him a
living which was in his father's gift (a nobleman
then alive,) as soon as it should become
vacant, of which there was a good
prospect, on account of the age of the incumbent;
and that in the mean time he should
live with him.  As the young gentleman
had been married immediately after his return
from his travels to a lady of a vast fortune,
and was settled with a family of his own
about him, my father, who fondly loved
him, did not disrelish the proposal; and
without much difficulty consented to it.
He now laid aside the thoughts of physic,
and turned his attention to the study of divinity;
nor was he in haste for the promised
living's being vacated, as he was resolved
not to take orders till he was properly

<pb n="184"/>
qualified for the holy profession he was now
destined to.  He continued thus four years
with his young patron; the gentleman who
possessed the living, though very sickly still
holding it.
</p><p>My father being then inclined to go into
orders, his friend got him nominated to a
cure in town, the duties of which he constantly
performed for two years, still living
with his benefactor: but it was his misfortune
then to lose him.,  He was drowned
in crossing a deep water on horseback which
he thought was fordable.  My poor father
had now lost, as it proved, his only friend;
though he then but lamented him as a son
he loved; and I have heard him say he was
more afflicted for his death, than his real
father was.
</p><p>As that nobleman was well acquainted
with his son's intentions in regard to his tutor,
my father had no doubts of his fulfilling
them, especially as he had given his
promise to do so.  About this time the curate
of the parish in Berkshire which I mentioned
to you before, having a mind to
make an exchange for one in London

<pb n="185"/>
where all his friends lived, proposed it to
my father who had been at college with
him.  As he had now no attachment in
town, and preferred a country life, he readily
agreed to the change; and having first
waited on the father of his late friend to
remind him of his promise, which he again
confirmed, he went down to Berkshire.
Here it was he fell in love with my mother,
who was the daughter of the rector whose
cure he served; she liked him, and as her
father looked upon him as a man certain of
preferment, and every way esteemable in his
character, he did not scruple to give her to
him.
</p><p>In a few months after their marriage, the
incumbent of the long-promised living died.
</p><p>My father immediately waited on the nobleman,
so sure of success that he thought
he should have nothing to do but to thank
him for it; but that Lord told him with a
pretended concern, that he had disposed of
it, having heard that my father was well
provided for in Berkshire, and had married
a lady of great fortune.

<pb n="186"/>
</p><p>He returned home shocked and disappointed
more on account of the family he
had married into, than on his own.  He
now found himself at near forty years of age,
with a family coming on him, and no other
provision than a curacy of forty pounds a
year.  My grandfather pretended he had
been deceived by him, and made that excuse
for withdrawing all his favour from
him.  My mother had children pretty fast,
but they all died young excepting myself;
and as he loved her too well to let her feel
the inconvenience of streightened circumstances,
he was content to let his own little
patrimony, which he had preserved till now,
gradually waste; for my grandfather never
gave her any fortune.  At his death, which
happened a few years after, it appeared he
could not, for he left but a little behind him.
In this situation, my father having lost all
hopes of being better provided for, with
the melancholy reflexion of having thrown
away the best part of his days in a fruitless
attendance and expectation, dragged on a
life of obscurity and toil for eleven years;

<pb n="187"/>
and then it was that Mr. Ware applied to
him in the manner I have mentioned.
</p><p>I told this amiable girl, I was glad I had
interrupted the thread of her story, as by
that means she had obliged me with so many
interesting particulars of her family, and
then requested she would proceed.  She
bowed with a pretty modest grace, and
went on.
</p><p>I informed you, Madam, that my father,
having accepted of the tuition of Mr. Ware's
son prepared to attend him on his travels.
He took his leave very reluctantly of my
poor mother and me, whom he tenderly recommended
to Mr. Ware's patronage, and
set out with the young gentleman, having
give up his cure, as his absence was to be
of a long continuance.
</p><p>Mr. Ware, who was a truly good man,
was punctual in the performance of his promise
towards my mother and me, and behaved
while my father was away like a second
parent.  His son continued abroad upwards
of four years, and returned a very accomplished
gentleman.

<pb n="188"/>
</p><p>Mr. Ware was exceedingly pleased with
my father's conduct, for which he told him
both his son and himself owed him the utmost
gratitude.  He was now far advanced
in years, and grown indolent from infirmities,
he thought it better to be himself the
rewarded of my father's merit, than take upon
him the trouble of solliciting other people
to provide for him; and accordingly resolved
to give him an annual income of two
hundred pounds during his life.  He told
him, at the same time that as his estate was
entailed, it was not in his power to confirm
this grant by a will; but he was sure his son
was too sensible of what he owed him, not to
promise in the most solemn manner to continue
to him this income, when he should
come to his inheritance.  The young gentleman,
who was present, handsomely acknowleged
the obligations he had to my
father, and assured him he thought he could
never sufficiently repay them.
</p><p>My father, who now wished for nothing
more than to sit down peaceably on a competency,
thought himself very happy; he retired

<pb n="189"/>
to his little house in Berkshire, where
my mother and I still lived, and gave himself
up to domestic contentment.
</p><p>The old gentleman was punctual to his
agreement, constantly paying my father
fifty pounds every quarter.  He died in something
less than three years; his son immediately
on his accession to his fortune, being
at that time in London, wrote my father a
very affectionate letter, assuring him of the
continuance of his friendship.  Nor did he
fail in his promise; for two years he was
punctual in his remittances to my father.
He did not during that time come down to
Berkshire, having another country-seat, of
which he was fonder.  At this time I lost
my dear mother, who had been for some
years in a declining way; and though during
her health, as she was an exceedingly good
oeconomist, my father might have laid by
some of his income, yet the frequent journeys
she was prescribed to Bath, and other
places, for change of air, together with the
expence of physicians at home, put it out
of his power to save any thing: which on
my account gave him great uneasiness;

<pb n="190"/>
but as he was still strong and hale, he was
in hopes he might yet live to lay by something
for me.  I was now about fifteen, and
the darling of my father's heart.  He was
inconsolable for my mother's death, but I
endeavoured to comfort him, and at last in
some measure succeeded.  Mr. Ware, whom
my father had not seen since the death of the
good old gentleman, came down now to
revisit his paternal seat.  He would not
omit paying a visit of condolement to his
old friend and tutor, and accordingly came
to our house the day after his arrival in the
country.  Though I had seen him before,
as it was in my childhood, I had taken but
little notice of him; he is indeed a handsome
genteel young man.
</p><p>The innocent girl blushed as she spoke
these words, but I seemed not to observe
it.
</p><p>She proceeded with a sigh.  My father
who loved him, was rejoiced to see him;
Mr. Ware behaved with a tenderness and
respect almost filial towards him, and was
very obliging to me.  He continued about
a week in the country, calling to ask my father

<pb n="191"/>
how he did every day.  When he was
about to return to London, he pressed my
father to pass a few weeks with him in
town: you are melancholy here, said he,
changing the scene a little, will divert both
your daughter and you.
</p><p>My father thanked him for the honour
he did him, but modestly declined it.
</p><p>Mr. Ware guessed at his motive, and told
him, smiling, I know your objection, but to
obviate it at once, I must tell you that I have
prevailed on my sister to come and keep
house for me, and I expect to find her at
home on my return.  I knew his sister, a
maiden lady some years older than himself,
who had on the death of his father gone to
live with a near relation of theirs.  My father
smiling in his turn, told him he had
guessed his mind rightly, and since that was
the case, he would not deprive his poor girl
(looking at me) of the happiness of the
good lady's company for a while.
</p><p>Mr. Ware said, we might go to town
with him in his coach, and as we had but
little preparation to make, we set out with
him next day.

<pb n="192"/>
</p><p>When we arrived at his house in London,
he welcomed us with all the marks of politeness
and respect.  I was surprized we did
not see his sister the whole night, but as she
was not apprized of our coming, I thought
that either she was abroad, or had not yet
quitted her friend with whom she lived.
</p><p>The next morning at breakfast Mr. Ware
made an apology for his sister's absence.  He
said, that the lady, at whose house she lived,
was ill, and that she could not possibly leave
her till she was better, which he supposed
would be in a few days, as her sickness was
no other than the consequence of her lying-in; mean while he hoped Mr. Price would
not be uneasy, as he was himself his daughter's
guardian.
</p><p>Though my father was not pleased at this
excuse, he however concealed his thoughts
from Mr. Ware; but told me if Miss Ware
did not come home in a few days, he purposed
that we should take our leave and return
to the country.
</p><p>We had very handsome apartments assigned
us; and my father was put in possession
of Mr. Ware's library; a very noble

<pb n="193"/>
one, where that gentleman knew he would
pass his most agreeable hours.
</p><p>For my part as I did not care to go abroad,
till I had a proper person for me to
appear with, I declined the offer Mr. Ware
very obligingly made of getting some ladies
of his acquaintance to take me to public
places.  I expected his sister every day,
and if she came, as I knew my father purposed
staying a month, I thought I should
have time enough to see every thing; so I
chose to entertain myself with working, and
reading in my own room.
</p><p>But, Madam, I soon found that Mr. Ware
was a very base man.  The third day after
we came to his house, his behaviour towards
me began to change intirely from what it
was before; he took every opportunity of
being particular to me in his compliments.
I received them at first with that distant civility
which I thought would neither encourage
nor offend; I looked upon him as
a worthy young man, and my father's friend
and benefactor; and thought in my humble
station I should not be too quick at taking
exceptions, as there had nothing as yet appeared

<pb n="194"/>
in his behaviour which exceeded the
bounds of respect: but he did not preserve
this long; on the fifth day he came into a
closet where I was reading, and there in the
warmest manner declared himself my lover.
I would fain have turned his discourse into
pleasantry, but he had recourse to oaths and
protestations, and swore he could not live
without my favour.  I represented the cruelty
of the insult he offered me in his own
house, and begged he would leave me, as I
was determined to depart immediately.  I
will not, Sir, said I, let me father know the
unkind return you have made for all his care
of you, but I can easily prevail with him to
leave your house.  He fell at my feet, begged
my pardon, and talked all that sort of
stuff which I have read in romances.  At
length I got him out of the closet, and locked
the door; resolving never to sit alone,
without using the same precaution while we
staid in his house, which I hoped would not
be above a day or two longer; for I concluded
there was no sister to come, and that
this was only made use of as a share to
draw us to town.
</p><p>
<pb n="195"/>
</p><p>As I had a mind to try the young girl,
I asked her, How came you to receive
Mr. Ware's addresses int he manner you
mentioned? how did you know but he intended
to marry you?
</p><p>Ah no, Madam, said she, I could not
entertain such a thought; I have not troubled
you with the particulars of what he said
to me, but young as I was, I knew too well
what it tended to; besides the fear he shewed
lest my father should know of his pretended
courtship, was enough to convince me what
his designs were, without any thing else to
guide me.
</p><p>Did you like him, I asked?  The ingenuous
young woman blushed.
</p><p>I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> have liked him, Madam, she replied,
better than any body I had ever seen,
if there had not been such a distance between
us.  I desired her to proceed.
</p><p>I told my father that same evening, that
as I saw there was no likelihood of the lady's
coming to her brother; and as I led but a
melancholy life, having no woman to converse
with, I had much rather be at home
amongst my neighbours and acquaintance,

<pb n="196"/>
and begged he would return to Berkshire.
</p><p>My father said, it was what he had determined
on after completing our week in
town, unless Miss Ware came in the interim;
I have just told our friend so, said he;
he seems to take it unkindly, and says he is
afraid he has disobliged me; but I assured
him my only reason was, that I did not
think the house of a handsome young batchelor,
a proper place for a pretty little country
girl, even though her old father was
with her.  He assures me his sister will
come, and wants to protract our stay a
few days longer; I hardly know how to
refuse his entreaties, but I shall be uneasy
till we are home.
</p><p>I told my father, Mr. Ware had too
much sense to take his refusal amiss, and
begged of him to stick to his day.
</p><p>I gave Mr. Ware no opportunity of speaking
to me the remainder of that day, nor all
the next; though he came to my closet
door where I always sat, and entreated for
admission; but I was peremptory in my denial,

<pb n="197"/>
and he went away reproaching me
with cruelty.
</p><p>Mr. Ware made an apology to my father,
on account of his being obliged to
spend the evening abroad, the first time
that he had been absent from us since we
came to his house.  He had twice entertained
us with a very agreeable concert, at
which there was a great deal of company,
both gentlemen and ladies.  He had got it
performed at his own house, on purpose to
amuse my father, who was a great lover
of music; but excepting those two mornings,
I had never seen any company with
him, as he said he would not invite strangers,
till I had got a companion of my own
six to keep me in countenance.   My father
and I supped alone; we were to go ut of
town the next day, and we retired to our
respective chambers about eleven o'clock,
in order to go to bed.
</p><p>The poor girl paused at this part of her
story, as if she were ashamed to proceed.
</p><p>I hope, said I, Mr. Ware did not violate
the laws of hospitality, by intruding on you
that night.  Oh, Madam, he did, he did,

<pb n="198"/>
said she, the vile wretch hid himself somewhere,
I know not where, for it was not in
my closet.  The house-keeper slept in my
room, in a little tent-bed, which had been
put up for that purpose; but she was not
as yet come up stairs.  The chamber-maid,
who had attended me to my room, told me
there was to be a great deal of company to
dine with her master the next day, and as
the house-keeper was very busy in making
jellies and pastry, she was afraid she should
sit up late, and hoped I should not be disturbed
at her coming into the room.  I always
dismissed the maid immediately, as I
was not used to have a person to undress me.
I went to bed, but not being a very sound
sleeper, and knowing a particularity I had,
which was, that if once rouzed, I could not
compose myself to rest again, I resolved not
to attempt it at all 'till the house-keeper
came to bed.  I placed the candle on a stand
near me, and took up a book that I found
on a chair, by my bed-side, which I had
been reading in the evening.  I had been
about an hour thus employed, when I heard
somebody treading softly in the room: as

<pb n="199"/>
I had not heard the door open, I called out,
in a fright, to know who was there.  I received
no answer; but immediately Mr.
Ware presented himself, on his knees, at
my bed-side, and half leaning on my bed.
I shrieked out; I knew not what he said,
but I remember the most wicked of men
held me fast, and talked a great deal; I
continued shrieking incessantly, and struggling
to get loose from him, which at last
I did, by giving a violent spring, which
three me out of bed on the floor.
</p><p>I had hurt myself sadly by the fall; but
dragging the quilt off the bed after me, I
wrapped it about me, and shrieked louder
than before.  The vile man tried to pacify
me, and said I should disturb my father.
</p><p>Providentially for me, my dear father had
not gone to bed, for his room as a great
way from mine, but was reading in the study,
which was over my bed-chamber.  He
had heard my shrieks from the first, but,
little dreaming it was his poor daughter's
voice, he imagined the noise was in the
street, and had lifted up the sash, and looked
out to try whence it proceeded.  Finding

<pb n="200"/>
every thing quiet without doors, he ran
down stairs, and was led, by my cries, into
my room, for my vile persecutor had not
locked the door, very well knowing none
of his own people could dare to molest him,
and he did not think my cries would have
reached my father's ears, as indeed they
would not, if he had gone to bed.  Think,
Madam, what my poor father must feel,
when he saw me on the floor (for I was not
able to rise) such a spectacle of horror;
my capt was off, and my nose bleeding with
the fall.
</p><p>The wretch was endeavouring to lift me
up, and I trying to resist him.  Good God
defend me! said my father, what is this I
see?  Oh, Sir, said I, clinging round him,
carry me out of the house! carry me out
directly from this monster! my father
looked aghast.  You do not mean Mr.
Ware, my child, said he, it cannot be <hi rend="italic">He</hi>
who has put you into this condition?  Mr.
Ware quitted the room the minute he saw
my father, which was not till I catched hold
of him: for he had his back to the door,

<pb n="201"/>
and, I suppose, was in too much agitation
to hear him coming in.
</p><p>My poor father, speechless with astonishment,
took me into his arms, and put me
sitting on the bed; then stepping into my
closet, brought out a bottle of water, some
of which he made me drink, and afterwards
washed the blood from my face, which he
soon found only proceeded from my having
hurt my nose a little.
</p><p>When I had recovered breath enough, I
told him all that had passed.  His despair,
Madam, is not to be described; he tore his
hair, and was like a madman.  Where is
the ungrateful villain, said he? I will go
this minute and upbraid him with his
treachery; he ran to the chamber-door, but
it was locked on the outside.  My father
thus prevented from going out, had time to
cool a little; he considered it would be to
no purpose to reproach a powerful tyrant
with the injuries he did us; he resolved to
quit the inhospitable house as soon as any
one in the family was up to open the door
to him, and without ever seeing his face

<pb n="202"/>
again, commit himself to providence for
his future subsistence.
</p><p>It would have been happy for us if he
could have executed this design; but the
profligate man prevented us.  We spent
the remainder of the night in lamenting out
misery.  At day-light Mr. Ware entered
the room in his night-gown, for I suppose
he had gone to rest after he left us.
</p><p>He told my father he was sorry for what
had passed, and imputed it to his having
drunk too much.  I own, said he, I love
your daughter to distraction, and could not
bear the thoughts of losing her, as I found
you resolved to go out of town so suddenly.
My father answered, I will not reproach you
as I ought, but my tender care of your
youth did not deserve this return: suffer us
to depart out of your house, and you shall
never more be troubled with us.
</p><p>Mr. Ware entreated to speak with my father
by himself, and with much difficulty
prevailed on him to go into his study with
him.  The staid together near half an
hour, and I heard them talking high; my
father then entered my room with tears

<pb n="203"/>
streaming from his eyes.  He threw himself
into a chair in an agony of grief.  The
villain, said he, has finished his work&mdash;he
has stabbed your father's heart&mdash;I ran to
him almost frantic; I thought he had made
an attempt upon his life.  When I found
he was not hurt, I asked him the meaning
of his words.
</p><p>He would have me <hi rend="italic">sell</hi> you to him, said
he; he would have bribed the father to prostitute
his child.  Oh, Sir, said I, why do
we stay under this detested room?  There is
no safety for us here, said he, come, my
dear, let us get out of the house, and then
we will consider which way we are to turn
ourselves.
</p><p>My father laid hold of my hand, and I
followed him, just as I was in my morning
gown.  We thought if we could once find
ourselves in the street, we should be happy,
though neither of us knew where to go,
having no acquaintance in London.  I had
never been there before, and my father had
been so long absent, that he was forgotten
by every body.

<pb n="204"/>
</p><p>We got out of my room into a little sort
of anti-chamber, but found the door of that
fast locked.
</p><p>We now gave ourselves up for lost; our
despair is not to be expressed; we sat down,
and consulted what was best to be done.  I
saw now there was nothing that our base
persecutor would not attempt, and I told
my father I was resolved at all events to
make my escape.
</p><p>He said that the shocking wretch had
given him til the next day to consider of
his proposal; and he hoped, by that time,
both father and daughter would come
enough to their senses, to think he had
made them a very advantageous offer.
</p><p>I told him in that lucky interval I hoped
to be able to affect my deliverance; which
I thought I might accomplish, with his
assistance, by tying the sheets of my bed
together, and so from the window, sliding
into the street.
</p><p>We were both pleased with this expedient;
but the next thing to be considered
was, what place I should go to, as I could
not make this attempt till late at night, and

<pb n="205"/>
must go alone; for my father being in
years, and pretty corpulent, I could not
think of letting him run the same hazard,
which might have put his life into imminent
danger, especially as I could not give him
the same help which he could afford me.
This was a difficulty, till I recollected a
mantua-maker, who was then making some
cloaths for me; and I happened to know
where she lived.  To her house I resolved
to go (having first settled all my previous
steps) and to remain concealed there till my
father should get an opportunity of coming
to me.  I told him as <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was the unhappy object
on whom Mr. Ware had designs, I supposed
he would not detain my father after I
was gone.  He shook his head, but said,
he hoped he would not.
</p><p>Having now settled our little plan, we
were more composed.  A servant brought
breakfast into my apartment at the usual
hour, and dinner, and supper, in the like
manner.  We did not appear troubled, but
as carefully avoided seeming chearful, for
fear of giving suspicion.

<pb n="206"/>
</p><p>The house-keeper was generally the last
person up in the family; so that I was
either to seize the opportunity before she
came up to my room, or wait till she was
asleep.  The last I thought the securest method,
as she was an extremely sound sleeper.
I lifted up the sash in the bed-chamber, to
be in readiness, and closed the shutters
again.
</p><p>Very fortunately my father, having received
his quarterly payment from Mr.
Ware just before we came to town, had
fifty guineas in his purse, half of which he
insisted on my taking in case of any emergency.
</p><p>About twelve o'clock the house-keeper
came into the room where we were sitting,
as she was obliged to pass through that to
go to the room where we lay.
</p><p>We heard her at the door, and my father
suddenly changing the subject of our
discourse, made me a sign which I understood;
and as the woman entered, affected
to be representing to me the charms of
wealth and grandeur, whilst I seemed to
listen with a sort of pleasure to him.  He

<pb n="207"/>
stopped when the woman came in, but not
till he was sure she had heard what he said,
for we observed she staid at the outside of
the door a little while, as if to listen to our
conversation.  On seeing us engaged in discourse,
she made a motion to withdraw, saying
she would come up again when Mr.
Price was retired to rest; but I told her she
might if she pleased, then go to bed, as we
should not sit up long.  But as I suppose
she had orders to lock me in after my father
had left me, she did not chuse to do
this.  She said she was not sleepy, but
would come up in half an hour, and left the
room smiling.
</p><p>This was an opportunity which I thought
was not to be lost.  I repaired to the window,
and hearing a watchman cry the hour,
I waited till he came under it, and having
prepared a piece of paper, in which I had
put a weight to carry it down, I lighted it
and dropped it at his feet; it was fastened
to a string, and at some distance from it
above, was fastened another large piece of
white paper folded up, in which I put a
guinea, and in two lines written in a large

<pb n="208"/>
plain hand, beseeched him to assist me in
getting down, for which I would reward
him with another guinea.
</p><p>The lighted paper (as I concluded it
would) attracted the man's notice, he stopped
and took it up, and finding another
paper hanging to the string, looked up at
the window.  I leaned my body out as far
as I could, and, in a low voice, but loud
enough for him to hear me, bid him read it.
He opened the paper, and,by the light of
his own lantern, read the lines, at the same
time taking out the guinea, which I could
perceive he also examined by the same
light.  He then said, I'll help you, stay a
little.
</p><p>He made what haste he could away, and
I was not afraid he intended to leave me,
and return no more.  My terror was inexpressible
during the man's absence, especially
as several people in that interval passed
by; however, he soon returned with a companion;
and the street being now clear, I
saw he had brought a sort of plank, or board,
under his arm, which he fixed from the
iron pallisados a-cross to the stone-work

<pb n="209"/>
which jutted out from the bottom of the
lower windows, on this he without difficulty
mounted, and being now much nearer to
me, he told me he would receive me, if I
could contrive to get down to him.
</p><p>My poor father hastily kissed, and blessed
me, and having my apparatus ready for descending,
he had the farther precaution to
fix some strong ribbons, which I had tied
together for the purpose, under my arms;
these he held in his hands, whilst I slid down
by the sheets which I had fastened together
corner-ways with a knot.
</p><p>The trusty watchman caught me in his
arms, and lifted me over the pallisados, to
his comrade, who set me safely down in the
street.
</p><p>It was very dark, but I could distinguish
when my father drew int he linen, and heard
him shut the window.  I then told my deliverer
that I must beg a farther act of
kindness from him,m which was to see me
safe to the street where I wanted to go.
</p><p>He readily complied, and leaving it to
his comrade to carry away the plank, took

<pb n="210"/>
me under the arm, and we got without being
molested to the mantua-maker's house.
</p><p>The family were all in bed; when after
repeated knocking, a maid looked out of an
upper window, and asked us what we wanted.
I told her an acquaintance of her mistress
had urgent business with her, and begged
she would step down and speak to me
from the parlour window.  After keeping
me along while waiting, she at length came
down, I then gave the watchman the other
guinea I had promised him, and dismissed
him, very well pleased with his night's adventure.
</p><p>After he was gone, I told the woman my
name, and begged she would let me in,
which she immediately did.  I without
scruple acquainted her with the manner of
my escape, and the occasion of it; she was
shocked and affected with my story, and
promised to keep me concealed till my father
should come to carry me to some place
of greater safety; for she said, as Mr.
Ware's house-keeper was her acquaintance,
I might be discovered at her house.

<pb n="211"/>
</p><p>This terrified me exceedingly, but the
good-natured woman gave me the most
solemn assurances that I should be safe for
the short time she supposed I should stay
with her.  She invited me to part of her bed,
as she told me she had never a spare one,
and I readily accepted her offer.
</p><p>I remained all the next day in the utmost
grief and anxiety, at hearing nothing from
my poor father.  In the evening of the second
day, a porter brought a letter to the
mantua-maker, which served only as a cover
for a note directed to me.  Seeing it
writ in my father's hand, I eagerly opened
it; but oh, Madam, how shall I tell you
my grief, and horrour, when I saw it dated
from a prison!  My poor father told me,
that our cruel persecutor, enraged at my
escape, which he did not discover 'till next
day, had charged my father with it, who
immediately acknowleged he had assisted
in delivering me from ruin; that Mr. Ware,
after treating him with the most injurious
language, demanded payment of him for
the sums he said he had lent him from time
to time since his father's death.

<pb n="212"/>
</p><p>To this my father making no other reply,
than that Mr. Ware knew he had it
not in his power to refund any of that money,
which, though it was a free gift, he
would restore sooner than lie under any obligation
to such a base man, the villain was
barbarous enough to have him arrested, and
set to jail, where he said he should remain,
till his stubborn spirit should be glad to
yield up his daughter to him.
</p><p>My father desired me to come to him directly,
and to bring some body with me to
protect me by the way.  I instantly obeyed,
and sending for a hackney coach, the
mantua-maker got her husband, a decent
tradesman, and his apprentice to accompany
me.  We drove directly to my poor
father's melancholy habitation, where they
delivered me safe into his hands.  His joy
at seeing me again, made him for a while
forget the sorrows which surrounded us.
</p><p>He told me, that after he had seen me get
safe into the street, and had recommended
me to the care of providence, he had put
every thing out of the way which had assisted
me in my escape; and putting out one

<pb n="213"/>
of the candles left in my room, that the
house-keeper, when she come up, might
suppose me in bed; he then went to his own.
He concluded that the woman, when she
went into my room, supposed me asleep.
Mr. Ware was at home the whole evening,
and had before that retired to rest, so that
there was no discovery made that night.
</p><p>My father now informed me that Mr.
Ware had said, when he first made the odious
proposal to him, that if I complied,
he would allow my father four hundred
pounds a year, and settle the like sum upon
me for life; at the same time, in case
of refusal, insinuating the threat which he
afterwards put in execution.  Thinking,
no doubt, he should by this intimidate my
poor father so much, that upon reflexion
he would use his endeavours to prevail on
me to comply; and it was for this wicked
purpose he was permitted, or rather compelled,
to pass the whole day with me.  I
would not, added my father relate this
particular to you, for fear your tenderness
to me might shake your virtue: but the trial
God be praised! is now past; you are here

<pb n="214"/>
my poor child at least in safety.  We have
some money to support us for a while, perhaps
the wicked wretch may relent.  If he
gives me my liberty I may still obtain a livelihood;
and if I can get you received into
some worthy family, that will protect you
from his violence, I shall be contented.
</p><p>My father, unwilling to expose his ungrateful
pupil, and thinking when he cooled
a little he would be ashamed of his conduct
and release him, resolved not to apprise
any of his friends in Berkshire of his situation;
but wrote a long expostulatory letter
to Mr. Ware, which he concluded with requesting
no other favour but his liberty.
</p><p>To this, Mr. Ware wrote in answer, that
he was still ready to make good his first proposals,
and since he now found he had got
his daughter with him, he should obtain his
liberty on no other terms.
</p><p>My father still oath to believe him so lost
to humanity as to persist in this barbarous
resolution, patiently waited another month;
at the end of which he again wrote him a
very affecting letter; but to this he received
no answer, being told Mr. Ware was

<pb n="215"/>
gone into Berkshire.  He wrote to two or
three gentlemen of his acquaintance there,
informing them of his deplorable situation,
and begging them to use their influence
with Mr. Ware in his behalf.  He did not
disclose the enormity of his behaviour, but
only said, that on a quarrel he had with
him, he had confined him under colour
of a debt, which it was not in his power to
discharge; this he did as much in tenderness
to Mr. Ware's character, as to avoid
exasperating him more against him.
</p><p>He ordered me at the same time to write
to an old maid-servant, who took care of
our little house in the country, to send me
my cloaths, my father's books, and such
other things as belonged to him.  As I had
come to town but for a month, and was in
deep mourning for my mother, I had left
the best part of my apparel behind me, and
I had taken nothing with me from Mr.
Ware's but a little bundle of linnen; my father
had been permitted to carry his with
him to the prison.
</p><p>As the furniture in this little house was
of no great value, my father having purchased

<pb n="216"/>
it as it stood in the house of the former
curate, he made a present of it to this
old servant, who had lived with him from
the time he married.
</p><p>He received no answer to any of the letters
he wrote to the gentlemen; but I got a
letter from this old servant, as the same
time that she sent the things which I wrote
for.  And you will scarce believe, Madam,
to what a height this abandoned wretch carried
his crimes.
</p><p>Not contented with having plunged my]
poor father and me into the deepest distress,
he endeavoured to blast and destroy our
characters in the country.  He gave out
that my father, taking advantage of his
(Mr. Ware's) being a little overcome with
wine one night, had put his daughter to
bed to him, and would have insisted the
next day that he had married them.  To
punish the ungrateful designing old rogue,
he said, he had put him into jail, where he
intended to keep him a month or two till he
repented.
</p><p>Though the respectable character my father
bore in his neighbourhood made this

<pb n="217"/>
story incredible, yet Mr. Ware's power and
influence was such, that people seemed to
believe it, and applauded Mr. Ware's clemency
in my father's punishment.  No
wonder then his letters were unanswered;
they were shewn to Mr. Ware, and laughed
at.  The old servant, who was sure we were
both cruelly belied, lamented our unhappy
fate, but poor creature she could do nothing
<hi rend="italic">but</hi> lament.  This last blow quite subdued
my father's courage; he fell sick upon it,
and languished many weeks in a most melancholy
condition.
</p><p>When he recovered a little from his sickness,
he was suddenly struck with the dead
palsey on one side, by which he lost the use
of his right hand; so that I am obliged to
dress and undress him like a child.
</p><p>When the money which we had brought
with us to the prison was spent, we were
obliged to sell most of my father's books,
and the best of my cloaths.
</p><p>We had repeated messages from the merciless
man, by his vile house-keeper, who
used all her rhetoric to persuade us to
compliance; but my father constantly repulsed

<pb n="218"/>
her, with contempt and indignation;
till at length Mr. Ware, tired, I believe,
with persecuting us, left us to perish in
peace.  He supposed my father could not
hold out long, and he then concluded I
should be at his mercy; for as I never
stirred out of the jail, he had no hopes of
getting me into his power whilst my poor
father lived.
</p><p>If I had even had a place of refuge to go
to, I could not think of leaving him in the
wretched helpless condition to which he was
now reduced.  I thought therefore of applying
myself to something, by which I
could obtain bread for our support.  I set
about making those little artificial flowers,
which had formerly been one of my amusements;
and a woman, who was confined in
the same prison with us, and worked for
some shops, undertook to dispose of them
for me.  She had a daughter, who came
often to see her, and used to carry her work
and mine to the people who bespoke it.
</p><p>In this manner we have languished, Madam,
near eighteen months; when hearing
lately that Mr. Ware has gone to Bath, and

<pb n="219"/>
the girl who used to visit her mother being
sick, I ventured out myself with the work.
The person who employs us did live in the
city, but has lately taken a shop in this
street; and though it is a journey from
what I now call my dismal home, I have
come to her once a week, for this month
past, with the product of my own, and, I
may say, my fellow prisoner's labours.  She
this day told me she was overstocked with
such flowers as I brought her, and, having
picked out a few of the best of them, she
left those, which you see in the band-box,
upon my hands.  I was returning home
very disconsolate, when, to avoid your chariot,
which drew up close to the house, I
stood up on one of your steps, not knowing
it was going to stop; and something in your
countenance, Madam, I know not how,
encouraged me to offer my little ware to
you.
</p><p>I have given you this affecting story, my
Cecilia, pretty nearly in the girl's own
words. I was much moved by it.  If this
be all fact, said I, what monsters are there
among mankind!

<pb n="220"/>
</p><p>She replied, It was all very true.
</p><p>Though the girl was very young, and, as
I told you, had a modest and ingenuous
look, yet as I had seen such cheating faces
before, I would not yield up my belief implicitly.
This story might be invented to
move compassion, at least, the most material
circumstances of it; and though I could
not suppose she had contrived it on the spot,
yet I did not know but it might have been
contrived for her.
</p><p>I have a mind to see your father, child,
said I.
</p><p>She answered, quite composed, Then,
Madam, you will see an object, that would
greatly move your pity.
</p><p>She rose up as she spoke this, saying, her
poor father would be very uneasy at her
staying so long, and was preparing to go.
</p><p>I was seized with a strong inclination to
visit this unhappy father directly.  If, said
I, the case be as she represents it, I cannot
be too speedy in my relief; and, if she has
falsified in any thing, I shall probably detect
her, by not giving her an opportunity
of seeing and preparing him first.

<pb n="221"/>
</p><p>It was not more than eleven o'clock; and
I resolved not to defer the charity I intended.
I desired the young woman to stay a
while, and ordering Patty to bring down a
plain black silk hood and scarf of her own,
I made the poor girl, to her great astonishment,
put them on.  I then ordered a hackney
coach to be called, and said, I would
go with her to her father.  She looked surprized,
but not startled, which made a favourable
impression on me.  She appeared
decent, and I desired her to get into the
coach, which I ordered, according to her
direction, to drive to the jail, where her father
was confined.
</p><p>When we arrived at this mansion of horrour,
for so it appeared to me, I let her go
up stairs before me.  She stopped at a door,
and said that was the room where her father
lay.  I bid her go in first; she entered, and
I stood without-side the door, where (as the
lobby was dark) I could not readily be perceived.
</p><p>I saw there a man of about sixty; and,
as she had told me her father was corpulent,
I did not at first take him to be the

<pb n="222"/>
person, for he looked worn out, pale, and
emaciated.  He wore his own grisled hair,
and had on a cassock, girded about him with
a silk sash.  One of his hands was slung in a
black crape; he sat pensively, leaning on a
table, with a book open before him, which
seemed to be the Bible.
</p><p>Upon his daughter's going into the room,
he lifted up his eyes to see who it was: he
had a fine countenance; candour and sincerity
were painted on it.
</p><p>My dear, you made a long stay, said he,
in a melancholy voice, I was afraid something
had happened to you.  What has detained you?
</p><p>Oh, Sir, said she, looking towards the
door, I believe I met with a good angel,
who is come to visit you in prison.
</p><p>I entered at these words: The venerable
man rose&mdash;A good angel indeed, if her
mind be like her face!  He bowed respectfully.
</p><p>Pray, Sir, keep your seat.
</p><p>I took a chair, and placed myself by him.
He did not seem in the least embarrassed,
but gravely, and modestly demanded to

<pb n="223"/>
what it was that he owed the honour of a
visit form a lady of my appearence; for,
said he, affluence and prosperity seldom
seek the dwellings of the wretched.
</p><p>I informed him, that, having met with
his daughter by accident, she had given me
a melancholy account of his situation, and
that I wished to hear the particulars form
his own mouth.  He made an apology for
the length of his story; but said, if I had
patience, he would relate it.  I told him,
I had come for that purpose.
</p><p>He then repeated to me every particular,
as I had before heard them from his daughter,
enlarging on certain passages, which
she had but slightly touched upon.  He
shewed me the copies of his two letters to
Mr. Ware, and that gentleman's answer to
the first, as also the old servant's letter to
his daughter, which convinced me of the
truth of every thing he had said.
</p><p>I asked Mr. Price, what Mr. Ware's demand
on him might amount to?
</p><p>He said, four hundred pounds, which
was what he had received from him, since
his father's death.

<pb n="224"/>
</p><p>Take courage, Sir, said I, you shall not
long remain here.
</p><p>Ah! Madam, cried he, may God be the
rewarder of your goodness! but my enemy
is a hardened man; he is not to be influenced
by honour or virtue.
</p><p>I perceived by this that the poor gentleman
had no thought of my paying his debt,
but supposed I would endeavour to soften
Mr. Ware in his favour.  Have a little
patience, said I, and we will try what is to
be done.
</p><p>I requested he would give me Mr.
Ware's letter, wherein he promised to make
good his first proposal, if he would consent
to yield up his daughter to him.
</p><p>I took my leave, and slipped my purse,
which had ten guineas in it, into his
daughter's hand as I went down stairs.
</p><p>As soon as I returned home, I sent for
Mr. Warner, and related to him circumstantially
the distresses of this worthy father
and child.  His honest indignation burst
forth against the base betrayer of them both;
honest I must call it, though he vented his
wrath in oaths and execrations on his head.

<pb n="225"/>
</p><p>These are proper objects, said I, to exercise
our humanity on; I mean to pay his
debt, and make the remnant of his days
comfortable.  You are a good girl, said he,
you know my purse is open to you.
</p><p>Oh, Sir, said I, there is no need to tax
your generosity upon this occasion, the two
thousand pounds you so lately gave me is
but little diminished.  Psha, psha, said he,
I gave you that to make ducks and drakes
of; it is not to go into the account; you
know your quarter's income is commenced,
you may have what you will.
</p><p>I begged he would immediately write to
Mr. Ware, who is now at Bath, and make
him a tender of his money, that we might
get the poor man discharged from confinement
as soon as possible.
</p><p>I gave him that vile fellow's letter, and
advised him to let him know that he was
acquainted with the whole truth of the
story; which, perhaps, might frighten him
into better terms than insisting on his whole
demand.
</p><p>Mr. Warner said, there was a merchant
of his acquaintance at Bristol, to whom he

<pb n="226"/>
would write immediately, and order him to
pay the money directly, if it was insisted on.
He said, he knew his friend would readily
undertake the thing, and execute it as soon
as possible.
</p><p>He called for pen, ink, and paper, and
wrote before me the following letter to his
correspondent, which, as he left it with me
to seal, and send to the post-office, I first
copied.
</p><p>     'Dear Sir,
</p><p>'I beg immediately on the receipt of this,
you will take the trouble of riding to
Bath, and there enquire for a man of fortune,
one Ware, who is the greatest villain
in England, and you may tell him I say so.
He has kept a poor honest clergyman
starving in jail this year and a half, because
he would not sell his daughter to him.
He pretends the parson owes him four
hundred pounds, which is a lie; for
though he received that sum from him, it
was paid him for value received by agreement.
However, as the man can have no
redress, I request you will immediately

<pb n="227"/>
tender him that sum, and get a discharge,
for I will have the poor fellow out.
</p><p>'I herewith send you inclosed a letter
which that scoundrel Ware wrote; pray
shew it to him, as a token that the parson's
case is known, and that he has got friends
to stand by him.
</p><p>'Your speedy execution of this affair,
and answer, will oblige,
</p><p>          'Your friend and servant,
</p><p>               'EDWARD WARNER.'
To Mr. William Blow,
</p><p>merchant, at Bristol.
London, March 14, 1707-8.
</p><p>My honest kinsman desired I would immediately
send this letter off.  I suppose his
correspondent will have more discretion
than to let Mr. Ware see the contents, but I
hope we shall have a good account of this
negotiation.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 22.&mdash;I have been very impatient,
my Cecilia, for an answer to Mr. Warner's
odd letter, and this day he received
one.  His friend at Bristol I take it for

<pb n="228"/>
granted acted very prudently, for he says,
that having <hi rend="italic">waited</hi> on Mr. Ware (which
word Mr. Warner took great exceptions to)
he acquainted him with his commission, and
at the same time produced his letter to Mr.
Price by way of identifying the person, as
Mr. Ware at first seemed not to recollect
any thing of the matter.  He said, Mr.
Ware blushed upon seeing his own letter, in
the hands of a stranger; Aye, I remember
the silly affair now, said he; the man is an
old hypocrite, and his daughter is a young
one; but, as I never meant to ruin him, I
will forgive him the debt; and accordingly
wrote a full acquittal, which the merchant
transmitted with his answer.
</p><p>Nothing now remained but to pay the
usual fees, and get the poor old gentleman
out as fast as we could.  Mr. Warner undertook
to do what was proper on the occasion,
and instantly set about it with an alacrity
that shewed the goodness of his heart.
</p><p>How wonderfully shame operates on some
minds! this wretched man, Ware, whom
neither the laws of God nor man could
restrain, has, by this single passion alone,

<pb n="229"/>
been subdued.  He found his base conduct
was known by people whom he could not
impose on; and his forgiving the pretended
debt, no doubt, was meant as a bribe to
prevent his disgrace from being propagated:
for though he could sit down and
enjoy himself under the accumulated guilt
of fraud, perfidy, cruelty, oppression, and
ingratitude; he was not proof against the
reproach and ridicule of the world.  This
shews at least that he was not long practised
in crimes of this sort.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 24.&mdash;I did not see Mr. Warner
again till this morning, when he entered my
room making flourishes with his hands.
Mr. Price and his daughter were with
him&mdash;Here they are for you, said he, and
it has done my heart good to deliver such
honest people form their misery.
</p><p>The good old man poured forth such
fervent prayers, and thanks for my kindness
towards them, that my heart exulted
with rapture, at being the means of conferring
such happiness, as this worthy parent
and child seemed to enjoy.  The young

<pb n="230"/>
girl's gratitude was silent, but not less ardent
than her father's.  She had kneeled
down before me, and kissed my hands.  I
was greatly touched with the humility and
tenderness of her acknowlegement.
</p><p>I put an end to the grateful effusions of
these honest hearts.  I have done but little
for you, said I, as yet; as MR. Ware had
the grace to refuse the offered sum, I shall
apply that money which I intended for him
to your future use, or your liberty will avail
you but little.
</p><p>We shall think of some method of settling
you comfortably for life; in the mean while
your daughter and you shall be welcome to
live with me.
</p><p>I stopped him from renewing his thanks,
and insisted on his saying no more on that
subject.  The poor old gentleman is extremely
feeble and languishing from his
long confinement, but I hope with proper
care, as he is naturally strong, he will recover
his health.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 1.&mdash;What true delight springs
from benevolent actions, my dear!  I never

<pb n="231"/>
experienced such heart-felt satisfaction as
I have received from restoring comfort to
these truly deserving people.  I have bought
the young lady some new cloaths, plain, but
genteel; and you cannot imagine what a
pretty creature she is, now she is dressed.
I find the old gentleman a man of admirable
understanding, and great reading.  He
has a simplicity in his manner that is truly
engaging, but at the same time a politeness
that shews he is no stranger to the great
world.  Of his integrity he has given convincing
proofs.  Praised be the Lord! who
has made me, and honest Mr. Warner,
the instruments of delivering such a man
from the depths of affliction.  He mends
apace in his health, but I am afraid he will
never recover the use of his hand; though,
as it is not painful, it seems not to give him
any uneasiness.&mdash;
</p><p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 10.&mdash;I am infinitely charmed with
the conversation of this couple; for the
girl is very sensible, and prettily accomplished.
I wish she were married to some
honest man that knew her value; for I find

<pb n="232"/>
she has still terrors on Mr. Ware's account,
nor is her father without his apprehensions.
</p><p>He said to me to-day, if I were to die,
Madam, I would conjure you as my last
request to take my daughter into your service.
With such a pattern before her she
must be virtuous, and with such a protector
I am sure she would be safe.
</p><p>I told him he might rely on me, but that
I hoped he would live long enough to see
her happily disposed of in marriage.
</p><p>If I could see that day, said he, I should
then have no other worldly care to disturb
me.
</p><p>Here, my dearest Cecilia, I will close my
very long narrative.  The pacquet is already
swelled to an enormous size, but you never
think them too large.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 14.&mdash;After so many trifles, my
dear, as my journal for nearly a month past
contained, you will be glad of something a
little more serious.  I mentioned in my last
week's journal, that I had cast my eyes on a
young man, who I thought would make a
suitable match for Miss Price, if he were

<pb n="233"/>
approved of by her, and her father.  This
person is a linen-draper in the Strand, a
second brother of my Patty's.  You can't
have forgot Harry Main, my dear, whom
we both knew when a boy, remarkable for
his sober behaviour, modesty, and sweetness
of temper.  He is just now out of his time,
and his eldest brother has set him up in a
handsome shop.  You may be sure I am his
customer.  'Tis on this lad then that I have
turned my thoughts, as a fit husband for the
amiable girl.  I went yesterday morning to
buy some linen for Miss Price, and carried
her with me, as I had done once or twice
before.  After we had made our markets, I
told young Main, with a freedom which a
long acquaintance gave me, that I thought
he was so well settled, he wanted nothing
but a good wife to complete his happiness.
He replied, he should think himself very
happy if he could light on some good young
woman as a partner for life.  Why do you
not look out for one, said I?  They are not so
hard to be come at.  I believe, Madam, he
answered, I must get some one else to do it
for me, my friends laugh at me and say I

<pb n="234"/>
am too bashful to speak for myself; but I
fancy were I to meet with a person that
really touched my heart, I should make la
shift to find courage enough to tell her so.
</p><p>And have you never yet seen such a person,
said I?  He blushed, and by an involuntary
motion his eyes were turned on Miss
Price, of whom I concluded his sister Patty,
as she often visits him, had given him the
history.  He said if I commanded him to
tell his secret, I should know it another
time.
</p><p>This was enough; I asked in a jocose
way, would he take a wife of my chusing?
Sooner than of any body's in the world,
Madam, he replied.
</p><p>We took our leave, and I asked Patty
when I went home, whether she had ever
mentioned any thing about Miss Price to
her brother?  Poor Patty coloured for fear
she had committed a fault, but owned
directly she had told him every circumstance
of her story; her brother having been very
inquisitive about her, from the first time he
had seen her with me; and added, that she

<pb n="235"/>
believed he was down-right in love with
her.
</p><p>I told her if Miss Price liked her brother,
and her father did not disapprove of the match,
I saw no reason why they might not make
each other happy, as I should give Miss
Price a fortune worth the young man's acceptance.
</p><p>Patty said, she was sure her brother would
rejoice at the offer, and that she herself
could not wish him to make abetter
choice.
</p><p>It only remained now to know how the
young lady herself stood affected towards
him.  I put Patty (for whom Miss Price
had conceived a great affection) upon this
task.  I thought she would speak her mind
with less reserve to her, as I feared the
obligation she thought herself under to me,
might have such an influence on her gratitude,
as to prevent that freedom which I
wished her to use; for I was resolved not
to put the least shadow of constraint on her
inclinations.
</p><p>Patty succeeded so well, that, without
seeming to have any design in it, she drew

<pb n="236"/>
a confession from Miss Price very much in
her brother's favour.
</p><p>Being now sure that the young people
liked each other, I thought I might open
my design to the old gentleman, which I
did in a few words.  How the good man was
delighted with the happy prospect which
his deservedly-beloved daughter had before
her! he has left the affair intirely to me, so
that I hope to have the girl disposed of very
much to all our satisfaction.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 18.&mdash;I am charmed with Mr.
Warner's noble behaviour.  I claim an interest,
said he, in these honest creatures that
you have taken under your protection.  I
like the old fellow mightily, and admire the
little girl so much, that, if you had not provided
a better husband for her, I should
have been half tempted to have taken her
myself; but since it is as it is, we must do
handsomely by her.
</p><p>I told him I had enquired into the young
man's circumstances, and found that bout
a thousand pounds would set him forward
extremely well, and that this was the portion
I intended to give him with the young
gentlewoman.
</p><p>Well said he, I believe that will do; but
I must make the poor thing a present myself
for wedding-trinkets.  And the old
man too, must we not take care of him?
</p><p>Dear Sir, said I, how good you are?  You
would remind me of my duty, if I myself
were forgetful of it.  But I have already
settled a hundred pounds a year on him.
</p><p>Is that enough, said he? will it make the
good fellow easy?
</p><p>Oh, Sir, it exceeds his wishes; he intends
to live with his daughter, as his growing
infirmities require her tender care.
</p><p>Every thing is to be this day settled.
Mr. Price is exceedingly pleased with his
son-in-law elect; and the wedding will be
no longer delayed, than till Mr. Main receives
the answers to those letters which he
has wrote to his friends in the country, to
apprize them of his approaching marriage.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 26.&mdash;I am sure my dear Cecilia
will rejoice with her friend in the acquisition
she has received to her own happiness

<pb n="238"/>
by conferring so much on a worthy family.
The bride is this day gone home to her
own house; her delighted father with her.
Their prayers and blessings, poured out
from truly grateful and virtuous hearts,
remain with me.  A reward, my dear, and
a rich one too, for the self-satisfying part I
have acted.
</p><p>My worthy Patty, whose merit alone
raises her much above her station, I shall no
longer consider as my servant.  She has
been my friend in the tenderest and most
enlarged sense of the word, and she shall
continue so.  I have hired another maid to
wait on me, and with a sort of merry ceremony
enfranchised Patty on the day of her
brother's marriage; for I had her dressed
elegantly as bride's maid to her new sister,
and she sat on her right-hand at the wedding-dinner.  I look on her as my companion,
but I cannot persuade her to forget
that I was her mistress.  She shews this by
actions, not by words.
</p><p>[Here follows an interval of thirteen
months, in which nothing material to the
thread of the story occurs.  The journal

<pb n="239"/>
contains only a continued series of such
actions, as shewed the noble and pious use
which Mrs. Arnold made of the great fortune
which providence had blessed her with.
The rest is filled up with a variety of little
incidents, many of them relative to her brother
and his lady, to Mr. Warner, and several
letters from Lady V&mdash;, with whom she
constantly corresponded.  At the end of
that period the journal proceeds thus.]

</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 28.&mdash;And shall I really be so
blessed, my ever beloved Cecilia, as to see
you at the time you mention?  Oh, my
dear, after an absence of five long years, how
my heart bounds with joy at your approach!
The two months that are to intervene before
we meet will appear very tedious to me.
But it is always so with happiness that is
within our view.  Before I expected you,
though I regretted your absence, yet did I
patiently acquiesce under it, and could entertain
my thoughts with other objects; but I
am now, I cannot tell you how anxious and
impatient to see you.  And yet, my Cecilia,
we shall have nothing new to say to each

other, knowing as we both do every circumstance
of each other's life since we parted.
Mine has been a strange one; but my lot is
now fallen on a fair ground, where, I hope,
it will please heaven to continue me whilst
I am to remain in this world.  The noble,
I may almost call it, princely fortune that
my kinsman has settled on me, well enable
me to leave my children greatly provided
for, whenever it shall be God's pleasure to
call me away.  Let me but live to embrace
my Cecilia, and then, providence, thy will
be done!
</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 29.&mdash;Gracious God! for what am
I yet reserved?  My trembling hand can
scarce hold my pen, but I will try to tell you
the event which yesterday produced.
</p><p>I was but just set down to dinner; nobody
with me but Patty and my children.
A note was brought in to me, which, they
said, came by a porter, who waited for an
answer.  I opened and read it.  My eyes
were struck with the unlooked-for name of
Orlando Faulkland at the bottom; the contents
filled me with terror and surprize.  I

<pb n="241"/>
know not what I have done with the note,
but he informed me in it that he was just
arrived in town, and begged I would appoint
an hour that evening to see him alone, adding,
that his arrival was, and must be, a
secret to every body but me.
</p><p>Troubled and shocked as I was, I returned
for answer, by the same messenger, that
I should expect him at six o'clock.  I need
not tell you how I passed the interval 'till
that hour.  It was impossible for me, amidst
a thousand conjectures, to form one which
could probably occasion this amazing visit.
So strangely introduced! so unthought of!
and from one I imagined to be in another
kingdom.
</p><p>Precisely at six o'clock, I heard a coach
stop at the door; Patty was in the way to
receive him, and presently Mr. Faulkland
himself entered the drawing-room.  Distraction
was in his looks!  I rose to receive
him, but shook from head to foot; and I
felt the blood forsaking my face.  He ran
to me, as if with a design to salute me, but
started back without making the offer.  I
made a motion to a chair for him, and sat

<pb n="242"/>
down myself, for I was not able to stand.
You are wellcome to England, Sir, I am
glad to see you&mdash;scarce knowing what I
said.  I hope your lady is well?  He looked
wildly, as if in horror at the question.  Then
suddenly catching both my hands, he fell
on his knees before me, his eyes fixed
mournfully on my face, and it was some
time before he could answer.
</p><p>I could not speak; I burst into tears:&mdash;
there was something dreadful in his silence.
He kissed both my hands, but I withdrew
them from him.  Sir, Sir, speak I conjure
you.  You shock me to death!  I see I
have, said he, and I am afraid to proceed:
you will die at the relation.  For God's
sake, Sir, explain yourself.&mdash;
</p><p>You see a man, said he, whose life is forfeited
to the law.&mdash;My wife is dead&mdash;and
by my hand&mdash;.
</p><p>I don't know whether he said more, for I
fainted away.  It seems he did not call for
any help, but by his own endeavours at last
brought me to myself, and I found him
weeping bitterly over me.

<pb n="243"/>
</p><p>The sound of the last horrid words I had
heard him speak still rung in my ears.  I
begged him to explain them.
</p><p>That wife, said he, that woman whom
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> persuaded me to marry, I caught in
adultery, and I punished the villain that
wronged me with death.  She shared in his
fate, though without my intending it.  For this act of justice,
which the law will deem
murder, I myself must die, and I am come
but to take a last look.&mdash;What recompence
then can you make the man, whom you
have brought to misery, shame, and death?
</p><p>His looks, and the tone of voice with
which he spoke this, made my blood run
cold, and my heart die within me.
</p><p>I wrung my hands, and redoubling my
tears, I do not need your reproaches, said I,
to make me the most miserable woman on
earth&mdash;What recompence indeed <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I make
you&mdash;None, none, but to tell you that if
you will fly this instant, my fortune shall be
at your disposal, and I will take care to
supply you in what part soever of the world
you shall chuse for your residence.
</p><p>And can you after all that is past, said he,
persist in such barbarity as to drive me from
you? or are you determined to see me
perish here?  If that be so, I will soon rid
you of this miserable hated wretch.
</p><p>He drew his sword like a madman, and
with a dreadful imprecation, which made
me shudder, swore that if I did not that
minute, promise to bear him company in
his flight, he would plunge it into his
breast, and die before my eyes.&mdash;Good
God, what a scene of horror was this!  I
catched his arm, fell down on my knees,
and was more mad, if possible, than himself.
</p><p>I begged of him to put up his sword,
which he did, seeing me almost dead with
fear.  You know, said he, the means of
dying are always in my own power; take
care you do not trifle with me, or plead in
excuse for falsifying your promise, that you
made it to save me from immediate destruction.

<pb n="246"/>
</p><p>I beseeched him to calm himself a little,
and to permit me to send for my brother.
Sir George you know has an intire affection
for you, said I, you may trust him with
your life and safety.
</p><p>I had forgot him, said he; poor Bidulph!
he will be afflicted when he hears my story.
</p><p>I instantly wrote a line to my brother
requesting to see him immediately.  By
good fortune he was at home, and came to
me directly.
</p><p>In the mean time, as I saw Mr. Faulkland's
mind was exceedingly disturbed, I
endeavoured, by giving him an account of
my own situation, to divert his thoughts
from the trouble that preyed on them, for
I was apprehensive of his relapsing into the
same phrenzy that had so much terrified me,
if I touched on the cause, and therefore
chose to defer enquiring into the particulars
of his misfortune, till my brother should be
present.
</p><p>Sir George was equally astonished with
me at the sight of Mr. Faulkland; they
embraced tenderly; poor Mr. Faulkland
wept upon my brother's neck.  It was easy

<pb n="247"/>
to discover he laboured under some extraordinary
affliction.
</p><p>My brother looked at me as if for an explanation;
he seemed to guess at least part
of the fatal truth.  Are you come to England
alone, Faulkland, said he?  I prevented
the reply; he is alone, said I, he has a dreadful
story to relate to you.  Mrs. Faulkland
is dead.  I durst not ask the manner of her
death, till you were by, to calm the transports
of your friend.
</p><p>My heart forebodes, answered my brother,
addressing himself to Mr. Faulkland, that
the ungrateful woman you married has
betrayed you.  She did, replied Mr. Faulkland,
but I did not mean to stain my hands
with her blood, perfidious as she was; her
death be on her own head.
</p><p>Sir George looked astonished; that she is
dead I rejoice said he, but how, my dear
Faulkland, were you accessary to it?
</p><p>We were that instant interrupted.  Mr.
Warner passing by, called to ask me how
I did, and as my brother's chariot stood at
the door, I could not be denied to him,

<pb n="247"/>
though I had ordered that nobody should
be let in.
</p><p>I was called down to him, and indeed was
not sorry to have an excuse for absenting
myself a while, for my spirits were quite
overpowered.
</p><p>Mr. Warner quickly observed that something
extraordinary had happened, and as he
was already acquainted with the greatest
part of Mr. Faulkland's history, some particulars
relative to his wife excepted, I made
no scruple, relying on his prudence and
secrecy, of telling him the cause of my
present distress; in which he seemed to take
a friendly and even paternal share.
</p><p>When he was gone, I returned to the
room where I had left my brother and his
friend.  They both seemed in extreme agitation,
they were walking about.
</p><p>This is an unfortunate affair said my brother,
and may be attended with dreadful
consequences, if Faulkland does not shew
more regard to his own safety, than he
seems inclined to do.  I have been persuading
him to retire to a place which I can
provide for him, where he may lye concealed

<pb n="248"/>
for a day or two, till he is recovered from
the fatigue of his journey; for he has travelled
night and day for these three days
without sleeping.
</p><p>Sir George looked at me, and by a sorrowful
sign which he made, I apprehended he feared
his unhappy friend's head was disturbed.
</p><p>For heaven's sake, Sir, said I, be advised
by my brother, who loves you; suffer him
to conduct you to some place of security;
when you have had a little repose we will
both come to you, and concert such measures
as shall be best for your safety.
</p><p>He snatched my hand, Sir George is my
true friend, said he, take care that <hi rend="italic">you</hi> do
not deceive me.  I find myself giddy for
want of rest.  I am satisfied to be disposed
of for to-night how you please.  But give
me your word of honour that I shall see you
in the morning.
</p><p>You shall indeed, Sir, I replied.
</p><p>Depend upon it, answered Sir George,
I'll bring her to you myself.
</p><p>He looked irresolute, and as if he knew
not what to say; then turning to my brother,
and leaning on his shoulder, Do, dear

<pb n="249"/>
Bidulph, carry me to some place where I
may lie down, for my spirits can hold out no
longer.
</p><p>Come, said Sir George, taking him under
the arm, my chariot is at the door, I will
bring you to a house where you may be
quiet at home.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland rivetted his eyes on me,
as my brother led him out of the room, but
he did not speak.
</p><p>Sir George whispered me that he would
return again.  They went into the chariot
together and drove away.
</p><p>It was ten o'clock before my brother returned.
He told me he had lodged Mr.
Faulkland safely at a friend's house in whom
he could confide, as he did not think his
own, in case of a search, a place of security.
</p><p>He said he had seen him in bed, and hoped
a little sleep would compose his mind, which
seemed very much disturbed.  I requested
my brother to give me the particulars of
that terrible affair, which Mr. Faulkland
had mentioned.  Sir George related to me
what follows, though Mr. Faulkland, he
said, told the story but incoherently.

<pb n="250"/>
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland said he had no reason to be
displeased with his wife's conduct for more
than a year after their marriage; her affection
for him seemed lively and sincere; and
he had made her the most grateful returns, it
being the study of his life to render her
happy.  Her love abated not of its ardor,
and he had all the reason in the world to
imagine himself intirely possessed of her
heart.
</p><p>Whilst Mr. Faulkland's house in the
country was building, he had been invited
by a neighbouring gentleman, who lived at
the distance of about three miles from his
own place, to stay at his house; which
obliging offer Mr. Faulkland had readily
accepted, as by that means he had daily opportunities
of seeing, and expediting his own
improvements.
</p><p>Mr. Bond (that was the gentleman's
name) had a wife and two or three
daughters, all very agreeable women;
with whom Mrs. Faulkland had, by living
so much in their family, contracted a great
intimacy; but particularly with the eldest,
a sprightly fine young woman, of about

<pb n="251"/>
twenty years old.  They had been three or
four Months at Mr. Bond's; their house,
which was nothing more than a little lodge,
was finished; and they only waited till it
was thoroughly dry to remove into it, as
Mr. Faulkland had laid out extensive
gardens, in the finishing of which he proposed
to amuse himself some time; for he
acknowleged to my brother, he was in no
haste to return to England.
</p><p>During their residence with this gentleman,
they had made two or three excursions
to town.  On their return from one of
these, after an absence of about a fortnight,
they found a visitor at Mr. Bond's; his
name was Smyth; he was an officer, a genteel
handsome man, and they were given to
understand he made his addresses to the
eldest daughter; of whom he had been an
admirer a long time, but durst not make
his pretensions known to her father, till
having lately been promoted in the army
to the rank of major, the young lady's
parents admitted his visits to their daughter.
She had long before than acknowleged to
Mrs. Faulkland in confidence, her attachment

<pb n="252"/>
to him.  Mr. Faulkland, who had
learned this secret from his wife, was very
glad to find that Miss Bond, for whom he
had great esteem, was likely to have her
wishes accomplished, as he saw that Major
Smyth was treated with distinction by her
parents, who complimented him with a bed
at their house; for he generally staid two
or three nights with them, every time he
paid them a visit, as his regiment was then
quartered at a town about fifteen miles
distant from their house.
</p><p>The Major, without being a man of very
shining parts, had such talents as made him
acceptable to the women.  He sung prettily,
was lively to extravagance, full of agreeable
trifling, and always in good humour.
Miss Bond loved him; and as he was considered
in the light of a person who would
shortly be one of the family, Mr. Faulkland
soon contracted a friendship with him,
which the Major, on his part, seemed very
solicitous to improve.
</p><p>The marriage was now agreed on, and
was only deferred till the young lady's brother
should be at age, as he was to join with

<pb n="253"/>
his father in making a settlement on his
sister.  This desirable event was at the
distance of four months; but as the lover
was in the mean time permitted to enjoy so
much of his mistress's conversation, he
seemed to submit to the delay with patience.
</p><p>Things were in this situation, when Mr.
Faulkland, thinking it time to remove to
his own house, proposed it to his lady;
but she objected to it, declaring she did not
think it safe, as the house had been so lately
built.  Though indeed it was now perfectly
well seasoned; for the shell had been intirely
finished some time before Mr. Faulkland
had gone to Mr. Bond's house, and it
was only the inside work, and a kitchen
that was built apart from the lodge, that
wanted to be completed.  Mr. Faulkland
was unwilling to oppose his lady in any
thing; but he was the more solicitous that
she should comply with his request in this
particular, as he thought he had observed
that the eldest Miss Bond, had, of late, behaved
with more coldness towards her than
usual.  Though he was far from guessing

<pb n="254"/>
the cause of this, he thought it, however, a
sufficient reason for their removal.  He was
afraid they had already staid too long; and
that, perhaps, notwithstanding the good
nature and hospitality of the family, they all
now secretly wished their absence.  This,
though he intended to make a suitable return
for their friendly reception of him during
so long a time, made him resolve not to
continue there; and the more so, as Miss
Bond, who was present when he proposed
it to Mrs. Faulkland, seemed to wish for
their departure; as she dissented from that
lady with regard to her opinion of the state
of the new house, and seemed to think there
could no danger attend their immediate entrance
into it.  Mrs. Faulkland seemed nettled
at this, and immediately assented to her
husband's proposal; the next day they took
their leave of Mr. Bond's family, and repaired
to their own house.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland, from this period, remarked
a change in his wife's behaviour;
she grew melancholy and peevish; but as
she complained of not being well, he imputed
the alteration in her temper to that

<pb n="255"/>
alone; and the more so, as she did not abate
in the tokens of her seeming affection for
him.
</p><p>Mr. Bond's family frequently visited
them; Major Smyth always made one of
the party, and often came without them.
Though they lived but at the distance of
three miles from each other, yet as the road
for carriages between the two houses, being
a-cross one, was very bad, the ladies were
often prevailed on, if they staid late, to lye
a night at Mr. Faulkland's, and in consequence
of this, Mr. Bond and the Major
had frequently done the same when they
were of the party.
</p><p>Though Mr. Faulkland was far from
having any injurious suspicion of his wife,
yet he could not help observing that all her
complaints vanished, whenever this family
were at her house.  This, however, he
ascribed to nothing more than her being
fond of the company, though he thought
a coolness between her, and the eldest Miss
Bond, was full apparent.  The principals
of the family, however, behaved with their
usual frankness and good-humour, and Mr.

<pb n="256"/>
Faulkland thought there might be some
little female pique between the two ladies,
which was not worth enquiring
into.
</p><p>As they punctually returned the friendly
visits of these agreeable neighbours, Mrs.
Faulkland always proposed passing the night
there, to induce them, as she said, to use
the same obliging freedom at her house.
Mr. Faulkland, on those occasions observed,
that his lady always rose much earlier than
usual, but unsuspecting as he was, he was
satisfied with the reason she assigned for it,
that of enjoying the pleasant hours of the
morning in a very delicious garden; a
pleasure which they could not have at home,
as Mr. Faulkland's improvements were
only in their infancy.
</p><p>The usual intercourse between the two
families was thus carried on for more than
three months, when the time drew near,
that Miss Bond and her lover were to be
united, and every thing was preparing for
the purpose.  The young Mr. Bond was
come home from the college, and the house
on this occasion was more chearful than

<pb n="257"/>
ever.  Mr. Faulkland and his lady were
there at a ball one night, when the latter,
after dancing a long time, complained suddenly
of being violently ill, and either really
did, or pretended to, faint.  She was immediately
conveyed to bed, and, at her request,
another room prepared for Mr.
Faulkland.  He, extremely alarmed at her
indisposition, came to her bed-side, purposing
to sit up by her the whole night;
the youngest of the miss Bond's offering to
do the same, but Mrs. Faulkland absolutely
refused them both, and about midnight,
saying she found herself inclined to sleep,
insisted on their retiring; nor would she
admit a servant to stay in the room, but
contented herself with having a candle
burning on the hearth.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland, who really had an affection
for his lady, was impatient the next
morning to enquire after her health; he
found her in bed, the complaints of the
preceding night all renewed.
</p><p>The family were extremely disconcerted
at this unlucky accident, and expressed the
utmost uneasiness, all but the eldest Miss

<pb n="258"/>
Bond, who was silent; and heard her mother
and sisters condoling with Mr. Faulkland,
not only with unconcern, but a suppressed
smile of contempt, which did not
escape Mr. Faulkland's observation.  He
now began to resent such a behaviour,
which he thought very unkind; and told
his lady he wished she was in a condition to
be removed, as he was fearful in her present
situation it might be very inconvenient to the
family to have her remain sick in their house;
especially as it quite broke in on the mirth
and festivity which were now going forward.
</p><p>To this she replied, that she found herself
so very weak and dispirited, which she
said was always the consequence of those
faintings, to which she had been subject
from her childhood, that she could not
think of leaving her room.  She made a
shift, however, to rise, and said she hoped
in a day or two to be able to remove.
</p><p>Mrs. Bond, who was of an extremely humane
and tender disposition, begged of her
not to think of stirring till she found her
health perfectly re-established: Mrs. Faulkland
thankfully accepted her offer, and Mr.

<pb n="295"/>
Faulkland, though reluctantly, was obliged
to acquiesce.
</p><p>They remained thus two days longer,
Mrs. Faulkland's complaints still furnishing
her with a pretence for sleeping alone; and,
under colour of not giving trouble in the
family, she would not suffer a maid to sit
up with her.
</p><p>Major Smyth, who had been in the house
all this time, had now some call to his regiment,
which obliged him to go to the town
where it lay, and Mr. Faulkland heard him
give his man directions for their journey.
</p><p>Mrs. Faulkland still kept her room, and
had not left it since the time she was first
taken ill.  It happened that the chamber
which was assigned for Mr. Faulkland, immediately
joined his lady's, and was only
separated from it by a wainscot partition, by
which means he could hear the least stir in
her chamber.
</p><p>The unsuspecting injured husband, whose
anxiety for his faithless wife had always
made him watchful and attentive to her
motions, happened this night to be more
than ordinarily so.  The family had now

<pb n="260"/>
been for some hours buried in sleep; every
thing was profoundly silent for some time.
Mr. Faulkland, who hoped his lady was
settled to rest, was endeavouring to compose
himself to sleep, when he heard her stir.
This immediately roused him, and raising
his head off the pillow, he found she got
out of bed.  Though she seemed to use the
utmost precaution, he nevertheless heard her
very distinctly open her door, and go out.
Surprized as he was at this motion, no
other thought occurred to him, than that
perhaps Mrs. Faulkland, finding herself ill,
had got up to call some of the female servants.
Prepossessed with this belief, he started
out of bed, and hastily slipping on his
cloaths, ran into his lady's room, where he
found her candle still burning.
</p><p>As he concluded she would presently return,
he waited some minutes in her chamber;
at length, perceiving her cloaths lying
on a chair at her bed-side, he was afraid she
had gone out without putting any thing on
her, and though the night was not cold, he
was apprehensive, that in her apparently

<pb n="261"/>
weak condition, her health might be farther
injured.
</p><p>On this account, he determined to go in
quest of her; and concluding she had gone
to the apartment of the female servants,
which was on the floor over that on which
they lay, he ascended the stairs as silently as
possible.
</p><p>As he was passing by a room on the top
of the first flight, he heard some one speak
in a low voice, and listening, fancied it was
his wife's.
</p><p>As he knew not who lay in the room, he
made no doubt but that it was she, who was
calling the person that slept there; and,
without farther reflection, hastily opened
the door, and went in, with the candle,
which he had taken, in his hand.  On his
sudden entrance, the person, who was in
bed, eagerly called out, Who is there?
He soon perceived by his voice, that it
was Major Smyth.  He was about to make
an apology for his intrusion, when perceiving
his lady's wrapping gown, which
he had seen her wear that morning, lying

<pb n="262"/>
on the floor, and in the same instant recollecting
that he had heard a woman's voice
when he was without-side the door, the horror
of her guilt rushed upon him at once,
and without making any answer to the major,
he suddenly drew back the feet curtains
of the bed, where he plainly perceived that
the major had a companion, though she had
hid her head under the cloaths.
</p><p>The major instantly leapt out of bed, and
though he saw Mr. Faulkland was unarmed,
he snatched up one of his own pistols,
which lay on the table, and which his man
had charged that night, as they were to go
a short journey the next morning.  Mr.
Faulkland, in the first transports of his rage,
seized the other; the miserable woman, observing
their fatal motions, threw herself
out of bed.  Mr. Faulkland was too much
distracted to be able to give a distinct account
of this dreadful incident; all he can
say is, that Major Smyth snapped his pistol
at him, which, he thinks, missed fire, and
he instantly discharged his with more fatal
success; for Mrs. Faulkland, who had in the
instant rushed between them, shrieked out,

<pb n="263"/>
and dropped on the ground; and the major,
reeling a few steps, fell against one of the
pillars of the bed, and cried out, He has
killed us both.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland says, that, after this dreadful
action, without knowing what he did,
he ran down stairs, and opening the front
door, ;made the best of his way home on
foot.  The phrenzy of his mind was such
that he thought not of providing for his
safety; but having got into his house, he
had no intention of going farther, when, in
less than a quarter of an hour, one of his
servants, whom he had left behind him at
Mr. Bond's, a faithful fellow, who had lived
with him many years came to him, scared
and breathless, having ran himself almost
dead to overtake his master.
</p><p>Oh, Sir, said he, for heaven's sake, get
away as fast as you can: Mr. Bond's family
are all in an uproar; you will be taken, if
you do not make your escape this instant.
</p><p>Have I killed any body? demanded Mr.
Faulkland.
</p><p>Oh, Sir, answered the man, you have
killed my lady, and Major Smyth is mortally
wounded.

<pb n="264"/>
</p><p>I know not what I did, cried Mr. Faulkland,
but I did not mean to hurt your mistress.
</p><p>I believe it, Sir, replied the servant, but
I fear nobody else will, for that wicked
wretch, though they think he cannot live
many hours, would take away your life if
he could.  The report of the pistol alarmed
the family, and we all ran into his room,
gentry and servants and all; the major was
able to speak, but my lady was quite dead.
</p><p>The account he gives is, that my lady's
candle having one out, she got up to get
it lighted, and was endeavouring to find one
of the maid's rooms, when passing by his,
and seeing a light, for he was but just got
into bed, she stepped in; and before she had
time to retire again, you rushed in like a
madman; and seeing his pistols lye on the
table, you snatched them both up, and discharging
one at your lady, which killed her
on the spot, you fired the other at him,
while he was leaping out of bed.  I am
sure, Sir, this is a false story, yet, as the family
may all believe it, I beg you, on my
knees, to provide for your safety.  Miss

<pb n="265"/>
Bond was tearing her hair for her lover;
but I heard her say, she was glad that
wicked woman (meaning my lady) had lost
her life.
</p><p>They had sent off some of the people
for a surgeon, and I ran as fast as I could to
warn you of your danger.
</p><p>This honest fellow, not contented with
urging his master, soon saddled a very swift
hunter, which he had in the stable; and
Mr. Faulkland, now convinced of the necessity
of flying, mounted it directly, and,
attended only by one groom, galloped off
to Dublin, which he reached by seven
o'clock in the morning, and was lucky
enough to arrive just as a packet, which
was going off with an express was ready to
sail.  He went on board, and landed at
Holly-head in twelve hours, from thence,
without stopping night or day, except to
change horses, he rode post to London, and
presented himself, in the manner I have already
told you, before me.
</p><p>Such, my Cecilia, are the dismal particulars
of this sad story.  My brother staid

<pb n="266"/>
with me 'till it was very late; our time was
past in consulting on measures for Mr.
Faulkland's preservation.  He said, he
would advise him, by all means, to get over
to Holland as fast as he could; for if that
story, which the execrable Smyth had invented,
should be believed, and it was very
likely to gain credit in case he died of his
wound, and persevered in it to the last, Mr.
Faulkland, having no witness to disprove
any part of the charge, would be in imminent
danger of losing his life.
</p><p>I need not describe to you the horrour in
which I passed last night.  I rose this morning
at day-light, and was but just dressed,
when I was informed Mr. Warner wanted
to speak to me.  I went down stairs to him
directly.
</p><p>I could not sleep all night for thinking of
your affairs, said he, without any previous
salute; and I am so impatient to hear Faulkland's
story, that I could not rest 'till I
came to you to be informed of it, for I
suppose you heard every thing last night.
</p><p>I related all the particulars minutely as I
have done to you, Mr. Warner never once

<pb n="267"/>
interrupting me.  When I had ended the
story, what do you intend for Faulkland,
said my kinsman?  I know not what to do,
Sir, I replied; but this I am sure of, that if
it were in the power of wealth to relieve his
afflicted mind, he has an undoubted right to
a large portion of the fortune I possess;
this I think myself bound to bestow on the
man, who, when I was destitute, offered me
his.  If we can prevail on him to take care
of his own safety, which, when he is a little
more collected, I hope we shall be able to do,
I must entreat your assistance, Sir, in helping
me to make him as easy as his unhappy circumstances
will admit of.&mdash;And is this <hi rend="italic">all</hi>,
demanded Mr. Warner sternly?  Does not
your gratitude suggest a warmer recompence
than giving him a paltry income?
</p><p>I was startled at the question, and not replying
immediately, You must marry him,
said he in a peremptory tone; there is nothing
now to hinder you; the heavy misfortune
which has fallen upon him, puts it
in your power to make him such a return as
his prosperous days would not have allowed
you.  You can confer an obligation on him

<pb n="268"/>
now; so <hi rend="italic">that</hi> scruple is rubbed out.  As for
any former idle aspersions, you have already
done more than enough to convince the
world they were without foundation.  I
could wish indeed that Jezebel of a wife had
been cut off in the common way; but since
he was guiltless in his intentions, it would
be barbarous to make <hi rend="italic">that</hi> an objection, and
I dare answer for it, all mankind will acquit
him, though the law perhaps may not,
of that scoundrel's death, who so well deserved
it at his hands.
</p><p>I told Mr. Warner, that though Mr.
Faulkland had proposed something like
this, I was sure it was owing to his distracted
mind, for that he had at first declared
he only came to take a last look at me, and
that I hoped, when he came to the cool use
of his reason, he would be far from urging
such a request&mdash;The more are you bound
then, said he, interrupting me, to deal generously
by him&mdash;What does your brother
say upon the subject?  He has not touched
upon it, I replied, I was so taken up with
hearing Mr. Faulkland's melancholy story
from my brother, that I mentioned not to

<pb n="269"/>
him his wild proposal; and as Sir George
told me Mr. Faulkland was much more
composed when he left him to his rest, I
presume he hinted nothing of that kind to
my brother.
</p><p>Ay, ay, cried Mr. Warner, Sir George
to be sure will change his note.  Faulkland
is now a fallen man, therefore depend upon
it he will not be for your marrying him;
but for this very reason, I insist on your
doing a noble thing.  If you have a grain of
honour, or of gratitude in you, you will
not hesitate a moment.  I will not desire
you, continued he, finding me silent, to carry
your gratitude so far as to marry a mad-man, if he should prove so; but if on your
visit to him this morning, you find him
composed, and in his right mind, make
him a frank offer of your hand, and see you
do it handsomely; consult not George, upon
the subject, I will have it all <hi rend="italic">my</hi> doing.
Go, added he, if I did not know that at the
bottom of your heart you <hi rend="italic">love</hi> Faulkland, I
would not make this a point with you; but
notwithstanding all your pretended demurs
I am sure that is the case.

<pb n="270"/>
</p><p>I should be disingenuous to deny it,
answered I; far from doing so, I will own
that I should prefer him before all the world,
if the strangeness of his present situation did
not frighten me.  Trouble not your head
about that, cried Mr. Warner, if the man
is in his senses, do as I bid you, and take
care that you acquit yourself with honour.
</p><p>He left me without waiting for a reply.
What can I say or do, my Cecilia?  My
heart and my reason are at variance.  What
a strange dilemma am I driven to? nobody
to advise me.  Mr. Warner, precipitate
and fanciful in his determinations,
urges me on to a I know not what.  Marry
Mr. Faulkland! receive a hand stained
with&mdash;Oh the very thought is terrible!
</p><p>What would the world say to such an
union?  It cannot be.  He will not sure
when he comes to the use of his cooler reason
insist upon a promise, which my own terrour,
and his desperation, extorted from
me.
</p><p>I must try to convince Mr. Warner's
judgment?  I hope he will not obstinately
persist in pressing me to what I dare not

<pb n="271"/>
comply with . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . . . My Brother is just come to
carry me to Mr. Faulkland.  Heaven grant
I may find him restored to his right
mind! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . Just returned from my visit to Mr.
Faulkland.  What a scene!  He wrung my
very heart.  I would I had never seen
him.
</p><p>We found him up, and walking about
his room; his looks much more composed
than they were last night.
</p><p>On our entering his chamber, his eyes
sparkled with pleasure.  He ran to my brother,
and embraced him.  Thank you my
dear, dear Bidulph, said he, you at length
give her to me, and with her own consent
too.  My bride! turning passionately to
me, and snatching my hand.
</p><p>My brother seemed shocked, and cast his
eyes mournfully at me: mine moistened,
and I was obliged to apply my handkerchief
to them, turning my head away.
</p><p>Tears! cried Mr. Faulkland, in a tone
of surprize, and on our wedding-day!  I
could not bear this, I sobbed aloud.  My

<pb n="272"/>
brother was willing, if possible, to give his
thoughts another turn, for not knowing
what had passed the day before, he thought
this was some sudden start of phrenzy.
</p><p>My dear Faulkland, said he, you affect
my sister too much; we have been consulting
for your safety, and came to talk with
you upon it.
</p><p>I think there is no time to be lost, and
that you ought immediately to retire into
Holland.
</p><p>I am ready, replied Mr. Faulkland, but
Mrs. Arnold goes with me, I have her
promise for it.
</p><p>Sidney shall follow you, answered my
brother, making a motion to me to shew he
would have me humour him in his ravings.
I will not go without her, cried Mr. Faulkland;
the universe shall not now part us.
</p><p>I was almost distracted with apprehension,
and knew not what reply to make;
my brother looked confounded, and was
silent.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland approached me, and with
a look of gloomy despair, You are both
mute, said he; Bidulph, I always thought

<pb n="273"/>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> loved me.  Mrs. Arnold I hoped did
not wish my death; but I am deceived in
you both&mdash;I have no farther business with
life&mdash;The friend I most confided in betrays
me; the woman whom my soul worships,
and to whom I sacrificed all my hopes of
happiness, repays me with ingratitude.
Why should such a wretch any longer submit
to life?  I have borne it too long already;
but there's my remedy, pointing
furiously to his sword, which lay in the
scabbard on a table.
</p><p>I could no longer contain myself, but
bursting into tears, Oh, Sir, said I, accuse
me not of ingratitude; I would not heaven
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> death could repair the heavy afflictions I
have brought upon you; if it could, I
would welcome it this hour.  Your reproaches,
cruel as they are, I forgive.  I
own myself the unhappy cause of all your
misfortunes; we have been mutually fatal
to each other.  You know I always valued
and esteemed you, and have in your calamity
already been sufficiently punished for
the share I have had in bring it on you.
What shall I say to you, Sir?  My whole

<pb n="274"/>
fortune I think too small, too poor a recompence,
to the man who had obliged me
beyond a possibility of return.  Yet what
have I to offer more?  Can you, Sir, can
you urge me to a marriage at so strange a
juncture?  Think how it will expose us both
to censure.  You long attachment to me
has not been a secret.  Think what dreadful
constructions may be put on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> conduct,
nay, on <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, should a union now
take place, brought about, as it must appear,
by so terrible an event.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland was silent, his eyes fixed
on the ground.  My brother took up the
argument.  Indeed, my dear Faulkland,
my sister has reason for her fears.  You
know I ever was your sincere friend; you
know too I always was of opinion that
Sidney ought to have been your wife; her
former objections I thought were romantic
scruples, and hardly forgave her refusing
you.  The present obstacle has more weight
in it&mdash;Do not mistake me, added he hastily
(seeing Mr. Faulkland raise his eyes full of
resentment at him) I wish my sister still to
be yours, and will consent to your marriage

<pb n="275"/>
with my whole heart; but let me conjure
you to take a more favourable juncture:
withdraw yourself but for the present;
your affairs may not be so desperate as you
imagine.  If that villain Smyth should
chance to recover, perhaps his conscience
may awaken remorse, and he may be prevailed
on to do you justice.  In that case
you must be cleared from the most distant
imputation of what my sister hinted at, and
what has but too justly alarmed her.  Cleared
as your character will then be, and conscious
as we both are of the innocence of
your intentions, there will remain no bar to
Mrs. Arnold's giving you her hand.
</p><p>Smyth <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> recover, interrupted Mr.
Faulkland, suddenly&mdash;there is no hope can
spring from that.  Then answered my brother,
at worst you can but live abroad; all
parts of the world are alike to such a philosopher
as my sister is; and probably, circumstanced
as your marriage will appear, she
may like best to reside out of England.&mdash;
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland shook his head, and with
a smile of indignation, Leave me, Bidulph,
cried he, I cannot bear <hi rend="italic">your</hi> attempting to

<pb n="276"/>
deceive me.  You think me mad, and
are cruel enough to endeavour at imposing
on me&mdash;I know my mind is disturbed&mdash;
but who has driven me to despair! to madness!
to death! and he cast a look at me
that chilled my blood.
</p><p>Be satisfied, Madam, you shall soon be
rid of this fatal&mdash;hated&mdash;betrayed&mdash;abandoned
wretch! he spoke this with his hands
grasped eagerly together, and his eyes lifted
up to heaven.  Then striking his breast, he
burst into tears, and rushing suddenly into
his closet, he shut the door violently, locking
it on the inside.
</p><p>He wept aloud, and his agonies reduced
me almost to the same condition with himself.
</p><p>I begged my brother would endeavour
to prevail on him to open the door, for I
was fearful of his making some dreadful attempt
upon his own life; but Sir George a
little quieted my fears, by shewing me his
sword, which still lay on the table, and
which, at my desire, he put out of the way.
</p><p>My brother approached the closet door,
and in the most soothing language beseeched

<pb n="277"/>
him to open it; but he could get no other
answer from Mr. Faulkland than to beg he
would leave him to himself.
</p><p>I found this was not a time for arguing.
I told my brother, we had better suffer him
to vent his passion alone, and that, perhaps,
when he had time to reflect a little on what
had been said, he would permit his cooler
reason to govern him.
</p><p>Sir George was very unwilling to leave
him in such a distracted state of mind; he
renewed his efforts to persuade him to come
out of the closet, but to no purpose.
</p><p>I beseech you to leave me, Sir George,
said he, I am not in a condition to talk&mdash;
I cannot bear the sight of Mrs. Arnold&mdash;
let me recover myself&mdash;another time perhaps
I may be better able to discourse with
you.
</p><p>Will you promise me then, replied my
brother, that you will in the interim do nothing
that may be injurious to your life or
health?  Indeed, my dear Faulkland, you
distress my sister and me more than you
can imagine.  Name the hour when you
will permit me to come to you again; and

<pb n="278"/>
for heaven's sake think of your own immediate
preservation:  <hi rend="italic">that</hi> once secured, there
is nothing which my sister and I will not afterwards
do to make you happy&mdash;Can I
rely on you, Faulkland? do you promise
me not to be rash?  You have my sword in
your possession, answered Mr. Faulkland,
(still speaking within the closet) I have no
other weapon about me&mdash;leave me, Sir
George&mdash;I cannot talk.
</p><p>Say but that you wish to see me again,
replied my brother, and I will go, and give
you no further trouble.  Mr. Faulkland
sighed deeply.  Say, I wish to see you! he
repeated, ah, Bidulph! and his voice seemed
choaked.  My brother could not refrain
from tears.  I will come to you in the evening,
Faulkland&mdash;You will find me your
true friend.&mdash;I should be loath to lay you
under any restraint here, in the house of my
friend; do but say there is no need of it.
Promise me&mdash;the slightest word will suffice.
I know my dear Faulkland will not break
his word.
</p><p>Well&mdash;I will not attempt my life, cried
he impatiently, let that satisfy you&mdash;leave

<pb n="279"/>
me, and let me not be exposed to any insults
here.
</p><p>I leave you, answered my brother, and
hope to find you ;more composed a few
hours hence.  Mrs. Arnold too begs you
will be calm, and think of preserving a life
which is so dear to us both.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland was silent, and my brother
and I withdrew; he thought it best I
should not speak to him.
</p><p>Sir George left me at home, and said he
would call again on Mr. Faulkland in the
afternoon, and bring me word how he
should find him.  My brother is exceedingly
affected with his situation, and says he
knows not what to advise.  He is fearful
that Mr. Faulkland's phrenzy is not to be
calmed, but by consenting to marry him,
and circumstanced as he now is, that
thought is terrible.  Yet, if I persist in my
refusal, I drive the noblest of minds to desparation.
Oh, my Cecilia, is this the return
I ought to make to the most generous
of men? whose fervent love for me has
been a constant source of torment to him for
so many years!  Yet how can I yield him

<pb n="280"/>
my hand?  All my former scruples, weighty
as they appeared to me, were light to the
dreadful bar that now interposes.
</p><p>Had that ill-fated woman died the common
way, with what joy, what exultation
could I have rewarded his honest persevering
love! all my duties fulfilled, obedience
to my mother, justice to the woman I
thought injured, reverence to the memory
of my husband, the respect due to my own
character.  Should I not, my Cecilia, after
thus being acquitted of all other obligations,
have been to blame, if, after a series of misfortunes,
all brought on by my strict adherence
to those duties; should I not have
been to blame for refusing at length to do
justice to the most deserving of men?  When
I reflect on the past, when I survey the present,
and my foreboding heart whispers to
me the future sufferings of our dear unhappy
Mr. Faulkland, all my philosophy forsakes
me.  I have borne up under my own
sorrows&mdash;his quite subdue me&mdash;I must lay
by my pen&mdash;my eyes are brimful of tears
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Ah, my dear, what
will become of us?  I am almost dead with apprehension.

<pb n="281"/>
Rash, rash, unhappy Mr.
Faulkland!  He has fled from the house
where my brother had concealed him: I
know not what I am writing, my fears distract
me.  'Tis but two hours since we left
him, Sir George relying on his promise,
and unwilling to provoke him by any appearance
of constraint, gave no caution to
the gentleman with whom he was lodged to
observe his motions; he is ready to kill himself
for this neglect; but relying on Mr.
Faulkland's promise not to make any attempt
on his life, he suspected not that he
would endeavour to escape.  Escape do I
call it? rather let me say, to throw himself
into certain destruction.&mdash;He is set out
on his way for Ireland.  Heaven knows
what will be the consequence of this, if my
brother does not overtake and persuade him
back.  He is gone after him, my cousin
Warner with him; both rode post.
</p><p>My thoughts are so confused, I can put
nothing in order.  It seems we had not
long quitted him, when he called in his
servant (that groom who, as I informed
you, had come over with him) and telling

<pb n="282"/>
him he was going out of town, ordered
him to go directly to an inn somewhere in
the city, and hire two post-horses, and that
he would follow him presently.
</p><p>The man obeyed, and in about half an
hour, his master came in a hackney-coach to
the place where he had directed him to wait
for him.
</p><p>Upon the inn-keeper's enquiring whither
the horses were to go, Mr. Faulkland replied,
to St. Alban's.  The man objected
to the length of the stage, and named Barnet.
Mr. Faulkland seemed impatient and
angry; his unusual earnestness, his wild
looks, and the road he purposed taking, alarmed
his servant (a discreet elderly man)
and he had the prudence immediately to
dispatch the master of the house, whom he
prevailed on by a piece of money, to go directly
to my brother with this intelligence.
</p><p>He had the precaution not to mention
his master's name, only bade him find out
Sir George Bidulph, and tell him that his
friend was set out for St. Alban's, and that
his man had dispatched him with the news,
and would, if possible, endeavour to detain

<pb n="283"/>
him on the road, that Sir George might
overtake him.
</p><p>The man was punctual in delivering his
message.  My brother, wild with amazement
and horror, just called as he past my
door, to tell me this new and unexpected
misfortune.  Mr. Warner had that instant
come to enquire what had past between Mr.
Faulkland and me in our interview this
morning.  I had no time to tell him anything.
He looked very much displeased at
my brother and me, upon hearing Mr.
Faulkland was gone; but said he would
accompany Sir George, and they both hurried
away together.
</p><p>The man said, Mr. Faulkland had set off
before he could leave his house, the servant
having scarce time to give him the
message.
</p><p>I fear it will be impossible for my brother
to overtake him&mdash;He will be lost for ever
&mdash;what then will be my portion?  Happy
had it been for me indeed, as my dear mother
once said in the bitterness of her heart,
that I had died in my cradle!

<pb n="284"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Tuesday-night twelve o'clock</hi>.
</p><p>Heaven be praised, they are returned!
<hi rend="italic">All</hi> returned; Mr. Faulkland has been prevailed
on to come back, Mr. Warner has
prevailed on him.  He has saved his life;
but, my Cecilia, thy friend's temporal
happiness, and peace of mind, is the only
price that could ransom this desperate self-devoted victim!
</p><p>Mr. Warner has bound himself by a
solemn oath that I should become his wife,
or Mr. Faulkland, determined on his own
destruction, would, spite of all they could
do, have pursued his fatal journey to Ireland,
in order to deliver himself up to
justice.
</p><p>It was near ten o'clock before they returned
to town.  My brother carried Mr.
Faulkland back to the gentleman's house,
where he was before lodged; and my kinsman
left them together, in order to come
and give me an account of what passed.
</p><p>He said the gentleman, at whose house
he was lodged by my brother, was extreamly
surprized at seeing him again, Mr.
Faulkland having with great composure taken

<pb n="285"/>
his leave of him in the morning; and
after thanking him for the shelter he had
afforded him, told him he was going out of
town.
</p><p>My brother and my kinsman overtook
him above a mile on this side St. Alban's,
for which success they were intirely indebted
to the prudence of the servant who attended
him: For the poor man, finding
him pushing on with the utmost eagerness,
and Mr. Faulkland no longer making a secret
of his intention of returning to Ireland,
resolved at all events to prevent his ruin;
and hoping that by a little delay, Sir George
might overtake them, contrived at their first
stage so dexterously to slip a nail in between
the horse's shoe and his hoof, that he knew
he could not go far without being lame.
</p><p>This succeeded so well, that the poor animal
was soon disabled, and Mr. Faulkland
not having it in his power to mount himself
better, was obliged to go on at a very
easy rate, 'till they arrived at the next stage.
</p><p>Mr. Warner and my brother overtook
him in this situation: Sir George knew him
as soon as they came in sight of him, and

<pb n="286"/>
followed him at a proper distance, still
keeping him in view, 'till he lighted at the
post-house.  They then at once entered the
room, into which he had retired, whilst fresh
horses were getting ready.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland started at the sight of my
brother; he looked earnestly at Mr. Warner,
whom he had never seen before; but
spoke not to either of them.
</p><p>Sir George, pursued my kinsman, accosted
him affectionately:  Dear Faulkland, was
this kind of you, thus to fly from your
friends that love you?  He presented me
to him at the same time, naming me as his
relation.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland grasped the hand, which
I reached out in salutation to him; he fixed
his fine sparkling eyes on my face: Is it
Mr. Warner whom I have the honour to
salute?  Sir, I am no stranger to your worth:
I honour, I revere you.  You are too good
to interest yourself thus for an unhappy
wretch, cast off, and forsaken by all the
world.
</p><p>Do I forsake you, Faulkland, cried your
brother, kindly enough?  No, Faulkland,

<pb n="287"/>
I am your constant sincere friend, and will
prove myself so, if you will but let me.
Mr. Faulkland made no reply.
</p><p>Dear Faulkland, am I not your friend?
You are Mrs. Arnold's brother.&mdash;You are
not the man you were.  Indeed, Faulkland,
I am; I am your true friend; suffer me to
be so, come back with me; Mr. Warner
and I have followed you, in the hope of
prevailing on you to return with us; do,
Faulkland, let us persuade you to preserve
a life so dear to us all.
</p><p>What am I to live for, answered Mr.
Faulkland sternly?  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> have tried to deceive
me; the man I loved most, now I
am fallen, rejects me.  Your sister persists in
her obstinate cruelty towards me; she breaks
her promise, and you encourage her in it.  I
have neither friends, fortune, or country!
and do you talk to me of life on <hi rend="italic">such</hi> conditions?
No, Bidulph, it is a burden of
which I will rid myself.&mdash;Mr. Warner,
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> are a generous man, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> have an enlarged
mind; may a stranger ask a favour
of you?

<pb n="288"/>
</p><p>I could have wept, continued my kinsman,
to see such a frank noble fellow driven
to such desperation. j Command me, Sir, I
replied, there is nothing I would not do to
serve you.
</p><p>I thank you, Sir; I have a little son;
let me recommend the unhappy orphan to
your protection.  He will soon want a father:
will you be one to him, Sir?  I will
send him over to you; he laid hold of my
hand, and repeated his question, Will you
Mr. Warner?  <hi rend="italic">You</hi> have an enlarged mind,
and do not despise the unfortunate.
</p><p>I cried downright; he touched me to the
very quick.  I never was so affected in my
life; and I own I was heartily displeased
both with you and your brother, for driving
him to such extremities: <hi rend="italic">You</hi> especially,
on whom I laid injunctions to act in a
contrary way.  As for Sir George, I am
not surprized at <hi rend="italic">his</hi> behaviour.
</p><p>From Mr. Faulkland's discourse, proceeded
my kinsman, it was apparent to me,
that his distraction proceeded from no other
cause, than his belief that you and your brother
slighted him in his misfortunes.  It

<pb n="289"/>
was plain when he fled to England, that
he was sufficiently in his senses to be anxious
for his own safety; and though the sight of
you, joined to the hurry of his spirits, his
fatigue, and want of sleep, might, in a man
of such violent passions, have created a
temporary phrenzy, yet I am very certain
it would all have subsided, if you had behaved
to him as you ought to have done,
and as I desired you would: nor do I see
how you can answer it to yourself, after the
miseries you have already brought on such
a glorious man (for I never saw his equal
either in mind or person) to persist in a behaviour
which has already turned his brain,
and must in the end occasion his death: for
death he is determined on, if you refuse to
become his wife.
</p><p>Oh, Sir, cried I, leave him not to himself,
I conjure you; you see the influence
you have over his mind; you have done
wonders in bringing him back.&mdash;
</p><p>Hold, replied Mr. Warner, till I inform
you of the means I was obliged to use.
</p><p>I have told you how I was affected with
his situation, and the request he made me to

<pb n="290"/>
take care of his child.  This was not the
suggestion of madness; it was plain to me,
that if the cause were removed, he would
soon be restored to the perfect use of his reason,
and I could not bear to see the desolation
of such a noble frame, and all charged
to your account.
</p><p>Sir, I hope you do not mean, said I, to
return to Ireland, do you not know the
risque that you run by putting yourself into
the power of an exasperated family from
whom you can expect nothing but the most
malevolent persecution?
</p><p>I deliver myself up to the laws, replied
Mr. Faulkland; my life is devoted, 'tis indifferent
to me how I die.
</p><p>Suppose, said I, Mrs. Arnold should consent
to marry you, would not that reconcile
you to life?
</p><p>Oh, Sir, and he shook his head, I am
not to be deceived <hi rend="italic">twice</hi>.  (Your brother
walked about the room without taking part
in the conversation.)
</p><p>I do not mean it, Sir, Mrs. Arnold must
be yours; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can influence her; do but return
back with me, I give you my honour

<pb n="291"/>
I will do my utmost to prevail on her to
give you her hand immediately.  Her
heart is hardened, Sir, she will cont consent,
replied he.  I have no friend to urge her, I
am an outcast, and not fit to live&mdash;<hi rend="italic">I</hi> will
urge her, Sir, she respects me, she will be
guided by me; she shall fuflil the promise
she made you&mdash;Oh, Sir, you but deceive
yourself&mdash;she will find out new excuses, I
am not to be again allured by false hopes.
</p><p>He stepped towards the door as he spoke
these words, and was about to open it.
Your brother followed, and laid hold of his
arm; I did the same.  Sir George, said he,
expose me not to insults, why do you persecute
me?  Leave me, Sir, I am <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a madman
&mdash;but I am <hi rend="italic">determined</hi>&mdash;and he spoke
it as if he were <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi> so.
</p><p>For heaven's sake, Faulkland, said your
brother, be composed: you have Mr.
Warner's word of honour; you shall have
mine too, that we will do our utmost to persuade
Mrs. Arnold to consent to your
wishes.  You have <hi rend="italic">my</hi> full consent, you
have won Mr. Warner to your interest, my
sister will yield to our joint entreaties.

<pb n="292"/>
<hi rend="italic">Yield</hi>, he repeated, no, no, Sir George, she
has a stubborn heart.  I once thought it
otherwise; but it is turned to stone, nothing
but my death will satisfy her, and she
<hi rend="italic">shall</hi> be satisfied.
</p><p>He made an effort to break from us.
Stay Mr. Faulkland, said I, again laying
hold of his hand, and I here swear to you
by every thing that is sacred, that if you will
suffer me to conduct you back into Mrs.
Arnold's presence, I will insist on her immediately
accepting of you for her husband,
or I will for ever renounce all friendship
with her: I know she esteems and values
you above all men, I am therefore sure, I
do no violence to her inclinations; and if
she perseveres in her obstinate punctilios, I
swear to you by the same other, that I will
no longer oppose you in your resolutions,
let them be what they will.
</p><p>Sir George, added I, Do you join with
me in giving your friend the same assurances?
I do, answered he, solemnly addressing
himself to Mr. Faulkland, and
swear by all my hopes of happiness hereafter,
to act in conjunction with Mr.

<pb n="293"/>
Warner in every particular that he has promised.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland seemed to be moved, he
looked whistfully at us by turns, as if willing,
though afraid, to yield to our entreaties.
</p><p>At length, I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> I may rely on you,
said he, you will not break an oath (to Sir
George) but that woman has such an <hi rend="italic">inflexible</hi>
heart! you cannot change <hi rend="italic">that</hi>.
</p><p>We will do our utmost, we both answered
together.  Remember then, said he,
stretching out a hand to each of us, you
have sworn, if she persists in her resolution,
that you will leave me to myself, and oppose
me no longer.  We have.  I will go
back with you then, cried Mr. Faulkland,
and stepped again nimbly to the door.
</p><p>It will be best, said I, if we can hire a
coach to carry us; there is no necessity for
our riding post, and we shall be less liable
to observation than if we were on horse-back. k Mr. Faulkland looked as if he
suspected some design; do you not mean
said he, to go directly back to London?
Certainly, I replied.  And shall I see Mrs.

<pb n="294"/>
Arnold to-night?  Without doubt, if you
desire it.  Let us go then, said he; I think
a coach is a tedious way of travelling, but
I submit to <hi rend="italic">your</hi> guidance.
</p><p>I left Sir George with him, and went out
to enquire whether we could be provided
with a coach and four; which after some
delay was procured for us.  We prevailed
on Mr. Faulkland, whilst it was getting
ready, to take a little refreshment.  He
asked us, by what means we were informed
of his departure.
</p><p>Sir George, unwilling to let him know
that his servant had discovered it, evaded
the question; and only replied, Do you
think, Faulkland, that in the humour I left
you, I could be inattentive to your motions?
I am not a madman, Bidulph, I must not
be treated like one.  I do not think you
one, answered your brother, but I know you
are warm, and too fearless of danger.
</p><p>When the coach was ready, Mr. Faulkland
very willingly got into it with us.  He
spoke but little, and appeared very thoughtful
during our journey.

<pb n="295"/>
</p><p>The coachman stopped at an inn, after
we had driven about fifteen miles, to bate
his horses for a while.  He seemed startled
at it, and said he would not alight.  We
told him there was no occasion, but your
brother and I chose to go into the house,
that he might no think we watched him.
He seemed pleased at this, and smiled when
we set forward again, but did not speak.
</p><p>When we arrived in London, Now, Sir,
said I, we will, if you please, go directly to
Mrs. Arnold's house.  As I am sure your
absenting yourself in the manner you did,
exceedingly afflicted her, so am I certain
your return will give her sincere joy.  I am
ready therefore to attend you immediately
to her; but if I may advise you, I think it
were better that I should first see and talk
to her.  It will be proper to prepare her, by
giving her at least one night to reflect on
the important event, which I expect will
take place to-morrow.  Sir George, what
are your sentiments?  I am of your mind,
replied your brother.  I think my sister
ought by all means to have so much time
given her for recollection.  If Faulkland

<pb n="296"/>
has no objection to it, we will go to my
friend's house, where he was before.  When
you have seen my sister you may come to us
there with her determination.
</p><p>I have submitted myself for the present,
answered Mr. Faulkland, to your guidance.
To-morrow remember I am to be at liberty.
Bidulph, beware how you watch my motions
again.
</p><p>Your brother then directed the coachman
to his friend's house, Mr. Faulkland
not opposing the motion.  I went in for a
few minutes merely to satisfy myself in what
manner Mr. Faulkland had escaped from
thence in order to inform you.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland was very urgent with me
to go to you.  Keep me not long in suspence,
Sir, said he, I may as well know my fate to-night, as to-morrow.
</p><p>I left him with a promise to return with
your final answer.  You know <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sentiments,
you know your brother's, and it
rests on you to pronounce sentence of life or
death (for your answer imports no less) on a
man who is worthy of the greatest queen in

<pb n="297"/>
the universe.  What do you say, Mrs.
Arnold, must Faulkland die?
</p><p>Heaven forbid, cried I, no, Sir; I should
be inflexible <hi rend="italic">indeed</hi>, if, after what you have
told me, I were any longer to resist.  I
yield, Sir, to your request, to Mr. Faulkland's,
and to my brother's; and I will
own at the same time that my heart strongly
impels me to consent.  Yet, my dear
Sir, believe me I should have resisted <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
impulse, if I could hope that my refusal
would not be followed by consequences too
dreadful to be thought on.  There is therefore
<hi rend="italic">no</hi> alternative, I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be the wife of
Mr. Faulkland.
</p><p>The sooner the affair is finished then the
better, said he; Faulkland stands here on
slippery ground; perhaps some of the Bond
family may by this time be arrived in England,
and in pursuit of him; therefore let
your marriage be dispatched immediately,
and send him away directly to Holland.
I suppose when he has made sure of you, he
may be prevailed on to go without you.
Oh, Sir, said I, urge this request to him I
beseech you, it is of the last importance to

<pb n="298"/>
me that he should comply with it, and the
only preliminary that I have now to make
to our marriage.  Yes, yes, answered my
kinsman, I think we shall convince him of
the necessity of this.  I shall escort you to
Holland myself, for I have business at Rotterdam;
and I had thoughts of taking the
voyage, if this occasion had not offered.
We will but just stay to settle some affairs
here, and observe what measures can be
taken for his service, and then follow him.
Take courage, my dear, continued he, seeing
me look sad, all may come right again.
I love out-of-the-way adventures, and this
I think <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one.  We will live like princes,
let us go where we will.  I only wish that
your brother were <hi rend="italic">against</hi> the match, that I
might have the more pleasure in forwarding
it; but I need not grudge him that
<hi rend="italic">once</hi> in his life he has shewn some token of
generosity.
</p><p>I will return to Faulkland, I long to set
his noble heart at ease.  Strange perverse
creatures your sex are!  It amazes me that
any thing could tempt you to reject such a
man!  Were I a woman, I should run mad

<pb n="299"/>
for him.  Well, I will go to him, and let
him know without any farther demurs you
will give him your hand to-morrow morning.
Our honest friend Price I think may
join you.  I will call on him, after I have
seen Faulkland, to bid him prepare for the
business.  I will myself have the pleasure of
giving you away.  Good by&mdash;and away he
went with a pleased busy countenance.
</p><p>I took up my pen as soon as he departed,
and have scribbled thus far without suffering
any reflections to stop me.  Let me now
lay down my pen, to pause before I leap
into the frightful precipice that opens before
me. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
. . . . . .  To-morrow!  Ah, my Cecilia,
what is that morrow to produce? it joins
me for ever to Mr. Faulkland! the chosen
of my heart, my first love! the man who
adores me; who deserves all my affection,
who has obliged me beyond all recompence.
Who has a claim to my warmest gratitude,
to my esteem, to my whole heart.  I save
his life, I have the power to make him happy;
my brother, my kinsman urge me;
my own heart too prompts me.  Why

<pb n="300"/>
cannot I then reconcile myself to my lot?
Oh that question is answered by a fearful
image that starts up to my fancy&mdash;I am not
superstitious, yet believe me, my dear, I
am at this instant chilled with horror.
</p><p>I am ashamed to confess my weakness,
but I must call Patty to sit with me the remainder
of the night.  I cannot think of rest!
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Wednesday Morning</hi>.
</p><p>I have passed the whole night in endeavouring
to fortify my mind against the important
event that a few hours will accomplish.
If Mr. Faulkland's mind should
again become tranquil, which my kinsman
gave me room to hope would be the consequence
of gratifying the ardent wish of
his soul, I must take care not to disturb it by
shewing any reluctance in yielding him my
hand.  Had an Angel <hi rend="italic">once</hi> told me that I
should give my hand <hi rend="italic">reluctantly</hi> to Mr.
Faulkland, I would not have believed it;
yet fatally circumstanced as our marriage
<hi rend="italic">now</hi> is, it cannot be otherwise.
</p><p>And yet I <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be his.  I owe him a
great sacrifice, and I am about to pay it.

<pb n="301"/>
I am dressed and ready.  I wait for my
kinsman, or my brother, one of whom, or
both perhaps, will be here presently . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . . . Mr. Warner is come;
I have but just time to tell you that my
brother and Mr. Price are with Mr. Faulkland.
My kinsman says he is quite a new
man.  They wait for me, I go.  Heaven
guide my steps . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>.&mdash;My fate is accomplished!
What a change!  Join with me, my dear
Cecilia, in beseeching heaven to look graciously
down on me in my new state, and to
guide and protect my beloved Mr. Faulkland,
my ever destined husband.  Alas!
my dear, he is now many miles separated
from me.
</p><p>The worthy Mr. Price performed the
sacred ceremony.  Mr. Warner did the office
of a father.  He and my brother were
all who were present.
</p><p>There is something so amazing in all
this, I can scarce credit my senses; but my
life has been a series of strange, strange
events!

<pb n="302"/>
</p><p>I am so bewildered, I cannot connect my
thoughts; but I will try to give you my
yesterday's <hi rend="italic">vision</hi>, for I can hardly persuade
myself that what I recollect really happened.
</p><p>I broke off just as Mr. Warner called on
me, to carry me to the house of my brother's
friend.
</p><p>While we were in the coach, he told me,
that having the night before informed Mr.
Faulkland of the joyful news of my consenting
to marry him the next day, he
seemed at first to doubt, and repeatedly
conjured him not to deceive him; 'till
having received the most solemn assurances
of its being true, Mr. Faulkland gave himself
up to such ecstacies, as made them apprehensive
his joy might have effects almost
as fatal in their consequences, as his despair
was likely to produce before.
</p><p>Mr. Warner had a mind to lower him a
little, and thought, by putting him in
mind of his danger, somewhat to allay his
transports.
</p><p>Mrs. Arnold's consent to make you happy,
said he, fills me with extreme joy;
but it is not now a time to indulge it: you

<pb n="303"/>
are here in peril of your life; you must
preserve it now for Mrs. Arnold's sake.
For Mrs. Arnold's sake! he replied with
ecstasy, yes, yes, 'tis now worth preserving.
Mr. Warner, Kinsman, Friend of my life,
(grasping his hand) dispose of me as you
please; you shall guide all my steps.  Will
not Mrs. Arnold go with me after we are
made one?
</p><p>If, after having considered what may be
urged to you on that head, you should still
continue to desire it, replied my cousin, she
will without doubt accompany you.  But,
my dear Sir, consider, circumstanced as you
now are, what will the world say, should
she accompany your flight?  It will fix an
indelible stain on her character, which is
dearer to her than life, and which I am
sure, upon cooler thoughts, you will prize
at an equal value.  This marriage will be a
profound secret to the world; it may remain
so as long as we please.  I have business
in Holland, which will demand my presence
there in a very short time.  Her accompanying
me thither can give rise to no
suspicion.  I will dispatch my affairs with

<pb n="304"/>
all possible speed, and conduct her to
you.
</p><p>The joy that before lighted up his countenance,
pursued my cousin, seemed a little
clouded.  He took a turn or two about the
room, as if to consider of what I had said;
then, addressing himself jointly to your
brother and me, You are both cooler than
I am; perhaps you may judge better; let
me but call her <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, I will then do as you
would have me.  I cannot determine on
any thing now.
</p><p>As soon as my sister and you are married,
said Sir George, I think, Faulkland, you
ought to get out of England with all the
speed you can.  It will be but a short absence;
Sidney will soon follow you.  What
do you purpose doing in regard to your son?
I had forgot him, cried Mr. Faulkland.
Poor child!  My heart has been in such tumults
since Mr. Warner came in, that I
could think of nothing but the blessed news
he has brought me.  But I must not neglect
my boy.  I will write to the honest servant
that I left behind; he shall bring him over:
you, my dear Bidulph, will take care of

<pb n="305"/>
him, 'till an opportunity offers of sending
him to me.
</p><p>I hope there will be no need, replied your
brother, of sending him out of England;
your affairs may yet turn out so as to permit
your return into your own country.&mdash;
Impossible! interrupted Mr. Faulkland: if
Smyth should ever recover, <hi rend="italic">his</hi> representation
of the other accident cuts off every
hope.  He will not, for his own sake, confess
the truth, but impute the errour of my
fatal hand to premeditated guilt.  Heaven
knows, base as she was, I would not have
attempted her life; but I was born to be
the avenger of those crimes, into the commission
of which I, perhaps, first led her.  As
for the contemptible villain who wronged
me, I do not repent of the punishment I inflicted
on him; though probably, had I
been allowed a moment's time for recollection,
I might have taken vengeance in a
manner more worthy of myself.
</p><p>I was delighted, proceeded Mr. Warner,
to find him so cool and rational in his reflexions.
He continued talking calmly
and reasonably on the subject of his misfortunes;

<pb n="306"/>
but on the mention of your name,
started again into transports; but they now
seemed to be only those of joy, upon the
prospect of what was to happen the next
day.
</p><p>After I left him, I went to Mr. Price,
who promised to be in readiness at the appointed
hour.
</p><p>We were now got to the house of my
brother's friend.  Mr. Warner led me up
stairs into the room, where Sir George, Mr.
Faulkland, and Mr. Price, were sitting together.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland was so agitated at the
sight of me, that having risen to salute me,
he was not able to speak; but seizing both
my hands, he kissed them fervently one after
the other, tears dropping on them as he
held them to his lips.  Every one was silent;
we were all too much affected to
speak.  My brother was the first that broke
silence.  Well, Faulkland, said he, have
we not kept our promise?
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland turned towards him:  Oh,
Bidulph, forgive me for doubting; I am
afraid I have used you ill:  Can you pardon

<pb n="307"/>
the madness that I was driven to by despair?
&mdash;Mr. Warner, Mrs. Arnold, I believe you
think me distracted.  Indeed I am not.  I
was only&mdash;(and he seemed to hesitate for
a word) weary of life.&mdash;I thought I had lost
every thing.&mdash;The world was grown a desart.
&mdash;No one in it for me.
</p><p>You formed a wrong judgment, my
dear Sir, answered Mr. Warner; you find
yourself now with your sincere friends; Sir
George and myself are both so; and your
bride, your dear Mrs. Arnold, is ready to
give you her hand.  I <hi rend="italic">am</hi>, Sir, said I, and if
your happiness still depends on me, it gives
me joy that I have at length the power of
<hi rend="italic">bestowing</hi> it.
</p><p>I have no <hi rend="italic">words</hi>, he replied, I can <hi rend="italic">find</hi>
none, it is all <hi rend="italic">here</hi>; and he laid his hand on
his heart, his eyes fixed with delight on my
face.
</p><p>I beheld him now, my Cecilia, in a light
in which I had never before viewed him,
overwhelmed by misfortunes, of which I
accused myself as being the author.  I saw
him an exile, likely to be deprived of a noble
fortune, his heart pierced with remorse

<pb n="308"/>
for an involuntary crime.  I saw too that
he loved me; loved me with a fervent and
unconquerable passion.  Of this, in the anguish
of his soul, at a time when he was
wrought up to phrenzy, he had given but
too strong demonstration.  Shall I own it
to you, my Cecilia, I think I never loved
him as I did in that moment.
</p><p>My heart was at once assailed by a variety
of passions; amongst which, gratitude,
and the softest compassion, were predominant.
</p><p>I continued silent, whilst Mr. Faulkland
remained ardently gazing at me.
</p><p>My brother, I believe, thought us too
solemn; the occasion indeed required it:
but his fears for Mr. Faulkland made him
wish to give the scene a livelier turn.
</p><p>Come, sister, said he, let us not defer the
happy event for which we are now met,
we have no time to waste in ceremony.
You remember what our mother used to say,
Many things fall out between the cup and
the lip.'  My brother rose off his chair
as he said this.  Mr. Warner taking the
hint, approached, and took me by the hand.

<pb n="309"/>
Let <hi rend="italic">me</hi>, said he, to Mr. Faulkland, have the
happiness of bestowing this best of Creatures
ont he man that I think <hi rend="italic">best</hi> deserves her.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland made no reply; but in
taking the hand that my kinsman put into
his, his looks spoke the rapture that swelled
his heart; though I saw he put a constraint
upon himself, and endeavoured to assume a
deportment suitable to the important and
solemn occasion.
</p><p>After the indissoluble knot was tied, my
brother desired Mr. Faulkland to retire with
him into the next room for a few minutes.
</p><p>I concluded it was in order to press his
departure, and to prevail on him to submit
to going without me.
</p><p>This I found afterwards was the subject
of their conversation.
</p><p>They returned to us in about a quarter of
an hour, Mr. Faulkland's countenance less
embarrassed than it was at going out of the
room.  On their entering, Mr. Price took
his leave.  My brother addressed Mr.
Warner and me.  Faulkland, said he, is convinced
of the necessity there is for his immediately
withdrawing from England, and he

<pb n="310"/>
is determined to depart from hence at three
o'clock to-morrow morning; for I would
by no means have him leave London by day-light, as we know not who may be on the
watch to trace his steps.  He has consented
that you, sister, should remain behind till
Mr. Warner's affairs will permit him to
conduct you over.  In the mean time, Master
Faulkland is to be brought from Ireland;
and if you should not be ready to depart
before his arrival, you may take him over
with you to Holland.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland seemed rather to <hi rend="italic">suffer</hi>
my brother to make this explanation for
him, than to assent chearfully to it.  Mr.
Warner and I however laid hold of it, and
immediately entered into discourse on the
subject of our domestic concerns, and the
measures proper to be observed on so critical
an occasion.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland joined in the conversation
with the utmost composure; and to my unspeakable
joy seemed perfectly settled and
collected in his mind.  I thought indeed he
appeared a little constrained, and that he
seemed to keep a constant guard over himself,

<pb n="311"/>
lest he should betray any symptom of a
too much heated imagination: but my kinsman
afterwards observed with pleasure to
me, that this denoted nothing more than a
consciousness in Mr. Faulkland of the unhappy
wandering that had before so much
alarmed us all; and into which he was sure
there was not the least danger of his relapsing,
as his heart was now perfectly at
ease.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland told us he had letters to
write to Ireland, which he would dispatch,
that he might have nothing to interrupt the
few short hours we had to pass together in
the evening.
</p><p>Mr. Warner said he had business to do
that called him away, but that he would
return after dinner: and my brother (that
Mr. Faulkland might be quite undisturbed)
proposed my going home with him, and
that we should come back together in the
afternoon.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland did not object to this,
and I went with Sir George.
</p><p>We returned early in the afternoon to
Mr. Faulkland.  As my brother had let his

<pb n="312"/>
friend into our secret, we passed up stairs
without any notice being taken of us.
</p><p>Mr. Faulkland had writ two letters;
one of them very long, to Mr. Bond,
which he gave my brother to read, but I
know not the contents of it.  The other
was to that careful honest servant whom he
had mentioned to us, with orders to bring
over Master Faulkland with all convenient
speed, and put him into Sir George's hands.
</p><p>Mr. Warner but just called in upon us
in the evening, he said he had been making
the necessary preparations for Mr. Faulkland's
journey; and that having resolved
himself to attend him as far as Harwich, he
would, at the hour appointed, call on him
in a coach, which should carry them a few
miles out of town, where the horses were to
wait for them.
</p><p>Worthy, compassionate, and generous
kinsman, how I love you for the honest
warmth of your heart!
</p><p>My brother and Mr. Faulkland had a
great deal of discourse about the necessary
measures that were to be taken by us all;
and we passed the evening in a kind of

<pb n="313"/>
chastened satisfaction, which could not arise
to happiness form the near prospect we had
of parting.
</p><p>About ten o'clock my brother took an
affectionate leave of his friend, he excused
himself from accompanying him on his
journey, on account of Lady Sarah's not
being well.
</p><p>To see <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a parting, would at another
time have deeply affected me, but my own
hour of separation drew near.  It came, and
Mr. Warner punctual to his time, hurried
Mr. Faulkland almost by force into the
coach, and drove off with him.
</p><p>I threw myself into a chair which he had
ordered for me, and was carried home.  I
went not to bed; but had recourse to my
pen.  God preserve my dear fugitive; I
can do nothing but weep.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 2.  My mind was too much unsettled
yesterday to dictate any thing coherent.
I am now, thank heaven, more composed.
Sir George and Lady Sarah have
been with me during the greatest part of the
day; both kind and consoling.  My brother

<pb n="314"/>
seems to have all his former affection
for me revived in his heart; he is indeed
charmed with my justice, as he calls it.
Lady Sarah, who at the bottom of her heart
is no way concerned about this event, affects
however to think as her husband does, and
commends me for my generosity.
</p><p>I feel myself easier in proportion as I
think Mr. Faulkland gets farther out of the
reach of danger.  Sir George says by this
time he may be on his voyage.
</p><p>I shall certainly wait till the child arrives,
in order to take him with me.  My two
little girls will be fond of such a brother,
for he is a charming boy.
</p><p>My brother flatters me with a possibility
at least of Major Smyth's recovering; and
if so, he says that Mr. Faulkland may stand
his trial for the other accident, as he is in
hopes Smyth will not persist in his villainy
so far as to add perjury to his other crimes.
</p><p>I have but little expectations of justice
from so bad a man, but I would not discourage
my friends in their endeavours to
comfort me.

<pb n="315"/>
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 3.&mdash;Mr. Warner is returned from
Harwich, after having seen Mr. Faulkland
safe on board the packet, and even under
sail for Holland.
</p><p>What a benevolent heart has this good
relation of mine!  Indeed I dearly love and
respect him.  His return has revived my
spirits, and I begin to lose my fears.  He
brought me a short letter from Mr. Faulkland;
short it is, but his heart speaks in
every syllable of it.  I will not give you
the contents, my Cecilia, you will think it
too extravagant, too romantic, for a husband
to write so to his wife.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 6.&mdash;I long, yet dread to hear accounts
from Ireland.  I fear that wretched
Smyth is dead.  No mail has arrived from
thence these eight days.  Contrary winds
they tell me detain the packets on the other
side very often for a fortnight together.  If
that be so, how fortunate was Mr. Faulkland
in seizing on a lucky hour for his departure
from the Irish shore.

<pb n="316"/>
</p><p>I suppose Mr. Bond's family, whom he
must have rendered very unhappy, particularly
the daughter, are all now his implacable
enemies; and are tormenting themselves
in being detained from the pursuit of
their vengeance.  But let them come now
when they will, he is far out of the reach
of his foes.
</p><p>I would it were possible for my Cecilia
to arrive in England before my departure
for Holland.  Indeed, my dear, I shall not
be sorry if I am detained from Mr. Faulkland,
til I have the happiness of first embracing
you, as our separation may be afterwards
of a long continuance.  I shall
wait for the arrival of Master Faulkland,
and who knows but adverse winds may
detain him till your return.  O! that I
may pass though it be but one day, with
the dear companion of my youth before we
are again divided!
</p><p>I will not send this packet off, till I am
ready to depart from England, as that will
be closing an important period of my life.
What would I give that my dearest friend
would come, and instead of this tedious narrative

<pb n="317"/>
which I have written, receive the account
from my own lips!  If my wishes
should not be granted in this, cannot you
make Holland your way home?  Mr. Faulkland
purposes staying at the Hague till I go
to him.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 9.&mdash;Cecilia! have I been a murmurer
at the decrees of providence? have I
been an impious repiner when heaven has
poured down its wrath upon my head? if
not, why am I marked out for divine vengeance?
before I lose my senses, or my life,
for both I cannot retain, hear the last act of
your friend's tragic story.
</p><p>My brother called on me this day; he
gave me a letter directed to Mr. Faulkland,
which came under a cover to him.  Read
it, said he, it is from Ireland, and may contain
something material for us to know.
</p><p>It was from the honest servant Mr.
Faulkland left behind him.  See what he
says, and then tell me if I ought to live
any longer.

<pb n="318"/>
</p><p>'Honoured Sir,
</p><p>'I have the happiness to send you a piece
of good news, which made me wish for
wings to have flown over to you with it.
</p><p>'My lady, Heaven be praised, is not
dead, nor so much as hurt.  I am thankful
for this, Sir, on your account, not
her's.
</p><p>'I don't know what possessed the people
at Mr. Bond's, to tell me she was dead;
the mistake, to be sure, was occasioned by
the great confusion the family were thrown
into, and indeed, from what I myself saw,
I was sure she was actually dead.
</p><p>'Major Smyth lived 'till the surgeon
came; but had been speechless for two or
three hours, and died whilst his wound
was probing.
</p><p>'My lady had only fallen into a fit, and
the major having bled prodigiously, she
received a great deal of his blood upon
her linen, and as he afterwards contrived
to throw himself on the bed, which was
at some distance from the place where she
had fallen, it gave occasion to Mrs. Bond,

<pb n="319"/>
(who was herself the first person that entered
the room, after the sad accident) on
finding my lady lying senseless, pale, and
bloody, on the floor, to suppose she had
been killed.
</p><p>'This alarm ran through the family,
and was confirmed to me by every one in
it, as we servants soon quitted the chamber;
and the major himself said, that you
discharged one of the pistols at your lady,
and the other at him.
</p><p>'I returned to Mr. Bond's in the morning,
after you were gone off, to enquire
whether Major Smyth was alive or not;
he was just then dead.
</p><p>'The waiting-maid informed me, that
my lady, to their great surprize, was recovered,
having only been in a fainting
fit, which held her above an hour, without
her shewing any signs of life; and that
she had fallen from one to another 'till
morning: and she farther said (begging
your honour's pardon) it would be no
great matter if she had died in one;
for she believed it was for no good she
went into the major's room at that time of
the night.

<pb n="320"/>
</p><p>'I staid about the house all the day to pick
up what intelligence I could from the servants.
Young Mr. Bond, with two or
three men, went to your house, and not
finding you there, I suppose, rode in pursuit
of you; but, Heaven be praised, you
have escaped their hands.
</p><p>'The waiting-maid, who is a very civil
young woman, told me, in the evening,
that my lady, being come a little to herself
(though I believe not in her right
mind) was informed of the major's death;
at which she was so exceedingly terrified,
that finding herself ill besides, she confessed
the whole truth of the matter, and
proved, that the major died with a lie in
his mouth: so that I hope Mr. Bond's family
will not be so spiteful as to prosecute
the affair any farther.
</p><p>'My lady was sent home directly in the
chariot, as they could not bear the sight
of her any longer in the house.  She takes
on mightily; but we all bless ourselves,
that she is alive.
</p><p>'I shall make bold to inclose this, according
to your order, to Sir George Bidulph;

<pb n="321"/>
and as soon as I receive your commands
about Master, shall make no delay
in this unlucky place.  I am,
</p><p>'Honoured Sir,
</p><p>     'Your dutiful and obedient servant,
</p><p>               'FREDERICK HILDY.'
</p><p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 26.

my death should close such a scene as this. </p>

<head>Editor's Note</head>
<p>Here, to the editor's great disappointment,
Mrs. Arnold's interesting story broke
off; that unhappy lady not having continued
her journal any farther.
</p><p>But as this seemed to be one of the most
affecting periods of her life, his curiosity
induced him to enquire of the gentleman
from whom he received those papers, whether
he could give him any farther light into
her story; as he thought it not improbable
that he might have learned, from
his mother, some other particulars relating
to her.
</p><p>His friend told him, that he knew his
mother had drawn up a narrative of the

<pb n="322"/>
subsequent remarkable events in the life of
Mrs. Arnold, at the request of a particular
friend; that he had once heard it read;
but, as he was then a boy, it made but little
impression upon him; that afterwards,
when he wanted to have his curiosity gratified,
his mother told him, she could not
find the manuscript, and feared it was lost.
However, he said, he would search her papers,
and, if he recovered it, it should be
at his service.
</p><p>After some time, the gentleman informed
the editor, that he had made the strictest
scrutiny into his mother's papers, and could
find nothing relative to the subject of Mrs.
Arnold, excepting a few loose sheets, which
seemed to have been the foul copy of the
beginning of her narrative; and, at the
same time, put them into his hands.
</p><p>These the editor offers to the publick, as
he received them, without any alteration
or addition.

</p><p>CECILIA'S NARRATIVE &amp;c.
</p><p>     Being
</p><p>A Supplement to Mrs. ARNOLD'S
</p><p>     Journal.
</p><p>I SET out on my return to England, immediately
after the receipt of her last
journal, the melancholy close of which had
exceedingly terrified and afflicted me.
</p><p>Immediately on my arrival in London,
I flew to the dear friend of my heart; she
was still at her house, in Pall-mall.
</p><p>I found the dear Sidney alone, in her
bed-chamber.  She had been prepared to
receive me; but, though I had endeavoured
to arm myself with resolution for this affecting
interview, I was not mistress of my-self at the sight of her.
</p><p>The tears I shed did not spring from that
sweet emotion, which long severed friends
feel at seeing each other again; I wept in

<pb n="324"/>
sorrow for the heavy misfortunes of the
best of women.
</p><p>But Mrs. Arnold, still herself, and superior
to adversity, received me with the
tenderest marks of friendship, and with a
composure that amazed me.
</p><p>Piety, meekness, and patience, were ever
Mrs. Arnold's characteristics; and they
now all appeared blended, and so strongly
impressed on her beautiful face, that I could
not look at her without admiration.
</p><p>As I was astonished to find her so calm
under so trying an affliction, I could not
help expressing myself to that purpose; but
Mrs. Arnold checked me, with this reply:
I have been set up as a mark, my Cecilia;
let me fulfil the intention of my Maker, by
shewing a perfect resignation to His will.
I hope, my task is almost finished, and
that he will soon permit me to return to
the dust from which I came.'
</p><p>Frederick Hildy had arrived from Ireland
above a fortnight before, with Master
Faulkland, a beautiful child of about five
years old.  They were both lodged in Mrs.
Arnold's house.

<pb n="325"/>
</p><p>She told me, that Sir George Bidulph
and Mr. Warner had set out together for
Holland, immediately after the receipt of
the letter, which informed them of Mrs.
Faulkland's being alive.
</p><p>My brother, said Mrs. Arnold, thought
it necessary himself to be the bearer of news
so fatal in its import to his friend.  He
hoped besides he should be able to persuade
him to return and stand his trial for having
killed Major Smyth, as there is no doubt
of his being acquitted; all Mr. Bond's family
being now convinced, from Mrs.
Faulkland's own confession, that there was
nothing premeditated in this fatal event, and
that what Mr. Faulkland did was in defence
of his own life.
</p><p>I have writ, continued she, to Mr. Faulkland,
to endeavour to console him under
our mutual misfortune.
</p><p>At my request, she shewed me a copy
of this letter; wherein she assured him,
she would take the tenderest care of his
son, 'till the child could be delivered safe
into his hands; and conjured him, for that
child's sake, to be careful of his own interest

<pb n="326"/>
and preservation; adding, that as
their ill fated marriage was an absolute secret
to every one but the persons immediately
concerned, she hoped he would not suffer
the thoughts of it to break in upon his
future quiet; and concluded with beseeching
him to forget her, as they were never
more to meet.
</p><p>This was the substance of what she wrote.
There were no murmurings at her fate, no
womanish complainings, mixed with the
tender, yet noble sentiments of her heart.
She endeavoured to conceal her own anguish
under the mask of contentment, that  Mr.
Faulkland might the better support this
final destruction of all his hopes.
</p><p>I asked her, whether she had heard since
from Mr. Faulkland?  She told me, she had
as yet received no answer from him to this
letter, but that she had heard severally from
Sir George and Mr. Warner, who both informed
her, that Mr. Faulkland, after his
first transports of surprize and grief were
over, at receiving this new and unexpected
blow, had grown more calm, and seemed
inclined to return with them to England.

<pb n="327"/>
Sir George added, in the last letter she had
from him, that they only waited 'till Mr.
Warner had accomplished the business that
he had to do in Holland, and hoped, before
a fortnight was at an end, to return home,
and to have the pleasure of conducting Mr.
Faulkland back.
</p><p>It is ten days, continued Mrs. Arnold,
since I received this account, and I flatter
myself, that they may be now on their
journey homeward.
</p><p>Mrs. Arnold said, that she waited but
for Sir George's return, in order to deliver
Master Faulkland into his hands, and that
she then meant to retire into the country,
with her two children, and Patty, the faithful
companion and partner of her grief.
</p><p>Lady Sarah Bidulph, who would gladly
have gone with Sir George to Holland, had
been persuaded by him to stay behind, in
order to bear his sister company in her affliction;
and Mrs. Arnold said, she had dedicated
much of her time to that friendly
purpose.
</p><p>Her Ladyship came to pay her a visit
whilst I was there.  I had never seen Lady

<pb n="328"/>
Sarah before; and we were introduced to
each other.
</p><p>I took my leave of Mrs. Arnold, and
promised to see her again the next day.
</p><p>In the morning, as I was preparing to go
to her, I received a note from Lady Sarah
Bidulph, earnestly requesting the favour of
seeing me, at her house, in St. James's
Square, before I went to Mrs. Arnold.
</p><p>I obeyed this unexpected summons, and
immediately waited on her.
</p><p>I took the liberty, Madam, said she, of
desiring to see you here this morning, at
Sir George's request: He arrived late last
night, and brings most melancholy news
from Holland.
</p><p>Sir George entered the room while she
spoke.  After the first greetings of friends
long parted were over, I am afraid to ask,
Sir George, said I, yet am impatient to learn
something of Mr. Faulkland, your lady has
terribly alarmed me; Mr. Faulkland is not
returned; I dare not enquire the reason.
Tears instantly sprung into Sir George's
eyes.  He returns no more, said he, his remains

<pb n="329"/>
are soon to be conveyed to England
to be laid with his ancestors.
</p><p>Ah, Sir, cried I, what will poor Mrs.
Arnold say to this fresh misfortune?
</p><p>It was on that account Madam, he replied,
that we now requested to speak with
you, before you saw my sister.  You, who
are her bosom friend, can more tenderly
disclose this melancholy event than any one.
I have not the courage to see her.  We
must beg of you, dear Madam, to prepare
the unhappy Sidney for the news.
</p><p>I asked him the manner of Mr. Faulkland's
death.  I cannot positively say, answered
Sir George, but much I fear he precipitated
his own fate.
</p><p>Mr. Warner, or I, constantly staid with
him from the time we disclosed the fatal account
we brought concerning Mrs. Faulkland.
Knowing as we did the violence of
his temper, we were apprehensive of sudden
and dreadful consequences; but he deceived
us both; for after the first starts of
passion were over, which though they shocked,
did not alarm us, as we expected them,
he assumed a calm resignation to his fate;

<pb n="330"/>
and talked with such a rational composure
of the strange circumstances of this incident,
than we began to entertain hopes, that the
efforts of his reason, joined to our constant
endeavours to sooth and console him,
would in time so far succeed, as though we
never expected to see him restored to a
tranquil state of mind, we yet flattered ourselves
he would submit to life upon such
terms as Providence thought fit to impose
on him.
</p><p>I was with him, proceeding Sir George,
when he received a letter from my sister.
His hands shook so on perceiving by the
superscription that it came from her, that he
let the letter drop.  Read it for me, Bidulph,
said he, and tell me how it fares with Mrs.
Arnold.
</p><p>I instantly complied with his request.  I
found by the date of the letter that it had
been delayed much longer than it ought to
have been, which I immediately observed
to him, as he had often expressed his uneasiness
at not hearing from my sister.
</p><p>Mrs. Arnold is well, said I, giving him

<pb n="331"/>
the letter; read what she says, and let her
teach you fortitude.
</p><p>He withdrew to a window to peruse it.
After he had read it, I admire your sister's
stoicism, said he, stepping back to his chair.
This is true philosophy, laying his finger on
the letter which he still held in his hand.
<hi rend="italic">Her</hi> heroic soul is still unmoved, and above
the reach of adversity.  Happy Mrs.
Arnold&mdash;What a vain fool was I to think
that such a mind as <hi rend="italic">hers</hi> could be subdued.
He paused and seemed for a while buried
in thought.  Then putting the letter up
in his pocket, he began to discourse on some
other topic.
</p><p>We passed the evening together, continued
Sir George, and though Faulkland
was far from being chearful, I thought he
appeared more tranquil than he had done
since my arrival.
</p><p>I talked to him of his returning to England
with me.  He said with a smile, I
think I ought to go if it were for no other
reason but that I may have my dust mingled
with that of my forefathers; and this office,

<pb n="332"/>
Bidulph, I expected from you, if you
should outlive me.
</p><p>I laughed at him, and said I thought he
had a much more material reason that pressed
his return.
</p><p>Your estate, said I, is unsettled; and if
you were to die abroad in the predicament
in which you now stand, what is to become
of your son?
</p><p>I have already done for my son, said he,
all that I thought in justice was in my power
to do: I have long ago settled my personal
fortune on him, that in case my next heirs,
should on account of the illegitimacy of his
birth, claim the family estate, he may have
a handsome support without it.
</p><p>And indeed I never wished to debar my
lawful heirs in favour of this child; though
I love him tenderly, and they are worthless
people, whom I despise, and with whom I
never had any intercourse.
</p><p>I replied, if that were so, as the manner
of the child's birth was a secret, I wished he
might, undisturbed, inherit his father's fortune,
when he should come to pay the last
debt to nature.

<pb n="333"/>
</p><p>He answered, where such a vast property
was at stake, there would not be people
wanting whose interest would engage them
to discover the secret; and he doubted not
but the irregularity of his wife's conduct,
had already occasioned enquiries to be
made.
</p><p>Supposing, said I, you had had another
son by Mrs. Faulkland since your marriage
&mdash;as you could have no objection to
the bequeathing your fortune to him, would
it not have appeared strange in the eyes of
the world that you should disinherit your
eldest son.
</p><p>It might have appeared so, said he, but I
certainly should have done it: and for that
reason, as I have no child but him, I have
made such a disposition of my fortune as I
now tell you.  If I live, I may increase my
son's patrimony; if not, he must be contended
with that which I have bequeathed to him,
and let my kindred scramble for the rest.
</p><p>We staid together till it was late; he discoursed
on a variety of subjects, but mentioned
not my sister's name during the
whole time.

<pb n="334"/>
</p><p>I thought I left him well, and his mind
tolerably composed.  We were to set out
on our return in six days; but an account
was brought to me in the morning, that
Mr. Faulkland was found dead in his bed.
</p><p>There were no symptoms discovered on
the body that could let us into the occasion
of his death; but as my own fears suggested
too much, I chose not to be particular in
my enquiries.  Wishing rather that his fatal
story should be buried in silence.
</p><p>Mr. Warner found that his affairs were
likely to delay him longer than the time
proposed; and as I had nothing farther to
detain me in Holland, I set out the day
after my unfortunate friend's death, leaving
to Mr. Warner, the care of conveying his
remains to England, agreeably to the desire
he had expressed, which I now considered as
his last injunction laid on me.
</p><p>Thus, proceeded Sir George, by a series
of fatal events, each of which was occasioned
by motives in themselves laudable, has one
of the bravest and most noble-minded men
on earth been cut off in the prime of his

<pb n="335"/>
youth&mdash;Oh! Faulkland, why did you suffer
that gallant spirit to be vanquished?&mdash;
</p><p>Sir George's emotions topped his farther
speech.  I was too much affected to say any
thing to him, but took a hasty leave of Lady
Sarah, in order to go to Mrs. Arnold.
</p><p>As soon as I entered my friend's room,
Cecilia, said she, if your countenance be as
faithful an interpreter of your mind as it
used to be, you have some thing disastrous
to relate; you may say any thing, misfortune
and I have been so familiar, I shall not
shrink at its approach.
</p><p>Sir George is returned, I replied, you
will see him to-day.
</p><p>Is he come alone, she asked?  Alone, I
replied.  You but repeat my words, Cecilia,
without adding any thing from yourself.
</p><p>Shall I interpret the meaning of that
mournful echo?  Mr. Faulkland no longer
lives!
</p><p>I was silent&mdash;Oh I knew him too well,
said she, raising her voice with energy, to
think he would survive this last blow.
</p><p>His death was natural, said I, for any
thing that appeared to the contrary.  God

<pb n="336"/>
be praised for that, cried Mrs. Arnold!  <hi rend="italic">If</hi>
so, I am satisfied that he is at peace.
</p><p>She then enquired after Mr. Warner, and
her brother, without making any farther
mention of Mr. Faulkland.
</p><p>Whilst we were in discourse, Master
Faulkland ran into the room.  He had
been at play with the two little Miss
Arnolds, who were in pursuit of him,
and he flew to Mrs. Arnold to hid him.
She folded him tenderly in her arms; then
turning to me, Look at this boy, said she, he
is the perfect image of his father.
</p><p>When am I to go to my papa, cried the
child, as he hung round her neck?  This innocent
unexpected demand quite vanished
Mrs. Arnold's fortitude.  She set him down
without being able to answer his question,
then said, Excuse me, my Cecilia, I would
wish to be alone for to-day.  It was not
yet a season to administer consolation, and
I withdrew.
</p><p>She staid in London but two days after
this; when, as she had before resolved, she
retired to an estate in Buckinghamshire,

<pb n="337"/>
which her kinsman had purchased and settled
on her for ever.
</p><p>With her brother's consent, she took
Master Faulkland with her, and prevailed
on Mr. Price to accompany her into the
country, to whom she committed the care
of the child's education.
</p><p>Mr. Warner, whom she had acquainted
by letter with her intention, approved of the
step she had taken.  He returned to England
in about three weeks after her departure
from her house in town, which she had
left for his reception just as he had fitted it
up for her.
</p><p>Before I accompany Mrs. Arnold into
her solitude, I shall just briefly mention some
other persons who were connected with her
story.
</p><p>The relations of Mr. Faulkland, as he
had foreseen, claimed his estate, and at
length obtained it, the illegitimacy of the
child being proved.
</p><p>The wretched Mrs. Faulkland, abandoned
and despised, returned to England; but as
she was there hated and shunned by every
one, she remained in obscurity for a few

<pb n="338"/>
years, and then died unpitied and unlamented.
</p><p>I now return to Mrs. Arnold, who, settled
in her quiet retreat in the country, it
might be hoped would have passed the remainder
of her days undisturbed by any
new calamity.
</p><p>The only source of true heroism of soul,
religion, had all along supported, and prevented
her from sinking under the most trying
afflictions.  Many and bitter were the
sufferings she had already endured; but she
was, to use her own words, <hi rend="italic">Set up as a
mark</hi>; and the deep afflictions that still pursued
her, and clouded even her latter days
with misfortunes, may serve to shew that it
is not <hi rend="italic">here</hi> that true virtue is to look for
its reward.  I saw her at a time when this
reflection, as it had been her chief, so was
it her last and only consolation.
</p><p>Possessed as she was of an admirable understanding,
and an enlarged mind, in the
deepest solitude she had always resources of
entertainment within herself.  Her natural
disposition ever sweet and complying, was
improved by her sufferings into a patience

<pb n="339"/>
very rare in woman; and a resignation imbibed
at first from a rigid education, was
heightened by religion into an almost saint-like meekness and humility.
</p><p>I shall pass over the first ten years of her
retirement, in which nothing material happened
but the marriage of the amiable Patty
Main to a gentleman of a large estate, and
the death of her worthy kinsman Mr. Warner,
who bequeathed her his whole fortune.
</p><p>Miss Arnold, her eldest daughter, was
now something more than fifteen, and fulfilled
the promise her childhood gave, of her
being a perfect beauty.  Miss Cecilia was
about a year younger, and though not so
handsome as her sister, was accounted one
of the finest young ladies of her time.
</p><p>With what delight have I seen this excellent
mother, while these two charming
young creatures were all attention, relate to
them the extraordinary and affecting incidents
of her life.
</p><p>This, said she, I do, not as a murmurer at
my fate, nor to move your pity at my misfortunes,
but to teach you by my example,
that there is no situation in life exempt from

<pb n="340"/>
trouble.  It found <hi rend="italic">me</hi> under the tender care
of the best of parents, it pursued me into
my husband's house.  In my virgin state,
when I was a wife, and in my widowhood,
I was equally persecuted.
</p><p>Poverty, I once thought, would have
exempted me from every ill, but what its
own hand inflicted; and had it remained
my companion, the bitterest misfortune of
my life would have been prevented; for, if
wealth had not accompanied my hand, the
world could not have persuaded me to yield
it to Mr. Faulkland.
</p><p>Do not therefore pride yourselves on the
great fortunes you are likely to possess: I
have received no other satisfaction in mind,
than what arose from the benefits I have
conferred on others.
</p><p>By such lessons as these, did this tender
parent endeavour to fortify their young
minds against the vicissitudes of fortune,
and to teach them not to place their confidence
in riches.
</p><p>She dwelt so often upon this theme, that
she seemed to have a presentiment of those
evils, which were now ready to pour in like
a torrent upon her.

<pb n="341"/>
</p><p>Gracious Heaven! how inscrutable are
thy ways!  Her affluent fortune, the very
circumstance which seemed to promise her,
in the eve of life, some compensation for
the miseries she had endured in her early
days, now proved the source of new and
dreadful calamities to her, which, by involving
the unhappy daughters of an unhappy
mother in scenes of the most exquisite
distress, cut off from her even the
last resource of hope in this life, and rendered
the close of her history still more . . .
