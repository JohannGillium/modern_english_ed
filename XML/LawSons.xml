<head>"The Early Married Life of the Morels" </head> 
<pb n="3"/>   
<p>"THE BOTTOMS" succeeded to "Hell Row".  Hell Row was a block  
of thatched, bulging cottages that stood by the brookside on Greenhill   
Lane.  There lived the colliers who worked in the little gin-pits  
two fields away.  The brook ran under the alder trees, scarcely soiled  
by these small mines, whose coal was drawn to the surface by donkeys   
that plodded wearily in a circle round a gin.  And all over the  
countryside were these same pits, some of which had been worked  
in the time of Charles II, the few colliers and the donkeys burrowing   
down like ants into the earth, making queer mounds and little  
black places among the corn-fields and the meadows.  And the cottages   
of these coal-miners, in blocks and pairs here and there, together   
with odd farms and homes of the stockingers, straying over  
the parish, formed the village of Bestwood.  
</p><p>Then, some sixty years ago, a sudden change took place.  The  
gin-pits were elbowed aside by the large mines of the financiers.  The  
coal and iron field of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire was discovered.    
Carston, Waite and Co. appeared.  Amid tremendous excitement,   
Lord Palmerston formally opened the company's first mine  
at Spinney Park, on the edge of Sherwood Forest.  
</p><p>About this time the notorious Hell Row, which through growing  
old had acquired an evil reputation, was burned down, and much  
dirt was cleansed away.  
</p><p>Carston, Waite &amp; Co. found they had struck on a good thing, so,  
down the valleys of the brooks from Selby and Nuttall, new mines were sunk,   
until soon there were six pits working.  From Nuttall,  
high up on the sandstone among the woods, the railway ran, past  
the ruined priory of the Carthusians and past Robin Hood's Well,  
down to Spinney Park, then on to Minton, a large mine among  
corn-fields; from Minton across the farmlands of the valleyside to  
  
  
<pb n="4"/>   
Bunker's Hill, branching off there, and running north to Beggarlee  
and Selby, that looks over at Crich and the hills of Derbyshire: six  
mines like black studs on the countryside, linked by a loop of fine  
chain, the railway.  
</p><p>To accommodate the regiments of miners, Carston, Waite and  
Co. built the Squares, great quadrangles of dwellings on the hillside   
of Bestwood, and then, in the brook valley, on the site of Hell  
Row, they erected the Bottoms.  
</p><p>The Bottoms consisted of six blocks of miners' dwellings, two  
rows of three, like the dots on a blank-six domino, and twelve  
houses in a block.  This double row of dwellings sat at the foot of  
the rather sharp slope from Bestwood, and looked out, from the  
attic windows at least, on the slow climb of the valley towards Selby.  
</p><p>The houses themselves were substantial and very decent.  One  
could walk all round, seeing little front gardens with auriculas and  
saxifrage in the shadow of the bottom block, sweet-williams and  
pinks in the sunny top block; seeing neat front windows, little  
porches, little privet hedges, and dormer windows for the attics.   
But that was outside; that was the view on to the uninhabited parlours   
of all the colliers' wives.  The dwelling-room, the kitchen, was  
at the back of the house, facing inward between the blocks, looking   
at a scrubby back garden, and then at the ash-pits.  And between  
the rows, between the long lines of ash-pits, went the alley, where  
the children played and the women gossiped and the men smoked.   
So, the actual conditions of living in the Bottoms, that was so  
well built and that looked so nice, were quite unsavoury because  
people must live in the kitchen, and the kitchens opened on to that  
nasty alley of ash-pits.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was not anxious to move into the Bottoms, which  
was already twelve years old and on the downward path, when  
she descended to it from Bestwood.  But it was the best she could  
do. Moreover, she had an end house in one of the top blocks, and  
thus had only one neighbour; on the other side an extra strip of  
garden.  And, having an end house, she enjoyed a kind of aristocracy   
among the other women of the "between" houses, because  
her rent was five shillings and sixpence instead of five shillings a  
week.  But this superiority in station was not much consolation to  
Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>She was thirty-one years old, and had been married eight years.  
  
  
<pb n="5"/>   
  
A rather small woman, of delicate mould but resolute bearing, she  
shrank a little from the first contact with the Bottoms women.  She  
came down in the July, and in the September expected her third  
baby.  
</p><p>Her husband was a miner.  They had only been in their new  
home three weeks when the wakes, or fair, began.  Morel, she  
knew, was sure to make a holiday of it.  He went off early on the  
Monday morning, the day of the fair.  The two children were highly  
excited.  William, a boy of seven, fled off immediately after breakfast,   
to prowl round the wakes ground, leaving Annie, who was  
only five, to whine all morning to go also.  Mrs. Morel did her work.   
She scarcely knew her neighbours yet, and knew no one with whom  
to trust the little girl.  So she promised to take her to the wakes after   
dinner.  
</p><p>William appeared at half-past twelve.  He was a very active lad,  
fair-haired, freckled, with a touch of the Dane or Norwegian about  
him.  
</p><p>"Can I have my dinner, mother?" he cried, rushing in with his  
cap on.  "'Cause it begins at half-past one, the man says so."  
</p><p>"You can have your dinner as soon as it's done," replied the  
mother.  
</p><p>"Isn't it done?" he cried, his blue eyes staring at her in   
indignation.  "Then I'm goin' be-out it."  
</p><p>"You'll do nothing of the sort.  It will be done in five minutes.   
It is only half-past twelve."  
</p><p>"They'll be beginnin'," the boy half cried, half shouted.  
</p><p>"You won't die if they do," said the mother.  "Besides, it's  
only half-past twelve, so you've a full hour."  
</p><p>The lad began hastily to lay the table, and directly the three sat  
down.  They were eating batter-pudding and jam, when the boy  
jumped off his chair and stood perfectly stiff.  Some distance away  
could be heard the first small braying of a merry-go-round, and  
the tooting of a horn.  His face quivered as he looked at his mother.  
</p><p>"I told you!" he said, running to the dresser for his cap.  
</p><p>"Take your pudding in your hand-and it's only five past one,  
so you were wrong-you haven't got your twopence," cried the  
mother in a breath.  
</p><p>The boy came back, bitterly disappointed, for his twopence, then  
went off without a word.</p>  
  
<pb n="6"/>   
<p>"I want to go, I want to go," said Annie, beginning to cry.  
</p><p>"Well, and you shall go, whining, wizzening little stick!" said  
the mother.  And later in the afternoon she trudged up the hill  
under the tall hedge with her child.  The hay was gathered from  
the fields, and cattle were turned on to the eddish.  It was  
warm, peaceful.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel did not like the wakes.  There were two sets of  
horses, one going by steam, one pulled round by a pony; three organs   
were grinding, and there came odd cracks of pistol-shots,  
fearful screeching of the cocoanut man's rattle, shouts of the Aunt  
Sally man, screeches from the peep-show lady.  The mother perceived   
her son gazing enraptured outside the Lion Wallace booth,  
at the pictures of this famous lion that had killed a negro and  
maimed for life two white men.  She left him alone, and went to  
get Annie a spin of toffee.  Presently the lad stood in front of her,  
wildly excited.  
</p><p>"You never said you was coming &mdash; isn't the' a lot of things? &mdash;  
that lion's killed three men &mdash; l've spent my tuppence &mdash; an' look  
here."  
</p><p>He pulled from his pocket two egg-cups, with pink moss-roses  
on them.  
</p><p>"I got these from that stall where y'ave ter get them marbles in  
them holes.  An' I got these two in two goes &mdash; 'aepenny a go &mdash; they've  
got moss-roses on, look here.  I wanted these."  
</p><p>She knew he wanted them for her.  
</p><p>"H'm!" she said, pleased.  "They are pretty!"  
</p><p>"Shall you carry 'em, 'cause I'm frightened o' breakin' 'em?"  
</p><p>He was tipful of excitement now she had come, led her about  
the ground, showed her everything.  Then, at the peep-show, she  
explained the pictures, in a sort of story, to which he listened as if  
spellbound.  He would not leave her.  All the time he stuck close to  
her, bristling with a small boy's pride of her.  For no other woman  
looked such a lady as she did, in her little black bonnet and her  
cloak.  She smiled when she saw women she knew.  When she was  
tired she said to her son:  
</p><p>"Well, are you coming now, or later?"  
</p><p>"Are you goin' a'ready?" he cried, his face full of reproach.  
</p><p>"Already? It is past four, I know."  
</p><p>"What are you goin' a'ready for?" he lamented.</p>  
  
<pb n="7"/>   
<p>"You needn't come if you don't want," she said.  
</p><p>And she went slowly away with her little girl, whilst her son  
stood watching her, cut to the heart to let her go, and yet unable to leave   
the wakes.  As she crossed the open ground in front of the  
Moon and Stars she heard men shouting, and smelled the beer,  
and hurried a little, thinking her husband was probably in the bar.  
</p><p>At about half-past six her son came home, tired now, rather  
pale, and somewhat wretched.  He was miserable, though he did  
not know it, because he had let her go alone.  Since she had gone,  
he had not enjoyed his wakes.  
</p><p>"Has my dad been?" he asked.  
</p><p>"No," said the mother.  
</p><p>"He's helping to wait at the Moon and Stars.  I seed him through  
that black tin stuff wi' holes in, on the window, wi' his sleeves  
rolled up."  
</p><p>"Ha!" exclaimed the mother shortly.  "He's got no money.  An'  
he'll be satisfied if he gets his 'lowance, whether they give him  
more or not."  
</p><p>When the light was fading, and Mrs. Morel could see no more  
to sew, she rose and went to the door.  Everywhere was the sound  
of excitement, the restlessness of the holiday, that at last infected  
her.  She went out into the side garden.  Women were coming home  
from the wakes, the children hugging a white lamb with green legs,  
or a wooden horse.  Occasionally a man lurched past, almost as  
full as he could carry.  Sometimes a good husband came along with  
his family, peacefully.  But usually the women and children were  
alone.  The stay-at-home mothers stood gossiping at the corners  
of the alley, as the twilight sank, folding their arms under their  
white aprons.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was alone, but she was used to it.  Her son and her  
little girl slept upstairs; so, it seemed, her home was there behind  
her, fixed and stable.  But she felt wretched with the coming child.   
The world seemed a dreary place, where nothing else would happen   
for her &mdash; at least until William grew up.  But for herself, nothing  
but this dreary endurance &mdash; till the children grew up.  And the children!   
She could not afford to have this third.  She did not want it.   
The father was serving beer in a public house, swilling himself  
drunk.  She despised him, and was tied to him.  This coming child  
was too much for her.  If it were not for William and Annie, she  
  
  
<pb n="8"/>   
  
was sick of it, the struggle with poverty and  ugliness  and  meanness.  
</p><p>She went into the front garden, feeling too heavy to take herself  
out, yet unable to stay indoors.  The heat suffocated her.  And looking   
ahead, the prospect of her life made her feel as if she  
were buried alive.  
</p><p>The front garden was a small square with a privet hedge.  There   
she stood, trying to soothe herself with the scent of flowers and  
the fading, beautiful evening.  Opposite her small gate was the  
stile that led uphill, under the tall hedge between the burning glow  
of the cut pastures.  The sky overhead throbbed and pulsed with  
light.  The glow sank quickly off the field; the earth and the hedges  
smoked dusk.  As it grew dark, a ruddy glare came out on the hilltop,   
and out of the glare the diminished commotion of the fair.  
</p><p>Sometimes, down the trough of darkness formed by the path  
under the hedges, men came lurching home.  One young man  
lapsed into a run down the steep bit that ended the hill, and went  
with a crash into the stile.  Mrs. Morel shuddered.  He picked himself   
up, swearing viciously, rather pathetically, as if he thought the  
stile had wanted to hurt him.  
</p><p>She went indoors, wondering if things were never going to alter.   
She was beginning by now to realise that they would not.  She  
seemed so far away from her girlhood, she wondered if it were the  
same person walking heavily up the back garden at the Bottoms as  
had run so lightly up the breakwater at Sheerness ten years before.  
</p><p>"What have I to do with it?" she said to herself.  "What have I  
to do with all this? Even the child I am going to have! It doesn't  
seem as if I were taken into account."  
</p><p>Sometimes life takes hold of one, carries the body along, accom-plishes one's history, and yet is not real, but leaves oneself as it  
were slurred over.  
</p><p>"I wait," Mrs. Morel said to herself &mdash; "I wait, and what I wait  
for can never come."  
</p><p>Then she straightened the kitchen, lit the lamp, mended the fire,  
looked out the washing for the next day, and put it to soak.  After  
which she sat down to her sewing.  Through the long hours her  
needle flashed regularly through the stuff.  Occasionally she sighed,  
moving to relieve herself.  And all the time she was thinking how  
to make the most of what she had, for the children's sakes.  
</p><p>At half-past eleven her husband came.  His cheeks were very  
  
  
<pb n="9"/>   
red and very shiny above his black moustache.  His head nodded  
slightly.  He was pleased with himself.  
</p><p>"Oh! Oh! waitin' for me, lass? I've bin 'elpin' Anthony, an'  
what's think he's gen me? Nowt b'r a lousy hae'f-crown, an' that's  
ivry penny &mdash; "  
</p><p>"He thinks you've made the rest up in beer," she said shortly.  
</p><p>"An' I 'aven't &mdash; that I 'aven't.  You b'lieve me, I've 'ad very little  
this day, I have an' all." His voice went tender.  "Here, an' I browt  
thee a bit o' brandysnap, an' a cocoanut for th' children." He laid  
the gingerbread and the cocoanut, a hairy object, on the table. "Nay, tha   
niver said thankyer for nowt i' thy life, did ter?"  
</p><p>As a compromise, she picked up the cocoanut and shook it,  
to see if it had any milk.  
</p><p>"It's a good 'un, you may back yer life o' that.  I got it fra' Bill  
Hodgkisson.  'Bill,' I says, 'tha non wants them three nuts, does  
ter? Arena ter for gi'ein' me one for my bit of a lad an' wench?' 'I  
ham, Walter, my lad,' 'e says; 'ta'e which on 'em ter's a mind.' An'  
so I took one, an' thanked 'im.  I didn't like ter shake it afore 'is  
eyes, but 'e says, 'Thad better ma'e sure it's a good un, Walt.' An'  
so, yer see, I knowed it was.  He's a nice chap, is Bill Hodgkisson,  
le's a nice chap!"  
</p><p>"A man will part with anything so long as he's drunk, and you're  
drunk along with him," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy, who's drunk, I sh'd like ter know?"  
said Morel.  He was extraordinarily pleased with himself, because  
of his day's helping to wait in the Moon and Stars.  He chattered  
on.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel, very tired, and sick of his babble, went to bed as  
quickly as possible, while he raked the fire.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel came of a good old burgher family, famous independents   
who had fought with Colonel Hutchinson, and who  
remained stout Congregationalists.  Her grandfather had gone  
bankrupt in the lace-market at a time when so many lace-manufacturers were ruined in Nottingham.  Her father, George  
Coppard, was an engineer &mdash; a large, handsome, haughty man,  
proud of his fair skin and blue eyes, but more proud still of his  
integrity.  Gertrude resembled her mother in her small build.  But  
her temper, proud and unyielding, she had from the Coppards.  
</p><p>George Coppard was bitterly galled by his own poverty.  He became  
  
<pb n="10"/>   
  
foreman of the engineers in the dockyard at Sheerness.  Mrs.  
Morel&mdash; Gertrude &mdash; was the second daughter.  She favoured her  
mother, loved her mother best of all; but she had the Coppards'  
clear, defiant blue eyes and their broad brow.  She remembered to  
have hated her father's overbearing manner towards her gentle,  
humorous, kindly-souled mother.  She remembered running over  
the breakwater at Sheerness and finding the boat.  She remembered  
to have been petted and flattered by an the men when she had gone  
to the dockyard, for she was a delicate, rather proud child.  She  
remembered the funny old mistress, whose assistant she bad become,   
whom she had loved to help in the private school.  And she  
still had the Bible that John Field had given her.  She used to walk  
home from chapel with John Field when she was nineteen.  He was   
the son of a well-to-do tradesman, had been to college in London,  
and was to devote himself to business.  
</p><p>She could always recall in detail a September Sunday afternoon,  
when they had sat under the vine at the back of her father's house.   
The sun came through the chinks of the vine-leaves and made  
beautiful patterns, like a lace scarf, falling on her and on him.  Some  
of the leaves were clean yellow, like yellow flat flowers.  
</p><p>"Now sit still," he had cried.  "Now your hair, I don't know what  
it is like! It's as bright as copper and gold, as red as burnt copper,  
and it has gold threads where the sun shines on it.  Fancy their saying   
it's brown.  Your mother calls it mouse-colour."  
</p><p>She had met his brilliant eyes, but her clear face scarcely showed  
the elation which rose within her.  
</p><p>"But you say you don't like business," she pursued.  
</p><p>"I don't.  I hate it!" he cried hotly.  
</p><p>"And you would like to go into the ministry," she half implored.  
</p><p>"I should.  I should love it, if I thought I could make a first-rate  
preacher."  
</p><p>"Then why don't you &mdash; why don't you?" Her voice rang with defiance.    
"if I were a man, nothing would stop me."  
</p><p>She held her head erect.  He was rather timid before her.  
</p><p>"But my father's so stiff-necked.  He means to put me into the  
business, and I know he'll do it."  
</p><p>"But if you're a man?" she had cried.  
</p><p>"Being a man isn't everything," he replied, frowning with puzzled   
helplessness.</p>  
  
<pb n="11"/>   
  
<p>Now, as she moved about her work at the Bottoms, with some  
experience of what being a man meant, she knew that it was not  
everything.  
</p><p>At twenty, owing to her health, she had left Sheerness.  Her father   
had retired home to Nottingham.  John Field's father had been  
ruined; the son had gone as a teacher in Norwood.  She did not  
hear of him until, two years later, she made determined inquiry.   
He had married his landlady, a woman of forty, a widow with  
property.  
</p><p>And still Mrs. Morel preserved John Field's Bible.  She did not  
now believe him to be &mdash;  Well, she understood pretty well what  
he might or might not have been.  So she preserved his Bible, and  
kept his memory intact in her heart, for her own sake.  To her dying   
day, for thirty-five years, she did not speak of him.  
</p><p>When she was twenty-three years old, she met, at a Christmas  
party, a young man from the Erewash Valley.  Morel was then   
twenty-seven years old.  He was well set-up, erect, and very smart.   
He had wavy black hair that shone again, and a vigorous black  
beard that had never been shaved.  His cheeks were ruddy, and his  
red, moist mouth was noticeable because he laughed so often and  
so heartily.  He had that rare thing, a rich, ringing laugh.  Gertrude  
Coppard had watched him, fascinated.  He was so full of colour  
and animation, his voice ran so easily into comic grotesque, he  
was so ready and so pleasant with everybody.  Her own father had  
a rich fund of humour, but it was satiric.  This man's was different:  
soft, non-intellectual, warm, a kind of gambolling.  
</p><p>She herself was opposite.  She had a curious, receptive mind  
which found much pleasure and amusement in listening to other  
folk.  She was clever in leading folk to talk.  She loved ideas, and  
was considered very intellectual.  What she liked most of all was  
an argument on religion or philosophy or politics with some educated   
man.  This she did not often enjoy.  So she always had people  
tell her about themselves, finding her pleasure so.  
</p><p>In her person she was rather small and delicate, with a large  
brow, and dropping bunches of brown silk curls.  Her blue eyes  
were very straight, honest, and searching.  She had the beautiful  
hands of the Coppards.  Her dress was always subdued.  She wore  
dark blue silk, with a peculiar silver chain of silver scallops.  This,  
and a heavy brooch of twisted gold, was her only ornament.  She  
  
  
<pb n="12"/>   
  
was still perfectly intact, deeply religious, and full of beautiful  
candour.  
</p><p>Walter Morel seemed melted away before her.  She was to the  
miner that thing of mystery and fascination, a lady.  When she  
spoke to him, it was with a southern pronunciation and a purity  
of English which thrilled him to hear.  She watched him.  He danced  
well, as if it were natural and joyous in him to dance.  His grandfather   
was a French refugee who had married an English barmaid  
&mdash; if it had been a marriage.  Gertrude Coppard watched the young  
miner as he danced, a certain subtle exultation like glamour in  
his movement, and his face the flower of his body, ruddy, with  
tumbled black hair, and laughing alike whatever partner he bowed  
above.  She thought him rather wonderful, never having met anyone   
like him.  Her father was to her the type of all men.  And  
George Coppard, proud in his bearing, handsome, and rather  
bitter; who preferred theology in reading, and who drew near in  
sympathy only to one man, the Apostle Paul; who was harsh in  
government, and in familiarity ironic; who ignored all sensuous  
pleasure: &mdash; he was very different from the miner.  Gertrude herself   
was rather contemptuous of dancing; she had not the slightest  
inclination towards that accomplishment, and had never learned  
even a Roger de Coverley.  She was puritan, like her father, high-minded, and really stern.  Therefore the dusky, golden softness of  
this man's sensuous flame of life, that flowed off his flesh like the  
flame from a candle, not baffled and gripped into incandescence  
by thought and spirit as her life was, seemed to her something wonderful,   
beyond her.  
</p><p>He came and bowed above her.  A warmth radiated through  
her as if she had drunk wine.  
</p><p>"Now do come and have this one wi' me," he said caressively.   
"It's easy, you know.  I'm pining to see you dance."  
</p><p>She had told him before she could not dance.  She glanced at  
his humility and smiled.  Her smile was very beautiful.  It moved  
the man so that he forgot everything.  
</p><p>"No, I won't dance," she said softly.  Her words came clean  
and ringing.  
</p><p>Not knowing what he was doing-he often did the right thing by  
instinct &mdash; he sat beside her, inclining reverentially.  
</p><p>"But you mustn't miss your dance," she reproved.  
  
  
<pb n="13"/>   
"Nay, I don't want to dance that &mdash; it's not one as I care about."  
</p><p>"Yet you invited me to it."  
</p><p>He laughed very heartily at this.  
</p><p>"I never thought o' that.  Tha'rt not long in taking the curl out  
of me."  
</p><p>It was her turn to laugh quickly.  
</p><p>"You don't look as if you'd come much uncurled," she said.  
</p><p>"I'm like a pig's tail, I curl because I canna help it," he laughed,  
rather boisterously.  
</p><p>"And you are a miner!" she exclaimed in surprise.  
</p><p>"Yes.  I went down when I was ten."  
</p><p>She looked at him in wondering dismay.  
</p><p>"When you were ten! And wasn't it very hard?" she asked.  
</p><p>"You soon get used to it.  You live like th' mice, an' you pop  
out at night to see what's going on."  
</p><p>"It makes me feel blind," she frowned.  
</p><p>"Like a moudiwarp!" he laughed.  "Yi, an' there's some chaps  
as does go round like moudiwarps." He thrust his face forward  
in the blind, snout-like way of a mole, seeming to sniff and peer  
for direction.  "They dun though!" he protested naively.  "Tha niver  
seed such a way they get in.  But tha mun let me ta'e thee down  
some time, an' tha can see for thysen."  
</p><p>She looked at him, startled.  This was a new tract of life   
suddenly opened before her.  She realised the life of the miners, hundreds  
of them toiling below earth and coming up at evening.  He seemed  
to her noble.  He risked his life daily, and with gaiety.  She looked  
at him, with a touch of appeal in her pure humility.  
</p><p>"Shouldn't ter like it?" he asked tenderly.  "'Appen not, it 'ud  
dirty thee."  
</p><p>She had never been "thee'd" and "thou'd" before.  
</p><p>The next Christmas they were married, and for three months  
she was perfectly happy: for six months she was very happy.  
</p><p>He had signed the pledge, and wore the blue ribbon of a tee-totaller: he was nothing if not showy.  They lived, she thought, in  
his own house.  It was small, but convenient enough, and quite  
nicely furnished, with solid, worthy stuff that suited her honest  
soul.  The women, her neighbours, were rather foreign to her,  
and Morel's mother and sisters were apt to sneer at her ladylike  
  
  
<pb n="14"/>   
  
ways.  But she could perfectly well live by herself, so long as she  
had her husband close.  
</p><p>Sometimes, when she herself wearied of love-talk, she tried to  
open her heart seriously to him.  She saw him listen deferentially,  
but without understanding.  This killed her efforts at a finer intimacy,   
and she had flashes of fear.  Sometimes he was restless of  
an evening: it was not enough for him just to be near her, she realised.    
She was glad when he set himself to little jobs.  
</p><p>He was a remarkably handy man &mdash; could make or mend anything.    
So she would say:  
</p><p>"I do like that coal-rake of your mother's &mdash; it is small and natty."  
</p><p>"Does ter, my wench? Well, I made that, so I can make thee  
one! "  
</p><p>"What! why, if s a steel one!"  
</p><p>"An' what if it is! Tha s'lt ha'e one very similar, if not exactly  
same."  
</p><p>She did not mind the mess, nor the hammering and noise.  He  
was busy and happy.  
</p><p>But in the seventh month, when she was brushing his Sunday  
coat, she felt papers in the breast pocket, and, seized with a sudden   
curiosity, took them out to read.  He very rarely wore the frock-coat he was married in: and it had not occurred to her before to  
feel curious concerning the papers.  They were the bills of the  
household furniture, still unpaid.  
</p><p>"Look here," she said at night, after he was washed and had  
had his dinner.  "I found these in the pocket of your wedding-coat.   
Haven't you settled the bills yet?"  
</p><p>"No.  I haven't had a chance."  
</p><p>"But you told me all was paid.  I had better go into Nottingham  
on Saturday and settle them.  I don't like sitting on another man's  
chairs and eating from an unpaid table."  
</p><p>He did not answer.  
</p><p>"I can have your bank-book, can't I?"  
</p><p>"Tha can ha'e it, for what good it'll be to thee."  
</p><p>"I thought &mdash; " she began.  He had told her he had a good bit of  
money left over.  But she realised it was no use asking questions.   
She sat rigid with bitterness and indignation.  
</p><p>The next day she went down to see his mother.  
</p><p>"Didn't you buy the furniture for Walter?" she asked.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="15"/>   
  
<p>"Yes, I did," tartly retorted the elder woman.  
</p><p>"And how much did he give you to pay for it?"  
</p><p>The elder woman was stung with fine indignation.  
</p><p>"Eighty pound, if you're so keen on knowin'," she replied.  
</p><p>"Eighty pounds! But there are forty-two pounds still owing!"  
</p><p>"I can't help that."  
</p><p>"But where has it all gone?"  
</p><p>"You'll find all the papers, I think, if you look &mdash; beside ten  
pound as he owed me, an' six pound as the wedding cost down  
here."  
</p><p>"Six pounds!" echoed Gertrude Morel.  It seemed to her monstrous   
that, after her own father had paid so heavily for her wedding,   
six pounds more should have been squandered in eating and  
drinking at Walter's parents' house, at his expense.  
</p><p>"And how much has he sunk in his houses?" she asked.  
</p><p>"His houses &mdash; which houses?"  
</p><p>Gertrude Morel went white to the lips.  He had told her the  
house he lived in, and the next one, was his own.  
</p><p>"I thought the house we live in &mdash; " she began.  
</p><p>"They're my houses, those two," said the mother-in-law.  "And  
not clear either.  It's as much as I can do to keep the mortgage interest   
paid."  
</p><p>Gertrude sat white and silent.  She was her father now.  
</p><p>"Then we ought to be paying you rent," she said coldly.  
</p><p>"Walter is paying me rent," replied the mother.  
</p><p>"And what rent?" asked Gertrude.  
</p><p>"Six and six a week," retorted the mother.  
</p><p>It was more than the house was worth.  Gertrude held her head  
erect, looked straight before her.  
</p><p>"It is lucky to be you," said the elder woman, bitingly, "to   
have a husband as takes all the worry of the money, and leaves you a  
free hand."  
</p><p>The young wife was silent.  
</p><p>She said very little to her husband, but her manner had  
changed towards him.  Something in her proud, honourable soul  
had crystallised out hard as rock.  
</p><p>When October came in, she thought only of Christmas.  Two  
years ago, at Christmas, she had met him.  Last Christmas she had  
married him.  This Christmas she would bear him a child.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="16"/>   
  
<p>"You don't dance yourself, do you, missis?" asked her nearest  
neighbour, in October, when there was great talk of opening a  
dancing-class over the Brick and Tile Inn at Bestwood.  
</p><p>"No &mdash; I never had the least inclination to," Mrs. Morel replied.  
</p><p>"Fancy! An' how funny as you should ha' married your Mester.    
You know he's quite a famous one for dancing."  
</p><p>"I didn't know he was famous," laughed Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Yea, he is though! Why, he ran that dancing-class in the  
Miners' Arms club-room for over five year."  
</p><p>"Did he?"  
</p><p>"Yes, he did." The other woman was defiant.  "An' it was  
thronged every Tuesday, and Thursday, an' Sat'day &mdash; an' there was  
carryin's-on, accordin' to all accounts."  
</p><p>This kind of thing was gall and bitterness to Mrs. Morel, and  
she had a fair share of it.  The women did not spare her, at first;  
for she was superior, though she could not help it.  
</p><p>He began to be rather late in coming home.  
</p><p>"They're working very late now, aren't they?" she said to her  
washer-woman.  
</p><p>"No later than they alters do, I don't think.  But they stop to have  
their pint at Ellen's, an' they get talkin', an' there you are! Dinner  
stone cold &mdash; an' it serves 'em right."  
</p><p>"But Mr. Morel does not take any drink."  
</p><p>The woman dropped the clothes, looked at Mrs. Morel, then  
went on with her work, saying nothing.  
</p><p>Gertrude Morel was very ill when the boy was born.  Morel was  
good to her, as good as gold.  But she felt very lonely, miles away  
from her own people.  She felt lonely with him now, and his presence   
only made it more intense.  
</p><p>The boy was small and frail at first, but he came on quickly.  He  
was a beautiful child, with dark gold ringlets, and dark-blue eyes  
which changed gradually to a clear grey.  His mother loved him  
passionately: He came just when her own bitterness of disillusion   
was hardest to bear; when her faith in fife was shaken, and her  
soul felt dreary and lonely.  She made much of the child, and the  
father was jealous.  
</p><p>At last Mrs. Morel despised her husband.  She turned to the  
child; she turned from the father.  He had begun to neglect her;  
the novelty of his own home was gone.  He had no grit, she said  
  
  
<pb n="17"/>   
bitterly to herself.  What he felt just at the minute, that was all to  
him.  He could not abide by anything.  There was nothing at the  
back of all his show.  
</p><p>There began a battle between the husband and wife &mdash; a fearful,  
bloody battle that ended only with the death of one.  She fought to  
make him undertake his own responsibilities, to make him fulfill  
his obligations.  But he was too different from her.  His nature was  
purely sensuous, and she strove to make him moral, religious.  She  
tried to force him to face things.  He could not endure it &mdash; it drove  
him out of his mind.  
</p><p>While the baby was still tiny, the father's temper had become  
so irritable that it was not to be trusted.  The child had only to give  
a little trouble when the man began to bully.  A little more, and the  
hard hands of the collier hit the baby.  Then Mrs. Morel loathed  
her husband, loathed him for days; and he went out and drank;  
and she cared very little what he did.  Only, on his return, she  
scathed him with her satire.  
</p><p>The estrangement between them caused him, knowingly or unknowingly,   
grossly to offend her where he would not have done.  
</p><p>William was only one year old, and his mother was proud of  
him, he was so pretty.  She was not well off now, but her sisters  
kept the boy in clothes.  Then, with his little white hat curled with  
an ostrich feather, and his white coat, he was a joy to her, the twining   
wisps of hair clustering round his head.  Mrs. Morel lay listening,   
one Sunday morning, to the chatter of the father and child  
downstairs.  Then she dozed off.  When she came downstairs, a  
great fire glowed in the grate, the room was hot, the breakfast was  
roughly laid, and seated in his arm-chair, against the chimney-piece, sat Morel, rather timid; and standing between his legs, the  
child &mdash; cropped like a sheep, with such an odd round poll &mdash; looking  
wondering at her; and on a newspaper spread out upon the hearth-rug, a myriad of crescent-shaped curls, like the petals of a marigold   
scattered in the reddening firelight.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel stood still.  It was her first baby.  She went very  
white, and was unable to speak.  
</p><p>"What dost think o' 'im?" Morel laughed uneasily.  
</p><p>She gripped her two fists, lifted them, and came forward.    
Morel shrank back.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="18"/>   
  
<p>"I could kill you, I could!" she said.  She choked with rage, her  
two fists uplifted.  
</p><p>"Yer non want ter make a wench on 'im," Morel said, in a  
frightened tone, bending his head to shield his eyes from hers. His  
attempt at laughter had vanished.  
</p><p>The mother looked down at the jagged, close-clipped head of  
her child.  She put her hands on his hair, and stroked and fondled  
his head.  
</p><p>"Oh &mdash; my boy!" she faltered.  Her lip trembled, her face broke,  
and, snatching up the child, she buried her face in his shoulder  
and cried painfully.  She was one of those women who cannot cry;  
whom it hurts as it hurts a man.  It was like ripping something out  
of her, her sobbing.  
</p><p>Morel sat with his elbows on his knees, his hands gripped together   
till the knuckles were white.  He gazed in the fire, feeling  
almost stunned, as if he could not breathe.  
</p><p>Presently she came to an end, soothed the child and cleared  
away the breakfast-table.  She left the newspaper, littered with  
curls, spread upon the hearth-rug.  At last her husband gathered  
it up and put it at the back of the fire.  She went about her work  
with closed mouth and very quiet.  Morel was subdued.  He crept  
about wretchedly, and his meals were a misery that day.  She spoke  
to him civilly, and never alluded to what he had done.  But he felt  
something final had happened.  
</p><p>Afterwards she said she bad been silly, that the boy's hair would  
have had to be cut, sooner or later.  In the end, she even brought  
herself to say to her husband it was just as well he had played barber   
when he did.  But she knew, and Morel knew, that that act had  
caused something momentous to take place in her soul.  She remembered   
the scene all her life, as one in which she had suffered  
the most intensely.  
</p><p>This act of masculine clumsiness was the spear through the side  
of her love for Morel.  Before, while she had striven against him  
bitterly, she had fretted after him, as if he had gone astray from  
her.  Now she ceased to fret for his love: he was an outsider to her.   
This made life much more bearable.  
</p><p>Nevertheless, she still continued to strive with him.  She still  
had her high moral sense, inherited from generations of Puritans.   
It was now a religious instinct, and she was almost a fanatic with  
  
<pb n="19"/>   
  
him, because she loved him, or had loved him.  If he sinned, she  
tortured him.  If be drank, and lied, was often a poltroon, sometimes   
a knave, she wielded the lash unmercifully.  
</p><p>The pity was, she was too much his opposite.  She could not be  
content with the little he might be; she would have him the much  
that he ought to be.  So, in seeking to make him nobler than  
he could be, she destroyed him.  She injured and hurt and scarred  
herself, but she lost none of her worth.  She also had the children.  
</p><p>He drank rather heavily, though not more than many miners,  
and always beer, so that whilst his health was affected, it was never  
injured.  The week-end was his chief carouse.  He sat in the Miners'  
Arms until turning-out time every Friday, every Saturday, and  
every Sunday evening.  On Monday and Tuesday he had to get  
up and reluctantly leave towards ten o'clock.  Sometimes he stayed  
at home on Wednesday and Thursday evenings, or was only out  
for an hour.  He practically never had to miss work owing to his  
drinking.  
</p><p>But although he was very steady at work, his wages fell off.  He  
was blab-mouthed, a tongue-wagger.  Authority was hateful to him,  
therefore he could only abuse the pit-managers.  He would say, in  
the Palmerston:  
</p><p>"Th' gaffer come down to our stall this morning, an' 'e says,  
'You know, Walter, this 'ere'll not do.  What about these props?'  
An' I says to him, 'Why, what art talkin' about? What d'st mean  
about th' props?' 'It'n never do, this 'ere,' 'e says.  'You'll be havin'  
th' roof in, one o' these days.' An' I says, 'Tba'd better stan' on a  
bit o' clunch, then, an' hold it up wi' thy 'ead.' So 'e wor that mad,  
'e cossed an' 'e swore, an' t'other chaps they did laugh." Morel  
was a good mimic.  He imitated the manager's fat, squeaky voice,  
with its attempt at good English.  
</p><p>"'I shan't have it, Walter.  Who knows more about it, me or  
you?' So I says, 'I've niver fun out how much tha' knows, Alfred.   
It'll 'appen carry thee ter bed an' back."'  
</p><p>So Morel would go on to the amusement of his boon companions.    
And some of this would be true.  The pit-manager was not  
an educated man.  He had been a boy along with Morel, so that,  
while the two disliked each other, they more or less took each  
other for granted.  But Alfred Charlesworth did not forgive the  
butty these public-house sayings.  Consequently, although Morel  
  
  
<pb n="20"/>   
  
was a good miner, sometimes earning as much as five pounds a   
week when he married, he came gradually to have worse and  
worse stalls, where the coal was thin, and hard to get, and  
unprofitable.  
</p><p>Also, in summer, the pits are slack.  Often, on bright sunny  
mornings, the men are seen trooping home again at ten, eleven,  
or twelve o'clock.  No empty trucks stand at the pit-mouth.  The  
women on the hillside look across as they shake the hearth-rug  
against the fence, and count the wagons the engine is taking along  
the line up the valley.  And the children, as they come from school  
at dinner-time, looking down the fields and seeing the wheels on  
the headstocks standing, say:  
</p><p>"Minton's knocked off.  My dad'll be at home."  
</p><p>And there is a sort of shadow over all, women and children and  
men, because money will be short at the end of the week.  
</p><p>Morel was supposed to give his wife thirty shillings a week, to  
provide everything-rent, food, clothes, clubs, insurance, doctors.   
Occasionally, if he were flush, he gave her thirty-five.  But these  
occasions by no means balanced those when he gave her twenty-five.  In winter, with a decent stall, the miner might eam fifty or  
fifty-five shillings a week.  Then he was happy.  On Friday night,  
Saturday, and Sunday, he spent royally, getting rid of his sovereign   
or thereabouts.  And out of so much, he scarcely spared the  
children an extra penny or bought them a pound of apples.  It all  
went in drink.  In the bad times, matters were more worrying, but  
he was not so often drunk, so that Mrs. Morel used to say:  
</p><p>"I'm not sure I wouldn't rather be short, for when he's flush,  
there isn't a minute of peace."  
</p><p>If he earned forty shillings he kept ten; from thirty-five he kept  
five; from thirty-two he kept four; from twenty-eight he kept  
three; from twenty-four he kept two; from twenty he kept one-and-six; from eighteen he kept a shilling; from sixteen he kept  
sixpence.  He never saved a penny, and he gave his wife no opportunity   
of saving; instead, she had occasionally to pay his debts;  
not public-house debts, for those never were passed on to the  
women, but debts when he had bought a canary, or a fancy  
walking-stick.  
</p><p>At the wakes time Morel was working badly, and Mrs. Morel  
was trying to save against her confinement.  So it galled her bitterly  
  
  
  
  
  
<pb n="21"/>   
to think he should be out taking his pleasure and spending money,  
whilst she remained at home, harassed.  There were two days' holiday.    
On the Tuesday morning Morel rose early.  He was in good  
spirits.  Quite early, before six o'clock, she heard him whistling  
away to himself downstairs.  He had a pleasant way of whistling,  
lively and musical.  He nearly always whistled hymns.  He had been  
a choir-boy with a beautiful voice, and had taken solos in Southwell   
cathedral.  His morning whistling alone betrayed it.  
</p><p>His wife lay listening to him tinkering away in the garden, his  
whistling ringing out as he sawed and hammered away.  It always  
gave her a sense of warmth and peace to hear him thus as she lay  
in bed, the children not yet awake, in the bright early morning,  
happy in his man's fashion.  
</p><p>At nine o'clock, while the children with bare legs and feet were  
sitting playing on the sofa, and the mother was washing up, he  
came in from his carpentry, his sleeves rolled up, his waistcoat  
hanging open.  He was still a good-looking man, with black, wavy  
hair, and a large black moustache.  His face was perhaps too much  
inflamed, and there was about him a look almost of peevishness.   
But now he was jolly.  He went straight to the sink where his wife  
was washing up.  
</p><p>"What, are thee there!" he said boisterously.  "Sluthe off an' let  
me wesh mysen."  
</p><p> "You may wait till I've finished," said his wife.  
</p><p> "Oh, mun I? An' what if I shonna?"  
</p><p> This good-humoured threat amused Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Then you can go and wash yourself in the soft-water tub."  
</p><p> "Ha! I can' an' a', tha mucky little 'ussy."  
</p><p>With which he stood watching her a moment, then went away  
to wait for her.  
</p><p>When he chose he could still make himself again a real gallant.   
Usually he preferred to go out with a scarf round his neck.  Now,  
however, he made a toilet.  There seemed so much gusto in the  
way he puffed and swilled as he washed himself, so much alacrity  
with which he hurried to the mirror in the kitchen, and, bending  
because it was too low for him, scrupulously parted his wet black  
hair, that it irritated Mrs. Morel.  He put on a turn-down collar,  
a black bow, and wore his Sunday tail-coat.  As such, he looked

spruce, and what his clothes would not do, his instinct for making  
the most of his good looks would.  
</p><p>At half-past nine Jerry Purdy came to call for his pal.  Jerry  
was Morel's bosom friend, and Mrs. Morel disliked him.  He was  
a tall, thin man, with a rather foxy face, the kind of face that seems  
to lack eyelashes.  He walked with a stiff, brittle dignity, as if his  
head were on a wooden spring.  His nature was cold and shrewd.   
Generous where he intended to be generous, he seemed to be very  
fond of Morel, and more or less to take charge of him.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel hated him.  She had known his wife, who had died  
of consumption, and who had, at the end, conceived such a violent  
dislike of her husband, that if he came into her room it caused her  
haemorrhage.  None of which Jerry had seemed to mind.  And now  
his eldest daughter, a girl of fifteen, kept a poor house for him,  
and looked after the two younger children.  
</p><p>"A mean, wizzen-hearted stick!" Mrs. Morel said of him.  
</p><p>"I've never known Jerry mean in my life," protested Morel.   
"A opener-handed and more freer chap you couldn't find anywhere,   
accordin' to my knowledge."  
</p><p>"Open-handed to you," retorted Mrs. Morel.  "But his fist is  
shut tight enough to his children, poor things."  
</p><p>"Poor things! And what for are they poor things, I should like  
to know."  
</p><p>But Mrs. Morel would not be appeased on Jerry's score.   
</p><p> The subject of argument was seen, craning his thin neck over  
the scullery curtain.  He caught Mrs. Morel's eye.  
</p><p> "Mornin', missis! Mester in?"  
</p><p> "Yes &mdash; he is."  
</p><p>Jerry entered unasked, and stood by the kitchen doorway.  He  
was not invited to sit down, but stood there, coolly asserting the  
rights of men and husbands.  
</p><p> "A nice day," he said to Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Yes.  
</p><p> "Grand out this morning &mdash; grand for a walk."  
</p><p> "Do you mean you're going for a walk?" she asked.  
</p><p> "Yes.  We mean walkin' to Nottingham," he replied.  
</p><p> "H'm!"  
</p><p> The two men greeted each other, both glad: Jerry, however, full  
of assurance, Morel rather subdued, afraid to seem too jubilant in  
  
  
<pb n="23"/>   
  
presence of his wife.  But he laced his boots quickly, with spirit.   
They were going for a ten-mile walk across the fields to Nottingham.    
Climbing the hillside from the Bottoms, they mounted gaily  
into the morning.  At the Moon and Stars they had their first drink,  
then on to the Old Spot.  Then a long five miles of drought to carry  
them into Bulwell to a glorious pint of bitter.  But they stayed in  
a field with some haymakers whose gallon bottle was full, so that,  
when they came in sight of the city, Morel was sleepy.  The town  
spread upwards before them, smoking vaguely in the midday glare,  
fridging the crest away to the south with spires and factory bulks  
and chimneys.  In the last field Morel lay down under an oak tree  
and slept soundly for over an hour.  When he rose to go forward  
he felt queer.  
</p><p>The two had dinner in the Meadows, with Jerry's  sister, then  
repaired to the Punch Bowl, where they mixed in the excitement  
of pigeon-racing.  Morel never in his life played cards,  considering  
them as having some occult, malevolent power &mdash; "the devil's pictures,"   
he called them! But he was a master of skittles and of dominoes.    
He took a challenge from a Newark man, on skittles.  All the  
men in the old, long bar took sides, betting either one way or  
the other.  Morel took off his coat.  Jerry held the hat containing the  
money.  The men at the tables watched.  Some stood with their mugs  
in their hands.  Morel felt his big wooden ball carefully, then  
launched it.  He played havoc among the nine-pins, and won half  
a crown, which restored him to solvency.  
</p><p>By seven o'clock the two were in good condition.  They caught  
the 7.30 train home.  
</p><p>In the afternoon the Bottoms was intolerable.  Every inhabitant  
remaining was out of doors.  The women, in twos and threes, bareheaded   
and in white aprons, gossiped in the alley between the  
blocks.  Men, having a rest between drinks, sat on their heels and  
talked.  The place smelled stale; the slate roofs glistered in the and  
heat.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel took the little girl down to the brook in the meadows,   
which were not more than two hundred yards away.  The  
water ran quickly over stones and broken pots.  Mother and child  
leaned on the rail of the old sheep-bridge, watching.  Up at the  
dipping-hole, at the other end of the meadow, Mrs. Morel could  
see the naked forms of boys flashing round the deep yellow water,  
  
  
<pb n="24"/>   
  
or an occasional bright figure dart glittering over the blackish stagnant   
meadow.  She knew William was at the dipping-hole, and it  
was the dread of her life lest he should get drowned.  Annie played  
under the tall old hedge, picking up alder cones, that she called  
currants.  The child required much attention, and the flies were  
teasing.  
</p><p>The children were put to bed at seven o'clock.  Then she worked  
awhile.  
</p><p>When Walter Morel and Jerry arrived at Bestwood they felt a  
load off their minds; a railway journey no longer impended, so  
they could put the finishing touches to a glorious day.  They entered   
the Nelson with the satisfaction of returned travellers.  
</p><p>The next day was a work-day, and the thought of it put a  
damper on the men's spirits.  Most of them, moreover, had spent  
their money.  Some were already rolling dismally home, to sleep  
in preparation for the morrow.  Mrs. Morel, listening to their  
mournful singing, went indoors.  Nine o'clock passed, and ten, and  
still "the pair" had not returned.  On a doorstep somewhere a man  
was singing loudly, in a drawl: "Lead, kindly Light." Mrs. Morel  
was always indignant with the drunken men that they must sing  
that hymn when they got maudlin.  
</p><p>"As if 'Genevieve' weren't good enough," she said.  
</p><p>The kitchen was full of the scent of boiled herbs and hops.  On  
the hob a large black saucepan steamed slowly.  Mrs. Morel took  
a panchion, a great bowl of thick red earth, streamed a heap of  
white sugar into the bottom, and then, straining herself to the  
weight, was pouring in the liquor.  
</p><p>Just then Morel came in.  He had been very jolly in the Nelson,  
but coming home had grown irritable.  He had not quite got over  
the feeling of irritability and pain, after having slept on the ground  
when he was so hot; and a bad conscience afflicted him as he  
neared the house.  He did not know he was angry.  But when the  
garden gate resisted his attempts to open it, he kicked it and broke  
the latch.  He entered just as Mrs. Morel was pouring the infusion  
of herbs out of the saucepan.  Swaying slightly, he lurched against  
the table.  The boiling liquor pitched.  Mrs. Morel started back.  
</p><p>"Good gracious," she cried, "coming home in his drunkenness!"  
</p><p> "Comin' home in his what?" he snarled, his hat over his eye.   
</p><p> Suddenly her blood rose in a jet.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="25"/>   
<p> "Say you're not drunk!" she flashed.  
</p><p>She had put down her saucepan, and was stirring the sugar into  
the beer.  He dropped his two hands heavily on the table, and  
thrust his face forwards at her.  
</p><p>"'Say you're not drunk,'" he repeated.  "Why, nobody but a  
nasty little bitch like you 'ud 'ave such a thought."  
</p><p> He thrust his face forward at her.  
</p><p>"There's money to bezzle with, if there's money for nothing  
else."  
</p><p>"I've not spent a two-shillin' bit this day," he said.  
</p><p>"You don't get as drunk as a lord on nothing," she replied.   
"And," she cried, flashing into sudden fury, "if you've been  
sponging on your beloved Jerry, why, let him look after his children,   
for they need it."  
</p><p>"It's a lie, it's a lie.  Shut your face, woman."  
</p><p>They were now at battle-pitch.  Each forgot everything save the  
hatred of the other and the battle between them.  She was fiery and  
furious as he.  They went on till he caned her a liar.  
</p><p>"No," she cried, starting up, scarce able to breathe.  "Don't call  
me that &mdash; you, the most despicable liar that ever walked in shoe-leather." She forced the last words out of suffocated lungs.  
</p><p>"You're a liar!" he yelled, banging the table with his fist.   
"You're a liar, you're a liar."  
</p><p> She stiffened herself, with clenched fists.  
</p><p>"The house is filthy with you," she cried.  
</p><p>"Then get out on it &mdash; it's mine.  Get out on it!" he shouted.  "It's  
me as brings th' money whoam, not thee.  It's my house, not thine.   
Then ger out on't &mdash; ger out on't!"  
</p><p>"And I would," she cried, suddenly shaken into tears of impotence.    
"Ah, wouldn't I, wouldn't I have gone long ago, but for  
those children.  Ay, haven't I repented not going years ago, when  
I'd only the one" &mdash; suddenly drying into rage.  "Do you think it's  
for you I stop &mdash; do you think I'd stop one minute for you?"  
</p><p>"Go, then," he shouted, beside himself.  "Go!"  
</p><p>"No!" She faced round.  "No," she cried loudly, "you shan't  
have it all your own way; you shan't do all you like.  I've got those  
children to see to.  My word," she laughed, "I should look well to  
leave them to you."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="26"/>   
  
<p>"Go," he cried thickly, lifting his fist.  He was afraid of her.   
"Go!"  
  
</p><p>"I should be only too glad.  I should laugh, laugh, my lord, if I  
could get away from you," she replied.  
</p><p>He came up to her, his red face, with its bloodshot eyes, thrust  
forward, and gripped her arms.  She cried in fear of him, struggled  
to be free.  Coming slightly to himself, panting, he pushed her  
roughly to the outer door, and thrust her forth, slotting the bolt  
behind her with a bang.  Then he went back into the kitchen,  
dropped into his arm-chair, his head, bursting full of blood, sinking   
between his knees.  Thus he dipped gradually into a stupor,  
from exhaustion and intoxication.  
</p><p>The moon was high and magnificent in the August night.  Mrs.  
Morel, seared with passion, shivered to find herself out there in a  
great white light, that fell cold on her, and gave a shock to her inflamed   
soul.  She stood for a few moments helplessly staring at the  
glistening great rhubarb leaves near the door.  Then she got the  
air into her breast.  She walked down the garden path, trembling  
in every limb, while the child boiled within her.  For a while she  
could not control her consciousness; mechanically she went over  
the last scene, then over it again, certain phrases, certain moments  
coming each time like a brand red-hot down on her soul; and each  
time she enacted again the past hour, each time the brand came  
down at the same points, till the mark was burnt in, and the pain  
burnt out, and at last she came to herself.  She must have been half  
an hour in this delirious condition.  Then the presence of the night  
came again to her.  She glanced round in fear.  She had wandered  
to the side garden, where she was walking up and down the path  
beside the currant bushes under the long wall.  The garden was a  
narrow strip, bounded from the road, that cut transversely between  
the blocks, by a thick thorn hedge.  
</p><p>She hurried out of the side garden to the front, where she could  
stand as if in an immense gulf of white light, the moon streaming  
high in face of her, the moonlight standing up from the hills in  
front, and filling the valley where the Bottoms crouched, almost  
blindingly.  There, panting and half weeping in reaction from the  
stress, she murmured to herself over and over again: "The nuisance!   
the nuisance!"  
</p><p> She became aware of something about her.  With an effort she  
  
  
<pb n="27"/>   
  
roused herself to see what it was that penetrated her consciousness.    
The tall white lilies were reeling in the moonlight, and the  
air was charged with their perfume, as with a presence.  Mrs.  
Morel gasped slightly in fear.  She touched the big, pallid flowers  
on their petals, then shivered.  They seemed to be stretching in  
the moonlight.  She put her hand into one white bin: the gold  
scarcely showed on her fingers by moonlight.  She bent down to  
look at the binful of yellow pollen; but it only appeared dusky.   
Then she drank a deep draught of the scent.  It almost made her  
dizzy.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel leaned on the garden gate, looking out, and she lost  
herself awhile.  She did not know what she thought.  Except for a  
slight feeling of sickness, and her consciousness in the child, herself   
melted out like scent into the shiny, pale air.  After a time the  
child, too, melted with her in the mixing-pot of moonlight, and  
she rested with the hills and lilies and houses, all swum together  
in a kind of swoon.  
</p><p>When she came to herself she was tired for sleep.  Languidly  
she looked about her; the clumps of white phlox seemed like  
bushes spread with linen; a moth ricochetted over them, and right  
across the garden.  Following it with her eye roused her.  A few  
whiffs of the raw, strong scent of phlox invigorated her.  She passed  
along the path, hesitating at the white rose-bush.  It smelled sweet  
and simple.  She touched the white ruffles of the roses.  Their fresh  
scent and cool, soft leaves reminded her of the morning-time and  
sunshine.  She was very fond of them.  But she was tired, and  
wanted to sleep.  In the mysterious out-of-doors she felt forlorn.  
</p><p>There was no noise anywhere.  Evidently the children had not  
been wakened, or had gone to sleep again.  A train, three miles  
away, roared across the valley.  The night was very large, and very  
strange, stretching its hoary distances infinitely.  And out of the  
silver-grey fog of darkness came sounds vague and hoarse: a corncrake   
not far off, sound of a train like a sigh, and distant shouts of  
men.  
</p><p>Her quietened heart beginning to beat quickly again, she hurried   
down the side garden to the back of the house.  Softly she  
lifted the latch; the door was still bolted, and hard against her.  She  
rapped gently, waited, then rapped again.  She must not rouse the  
children, nor the neighbours.  He must be asleep, and he would  
  
  
<pb n="28"/>   
  
not wake easily.  Her heart began to burn to be indoors.  She clung  
to the door-handle.  Now it was cold; she would take a chill, and  
in her present condition!  
</p><p>Putting her apron over her head and her arms, she hurried again  
to the side garden, to the window of the kitchen.  Leaning on the  
sill, she could just see, under the blind, her husband's arms spread  
out on the table, and his black head on the board.  He was sleeping  
with his face lying on the table.  Something in his attitude made her  
feel tired of things.  The lamp was burning smokily; she could tell  
by the copper colour of the light.  She tapped at the window more  
and more noisily.  Almost it seemed as if the glass would break.   
Still he did not wake up.  
</p><p>After vain efforts, she began to shiver, partly from contact with  
the stone, and from exhaustion.  Fearful always for the unborn  
child, she wondered what she could do for warmth.  She went down  
to the coal-house, where there was an old hearth-rug she had carried   
out for the rag-man the day before.  This she wrapped over  
her shoulders.  It was warm, if grimy.  Then she walked up and  
down the garden path, peeping every now and then under the  
blind, knocking, and telling herself that in the end the very strain of  
his position must wake him.  
</p><p>At last, after about an hour, she rapped long and low at the  
window.  Gradually the sound penetrated to him.  When, in despair,  
she had ceased to tap, she saw him stir, then lift his face blindly.   
The labouring of his heart hurt him into consciousness.  She rapped  
imperatively at the window.  He started awake.  Instantly she saw  
his fists set and his eyes glare.  He had not a grain of physical fear.   
If it had been twenty burglars, he would have gone blindly for  
them.  He glared round, bewildered, but prepared to fight.  
</p><p>"Open the door, Walter," she said coldly.  
</p><p>His hands relaxed.  It dawned on him what he had done.  His  
head dropped, sullen and dogged.  She saw him hurry to the door,  
heard the bolt chock.  He tried the latch.  It opened &mdash; and there  
stood the silver-grey night, fearful to him, after the tawny light of  
the lamp.  He hurried back.  
</p><p>When Mrs. Morel entered, she saw him almost running through  
the door to the stairs.  He had ripped his collar off his neck in his  
haste to be gone ere she came in, and there it lay with bursten  
button-holes.  It made her angry.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="29"/>     
  
<p>She warmed and soothed herself.  In her weariness forgetting  
everything, she moved about at the little tasks that remained to be  
done, set his breakfast, rinsed his pit-bottle, put his pit-clothes  
on the hearth to warm, set his pit-boots beside them, put him out  
a clean scarf and snap-bag and two apples, raked the fire, and went  
to bed.  He was already dead asleep.  His narrow black eyebrows  
were drawn up in a sort of peevish misery into his forehead while  
his cheeks' down-strokes, and his sulky mouth, seemed to be saying:   
"I don't care who you are nor what you are, I shall have my  
own way."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel knew him too well to look at him.  As she unfastened   
her brooch at the mirror, she smiled faintly to see her face  
all smeared with the yellow dust of lilies.  She brushed it off, and at  
last lay down.  For some time her mind continued snapping and  
jetting sparks, but she was asleep before her husband awoke from  
the first sleep of his drunkenness.</p>  
  
  
</div2><div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d7">  
<head>"The Birth of Paul, and Another Battle" </head> 
  
<p>AFTER such a scene as the last, Walter Morel was for some days  
abashed and ashamed, but he soon regained his old bullying indifference.    
Yet there was a slight shrinking, a diminishing in his  
assurance.  Physically even, he shrank, and his fine full presence  
waned.  He never grew in the least stout, so that, as he sank from  
his erect, assertive bearing, his physique seemed to contract along  
with his pride and moral strength.  
</p><p>But now he realised how hard it was for his wife to drag about  
at her work, and, his sympathy quickened by penitence, hastened  
forward with his help.  He came straight home from the pit, and  
stayed in at evening till Friday, and then he could not remain at  
home.  But he was back again by ten o'clock, almost quite sober.  
</p><p>He always made his own breakfast.  Being a man who rose early  
and had plenty of time he did not, as some miners do, drag his  
wife out of bed at six o'clock.  At five, sometimes earlier, he woke,  
got straight out of bed, and went downstairs.  When she could not  
sleep, his wife lay waiting for this time, as for a period of peace.  
  
  
<pb n="30"/>   
  
The only real rest seemed  to  be  when  he  was  out  of  the  house.  
</p><p>He went downstairs in his shirt and then struggled into his pit-trousers, which were left on the hearth to warm all night.  There  
was always a fire, because Mrs. Morel raked.  And the first sound  
in the house was the bang, bang of the poker against the raker, as  
Morel smashed the remainder of the coal to make the kettle, which  
was filled and left on the hob, finally boil.  His cup and knife and  
fork, all he wanted except just the food, was laid ready on the  
table on a newspaper.  Then he got his breakfast, made the tea,  
packed the bottom of the doors with rugs to shut out the draught,  
piled a big fire, and sat down to an hour of joy.  He toasted  
his bacon on a fork and caught the drops of fat on his bread; then  
he put the rasher on his thick slice of bread, and cut off chunks  
with a clasp-knife, poured his tea into his saucer, and was happy.   
With his family about, meals were never so pleasant.  He loathed a  
fork: it is a modern introduction which has still scarcely reached  
common people.  What Morel preferred was a clasp-knife.  Then,  
in solitude, he ate and drank, often sitting, in cold weather, on a  
little stool with his back to the warm chimney-piece, his food on  
the fender, his cup on the hearth.  And then he read the last night's  
newspaper &mdash; what of it he could &mdash; spelling it over laboriously.  He  
preferred to keep the blinds down and the candle lit even when it  
was daylight; it was the habit of the mine.  
</p><p>At a quarter to six he rose, cut two thick slices of bread and  
butter, and put them in the white calico snap-bag.  He filled his tin  
bottle with tea.  Cold tea without milk or sugar was the drink he  
preferred for the pit.  Then he pulled off his shirt, and put on his  
pit-singlet, a vest of thick flannel cut low round the neck, and with  
short sleeves like a chemise.  
</p><p>Then he went upstairs to his wife with a cup of tea because she  
was ill, and because it occurred to him.  
</p><p> "I've brought thee a cup o' tea, lass," he said.  
</p><p> "Well, you needn't, for you know I don't like it," she replied.  
</p><p> "Drink it up; it'll pop thee off to sleep again."  
</p><p> She accepted the tea.  It pleased him to see her take it and sip  
it.  
</p><p> "I'll back my life there's no sugar in," she said.  
</p><p> "Yi &mdash; there's one big 'un," he replied, injured.  
</p><p> "It's a wonder," she said, sipping again.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="31"/>   
  
<p>She had a winsome face when her hair was loose.  He loved her  
to grumble at him in this manner.  He looked at her again,  
and went, without any sort of leave-taking.  He never took more  
than two slices of bread and butter to eat in the pit, so an apple  
or an orange was a treat to him.  He always liked it when she put  
one out for him.  He tied a scarf round his neck, put on his great,  
heavy boots, his coat, with the big pocket, that carried his snap-bag and his bottle of tea, and went forth into the fresh morning  
air, closing, without locking, the door behind him.  He loved the  
early morning, and the walk across the fields.  So he appeared at the  
pit-top, often with a stalk from the hedge between his teeth, which  
he chewed all day to keep his mouth moist, down the mine, feeling   
quite as happy as when he was in the field.  
</p><p>Later, when the time for the baby grew nearer, he would bustle  
round in his slovenly fashion, poking out the ashes, rubbing the  
fireplace, sweeping the house before he went to work.  Then, feeling   
very self-righteous, he went upstairs.  
</p><p>"Now I'm cleaned up for thee: tha's no 'casions ter stir a peg  
all day, but sit and read thy books."  
</p><p> Which made her laugh, in spite of her indignation.  
</p><p> "And the dinner cooks itself?" she answered.  
</p><p> "Eh, I know nowt about th' dinner."  
</p><p> "You'd know if there weren't any."  
</p><p> "Ay, 'appen so," he answered, departing.  
</p><p>When she got downstairs, she would find the house tidy, but  
dirty.  She could not rest until she had thoroughly cleaned; so she  
went down to the ash-pit with her dust-pan.  Mrs. Kirk, spying her,  
would contrive to have to go to her own coal-place at that minute.   
Then, across the wooden fence, she would call:  
</p><p> "So you keep wagging on, then?"  
</p><p>"Ay," answered Mrs. Morel deprecatingly.  "There's nothing  
else for it."  
</p><p>"Have you seen Hose?" called a very small woman from across  
the road.  It was Mrs. Anthony, a black-haired, strange little body,  
who always wore a brown velvet dress, tight fitting.  
</p><p> "I haven't," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Eh, I wish he'd come.  I've got a copperful of clothes, an' I'm  
sure I heered his bell."  
</p><p> Hark! He's at the end."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="32"/>   
  
<p>The two women looked down the alley.  At the end of the  
Bottoms a man stood in a sort of old-fashioned trap, bending over  
bundles of cream-coloured stuff; while a cluster of women held  
up their arms to him, some with bundles.  Mrs. Anthony herself  
had a heap of creamy, undyed stockings hanging over her arm.  
</p><p>"I've done ten dozen this week," she said proudly to Mrs.  
Morel.  
</p><p> "T-t-t!" went the other.  "I don't know how you can find time."  
</p><p> "Eh!" said Mrs. Anthony.  "You can find time if you make  
time."  
</p><p>"I don't know how you do it," said Mrs. Morel.  "And how much  
shall you get for those many?"  
</p><p> "Tuppence &mdash; ha'penny a dozen," replied the other.  
</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Morel.  "l'd starve before I'd sit down and  
seam twenty-four stockings for twopence ha'penny."  
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," said Mrs. Anthony.  "You can rip along  
with 'em."  
</p><p>Hose was coming along, ringing his bell.  Women were waiting  
at the yard-ends with their seamed stockings hanging over their  
arms.  The man, a common fellow, made jokes with them, tried to  
swindle them, and bullied them.  Mrs. Morel went up her yard  
disdainfully.  
</p><p>It was an understood thing that if one woman wanted her  
neighbour, she should put the poker in the fire and bang at the  
back of the fireplace, which, as the fires were back to back, would  
make a great noise in the adjoining house.  One morning Mrs. Kirk,  
mixing a pudding, nearly started out of her skin as she heard the  
thud, thud, in her grate.  With her hands all floury, she rushed to  
the fence.  
</p><p> "Did you knock, Mrs. Morel?"  
</p><p> "If you wouldn't mind, Mrs. Kirk."  
</p><p>Mrs. Kirk climbed on to her copper, got over the wall on to  
Mrs. Morel's copper, and ran in to her neighbour.  
</p><p> "Eh, dear, how are you feeling?" she cried in concern.  
</p><p> "You might fetch Mrs. Bower," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>Mrs. Kirk went into the yard, lifted up her strong, shrill voice,  
and called:  
</p><p> "Ag-gie &mdash; Ag-gie!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="33"/>   
  
<p>The sound was heard from one end of the Bottoms to the other.   
At last Aggie came running up, and was sent for Mrs. Bower,  
whilst Mrs. Kirk left her pudding and stayed with her neighbour.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel went to bed.  Mrs. Kirk had Annie and William for  
dinner.  Mrs. Bower, fat and waddling, bossed the house.  
</p><p>"Hash some cold meat up for the master's dinner, and make  
him an apple-charlotte pudding," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"He may go without pudding this day," said Mrs. Bower.  
</p><p>Morel was not as a rule one of the first to appear at the bottom  
of the pit, ready to come up.  Some men were there before four  
o'clock, when the whistle blew loose-all; but Morel, whose stall,  
a poor one, was at this time about a mile and a half away from the  
bottom, worked usually till the first mate stopped, then he finished  
also.  This day, however, the miner was sick of the work.  At two  
o'clock he looked at his watch, by the light of the green candle &mdash;  
he was in a safe working &mdash; and again at half-past two.  He was hewing   
at a piece of rock that was in the way for the next day's work.   
As he sat on his heels, or kneeled, giving hard blows with his pick,  
"Uszza &mdash; uszza!" he went.  
</p><p> "Shall ter finish, Sorry?" cried Barker, his fellow butty.  
</p><p> "Finish? Niver while the world stands!" growled Morel.  
</p><p> And he went on striking.  He was tired.  
</p><p> "It's a heart-breaking job," said Barker.  
</p><p>But Morel was too exasperated, at the end of his tether, to answer.    
Still be struck and hacked with all his might.  
</p><p>"Tha might as well leave it, Walter," said Barker.  "It'll do to-morrow, without thee hackin' thy guts out."  
</p><p> "I'll lay no b &mdash;  finger on this to-morrow, Isr'el!" cried Morel.  
</p><p> "Oh, well, if tha wunna, somebody else'll ha'e to," said Israel.  
</p><p> Then Morel continued to strike.  
</p><p> "Hey &mdash; up there &mdash; loose-a'!" cried the men, leaving  the    
next  stall.  
</p><p> Morel continued to strike.  
</p><p>"Tha'll happen catch me up," said Barker, departing.  
</p><p>When he had gone, Morel, left alone, felt savage.  He had not  
finished his job.  He had overworked himself into a frenzy.  Rising,  
wet with sweat, he threw his tool down, pulled on his coat, blew  
out his candle, took his lamp, and went.  Down the main road the  
lights of the other men went swinging.  There was a hollow sound  
of many voices.  It was a long, heavy tramp underground.</p>  
  
<pb n="34"/>   
  
<p>He sat at the bottom of the pit, where the great drops of water  
fell plash.  Many colliers were waiting their turns to go up, talking  
noisily.  Morel gave his answers short and disagreeable.  
</p><p>"It's rainin', Sorry," said old Giles, who had had the news from  
the top.  
</p><p>Morel found one comfort.  He had his old umbrella, which he  
loved, in the lamp cabin.  At last he took his stand on the chair,  
and was at the top in a moment.  Then he handed in his lamp and  
got his umbrella, which he had bought at an auction for one-and-six.  He stood on the edge of the pit-bank for a moment, looking  
out over the fields; grey rain was falling.  The trucks stood full of  
wet, bright coal.  Water ran down the sides of the waggons, over  
the white "C.W. and Co.". Colliers, walking indifferent to the rain,  
were streaming down the line and up the field, a grey, dismal host.   
Morel put up his umbrella, and took pleasure from the peppering  
of the drops thereon.  
</p><p>All along the road to Bestwood the miners tramped, wet and grey  
and dirty, but their red mouths talking with animation.  Morel also  
walked with a gang, but he said nothing.  He frowned peevishly as  
he went.  Many men passed into the Prince of Wales or into  
Ellen's.  Morel, feeling sufficiently disagreeable to resist temptation,   
trudged along under the dripping trees that overhung the park  
wall, and down the mud of Greenhill Lane.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel lay in bed, listening to the rain, and the feet of the  
colliers from Minton, their voices, and the bang, bang of the gates  
as they went through the stile up the field.  
</p><p>"There's some herb beer behind the pantry door," she said.   
"Th' master'll want a drink, if he doesn't stop."  
</p><p>But he was late, so she concluded he had called for a drink, since  
it was raining.  What did he care about the child or her?  
</p><p>She was very ill when her children were born.   
</p><p> "What is it?" she asked, feeling sick to death.   
</p><p> "A boy."  
</p><p>And she took consolation in that.  The thought of being the  
mother of men was warming to her heart.  She looked at the child.   
It had blue eyes, and a lot of fair hair, and was bonny.  Her love  
came up hot, in spite of everything.  She had it in bed with her.  
</p><p>Morel, thinking nothing, dragged his way up the garden path,  
wearily and angrily.  He closed his umbrella, and stood it in the  
  
  
<pb n="35"/>   
  
sink; then he sluthered his heavy boots into the kitchen.  Mrs.  
Bower appeared in the inner doorway.  
</p><p>"Well," she said, "she's about as bad as she can be.  It's a boy  
childt."  
</p><p>The miner grunted, put his empty snap-bag and his tin bottle  
on the dresser, went back into the scullery and hung up his coat,  
then came and dropped into his chair.  
</p><p>"Han yer got a drink?" he asked.  
</p><p>The woman went into the pantry.  There was heard the pop of  
a cork.  She set the mug, with a little, disgusted  rap, on the table  
before Morel.  He drank, gasped, wiped his big moustache on the  
end of his scarf, drank, gasped, and lay back in his chair.  The  
woman would not speak to him again.  She set his dinner before  
him, and went upstairs.  
</p><p> "Was that the master?" asked Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "I've gave him his dinner," replied Mrs. Bower.  
</p><p>After he had sat with his arms on the table &mdash; he resented the fact  
that Mrs. Bower put no cloth on for him, and gave him a  
little plate, instead of a full-sized dinner-plate &mdash; he began to eat.   
The fact that his wife was ill, that he had another boy, was nothing  
to him at that moment.  He was too tired; he wanted his dinner;  
he wanted to sit with his arms lying on the board; he did not like  
having Mrs. Bower about.  The fire was too small to please him.  
</p><p>After he had finished his meal, he sat for twenty minutes; then  
he stoked up a big fire.  Then, in his stockinged feet, he went  
reluctantly upstairs.  It was a struggle to face his wife at this moment,   
and he was tired.  His face was black, and smeared with  
sweat.  His singlet had dried again, soaking the dirt in.  He had a  
dirty woollen scarf round his throat.  So he stood at the foot of the  
bed.  
</p><p> "Well, how are ter, then?" he asked.  
</p><p> "I s'll be all right," she answered.  
</p><p> "H'm!"  
</p><p>He stood at a loss what to say next.  He was tired, and this  
bother was rather a nuisance to him, and he didn't quite know  
where he was.  
</p><p> "A lad, tha says," he stammered.  
</p><p> She turned down the sheet and showed the child.</p>  
  
<pb n="35"/>   
  
<p>"Bless him!" he murmured.  Which made her laugh, because he  
blessed by rote &mdash; pretending paternal emotion, which he did not  
feel just then.  
</p><p> "Go now," she said.  
</p><p> "I will, my lass," he answered, turning away.  
</p><p>Dismissed, he wanted to kiss her, but he dared not.  She half  
wanted him to kiss her, but could not bring herself to give any  
sign.  She only breathed freely when he was gone out of the room  
again, leaving behind him a faint smell of pit-dirt.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel had a visit every day from the Congregational  
clergyman.  Mr. Heaton was young, and very poor.  His wife had  
died at the birth of his first baby, so he remained alone in the  
manse.  He was a Bachelor of Arts of Cambridge, very shy, and  
no preacher.  Mrs. Morel was fond of him, and he depended on  
her.  For hours he talked to her, when she was well.  He became the  
god-parent of the child.  
</p><p>Occasionally the minister stayed to tea with Mrs. Morel.  Then  
she laid the cloth early, got out her best cups, with a little green  
rim, and hoped Morel would not come too soon; indeed, if he  
stayed for a pint, she would not mind this day.  She had always  
two dinners to cook, because she believed children should have  
their chief meal at midday, whereas Morel needed his at five  
o'clock.  So Mr. Heaton would hold the baby, whilst Mrs. Morel  
beat up a batter-pudding or peeled the potatoes, and he, watching  
her all the time, would discuss his next sermon.  His ideas were  
quaint and fantastic.  She brought him judiciously to earth.  It was  
a discussion of the wedding at Cana.  
</p><p>"When He changed the water into wine at Cana," he said, "that  
is a symbol that the ordinary life, even the blood, of the married  
husband and wife, which had before been uninspired, like water,  
became filled with the Spirit, and was as wine, because, when love  
enters, the whole spiritual constitution of a man changes, is  
filled with the Holy Ghost, and almost his form is altered."  
</p><p> Mrs. Morel thought to herself:  
</p><p>"Yes, poor fellow, his young wife is dead; that is why he makes  
his love into the Holy Ghost."  
</p><p>They were halfway down their first cup of tea when they heard  
the sluther of pit-boots.  
</p><p> "Good gracious!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel, in spite of herself.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="37"/>   
  
<p>The minister looked rather scared.  Morel entered.  He was feeling   
rather savage.  He nodded a "How dyer do" to the clergyman,  
who rose to shake hands with him.  
</p><p>"Nay," said Morel, showing his hand, "look thee at it! Tha niver  
wants ter shake hands wi' a hand like that, does ter? There's too  
much pick-haft and shovel-dirt on it."  
</p><p>The minister flushed with confusion, and sat down again.  Mrs.  
Morel rose, carried out the steaming saucepan.  Morel took off his  
coat, dragged his armchair to table, and sat down heavily.  
</p><p> "Are you tired?" asked the clergyman.  
</p><p>"Tired? I ham that," replied Morel.  "You don't know what it  
is to be tired, as I'm tired."  
</p><p>"No," replied the clergyman.  
</p><p>"Why, look yer 'ere," said the miner, showing the shoulders of  
his singlet.  "It's a bit dry now, but it's wet as a clout with sweat  
even yet.  Feel it."  
</p><p>"Goodness!" cried Mrs. Morel.  "Mr.  Heaton doesn't want to  
feel your nasty singlet."  
</p><p>The clergyman put out his hand gingerly.  
</p><p>"No, perhaps he doesn't," said Morel; "but it's all come out of  
me, whether or not.  An' iv'ry day alike my singlet's wringin' wet.   
'Aven't you got a drink, Missis, for a man when he comes home  
barkled up from the pit?"  
</p><p>"You know you drank all the beer," said Mrs. Morel, pouring  
out his tea.  
</p><p>"An' was there no more to be got?" Turning to the clergyman &mdash;  
"A man gets that caked up wi' th' dust, you know, &mdash; that clogged  
up down a coal-mine, he needs a drink when he comes home."  
</p><p> "I am sure he does," said the clergyman.  
</p><p> "But it's ten to one if there's owt for him."  
</p><p> "There's water &mdash; and there's tea," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Water! It's not water as'll clear his throat."  
</p><p>He poured out a saucerful of tea, blew it, and sucked it up  
through his great black moustache, sighing afterwards.  Then he  
poured out another saucerful, and stood his cup on the table.  
</p><p> "My cloth!" said Mrs. Morel, putting it on a plate.  
</p><p>"A man as comes home as I do 's too tired to care about cloths,"  
said Morel.  
</p><p> "Pity!" exclaimed his wife, sarcastically.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="38"/>   
  
<p>The room was full of the smell of meat and vegetables and pit-clothes.  
</p><p>He leaned over to the minister, his great moustache thrust forward,   
his mouth very red in his black face.  
</p><p>"Mr.  Heaton," he said, "a man as has been down the black hole  
all day, dingin' away at a coal-face, yi, a sight harder than that  
wall &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Needn't make a moan of it," put in Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>She hated her husband because, whenever he had an audience,  
he whined and played for sympathy.  William, sitting nursing the  
baby, hated him, with a boy's hatred for false sentiment, and for  
the stupid treatment of his mother.  Annie had never liked him; she  
merely avoided him.  
</p><p> When the minister had gone, Mrs. Morel looked at her cloth.  
</p><p> "A fine mess!" she said.  
</p><p>"Dos't think I'm goin' to sit wi' my arms danglin', cos tha's got  
a parson for tea wi' thee?" he bawled.  
</p><p>They were both angry, but she said nothing.  The baby began to  
cry, and Mrs. Morel, picking up a saucepan from the hearth,  
accidentally knocked Annie on the head, whereupon the girl began   
to whine, and Morel to shout at her.  In the midst of this  
pandemonium, William looked up at the big glazed text over the  
mantelpiece and read distinctly:  
</p><p> "God Bless Our Home!"  
</p><p>Whereupon Mrs. Morel, trying to soothe the baby, jumped up,  
rushed at him, boxed his ears, saying:  
</p><p>"What are you putting in for?"  
</p><p>And then she sat down and laughed, till tears ran over her  
cheeks, while William kicked the stool he had been sitting on, and  
Morel growled:  
</p><p>"I canna see what there is so much to laugh at."  
</p><p>One evening, directly after the parson's visit, feeling unable to  
bear herself after another display from her husband, she took  
Annie and the baby and went out.  Morel had kicked William, and  
the mother would never forgive him.  
</p><p>She went over the sheep-bridge and across a corner of the  
meadow to the cricket-ground.  The meadows seemed one space  
of ripe, evening light, whispering with the distant mill-race.  She  
sat on a seat under the alders in the cricket-ground, and fronted  
  
  
<pb n="39"/>   
the evening.  Before her, level and solid, spread the big green  
cricket-field, like the bed of a sea of light.  Children played in the  
bluish shadow of the pavilion.  Many rooks, high up, came cawing   
home across the softly-woven sky.  They stooped in a long  
curve down into the golden glow, concentrating, cawing, wheeling,  
like black flakes on a slow vortex, over a tree clump that made a  
dark boss among the pasture.  
</p><p>A few gentlemen were practising, and Mrs. Morel could hear  
the chock of the ball, and the voices of men suddenly roused;  
could see the white forms of men shifting silently over the green,  
upon which already the under shadows were smouldering.  Away at  
the grange, one side of the haystacks was lit up, the other sides  
blue-grey.  A waggon of sheaves rocked small across the melting  
yellow light.  
</p><p>The sun was going down.  Every open evening, the hills  
of Derbyshire were blazed over with red sunset.  Mrs. Morel  
watched  
the sun sink from the glistening sky, leaving a soft flower-blue  
overhead, while the western space went red, as if all the fire had  
swum down there, leaving the bell cast flawless blue.  The  
mountain-ash berries across the field stood fierily out from the  
dark leaves, for a moment.  A few shocks of corn in a comer of the  
fallow stood up as if alive; she imagined them bowing; perhaps ber  
son would be a Joseph.  In the east, a mirrored sunset floated pink  
opposite the west's scarlet.  The big haystacks on the hillside, that  
butted into the glare, went cold.  
</p><p>With Mrs. Morel it was one of those still moments when the  
small frets vanish, and the beauty of things stands out, and she  
had the peace and the strength to see herself.  Now and again, a  
swallow cut close to her.  Now and again, Annie came up with a  
handful of alder-currants.  The baby was restless on his mother's  
knee, clambering with his hands at the light.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel looked down at him.  She had dreaded this baby like  
a catastrophe, because of ber feeling for her husband.  And now  
she felt strangely towards the infant.  Her heart was heavy because  
of the child, almost as if it were unhealthy, or malformed.  Yet it  
seemed quite well.  But she noticed the peculiar knitting of the  
baby's brows, and the peculiar heaviness of its eyes, as if it were  
trying to understand something that was pain.  She felt, when she  
  
<pb n="40"/>   
  
looked at her child's dark, brooding pupils, as if a burden  were  on  
her heart.  
</p><p>"He looks as if he was thinking about something &mdash; quite sorrowful,"   
said Mrs. Kirk.  
</p><p>Suddenly, looking at him, the heavy feeling at the mother's heart  
melted into passionate grief.  She bowed over him, and a few tears  
shook swiftly out of her very heart.  The baby lifted bis fingers.  
</p><p> "My lamb!" she cried softly.  
</p><p>And at that moment she felt, in some far inner place of her soul,  
that she and her husband were guilty.  
</p><p>The baby was looking up at her.  It had blue eyes like her own,  
but its look was heavy, steady, as if it had realised something that  
had stunned some point of its soul.  
</p><p>In her arms lay the delicate baby.  Its deep blue eyes, always  
looking up at her unblinking, seemed to draw her innermost  
thoughts out of her.  She no longer loved her husband; she had  
not wanted this child to come, and there it lay in her arms  
and pulled at her heart.  She felt as if the navel string that had   
connected its frail little body with hers had not been broken.  A  
wave of hot love went over her to the infant.  She held it close  
to her face  
and breast.  With all her force, with all ber soul she would make  
up to it for having brought it into the world unloved.  She would  
love it all the more now it was here; carry it in her love.  Its clear,  
knowing eyes gave her pain and fear.  Did it know all about her?  
When it lay under her heart, had it been listening then? Was there  
a reproach in the look? She felt the marrow melt in her bones, with  
fear and pain.  
</p><p>Once more she was aware of the sun lying red on the rim of the  
hill opposite.  She suddenly held up the child in her hands.  
</p><p>"Look!" she said.  "Look, my pretty!"  
</p><p>She thrust the infant forward to the crimson, throbbing sun, almost   
with relief.  She saw him lift his little fist.  Then she put him  
to her bosom again, ashamed almost of her impulse to give him  
back again whence he came.  
</p><p>"If he lives," she thought to herself, "what will become of him &mdash;   
what will he be?"  
</p><p> Her heart was anxious.  
</p><p> "I will call him Paul," she said suddenly; she knew not why.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="41"/>   
<p>After a while she went home.  A fine shadow was flung over the  
deep green meadow, darkening all.  
</p><p>As she expected, she found the house empty.  But Morel was  
home by ten o'clock, and that day, at least, ended peacefully.  
</p><p>Walter Morel was, at this time, exceedingly irritable.  His work  
seemed to exhaust him.  When he came home he did not speak  
civilly to anybody.  If the fire were rather low he bullied about that;  
he grumbled about his dinner; if the children made a chatter he  
shouted at them in a way that made their mother's blood boil, and  
made them hate him.  
</p><p>On the Friday, he was not home by eleven o'clock.  The baby  
was unwell, and was restless, crying if he were put down.  Mrs.  
Morel, tired to death, and still weak, was scarcely under control.  
</p><p> "I wish the nuisance would come," she said wearily to herself.  
</p><p>The child at last sank down to sleep in her arms.  She was too  
tired to carry him to the cradle.  
</p><p>"But I'll say nothing, whatever time he comes," she said.  "It  
only works me up; I won't say anything.  But I know if he does  
anything it'll make my blood boil," she added to herself.  
</p><p>She sighed, hearing him coming, as if it were something she  
could not bear.  He, taking his revenge, was nearly drunk.  She kept  
her head bent over the child as he entered, not wishing to see him.   
But it went through her like a flash of hot fire when, in passing, he  
lurched against the dresser, setting the tins rattling, and  
clutched at the white pot knobs for support.  He hung up his  
hat and coat,  
then returned, stood glowering from a distance at her, as she sat  
bowed over the child.  
</p><p>"Is there nothing to eat in the house?" he asked, insolently, as  
if to a servant.  In certain stages of his intoxication he affected the  
clipped, mincing speech of the towns.  Mrs. Morel hated him most  
in this condition.  
</p><p>"You know what there is in the house," she said, so coldly, it  
sounded impersonal.  
</p><p> He stood and glared at her without moving a muscle.  
</p><p>"I asked a civil question, and I expect a civil answer," he said  
affectedly.  
</p><p> "And you got it," she said, still ignoring him.  
</p><p>He glowered again.  Then he came unsteadily forward.  He leaned  
on the table with one hand, and with the other jerked at the table  
  
  
<pb n="42"/>   
  
drawer to get a knife to cut bread.  The drawer stuck because he  
pulled sideways.  In a temper he dragged it, so that it flew out bodily,   
and spoons, forks, knives, a hundred metallic things, splashed  
with a clatter and a clang upon the brick floor.  The baby gave a  
little convulsed start.  
</p><p> "What are you doing, clumsy,  drunken  fool?"  the  mother  cried.  
</p><p>"Then tha should get the flamin' thing thysen.  Tha should get  
up, like other women have to, an' wait on a man."  
</p><p> "Wait on you &mdash; wait on you?" she cried.  "Yes, I see myself."  
</p><p>"Yis, an' I'll learn thee tha's got to.  Wait on me, yes tha sh'lt  
wait on me &mdash; "  
</p><p> "Never, milord.  I'd wait on a dog at the door first."  
</p><p> "What &mdash; what?"  
</p><p>He was trying to fit in the drawer.  At her last speech be turned  
round.  His face was crimson, his eyes bloodshot.  He stared at her  
one silent second in threat.  
</p><p> "P-h!" she went quickly, in contempt.  
</p><p>He jerked at the drawer in his excitement. it fell, cut sharply  
on his shin, and on the reflex he flung it at her.  
</p><p>One of the corners caught her brow as the shallow drawer  
crashed into the fireplace.  She swayed, almost fell stunned from  
her chair.  To her very soul she was sick; she clasped the child  
tightly to her bosom.  A few moments elapsed; then, with an effort,  
she brought herself to.  The baby was crying plantively.  Her left  
brow was bleeding rather profusely.  As she glanced down at the  
child, her brain reeling, some drops of blood soaked into its white  
shawl; but the baby was at least not hurt.  She balanced her head  
to keep equilibrium, so that the blood ran into her eye.  
</p><p>Walter Morel remained as he had stood, leaning on the table  
with one hand, looking blank.  When he was sufficiently sure of  
his balance, he went across to her, swayed, caught hold of the back  
of her rocking-chair, almost tipping her out; then leaning forward  
over her, and swaying as he spoke, he said, in a tone of wondering  
concern:  
</p><p> "Did it catch thee?"  
</p><p>He swayed again, as if he would pitch on to the child.  With the  
catastrophe he had lost all balance.  
</p><p> "Go away," she said, struggling to keep her presence of mind.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="43"/>   
<p>He hiccoughed.  "Let's &mdash; let's look at it," he said, hiccoughing  
again.  
</p><p> "Go away!" she cried.  
</p><p> "Lemme &mdash; lemme look at it, lass."  
</p><p>She smelled him of drink, felt the unequal pull of his swaying  
grasp on the back of her rocking-chair.  
</p><p>"Go away," she said, and weakly she pushed him off.  
</p><p>He stood, uncertain in balance, gazing upon her.  Summoning all  
her strength she rose, the baby on one arm.  By a cruel effort of  
will, moving as if in sleep, she went across to the scullery, where  
she bathed her eye for a minute in cold water; but she was too  
dizzy.  Afraid lest she should swoon, she returned to her rocking-chair, trembling in every fibre.  By instinct, she kept the baby  
clasped.  
</p><p>Morel, bothered, had succeeded in pushing the drawer back  
into its cavity, and was on his knees, groping, with numb paws,  
for the scattered spoons.  
</p><p>Her brow was still bleeding.  Presently Morel got up and came  
craning his neck towards her.  
</p><p>"What has it done to thee, lass?" he asked, in a very wretched,  
humble tone.  
</p><p>"You can see what it's done," she answered.  
</p><p>He stood, bending forward, supported on his hands, which  
grasped his legs just above the knee.  He peered to look at the  
wound.  She drew away from the thrust of his face with its great  
moustache, averting her own face as much as possible.  As he  
looked at her, who was cold and impassive as stone, with mouth  
shut tight, he sickened with feebleness and hopelessness of spirit.   
He was turning drearily away, when he saw a drop of blood fall  
from the averted wound into the baby's fragile, glistening hair.   
Fascinated, he watched the heavy dark drop hang in the glistening  
cloud, and pull down the gossamer.  Another drop fell.  It  
would soak through to the baby's scalp.  He watched,  
fascinated, feeling it soak in; then, finally, his manhood broke.  
</p><p>"What of this child?" was all his wife said to him.  But her low,  
intense tones brought his head lower.  She softened: "Get me some  
wadding out of the middle drawer," she said.  
</p><p> He stumbled away very obediently, presently returning with a  
  
  
<pb n="44"/>   
  
pad, which she singed before the fire, then put on her  forehead,  
as she sat with the baby on her lap.  
</p><p>"Now that clean pit-scarf."  
</p><p>Again he rummaged and fumbled in the drawer, returning  
presently with a red, narrow scarf.  She took it, and with trembling  
fingers proceeded to bind it round her head.  
</p><p> "Let me tie it for thee," he said humbly.  
</p><p>"I can do it myself," she replied.  When it was done she went  
upstairs, telling him to rake the fire and lock the door.  
</p><p>In the morning Mrs. Morel said:  
</p><p>"I knocked against the latch of the coal-place, when I was getting   
a raker in the dark, because the candle blew out." Her two  
small children looked up at her with wide, dismayed eyes.  They  
said nothing, but their parted lips seemed to express the unconscious   
tragedy they felt.  
</p><p>Walter Morel lay in bed next day until nearly dinner-time.  He  
did not think of the previous evening's work.  He scarcely thought  
of anything, but he would not think of that.  He lay and suffered  
like a sulking dog.  He had hurt himself most; and he was the more  
damaged because he would never say a word to her, or express his  
sorrow.  He tried to wriggle out of it.  "It was her own fault," he said  
to himself.  Nothing, however, could prevent his inner consciousness   
inflicting on him the punishment which ate into his spirit like  
rust, and which he could only alleviate by drinking.  
</p><p>He felt as if he had not the initiative to get up, or to say a word,  
or to move, but could only lie like a log.  Moreover, he had himself  
violent pains in the head.  It was Saturday.  Towards noon he rose,  
cut himself food in the pantry, ate it with his head dropped, then  
pulled on his boots, and went out, to return at three o'clock slightly  
tipsy and relieved; then once more straight to bed.  He rose again  
at six in the evening, had tea and went straight out.  
</p><p>Sunday was the same: bed till noon, the Palmerston Arms till 2.30   
dinner, and bed; scarcely a word spoken.  When Mrs. Morel  
went upstairs, towards four o'clock, to put on her Sunday dress,  
he was fast asleep.  She would have felt sorry for him, if he had  
once said, "Wife, I'm sorry." But no; he insisted to himself it  
was her fault.  And so he broke himself.  So she merely left  
him alone. There was this deadlock of passion between them, and she was  
stronger.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="45"/>   
<p>The family began tea.  Sunday was the only day when all sat  
down to meals together.  
</p><p> "Isn't my father going to get up?" asked William.  
</p><p> "Let him lie," the mother replied.  
</p><p>There was a feeling of misery over all the house.  The children  
breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary.  They were  
rather disconsolate, did not know what to do, what to play at.  
</p><p>Immediately Morel woke he got straight out of bed.  That was  
characteristic of him all his fife.  He was all for activity.  The  
prostrated inactivity of two mornings was stifling him.  
</p><p>It was near six o'clock when he got down.  This time be entered  
without hesitation, his wincing sensitiveness having hardened  
again.  He did not care any longer what the family thought or felt.  
</p><p>The tea-things were on the table.  William was reading aloud  
from "The Child's Own", Annie listening and asking eternally  
"why?" Both children hushed into silence as they heard the approaching   
thud of their father's stockinged feet, and shrank as he  
entered.  Yet he was usually indulgent to them.  
</p><p>Morel made the meal alone, brutally.  He ate and drank more  
noisily than he had need.  No one spoke to him.  The family life  
withdrew, shrank away, and became hushed as he entered.  But he  
cared no longer about his alienation.  
</p><p>Immediately he had finished tea he rose with alacrity to go out.   
It was this alacrity, this haste to be gone, which so sickened Mrs.  
Morel.  As she heard him sousing heartily in cold water, heard the  
eager scratch of the steel comb on the side of the bowl, as  
he wetted his hair, she closed her eyes in disgust.  As he bent over,  
lacing bis boots, there was a certain vulgar gusto in his movement  
that divided him from the reserved, watchful rest of the family.   
He always ran away from the battle with himself.  Even in his own  
heart's privacy, he excused himself, saying, "If she hadn't said so-and-so, it would never have happened.  She asked for what she's  
got." The children waited in restraint during his preparations.   
When he had gone, they sighed with relief.  
</p><p>He closed the door behind him, and was glad.  It was a rainy   
evening.  The Palmerston would be the cosier.  He hastened forward in  
anticipation.  All the slate roofs of the Bottoms shone black with  
wet.  The roads, always dark with coal-dust, were full of blackish  
mud.  He hastened along.  The Palmerston windows were steamed  
  
<pb n="46"/>   
  
over.  The passage was paddled with wet feet.  But the air was  
warm, if foul, and full of the sound of voices and the smell of beer  
and smoke.  
</p><p>"What shollt ha'e, Walter?" cried a voice, as soon as Morel   
appeared in the doorway.  
</p><p>"Oh, Jim, my lad, wherever has thee sprung frae?"  
</p><p>The men made a seat for him, and took him in warmly.  He was  
glad.  In a minute or two they had thawed all responsibility out of  
him, all shame, all trouble, and he was clear as a bell for a jolly  
night.  
</p><p>On the Wednesday following, Morel was penniless.  He dreaded  
his wife.  Having hurt her, he hated her.  He did not know what to  
do with himself that evening, having not even twopence with which  
to go to the Palmerston, and being already rather deeply in debt.   
So, while his wife was down the garden with the child, he hunted  
in the top drawer of the dresser where she kept her purse, found  
it, and looked inside.  It contained a half-crown, two halfpennies,  
and a sixpence.  So he took the sixpence, put the purse carefully  
back, and went out.  
</p><p>The next day, when she wanted to pay the greengrocer, she  
looked in the purse for her sixpence, and her heart sank to her  
shoes.  Then she sat down and thought: "Was there a sixpence? I  
hadn't spent it, had I? And I hadn't left it anywhere else?"  
</p><p>She was much put about.  She hunted round everywhere for it.   
And, as she sought, the conviction came into her heart that her  
husband had taken it.  What she had in her purse was all the money  
she possessed.  But that he should sneak it from her thus was unbearable.    
He had done so twice before.  The first time she had not  
accused him, and at the week-end he had put the shilling again  
into her purse.  So that was how she had known he had taken it.   
The second time he had not paid back.  
</p><p>This time she felt it was too much.  When he had had his dinner  
&mdash; he came home early that day &mdash; she said to him coldly:  
</p><p> "Did you take sixpence out of my purse last night?"  
</p><p>"Me!" he said, looking up in an offended way.  "No, I didna! I  
niver clapped eyes on your purse."  
</p><p> But she could detect the lie.  
</p><p> "Why, you know you did," she said quietly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="47"/>   
<p>"I tell you I didna," he shouted.  "Yer at me again, are yer? I've  
had about enough on't."  
</p><p>"So you filch sixpence out of my purse while I'm taking  
the clothes in."  
</p><p>"I'll may yer pay for this," he said, pushing back his chair in  
desperation.  He bustled and got washed, then went determinedly  
upstairs.  Presently he came down dressed, and with a big bundle  
in a blue-checked, enormous handkerchief.  
</p><p>"And now," he said, "you'll see me again when you do."  
</p><p>"It'll be before I want to," she replied; and at that he marched  
out of the house with his bundle.  She sat trembling slightly, but  
her heart brimming with contempt.  What would she do if he went  
to some other pit, obtained work, and got in with another woman?  
But she knew him too well &mdash; he couldn't.  She was dead sure of him.   
Nevertheless her heart was gnawed inside her.  
</p><p> "Where's my dad?" said William, coming in from school.  
</p><p> "He says he's run away," replied the mother.  
</p><p> "Where to?"  
</p><p>"Eh, I don't know.  He's taken a bundle in the blue handkerchief,   
and says he's not coming back."  
</p><p> "What shall we do?" cried the boy.  
</p><p> "Eh, never trouble, he won't go far."  
</p><p> "But if he doesn't come back," wailed Annie.  
</p><p>And she and William retired to the sofa and wept.  Mrs. Morel  
sat and laughed.  
</p><p>"You pair of gabeys!" she exclaimed.  "You'll see him before  
the night's out."  
</p><p>But the children were not to be consoled.  Twilight came on.   
Mrs. Morel grew anxious from very weariness.  One part of her  
said it would be a relief to see the last of him; another part fretted  
because of keeping the children; and inside her, as yet, she could  
not quite let him go.  At the bottom, she knew very well he could  
not go.  
</p><p>When she went down to the coal-place at the end of the garden,  
however, she felt something behind the door.  So she looked.  And  
there in the dark lay the big blue bundle.  She sat on a piece of coal  
and laughed.  Every time she saw it, so fat and yet so ignominious,  
slunk into its comer in the dark, with its ends flopping like dejected   
ears from the knots, she laughed again.  She was relieved.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="48"/>   
  
<p>Mrs. Morel sat waiting.  He had not any money, she knew, so  
if he stopped he was running up a bill.  She was very tired of him  
&mdash; tired to death.  He had not even the courage to carry his bundle  
beyond the yard-end.  
</p><p>As she meditated, at about nine o'clock, he opened the door  
and came in, slinking, and yet sulky.  She said not a word.  He  
took off his coat, and slunk to his arm-chair, where he began  
to take off his boots.  
</p><p>"You'd better fetch your bundle before you take your boots off,"  
she said quietly.  
</p><p>"You may thank your stars I've come back to-night," be said,  
looking up from under his dropped head, sulkily, trying to be  
impressive.  
</p><p>"Why, where should you have gone? You daren't even get your  
parcel through the yard-end," she said.  
</p><p>He looked such a fool she was not even angry with him.  He  
continued to take his boots off and prepare for bed.  
</p><p>"I don't know what's in your blue handkerchief," she said.  "But  
if you leave it the children shall fetch it in the moming."  
</p><p>Whereupon he got up and went out of the house, returning  
presently and crossing the kitchen with averted face, hurrying upstairs.    
As Mrs. Morel saw him slink quickly through the inner  
doorway, holding his bundle, she laughed to herself: but her heart  
was bitter, because she had loved him.</p>

"The Casting Off of Morel &mdash; The Taking on of William" </head> 
  
  
<p>DURING the next week Morel's temper was almost unbearable.   
Like all miners, he was a great lover of medicines, which, strangely  
enough, he would often pay for himself.  
</p><p>"You mun get me a drop o' laxy vitral," he said.  "It's a winder  
as we canna ha'e a sup i' th' 'ouse."  
</p><p>So Mrs. Morel bought him elixir of vitriol, his favourite first  
medicine.  And he made himself a jug of wormwood tea.  He had  
hanging in the attic great bunches of dried herbs: wormwood, rue,  
  
  
<pb n="49"/>   
horehound, elder flowers, parsley-purt, marshmallow, hyssop,  
dandelion, and centaury.  Usually there was a jug of one or other  
decoction standing on the hob, from which he drank largely.  
</p><p>"Grand!" he said, smacking his lips after wormwood.  "Grand!"  
And he exhorted the children to try.  
</p><p>"It's better than any of your tea or your cocoa stews," he vowed.   
But they were not to be tempted.  
</p><p>This time, however, neither pills nor vitriol nor all his herbs  
would shift the "nasty peens in his head".  He was sickening for  
an attack of an inflammation of the brain.  He had never been  
well since his sleeping on the ground when he went with Jerry  
to Nottingham.  Since then he had drunk and stormed.  Now he fell  
seriously ill, and Mrs. Morel had him to nurse.  He was one of the  
worst patients imaginable.  But, in spite of all, and putting aside the  
fact that he was bread-winner, she never quite wanted him to die.   
Still there was one part of her wanted him for herself.  
</p><p>The neighbours were very good to her: occasionally some bad  
the children in to meals, occasionally some would do the downstairs   
work for her, one would mind the baby for a day.  But it was  
a great drag, nevertheless.  It was not every day the neighbours  
helped.  Then she had nursing of baby and husband, cleaning and  
cooking, everything to do.  She was quite worn out, but she did  
what was wanted of her.  
</p><p>And the money was just sufficient.  She bad seventeen shillings  
a week from clubs, and every Friday Barker and the other butty  
put by a portion of the    stall's profits for Morel's wife.  And the  
neighbours made broths, and gave eggs, and such invalids' trifles.   
If they had not helped her so generously in those times, Mrs.  
Morel would never have pulled through, without incurring debts  
that would have dragged her down.  
</p><p>The weeks passed.  Morel, almost against hope, grew better.   
He had a fine constitution, so that, once on the mend, he went  
straight forward to recovery.  Soon he was pottering about downstairs.    
During his illness his wife had spoilt him a little.  Now he  
wanted ber to continue.  He often put his band to his head, pulled  
down the comers of his mouth, and shammed pains he did not  
feel.  But there was no deceiving her.  At first she merely smiled to  
herself.  Then she scolded him sharply.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="50"/>   
  
<p> "Goodness, man, don't be so lachrymose."  
</p><p>That wounded him slightly, but still he continued to feign  
sickness.  
</p><p> "I wouldn't be such a mardy baby," said the wife shortly.  
</p><p>Then he was indignant, and cursed under his breath, like a boy.  
He was forced to resume a normal tone, and to cease to whine.  
</p><p>Nevertheless, there was a state of peace in the house for some  
time.  Mrs. Morel was more tolerant of him, and he, depending  
on her almost like a child, was rather happy.  Neither knew that  
she was more tolerant because she loved him less.  Up till this time,  
in spite of all, he had been her husband and her man.  She had felt  
that, more or less, what he did to himself he did to her.  Her living  
depended on him.  There were many, many stages in the ebbing  
of her love for him, but it was always  
ebbing.  
</p><p>Now, with the birth of this third baby,  
herself no longer set towards him, helplessly, but was like a tide   
that scarcely rose, standing off from him.  After this she scarcely   
desired him.  And, standing more aloof from him, not feeling him so   
much part of herself, but merely part of her circumstances, she did   
not mind so much what he did, could leave him alone.  
</p><p>There was the halt, the wistfulness about the ensuing year,  
which is like autumn in a man's life.  His wife was casting him off,  
half regretfully, but relentlessly; casting him off and turning now  
for love and life to the children.  Henceforward he was more or  
less a husk.  And he himself acquiesced, as so many men do,  
yielding their place to their children.  
</p><p>During his recuperation, when it was really over between them,  
both made an effort to come back somewhat to the old relationship  
of the first months of their marriage.  He sat at home and, when  
the children were in bed, and she was sewing &mdash; she did all ber sewing   
by hand, made all shirts and children's clothing &mdash; he would read  
to her from the newspaper, slowly pronouncing and delivering the  
words like a man pitching quoits.  Often she hurried him on, giving  
him a phrase in anticipation.  And then he took her words humbly.  
</p><p>The silences between them were peculiar.  There would be the  
swift, slight "cluck" of her needle, the sharp "pop" of his lips as  
he let out the smoke, the warmth, the sizzle on the bars as he spat  
in the fire.  Then her thoughts turned to William.  Already he was  
getting a big boy.  Already he was top of the class, and the master  
  
  
<pb n="51"/>   
said he was the smartest lad in the school.  She saw him a man,  
young, full of vigour, making the world glow again for her.  
</p><p>And Morel sitting there, quite alone, and having nothing to think  
about, would be feeling vaguely uncomfortable.  His soul would  
reach out in its blind way to her and find her gone.  He felt a sort  
of emptiness, almost like a vacuum in his soul.  He was unsettled  
and restless.  Soon he could not live in that atmosphere, and he  
affected his wife.  Both felt an oppression on their breathing when  
they were left together for some time.  Then he went to bed and  
she settled down to enjoy herself alone, working, thinking, living.  
</p><p>Meanwhile another infant was coming, fruit of this little peace  
and tenderness between the separating parents.  Paul was seventeen   
months old when the new baby was born.  He was then a  
plump, pale child, quiet, with heavy blue eyes, and still the peculiar  
slight knitting of the brows.  The last child was also a boy, fair and  
bonny.  Mrs. Morel was sorry when she knew she was with child,  
both for economic reasons and because she did not love her husband;   
but not for the sake of the infant.  
</p><p>They called the baby Arthur.  He was very pretty, with a mop of  
gold curls, and he loved his father from the first.  Mrs. Morel was  
glad this child loved the father.  Hearing the miner's footsteps, the  
baby would put up his arms and crow.  And if Morel were in a good  
temper, he called back immediately, in his hearty, mellow voice:  
</p><p> "What then, my beauty? I sh'll come to thee in a minute."  
</p><p>And as soon as he had taken off his pit-coat, Mrs. Morel would  
put an apron round the child, and give him to his father.  
</p><p>"What a sight the lad looks!" she would exclaim sometimes,  
taking back the baby, that was smutted on the face from his  
father's kisses and play.  Then Morel laughed joyfully.  
</p><p> "He's a little collier, bless his bit o' mutton!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>And these were the happy moments of her life now, when the  
children included the father in ber heart.  
</p><p>Meanwhile William grew bigger and stronger and more active,  
while Paul, always rather delicate and quiet, got slimmer, and  
trotted after his mother like her shadow.  He was usually active  
and interested, but sometimes he would have fits of depression.   
Then the mother would find the boy of three or four crying on the  
sofa.  
</p><p> "What's the matter?" she asked, and got no answer.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="52"/>   
  
<p> "What's the matter?" she insisted, getting cross.  
</p><p> "I don't know," sobbed the child.  
</p><p>So she tried to reason him out of it, or to amuse him, but   
without effect.  It made her feel beside herself.  Then the father, always  
impatient, would jump from his chair and shout:  
</p><p>"If he doesn't stop, I'll smack him till he does."  
</p><p>"You'll do nothing of the sort," said the mother coldly.  And  
then she carried the child into the yard, plumped him into his little  
chair, and said: "Now cry there, Misery!"  
</p><p>And then a butterfly on the rhubarb-leaves perhaps caught his  
eye, or at last he cried himself to sleep.  These fits were not often,  
but they caused a shadow in Mrs. Morel's heart, and her treatment  
of Paul was different from that of the other children.  
</p><p>Suddenly one morning as sbe was looking down the alley of the  
Bottoms for the barm-man, she heard a voice calling her.  It was  
the thin little Mrs. Anthony in brown velvet.  
</p><p> "Here, Mrs. Morel, I want to tell you about your Willie."  
</p><p> "Oh, do you?" replied Mrs. Morel.  "Why, what's the matter?"  
</p><p> "A lad as gets 'old of another an' rips his clothes off'n 'is back,"  
Mrs. Anthony said, "wants showing something."  
</p><p> "Your Alfred's as old as my William," said Mrs.  
Morel.  
</p><p>"'Appen 'e is, but that doesn't give him a  
right to get hold of the  
boy's collar, an' fair rip it clean off his back."  
</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "I don't thrash my children, and even  
if I did, I should want to hear their side of the tale."  
</p><p>"They'd happen be a bit better if they did get a good hiding,"  
retorted Mrs. Anthony.  "When it comes ter rippin' a lad's clean  
collar off'n 'is back a-purpose &mdash; "  
</p><p> "I'm sure he didn't do it on purpose," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Make me a liar!" shouted Mrs. Anthony.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel moved away and closed her gate.  Her hand  
trembled as she held her mug of barm.  
</p><p>"But I s'll let your mester know," Mrs. Anthony cried after her.  
</p><p> At dinner-time, when William had finished his meal and wanted  
to be off again &mdash; he was then eleven years old &mdash; his mother said to  
him:  
</p><p> "What did you tear Alfred Anthony's collar for?"  
</p><p> "When did I tear his collar?"</p>  
  
<pb n="53"/>   
  
<p> "I don't know when, but his mother says you did."  
</p><p> "Why &mdash; it was yesterday &mdash; an' it was torn a'ready."  
</p><p> "But you tore it more."  
  
</p><p>"Well, I'd got a cobbler as 'ad licked seventeen &mdash; an' Alfy  
Ant'ny 'e says:  
</p>  
<l>           'Adam an' Eve an' pinch-me,</l>  
<l>              Went down to a river to bade.</l>  
<l>            Adam an' Eve got drownded,</l>  
<l>              Who do yer think got saved?'</l>  
 <p> 
An' so I says: 'Oh, Pinch-you,' an' so I pinched 'im, an' 'e  
was mad, an' so he snatched my cobbler an' run off with it.  An' so  
I run after 'im, an' when I was gettin' hold of 'im, 'e dodged, an' it  
ripped 'is collar.  But I got my cobbler &mdash; "  
</p><p>He pulled from his pocket a black old horse-chestnut hanging  
on a string.  This old cobbler had "cobbled" &mdash; hit and smashed &mdash;  
seventeen other cobblers on similar strings.  So the boy was proud  
of his veteran.  
</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "you know you've got no right to rip  
his collar."  
</p><p>"Well, our mother!" he answered.  "I never meant tr'a done it &mdash;  
an' it was on'y an old indirrubber collar as was torn a'ready."  
</p><p>"Next time," said his mother, "you be more careful.  I shouldn't  
like it if you came home with your collar torn  
off."  
</p><p> "I don't care, our mother; I never did it a-purpose."  
</p><p> The boy was rather miserable at being reprimanded.  
</p><p> "No &mdash; well, you be more careful."  
</p><p>William fled away, glad to be exonerated.  And Mrs. Morel,  
who hated any bother with the neighbours, thought she would  
explain to Mrs. Anthony, and the business would be over.  
</p><p>But that evening Morel came in from the pit looking very sour.   
He stood in the kitchen and glared round, but did not speak for  
some minutes.  Then:  
</p><p> "Wheer's that Willy?" he asked.  
</p><p>"What do you want him for?" asked Mrs. Morel, who had  
guessed.  
</p><p>"I'll let 'im know when I get him," said Morel, banging his pit-bottle on to the dresser.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="54"/>   
  
<p>"I suppose Mrs. Anthony's got hold of you and been yarning to  
you about Alfy's collar," said Mrs. Morel, rather sneering.  
</p><p>"Niver mind who's got hold of me," said Morel.  "When I get  
hold of 'im I'll make his bones rattle."  
</p><p>"It's a poor tale," said Mrs. Morel, "that you're so ready to side  
with any snipey vixen who likes to come telling tales against your  
own children."  
</p><p>"I'll learn 'im!" said Morel.  "It none matters to me whose lad  
'e is; 'e's none goin' rippin' an' tearin' about just as he's a mind."  
</p><p>"'Ripping and tearing about!'" repeated Mrs. Morel.  "He was  
running after that Alfy, who'd taken his cobbler, and he accidentally   
got hold of his collar, because the other dodged &mdash; as an  
Anthony would."  
</p><p> "I know!" shouted Morel threateningly.  
</p><p> "You would, before you're told," replied his wife bitingly.  
</p><p> "Niver you mind," stormed Morel.  "I know my business."  
</p><p>"That's more than doubtful," said Mrs. Morel, "supposing some  
loud-mouthed creature had been getting you to thrash your own  
children."  
</p><p> "I know," repeated Morel.  
</p><p>And he said no more, but sat and nursed his bad temper.    
Suddenly William ran in, saying:  
</p><p> "Can I have my tea, mother?"  
</p><p> "Tha can ha'e more than that!" shouted Morel.  
</p><p>"Hold your noise, man," said Mrs. Morel; "and don't look so  
ridiculous."  
</p><p>"He'll look ridiculous before I've done wi' him!" shouted Morel,  
rising from his chair and glaring at his  
son.  
</p><p>William, who was a tall lad for his years, but  
very sensitive, had  
gone pale, and was looking in a sort of horror at his father.  
</p><p> "Go out!" Mrs. Morel commanded her son.  
</p><p>William had not the wit to move.  Suddenly Morel clenched his  
fist, and crouched.  
</p><p> "I'll gie him 'go out'!" he shouted like an insane thing.  
</p><p>"What!" cried Mrs. Morel, panting with rage.  "You shall not  
touch him for her telling, you shall not!"  
</p><p> "Shonna I?" shouted Morel.  "Shonna I?"  
</p><p>And, glaring at the boy, he ran forward.  Mrs. Morel sprang in  
between them, with her fist lifted.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="55"/>   
<p> "Don't you dare!" she cried.  
</p><p> "What!" he shouted, baffled for the moment.  "What!"  
</p><p> She spun round to her son.  
</p><p>"Go out of the house!" she commanded him in fury.  
</p><p>The boy, as if hypnotised by her, turned suddenly and was gone.   
Morel rushed to the door, but was too late.  He returned, pale  
under his pit-dirt with fury.  But now his wife was fully roused.  
</p><p>"Only dare!" she said in a loud, ringing voice.  "Only dare,   
milord, to lay a finger on that child! You'll regret it for ever."  
</p><p>He was afraid of her.  In a towering rage, he sat down.  
</p><p>When the children were old enough to be left, Mrs. Morel joined  
the Women's Guild.  It was a little club of women attached to the  
Co-operative Wholesale Society, which met on Monday night in  
the long room over the grocery shop of the Bestwood "Co-op".   
The women were supposed to discuss the benefits to be derived  
from co-operation, and other social questions.  Sometimes Mrs.  
Morel read a paper.  It seemed queer to the children to see their  
mother, who was always busy about the house, sitting writing in  
her rapid fashion, thinking, referring to books, and writing again.   
They felt for her on such occasions the deepest respect.  
</p><p>But they loved the Guild.  It was the only thing to which they  
did not grudge their mother &mdash; and that partly because she enjoyed  
it, partly because of the treats they derived from it.  The Guild was  
called by some hostile husbands, who found their wives getting  
too independent, the "clat-fart" shop &mdash; that is, the gossip-shop.  It  
is true, from off the basis of the Guild, the women could look at  
their homes, at the conditions of their own lives, and find fault.   
So the colliers found their women had a new standard of their  
own, rather disconcerting.  And also, Mrs. Morel always had a lot  
of news on Monday nights, so that the children liked William to  
be in when their mother came home, because she told him things.  
</p><p>Then, when the lad was thirteen, she got him a job in the  
"Co-op." office.  He was a very clever boy, frank, with rather  
rough features and real viking blue eyes.  
</p><p>"What dost want ter ma'e a stool-harsed Jack on 'im for?" said  
Morel.  "All he'll do is to wear his britches behind out an' earn  
nowt.  What's 'e startin' wi'?"  
</p><p> "It doesn't matter what he's starting with," said Mrs. Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="56"/>   
  
<p>"It wouldna! Put 'im i' th' pit we me, an' 'ell earn a easy ten  
shillin' a wik from th' start.  But six shillin' wearin' his truck-end  
out on a stool's better than ten shillin' i' th' pit wi'me, I know."  
</p><p>"He is not going in the pit," said Mrs. Morel, "and there's an  
end of it."  
</p><p>"It wor good enough for me, but it's non good enough for 'im."  
</p><p>"If your mother put you in the pit at twelve, it's no reason why  
I should do the same with my lad."  
</p><p> "Twelve! It wor a sight afore that!"  
</p><p>"Whenever it was," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>She was very proud of her son.  He went to the night school,  
and learned shorthand, so that by the time he was sixteen he was  
the best shorthand clerk and book-keeper on the place, except  
one.  Then he taught in the night schools.  But he was so fiery that  
only his good-nature and his size protected him.  
</p><p>All the things that men do &mdash; the decent things &mdash; William did.  He  
could run like the wind.  When he was twelve he won a first prize  
in a race; an inkstand of glass, shaped like an anvil.  It stood  
proudly on the dresser, and gave Mrs. Morel a keen pleasure.   
The boy only ran for her.  He flew home with his anvil, breathless,  
with a "Look, mother!" That was the first real tribute to herself.   
She took it like a queen.  
</p><p>"How pretty!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>Then he began to get ambitious.  He gave all his money to his  
mother.  When he earned fourteen shillings a week, she gave him  
back two for himself, and, as he never drank, he felt himself rich.   
He went about with the bourgeois of Bestwood.  The townlet contained   
nothing higher than the clergyman.  Then came the bank  
manager, then the doctors, then the tradespeople, and after that  
the hosts of colliers.  Willam began to consort with the sons of the  
chemist, the schoolmaster, and the tradesmen.  He played billiards  
in the Mechanics' Hall.  Also he danced &mdash; this in spite of his  
mother.  All the life that Bestwood offered he enjoyed, from the  
sixpenny-hops down Church Street, to sports and billiards.  
</p><p>Paul was treated to dazzling descriptions of all kinds of flower-like ladies, most of whom lived like cut blooms in William's  
heart for a brief fortnight.  
</p><p> Occasionally some flame would come in pursuit of her errant  
  
  
<pb n="57"/>   
  
swain.  Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door, and   
immediately she sniffed the air.  
</p><p> "Is Mr. Morel in?" the damsel would ask appealingly.  
</p><p> "My husband is at home," Mrs. Morel replied.  
</p><p> "I &mdash; I mean young Mr. Morel," repeated the maiden painfully.   
</p><p> "Which one? There are several."  
</p><p> Whereupon much blushing and stammering from the fair one.   
</p><p> "I &mdash; I met Mr. Morel &mdash; at Ripley," she explained.  
</p><p> "Oh &mdash; at a dance!"  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p>"I don't approve of the girls my son meets at dances.  And he is  
not at home."  
</p><p>Then he came home angry with his mother for having turned  
the girl away so rudely.  He was a careless, yet eager-looking fellow,   
who walked with long strides, sometimes frowning, often  
with his cap pushed jollily to the back of his head.  Now he came in  
frowning.  He threw his cap on to the sofa, and took his strong jaw  
in his hand, and glared down at his mother.  She was small, with  
her hair taken straight back from her forehead.  She had a quiet  
air of authority, and yet of rare warmth.  Knowing her son was  
angry, she trembled inwardly.  
</p><p> "Did a lady call for me yesterday, mother?" he asked.  
</p><p> "I don't know about a lady.  There was a girl came."  
</p><p> "And why didn't you tell me?"  
</p><p> "Because I forgot,  simply."  
</p><p> He fumed a little.  
</p><p> "A good-looking girl &mdash; seemed a lady?"  
</p><p> "I didn't look at her."  
</p><p> "Big brown eyes?"  
</p><p>"I did not look.  And tell your girls, my son, that when they're  
running after you, they're not to come and ask your mother for  
you.  Tell them that &mdash; brazen baggages you meet at dancing-classes."  
</p><p> "I'm sure she was a nice girl."  
</p><p> "And I'm  sure  she  wasn't."  
</p><p>There ended the altercation.  Over the dancing there was a great  
strife between the mother and the son.  The grievance reached its  
height when William said he was going to Hucknall Torkard &mdash; considered   
a low town &mdash; to a fancy-dress ball.  He was to be a Highlander.  
  
  
<pb n="58"/>   
  
There was a dress he could hire, which one of his friends  
had had, and which fitted him perfectly.  The Highland suit came  
home.  Mrs. Morel received it coldly and would not unpack it.  
</p><p> "My suit come?" cried William.  
</p><p> "There's a parcel in the front room."  
</p><p> He rushed in and cut the string.  
</p><p>"How do you fancy your son in this!" he said, enraptured,  
showing her the suit.  
</p><p> "You know I don't want to fancy you in it."  
</p><p>On the evening of the dance, when he had come home to dress,  
Mrs. Morel put on her coat and bonnet.  
</p><p> "Aren't you going to stop and see me, mother?" he asked.  
</p><p> "No; I don't want to see you," she replied.  
</p><p>She was rather pale, and her face was closed and hard.  She was  
afraid of her son's going the same way as his father.  He hesitated a  
moment, and his heart stood still with anxiety.  Then he caught  
sight of the Highland bonnet with its ribbons.  He picked it up   
gleefully, forgetting her.  She went out.  
</p><p>When he was nineteen he suddenly left the Co-op. office and  
got a situation in Nottingham.  In his new place he had thirty shillings   
a week instead of eighteen.  This was indeed a rise.  His  
mother and his father were brimmed up with pride.  Everybody  
praised William.  It seemed he was going to get on rapidly.  Mrs.  
Morel hoped, with his aid, to help her younger sons.  Annie was  
now studying to be a teacher.  Paul, also very clever, was getting  
on well, having lessons in French and German from his godfather,  
the clergyman who was still a friend to Mrs. Morel.  Arthur, a  
spoilt and very good-looking boy, was at the Board school, but  
there was talk of his trying to get a scholarship for the High School  
in Nottingham.  
</p><p>William remained a year at his new post in Nottingham.  He was  
studying hard, and growing serious.  Something seemed to be fretting him.    
Still he went out to the dances and the river parties.  He  
did not drink.  The children were all rabid teetotallers.  He came  
home very late at night, and sat yet longer studying.  His mother  
implored him to take more care, to do one thing or another.  
</p><p>"Dance, if you want to dance, my son; but don't think you can  
work in the office, and then amuse yourself, and then study on top  
  
  
<pb n="59"/>   
of all.  You can't; the human frame won't stand it.  Do one thing or  
the other &mdash; amuse yourself or learn Latin; but don't try to do both."  
</p><p>Then be got a place in London, at a hundred and twenty a year.  
This seemed a fabulous sum.  His mother doubted almost  
whether to rejoice or to grieve.  
</p><p>"They want me in Lime Street on Monday week, mother," he  
cried, his eyes blazing as he read the letter.  Mrs. Morel felt   
everything go silent inside her.  He read the letter: "'And will you reply  
by Thursday whether you accept.  Yours faithfully &mdash; ' They want  
me, mother, at a hundred and twenty a year, and don't even ask  
to see me.  Didn't I tell you I could do it! Think of me in London!  
And I can give you twenty pounds a year, mater.  We s'll all be rolling   
in money."  
</p><p>"We shall, my son," she answered sadly.  
</p><p>It never occurred to him that she might be more hurt at his going  
away than glad of his success.  Indeed, as the days drew near for his  
departure, her heart began to close and grow dreary with despair.   
She loved him so much! More than that, she hoped in him so much.   
Almost she lived by him.  She liked to do things for him: she liked  
to put a cup for his tea and to iron his collars, of which he was so  
proud.  It was a joy to her to have him proud of his collars.  There  
was no laundry.  So she used to rub away at them with her little  
convex iron, to polish them, till they shone from the sheer pressure   
of her arm.  Now she would not do it for him.  Now he was going away.    
She felt almost as if he were going as well out of her  
heart.  He did not seem to leave her inhabited with himself.  That  
was the grief and the pain to her.  He took nearly all himself away.  
</p><p>A few days before his departure &mdash; he was just twenty &mdash; he burned  
his love-letters.  They had hung on a file at the top of the kitchen  
cupboard.  From some of them he had read extracts to his mother.   
Some of them she had taken the trouble to read herself.  But most  
were too trivial.  
</p><p> Now, on the Saturday morning he said:  
</p><p>"Come on, Postle, let's go through my letters, and you can have  
the birds and flowers."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel had done her Saturday's work on the Friday, because  
he was having a last day's holiday.  She was making him a rice  
cake, which he loved, to take with him.  He was scarcely conscious  
that she was so miserable.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="60"/>   
  
<p>He took the first letter off the file.  It was mauve-tinted, and had  
purple and green thistles.  William sniffed the page.  
</p><p> "Nice scent! Smell."  
</p><p> And he thrust the sheet under Paul's nose.  
</p><p>"Um!" said Paul, breathing in.  "What d'you call it? Smell,  
mother."  
</p><p> His mother ducked her small, fine nose  
down to the paper.  
</p><p> "I don't want to smell their rubbish," she said, sniffing.  
</p><p>"This girl's father," said William, "is as rich as Croesus.  He owns  
property without end.  She calls me Lafayette, because I know  
French.  'You will see, I've forgiven you' &mdash; I like her forgiving me.  'I  
told mother about you this morning, and she will have much pleasure if   
you come to tea on Sunday, but she will have to get father's  
consent also.  I sincerely hope he will agree.  I will let you know how  
it transpires.  If, however, you &mdash; "'  
</p><p> "'Let you know how it' what?" interrupted Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "'Transpires' &mdash; oh yes!"  
</p><p>"'Transpires!"' repeated Mrs. Morel mockingly.  "I thought she  
was so well educated!"  
</p><p>William felt slightly uncomfortable, and abandoned this maiden,  
giving Paul the corner with the thistles.  He continued to read extracts   
from his letters, some of which amused his mother, some of  
which saddened her and made her anxious for him.  
</p><p>"My lad," she said, "they're very wise.  They know they've only  
got to flatter your vanity, and you press up to them like a dog that  
has its head scratched."  
</p><p>"Well, they can't go on scratching for ever," he replied.  "And  
when they've done, I trot away."  
</p><p>"But one day you'll find a string round your neck that you can't  
pull off," she answered.  
</p><p>"Not me! I'm equal to any of 'em, mater, they needn't flatter  
themselves."  
</p><p>"You flatter yourself," she said quietly.  
</p><p>Soon there was a heap of twisted black pages, all that remained  
of the file of scented letters, except that Paul had thirty or forty  
pretty tickets from the corners of the notepaper &mdash; swallows and  
forget-me-nots and ivy sprays.  And William went to London, to  
start a new life.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="61"/>   
  
</div2><div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="d9">  
<head>"The Young Life of Paul" </head> 
  
<p>PAUL would be built like his mother, slightly and rather small.  His  
fair hair went reddish, and then dark brown; his eyes were grey.   
He was a pale, quiet child, with eyes that seemed to listen, and  
with a full, dropping underlip.  
</p><p>As a rule he seemed old for his years.  He was so conscious of  
what other people felt, particularly his mother.  When she fretted  
he understood, and could have no peace.  His soul seemed  
always attentive to her.  
</p><p>As he grew older he became stronger.  William was too far removed   
from him to accept him as a companion.  So the smaller  
boy belonged at first almost entirely to Annie.  She was a tomboy  
and a "flybie-skybie", as her mother called her.  But she was intensely   
fond of her second brother.  So Paul was towed round at  
the heels of Annie, sharing her game.  She raced wildly at lerky with  
the other young wild-cats of the Bottoms.  And always Paul flew beside   
her, living her share of the game, having as yet no part of his  
own.  He was quiet and not noticeable.  But his sister adored him.   
He always seemed to care for things if she wanted him to.  
</p><p>She had a big doll of which she was fearfully proud, though not  
so fond.  So she laid the doll on the sofa, and covered it with an  
antimacassar, to sleep.  Then she forgot it.  Meantime Paul must  
practise jumping off the sofa arm.  So he jumped crash into the face  
of the hidden doll.  Annie rushed up, uttered a loud wail, and sat  
down to weep a dirge.  Paul remained quite still.  
</p><p>"You couldn't tell it was there, mother; you couldn't tell it was  
there," he repeated over and over.  So long as Annie wept for the  
doll he sat helpless with misery.  Her grief wore itself out.  She forgave   
her brother &mdash; he was so much upset.  But a day or two afterwards she   
was shocked.  
</p><p>"Let's make a sacrifice of Arabella," he said.  "Let's burn her."  
</p><p>She was horrified, yet rather fascinated.  She wanted to see what  
the boy would do.  He made an altar of bricks, pulled some of the  
shavings out of Arabella's body, put the waxen fragments into the  
hollow face, poured on a little paraffin, and set the whole thing  
  
  
<pb n="62"/>   
  
alight.  He watched with wicked satisfaction the drops of wax melt  
off the broken forehead of Arabella, and drop like sweat into the  
flame.  So long as the stupid big doll burned he rejoiced in silence.   
At the end be poked among the embers with a stick, fished out the  
arms and legs, all blackened, and smashed them under stones.  
</p><p>"That's the sacrifice of Missis Arabella," he said.  "An' I'm glad  
there's nothing left of her."  
</p><p>Which disturbed Annie inwardly, although she could say nothing.    
He seemed to hate the doll so intensely, because he had broken it.  
</p><p>All the children, but particularly Paul, were peculiarly against  
their father, along with their mother.  Morel continued to bully and  
to drink.  He had periods, months at a time, when he made the  
whole life of the family a misery.  Paul never forgot coming  
home from the Band of Hope one Monday evening and finding  
his mother with her eye swollen and discoloured, his father standing on the  
hearth-rug, feet astride, his head down, and William, just home  
from work, glaring at his father.  There was a silence as the young  
children entered, but none of the elders looked round.  
</p><p>William was white to the lips, and his fists were clenched.  He  
waited until the children were silent, watching with children's rage  
and hate; then he said:  
</p><p> "You coward, you daren't do it when I was in."  
</p><p>But Morel's blood was up.  He swung round on his son.  William  
was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.  
</p><p>"Dossn't I?" he shouted.  "Dossn't I? Ha'e much more o' thy  
chelp, my young jockey, an' I'll rattle my fist about thee.  Ay, an'  
I sholl that, dost see?"  
</p><p>Morel crouched at the knees and showed his fist in an ugly,   
almost beast-like fashion.  William was white with rage.  
</p><p>"Will yer?" he said, quiet and intense.  "It 'ud be the last time,  
though."  
</p><p>Morel danced a little nearer, crouching, drawing back his fist to  
strike.  William put his fists ready.  A light came into his blue eyes,  
almost like a laugh.  He watched his father.  Another word, and the  
men would have begun to fight.  Paul hoped they would.  The three  
children sat pale on the sofa.  
</p><p>"Stop it, both of you," cried Mrs. Morel in a hard voice.  "We've  
  
  
<pb n="63"/>   
had enough for one night.  And you," she said, turning on to her  
husband, "look at your children!"  
</p><p> Morel glanced at the sofa.  
</p><p>"Look at the children, you nasty little bitch!" he sneered.  "Why,  
what have I done to the children, I should like to know? But  
they're like yourself; you've put 'em up to your own tricks and  
nasty ways &mdash; you've learned 'em in it, you 'ave."  
</p><p>She refused to answer him.  No one spoke.  After a while he threw  
his boots under the table and went to bed.  
</p><p>"Why didn't you let me have a go at him?" said William, when  
his father was upstairs.  "I could easily have beaten him."  
</p><p> "A nice thing &mdash; your own father," she replied.  
</p><p> "'Father!"' repeated William.  "Call him my father!"  
</p><p> "Well, he is &mdash; and so &mdash; "  
</p><p> "But why don't you let me settle him? I could do, easily."  
</p><p> "The idea!" she cried.  "It hasn't come to that yet."  
</p><p>"No," he said, "it's come to worse.  Look at yourself.  Why didn't  
you let me give it him?"  
</p><p>"Because I couldn't bear it, so never think of it," she  
cried quickly.  
</p><p>And the children went to bed, miserably.  
</p><p>When William was growing up, the family moved from the Bottoms   
to a house on the brow of the hill, commanding a view of the  
valley, which spread out like a convex cockle-shell, or a clamp-shell,  
before it.  In front of the house was a huge old ash-tree.  The west  
wind, sweeping from Derbyshire, caught the houses with full force,  
and the tree shrieked again.  Morel liked it.  
</p><p>"It's music," he said.  "It sends me to sleep."  
</p><p>But Paul and Arthur and Annie hated it.  To Paul it became almost   
a demoniacal noise.  The winter of their first year in the new  
house their father was very bad.  The children played in the street,  
on the brim of the wide, dark valley, until eight o'clock.  Then they  
went to bed.  Their mother sat sewing below.  Having such a great  
space in front of the house gave the children a feeling of night, of  
vastness, and of terror.  This terror came in from the shrieking of  
the tree and the anguish of the home discord.  Often Paul would  
wake up, after he had been asleep a long time, aware of thuds  
downstairs.  Instantly he was wide awake.  Then he beard the booming  
  
  
<pb n="64"/>   
  
shouts of his father, come home nearly drunk, then the sharp  
replies of his mother, then the bang, bang of his father's fist on the  
table, and the nasty snarling shout as the man's voice got higher.   
And then the whole was drowned in a piercing medley of shrieks  
and cries from the great, wind-swept ash-tree.  The children lay  
silent in suspense, waiting for a lull in the wind to hear what their  
father was doing.  He might hit their mother again.  There was a  
feeling of horror, a kind of bristling in the darkness, and a sense of  
blood.  They lay with their hearts in the grip of an intense anguish.   
The wind came through the tree fiercer and fiercer.  All the chords  
of the great harp hummed, whistled, and shrieked.  And then came  
the horror of the sudden silence, silence everywhere, outside and  
downstairs.  What was it? Was it a silence of blood? What had he done?  
</p><p>The children lay and breathed the darkness.  And then, at last,  
they heard their father throw down his boots and tramp upstairs in  
his stockinged feet.  Still they listened.  Then at last, if the wind   
allowed, they heard the water of the tap drumming into the kettle,   
which their mother was filling for morning, and they could go  
to sleep in peace.  
</p><p>So they were happy in the morning &mdash; happy, very happy playing,  
dancing at night round the lonely lamp-post in the midst of the  
darkness.  But they had one tight place of anxiety in their hearts,  
one darkness in their eyes, which showed all their lives.  
</p><p>Paul hated his father.  As a boy he had a fervent private religion.  
</p><p>"Make him stop drinking," he prayed every night.  "Lord, let my  
father die," he prayed very often.  "Let him not be killed at pit,"  
he prayed when, after tea, the father did not come home from work.  
</p><p>That was another time when the family suffered intensely.  The  
children came from school and had their teas.  On the hob the big  
black saucepan was simmering, the stew-jar was in the oven, ready  
for Morel's dinner.  He was expected at five o'clock.  But for months  
he would stop and drink every night on his way from work.  
</p><p>In the winter nights, when it was cold, and grew dark early, Mrs.  
Morel would put a brass candlestick on the table, light a tallow  
candle to save the gas.  The children finished their bread-and-butter, or dripping, and were ready to go out to play.  But if Morel  
had not come they faltered.  The sense of his sitting in all his pit-dirt, drinking, after a long day's work, not coming home and eating  
  
  
<pb n="65"/>   
  
and washing, but sitting, getting drunk, on an empty stomach, made  
Mrs. Morel unable to bear herself.  From her the feeling was trans-mitted to the other children.  She never suffered alone any more:  
the children suffered with her.  
</p><p>Paul went out to play with the rest.  Down in the great trough of  
twilight, tiny clusters of lights burned where the pits were.  A few  
last colliers straggled up the dim field path.  The lamplighter came  
along.  No more colliers came.  Darkness shut down over the valley;  
work was done.  It was night.  
</p><p>Then Paul ran anxiously into the kitchen.  The one candle still  
burned on the table, the big fire glowed red.  Mrs. Morel sat alone.   
On the hob the saucepan steamed; the dinner-plate lay waiting on  
the table.  All the room was full of the sense of waiting, waiting for  
the man who was sitting in his pit-dirt, dinnerless, some mile away  
from home, across the darkness, drinking himself drunk.  Paul stood  
in the doorway.  
</p><p> "Has my dad come?" he asked.  
</p><p>"You can see he hasn't," said Mrs. Morel, cross with the futility  
of the question.  
</p><p>Then the boy dawdled about near his mother.  They shared the  
same anxiety.  Presently Mrs. Morel went out and strained the potatoes.  
</p><p> "They're ruined and black," she said; "but what do I care?"  
</p><p>Not many words were spoken.  Paul almost hated his mother for  
suffering because his father did not come home from work.  
</p><p>"What do you bother yourself for?" he said.  "If he wants to  
stop and get drunk, why don't you let him?"  
</p><p>"Let him!" flashed Mrs. Morel.  "You may well say 'let him'."  
</p><p>She knew that the man who stops on the way home from work is  
on a quick way to ruining himself and his home.  The children were  
yet young, and depended on the breadwinner.  William gave her  
the sense of relief, providing her at last with someone to turn to if  
Morel failed.  But the tense atmosphere of the room on these waiting   
evenings was the same.  
</p><p>The minutes ticked away.  At six o'clock still the cloth lay on the  
table, still the dinner stood waiting, still the same sense of anxiety  
and expectation in the room.  The boy could not stand it any longer.   
He could not go out and play.  So he ran in to Mrs. Inger, next door  
but one, for her to talk to him.  She had no children.  Her husband  
  
  
<pb n="66"/>   
  
was good to her but was in a shop, and came home late.  So, when  
she saw the lad at the door, she called:  
</p><p> "Come in, Paul."  
</p><p>The two sat talking for some time, when suddenly the boy rose,  
saying:  
</p><p>"Well, I'll be going and seeing if my mother wants an errand  
doing."  
</p><p>He pretended to be perfectly cheerful, and did not tell his friend  
what ailed him.  Then he ran indoors.  
</p><p> Morel at these times came in churlish and hateful.  
</p><p> "This is a nice time to come home," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Wha's it matter to yo' what time I come whoam?" he shouted.  
</p><p>And everybody in the house was still, because he was dangerous.   
He ate his food in the most brutal manner possible, and, when he  
had done, pushed all the pots in a heap away from him, to lay his  
arms on the table.  Then he went to sleep.  
</p><p>Paul hated his father so.  The colliers small, mean head, with  
its black hair slightly soiled with grey, lay on the bare arms, and  
the face, dirty and inflamed, with a fleshy nose and thin, paltry  
brows, was turned sideways, asleep with beer and weariness and  
nasty temper.  If anyone entered suddenly, or a noise were made,  
the man looked up and shouted:  
</p><p>"I'll lay my fist about thy y'ead, I'm tellin' thee, if tha doesna stop  
that clatter! Dost hear?"  
</p><p>And the two last words, shouted in a bullying fashion, usually  
at Annie, made the family writhe with hate of the man.  
</p><p>He was shut out from all family affairs.  No one told him   
anything.  The children, alone with their mother, told her all about the  
day's happenings, everything.  Nothing had really taken place  
in them until it was told to their mother.  But as soon as the  
father came in, everything stopped.  He was like the scotch in the smooth,  
happy machinery of the home.  And he was always aware of this fall  
of silence on his entry, the shutting off of life, the unwelcome.  But  
now it was gone too far to alter.  
</p><p>He would dearly have liked the children to talk to him, but they  
could not.  Sometimes Mrs. Morel would say:  
</p><p> "You ought to tell your father."  
</p><p>Paul won a prize in a competition in a child's paper.  Everybody  
was highly jubilant.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="67"/>   
  
<p>"Now you'd better tell your father when be comes in," said Mrs.  
Morel.  "You know how be carries on and says he's never told  
anything."  
  
</p><p>"All right," said Paul.  But be would almost rather have forfeited  
the prize than have to tell his father.  
</p><p> "I've won a prize in a competition, dad," he said.  
Morel turned round to him.  
</p><p> "Have you, my boy? What sort of a competition?"  
</p><p> "Oh, nothing &mdash; about famous women."  
</p><p> "And how much is the prize, then, as you've got?"  
</p><p> "It's a book."  
</p><p> "Oh, indeed! "  
</p><p> "About birds."  
</p><p> "Hm &mdash; hm! "  
</p><p>And that was all.  Conversation was impossible between the   
father and any other member of the family.  He was an outsider.  He  
had denied the God in him.  
</p><p>The only times when he entered again into the life of his own  
people was when he worked, and was happy at work.  Sometimes,  
in the evening, he cobbled the boots or mended the kettle or his  
pit-bottle.  Then he always wanted several attendants, and the   
children enjoyed it.  They united with him in the work, in the actual  
doing of something, when he was his real self again.  
</p><p>He was a good workman, dexterous, and one who, when he was  
in a good humour, always sang.  He had whole periods, months,  
almost years, of friction and nasty temper.  Then sometimes be was  
jolly again.  It was nice to see him run with a piece of red-hot iron  
into the scullery, crying:  
</p><p>"Out of my road &mdash; out of my road!"  
</p><p>Then he hammered the soft, red-glowing stuff on his iron goose,  
and made the shape he wanted.  Or he sat absorbed for a  
moment, soldering.  Then the children watched with joy as the  
metal sank suddenly molten, and was shoved about against the nose of the  
soldering-iron, while the room was full of a scent of burnt resin  
and hot tin, and Morel was silent and intent for a minute.  He always   
sang when he mended boots because of the jolly sound of  
hammering.  And he was rather happy when he sat putting great  
patches on his moleskin pit trousers, which he would often do,   
considering them too dirty, and the stuff too hard, for his wife to mend.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="68"/>   
  
<p>But the best time for the young children was when he made fuses.   
Morel fetched a sheaf of long sound wheat-straws from the attic.   
These he cleaned with his hand, till each one gleamed like a stalk  
of gold, after which he cut the straws into lengths of about six  
inches, leaving, if he could, a notch at the bottom of each piece.   
He always had a beautifully sharp knife that could cut a straw clean  
without hurting it.  Then he set in the middle of the table a heap of  
gunpowder, a little pile of black grains upon the white-scrubbed  
board.  He made and trimmed the straws while Paul and Annie  
rifled and plugged them.  Paul loved to see the black grains trickle  
down a crack in his palm into the mouth of the straw, peppering  
jollily downwards till the straw was full.  Then he bunged up the  
mouth with a bit of soap &mdash; which he got on his thumb-nail from a  
pat in a saucer &mdash; and the straw was finished.  
</p><p>"Look, dad!" he said.  
</p><p>"That's right, my beauty," replied Morel, who was peculiarly  
lavish of endearments to his second son.  Paul popped the fuse into  
the powder-tin, ready for the morning, when Morel would take it  
to the pit, and use it to fire a shot that would blast the coal down.  
</p><p>Meantime Arthur, still fond of his father, would lean on the arm  
of Morel's chair and say:  
</p><p> "Tell us about down pit, daddy."  
</p><p> This Morel loved to do.  
</p><p>"Well, there's one little 'oss &mdash; we call 'im Taffy," he would begin.   
"An' he's a fawce 'un!"  
</p><p>Morel had a warm way of telling a story.  He made one feel  
Taffy's cunning.  
</p><p>"He's a brown 'un," he would answer, "an' not very high.  Well,  
he comes i' th' stall wi' a rattle, an' then yo' 'ear 'im sneeze.  
</p><p>"'Ello, Taff,' you say, 'what art sneezin' for? Bin ta'ein' some  
snuff?'  
</p><p>"An' 'e sneezes again.  Then he slives up an' shoves 'is 'ead on  
yer, that cadin'.  
</p><p> "'What's want, Taff?' yo' say."  
</p><p>  
"And what does he?" Arthur always asked.  
</p><p> "He wants a bit o' bacca, my duckie."  
</p><p>This story of Taffy would go on interminably, and everybody  
loved it.  
</p><p> Or sometimes it was a new tale.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="69"/>   
<p>"An' what dost think, my darlin'? When I went to put my coat  
on at snap-time, what should go runnin' up my arm but a mouse.  
</p><p> "'Hey up, theer!' I shouts.  
</p><p> "An' I wor just in time ter get 'im by th' tail."  
</p><p> "And did you kill it?"  
</p><p> "I did, for they're a nuisance.  The place is fair snied  wi'  'em."  
</p><p> "An' what do they live on?"  
</p><p>"The corn as the 'osses drops &mdash; an' they'll get in your pocket an'  
eat your snap, if you'll let 'em &mdash; no matter where yo' hing your coat  
&mdash; the slivin', nibblin' little nuisances, for they are."  
</p><p>These happy evenings could not take place unless Morel had  
some job to do.  And then he always went to bed very early, often  
before the children.  There was nothing remaining for him to stay  
up for, when he had finished tinkering, and had skimmed the headlines   
of the newspaper.  
</p><p>And the children felt secure when their father was in bed.  They  
lay and talked softly a while.  Then they started as the lights went  
suddenly sprawling over the ceiling from the lamps that swung in  
the hands of the colliers tramping by outside, going to take the  
nine o'clock shift.  They listened to the voices of the men, imagined  
them dipping down into the dark valley.  Sometimes they went to  
the window and watched the three or four lamps growing tinier and  
tinier, swaying down the fields in the darkness.  Then it was a joy to  
rush back to bed and cuddle closely in the warmth.  
</p><p>Paul was rather a delicate boy, subject to bronchitis.  The others  
were all quite strong; so this was another reason for his mother's  
difference in feeling for him.  One day he came home at dinner-time feeling ill.  But it was not a family to make any fuss.  
</p><p> "What's the matter with you?" his mother asked sharply.  
</p><p> "Nothing," he replied.  
</p><p> But he ate no dinner.  
</p><p> "If you eat no dinner, you're not going to school," she said.  
</p><p> "Why?" he asked.  
</p><p> "That's why."  
</p><p>So after dinner he lay down on the sofa, on the warm chintz   
cushions the children loved.  Then he fen into a kind of doze.  That   
afternoon Mrs. Morel was ironing.  She listened to the small, restless  
noise the boy made in his throat as she worked.  Again rose in  
her heart the old, almost weary feeling towards him.  She had never  
  
  
<pb n="70"/>   
  
expected him to live.  And yet he had a great vitality in his young  
body.  Perhaps it would have been a little relief to her if he had died.   
She always felt a mixture of anguish in her love for him.  
</p><p>He, in his semi-conscious sleep, was vaguely aware of the clatter  
of the iron on the iron-stand, of the faint thud, thud on the ironing-board.  Once roused, he opened his eyes to see his mother standing  
on the hearth-rug with the hot iron near her cheek, listening, as it  
were, to the heat.  Her still face, with the mouth closed tight from  
suffering and disillusion and self-denial, and her nose the smallest  
bit on one side, and her blue eyes so young, quick, and warm, made  
his heart contract with love.  When she was quiet, so, she looked  
brave and rich with life, but as if she had been done out of her  
rights.  It hurt the boy keenly, this feeling about her that she had  
never had her life's fulfilment: and his own incapability to make  
up to her hurt him with a sense of impotence, yet made him patiently   
dogged inside.  It was his childish aim.  
</p><p>She spat on the iron, and a little ball of spit bounded, raced off  
the dark, glossy surface.  Then, kneeling, she rubbed the iron on the  
sack lining of the hearth-rug vigorously.  She was warm in the ruddy  
firelight.  Paul loved the way she crouched and put her head on one  
side.  Her movements were light and quick.  It was always a pleasure  
to watch her.  Nothing she ever did, no movement she ever made,  
could have been found fault with by her children.  The room was  
warm and full of the scent of hot linen.  Later on the clergyman  
came and talked softly with her.  
</p><p>Paul was laid up with an attack of bronchitis.  He did not mind  
much.  What happened happened, and it was no good kicking  
against the pricks.  He loved the evenings, after eight o'clock, when  
the light was put out, and he could watch the fire-flames spring  
over the darkness of the walls and ceiling; could watch huge shadows   
waving and tossing, till the room seemed full of men who battled silently.  
</p><p>On retiring to bed, the father would come into the sickroom.  He  
was always very gentle if anyone were ill.  But he disturbed the  
atmosphere for the boy.  
</p><p> "Are ter asleep, my darlin'?" Morel asked softly.  
</p><p> "No; is my mother comin'?"  
</p><p> "She's just finishin' foldin' the clothes.  Do you want anything?"  
Morel rarely "thee'd" his son.</p>  
  
  
  
<pb n="71"/>   
<p>"I don't want nothing.  But how long will she be?"  
</p><p>"Not long, my duckie."  
</p><p>The father waited undecidedly on the hearth-rug for a moment  
or two.  He felt his son did not want him.  Then he went to the top  
of the stairs and said to his wife:  
</p><p>"This childt's axin' for thee; how long art goin' to be?"  
</p><p>"Until I've finished, good gracious! Tell him to go to sleep."  
</p><p>"She says you're to go to sleep," the father repeated gently to  
Paul.  
</p><p>"Well, I want her to come," insisted the boy.  
</p><p>"He says he can't go off till you  come,"  Morel  called  downstairs.  
</p><p>"Eh, dear! I shan't be long.  And do stop shouting downstairs.   
There's the other children &mdash; "  
</p><p>Then Morel came again and crouched before the bedroom fire.   
He loved a fire dearly.  
</p><p>"She says she won't be long," he said.  
</p><p>He loitered about indefinitely.  The boy began to get feverish  
with irritation.  His father's presence seemed to aggravate all his  
sick impatience.  At last Morel, after having stood looking at his  
son awhile, said softly:  
</p><p>"Good-night, my darling."  
</p><p>"Good-night," Paul replied, turning round in relief to be alone.  
</p><p>Paul loved to sleep with his mother.  Sleep is still most perfect,  
in spite of hygienists, when it is shared with a beloved.  The warmth,  
the security and peace of soul, the utter comfort from the touch of  
the other, knits the sleep, so that it takes the body and soul completely   
in its healing.  Paul lay against her and slept, and got better;  
whilst she, always a bad sleeper, fell later on into a profound sleep  
that seemed to give her faith.  
</p><p>In convalescence he would sit up in bed, see the fluffy horses  
feeding at the troughs in the field, scattering their hay on the trodden   
yellow snow; watch the miners troop home &mdash; small, black figures trailing   
slowly in gangs across the white field.  Then the night  
came up in dark blue vapour from the snow.  
</p><p>In convalescence everything was wonderful.  The snowflakes,  
suddenly arriving on the window-pane, clung there a moment like  
swallows, then were gone, and a drop of water was crawling down  
the glass.  The snowflakes whirled round the corner of the house,  
  
  
<pb n="72"/>   
  
like pigeons dashing by.  Away across the valley the little  
black train crawled doubtfully over the great whiteness.  
</p><p>While they were so poor, the children were delighted if they  
could do anything to help economically.  Annie and Paul and Arthur   
went out early in the morning, in summer, looking for mushrooms,   
hunting through the wet grass, from which the larks were  
rising, for the white-skinned, wonderful naked bodies crouched  
secretly in the green.  And if they got half a pound they felt   
exceedingly happy: there was the joy of finding something, the joy  
of accepting something straight from the hand of Nature, and the  
joy of contributing to the family exchequer.  
</p><p>But the most important harvest, after gleaning for frumenty,  
was the blackberries.  Mrs. Morel must buy fruit for puddings on  
the Saturdays; also she liked blackberries.  So Paul and Arthur  
scoured the coppices and woods and old quarries, so long as a  
blackberry was to be found, every week-end going on their search.   
In that region of mining villages blackberries became a comparative  
rarity.  But Paul hunted far and wide.  He loved being out in the  
country, among the bushes.  But he also could not bear to go home  
to his mother empty.  That, he felt, would disappoint her, and he  
would have died rather.  
</p><p>"Good gracious!" she would exclaim as the lads came in, late,  
and tired to death, and hungry, "wherever have you been?"  
</p><p>"Well," replied Paul, "there wasn't any, so we went over Misk  
Hills.  And took here, our mother!"  
</p><p>She peeped into the basket.  
</p><p>"Now, those are fine ones!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"And there's over two pounds &mdash; isn't there over two pounds"?  
</p><p>She tried the basket.  
</p><p>"Yes," she answered doubtfully.  
</p><p>Then Paul fished out a little spray.  He always brought her one  
spray, the best he could find.  
</p><p>"Pretty!" she said, in a curious tone, of a woman accepting a  
love-token.  
</p><p>The boy walked all day, went miles and miles, rather than own  
himself beaten and come home to her empty-handed.  She never  
realised this, whilst he was young.  She was a woman who waited  
for her children to grow up.  And William occupied her chiefly.  
</p><p>But when William went to Nottingham, and was not so much at  
  
<pb n="73"/>   
  
home, the mother made a companion of Paul.  The latter was   
unconsciously jealous of his brother, and William was jealous of him.  At  
the same time, they were good friends.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel's intimacy with her second son was more subtle  
and fine, perhaps not so passionate as with her eldest.  It was  
the rule that Paul should fetch the money on Friday afternoons.   
The colliers of the five pits were paid on Fridays, but not individually.   
All the earnings of each stall were put down to the chief butty, as  
contractor, and he divided the wages again, either in the public-house or in his own home.  So that the children could fetch the  
money, school closed early on Friday afternoons.  Each of the Morel  
children &mdash; William, then Annie, then Paul &mdash; had fetched the money  
on Friday afternoons, until they went themselves to work.  Paul  
used to set off at half-past three, with a little calico bag in his  
pocket.  Down all the paths, women, girls, children, and men were  
seen trooping to the offices.  
</p><p>These offices were quite handsome: a new, red-brick building,  
almost like a mansion, standing in its own grounds at the end of  
Greenhill Lane.  The waiting-room was the hall, a long, bare room  
paved with blue brick, and having a seat all round, against the wall.   
Here sat the colliers in their pit-dirt.  They had come up early.  The  
women and children usually loitered about on the red gravel paths.   
Paul always examined the grass border, and the big grass bank,  
because in it grew tiny pansies and tiny forget-me-nots.  There was  
a sound of many voices.  The women had on their Sunday hats.   
The girls chattered loudly.  Little dogs ran here and there.  The  
green shrubs were silent all around.  
</p><p>Then from inside came the cry "Spinney Park &mdash; Spinney Park."  
All the folk for Spinney Park trooped inside.  When it was time for  
Bretty to be paid, Paul went in among the crowd.  The pay-room  
was quite small.  A counter went across, dividing it into half.    
Behind the counter stood two men-Mr.  Braithwaite and his clerk,  
Mr. Winterbottom.  Mr. Braithwaite was large, somewhat of the  
stem patriarch in appearance, having a rather thin white beard.   
He was usually muffled in an enormous silk neckerchief, and right  
up to the hot summer a huge fire burned in the open grate.  No window   
was open.  Sometimes in winter the air scorched the throats of  
the people, coming in from the freshness.  Mr. Winterbottom was  
rather small and fat, and very bald.  He made remarks that were not  
  
  
<pb n="74"/>   
  
witty, whilst his chief launched forth patriarchal admonitions  
against the colliers.  
</p><p>The room was crowded with miners in their pit-dirt, men who  
had been home and changed, and women, and one or two children,  
and usually a dog.  Paul was quite small, so it was often his fate to  
be jammed behind the legs of the men, near the fire which scorched  
him.  He knew the order of the names-they went according to stall  
number.  
</p><p>"Holliday," came the ringing voice of Mr. Braithwaite.  Then  
Mrs. Holliday stepped silently forward, was paid, drew aside.  
</p><p>"Bower &mdash; John Bower."  
</p><p>A boy stepped to the counter.  Mr. Braithwaite, large and   
irascible, glowered at him over his spectacles.  
</p><p>"John Bower!" he repeated.  
</p><p>"It's me," said the boy.  
</p><p>"Why, you used to 'ave a different nose than that," said glossy  
Mr. Winterbottom, peering over the counter.  The people tittered,  
thinking of John Bower senior.  
</p><p>"How is it your father's not come!" said Mr. Braithwaite, in a  
large and magisterial voice.  
</p><p>"He's badly," piped the boy.  
</p><p>"You should tell him to keep off the drink," pronounced the  
great cashier.  
</p><p>"An' niver mind if he puts his foot through yer," said a mocking  
voice from behind.  
</p><p>All the men laughed.  The large and important cashier looked  
down at his next sheet.  
</p><p>"Fred Pilkington!" he called, quite indifferent.  
</p><p>Mr. Braithwaite was an important shareholder in the firm.   
</p><p>Paul knew his turn was next but one, and his heart began to beat.   
He was pushed against the chimney-piece.  His calves were burning.   
But he did not hope to get through the wall of men.  
</p><p>"Walter Morel!" came the ringing voice.  
</p><p>"Here!" piped Paul, small and inadequate.  
</p><p>"Morel &mdash; Walter Morel!" the cashier repeated, his finger and  
thumb on the invoice, ready to pass on.  
</p><p>Paul was suffering convulsions of self-consciousness, and could  
not or would not shout.  The backs of the men obliterated him.   
Then Mr. Winterbottom came to the rescue.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="75"/>   
<p>"He's here.  Where is he? Morel's lad?"  
</p><p>The fat, red, bald little man peered round with keen eyes.  He  
pointed at the fireplace.  The colliers looked round, moved aside,  
and disclosed the boy.  
</p><p>"Here he is!" said Mr. Winterbottom.  
</p><p>Paul went to the counter.  
</p><p>"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence.  Why don't you shout  
up when you're called?" said Mr. Braithwaite.  He banged on to the  
invoice a five-pound bag of silver, then in a delicate and pretty  
movement, picked up a little ten-pound column of gold, and  
plumped it beside the silver.  The gold slid in a bright stream over  
the paper.  The cashier finished counting off the money; the  
boy dragged the whole down the counter to Mr. Winterbottom,  
to whom the stoppages for rent and tools must be paid.  Here he suffered  
again.  
</p><p>"Sixteen an' six," said Mr. Winterbottom.  
</p><p>The lad was too much upset to count.  He pushed forward some  
loose silver and half a sovereign.  
</p><p>"How much do you think you've given me?" asked Mr. Winterbottom.  
</p><p>The boy looked at him, but said nothing.  He had not the faintest  
notion.  
</p><p>"Haven't you got a tongue in your head?"  
</p><p>Paul bit his lip, and pushed forward some more silver.  
</p><p>"Don't they teach you to count at the Board-school?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Nowt but algibbra an' French," said a collier.  
</p><p>"An' cheek an' impidence," said another.  
</p><p>Paul was keeping someone waiting.  With trembling fingers he  
got his money into the bag and slid out.  He suffered the tortures of  
the damned on these occasions.  
</p><p>His relief, when he got outside, and was walking along the   
Mansfield Road, was infinite.  On the park wall the mosses were green.   
There were some gold and some white fowls pecking under the  
apple trees of an orchard.  The colliers were walking home in a  
stream.  The boy went near the wall, self-consciously.  He knew  
many of the men, but could not recognise them in their dirt.  And  
this was a new torture to him.  
</p><p>When he got down to the New Inn, at Bretty, his father was not  
  
  
<pb n="76"/>   
  
yet come.  Mrs. Wharmby, the landlady, knew him.  His grandmother,   
Morel's mother, had been Mrs. Wharmby's friend.  
</p><p>"Your father's not come yet," said the landlady, in the peculiar  
haff-scornful, half-patronising voice of a woman who talks chiefly  
to grown men.  "Sit you down."  
</p><p>Paul sat down on the edge of the bench in the bar.  Some colliers  
were "reckoning" &mdash; sharing out their money &mdash; in a corner; others  
came in.  They all glanced at the boy without speaking.  At last  
Morel came; brisk, and with something of an air, even in his  
blackness.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he said rather tenderly to his son.  "Have you bested  
me? Shall you have a drink of something?"  
</p><p>Paul and all the children were bred up fierce anti-alcoholists, and  
he would have suffered more in drinking a lemonade before au  
the men than in having a tooth drawn.  
</p><p>The landlady looked at him de haut en bas, rather pitying,  
and at the same time, resenting his clear, fierce morality.  Paul  
went home, glowering.  He entered the house silently.  Friday was baking  
day, and there was usually a hot bun.  His mother put it before him.  
</p><p>Suddenly he turned on her in a fury, his eyes flashing:  
</p><p>"I'm not going to the office any more," he said.  
</p><p>"Why, what's the matter?" his mother asked in surprise.  His   
sudden rages rather amused her.  
</p><p>"I'm not going any more," he declared.  
</p><p>"Oh, very well, tell your father so."  
</p><p>He chewed his bun as if he hated it.  
</p><p>"I'm not &mdash; I'm not going to fetch the money."  
</p><p>"Then one of Carlin's children can go; they'd be glad enough of  
the sixpence," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>This sixpence was Paul's only income.  It mostly went in buying  
birthday presents; but it was an income, and he treasured it.  But &mdash;  
</p><p>"They can have it, then!" he said.  "I don't want it."  
</p><p>"Oh, very well," said his mother.  "But you needn't bully me  
about it."  
</p><p>"They're hateful, and common, and hateful, they are, and I'm  
not going any more.  Mr. Braithwaite drops his 'h's', an' Mr.   
Winterbottom says 'You was'."  
</p><p>"And is that why you won't go any more?" smiled Mrs. Morel.   
</p><p>The boy was silent for some time.  His face was pale, his eyes  
  
  
<pb n="77"/>   
dark and furious.  His mother moved about at her work, taking no  
notice of him.  
</p><p>"They always stan' in front of me, so's I can't get out," he said.   
</p><p>"Well, my lad, you've only to ask them," she replied.  
</p><p>"An' then Alfred Winterbottom says, 'What do they teach you  
at the Board-school?"'  
</p><p>"They never taught him much," said Mrs. Morel, "that is a fact  
&mdash; neither manners nor wit &mdash; and his cunning he was born with."  
</p><p>So, in her own way, she soothed him.  His ridiculous   
hypersensitiveness made her heart ache.  And sometimes the fury in his eyes  
roused her, made her sleeping soul lift up its head a moment,  
surprised.  
</p><p>"What was the cheque?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Seventeen pounds eleven and fivepence, and sixteen and six  
stoppages," replied the boy.  "It's a good week; and only five shil-lings stoppages for my father."  
</p><p>So she was able to calculate how much her husband had earned,  
and could call him to account if he gave her short money.  Morel  
always kept to himself the secret of the week's amount.  
</p><p>Friday was the baking night and market night.  It was the  
rule that Paul should stay at home and bake.  He loved to stop  
in and draw or read; he was very fond of drawing.  Annie always   
"gallivanted" on Friday nights; Arthur was enjoying himself as usual.   
So the boy remained alone.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel loved her marketing.  In the tiny market-place on  
the top of the hill, where four roads, from Nottingham and Derby,  
Ilkeston and Mansfield, meet, many stalls were erected.  Brakes  
ran in from surrounding villages.  The market-place was fun of  
women, the streets packed with men.  It was amazing to see so  
many men everywhere in the streets.  Mrs. Morel usually quarrelled  
with her lace woman, sympathised with her fruit man &mdash; who was a  
gabey, but his wife was a bad 'un &mdash; laughed with the fish man &mdash; who  
was a scamp but so droll &mdash; put the linoleum man in his place, was  
cold with the odd-wares man, and only went to the crockery man  
when she was driven &mdash; or drawn by the cornflowers on a little dish;  
then she was coldly polite.  
</p><p>"I wondered how much that little dish was," she said.  
</p><p>"Sevenpence to you."  
</p><p>"Thank you."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="78"/>   
  
<p>She put the dish down and walked away; but she could not leave  
the market-place without it.  Again she went by where the pots lay  
coldly on the floor, and she glanced at the dish furtively,   
pretending not to.  
</p><p>She was a little woman, in a bonnet and a black costume.  Her  
bonnet was in its third year; it was a great grievance to Annie.  
</p><p>"Mother!" the girl implored, "don't wear that nubbly little  
bonnet."  
</p><p>"Then what else shall I wear," replied the mother tartly.  "And  
I'm sure it's right enough."  
</p><p>It had started with a tip; then had had flowers; now was reduced  
to black lace and a bit of jet.  
</p><p>"It looks rather come down," said Paul.  "Couldn't you give it a  
pick-me-up?"  
</p><p>"I'll jowl your head for impudence," said Mrs. Morel, and she  
tied the strings of the black bonnet valiantly under her chin.  
</p><p>She glanced at the dish again.  Both she and her enemy, the pot  
man, had an uncomfortable feeling, as if there were something  
between them.  Suddenly he shouted:  
</p><p>"Do you want it for fivepence?"  
</p><p>She started.  Her heart hardened; but then she stooped and took  
up her dish.  
</p><p>"I'll have it," she said.  
</p><p>"Yer'll do me the favour, like?" he said.  "Yer'd better spit in  
it, like yer do when y'ave something give yer."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel paid him the fivepence in a cold manner.  
</p><p>"I don't see you give it me," she said.  "You wouldn't let me  
have it for fivepence if you didn't want to."  
</p><p>"In this flamin', scrattlin' place you may count yerself lucky if  
you can give your things away," he growled.  
</p><p>"Yes; there are bad times, and good," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>But she had forgiven the pot man.  They were friends.  She dare  
now finger his pots.  So she was happy.  
</p><p>Paul was waiting for her.  He loved her home-coming.  She was  
always her best so &mdash; triumphant, tired, laden with parcels, feeling  
rich in spirit.  He heard her quick, light step in the entry and looked  
up from his drawing.  
</p><p>"Oh!" she sighed, smiling at him from the doorway.</p>  
  
  
  
  
  
  
<pb n="79"/>   
<p>"My word, you are loaded!" he exclaimed, putting down his  
brush.  
</p><p>"I am!" she gasped.  "That brazen Annie said she'd meet me.  
Such a weight!"  
</p><p>She dropped her string bag and her packages on the table.  
</p><p>"Is the bread done?" she asked, going to the oven.  
</p><p>"The last one is soakining," he replied.  "You needn't look, I've  
not forgotten it."  
</p><p>"Oh, that pot man!" she said, closing the oven door.  "You  
know what a wretch I've said he was? Well, I don't think he's quite  
so bad."  
</p><p>"Don't you?"  
</p><p>The boy was attentive to her.  She took off her little black bonnet.   
</p><p>"No.  I think he can't make any money &mdash; well, it's everybody's  
cry alike nowadays &mdash; and it makes him disagreeable."  
</p><p>"It would me," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Well, one can't wonder at it.  And he let me have &mdash; how much do  
you think he let me have this for?"  
</p><p>She took the dish out of its rag of newspaper, and stood   
looking on it with joy.  
</p><p>"Show me!" said Paul.  
</p><p>The two stood together gloating over the dish.  
</p><p>"I love cornflowers on things," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Yes, and I thought of the teapot you bought me &mdash; "  
</p><p>"One and three," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Fivepence!"  
</p><p>"It's not enough, mother."  
</p><p>"No.  Do you know, I fairly sneaked off with it.  But I'd been  
extravagant, I couldn't afford any more.  And he needn't have let  
me have it if he hadn't wanted to."  
</p><p>"No, he needn't, need he," said Paul, and the two comforted  
each other from the fear of having robbed the pot man.  
</p><p>"We c'n have stewed fruit in it," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Or custard, or a jelly," said his mother.  
</p><p>"Or radishes and lettuce," said he.  
</p><p>"Don't forget that bread," she said, her voice bright with glee.  
</p><p>Paul looked in the oven; tapped the loaf on the base.  
</p><p>"It's done," he said, giving it to her.  
</p><p>She tapped it also.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="80"/>   
  
<p>"Yes," she replied, going to unpack her bag.  "Oh, and I'm a  
wicked, extravagant woman.  I know I s'll come to want."  
</p><p>He hopped to her side eagerly, to see her latest extravagance.   
She unfolded another lump of newspaper and disclosed some roots  
of pansies and of crimson daisies.  
</p><p>"Four penn'orth!" she moaned.  
</p><p>"How cheap!" he cried.  
</p><p>"Yes, but I couldn't afford it this week of all weeks."  
</p><p>"But lovely!" he cried.  
</p><p>"Aren't they!" she exclaimed, giving way to pure joy.  "Paul,  
look at this yellow one, isn't it &mdash; and a face just like an old man!"  
</p><p>"Just!" cried Paul, stooping to sniff.  "And smells that nice! But  
he's a bit splashed."  
</p><p>He ran in the scullery, came back with the flannel, and carefully  
washed the pansy.  
</p><p>"Now look at him now he's wet!" he said.  
</p><p>"Yes!" she exclaimed, brimful of satisfaction.  
</p><p>The children of Scargill Street felt quite select.  At the end where  
the Morels lived there were not many young things.  So the few  
were more united.  Boys and girls played together, the girls joining  
in the fights and the rough games, the boys taking part in the   
dancing games and rings and make-belief of the girls.  
</p><p>Annie and Paul and Arthur loved the winter evenings, when it  
was not wet.  They stayed indoors till the colliers were all gone  
home, till it was thick dark, and the street would be deserted.  Then  
they tied their scarves round their necks, for they scorned overcoats,   
as all the colliers' children did, and went out.  The entry was  
very dark, and at the end the whole great night opened out, in a  
hollow, with a little tangle of lights below where Minton pit lay,  
and another far away opposite for Selby.  The farthest tiny lights  
seemed to stretch out the darkness for ever.  The children looked  
anxiously down the road at the one lamp-post, which stood at the  
end of the field path.  If the little, luminous space were deserted,  
the two boys felt genuine desolation.  They stood with their hands  
in their pockets under the lamp, turning their backs on the night,  
quite miserable, watching the dark houses.  Suddenly a pinafore  
under a short coat was seen, and a long-legged girl came flying  
up.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="81"/>   
<p>"Where's Billy Pillins an' your Annie an' Eddie Dakin?"  
</p><p>"I don't know."  
</p><p>But it did not matter so much &mdash; there were three now.  They set  
up a game round the lamp-post, till the others rushed up, yelling.   
Then the play went fast and furious.  
</p><p>There was only this one lamp-post.  Behind was the great scoop  
of darkness, as if all the night were there.  In front, another wide,  
dark way opened over the hill brow.  Occasionally somebody came  
out of this way and went into the field down the path.  In a dozen  
yards the night had swallowed them.  The children played on.  
</p><p>They were brought exceedingly close together owing to their  
isolation.  If a quarrel took place, the whole play was spoilt.   
Arthur was very touchy, and Billy Pillins &mdash; really Philips &mdash; was  
worse.  Then Paul had to side with  Arthur, and on Paul's side went  
Alice, while Billy Pillins always had Emmie Limb and Eddie  
Dakin to back him up.  Then the six would fight, hate with a fury of  
hatred, and flee home in terror.  Paul never forgot, after one of  
these fierce internecine fights, seeing a big red moon lift itself up,  
slowly, between the waste road over the hill-top, steadily, like a  
great bird.  And he thought of the Bible, that the moon should be  
turned to blood.  And the next day he made haste to be friends with  
Billy Pillins.  And then the wild, intense games went on again under  
the lamp-post, surrounded by so much darkness.  Mrs. Morel, going   
into her parlour, would hear the children singing away:  
 </p> 
<l>         "My shoes are made of Spanish leather,</l>  
<l>            My socks are made of silk;</l>  
<l>          I wear a ring on every finger,</l>  
<l>            I wash myself in milk."</l>  
  
<p>They sounded so perfectly absorbed in the game as their voices  
came out of the night, that they had the feel of wild creatures  
singing.  It stirred the mother; and she understood when they  
came in at eight o'clock, ruddy, with brilliant eyes, and quick, passionate  
speech.  
</p><p>They all loved the Scargill Street house for its openness, for the  
great scallop of the world it had in view.  On summer evenings the  
women would stand against the field fence, gossiping, facing  
the west, watching the sunsets flare quickly out, till the Derbyshire  
  
  
<pb n="82"/>   
  
hills ridged across the crimson far away, like the black crest of a  
newt.  
</p><p>In this summer season the pits never turned full time,   
particularly the soft coal.  Mrs. Dakin, who lived next door to Mrs. Morel,  
going to the field fence to shake her hearth-rug, would spy men  
coming slowly up the hill.  She saw at once they were colliers.  Then  
she waited, a tall, thin, shrew-faced woman, standing on the hill  
brow, almost like a menace to the poor colliers who were toiling  
up. It was only eleven o'clock.  From the far-off wooded hills the  
haze that hangs like fine black crape at the back of a summer morning   
had not yet dissipated.  The first man came to the stile.   
"Chock-chock!" went the gate under his thrust.  
</p><p>"What, han' yer knocked off?" cried Mrs. Dakin.  
</p><p>"We han, missis."  
</p><p>"It's a pity as they letn yer goo," she said sarcastically.  
</p><p>"It is that," replied the man.  
</p><p>"Nay, you know you're flig to come up again," she said.  
</p><p>And the man went on.  Mrs. Dakin, going up her yard, spied  
Mrs. Morel taking the ashes to the ash-pit.  
</p><p>"I reckon Minton's knocked off, missis," she cried.  
</p><p>"Isn't it sickenin!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel in wrath.  
</p><p>"Ha! But I'n just seed Jont Hutchby."  
</p><p>"They might as well have saved their shoe-leather," said Mrs.  
Morel.  And both women went indoors disgusted.  
</p><p>The colliers, their faces scarcely blackened, were trooping home  
again.  Morel hated to go back.  He loved the sunny morning.  But  
he had gone to pit to work, and to be sent home again spoilt his  
temper.  
</p><p>"Good gracious, at this time!" exclaimed his wife, as he  
entered.  
</p><p>"Can I help it, woman?" he shouted.  
</p><p>"And I've not done half enough dinner."  
</p><p>"Then I'll eat my bit o' snap as I took with me," he bawled  
pathetically.  He felt ignominious and sore.  
</p><p>And the children, coming home from school, would wonder  
to see their father eating with his dinner the two thick slices of  
rather dry and dirty bread-and-butter that had been to pit and back.  
</p><p>"What's my dad eating his snap for now?" asked Arthur.  
</p><p>"I should ha'e it holled at me if I didna," snorted Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="83"/>   
<p>"What a story!" exclaimed his wife.  
</p><p>"An' is it goin' to be wasted?" said Morel.  "I'm not such a  
extravagant mortal as you lot, with your waste.  If I drop a bit of  
bread at pit, in all the dust an' dirt, I pick it up an' eat it."  
</p><p>"The mice would eat it," said Paul.  "It wouldn't be wasted."  
</p><p>"Good bread-an'-butter's not for mice, either," said Morel.   
"Dirty or not dirty, I'd eat it rather than it should be wasted."  
</p><p>"You might leave it for the mice and pay for it out of your next  
pint," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Oh, might I?" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>They were very poor that autumn.  William had just gone away  
to London, and his mother missed his money.  He sent ten shillings   
once or twice, but he had many things to pay for at first.  His  
letters came regularly once a week.  He wrote a good deal to his  
mother, telling her all his life, how he made friends, and was   
exchanging lessons with a Frenchman, how he enjoyed London.  His  
mother felt again he was remaining to her just as when he was at  
home.  She wrote to him every week her direct, rather witty letters.   
All day long, as she cleaned the house, she thought of him.  He was  
in London: he would do well.  Almost, he was like her knight who  
wore her favour in the battle.  
</p><p>He was coming at Christmas for five days.  There had never been  
such preparations.  Paul and Arthur scoured the land for holly and  
evergreens.  Annie made the pretty paper hoops in the old-fashioned way.  And there was unheard-of extravagance in the  
larder.  Mrs. Morel made a big and magnificent cake.  Then, feeling  
queenly, she showed Paul how to blanch almonds.  He skinned the  
long nuts reverently, counting them all, to see not one was lost.  It  
was said that eggs whisked better in a cold place.  So the boy stood  
in the scullery, where the temperature was nearly at freezing-point,  
and whisked and whisked, and flew in excitement to his mother  
as the white of egg grew stiffer and more snowy.  
</p><p>"Just look, mother! Isn't it lovely?"  
</p><p>And he balanced a bit on his nose, then blew it in the air.  
</p><p>"Now, don't waste it," said the mother.  
</p><p>Everybody was mad with excitement.  William was coming on  
Christmas Eve.  Mrs. Morel surveyed her pantry.  There was a big  
plum cake, and a rice cake, jam tarts, lemon tarts, and mince-pies  
&mdash; two enormous dishes.  She was finishing cooking &mdash; Spanish tarts  
  
<pb n="84"/>   
  
and cheese-cakes.  Everywhere was decorated.  The kissing bunch  
of berried holly hung with bright and glittering things, spun slowly  
over Mrs. Morel's head as she trimmed her little tarts in the  
kitchen.  A great fire roared.  There was a scent of cooked pastry.   
He was due at seven o'clock, but he would be late.  The three  
children had gone to meet him.  She was alone.  But at a quarter to  
seven Morel came in again.  Neither wife nor husband spoke.  He  
sat in his arm-chair, quite awkward with excitement, and she  
quietly went on with her baking.  Only by the careful way in which  
she did things could it be told how much moved she was.  The  
clock ticked on.  
</p><p>"What time dost say he's coming?" Morel asked for the fifth  
time.  
</p><p>"The train gets in at half-past six," she replied emphatically &mdash;  
</p><p>"Then he'll be here at ten past seven."  
</p><p>"Eh, bless you, it'll be hours late on the Midland," she said   
indifferently.  But she hoped, by expecting him late, to bring him  
early.  Morel went down the entry to look for him.  Then he came back.  
</p><p>"Goodness, man!" she said.  "You're like an ill-sitting hen."  
</p><p>"Hadna you better be gettin' him summat t' eat ready?" asked  
the father.  
</p><p>"There's plenty of time," she answered.  
</p><p>"There's not so much as I can see on," he answered, turning  
crossly in his chair.  She began to clear her table.  The kettle was  
singing.  They waited and waited.  
</p><p>Meantime the three children were on the platform at Sethley  
Bridge, on the Midland main line, two miles from home.  They  
waited one hour.  A train came &mdash; he was not there.  Down the line  
the red and green lights shone.  It was very dark and very cold.  
</p><p>"Ask him if the London train's come," said Paul to Annie, when  
they saw a man in a tip cap.  
</p><p>"I'm not," said Annie.  "You be quiet &mdash; he might send us off."  
</p><p>But Paul was dying for the man to know they were expecting  
someone by the London train: it sounded so grand.  Yet he was  
much too much scared of broaching any man, let alone one in a  
peaked cap, to dare to ask.  The three children could scarcely go  
into the waiting-room for fear of being sent away, and for fear  
  
  
<pb n="85"/>   
something should happen whilst they were off the platform.  Still  
they waited in the dark and cold.  
</p><p>"It's an hour an' a half late," said Arthur pathetically.  
</p><p>"Well," said Annie, "it's Christmas Eve."  
</p><p>They all grew silent.  He wasn't coming.  They looked down the  
darkness of the railway.  There was London! It seemed the   
uttermost of distance.  They thought anything might happen if one came  
from London.  They were all too troubled to talk.  Cold, and unhappy,   
and silent, they huddled together on the platform.  
</p><p>At last, after more than two hours, they saw the lights of  
an engine peering round, away down the darkness.  A porter ran  
out.  The children drew back with beating hearts.  A great train,  
bound for Manchester, drew up.  Two doors opened, and from one  
of them, William.  They flew to him.  He handed parcels to them  
cheerily, and immediately began to explain that this great train bad  
stopped for his sake at such a small station as Sethley Bridge: it  
was not booked to stop.  
</p><p>Meanwhile the parents were getting anxious.  The table was set,  
the chop was cooked, everything was ready.  Mrs. Morel put on her  
black apron.  She was wearing her best dress.  Then she sat,   
pretending to read.  The minutes were a torture to her.  
</p><p>"H'm!" said Morel.  "It's an hour an' a ha'ef."  
</p><p>"And those children waiting!" she said.  
</p><p>"Th' train canna ha' come in yet," he said.  
</p><p>"I tell you, on Christmas Eve they're hours wrong."  
</p><p>They were both a bit cross with each other, so gnawed with  
anxiety.  The ash tree moaned outside in a cold, raw wind.  And  
all that space of night from London home! Mrs. Morel suffered.   
The slight click of the works inside the clock irritated her.  It was  
getting so late; it was getting unbearable.  
</p><p>At last there was a sound of voices, and a footstep in the entry.  
</p><p>"Ha's here!" cried Morel, jumping up.  
</p><p>Then he stood back.  The mother ran a few steps towards the  
door and waited.  There was a rush and a patter of feet, the door  
burst open.  William was there.  He dropped his Gladstone bag and  
took his mother in his arms.  
</p><p>"Mater!" he said.  
</p><p>"My boy!" she cried.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="86"/>   
  
<p>And for two seconds, no longer, she clasped him and kissed  
him.  Then she withdrew and said, trying to be quite, normal:  
</p><p>"But how late you are!"  
</p><p>"Aren't I!" he cried, turning to his father.  "Well, dad!"  
</p><p>The two men shook hands.  
</p><p>"Well, my lad!"  
</p><p>Morel's eyes were wet.  
</p><p>"We thought tha'd niver be commin'," he said.  
</p><p>"Oh, I'd come!" exclaimed William.  
</p><p>Then the son turned round to his mother.  
</p><p>"But you look well," she said proudly, laughing.  
</p><p>"Well!" he exclaimed.  "I should think so &mdash; coming home!"  
</p><p>He was a fine fellow, big, straight, and fearless-looking.  He  
looked round at the evergreens and the kissing bunch, and the  
little tarts that lay in their tins on the hearth.  
</p><p>"By jove! mother, it's not different!" he said, as if in relief.  
</p><p>Everybody was still for a second.  Then he suddenly sprang   
forward, picked a tart from the hearth, and pushed it whole into his  
mouth.  
</p><p>"Well, did iver you see such a parish oven!" the father exclaimed.  
</p><p>He had brought them endless presents.  Every penny he had he  
had spent on them.  There was a sense of luxury overflowing in  
the house.  For his mother there was an umbrella with gold on the  
pale handle.  She kept it to her dying day, and would have lost   
anything rather than that.  Everybody had something gorgeous, and  
besides, there were pounds of unknown sweets: Turkish delight,  
crystallised pineapple, and such-like things which, the children  
thought, only the splendour of London could provide.  And Paul  
boasted of these sweets among his friends.  
</p><p>"Real pineapple, cut off in slices, and then turned into crystal &mdash;  
fair grand!"  
</p><p>Everybody was mad with happiness in the family.  Home was  
home, and they loved it with a passion of love, whatever the   
suffering had been.  There were parties, there were rejoicings.   
People came in to see William, to see what difference London had  
made to him.  And they all found him "such a gentleman, and such  
a fine fellow, my word"!  
</p><p>When he went away again the children retired to various places  
  
  
<pb n="87"/>   
  
to weep alone.  Morel went to bed in misery, and Mrs. Morel felt  
as if she were numbed by some drug, as if her feelings were  
paralysed.  She loved him passionately.  
</p><p>He was in the office of a lawyer connected with a large   
shipping firm, and at the midsummer his chief offered him a trip in the  
Mediterranean on one of the boats, for quite a small cost.  Mrs.  
Morel wrote: "Go, go, my boy.  You may never have a chance  
again, and I should love to think of you cruising there in the  
Mediterranean almost better than to have you at home." But  
William came home for his fortnight's holiday.  Not even the  
Mediterranean, which pulled at all his young man's desire to travel, and  
at his poor man's wonder at the glamorous south, could take him  
away when he might come home.  That compensated his mother  
for much.</p>

<head>"Paul Launches into Life"  
</head>  
<p>MOREL was rather a heedless man, careless of danger.  So he had  
endless accidents.  Now, when Mrs. Morel heard the rattle of an  
empty coal-cart cease at her entry-end, she ran into the parlour to  
look, expecting almost to see her husband seated in the waggon, his  
face grey under his dirt, his body limp and sick with some hurt or  
other.  If it were he, she would run out to help.  
</p><p>About a year after William went to London, and just after Paul  
had left school, before he got work, Mrs. Morel was upstairs and  
her son was painting in the kitchen &mdash; he was very clever with his  
brush &mdash; when there came a knock at the door.  Crossly he put down  
his brush to go.  At the same moment his mother opened a window  
upstairs and looked down.  
</p><p>A pit-lad in his dirt stood on the threshold.  
</p><p>"Is this Walter Morel's?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes," said Mrs. Morel.  "What is it?"  
</p><p>But she had guessed already.  
</p><p>"Your mester's got hurt," he said.  
</p><p>"Eh, dear me!" she exclaimed.  "It's a wonder if he hadn't, lad.  
And what's he done this time?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="88"/>   
  
<p>"I don't know for sure, but it's 'is leg somewhere.  They ta'ein'  
'im ter th' 'ospital."  
</p><p>"Good gracious me!" she exclaimed.  "Eh, dear, what a one he  
is! There's not five minutes of peace, I'll be hanged if there is! His  
thumb's nearly better, and now-Did you see him?"  
</p><p>"I seed him at th' bottom.  An' I seed 'em bring 'im up in a tub,  
an' 'e wor in a dead faint.  But be shouted like anythink when Doctor   
Fraser examined him i' th' lamp cabin &mdash; an' cossed an' swore,  
an' said as 'e wor goin' to be ta'en whoam &mdash; 'e worn't goin' ter th'  
'ospital."  
</p><p>The boy faltered to an end.  
</p><p>"He would want to come home, so that I can have all the bother.  
Thank you, my lad.  Eh, dear, if I'm not sick &mdash; sick and surfeited,  
I am!"  
</p><p>She came downstairs.  Paul bad mechanically resumed his  
painting.  
</p><p>"And it must be pretty bad if they've taken him to the hospital,"  
she went on.  "But what a careless creature he is! Other men don't  
have all these accidents.  Yes, he would want to put all the burden  
on me.  Eh, dear, just as we were getting easy a bit at last.  Put those  
things away, there's no time to be painting now.  What time is there  
a train? I know I s'll have to go trailing to Keston.  I s'll have  
to leave that bedroom."  
</p><p>"I can finish it," said Paul.  
</p><p>"You needn't.  I shall catch the seven o'clock back, I should  
think.  Oh, my blessed heart, the fuss and commotion he'll make!  
And those granite setts at Tinder Hill &mdash; he might well call them  
kidney pebbles &mdash; they'll jolt him almost to bits.  I wonder why they  
can't mend them, the state they're in, an' all the men as go across  
in that ambulance.  You'd think they'd have a hospital here.  The  
men bought the ground, and, my sirs, there'd be accidents enough  
to keep it going.  But no, they must trail them ten miles in a slow  
ambulance to Nottingham.  It's a crying shame! Oh, and the fuss  
he'll make! I know he will! I wonder who's with him.  Barker, I s'd  
think.  Poor beggar, he'n wish himself anywhere rather.  But he'll  
look after him, I know.  Now there's no telling how long he'll be  
stuck in that hospital &mdash; and won't he hate it! But if it's only his leg  
it's not so bad."  
</p><p>All the time she was getting ready.  Hurriedly taking off her  
  
  
<pb n="89"/>   
bodice, she crouched at the boiler while the water ran slowly into  
her lading-can.  
</p><p>"I wish this boiler was at the bottom of the sea!" she exclaimed,  
wriggling the handle impatiently.  She had very handsome, strong  
arms, rather surprising on a smallish woman.  
</p><p>Paul cleared away, put on the kettle, and set the table.  
</p><p>"There isn't a train till four-twenty," he said.  "You've time  
enough."  
</p><p>"Oh no, I haven't!" she cried, blinking at him over the towel  
as she wiped her face.  
</p><p>"Yes, you have.  You must drink a cup of tea at any rate.  Should  
I come with you to Keston?"  
</p><p>"Come with me? What for, I should like to know? Now, what  
have I to take him? Eh, dear! His clean shirt &mdash; and it's a blessing it  
is clean.  But it had better be aired.  And stockings &mdash; he won't want  
them &mdash; and a towel, I suppose; and handkerchiefs.  Now what else?"  
</p><p>"A comb, a knife and fork and spoon," said Paul.  His father  
had been in the hospital before.  
</p><p>"Goodness knows what sort of state his feet were in,"   
continued Mrs. Morel, as she combed her long brown hair, that was  
fine as silk, and was touched now with grey.  "He's very particular  
to wash himself to the waist, but below he thinks doesn't matter.   
But there, I suppose they see plenty like it."  
</p><p>Paul had laid the table.  He cut his mother one or two pieces of  
very thin bread and butter.  
</p><p>"Here you are," he said, putting her cup of tea in her place.  
</p><p>"I can't be bothered!" she exclaimed crossly.  
</p><p>"Well, you've got to, so there, now it's put out ready," he  
insisted.  
</p><p>So she sat down and sipped her tea, and ate a little, in silence.   
She was thinking.  
</p><p>In a few minutes she was gone, to walk the two and a half miles  
to Keston Station.  All the things she was taking him she had in  
her bulging string bag.  Paul watched her go up the road between  
the hedges &mdash; a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for  
her, that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble.  And  
she, tripping so quickly in her anxiety, felt at the back of her her  
son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden  
  
  
<pb n="90"/>   
  
he could, even supporting her.  And when she was at the  
hospital, she thought: "It will upset that lad when I tell him how  
bad it is.  I'd better be careful." And when she was trudging home  
again, she felt he was coming to share her burden.  
</p><p>"Is it bad?" asked Paul, as soon as she entered the house.   
</p><p>"It's bad enough," she replied.  
</p><p>"What?"  
</p><p>She sighed and sat down, undoing her bonnet-strings.  Her son  
watched her face as it was lifted, and her small, work-hardened  
hands fingering at the bow under her chin.  
</p><p>"Well," she answered, "it's not really dangerous, but the nurse  
says it's a dreadful smash.  You see, a great piece of rock fell on  
his leg &mdash; here &mdash; and it's a compound fracture.  There are pieces of  
bone sticking through &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Ugh &mdash; how horrid!" exclaimed the children.  
</p><p>"And," she continued, "of course he says he's going to die &mdash; it  
wouldn't be him if he didn't.  'I'm done for, my lass!' he said,  
looking at me.  'Don't be so silly,' I said to him.  'You're not going  
to die of a broken leg, however badly it's smashed.' 'I s'll niver  
come out of 'ere but in a wooden box,' he groaned. 'Well,' I said,  
'if you want them to carry you into the garden in a wooden box,  
when you're better, I've no doubt they will.' 'If we think it's good  
for him,' said the Sister.  She's an awfully nice Sister, but rather  
strict."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel took off her bonnet.  The children waited in silence.  
</p><p>"Of course, he is bad," she continued, "and he will be.  It's a  
great shock, and he's lost a lot of blood; and, of course, it is a  
very dangerous smash.  It's not at all sure that it will mend so  
easily.  And then there's the fever and the mortification &mdash; if it took  
bad ways he'd quickly be gone.  But there, he's a clean-blooded  
man, with wonderful healing flesh, and so I see no reason why  
it should take bad ways.  Of course there's a wound &mdash; "  
</p><p>She was pale now with emotion and anxiety.  The three children  
realised that it was very bad for their father, and the house was  
silent, anxious.  
</p><p>"But he always gets better," said Paul after a while.  
</p><p>"That's what I tell him," said the mother.  
</p><p>Everybody moved about in silence.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="91"/>   
<p>"And he really looked nearly done for," she said.  "But the Sister  
says that is the pain."  
</p><p>Annie took away her mother's coat and bonnet.  
</p><p>"And he looked at me when I came away! I said: 'I s'll have to  
go now, Walter, because of the train-and the children.' And he  
looked at me.  It seems hard."  
</p><p>Paul took up his brush again and went on painting.  Arthur went  
outside for some coal.  Annie sat looking dismal.  And Mrs. Morel,  
in her little rocking-chair that her husband had made for her when  
the first baby was coming, remained motionless, brooding.  She  
was grieved, and bitterly sorry for the man who was hurt so much.   
But still, in her heart of hearts, where the love should have  
burned, there was a blank.  Now, when all her woman's pity was  
roused to its full extent, when she would have slaved herself to  
death to nurse him and to save him, when she would have taken  
the pain herself, if she could, somewhere far away inside her, she  
felt indifferent to him and to his suffering.  It hurt her most of an,  
this failure to love him, even when he roused her strong emotions.   
She brooded a while.  
</p><p>"And there," she said suddenly, "when I'd got half-way to  
Keston, I found I'd come out in my working boots &mdash; and look at  
them." They were an old pair of Paul's, brown and rubbed  
through at the toes.  "I didn't know what to do with myself, for  
shame," she added.  
</p><p>In the morning, when Annie and Arthur were at school, Mrs.  
Morel talked again to her son, who was helping her with her housework.  
</p><p>"I found Barker at the hospital.  He did look bad, poor little  
fellow! 'Well,' I said to him, 'what sort of a journey did you have  
with him?' 'Dunna ax me, missis!' he said.  'Ay,' I said, 'I know  
what he'd be.  "But it wor bad for him, Mrs. Morel, it wor that!' he  
said.  'I know,' I said.  'At ivry jolt I thought my 'eart would ha'  
flown clean out o' my mouth,' be said.  'An' the scream 'e gives  
sometimes! Missis, not for a fortune would I go through wi' it  
again.' 'I can quite understand it,' I said.  'It's a nasty job, though,'  
he said, 'an' one as'll be a long while afore it's right again.' 'I'm  
afraid it will,' I said.  I like Mr. Barker-I do like him.  There's  
something so manly about him."  
</p><p>Paul resumed his task silently.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="92"/>   
  
<p>"And of course," Mrs. Morel continued, "for a man like your  
father, the hospital is hard.  He can't understand rules and regula-tions.  And he won't let anybody else touch him, not if he can help  
it. When he smashed the muscles of his thigh, and it had to be  
dressed four times a day, would he let anybody but me or  
his mother do it? He wouldn't.  So, of course, he'll suffer in there  
with the nurses.  And I didn't like leaving him.  I'm sure, when I  
kissed him an' came away, it seemed a shame."  
</p><p>So she talked to her son, almost as if she were thinking aloud  
to him, and he took it in as best he could, by sharing her trouble  
to lighten it.  And in the end she shared almost everything with  
him without knowing.  
</p><p>Morel had a very bad time.  For a week he was in a critical   
condition.  Then he began to mend.  And then, knowing he was going  
to get better, the whole family sighed with relief, and proceeded  
to live happily.  
</p><p>They were not badly off whilst Morel was in the hospital.  There  
were fourteen shillings a week from the pit, ten shillings from the  
sick club, and five shillings from the Disability Fund; and then  
every week the butties had something for Mrs. Morel&mdash; five or  
seven shillings &mdash; so that she was quite well to do.  And whilst  
Morel was progressing favourably in the hospital, the family was  
extraordinarily happy and peaceful.  On Saturdays and Wednesdays  
Mrs. Morel went to Nottingham to see her husband.  Then she always   
brought back some little thing: a small tube of paints for Paul,  
or some thick paper; a couple of postcards for Annie, that the  
whole family rejoiced over for days before the girl was allowed  
to send them away; or a fret-saw for Arthur, or a bit of pretty  
wood. She described her adventures into the big shops with joy.  Soon  
the folk in the picture-shop knew her, and knew about Paul.  The  
girl in the book-shop took a keen interest in her.  Mrs. Morel was  
full of information when she got home from Nottingham.  The  
three sat round till bed-time, listening, putting in, arguing.  Then  
Paul often raked the fire.  
</p><p>"I'm the man in the house now," he used to say to his mother  
with joy.  They learned how perfectly peaceful the home could be.   
And they almost regretted &mdash; though none of them would have  
owned to such callousness &mdash; that their father was soon coming back.  
</p><p>Paul was now fourteen, and was looking for work.  He was a  
  
  
<pb n="93"/>   
  
rather small and rather finely-made boy, with dark brown hair and  
fight blue eyes.  His face had already lost its youthful chubbiness,  
and was becoming somewhat like William's &mdash; rough-featured, almost   
rugged &mdash; and it was extraordinarily mobile.  Usually he looked  
as if he saw things, was full of life, and warm; then his smile, like  
his mother's, came suddenly and was very lovable; and then,  
when there was any clog in his soul's quick running, his face went  
stupid and ugly.  He was the sort of boy that becomes a clown and  
a lout as soon as he is not understood, or feels himself held cheap;  
and, again, is adorable at the first touch of warmth.  
</p><p>He suffered very much from the first contact with anything.   
When he was seven, the starting school had been a nightmare and  
a torture to him.  But afterwards he liked it.  And now that he felt  
he had to go out into life, he went through agonies of shrinking  
self-consciousness.  He was quite a clever painter for a boy of his  
years, and he knew some French and German and mathematics  
that Mr. Heaton had taught him.  But nothing he had was of any  
commercial value.  He was not strong enough for heavy manual  
work, his mother said.  He did not care for making things with his  
hands, preferred racing about, or making excursions into the  
country, or reading, or painting.  
</p><p>"What do you want to be?" his mother asked.  
</p><p>"Anything."  
</p><p>"That is no answer," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>But it was quite truthfully the only answer he could give.  His  
ambition, as far as this world's gear went, was quietly to earn his  
thirty or thirty-five shillings a week somewhere near home, and  
then, when his father died, have a cottage with his mother, paint  
and go out as he liked, and live happy ever after.  That was his   
programme as far as doing things went.  But he was proud within  
himself, measuring people against himself, and placing them, inexorably.    
And he thought that perhaps he might also make a  
painter, the real thing.  But that he left alone.  
</p><p>"Then," said his mother, "you must look in the paper for the  
advertisements."  
</p><p>He looked at her.  It seemed to him a bitter humiliation and an  
anguish to go through.  But he said nothing.  When be got up in the  
morning, his whole being was knotted up over this one thought:  
</p><p>"I've got to go and look for advertisements for a job."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="94"/>   
  
<p>It stood in front of the morning, that thought, killing all joy and  
even life, for him.  His heart felt like a tight knot.  
</p><p>And then, at ten o'clock, he set off.  He was supposed to be a  
queer, quiet child.  Going up the sunny street of the little town, he  
felt as if all the folk he met said to themselves: "He's going to the  
Co-op. reading-room to look in the papers for a place.  He can't  
get a job.  I suppose he's living on his mother." Then he crept up  
the stone stairs behind the drapery shop at the Co-op., and peeped  
in the reading-room.  Usually one or two men were there, either  
old, useless fellows, or colliers "on the club".  So he entered, full  
of shrinking and suffering when they looked up, seated himself at  
the table, and pretended to scan the news.  He knew they would  
think: "What does a lad of thirteen want in a reading-room with  
a newspaper?" and he suffered.  
</p><p>Then he looked wistfully out of the window.  Already he was a  
prisoner of industrialism.  Large sunflowers stared over the old red  
wall of the garden opposite, looking in their jolly way down on the  
women who were hurrying with something for dinner.  The valley  
was full of corn, brightening in the sun.  Two collieries, among the  
fields, waved their small white plumes of steam.  Far off on the hills  
were the woods of Annesley, dark and fascinating.  Already his  
heart went down.  He was being taken into bondage.  His freedom  
in the beloved home valley was going now.  
</p><p>The brewers' waggons came rolling up from Keston with enormous   
barrels, four a side, like beans in a burst bean-pod.  The waggoner,   
throned aloft, rolling massively in his seat, was not so much  
below Paul's eye.  The man's hair, on his small, bullet head, was  
bleached almost white by the sun, and on his thick red arms, rocking   
idly on his sack apron, the white hairs glistened.  His red face  
shone and was almost asleep with sunshine.  The horses, handsome  
and brown, went on by themselves, looking by far the masters of  
the show.  
</p><p>Paul wished he were stupid.  "I wish," he thought to  
himself, "I was fat like him, and like a dog in the sun.  I wish  
I was a pig and a brewer's waggoner."  
</p><p>Then, the room being at last empty, he would hastily copy an  
advertisement on a scrap of paper, then another, and slip out in  
immense relief.  His mother would scan over his copies.  
</p><p>"Yes," she said, "you may try."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="95"/>   
  
<p>William had written out a letter of application, couched in   
admirable business language, which Paul copied, with variations.   
The boy's handwriting was execrable, so that William, who did  
all things well, got into a fever of impatience.  
</p><p>The elder brother was becoming quite swanky.  In London he  
found that he could associate with men far above his Bestwood  
friends in station.  Some of the clerks in the office had studied for  
the law, and were more or less going through a kind of apprenticeship.    
William airways made friends among men wherever he  
went, he was so jolly.  Therefore he was soon visiting and staying  
in houses of men who, in Bestwood, would have looked down on  
the unapproachable bank manager, and would merely have called  
indifferently on the Rector.  So he began to fancy himself as a great  
gun.  He was, indeed, rather surprised at the ease with which he  
became a gentleman.  
</p><p>His mother was glad, he seemed so pleased.  And his lodging  
in Walthamstow was so dreary.  But now there seemed to come a  
kind of fever into the young man's letters.  He was unsettled by all  
the change, he did not stand firm on his own feet, but seemed to  
spin rather giddily on the quick current of the new life.  His mother  
was anxious for him.  She could feel him losing himself.  He had  
danced and gone to the theatre, boated on the river, been out with  
friends; and she knew he sat up afterwards in his cold bedroom  
grinding away at Latin, because he intended to get on in his office,  
and in the law as much as he could.  He never sent his mother any  
money now.  It was all taken, the little he had, for his own life.  And  
she did not want any, except sometimes, when she was in a tight  
comer, and when ten shillings would have saved her much worry.   
She still dreamed of William, and of what he would do, with herself   
behind him.  Never for a minute would she admit to herself  
how heavy and anxious her heart was because of him.  
</p><p>Also he talked a good deal now of a girl he had met at a dance,  
a handsome brunette, quite young, and a lady, after whom the men  
were running thick and fast.  
</p><p>"I wonder if you would run, my boy," his mother wrote to him,  
"unless you saw all the other men chasing her too.  You feel  
safe enough and vain enough in a crowd.  But take care, and  
see how you feel when you find yourself alone, and in triumph."  
William resented these things, and continued the chase.  He had  
  
  
<pb n="96"/>   
  
taken the girl on the river.  "If you saw her, mother, you would  
know how I feel.  Tall and elegant, with the clearest of clear,  
transparent olive complexions, hair as black as jet, and such grey  
eyes-bright, mocking, like lights on water at night.  It is all very  
well to be a bit satirical till you see her.  And she dresses as well  
as any woman in London.  I tell you, your son doesn't half put his  
head up when she goes walking down Piccadilly with him."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel wondered, in her heart, if her son did not go   
walking down Piccadilly with an elegant figure and fine clothes, rather  
than with a woman who was near to him.  But she congratulated  
him in her doubtful fashion.  And, as she stood over the washing-tub, the mother brooded over her son.  She saw him saddled with  
an elegant and expensive wife, earning little money, dragging along  
and getting draggled in some small, ugly house in a suburb.  "But  
there," she told herself, "I am very likely a silly &mdash; meeting trouble  
half-way." Nevertheless, the load of anxiety scarcely ever left her  
heart, lest William should do the wrong thing by himself.  
</p><p>Presently, Paul was bidden call upon Thomas Jordan,   
Manufacturer of Surgical Appliances, at 21, Spaniel Row, Nottingham.   
Mrs. Morel was all joy.  
</p><p>"There, you see!" she cried, her eyes shining.  "You've only  
written four letters, and the third is answered.  You're lucky, my  
boy, as I always said you were."  
</p><p>Paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic  
stockings and other appliances, that figured on Mr. Jordan's   
notepaper, and he felt alarmed.  He had not known that elastic stockings   
existed.  And he seemed to feel the business world, with its  
regulated system of values, and its impersonality, and he dreaded  
it. It seemed monstrous also that a business could be run on  
wooden legs.  
</p><p>Mother and son set off together one Tuesday morning.  It was  
August and blazing hot.  Paul walked with something screwed up  
tight inside him.  He would have suffered much physical pain  
rather than this unreasonable suffering at being exposed to strangers,   
to be accepted or rejected.  Yet he chattered away with his  
mother.  He would never have confessed to her how he suffered  
over these things, and she only partly guessed.  She was gay, like a  
sweetheart.  She stood in front of the ticket-office at Bestwood,  
and Paul watched her take from her purse the money for the tickets.  
  
<pb n="97"/>   
  
As he saw her hands in their old black kid gloves getting the  
silver out of the worn purse, his heart contracted with pain of love  
of her.  
</p><p>She was quite excited, and quite gay.  He suffered because she  
would talk aloud in presence of the other travellers.  
</p><p>"Now look at that silly cow!" she said, "careering round as if it  
thought it was a circus."  
</p><p>"It's most likely a bottfly," he said very low.  
</p><p>"A what?" she asked brightly and unashamed.  
</p><p>They thought a while.  He was sensible all the time of having ber  
opposite him.  Suddenly their eyes met, and she smiled to him &mdash; a  
rare, intimate smile, beautiful with brightness and love.  Then each  
looked out of the window.  
</p><p>The sixteen slow miles of railway journey passed.  The mother  
and son walked down Station Street, feeling the excitement of lovers   
having an adventure together.  In Carrington Street they stopped  
to hang over the parapet and look at the barges on the canal  
below.  
</p><p>"It's just like Venice," he said, seeing the sunshine on the  
water that lay between high factory walls.  
</p><p>"Perhaps," she answered, smiling.  
</p><p>They enjoyed the shops immensely.  
</p><p>"Now you see that blouse," she would say, "wouldn't that just  
suit our Annie? And for one-and-eleven-three.  Isn't that cheap?"  
</p><p>"And made of needlework as well," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>They had plenty of time, so they did not hurry.  The town was  
strange and delightful to them.  But the boy was tied up inside in a  
knot of apprehension.  He dreaded the interview with Thomas  
Jordan.  
</p><p>It was nearly eleven o'clock by St. Peter's Church.  They turned  
up a narrow street that led to the Castle.  It was gloomy and old-fashioned, having low dark shops and dark green house doors  
with brass knockers, and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting on  
to the pavement; then another old shop whose small window  
looked like a cunning, half-shut eye.  Mother and son went  
cautiously, looking everywhere for "Thomas Jordan and Son".  It  
was like hunting in some wild place.  They were on tiptoe of  
excitement.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="98"/>   
  
<p>Suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in  
which were names of various firms, Thomas Jordan among them.  
</p><p>"Here it is!" said Mrs. Morel.  "But now where is it?"  
</p><p>They looked round.  On one side was a queer, dark, cardboard  
factory, on the other a Commercial Hotel.  
</p><p>"It's up the entry," said Paul.  
</p><p>And they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws of the  
dragon.  They emerged into a wide yard, like a well, with buildings  
all round.  It was littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard.   
The sunshine actually caught one crate whose straw was streaming on   
to the yard like gold.  But elsewhere the place was like a pit.   
There were several doors, and two flights of steps.  Straight in  
front, on a dirty glass door at the top of a staircase, loomed the  
ominous words "Thomas Jordan and Son &mdash; Surgical Appliances."  
Mrs. Morel went first, her son followed her.  Charles I mounted  
his scaffold with a lighter heart than had Paul Morel as he followed  
his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.  
</p><p>She pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise.  In  
front of her was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere,   
and clerks, with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going  
about in an at-home sort of way.  The light was subdued, the  
glossy cream parcels seemed luminous, the counters were of dark  
brown wood.  All was quiet and very homely.  Mrs. Morel took  
two steps forward, then waited.  Paul stood behind her.  She had on  
her Sunday bonnet and a black veil; he wore a boy's broad white  
collar and a Norfolk suit.  
</p><p>One of the clerks looked up.  He was thin and tall, with a small  
face.  His way of looking was alert.  Then he glanced round to the  
other end of the room, where was a glass office.  And then he came  
forward.  He did not say anything, but leaned in a gentle, inquiring  
fashion towards Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Can I see Mr. Jordan?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I'll fetch him," answered the young man.  
</p><p>He went down to the glass office.  A red-faced, white-whiskered  
old man looked up.  He reminded Paul of a pomeranian dog.  Then  
the same little man came up the room.  He had short legs, was  
rather stout, and wore an alpaca jacket.  So, with one ear up, as it  
were, he came stoutly and inquiringly down the room.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="99"/>   
  
<p>"Good-morning!" he said, hesitating before Mrs. Morel, in  
doubt as to whether she were a customer or not.  
</p><p>"Good-morning.  I came with my son, Paul Morel.  You asked  
him to call this morning."  
</p><p>"Come this way," said Mr. Jordan, in a rather snappy little   
manner intended to be business-like.  
</p><p>They followed the manufacturer into a grubby little room,   
upholstered in black American leather, glossy with the rubbing of  
many customers.  On the table was a pile of trusses, yellow wash-leather hoops tangled together.  They looked new and living.  Paul  
sniffed the odour of new wash-leather.  He wondered what the  
things were.  By this time he was so much stunned that he only  
noticed the outside things.  
</p><p>"Sit down!" said Mr. Jordan, irritably pointing Mrs. Morel to a  
horse-hair chair.  She sat on the edge in an uncertain fashion.  Then  
the little old man fidgeted and found a paper.  
</p><p>"Did you write this letter?" he snapped, thrusting what Paul  
recognised as his own notepaper in front of him.  
</p><p>"Yes," he answered.  
</p><p>At that moment he was occupied in two ways: first, in feeling  
guilty for telling a lie, since William had composed the letter; second,   
in wondering why his letter seemed so strange and different,  
in the fat, red hand of the man, from what it had been when it lay  
on the kitchen table.  It was like part of himself, gone astray.  He  
resented the way the man held it.  
</p><p>"Where did you learn to write?" said the old man crossly.  
</p><p>Paul merely looked at him shamedly, and did not answer.  
</p><p>"He is a bad writer," put in Mrs. Morel apologetically.  Then  
she pushed up her veil.  Paul hated her for not being prouder with  
this common little man, and he loved her face clear of the veil.  
</p><p>"And you say you know French?" inquired the little man, still  
sharply.  
</p><p>"Yes," said Paul.  
</p><p>"What school did you go to?"  
</p><p>"The Board-school."  
</p><p>"And did you learn it there?"  
</p><p>"No &mdash; I &mdash; " The boy went crimson and got no farther.  
</p><p>"His godfather gave him lessons," said Mrs. Morel, half   
pleading and rather distant.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="100"/>   
  
<p>Mr. Jordan hesitated.  Then, in his irritable manner &mdash; he always  
seemed to keep his hands ready for action &mdash; he pulled another sheet  
of paper from his pocket, unfolded it.  The paper made a crackling  
noise.  He handed it to Paul.  
</p><p>"Read that," he said.  
</p><p>It was a note in French, in thin, flimsy foreign handwriting that  
the boy could not decipher.  He stared blankly at the  
paper.  
</p><p>"'Monsieur,"' he began; then he looked in  
great confusion at Mr. Jordan.  "It's the &mdash; it's the &mdash; "  
</p><p>He wanted to say "handwriting", but his wits would no longer  
work even sufficiently to supply him with the word.  Feeling an  
utter fool, and hating Mr. Jordan, he turned desperately to the  
paper again.  
</p><p>"'Sir, &mdash; Please send me' &mdash; er &mdash; er &mdash; I can't tell   
the &mdash; er &mdash; 'two pairs &mdash; gris fil bas &mdash; grey thread stockings'   
&mdash; er &mdash; er &mdash; sans &mdash; without' &mdash; er &mdash; I can't tell the words  
&mdash; er &mdash; 'doigts &mdash; fingers' &mdash; er &mdash; I can't tell the &mdash; "  
</p><p>He wanted to say "handwriting", but the word still refused to  
come.  Seeing him stuck, Mr. Jordan snatched the paper from him.  
</p><p>"'Please send by return two pairs grey thread stockings without  
toes."  
</p><p>"Well," flashed Paul, "'doigts' means 'fingers' &mdash; as well &mdash;   
as a rule &mdash; "  
</p><p>The little man looked at him.  He did not know whether  
"doigts" meant "fingers"; he knew that for all his purposes it  
meant "toes".  
</p><p>"Fingers to stockings!" he snapped.  
</p><p>"Well, it does mean fingers," the boy persisted.  
</p><p>He hated the little man, who made such a clod of him.  Mr.   
Jordan looked at the pale, stupid, defiant boy, then at the mother, who  
sat quiet and with that peculiar shut-off look of the poor who have  
to depend on the favour of others.  
</p><p>"And when could he come?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Well," said Mrs. Morel, "as soon as you wish.  He has finished  
school now."  
</p><p>"He would live in Bestwood?"  
</p><p>"Yes; but he could be in &mdash; at the station-at quarter to eight."  
</p><p>"H'm!"  
</p><p>It ended by Paul's being engaged as junior spiral clerk at eight  
shillings a week.  The boy did not open his mouth to say another  
  
  
<pb n="101"/>                           
  
word, after having insisted that "doigts" meant "fingers".  He   
followed his mother down the stairs.  She looked at him with her  
bright blue eyes full of love and joy.  
</p><p>"I think you'll like it," she said.  
</p><p>"'Doigts' does mean 'fingers', mother, and it was the writing.   
I couldn't read the writing."  
</p><p>"Never mind, my boy.  I'm sure he'll be all right, and you won't  
see much of him.  Wasn't that first young fellow nice? I'm sure  
you'll like them."  
</p><p>"But wasn't Mr. Jordan common, mother? Does he own it  
all?"  
</p><p>"I suppose he was a workman who has got  
on," she said.  "You mustn't mind people so much.  They're not   
being disagreeable to you &mdash; it's their way.  You always   
think people are meaning things for you.  But they don't."  
</p><p>It was very sunny.  Over the big desolate space of the market-place the blue sky shimmered, and the granite cobbles of the paving   
glistened.  Shops down the Long Row were deep in obscurity,  
and the shadow was full of colour.  Just where the horse trams  
trundled across the market was a row of fruit stalls, with fruit   
blazing in the sun &mdash; apples and piles of reddish oranges, small   
greengage plums and bananas.  There was a warm scent of fruit as  
mother and son passed.  Gradually his feeling of ignominy and of  
rage sank.  
</p><p>"Where should we go for dinner?" asked the mother.  
</p><p>It was felt to be a reckless extravagance.  Paul had only been in  
an eating-house once or twice in his life, and then only to have a  
cup of tea and a bun.  Most of the people of Bestwood considered  
that tea and bread-and-butter, and perhaps potted beef, was an  
they could afford to eat in Nottingham.  Real cooked dinner was  
considered great extravagance.  Paul felt rather guilty.  
</p><p>They found a place that looked quite cheap.  But when Mrs.  
Morel scanned the bill of fare, her heart was heavy, things were so  
dear.  So she ordered kidney-pies and potatoes as the cheapest  
available dish.  
</p><p>"We oughtn't to have come here, mother," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Never mind," she said.  "We won't come again."  
</p><p>She insisted on his having a small currant tart, because he liked  
sweets.  
</p><p>"I don't want it, mother," he pleaded.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="102"/>   
  
<p>"Yes," she insisted; "you'll have it."  
</p><p>And she looked round for the waitress.  But the waitress was  
busy, and Mrs. Morel did not like to bother her then.  So the  
mother and son waited for the girl's pleasure, whilst she flirted  
among the men.  
</p><p>"Brazen hussy!" said Mrs. Morel to Paul.  "Look now, she's  
taking that man his pudding, and he came long after us."  
</p><p>"It doesn't matter, mother," said Paul.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was angry.  But she was too poor, and her orders  
were too meagre, so that she had not the courage to insist on her  
rights just then.  They waited and waited.  
</p><p>"Should we go, mother?" he said.  
</p><p>Then Mrs. Morel stood up.  The girl was passing  
near.  
</p><p>"Will you bring one currant tart?" said Mrs.  
Morel clearly.  
</p><p>The girl looked round insolently.  
</p><p>"Directly," she said.  
</p><p>"We have waited quite long enough," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>In a moment the girl came back with the tart.  Mrs. Morel asked  
coldly for the bill.  Paul wanted to sink through the floor.  He   
marvelled at his mother's hardness.  He knew that only years of battling  
had taught her to insist even so little on her rights.  She shrank as  
much as he.  
</p><p>"It's the last time I go there for anything!" she declared, when  
they were outside the place, thankful to be clear.  
</p><p>"We'll go," she said, "and look at Keep's and Boot's, and one  
or two places, shall we?"  
</p><p>They had discussions over the pictures, and Mrs. Morel wanted  
to buy him a little sable brush that be hankered after.  But this   
indulgence he refused.  He stood in front of milliners' shops and  
drapers' shops almost bored, but content for her to be interested.   
They wandered on.  
</p><p>"Now, just look at those black grapes!" she said.  "They make  
your mouth water.  I've wanted some of those for years, but I s'll  
have to wait a bit before I get them."  
</p><p>Then she rejoiced in the florists, standing in the doorway  
sniffing.  
</p><p>"Oh! oh! Isn't it simply lovely!"  
</p><p>Paul saw, in the darkness of the shop, an elegant young lady  
in black peering over the counter curiously.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="103"/>   
  
<p>"They're looking at you," he said, trying to draw his mother  
away.  
</p><p>"But what is it?" she exclaimed, refusing to be moved.  
</p><p>"Stocks!" he answered, sniffing hastily.  "Look, there's a tubful."  
</p><p>"So there is &mdash; red and white.  But really, I never knew stocks to  
smell like it!" And, to his great relief, she moved out of the door &mdash;  
way, but only to stand in front of the window.  
</p><p>"Paul!" she cried to him, who was trying to get out of sight of  
the elegant young lady in black &mdash; the shop-girl.  "Paul! Just look  
here!"  
</p><p>He came reluctantly back.  
</p><p>"Now, just look at that fuchsia!" she exclaimed, pointing.  
</p><p>"H'm!" He made a curious, interested sound.  "You'd think  
every second as the flowers was going to fall off, they hang so big  
an' heavy."  
</p><p>"And such an abundance!" she cried.  
</p><p>"And the way they drop downwards with their threads and knots!"  
</p><p>"Yes!" she exclaimed.  "Lovely!"  
</p><p>"I wonder who'll buy it!" he said.  
</p><p>"I wonder!" she answered.  "Not us."  
</p><p>"It would die in our parlour."  
</p><p>"Yes, beastly cold, sunless hole; it kills every bit of a plant you  
put in, and the kitchen chokes them to death."  
</p><p>They bought a few things, and set off towards the station.    
Looking up the canal, through the dark pass of the buildings, they saw  
the Castle on its bluff of brown, green-bushed rock, in a positive  
miracle of delicate sunshine.  
</p><p>"Won't it be nice for me to come out at dinner-times?" said  
Paul.  "I can go all round here and see everything.  I s'll love it."  
</p><p>"You will," assented his mother.  
</p><p>He had spent a perfect afternoon with his mother.  They arrived  
home in the mellow evening, happy, and glowing, and tired.  
</p><p>In the morning he filled in the form for his season-ticket and  
took it to the station.  When he got back, his mother was just   
beginning to wash the floor.  He sat crouched up on the sofa.  
</p><p>"He says it'll be here on Saturday," he said.  
</p><p>"And how much will it be?"  
</p><p>"About one pound eleven," he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="104"/>   
  
<p>She went on washing her floor in silence.  
</p><p>"Is it a lot?" he asked.  
</p><p>"It's no more than I thought," she answered.  
</p><p>"An' I s'll earn eight shillings a week," he said.  
</p><p>She did not answer, but went on with her work.  At last she said:  
</p><p>"That William promised me, when he went to London, as he'd  
give me a pound a month.  He has given me ten shillings &mdash; twice;  
and now I know he hasn't a farthing if I asked him.  Not that I want  
it. Only just now you'd think he might be able to help with this  
ticket, which I'd never expected."  
</p><p>"He earns a lot," said Paul.  
</p><p>"He earns a hundred and thirty pounds.  But they're all alike.   
They're large in promises, but it's precious little fulfilment you  
get."  
</p><p>"He spends over fifty shillings a week on himself," said Paul.  
</p><p>"And I keep this house on less than thirty," she replied; "and  
am supposed to find money for extras.  But they don't care about  
helping you, once they've gone.  He'd rather spend it on that  
dressed-up creature."  
</p><p>"She should have her own money if she's so grand," said Paul.  
</p><p>"She should, but she hasn't.  I asked him.  And I know he doesn't  
buy her a gold bangle for nothing.  I wonder whoever bought me  
a gold bangle."  
</p><p>William was succeeding with his "Gipsy", as he called her.  He  
asked the girl &mdash; her name was Louisa Lily Denys Western &mdash; for a  
photograph to send to his mother.  The photo came &mdash; a handsome  
brunette, taken in profile, smirking slightly &mdash; and, it might be, quite  
naked, for on the photograph not a scrap of clothing was to be  
seen, only a naked bust.  
</p><p>"Yes," wrote Mrs. Morel to her son, "the photograph of Louie  
is very striking, and I can see she must be attractive.  But do you  
think, my boy, it was very good taste of a girl to give her young  
man that photo to send to his mother &mdash; the first? Certainly the  
shoulders are beautiful, as you say.  But I hardly expected to see  
so much of them at the first view."  
</p><p>Morel found the photograph standing on the chiffonier in the  
parlour.  He came out with it between his thick thumb and finger.   
</p><p>"Who dost reckon this is?" he asked of his wife.  
</p><p>"It's the girl our William is going with," replied Mrs. Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="105"/>   
  
<p>"H'm! 'Er's a bright spark, from th' look on 'er, an' one as  
wunna do him owermuch good neither.  Who is she?"  
</p><p>"Her name is Louisa Lily Denys Western."  
</p><p>"An' come again to-morrer!" exclaimed the miner.  "An' is 'er  
an actress?"  
</p><p>"She is not.  She's supposed to be a lady."  
</p><p>"I'll bet!" he exclaimed, still staring at the photo.  "A lady, is  
she? An' how much does she reckon ter keep up this sort o' game  
on?"  
</p><p>"On nothing.  She lives with an old aunt, whom she hates, and  
takes what bit of money's given her."  
</p><p>"H'm!" said Morel, laying down the photograph.  "Then he's  
a fool to ha' ta'en up wi' such a one as that."  
</p><p>"Dear Mater," William replied.  "I'm sorry you didn't like the  
photograph.  It never occurred to me when I sent it, that you  
mightn't think it decent.  However, I told Gyp that it didn't quite  
suit your prim and proper notions, so she's going to send you   
another, that I hope will please you better.  She's always being  
photographed; in fact, the photographers ask her if they may take  
her for nothing."  
</p><p>Presently the new photograph came, with a little silly note from  
the girl.  This time the young lady was seen in a black satin evening  
bodice, cut square, with little puff sleeves, and black lace hanging  
down her beautiful arms.  
</p><p>"I wonder if she ever wears anything except evening clothes,"  
said Mrs. Morel sarcastically.  "I'm sure I ought to be impressed."  
</p><p>"You are disagreeable, mother," said Paul.  "I think the first one  
with bare shoulders is lovely."  
</p><p>"Do you?" answered his mother.  "Well, I don't."  
</p><p>On the Monday morning the boy got up at six to start work.  He  
had the season-ticket, which had cost such bitterness, in his   
waistcoat pocket.  He loved it with its bars of yellow across.  His mother  
packed his dinner in a small, shut-up basket, and he set off at  
a quarter to seven to catch the 7.15 train.  Mrs. Morel came to the  
entry-end to see him off.  
</p><p>It was a perfect morning.  From the ash tree the slender green  
fruits that the children call "pigeons" were twinkling gaily down  
on a little breeze, into the front gardens of the houses.  The valley  
was full of a lustrous dark haze, through which the ripe corn shimmered,  
  
  
<pb n="106"/>   
  
and in which the steam from Minton pit melted swiftly.   
Puffs of wind came.  Paul looked over the high woods of Aldersley,  
where the country gleamed, and home had never pulled at him so  
powerfully.  
</p><p>"Good-morning, mother," he said, smiling, but feeling very  
unhappy.  
</p><p>"Good-morning," she replied cheerfully and tenderly.  
</p><p>She stood in her white apron on the open road, watching him  
as he crossed the field.  He had a small, compact body that looked  
full of life.  She felt, as she saw him trudging over the field, that  
where he determined to go he would get.  She thought of William.   
He would have leaped the fence instead of going round the stile.   
He was away in London, doing well.  Paul would be working in  
Nottingham.  Now she had two sons in the world.  She could think  
of two places, great centres of industry, and feel that she had put  
a man into each of them, that these men would work out what she  
wanted; they were derived from her, they were of her, and their  
works also would be hers.  All the morning long she thought of  
Paul.  
</p><p>At eight o'clock he climbed the dismal stairs of Jordan's   
Surgical Appliance Factory, and stood helplessly against the first great  
parcel-rack, waiting for somebody to pick him up.  The place was  
still not awake.  Over the counters were great dust sheets.  Two  
men only had arrived, and were heard talking in a corner, as they  
took off their coats and rolled up their shirt-sleeves.  It was ten past  
eight.  Evidently there was no rush of punctuality.  Paul listened  
to the voices of the two clerks.  Then he heard someone cough, and  
saw in the office at the end of the room an old, decaying clerk, in  
a round smoking-cap of black velvet embroidered with red and  
green, opening letters.  He waited and waited.  One of the junior  
clerks went to the old man, greeted him cheerily and loudly.    
Evidently the old "chief" was deaf.  Then the young fellow came   
striding importantly down to his counter.  He spied Paul.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he said.  "You the new lad?"  
</p><p>"Yes," said Paul.  
</p><p>"H'm! What's your name?"  
</p><p>"Paul Morel."  
</p><p>"Paul Morel? All right, you come on round here."  
</p><p>Paul followed him round the rectangle of counters.  The room  
  
  
<pb n="107"/>   
  
was second storey.  It had a great hole in the middle of the floor,  
fenced as with a wall of counters, and down this wide shaft the  
lifts went, and the light for the bottom storey.  Also there was a  
corresponding big, oblong hole in the ceiling, and one could see  
above, over the fence of the top floor, some machinery; and right  
away overhead was the glass roof, and all light for the three storeys  
came downwards, getting dimmer, so that it was always night on  
the ground floor and rather gloomy on the second floor.  The factory   
was the top floor, the warehouse the second, the storehouse  
the ground floor.  It was an insanitary, ancient place.  
</p><p>Paul was led round to a very dark comer.  
</p><p>"This is the 'Spiral' corner," said the clerk.  "You're Spiral, with  
Pappleworth.  He's your boss, but he's not come yet.  He doesn't  
get here till half-past eight.  So you can fetch the letters, if you like,  
from Mr. Melling down there."  
</p><p>The young man pointed to the old clerk in the office.  
</p><p>"All right," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Here's a peg to hang your cap on.  Here are your entry ledgers.   
Mr. Pappleworth won't be long."  
</p><p>And the thin young man stalked away with long, busy strides  
over the hollow wooden floor.  
</p><p>After a minute or two Paul went down and stood in the door of  
the glass office.  The old clerk in the smoking-cap looked down  
over the rim of his spectacles.  
</p><p>"Good-morning," he said, kindly and impressively.  "You want  
the letters for the Spiral department, Thomas?"  
</p><p>Paul resented being called "Thomas".  But be took the letters  
and returned to his dark place, where the counter made an angle,  
where the great parcel-rack came to an end, and where there  
were three doors in the comer.  He sat on a high stool and read  
the letters &mdash; those whose handwriting was not too difficult.  They ran as  
follows:  
</p><p>"Will you please send me at once a pair of lady's silk spiral  
thigh-hose, without feet, such as I had from you last year; length,  
thigh to knee, etc." Or, "Major Chamberlain wishes to repeat  
his previous order for a silk non-elastic suspensory bandage."  
</p><p>Many of these letters, some of them in French or Norwegian,  
were a great puzzle to the boy.  He sat on his stool nervously   
awaiting the arrival of his "boss".  He suffered tortures of shyness when,  
  
  
<pb n="108"/>   
  
at half-past eight, the factory girls for upstairs trooped past him.  
</p><p>Mr. Pappleworth arrived, chewing a chlorodyne gum, at about  
twenty to nine, when all the other men were at work.  He was a  
thin, sallow man with a red nose, quick, staccato, and smartly but  
stiffly dressed.  He was about thirty-six years old.  There was   
something rather "doggy", rather smart, rather 'cute and shrewd, and  
something warm, and something slightly contemptible about him.  
</p><p>"You my new lad?" he said.  
</p><p>Paul stood up and said he was.  
</p><p>"Fetched the letters?"  
</p><p>Mr. Pappleworth gave a chew to his gum.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"Copied 'em?"  
</p><p>"No."                                                            
</p><p>"Well, come on then, let's look slippy.  Changed your coat?"  
</p><p>"No."  
</p><p>"You want to bring an old coat and leave it here." He   
pronounced the last words with the chlorodyne gum between his side  
teeth.  He vanished into the darkness behind the great parcel-rack,  
reappeared coatless, turning up a smart striped shirt-cuff over a  
thin and hairy arm.  Then he slipped into his coat.  Paul noticed  
how thin he was, and that his trousers were in folds behind.  He  
seized a stool, dragged it beside the boy's, and sat down.  
</p><p>"Sit down," he said.  
</p><p>Paul took a seat.  
</p><p>Mr. Pappleworth was very close to him.  The man seized the  
letters, snatched a long entry-book out of a rack in front of him,  
flung it open, seized a pen, and said:  
</p><p>"Now look here.  You want to copy these letters in here." He  
sniffed twice, gave a quick chew at his gum, stared fixedly at a   
letter, then went very still and absorbed, and wrote the entry rapidly,  
in a beautiful flourishing hand.  He glanced quickly at Paul.  
</p><p>"See that?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"Think you can do it all right?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"All right then, let's see you."  
</p><p>He sprang off his stool.  Paul took a pen.  Mr. Pappleworth   
disappeared.  Paul rather liked copying the letters, but he wrote slowly,  
  
  
<pb n="109"/>   
laboriously, and exceedingly badly.  He was doing the fourth letter,  
and feeling quite busy and happy, when Mr. Pappleworth reappeared.  
</p><p>"Now then, how'r' yer getting on? Done 'em?"  
</p><p>He leaned over the boy's shoulder, chewing, and smelling of  
chlorodyne.  
</p><p>"Strike my bob, lad, but you're a beautiful writer!" he exclaimed  
satirically.  "Ne'er mind, how many h'yer done? Only three! I'd 'a  
eaten 'em.  Get on, my lad, an' put numbers on 'em.  Here, look!  
Get on!"  
</p><p>Paul ground away at the letters, whilst Mr. Pappleworth fussed  
over various jobs.  Suddenly the boy started as a shrill whistle  
sounded near his ear.  Mr. Pappleworth came, took a plug out of a  
pipe, and said, in an amazingly cross and bossy voice:  
</p><p>"Yes?"  
</p><p>Paul heard a faint voice, like a woman's, out of the mouth of  
the tube.  He gazed in wonder, never having seen a speaking-tube  
before.  
</p><p>"Well," said Mr. Pappleworth disagreeably into the tube, "you'd  
better get some of your back work done, then."  
</p><p>Again the woman's tiny voice was heard, sounding pretty and  
cross.  
</p><p>"I've not time to stand here while you talk," said Mr.   
Pappleworth, and he pushed the plug into the tube.  
</p><p>"Come, my lad," he said imploringly to Paul, "there's Polly  
crying out for them orders.  Can't you buck up a bit? Here, come  
out!"  
</p><p>He took the book, to Paul's immense chagrin, and began the  
copying himself.  He worked quickly and well.  This done, he seized  
some strips of long yellow paper, about three inches wide, and  
made out the day's orders for the work-girls.  
</p><p>"You'd better watch me," he said to Paul, working all the while  
rapidly.  Paul watched the weird little drawings of legs, and thighs,  
and ankles, with the strokes across and the numbers, and the few  
brief directions which his chief made upon the yellow paper.  Then  
Mr. Pappleworth finished and jumped up.  
</p><p>"Come on with me," he said, and the yellow papers flying in his  
hands, he dashed through a door and down some stairs, into the  
  
  
<pb n="110"/>   
  
basement where the gas was burning.  They crossed the cold, damp  
storeroom, then a long, dreary room with a long table on trestles,  
into a smaller, cosy apartment, not very high, which had been  
built on to the main building.  In this room a small woman with a  
red serge blouse, and her black bair done on top of ber head, was  
waiting like a proud little bantam.  
</p><p>"Here y'are!" said Pappleworth.  
</p><p>"I think it is 'here you are'!" exclaimed Polly.  "The girls have  
been here nearly half an hour waiting.  Just think of the time  
wasted!"  
</p><p>"You think of getting your work done and not talking so much,"  
said Mr. Pappleworth.  "You could ha' been finishing off."  
</p><p>"You know quite well we finished everything off on Saturday!"  
cried Pony, flying at him, her dark eyes flashing.  
</p><p>"Tu-tu-tu-tu-terterter!" he mocked.  "Here's your new lad.   
Don't ruin him as you did the last."  
</p><p>"As we did the last!" repeated Polly.  "Yes, we do a lot of   
ruining, we do.  My word, a lad would take some ruining after he'd  
been with you."  
</p><p>"It's time for work now, not for talk," said Mr. Pappleworth  
severely and coldly.  
</p><p>"lt was time for work some time back," said Polly, marching  
away with her head in the air.  She was an erect little body of forty.  
</p><p>In that room were two round spiral machines on the bench   
under the window.  Through the inner doorway was another longer  
room, with six more machines.  A little group of girls, nicely  
dressed in white aprons, stood talking together.  
</p><p>"Have you nothing else to do but talk?" said Mr. Pappleworth.  
</p><p>"Only wait for you," said one handsome girl, laughing.  
</p><p>"Well, get on, get on," he said.  "Come on, my lad.  You'll know  
your road down here again."  
</p><p>And Paul ran upstairs after his chief.  He was given some   
checking and invoicing to do.  He stood at the desk, labouring in his   
execrable handwriting.  Presently Mr. Jordan came strutting down  
from the glass office and stood behind him, to the boy's great  
discomfort.  Suddenly a red and fat finger was thrust on the form  
he was filling in.  
</p><p>"Mr. J. A. Bates, Esquire!" exclaimed the cross voice just   
behind his ear.</p>  
  
<pb n="111"/>   
  
<p>Paul looked at "Mr. J. A. Bates, Esquire" in his own vile   
writing, and wondered what was the matter now.  
</p><p>"Didn't they teach you any better than that while they were at  
it? If you put 'Mr.' you don't put Esquire' &mdash; a man can't be both at  
once."  
</p><p>The boy regretted his too-much generosity in disposing of   
honours, hesitated, and with trembling fingers, scratched out the "Mr."  
Then all at once Mr. Jordan snatched away the invoice.  
</p><p>"Make another! Are you going to send that to a gentleman?"  
And he tore up the blue form irritably.  
</p><p>Paul, his ears red with shame, began again.  Still Mr. Jordan  
watched.  
</p><p>"I don't know what they do teach in schools.  You'll have to  
write better than that.  Lads learn nothing nowadays, but how to  
recite poetry and play the fiddle.  Have you seen his writing?" he  
asked of Mr. Pappleworth.  
</p><p>"Yes; prime, isn't it?" replied Mr. Pappleworth indifferently.  
</p><p>Mr. Jordan gave a little grunt, not unamiable.  Paul divined that  
his master's bark was worse than his bite.  Indeed, the little   
manufacturer, although he spoke bad English, was quite gentleman  
enough to leave his men alone and to take no notice of trifles.  But  
he knew he did not look like the boss and owner of the show, so  
he had to play his role of proprietor at first, to put things on a right  
footing.  
</p><p>"Let's see, what's your name?" asked Mr. Pappleworth of the  
boy.  
</p><p>"Paul Morel."  
</p><p>It is curious that children suffer so much at having to pronounce  
their own names.  
</p><p>"Paul Morel, is it? All right, you Paul-Morel through them  
things there, and then &mdash; "  
</p><p>Mr. Pappleworth subsided on to a stool, and began writing.  A  
girl came up from out of a door just behind, put some newly-pressed elastic web appliances on the counter, and returned.  Mr.  
Pappleworth picked up the whitey-blue knee-band, examined it,  
and its yellow order-paper quickly, and put it on one side.  Next  
was a flesh-pink "leg".  He went through the few things, wrote out  
a couple of orders, and called to Paul to accompany him.  This time  
they went through the door whence the girl had emerged.  There  
  
  
<pb n="112"/>   
  
Paul found himself at the top of a little wooden flight of steps,  
and below him saw a room with windows round two sides, and  
at the farther end half a dozen girls sitting bending over the benches in  
the light from the window, sewing.  They were singing together  
"Two Little Girls in Blue".  Hearing the door opened, they au  
turned round, to see Mr. Pappleworth and Paul looking down  
on them from the far end of the room.  They stopped singing.  
</p><p>"Can't you make a bit less row?" said Mr. Pappleworth.   
"Folk'll think we keep cats."  
</p><p>A hunchback woman on a high stool turned her long, rather  
heavy face towards Mr. Pappleworth, and said, in a contralto  
voice:  
</p><p>"They're all tom-cats then."  
In vain Mr. Pappleworth tried to be  impressive  for  Paul's  benefit.    
He descended the steps into the finishing-off room, and went  
to the hunchback Fanny.  She had such a short body on her high  
stool that her head, with its great bands of bright brown hair,  
seemed over large, as did her pale, heavy face.  She wore a dress  
of green-black cashmere, and her wrists, coming out of the narrow  
cuffs, were thin and flat, as she put down her work nervously.  He  
showed her something that was wrong with a knee-cap.  
</p><p>"Well," she said, "you needn't come blaming it on to me.  It's  
not my fault." Her colour mounted to her cheek.  
</p><p>"I never said it was your fault.  Will you do as I tell you?"   
replied Mr. Pappleworth shortly.  
</p><p>"You don't say it's my fault, but you'd like to make out as it  
was," the hunchback woman cried, almost in tears.  Then she  
snatched the knee-cap from her "boss", saying: "Yes, I'll do it for  
you, but you needn't be snappy."  
</p><p>"Here's your new lad," said Mr. Pappleworth.  
</p><p>Fanny turned, smiling very gently on Paul.  
</p><p>"Oh!" she said.  
</p><p>"Yes; don't make a softy of him between you."  
</p><p>"It's not us as 'ud make a softy of him," she said indignantly.  
</p><p>"Come on then, Paul," said Mr. Pappleworth.  
</p><p>"Au revoy, Paul," said one of the girls.  
</p><p>There was a titter of laughter.  Paul went out, blushing deeply,  
not having spoken a word.  
</p><p>The day was very long.  All morning the work-people were coming  
  
  
<pb n="113"/>   
  
to speak to Mr. Pappleworth.  Paul was writing or learning to  
make up parcels, ready for the midday post.  At one o'clock, or,  
rather, at a quarter to one, Mr. Pappleworth disappeared to catch  
his train: he lived in the suburbs.  At one o'clock, Paul,  
feeling very lost, took his dinner-basket down into the  
stockroom in the basement, that had the long table on trestles, and   
ate his meal hurriedly, alone in that cellar of gloom and desolation.    
Then he went out of doors.  The brightness and the freedom of the streets  
made him feel adventurous and happy.  But at two o'clock he was  
back in the corner of the big room.  Soon the work-girls went  
trooping past, making remarks.  It was the commoner girls who  
worked upstairs at the heavy tasks of truss-making and the finishing   
of artificial limbs.  He waited for Mr. Pappleworth, not knowing  
what to do, sitting scribbling on the yellow order-paper.  Mr.  
Pappleworth came at twenty minutes to three.  Then he sat and  
gossiped with Paul, treating the boy entirely as an equal, even in  
age.  
</p><p>In the afternoon there was never very much to do, unless it  
were near the week-end, and the accounts had to be made up.  At  
five o'clock all the men went down into the dungeon with the table  
on trestles, and there they had tea, eating bread-and-butter on  
the bare, dirty boards, talking with the same kind of ugly haste  
and slovenliness with which they ate their meal.  And yet upstairs  
the atmosphere among them was always jolly and clear.  The cellar  
and the trestles affected them.  
</p><p>After tea, when all the gases were lighted, work went more  
briskly.  There was the big evening post to get off.  The hose came  
up warm and newly pressed from the workrooms.  Paul had made  
out the invoices.  Now he had the packing up and addressing to  
do, then he had to weigh his stock of parcels on the scales.  Everywhere   
voices were calling weights, there was the chink of metal,  
the rapid snapping of string, the hurrying to old Mr. Melling for  
stamps.  And at last the postman came with his sack, laughing and  
jolly.  Then everything slacked off, and Paul took his dinner-basket  
and ran to the station to catch the eight-twenty train.  The day in  
the factory was just twelve hours long.  
</p><p>His mother sat waiting for him rather anxiously.  He had to walk  
from Keston, so was not home until about twenty past nine.  And  
he left the house before seven in the morning.  Mrs. Morel was  
  
  
<pb n="114"/>   
  
rather anxious about his health.  But she herself had had to put  
up with so much that she expected her children to take the same  
odds.  They must go through with what came.  And Paul stayed at  
Jordan's, although au the time he was there his health suffered  
from the darkness and lack of air and the long hours.  
</p><p>He came in pale and tired.  His mother looked at him.  She  
saw he was rather pleased, and her anxiety all went.  
</p><p>"Well, and how was it?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Ever so funny, mother," he replied.  "You don't have to work  
a bit hard, and they're nice with you."  
</p><p>"And did you get on all right?"  
</p><p>"Yes: they only say my writing's bad.  But Mr. Pappleworth  
&mdash; he's my man &mdash; said to Mr. Jordan I should be all right.  I'm Spiral,  
mother; you must come and see.  It's ever so nice."  
</p><p>Soon he liked Jordan's.  Mr. Pappleworth, who had a certain  
"saloon bar" flavour about him, was always natural, and treated  
him as if he had been a comrade.  Sometimes the "Spiral boss"  
was irritable, and chewed more lozenges than ever.  Even then,  
however, he was not offensive, but one of those people who hurt  
themselves by their own irritability more than they hurt other  
people.  
</p><p>"Haven't you done that yet?" he would cry.  "Go on, be a month  
of Sundays."  
</p><p>Again, and Paul could understand him least then, he was jocular  
and in high spirits.  
</p><p>"I'm going to bring my little Yorkshire terrier bitch tomorrow,"  
he said jubilantly to Paul.  
</p><p>"What's a Yorkshire terrier?"  
</p><p>"Don't know what a Yorkshire terrier is? Don't know a   
Yorkshire &mdash; " Mr. Pappleworth was aghast.  
</p><p>"Is it a little silky one &mdash; colours of iron and rusty silver?"  
</p><p>"That's it, my lad.  She's a gem.  She's had five pounds' worth  
of pups already, and she's worth over seven pounds herself; and  
she doesn't weigh twenty ounces."  
</p><p>The next day the bitch came.  She was a shivering, miserable  
morsel.  Paul did not care for her; she seemed so like a wet rag  
that would never dry.  Then a man called for her, and began to  
make coarse jokes.  But Mr. Pappleworth nodded his head in the  
direction of the boy, and the talk went on sotto voce.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="115"/>   
<p>Mr. Jordan only made one more excursion to watch Paul, and  
then the only fault he found was seeing the boy lay his pen on the  
counter.  
</p><p>"Put your pen in your ear, if you're going to be a clerk.  Pen  
in your ear!" And one day he said to the lad: "Why don't you hold  
your shoulders straighter? Come down here," when he took him  
into the glass office and fitted him with special braces for keeping  
the shoulders square.  
</p><p>But Paul liked the girls best.  The men seemed common and  
rather dull.  He liked them all, but they were uninteresting.  Polly,  
the little brisk overseer downstairs, finding Paul eating in the  
cellar, asked him if she could cook him anything on her little  
stove.  Next day his mother gave him a dish that could be heated up.    
He took it into the pleasant, clean room to Polly.  And very soon it grew  
to be an established custom that he should have dinner with her.   
When he came in at eight in the morning he took his basket to  
her, and when he came down at one o'clock she had his dinner  
ready.  
</p><p>He was not very tall, and pale, with thick chestnut hair, irregular  
features, and a wide, full mouth.  She was like a small bird.  He  
often called her a "robinet".  Though naturally rather quiet, he  
would sit and chatter with her for hours telling her about his home.   
The girls all liked to hear him talk.  They often gathered in a little  
circle while he sat on a bench, and held forth to them, laughing.   
Some of them regarded him as a curious little creature, so serious,  
yet so bright and jolly, and always so delicate in his way with them.   
They all liked him, and he adored them.  Polly he felt he belonged  
to. Then Connie, with her mane of red hair, her face of apple-blossom, her murmuring voice, such a lady in her shabby black  
frock, appealed to his romantic side.  
</p><p>"When you sit winding," he said, "it looks as if you were   
spinning at a spinning-wheel &mdash; it looks ever so nice.  You remind me  
of Elaine in the 'Idylls of the King'.  I'd draw you if I could."  
</p><p>And she glanced at him blushing shyly.  And later on he had a  
sketch he prized very much: Connie sitting on the stool before  
the wheel, her flowing mane of red hair on her rusty black frock,  
her red mouth shut and serious, running the scarlet thread off the  
hank on to the reel.</p>  
  
<pb n="116"/>   
  
<p>With Louie, handsome and brazen, who always seemed to  
thrust her hip at him, he usually joked.  
</p><p>Emma was rather plain, rather old, and condescending.  But  
to condescend to him made her happy, and he did not mind.   
</p><p>"How do you put needles in?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Go away and don't bother."  
</p><p>"But I ought to know how to put needles in."  
</p><p>She ground at her machine all the while steadily.  
</p><p>"There are many things you ought to know," she replied.  
</p><p>"Tell me, then, how to stick needles in the machine."  
  
</p><p>"Oh, the boy, what a nuisance he is!  Why, this is how you do  
it."  
</p><p>He watched her attentively.  Suddenly a whistle piped.  Then  
Polly appeared, and said in a clear voice:  
</p><p>"Mr. Pappleworth wants to know how much longer you're  
going to be down here playing with the girls, Paul."  
</p><p>Paul flew upstairs, calling "Good-bye!" and Emma drew herself up.  
</p><p>"It wasn't me who wanted him to play with the machine," she  
said.  
</p><p>As a rule, when all the girls came back at two o'clock, he ran  
upstairs to Fanny, the hunchback, in the finishing-off room.  Mr.  
Pappleworth did not appear till twenty to three, and he often found  
his boy sitting beside Fanny, talking, or drawing, or singing with  
the girls.  
</p><p>Often, after a minute's hesitation, Fanny would begin to sing.   
She had a fine contralto voice.  Everybody joined in the chorus, and  
it went well.  Paul was not at all embarrassed, after a while, sitting  
in the room with the half a dozen work-girls.  
</p><p>At the end of the song Fanny would say:  
</p><p>"I know you've been laughing at me."  
</p><p>"Don't be so soft, Fanny!" cried one of the girls.  
</p><p>Once there was mention of Connie's red hair.  
</p><p>"Fanny's is better, to my fancy," said Emma.  
</p><p>"You needn't try to make a fool of me," said Fanny, flushing  
deeply.  
</p><p>"No, but she has, Paul; she's got beautiful hair."  
</p><p>"It's a treat of a colour," said he.  "That coldish colour like earth,  
and yet shiny.  It's like bog-water."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="117"/>   
<p>"Goodness me!" exclaimed one girl, laughing.  
</p><p>"How I do but get criticised," said Fanny.  
</p><p>"But you should see it down, Paul," cried Emma earnestly.   
"It's simply beautiful.  Put it down for him, Fanny, if he wants  
something to paint."  
</p><p>Fanny would not, and yet she wanted to.  
</p><p>"Then I'll take it down myself," said the lad.  
</p><p>"Well, you can if you like," said Fanny.  
</p><p>And he carefully took the pins out of the knot, and the rush  
of hair, of uniform dark brown, slid over the humped back.  
</p><p>"What a lovely lot!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>The girls watched.  There was silence.  The youth shook the  
hair loose from the coil.  
</p><p>"It's splendid!" he said, smelling its perfume.  "I'll bet it's worth  
pounds."  
</p><p>"I'll leave it you when I die, Paul," said Fanny, half joking.  
</p><p>"You look just like anybody else, sitting drying their hair,"  
said one of the girls to the long-legged hunchback.  
</p><p>Poor Fanny was morbidly sensitive, always imagining insults.  
Polly was curt and business-like.  The two departments were  
for ever at war, and Paul was always finding Fanny in tears.  Then he  
was made the recipient of all her woes, and he had to plead her  
case with Polly.  
</p><p>So the time went along happily enough.  The factory had a  
homely feel.  No one was rushed or driven.  Paul always enjoyed  
it when the work got faster, towards post-time, and all the men  
united in labour.  He liked to watch his fellow-clerks at work.  The  
man was the work and the work was the man, one thing, for the  
time being.  It was different with the girls.  The real woman never  
seemed to be there at the task, but as if left out, waiting.  
</p><p>From the train going home at night he used to watch the lights  
of the town, sprinkled thick on the hills, fusing together in a blaze  
in the valleys.  He felt rich in life and happy.  Drawing farther off,  
there was a patch of lights at Bulwell like myriad petals shaken to  
the ground from the shed stars; and beyond was the red glare of  
the furnaces, playing like hot breath on the clouds.  
</p><p>He had to walk two and more miles from Keston home, up two  
long hills, down two short hills.  He was often tired, and he  
counted the lamps climbing the hill above him, how many more  
  
  
<pb n="118"/>   
  
to pass.  And from the hill-top, on pitch-dark nights, he looked  
round on the villages five or six miles away, that shone like swarms  
of glittering living things, almost a heaven against his feet.    
Marlpool and Heanor scattered the far-off darkness with brilliance.   
And occasionally the black valley space between was traced, violated   
by a great train rushing south to London or north to Scotland.   
The trains roared by like projectiles level on the darkness, fuming  
and burning, making the valley clang with their passage.  They  
were gone, and the lights of the towns and villages glittered in  
silence.  
</p><p>And then he came to the corner at home, which faced the other  
side of the night.  The ash-tree seemed a friend now.  His mother  
rose with gladness as he entered.  He put his eight shillings proudly  
on the table.  
</p><p>"It'll help, mother?" he asked wistfully.  
</p><p>"There's precious little left," she answered, "after your ticket  
and dinners and such are taken off."  
</p><p>Then he told her the budget of the day.  His life-story, like an  
Arabian Nights, was told night after night to his mother.  It was  
almost as if it were her own life.</p>

<head>"Death in the Family" </head> 
  
<p>ARTHUR MOREL was growing up.  He was a quick, careless,   
impulsive boy, a good deal like his father.  He hated study, made a  
great moan if he had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to  
his sport again.  
</p><p>In appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well  
made, graceful, and full of life.  His dark brown hair and fresh  
colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long  
lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper, made  
him a favourite.  But as he grew older his temper became uncertain.   
He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.  
</p><p>His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes.  He  
thought only of himself.  When he wanted amusement, all that  
  
  
<pb n="119"/>   
stood in his way he hated, even if it were she.  When he was in  
trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.  
</p><p>"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master  
who, he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you  
can't alter it, put up with it."  
</p><p>And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped  
him, he came to detest.  As he grew older Morel fell into a slow  
ruin.  His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in  
being, shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get  
mean and rather despicable.  There came over him a look of meanness   
and of paltriness.  And when the mean-looking elderly man  
bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious.  Moreover,  
Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting.    
When the children were growing up and in the crucial  
stage of adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their  
souls.  His manners in the house were the same as he used among  
the colliers down pit.  
</p><p>"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going  
straight out of the house when his father disgusted him.  And Morel  
persisted the more because his children hated it.  He seemed to  
take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them, and driving them  
nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of  
fourteen or fifteen.  So that Arthur, who was growing up when  
his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst of all.  
</p><p>Then, sometimes, the father would seem to feel the contemptuous   
hatred of his children.  
</p><p>"There's not a man  
tries harder for his family!" he would shout.   
"He does his best for them, and then gets treated like a dog.  But  
I'm not going to stand it, I tell you!"  
</p><p>But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as be  
imagined, they would have felt sorry.  As it was, the battle now  
went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting in  
his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence.   
They loathed him.  
</p><p>Arthur was so inflamed and irritable at last, that when he won  
a scholarship for the Grammar School in Nottingham, his mother  
decided to let him live in town, with one of her sisters, and only  
come home at week-ends.  
</p><p>Annie was still a junior teacher in the Board-school, earning  
  
  
<pb n="120"/>   
  
about four shillings a week.  But soon she would have fifteen   
shillings, since she had passed her examination, and there would be  
financial peace in the house.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel clung now to Paul.  He was quiet and not brilliant.   
But still he stuck to his painting, and still he stuck to his mother.   
Everything he did was for her.  She waited for his coming home  
in the evening, and then she unburdened herself of all she had  
pondered, or of all that had occurred to her during the day.  He  
sat and listened with his earnestness.  The two shared lives.  
</p><p>William was engaged now to his brunette, and had bought her  
an engagement ring that cost eight guineas.  The children gasped  
at such a fabulous price.  
</p><p>"Eight guineas!" said Morel.  "More fool him! If he'd gen me  
some on't, it 'ud ha' looked better on 'im."  
</p><p>"Given you some of it!" cried Mrs. Morel.  "Why give you some  
of it!"  
</p><p>She remembered he had bought no engagement ring at all, and  
she preferred William, who was not mean, if he were foolish.  But  
now the young man talked only of the dances to which he went  
with his betrothed, and the different resplendent clothes she wore;  
or he told his mother with glee how they went to the theatre like  
great swells.  
</p><p>He wanted to bring the girl home.  Mrs. Morel said she should  
come at the Christmas.  This time William arrived with a lady, but  
with no presents.  Mrs. Morel had prepared supper.  Hearing footsteps,   
she rose and went to the door.  William entered.  
</p><p>"Hello, mother!" He kissed her hastily, then stood aside to   
present a tall, handsome girl, who was wearing a costume of fine black-and-white check, and furs.  
</p><p>"Here's Gyp!"  
</p><p>Miss Western held out her hand and showed her teeth in a small  
smile.  
</p><p>"Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Morel!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"I am afraid you will be hungry," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Oh no, we had dinner in the train.  Have you got my gloves,  
Chubby?"  
</p><p>William Morel, big and raw-boned, looked at her quickly.  
</p><p>"How should I?" he said.  
</p><p>"Then I've lost them.  Don't be cross with me."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="121"/>   
  
<p>A frown went over his face, but he said nothing.  She glanced  
round the kitchen.  It was small and curious to her, with its   
glittering kissing-bunch, its evergreens behind the pictures, its wooden  
chairs and little deal table.  At that moment Morel came in.  
</p><p>"Hello, dad!"  
</p><p>"Hello, my son! Tha's let on me!"  
</p><p>The two shook hands, and William presented the lady.  She  
gave the same smile that showed her teeth.  
</p><p>"How do you do, Mr. Morel?"  
</p><p>Morel bowed obsequiously.  
</p><p>"I'm very well, and I hope so are you.  You must make yourself   
very welcome."  
</p><p>"Oh, thank you," she replied, rather amused.  
</p><p>"You will like to go upstairs," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"If you don't mind; but not if it is any trouble to you."  
</p><p>"It is no trouble.  Annie will take you.  Walter, carry up this  
box."  
</p><p>"And don't be an hour dressing yourself up," said William to  
his betrothed.  
</p><p>Annie took a brass candlestick, and, too shy almost to speak,  
preceded the young lady to the front bedroom, which Mr. and  
Mrs. Morel had vacated for her.  It, too, was small and cold by  
candle-light.  The colliers' wives only lit fires in bedrooms in case  
of extreme illness.  
</p><p>"Shall I unstrap the box?" asked Annie.  
</p><p>"Oh, thank you very much!"  
</p><p>Annie played the part of maid, then went downstairs for hot  
water.  
</p><p>"I think she's rather tired, mother," said William.  "It's a  
beastly  
journey, and we had such a rush."  
</p><p>"Is there anything I can give her?" asked Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Oh no, she'll be all right."  
</p><p>But there was a chill in the atmosphere.  After half an hour Miss  
Western came down, having put on a purplish-coloured dress,  
very fine for the collier's kitchen.  
</p><p>"I told you you'd no need to change," said William to her.  
</p><p>"Oh, Chubby!" Then she turned with that sweetish smile to  
Mrs. Morel.  "Don't you think he's always grumbling, Mrs. Morel?"  
</p><p>"Is he?" said Mrs. Morel.  "That's not very nice of him."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="122"/>   
  
<p>"It isn't, really!"  
</p><p>"You are cold," said the mother.  "Won't you come near the  
fire?"  
</p><p>Morel jumped out of his arm-chair.  
</p><p>"Come and sit you here!"  he cried.  "Come and sit you here!"  
</p><p>"No, dad, keep your own chair.  Sit on the sofa, Gyp," said William.  
</p><p>"No, no!" cried Morel.  "This cheer's warmest.  Come and sit  
here, Miss Wesson."  
</p><p>"Thank you so much," said the girl, seating herself in the   
collier's arm-chair, the place of honour.  She shivered, feeling the  
warmth of the kitchen penetrate her.  
</p><p>"Fetch me a hanky, Chubby dear!" she said, putting up her  
mouth to him, and using the same intimate tone as if they were  
alone; which made the rest of the family feel as if they ought not  
to be present.  The young lady evidently did not realise them as  
people: they were creatures to her for the present.  William winced.  
</p><p>In such a household, in Streatham, Miss Western would have  
been a lady condescending to her inferiors.  These people were  
to her, certainly clownish &mdash; in short, the working classes.  How was  
she to adjust herself?  
</p><p>"I'll go," said Annie.  
</p><p>Miss Western took no notice, as if a servant had spoken.  But  
when the girl came downstairs again with the handkerchief, she  
said: "Oh, thank you!" in a gracious way.  
</p><p>She sat and talked about the dinner on the train, which had  
been so poor; about London, about dances.  She was really very  
nervous, and chattered from fear.  Morel sat au the time smoking  
his thick twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib  
London speech, as he puffed.  Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best  
black silk blouse, answered quietly and rather briefly.  The three  
children sat round in silence and admiration.  Miss Western  
was the princess.  Everything of the best was got out for her:  
the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug.   
The children thought she must find it quite grand.  She felt strange,  
not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them.   
William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.  
</p><p>At about ten o'clock he said to her:  
</p><p>"Aren't you tired, Gyp?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="123"/>   
  
<p>"Rather, Chubby," she answered, at once in the intimate tones  
and putting her head slightly on one side.  
</p><p>"I'll light her the candle, mother," he said.  
</p><p>"Very well," replied the mother.  
</p><p>Miss Western stood up, held out her hand to Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Good-night, Mrs. Morel," she said.  
</p><p>Paul sat at the boiler, letting the water run from the tap into a  
stone beer-bottle.  Annie swathed the bottle in an old flannel  
pit-singlet, and kissed her mother good-night.  She was to share  
the room with the lady, because the house was full.  
</p><p>"You wait a minute," said Mrs. Morel to Annie.  And Annie  
sat nursing the hot-water bottle.  Miss Western shook hands all  
round, to everybody's discomfort, and took her departure, preceded   
by William.  In five minutes he was downstairs again.  His  
heart was rather sore; he did not know why.  He talked very little  
till everybody had gone to bed, but himself and his mother.  Then  
he stood with his legs apart, in his old attitude on the hearth-rug,  
and said hesitatingly:  
</p><p>"Well, mother?"  
</p><p>"Well, my son?"  
</p><p>She sat in the rocking-chair, feeling somehow hurt and   
humiliated, for his sake.  
</p><p>"Do you like her?"  
</p><p>"Yes," came the slow answer.  
</p><p>"She's shy yet, mother.  She's not used to it.  It's different from  
her aunt's house, you know."  
</p><p>"Of course it is, my boy; and she must find it difficult."  
</p><p>"She does." Then he frowned swiftly.  "If only she wouldn't  
put on her blessed airs!"  
</p><p>"It's only her first awkwardness, my boy.  She'll be all right."  
</p><p>"That's it, mother," he replied gratefully.  But his brow was  
gloomy.  "You know, she's not like you, mother.  She's not serious,  
and she can't think."  
</p><p>"She's young, my boy."  
</p><p>"Yes; and she's had no sort of show.  Her mother died  
when she was a child.  Since then she's lived with her aunt,  
whom she can't bear.  And her father was a rake.  She's had no love."  
</p><p>"No! Well, you must make up to her."  
</p><p>"And so &mdash; you have to forgive her a lot of things."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="124"/>   
  
<p>"What do you have to forgive her, my boy?"  
</p><p>"I dunno.  When she seems shallow, you have to remember  
she's never had anybody to bring her deeper side out.  And she's  
fearfully fond of me."  
</p><p>"Anybody can see that."  
</p><p>"But you know, mother &mdash; she's &mdash; she's different from us.  Those  
sort of people, like those she lives amongst, they don't seem to  
have the same principles."  
</p><p>"You mustn't judge too hastily," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>But he seemed uneasy within himself.  
</p><p>In the morning, however, he was up singing and larking round  
the house.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he called, sitting on the stairs.  "Are you getting up?"  
</p><p>"Yes," her voice called faintly.  
</p><p>"Merry Christmas!" he shouted to her.  
</p><p>Her laugh, pretty and tinkling, was heard in the bedroom.  She  
did not come down in half an hour.  
</p><p>"Was she really getting up when she said she was?" he asked  
of Annie.  
</p><p>"Yes, she was," replied Annie.  
</p><p>He waited a while, then went to the stairs again.  
</p><p>"Happy New Year," he called.  
</p><p>"Thank you, Chubby dear!" came the laughing voice, far away.  
</p><p>"Buck up!" he implored.  
</p><p>It was nearly an hour, and still he was waiting for her.  Morel,  
who always rose before six, looked at the clock.  
</p><p>"Well, it's a winder!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>The family had breakfasted, all but William.  He went to the  
foot of the stairs.  
</p><p>"Shall I have to send you an Easter egg up there?" he called,  
rather crossly.  She only laughed.  The family expected, after that  
time of preparation, something like magic.  At last she came,   
looking very nice in a blouse and skirt.  
</p><p>"Have you really been all this time getting ready?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Chubby dear! That question is not permitted, is it, Mrs.  
Morel?"  
</p><p>She played the grand lady at first.  When she went with William  
to chapel, he in his frock-coat and silk hat, she in her furs and  
London-made costume, Paul and Arthur and Annie expected  
  
  
<pb n="125"/>   
everybody to bow to the ground in admiration.  And Morel, standing   
in his Sunday suit at the end of the road, watching the gallant  
pair go, felt he was the father of princes and princesses.  
</p><p>And yet she was not so grand.  For a year now she had been a  
sort of secretary or clerk in a London office.  But while she was  
with the Morels she queened it.  She sat and let Annie or Paul wait  
on her as if they were her servants.  She treated Mrs. Morel with a  
certain glibness and Morel with patronage.  But after a day or so  
she began to change her tune.  
</p><p>William always wanted Paul or Annie to go along with them  
on their walks.  It was so much more interesting.  And Paul really  
did admire "Gipsy" wholeheartedly; in fact, his mother scarcely  
forgave the boy for the adulation with which he treated the girl.  
</p><p>On the second day, when Lily said: "Oh, Annie, do you know  
where I left my muff?" William replied:  
</p><p>"You know it is in your bedroom.  Why do you ask Annie?"  
</p><p>And Lily went upstairs with a cross, shut mouth.  But it angered  
the young man that she made a servant of his sister.  
</p><p>On the third evening William and Lily were sitting together  
in the parlour by the fire in the dark.  At a quarter to eleven Mrs.  
Morel was heard raking the fire.  William came out to the kitchen,  
followed by his beloved.  
</p><p>"Is it as late as that, mother?" he said.  She had been sitting  
alone.  
</p><p>"It is not late, my boy, but it is as late as I usually sit up."  
</p><p>"Won't you go to bed, then?" he asked.  
</p><p>"And leave you two? No, my boy, I don't believe in it."  
</p><p>"Can't you trust us, mother?"  
</p><p>"Whether I can or not, I won't do it.  You can stay tin eleven  
if you like, and I can read."  
</p><p>"Go to bed, Gyp," he said to his girl.  "We won't keep mater  
waiting."  
</p><p>"Annie has left the candle burning, Lily," said Mrs. Morel;  
"I think you will see."  
</p><p>"Yes, thank you.  Good-night, Mrs. Morel."  
</p><p>William kissed his sweetheart at the foot of the stairs, and she  
went.  He returned to the kitchen.  
</p><p>"Can't you trust us, mother?" he repeated, rather offended.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="126"/>   
  
<p>"My boy, I tell you I don't believe in leaving two  
young things like you alone downstairs when everyone else is in bed."  
</p><p>And he was forced to take this answer.  He kissed his mother  
good-night.  
</p><p>At Easter he came over alone.  And then he discussed his   
sweetheart endlessly with his mother.  
</p><p>"You know, mother, when I'm away from her I don't care for  
her a bit.  I shouldn't care if I never saw her again.  But, then, when  
I'm with her in the evenings I am awfully fond of her."  
</p><p>"It's a queer sort of love to marry on," said Mrs. Morel, "if  
she holds you no more than that!"  
</p><p>"It is funny!" he exclaimed.  It worried and perplexed him.  "But  
yet-there's so much between us now I couldn't give her up."  
</p><p>"You know best," said Mrs. Morel.  "But if it is as you say,  
wouldn't call it love &mdash; at any rate, it doesn't look much like it."  
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know, mother.  She's an orphan, and &mdash; "  
</p><p>They never came to any sort of conclusion.  He seemed puzzled  
and rather fretted.  She was rather reserved.  All his strength and  
money went in keeping this girl.  He could scarcely afford to take  
his mother to Nottingham when he came over.  
</p><p>Paul's wages had been raised at Christmas to ten shillings, to  
his great joy.  He was quite happy at Jordan's, but his health   
suffered from the long hours and the confinement.  His mother, to  
whom he became more and more significant, thought how to help.  
</p><p>His half-day holiday was on Monday afternoon.  On a Monday  
morning in May, as the two sat alone at breakfast, she said:  
</p><p>"I think it win be a fine day."  
</p><p>He looked up in surprise.  This meant something.  
</p><p>"You know Mr. Leivers has gone to live on a new farm.  Well,  
he asked me last week if I wouldn't go and see Mrs. Leivers, and  
I promised to bring you on Monday if it's fine.  Shall we go?"  
</p><p>"I say, little woman, how lovely!" he cried.  "And we'll go this  
afternoon?"  
</p><p>Paul hurried off to the station jubilant.  Down Derby Road was  
a cherry-tree that glistened.  The old brick wan by the Statutes  
ground burned scarlet, spring was a very flame of green.  And  
the steep swoop of highroad lay, in its cool morning dust, splendid   
with patterns of sunshine and shadow, perfectly still.  The  
trees sloped their great green shoulders proudly; and inside the  
  
  
<pb n="127"/>   
warehouse all the morning, the boy had a vision of spring outside.  
</p><p>When he came home at dinner-time his mother was rather excited.  
</p><p>"Are we going?" he asked.  
</p><p>"When I'm  
ready," she replied.  
</p><p>Presently he got up.  
</p><p>"Go and get dressed while I wash up," he said.  
</p><p>She did so.  He washed the pots, straightened, and then took  
her boots.  They were quite clean.  Mrs. Morel was one of those  
naturally exquisite people who can walk in mud without dirtying  
their shoes.  But Paul had to clean them for her.  They were kid  
boots at eight shillings a pair.  He, however, thought them the  
most dainty boots in the world, and he cleaned them with as much  
reverence as if they had been flowers.  
</p><p>Suddenly she appeared in the inner doorway rather shyly.  She  
had got a new cotton blouse on.  Paul jumped up and went forward.   
</p><p>"Oh, my stars!" he exclaimed.  "What a bobby-dazzler!"  
</p><p>She sniffed in a little haughty way, and put her head up.   
</p><p>"It's not a bobby-dazzler at all!" she replied.  "It's very quiet."  
</p><p>She walked forward, whilst he hovered round her.   
</p><p>"Well," she asked, quite shy, but pretending to be high and  
mighty, "do you like it?"  
</p><p>"Awfully! You are a fine little woman to go jaunting out with!"  
</p><p>He went and surveyed her from the back.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "if I was walking down the street behind you,  
I should say: 'Doesn't that little person fancy herself!"'  
</p><p>"Well, she doesn't," replied Mrs. Morel.  "She's not sure it suits  
her."  
</p><p>"Oh no! she wants to be in dirty black, looking as if she was  
wrapped in burnt paper.  It does suit you, and I say you look nice."  
</p><p>She sniffed in her little way, pleased, but pretending to know  
better.  
</p><p>"Well," she said, "it's cost me just three shillings.  You couldn't  
have got it ready-made for that price, could you?"  
</p><p>"I should think you couldn't," he replied.  
</p><p>"And, you know, it's good stuff."  
</p><p>"Awfully pretty," he said.  
</p><p>The blouse was white, with a little sprig of heliotrope and  black.  
</p><p>"Too young for me, though, I'm afraid," she said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="128"/>   
  
<p>"Too young for you!" he exclaimed in disgust.  "Why don't you  
buy some false white hair and stick it on your head."  
</p><p>"I s'll soon have no need," she replied.  "I'm going white fast  
enough."  
</p><p>"Well, you've no business to," he said.  "What do I want with  
a white-haired mother?"  
</p><p>"I'm afraid you'll have to put up with one, my lad," she  
said rather strangely.  
</p><p>They set off in great style, she carrying the umbrella William  
had given her, because of the sun.  Paul was considerably taller  
than she, though he was not big.  He fancied himself.  
</p><p>On the fallow land the young wheat shone silkily.  Minton pit  
waved its plumes of white steam, coughed, and rattled hoarsely.  
</p><p>"Now look at that!" said Mrs. Morel.  Mother and son stood  
on the road to watch.  Along the ridge of the great pit-hill  
crawled a little group in silhouette against the sky, a horse, a small  
truck, and a man.  They climbed the incline against the heavens.   
At the end the man tipped the wagon.  There was an undue rattle  
as the waste fell down the sheer slope of the enormous bank.  
</p><p>"You sit a minute, mother," he said, and she took a seat on a  
bank, whilst he sketched rapidly.  She was silent whilst he worked,  
looking round at the afternoon, the red cottages shining among  
their greenness.  
</p><p>"The world is a wonderful place," she said, "and wonderfully  
beautiful."  
</p><p>"And so's the pit," he said.  "Look how it heaps together, like  
something alive almost &mdash; a big creature that you don't know."  
</p><p>"Yes," she said.  "Perhaps!"  
</p><p>"And all the trucks standing waiting, like a string of beasts to  
be fed," he said.  
</p><p>"And very thankful I am they are standing," she said, "for that  
means they'll turn middling time this week."  
</p><p>"But I like the feel of men on things, while they're alive.  There's  
a feel of men about trucks, because they've been handled with  
men's hands, all of them."  
</p><p>"Yes," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>They went along under the trees of the highroad.  He was   
constantly informing her, but she was interested.  They passed the  
end of Nethermere, that was tossing its sunshine like petals lightly  
  
  
<pb n="129"/>   
  
in its lap.  Then they turned on a private road, and in some   
trepidation approached a big farm.  A dog barked furiously.  A woman  
came out to see.  
</p><p>"Is this the way to Willey Farm?" Mrs. Morel asked.  
</p><p>Paul hung behind in terror of being sent back.  But the woman  
was amiable, and directed them.  The mother and son went through  
the wheat and oats, over a little bridge into a wild meadow.  Peewits,   
with their white breasts glistening, wheeled and screamed  
about them.  The lake was still and blue.  High overhead a heron  
floated.  Opposite, the wood heaped on the hill, green and  
still.  
</p><p>"It's a wild road, mother," said Paul.  "Just  
like Canada."  
</p><p>"Isn't it beautiful!" said Mrs. Morel, looking round.  
</p><p>"See that heron &mdash; see &mdash; see her legs?"  
</p><p>He directed his mother, what she must see and what not.  And  
she was quite content.  
</p><p>"But now," she said, "which way? He told me through the  
wood."  
</p><p>The wood, fenced and dark, lay on their left.  
</p><p>"I can feel a bit of a path this road," said Paul.  "You've got town  
feet, somehow or other, you have."  
</p><p>They found a little gate, and soon were in a broad green alley  
of the wood, with a new thicket of fir and pine on one hand, an  
old oak glade dipping down on the other.  And among the oaks the  
bluebells stood in pools of azure, under the new green hazels,  
upon a pale fawn floor of oak-leaves.  He found flowers for her.  
</p><p>"Here's a bit of new-mown hay," he said; then, again, he  
brought her forget-me-nots.  And, again, his heart hurt with love,  
seeing her hand, used with work, holding the little bunch of flowers  
he gave her.  She was perfectly happy.  
</p><p>But at the end of the riding was a fence to climb.  Paul was over  
in a second.  
</p><p>"Come," he said, "let me help you."  
</p><p>"No, go away.  I will do it in my own way."  
</p><p>He stood below with his hands up ready to help her.  She  
climbed cautiously.  
</p><p>"What a way to climb!" he exclaimed scornfully, when she was  
safely to earth again.  
</p><p>"Hateful stiles!" she cried.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="130"/>   
  
<p>"Duffer of a little woman," he replied, "who can't get over 'em."  
</p><p>In front, along the edge of the wood, was a cluster of low red  
farm buildings.  The two hastened forward.  Flush with the wood  
was the apple orchard, where blossom was falling on the grindstone.    
The pond was deep under a hedge and overhanging oak  
trees.  Some cows stood in the shade.  The farm and buildings,  
three sides of a quadrangle, embraced the sunshine towards the  
wood.  It was very still.  
</p><p>Mother and son went into the small railed garden, where was  
a scent of red gillivers.  By the open door were some floury loaves,  
put out to cool.  A hen was just coming to peck them.  Then, in  
the doorway suddenly appeared a girl in a dirty apron.  She was  
about fourteen years old, had a rosy dark face, a bunch of short  
black curls, very fine and free, and dark eyes; shy, questioning,  
a little resentful of the strangers, she disappeared.  In a minute  
another figure appeared, a small, frail woman, rosy, with great  
dark brown eyes.  
</p><p>"Oh!" she exclaimed, smiling with a little glow, "you've come,  
then.  I am glad to see you." Her voice was intimate and rather sad.  
</p><p>The two women shook hands.  
</p><p>"Now are you sure we're not a bother to you?" said Mrs. Morel.   
"I know what a farming life is."  
</p><p>"Oh no! We're only too thankful to see a new face, it's so lost  
up here."  
</p><p>"I suppose so," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>They were taken through into the parlour &mdash; a long, low room,  
with a great bunch of guelder-roses in the fireplace.  There the  
women talked, whilst Paul went out to survey the land.  He was  
in the garden smelling the gillivers and looking at the plants,  
when the girl came out quickly to the heap of coal which stood by  
the fence.  
</p><p>"I suppose these are cabbage-roses?" he said to her, pointing  
to the bushes along the fence.  
</p><p>She looked at him with startled, big brown eyes.  
</p><p>"I suppose they are cabbage-roses when they come out?" he  
said.  
</p><p>"I don't know," she faltered.  "They're white with pink middles."  
</p><p>"Then they're maiden-blush."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="131"/>   
<p>Miriam flushed.  She had a beautiful warm colouring.  
</p><p>"I don't know," she said.  
</p><p>"You don't have much in your garden," he said.  
</p><p>"This is our first year here," she answered, in a distant, rather  
superior way, drawing back and going indoors.  He did not notice,  
but went his round of exploration.  Presently his mother came out,  
and they went through the buildings.  Paul was hugely delighted.  
</p><p>"And I suppose you have the fowls and calves and pigs to look  
after?" said Mrs. Morel to Mrs. Leivers.  
</p><p>"No," replied the little woman.  "I can't find time to look after  
cattle, and I'm not used to it.  It's as much as I can do to keep going  
in the house."  
</p><p>"Well, I suppose it is," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>Presently the girl came out.  
</p><p>"Tea is ready, mother," she said in a musical, quiet voice.  
</p><p>"Oh, thank you, Miriam, then we'll come," replied her mother,  
almost ingratiatingly.  "Would you care to have tea now, Mrs. Morel?"  
</p><p>"Of course," said Mrs. Morel. "Whenever it's ready."  
</p><p>Paul and his mother and Mrs. Leivers had tea together.  Then  
they went out into the wood that was flooded with bluebells, while  
fumy forget-me-nots were in the paths.  The mother and son were  
in ecstasy together.  
</p><p>When they got back to the house, Mr. Leivers and Edgar, the  
eldest son, were in the kitchen.  Edgar was about eighteen.  Then  
Geoffrey and Maurice, big lads of twelve and thirteen, were in  
from school.  Mr. Leivers was a good-looking man in the prime  
of life, with a golden-brown moustache, and blue eyes screwed  
up against the weather.  
</p><p>The boys were condescending, but Paul scarcely observed it.   
They went round for eggs, scrambling into all sorts of places.  As  
they were feeding the fowls Miriam came out.  The boys took no  
notice of her.  One hen, with her yellow chickens, was in a coop.   
Maurice took his hand full of corn and let the hen peck from it.  
</p><p>"Durst you do it?" he asked of Paul.  
</p><p>"Let's see," said Paul.  
</p><p>He had a small hand, warm, and rather capable-looking.  Miriam  
watched.  He held the corn to the hen.  The bird eyed it with her  
  
  
<pb n="132"/>   
  
hard, bright eye, and suddenly made a peck into his hand.  He  
started, and laughed.  "Rap, rap, rap!" went the bird's beak in his  
palm.  He laughed again, and the other boys joined.  
</p><p>"She knocks you, and nips you, but she never hurts," said Paul,  
when the last com had gone. "Now, Miriam," said Maurice, "you come   
an 'ave a go."  
</p><p>"No," she cried, shrinking back.  
</p><p>"Ha! baby.  The mardy-kid!" said her brothers.  
</p><p>"It doesn't hurt a bit," said Paul.  "It only just nips rather  
nicely."  
</p><p>"No," she still cried, shaking her black curls and shrinking.  
</p><p>"She dursn't," said Geoffrey.  "She niver durst do anything   
except recite poitry."  
</p><p>"Dursn't jump off a gate, dursn't tweedle, dursn't go on a slide,  
dursn't stop a girl hittin' her.  She can do nowt but go about  
thinkin' herself somebody.  'The Lady of the Lake.' Yah!" cried  
Maurice.  
</p><p>Miriam was crimson with shame and misery.  
</p><p>"I dare do more than you," she cried.  "You're never anything  
but cowards and bullies."  
</p><p>"Oh, cowards and bullies!" they repeated mincingly, mocking  
her speech.  
</p> 
<l>         "Not such a clown shall anger me,</l>  
<l>          A boor is answered silently,"</l>  
 <p> 
he quoted against her, shouting with laughter.  
</p><p>She went indoors.  Paul went with the boys into the orchard,  
where they had rigged up a parallel bar.  They did feats of strength.   
He was more agile than strong, but it served.  He fingered a piece  
of apple-blossom that hung low on a swinging bough.  
</p><p>"I wouldn't get the apple-blossom," said Edgar, the eldest  
brother.  "There'll be no apples next year."  
</p><p>"I wasn't going to get it," replied Paul, going away.  
</p><p>The boys felt hostile to him; they were more interested in their  
own pursuits.  He wandered back to the house to look for his  
mother.  As he went round the back, he saw Miriam kneeling in  
front of the hen-coop, some maize in her hand, biting her lip, and  
crouching in an intense attitude.  The hen was eyeing her wickedly.  
  
  
<pb n="133"/>   
Very gingerly she put forward her hand.  The hen bobbed for her.   
She drew back quickly with a cry, half of fear, half of chagrin.  
</p><p>"It won't hurt you," said Paul.  
</p><p>She flushed crimson and started up.  
</p><p>"I only wanted to try," she said in a low voice.  
</p><p>"See, it doesn't hurt," he said, and, putting only two corns in  
his palm, he let the hen peck, peck, peck at his bare hand.  "It only  
makes you laugh," he said.  
</p><p>She put her hand forward and dragged it away, tried again, and  
started back with a cry.  He frowned.  
</p><p>"Why, I'd let her take corn from my face," said Paul, "only  
she bumps a bit.  She's ever so neat.  If she wasn't, look how much  
ground she'd peck up every day."  
</p><p>He waited grimly, and watched.  At last Miriam let the bird  
peck from her hand.  She gave a little cry &mdash; fear, and pain because  
of fear &mdash; rather pathetic.  But she had done it, and she did it again.  
</p><p>"There, you see," said the boy.  "It doesn't hurt, does it?"  
</p><p>She looked at him with dilated dark eyes.  
</p><p>"No," she laughed, trembling.  
</p><p>Then she rose and went indoors.  She seemed to be in some  
way resentful of the boy.  
</p><p>"He thinks I'm only a common girl," she thought, and she  
wanted to prove she was a grand person like the "Lady of the  
Lake".  
</p><p>Paul found his mother ready to go home.  She smiled on her  
son.  He took the great bunch of flowers.  Mr. and Mrs. Leivers  
walked down the fields with them.  The hills were golden with  
evening; deep in the woods showed the darkening purple of bluebells.   
It was everywhere perfectly stiff, save for the rustling of leaves  
and birds.  
</p><p>"But it is a beautiful place," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Yes," answered Mr. Leivers; "it's a nice little place, if only  
it weren't for the rabbits.  The pasture's bitten down to nothing.   
I dunno if ever I s'll get the rent off it."  
</p><p>He clapped his hands, and the field broke into motion near  
the woods, brown rabbits hopping everywhere.  
</p><p>"Would you believe it!" exclaimed Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>She and Paul went on alone together.  
</p><p>"Wasn't it lovely, mother?" he said quietly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="134"/>   
  
<p>A thin moon was coming out.  His heart was full of happiness  
till it hurt.  His mother had to chatter, because she, too, wanted  
to cry with happiness.  
</p><p>"Now wouldn't I help that man!" she said.  "Wouldn't I see to  
the fowls and the young stock! And I'd learn to milk, and I'd talk  
with him, and I'd plan with him.  My word, if I were his wife, the  
farm would be run, I know! But there, she hasn't the strength &mdash;  
she simply hasn't the strength.  She ought never to have been   
burdened like it, you know.  I'm sorry for her, and I'm sorry for him  
too.  My word, if I'd had him, I shouldn't have thought him a bad  
husband! Not that she does either; and she's very lovable."  
</p><p>William came home again with his sweetheart at the Whitsuntide.    
He had one week of his holidays then.  It was beautiful  
weather.  As a rule, William and Lily and Paul went out in the  
morning together for a walk.  William did not talk to his beloved  
much, except to tell her things from his boyhood.  Paul talked endlessly   
to both of them.  They lay down, all three, in a meadow by  
Minton Church.  On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful  
quivering screen of poplars.  Hawthorn was dropping from the  
hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like  
laughter.  William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and  
even a bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while  
she fingered with his hair.  Paul went gathering the big daisies.  She  
had taken off her hat; her hair  was black as a horse's mane.  Paul  
came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black hair &mdash; big spangles  
of white and yellow, and just a pink touch of ragged robin.  
</p><p>"Now you look like a young witch-woman," the boy said to  
her.  "Doesn't she, William?"  
</p><p>Lily laughed.  William opened his eyes and looked at her.  In  
his gaze was a certain baffled look of misery and fierce  
appreciation.  
</p><p>"Has he made a sight of me?" she asked, laughing down on  
her lover.  
</p><p>"That he has!" said William, smiling.  
</p><p>He looked at her.  Her beauty seemed to hurt him.  He glanced  
at her flower-decked head and frowned.  
</p><p>"You look nice enough, if that's what you want to know," he  
said.  
</p><p>And she walked without her hat.  In a little while William recovered,  
  
  
<pb n="135"/>   
and was rather tender to her.  Coming to a bridge, he  
carved her initials and his in a heart.  
  
          L. L. W.<lb/>  
          W. M.<lb/>  
  
</p><p>She watched his strong, nervous hand, with its glistening hairs  
and freckles, as he carved, and she seemed fascinated by it.  
</p><p>All the time there was a feeling of sadness and warmth, and  
a certain tenderness in the house, whilst William and Lily were  
at home.  But often he got irritable.  She had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses and six blouses.  
</p><p>"Oh, would you mind," she said to Annie, "washing me these  
two blouses, and these things?"  
</p><p>And Annie stood washing when William and Lily went out  
the next morning.  Mrs. Morel was furious.  And sometimes the  
young man, catching a glimpse of his sweetheart's attitude towards  
his sister, hated her.  
</p><p>On Sunday morning she looked very beautiful in a dress of  
foulard, silky and sweeping, and blue as a jay-bird's feather, and  
in a large cream hat covered with many roses, mostly crimson.   
Nobody could admire her enough.  But in the evening, when she  
was going out, she asked again:  
</p><p>"Chubby, have you got my gloves?"  
</p><p>"Which?" asked William.  
</p><p>"My new black suede."  
</p><p>"No."  
</p><p>There was a hunt.  She had lost them.  
</p><p>"Look here, mother," said William, "that's the fourth pair she's  
lost since Christmas &mdash; at five shillings a pair!"  
</p><p>"You only gave me two of them," she remonstrated.  
</p><p>And in the evening, after supper, he stood on the hearth-rug  
whilst she sat on the sofa, and he seemed to hate her.  In the afternoon   
he had left her whilst he went to see some old friend. She  
had sat looking at a book.  After supper William wanted to write  
a letter.  
</p><p>"Here is your book, Lily," said Mrs. Morel.  "Would you care  
to go on with it for a few minutes?"  
</p><p>"No, thank you," said the girl.  "I will sit still."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="136"/>   
  
<p>"But it is so dull."  
</p><p>William scribbled irritably at a great rate.  As he sealed the   
envelope he said:  
</p><p>"Read a book! Why, she's never read a book in her life."  
</p><p>"Oh, go along!" said Mrs. Morel, cross with the exaggeration,  
</p><p>"It's true, mother &mdash; she hasn't," he cried, jumping up and taking  
his old position on the hearth-rug.  "She's never read a book in  
her life."  
</p><p>"'Er's like me," chimed in Morel.  "'Er canna see what there is  
i' books, ter sit borin' your nose in 'em for, nor more can I."  
</p><p>"But you shouldn't say these things," said Mrs. Morel to her  
son.  
</p><p>"But it's true, mother &mdash; she can't read.  What did you give her?"  
</p><p>"Well, I gave her a little thing of Annie Swan's.  Nobody wants  
to read dry stuff on Sunday afternoon."  
</p><p>"Well, I'll bet she didn't read ten lines of it."  
</p><p>"You are mistaken," said his mother.  
</p><p>All the time Lily sat miserably on the sofa.  He turned to her  
swiftly.  
</p><p>"Did you ready any?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes, I did," she replied.  
</p><p>"How much?"  
</p><p>"l don't know how many pages."  
</p><p>"Tell me one thing you read."  
</p><p>She could not.  
</p><p>She never got beyond the second page.  He read a great deal,  
and had a quick, active intelligence.  She could understand nothing  
but love-making and chatter.  He was accustomed to having all  
his thoughts sifted through his mother's mind; so, when he wanted  
companionship, and was asked in reply to be the billing and twittering   
lover, he hated his betrothed.  
</p><p>"You know, mother," he said, when he was alone with her  
at night, "she's no idea of money, she's so wessel-brained.  When  
she's paid, she'll suddenly buy such rot as marrons glaces, and  
then I have to buy her season ticket, and her extras, even her   
underclothing.  And she wants to get married, and I think myself we  
might as well get married next year.  But at this rate &mdash; "  
</p><p>"A fine mess of a marriage it would be," replied his mother.   
"I should consider it again, my boy."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="137"/>   
<p>"Oh, well, I've gone too far to break off now," he said, "and  
so I shall get married as soon as I can."  
</p><p>"Very well, my boy.  If you will, you will, and there's no   
stopping you; but I tell you, I can't sleep when I think about it."  
</p><p>"Oh, she'll be all right, mother.  We shall manage."  
</p><p>"And she lets you buy her underclothing?" asked the mother.  
</p><p>"Well," he began apologetically, "she didn't ask me; but one  
morning &mdash; and it was cold &mdash; I found her on the station shivering,  
not able to keep still; so I asked her if she was well wrapped up.   
She said: 'I think so.' So I said: 'Have you got warm underthings  
on?' And she said: 'No, they were cotton.' I asked her why on  
earth she hadn't got something thicker on in weather like that,  
and she said because she had nothing.  And there she is &mdash; a bronchial  
subject! I had to take her and get some warm things.  Well, mother,  
I shouldn't mind the money if we had any.  And, you know, she  
ought to keep enough to pay for her season-ticket; but no, she  
comes to me about that, and I have to find the money."  
</p><p>"It's a poor lookout," said Mrs. Morel bitterly.  
</p><p>He was pale, and his rugged face, that used to be so perfectly  
careless and laughing, was stamped with conflict and despair.  
</p><p>"But I can't give her up now; it's gone too far," he said.  "And,  
besides, for some things I couldn't do without her."  
</p><p>"My boy, remember you're taking your life in your hands,"  
said Mrs. Morel.  "Nothing is as bad as a marriage that's a hopeless   
failure.  Mine was bad enough, God knows, and ought to teach  
you something; but it might have been worse by a long chalk."  
</p><p>He leaned with his back against the side of the chimney-piece,  
his hands in his pockets.  He was a big, raw-boned man, who  
looked as if he would go to the world's end if he wanted to.  But  
she saw the despair on his face.  
</p><p>"I couldn't give her up now," he said.  
</p><p>"Well," she said, "remember there are worse wrongs than   
breaking off an engagement."  
</p><p>"I can't give her up now," he said.  
</p><p>The clock ticked on; mother and son remained in silence, a  
conflict between them; but he would say no more.  At last she  
said:  
</p><p>"Well, go to bed, my son.  You'll feel better in the morning,  
and perhaps you'll know better."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="138"/>   
  
<p>He kissed her, and went.  She raked the fire.  Her heart was heavy  
now as it had never been.  Before, with her husband, things had  
seemed to be breaking down in her, but they did not destroy her  
power to live.  Now her soul felt lamed in itself.  It was her hope  
that was struck.  
</p><p>And so often William manifested the same hatred towards his  
betrothed.  On the last evening at home he was railing against her.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "if you don't believe me, what she's like, would  
you believe she has been confirmed three times?"  
</p><p>"Nonsense!" laughed Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Nonsense or not, she has! That's what confirmation means  
for her-a bit of a theatrical show where she can cut a figure."  
</p><p>"I haven't, Mrs. Morel!" cried the girl &mdash; "I haven't! it   
is not true!"  
</p><p>"What!" he cried, flashing round on her.  "Once in Bromley,  
once in Beckenham, and once somewhere else."  
</p><p>"Nowhere else!" she said, in tears &mdash; "nowhere else!"  
</p><p>"It was! And if it wasn't why were you confirmed twice?"  
</p><p>"Once I was only fourteen, Mrs. Morel," she pleaded, tears  
in her eyes.  
</p><p>"Yes," said Mrs. Morel; "I can quite understand it, child.  Take  
no notice of him.  You ought to be ashamed, William, saying such  
things."  
</p><p>"But it's true.  She's religious &mdash; she had blue velvet Prayer-Books  
-and she's not as much religion, or anything else, in her than that  
table-leg.  Gets confirmed three times for show, to show herself  
off, and that's how she is in everything &mdash; everything!"  
</p><p>The girl sat on the sofa, crying.  She was not strong.  
</p><p>"As for love!" he cried, "you might as well ask a fly to love you!  
It'll love settling on you &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Now, say no more," commanded Mrs. Morel.  "If you want  
to say these things, you must find another place than this.  I am  
ashamed of you, William! Why don't you be more manly.  To do  
nothing but find fault with a girl, and then pretend you're engaged  
to her! "  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel subsided in wrath and indignation.  
</p><p>William was silent, and later he repented, kissed and comforted  
the girl.  Yet it was true, what he had said.  He hated her.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="139"/>   
<p>When they were going away, Mrs. Morel accompanied them  
as far as Nottingham.  It was a long way to Keston station.  
</p><p>"You know, mother," he said to her, "Gyp's shallow.   
Nothing goes deep with her."  
</p><p>"William, I wish you wouldn't say these things," said Mrs. Morel,  
very uncomfortable for the girl who walked beside her.  
</p><p>"But it doesn't, mother.  She's very much in love with me now,  
but if I died she'd have forgotten me in three months."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was afraid.  Her heart beat furiously, hearing the  
quiet bitterness of her son's last speech.  
</p><p>"How do you know?" she replied.  "You don't know, and   
therefore you've no right to say such a thing."  
</p><p>"He's always saying these things!" cried the girl.  
</p><p>"In three months after I was buried you'd have somebody else,  
and I should be forgotten," he said.  "And that's your love!"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel saw them into the train in Nottingham, then she  
retumed home.  
</p><p>"There's one comfort," she said to  Paul &mdash; "he'll  never  have  any  
money to marry on, that I am sure of.  And so she'll save him that  
way."  
</p><p>So she took cheer.  Matters were not yet very desperate.  She  
firmly believed William would never marry his Gipsy.  She waited,  
and she kept Paul near to her.  
</p><p>All summer long William's letters had a feverish tone; he seemed  
unnatural and intense.  Sometimes he was exaggeratedly jolly,   
usually he was flat and bitter in his letter.  
</p><p>"Ah," his mother said, "I'm afraid he's ruining himself against  
that creature, who isn't worthy of his love &mdash; no, no more than a  
rag doll."  
</p><p>He wanted to come home.  The midsummer holiday was gone;  
it was a long while to Christmas.  He wrote in wild excitement,  
saying he could come for Saturday and Sunday at Goose Fair,  
the first week in October.  
</p><p>"You are not well, my boy," said his mother, when she saw him.  
She was almost in tears at having him to herself again.  
</p><p>"No, I've not been well," he said.  "I've seemed to have a   
dragging cold all the last month, but it's going, I think."  
</p><p>It was sunny October weather.  He seemed wild with joy, like  
a schoolboy escaped; then again he was silent and reserved.  He  
  
  
<pb n="140"/>   
  
was more gaunt than ever, and there was a haggard look in his  
eyes.  
</p><p>"You are doing too much," said his mother to him.  
</p><p>He was doing extra work, trying to make some money to marry  
on, he said.  He only talked to his mother once on the Saturday  
night; then he was sad and tender about his beloved.  
</p><p>"And yet, you know, mother, for all that,  
if I died she'd be broken-hearted for two months, and then she'd   
start to forget me. You'd see, she'd never come home here to look   
at my grave, not even once."  
</p><p>"Why, William," said his mother, "you're not going to die, so  
why talk about it?"  
</p><p>"But whether or not &mdash; " he replied.  
</p><p>"And she can't help it.  She is like that, and if you choose her &mdash;  
well, you can't grumble," said his mother.  
</p><p>On the Sunday morning, as he was putting his collar on:  
</p><p>"Look," he said to his mother, holding up his chin, "what a  
rash my collar's made under my chin!"  
</p><p>Just at the junction of chin and throat was a big red inflammation.  
</p><p>"It ought not to do that," said his mother.  "Here, put a bit of  
this soothing ointment on.  You should wear different collars."  
</p><p>He went away on Sunday midnight, seeming better and more  
solid for his two days at home.  
</p><p>On Tuesday morning came a telegram from London that he  
was ill.  Mrs. Morel got off her knees from washing the floor, read  
the telegram, called a neighbour, went to her landlady and   
borrowed a sovereign, put on her things, and set off.  She hurried to  
Keston, caught an express for London in Nottingham.  She had to  
wait in Nottingham nearly an hour.  A small figure in her black  
bonnet, she was anxiously asking the porters if they knew how  
to get to Elmers End.  The journey was three hours.  She sat in her  
comer in a kind of stupor, never moving.  At King's Cross still no  
one could tell her how to get to Elmers End.  Carrying her string  
bag, that contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went  
from person to person.  At last they sent her underground to Cannon Street.  
</p><p>It was six o'clock when she arrived at William's lodging.  The  
blinds were not down.</p>  
  
<pb n="141"/>   
<p>"How is he?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No better," said the landlady.  
</p><p>She followed the woman upstairs.  William lay on the bed, with  
bloodshot eyes, his face rather discoloured.  The clothes were  
tossed about, there was no fire in the room, a glass of milk stood  
on the stand at his bedside.  No one had been with him.  
</p><p>"Why, my son!" said the mother bravely.  
</p><p>He did not answer.  He looked at her, but did not see her.  Then  
he began to say, in a dull voice, as if repeating a letter from   
dictation: "Owing to a leakage in the hold of this vessel, the sugar had  
set, and become converted into rock.  It needed  
hacking &mdash; "  
</p><p>He was quite unconscious.  It had been his business to examine  
some such cargo of sugar in the Port of London.  
</p><p>"How long has he been like this?" the mother asked the land-lady.  
</p><p>"He got home at six o'clock on Monday morning, and he seemed  
to sleep all day; then in the night we heard him talking, and this  
morning he asked for you.  So I wired, and we fetched the doctor."  
</p><p>"Will you have a fire made?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel tried to soothe her son, to keep him still.  
</p><p>The doctor came.  It was pneumonia, and, he said, a peculiar  
erysipelas, which had started under the chin where the collar  
chafed, and was spreading over the face.  He hoped it would not  
get to the brain.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel settled down to nurse.  She prayed for William,  
prayed that he would recognise her.  But the young man's face  
grew more discoloured.  In the night she struggled with him.  He  
raved, and raved, and would not come to consciousness.  At two  
o'clock, in a dreadful paroxysm, he died.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel sat perfectly still for an hour in the lodging   
bedroom; then she roused the household.  
</p><p>At six o'clock, with the aid of the charwoman, she laid him  
out; then she went round the dreary London village to the registrar  
and the doctor.  
</p><p>At nine o'clock to the cottage on Scargill Street came another  
wire:  
</p><p>"William died last night.  Let father come, bring money."  
Annie, Paul, and Arthur were at home; Mr. Morel was gone  
  
  
<pb n="142"/>   
  
to work.  The three children said not a word.  Annie began to  
whimper with fear; Paul set off for his father.  
</p><p>It was a beautiful day.  At Brinsley pit the white steam melted  
slowly in the sunshine of a soft blue sky; the wheels of the   
headstocks twinkled high up; the screen, shuffling its coal into the  
trucks, made a busy noise.  
</p><p>"I want my father; he's got to go to London," said the boy to  
the first man he met on the bank.  
</p><p>"Tha wants Walter Morel? Go in theer an' tell Joe Ward."  
</p><p>Paul went into the little top office.  
</p><p>"I want my father; he's got to go to London."  
</p><p>"Thy feyther? Is he down? What's his name?"  
</p><p>"Mr. Morel."  
</p><p>"What, Walter?  Is owt amiss?"  
</p><p>"He's  
got to go to London."  
</p><p>The man went to the telephone and rang up the bottom office.  
</p><p>"Walter Morel's wanted, number 42, Hard.  Summat's amiss;  
there's his lad here."  
</p><p>Then he turned round to Paul.  
</p><p>"He'll be up in a few minutes," he said.  
</p><p>Paul wandered out to the pit-top.  He watched the chair come  
up, with its wagon of coal.  The great iron cage sank back on its  
rest, a full carfle was hauled off, an empty tram run on to the chair,  
a bell ting'ed somewhere, the chair heaved, then dropped like a  
stone.  
</p><p>Paul did not realise William was dead; it was impossible, with  
such a bustle going on.  The puller-off swung the small truck on to  
the turn-table, another man ran with it along the bank down the  
curving lines.  
</p><p>"And William is dead, and my mother's in London, and what  
will she be doing.?" the boy asked himself, as if it were a conundrum.  
</p><p>He watched chair after chair come up, and still no father.  At  
last, standing beside a wagon, a man's form! the chair sank on its  
rests, Morel stepped off.  He was slightly lame from an accident.  
</p><p>"Is it thee, Paul? Is 'e  worse?"  
</p><p>"You've got to go to London."  
</p><p>The two walked off the pit-bank, where men were watching  
curiously.  As they came out and went along the railway, with the  
  
  
<pb n="143"/>   
sunny autumn field on one side and a wall of trucks on the other,  
Morel said in a frightened voice:  
</p><p>"'E's niver gone, child?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"When wor't?"  
</p><p>"Last night.  We had a telegram from my mother."  
</p><p>Morel walked on a few strides, then leaned up against a truck-side, his hand over his eyes.  He was not crying.  Paul stood looking  
round, waiting.  On the weighing machine a truck trundled slowly.   
Paul saw everything, except his father leaning against the truck  
as if he were tired.  
</p><p>Morel had only once before been to London.  He set off, scared  
and peaked, to help his wife.  That was on Tuesday.  The children  
were left alone in the house.  Paul went to work, Arthur went to  
school, and Annie had in a friend to be with her.  
</p><p>On Saturday night, as Paul was turning the corner, coming home  
from Keston, he saw his mother and father, who had come to  
Sethley Bridge Station.  They were walking in silence in the  
dark, tired, straggling apart.  The boy waited.  
</p><p>"Mother!" he said, in the darkness.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel's small figure seemed not to observe.  He spoke  
again.  
</p><p>"Paul!" she said, uninterestedly.  
</p><p>She let him kiss her, but she seemed unaware of him.  
</p><p>In the house she was the same &mdash; small, white, and mute.  She  
noticed nothing, she said nothing, only:  
</p><p>"The coffin will be here to-night, Walter.  You'd better see about  
some help." Then, turning to the children: "We're bringing him  
home."  
</p><p>Then she relapsed into the same mute looking into space, her  
hands folded on her lap.  Paul, looking at her, felt he could not  
breathe.  The house was dead silent.  
</p><p>"I went to work, mother," he said plaintively.  
</p><p>"Did you?" she answered, dully.  
</p><p>After half an hour Morel, troubled and bewildered, came in  
again.  
</p><p>"Wheer s'll we ha'e him when he does come?" he asked his wife.   
</p><p>"In the front-room."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="144"/>   
  
<p>"Then I'd better shift th' table?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"An' ha'e him across th' chairs?"  
</p><p>"You know there &mdash;  Yes, I suppose so."  
</p><p>Morel and Paul went, with a candle, into the parlour.  There  
was no gas there.  The father unscrewed the top of the big mahogany   
oval table, and cleared the middle of the room; then he arranged   
six chairs opposite each other, so that the coffin could stand  
on their beds.  
</p><p>"You niver seed such a length as he is!" said the miner, and  
watching anxiously as he worked.  
</p><p>Paul went to the bay window and looked out.  The ash-tree  
stood monstrous and black in front of the wide darkness.  It was  
a faintly luminous night.  Paul went back to his mother.  
</p><p>At ten o'clock Morel called:  
</p><p>"He's here!"  
</p><p>Everyone started.  There was a noise of unbarring and   
unlocking the front door, which opened straight from the night into the  
room.  
</p><p>"Bring another candle," called Morel.  
</p><p>Annie and Arthur went.  Paul followed with his mother.  He  
stood with his arm round her waist in the inner doorway.   
Down the middle of the cleared room waited six chairs, face to  
face.  In the window, against the lace curtains, Arthur held up one candle,  
and by the open door, against the night, Annie stood leaning   
forward, her brass candlestick glittering.  
</p><p>There was the noise of wheels.  Outside in the darkness of the  
street below Paul could see horses and a black vehicle, one lamp,  
and a few pale faces; then some men, miners, au in their shirt-sleeves, seemed to struggle in the obscurity.  Presently two men  
appeared, bowed beneath a great weight.  It was Morel and his  
neighbour.  
</p><p>"Steady!" called Morel, out of breath.  
</p><p>He and his fellow mounted the steep garden step, heaved into  
the candlelight with their gleaming coffin-end.  Limbs of other  
men were seen struggling behind.  Morel and Bums, in front,   
staggered; the great dark weight swayed.  
</p><p>"Steady, steady!" cried Morel, as if in pain.   
</p><p>All the six bearers were up in the small garden, holding the  
  
  
<pb n="145"/>   
great coffin aloft.  There were three more steps to the door.  The  
yellow lamp of the carriage shone alone down the black road.  
</p><p>"Now then!" said Morel.  
</p><p>The coffin swayed, the men began to mount the three steps with  
their load.  Annie's candle flickered, and she whimpered as the  
first men appeared, and the limbs and bowed heads of six men  
struggled to climb into the room, bearing the coffin that rode like  
sorrow on their living flesh.  
</p><p>"Oh, my son &mdash; my son!" Mrs. Morel sang softly, and each time  
the coffin swung to the unequal climbing of the men: "Oh, my  
son &mdash; my son &mdash; my son!"  
</p><p>"Mother!" Paul whimpered, his hand round her waist.  
</p><p>She did not hear.  
</p><p>"Oh, my son &mdash; my son!" she repeated.  
</p><p>Paul saw drops of sweat fall from his father's brow.  Six men  
were in the room &mdash; six coatless men, with yielding, struggling limbs,  
filling the room and knocking against the furniture.  The coffin  
veered, and was gently lowered on to the chairs.  The sweat fen  
from Morel's face on its boards.  
</p><p>"My word, he's a weight!" said a man, and the five miners  
sighed, bowed, and, trembling with the struggle, descended the  
steps again, closing the door behind them.  
</p><p>The family was alone in the parlour with the great polished  
box.  William, when laid out, was six feet four inches long.  Like  
a monument lay the bright brown, ponderous coffin.  Paul thought  
it would never be got out of the room again.  His mother was  
stroking the polished wood.  
</p><p>They buried him on the Monday in the little cemetery on the  
hillside that looks over the fields at the big church and the houses.   
It was sunny, and the white chrysanthemums frilled themselves  
in the warmth.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel could not be persuaded, after this, to talk and take  
her old bright interest in life.  She remained shut off.  All the way  
home in the train she had said to herself : "If only it could have  
been me! "  
</p><p>When Paul came home at night he found his mother sitting,  
her day's work done, with hands folded in her lap upon her coarse  
apron.  She always used to have changed her dress and put on a  
black apron, before.  Now Annie set his supper, and his mother  
  
  
<pb n="146"/>   
  
sat looking blankly in front of her, her mouth shut tight.  Then he  
beat his brains for news to tell her.  
</p><p>"Mother, Miss Jordan was down to-day, and she said my sketch  
of a colliery at work was beautiful."  
</p><p>But Mrs. Morel took no notice.  Night after night he forced  
himself to tell her things, although she did not listen.  It drove him  
almost insane to have her thus.  At last:  
</p><p>"What's a-matter, mother?" he asked.  
</p><p>She did not hear.  
</p><p>"What's a-matter?" he persisted.  "Mother, what's a-matter?"  
</p><p>"You know what's the matter," she said irritably, turning away.  
</p><p>The lad &mdash; he was sixteen years old &mdash; went to bed drearily.  He  
was cut off and wretched through October, November and December.    
His mother tried, but she could not rouse herself.  She could  
only brood on her dead son; he had been let to die so cruelly.  
</p><p>At last, on December 23, with his five shillings Christmas-box  
in his pocket, Paul wandered blindly home.  His mother looked at  
him, and her heart stood still.  
</p><p>"What's the matter?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I'm badly, mother!" he replied.  "Mr.  Jordan gave me five   
shillings for a Christmas-box!"  
</p><p>He handed it to her with trembling hands.  She put it on the  
table.  
</p><p>"You aren't glad!" he reproached her; but he trembled violently.  
</p><p>"Where hurts you?" she said, unbuttoning his overcoat.  
</p><p>It was the old question.  
</p><p>"I feel badly, mother."  
</p><p>She undressed him and put him to bed.  He had  
pneumonia dangerously, the doctor said.  
</p><p>"Might he never have had it if I'd kept him at home, not let  
him go to Nottingham?" was one of the first things she asked.  
</p><p>"He might not have been so bad," said the doctor.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel stood condemned on ber own ground.  
</p><p>"I should have watched the living, not the dead," she told herself.  
</p><p>Paul was very ill.  His mother lay in bed at nights with him; they  
could not afford a nurse.  He grew worse, and the crisis approached.   
One night he tossed into consciousness in the ghastly, sickly feeling  
  
  
<pb n="147"/>   
  
of dissolution, when all the cells in the body seem in intense  
irritability to be breaking down, and consciousness makes a last  
flare of struggle, like madness.  
</p><p>"I s'll die, mother!" be cried, heaving for breath on the pillow.   
</p><p>She lifted him up, crying in a small voice:  
</p><p>"Oh, my son &mdash; my son!"  
</p><p>That brought him to.  He realised her.  His whole will rose up  
and arrested him.  He put his head on her breast, and took ease of  
her for love.  
</p><p>"For some things," said his aunt, "it was a good thing Paul was  
ill that Christmas.  I believe it saved his mother."  
</p><p>Paul was in bed for seven weeks.  He got up white and fragile.   
His father had bought him a pot of scarlet and gold tulips.  They  
used to flame in the window in the March sunshine as he sat on  
the sofa chattering to his mother.  The two knitted together in  
perfect intimacy.  Mrs. Morel's life now rooted itself in Paul.  
</p><p>William had been a prophet.  Mrs. Morel had a little present  
and a letter from Lily at Christmas.  Mrs. Morel's sister had a  
letter at the New Year.  
</p><p>"I was at a ball last night.  Some delightful people were there,  
and I enjoyed myself thoroughly," said the letter.  "I had every  
dance &mdash; did not sit out one."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel never heard any more of her.  
</p><p>Morel and his wife were gentle with each other for some time  
after the death of their son.  He would go into a kind of daze,   
staring wide-eyed and blank across the room.  Then he got up suddenly   
and hurried out to the Three Spots, returning in his normal  
state.  But never in his life would he go for a walk up Shepstone,  
past the office where his son had worked, and he always avoided  
the cemetery.</p>

<pb n="151"/>   
  
<p>PAUL had been many times up to Willey Farm during the autumn.   
He was friends with the two youngest boys.  Edgar the eldest,  
would not condescend at first.  And Miriam also refused to be  
approached.  She was afraid of being set at nought, as by her own  
brothers.  The girl was romantic in her soul.  Everywhere was a  
Walter Scott heroine being loved by men with helmets or with  
plumes in their caps.  She herself was something of a princess  
turned into a swine-girl in her own imagination.  And she was  
afraid lest this boy, who, nevertheless, looked something like a  
Walter Scott hero, who could paint and speak French, and knew  
what algebra meant, and who went by train to Nottingham every  
day, might consider her simply as the swine-girl, unable to   
perceive the princess beneath; so she held aloof.  
</p><p>Her great companion was ber mother.  They were both brown-eyed, and inclined to be mystical, such women as treasure religion  
inside them, breathe it in their nostrils, and see the whole of life  
in a mist thereof.  So to Miriam, Christ and God made one great  
figure, which she loved tremblingly and passionately when a   
tremendous sunset burned out the western sky, and Ediths, and  
Lucys, and Rowenas, Brian de Bois Guilberts, Rob Roys, and  
Guy Mannerings, rustled the sunny leaves in the morning, or sat  
in her bedroom aloft, alone, when it snowed.  That was life to her.   
For the rest, she drudged in the house, which work she would  
not have minded had not her clean red floor been mucked up   
immediately by the trampling farm-boots of her brothers.  She madly  
wanted her little brother of four to let her swathe him and stifle  
him in her love; she went to church reverently, with bowed head,  
and quivered in anguish from the vulgarity of the other choir-girls and from the common-sounding voice of the curate; she  
  
  
<pb n="152"/>   
  
fought with her brothers, whom she considered brutal louts; and  
she held not her father in too high esteem because he did not carry  
any mystical ideals cherished in his heart, but only wanted to have  
as easy a time as he could, and his meals when he was ready for  
them.  
</p><p>She hated her position as swine-girl.  She wanted to be considered.    
She wanted to learn, thinking that if she could read, as  
Paul said he could read, "Colomba", or the "Voyage autour de  
ma Chambre", the world would have a different face for her and  
a deepened respect.  She could not be princess by wealth or standing.    
So she was mad to have learning whereon to pride herself.   
For she was different from other folk, and must not be scooped  
up among the common fry.  Learning was the only distinction to  
which she thought to aspire.  
</p><p>Her beauty &mdash; that of a shy, wild, quiveringly sensitive thing &mdash;  
seemed nothing to her.  Even her soul, so strong for rhapsody,  
was not enough.  She must have something to reinforce her pride,  
because she felt different from other people.  Paul she eyed rather  
wistfully.  On the whole, she scorned the male sex.  But here was a  
new specimen, quick, light, graceful, who could be gentle and  
who could be sad, and who was clever, and who knew a lot, and  
who had a death in the family.  The boy's poor morsel of learning  
exalted him almost sky-high in her esteem.  Yet she tried hard to  
scorn him, because he would not see in her the princess but only  
the swine-girl.  And he scarcely observed her.  
</p><p>Then he was so ill, and she felt he would be weak.  Then she  
would be stronger than he.  Then she could love him.  If she could  
be mistress of him in his weakness, take care of him, if he could  
depend on her, if she could, as it were, have him in her arms, how  
she would love him!  
</p><p>As soon as the skies brightened and plum-blossom was out,  
Paul drove off in the milkman's heavy float up to Willey Farm.   
Mr. Leivers shouted in a kindly fashion at the boy, then clicked  
to the horse as they climbed the hill slowly, in the freshness of  
the morning.  White clouds went on their way, crowding to the  
back of the hills that were rousing in the spring-time.  The water  
of Nethermere lay below, very blue against the seared meadows  
and the thorn-trees.  
</p><p>It was four and a half miles' drive.  Tiny buds on the hedges,  
  
  
<pb n="153"/>   
  
vivid as copper-green, were opening into rosettes; and thrushes  
called, and blackbirds shrieked and scolded.  It was a new,   
glamorous world.  
</p><p>Miriam, peeping through the kitchen window, saw the horse  
walk through the big white gate into the farmyard that was backed  
by the oak-wood, still bare.  Then a youth in a heavy overcoat  
climbed down.  He put up his hands for the whip and the rug that  
the good-looking, ruddy farmer handed down to him.  
</p><p>Miriam appeared in the doorway.  She was nearly sixteen, very  
beautiful, with her warm colouring, her gravity, her eyes dilating  
suddenly like an ecstasy.  
</p><p>"I say," said Paul, turning shyly aside, "your daffodils are nearly  
out.  Isn't it early? But don't they look cold?"  
</p><p>"Cold!" said Miriam, in ber musical, caressing voice.  
</p><p>"The green on their buds &mdash; " and he faltered into silence  
timidly.  
</p><p>"Let me take the rug," said Miriam over-gently.  
</p><p>"I can carry it," he answered, rather injured.  But he yielded it  
to her.  
</p><p>Then Mrs. Leivers appeared.  
</p><p>"I'm sure you're tired and cold," she said.  "Let me take your  
coat.  It is heavy.  You mustn't walk far in it."  
</p><p>She helped him off with his coat.  He was quite unused to such  
attention.  She was almost smothered under its weight.  
</p><p>"Why, mother," laughed the farmer as he passed through the  
kitchen, swinging the great milk-chums, "you've got almost more  
than you can manage there."  
</p><p>She beat up the sofa cushions for the youth.  
</p><p>The kitchen was very small and irregular.  The farm had been  
originally a labourer's cottage.  And the furniture was old and   
battered.  But Paul loved it &mdash; loved the sack-bag that formed the  
hearthrug, and the funny little comer under the stairs, and the  
small window deep in the corner, through which, bending a little,  
be could see the plum trees in the back garden and the lovely round  
hills beyond.  
</p><p>"Won't you lie down?" said Mrs. Leivers.  
</p><p>"Oh no; I'm not tired," he said.  "Isn't it lovely coming out, don't  
you think? I saw a sloe-bush in blossom and a lot of celandines.   
I'm glad it's sunny."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="154"/>   
  
<p>"Can I give you anything to eat or to drink?"  
</p><p>"No, thank you."  
</p><p>"How's your mother?"  
</p><p>"I think she's tired now.  I think she's had too much to do.    
Perhaps in a little while she'll go to Skegness with me.  Then she'll be  
able to rest.  I s'll be glad if she can."  
</p><p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Leivers.  "It's a wonder she isn't ill herself."  
</p><p>Miriam was moving about preparing dinner.  Paul watched   
everything that happened.  His face was pale and thin, but his eyes were  
quick and bright with fife as ever.  He watched the strange, almost  
rhapsodic way in which the girl moved about, carrying a great  
stew-jar to the oven, or looking in the saucepan.  The atmosphere was  
different from that of his own home, where everything seemed  
so ordinary.  When Mr. Leivers called loudly outside to the horse,  
that was reaching over to feed on the rose-bushes in the garden,  
the girl started, looked round with dark eyes, as if something had  
come breaking in on her world.  There was a sense of silence inside  
the house and out.  Miriam seemed as in some dreamy tale, a  
maiden in bondage, her spirit dreaming in a land far away and  
magical.  And her discoloured, old blue frock and her broken boots  
seemed only like the romantic rags of King Cophetua's beggar-maid.  
</p><p>She suddenly became aware of his keen blue eyes upon ber,  
taking her all in.  Instantly ber broken boots and her frayed old  
frock hurt her.  She resented his seeing everything.  Even he knew  
that her stocking was not pulled up.  She went into the scullery,  
blushing deeply.  And afterwards her hands trembled slightly at her  
work.  She nearly dropped all she handled.  When her inside dream  
was shaken, her body quivered with trepidation.  She resented that  
he saw so much.  
</p><p>Mrs. Leivers sat for some time talking to the boy, although she  
was needed at her work.  She was too polite to leave him.  Presently  
she excused herself and rose.  After a while she looked into the tin  
saucepan.  
</p><p>"Oh dear, Miriam," she cried, "these potatoes have boiled dry!"  
</p><p>Miriam started as if she had been stung.  
</p><p>"Have they, mother?" she cried.  
</p><p>"I shouldn't care, Miriam," said the mother, "if I hadn't trusted  
them to you." She peered into the pan.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="155"/>   
<p>The girl stiffened as if from a blow.  Her dark eyes dilated; she  
remained standing in the same spot.  
</p><p>"Well," she answered, gripped tight in self-conscious shame,  
"I'm sure I looked at them five minutes since."  
</p><p>"Yes," said the mother, "I know it's easily done."  
</p><p>"They're not much burned," said Paul.  "It doesn't matter, does  
it?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Leivers looked at the youth with her brown, hurt eyes.  
</p><p>"It wouldn't matter but for the boys," she said to him.  "Only  
Miriam knows what a trouble they make if the potatoes are  
'caught'."  
</p><p>"Then," thought Paul to himself, "you shouldn't let them make  
a trouble."  
</p><p>After a while Edgar came in.  He wore leggings, and his boots  
were covered with earth.  He was rather small, rather formal,  
for  
a farmer.  He glanced at Paul, nodded to him distantly, and  
said:  
</p><p>"Dinner ready?"  
</p><p>"Nearly, Edgar," replied the mother apologetically.  
</p><p>"I'm ready for mine," said the young man, taking up the   
newspaper and reading.  Presently the rest of the family trooped in.   
Dinner was served.  The meal went rather brutally.  The over-gentleness and apologetic tone of the mother brought out all the  
brutality of manners in the sons.  Edgar tasted the potatoes, moved  
his mouth quickly like a rabbit, looked indigantly at his mother,  
and said:  
</p><p>"These potatoes are burnt, mother."  
</p><p>"Yes, Edgar.  I forgot them for a minute.  Perhaps you'll have  
bread if you can't eat them."  
</p><p>Edgar looked in anger across at Miriam.  
</p><p>"What was Miriam doing that she couldn't attend to them?"  
he said.  
</p><p>Miriam looked up.  Her mouth opened, her dark eyes blazed and  
winced, but she said nothing.  She swallowed her anger and her  
shame, bowing her dark head.  
</p><p>"I'm sure she was trying hard," said the mother.  
</p><p>"She hasn't got sense even to boil the potatoes," said Edgar.   
"What is she kept at home for?"  
</p><p>"On'y for eating everything that's left in th' pantry," said  
Maurice.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="156"/>   
  
<p>"They don't forget that potato-pie against our Miriam," laughed  
the father.  
</p><p>She was utterly humiliated.  The mother sat in silence, suffering,  
like some saint out of place at the brutal board.  
</p><p>It puzzled Paul.  He wondered vaguely why all this intense   
feeling went running because of a few burnt potatoes.  The mother  
exalted everything &mdash; even a bit of housework &mdash; to the plane of a   
religious trust.  The sons resented this; they felt themselves cut away  
underneath, and they answered with brutality and also with a sneer-ing superciliousness.  
</p><p>Paul was just opening out from childhood into manhood.  This  
atmosphere, where everything took a religious value, came with a  
subtle fascination to him.  There was something in the air.  His own  
mother was logical.  Here there was something different, something  
he loved, something that at times he hated.  
</p><p>Miriam quarrelled with her brothers fiercely.  Later in the   
afternoon, when they had gone away again, her mother said:  
</p><p>"You disappointed me at dinner-time, Miriam."  
</p><p>The girl dropped her head.  
</p><p>"They are such brutes!" she suddenly cried, looking up with  
flashing eyes.  
</p><p>"But hadn't you promised not to answer them?" said the mother.   
"And I believed in you.  I can't stand it when you wrangle."  
</p><p>"But they're so hateful!" cried Miriam, "and &mdash; and low."  
</p><p>"Yes, dear.  But how often have I asked you not to answer   
Edgar back? Can't you let him say what he likes?"  
</p><p>"But why should he say what he likes?"  
</p><p>"Aren't you strong enough to bear it, Miriam, if even for my  
sake? Are you so weak that you must wrangle with them?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Leivers stuck unflinchingly to this doctrine of "the other  
cheek".  She could not instil it at all into the boys.  With the girls  
she succeeded better, and Miriam was the child of her heart.  The  
boys loathed the other cheek when it was presented to them.  Miriam  
was often sufficiently lofty to tum it.  Then they spat on her and  
hated her.  But she walked in her proud humility, living within  
herself.  
</p><p>There was always this feeling of jangle and discord in the Leivers  
family.  Although the boys resented so bitterly this eternal appeal  
to their deeper feelings of resignation and proud humility, yet it  
  
  
<pb n="157"/>   
  
had its effect on them.  They could not establish between themselves  
and an outsider just the ordinary human feeling and unexaggerated  
friendship; they were always restless for the something deeper.   
Ordinary folk seemed shallow to them, trivial and inconsiderable.   
And so they were unaccustomed, painfully uncouth in the simplest  
social intercourse, suffering, and yet insolent in their superiority.   
Then beneath was the yearning for the soul-intimacy to which  
they could not attain because they were too dumb, and every approach   
to close connection was blocked by their clumsy contempt  
of other people.  They wanted genuine intimacy, but they could  
not get even normally near to anyone, because they scorned to  
take the first steps, they scorned the triviality which forms common  
human intercourse.  
</p><p>Paul fell under Mrs. Leivers's spell.  Everything had a religious  
and intensified meaning when he was with her.  His soul, hurt, highly  
developed, sought her as if for nourishment.  Together they seemed  
to sift the vital fact from an experience.  
</p><p>Miriam was her mother's daughter.  In the sunshine of the   
afternoon mother and daughter went down the fields with him.  They  
looked for nests.  There was a jenny wren's in the hedge by the  
orchard.  
</p><p>"I do want you to see this," said Mrs. Leivers.  
</p><p>He crouched down and carefully put his finger through the  
thorns into the round door of the nest.  
</p><p>"It's almost as if you were feeling inside the live body of the  
bird," he said, "it's so warm.  They say a bird makes its nest round  
like a cup with pressing its breast on it.  Then how did it make the  
ceiling round, I wonder?"  
</p><p>The nest seemed to start into life for the two women.  After that,  
Miriam came to see it every day.  It seemed so close to her.  Again,  
going down the hedgeside with the girl, he noticed the celandines,  
scalloped splashes of gold, on the side of the ditch.  
</p><p>"I like them," he said, "when their petals go flat back with the  
sunshine.  They seemed to be pressing themselves at the sun."  
</p><p>And then the celandines ever after drew her with a little spell.   
Anthropomorphic as she was, she stimulated him into appreciating  
things thus, and then they lived for her.  She seemed to need things  
kindling in her imagination or in her soul before she felt she had  
them.  And she was cut off from ordinary life by her religious intensity  
  
  
<pb n="158"/>   
  
which made the world for her either a nunnery garden or  
a paradise, where sin and knowledge were not, or else an ugly,  
cruel thing.  
</p><p>So it was in this atmosphere of subtle intimacy, this meeting in  
their common feeling for something in Nature, that their love  
started.  
</p><p>Personally, he was a long time before he realized her.  For ten  
months he had to stay at home after his illness.  For a while he went  
to Skegness with his mother, and was perfectly happy.  But  
even from the seaside he wrote long letters to Mrs. Leivers about  
the shore and the sea.  And he brought back his beloved sketches  
of the flat Lincoln coast, anxious for them to see.  Almost they  
would interest the Leivers more than they interested his mother.  It  
was not his art Mrs. Morel cared about; it was himself and his  
achievement.  But Mrs. Leivers and her children were almost bis  
disciples.  They kindled him and made him glow to his work,  
whereas his mother's influence was to make him quietly determined,   
patient, dogged, unwearied.  
</p><p>He soon was friends with the boys, whose rudeness was only  
superficial.  They had all, when they could trust themselves, a  
strange gentleness and lovableness.  
</p><p>"Will you come with me on to the fallow?" asked Edgar, rather  
hesitatingly.  
</p><p>Paul went joyfully, and spent the afternoon helping to hoe  
or to single turnips with his friend.  He used to lie with the three  
brothers in the hay piled up in the barn and tell them about Nottingham   
and about Jordan's.  In return, they taught him to milk,  
and let him do little jobs &mdash; chopping hay or pulping turnips &mdash; just  
as much as be liked.  At midsummer he worked all through hay-harvest with them, and then he loved them.  The family was so cut  
off from the world actually.  They seemed, somehow, like "les  
derniers fils d'une race epuisee".  Though the lads were strong and  
healthy, yet they had all that over-sensitiveness and hanging-back  
which made them so lonely, yet also such close, delicate friends  
once their intimacy was won.  Paul loved them dearly, and they  
him.  
</p><p>Miriam came later.  But he had come into her life before she  
made any mark on his.  One dull afternoon, when the men were  
on the land and the rest at school, only Miriam and her mother  
  
  
<pb n="159"/>   
at home, the girl said to him, after having hesitated for some  time:  
</p><p>"Have you seen the swing?"  
</p><p>"No," he answered.  "Where?"  
</p><p>"In the cowshed," she replied.  
</p><p>She always hesitated to offer or to show him anything.  Men  
have such different standards of worth from women, and her dear  
things &mdash; the valuable things to her &mdash; her brothers had so often  
mocked or flouted.  
</p><p>"Come on, then," he replied, jumping up.  
</p><p>There were two cowsheds, one on either side of the barn.  In  
the lower, darker shed there was standing for four cows.  Hens  
flew scolding over the manger-wall as the youth and girl went forward   
for the great thick rope which hung from the beam in the  
darkness overhead, and was pushed back over a peg in the wall.  
</p><p>"It's something like a rope!" he exclaimed appreciatively; and  
he sat down on it, anxious to try it.  Then immediately he rose.  
</p><p>"Come on, then, and have first go," he said to the girl.  
</p><p>"See," she answered, going into the barn, "we put some bags on  
the seat"; and she made the swing comfortable for him.  That gave  
her pleasure.  He held the rope.  
</p><p>"Come on, then," he said to her.  
</p><p>"No, I won't go first," she answered.  
</p><p>She stood aside in her still, aloof fashion.  
</p><p>"Why?"  
</p><p>"You go," she pleaded.  
</p><p>Almost for the first time in her life she had the pleasure of   
giving up to a man, of spoiling him.  Paul looked at her.  
</p><p>"All right," he said, sitting down.  "Mind out!"  
</p><p>He set off with a spring, and in a moment was flying through the   
air, almost out of the door of the shed, the upper half of which  
was open, showing outside the drizzling rain, the filthy yard, the  
cattle standing disconsolate against the black cartshed, and at the  
back of all the grey-green wall of the wood.  She stood below in  
her crimson tam-o'-shanter and watched.  He looked down at her,  
and she saw his blue eyes sparkling.  
</p><p>"It's a treat of a swing," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>He was swinging through the air, every bit of him swinging, like  
a bird that swoops for joy of movement.  And he looked down at  
  
  
<pb n="160"/>   
  
her.  Her crimson cap hung over her dark curls, her beautiful warm  
face, so still in a kind of brooding, was lifted towards him.  It was  
dark and rather cold in the shed.  Suddenly a swallow came down  
from the high roof and darted out of the door.  
</p><p>"I didn't know a bird was watching," he called.  
</p><p>He swung negligently.  She could feel him falling and lifting  
through the air, as if he were lying on some force.  
</p><p>"Now I'll die," he said, in a detached, dreamy voice, as though  
he were the dying motion of the swing.  She watched him, fascinated.    
Suddenly he put on the brake and jumped out.  
</p><p>"I've had a long turn," he said.  "But it's a treat of a swing &mdash;   
it's a real treat of a swing!"  
</p><p>Miriam was amused that he took a swing so seriously and felt  
so warmly over it.  
</p><p>"No; you go on," she said.  
</p><p>"Why, don't you want one?" he asked, astonished.  
</p><p>"Well, not much.  I'll have just a little."  
</p><p>She sat down, whilst he kept the bags in place for her.  
</p><p>"It's so ripping!" he said, setting ber in motion.  "Keep your heels  
up, or they'll bang the manger wan."  
</p><p>She felt the accuracy with which he caught her, exactly at the  
right moment, and the exactly proportionate strength of his thrust,  
and she was afraid.  Down to her bowels went the hot wave of fear.   
She was in his hands.  Again, firm and inevitable came the thrust at  
the right moment.  She gripped the rope, almost swooning.  
</p><p>"Ha!" she laughed in fear.  "No higher!"  
</p><p>"But you're not a bit high," he remonstrated.  
</p><p>"But no higher."  
</p><p>He heard the fear in her voice, and desisted.  Her heart melted  
in hot pain when the moment came for him to thrust her forward  
again.  But he left her alone.  She began to breathe.  
</p><p>"Won't you really go any farther?" he asked.  "Should I keep  
you there?"  
</p><p>"No; let me go by myself," she answered.  
</p><p>He moved aside and watched her.  
</p><p>"Why, you're scarcely moving," he said.  
</p><p>She laughed slightly with shame, and in a moment got down.  
</p><p>"They say if you can swing you won't be sea-sick," he said, as  
he mounted again.  "I don't believe I should ever be sea-sick."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="161"/>   
<p>Away he went.  There was something fascinating to her in him.   
For the moment he was nothing but a piece of swinging stuff; not  
a particle of him that did not swing.  She could never lose herself  
so, nor could her brothers.  It roused a warmth in her.  It was almost   
as if he were a flame that had lit a warmth in her whilst he  
swung in the middle air.  
</p><p>And gradually the intimacy with the family concentrated for  
Paul on three persons &mdash; the mother, Edgar, and Miriam.  To the  
mother he went for that sympathy and that appeal which seemed  
to draw him out.  Edgar was his very close friend.  And to Miriam  
he more or less condescended, because she seemed so humble.  
</p><p>But the girl gradually sought him out.  If he brought up his  
sketch-book, it was she who pondered longest over the last picture.    
Then she would look up at him.  Suddenly, her dark eyes  
alight like water that shakes with a stream of gold in the dark, she  
would ask:  
</p><p>"Why do I like this so?"  
</p><p>Always something in his breast shrank from these close, intimate,  
dazzled looks of hers.  
</p><p>"Why do you?" he asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know.  It seems so true."  
</p><p>"It's because &mdash; it's because there is scarcely any shadow in it;  
it's more shimmery, as if I'd painted the shimmering protoplasm  
in the leaves and everywhere, and not the stiffness of the shape.   
That seems dead to me.  Only this shimmeriness is the real living.   
The shape is a dead crust.  The shimmer is inside really."  
</p><p>And she, with her little finger in her mouth, would ponder these  
sayings.  They gave her a feeling of life again, and vivified things  
which had meant nothing to her.  She managed to find some meaning in   
his struggling, abstract speeches.  And they were the medium  
through which she came distinctly at her beloved objects.  
</p><p>Another day she sat at sunset whilst he was painting some pine-trees which caught the red glare from the west.  He had been quiet.  
</p><p>"There you are!" he said suddenly.  "I wanted that.  Now, look  
at them and tell me, are they pine trunks or are they red coals,  
standing-up pieces of fire in that darkness? There's God's burning  
bush for you, that burned not away."  
</p><p>Miriam looked, and was frightened.  But the pine trunks were  
  
  
<pb n="162"/>   
  
wonderful to her, and distinct.  He packed his box and rose.    
Suddenly he looked at her.  
</p><p>"Why are you always sad?" he asked her.  
</p><p>"Sad!" she exclaimed, looking up at him with startled,   
wonderful brown eyes.  
</p><p>"Yes," he replied.  "You are always sad."  
</p><p>"I am not &mdash; oh, not a bit!" she cried.  
</p><p>"But even your joy is like a flame coming off of sadness," he  
persisted.  "You're never jolly, or even just all right."  
</p><p>"No," she pondered.  "I wonder &mdash; why?"  
</p><p>"Because you're not; because you're different inside, like a pine-tree, and then you flare up; but you're not just like an ordinary  
tree, with fidgety leaves and jolly &mdash; "  
</p><p>He got tangled up in his own speech; but she brooded on it,  
and he had a strange, roused sensation, as if his feelings were new.   
She got so near him.  It was a strange stimulant.  
</p><p>Then sometimes he hated her.  Her youngest brother was only  
five.  He was a frail lad, with immense brown eyes in his quaint  
fragile face &mdash; one of Reynolds's "Choir of Angels", with a touch of  
elf.  Often Miriam kneeled to the child and drew him to her.  
</p><p>"Eh, my Hubert!" she sang, in a voice heavy and surcharged  
with love.  "Eh, my Hubert!"  
</p><p>And, folding him in her arms, she swayed slightly from side to  
side with love, her face half lifted, her eyes half closed, her voice  
drenched with love.  
</p><p>"Don't!" said the child, uneasy &mdash; "don't, Miriam!"  
</p><p>"Yes; you love me, don't you?" she murmured deep in her  
throat, almost as if she were in a trance, and swaying also as if  
she were swooned in an ecstasy of love.  
</p><p>"Don't!" repeated the child, a frown on his clear brow.  
</p><p>"You love me, don't you?" she murmured.  
</p><p>"What do you make such a fuss for?" cried Paul, all in suffering  
because of her extreme emotion.  "Why can't you be ordinary with him?"  
</p><p>She let the child go, and rose, and said nothing.  Her intensity,  
which would leave no emotion on a normal plane, irritated the  
youth into a frenzy.  And this fearful, naked contact of her on small  
occasions shocked him.  He was used to his mother's reserve.  And  
  
  
<pb n="163"/>   
  
on such occasions he was thankful in his heart and soul that he  
had his mother, so sane and wholesome.  
</p><p>All the life of Miriam's body was in her eyes, which were usually  
dark as a dark church, but could flame with light like a conflagration.    
Her face scarcely ever altered from its look of brooding.  She  
might have been one of the women who went with Mary when  
Jesus was dead.  Her body was not flexible and living.  She walked  
with a swing, rather heavily, her head bowed forward, pondering.   
She was not clumsy, and yet none of her movements seemed quite  
the movement.  Often, when wiping the dishes, she would stand in  
bewilderment and chagrin because she had pulled in two halves a  
cup or a tumbler.  It was as if, in her fear and self-mistrust, she  
put too much strength into the effort.  There was no looseness or  
abandon about her.  Everything was gripped stiff with intensity,  
and her effort, overcharged, closed in on itself.  
</p><p>She rarely varied from her swinging, forward, intense walk.    
Occasionally she ran with Paul down the fields.  Then her eyes blazed  
naked in a kind of ecstasy that frightened him.  But she was physically   
afraid.  If she were getting over a stile, she gripped his hands  
in a little hard anguish, and began to lose her presence of mind.   
And he could not persuade her to jump from even a small height.   
Her eyes dilated, became exposed and palpitating.  
</p><p>"No!" she cried, half laughing in terror &mdash; "no!"  
</p><p>"You shall!" he cried once, and, jerking her forward, he brought  
her falling from the fence.  But her wild "Ah!" of pain, as if she  
were losing consciousness, cut him.  She landed on her feet safely,  
and afterwards had courage in this respect.  
</p><p>She was very much dissatisfied with her lot.  
</p><p>"Don't you like being at home?" Paul asked her, surprised.  
</p><p>"Who would?" she answered, low and intense.  "What is it? I'm  
all day cleaning what the boys make just as bad in five minutes.   
I don't want to be at home."  
</p><p>"What do you want, then?"  
</p><p>"I want to do something.  I want a chance like anybody else.   
Why should 1, because I'm a girl, be kept at home and not allowed  
to be anything? What chance have I?"  
</p><p>"Chance of what?"  
</p><p>"Of knowing anything &mdash; of learning, of doing anything.  It's not  
fair, because I'm a woman."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="164"/>   
  
<p>She seemed very bitter.  Paul wondered.  In his own home Annie  
was almost glad to be a girl.  She had not so much responsibility;  
things were lighter for her.  She never wanted to be other than a  
girl.  But Miriam almost fiercely wished she were a man.  And yet  
she hated men at the same time.  
</p><p>"But it's as well to be a woman as a man," he said, frowning.  
</p><p>"Ha! Is it? Men have everything."  
</p><p>"I should think women ought to be as glad to be women as men  
are to be men," he answered.  
</p><p>"No!" &mdash; she shook her head &mdash; "no!  Everything the men have."  
</p><p>"But what do you want?" he asked.  
</p><p>"I want to learn.  Why should it be that I know nothing?"  
</p><p>"What! such as mathematics and French?"  
</p><p>"Why shouldn't I know mathematics? Yes!" she cried, her eye  
expanding in a kind of defiance.  
</p><p>"Well, you can learn as much as I know," he said.  "I'll teach  
you, if you like."  
</p><p>Her eyes dilated.  She mistrusted him as teacher.  
</p><p>"Would you?" he asked.  
</p><p>Her head had dropped, and she was sucking her finger broodingly.  
</p><p>"Yes," she said hesitatingly.  
</p><p>He used to tell his mother all these things.  
</p><p>"I'm going to teach Miriam algebra," he said.  
</p><p>"Well," replied Mrs. Morel, "I hope she'll get fat on it."  
</p><p>When he went up to the farm on the Monday evening, it was  
drawing twilight.  Miriam was just sweeping up the kitchen, and  
was kneeling at the hearth when he entered.  Everyone was out but  
her.  She looked round at him, flushed, her dark eyes shining, her  
fine hair falling about her face.  
</p><p>"Hello!" she said, soft and musical.  "I knew it was you."  
</p><p>"How?"  
</p><p>"I knew your step.  Nobody treads so quick and firm."  
</p><p>He sat down, sighing.  
</p><p>"Ready to do some algebra?" he asked, drawing a little book  
from his pocket.  
</p><p>"But &mdash; "  
</p><p>He could feel her backing away.  
</p><p>"You said you wanted," he insisted.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="165"/>   
<p>"To-night, though?" she faltered.  
  
</p><p>"But I came on purpose.  And if you want to learn it, you must  
begin."  
</p><p>She took up her ashes in the dustpan and looked at him, half  
tremulously, laughing.  
</p><p>"Yes, but to-night! You see, I haven't thought of it."  
</p><p>"Well, my goodness! Take the ashes and come."  
</p><p>He went and sat on the stone bench in the back-yard, where  
the big milk-cans were standing, tipped up, to air.  The men were  
in the cowsheds.  He could hear the little sing-song of the milk   
spurting into the pails.  Presently she came, bringing some big greenish  
apples.  
</p><p>"You know you like them," she said.  
</p><p>He took a bite.  
</p><p>"Sit down," he said, with his mouth full.  
</p><p>She was short-sighted, and peered over his shoulder.  It irritated  
him.  He gave her the book quickly.  
</p><p>"Here," he said.  "It's only letters for figures.  You put down  
'a' instead of '2' or '6'."  
</p><p>They worked, he talking, she with her head down on the book.   
He was quick and hasty.  She never answered.  Occasionally, when  
he demanded of her, "Do you see?" she looked up at him, her eyes  
wide with the half-laugh that comes of fear.  "Don't you?" he cried.  
</p><p>He had been too fast.  But she said nothing.  He questioned her  
more, then got hot.  It made his blood rouse to see her there, as it  
were, at his mercy, her mouth open, her eyes dilated with laughter  
that was afraid, apologetic, ashamed.  Then Edgar came along with  
two buckets of milk.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he said.  "What are you doing?"  
</p><p>"Algebra," replied Paul.  
</p><p>"Algebra!" repeated Edgar curiously.  Then he passed on with  
a laugh.  Paul took a bite at his forgotten apple, looked at the   
miserable cabbages in the garden, pecked into lace by the fowls, and  
be wanted to pull them up.  Then he glanced at Miriam.  She was  
poring over the book, seemed absorbed in it, yet trembling lest she  
could not get at it.  It made him cross.  She was ruddy and beautiful.    
Yet her soul seemed to be intensely supplicating.  The algebra-book she closed, shrinking, knowing he was angered; and at the  
  
  
<pb n="166"/>   
  
same instant he grew gentle, seeing her hurt because she did not  
understand.  
</p><p>But things came slowly to her.  And when she held herself in a  
grip, seemed so utterly humble before the lesson, it made his blood  
rouse.  He stormed at her, got ashamed, continued the lesson, and  
grew furious again, abusing her.  She listened in silence.    
Occasionally, very rarely, she defended herself.  Her liquid dark eyes  
blazed at him.  
</p><p>"You don't give me time to learn it," she said.  
</p><p>"All right," he answered, throwing the book on the table and  
lighting a cigarette.  Then, after a while, he went back to her   
repentant.  So the lessons went.  He was always either in a rage or  
very gentle.  
</p><p>"What do you tremble your soul before it for?" he cried.  "You  
don't learn algebra with your blessed soul.  Can't you look at it with  
your clear simple wits?"  
</p><p>Often, when he went again into the kitchen, Mrs. Leivers would  
look at him reproachfully, saying:  
</p><p>"Paul, don't be so hard on Miriam.  She may not be quick, but  
I'm sure she tries."  
</p><p>"I can't help it," he said rather pitiably.  "I go off like it."  
</p><p>"You don't mind me, Miriam, do you?" he asked of the girl  
later.  
</p><p>"No," she reassured him in her beautiful deep tones &mdash; "no, I  
don't mind."  
</p><p>"Don't mind me; it's my fault."  
</p><p>But, in spite of himself, his blood began to boil with her.  It was  
strange that no one else made him in such fury.  He flared against  
her.  Once he threw the pencil in her face.  There was a silence.  She  
turned her face slightly aside.  
</p><p>"I didn't &mdash; " he began, but got no farther, feeling weak in all  
his bones.  She never reproached him or was angry with him.  He  
was often cruelly ashamed.  But still again his anger burst like a  
bubble surcharged; and still, when he saw ber eager, silent, as it  
were, blind face, he felt he wanted to throw the pencil in it; and  
still, when he saw her hand trembling and her mouth parted with  
suffering, his heart was scalded with pain for her.  And because of  
the intensity to which she roused him, he sought her.  
</p><p>Then he often avoided her and went with Edgar.  Miriam and  
  
  
<pb n="167"/>   
  
her brother were naturally antagonistic.  Edgar was a rationalist,  
who was curious, and had a sort of scientific interest in life.  It was  
a great bitterness to Miriam to see herself deserted by Paul for  
Edgar, who seemed so much lower.  But the youth was very happy  
with her elder brother.  The two men spent afternoons together  
on the land or in the loft doing carpentry, when it rained.  And  
they talked together, or Paul taught Edgar the songs he himself  
had learned from Annie at the piano.  And often all the men, Mr.  
Leivers as well, had bitter debates on the nationalizing of the land  
and similar problems.  Paul had already heard his mother's views,  
and as these were as yet his own, he argued for her.  Miriam  
attended and took part, but was all the time waiting until it should  
be over and a personal communication might begin.  
</p><p>"After all," she said within herself, "if the land were nationalized,  
Edgar and Paul and I would be just the same." So she waited for  
the youth to come back to her.  
</p><p>He was studying for his painting.  He loved to sit at home, alone  
with his mother, at night, working and working.  She sewed or read.   
Then, looking up from his task, he would rest his eyes for a moment   
on her face, that was bright with living warmth, and he returned   
gladly to his work.  
</p><p>"I can do my best things when you sit there in your rocking-chair, mother," he said.  
</p><p>"I'm sure!" she exclaimed, sniffing with mock scepticism.  But  
she felt it was so, and her heart quivered with brightness.  For many  
hours she sat still, slightly conscious of him labouring away, whilst  
she worked or read her book.  And he, with all his soul's intensity  
directing his pencil, could feel her warmth inside him like strength.   
They were both very happy so, and both unconscious of it.  These  
times, that meant so much, and which were real living, they almost  
ignored.  
</p><p>He was conscious only when stimulated.  A sketch finished, he  
always wanted to take it to Miriam.  Then he was stimulated into  
knowledge of the work he had produced unconsciously.  In contact  
with Miriam he gained insight; his vision went deeper.  From his  
mother he drew the life-warmth, the strength to produce; Miriam  
urged this warmth into intensity like a white light.  
</p><p>When he returned to the factory the conditions of work were  
better.  He had Wednesday afternoon off to go to the Art School  
  
  
<pb n="168"/>   
  
&mdash; Miss Jordan's provision &mdash; returning in the evening.  Then the  
factory closed at six instead of eight on Thursday and Friday  
evenings.  
</p><p>One evening in the summer Miriam and he went over the fields  
by Herod's Farm on their way from the library home.  So it was  
only three miles to Willey Farm.  There was a yellow glow over  
the mowing-grass, and the sorrel-heads bumed crimson.  Gradually,  
as they walked along the high land, the gold in the west sank down  
to red, the red to crimson, and then the chill blue crept up against  
the glow.  
</p><p>They came out upon the high road to Alfreton, which ran  
white between the darkening fields.  There Paul hesitated.  It was  
two miles home for him, one mile forward for Miriam.  They both  
looked up the road that ran in shadow right under the glow of  
the north-west sky.  On the crest of the hill, Selby, with its stark houses  
and the up-pricked headstocks of the pit, stood in black silhouette  
small against the sky.  
</p><p>He looked at his watch.  
</p><p>"Nine o'clock!" he said.  
</p><p>The pair stood, loth to part, hugging their books.  
</p><p>"The wood is so lovely now," she said.  "I wanted you to see  
it."  
</p><p>He followed her slowly across the road to the white gate.  
</p><p>"They grumble so if I'm late," he said.  
</p><p>"But you're not doing anything wrong," she answered impatiently.  
</p><p>He followed her across the nibbled pasture in the dusk.  There  
was a coolness in the wood, a scent of leaves, of honeysuckle, and  
a twilight.  The two walked in silence.  Night came wonderfully  
there, among the throng of dark tree-trunks.  He looked round,  
expectant.  
</p><p>She wanted to show him a certain wild-rose bush she had   
discovered.  She knew it was wonderful.  And yet, till he had seen it,  
she felt it had not come into her soul.  Only he could make it her  
own, immortal.  She was dissatisfied.  
</p><p>Dew was already on the paths.  In the old oak-wood a mist was  
rising, and he hesitated, wondering whether one whiteness were a  
strand of fog or only campion-flowers pallid in a cloud.  
By the time they came to the pine-trees Miriam was getting very  
  
  
<pb n="169"/>   
  
eager and very tense.  Her bush might be gone.  She might not be  
able to find it; and she wanted it so much.  Almost passionately  
she wanted to be with him when be stood before the flowers.  They  
were going to have a communion together &mdash; something that thrilled  
her, something holy.  He was walking beside her in silence.  They  
were very near to each other.  She trembled, and he listened, vaguely  
anxious.  
</p><p>Coming to the edge of the wood, they saw the sky in front, like  
mother-of-pearl, and the earth growing dark.  Somewhere on the  
outermost branches of the pine-wood the honeysuckle was streaming scent.  
</p><p>"Where?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Down the middle path," she murmured, quivering.  
</p><p>When they turned the corner of the path she stood still.  In the  
wide walk between the pines, gazing rather frightened, she could  
distinguish nothing for some moments; the greying light robbed  
things of their colour.  Then she saw her bush.  
</p><p>"Ah!" she cried, hastening forward.  
</p><p>It was very still.  The tree was tall and straggling.  It had thrown  
its briers over a hawthorn-bush, and its long streamers trailed thick,  
right down to the grass, splashing the darkness everywhere with  
great spilt stars, pure white.  In bosses of ivory and in large  
splashed stars the roses gleamed on the darkness of foliage and  
stems and grass.  Paul and Miriam stood close together, silent, and  
watched.  Point after point the steady roses shone out to them,  
seeming to kindle something in their souls.  The dusk came like  
smoke around, and still did not put out the roses.  
</p><p>Paul looked into Miriam's eyes.  She was pale and expectant  
with wonder, her lips were parted, and her dark eyes lay open to  
him.  His look seemed to travel down into her.  Her soul quivered.   
It was the communion she wanted.  He turned aside, as if pained.   
He turned to the bush.  
</p><p>"They seem as if they walk like butterflies, and shake   
themselves," he said.  
</p><p>She looked at her roses.  They were white, some incurved and  
holy, others expanded in an ecstasy.  The tree was dark as a  
shadow.  She lifted her hand impulsively to the flowers; she went  
forward and touched them in worship.  
</p><p>"Let us go," he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="170"/>   
  
<p>There was a cool scent of ivory roses-a white, virgin scent.   
Something made him feel anxious and imprisoned.  The two walked  
in silence.  
</p><p>"Till Sunday," he said quietly, and left her; and she walked home  
slowly, feeling her soul satisfied with the holiness of the night.  He  
stumbled down the path.  And as soon as he was out of the wood,  
in the free open meadow, where he could breathe, he started to  
run as fast as he could.  It was like a delicious delirium in his veins.  
</p><p>Always when he went with Miriam, and it grew rather late, he  
knew his mother was fretting and getting angry about him &mdash; why,  
he could not understand.  As he went into the house, flinging down  
his cap, his mother looked up at the clock.  She had been sitting  
thinking, because a chill to her eyes prevented her reading.  She  
could feel Paul being drawn away by this girl.  And she did not  
care for Miriam.  "She is one of those who will want to suck a man's  
soul out till he has none of his own left," she said to herself; "and  
he is just such a gaby as to let himself be absorbed.  She will never  
let him become a man; she never will." So, while he was away with  
Miriam, Mrs. Morel grew more and more worked up.  
</p><p>She glanced at the clock and said, coldly and rather tired:  
</p><p>"You have been far enough to-night."  
</p><p>His soul, warm and exposed from contact with the girl, shrank.  
</p><p>"You must have been right home with her," his mother continued.  
</p><p>He would not answer.  Mrs. Morel, looking at him quickly, saw  
his hair was damp on his forehead with haste, saw him frowning  
in his heavy fashion, resentfully.  
</p><p>"She must be wonderfully fascinating, that you can't get away  
from her, but must go trailing eight miles at this time of night."  
</p><p>He was hurt between the past glamour with Miriam and the  
knowledge that his mother fretted.  He had meant not to say anything,   
to refuse to answer.  But he could not harden his heart to  
ignore his mother.  
</p><p>"I do like to talk to her," he answered irritably.  
</p><p>"Is there nobody else to talk to?"  
</p><p>"You wouldn't say anything if I went with Edgar."  
</p><p>"You know I should.  You know, whoever you went with, I  
should say it was too far for you to go trailing, late at night, when  
you've been to Nottingham.  Besides" &mdash; her voice suddenly flashed  
  
  
<pb n="171"/>   
into anger and contempt &mdash; "it is disgusting &mdash; bits of lads and girls  
courting."  
</p><p>"It is not courting," he cried.  
</p><p>"I don't know what else you can it."  
</p><p>"It's not! Do you think we spoon and do? We only talk."  
</p><p>"Till goodness knows what time and distance," was the   
sarcastic rejoinder.  
</p><p>Paul snapped at the laces of his boots angrily.  
</p><p>"What are you so mad about?" he asked.  "Because you don't  
like her."  
</p><p>"I don't say I don't like her.  But I don't hold with children   
keeping company, and never did."  
</p><p>"But you don't mind our Annie going out with Jim Inger."  
</p><p>"They've more sense than you two."  
</p><p>"Why?"  
</p><p>"Our Annie's not one of the deep sort."  
</p><p>He failed to see the meaning of this remark.  But his mother  
looked tired.  She was never so strong after William's death; and  
her eyes hurt her.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "it's so pretty in the country.  Mr. Sleath asked  
about you.  He said he'd missed you.  Are you a bit better?"  
"I ought to have been in bed a long time ago," she replied.  
</p><p>"Why, mother, you know you wouldn't have gone before  
quarter-past ten."  
</p><p>"Oh, yes, I should!"  
</p><p>"Oh, little woman, you'd say anything now you're disagreeable  
with me, wouldn't you?"  
</p><p>He kissed her forehead that he knew so well: the deep marks  
between the brows, the rising of the fine hair, greying now, and the  
proud setting of the temples.  His hand lingered on her shoulder  
after his kiss.  Then he went slowly to bed.  He had forgotten Miriam;   
he only saw how his mother's hair was lifted back from her  
warm, broad brow.  And somehow, she was hurt.  
</p><p>Then the next time he saw Miriam he said to her:  
</p><p>"Don't let me be late to-night &mdash; not later than ten o'clock.  My  
mother gets so upset."  
</p><p>Miriam dropped her bead, brooding.  
</p><p>"Why does she get upset?" she asked.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="172"/>   
  
<p>"Because she says I oughtn't to be out late when I have to get  
up early."  
</p><p>"Very well!" said Miriam, rather quietly, with just a touch of a  
sneer.  
</p><p>He resented that.  And he was usually late again.  
</p><p>That there was any love growing between him and Miriam  
neither of them would have acknowledged.  He thought he was too  
sane for such sentimentality, and she thought herself too lofty.   
They both were late in coming to maturity, and psychical ripeness  
was much behind even the physical.  Miriam was exceedingly sensitive,   
as her mother had always been.  The slightest grossness  
made her recoil almost in anguish.  Her brothers were brutal, but  
never coarse in speech.  The men did all the discussing of farm matters   
outside.  But, perhaps, because of the continual business of  
birth and of begetting which goes on upon every farm, Miriam was  
the more hypersensitive to the matter, and her blood was chastened  
almost to disgust of the faintest suggestion of such intercourse.   
Paul took his pitch from her, and their intimacy went on in an utterly   
blanched and chaste fashion.  It could never be mentioned  
that the mare was in foal.  
</p><p>When he was nineteen, he was earning only twenty shillings a  
week, but he was happy.  His painting went well, and life went well  
enough.  On the Good Friday he organised a walk to the Hemlock  
Stone.  There were three lads of his own age, then Annie and Arthur,   
Miriam and Geoffrey.  Arthur, apprenticed as an electrician  
in Nottingham, was home for the holiday.  Morel, as usual, was  
up early, whistling and sawing in the yard.  At seven o'clock the  
family heard him buy threepennyworth of hot-cross buns; he talked  
with gusto to the little girl who brought them, calling her "my  
darling".  He turned away several boys who came with more buns,  
telling them they had been "kested" by a little lass.  Then Mrs.  
Morel got up, and the family straggled down.  It was an immense  
luxury to everybody, this lying in bed just beyond the ordinary  
time on a weekday.  And Paul and Arthur read before breakfast,  
and had the meal unwashed, sitting in their shirt-sleeves.  This  
was another holiday luxury.  The room was warm.  Everything felt  
free of care and anxiety.  There was a sense of plenty in the house.  
</p><p>While the boys were reading, Mrs. Morel went into the garden.  
They were now in another house, an old one, near the Scargill  
  
  
<pb n="173"/>   
Street home, which had been left soon after William had died.   
Directly came an excited cry from the garden:  
</p><p>"Paul! Paul! come and look!"  
</p><p>It was his mother's voice.  He threw down his book and went  
out.  There was a long garden that ran to a field.  It was a grey, cold  
day, with a sharp wind blowing out of Derbyshire.  Two fields away  
Bestwood began, with a jumble of roofs and red house-ends, out  
of which rose the church tower and the spire of the Congregational  
Chapel.  And beyond went woods and hills, right away to the pale  
grey heights of the Pennine Chain.  
</p><p>Paul looked down the garden for his mother.  Her head appeared  
among the young currant-bushes.  
</p><p>"Come here!" she cried.  
</p><p>"What for?" he answered.  
</p><p>"Come and see."  
</p><p>She had been looking at the buds on the currant trees.  Paul went  
up.  
</p><p>"To think," she said, "that here I might never have seen them!"  
</p><p>Her son went to her side.  Under the fence, in a little bed, was  
a ravel of poor grassy leaves, such as come from very immature  
bulbs, and three scyllas in bloom.  Mrs. Morel pointed to the deep  
blue flowers.  
  
</p><p>"Now, just see those!" she exclaimed.  "I was looking at the   
currant bushes, when, thinks I to myself, 'There's something very  
blue; is it a bit of sugar-bag?' and there, behold you! Sugar-bag!  
Three glories of the snow, and such beauties! But where on earth  
did they come from?"  
</p><p>"I don't know," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Well,  
that's a marvel, now! I thought I knew every weed and  
blade in this garden.  But haven't they done well? You see, that  
gooseberry-bush just shelters them.  Not nipped, not touched!"  
</p><p>He crouched down and turned up the bells of the little blue  
flowers.  
</p><p>"They're a glorious colour!" he said.  
</p><p>"Aren't they!" she cried.  "I guess they come from Switzerland,  
where they say they have such lovely things.  Fancy them against  
the snow! But where have they come from? They can't have  
blown here, can they?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="174"/>   
  
<p>Then he remembered having set here a lot of little trash of bulbs  
to mature.  
</p><p>"And you never told me," she said.  
</p><p>"No! I thought I'd leave it till they might flower."  
</p><p>"And now, you see! I might have missed them.  And I've never  
had a glory of the snow in my garden in my life."  
</p><p>She was full of excitement and elation.  The garden was an   
endless joy to her.  Paul was thankful for her sake at last to be  
in a house with a long garden that went down to a field.  Every  
morning after breakfast she went out and was happy pottering  
about in it.  And it was true, she knew every weed and blade.  
</p><p>Everybody turned up for the walk.  Food was packed, and they  
set off, a merry, delighted party.  They hung over the wall of the  
mill-race, dropped paper in the water on one side of the tunnel  
and watched it shoot out on the other.  They stood on the   
footbridge over Boathouse Station and looked at the metals gleaming  
coldly.  
</p><p>"You should see the Flying Scotsman come through at half-past  
six!" said Leonard, whose father was a signalman.  "Lad, but she  
doesn't half buzz!" and the little party looked up the lines one way,  
to London, and the other way, to Scotland, and they felt the touch  
of these two magical places.  
</p><p>In Ilkeston the colliers were waiting in gangs for the public-houses to open.  It was a town of idleness and lounging.  At Stanton  
Gate the iron foundry blazed.  Over everything there were great  
discussions.  At Trowell they crossed again from Derbyshire into  
Nottinghamshire.  They came to the Hemlock Stone at dinner-time.   
Its field was crowded with folk from Nottingham and Ilkeston.  
</p><p>They had expected a venerable and dignified monument.  They  
found a little, gnarled, twisted stump of rock, something like a   
decayed mushroom, standing out pathetically on the side of a field.   
Leonard and Dick immediately proceeded to carve their  
initials, "L. W." and "R.  P.", in the old red sandstone; but  
Paul desisted, because he had read in the newspaper satirical remarks about  
initial-carvers, who could find no other road to immortality.  Then  
all the lads climbed to the top of the rock to look round.  
</p><p>Everywhere in the field below, factory girls and lads were eating  
lunch or sporting about.  Beyond was the garden of an old manor.  
  
  
<pb n="175"/>   
It had yew-hedges and thick clumps and borders of yellow crocuses   
round the lawn.  
</p><p>"See," said Paul to Miriam, "what a quiet garden!"  
</p><p>She saw the dark yews and the golden crocuses, then she looked  
gratefully.  He had not seemed to belong to her among all these  
others; he was different then &mdash; not her Paul, who understood the  
slightest quiver of her innermost soul, but something else, speaking   
another language than hers.  How it hurt her, and deadened her  
very perceptions.  Only when be came right back to her, leaving  
his other, his lesser self, as she thought, would she feel alive again.   
And now he asked her to look at this garden, wanting the contact  
with her again.  Impatient of the set in the field, she turned to the  
quiet lawn, surrounded by sheaves of shut-up crocuses.  A feeling  
of stillness, almost of ecstasy, came over her.  It felt almost as if she  
were alone with him in this garden.  
</p><p>Then he left her again and joined the others.  Soon they started  
home.  Miriam loitered behind, alone.  She did not fit in with the  
others; she could very rarely get into human relations with anyone:   
so her friend, her companion, her lover, was Nature.  She saw  
the sun declining wanly.  In the dusky, cold hedgerows were some  
red leaves.  She lingered to gather them, tenderly, passionately.   
The love in her finger-tips caressed the leaves; the passion in her  
heart came to a glow upon the leaves.  
</p><p>Suddenly she realised she was alone in a strange road, and she  
hurried forward.  Turning a corner in the lane, she came upon Paul,  
who stood bent over something, his mind fixed on it, working away  
steadily, patiently, a little hopelessly.  She hesitated in her approach,  
to watch.  
</p><p>He remained concentrated in the middle of the road.  Beyond,  
one rift of rich gold in that colourless grey evening seemed to make  
him stand out in dark relief.  She saw him, slender and firm, as if  
the setting sun had given him to her.  A deep pain took hold of  
her, and she knew she must love him.  And she had discovered  
him, discovered in him a rare potentiality, discovered his loneliness.    
Quivering as at some "annunciation", she went slowly forward.  
</p><p>At last he looked up.  
</p><p>"Why," he exclaimed gratefully, "have you waited for me!"  
</p><p>She saw a deep shadow in his eyes.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="176"/>   
  
<p>"What is it?" she asked.  
</p><p>"The spring broken here;" and he showed her where his umbrella   
was injured.  
</p><p>Instantly, with some shame, she knew he had not done the   
damage himself, but that Geoffrey was responsible.  
</p><p>"It is only an old umbrella, isn't it?" she asked.  
</p><p>She wondered why he, who did not usually trouble over trifles,  
made such a mountain of this molehill.  
</p><p>"But it was William's an' my mother can't help but know," he  
said quietly, still patiently working at the umbrella.  
</p><p>The words went through Miriam like a blade.  This, then, was  
the confirmation of her vision of him! She looked at him.  But there  
was about him a certain reserve, and she dared not comfort him,  
not even speak softly to him.  
</p><p>"Come on," he said.  "I can't do it;" and they went in silence  
along the road.  
</p><p>That same evening they were walking along under the trees by  
Nether Green.  He was talking to her fretfully, seemed to be struggling   
to convince himself.  
</p><p>"You know," he said, with an effort, "if one person loves,  
the other does."  
</p><p>"Ah!" she answered.  "Like mother said to me when I was little,  
'Love begets love.'"  
</p><p>"Yes, something like that, I think it must be."  
</p><p>"I hope so, because, if it were not, love might be a very terrible  
thing," she said.  
</p><p>"Yes, but it is &mdash; at least with most people," he answered.  
</p><p>And Miriam, thinking he had assured himself, felt strong in   
herself.  She always regarded that sudden coming upon him in the lane  
as a revelation.  And this conversation remained graven in her  
mind as one of the letters of the law.  
</p><p>Now she stood with him and for him.  When, about this time,  
he outraged the family feeling at Willey Farm by some overbearing  
insult, she stuck to him, and believed he was right.  And at this time  
she dreamed dreams of him, vivid, unforgettable.  These dreams  
came again later on, developed to a more subtle psychological  
stage.  
</p><p>On the Easter Monday the same party took an excursion to  
Wingfield Manor.  It was great excitement to Miriam to catch a  
  
<pb n="177"/>   
  
train at Sethley Bridge, amid all the bustle of the Bank Holiday  
crowd.  They left the train at Alfreton.  Paul was interested in the  
street and in the colliers with their dogs.  Here was a new race of  
miners.  Miriam did not live till they came to the church.  They  
were all rather timid of entering, with their bags of food, for fear  
of being turned out.  Leonard, a comic, thin fellow, went first; Paul,  
who would have died rather than be sent back, went last.  The  
place was decorated for Easter.  In the font hundreds of white  
narcissi seemed to be growing.  The air was dim and coloured from  
the windows and thrilled with a subtle scent of lilies and narcissi.   
In that atmosphere Miriam's soul came into a glow.  Paul was  
afraid of the things he mustn't do; and he was sensitive to the feel  
of the place.  Miriam turned to him.  He answered.  They were together.    
He would not go beyond the Communion-rail.  She loved  
him for that.  Her soul expanded into prayer beside him.  He felt  
the strange fascination of shadowy religious places.  All his latent  
mysticism quivered into life.  She was drawn to him.  He was a  
prayer along with her.  
</p><p>Miriam very rarely talked to the other lads.  They at once   
became awkward in conversation with her.  So usually she was silent.  
</p><p>It was past midday when they climbed the steep path to the  
manor.  All things shone softly in the sun, which was wonderfully  
warm and enlivening.  Celandines and violets were out.  Everybody  
was tip-top full with happiness.  The glitter of the ivy, the soft,   
atmospheric grey of the castle walls, the gentleness of everything  
near the ruin, was perfect.  
</p><p>The manor is of hard, pale grey stone, and the other walls are  
blank and calm.  The young folk were in raptures.  They went in  
trepidation, almost afraid that the delight of exploring this ruin  
might be denied them.  In the first courtyard, within the high  
broken walls, were farm-carts, with their shafts lying idle on the  
ground, the tyres of the wheels brilliant with gold-red rust.  It was  
very still.  
</p><p>All eagerly paid their sixpences, and went timidly through the  
fine clean arch of the inner courtyard.  They were shy.  Here on the  
pavement, where the hall had been, an old thorn tree was budding.   
All kinds of strange openings and broken rooms were in the  
shadow around them.  
</p><p>After lunch they set off once more to explore the ruin.  This  
  
  
<pb n="178"/>   
  
time the girls went with the boys, who could act as guides and  
expositors.  There was one tall tower in a corner, rather tottering,  
where they say Mary Queen of Scots was imprisoned.  
</p><p>"Think of the Queen going up here!" said Miriam in a low voice,  
as she climbed the hollow stairs.  
</p><p>"If she could get up," said Paul, "for she had rheumatism Eke  
anything.  I reckon they treated her rottenly."  
</p><p>"You don't think she deserved it?" asked Miriam.  
</p><p>"No, I don't.  She was only lively."  
</p><p>They continued to mount the winding staircase.  A high wind,  
blowing through the loopholes, went rushing up the shaft, and  
filled the girl's skirts like a balloon, so that she was ashamed, until  
he took the hem of her dress and held it down for her.  He did it  
perfectly simply, as he would have picked up her glove.  She remembered   
this always.  
</p><p>Round the broken top of the tower the ivy bushed out, old and  
handsome.  Also, there were a few chill gillivers, in pale cold bud.   
Miriam wanted to lean over for some ivy, but he would not let  
her.  Instead, she had to wait behind him, and take from him each  
spray as he gathered it and held it to her, each one separately, in  
the purest manner of chivalry.  The tower seemed to rock in the  
wind.  They looked over miles and miles of wooded country, and  
country with gleams of pasture.  
</p><p>The crypt underneath the manor was beautiful, and in perfect  
preservation.  Paul made a drawing: Miriam stayed with him.  She  
was thinking of Mary Queen of Scots looking with her strained,  
hopeless eyes, that could not understand misery, over the hills  
whence no help came, or sitting in this crypt, being told of a God  
as cold as the place she sat in.  
</p><p>They set off again gaily, looking round on their beloved manor  
that stood so clean and big on its hill.  
</p><p>"Supposing  you could have that farm," said Paul to Miriam.  
</p><p>"Yes!"  
</p><p>"Wouldn't it be lovely to come and see you!"  
</p><p>They were now in the bare country of stone walls, which he  
loved, and which, though only ten miles from home, seemed so  
foreign to Miriam.  The party was straggling.  As they were crossing  
a large meadow that sloped away from the sun, along a path embedded   
with innumerable tiny glittering points, Paul, walking  
  
  
<pb n="179"/>   
  
alongside, laced his fingers in the strings of the bag Miriam was  
carrying, and instantly she felt Annie behind, watchful and jealous.   
But the meadow was bathed in a glory of sunshine, and the path  
was jewelled, and it was seldom that he gave her any sign.  She  
held her fingers very still among the strings of the bag, his  
fingers touching; and the place was golden as a vision.  
</p><p>At last they came into the straggling grey village of Crich, that  
lies high.  Beyond the village was the famous Crich Stand that Paul  
could see from the garden at home.  The party pushed on.  Great  
expanse of country spread around and below.  The lads were eager  
to get to the top of the hill.  It was capped by a round knoll, half  
of which was by now cut away, and on the top of which stood an  
ancient monument, sturdy and squat, for signalling in old days far  
down into the level lands of Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire.  
</p><p>It was blowing so hard, high up there in the exposed place, that  
the only way to be safe was to stand nailed by the wind to the wan  
of the tower.  At their feet fell the precipice where the limestone  
was quarried away.  Below was a jumble of hills and tiny villages  
&mdash; Mattock, Ambergate, Stoney Middleton.  The lads were eager to  
spy out the church of Bestwood, far away among the rather  
crowded country on the left.  They were disgusted that it seemed  
to stand on a plain.  They saw the hills of Derbyshire fall into the  
monotony of the Midlands that swept away South.  
</p><p>Miriam was somewhat scared by the wind, but the lads enjoyed  
it. They went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell.  All the food  
was eaten, everybody was hungry, and there was very little money  
to get home with.  But they managed to procure a loaf and a  
currant-loaf, which they hacked to pieces with shut-knives, and  
ate sitting on the wall near the bridge, watching the bright Derwent  
rushing by, and the brakes from Matlock pulling up at the inn.  
</p><p>Paul was now pale with weariness.  He had been responsible for  
the party all day, and now he was done.  Miriam understood, and  
kept close to him, and he left himself in her hands.  
</p><p>They had an hour to wait at Ambergate Station.  Trains came,  
crowded with excursionists returning to Manchester, Birmingham,  
and London.  
</p><p>"We might be going there &mdash; folk easily might think we're going  
that far," said Paul.  
</p><p>They got back rather late.  Miriam, walking home with Geoffrey,  
  
  
<pb n="180"/>   
  
watched the moon rise big and red and misty.  She felt something  
was fulfilled in her.  
</p><p>She had an elder sister, Agatha, who was a school-teacher.    
Between the two girls was a feud.  Miriam considered Agatha  
worldly.  And she wanted herself to be a school-teacher.  
</p><p>One Saturday afternoon Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing.    
Their bedroom was over the stable.  It was a low room, not  
very large, and bare.  Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction  
of Veronese's "St.  Catherine".  She loved the woman who sat in  
the window, dreaming.  Her own windows were too small to sit  
in. But the front one was dripped over with honeysuckle and virginia   
creeper, and looked upon the tree-tops of the oak-wood  
across the yard, while the little back window, no bigger than a  
handkerchief, was a loophole to the east, to the dawn beating up  
against the beloved round hills.  
</p><p>The two sisters did not talk much to each other.  Agatha, who  
was fair and small and determined, had rebelled against the home  
atmosphere, against the doctrine of "the other cheek".  She was  
out in the world now, in a fair way to be independent.  And she   
insisted on worldly values, on appearance, on manners, on position,  
which Miriam would fain have ignored.  
</p><p>Both girls liked to be upstairs, out of the way, when Paul came.   
They preferred to come running down, open the stair-foot door,  
and see him watching, expectant of them.  Miriam stood painfully  
pulling over her head a rosary he had given her.  It caught in the  
fine mesh of her hair.  But at last she had it on, and the red-brown  
wooden beads looked well against her cool brown neck.  She was  
a well-developed girl, and very handsome.  But in the little looking-glass nailed against the whitewashed wall she could only see a fragment   
of herself at a time.  Agatha had bought a little mirror of her  
own, which she propped up to suit herself.  Miriam was near the  
window.  Suddenly she heard the well-known click of the chain,  
and she saw Paul fling open the gate, push his bicycle into the yard.   
She saw him look at the house, and she shrank away.  He walked  
in a nonchalant fashion, and his bicycle went with him as if it were  
a live thing.  
</p><p>"Paul's come!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"Aren't you glad?" said Agatha cuttingly.  
</p><p>Miriam stood still in amazement and bewilderment.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="181"/>   
<p>"Well, aren't you?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Yes, but I'm not going to let him see it, and think I wanted  
him."  
</p><p>Miriam was startled.  She heard him putting his bicycle in the  
stable underneath, and talking to Jimmy, who had been a pit-horse, and who was seedy.  
</p><p>"Well, Jimmy my lad, how are ter? Nobbut sick an' sadly, like?  
Why, then, it's a shame, my owd lad."  
</p><p>She heard the rope run through the hole as the horse lifted its  
head from the lad's caress.  How she loved to listen when  
he thought only the horse could hear.  But there was a serpent in her  
Eden.  She searched earnestly in herself to see if she wanted Paul  
Morel.  She felt there would be some disgrace in it.  Full of twisted  
feeling, she was afraid she did want him.  She stood self-convicted.   
Then came an agony of new shame.  She shrank within herself in  
a coil of torture.  Did she want Paul Morel, and did be know she  
wanted him? What a subtle infamy upon her.  She felt as if her  
whole soul coiled into knots of shame.  
</p><p>Agatha was dressed first, and ran downstairs.  Miriam heard  
her greet the lad gaily, knew exactly how brilliant her grey eyes  
became with that tone.  She herself would have felt it bold to have  
greeted him in such wise.  Yet there she stood under the self-accusation of wanting him, tied to that stake of torture.  In bitter  
perplexity she kneeled down and prayed:  
</p><p>"O Lord, let me not love Paul Morel.  Keep me from loving him,  
if I ought not to love him."  
</p><p>Something anomalous in the prayer arrested her.  She lifted her  
head and pondered.  How could it be wrong to love him? Love was  
God's gift.  And yet it caused her shame.  That was because of  
him, Paul Morel.  But, then, it was not his affair, it was her own,  
between herself and God.  She was to be a sacrifice.  But it was  
God's sacrifice, not Paul Morel's or her own.  After a few minutes  
she hid her face in the pillow again, and said:  
</p><p>"But, Lord, if it is Thy will that I should love him, make me love  
him-as Christ would, who died for the souls of men.  Make me  
love him splendidly, because he is Thy son."  
</p><p>She remained kneeling for some time, quite still, and deeply  
moved, her black hair against the red squares and the lavender-sprigged squares of the patchwork quilt.  Prayer was almost essential  
  
  
<pb n="182"/>   
  
to ber.  Then she fell into that rapture of self-sacrifice,  
identifying herself with a God who was sacrificed, which gives to  
so many human souls their deepest bliss.  
</p><p>When she went downstairs Paul was lying back in an arm-chair,  
holding forth with much vehemence to Agatha, who was scorning  
a little painting he had brought to show her.  Miriam glanced at the  
two, and avoided their levity.  She went into the parlour to be alone.  
</p><p>It was tea-time before she was able to speak to Paul, and then  
her manner was so distant he thought he had offended her.  
</p><p>Miriam discontinued her practice of going each Thursday evening   
to the library in Bestwood.  After calling for Paul regularly  
during the whole spring, a number of trifling incidents and tiny  
insults from his family awakened her to their attitude towards  
her, and she decided to go no more.  So she announced to Paul  
one evening she would not call at his house again for him on Thursday  
nights.  
</p><p>"Why?" he asked, very short.  
</p><p>"Nothing.  Only I'd rather not."  
</p><p>"Very well."  
</p><p>"But," she faltered, "if you'd care to meet me, we could still go  
together."  
</p><p>"Meet you where?"  
</p><p>"Somewhere &mdash; where you like."  
</p><p>"I shan't meet you anywhere.  I don't see why you shouldn't keep  
calling for me.  But if you won't, I don't want to meet you."  
</p><p>So the Thursday evenings which had been so precious to her,  
and to him, were dropped.  He worked instead.  Mrs. Morel sniffed  
with satisfaction at this arrangement.  
</p><p>He would not have it that they were lovers.  The intimacy   
between them had been kept so abstract, such a matter of the soul,  
all thought and weary struggle into consciousness, that he saw it  
only as a platonic friendship.  He stoutly denied there was anything  
else between them.  Miriam was silent, or else she very quietly  
agreed.  He was a fool who did not know what was happening to  
himself.  By tacit agreement they ignored the remarks and insinuations   
of their acquaintances.  
</p><p>"We aren't lovers, we are friends," he said to her.  "We know it.   
Let them talk.  What does it matter what they say."  
</p><p>Sometimes, as they were walking together, she slipped her arm  
  
  
<pb n="183"/>   
  
timidly into his.  But he always resented it, and she knew it.  It  
caused a violent conflict in him.  With Miriam he was always on  
the high plane of abstraction, when his natural fire of love was  
transmitted into the fine stream of thought.  She would have it so.   
If he were jolly and, as she put it, flippant, she waited tiff he came  
back to her, till the change had taken place in him again, and he  
was wrestling with his own soul, frowning, passionate in his desire  
for understanding.  And in this passion for understanding her  
soul lay close to his; she had him all to herself.  But he must be  
made abstract first.  
</p><p>Then, if she put her arm in his, it caused him almost torture.  His  
consciousness seemed to split.  The place where she was touching  
him ran hot with friction.  He was one internecine battle, and he  
became cruel to her because of it.  
</p><p>One evening in midsummer Miriam called at the house, warm  
from climbing.  Paul was alone in the kitchen; his mother could  
be heard moving about upstairs.  
</p><p>"Come and look at the sweet-peas," he said to the girl.  
</p><p>They went into the garden.  The sky behind the townlet and the  
church was orange-red; the flower-garden was flooded with a  
strange warm light that lifted every leaf into significance.  Paul  
passed along a fine row of sweet-peas, gathering a blossom here  
and there, all cream and pale blue.  Miriam followed, breathing  
the fragrance.  To her, flowers appealed with such strength she felt  
she must make them part of herself.  When she bent and breathed  
a flower, it was as if she and the flower were loving each other.   
Paul hated her for it.  There seemed a sort of exposure about the  
action, something too intimate.  
</p><p>When he had got a fair bunch, they returned to the house.  He  
listened for a moment to his mother's quiet movement upstairs,  
then he said:  
</p><p>"Come here, and let me pin them in for you." He arranged them  
two or three at a time in the bosom of her dress, stepping back  
now and then to see the effect.  "You know," he said, taking the  
pin out of his mouth, "a woman ought always to arrange her  
flowers before her glass."  
</p><p>Miriam laughed.  She thought flowers ought to be pinned in one's  
dress without any care.  That Paul should take pains to fix her  
flowers for her was his whim.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="184"/>   
  
<p>He was rather offended at her laughter.  
</p><p>"Some women do &mdash; those who look decent," he said.  
</p><p>Miriam laughed again, but mirthlessly, to hear him thus mix  
her up with women in a general way.  From most men she would  
have ignored it.  But from him it hurt her.  
</p><p>He had nearly finished arranging the flowers when he heard his  
mother's footstep on the stairs.  Hurriedly he pushed in the last  
pin and turned away.  
</p><p>"Don't let mater know," he said.  
</p><p>Miriam picked up her books and stood in the doorway looking  
with chagrin at the beautiful sunset.  She would call for Paul no  
more, she said.  
</p><p>"Good-evening, Mrs. Morel," she said, in a deferential way.   
She sounded as if she felt she had no right to be there.  
</p><p>"Oh, is it you, Miriam?" replied Mrs. Morel coolly.  
</p><p>But Paul insisted on everybody's accepting his friendship with  
the girl, and Mrs. Morel was too wise to have any open rupture.  
</p><p>It was not till he was twenty years old that the family could  
ever afford to go away for a holiday.  Mrs. Morel had never been away  
for a holiday, except to see her sister, since she had been married.   
Now at last Paul had saved enough money, and they were all going.    
There was to be a party: some of Annie's friends, one friend  
of Paul's, a young man in the same office where William had previously   
been, and Miriam.  
</p><p>It was great excitement writing for rooms.  Paul and his mother  
debated it endlessly between them.  They wanted a furnished cottage   
for two weeks.  She thought one week would be enough, but  
he insisted on two.  
</p><p>At last they got an answer from Mablethorpe, a cottage such as  
they wished for thirty shillings a week.  There was immense jubilation.    
Paul was wild with joy for his mother's sake.  She would have  
a real holiday now.  He and she sat at evening picturing what it  
would be like.  Annie came in, and Leonard, and Alice, and Kitty.   
There was wild rejoicing and anticipation.  Paul told Miriam.  She  
seemed to brood with joy over it.  But the Morel's house rang with  
excitement.  
</p><p>They were to go on Saturday morning by the seven train.  Paul  
suggested that Miriam should sleep at his house, because it was so  
far for her to walk.  She came down for supper.  Everybody was  
so excited that even Miriam was accepted with warmth.  But almost  
  
  
<pb n="185"/>   
  
as soon as she entered the feeling in the family became close and  
tight.  He had discovered a poem by Jean Ingelow which mentioned  
Mablethorpe, and so he must read it to Miriam.  He would never  
have got so far in the direction of sentimentality as to read poetry  
to his own family.  But now they condescended to listen.  Miriam  
sat on the sofa absorbed in him.  She always seemed absorbed in  
him, and by him, when he was present.  Mrs. Morel sat jealously  
in her own chair.  She was going to hear also.  And even Annie and  
the father attended, Morel with his head cocked on one side, like  
somebody listening to a sermon and feeling conscious of the fact.   
Paul ducked his head over the book.  He had got now all the audience   
he cared for.  And Mrs. Morel and Annie almost contested  
with Miriam who should listen best and win his favour.  He was  
in very high feather.  
</p><p>"But," interrupted Mrs. Morel, "what is the 'Bride of Enderby'  
that the bells are supposed to ring?"  
</p><p>"It's an old tune they used to play on the bells for a warning  
against water.  I suppose the Bride of Enderby was drowned in a  
flood," he replied.  He had not the faintest knowledge what it really  
was, but he would never have sunk so low as to confess that  
to his womenfolk.  They listened and believed him.  He believed  
himself.  
</p><p>"And the people knew what that tune meant?" said his mother.  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; just like the Scotch when they heard 'The Flowers o' the  
Forest' &mdash; and when they used to ring the bells backward for alarm."  
</p><p>"How?" said Annie.  "A bell sounds the same whether it's rung  
backwards or forwards."  
</p><p>"But," be said, "if you start with the deep bell and ring up to  
the high one &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der &mdash; der!"  
</p><p>He ran up the scale.  Everybody thought it clever.  He thought so  
too.  Then, waiting a minute, he continued the poem.  
</p><p>"Hm!" said Mrs. Morel curiously, when he finished.  "But I  
wish everything that's written weren't so sad."  
</p><p>"I canna see what they want drownin' theirselves for," said  
Morel.  
</p><p>There was a pause.  Annie got up to clear the table.  
</p><p>Miriam rose to help with the pots.  
</p><p>"Let me help to wash up," she said.  
</p><p>"Certainly not," cried Annie.  "You sit down again.  There aren't  
many."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="186"/>   
  
<p>And Miriam, who could not be familiar and insist, sat down  
again to look at the book with Paul.  
</p><p>He was master of the party; his father was no good.  And great  
tortures he suffered lest the tin box should be put out at Firsby   
instead of at Mablethorpe.  And he wasn't equal to getting a carriage.   
His bold little mother did that.  
</p><p>"Here!" she cried to a man.  "Here!"  
</p><p>Paul and Annie got behind the rest, convulsed with shamed  
laughter.  
</p><p>"How much will it be to drive to Brook Cottage?" said Mrs.  
Morel.  
</p><p>"Two shillings."  
</p><p>"Why, how far is it?"  
</p><p>"A good way."  
</p><p>"I don't believe it," she said.  
</p><p>But she scrambled in.  There were eight crowded in one old  
seaside carriage.  
</p><p>"You see," said Mrs. Morel, "it's only threepence each, and if  
it were a tram-car &mdash; "  
</p><p>They drove along.  Each cottage  they  came  to,  Mrs.  Morel  cried:  
</p><p>"Is it this? Now, this is it!"  
</p><p>Everybody sat breathless.  They drove past.  There was a  
universal sigh.  
</p><p>"I'm thankful it wasn't that brute," said Mrs. Morel.  "I was  
frightened." They drove on and on.  
</p><p>At last they descended at a house that stood alone over the dyke  
by the highroad.  There was wild excitement because they had to  
cross a little bridge to get into the front garden.  But they loved the  
house that lay so solitary, with a sea-meadow on one side, and immense   
expanse of land patched in white barley, yellow oats, red  
wheat, and green root-crops, flat and stretching level to the sky.  
</p><p>Paul kept accounts.  He and his mother ran the show.  The total  
expenses &mdash; lodging, food, everything &mdash; was sixteen shillings a week  
per person.  He and Leonard went bathing in the moming.  Morel  
was wandering abroad quite early.  
</p><p>"You, Paul," his mother called from the bedroom, "eat a piece  
of bread-and-butter."  
</p><p>"All right," he answered.   
</p><p>And when he got back he saw his mother presiding in state at  
  
  
<pb n="187"/>   
  
the breakfast-table.  The woman of the house was young.  Her husband   
was blind, and she did laundry work.  So Mrs. Morel always  
washed the pots in the kitchen and made the beds.  
</p><p>"But you said you'd have a real holiday," said Paul, "and now  
you work."  
</p><p>"Work!" she exclaimed.  "What are you talking about!"  
</p><p>He loved to go with her across the fields to the village and the  
sea.  She was afraid of the plank bridge, and he abused her for being   
a baby.  On the whole he stuck to her as if he were her man.  
</p><p>Miriam did not get much of him, except, perhaps, when all the  
others went to the "Coons".  Coons were insufferably stupid to  
Miriam, so he thought they were to himself also, and he preached  
priggishly to Annie about the fatuity of listening to them.  Yet he,  
too, knew all their songs, and sang them along the roads roisterously.    
And if he found himself listening, the stupidity pleased him  
very much.  Yet to Annie he said:  
</p><p>"Such rot! there isn't a grain of intelligence in it.  Nobody with  
more gumption than a grasshopper could go and sit and listen."  
And to Miriam he said, with much scorn of Annie and the others:  
"I suppose they're at the 'Coons'."  
</p><p>It was queer to see Miriam singing coon songs.  She had a  
straight chin that went in a perpendicular line from the lower lip  
to the turn.  She always reminded Paul of some sad Botticelli angel  
when she sang, even when it was:  
 </p> 
<l>         "Come down lover's lane</l>  
<l>          For a walk with me, talk with me."</l>  
  
<p>Only when he sketched, or at evening when the others were at  
the "Coons", she had him to herself.  He talked to her endlessly  
about his love of horizontals: how they, the great levels of sky and  
land in Lincolnshire, meant to him the eternality of the will, just  
as the bowed Norman arches of the church, repeating themselves,  
meant the dogged leaping forward of the persistent human soul,  
on and on, nobody knows where; in contradiction to the perpendicular   
lines and to the Gothic arch, which, he said, leapt up at  
heaven and touched the ecstasy and lost itself in the divine.    
Himself, he said, was Norman, Miriam was Gothic.  She bowed in   
consent even to that.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="188"/>   
  
<p>One evening he and she went up the great sweeping shore of  
sand towards Theddlethorpe.  The long breakers plunged and ran in  
a hiss of foam along the coast.  It was a warm evening.  There was  
not a figure but themselves on the far reaches of sand, no noise  
but the sound of the sea.  Paul loved to see it clanging at the land.   
He loved to feel himself between the noise of it and the silence  
of the sandy shore.  Miriam was with him.  Everything grew very  
intense.  It was quite dark when they turned again.  The way home  
was through a gap in the sandhills, and then along a raised grass  
road between two dykes.  The country was black and still.  From  
behind the sandhills came the whisper of the sea.  Paul and Miriam   
walked in silence.  Suddenly he started.  The whole of his blood  
seemed to burst into flame, and he could scarcely breathe.  An  
enormous orange moon was staring at them from the rim of the  
sandhills.  He stood still, looking at it.  
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Miriam, when she saw it.  
</p><p>He remained perfectly still, staring at the immense and ruddy  
moon, the only thing in the far-reaching darkness of the level.  His  
heart beat heavily, the muscles of his arms contracted.  
</p><p>"What is it?" murmured Miriam, waiting for him.  
</p><p>He turned and looked at her.  She stood beside him, for ever  
in shadow.  Her face, covered with the darkness of her hat, was  
watching him unseen.  But she was brooding.  She was slightly  
afraid &mdash; deeply moved and religious.  That was her best state.  He  
was impotent against it.  His blood was concentrated like a flame  
in his chest.  But he could not get across to her.  There were flashes  
in his blood.  But somehow she ignored them.  She was expecting  
some religious state in him.  Still yearning, she was half aware  
of his passion, and gazed at him, troubled.  
</p><p>"What is it?" she murmured again.  
</p><p>"It's the moon," he answered, frowning.  
</p><p>"Yes," she assented.  "Isn't it wonderful?" She was curious  
about him.  The crisis was past.  
</p><p>He did not know himself what was the matter.  He was naturally  
so young, and their intimacy was so abstract, he did not know he  
wanted to crush her on to his breast to ease the ache there.  He  
was afraid of her.  The fact that he might want her as a man wants  
a woman had in him been suppressed into a shame.  When she  
shrank in her convulsed, coiled torture from the thought of such  
  
  
<pb n="189"/>   
  
a thing, he had winced to the depths of his soul.  And now this  
"purity" prevented even their first love-kiss.  It was as if she could  
scarcely stand the shock of physical love, even a passionate kiss,  
and then he was too shrinking and sensitive to give it.  
</p><p>As they walked along the dark fen-meadow he watched the  
moon and did not speak.  She plodded beside him.  He hated her,  
for she seemed in some way to make him despise himself.  Looking   
ahead &mdash; he saw the one light in the darkness, the window of  
their lamp-lit cottage.  
</p><p>He loved to think of his mother, and the other jolly people.  
</p><p>"Well, everybody else has been in long ago!" said his mother  
as they entered.  
</p><p>"What does that matter!" he cried irritably.  "I can go a walk if  
I like, can't I?"  
</p><p>"And I should have thought you could get in to supper with  
the rest," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"I shall please myself," he retorted.  "It's not late.  I shall do as  
I like."  
</p><p>"Very well," said his mother cuttingly, "then do as you like."  
And she took no further notice of him that evening.  Which he  
pretended neither to notice nor to care about, but sat reading.    
Miriam read also, obliterating herself.  Mrs. Morel hated her for   
making her son like this.  She watched Paul growing irritable, priggish,  
and melancholic.  For this she put the blame on Miriam.  Annie  
and all her friends joined against the girl.  Miriam had no friend  
of her own, only Paul.  But she did not suffer so much, because  
she despised the triviality of these other people.  
</p><p>And Paul hated her because, somehow, she spoilt his ease and  
naturalness.  And he writhed himself with a feeling of humiliation.</p>

<p>ARTHUR finished his apprenticeship, and got a job on the electrical  
plant at Minton Pit.  He earned very little, but had a good chance  
of getting on.  But he was wild and restless.  He did not drink nor  
gamble.  Yet he somehow contrived to get into endless scrapes,  
  
  
<pb n="190"/>   
  
always through some hot-beaded thoughtlessness.  Either he went  
rabbiting in the woods, like a poacher, or he stayed in Nottingham  
all night instead of coming home, or he miscalculated his dive into  
the canal at Bestwood, and scored his chest into one mass of  
wounds on the raw stones and tins at the bottom.  
</p><p>He had not been at his work many months when again he did  
not come home one night.  
</p><p>"Do you know where Arthur is?" asked Paul at breakfast.  
</p><p>"I do not," replied his mother.  
</p><p>"He is a fool," said Paul.  "And if he did anything I shouldn't  
mind.  But no, he simply can't come away from a game of whist,  
or else he must see a girl home from the skating-rink &mdash; quite   
proprietously &mdash; and so can't get home.  He's a fool."  
</p><p>"I don't know that it would make it any better if he did   
something to make us all ashamed," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Well, I should respect him more," said Paul.  
</p><p>"I very much doubt it," said his mother coldly.  
</p><p>They went on with breakfast.  
</p><p>"Are you fearfully fond of him?" Paul asked his mother.  
</p><p>"What do you ask that for?"  
</p><p>"Because they say a woman always like the youngest best."  
</p><p>"She may do &mdash; but I don't.  No, he wearies me."  
</p><p>"And you'd actually rather he was good?"  
</p><p>"I'd rather he showed some of a man's common sense."  
</p><p>Paul was raw and irritable.  He also wearied his mother very   
often.  She saw the sunshine going out of him, and she resented it.  
</p><p>As they were finishing breakfast came the postman with a letter  
from Derby.  Mrs. Morel screwed up her eyes to look at the address.  
</p><p>"Give it here, blind eye!" exclaimed her son, snatching it away  
from her.  
</p><p>She started, and almost boxed his ears.  
</p><p>"It's from your son, Arthur," he said.  
</p><p>"What now &mdash; !" cried Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"'My dearest Mother,'" Paul read, "'I don't know what made  
me such a fool.  I want you to come and fetch me back from here.   
I came with Jack Bredon yesterday, instead of going to work,  
and enlisted.  He said he was sick of wearing the seat of a stool  
out, and, like the idiot you know I am, I came away with him.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="191"/>   
  
<p>"'I have taken the King's shilling, but perhaps if you came for  
me they would let me go back with you.  I was a fool when I did  
it. I don't want to be in the army.  My dear mother, I am nothing  
but a trouble to you.  But if you get me out of this, I promise I will  
have more sense and consideration. . . .'"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel sat down in her rocking-chair.  
</p><p>"Well, now," she cried, "let him stop!"  
</p><p>"Yes," said Paul, "let him stop."  
</p><p>There was silence.  The mother sat with her hands folded in her  
apron, her face set, thinking.  
</p><p>"If I'm not sick!" she cried suddenly.  "Sick!"  
</p><p>"Now," said Paul, beginning to frown, "you're not going to  
worry your soul out about this, do you hear."  
</p><p>"I suppose I'm to take it as a blessing," she flashed, turning on  
her son.  
</p><p>"You're not going to mount it up to a tragedy, so there,"  
he retorted.  
</p><p>"The fool! &mdash; the young fool!" she cried.  
</p><p>"He'll look well in uniform," said Paul irritatingly.  
</p><p>His mother turned on him like a fury.  
</p><p>"Oh, will he!" she cried.  "Not in my eyes!"  
</p><p>"He should get in a cavalry regiment; he'll have the time of his  
life, and will look an awful swell."  
</p><p>"Swell! &mdash; swell! &mdash; a mighty swell idea indeed! &mdash; a common  
soldier!"  
</p><p>"Well," said Paul, "what am I but a common clerk?"  
</p><p>"A good deal, my boy!" cried his mother, stung &mdash;  
</p><p>"What?"  
</p><p>"At any rate, a man, and not a thing in a red coat."  
</p><p>"I shouldn't mind being in a red coat &mdash; or dark blue, that would  
suit me better &mdash; if they didn't boss me about too much."  
</p><p>But his mother had ceased to listen.  
</p><p>"Just as he was getting on, or might have been getting on, at  
his job &mdash; a young nuisance &mdash; here he goes and ruins himself for life.   
What good will he be, do you think, after this?"  
</p><p>"It may lick him into shape beautifully," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Lick him into shape! &mdash; lick what marrow there was out of  
his bones.  A soldier!-a common soldier!-nothing but a body  
that makes movements when it hears a shout! It's a fine thing!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="192"/>   
  
<p>"I can't understand why it upsets you," said Paul.  
</p><p>"No, perhaps you can't.  But I understand"; and she sat back in  
her chair, her chin in one hand, holding her elbow with the other,  
brimmed up with wrath and chagrin.  
</p><p>"And shall you go to Derby?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"It's no good."  
</p><p>"I'll see for myself."  
</p><p>"And why on earth don't you let him stop.  It's just what he  
wants."  
</p><p>"Of course," cried the mother, "you know what he wants!"  
</p><p>She got ready and went by the first train to Derby, where she  
saw her son and the sergeant.  It was, however, no good.  
</p><p>When Morel was having his dinner in the evening, she said  
suddenly:  
</p><p>"I've had to go to Derby to-day."  
</p><p>The miner turned up his eyes, showing the whites in his black  
face.  
</p><p>"Has ter, lass.  What took thee there?"  
</p><p>"That Arthur!"  
</p><p>"Oh &mdash; an' what's agate now?"  
</p><p>"He's only enlisted."  
</p><p>Morel put down his knife and leaned back in his chair.  
</p><p>"Nay," he said, "that he niver 'as!"  
</p><p>"And is going down to Aldershot to-morrow."  
</p><p>"Well!" exclaimed the miner.  "That's a winder." He considered  
it a moment, said "H'm!" and proceeded with his dinner.  Suddenly  
his face contracted with wrath.  "I hope he may never set foot i'  
my house again," he said.  
</p><p>"The idea!" cried Mrs. Morel.  "Saying such a thing!"  
</p><p>"I do," repeated Morel.  "A fool as runs away for a soldier, let  
'im look after 'issen; I s'll do no more for 'im."  
</p><p>"A fat sight you have done as it is," she said.  
</p><p>And Morel was almost ashamed to go to his public-house that  
evening.  
</p><p>"Well, did you go?" said Paul to his mother when he came  
home.  
</p><p>"I did."  
</p><p>"And could you see him?"</p>  
  
<pb n="193"/>   
<p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"And what did he say?"  
</p><p>"He blubbered when I came away."  
</p><p>"H'm!"  
</p><p>"And so did I, so you needn't'h'm'!"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel fretted after her son.  She knew he would not like  
the army.  He did not.  The discipline was intolerable to him.  
</p><p>"But the doctor," she said with some pride to Paul, "said he was  
perfectly proportioned &mdash; almost exactly; all his measurements were  
correct.  He is good-looking, you know."  
</p><p>"He's awfully nice-looking.  But he doesn't fetch the girls like  
William, does he?"  
</p><p>"No; it's a different character.  He's a good deal like his father,  
irresponsible."  
</p><p>To console his mother, Paul did not go much to Willey Farm  
at this time.  And in the autumn exhibition of students' work in the  
Castle he bad two studies, a landscape in water-colour and a still  
life in oil, both of which had first-prize awards.  He was highly  
excited.  
</p><p>"What do you think I've got for my pictures, mother?" he asked,  
coming home one evening.  She saw by his eyes he was glad.  Her  
face flushed.  
</p><p>"Now, how should I know, my boy!"  
</p><p>"A first prize for those glass jars &mdash; "  
</p><p>"H'm!"  
</p><p>"And a first prize for that sketch up at Willey Farm."  
</p><p>"Both first?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"H'm!"  
  
</p><p>There was a rosy, bright look about her, though she said  
nothing.  
</p><p>"It's nice," he said, "isn't it?"  
</p><p>"It is."  
</p><p>"Why don't you praise me up to the skies?"  
</p><p>She laughed.  
</p><p>"I should have the trouble of dragging you down again," she  
said.  
</p><p>But she was full of joy, nevertheless.  William had brought her  
his sporting trophies.  She kept them still, and she did not forgive  
  
  
<pb n="194"/>   
  
his death.  Arthur was handsome &mdash; at least, a good specimen &mdash; and  
warm and generous, and probably would do well in the end.     
But Paul was going to distinguish himself.  She had a great belief  
in him, the more because he was unaware of his own powers.   
There was so much to come out of him.  Life for her was rich with  
promise.  She was to see herself fulfilled.  Not for nothing had been  
her struggle.  
</p><p>Several times during the exhibition Mrs. Morel went to the  
Castle unknown to Paul.  She wandered down the long room looking   
at the other exhibits.  Yes, they were good.  But they had not  
in them a certain something which she demanded for her satisfaction.    
Some made her jealous, they were so good.  She looked at  
them a long time trying to find fault with them.  Then suddenly she  
had a shock that made her heart beat.  There hung Paul's picture!  
She knew it as if it were printed on her heart.  
</p><p>"Name &mdash; Paul Morel &mdash; First Prize."  
</p><p>It looked so strange, there in public, on the walls of the Castle  
gallery, where in her lifetime she had seen so many pictures.  And  
she glanced round to see if anyone had noticed her again in front  
of the same sketch.  
</p><p>But she felt a proud woman.  When she met well-dressed ladies  
going home to the Park, she thought to herself:  
</p><p>"Yes, you look very well &mdash; but I wonder if your son has two first  
prizes in the Castle."  
</p><p>And she walked on, as proud a little woman as any in Nottingham.    
And Paul felt he had done something for her, if only a trifle.   
All his work was hers.  
</p><p>One day, as he was going up Castle Gate, he met Miriam.  He  
had seen her on the Sunday, and had not expected to meet her in  
town.  She was walking with a rather striking woman, blonde, with  
a sullen expression, and a defiant carriage.  It was strange how  
Miriam, in her bowed, meditative bearing, looked dwarfed beside  
this woman with the handsome shoulders.  Miriam watched Paul  
searchingly.  His gaze was on the stranger, who ignored him.  The  
girl saw his masculine spirit rear its head.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he said, "you didn't tell me you were coming to town."  
</p><p>"No," replied Miriam, half apologetically.  "I drove in to Cattle  
Market with father."  
</p><p>He looked at her companion.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="195"/>   
<p>"I've told you about Mrs. Dawes," said Miriam huskily; she  
was nervous.  "Clara, do you know Paul?"  
</p><p>"I think I've seen him before," replied Mrs. Dawes indifferently,  
as she shook hands with him.  She had scornful grey eyes, a skin  
like white honey, and a fun mouth, with a slightly lifted upper lip  
that did not know whether it was raised in scorn of all men or out  
of eagerness to be kissed, but which believed the former.  She  
carried her head back, as if she had drawn away in contempt, perhaps   
from men also.  She wore a large, dowdy hat of black beaver,  
and a sort of slightly affected simple dress that made her look  
rather sack-like.  She was evidently poor, and had not much taste.   
Miriam usually looked nice.  
</p><p>"Where have you seen me?" Paul asked of the woman.  
</p><p>She looked at him as if she would not trouble to answer.  Then:  
</p><p>"Walking with Louie Travers," she said.  
</p><p>Louie was one of the "Spiral" girls.  
</p><p>"Why, do you know her?" he asked.  
</p><p>She did not answer.  He turned to Miriam.  
</p><p>"Where are you going?" he asked.  
</p><p>"To the Castle."  
</p><p>"What train are you going home by?"  
</p><p>"I am driving with father.  I wish you could come too.  What time  
are you free?"  
</p><p>"You know not till eight to-night, damn it!"  
</p><p>And directly the two women moved on.  
</p><p>Paul remembered that Clara Dawes was the daughter of an old  
friend of Mrs. Leivers.  Miriam had sought her out because she  
had once been Spiral overseer at Jordan's, and because her husband,   
Baxter Dawes, was smith for the factory, making the irons  
for cripple instruments, and so on.  Through her Miriam felt she  
got into direct contact with Jordan's, and could estimate better  
Paul's position.  But Mrs. Dawes was separated from her husband,  
and had taken up Women's Rights.  She was supposed to be clever.   
It interested Paul.  
</p><p>Baxter Dawes he knew and disliked.  The smith was a man of  
thirty-one or thirty-two.  He came occasionally through Paul's  
corner &mdash; a big, well-set man, also striking to look at, and handsome.   
There was a peculiar similarity between himself and his wife.  He  
had the same white skin, with a clear, golden tinge.  His hair was

of soft brown, his moustache was golden.  And he had a similar  
defiance in his bearing and manner.  But then came the difference.   
His eyes, dark brown and quick-shifting, were dissolute.  They protruded   
very slightly, and his eyelids hung over them in a way that  
was half hate.  His mouth, too, was sensual.  His whole manner was  
of cowed defiance, as if he were ready to knock anybody down who  
disapproved of him &mdash; perhaps because he really disapproved of  
himself.  
</p><p>From the first day he had hated Paul. Finding the lad's   
impersonal, deliberate gaze of an artist on his face, he got into a fury.  
</p><p>"What are yer lookin' at?" he sneered, bullying.  
</p><p>The boy glanced away.  But the smith used to stand behind the  
counter and talk to Mr. Pappleworth.  His speech was dirty, with  
a kind of rottenness.  Again he found the youth with his cool,  
critical gaze fixed on his face.  The smith started round as if he had  
been stung.  
</p><p>"What'r yer lookin' at, three hap'orth o' pap?" he snarled.  
</p><p>The boy shrugged his shoulders slightly.  
</p><p>"Why yer &mdash; !" shouted Dawes.  
</p><p>"Leave him alone," said Mr. Pappleworth, in that insinuating  
voice which means, "He's only one of your good little sops who  
can't help it."  
</p><p>Since that time the boy used to look at the man every time he  
came through with the same curious criticism, glancing away before he   
met the smith's eye.  It made Dawes furious.  They hated  
each other in silence.  
</p><p>Clara Dawes had no children.  When she had left her husband  
the home had been broken up, and she had gone to live with her  
mother.  Dawes lodged with his sister.  In the same house was a  
sister-in-law, and somehow Paul knew that this girl, Louie Travers,  
was now Dawes's woman.  She was a handsome, insolent hussy,  
who mocked at the youth, and yet flushed if he walked along to the  
station with her as she went home.  
</p><p>The next time he went to see Miriam it was Saturday evening.   
She had a fire in the parlour, and was waiting for him.  The others,  
except her father and mother and the young children, had gone  
out, so the two had the parlour together.  It was a long, low, warm  
room.  There were three of Paul's small sketches on the wan, and  
his photo was on the mantelpiece.  On the table and on the high

old rosewood piano Were bowls of coloured leaves.  He sat in the  
arm-chair, she crouched on the hearthrug near his feet.  The glow  
was warm on her handsome, pensive face as she kneeled there like  
a devotee.  
</p><p>"What did you think of Mrs. Dawes?" she asked quietly.   
</p><p>"She doesn't look very amiable," he replied.  
</p><p>"No, but don't you think she's a fine woman?" she said, in a  
deep tone,  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; in stature.  But without a grain of taste.  I like her for some  
things.  Is she disagreeable?"  
</p><p>"I don't think so.  I think she's  
dissatisfied."  
</p><p>"What with?"  
</p><p>"Well &mdash; how would you like to be tied for life to a man like that?"  
</p><p>"Why did she marry him, then, if she was to have revulsions so  
soon?"  
</p><p>"Ay, why did she!" repeated Miriam bitterly.  
</p><p>"And I should have thought she had enough fight in her to  
match him," he said.  
</p><p>Miriam bowed her head.  
</p><p>"Ay?" she queried satirically.  "What makes you think so?"  
</p><p>"Look at her mouth &mdash; made for passion &mdash; and the very setback  
of her throat &mdash; " He threw his head back in Clara's defiant  
manner.  
</p><p>Miriam bowed a little lower.  
</p><p>"Yes," she said.  
</p><p>There was a silence for some moments, while he thought of  
Clara.  
</p><p>"And what were the things you liked about her?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know &mdash; her skin and the texture of her &mdash; and her &mdash; I don't  
know &mdash; there's a sort of fierceness somewhere in her.  I appreciate  
her as an artist, that's all."  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>He wondered why Miriam crouched there brooding in that  
strange way.  It irritated him.  
</p><p>"You don't really like her, do you?" he asked the girl.  
</p><p>She looked at him with her great, dazzled dark eyes.  
</p><p>"I do," she said.  
</p><p>"You don't &mdash; you can't &mdash; not really."  
</p><p>"Then what?" she asked slowly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="198"/>   
  
<p>"Eh, I don't know &mdash; perhaps you like her because she's got  a  
grudge against men."  
</p><p>That was more probably one of his own reasons for liking Mrs.  
Dawes, but this did not occur to him.  They were silent.  There had  
come into his forehead a knitting of the brows which was becoming   
habitual with him, particularly when he was with Miriam.  She  
longed to smooth it away, and she was afraid of it.  It seemed the  
stamp of a man who was not her man in Paul Morel.  
</p><p>There were some crimson berries among the leaves in the bowl.   
He reached over and pulled out a bunch.  
</p><p>it If you put red berries in your hair," he said, "why would you  
look like some witch or priestess, and never like a reveller?"  
</p><p>She laughed with a naked, painful sound.  
</p><p>"I don't know," she said.  
</p><p>His vigorous warm hands were playing excitedly with the  
berries.  
</p><p>"Why can't you laugh?" he said.  "You never laugh laughter.   
You only laugh when something is odd or incongruous, and then  
it almost seems to hurt you."  
</p><p>She bowed her head as if he were scolding her.  
</p><p>"I wish you could laugh at me just for one minute &mdash; just for one  
minute.  I feel as if it would set something free."  
</p><p>"But" &mdash; and she looked up at him with eyes frightened and  
struggling &mdash; "I do laugh at you &mdash; I do."  
</p><p>"Never! There's always a kind of intensity.  When you laugh I  
could always cry; it seems as if it shows up your suffering.  Oh, you  
make me knit the brows of my very soul and cogitate."  
</p><p>Slowly she shook her head despairingly.  
</p><p>"I'm sure I don't want to," she said.  
</p><p>"I'm so damned spiritual with you always!" he cried.  
</p><p>She remained silent, thinking, "Then why don't you be otherwise."   
But he saw her crouching, brooding figure, and it seemed  
to tear him in two.  
</p><p>"But, there, it's autumn," he said, "and everybody feels like a  
disembodied spirit then."  
</p><p>There was still another silence.  This peculiar sadness between  
them thrilled her soul.  He seemed so beautiful with his eyes gone  
dark, and looking as if they were deep as the deepest well.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="199"/>   
<p>"You make me so spiritual!" he lamented.  "And I don't want  
to be spiritual."  
</p><p>She took her finger from her mouth with a little pop, and looked  
up at him almost challenging.  But stiff her soul was naked in her  
great dark eyes, and there was the same yearning appeal upon her.   
If he could have kissed her in abstract purity he would have done  
so. But he could not kiss her thus &mdash; and she seemed to leave no  
other way.  And she yearned to him.  
</p><p>He gave a brief laugh.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "get that French and we'll do some &mdash; some  
Verlaine."  
</p><p>"Yes," she said in a deep tone, almost of resignation.  And she  
rose and got the books.  And her rather red, nervous hands looked  
so pitiful, he was mad to comfort her and kiss her.  But then be  
dared not &mdash; or could not.  There was something prevented him.  His  
kisses were wrong for her.  They continued the reading till ten  
o'clock, when they went into the kitchen, and Paul was natural  
and jolly again with the father and mother.  His eyes were dark and  
shining; there was a kind of fascination about him.  
</p><p>When he went into the barn for his bicycle he found the front  
wheel punctured.  
</p><p>"Fetch me a drop of water in a bowl," he said to her.  "I shall be  
late, and then I s'll catch it."  
</p><p>He lighted the hurricane lamp, took off his coat, turned up the  
bicycle, and set speedily to work.  Miriam came with the bowl of  
water and stood close to him, watching.  She loved to see his hands  
doing things.  He was slim and vigorous, with a kind of easiness  
even in his most hasty movements.  And busy at his work he  
seemed to forget her.  She loved him absorbedly.  She wanted to run  
her hands down his sides.  She always wanted to embrace him, so  
long as he did not want her.  
</p><p>"There!" he said, rising suddenly.  "Now, could you have done  
it quicker?"  
</p><p>"No!" she laughed.  
</p><p>He straightened himself.  His back was towards her.  She put her  
two hands on his sides, and ran them quickly down.  
</p><p>"You are so fine!" she said.  
</p><p>He laughed, hating her voice, but his blood roused to a wave of  
  
  
<pb n="200"/>   
  
flame by her hands.  She did not seem to realise him in all this.  He  
might have been an object.  She never realised the male he was.  
</p><p>He lighted his bicycle-lamp, bounced the machine on the barn  
floor to see that the tyres were sound, and buttoned his coat.  
</p><p>"That's all right!" he said.  
</p><p>She was trying the brakes, that she knew were broken.  
</p><p>"Did you have them mended?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No!"  
</p><p>"But why didn't you?"  
</p><p>"The back one goes on a bit."  
</p><p>"But it's not safe."  
</p><p>"I can use my toe."  
</p><p>"I wish you'd had them mended," she murmured.  
</p><p>"Don't worry &mdash; come to tea to-morrow, with Edgar."  
</p><p>"Shall we?"  
</p><p>"Do &mdash; about four.  I'll come to meet you."  
</p><p>"Very well."  
</p><p>She was pleased.  They went across the dark yard to the gate.   
Looking across, he saw through the uncurtained window of the  
kitchen the heads of Mr. and Mrs. Leivers in the warm glow.  It  
looked very cosy.  The road, with pine trees, was quite black in  
front.  
</p><p>"Till to-morrow," he said, jumping on his bicycle.  
</p><p>"You'll take care, won't you?" she pleaded.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>His voice already came out of the darkness.  She stood a moment  
watching the light from his lamp race into obscurity along the  
ground.  She turned very slowly indoors.  Orion was wheeling up  
over the wood, his dog twinkling after him, half smothered.  For  
the rest the world was full of darkness, and silent, save for  
the breathing of cattle in their stalls.  She prayed earnestly for his  
safety that night.  When he left her, she often lay in anxiety, wondering   
if he had got home safely.  
</p><p>He dropped down the hills on his bicycle.  The roads were greasy,  
so he had to let it go.  He felt a pleasure as the machine plunged  
over the second, steeper drop in the hill.  "Here goes!" he said.  It  
was risky, because of the curve in the darkness at the bottom, and  
because of the brewers' waggons with drunken waggoners asleep.   
His bicycle seemed to fall beneath him, and he loved it.  Recklessness  
  
  
<pb n="201"/>   
is almost a man's revenge on his woman.  He feels he is not  
valued, so he will risk destroying himself to deprive her altogether.  
</p><p>The stars on the lake seemed to leap like grasshoppers, silver  
upon the blackness, as he spun past.  Then there was the long climb  
home.  
</p><p>"See, mother!" he said, as he threw her the berries and leaves  
on to the table.  
</p><p>"H'm!" she said, glancing at them, then away again.  She sat  
reading, alone, as she always did.  
</p><p>"Aren't they pretty?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>He knew she was cross with him.  After a few minutes he said:  
</p><p>"Edgar and Miriam are coming to tea to-morrow."  
</p><p>She did not answer.  
</p><p>"You don't mind?"  
</p><p>Still she did not answer.  
</p><p>"Do you?" he asked.  
</p><p>"You know whether I mind or not."  
</p><p>"I don't see why you should.  I have plenty of meals there."  
</p><p>"You do."  
</p><p>"Then why do you begrudge them tea?"  
</p><p>"I begrudge whom tea?"  
</p><p>"What are you so horrid for?"  
</p><p>"Oh, say no more! You've asked her to tea, it's quite sufficient.   
She'll come."  
</p><p>He was very angry with his mother.  He knew it was merely  
Miriam she objected to.  He flung off his boots and went to bed.  
</p><p>Paul went to meet his friends the next afternoon.  He was glad  
to see them coming.  They arrived home at about four o'clock.   
Everywhere was clean and still for Sunday afternoon.  Mrs. Morel  
sat in her black dress and black apron.  She rose to meet the  
visitors.  With Edgar she was cordial, but with Miriam cold and  
rather grudging.  Yet Paul thought the girl looked so nice in her  
brown cashmere frock.  
</p><p>He helped his mother to get the tea ready.  Miriam would have  
gladly proffered, but was afraid.  He was rather proud of his home.   
There was about it now, he thought, a certain distinction.  The  
chairs were only wooden, and the sofa was old.  But the hearthrug  
and cushions were cosy; the pictures were prints in good taste;  
  
  
<pb n="202"/>   
  
there was a simplicity in everything, and plenty of books.  He was  
never ashamed in the least of his home, nor was Miriam of hers,  
because both were what they should be, and warm.  And then he  
was proud of the table; the china was pretty, the cloth was fine.   
It did not matter that the spoons were not silver nor the knives  
ivory-handled; everything looked nice.  Mrs. Morel had managed  
wonderfully while her children were growing up, so that nothing  
was out of place.  
</p><p>Miriam talked books a little.  That was her unfailing topic.  But  
Mrs. Morel was not cordial, and turned soon to Edgar.  
</p><p>At first Edgar and Miriam used to go into Mrs. Morel's pew.   
Morel never went to chapel, preferring the public-house.  Mrs.  
Morel, like a little champion, sat at the head of her pew, Paul  
at the other end; and at first Miriam sat next to him.  Then  
the chapel was like home.  It was a pretty place, with dark pews  
and slim, elegant pillars, and flowers.  And the same people had  
sat in the same places ever since he was a boy.  It was wonderfully  
sweet and soothing to sit there for an hour and a half, next to  
Miriam, and near to his mother, uniting his two loves under the  
spell of the place of worship.  Then he felt warm and happy and  
religious at once.  And after chapel he walked home with Miriam,  
whilst Mrs. Morel spent the rest of the evening with her old friend,  
Mrs. Burns.  He was keenly alive on his walks on Sunday nights  
with Edgar and Miriam.  He never went past the pits at night, by  
the lighted lamp-house, the tau black head-stocks and lines of  
trucks, past the fans spinning slowly like shadows, without the  
feeling of Miriam returning to him, keen and almost unbearable.  
</p><p>She did not very long occupy the Morels' pew.  Her father took  
one for themselves once more.  It was under the little gallery, opposite   
the Morels'.  When Paul and his mother came in the chapel  
the Leivers's pew was always empty.  He was anxious for fear she  
would not come: it was so far, and there were so many rainy Sundays.    
Then, often very late indeed, she came in, with her long  
stride, her head bowed, her face hidden under her bat of dark  
green velvet.  Her face, as she sat opposite, was always in shadow.   
But it gave him a very keen feeling, as if all his soul stirred within  
him, to see her there.  It was not the same glow, happiness, and  
pride, that he felt in having his mother in charge: something more  
  
  
<pb n="203"/>   
wonderful, less human, and tinged to intensity by a pain, as if there  
were something he could not get to.  
</p><p>At this time he was beginning to question the orthodox creed.   
He was twenty-one, and she was twenty.  She was beginning to  
dread the spring: he became so wild, and hurt her so much.  All  
the way be went cruelly smashing her beliefs.  Edgar enjoyed it.   
He was by nature critical and rather dispassionate.  But Miriam  
suffered exquisite pain, as, with an intellect like a knife, the man  
she loved examined her religion in which she lived and moved  
and had her being.  But he did not spare her.  He was cruel.  And  
when they went alone he was even more fierce, as if he would kill  
her soul.  He bled her beliefs till she almost lost consciousness.  
</p><p>"She exults &mdash; she exults as she carries him off from me," Mrs.  
Morel cried in her heart when Paul had gone.  "She's not like an  
ordinary woman, who can leave me my share in him.  She wants to  
absorb him.  She wants to draw him out and absorb him till there  
is nothing left of him, even for himself.  He will never be a man on  
his own feet &mdash; she will suck him up." So the mother sat, and battled  
and brooded bitterly.  
</p><p>And he, coming home from his walks with Miriam, was wild  
with torture.  He walked biting his lips and with clenched fists,   
going at a great rate.  Then, brought up against a stile, he stood for  
some minutes, and did not move.  There was a great hollow of  
darkness fronting him, and on the black upslopes patches of tiny  
lights, and in the lowest trough of the night, a flare of the pit.  It  
was all weird and dreadful.  Why was he torn so, almost bewildered,  
and unable to move? Why did his mother sit at home and suffer?  
He knew she suffered badly.  But whby should she? And why did  
he hate Miriam, and feel so cruel towards her, at the thought of his  
mother.  If Miriam caused bis mother suffering, then he hated her  
&mdash; and he easily hated her.  Why did she make him feel as if he  
were uncertain of himself, insecure, an indefinite thing, as if he had  
not sufficient sheathing to prevent the night and the space breaking   
into him? How he hated her! And then, what a rush of tenderness   
and humility!  
</p><p>Suddenly he plunged on again, running home.  His mother saw  
on him the marks of some agony, and she said nothing.  But he had  
to make her talk to him.  Then she was angry with him for going so  
far with Miriam.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="204"/>   
  
<p>"Why don't you like her, mother?" he cried in despair.  
</p><p>"I don't know, my boy," she replied piteously.  "I'm sure I've  
tried to like her.  I've tried and tried, but I can't &mdash; I can't!"  
</p><p>And he felt dreary and hopeless between the two.  
</p><p>Spring was the worst time.  He was changeable, and intense and  
cruel.  So he decided to stay away from her.  Then came the hours  
when he knew Miriam was expecting him.  His mother watched him  
growing restless.  He could not go on with his work.  He could do  
nothing.  It was as if something were drawing his soul out towards  
Willey Farm.  Then he put on his hat and went, saying nothing.   
And his mother knew he was gone.  And as soon as he was on the  
way he sighed with relief.  And when he was with her he was cruel  
again.  
</p><p>One day in March he lay on the bank of Nethermere, with  
Miriam sitting beside him.  It was a glistening, white-and-blue day.   
Big clouds, so brilliant, went by overhead, while shadows stole  
along on the water.  The clear spaces in the sky were of clean, cold  
blue.  Paul lay on his back in the old grass, looking up.  He could  
not bear to look at Miriam.  She seemed to want him, and he resisted.    
He resisted all the time.  He wanted now to give her passion  
and tenderness, and he could not.  He felt that she wanted the soul  
out of his body, and not him.  All his strength and energy she drew  
into herself through some channel which united them.  She did not  
want to meet him, so that there were two of them, man and woman  
together.  She wanted to draw all of him into ber.  It urged him to  
an intensity like madness, which fascinated him, as drug-taking  
might.  
</p><p>He was discussing Michael Angelo.  It felt to her as if she were  
fingering the very quivering tissue, the very protoplasm of life, as  
she heard him.  It gave her deepest satisfaction.  And in the end it  
frightened her.  There he lay in the white intensity of his search,  
and his voice gradually filled her with fear, so level it was, almost  
inhuman, as if in a trance.  
</p><p>"Don't talk any more," she pleaded softly, laying her hand on  
his forehead.  
</p><p>He lay quite still, almost unable to move.  His body was somewhere   
discarded.  
</p><p>"Why not? Are you tired?"  
</p><p>"Yes, and it wears you out."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="205"/>   
<p>He laughed shortly, realising.  
</p><p>"Yet you always make me like it," he said.  
</p><p>"I don't wish to," she said, very low.  
</p><p>"Not when you've gone too far, and you feel you can't bear it.   
But your unconscious self always asks it of me.  And I suppose I  
want it."  
</p><p>He went on, in his dead fashion:  
</p><p>"If only you could want me, and not want what I can reel off  
for you! "  
  
</p><p>"I!" she cried bitterly &mdash; "I! Why, when would you let me take  
you?"  
</p><p>"Then it's my fault," he said, and, gathering himself together,  
be got up and began to talk trivialities.  He felt insubstantial.  In a  
vague way he hated her for it.  And he knew he was as much to  
blame himself.  This, however, did not prevent his hating her.  
</p><p>One evening about this time he had walked along the home road  
with her.  They stood by the pasture leading down to the wood,  
unable to part.  As the stars came out the clouds closed.  They had  
glimpses of their own constellation, Orion, towards the west.  His  
jewels glimmered for a moment, his dog ran low, struggling with  
difficulty through the spume of cloud.  
</p><p>Orion was for them chief in significance among the constellations.    
They had gazed at him in their strange, surcharged hours  
of feeling, until they seemed themselves to live in every one of  
his stars.  This evening Paul had been moody and perverse.  Orion  
had seemed just an ordinary constellation to him.  He had fought  
against his glamour and fascination.  Miriam was watching her  
lover's mood carefully.  But he said nothing that gave him away,  
till the moment came to part, when he stood frowning gloomily  
at the gathered clouds, behind which the great constellation must  
be striding still.  
</p><p>There was to be a little party at his house the next day, at which  
she was to attend.  
</p><p>"I shan't come and meet you," he said.  
</p><p>"Oh, very well; it's not very nice out," she replied slowly.  
</p><p>"It's not that &mdash; only they don't like me to.  They say I care more  
for you than for them.  And you understand, don't you? You know  
it's only friendship."  
</p><p>Miriam was astonished and hurt for him.  It had cost him an effort.  
  
  
<pb n="206"/>   
  
She left him, wanting to spare him any further humiliation.   
A fine rain blew in her face as she walked along the road.  She was  
hurt deep down; and she despised him for being blown about by  
any wind of authority.  And in her heart of hearts, unconsciously,  
she felt that he was trying to get away from ber.  This she would  
never have acknowledged.  She pitied him.  
</p><p>At this time Paul became an important factor in Jordan's   
warehouse.  Mr. Pappleworth left to set up a business of his own, and  
Paul remained with Mr. Jordan as Spiral overseer.  His wages were  
to be raised to thirty shillings at the year-end, if things went well.  
</p><p>Still on Friday night Miriam often came down for her French  
lesson.  Paul did not go so frequently to Willey Farm, and she  
grieved at the thought of her education's coming to end; moreover,  
they both loved to be together, in spite of discords.  So they read  
Balzac, and did compositions, and felt highly cultured.  
</p><p>Friday night was reckoning night for the miners.  Morel  
"reckoned" &mdash; shared up the money of the stall &mdash; either in the New  
Inn at Bretty or in his own house, according as his fellow-butties  
wished.  Barker had turned a non-drinker, so now the men  
reckoned at Morel's house.  
</p><p>Annie, who had been teaching away, was at home again.  She  
was still a tomboy; and she was engaged to be married.  Paul was  
studying design.  
</p><p>Morel was always in good spirits on Friday evening, unless the  
week's earnings were small.  He bustled immediately after his dinner,   
prepared to get washed.  It was decorum for the women to  
absent themselves while the men reckoned.  Women were not supposed   
to spy into such a masculine privacy as the butties' reckoning, nor   
were they to know the exact amount of the week's  
earnings.  So, whilst her father was spluttering in the scullery,  
Annie went out to spend an hour with a neighbour.  Mrs. Morel  
attended to her baking.  
</p><p>"Shut that doo-er!" bawled Morel furiously.  
</p><p>Annie banged it behind her, and was gone.  
</p><p>"If tha oppens it again while I'm weshin' me, Ill ma'e thy jaw  
rattle," he threatened from the midst of his soap-suds.  Paul and  
the mother frowned to hear him.  
</p><p>Presently he came running out of the scullery, with the soapy  
water dripping from him, dithering with cold.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="207"/>   
<p>"Oh, my sirs!" he said.  "Wheer's my towel?"  
</p><p>It was hung on a chair to warm before the fire, otherwise he  
would have bullied and blustered.  He squatted on his heels before  
the hot baking-fire to dry himself.  
</p><p>"F-ff-f!" he went, pretending to shudder with cold.  
</p><p>"Goodness, man, don't be such a kid!" said Mrs. Morel.  "It's  
not cold."  
</p><p>"Thee strip thysen stark nak'd to wesh thy flesh i' that scullery,"  
said the miner, as he rubbed his hair; "nowt b'r a ice-'ouse!"  
</p><p>"And I shouldn't make that fuss," replied his wife.  
</p><p>"No, tha'd drop down stiff, as dead as a door-knob, wi' thy  
nesh sides."  
</p><p>"Why is a door-knob deader than anything else?" asked Paul,  
curious.  
</p><p>"Eh, I dunno; that's what they say," replied his father.  "But  
there's that much draught i' yon scullery, as it blows through your  
ribs like through a five-barred gate."  
</p><p>"It would have some difficulty in blowing through yours," said  
Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>Morel looked down ruefully at his sides.  
</p><p>"Me!" he exclaimed.  "I'm nowt b'r a skinned rabbit.  My bones  
fair juts out on me."  
</p><p>"I should like to know where," retorted his wife.  
</p><p>"Iv'ry-wheer! I'm nobbut a sack o' faggots."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel laughed.  He had still a wonderfully young body,  
muscular, without any fat.  His skin was smooth and clear.  It might  
have been the body of a man of twenty-eight, except that there  
were, perhaps, too many blue scars, like tattoo-marks, where the  
coal-dust remained under the skin, and that his chest was too hairy.   
But he put his hand on his side ruefully.  It was his fixed belief  
that, because be did not get fat, he was as thin as a starved rat.  
Paul looked at  his  father's  thick,  brownish  hands  all  scarred,  
with broken nails, rubbing the fine smoothness of his sides, and  
the incongruity struck him.  It seemed strange they were the same  
flesh.  
</p><p>"I suppose," he said to his father, "you had a good figure once."  
</p><p>"Eh!" exclaimed the miner, glancing round, startled and timid,  
like a child.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="208"/>   
  
<p>"He had," exclaimed Mrs. Morel, "if he didn't hurtle himself  
up as if be was trying to get in the smallest space he could."  
</p><p>"Me!" exclaimed Morel &mdash; "me a good figure! I wor niver much  
more n'r a skeleton."  
</p><p>"Man!" cried his wife, "don't be such a pulamiter!"  
</p><p>"'Strewth!" he said.  "Tha's niver knowed me but what I  
looked as if I wor goin' off in a rapid decline."  
</p><p>She sat and laughed.  
</p><p>"You've had a constitution like iron," she said; "and never a  
man bad a better start, if it was body that counted.  You should  
have seen him as a young man," she cried suddenly to Paul, drawing   
herself up to imitate her husband's once handsome bearing.  
</p><p>Morel watched her shyly.  He saw again the passion she had  
had for him.  It blazed upon her for a moment.  He was shy, rather  
scared, and humble.  Yet again he felt his old glow.  And then immediately   
he felt the ruin he had made during these years.  He  
wanted to bustle about, to run away from it.  
</p><p>"Gi'e my back a bit of a wesh," he asked her.  
</p><p>His wife brought a well-soaped flannel and clapped it on his  
shoulders.  He gave a jump.  
</p><p>"Eh, tha mucky little 'ussy!" he cried.  "Cowd as death!"  
</p><p>"You ought to have been a salamander," she laughed, washing  
his back.  It was very rarely she would do anything so personal for  
him.  The children did those things.  
</p><p>"The next world won't be half hot enough for you," she added.  
</p><p>"No," he said; "tha'lt see as it's draughty for me."  
</p><p>But she had finished.  She wiped him in a desultory fashion, and  
went upstairs, returning immediately with his shifting-trousers.   
When he was dried he struggled into his shirt.  Then, ruddy and  
shiny, with hair on end, and his flannelette shirt hanging over his  
pit-trousers, he stood warming the garments he was going to put  
on. He turned them, he pulled them inside out, he scorched them.  
</p><p>"Goodness, man!" cried Mrs. Morel, "get dressed!"  
</p><p>"Should thee like to clap thysen into britches as cowd as a tub  
o' water?" he said.  
</p><p>At last he took off his pit-trousers and donned decent black.   
He did all this on the hearth-rug, as he would have done if Annie  
and ber familiar friends had been present.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel turned the bread in the oven.  Then from the red  
  
  
<pb n="209"/>   
  
earthenware panchion of dough that stood in a comer she took  
another handful of paste, worked it to the proper shape, and  
dropped it into a tin.  As she was doing so Barker knocked and  
entered.  He was a quiet, compact little man, who looked as if he  
would go through a stone wall.  His black hair was cropped short,  
his head was bony.  Like most miners, he was pale, but healthy and  
taut.  
</p><p>"Evenin', missis," he nodded to Mrs. Morel, and he seated   
himself with a sigh.  
</p><p>"Good-evening," she replied cordially.  
</p><p>"Tha's made thy heels crack," said Morel.  
</p><p>"I dunno as I have," said Barker.  
</p><p>He sat, as the men always did in Morel's kitchen, effacing   
himself rather.  
</p><p>"How's missis?" she asked of him.  
</p><p>He had told her some time back:  
</p><p>"We're expectin' us third just now, you see."  
</p><p>"Well," he answered, rubbing his head, "she keeps pretty  
middlin', I think."  
</p><p>"Let's see &mdash; when?" asked Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"Well, I shouldn't be surprised any time now."  
</p><p>"Ah! And she's kept fairly?"  
</p><p>"Yes, tidy."  
</p><p>"That's a blessing, for she's none too strong."  
</p><p>"No.  An' I've done another silly trick."  
</p><p>"What's that?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel knew Barker wouldn't do anything very silly.  
</p><p>"I'm come be-out th' market-bag."  
</p><p>"You can have mine."  
</p><p>"Nay, you'll be wantin' that yourself."  
</p><p>"I shan't.  I take a string bag always."  
</p><p>She saw the determined little collier buying in the week's  
groceries and meat on the Friday nights, and she admired him.  
"Barker's little, but he's ten times the man you are," she said to her  
husband.  
</p><p>Just then Wesson entered.  He was thin, rather frail-looking,  
with a boyish ingenuousness and a slightly foolish smile, despite his  
seven children.  But his wife was a passionate woman.  
</p><p>"I see you've kested me," he said, smiling rather vapidly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="210"/>   
  
<p>"Yes," replied Barker.  
</p><p>The newcomer took off his cap and his big woollen muffler.  His  
nose was pointed and red.  
</p><p>"I'm afraid you're cold, Mr. Wesson," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"It's a bit nippy," he replied.  
</p><p>"Then come to the fire."  
</p><p>"Nay, I s'll do where I am."  
</p><p>Both colliers sat away back.  They could not be induced to come  
on to the hearth.  The hearth is sacred to the family.  
</p><p>"Go thy ways i' th' arm-chair," cried Morel cheerily.  
</p><p>"Nay, thank yer; I'm very nicely here."  
</p><p>"Yes, come, of course," insisted Mrs.  
Morel.  
</p><p>He rose and went awkwardly.  He sat in Morel's arm-chair   
awkwardly.  It was too great a familiarity.  But the fire made him   
blissfully happy.  
</p><p>"And how's that chest of yours?" demanded Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>He smiled again, with his blue eyes rather sunny.  
</p><p>"Oh, it's very middlin'," he said.  
</p><p>"Wi' a rattle in it like a kettle-drum," said Barker shortly.  
</p><p>"T-t-t-t!" went Mrs. Morel rapidly with her tongue.  "Did you  
have that flannel singlet made?"  
</p><p>"Not yet," he smiled.  
</p><p>"Then, why didn't you?" she cried.  
</p><p>"It'll come," he smiled.  
</p><p>"Ah, an' Doomsday!" exclaimed Barker.  
</p><p>Barker and Morel were both impatient of Wesson.  But, then,  
they were both as hard as nails, physically.  
</p><p>When Morel was nearly ready he pushed the bag of money to  
Paul.  
</p><p>"Count it, boy," he asked humbly.  
</p><p>Paul impatiently turned from his books and pencil, tipped the  
bag upside down on the table.  There was a five-pound bag of silver,  
sovereigns and loose money.  He counted quickly, referred to the  
checks &mdash; the written papers giving amount of coal-put the money in  
order.  Then Barker glanced at the checks.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel went upstairs, and the three men came to table.   
Morel, as master of the house, sat in his arm-chair, with his back to  
the hot fire.  The two butties had cooler seats.  None of them counted  
the money.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="211"/>   
  
<p>"What did we say Simpson's was?" asked Morel; and the butties  
cavilled for a minute over the dayman's earnings.  Then the amount  
was put aside.  
</p><p>"An' Bill Naylor's?"  
</p><p>This money also was taken from the pack.  
</p><p>Then, because Wesson lived in one of the company's houses, and  
his rent had been deducted, Morel and Barker took four-and-six  
each.  And because Morel's coals had come, and the leading was  
stopped, Barker and Wesson took four shillings each.  Then it was  
plain sailing.  Morel gave each of them a sovereign till there were  
no more sovereigns; each half a crown till there were no more  
half-crowns; each a shilling till there were no more shillings.  If  
there was anything at the end that wouldn't split, Morel took it and  
stood drinks.  
</p><p>Then the three men rose and went.  Morel scuttled out of the  
house before his wife came down.  She heard the door close, and   
descended.  She looked hastily at the bread in the oven.  Then,   
glancing on the table, she saw her money lying.  Paul had been working  
all the time.  But now he felt his mother counting the week's money,  
and her wrath rising,  
</p><p>"T-t-t-t-t!" went her tongue.  
</p><p>He frowned.  He could not work when she was cross.  She counted  
again.  
</p><p>"A measly twenty-five shillings!" she exclaimed.  "How much  
was the cheque?"  
</p><p>"Ten pounds eleven," said Paul irritably.  He dreaded what was  
coming.  
</p><p>"And he gives me a scrattlin' twenty-five, an' his club this week!  
But I know him.  He thinks because you're earning he needn't keep  
the house any longer.  No, all he has to do with his money is to   
guttle it.  But I'll show him!"  
</p><p>"Oh, mother, don't!" cried Paul.  
</p><p>"Don't what, I should like to know?" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"Don't carry on again.  I can't work."  
</p><p>She went very quiet.  
</p><p>"Yes, it's all very well," she said; "but how do you think I'm   
going to manage?"  
</p><p>"Well, it won't make it any better to whittle about it."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="212"/>   
  
<p>"I should like to know what you'd do if you had it to put up  
with."  
</p><p>"It won't be long.  You can have my money.  Let him go to hell."  
</p><p>He went back to his work, and she tied her bonnet-strings grimly.   
When she was fretted he could not bear it.  But now he began to insist   
on her recognizing him.  
</p><p>"The two loaves at the top," she said, "will be done in twenty  
minutes.  Don't forget them."  
</p><p>"All right," he answered; and she went to market.  
</p><p>He remained alone working.  But his usual intense concentration  
became unsettled.  He listened for the yard-gate.  At a quarter-past  
seven came a low knock, and Miriam entered.  
</p><p>"All alone?" she said.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>As if at home, she took off her tam-o'-shanter and her long coat,  
hanging them up.  It gave him a thrill.  This might be their own  
house, his and hers.  Then she came back and peered over his work.  
</p><p>"What is it?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Still  
design, for decorating stuffs, and for embroidery."  
</p><p>She bent short-sightedly over the drawings.  
</p><p>It irritated him that she peered so into everything that was his,  
searching him out.  He went into the parlour and returned with a  
bundle of brownish linen.  Carefully unfolding it, he spread it on  
the floor.  It proved to be a curtain or portiere, beautifully stencilled  
with a design on roses.  
</p><p>"Ah, how beautiful!" she cried.  
</p><p>The spread cloth, with its wonderful reddish roses and dark green  
stems, all so simple, and somehow so wicked-looking, lay at ber  
feet.  She went on her knees before it, her dark curls dropping.  He  
saw her crouched voluptuously before his work, and his heart beat  
quickly.  Suddenly she looked up at him.  
</p><p>"Why does it seem cruel?" she asked.  
</p><p>"What?"  
</p><p>"There seems a feeling of cruelty about it," she said.  
</p><p>"It's jolly good, whether or not," he replied, folding up his work  
with a lover's hands.  
</p><p>She rose slowly, pondering.  
</p><p>"And what will you do with it?" she asked.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="213"/>   
<p>"Send it to Liberty's.  I did it for my mother, but I think she'd  
rather have the money."  
</p><p>"Yes," said Miriam.  He had spoken with a touch of bitterness,  
and Miriam sympathised.  Money would have been nothing to her.  
</p><p>He took the cloth back into the parlour.  When he returned he  
threw to Miriam a smaller piece.  It was a cushion-cover with the  
same design.  
</p><p>"I did that for you," he said.  
</p><p>She fingered the work with trembling hands, and did not speak.   
He became embarrassed.  
</p><p>"By Jove, the bread!" he cried.  
</p><p>He took the top loaves out, tapped them vigorously.  They were  
done.  He put them on the hearth to cool.  Then he went to the scullery,   
wetted his hands, scooped the last white dough out of the  
panchion, and dropped it in a baking-tin.  Miriam was still bent  
over her painted cloth.  He stood rubbing the bits of dough from  
his hands.  
</p><p>"You do like it?" he asked.  
</p><p>She looked up at him, with her dark eyes one flame of love.  He  
laughed uncomfortably.  Then he began to talk about the design.   
There was for him the most intense pleasure in talking about his  
work to Miriam.  All his passion, all his wild blood, went into this  
intercourse with her, when he talked and conceived his work. She  
brought forth to him his imaginations.  She did not understand, any  
more than a woman understands when she conceives a child in her  
womb.  But this was life for her and for him.  
</p><p>While they were talking, a young woman of about twenty-two,  
small and pale, hollow-eyed, yet with a relentless look about her,  
entered the room.  She was a friend at the Morel's.  
</p><p>"Take your things off," said Paul.  
</p><p>"No, I'm not stopping."  
</p><p>She sat down in the arm-chair opposite Paul and Miriam, who  
were on the sofa.  Miriam moved a little farther from him.  The room  
was hot, with a scent of new bread.  Brown, crisp loaves stood on  
the hearth.  
</p><p>"I shouldn't have expected to see you here to-night, Miriam  
Leivers," said Beatrice wickedly.  
</p><p>"Why not?" murmured Miriam huskily.  
</p><p>"Why, let's look at your shoes."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="214"/>   
  
<p>Miriam remained uncomfortably still.  
</p><p>"If tha doesna tha durs'na," laughed Beatrice.  
</p><p>Miriam put her feet from under her dress.  Her boots had that  
queer, irresolute, rather pathetic look about them, which showed  
how self-conscious and self-mistrustful she was.  And they were  
covered with mud.  
</p><p>"Glory! You're a positive muck-heap," exclaimed Beatrice.   
"Who cleans your boots?"  
</p><p>"I clean them myself."  
</p><p>"Then you wanted a job," said Beatrice.  "It would ha' taken a  
lot of men to ha' brought me down here to-night.  But love laughs  
at sludge, doesn't it, 'Postle my duck?"  
</p><p>"Inter alia," he said.  
</p><p>"Oh, Lord! are you going to spout foreign languages? What does  
it mean, Miriam?"  
</p><p>There was a fine sarcasm in the last question, but Miriam did  
not see it.  
</p><p>"'Among other things,' I believe," she said humbly.  
</p><p>Beatrice put her tongue between her teeth and laughed wickedly.  
</p><p>"'Among other things,' 'Postle?" she repeated.  "Do you mean  
love laughs at mothers, and fathers, and sisters, and brothers, and  
men friends, and lady friends, and even at the b'loved himself?"  
</p><p>She affected a great innocence.  
</p><p>"In fact, it's one big smile," he replied.  
</p><p>"Up its sleeve, 'Postle Morel &mdash; you believe me," she said; and  
she went off into another burst of wicked, silent laughter.  
</p><p>Miriam sat silent, withdrawn into herself.  Every one of Paul's  
friends delighted in taking sides against her, and he left her in the  
lurch &mdash; seemed almost to have a sort of revenge upon her then.  
</p><p>"Are you still at school?" asked Miriam of Beatrice.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"You've not had your notice, then?"  
</p><p>"I expect it at Easter."  
</p><p>"Isn't it an awful shame, to turn you off merely because you  
didn't pass the exam.?"  
</p><p>"I don't know,"  said  Beatrice  coldly.  
</p><p>"Agatha says you're as good as any teacher anywhere.  It seems  
to me ridiculous.  I wonder why you didn't pass."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="215"/>   
<p>"Short of brains, eh, 'Postle?" said Beatrice briefly.  
</p><p>"Only brains to bite with," replied Paul, laughing.  
</p><p>"Nuisance!" she cried; and, springing from her seat, she rushed  
and boxed his ears.  She had beautiful small hands.  He held her  
wrists while she wrestled with him.  At last she broke free, and  
seized two handfuls of his thick, dark brown hair, which she shook.  
</p><p>"Beat!" he said, as he pulled his hair straight with his fingers.  "I  
hate you!"  
</p><p>She laughed with glee.  
</p><p>"Mind!" she said.  "I want to sit next to you."  
</p><p>"I'd as lief be neighbours with a vixen," he said, nevertheless  
making place for her between him and Miriam.  
</p><p>"Did it ruffle his pretty hair, then!" she cried; and, with her hair-comb, she combed him straight.  "And his nice little moustache!"  
she exclaimed.  She tilted his head back and combed his young  
moustache.  "It's a wicked moustache, 'Postle," she said.  "It's a red  
for danger.  Have you got any of those cigarettes?"  
</p><p>He pulled his cigarette-case from his pocket.  Beatrice looked   
inside it.  
</p><p>"And fancy me having Connie's last cig.," said Beatrice, putting  
the thing between her teeth.  He held a lit match to her, and she  
puffed daintily.  
</p><p>"Thanks so much, darling," she said mockingly.  
</p><p>It gave her a wicked delight.  
</p><p>"Don't you think he does it nicely, Miriam?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Oh, very!" said Miriam.  
</p><p>He took a cigarette for himself.  
</p><p>"Light, old boy?" said Beatrice, tilting her cigarette at him.  
</p><p>He bent forward to her to light his cigarette at hers.  She was  
winking at him as he did so.  Miriam saw his eyes trembling with  
mischief, and his full, almost sensual, mouth quivering.  He was  
not himself, and she could not bear it.  As he was now, she had no  
connection with him; she might as well not have existed.  She saw  
the cigarette dancing on his full red lips.  She hated his thick hair  
for being tumbled loose on his forehead.  
</p><p>"Sweet boy!" said Beatrice, tipping up his chin and giving him a  
little kiss on the cheek.  
</p><p>"I s'll kiss thee back, Beat," he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="216"/>   
  
<p>"Tha wunna!" she giggled, jumping up and going away.  "Isn't  
he shameless, Miriam?"  
</p><p>"Quite," said Miriam.  "By the way, aren't you forgetting the  
bread?"  
</p><p>"By Jove!" he cried, flinging open the oven door.  
</p><p>Out puffed the bluish smoke and a smell of burned bread.  
</p><p>"Oh, golly!" cried Beatrice, coming to his side.  He crouched   
before the oven, she peered over his shoulder.  "This is what comes of  
the oblivion of love, my boy."  
</p><p>Paul was ruefully removing the loaves.  One was burnt black on  
the hot side; another was hard as a brick.  
</p><p>"Poor mater!" said Paul.  
</p><p>"You want to grate it," said Beatrice.  "Fetch me the nutmeg-grater."  
</p><p>She arranged the bread in the oven.  He brought the grater, and  
she grated the bread on to a newspaper on the table.  He set the  
doors open to blow away the smell of burned bread.  Beatrice  
grated away, puffing her cigarette, knocking the charcoal off the  
poor loaf.  
</p><p>"My word, Miriam! you're in for it this time," said Beatrice.  
</p><p>"I!" exclaimed Miriam in amazement.  
</p><p>"You'd better be gone when his mother comes in.  I know why  
King Alfred burned the cakes.  Now I see it! 'Postle would fix up a  
tale about his work making him forget, if he thought it would wash.   
If that old woman had come in a bit sooner, she'd have boxed the  
brazen thing's ears who made the oblivion, instead of poor Alfred's."  
</p><p>She giggled as she scraped the loaf.  Even Miriam laughed in  
spite of herself.  Paul mended the fire ruefully.  
</p><p>The garden gate was heard to bang.  
</p><p>"Quick!" cried Beatrice, giving Paul the scraped loaf.  "Wrap it  
up in a damp towel."  
</p><p>Paul disappeared into the scullery.  Beatrice hastily blew her  
scrapings into the fire, and sat down innocently.  Annie came bursting   
in.  She was an abrupt, quite smart young woman.  She  
blinked in the strong light.  
</p><p>"Smell of burning!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"It's the cigarettes," replied Beatrice demurely.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="217"/>   
  
<p>"Where's Paul?"  
</p><p>Leonard had followed Annie.  He had a long comic face and blue  
eyes, very sad.  
</p><p>"I suppose he's left you to settle it between you," he said.  He  
nodded sympathetically to Miriam, and became gently sarcastic to  
Beatrice.  
</p><p>"No," said Beatrice, "he's gone off with number nine."  
</p><p>"I just met number five inquiring for him," said Leonard.   
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; we're going to share him up like Solomon's baby," said  
Beatrice.  
</p><p>Annie laughed.  
</p><p>"Oh, ay," said Leonard.  "And which bit should you have?"  
</p><p>"I don't know," said Beatrice.  "I'll let all the others pick first."  
</p><p>"An' you'd have the leavings, like?" said Leonard, twisting up  
a comic face.  
</p><p>Annie was looking in the oven.  Miriam sat ignored.  Paul entered.  
</p><p>"This bread's a fine sight, our Paul," said Annie.  
</p><p>"Then you should stop an' look after it," said Paul.  
</p><p>"You mean you should do what you're reckoning to do," replied  
Annie.  
</p><p>"He should, shouldn't he!" cried Beatrice.  
</p><p>"I s'd think he'd got plenty on hand," said Leonard.  
</p><p>"You had a nasty walk, didn't you, Miriam?" said Annie.  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; but I'd been in all week &mdash; "  
</p><p>"And you wanted a bit of a change, like," insinuated Leonard  
kindly.  
</p><p>"Well, you can't be stuck in the house for ever," Annie agreed.   
She was quite amiable.  Beatrice pulled on her coat, and went out  
with Leonard and Annie.  She would meet her own boy.  
</p><p>"Don't forget that bread, our Paul," cried Annie.  "Good-night,  
Miriam.  I don't think it win rain."  
</p><p>When they had all gone, Paul fetched the swathed loaf, unwrapped   
it, and surveyed it sadly.  
</p><p>"It's a mess!" he said.  
</p><p>"But," answered Miriam impatiently, "what is it, after all &mdash;   
twopence, ha'penny."  
</p><p>"Yes, but &mdash; it's the mater's precious baking, and she'll take it to  
heart.  However, it's no good bothering."</p>  
  
<pb n="218"/>   
  
<p>He took the loaf back into the scullery.  There was a little distance  
between him and Miriam.  He stood balanced opposite her for some  
moments considering, thinking of his behaviour with Beatrice.  He  
felt guilty inside himself, and yet glad.  For some inscrutable reason  
it served Miriam right.  He was not going to repent.  She wondered  
what he was thinking of as he stood suspended.  His thick hair was  
tumbled over his forehead.  Why might she not push it back for  
him, and remove the marks of Beatrice's comb? Why might she not  
press his body with her two hands.  It looked so firm, and every whit  
living.  And he would let other girls, why not her?  
</p><p>Suddenly he started into life.  It made her quiver almost with  
terror as he quickly pushed the hair off bis forehead and came towards her.  
</p><p>"Half-past eight!" he said.  "We'd better buck up.  Where's your  
French?"  
</p><p>Miriam shyly and rather bitterly produced her exercise-book.   
Every week she wrote for him a sort of diary of her inner life, in  
ber own French.  He had found this was the only way to get her to  
do compositions.  And her diary was mostly a love-letter.  He would  
read it now; she felt as if her soul's history were going to be   
desecrated by him in his present mood.  He sat beside her.  She watched  
his hand, firm and warm, rigorously scoring her work.  He was  
reading only the French, ignoring her soul that was there.  But  
gradually his hand forgot its work.  He read in silence, motionless.   
She quivered.  
</p><p>"'Ce matin les oiseaux m'ont eveille,'" he read.  "Il faisait   
encore un crepuscule.  Mais la petite fenetre de ma chambre etait  
bleme, et puis, jaune, et tous les oiseaux du bois eclaterent dans un  
chanson vif et resonnant.  Toute l'aube tressaillit.  J'avais reve de  
vous.  Est-ce que vous voyez aussi l'aube? Les oiseaux m'eveillent  
presque tous les matins, et toujours il y a quelque chose de terreur  
dans le cri des grives.  Il est si clair &mdash; '"  
</p><p>Miriam sat tremulous, half ashamed.  He remained quite still,  
trying to understand.  He only knew she loved him.  He was afraid  
of her love for him.  It was too good for him, and he was inadequate.    
His own love was at fault, not hers.  Ashamed, he  
corrected her work, humbly writing above her words.  
</p><p>"Look," he said quietly, "the past participle conjugated with  
avoir agrees with the direct object when it precedes."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="219"/>   
  
<p>She bent forward, trying to see and to understand.  Her free, fine  
curls tickled his face.  He started as if they had been red hot,   
shuddering.  He saw her peering forward at the page, her red lips parted  
piteously, the black hair springing in fine strands across ber tawny,  
ruddy cheek.  She was coloured like a pomegranate for richness.  His  
breath came short as be watched her.  Suddenly she looked up at  
him.  Her dark eyes were naked with their love, afraid, and yearning.    
His eyes, too, were dark, and they hurt her.  They seemed to  
master her.  She lost all her self-control, was exposed in fear.  And  
he knew, before he could kiss her, he must drive something out of  
himself.  And a touch of hate for her crept back again into his heart.   
He returned to her exercise.  
</p><p>Suddenly he flung down the pencil, and was at the oven in a leap,  
turning the bread.  For Miriam he was too quick.  She started   
violently, and it hurt her with real pain.  Even the way he crouched  
before the oven hurt ber.  There seemed to be something cruel in it,  
something cruel in the swift way he pitched the bread out of the  
tins, caught it up again.  If only he had been gentle in  
his movements she would have felt so rich and warm.  As it was,  
she was hurt.  
</p><p>He returned and finished the exercise.  
</p><p>"You've done well this week," he said.  
</p><p>She saw he was flattered by her diary.  It did not repay her   
entirely.  
</p><p>"You really do blossom out sometimes," he said.  "You ought to  
write poetry."  
</p><p>She lifted her head with joy, then she shook it mistrustfully.  
</p><p>"I don't trust myself," she said.  
</p><p>"You should try!"  
</p><p>Again she shook her head.  
</p><p>"Shall we read, or is it too late?" he asked.  
</p><p>"It is late &mdash; but we can read just a little," she pleaded.  
</p><p>She was really getting now the food for her life during the next  
week.  He made her copy Baudelaire's "Le Balcon".  Then he read  
it for her.  His voice was soft and caressing, but growing almost  
brutal.  He had a way of lifting his lips and showing his teeth,   
passionately and bitterly, when he was much moved.  This he did now.   
It made Miriam feel as if he were trampling on her.  She dared not  
look at him, but sat with her head bowed.  She could not understand  
  
  
<pb n="220"/>   
  
why he got into such a tumult and fury.  It made her wretched.  She  
did not like Baudelaire, on the whole &mdash; nor Verlaine.</p>  
  
<l>          "Behold her singing in the field</l>  
<l>           Yon solitary highland lass."</l>  
  
<p>That nourished her heart.  So did "Fair Ines".  And &mdash;  
</p>  
<l>          "It was a beauteous evening, calm and pure,</l>  
<l>           And breathing holy quiet like a nun."</l> 
  
<p>These were like herself.  And there was he, saying in his throat  
bitterly:  
 </p> 
<l>       "Tu te rappelleras la beaute des caresses."</l> 
  
<p>The poem was finished; he took the bread out of the oven,   
arranging the burnt loaves at the bottom of the panchion, the good  
ones at the top.  The desiccated loaf remained swathed up in the  
scullery.  
</p><p>"Mater needn't know till morning," he said.  "It won't upset her  
so much then as at night."  
</p><p>Miriam looked in the bookcase, saw what postcards and letters  
he had received, saw what books were there.  She took one that had  
interested him.  Then he turned down the gas and they set off.  He  
did not trouble to lock the door.  
</p><p>He was not home again until a quarter to eleven.  His mother  
was seated in the rocking-chair.  Annie, with a rope of hair hanging  
down her back, remained sitting on a low stool before the fire, her  
elbows on her knees, gloomily.  On the table stood the offending  
loaf unswathed.  Paul entered rather breathless.  No one spoke.  His  
mother was reading the little local newspaper.  He took off his coat,  
and went to sit down on the sofa.  His mother moved curtly aside  
to let him pass.  No one spoke.  He was very uncomfortable.  For  
some minutes he sat pretending to read a piece of paper he found  
on the table.  Then &mdash;  
</p><p>"I forgot that bread, mother," he said.  
</p><p>There was no answer from either woman.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "it's only twopence ha'penny.  I can pay you for  
that."</p>  
  
  
  
  
  
<pb n="221"/>   
  
<p>Being angry, he put three pennies on the table and slid them towards   
his mother.  She turned away her head.  Her mouth was shut tightly.  
</p><p>"Yes," said Annie, "you don't know how badly my mother is!"  
</p><p>The girl sat staring glumly into the fire.  
</p><p>"Why is she badly?" asked Paul, in his overbearing way.  
</p><p>"Well!" said Annie.  "She could scarcely get home."  
</p><p>He looked closely at his mother.  She looked ill.  
</p><p>"Why could you scarcely get home?" he asked her, still sharply.   
She would not answer.  
</p><p>"I found her as white as a sheet sitting here," said Annie, with a  
suggestion of tears in her voice.  
</p><p>"Well, why?" insisted Paul.  His brows were knitting, his eyes  
dilating passionately.  
</p><p>"It was enough to upset anybody," said Mrs. Morel, "hugging  
those parcels &mdash; meat, and green-groceries, and a pair of  
curtains &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Well, why did you hug them; you needn't have done."  
</p><p>"Then who would?"  
</p><p>"Let Annie fetch the meat."  
</p><p>"Yes, and I would fetch the meat, but how was I to know.  You  
were off with Miriam, instead of being in when my mother came."  
</p><p>"And what was the matter with you?" asked Paul of his mother.  
</p><p>"I suppose it's my heart," she replied.  Certainly she looked   
bluish round the mouth.  
</p><p>"And have you felt it before?"  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; often enough."  
</p><p>"Then why haven't you told me? &mdash; and why haven't you seen a  
doctor?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel shifted in her chair, angry with him for his hectoring.  
</p><p>"You'd never notice anything," said Annie.  "You're too eager  
to be off with Miriam."  
</p><p>"Oh, am I &mdash; and any worse than you with Leonard?"  
</p><p>"I was in at a quarter to ten."  
</p><p>There was silence in the room for a time.  
</p><p>"I should have thought," said Mrs. Morel bitterly, "that she  
wouldn't have occupied you so entirely as to burn a whole ovenful  
of bread."  
</p><p>"Beatrice was here as well as she."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="222"/>   
  
<p>"Very likely.  But we know why the bread is spoilt."  
</p><p>"Why?" he flashed.  
</p><p>"Because you were engrossed with Miriam," replied Mrs. Morel  
hotly.  
</p><p>"Oh, very well &mdash; then it was not!" he replied angrily.  
</p><p>He was distressed and wretched.  Seizing a paper, he began  
to read.  Annie, her blouse unfastened, her long ropes of hair  
twisted into a plait, went up to bed, bidding him a very curt good-night.  
</p><p>Paul sat pretending to read.  He knew his mother wanted to   
upbraid him.  He also wanted to know what had made her ill, for he  
was troubled.  So, instead of running away to bed, as he would have  
liked to do, he sat and waited.  There was a tense silence.  The clock  
ticked loudly.  
</p><p>"You'd better go to bed before your father comes in," said the  
mother harshly.  "And if you're going to have anything to eat, you'd  
better get it."  
</p><p>"I don't want anything."  
</p><p>It was his mother's custom to bring him some trifle for supper on  
Friday night, the night of luxury for the colliers.  He was too angry  
to go and find it in the pantry this night.  This insulted her.  
</p><p>"If I wanted you to go to Selby on Friday night, I can imagine  
the scene," said Mrs. Morel.  "But you're never too tired to go if  
she will come for you.  Nay, you neither want to cat nor drink then."  
</p><p>"I can't let her go alone."  
</p><p>"Can't you? And why does she come?"  
</p><p>"Not because I ask her."  
</p><p>"She doesn't come without you want her &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Well, what if I do want her &mdash; " he replied.  
</p><p>"Why, nothing, if it was sensible or reasonable.  But to go  
trapseing up there miles and miles in the mud, coming home at  
midnight, and got to go to Nottingham in the morning &mdash; "  
</p><p>"If I hadn't, you'd be just the same."  
</p><p>"Yes, I should, because there's no sense in it.  Is she so   
fascinating that you must follow her all that way?"  Mrs. Morel was  
bitterly sarcastic.  She sat still, with averted face, stroking with a  
rhythmic, jerked movement, the black sateen of her apron.  It was  
a movement that hurt Paul to see.  
</p><p>"I do like her," he said, "but &mdash; "</p>  
  
  
<pb n="223"/>   
  
<p>"Like her!" said Mrs. Morel, in the same biting tones.  "It seems  
to me you like nothing and nobody else.  There's neither Annie, nor  
me, nor anyone now for you."  
</p><p>"What nonsense, mother &mdash; you know I don't love her &mdash; I &mdash; I tell  
you I don't love her &mdash; she doesn't even walk with my arm, because  
I don't want her to."  
</p><p>"Then why do you fly to her so often?"  
</p><p>"I do like to talk to her &mdash; I never said I didn't.  But I don't love  
her."  
</p><p>"Is there nobody else to talk to?"  
</p><p>"Not about the things we talk of.  There's a lot of things that  
you're not interested in, that &mdash; "  
</p><p>"What things?"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was so intense that Paul began to pant.  
</p><p>"Why &mdash; painting &mdash; and books.  You don't care about Herbert  
Spencer."  
</p><p>"No," was the sad reply.  "And you won't at my age."  
</p><p>"Well, but I do now &mdash; and Miriam does &mdash; "  
</p><p>"And how do you know," Mrs. Morel flashed defiantly, "that I  
shouldn't.  Do you ever try me!"  
</p><p>"But you don't, mother, you know you don't care whether a picture's   
decorative or not; you don't care what manner it is in."  
</p><p>"How do you know I don't care? Do you ever try me? Do you  
ever talk to me about these things, to try?"  
</p><p>"But it's not that that matters to you, mother, you know t's not."  
</p><p>"What is it, then &mdash; what is it, then, that matters to me?" she  
flashed.  He knitted his brows with pain.  
</p><p>"You're old, mother, and we're young."  
</p><p>He only meant that the interests of her age were not the interests  
of his.  But he realised the moment he had spoken that he had said  
the wrong thing.  
</p><p>"Yes, I know it well &mdash; I am old.  And therefore I may stand aside;  
I have nothing more to do with you.  You only want me to wait on  
you &mdash; the rest is for Miriam."  
</p><p>He could not bear it.  Instinctively he realised that he was life  
to her.  And, after all, she was the chief thing to him, the only   
supreme thing.  
</p><p>"You know it isn't, mother, you know it isn't!"  
</p><p>She was moved to pity by his cry.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="224"/>   
  
<p>"It looks a great deal like it," she said, half putting aside her  
despair.  
</p><p>"No, mother &mdash; I really don't love her.  I talk to her, but I want to  
come home to you."  
</p><p>He had taken off his collar and tie, and rose, bare-throated, to  
go to bed.  As he stooped to kiss his mother, she threw her arms  
round his neck, hid her face on his shoulder, and cried, in a whimpering   
voice, so unlike her own that he writhed in agony:  
</p><p>"I can't bear it.  I could let another woman &mdash; but not her.  She'd  
leave me no room, not a bit of room &mdash; "  
</p><p>And immediately he hated Miriam bitterly.  
</p><p>"And I've never &mdash; you know, Paul &mdash; I've never had a husband &mdash;  
not really &mdash; "  
</p><p>He stroked his mother's hair, and his mouth was on her throat.  
</p><p>"And she exults so in taking you from me &mdash; she's not like ordinary  
girls."  
</p><p>"Well, I don't love her, mother," he murmured, bowing his head  
and hiding his eyes on her shoulder in misery.  His mother kissed  
him a long, fervent kiss.  
</p><p>"My boy!" she said, in a voice trembling with passionate love.  
</p><p>Without knowing, he gently stroked her face.  
</p><p>"There," said his mother, "now go to bed.  You'll be so tired in  
the morning." As she was speaking she heard her husband coming.   
"There's your father-now go." Suddenly she looked at him almost as   
if in fear.  "Perhaps I'm selfish.  If you want her, take her,  
my boy."  
</p><p>His mother looked so strange, Paul kissed her, trembling.  
</p><p>"Ha &mdash; mother!" he said softly.  
</p><p>Morel came in, walking unevenly.  His hat was over one comer  
of his eye.  He balanced in the doorway.  
</p><p>"At your mischief again?" he said venomously.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel's emotion turned into sudden hate of the drunkard  
who had come in thus upon her.  
</p><p>"At any rate, it is sober," she said.  
</p><p>"H'm &mdash; h'm! h'm &mdash; h'm!" he sneered.  He went into the passage,  
hung up his hat and coat.  Then they heard him go down three steps  
to the pantry.  He returned with a piece of pork-pie in his fist.  It  
was what Mrs. Morel had bought for her son.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="225"/>   
  
<p>"Nor was that bought for you.  If you can give me no more than  
twenty-five shillings, I'm sure I'm not going to buy you pork-pie  
to stuff, after you've swilled a bellyful of beer."  
</p><p>"Wha-at &mdash; wha-at!" snarled Morel, toppling in his balance.   
"Wha-at &mdash; not for me?" He looked at the piece of meat and crust,  
and suddenly, in a vicious spurt of temper, flung it into the fire.  
</p><p>Paul started to his feet.  
</p><p>"Waste your own stuff!" he cried.  
</p><p>"What &mdash; what!" suddenly shouted Morel, jumping up and clenching   
his fist.  "I'll show yer, yer young jockey!"  
</p><p>"All right!" said Paul viciously, putting his head on one side.   
"Show me! "  
</p><p>He would at that moment dearly have loved to have a smack at  
something.  Morel was half crouching, fists up, ready to spring.   
The young man stood, smiling with his lips.  
</p><p>"Ussha!" hissed the father, swiping round with a great stroke  
just past his son's face.  He dared not, even though so close, really  
touch the young man, but swerved an inch away.  
</p><p>"Right!" said Paul, his eyes upon the side of his father's mouth,  
where in another instant his fist would have hit.  He ached for that  
stroke.  But he heard a faint moan from behind.  His mother was  
deadly pale and dark at the mouth.  Morel was dancing up to   
deliver another blow.  
</p><p>"Father!" said Paul, so that the word rang.  
</p><p>Morel started, and stood at attention.  
</p><p>"Mother!" moaned the boy.  "Mother!"  
</p><p>She began to struggle with herself.  Her open eyes watched him,  
although she could not move.  Gradually she was coming to herself.   
He laid her down on the sofa, and ran upstairs for a little whisky,  
which at last she could sip.  The tears were hopping down his face.   
As he kneeled in front of her he did not cry, but the tears ran down  
his face quickly.  Morel, on the opposite side of the room, sat with  
his elbows on his knees glaring across.  
</p><p>"What's a-matter with 'er?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Faint!" replied Paul.  
</p><p>"H'm!"  
</p><p>The elderly man began to unlace his boots.  He stumbled off to  
bed.  His last fight was fought in that home.  
</p><p>Paul kneeled there, stroking his mother's hand.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="226"/>   
  
<p>"Don't be poorly, mother &mdash; don't be poorly!" he said time after  
time.  
</p><p>"It's nothing, my boy," she murmured.  
</p><p>At last he rose, fetched in a large piece of coal, and raked the  
fire.  Then he cleared the room, put everything straight, laid the  
things for breakfast, and brought his mother's candle.  
</p><p>"Can you go to bed, mother?"  
</p><p>"Yes, I'll come."  
</p><p>"Sleep with Annie, mother, not with him."  
</p><p>"No.  I'll sleep in my own bed."  
</p><p>"Don't sleep with him, mother."  
</p><p>"I'll sleep in my own bed."  
</p><p>She rose, and he turned out the gas, then followed her closely   
upstairs, carrying her candle.  On the landing he kissed her close.  
</p><p>"Good-night, mother."  
</p><p>"Good-night!" she said.  
</p><p>He pressed his face upon the pillow in a fury of misery.  And yet,  
somewhere in his soul, he was at peace because he still loved his  
mother best.  It was the bitter peace of resignation.  
</p><p>The efforts of his father to conciliate him next day were a  
great humiliation to him.  
</p><p>Everybody tried to forget the scene.</p>

 <head> "Defeat of Miriam" </head> 
 
  
<p>PAUL was dissatisfied with himself and with everything.  The   
deepest of his love belonged to his mother.  When he felt he had hurt  
her, or wounded his love for her, he could not bear it.  Now it was  
spring, and there was battle between him and Miriam.  This year he  
had a good deal against her.  She was vaguely aware of it.  The old  
feeling that she was to be a sacrifice to this love, which she had had  
when she prayed, was mingled in all her emotions.  She did not at  
the bottom believe she ever would have him.  She did not believe  
in herself primarily: doubted whether she could ever be what he  
would demand of her.  Certainly she never saw herself living happily   
through a lifetime with him.  She saw tragedy, sorrow, and  
  
  
<pb n="227"/>   
sacrifice ahead.  And in sacrifice she was proud, in renunciation she  
was strong, for she did not trust herself to support everyday life.   
She was prepared for the big things and the deep things, like tragedy.    
It was the sufficiency of the small day-life she could not trust.  
</p><p>The Easter holidays began happily.  Paul was his own frank self.   
Yet she felt it would go wrong.  On the Sunday afternoon she stood  
at her bedroom window, looking across at the oak-trees of the  
wood, in whose branches a twilight was tangled, below the bright  
sky of the afternoon.  Grey-green rosettes of honeysuckle leaves  
hung before the window, some already, she fancied, showing bud.   
It was spring, which she loved and dreaded.  
</p><p>Hearing the clack of the gate she stood in suspense.  It was a  
bright grey day.  Paul came into the yard with his bicycle, which  
glittered as he walked.  Usually he rang his bell and laughed towards  
the house.  To-day he walked with shut lips and cold, cruel bearing,  
that had something of a slouch and a sneer in it.  She knew him well  
by now, and could tell from that keen-looking, aloof young body  
of his what was happening inside him.  There was a cold correctness   
in the way he put his bicycle in its place, that made her heart sink.  
</p><p>She came downstairs nervously.  She was wearing a new net  
blouse that she thought became her.  It had a high collar with a tiny  
ruff, reminding her of Mary, Queen of Scots, and making her, she  
thought, look wonderfully a woman, and dignified.  At twenty  
she was full-breasted and luxuriously formed.  Her face was  
still like a soft rich mask, unchangeable.  But her eyes, once lifted,   
were wonderful.  She was afraid of him.  He would notice her new blouse.  
</p><p>He, being in a hard, ironical mood, was entertaining the family  
to a description of a service given in the Primitive Methodist  
Chapel, conducted by one of the well-known preachers of the sect.   
He sat at the head of the table, his mobile face, with the eyes that  
could be so beautiful, shining with tenderness or dancing with  
laughter, now taking on one expression and then another, in imitation   
of various people he was mocking.  His mockery always hurt  
her; it was too near the reality.  He was too clever and cruel.  She  
felt that when his eyes were like this, hard with mocking hate, he  
would spare neither himself nor anybody else.  But Mrs. Leivers  
was wiping her eyes with laughter, and Mr. Leivers, just awake  
from his Sunday nap, was rubbing his head in amusement.  The  
  
  
<pb n="228"/>   
  
three brothers sat with ruffled, sleepy appearance in their shirt-sleeves, giving a guffaw from time to time.  The whole family loved  
a "take-off" more than anything.  
</p><p>He took no notice of Miriam.  Later, she saw him remark her  
new blouse, saw that the artist approved, but it won from him not  
a spark of warmth.  She was nervous, could hardly reach the teacups  
from the shelves.  
</p><p>When the men went out to milk, she ventured to address him  
personally.  
</p><p>"You were late," she said.  
</p><p>"Was I?" he answered.  
</p><p>There was silence for a while.  
</p><p>"Was it rough riding?" she asked.   
</p><p>"I didn't notice it."  
She continued quickly to lay the table.  When she had finished &mdash;  
</p><p>"Tea won't be for a few minutes.  Will you come and look at the  
daffodils?" she said.  
</p><p>He rose without answering.  They went out into the back garden  
under the budding damson-trees.  The hills and the sky were clean  
and cold.  Everything looked washed, rather hard.  Miriam glanced  
at Paul.  He was pale and impassive.  It seemed cruel to her that his  
eyes and brows, which she loved, could look so hurting.  
</p><p>"Has the wind made you tired?" she asked.  She detected an   
underneath feeling of weariness about him.  
</p><p>"No, I think not," he answered.  
</p><p>"It must be rough on the road &mdash; the wood moans so."  
</p><p>"You can see by the clouds it's a south-west wind; that helps  
me here."  
</p><p>"You see, I don't cycle, so I don't understand," she murmured.  
</p><p>"Is there need to cycle to know that!" he said.  
</p><p>She thought his sarcasms were unnecessary.  They went forward  
in silence.  Round the wild, tussocky lawn at the back of the house  
was a thorn hedge, under which daffodils were craning forward  
from among their sheaves of grey-green blades.  The cheeks of the  
flowers were greenish with cold.  But still some had burst, and their  
gold ruffled and glowed.  Miriam went on her knees before one  
cluster, took a wild-looking daffodil between her hands, turned up  
its face of gold to her, and bowed down, caressing it with her mouth  
and cheeks and brow.  He stood aside, with his hands in his pockets,  
  
  
<pb n="229"/>   
  
watching her.  One after another she turned up to him the faces of  
the yellow, bursten flowers appealingly, fondling them lavishly all  
the while.  
</p><p>"Aren't they magnificent?" she murmured.  
</p><p>"Magnificent! It's a bit thick &mdash; they're pretty!"  
</p><p>She bowed again to her flowers at his censure of her praise.  He  
watched her crouching, sipping the flowers with fervid kisses.  
</p><p>"Why must you always be fondling things?" he said irritably.  
</p><p>"But I love to touch them," she replied, hurt.  
</p><p>"Can you never like things without clutching them as if you  
wanted to pull the heart out of them? Why don't you have a bit  
more restraint, or reserve, or something?"  
</p><p>She looked up at him full of pain, then continued slowly to stroke  
her lips against a ruffled flower.  Their scent, as she smelled it, was  
so much kinder than he; it almost made her cry.  
</p><p>"You wheedle the soul out of things," he said.  "I would never  
wheedle &mdash; at any rate, I'd go straight."  
</p><p>He scarcely knew what he was saying.  These things came from  
him mechanically.  She looked at him.  His body seemed one  
weapon, firm and hard against her.  
</p><p>"You're always begging things to love you," he said, "as if you  
were a beggar for love.  Even the flowers, you have to fawn on  
them &mdash; "  
</p><p>Rhythmically, Miriam was swaying and stroking the flower with  
her mouth, inhaling the scent which ever after made her shudder  
as it came to her nostrils.  
</p><p>"You don't want to love &mdash; your eternal and abnormal craving is  
to be loved.  You aren't positive, you're negative.  You absorb, absorb,   
as if you must fill yourself up with love, because you've got a  
shortage somewhere."  
</p><p>She was stunned by his cruelty, and did not hear.  He had not  
the faintest notion of what he was saying.  It was as if his fretted,  
tortured soul, run hot by thwarted passion, jetted off these sayings  
like sparks from electricity.  She did not grasp anything he said.   
She only sat crouched beneath his cruelty and his hatred of her.   
She never realised in a flash.  Over everything she brooded and  
brooded.  
</p><p>After tea he stayed with Edgar and the brothers, taking no   
notice of Miriam.  She, extremely unhappy on this looked-for holiday,  
  
  
<pb n="230"/>   
  
waited for him.  And at last he yielded and came to her.  She was  
determined to track this mood of his to its origin.  She counted it  
not much more than a mood.  
</p><p>"Shall we go through the wood a little way?" she asked him,  
knowing he never refused a direct request.  
</p><p>They went down to the warren.  On the middle path they passed  
a trap, a narrow horseshoe hedge of small fir-boughs, baited with  
the guts of a rabbit.  Paul glanced at it frowning.  She caught his eye.  
</p><p>"Isn't it dreadful?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know! Is it worse than a weasel with its teeth in a   
rabbit's throat? One weasel or many rabbits? One or the other must  
go!"  
</p><p>He was taking the bitterness of life badly.  She was rather sorry  
for him.  
</p><p>"We will go back to the house," he said.  "I don't want to walk  
out."  
</p><p>They went past the lilac-tree, whose bronze leaf-buds were coming   
unfastened.  Just a fragment remained of the haystack, a monument squared   
and brown, like a pillar of stone.  There was a little  
bed of hay from the last cutting.  
</p><p>"Let us sit here a minute," said Miriam.  
</p><p>He sat down against his will, resting his back against the hard  
wall of hay.  They faced the amphitheatre of round hills that glowed  
with sunset, tiny white farms standing out, the meadows golden, the  
woods dark and yet luminous, tree-tops folded over tree-tops, distinct   
in the distance.  The evening had cleared, and the east was tender   
with a magenta flush under which the land lay still and rich.  
</p><p>"Isn't it beautiful?" she pleaded.  
</p><p>But he only scowled.  He would rather have had it ugly just then.  
</p><p>At that moment a big bull-terrier came rushing up, open-mouthed, pranced his two paws on the youth's shoulders, licking  
his face.  Paul drew back, laughing.  Bill was a great relief to him.   
He pushed the dog aside, but it came leaping back.  
</p><p>"Get out," said the lad, "or I'll dot thee one."  
</p><p>But the dog was not to be pushed away.  So Paul had a little   
battle with the creature, pitching poor Bill away from him, who,   
however, only floundered tumultuously back again, wild with joy.  The  
two fought together, the man laughing grudgingly, the dog grinning  
all over.  Miriam watched them.  There was something pathetic  
  
  
<pb n="231"/>   
  
about the man.  He wanted so badly to love, to be tender.  The rough  
way he bowled the dog over was really loving.  Bill got up, panting  
with happiness, his brown eyes rolling in his white face, and lumbered   
back again.  He adored Paul.  The lad frowned.  
</p><p>"Bill, I've had enough o' thee," he said.  
</p><p>But the dog only stood with two heavy paws, that quivered with  
love, upon his thigh, and flickered a red tongue at him.  He drew  
back.  
</p><p>"No," he said &mdash; "no &mdash; I've had enough."  
</p><p>And in a minute the dog trotted off happily, to vary the fun.  
</p><p>He remained staring miserably across at the hills, whose still  
beauty he begrudged.  He wanted to go and cycle with Edgar.  Yet  
he had not the courage to leave Miriam.  
</p><p>"Why are you sad?" she asked humbly.  
</p><p>"I'm not sad; why should I be," he answered.  "I'm only normal."  
</p><p>She wondered why he always claimed to be normal when he was  
disagreeable.  
</p><p>"But what is the matter?" she pleaded, coaxing him soothingly.  
</p><p>"Nothing!"  
</p><p>"Nay!" she murmured.  
</p><p>He picked up a stick and began to stab the earth with it.  
</p><p>"You'd far better not talk," he said.  
</p><p>"But I wish to know &mdash; " she replied.  
</p><p>He laughed resentfully.  
</p><p>"You always do," he said.  
</p><p>"It's not fair to me," she murmured.  
</p><p>He thrust, thrust, thrust at the ground with the pointed stick,   
digging up little clods of earth as if he were in a fever of irritation.  
She gently and firmly laid her band on his wrist.  
</p><p>"Don't!" she said.  "Put it away."  
</p><p>He flung the stick into the currant-bushes, and leaned back.  Now  
he was bottled up.  
</p><p>"What is it?" she pleaded softly.  
</p><p>He lay perfectly still, only his eyes alive, and they full of torment.  
</p><p>"You know," he said at length, rather wearily &mdash; "you know &mdash;  
we'd better break off."  
</p><p>It was what she dreaded. Swiftly everything seemed to darken  
before her eyes.  
</p><p>"Why!" she murmured.  "What has happened?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="223"/>   
  
<p>"Nothing has happened.  We only realise where we are.  It's no  
good &mdash; "  
</p><p>She waited in silence, sadly, patiently.  It was no good being   
impatient with him.  At any rate, he would tell her now what ailed  
him.  
</p><p>"We agreed on friendship," he went on in a dull, monotonous  
voice.  "How often have we agreed for friendship! And yet &mdash; it  
neither stops there, nor gets anywhere else."  
</p><p>He was silent again.  She brooded.  What did he mean? He was  
so wearying.  There was something he would not yield.  Yet she  
must be patient with him.  
</p><p>"I can only give friendship &mdash; it's all I'm capable of &mdash; it's a flaw  
in my make-up.  The thing overbalances to one side &mdash; I hate a toppling   
balance.  Let us have done."  
</p><p>There was warmth of fury in his last phrases.  He meant she loved  
him more than he her.  Perhaps he could not love her.  Perhaps she  
had not in herself that which he wanted.  It was the deepest motive  
of her soul, this self-mistrust.  It was so deep she dared neither realise   
nor acknowledge.  Perhaps she was deficient.  Like an infinitely  
subtle shame, it kept her always back.  If it were so, she would do  
without him.  She would never let herself want him.  She would  
merely see.  
</p><p>"But what has happened?" she said.  
</p><p>"Nothing &mdash; it's all in myself &mdash; it only comes out just now.  We're  
always like this towards Easter-time."  
</p><p>He grovelled so helplessly, she pitied him.  At least she never  
floundered in such a pitiable way.  After all, it was he who was  
chiefly humiliated.  
</p><p>"What do you want?" she asked him.  
</p><p>"Why &mdash; I mustn't come often &mdash; that's all.  Why should I   
monopolise you when I'm not &mdash; You see, I'm deficient in something with  
regard to you &mdash; "  
</p><p>He was telling her he did not love her, and so ought to leave  
her a chance with another man.  How foolish and blind and shamefully   
clumsy he was! What were other men to her! What were men  
to her at all! But he, ah! she loved his soul.  Was he deficient in  
something? Perhaps he was.  
</p><p>"But I don't understand," she said huskily.  "Yesterday &mdash; "</p>  
  
<pb n="233"/>   
<p>The night was turning jangled and hateful to him as the twilight  
faded.  And she bowed under her suffering.  
</p><p>"I know," he cried, "you never will! You'll never believe that  
I can't &mdash; can't physically, any more than I can fly up like a skylark &mdash; "  
</p><p>"What?" she murmured.  Now she dreaded.  
</p><p>"Love you."  
</p><p>He hated her bitterly at that moment because he made her suffer.    
Love her! She knew he loved her.  He really belonged to her.   
This about not loving her, physically, bodily, was a mere perversity  
on his part, because he knew she loved him.  He was stupid like a  
child.  He belonged to her.  His soul wanted her.  She guessed somebody   
had been influencing him.  She felt upon him the hardness,  
the foreignness of another influence.  
</p><p>"What have they been saying at home?" she asked.  
</p><p>"It's not that," he answered.  
</p><p>And then she knew it was.  She despised them for their   
commonness, his people.  They did not know what things were really  
worth.  
</p><p>He and she talked very little more that night.  After all he left  
her to cycle with Edgar.  
</p><p>He had come back to his mother.  Hers was the strongest tie  
in his life.  When he thought round, Miriam shrank away.  There  
was a vague, unreal feel about her.  And nobody else mattered.   
There was one place in the world that stood solid and did not melt  
into unreality: the place where his mother was.  Everybody else  
could grow shadowy, almost non-existent to him, but she could  
not.  It was as if the pivot and pole of his life, from which he  
could not escape, was his mother.  
</p><p>And in the same way she waited for him.  In him was established  
her life now.  After all, the life beyond offered very little to Mrs.  
Morel.  She saw that our chance for doing is here, and doing  
counted with her.  Paul was going to prove that she had been right;  
he was going to make a man whom nothing should shift off his  
feet; he was going to alter the face of the earth in some way which  
mattered.  Wherever he went she felt her soul went with him.  Whatever   
he did she felt her soul stood by him, ready, as it were, to hand  
him his tools.  She could not bear it when he was with Miriam.   
William was dead.  She would fight to keep Paul.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="234"/>   
  
<p>And he came back to her.  And in his soul was a feeling of the  
satisfaction of self-sacrifice because he was faithful to her.   
She loved him first; he loved her first.  And yet it was not enough.  His  
new young life, so strong and imperious, was urged towards something   
else.  It made him mad with restlessness.  She saw this, and  
wished bitterly that Miriam had been a woman who could take this  
new life of his, and leave her the roots.  He fought against his  
mother almost as he fought against Miriam.  
</p><p>It was a week before he went again to Willey Farm.  Miriam  
had suffered a great deal, and was afraid to see him again.  Was she  
now to endure the ignominy of his abandoning her? That would  
only be superficial and temporary.  He would come back.  She held  
the keys to his soul.  But meanwhile, how he would torture her with  
his battle against her.  She shrank from it.  
</p><p>However, the Sunday after Easter he came to tea.  Mrs. Leivers  
was glad to see him.  She gathered something was fretting him, that  
he found things hard.  He seemed to drift to her for comfort.  And  
she was good to him.  She did him that great kindness of treating  
him almost with reverence.  
</p><p>He met her with the young children in the front garden.  
</p><p>"I'm glad you've come," said the mother, looking at him with her  
great appealing brown eyes.  "It is such a sunny day.  I was just going   
down the fields for the first time this year."  
</p><p>He felt she would like him to come.  That soothed him.  They  
went, talking simply, he gentle and humble.  He could have wept  
with gratitude that she was deferential to him.  He was feeling  
humiliated. At the bottom of  the  Mow  Close  they  found  a  thrush's  nest.  
</p><p>"Shall I show you the eggs?" he said.  
</p><p>"Do!" replied Mrs. Leivers.  "They seem such a sign of spring,  
and so hopeful."  
</p><p>He put aside the thorns, and took out the eggs, holding them in  
the palm of his hand.  
</p><p>"They are quite hot &mdash; I think we frightened her off them," he  
said.  
</p><p>"Ay, poor thing!" said Mrs. Leivers.  
</p><p>Miriam could not help touching the eggs, and his hand which,  
it seemed to her, cradled them so well.  
</p><p>"Isn't it a strange warmth!" she murmured, to get near him.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="235"/>   
<p>"Blood heat," he answered.  
</p><p>She watched him putting them back, his body pressed against the  
hedge, his arm reaching slowly through the thorns, his hand  
folded carefully over the eggs.  He was concentrated on the act.   
Seeing him so, she loved him; he seemed so simple and sufficient  
to himself.  And she could not get to him.  
</p><p>After tea she stood hesitating at the bookshelf.  He took "Tartarin  
de Tarascon".  Again they sat on the bank of hay at the foot of the  
stack.  He read a couple of pages, but without any heart for it.  Again  
the dog came racing up to repeat the fun of the other day.  He  
shoved his muzzle in the man's chest.  Paul fingered his ear for a  
moment.  Then he pushed him away.  
</p><p>"Go away, Bill," he said.  "I don't want you."  
</p><p>Bill slunk off, and Miriam wondered and dreaded what was coming.    
There was a silence about the youth that made her still with  
apprehension.  It was not his furies, but his quiet resolutions that  
she feared.  
</p><p>Turning his face a little to one side, so that she could not see  
him, he began, speaking slowly and painfully:  
</p><p>"Do you think &mdash; if I didn't come up so much &mdash; you might get to  
like somebody else &mdash; another man?"  
</p><p>So this was what he was still harping on.  
</p><p>"But I don't know any other men.  Why do you ask?" she replied,  
in a low tone that should have been a reproach to him.  
</p><p>"Why," he blurted, "because they say I've no right to come up  
like this &mdash; without we mean to marry &mdash; "  
</p><p>Miriam was indignant at anybody's forcing the issues between  
them.  She had been furious with her own father for suggesting to  
Paul, laughingly, that he knew why he came so much.  
</p><p>"Who says?" she asked, wondering if her people had anything  
to do with it.  They had not.  
</p><p>"Mother &mdash; and the others.  They say at this rate everybody will  
consider me engaged, and I ought to consider myself so, because  
it's not fair to you.  And I've tried to find out &mdash; and I don't think I  
love you as a man ought to love his wife.  What do you think about  
it?"  
</p><p>Miriam bowed her head moodily.  She was angry at having this  
struggle.  People should leave him and her alone.  
</p><p>"I don't know," she murmured.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="236"/>   
  
<p>"Do you think we love each other enough to marry?" he asked  
definitely.  It made her tremble.  
</p><p>"No," she answered truthfully.  "I don't think so &mdash; we're too  
young."  
</p><p>"I thought perhaps," he went on miserably, "that you, with your  
intensity in things, might have given me more &mdash; than I could ever  
make up to you.  And even now &mdash; if you think it better &mdash; we'll be  
engaged."  
</p><p>Now Miriam wanted to cry.  And she was angry, too.  He was  
always such a child for people to do as they liked with.  
</p><p>"No, I don't think so," she said firmly.  
</p><p>He pondered a minute.  
</p><p>"You see," he said, "with me &mdash; I don't think one person would  
ever monopolize me &mdash; be everything to me &mdash; I think never."  
</p><p>This she did not consider.  
</p><p>"No," she murmured.  Then, after a pause, she looked at him,  
and her dark eyes flashed.  
</p><p>"This is your mother," she said.  "I know she never liked me."  
</p><p>"No, no, it isn't," he said hastily.  "It was for your sake she spoke  
this time.  She only said, if I was going on, I ought to consider myself   
engaged." There was a silence.  "And if I ask you to come down  
any time, you won't stop away, will you?"  
</p><p>She did not answer.  By this time she was very angry.  
</p><p>"Well, what shall we do?" she said shortly.  "I suppose I'd better  
drop French.  I was just beginning to get on with it.  But I suppose  
can go on alone."  
</p><p>"I don't see that we need," he said.  "I can give you a French   
lesson, surely."  
</p><p>"Well &mdash; and there are Sunday nights.  I shan't stop coming to  
chapel, because I enjoy it, and it's all the social life I get.  But you've  
no need to come home with me.  I can go alone."  
</p><p>"All right," he answered, rather taken aback.  "But if I ask  
Edgar, he'll always come with us, and then they can say nothing."  
</p><p>There was silence.  After all, then, she would not lose much.  For  
all their talk down at his home there would not be much difference.   
She wished they would mind their own business.  
</p><p>"And you won't think about it, and let it trouble you, will you?"  
he asked.  
</p><p>"Oh no," replied Miriam, without looking at him.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="237"/>   
<p>He was silent.  She thought him unstable.  He had no fixity of purpose,   
no anchor of righteousness that held him.  
</p><p>"Because," he continued, "a man gets across his bicycle &mdash; and  
goes to work &mdash; and does all sorts of things.  But a woman broods."  
</p><p>"No, I shan't bother," said Miriam.  And she meant it.  
</p><p>It had gone rather chilly.  They went indoors.  
</p><p>"How white Paul looks!" Mrs. Leivers exclaimed.  "Miriam, you  
shouldn't have let him sit out of doors.  Do you think you've taken  
cold, Paul?"  
</p><p>"Oh, no!" he laughed.  
</p><p>But be felt done up.  It wore him out, the conflict in himself.   
Miriam pitied him now.  But quite early, before nine o'clock, he  
rose to go.  
</p><p>"You're not going home, are you?" asked Mrs. Leivers  
anxiously.  
</p><p>"Yes," he replied.  "I said I'd be early." He was very awkward.  
</p><p>"But this is early," said Mrs. Leivers.  
</p><p>Miriam sat in the rocking-chair, and did not speak.  He hesitated,  
expecting her to rise and go with him to the barn as usual for his  
bicycle.  She remained as she was.  He was at a loss.  
</p><p>"Well &mdash; good-night, all!" he faltered.  
</p><p>She spoke ber good-night along with all the others.  But as be  
went past the window he looked in.  She saw him pale, his brows  
knit slightly in a way that had become constant with him, his eyes  
dark with pain.  
</p><p>She rose and went to the doorway to wave good-bye to him as he  
passed through the gate.  He rode slowly under the pine-trees, feeling   
a cur and a miserable wretch.  His bicycle went tilting down the  
hills at random.  He thought it would be a relief to break one's  
neck.  
</p><p>Two days later he sent her up a book and a little note, urging  
her to read and be busy.  
</p><p>At this time he gave all his friendship to Edgar.  He loved the  
family so much, he loved the farm so much; it was the dearest  
place on earth to him.  His home was not so lovable.  It was  
his mother.  But then he would have been just as happy with his  
mother anywhere.  Whereas Willey Farm he loved passionately.  He  
loved the little pokey kitchen, where men's boots tramped, and the  
dog slept with one eye open for fear of being trodden on; where  
  
  
<pb n="238"/>   
  
the lamp hung over the table at night, and everything was so  
silent.  He loved Miriam's long, low parlour, with its atmosphere of  
romance, its flowers, its books, its high rosewood piano.  He loved  
the gardens and the buildings that stood with their scarlet roofs on  
the naked edges of the fields, crept towards the wood as if for  
cosiness, the wild country scooping down a valley and up the uncultured   
hills of the other side.  Only to be there was an exhilaration and a   
joy to him.  He loved Mrs. Leivers, with her unworldliness  
and her quaint cynicism; he loved Mr. Leivers, so warm and  
young and lovable; he loved Edgar, who lit up when he came, and.,  
the boys and the children and Bill &mdash; even the sow Circe and the  
Indian game-cock called Tippoo.  All this besides Miriam.  He  
could not give it up.  
</p><p>So he went as often, but he was usually with Edgar.  Only all  
the family, including the father, joined in charades and games at  
evening.  And later, Miriam drew them together, and they  
read "Macbeth" out of penny books, taking parts.  It was great  
excitement.  Miriam was glad, and Mrs. Leivers was glad, and Mr. Leivers  
enjoyed it.  Then they all learned songs together from tonic sol-fa,  
singing in a circle round the fire.  But now Paul was very rarely  
alone with Miriam.  She waited.  When she and Edgar and he  
walked home together from chapel or from the literary society in  
Bestwood, she knew his talk, so passionate and so unorthodox  
nowadays, was for her.  She did envy Edgar, however, his cycling  
with Paul, his Friday nights, his days working in the fields.  For her  
Friday nights and her French lessons were gone.  She was nearly  
always alone, walking, pondering in the wood, reading, studying,  
dreaming, waiting.  And he wrote to her frequently.  
</p><p>One Sunday evening they attained to their old rare harmony.   
Edgar had stayed to Communion &mdash; he wondered what it was like  
&mdash; with Mrs. Morel.  So Paul came on alone with Miriam to his  
home.  He was more or less under her spell again.  As usual, they  
were discussing the sermon.  He was setting now full sail towards  
Agnosticism, but such a religious Agnosticism that Miriam did not  
suffer so badly.  They were at the Renan "Vie de Jesus" stage.   
Miriam was the threshing-floor on which he threshed out all his  
beliefs.  While he trampled his ideas upon her soul, the truth came  
out for him.  She alone was his threshing-floor.  She alone helped  
him towards realization.  Almost impassive, she submitted to his  
  
  
<pb n="239"/>   
  
argument and expounding.  And somehow, because of her, he  
gradually realized where he was wrong.  And what he realized, she  
realized.  She felt he could not do without her.  
</p><p>They came to the silent house.  He took the key out of the scullery  
window, and they entered.  All the time he went on with his discussion.    
He lit the gas, mended the fire, and brought her some cakes  
from the pantry.  She sat on the sofa, quietly, with a plate on her  
knee.  She wore a large white hat with some pinkish flowers.  It was  
a cheap hat, but he liked it.  Her face beneath was still and pensive,  
golden-brown and ruddy.  Always her ears were hid in her short  
curls.  She watched him.  
</p><p>She liked him on Sundays.  Then he wore a dark suit that showed  
the lithe movement of his body.  There was a clean, clear-cut look  
about him.  He went on with his thinking to her.  Suddenly he  
reached for a Bible.  Miriam liked the way he reached up &mdash; so sharp,  
straight to the mark.  He turned the pages quickly, and read her a  
chapter of St. John.  As he sat in the arm-chair reading, intent, his  
voice only thinking, she felt as if he were using her unconsciously  
as a man uses his tools at some work he is bent on.  She loved it.  
And the wistfulness of his voice was like a reaching to something,  
and it was as if she were what he reached with.  She sat back on the  
sofa away from him, and yet feeling herself the very instrument  
his hand grasped.  It gave her great pleasure.  
</p><p>Then he began to falter and to get self-conscious.  And when  
he came to the verse, "A woman, when she is in travail, hath sorrow   
because her hour is come", he missed it out.  Miriam had felt  
him growing uncomfortable.  She shrank when the well-known  
words did not follow.  He went on reading, but she did not hear.   
A grief and shame made her bend her head.  Six months ago he  
would have read it simply.  Now there was a scotch in his running  
with her.  Now she felt there was really something hostile between  
them, something of which they were ashamed.  
</p><p>She ate her cake mechanically.  He tried to go on with his argument,   
but could not get back the right note.  Soon Edgar came in.  
Mrs. Morel had gone to her friends'.  The three set off to Willey  
Farm.  
</p><p>Miriam brooded over his split with her.  There was something  
else he wanted.  He could not be satisfied; he could give her no  
peace.  There was between them now always a ground for strife.  
  
  
<pb n="240"/>   
  
She wanted to prove him.  She believed that his chief need in life  
was herself.  If she could prove it, both to herself and to him, the  
rest might go; she could simply trust to the future.  
</p><p>So in May she asked him to come to Willey Farm and meet Mrs.  
Dawes.  There was something he hankered after.  She saw him,  
whenever they spoke of Clara Dawes, rouse and get slightly angry.   
He said he did not like her.  Yet he was keen to know about her.   
Well, he should put himself to the test.  She believed that there  
were in him desires for higher things, and desires for lower, and  
that the desire for the higher would conquer.  At any rate, he should  
try.  She forgot that her "higher" and "lower" were arbitrary.  
</p><p>He was rather excited at the idea of meeting Clara at Willey Farm.   
Mrs. Dawes came for the day.  Her heavy, dun-coloured hair was  
coiled on top of her head.  She wore a white blouse and navy skirt,  
and somehow, wherever she was, seemed to make things look  
paltry and insignificant.  When she was in the room, the kitchen  
seemed too small and mean altogether.  Miriam's beautiful twilighty   
parlour looked stiff and stupid.  An the Leivers were  
eclipsed like candles.  They found her rather hard to put up with.   
Yet she was perfectly amiable, but indifferent, and rather hard.  
</p><p>Paul did not come till afternoon.  He was early.  As he swung off  
his bicycle, Miriam saw him look round at the house eagerly. He  
would be disappointed if the visitor had not come.  Miriam went  
out to meet him, bowing her head because of the sunshine.   
Nasturtiums were coming out crimson under the cool green  
shadow of their leaves.  The girl stood, dark-haired, glad to see  
him.  
</p><p>"Hasn't Clara come?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes," replied Miriam in her musical tone.  "She's reading."  
</p><p>He wheeled his bicycle into the barn.  He had put on a handsome   
tie, of which he was rather proud, and socks to match.  
</p><p>"She came this morning?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes," replied Miriam, as she walked at his side.  "You said  
you'd bring me that letter from the man at Liberty's.  Have you   
remembered?"  
</p><p>"Oh, dash, no!" he said.  "But nag at me till you get it."  
</p><p>"I don't like to nag at you."  
</p><p>"Do it whether or not.  And is she any more agreeable?" he   
continued.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="241"/>   
<p>"You know I always think she is quite agreeable."  
</p><p>He was silent.  Evidently his eagerness to be early to-day had been  
the newcomer.  Miriam already began to suffer.  They went together  
towards the house.  He took the clips off his trousers, but was too  
lazy to brush the dust from his shoes, in spite of the socks and  
tie.  
</p><p>Clara sat in the cool parlour reading.  He saw the nape of ber  
white neck, and the fine hair lifted from it.  She rose, looking at  
him indifferently.  To shake hands she lifted her arm straight, in a  
manner that seemed at once to keep him at a distance, and yet to  
fling something to him.  He noticed bow her breasts swelled inside  
her blouse, and how her shoulder curved handsomely under the  
thin muslin at the top of her arm.  
</p><p>"You have chosen a fine day," he said.  
</p><p>"It happens so," she said.  
</p><p>"Yes," he said; "I am glad."  
</p><p>She sat down, not thanking him for his politeness.  
</p><p>"What have you been doing all morning?" asked Paul of Miriam.  
</p><p>"Well, you see," said Miriam, coughing huskily, "Clara only  
came with father &mdash; and so&mdash;
 she's not been here very long."  
</p><p>Clara sat leaning on the table, holding aloof.  He noticed her  
hands were large, but well kept.  And the skin on them seemed almost   
coarse, opaque, and white, with fine golden hairs.  She did not  
mind if he observed her hands.  She intended to scorn him.  Her  
heavy arm lay negligently on the table.  Her mouth was closed as  
if she were offended, and she kept her face slightly  
averted.  
</p><p>"You were at Margaret Bonford's meeting the other evening,"  
he said to her.  
</p><p>Miriam did not know this courteous Paul.  Clara glanced at him.  
</p><p>"Yes," she said.  
</p><p>"Why," asked Miriam, "how do you know?"  
</p><p>"I went in for a few minutes before the train came," he answered.  
</p><p>Clara turned away again rather disdainfully.  
</p><p>"I think she's a lovable little woman," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Margaret Bonford!" exclaimed Clara.  "She's a great deal  
cleverer than most men."  
</p><p>"Well, I didn't say she wasn't," he said, deprecating.  "She's lovable   
for all that."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="242"/>   
  
<p>"And, of course, that is all that matters," said Clara witheringly.  
</p><p>He rubbed his head, rather perplexed, rather annoyed.  
</p><p>"I suppose it matters more than her cleverness," he said;  
"which, after all, would never get her to heaven."  
</p><p>"It's not heaven she wants to get &mdash; it's her fair share on earth,"  
retorted Clara.  She spoke as if he were responsible for some deprivation   
which Miss Bonford suffered.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I thought she was warm, and awfully nice &mdash;  
only too frail.  I wished she was sitting comfortably in peace &mdash; "  
</p><p>"'Darning her husband's stockings,'" said Clara scathingly.  
</p><p>"I'm sure she wouldn't mind darning even my stockings," he  
said.  "And I'm sure she'd do them well.  Just as I wouldn't mind  
blacking her boots if she wanted me to."  
</p><p>But Clara refused to answer this sally of his.  He talked to Miriam  
for a little while.  The other woman held aloof.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "I think I'll go and see Edgar.  Is he on the  
land?"  
</p><p>"I believe," said Miriam, "he's gone for a load of coal.  He should  
be back directly."  
</p><p>"Then," he said, "I'll go and meet him."  
</p><p>Miriam dared not propose anything for the three of them.  He  
rose and left them.  
</p><p>On the top road, where the gorse was out, he saw Edgar walking  
lazily beside the mare, who nodded her white-starred forehead as  
she dragged the clanking load of coal.  The young farmer's face  
lighted up as he saw his friend.  Edgar was good-looking, with dark,  
warm eyes.  His clothes were old and rather disreputable, and he  
walked with considerable pride.  
</p><p>"Hello!" he said, seeing Paul bareheaded.  "Where are  
you going?"  
</p><p>"Came to meet you.  Can't stand 'Nevermore'."  
</p><p>Edgar's teeth flashed in a laugh of amusement.  
</p><p>"Who is 'Nevermore'?" he asked.  
</p><p>"The lady &mdash; Mrs.  Dawes &mdash; it ought to be Mrs. The Raven that  
quothed 'Nevermore'."  
</p><p>Edgar laughed with glee.  
</p><p>"Don't you like her?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Not a fat lot," said Paul.  "Why, do you?"  
</p><p>"No!" The answer came with a deep ring of conviction. "No!"  
  
  
<pb n="243"/>   
  
Edgar pursed up his lips.  "I can't say she's much in my line." He  
mused a little.  Then: "But why do you call her 'Nevermore'?" he  
asked.  
</p><p>"Well," said Paul, "if she looks at a man she says haughtily  
'Nevermore', and if she looks at herself in the looking-glass she says  
disdainfully 'Nevermore', and if she thinks back she says it in disgust,   
and if she looks forward she says it cynically."  
</p><p>Edgar considered this speech, failed to make much out of it,  
and said, laughing:  
</p><p>"You think she's a man-hater?"  
</p><p>"She thinks she is," replied Paul.  
</p><p>"But you don't think so?"  
</p><p>"No," replied Paul.  
</p><p>"Wasn't she nice with you, then?"  
</p><p>"Could you imagine her nice with anybody?" asked the young  
man.  
</p><p>Edgar laughed.  Together they unloaded the coal in the yard.   
Paul was rather self-conscious, because he knew Clara could see  
if she looked out of the window.  She didn't look.  
</p><p>On Saturday afternoons the horses were brushed down and  
groomed.  Paul and Edgar worked together, sneezing with the dust  
that came from the pelts of Jimmy and Flower.  
</p><p>"Do you know a new song to teach me?" said Edgar.  
</p><p>He continued to work all the time.  The back of his neck was  
sun-red when he bent down, and his fingers that held the brush  
were thick.  Paul watched him sometimes.  
</p><p>"'Mary Morrison'?" suggested the younger.  
</p><p>Edgar agreed.  He had a good tenor voice, and he loved to learn  
all the songs his friend could teach him, so that he could sing whilst  
he was carting.  Paul had a very indifferent baritone voice, but a  
good ear.  However, he sang softly, for fear of Clara.  Edgar repeated   
the line in a clear tenor.  At times they both broke off  
to sneeze, and first one, then the other, abused his horse.  
</p><p>Miriam was impatient of men.  It took so little to amuse them &mdash;  
even Paul.  She thought it anomalous in him that he could be so  
thoroughly absorbed in a triviality.  
</p><p>It was tea-time when they had finished.  
</p><p>"What song was that?" asked Miriam.  
</p><p>Edgar told her.  The conversation turned to singing.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="244"/>   
  
<p>"We have such jolly times," Miriam said to Clara.  
</p><p>Mrs. Dawes ate her meal in a slow, dignified way.  Whenever  
the men were present she grew distant.  
</p><p>"Do you like singing?" Miriam asked her.  
</p><p>"If it is good," she said.  
</p><p>Paul, of course, coloured.  
</p><p>"You mean if it is high-class and trained?" he said.  
</p><p>"I think a voice needs training before the singing is anything,"  
she said.  
</p><p>"You might as well insist on having people's voices trained   
before you allowed them to talk," he replied.  "Really, people sing for  
their own pleasure, as a rule."  
</p><p>"And it may be for other people's discomfort."  
</p><p>"Then the other people should have flaps to their ears," he replied.  
</p><p>The boys laughed.  There was a silence.  He flushed deeply, and  
ate in silence.  
</p><p>After tea, when all the men had gone but Paul, Mrs. Leivers said  
to Clara:  
</p><p>"And you find life happier now?"  
</p><p>"Infinitely."  
</p><p>"And you are satisfied?"  
</p><p>"So long as I can be free and independent."  
</p><p>"And you don't miss anything in your life?" asked Mrs. Leivers  
gently.  
</p><p>"I've put all that behind me."  
</p><p>Paul had been feeling uncomfortable during this discourse.  He  
got up.  
</p><p>"You'll find you're always tumbling over the things you've put  
behind you," he said.  Then he took his departure to the cow-sheds.   
He felt he had been witty, and his manly pride was high.  He  
whistled as he went down the brick track.  
</p><p>Miriam came for him a little later to know if he would go with  
Clara and her for a walk.  They set off down to Strelley Mill Farm.   
As they were going beside the brook, on the Willey Water side,  
looking through the brake at the edge of the wood, where pink  
campions glowed under a few sunbeams, they saw, beyond the  
tree-trunks and the thin hazel bushes, a man leading a great bay  
horse through the gullies.  The big red beast seemed to dance  
  
  
<pb n="245"/>   
romantically through that dimness of green hazel drift, away there  
where the air was shadowy, as if it were in the past, among the  
fading bluebells that might have bloomed for Deidre or Iseult.  
</p><p>The three stood charmed.  
</p><p>"What a treat to be a knight," he said, "and to have a pavilion  
here."  
</p><p>"And to have us shut up safely?" replied Clara.  
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, "singing with your maids at your broidery.   
I would carry your banner of white and green and heliotrope.  I  
would have 'W.S.P.U.' emblazoned on my shield, beneath a  
woman rampant."  
</p><p>"I have no doubt," said Clara, "that you would much rather fight  
for a woman than let her fight for herself."  
</p><p>"I would.  When she fights for herself she seems like a dog before   
a looking-glass, gone into a mad fury with its own shadow."  
</p><p>"And you are the looking-glass?" she asked, with a curl of the  
lip.  
</p><p>"Or the shadow," he replied.  
</p><p>"I am afraid," she said, "that you are too clever."  
</p><p>"Well, I leave it to you to be good," he retorted, laughing.  "Be  
good, sweet maid, and just let me be clever."  
</p><p>But Clara wearied of his flippancy.  Suddenly, looking at her, he  
saw that the upward lifting of her face was misery and not scorn.   
His heart grew tender for everybody.  He tumed and was gentle  
with Miriam, whom he had neglected till then.  
</p><p>At the wood's edge they met Limb, a thin, swarthy man of  
forty, tenant of Strelley Mill, which he ran as a cattle-raising farm.   
He held the halter of the powerful stallion indifferently, as if he  
were tired.  The three stood to let him pass over the stepping-stones of the first brook.  Paul admired that so large an animal  
should walk on such springy toes, with an endless excess of vigour.   
Limb pulled up before them.  
</p><p>"Tell your father, Miss Leivers," he said, in a peculiar piping  
voice, "that his young beas'es 'as broke that bottom fence three  
days an' runnin'."  
</p><p>"Which?" asked Miriam, tremulous.  
</p><p>The great horse breathed heavily, shifting round its red flanks,  
and looking suspiciously with its wonderful big eyes upwards from  
under its lowered head and falling mane.</p>  
  
<pb n="246"/>   
  
<p>"Come along a bit," replied Limb, "an' I'll show you."  
</p><p>The man and the stallion went forward.  It danced sideways,  
shaking its white fetlocks and looking frightened, as it felt itself  
in the brook.  
</p><p>"No hanky-pankyin'," said the man affectionately to the beast.  
</p><p>It went up the bank in little leaps, then splashed finely through  
the second brook.  Clara, walking with a kind of sulky abandon,  
watched it half-fascinated, half-contemptuous.  Limb stopped  
and pointed to the fence under some willows.  
</p><p>"There, you see where they got through," he said.  "My man's  
druv 'em back three times."  
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miriam, colouring as if she were at fault.  
</p><p>"Are you comin' in?" asked the man.  
</p><p>"No, thanks; but we should like to go by the pond."  
</p><p>"Well, just as you've a mind," he said.  
</p><p>The horse gave little whinneys of pleasure at being so near  
home.  
</p><p>"He is glad to be back," said Clara, who was interested in the  
creature.  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; 'e's been a tidy step to-day."  
</p><p>They went through the gate, and saw approaching them from  
the big farm-house a smallish, dark, excitable-looking woman of  
about thirty-five.  Her hair was touched with grey, her dark eyes  
looked wild.  She walked with her hands behind her back.  Her  
brother went forward.  As it saw her, the big bay stallion whinneyed   
again.  She came up excitedly.  
</p><p>"Are you home again, my boy!" she said tenderly to the horse,  
not to the man.  The great beast shifted round to her, ducking his  
head.  She smuggled into his mouth the wrinkled yellow apple she  
had been hiding behind her back, then she kissed him near the  
eyes.  He gave a big sigh of pleasure.  She held his head in her arms  
against her breast.  
</p><p>"Isn't he splendid!" said Miriam to her.  
</p><p>Miss Limb looked up.  Her dark eyes glanced straight at Paul.  
</p><p>"Oh, good-evening, Miss Leivers," she said.  "It's ages since  
you've been down."  
</p><p>Miriam introduced her friends.  
</p><p>"Your horse is a fine fellow!" said Clara.  
</p><p>"Isn't he!" Again she kissed him.  "As loving as any man!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="247"/>   
  
<p>"More loving than most men, I should think,"  
replied Clara.   
</p><p>"He's a nice boy!" cried the woman, again embracing the horse.   
</p><p>Clara, fascinated by the big beast, went up to stroke his neck.  
</p><p>"He's quite gentle," said Miss Limb.  "Don't you think big fellows   
are?"  
</p><p>"He's a beauty!" replied Clara.  
</p><p>She wanted to look in his eyes.  She wanted him to look at her.  
</p><p>"It's a pity he can't talk," she said.  
</p><p>"Oh, but he can &mdash; all but," replied the other woman.  
</p><p>Then her brother moved on with the horse.  
</p><p>"Are you coming in? Do come in, Mr. &mdash; I didn't catch it."  
</p><p>"Morel," said Miriam.  "No, we won't come in, but we should  
like to go by the mill-pond."  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; yes, do.  Do you fish, Mr. Morel?"  
</p><p>"No," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Because if you do you might come and fish any time," said Miss  
Limb.  "We scarcely see a soul from week's end to week's end.  I  
should be thankful."  
</p><p>"What fish are there in the pond?" he asked.  
</p><p>They went through the front garden, over the sluice, and up the  
steep bank to the pond, which lay in shadow, with its two wooded  
islets.  Paul walked with Miss Limb.  
</p><p>"I shouldn't mind swimming here," he said.  
</p><p>"Do," she replied.  "Come when you like.  My brother will be  
awfully pleased to talk with you.  He is so quiet, because there is  
no one to talk to.  Do come and swim."  
</p><p>Clara came up.  
</p><p>"It's a fine depth," she said, "and so clear."  
</p><p>"Yes," said Miss Limb.  
</p><p>"Do you swim?" said Paul.  "Miss Limb was just saying we could  
come when we liked."  
</p><p>"Of course there's the farm-hands," said Miss Limb.  
</p><p>They talked a few moments, then went on up the wild hill, leaving   
the lonely, haggard-eyed woman on the bank.  
</p><p>The hillside was all ripe with sunshine.  It was wild and tussocky,  
given over to rabbits.  The three walked in silence.  Then:  
</p><p>"She makes me feel uncomfortable," said Paul.  
</p><p>"You mean Miss Limb?" asked Miriam.  "Yes."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="248"/>   
  
<p>"What's a matter with her? Is she going dotty with being too  
lonely?"  
</p><p>"Yes," said Miriam.  "It's not the right sort of life for ber.  I think  
it's cruel to bury her there.  I really ought to go and see her more.  
But &mdash; she upsets me."  
</p><p>"She makes me feel sorry for her-yes, and she bothers me,"  
he said.  
</p><p>"I suppose," blurted Clara suddenly, "she wants a man."  
</p><p>The other two were silent for a few moments.  
</p><p>"But it's the loneliness sends her cracked," said Paul.  
</p><p>Clara did not answer, but strode on uphill.  She was walking  
with her hand hanging, her legs swinging as she kicked through  
the dead thistles and the tussocky grass, her arms hanging loose.   
Rather than walking, her handsome body seemed to be blundering  
up the hill.  A hot wave went over Paul.  He was curious about her.   
Perhaps life had been cruel to her.  He forgot Miriam, who was  
walking beside him talking to him.  She glanced at him, finding he  
did not answer her.  His eyes were fixed ahead on Clara.  
</p><p>"Do you still think she is disagreeable?" she asked.  
</p><p>He did not notice that the question was sudden.  It ran with his  
thoughts.  
</p><p>"Something's the matter with her," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes," answered Miriam.  
</p><p>They found at the top of the hill a hidden wild field, two sides  
of which were backed by the wood, the other sides by high loose  
hedges of hawthorn and elder bushes.  Between these overgrown  
bushes were gaps that the cattle might have walked through had  
there been any cattle now.  There the turf was smooth as velveteen,  
padded and holed by the rabbits.  The field itself was coarse, and  
crowded with tall, big cowslips that had never been cut.  Clusters  
of strong flowers rose everywhere above the coarse tussocks of  
bent.  It was like a roadstead crowded with tan, fairy shipping.  
</p><p>"Ah!" cried Miriam, and she looked at Paul, her dark eyes  
dilating.  He smiled.  Together they enjoyed the field of flowers.   
Clara, a little way off, was looking at the cowslips disconsolately.   
Paul and Miriam stayed close together, talking in subdued tones.   
He kneeled on one knee, quickly gathering the best blossoms,  
moving from tuft to tuft restlessly, talking softly all the time.  Mir-iam plucked the flowers lovingly, lingering over them.  He always  
  
  
<pb n="249"/>   
  
seemed to her too quick and almost scientific.  Yet his bunches  
had a natural beauty more than hers.  He loved them, but as if they  
were his and he had a right to them.  She had more, reverence for  
them: they held something she had not.  
</p><p>The flowers were very fresh and sweet.  He wanted to drink  
them.  As he gathered them, he ate the little yellow trumpets.  Clara  
was still wandering about disconsolately.  Going towards her, he said:  
</p><p>"Why don't you get some""  
</p><p>"I don't believe in it.  They look better growing."  
</p><p>"But you'd like some?"  
</p><p>"They want to be left."  
</p><p>"I don't believe they do."  
</p><p>"I don't want the corpses of flowers about me," she said.  
</p><p>"That's a stiff, artificial notion," he said.  "They don't die any  
quicker in water than on their roots.  And besides, they look nice in  
a bowl &mdash; they look jolly.  And you only call a thing a corpse because  
it looks corpse-like."  
</p><p>"Whether it is one or not?" she argued.  
</p><p>"It isn't one to me.  A dead flower isn't a corpse of a flower."  
</p><p>Clara now ignored him.  
</p><p>"And even so &mdash; what right have you to pull them?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Because I like them, and want them &mdash; and there's plenty of  
them."  
</p><p>"And that is sufficient?"  
</p><p>"Yes.  Why not? I'm sure they'd smell nice in your room in   
Nottingham."  
</p><p>"And I should have the pleasure of watching them die."  
</p><p>"But then-it does not matter if they do die."  
</p><p>Whereupon he left her, and went stooping over the clumps of  
tangled flowers which thickly sprinkled the field like pale,  
luminous foam-clots.  Miriam had come close.  Clara was kneeling,  
breathing some scent from the cowslips.  
</p><p>"I think," said Miriam, "if you treat them with reverence you  
don't do them any harm.  It is the spirit you pluck them in that matters."  
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  "But no, you get 'em because you want 'em,  
and that's all." He held out his bunch.  
</p><p>Miriam was silent.  He picked some more.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="250"/>   
  
<p>"Look at these!" he continued; "sturdy and lusty like little trees  
and like boys with fat legs."  
</p><p>Clara's hat lay on the grass not far off.  She was kneeling,   
bending forward still to smell the flowers.  Her neck gave him a sharp  
pang, such a beautiful thing, yet not proud of itself just now.  Her  
breasts swung slightly in her blouse.  The arching curve of her back  
was beautiful and strong; she wore no stays.  Suddenly, without  
knowing, he was scattering a handful of cowslips over her hair  
and neck, saying:  
 </p> 
<l>         "Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust,</l>  
<l>          If the Lord won't have you the devil must."</l>  
  
<p>The chill flowers fell on her neck.  She looked up at him, with  
almost pitiful, scared grey eyes, wondering what he was doing.   
Flowers fell on her face, and she shut her eyes.  
</p><p>Suddenly, standing there above her, he felt awkward.  
</p><p>"I thought you wanted a funeral," he said, in at ease.  
</p><p>Clara laughed strangely, and rose, picking the cowslips from  
her hair.  She took up her hat and pinned it on.  One flower had   
remained tangled in her hair.  He saw, but would not tell her.  He  
gathered up the flowers he had sprinkled over her.  
</p><p>At the edge of the wood the bluebells had flowed over into the  
field and stood there like flood-water.  But they were fading now.   
Clara strayed up to them.  He wandered after her.  The bluebells  
pleased him.  
</p><p>"Look how they've come out of the wood!" he said.  
</p><p>Then she turned with a flash of warmth and of gratitude.  
</p><p>"Yes," she smiled.  
</p><p>His blood beat up.  
</p><p>"It makes me think of the wild men of the woods, how terrified  
they would be when they got breast to breast with the open space."  
</p><p>"Do you think they were?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I wonder which was more frightened among old tribes &mdash; those  
bursting out of their darkness of woods upon all the space of light,  
or those from the open tiptoeing into the forests."  
</p><p>"I should think the second," she answered.  
</p><p>"Yes, you do feel like one of the open space sort, trying to force  
yourself into the dark, don't you?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="251"/>   
  
<p>"How should I know?" she answered queerly.  
</p><p>The conversation ended there.  
</p><p>The evening was deepening over the earth.  Already the valley  
was full of shadow.  One tiny square of light stood opposite at  
Crossleigh Bank Farm.  Brightness was swimming on the tops of  
the hills.  Miriam came up slowly, her face in her big, loose bunch  
of flowers, walking ankle-deep through the scattered froth of the  
cowslips.  Beyond her the trees were coming into shape, all  
shadow.  
</p><p>"Shall we go?" she asked.  
</p><p>And the three turned away.  They were all silent.  Going down  
the path they could see the light of home right across, and on the  
ridge of the hill a thin dark outline with little lights, where the  
colliery village touched the sky.  
</p><p>"It has been nice, hasn't it?" he asked.  
</p><p>Miriam murmured assent.  Clara was silent.  
</p><p>"Don't you think so?" he persisted.  
</p><p>But she walked with her head up, and still did not answer.  He  
could tell by the way she moved, as if she didn't care, that she  
suffered.  
</p><p>At this time Paul took his mother to Lincoln.  She was bright  
and enthusiastic as ever, but as he sat opposite her in the railway  
carriage, she seemed to look frail.  He had a momentary sensation  
as if she were slipping away from him.  Then he wanted to get hold  
of her, to fasten her, almost to chain her.  He felt he must keep  
hold of her with his hand.  
</p><p>They drew near to the city.  Both were at the window looking for  
the cathedral.  
</p><p>"There she is, mother!" he cried.  
</p><p>They saw the great cathedral lying couchant above the plain.  
</p><p>"Ah!" she exclaimed.  "So she is!"  
</p><p>He looked at his mother.  Her blue eyes were watching the  
cathedral quietly.  She seemed again to be beyond him.  Something  
in the eternal repose of the uplifted cathedral, blue and noble  
against the sky, was reflected in her, something of the fatality.   
What was, was.  With all his young will he could not alter it.  He  
saw her face, the skin still fresh and pink and downy, but crow's-feet near her eyes, her eyelids steady, sinking a little, her mouth  
  
  
<pb n="252"/>   
  
always closed with disillusion; and there was on her the same  
eternal look, as if she knew fate at last.  He beat against it with all  
the strength of his soul.  
</p><p>"Look, mother, how big she is above the town! Think, there are  
streets and streets below her! She looks bigger than the city altogether."  
</p><p>"So she does!" exclaimed his mother, breaking bright into life  
again.  But he had seen her sitting, looking steady out of the  
window at the cathedral, her face and eyes fixed, reflecting the  
relentlessness of life.  And the crow's-feet near her eyes, and her  
mouth shut so hard, made him feel he would go mad.  
</p><p>They ate a meal that she considered wildly extravagant'  
</p><p>"Don't imagine I like it," she said, as she ate her cutlet.  "I don't  
like it, I really don't! Just think of your money wasted!"  
</p><p>"You never mind my money," he said.  "You forget I'm a fellow   
taking his girl for an outing."  
</p><p>And he bought her some blue violets.  
</p><p>"Stop it at once, sir!" she commanded. "How can I do it?"  
</p><p>"You've got nothing to do.  Stand still!"  
</p><p>And in the middle of High Street he stuck the flowers in her  
coat.  
</p><p>"An old thing like me!" she said, sniffing.  
</p><p>"You see," he said, "I want people to think we're awful swells.   
So look ikey."  
</p><p>"I'll jowl your head," she laughed.  
</p><p>"Strut!" he commanded.  "Be a fantail pigeon."  
</p><p>It took him an hour to get her through the street.  She stood  
above Glory Hole, she stood before Stone Bow, she stood everywhere,   
and exclaimed.  
</p><p>A man came up, took off his hat, and bowed to her.  
</p><p>"Can I show you the town, madam?"  
</p><p>"No, thank you," she answered.  "I've got my son."  
</p><p>Then Paul was cross with her for not answering with more  
dignity.  
</p><p>"You go away with you!" she exclaimed.  "Ha! that's the  
Jew's House.  Now, do you remember that lecture, Paul &mdash; ?"  
</p><p>But she could scarcely climb the cathedral hill.  He did not  
notice.  Then suddenly he found her unable to speak.  He took her  
into a little public-house, where she rested.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="253"/>   
<p>"It's nothing," she said.  "My heart is only a bit old; one must  
expect it."  
</p><p>He did not answer, but looked at her.  Again his heart was  
crushed in a hot grip.  He wanted to cry, he wanted to smash things  
in fury.  
</p><p>They set off again, pace by pace, so slowly.  And every step  
seemed like a weight on his chest.  He felt as if his heart would  
burst.  At last they came to the top.  She stood enchanted, looking  
at the castle gate, looking at the cathedral front.  She had quite   
forgotten herself.  
</p><p>"Now this is better than I thought it could be!" she cried.  
</p><p>But he hated it.  Everywhere he followed her, brooding.  They  
sat together in the cathedral.  They attended a little service in the  
choir.  She was timid.  
</p><p>"I suppose it is open to anybody?" she asked him.  
</p><p>"Yes," he replied.  "Do you think they'd have the damned cheek  
to send us away."  
</p><p>"Well, I'm sure," she exclaimed, "they would if they heard your  
language."  
</p><p>Her face seemed to shine again with joy and peace during the  
service.  And all the time he was wanting to rage and smash things  
and cry.  
</p><p>Afterwards, when they were leaning over the wall, looking at  
the town below, he blurted suddenly:  
</p><p>"Why can't a man have a young mother? What is she old for?"  
</p><p>"Well," his mother laughed, "she can scarcely help it."  
</p><p>"And why wasn't I the oldest son? Look &mdash; they say the young  
ones have the advantage &mdash; but look, they had the young mother.   
</p><p>You should have had me for your eldest son."  
</p><p>"I didn't arrange it," she remonstrated.  "Come to consider,  
you're as much to blame as me."  
</p><p>He turned on her, white, his eyes furious.  
</p><p>"What are you old for!" he said, mad with his impotence.  "Why  
can't you walk? Why can't you come with me to places?"  
</p><p>"At one time," she replied, "I could have run up that hill a good  
deal better than you."  
</p><p>"What's the good of that to me?" he cried, hitting his fist on the  
wall.  Then he became plaintive.  "It's too bad of you to be ill, Little,  
it is &mdash; "</p>  
  
  
<pb n="254"/>   
  
<p>"Ill!" she cried.  "I'm a bit old, and you'll have to put up with it,  
that's all."  
</p><p>They were quiet.  But it was as much as they could bear.  They  
got jolly again over tea.  As they sat by Brayford, watching the  
boats, he told her about Clara.  His mother asked him innumerable  
questions.  
</p><p>"Then who does she live with?"  
</p><p>"With her mother, on Bluebell Hill."  
</p><p>"And have they enough to keep them?"  
</p><p>"I don't think so.  I think they do lace work."  
</p><p>"And wherein lies her charm, my boy?"  
</p><p>"I don't know that she's charming, mother.  But she's nice.  And  
she seems straight, you know &mdash; not a bit deep, not a bit."  
</p><p>"But she's a good deal older than you."  
</p><p>"She's thirty, I'm going on twenty-three."  
</p><p>"You haven't told me what you like her for."  
</p><p>"Because I don't know &mdash; a sort of defiant way she's got &mdash; a sort  
of angry way."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel considered.  She would have been glad now for her  
son to fall in love with some woman who would &mdash; she did not know  
what.  But he fretted so, got so furious suddenly, and again was  
melancholic.  She wished he knew some nice woman &mdash;  She did  
not know what she wished, but left it vague.  At any rate, she was  
not hostile to the idea of Clara.  
</p><p>Annie, too, was getting married.  Leonard had gone away to  
work in Birmingham.  One week-end when he was home she had  
said to him:  
</p><p>"You don't look very well, my lad."  
</p><p>"I dunno," he said.  "I feel anyhow or nohow, ma."  
</p><p>He called her "ma" already in his boyish fashion.   
</p><p>"Are you sure they're good lodgings?" she asked.   
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; yes.  Only &mdash; it's a winder when you have to pour your own  
tea out &mdash; an' nobody to grouse if you team it in your saucer and  
sup it up.  It somehow takes a' the taste out of it."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel laughed.  
</p><p>"And so it knocks you up?" she said.  
</p><p>"I dunno.  I want to get married," he blurted, twisting his fingers  
and looking down at his boots.  There was a silence.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="255"/>   
<p>"But," she exclaimed, "I thought you said you'd wait another  
year."  
</p><p>"Yes, I did say so," he replied stubbornly.  
</p><p>Again she considered.  
</p><p>"And you know," she said, "Annie's a bit of a spendthrift.   
She's saved no more than eleven pounds.  And I know, lad, you  
haven't had much chance."  
</p><p>He coloured up to the ears.  
</p><p>"I've got thirty-three quid," he said.  
</p><p>"It doesn't go far," she answered.  
</p><p>He said nothing, but twisted his fingers.  
</p><p>"And you know," she said, "I've nothing &mdash; "  
</p><p>"I didn't want, ma!" he cried, very red, suffering and  
remonstrating.  
</p><p>"No, my lad, I know.  I was only wishing I had.  And take away  
five pounds for the wedding and things &mdash; it leaves twenty-nine  
pounds.  You won't do much on that."  
</p><p>He twisted still, impotent, stubborn, not looking up.  
</p><p>"But do you really want to get married?" she asked.  "Do you  
feel as if you ought?"  
</p><p>He gave her one straight look from his blue eyes.  
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  
</p><p>"Then," she replied, "we must all do the best we can for it,  lad."  
</p><p>The next time he looked up there were tears in his eyes.  
</p><p>"I don't want Annie to feel handicapped," he said, struggling.  
</p><p>"My lad," she said, "you're steady &mdash; you've got a decent place.   
If a man had needed me I'd have married him on his last week's  
wages.  She may find it a bit hard to start humbly.  Young girls are  
like that.  They look forward to the fine home they think they'll  
have.  But I had expensive furniture.  It's not everything."  
</p><p>So the wedding took place almost immediately.  Arthur came  
home, and was splendid in uniform.  Annie looked nice in a dove-grey dress that she could take for Sundays.  Morel called her a fool  
for getting married, and was cool with his son-in-law.  Mrs. Morel  
had white tips in her bonnet, and some white on her blouse, and  
was teased by both her sons for fancying herself so grand.  Leonard  
was jolly and cordial, and felt a fearful fool.  Paul could not quite  
see what Annie wanted to get married for.  He was fond of her, and  
she of him.  Still, he hoped rather lugubriously that it would turn  
  
  
<pb n="256"/>   
  
out all right.  Arthur was astonishingly handsome in his scarlet and  
yellow, and he knew it well, but was secretly ashamed of the  
uniform.  Annie cried her eyes up in the kitchen, on leaving her  
mother.  Mrs. Morel cried a little, then patted her on the back and  
said:  
</p><p>"But don't cry, child, he'll be good to you."  
</p><p>Morel stamped and said she was a fool to go and tie herself up.   
Leonard looked white and overwrought.  Mrs. Morel said to him:  
</p><p>"I s'll trust her to you, my lad, and hold you responsible for  
her."  
</p><p>"You can," he said, nearly dead with the ordeal.  And it was all  
over.  
</p><p>When Morel and Arthur were in bed, Paul sat talking, as he  
often did, with his mother.  
</p><p>"You're not sorry she's married, mother, are you?" he asked.  
</p><p>"I'm not sorry she's married &mdash; but &mdash; it seems strange that she  
should go from me. it even seems to me hard that she can prefer  
to go with her Leonard.  That's how mothers are &mdash; I know it's  
silly."  
</p><p>"And shall you be miserable about her?"  
</p><p>"When I think of my own wedding day," his mother answered,  
"I can only hope her life will be different."  
</p><p>"But you can trust him to be good to her?"  
</p><p>"Yes, yes.  They say he's not good enough for her.  But I say if  
a man is genuine, as he is, and a girl is fond of him &mdash; then &mdash; it should  
be all right.  He's as good as she."  
</p><p>"So you don't mind?"  
</p><p>"I would never have let a daughter of mine marry a man  
didn't feel to be genuine through and through.  And yet, there's a  
gap now she's gone."  
</p><p>They were both miserable, and wanted her back again.  It  
seemed to Paul his mother looked lonely, in her new black silk  
blouse with its bit of white trimming.  
</p><p>"At any rate, mother, I s'll never marry," he said.  
</p><p>"Ay, they all say that, my lad.  You've not met the one yet.  Only  
wait a year or two."  
</p><p>"But I shan't marry, mother.  I shall live with you, and we'll have  
a servant."  
</p><p>"Ay, my lad, it's easy to talk.  We'll see when the time comes."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="257"/>   
<p>"What time? I'm nearly twenty-three."  
</p><p>"Yes, you're not one that would marry young.  But in three  
years' time &mdash; "  
</p><p>"I shall be with you just the same."  
</p><p>"We'll see, my boy, we'll see."  
</p><p>"But you don't want me to marry?"  
</p><p>"I shouldn't like to think of you going through your life without  
anybody to care for you and do &mdash; no."  
</p><p>"And you think I ought to marry?"  
</p><p>"Sooner or later every man ought."  
</p><p>"But you'd rather it were later."  
</p><p>"It would be hard &mdash; and very hard.  It's as they say:  
 </p> 
<l>        "'A son's my son till he takes him a wife,</l>  
<l>          But my daughter's my daughter the whole of her life.'"</l>  
  
<p>"And you think I'd let a wife take me from you?"  
</p><p>"Well, you wouldn't ask her to marry your mother as well as  
you," Mrs. Morel smiled.  
</p><p>"She could do what she liked; she wouldn't have to interfere."  
</p><p>"She wouldn't &mdash; till she'd got you &mdash; and then you'd see."  
</p><p>"I never will see.  I'll never marry while I've got you &mdash; I won't."  
</p><p>"But I shouldn't like to leave you with nobody, my boy," she  
cried.  
</p><p>"You're not going to leave me.  What are you? Fifty-three! I'll  
give you till seventy-five.  There you are, I'm fat and forty-four.   
Then I'll marry a staid body.  See!"  
</p><p>His mother sat and laughed.  
</p><p>"Go to bed," she said &mdash; "go to bed."  
</p><p>"And we'll have a pretty house, you and me, and a servant, and  
it'll be just all right.  I s'll perhaps be rich with my painting."  
</p><p>"Will you go to bed!"  
</p><p>"And then you s'll have a pony-carriage.  See yourself &mdash; a little  
Queen Victoria trotting round."  
</p><p>"I tell you to go to bed," she laughed.  
</p><p>He kissed her and went.  His plans for the future were always  
the same.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel sat brooding &mdash; about her daughter, about Paul, about  
Arthur.  She fretted at losing Annie.  The family was very closely  
  
  
<pb n="258"/>   
  
bound.  And she felt she must live now, to be with her children.   
Life was so rich for her.  Paul wanted her, and so did Arthur.   
Arthur never knew how deeply he loved her.  He was a creature of  
the moment.  Never yet had he been forced to realise himself.  The  
army had disciplined his body, but not his soul.  He was in perfect  
health and very handsome.  His dark, vigorous hair sat close to his  
smallish head.  There was something childish about his nose, something   
almost girlish about his dark blue eyes.  But he had the fun  
red mouth of a man under his brown moustache, and his jaw was  
strong.  It was his father's mouth; it was the nose and eyes of her  
own mother's people &mdash; good-looking, weak-principled folk.  Mrs.  
Morel was anxious about him.  Once he had really run the rig he  
was safe.  But how far would he go?  
</p><p>The army had not really done him any good.  He resented bitterly   
the authority of the officers.  He hated having to obey as if he  
were an animal.  But he had too much sense to kick.  So he turned  
his attention to getting the best out of it.  He could sing, he was a  
boon-companion.  Often he got into scrapes, but they were the  
manly scrapes that are easily condoned.  So he made a good time  
out of it, whilst his self-respect was in suppression.  He trusted to  
his good looks and handsome figure, his refinement, his decent  
education to get him most of what he wanted, and he was not disappointed.    
Yet he was restless.  Something seemed to gnaw him  
inside.  He was never still, he was never alone.  With his mother he  
was rather humble.  Paul he admired and loved and despised  
slightly.  And Paul admired and loved and despised him slightly.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel had had a few pounds left to her by her father, and  
she decided to buy her son out of the army.  He was wild with joy.   
Now he was like a lad taking a holiday.  
</p><p>He had always been fond of Beatrice Wyld, and during his  
furlough he picked up with her again.  She was stronger and better  
in health.  The two often went long walks together, Arthur taking  
her arm in soldier's fashion, rather stiffly.  And she came to play  
the piano whilst he sang.  Then Arthur would unhook his tunic  
collar.  He grew flushed, his eyes were bright, he sang in a manly  
tenor.  Afterwards they sat together on the sofa.  He seemed to  
flaunt his body: she was aware of him so &mdash; the strong chest, the  
sides, the thighs in their close-fitting trousers.  
</p><p>He liked to lapse into the dialect when he talked to her. She  
  
<pb n="259"/>   
would sometimes smoke with him.  Occasionally she would only  
take a few whiffs at his cigarette.  
</p><p>"Nay," he said to her one evening, when she reached for his  
cigarette.  "Nay, tha doesna.  I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss if ter's a  
mind."  
</p><p>"I wanted a whiff, no kiss at all," she answered.  
</p><p>"Well, an' tha s'lt ha'e a whiff," he said, "along wi' t' kiss."  
</p><p>"I want a draw at thy fag," she cried, snatching for the cigarette  
between his lips.  
</p><p>He was sitting with his shoulder touching her.  She was small and  
quick as lightning.  He just escaped.  
</p><p>"I'll gi'e thee a smoke kiss,"  he said.  
</p><p>"Tha'rt a knivey nuisance, Arty  Morel,"  she  said,  sitting  back.  
</p><p>"Ha'e a smoke kiss?"  
</p><p>The soldier leaned forward to her, smiling.  His face was near  
hers.  
</p><p>"Shonna!" she replied, turning away her head.  
</p><p>He took a draw at his cigarette, and pursed up his mouth, and  
put his lips close to her.  His dark-brown cropped moustache stood  
out like a brush.  She looked at the puckered crimson lips, then  
suddenly snatched the cigarette from his fingers and darted away.   
He, leaping after her, seized the comb from her back hair.  She  
turned, threw the cigarette at him.  He picked it up, put it in his  
mouth, and sat down.  
</p><p>"Nuisance!" she cried.  "Give me my comb!"  
</p><p>She was afraid that her hair, specially done for him, would come  
down.  She stood with her hands to her head.  He hid the comb between   
his knees.  
</p><p>"I've non got it," he said.  
</p><p>The cigarette trembled between his lips with laughter as he  
spoke.  
</p><p>"Liar!" she said.  
</p><p>"'S true as I'm here!" he laughed, showing his hands.  
</p><p>"You brazen imp!" she exclaimed, rushing and scuffling for the  
comb, which he had under his knees.  As she wrestled with him,  
pulling at his smooth, tight-covered knees, he laughed till he lay  
back on the sofa shaking with laughter.  The cigarette fell from his  
mouth almost singeing his throat.  Under his delicate tan the blood  
flushed up, and he laughed till his blue eyes were blinded, his  
  
  
<pb n="260"/>   
  
throat swollen almost to choking.  Then he sat up.  Beatrice  
was putting in her comb.  
</p><p>"Tha tickled me, Beat," he said thickly.  
</p><p>Like a flash her small white hand went out and smacked his  
face.  He started up, glaring at her.  They stared at each other.   
Slowly the flush mounted her cheek, she dropped her eyes, then  
her head.  He sat down sulkily.  She went into the scullery to adjust  
her hair.  In private there she shed a few tears, she did not know  
what for.  
</p><p>When she returned she was pursed up close.  But it was only a  
film over her fire.  He, with ruffled hair, was sulking upon the sofa.   
She sat down opposite, in the arm-chair, and neither spoke.  The  
clock ticked in the silence like blows.  
</p><p>"You are a little cat, Beat," he said at length, half apologetically.  
</p><p>"Well, you shouldn't be brazen," she replied.  
</p><p>There was again a long silence.  He whistled to himself like a  
man much agitated but defiant.  Suddenly she went across to him  
and kissed him.  
</p><p>"Did it, pore fing!" she mocked.  
</p><p>He lifted his face, smiling curiously.  
</p><p>"Kiss?" he invited her.  
</p><p>"Daren't I?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Go on!" he challenged, his mouth lifted to her.  
</p><p>Deliberately, and with a peculiar quivering smile that seemed to  
overspread her whole body, she put her mouth on his.  Immediately   
his arms folded round her.  As soon as the long kiss was  
finished she drew back her bead from him, put her delicate fingers  
on his neck, through the open collar.  Then she closed her eyes,  
giving herself up again in a kiss.  
</p><p>She acted of her own free will.  What she would do she did, and  
made nobody responsible.  
</p><p>Paul felt life changing around him.  The conditions of youth  
were gone.  Now it was a home of grown-up people.  Annie was a  
married woman, Arthur was following his own pleasure in a way  
unknown to his folk.  For so tong they had all lived at home, and  
gone out to pass their time.  But now, for Annie and Arthur, life  
lay outside their mother's house.  They came home for holiday and  
for rest.  So there was that strange, half-empty feeling about the  
  
  
<pb n="261"/>   
  
house, as if the birds had flown.  Paul became more and more unsettled.    
Annie and Arthur had gone.  He was restless to follow.   
Yet home was for him beside his mother.  And still there was something   
else, something outside, something he wanted.  
</p><p>He grew more and more restless.  Miriam did not satisfy him.   
His old mad desire to be with her grew weaker.  Sometimes he  
met Clara in Nottingham, sometimes he went to meetings with  
her, sometimes he saw her at Willey Farm.  But on these last occasions   
the situation became strained.  There was a triangle of  
antagonism between Paul and Clara and Miriam.  With Clara he  
took on a smart, worldly, mocking tone very antagonistic to  
Miriam.  It did not matter what went before.  She might be intimate  
and sad with him.  Then as soon as Clara appeared, it all vanished,  
and he played to the newcomer.  
</p><p>Miriam had one beautiful evening with him in the hay.  He had  
been on the horse-rake, and having finished, came to help her to  
put the hay in cocks.  Then he talked to her of his hopes and  
despairs, and his whole soul seemed to lie bare before her.  She  
felt as if she watched the very quivering stuff of life in him.  The  
moon came out: they walked home together: he seemed to have  
come to her because he needed her so badly, and she listened to  
him, gave him all her love and her faith.  It seemed to her he  
brought her the best of himself to keep, and that she would guard  
it all her life.  Nay, the sky did not cherish the stars more surely  
and eternally than she would guard the good in the soul of Paul  
Morel.  She went on home alone, feeling exalted, glad in her faith.  
</p><p>And then, the next day, Clara came.  They were to have tea in  
the hayfield.  Miriam watched the evening drawing to gold and  
shadow.  And all the time Paul was sporting with Clara.  He made  
higher and higher heaps of hay that they were jumping over.   
Miriam did not care for the game, and stood aside.  Edgar and  
Geoffrey and Maurice and Clara and Paul jumped.  Paul won, because   
he was light.  Clara's blood was roused.  She could ran like  
an Amazon.  Paul loved the determined way she rushed at the haycock   
and leaped, landed on the other side, her breasts shaken, her  
thick hair come undone.  
</p><p>"You touched!" he cried.  "You touched!"  
</p><p>"No!" she flashed, turning to Edgar.  "I didn't touch, did I?  
Wasn't I clear?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="262"/>   
  
<p>"I couldn't say," laughed Edgar.  
</p><p>None of them could say.  
</p><p>"But you touched," said Paul.  "You're beaten."  
</p><p>"I did not touch!" she cried.  
</p><p>"As plain as anything," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Box his ears for me!" she cried to Edgar.  
</p><p>"Nay," Edgar laughed.  "I daren't.  You must do it  
yourself."  
</p><p>"And nothing can alter the fact that you  
touched," laughed Paul.  
</p><p>She was furious with him.  Her little triumph before these lads  
and men was gone.  She had forgotten herself in the game.  Now he  
was to humble her.  
</p><p>"I think you are despicable!" she said.  
</p><p>And again he laughed, in a way that tortured Miriam.  
</p><p>"And I knew you couldn't jump that heap," he teased.  
</p><p>She turned her back on him.  Yet everybody could see that the  
only person she listened to, or was conscious of, was he, and he  
of her.  It pleased the men to see this battle between them.   
But Miriam was tortured.  
</p><p>Paul could choose the lesser in place of the higher, she saw.   
He could be unfaithful to himself, unfaithful to the real, deep Paul  
Morel.  There was a danger of his becoming frivolous, of his running   
after his satisfaction like any Arthur, or like his father.  It  
made Miriam bitter to think that he should throw away his soul  
for this flippant traffic of triviality with Clara.  She walked in   
bitterness and silence, while the other two rallied each other, and  
Paul sported.  
</p><p>And afterwards, he would not own it, but he was rather  
ashamed of himself, and prostrated himself before Miriam.  Then  
again he rebelled.  
</p><p>"It's not religious to be religious," he said.  "I reckon a crow  
is religious when it sails across the sky.  But it only does it because  
it feels itself carried to where it's going, not because it thinks it is  
being eternal."  
</p><p>But Miriam knew that one should be religious in everything,  
have God, whatever God might be, present in everything.  
</p><p>"I don't believe God knows such a lot about Himself," he cried.   
"God doesn't know things, He is things.  And I'm sure He's not  
soulful."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="263"/>   
  
<p>And then it seemed to her that Paul was arguing God on to his  
own side, because he wanted his own way and his own pleasure.   
There was a long battle between him and her.  He was utterly unfaithful   
to her even in her own presence; then he was ashamed,  
then repentant; then he hated her, and went off again.  Those were  
the ever-recurring conditions.  
</p><p>She fretted him to the bottom of his soul.  There she remained  
&mdash; sad, pensive, a worshipper.  And he caused her sorrow.  Half the  
time he grieved for her, half the time he hated her.  She was his  
conscience; and he felt, somehow, he had got a conscience that  
was too much for him.  He could not leave her, because in one way  
she did hold the best of him.  He could not stay with her  
because she did not take the rest of him, which was three-quarters.  So he  
chafed himself into rawness over her.  
</p><p>When she was twenty-one he wrote her a letter which could  
only have been written to her.  
</p><p>"May I speak of our old, worn love, this last time.  It, too, is  
changing, is it not? Say, has not the body of that love died, and  
left you its invulnerable soul? You see, I can give you a spirit love,  
I have given it you this long, long time; but not embodied passion.   
See, you are a nun.  I have given you what I would give a holy nun  
&mdash; as a mystic monk to a mystic nun.  Surely you esteem it best.  Yet  
you regret &mdash; no, have regretted &mdash; the other.  In all our relations no  
body enters.  I do not talk to you through the senses &mdash; rather  
through the spirit.  That is why we cannot love in the common  
sense.  Ours is not an everyday affection.  As yet we are mortal,  
and to live side by side with one another would be dreadful, for  
somehow with you I cannot long be trivial, and, you know, to be  
always beyond this mortal state would be to lose it.  If people  
marry, they must live together as affectionate humans, who may be  
commonplace with each other without feeling awkward &mdash; not as  
two souls.  So I feel it.  
</p><p>"Ought I to send this letter? &mdash; I doubt it.  But there &mdash; it is best to  
understand.  Au revoir."  
</p><p>Miriam read this letter twice, after which she sealed it up.  A  
year later she broke the seal to show her mother the letter.  
</p><p>"You are a nun &mdash; you are a nun." The words went into her heart  
  
  
<pb n="264"/>   
  
again and again.  Nothing he ever had said had gone into her so  
deeply, fixedly, like a mortal wound.  
</p><p>She answered him two days after the party.  
</p><p>"'Our intimacy would have been all &mdash; beautiful but for one little  
mistake,"' she quoted.  "Was the mistake mine?"  
</p><p>Almost immediately he replied to her from Nottingham, sending   
her at the same time a little "Omar Khayyam".  
</p><p>"I am glad you answered; you are so calm and natural you put  
me to shame.  What a ranter I am! We are often out of sympathy.   
But in fundamentals we may always be together I think.  
</p><p>"I must thank you for your sympathy with my painting and  
drawing.  Many a sketch is dedicated to you.  I do look forward to  
your criticisms, which, to my shame and glory, are always grand  
appreciations.  It is a lovely joke, that.  Au revoir."  
</p><p>This was the end of the first phase of Paul's love affair.  He was  
now about twenty-three years old, and, though still virgin, the sex  
instinct that Miriam had over-refined for so long now grew  
particularly strong.  Often, as he talked to Clara Dawes, came that  
thickening and quickening of his blood, that peculiar concentration   
in the breast, as if something were alive there, a new self or a  
new centre of consciousness, warning him that sooner or later he  
would have to ask one woman or another.  But he belonged to  
Miriam.  Of that she was so fixedly sure that he allowed her right.</p>  
  
  
</div2><div2 type="chapter" n="10" id="d16">  
<head>"Clara" </head> 
  
  
<p>WHEN he was twenty-three years old, Paul sent in a landscape to  
the winter exhibition at Nottingham Castle.  Miss Jordan had taken  
a good deal of interest in him, and invited him to her house, where  
he met other artists.  He was beginning to grow ambitious.  
</p><p>One morning the postman came just as he was washing in the  
scullery.  Suddenly he heard a wild noise from his mother.  Rushing  
into the kitchen, he found her standing on the hearth-rug wildly  
waving a letter and crying "Hurrah!" as if she had gone mad.  He  
was shocked and frightened.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="265"/>   
<p>"Why, mother!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>She flew to him, flung her arms round him for a moment, then  
waved the letter, crying:  
</p><p>"Hurrah, my boy! I knew we should do it!"  
</p><p>He was afraid of her &mdash; the small, severe woman with graying  
hair suddenly bursting out in such frenzy.  The postman came running   
back, afraid something had happened.  They saw his tipped  
cap over the short curtains.  Mrs. Morel rushed to the door.  
</p><p>"His picture's got first prize, Fred," she cried, "and is sold for  
twenty guineas."  
</p><p>"My word, that's something like!" said the young postman,  
whom they had known all his life.  
</p><p>"And Major Moreton has bought it!" she cried.  
</p><p>"It looks like meanin' something, that does, Mrs. Morel," said  
the postman, his blue eyes bright.  He was glad to have brought such  
a lucky letter.  Mrs. Morel went indoors and sat down, trembling.   
Paul was afraid lest she might have misread the letter, and might  
be disappointed after all.  He scrutinised it once, twice.  Yes, he  
became convinced it was true.  Then he sat down, his heart beating   
with joy.  
</p><p>"Mother!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>"Didn't I say we should do it!" she said, pretending she was not  
crying.  
</p><p>He took the kettle off the fire and mashed the tea.  
</p><p>"You didn't think, mother &mdash; " he began tentatively.  
</p><p>"No, my son &mdash; not so much &mdash; but I expected a good deal."  
</p><p>"But not so much," he said.  
</p><p>"No &mdash; no &mdash; but I knew we should do it."  
</p><p>And then she recovered her composure, apparently at least.  
He sat with his shirt turned back, showing his young throat almost  
like a girl's, and the towel in his hand, his hair sticking up wet.  
</p><p>"Twenty guineas, mother! That's just what you wanted to buy  
Arthur out.  Now you needn't borrow any.  It'll just do."  
</p><p>"Indeed, I shan't take it all," she said.  
</p><p>"But why?"  
</p><p>"Because I shan't."  
</p><p>"Well &mdash; you have twelve pounds, I'll have nine."  
</p><p>They cavilled about sharing the twenty guineas.  She wanted to  
  
  
<pb n="266"/>   
  
take only the five pounds she needed.  He would not hear of it.  So  
they got over the stress of emotion by quarrelling.  
</p><p>Morel came home at night from the pit, saying:  
</p><p>"They tell me Paul's got first prize for his picture, and sold it to  
Lord Henry Bentley for fifty pound."  
</p><p>"Oh, what stories people do tell!" she cried.  
</p><p>"Ha!" he answered.  "I said I wor sure it wor a lie.  But they said  
tha'd told Fred Hodgkisson."  
</p><p>"As if I would tell him such stuff!"  
</p><p>"Ha!" assented the miner.  
</p><p>But he was disappointed nevertheless.  
</p><p>"It's true he has got the first prize," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>The miner sat heavily in his chair.  
</p><p>"Has he, beguy!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>He stared across the room fixedly.  
</p><p>"But as for fifty pounds &mdash; such nonsense!" She was silent awhile.  
"Major Moreton bought it for twenty guineas, that's true."  
</p><p>"Twenty guineas! Tha niver says!" exclaimed Morel.  
</p><p>"Yes, and it was worth it."  
</p><p>"Ay!" he said.  "I don't misdoubt it.  But twenty guineas for a  
bit of a paintin' as he knocked off in an hour or two!"  
</p><p>He was silent with conceit of his son.  Mrs. Morel sniffed, as if  
it were nothing.  
</p><p>"And when does he handle th' money?" asked the collier.  
</p><p>"That I couldn't tell you.  When the picture is sent home, I  
suppose."  
</p><p>There was silence.  Morel stared at the sugar-basin instead of  
eating his dinner.  His black arm, with the hand all gnarled with  
work lay on the table.  His wife pretended not to see him rub the  
back of his hand across his eyes, nor the smear in the coal-dust on  
his black face.  
</p><p>"Yes, an' that other lad 'ud 'a done as much if they hadna ha!  
killed 'im," he said quietly.  
</p><p>The thought of William went through Mrs. Morel like a cold  
blade.  It left her feeling she was tired, and wanted rest.  
</p><p>Paul was invited to dinner at Mr. Jordan's.  Afterwards he said:  
</p><p>"Mother, I want an evening suit."  
</p><p>"Yes, I was afraid you would," she said.  She was glad.  There  
was a moment or two of silence.  "There's that one of William's,"  
  
  
<pb n="267"/>   
she continued, "that I know cost four pounds ten and which he'd  
only worn three times."  
</p><p>"Should you like me to wear it, mother?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes.  I think it would fit you &mdash; at least the coat.  The trousers  
would want shortening."  
</p><p>He went upstairs and put on the coat and vest.  Coming down,  
he looked strange in a flannel collar and a flannel shirt-front, with  
an evening coat and vest.  It was rather large.  
</p><p>"The tailor can make it right," she said, smoothing her hand  
over his shoulder.  "It's beautiful stuff.  I never could find in my  
heart to let your father wear the trousers, and very glad I am now."  
</p><p>And as she smoothed her hand over the silk collar she thought  
of her eldest son.  But this son was living enough inside the clothes.   
She passed her hand down his back to feel him.  He was alive and  
hers.  The other was dead.  
</p><p>He went out to dinner several times in his evening suit that had  
been William's.  Each time his mother's heart was firm with pride  
and joy.  He was started now.  The studs she and the children had  
bought for William were in his shirt-front; he wore one of William's   
dress shirts.  But he had an elegant figure.  His face was  
rough, but warm-looking and rather pleasing.  He did not look  
particularly a gentleman, but she thought he looked quite a man.  
</p><p>He told her everything that took place, everything that was said.   
It was as if she had been there.  And he was dying to introduce her  
to these new friends who had dinner at seven-thirty in the evening.  
</p><p>"Go along with you!" she said.  "What do they want to know me  
for?"  
</p><p>"They  do!" he cried indignantly.  "If they  
want to know me &mdash; and they say they do &mdash; then they want to know   
you, because you are quite as clever as I am.  "  
</p><p>"Go along with you, child! " she laughed.  
</p><p>But she began to spare her hands.  They, too, were work-gnarled  
now.  The skin was shiny with so much hot water, the knuckles  
rather swollen.  But she began to be careful to keep them out of  
soda.  She regretted what they had been &mdash; so small and exquisite.   
And when Annie insisted on her having more stylish blouses to  
suit her age, she submitted.  She even went so far as to allow a black  
velvet bow to be placed on her hair.  Then she sniffed in her  
sarcastic manner, and was sure she looked a sight.  But she looked  
  
  
<pb n="268"/>   
  
a lady, Paul declared, as much as Mrs. Major Moreton, and far,  
far nicer.  The family was coming on.  Only Morel remained   
unchanged, or rather, lapsed slowly.  
</p><p>Paul and his mother now had long discussions about life.    
Religion was fading into the background.  He had shovelled away an  
the beliefs that would hamper him, had cleared the ground, and  
come more or less to the bedrock of belief that one should feel  
inside oneself for right and wrong, and should have the patience to  
gradually realise one's God.  Now life interested him more.  
</p><p>"You know," he said to his mother, "I don't want to belong to  
the well-to-do middle class.  I like my common people best.  I belong   
to the common people."  
</p><p>"But if anyone else said so, my son, wouldn't you be in a tear.   
You know you consider yourself equal to any gentleman."  
</p><p>"In myself," he answered, "not in my class or my education or  
my manners.  But in myself I am."  
</p><p>"Very well, then.  Then why talk about the common people?"  
</p><p>"Because &mdash; the difference between people isn't in their class,  
but in themselves.  Only from the middle classes one gets ideas,  
and from the common people &mdash; life itself, warmth.  You feel their  
hates and loves."  
</p><p>"It's all very well, my boy.  But, then, why don't you go and talk  
to your father's pals?"  
</p><p>"But they're rather different."  
</p><p>"Not at all.  They're the common people.  After all, whom do  
you mix with now-among the common people? Those that exchange   
ideas, like the middle classes.  The rest don't interest you."  
</p><p>"But &mdash; there's the life &mdash; "  
</p><p>"I don't believe there's a jot more life from Miriam than you  
could get from any educated girl &mdash; say Miss Moreton.  It is you  
who are snobbish about class."  
</p><p>She frankly wanted him to climb into the middle classes, a thing  
not very difficult, she knew.  And she wanted him in the end  
to marry a lady.  
</p><p>Now she began to combat him in his restless fretting.  He still  
kept up his connection with Miriam, could neither break free nor  
go the whole length of engagement.  And this indecision seemed  
to bleed him of his energy.  Moreover, his mother suspected him  
of an unrecognised leaning towards Clara, and, since the latter  
  
  
<pb n="269"/>   
  
was a married woman, she wished he would fall in love with one  
of the girls in a better station of life.  But he was stupid, and would  
refuse to love or even to admire a girl much, just because she was  
his social superior.  
</p><p>"My boy," said his mother to him, "all your cleverness, your  
breaking away from old things, and taking fife in your own hands,  
doesn't seem to bring you much happiness."  
</p><p>"What is happiness!" he cried.  "It's nothing to me! How am  
I to be happy?"  
</p><p>The plump question disturbed her.  
</p><p>"That's for you to judge, my lad.  But if you could meet some  
good woman who would make you happy &mdash; and you began to think  
of settling your life &mdash; when you have the means &mdash; so that you could  
work without all this fretting &mdash; it would be much better for you."  
</p><p>He frowned.  His mother caught him on the raw of his wound  
of Miriam.  He pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead, his eyes  
full of pain and fire.  
</p><p>"You mean easy, mother," he cried.  "That's a woman's whole  
doctrine for life &mdash; ease of soul and physical comfort.  And I do   
despise it."  
</p><p>"Oh, do you!" replied his mother.  "And do you call yours a  
divine discontent?"  
</p><p>"Yes.  I don't care about its divinity.  But damn your happiness!  
So long as life's full, it doesn't matter whether it's happy or not.   
I'm afraid your happiness would bore me."  
</p><p>"You never give it a chance," she said.  Then suddenly all her  
passion of grief over him broke out.  "But it does matter!" she  
cried.  "And you ought to be happy, you ought to try to be happy,  
to live to be happy.  How could I bear to think your life wouldn't  
be a happy one!"  
</p><p>"Your own's been bad enough, mater, but it hasn't left you so  
much worse off than the folk who've been happier.  I reckon you've  
done well.  And I am the same.  Aren't I well enough off?"  
</p><p>"You're not, my son.  Battle &mdash; battle &mdash; and suffer.    
It's about all you do, as far as I can see."  
</p><p>"But why not, my dear? I tell you it's the best &mdash; "  
</p><p>"It isn't.  And one ought to be happy, one ought."  
</p><p>By this time Mrs. Morel was trembling violently.  Struggles of  
this kind often took place between her and her son, when she  
  
  
<pb n="270"/>   
  
seemed to fight for his very life against his own will to die.  He  took  
her in his arms.  She was ill and pitiful.  
</p><p>"Never mind, Little," he murmured.  "So long as you don't feel  
life's paltry and a miserable business, the rest doesn't matter,   
happiness or unhappiness."  
</p><p>She pressed him to her.  
</p><p>"But I want you to be happy," she said pathetically.  
</p><p>"Eh, my dear &mdash; say rather you want me to live."  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel felt as if her heart would break for him.  At this rate  
she knew he would not live.  He had that poignant carelessness  
about himself, his own suffering, his own life, which is a form of  
slow suicide.  It almost broke her heart.  With all the passion of  
her strong nature she hated Miriam for having in this subtle way  
undermined his joy.  It did not matter to her that Miriam could not  
help it.  Miriam did it, and she hated her.  
</p><p>She wished so much he would fall in love with a girl equal to be  
his mate &mdash; educated and strong.  But he would not look at anybody  
above him in station.  He seemed to like Mrs. Dawes.  At any rate  
that feeling was wholesome.  His mother prayed and prayed for  
him, that he might not be wasted.  That was all her prayer &mdash; not for  
his soul or his righteousness, but that he might not be wasted.  And  
while he slept, for hours and hours she thought and prayed for him.  
</p><p>He drifted away from Miriam imperceptibly, without knowing  
he was going.  Arthur only left the army to be married.  The baby  
was born six months after his wedding.  Mrs. Morel got him a job  
under the firm again, at twenty-one shillings a week.  She furnished  
for him, with the help of Beatrice's mother, a little cottage of two  
rooms.  He was caught now.  It did not matter how he kicked and  
struggled, he was fast.  For a time he chafed, was irritable with his  
young wife, who loved him; he went almost distracted when the  
baby, which was delicate, cried or gave trouble.  He grumbled for  
hours to his mother.  She only said: "Well, my lad, you did it   
yourself, now you must make the best of it." And then the grit came  
out in him.  He buckled to work, undertook his responsibilities,  
acknowledged that he belonged to his wife and child, and did make  
a good best of it.  He had never been very closely inbound into the  
family.  Now he was gone altogether.  
</p><p>The months went slowly along.  Paul had more or less got into  
connection with the Socialist, Suffragette, Unitarian people in Nottingham,  
  
  
<pb n="271"/>   
owing to his acquaintance with Clara.  One day a friend of  
his and of Clara's, in Bestwood, asked him to take a message to  
Mrs. Dawes.  He went in the evening across Sneinton Market to  
Bluebell Hill.  He found the house in a mean little street paved  
with granite cobbles and having causeways of dark blue, grooved  
bricks.  The front door went up a step from off this rough pavement,   
where the feet of the passersby rasped and clattered.  The  
brown paint on the door was so old that the naked wood showed  
between the rents.  He stood on the street below and knocked.  There  
came a heavy footstep; a large, stout woman of about sixty towered  
above him.  He looked up at her from the pavement.  She had a  
rather severe face.  
</p><p>She admitted him into the parlour, which opened on to the street.   
It was a small, stuffy, defunct room, of mahogany, and deathly   
enlargements of photographs of departed people done in carbon.   
Mrs. Radford left him.  She was stately, almost martial.  In a moment  
Clara appeared.  She flushed deeply, and he was covered with confusion.    
It seemed as if she did not like being discovered in her  
home circumstances.  
</p><p>"I thought it couldn't be your voice," she said.  
</p><p>But she might as well be hung for a sheep as for a lamb.  She   
invited him out of the mausoleum of a parlour into the kitchen.  
</p><p>That was a little, darkish room too, but it was smothered in  
white lace.  The mother had seated herself again by the cupboard,  
and was drawing thread from a vast web of lace.  A clump of fluff  
and ravelled cotton was at her right hand, a heap of three-quarter-inch lace lay on her left, whilst in front of her was the mountain  
of lace web, piling the hearthrug.  Threads of curly cotton, pulled  
out from between the lengths of lace, strewed over the fender and  
the fireplace.  Paul dared not go forward, for fear of treading on  
piles of white stuff.  
</p><p>On the table was a jenny for carding the lace.  There was a pack  
of brown cardboard squares, a pack of cards of lace, a little box  
of pins, and on the sofa lay a heap of drawn lace.  
</p><p>The room was all lace, and it was so dark and warm that the  
white, snowy stuff seemed the more distinct.  
</p><p>"If you're coming in you won't have to mind the work," said Mrs.  
Radford.  "I know we're about blocked up.  But sit you down."  
</p><p>Clara, much embarrassed, gave him a chair against the wall opposite  
  
<pb n="272"/>   
  
the white heaps.  Then she herself took her place on the  
sofa, shamedly.  
</p><p>"Will you drink a bottle of stout?" Mrs. Radford asked.  "Clara,  
get him a bottle of stout."  
</p><p>He protested, but Mrs. Radford insisted.  
</p><p>"You look as if you could do with it," she said.  "Haven't you  
never any more colour than that?"  
</p><p>"It's only a thick skin I've got that doesn't show the blood  
through," he answered.  
</p><p>Clara, ashamed and chagrined, brought him a bottle of stout  
and a glass.  He poured out some of the black stuff.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, lifting the glass, "here's health!"  
</p><p>"And thank you," said Mrs. Radford.  
</p><p>He took a drink of stout.  
</p><p>"And light yourself a cigarette, so long as you don't set the house  
on fire," said Mrs. Radford.  
</p><p>"Thank you," he replied.  
</p><p>"Nay, you needn't thank me," she answered.  "I s'll be glad to  
smell a bit of smoke in th' 'ouse again.  A house o' women is as  
dead as a house wi' no fire, to my thinkin'.  I'm not a spider as likes  
a comer to myself.  I like a man about, if he's only something to  
snap at."  
</p><p>Clara began to work.  Her jenny spun with a subdued buzz; the  
white lace hopped from between her fingers on to the card.  It was  
filled; she snipped off the length, and pinned the end down to the  
banded lace.  Then she put a new card in her jenny.  Paul watched  
her.  She sat square and magnificent.  Her throat and arms were  
bare.  The blood still mantled below her ears; she bent her head in  
shame of her humility.  Her face was set on her work.  Her arms  
were creamy and full of life beside the white lace; her large, well-kept hands worked with a balanced movement, as if nothing would  
hurry them.  He, not knowing, watched her all the time.  He saw the  
arch of her neck from the shoulder, as she bent her head; he saw  
the coil of dun hair; he watched her moving, gleaming arms.  
</p><p>"I've heard a bit about you from Clara," continued the mother.   
"You're in Jordan's, aren't you?" She drew her lace unceasing.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"Ay, well, and I can remember when Thomas Jordan used to  
ask me for one of my toffies."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="273"/>   
<p>"Did he?" laughed Paul.  "And did he get it?"  
</p><p>"Sometimes he did, sometimes he didn't &mdash; which was latterly. For  
he's the sort that takes an and gives naught, he is &mdash; or used to be."  
</p><p>"I think he's very decent," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Yes; well, I'm glad to hear it."  
</p><p>Mrs. Radford looked across at him steadily.  There was something   
determined about her that he liked.  Her face was falling loose,  
but her eyes were calm, and there was something strong in her that  
made it seem she was not old; merely her wrinkles and loose cheeks  
were an anachronism.  She had the strength and sang-froid of a  
woman in the prime of life.  She continued drawing the lace with  
slow, dignified movements.  The big web came up inevitably over  
her apron; the length of lace fell away at her side.  Her arms were  
finely shapen, but glossy and yellow as old ivory.  They had not the  
peculiar dull gleam that made Clara's so fascinating to him.  
</p><p>"And you've been going with Miriam Leivers?" the mother  
asked him.  
</p><p>"Well &mdash; " he answered.  
</p><p>"Yes, she's a nice girl," she continued.  "She's very nice, but  
she's a bit too much above this world to suit my fancy."  
</p><p>"She is a bit liike that," he agreed.  
</p><p>"She'll never be satisfied till she's got wings and can fly over  
everybody's head, she won't," she said.  
</p><p>Clara broke in, and be told her his message.  She spoke humbly  
to him.  He had surprised her in her drudgery.  To have her humble  
made him feel as if he were lifting his head in expectation.  
</p><p>"Do you like jennying?" be asked.  
</p><p>"What can a woman do!" she replied bitterly.  
</p><p>"Is it sweated?"  
</p><p>"More or less.  Isn't all woman's work? That's another trick the  
men have played, since we force ourselves into the labour market."  
</p><p>"Now then, you shut up about the men," said her mother.  "If  
the women wasn't fools, the men wouldn't be bad uns, that's what  
I say.  No man was ever that bad wi' me but what he got it back  
again.  Not but what they're a lousy lot, there's no denying it."  
</p><p>"But they're all right really, aren't they?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Well, they're a bit different from women," she answered.   
</p><p>"Would you care to be back at Jordan's?" he asked Clara.   
</p><p>"I don't think so," she replied.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="274"/>   
  
<p>"Yes, she would!" cried her mother; "thank her stars if she could  
get back.  Don't you listen to her.  She's for ever on that 'igh horse  
of hers, an' it's back's that thin an' starved it'll cut her in two one  
of these days."  
</p><p>Clara suffered badly from her mother.  Paul felt as if his eyes  
were coming very wide open.  Wasn't he to take Clara's fulminations  
so seriously, after an? She spun steadily at her work.  He experienced   
a thrill of joy, thinking she might need his help.  She seemed  
denied and deprived of so much.  And her arm moved mechanically,   
that should never have been subdued to a mechanism, and  
her head was bowed to the lace, that never should have been  
bowed.  She seemed to be stranded there among the refuse that life  
has thrown away, doing her jennying.  It was a bitter thing to her to  
be put aside by life, as if it had no use for her.  No wonder she   
protested.  
</p><p>She came with him to the door.  He stood below in the mean  
street, looking up at her.  So fine she was in her stature and her   
bearing, she reminded him of Juno dethroned.  As she stood in the   
doorway, she winced from the street, from her surroundings.  
</p><p>"And you will go with Mrs. Hodgkisson to Hucknall?"  
</p><p>He was talking quite meaninglessly, only watching her.  Her grey  
eyes at last met his.  They looked dumb with humiliation, pleading  
with a kind of captive misery.  He was shaken and at a loss.  He had  
thought her high and mighty.  
</p><p>When he left her, he wanted to run.  He went to the station in a  
sort of dream, and was at home without realising he had moved out  
of her street.  
</p><p>He had an idea that Susan, the overseer of the Spiral girls, was  
about to be married.  He asked her the next day.  
</p><p>"I say, Susan, I heard a whisper of your getting married.  What  
about it?"  
</p><p>Susan flushed red.  
</p><p>"Who's been talking to you?" she replied.  
</p><p>"Nobody.  I merely heard a whisper that you were thinking &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Well, I am, though you needn't tell anybody.  What's more, I  
wish I wasn't!"  
</p><p>"Nay, Susan, you won't make me believe that."  
</p><p>"Shan't I? You can believe it, though.  I'd rather stop here a  
thousand times."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="275"/>   
<p>Paul was perturbed.  
</p><p>"Why, Susan?"  
</p><p>The girl's colour was high, and her eyes flashed.  
</p><p>"That's why!"  
</p><p>"And must you?"  
</p><p>For answer, she looked at him.  There was about him a candour  
and gentleness which made the women trust him.  He understood.  
</p><p>"Ah, I'm sorry," he said.  
</p><p>Tears came to her eyes.  
</p><p>"But you'll see it'll turn out all right.  You'll make the best of  
it," he continued rather wistfully.  
</p><p>"There's nothing else for it."  
</p><p>"Yea, there's making the worst of it.  Try and make it all right."  
</p><p>He soon made occasion to call again on Clara.  
</p><p>"Would you," he said, "care to come back to Jordan's?"  
</p><p>She put down her work, laid her beautiful arms on the table, and  
looked at him for some moments without answering.  Gradually the  
flush mounted her cheek.  
</p><p>"Why?" she asked.  
</p><p>Paul felt rather awkward.  
</p><p>"Well, because Susan is thinking of leaving," he said.  
</p><p>Clara went on with her jennying.  The white lace leaped in little  
jumps and bounds on to the card.  He waited for her.  Without raising   
her head, she said at last, in a peculiar low voice:  
</p><p>"Have you said anything about it?"  
</p><p>"Except to you, not a word."  
</p><p>There was again a long silence.  
</p><p>"I will apply when the advertisement is out," she said.  
</p><p>"You will apply before that.  I will let you know  exactly  when."  
</p><p>She went on spinning her little machine, and did not contradict  
him.  
</p><p>Clara came to Jordan's.  Some of the older hands, Fanny among  
them, remembered her earlier rule, and cordially disliked the memory.    
Clara had always been "ikey", reserved, and superior.  She had  
never mixed with the girls as one of themselves.  If she had occasion   
to find fault, she did it coolly and with perfect politeness,  
which the defaulter felt to be a bigger insult than crassness.    
Towards Fanny, the poor, overstrung hunchback, Clara was unfailingly   
compassionate and gentle, as a result of which Fanny shed  
  
  
<pb n="276"/>   
  
more bitter tears than ever the rough tongues of the other overseers   
had caused her.  
</p><p>There was something in Clara that Paul disliked, and much that  
piqued him.  If she were about, he always watched her strong throat  
or her neck, upon which the blonde hair grew low and fluffy.  There  
was a fine down, almost invisible, upon the skin of her face and  
arms, and when once he had perceived it, he saw it always.  
</p><p>When he was at his work, painting in the afternoon, she would  
come and stand near to him, perfectly motionless.  Then he felt  
her, though she neither spoke nor touched him.  Although she stood  
a yard away he felt as if he were in contact with her.  Then he could  
paint no more.  He flung down the brushes, and turned to talk to her.  
</p><p>Sometimes she praised his work; sometimes she was critical and  
cold.  
</p><p>"You are affected in that piece," she would say; and, as there  
was an element of truth in her condemnation, his blood boiled  
with anger.  
</p><p>Again: "What of this?" he would ask enthusiastically.  
</p><p>"H'm!" She made a small doubtful sound.  "It doesn't interest  
me much."  
</p><p>"Because you don't understand it," he retorted.  
</p><p>"Then why ask me about it?"  
</p><p>"Because I thought you would understand."  
</p><p>She would shrug her shoulders in scorn of his work.  She maddened him.    
He was furious.  Then he abused her, and went into passionate   
exposition of his stuff.  This amused and stimulated her.  But  
she never owned that she had been wrong.  
</p><p>During the ten years that she had belonged to the women's  
movement she had acquired a fair amount of education, and, having   
had some of Miriam's passion to be instructed, had taught herself   
French, and could read in that language with a struggle.  She  
considered herself as a woman apart, and particularly apart, from  
her class.  The girls in the Spiral department were all of good homes.   
It was a small, special industry, and had a certain distinction.  There  
was an air of refinement in both rooms.  But Clara was aloof also  
from her fellow-workers.  
</p><p>None of these things, however, did she reveal to Paul.  She was  
not the one to give herself away.  There was a sense of mystery about  
  
  
<pb n="277"/>   
  
her.  She was so reserved, he felt she had much to reserve.  Her history   
was open on the surface, but its inner meaning was hidden  
from everybody.  It was exciting.  And then sometimes he caught her  
looking at him from under her brows with an almost furtive, sullen  
scrutiny, which made him move quickly.  Often she met his eyes.   
But then her own were, as it were, covered over, revealing nothing.   
She gave him a little, lenient smile.  She was to him extraordinarily  
provocative, because of the knowledge she seemed to possess, and  
gathered fruit of experience he could not attain.  
</p><p>One day he picked up a copy of Lettres de mon Moulin from  
her work-bench.  
</p><p>"You read French, do you?" he cried.  
</p><p>Clara glanced round negligently.  She was making an elastic  
stocking of heliotrope silk, turning the Spiral machine with slow,  
balanced regularity, occasionally bending down to see her work or  
to adjust the needles; then her magnificent neck, with its down and  
fine pencils of hair, shone white against the lavender, lustrous silk.   
She tumed a few more rounds, and stopped.  
</p><p>"What did you say?" she asked, smiling sweetly.   
</p><p>Paul's eyes glittered at her insolent indifference to him.   
</p><p>"I did not know you read French," he said, very polite.   
</p><p>"Did you not?" she replied, with a faint, sarcastic smile.   
</p><p>"Rotten swank!" he said, but scarcely loud enough to be heard.   
</p><p>He shut his mouth angrily as he watched her.  She seemed to  
scorn the work she mechanically produced; yet the hose she made  
were as nearly perfect as possible.  
</p><p>"You don't like Spiral work," he said.  
</p><p>"Oh, well, all work is work," she answered, as if she knew all  
about it.  
</p><p>He marvelled at her coldness.  He had to do everything hotly.  She  
must be something special.  
</p><p>"What would you prefer to do?" he asked.  
</p><p>She laughed at him indulgently, as she said:  
</p><p>"There is so little likelihood of my ever being given a choice, that  
I haven't wasted time considering."  
</p><p>"Pah!" he said, contemptuous on his side now.  "You only say  
that because you're too proud to own up what you want and can't  
get.  "  
</p><p>"You know me very well," she replied coldly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="278"/>   
  
<p>"I know you think you're terrific great shakes, and that you live  
under the eternal insult of working in a factory."  
</p><p>He was very angry and very rude.  She merely tumed away from  
him in disdain.  He walked whistling down the room, flirted and  
laughed with Hilda.  
</p><p>Later on he said to himself:  
</p><p>"What was I so impudent to Clara for?" He was rather annoyed  
with himself, at the same time glad.  "Serve her right; she stinks  
with silent pride," he said to himself angrily.  
</p><p>In the afternoon he came down.  There was a certain weight on  
his heart which he wanted to remove.  He thought to do it by offering   
her chocolates.  
</p><p>"Have one?" he said.  "I bought a handful to sweeten me up."  
</p><p>To his great relief, she accepted.  He sat on the work-bench   
beside her machine, twisting a piece of silk round his finger.  She  
loved him for his quick, unexpected movements, like a young animal.    
His feet swung as he pondered.  The sweets lay strewn on the  
bench.  She bent over her machine, grinding rhythmically, then  
stooping to see the stocking that hung beneath, pulled down by the  
weight.  He watched the handsome crouching of her back, and the  
apron-strings curling on the floor.  
</p><p>"There is always about you," he said, "a sort of waiting.    
Whatever I see you doing, you're not really there: you are waiting &mdash;  
like Penelope when she did her weaving." He could not help a  
spurt of wickedness.  "I'll call you Penelope," he said.  
</p><p>"Would it make any difference?" she said, carefully removing  
one of her needles.  
</p><p>"That doesn't matter, so long as it pleases me.  Here, I say, you  
seem to forget I'm your boss.  It just occurs to me."  
</p><p>"And what does that mean?" she asked coolly.  
</p><p>"It means I've got a right to boss you."  
</p><p>"Is there anything you want to complain about?"  
</p><p>"Oh, I say, you needn't be nasty," he said angrily.  
</p><p>"I don't know what you want," she said, continuing her task.  
</p><p>"I want you to treat me nicely and respectfully."  
</p><p>"Call you 'sir', perhaps?" she asked quietly.  
</p><p>"Yes, call me 'sir'.  I should love it."  
</p><p>"Then I wish you would go upstairs, sir."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="279"/>   
<p>His mouth closed, and a frown came on his face.  He jumped suddenly down.  
</p><p>"You're too blessed superior for anything," he said.  
</p><p>And he went away to the other girls.  He felt he was being angrier  
than he had any need to be.  In fact, he doubted slightly that he was  
showing off.  But if he were, then he would.  Clara heard him laughing,   
in a way she hated, with the girls down the next room.  
</p><p>When at evening he went through the department after the girls  
had gone, he saw his chocolates lying untouched in front of Clara's  
machine.  He left them.  In the morning they were still there, and  
Clara was at work.  Later on Minnie, a little brunette they called  
Pussy, called to him:  
</p><p>"Hey, haven't you got a chocolate for anybody?"  
</p><p>"Sorry, Pussy," he replied.  "I meant to have offered them; then  
I went and forgot 'em."  
</p><p>"I think you did," she answered.  
</p><p>"I'll bring you some this afternoon.  You don't want them after  
they've been lying about, do you?"  
</p><p>"Oh, I'm not particular," smiled Pussy.  
</p><p>"Oh no," he said.  "They'll be dusty."  
</p><p>He went up to Clara's bench.  
</p><p>"Sorry I left these things littering about," he said.  
</p><p>She flushed scarlet.  He gathered them together in his  
fist.  
</p><p>"They'll be dirty now," he said.  "You should  
have taken them.  I wonder why you didn't.  I meant to have told   
you I wanted you to."  
</p><p>He flung them out of the window into the yard below.  He just  
glanced at her.  She winced from his eyes.  
</p><p>In the afternoon he brought another packet.  
</p><p>"Will you take some?" he said, offering them first to Clara.   
"These are fresh."  
</p><p>She accepted one, and put it on to the bench.  
</p><p>"Oh, take several &mdash; for luck," he said.  
</p><p>She took a couple more, and put them on the bench also.  Then  
she turned in confusion to her work.  He went on up the room.   
</p><p>"Here you are, Pussy," he said.  "Don't be greedy!"  
</p><p>"Are they all for her?" cried the others, rushing up.  
</p><p>"Of course they're not," he said.  
</p><p>The girls clamoured round.  Pussy drew back from her mates.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="280"/>   
  
<p>"Come out!" she cried.  "I can have first pick, can't I, Paul?"  
</p><p>"Be nice with 'em," he said, and went away.  
</p><p>"You are a dear," the girls cried.  
</p><p>"Tenpence," he answered.  
</p><p>He went past Clara without speaking.  She felt the three chocolate  
creams would burn her if she touched them.  It needed all her courage   
to slip them into the pocket of her apron.  
</p><p>The girls loved him and were afraid of him.  He was so nice while  
he was nice, but if he were offended, so distant, treating them as if  
they scarcely existed, or not more than the bobbins of thread.  And  
then, if they were impudent, he said quietly: "Do you mind going  
on with your work," and stood and watched.  
</p><p>When he celebrated his twenty-third birthday, the house was  
in trouble.  Arthur was just going to be married.  His mother was  
not well.  His father, getting an old man, and lame from his accidents,   
was given a paltry, poor job.  Miriam was an etemal reproach.   
He felt he owed himself to her, yet could not give himself.  The  
house, moreover, needed his support.  He was pulled in all directions.    
He was not glad it was his birthday.  It made him bitter.  
</p><p>He got to work at eight o'clock.  Most of the clerks had not  
turned up.  The girls were not due till 8.30. As he was changing his  
coat, he heard a voice behind him say:  
</p><p>"Paul, Paul, I want you."  
</p><p>It was Fanny, the hunchback, standing at the top of her stairs,  
her face radiant with a secret.  Paul looked at her in astonishment.  
</p><p>"I want you," she said  
</p><p>He stood, at a loss.  
</p><p>"Come on," she coaxed.  "Come before you begin on the letters."  
</p><p>He went down the half-dozen steps into her dry, narrow, "finishing-off"   
room.  Fanny walked before him: her black bodice was  
short &mdash; the waist was under her armpits &mdash; and her green-black cashmere   
skirt seemed very long, as she strode with big strides before  
the young man, himself so graceful.  She went to her seat at  
the narrow end of the room, where the window opened on to  
chimney-pots.  Paul watched her thin hands and her Rat red wrists  
as she excitedly twitched ber white apron, which was spread on the  
bench in front of her.  She hesitated.  
</p><p>"You didn't think we'd forgot you?" she asked, reproachful.  
</p><p>"Why?" he asked.  He had forgotten his birthday himself.</p>  
  
<pb n="281"/>   
  
<p>"'Why,' he says! 'Why!' Why, look here!" She pointed to the  
calendar, and he saw, surrounding the big black number "21",  
hundreds of little crosses in black-lead.  
</p><p>"Oh, kisses for my birthday," he laughed.  "How did you know?"  
</p><p>"Yes, you want to know, don't you?" Fanny mocked, hugely delighted.    
"There's one from everybody &mdash; except Lady Clara &mdash; and two  
from some.  But I shan't tell you how many I put."  
</p><p>"Oh, I know, you're spooney," he said.  
</p><p>"There you are mistaken!" she cried, indignant.  "I could never  
be so soft." Her voice was strong and contralto.  
</p><p>"You always pretend to be such a hard-hearted hussy," he  
laughed.  "And you know you're as sentimental &mdash; "  
</p><p>"I'd rather be called sentimental than frozen meat," Fanny  
blurted.  Paul knew she referred to Clara, and he smiled.  
</p><p>"Do you say such nasty things about me?" he laughed.  
</p><p>"No, my duck," the hunchback woman answered, lavishly tender.    
She was thirty-nine.  "No, my duck, because you don't think  
yourself a fine figure in marble and us nothing but dirt.  I'm as  
good as you, aren't I, Paul?" and the question delighted her.  
</p><p>"Why, we're not better than one another, are we?" he replied.   
</p><p>"But I'm as good as you, aren't I, Paul?" she persisted daringly.   
</p><p>"Of course you are.  If it comes to goodness, you're better."  
</p><p>She was rather afraid of the situation.  She might get hysterical.   
</p><p>"I thought I'd get here before the others &mdash; won't they say I'm  
deep! Now shut your eyes-" she said.  
</p><p>"And open your mouth, and see what God sends you," he continued,   
suiting action to words, and expecting a piece of chocolate.  
He heard the rustle of the apron, and a faint clink of metal. "I'm  
going to look," he said.  
</p><p>He opened his eyes.  Fanny, her long cheeks flushed, her blue  
eyes shining, was gazing at him.  There was a little bundle of paint-tubes on the bench before him.  He turned pale.  
</p><p>"No, Fanny," he said quickly.  
</p><p>"From us all," she answered hastily.  
</p><p>"No, but &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Are they the right sort?" she asked, rocking herself with delight.  
</p><p>"Jove! they're the best in the catalogue."  
</p><p>"But they're the right sorts?" she cried.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="282"/>   
  
<p>"They're off the little list I'd made to get when my ship came  
in." He bit his lip.  
</p><p>Fanny was overcome with emotion.  She must turn the conversation.  
</p><p>"They was all on thorns to do it; they all paid their shares, all  
except the Queen of Sheba."  
</p><p>The Queen of Sheba was Clara.  
</p><p>"And wouldn't she join?" Paul asked.  
</p><p>"She didn't get the chance; we never told her; we wasn't going  
to have her bossing this show.  We didn't want her to join."  
</p><p>Paul laughed at the woman.  He was much moved.  At last he  
must go.  She was very close to him.  Suddenly she flung her arms  
round his neck and kissed him vehemently.  
</p><p>"I can give you a kiss to-day," she said apologetically.  "You've  
looked so white, it's made my heart ache."  
</p><p>Paul kissed her, and left her.  Her arms were so pitifully thin that  
his heart ached also.  
</p><p>That day he met Clara as he ran downstairs to wash his hands  
at dinner-time.  
</p><p>"You have stayed to dinner!" he exclaimed.  It was unusual for  
her.  
</p><p>"Yes; and I seem to have dined on old surgical-appliance stock.   
I must go out now, or I shall feel stale india-rubber right through."  
</p><p>She lingered.  He instantly caught at her wish.  
</p><p>"You are going anywhere?" he asked.  
</p><p>They went together up to the Castle.  Outdoors she dressed very  
plainly, down to ugliness; indoors she always looked nice.  She  
walked with hesitating steps alongside Paul, bowing and turning  
away from him.  Dowdy in dress, and drooping, she showed to great  
disadvantage.  He could scarcely recognise her strong form, that  
seemed to slumber with power.  She appeared almost insignificant,  
drowning her stature in her stoop, as she shrank from the public  
gaze.  
</p><p>The Castle grounds were very green and fresh.  Climbing the  
precipitous ascent, he laughed and chattered, but she was silent,  
seeming to brood over something.  There was scarcely time to go  
inside the squat, square building that crowns the bluff of rock.  They  
leaned upon the wall where the cuff runs sheer down to the Park.  
Below them, in their holes in the sandstone, pigeons preened themselves  
  
  
<pb n="283"/>   
and cooed softly.  Away down upon the boulevard at the foot  
of the rock, tiny trees stood in their own pools of shadow, and tiny  
people went scurrying about in almost ludicrous importance.  
</p><p>"You feel as if you could scoop up the folk like tadpoles, and  
have a handful of them," he said.  
</p><p>She laughed, answering:  
</p><p>"Yes; it is not necessary to get far off in order to see us   
proportionately.  The trees are much more significant."  
</p><p>"Bulk only," he said.  
</p><p>She laughed cynically.  
</p><p>Away beyond the boulevard the thin stripes of the metals  
showed upon the railway-track, whose margin was crowded with  
little stacks of timber, beside which smoking toy engines fussed.   
Then the silver string of the canal lay at random among the black  
heaps.  Beyond, the dwellings, very dense on the river flat, looked  
like black, poisonous herbage, in thick rows and crowded beds,  
stretching right away, broken now and then by taller plants, right  
to where the river glistened in a hieroglyph across the country.  The  
steep scarp cliffs across the river looked puny.  Great stretches of  
country darkened with trees and faintly brightened with com-land,  
spread towards the haze, where the hills rose blue beyond grey.  
</p><p>"It is comforting," said Mrs. Dawes, "to think the town goes no  
farther.  It is only a little sore upon the country yet."  
</p><p>"A little scab," Paul said.  
</p><p>She shivered.  She loathed the town.  Looking drearily across at  
the country which was forbidden her, her impassive face, pale and  
hostile, she reminded Paul of one of the bitter, remorseful angels.  
</p><p>"But the town's all right," he said; "it's only temporary.  This is  
the crude, clumsy make-shift we've practised on, till we find out  
what the idea is.  The town will come all right."  
</p><p>The pigeons in the pockets of rock, among the perched bushes,  
cooed comfortably.  To the left the large church of St. Mary rose  
into space, to keep close company with the Castle, above the  
heaped rubble of the town.  Mrs. Dawes smiled brightly as she  
looked across the country.  
</p><p>"I feel better," she said.  
</p><p>"Thank you," he replied.  "Great compliment!"  
</p><p>"Oh, my brother!" she laughed.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="284"/>   
  
<p>"H'm! that's snatching back with the left hand what you gave  
with the right, and no mistake," he said.  
</p><p>She laughed in amusement at him.  
</p><p>"But what was the matter with you?" he asked.  "I know you  
were brooding something special.  I can see the stamp of it on your  
face yet."  
</p><p>"I think I will not tell you," she said.  
</p><p>"All right, hug it," he answered.  
</p><p>She flushed and bit her lip.  
</p><p>"No," she said, "it was the girls."  
</p><p>"What about 'em?" Paul asked.  
</p><p>"They have been plotting something for a week now, and to-day they seem particularly full of it.  All alike; they insult me with  
their secrecy."  
</p><p>"Do they?" he asked in concern.  
</p><p>"I should not mind," she went on, in the metallic, angry tone,  
"if they did not thrust it into my face &mdash; the fact that they have a  
secret."  
</p><p>"Just like women," said he.  
</p><p>"It is hateful, their mean gloating," she said intensely.  
</p><p>Paul was silent.  He knew what the girls gloated over.  He was sorry  
to be the cause of this new dissension.  
</p><p>"They can have all the secrets in the world," she went on, brooding   
bitterly; "but they might refrain from glorying in them, and  
making me feel more out of it than ever.  It is &mdash; it is almost unbearable."  
</p><p>Paul thought for a few minutes.  He was much perturbed.  
</p><p>"I will tell you what it's all about," he said, pale and nervous.   
"It's my birthday, and they've bought me a fine lot of paints, all  
the girls.  They're jealous of you" &mdash; he felt her stiffen coldly at the  
word "jealous"-"merely because I sometimes bring you a book,"  
he added slowly.  "But, you see, it's only a trifle.  Don't bother about  
it, will you &mdash; because" &mdash; he laughed quickly &mdash; "well, what would  
they say if they saw us here now, in spite of their victory?"  
</p><p>She was angry with him for his clumsy reference to their present  
intimacy.  It was almost insolent of him.  Yet he was so quiet, she  
forgave him, although it cost her an effort.  
</p><p>Their two hands lay on the rough stone parapet of the Castle  
wall.  He had inherited from his mother a fineness of mould, so that  
  
<pb n="285"/>   
  
his hands were small and vigorous.  Hers were large, to match her  
large limbs, but white and powerful looking.  As Paul looked at  
them he knew her.  "She is wanting somebody to take her hands &mdash;  
for all she is so contemptuous of us," he said to himself.  And she  
saw nothing but his two hands, so warm and alive, which seemed  
to live for her.  He was brooding now, staring out over the country  
from under sullen brows.  The little, interesting diversity of shapes  
had vanished from the scene; all that remained was a vast, dark  
matrix of sorrow and tragedy, the same in all the houses and the  
river-flats and the people and the birds; they were only shapen differently.    
And now that the forms seemed to have melted away,  
there remained the mass from which all the landscape was composed,   
a dark mass of struggle and pain.  The factory, the girls, his  
mother, the large, uplifted church, the thicket of the town, merged  
into one atmosphere &mdash; dark, brooding, and sorrowful, every bit.  
</p><p>"Is that two o'clock striking?" Mrs. Dawes said in surprise.   
</p><p>Paul started, and everything sprang into form, regained its individuality,   
its forgetfulness, and its cheerfulness.  
</p><p>They hurried back to work.  
</p><p>When he was in the rush of preparing for the night's post, examining   
the work up from Fanny's room, which smelt of ironing,  
the evening postman came in.  
</p><p>"'Mr.  Paul Morel,'" he said, smiling, handing Paul a package.   
"A lady's handwriting! Don't let the girls see it."  
</p><p>The postman, himself a favourite, was pleased to make fun of  
the girls' affection for Paul.  
</p><p>It was a volume of verse with a brief note: "You will allow me  
to send you this, and so spare me my isolation.  I also sympathise  
and wish you well. &mdash; C.D." Paul flushed hot.  
</p><p>"Good Lord! Mrs. Dawes.  She can't afford it.  Good Lord, who  
ever'd have thought it!"  
</p><p>He was suddenly intensely moved.  He was filled with the warmth  
of her.  In the glow he could almost feel her as if she were present &mdash;  
her arms, her shoulders, her bosom, see them, feel them, almost  
contain them.  
</p><p>This move on the part of Clara brought them into closer intimacy.    
The other girls noticed that when Paul met Mrs. Dawes his  
eyes lifted and gave that peculiar bright greeting which they could  
interpret.  Knowing he was unaware, Clara made no sign, save that  
  
  
<pb n="286"/>   
  
occasionally she turned aside her face from him when he came  
upon her.  
</p><p>They walked out together very often at dinner-time; it was quite  
open, quite frank.  Everybody seemed to feel that he was quite unaware   
of the state of his own feeling, and that nothing was wrong.   
He talked to her now with some of the old fervour with which he  
had talked to Miriam, but he cared less about the talk; he did not  
bother about his conclusions.  
</p><p>One day in October they went out to Lambley for tea.  Suddenly  
they came to a halt on top of the hill.  He climbed and sat on a gate,  
she sat on the stile.  The afternoon was perfectly still, with a dim  
haze, and yellow sheaves glowing through.  They were quiet.  
</p><p>"How old were you when you married?" he asked quietly.  
</p><p>"Twenty-two."  
</p><p>Her voice was subdued, almost submissive.  She would tell him  
now.  
</p><p>"It is eight years ago?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"And when did you leave him?"  
</p><p>"Three years ago."  
</p><p>"Five years! Did you love him when you married him?"  
</p><p>She was silent for some time; then she said slowly:  
</p><p>"I thought I did &mdash; more or less.  I didn't think much about it.  And  
he wanted me.  I was very prudish then."  
</p><p>"And you sort of walked into it without thinking?"  
</p><p>"Yes.  I seemed to have been asleep nearly all my life."  
</p><p>"Somnambule? But &mdash; when did you wake up?"  
</p><p>"I don't know that I ever did, or ever have &mdash; since I was a child."  
</p><p>"You went to sleep as you grew to be a woman? How queer!  
And he didn't wake you?"  
</p><p>"No; he never got there," she replied, in a monotone.  
</p><p>The brown birds dashed over the hedges where the rose-hips  
stood naked and scarlet.  
</p><p>"Got where?" he asked.  
</p><p>"At me.  He never really mattered to me."  
</p><p>The afternoon was so gently warm and dim.  Red roofs of the  
cottages burned among the blue haze.  He loved the day.  He could  
feel, but he could not understand, what Clara was saying.  
</p><p>"But why did you leave him? Was he horrid to you?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="287"/>   
<p>She shuddered lightly.  
</p><p>"He &mdash; he sort of degraded me.  He wanted to bully me because  
he hadn't got me.  And then I felt as if I wanted to run, as if I was  
fastened and bound up.  And he seemed dirty."  
</p><p>"I see."  
</p><p>He did not at all see.  
</p><p>"And was he always dirty?" he asked.  
</p><p>"A bit," she replied slowly.  "And then he seemed as if he  
couldn't get at me, really.  And then he got brutal &mdash; he was  
brutal!"  
</p><p>"And why did you leave him finally?"  
</p><p>"Because &mdash; because he was unfaithful to me &mdash; "  
</p><p>They were both silent for some time.  Her hand lay on the gate-post as she balanced.  He put his own over it.  His heart beat quickly.  
</p><p>"But did you &mdash; were you ever &mdash; did you ever give him a chance?"  
</p><p>"Chance? How?"  
</p><p>"To come near to you."  
</p><p>"I married him &mdash; and I was willing &mdash; "  
</p><p>They both strove to keep their voices steady.  
</p><p>"I believe he loves you," he said.  
</p><p>"It looks like it," she replied.  
</p><p>He wanted to take his hand away, and could not.  She saved him  
by removing her own.  After a silence, he began again:  
</p><p>"Did you leave him out of count all along?"  
</p><p>"He left me," she said.  
</p><p>"And I suppose he couldn't make himself mean everything to  
you?"  
</p><p>"He tried to bully me into it."  
</p><p>But the conversation had got them both out of their depth.  Sud-denly Paul jumped down.  
</p><p>"Come on," he said.  "Let's go and get some tea."  
</p><p>They found a cottage, where they sat in the cold parlour.  She  
poured out his tea.  She was very quiet.  He felt she had withdrawn  
again from him.  After tea, she stared broodingly into her tea-cup,  
twisting her wedding ring all the time.  In her abstraction she took  
the ring off her finger, stood it up, and spun it upon the table.  The  
gold became a diaphanous, glittering globe.  It fell, and the ring was  
quivering upon the table.  She spun it again and again.  Paul  
watched, fascinated.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="288"/>   
  
<p>But she was a married woman, and he believed in simple friendship.    
And he considered that he was perfectly honourable with  
regard to her.  It was only a friendship between man and woman,  
such as any civilised persons might have.  
</p><p>He was like so many young men of his own age.  Sex had become  
so complicated in him that he would have denied that he ever  
could want Clara or Miriam or any woman whom he knew. Sex  
desire was a sort of detached thing, that did not belong to a woman.   
He loved Miriam with his soul.  He grew warm at the thought of  
Clara, be battled with her, he knew the curves of her breast and  
shoulders as if they had been moulded inside him; and yet he did  
not positively desire her.  He would have denied it for ever.  He believed   
himself really bound to Miriam.  If ever he should marry,  
some time in the far future, it would be his duty to marry Miriam.   
That he gave Clara to understand, and she said nothing, but left  
him to his courses.  He came to her, Mrs. Dawes, whenever he  
could.  Then he wrote frequently to Miriam, and visited the girl occasionally.    
So he went on through the winter; but he seemed not  
so fretted.  His mother was easier about him.  She thought he was  
getting away from Miriam.  
</p><p>Miriam knew now how strong was the attraction of Clara for  
him; but still she was certain that the best in him would triumph.   
His feeling for Mrs. Dawes &mdash; who, moreover, was a married woman  
&mdash; was shallow and temporal, compared with his love for herself.   
He would come back to her, she was sure; with some of his young  
freshness gone, perhaps, but cured of his desire for the lesser things  
which other women than herself could give him.  She could bear all  
if he were inwardly true to her and must come back.  
</p><p>He saw none of the anomaly of his position.  Miriam was his old  
friend, lover, and she belonged to Bestwood and home and his  
youth.  Clara was a newer friend, and she belonged to Nottingham,  
to life, to the world.  It seemed to him quite plain.  
</p><p>Mrs. Dawes and he had many periods of coolness, when they  
saw little of each other; but they always came together gam.  
</p><p>"Were you horrid with Baxter Dawes?" he asked her.  It was a  
thing that seemed to trouble him.  
</p><p>"In what way?"  
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know.  But weren't you horrid with him? Didn't  
you do something that knocked him to pieces?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="289"/>   
<p>"What, pray?"  
</p><p>"Making him feel as if he were nothing &mdash; I know," Paul declared.  
</p><p>"You are so clever, my friend," she said coolly.  
</p><p>The conversation broke off there.  But it made her cool with him  
for some time.  
</p><p>She very rarely saw Miriam now.  The friendship between the  
two women was not broken off, but considerably weakened.  
</p><p>"Will you come in to the concert on Sunday afternoon?" Clara  
asked him just after Christmas.  
</p><p>"I promised to go up to Willey Farm," he replied.  
</p><p>"Oh, very well."  
</p><p>"You don't mind, do you?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Why should I?" she answered.  
</p><p>Which almost annoyed him.  
</p><p>"You know," he said, "Miriam and I have been a lot to each  
other ever since I was sixteen &mdash; that's seven years now."  
</p><p>"It's a long time," Clara replied.  
</p><p>"Yes; but somehow she &mdash; it doesn't go right &mdash; "  
</p><p>"How?" asked Clara.  
</p><p>"She seems to draw me and draw me, and she wouldn't leave a  
single hair of me free to fall out and blow away &mdash; she'd keep it."  
</p><p>"But you like to be kept."  
</p><p>"No," he said, "I don't.  I wish it could be normal, give and take  
&mdash; like me and you.  I want a woman to keep me, but not in her  
pocket."  
</p><p>"But if you love her, it couldn't be normal, like me and you."  
</p><p>"Yes; I should love her better then.  She sort of wants me so  
much that I can't give myself."  
</p><p>"Wants you how?"  
</p><p>"Wants the soul out of my body.  I can't help shrinking back  
from her."  
</p><p>"And yet you love her!"  
</p><p>"No, I don't love her.  I never even kiss her."  
</p><p>"Why not?" Clara asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know."  
</p><p>"I suppose you're afraid," she said.  
</p><p>"I'm not.  Something in me shrinks from her like hell &mdash; she's so  
good, when I'm not good."  
</p><p>"How do you know what she is?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="290"/>   
  
<p>"I do! I know she wants a sort of soul union."  
</p><p>"But how do you know what she wants?"  
</p><p>"I've been with her for seven years."  
</p><p>"And you haven't found out the very first thing about her."  
</p><p>"What's that?"  
</p><p>"That she doesn't want any of your soul communion.  That's your  
own imagination.  She wants you."  
</p><p>He pondered over this.  Perhaps he was wrong.  
</p><p>"But she seems &mdash; " he began.  
</p><p>"You've never tried," she answered.</p>

<head>"The Test on Miriam" </head> 
  
  
<p>WITH the spring came again the old madness and battle.  Now he  
knew he would have to go to Miriam.  But what was his reluctance?  
He told himself it was only a sort of overstrong virginity in her and  
him which neither could break through.  He might have married  
her; but his circumstances at home made it difficult, and, moreover,   
he did not want to marry.  Marriage was for life, and because  
they had become close companions, he and she, he did not see that  
it should inevitably follow they should be man and wife.  He did  
not feel that he wanted marriage with Miriam.  He wished he did.   
He would have given his head to have felt a joyous desire to marry  
her and to have her.  Then why couldn't he bring it off? There was  
some obstacle; and what was the obstacle? It lay in the physical  
bondage.  He shrank from the physical contact.  But why? With her  
he felt bound up inside himself.  He could not go out to her.  Something   
struggled in him, but he could not get to her.  Why? She loved  
him.  Clara said she even wanted him; then why couldn't he go to  
her, make love to her, kiss her? Why, when she put her arm in his,  
timidly, as they walked, did he feel he would burst forth in brutality  
and recoil? He owed himself to her; he wanted to belong to her.   
Perhaps the recoil and the shrinking from her was love in its first  
fierce modesty.  He bad no aversion for her.  No, it was the opposite;  
it was a strong desire battling with a still stronger shyness and virginity.    
It seemed as if virginity were a positive force, which fought  
  
  
<pb n="291"/>   
  
and won in both of them.  And with her he felt it so hard to overcome;   
yet he was nearest to her, and with her alone could he deliberately   
break through.  And he owed himself to her.  Then, if they  
could get things right, they could marry; but he would not marry  
unless he could feel strong in the joy of it-never.  He could not have  
faced his mother.  It seemed to him that to sacrifice himself in a  
marriage he did not want would be degrading, and would undo all  
his life, make it a nullity.  He would try what he could do.  
</p><p>And he had a great tenderness for Miriam.  Always, she was sad,  
dreaming her religion; and he was nearly a religion to her.  He could  
not bear to fail her.  It would all come right if they tried.  
</p><p>He looked round.  A good many of the nicest men he knew were  
like himself, bound in by their own virginity, which they could  
not break out of.  They were so sensitive to their women that they  
would go without them for ever rather than do them a hurt, an  
injustice.  Being the sons of mothers whose husbands had blundered   
rather brutally through their feminine sanctities, they were  
themselves too diffident and shy.  They could easier deny themselves   
than incur any reproach from a woman; for a woman was  
like their mother, and they were full of the sense of their mother.   
They preferred themselves to suffer the misery of celibacy, rather  
than risk the other person.  
</p><p>He went back to her.  Something in her, when he looked at her,  
brought the tears almost to his eyes.  One day he stood behind her  
as she sang.  Annie was playing a song on the piano.  As Miriam  
sang her mouth seemed hopeless.  She sang like a nun singing to  
heaven.  It reminded him so much of the mouth and eyes of one  
who sings beside a Botticelli Madonna, so spiritual.  Again, hot as  
steel, came up the pain in him.  Why must he ask her for the other  
thing? Why was there his blood battling with her? If only he could  
have been always gentle, tender with her, breathing with her the  
atmosphere of reverie and religious dreams, he would give his  
right hand.  It was not fair to hurt her.  There seemed an eternal  
maidenhood about her; and when be thought of her mother, he  
saw the great brown eyes of a maiden who was nearly scared and  
shocked out of her virgin maidenhood, but not quite, in spite of  
her seven children.  They had been born almost leaving her out of  
count, not of her, but upon her.  So she could never let them go,  
because she never had possessed them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morel saw him going again frequently to Miriam, and was  
astonished.  He said nothing to his mother.  He did not explain nor  
excuse himself.  If he came home late, and she reproached him, he  
frowned and turned on her in an overbearing way:  
</p><p>"I shall come home when I like," he said; "I am old enough."  
</p><p>"Must she keep you till this time?"  
</p><p>"It is I who stay," he answered.  
</p><p>"And she lets you? But very well," she said.  
</p><p>And she went to bed, leaving the door unlocked for him; but  
she lay listening until he came, often long after.  It was a great   
bitterness to her that he had gone back to Miriam.  She recognised,  
however, the uselessness of any further interference.  He went to  
Willey Farm as a man now, not as a youth.  She had no right over  
him.  There was a coldness between him and her.  He hardly told  
her anything.  Discarded, she waited on him, cooked for him still,  
and loved to slave for him; but her face closed again like a mask.   
There was nothing for her to do now but the housework; for all the  
rest he had gone to Miriam.  She could not forgive him.  Miriam  
killed the joy and the warmth in him.  He had been such a jolly lad,  
and full of the warmest affection; now he grew colder, more and  
more irritable and gloomy.  It reminded her of William; but Paul  
was worse.  He did things with more intensity, and more realisation  
of what he was about.  His mother knew how he was suffering for  
want of a woman, and she saw him going to Miriam.  If he had  
made up his mind, nothing on earth would alter him.  Mrs. Morel  
was tired.  She began to give up at last; she had finished.  She was  
in the way.  
</p><p>He went on determinedly.  He realised more or less what his  
mother felt.  It only hardened his soul.  He made himself callous  
towards her; but it was like being callous to his own health.  It   
undermined him quickly; yet he persisted.  
</p><p>He lay back in the rocking-chair at Willey Farm one evening.   
He had been talking to Miriam for some weeks, but had not come  
to the point.  Now he said suddenly:  
</p><p>"I am twenty-four, almost."  
</p><p>She had been brooding.  She looked up at him suddenly in surprise.  
</p><p>"Yes.  What makes you say it?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="293"/>   
<p>There was something in the charged atmosphere that she  
dreaded.  
</p><p>"Sir Thomas More says one can marry at twenty-four."  
</p><p>She laughed quaintly, saying:  
</p><p>"Does it need Sir Thomas More's sanction?"  
</p><p>"No; but one ought to marry about then."  
</p><p>"Ay," she answered broodingly; and she waited.  
</p><p>"I can't marry you," he continued slowly, "not now, because  
we've no money, and they depend on me at home."  
</p><p>She sat half-guessing what was coming.  
</p><p>"But I want to marry now &mdash; "  
</p><p>"You want to marry?" she repeated.  
</p><p>"A woman &mdash; you know what I mean."  
</p><p>She was silent.  
</p><p>"Now, at last, I must," he said.  
</p><p>"Ay," she answered.  
</p><p>"And you love me?"  
</p><p>She laughed bitterly.  
</p><p>"Why are you ashamed of it," he answered.  "You wouldn't be  
ashamed before your God, why are you before people?"  
</p><p>"Nay," she answered deeply, "I am not ashamed."  
</p><p>"You are," he replied bitterly; "and it's my fault.  But you know  
I can't help being &mdash; as I am &mdash; don't you?"  
</p><p>"I know you can't help it," she replied.  
</p><p>"I love you an awful lot &mdash; then there is something short."  
</p><p>"Where?" she answered, looking at him.  
</p><p>"Oh, in me! It is I who ought to be ashamed &mdash; like a spiritual  
cripple.  And I am ashamed.  It is misery.  Why is it?"  
</p><p>"I don't know," replied Miriam.  
</p><p>"And I don't know," he repeated.  "Don't you think we have  
been too fierce in our what they call purity? Don't you think that  
to be so much afraid and averse is a sort of dirtiness?"  
</p><p>She looked at him with startled dark eyes.  
</p><p>"You recoiled away from anything of the sort, and I took the  
motion from you, and recoiled also, perhaps worse."  
</p><p>There was silence in the room for some time.  
</p><p>"Yes," she said, "it is so."  
</p><p>"There is between us," he said, "all these years of intimacy.  I  
feel naked enough before you.  Do you understand?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="294"/>   
  
<p>"I think so," she answered.  
</p><p>"And you love me?"  
</p><p>She laughed.  
</p><p>"Don't be bitter," he pleaded.  
</p><p>She looked at him and was sorry for him; his eyes were dark  
with torture.  She was sorry for him; it was worse for him to have  
this deflated love than for herself, who could never be properly  
mated.  He was restless, for ever urging forward and trying to find  
a way out.  He might do as he liked, and have what he liked of her.  
</p><p>"Nay," she said softly, "I am not bitter."  
</p><p>She felt she could bear anything for him; she would suffer for  
him.  She put her hand on his knee as he leaned forward in his  
chair.  He took it and kissed it; but it hurt to do so.  He felt he was  
putting himself aside.  He sat there sacrificed to her purity, which  
felt more like nullity.  How could he kiss her hand passionately,  
when it would drive her away, and leave nothing but pain? Yet  
slowly he drew her to him and kissed her.  
</p><p>They knew each other too well to pretend anything.  As she  
kissed him, she watched his eyes; they were staring across the  
room, with a peculiar dark blaze in them that fascinated her.  He  
was perfectly still.  She could feel his heart throbbing heavily in his  
breast.  
</p><p>"What are you thinking about?" she asked.  
</p><p>The blaze in his eyes shuddered, became uncertain.  
</p><p>"I was thinking, all the while, I love you.  I have been obstinate."  
</p><p>She sank her head on his breast.  
</p><p>"Yes," she answered.  
</p><p>"That's all," he said, and his voice seemed sure, and his mouth  
was kissing her throat.  
</p><p>Then she raised her head and looked into his eyes with her full  
gaze of love.  The blaze struggled, seemed to try to get away from  
her, and then was quenched.  He turned his head quickly aside.  It  
was a moment of anguish.  
</p><p>"Kiss me," she whispered.  
</p><p>He shut his eyes, and kissed her, and his arms folded her closer  
and closer.  
</p><p>When she walked home with him over the fields, he said:  
</p><p>"I am glad I came back to you.  I feel so simple with you &mdash; as if  
there was nothing to hide.  We will be happy?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="295"/>   
<p>"Yes," she murmured, and the tears came to her eyes.  
</p><p>"Some sort of perversity in our souls," he said, "makes us not  
want, get away from, the very thing we want.  We have to fight  
against that."   
</p><p>"Yes," she said, and she felt stunned.  
</p><p>As she stood under the drooping-thorn tree, in the darkness by  
the roadside, he kissed her, and his fingers wandered over her  
face.  In the darkness, where he could not see her but only feel  
her, his passion flooded him.  He clasped her very close.  
</p><p>"Sometime you will have me?" he murmured, hiding his face  
on her shoulder.  It was so difficult.  
</p><p>"Not now," she said.  
</p><p>His hopes and his heart sunk.  A dreariness came over him.  
</p><p>"No," he said.  
</p><p>His clasp of her slackened.  
</p><p>"I love to feel your arm there!" she said, pressing his arm against  
her back, where it went round her waist.  "It rests me so."  
</p><p>He tightened the pressure of his arm upon the small of her back  
to rest her.  
</p><p>"We belong to each other," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"Then why shouldn't we belong to each other altogether?"  
</p><p>"But &mdash; " she faltered.  
</p><p>"I know it's a lot to ask," he said; "but there's not much risk for  
you really &mdash; not in the Gretchen way.  You can trust me there?"  
</p><p>"Oh, I can trust you." The answer came quick and strong.  "It's  
not that &mdash; it's not that at all &mdash; but &mdash; "  
</p><p>"What?"  
</p><p>She hid her face in his neck with a little cry of misery.  
</p><p>"I don't know!" she cried.  
</p><p>She seemed slightly hysterical, but with a sort of horror.  His  
heart died in him.  
</p><p>"You don't think it ugly?" he asked.  
</p><p>"No, not now.  You have taught me it isn't."  
</p><p>"You are afraid?"  
</p><p>She calmed herself hastily.  
</p><p>"Yes, I am only afraid," she said.  
</p><p>He kissed her tenderly.  
</p><p>"Never mind," he said.  "You should please yourself."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="296"/>   
  
<p>Suddenly she gripped his arms round her, and clenched her  
body stiff.  
</p><p>"You shall have me," she said, through her shut teeth.  
</p><p>His heart beat up again like fire.  He folded her close, and his  
mouth was on her throat.  She could not bear it.  She drew away.   
He disengaged her.  
</p><p>"Won't you be late?" she asked gently.  
</p><p>He sighed, scarcely hearing what she said.  She waited, wishing  
he would go.  At last he kissed her quickly and climbed the fence.   
Looking round he saw the pale blotch of her face down in the  
darkness under the hanging tree.  There was no more of her but this  
pale blotch.  
</p><p>"Good-bye!" she called softly.  She had no body, only a voice  
and a dim face.  He turned away and ran down the road, his fists  
clenched; and when he came to the wall over the lake he leaned  
there, almost stunned, looking up the black water.  
</p><p>Miriam plunged home over the meadows.  She was not afraid  
of people, what they might say; but she dreaded the issue with  
him.  Yes, she would let him have her if he insisted; and then,  
when she thought of it afterwards, her heart went down.  He would  
be disappointed, he would find no satisfaction, and then he would  
go away.  Yet he was so insistent; and over this, which did not  
seem so all-important to her, was their love to break down.  After  
all, he was only like other men, seeking his satisfaction.  Oh, but  
there was something more in him, something deeper! She could  
trust to it, in spite of all desires.  He said that possession was a great  
moment in life.  All strong emotions concentrated there.  Perhaps  
it was so.  There was something divine in it; then she would submit,  
religiously, to the sacrifice.  He should have ber.  And at the thought  
her whole body clenched itself involuntarily, hard, as if against  
something; but Life forced her through this gate of suffering, too,  
and she would submit.  At any rate, it would give him what he  
wanted, which was her deepest wish.  She brooded and brooded  
and brooded herself towards accepting him.  
</p><p>He courted her now like a lover.  Often, when he grew hot, she  
put his face from ber, held it between ber hands, and looked in his  
eyes.  He could not meet her gaze.  Her dark eyes, full of love, earnest   
and searching, made him turn away.  Not for an instant would  
she let him forget.  Back again he had to torture himself into a sense  
  
  
<pb n="297"/>   
  
of his responsibility and hers.  Never any relaxing, never any leaving   
himself to the great hunger and impersonality of passion; he  
must be brought back to a deliberate, reflective creature.  As if  
from a swoon of passion she caged him back to the littleness, the  
personal relationship.  He could not bear it.  "Leave me alone &mdash;  
leave me alone!" he wanted to cry; but she wanted him to look at  
her with eyes full of love.  His eyes, full of the dark, impersonal fire  
of desire, did not belong to her.  
</p><p>There was a great crop of cherries at the farm.  The trees at the  
back of the house, very large and tall, hung thick with scarlet and  
crimson drops, under the dark leaves.  Paul and Edgar were gathering   
the fruit one evening.  It had been a hot day, and now the  
clouds were rolling in the sky, dark and warm.  Paul combed high  
in the tree, above the scarlet roofs of the buildings.  The wind,  
moaning steadily, made the whole tree rock with a subtle, thrilling  
motion that stirred the blood.  The young man, perched insecurely  
in the slender branches, rocked till he felt slightly drunk, reached  
down the boughs, where the scarlet beady cherries hung thick underneath,   
and tore off handful after handful of the sleek, cool-fleshed fruit.  Cherries touched his ears and his neck as he  
stretched forward, their chill finger-tips sending a flash down his  
blood.  All shades of red, from a golden vermilion to a rich crimson,   
glowed and met his eyes under a darkness of leaves.  
</p><p>The sun, going down, suddenly caught the broken clouds.  Immense   
piles of gold flared out in the south-east, heaped in soft,  
glowing yellow right up the sky.  'ne world, till now dusk and grey,  
reflected the gold glow, astonished.  Everywhere the trees, and  
the grass, and the far-off water, seemed roused from the twilight  
and shining.  
</p><p>Miriam came out wondering.  
</p><p>"Oh!" Paul heard her mellow voice call, "isn't it wonderful?"  
</p><p>He looked down.  There was a faint gold glimmer on her face,  
that looked very soft, turned up to him.  
</p><p>"How high you are!" she said.  
</p><p>Beside her, on the rhubarb leaves, were four dead birds, thieves  
that had been shot.  Paul saw some cherry stones hanging quite  
bleached, like skeletons, picked clear of flesh.  He looked down  
again to Miriam.  
</p><p>"Clouds are on fire," he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="298"/>   
  
<p>"Beautiful!" she cried.  
</p><p>She seemed so small, so soft, so tender, down there.  He threw  
a handful of cherries at her.  She was startled and frightened.  He  
laughed with a low, chuckling sound, and pelted her.  She ran for  
shelter, picking up some cherries.  Two fine red pairs she hung over  
her ears; then she looked up again.  
</p><p>"Haven't you got enough?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Nearly.  It is like being on a ship up here."  
</p><p>"And how long will you stay?"  
</p><p>"While the sunset lasts."  
</p><p>She went to the fence and sat there, watching the gold clouds  
fall to pieces, and go in immense, rose-coloured ruin towards the  
darkness.  Gold flamed to scarlet, like pain in its intense brightness.   
Then the scarlet sank to rose, and rose to crimson, and quickly the  
passion went out of the sky.  All the world was dark grey.  Paul  
scrambled quickly down with his basket, tearing his shirt-sleeve  
as he did so.  
</p><p>"They are lovely," said Miriam, fingering the cherries.  
</p><p>"I've torn my sleeve," he answered.  
</p><p>She took the three-cornered rip, saying:  
</p><p>"I shall have to mend it." It was near the shoulder.  She put her  
fingers through the tear.  "How warm!" she said.  
</p><p>He laughed.  There was a new, strange note in his voice, one that  
made her pant.  
</p><p>"Shall we stay out?" he said.  
</p><p>"Won't it rain?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No, let us walk a little way."  
</p><p>They went down the fields and into the thick plantation of  
trees and pines.  
</p><p>"Shall we go in among the trees?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Do you want to?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>It was very dark among the firs, and the sharp spines pricked  
her face.  She was afraid.  Paul was silent and strange.  
</p><p>"I like the darkness," he said.  "I wish it were thicker &mdash; good,  
thick darkness."  
</p><p>He seemed to be almost unaware of her as a person: she was  
only to him then a woman.  She was afraid.  
</p><p>He stood against a pine-tree trunk and took her in his arms.  She  
  
  
<pb n="299"/>   
  
relinquished herself to him, but it was a sacrifice in which she felt  
something of horror.  This thick-voiced, oblivious man was a  
stranger to her.  
</p><p>Later it began to rain.  The pine-trees smelled very strong.  Paul  
lay with his head on the ground, on the dead pine needles, listening   
to the sharp hiss of the rain-a steady, keen noise.  His heart  
was down, very heavy.  Now he realised that she had not been with  
him all the time, that her soul had stood apart, in a sort of horror.   
He was physically at rest, but no more.  Very dreary at heart, very  
sad, and very tender, his fingers wandered over her face pitifully.   
Now again she loved him deeply.  He was tender and beautiful.  
</p><p>"The rain!" he said.  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; is it coming on you?"  
</p><p>She put her hands over him, on his hair, on his shoulders, to feel  
if the raindrops fell on him.  She loved him dearly.  He, as he lay  
with his face on the dead pine-leaves, felt extraordinarily quiet.   
He did not mind if the raindrops came on him: he would have lain  
and got wet through: he felt as if nothing mattered, as if his living  
were smeared away into the beyond, near and quite lovable.  This  
strange, gentle reaching-out to death was new to him.  
</p><p>"We must go," said Miriam.  
</p><p>"Yes," he answered, but did not move.  
</p><p>To him now, life seemed a shadow, day a white shadow; night,  
and death, and stillness, and inaction, this seemed like being.  To  
be alive, to be urgent and insistent &mdash; that was not-to-be.  The highest   
of all was to melt out into the darkness and sway there,  
identified with the great Being.  
</p><p>"The rain is coming in on us," said Miriam.  
</p><p>He rose, and assisted her.  
</p><p>"It is a pity," he said.  
</p><p>"What?"  
</p><p>"To have to go.  I feel so still."  
</p><p>"Still!" she repeated.  
</p><p>"Stiller than I have ever been in my life."  
</p><p>He was walking with his hand in hers.  She pressed his fingers,  
feeling a slight fear.  Now he seemed beyond her; she had a fear  
lest she should lose him.  
</p><p>"The fir-trees are like presences on the darkness: each one only  
a presence."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="300"/>   
  
<p>She was afraid, and said nothing.  
</p><p>"A sort of hush: the whole night wondering and asleep: I suppose   
that's what we do in death-sleep in wonder."  
</p><p>She had been afraid before of the brute in him: now of the  
mystic.  She trod beside him in silence.  The rain fell with a heavy  
"Hush!" on the trees.  At last they gained the cart-shed.   
</p><p>"Let us stay here awhile," he said.  
</p><p>There was a sound of rain everywhere, smothering everything.   
</p><p>"I feel so strange and still," he said; "along with everything."  
</p><p>"Ay," she answered patiently.  
</p><p>He seemed again unaware of her, though he held her band close.  
</p><p>"To be rid of our individuality, which is our will, which is our  
effort &mdash; to live effortless, a kind of curious sleep &mdash; that is very  
beautiful, I think; that is our after-life &mdash; our immortality."  
</p><p>"Yes?"  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; and very beautiful to have."  
</p><p>"You don't usually say that."  
</p><p>"No."  
</p><p>In a while they went indoors.  Everybody looked at them  
curiously.  He still kept the quiet, heavy look in his eyes, the stillness  
in his voice.  Instinctively, they all left him alone.  
</p><p>About this time Miriam's grandmother, who lived in a tiny cottage   
in Woodlinton, fell ill, and the girl was sent to keep house. it  
was a beautiful little place.  The cottage had a big garden in front,  
with red brick walls, against which the plum trees were nailed.  At  
the back another garden was separated from the fields by a tall old  
hedge.  It was very pretty.  Miriam had not much to do, so she found  
time for her beloved reading, and for writing little introspective  
pieces which interested her.  
</p><p>At the holiday-time her grandmother, being better, was driven  
to Derby to stay with her daughter for a day or two.  She was a  
crotchety old lady, and might return the second day or the third;  
so Miriam stayed alone in the cottage, which also pleased her.  
</p><p>Paul used often to cycle over, and they had as a rule peaceful  
and happy times.  He did not embarrass her much; but then on the  
Monday of the holiday he was to spend a whole day with her.  
</p><p>It was perfect weather.  He left his mother, telling her where he  
was going.  She would be alone all the day.  It cast a shadow over  
him; but he had three days that were all his own, when he was going  
  
  
<pb n="301"/>   
to do as he liked.  It was sweet to rush through the morning  
lanes on his bicycle.  
</p><p>He got to the cottage at about eleven o'clock.  Miriam was busy  
preparing dinner.  She looked so perfectly in keeping with the little  
kitchen, ruddy and busy.  He kissed her and sat down to watch. The  
room was small and cosy.  The sofa was covered all over with a sort  
of linen in squares of red and pale blue, old, much washed, but  
pretty.  There was a stuffed owl in a case over a corner cupboard.   
The sunlight came through the leaves of the scented geraniums in  
the window.  She was cooking a chicken in his honour.  It was their  
cottage for the day, and they were man and wife.  He beat the eggs  
for her and peeled the potatoes.  He thought she gave a feeling of  
home almost like his mother; and no one could look more beautiful,   
with her tumbled curls, when she was flushed from the fire.  
</p><p>The dinner was a great success.  Like a young husband, he  
carved.  They talked all the time with unflagging zest.  Then he  
wiped the dishes she had washed, and they went out down the  
fields.  There was a bright little brook that ran into a bog at the foot  
of a very steep bank.  Here they wandered, picking still a few  
marsh-marigolds and many big blue forget-me-nots.  Then she sat  
on the bank with her hands full of flowers, mostly golden water-blobs.  As she put her face down into the marigolds, it was all overcast   
with a yellow shine.  
</p><p>"Your face is bright," he said, "like a transfiguration."  
</p><p>She looked at him, questioning.  He laughed pleadingly to her,  
laying his hands on hers.  Then he kissed her fingers, then her face.  
</p><p>The world was all steeped in sunshine, and quite still, yet not  
asleep, but quivering with a kind of expectancy.  
</p><p>"I have never seen anything more beautiful than this," he said.   
He held her hand fast all the time.  
</p><p>"And the water singing to itself as it runs &mdash; do you love it?" She  
looked at him full of love.  His eyes were very dark, very bright.  
</p><p>"Don't you think it's a great day?" he asked.  
</p><p>She murmured her assent.  She was happy, and he saw it.  
</p><p>"And our day &mdash; just between us," he said.  
</p><p>They lingered a little while.  Then they stood up upon the sweet  
thyme, and he looked down at her simply.  
</p><p>"Will you come?" he asked.  
</p><p>They went back to the house, hand in hand, in silence.  The  
  
  
<pb n="302"/>   
  
chickens came scampering down the path to her.  He locked the  
door, and they had the little house to themselves.  
</p><p>He never forgot seeing her as she lay on the bed, when he was  
unfastening his collar.  First he saw only her beauty, and was  
blind with it.  She had the most beautiful body he had ever imagined.    
He stood unable to move or speak, looking at her, his face  
half-smiling with wonder.  And then he wanted her, but as he went  
forward to her, her hands lifted in a little pleading movement, and  
he looked at her face, and stopped.  Her big brown eyes were  
watching him, still and resigned and loving; she lay as if she had  
given herself up to sacrifice: there was her body for him; but the  
look at the back of her eyes, like a creature awaiting immolation,  
arrested him, and all his blood fell back.  
</p><p>"You are sure you want me?" he asked, as if a cold shadow had  
come over him.  
</p><p>"Yes, quite sure."  
</p><p>She was very quiet, very calm.  She only realised that she was  
doing something for him.  He could hardly bear it.  She lay to be  
sacrificed for him because she loved him so much.  And he had to  
sacrifice her.  For a second, he wished he were sexless or dead.   
Then he shut his eyes again to her, and his blood beat back again.  
</p><p>And afterwards he loved her &mdash; loved her to the last fibre of his  
being.  He loved her.  But he wanted, somehow, to cry.  There was  
something he could not bear for her sake.  He stayed with ber till  
quite late at night.  As he rode home he felt that he was finally initiated.    
He was a youth no longer.  But why had he the dull pain in his  
soul? Why did the thought of death, the after-life, seem so sweet  
and consoling?  
</p><p>He spent the week with Miriam, and wore her out with his passion   
before it was gone.  He had always, almost wilfully, to put  
her out of count, and act from the brute strength of his own feelings.    
And he could not do it often, and there remained afterwards  
always the sense of failure and of death.  If he were really with  
her, he had to put aside himself and his desire.  If he would have  
her, he had to put her aside.  
</p><p>"When I come to you," he asked her, his eyes dark with pain  
and shame, "you don't really want me, do you?"  
</p><p>"Ah, yes!" she replied quickly.  
</p><p>He looked at her.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="303"/>   
<p>"Nay," he said.  
</p><p>She began to tremble.  
</p><p>"You see," she said, taking his face and shutting it out against  
her shoulder &mdash; "you see &mdash; as we are &mdash; how can I get used to you? It  
would come all right if we were married."  
</p><p>He lifted her head, and looked at her.  
</p><p>"You mean, now, it is always too much shock?"  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; and &mdash; "  
</p><p>"You are always clenched against me."  
</p><p>She was trembling with agitation.  
</p><p>"You see," she said, "I'm not used to the thought &mdash; "  
</p><p>"You are lately," he said.  
</p><p>"But all my life, mother said to me: 'There is one thing in  
marriage that is always dreadful, but you have to bear it.' And I  
believed it."  
</p><p>"And still believe it," he said.  
</p><p>"No!" she cried hastily.  "I believe, as you do, that loving, even  
in that way, is the high-water mark of living."  
</p><p>"That doesn't alter the fact that you never want it."  
</p><p>"No," she said, taking his head in her arms and rocking in  
despair.  "Don't say so! You don't understand." She rocked with  
pain.  "Don't I want your children?"  
</p><p>"But not me."  
</p><p>"How can you say so? But we must be married to have  
children &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Shall we be married, then? I want you to have my children."  
</p><p>He kissed her hand reverently.  She pondered sadly, watching him.   
</p><p>"We are too young," she said at length.  
</p><p>"Twenty-four and twenty-three-"  
</p><p>"Not yet," she pleaded, as she rocked herself in distress.   
</p><p>"When you will," he said.  
</p><p>She bowed her head gravely.  The tone of hopelessness in  
which he said these things grieved her deeply.  It had always been  
a failure between them.  Tacitly, she acquiesced in what he felt.  
</p><p>And after a week of love he said to his mother suddenly one  
Sunday night, just as they were going to bed:  
</p><p>"I shan't go so much to Miriam's, mother."  
</p><p>She was surprised, but she would not ask him anything.  
</p><p>"You please yourself," she said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="304"/>   
  
<p>So he went to bed.  But there was a new quietness about him  
which she had wondered at.  She almost guessed.  She would leave  
him alone, however.  Precipitation might spoil things.  She watched  
him in his loneliness, wondering where he would end.  He was sick,  
and much too quiet for him.  There was a perpetual little knitting  
of his brows, such as she had seen when he was a small baby,  
and which had been gone for many years.  Now it was the same  
again.  And she could do nothing for him.  He had to go on alone,  
make his own way.  
</p><p>He continued faithful to Miriam.  For one day he had loved her  
utterly.  But it never came again.  The sense of failure grew stronger.   
At first it was only a sadness.  Then he began to feel he could not  
go on.  He wanted to run, to go abroad, anything.  Gradually he  
ceased to ask her to have him.  Instead of drawing them together,  
it put them apart.  And then he realised, consciously, that it  
was no good.  It was useless trying: it would never be a  
success between them.  
</p><p>For some months he had seen very little of Clara.  They had   
occasionally walked out for half an hour at dinner-time.  But he   
always reserved himself for Miriam.  With Clara, however, his  
brow cleared, and he was gay again.  She treated him indulgently,  
as if he were a child.  He thought he did not mind.  But deep below  
the surface it piqued him.  
</p><p>Sometimes Miriam said:  
</p><p>"What about Clara? I hear nothing of her lately."  
</p><p>"I walked with her about twenty minutes yesterday," he replied.  
</p><p>"And what did she talk about?"  
</p><p>"I don't know.  I suppose I did all the jawing &mdash; I usually do.  I  
think I was telling her about the strike, and how the women took  
it."  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>So he gave the account of himself.  
</p><p>But insidiously, without his knowing it, the warmth he felt for  
Clara drew him away from Miriam, for whom he felt responsible,  
and to whom he felt he belonged.  He thought he was being quite  
faithful to her.  It was not easy to estimate exactly the strength and  
warmth of one's feelings for a woman till they have run away with  
one.  
</p><p>He began to give more time to his men friends.  There was Jessop,  
  
  
<pb n="305"/>   
  
at the art school; Swain, who was chemistry demonstrator  
at the university; Newton, who was a teacher; besides Edgar and  
Miriam's younger brothers.  Pleading work, he sketched and studied   
with Jessop.  He called in the university for Swain, and the two  
went "down town" together.  Having come home in the train with  
Newton, he called and had a game of billiards with him in the  
Moon and Stars.  If he gave to Miriam the excuse of his men  
friends, he felt quite justified.  His mother began to be relieved.  He  
always told her where he had been.  
</p><p>During the summer Clara wore sometimes a dress of soft cotton  
stuff with loose sleeves.  When she lifted her hands, her sleeves fell  
back, and her beautiful strong arms shone out.  
</p><p>"Half a minute," he cried.  "Hold your arm still."  
</p><p>He made sketches of her hand and arm, and the drawings contained   
some of the fascination the real thing had for him.  Miriam,  
who always went scrupulously through his books and papers,  
saw the drawings.  
</p><p>"I think Clara has such beautiful arms," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes! When did you draw them?"  
</p><p>"On Tuesday, in the work-room.  You know, I've got a comer  
where I can work.  Often I can do every single thing they need in the  
department, before dinner.  Then I work for myself in the afternoon,   
and just see to things at night."  
</p><p>"Yes," she said, turning the leaves of his sketch-book.  
</p><p>Frequently he hated Miriam.  He hated her as she bent forward  
and pored over his things.  He hated her way of patiently casting  
him up, as if he were an endless psychological account.  When he  
was with her, he hated her for having got him, and yet not got  
him, and he tortured her.  She took all and gave nothing, he said.   
At least, she gave no living warmth.  She was never alive, and giving   
off life.  Looking for her was like looking for something which  
did not exist.  She was only his conscience, not his mate.  He hated  
her violently, and was more cruel to ber.  They dragged on till the  
next summer.  He saw more and more of Clara.  
</p><p>At last he spoke.  He had been sitting working at home one evening.    
There was between him and his mother a peculiar condition  
of people frankly finding fault with each other.  Mrs. Morel was  
strong on her feet again.  He was not going to stick to Miriam.  Very  
well; then she would stand aloof till he said something.  It had been  
  
  
<pb n="306"/>   
  
coming a long time, this bursting of the storm in him, when he  
would come back to her.  This evening there was between them a  
peculiar condition of suspense.  He worked feverishly and mechanically,   
so that he could escape from himself.  It grew late.  Through  
the open door, stealthily, came the scent of madonna lilies, almost  
as if it were prowling abroad.  Suddenly he got up and went out of  
doors.  
</p><p>The beauty of the night made him want to shout.  A half-moon,  
dusky gold, was sinking behind the black sycamore at the end of  
the garden, making the sky dull purple with its glow.  Nearer, a  
dim white fence of lilies went across the garden, and the air all  
round seemed to stir with scent, as if it were alive.  He went across  
the bed of pinks, whose keen perfume came sharply across  
the rocking, heavy scent of the lilies, and stood alongside the white  
barrier of flowers.  They flagged all loose, as if they were panting.   
The scent made him drunk.  He went down to the field to watch the  
moon sink under.  
</p><p>A corncrake in the hay-close called insistently.  The moon slid  
quite quickly downwards, growing more flushed.  Behind him the  
great flowers leaned as if they were calling.  And then, like a shock,  
he caught another perfume, something raw and coarse. Hunting  
round, he found the purple iris, touched their fleshy throats and  
their dark, grasping hands.  At any rate, he had found something.   
They stood stiff in the darkness.  Their scent was brutal.  The moon  
was melting down upon the crest of the hill.  It was gone; all was  
dark.  The corncrake called still.  
</p><p>Breaking off a pink, he suddenly went indoors.  
</p><p>"Come, my boy," said his mother.  "I'm sure it's time you went  
to bed."  
</p><p>He stood with the pink against his lips.  
</p><p>"I shall break off with Miriam, mother," he answered calmly.  
</p><p>She looked up at him over her spectacles.  He was staring back at  
her, unswerving.  She met his eyes for a moment, then took off her  
glasses.  He was white.  The male was up in him, dominant.  She did  
not want to see him too clearly.  
</p><p>"But I thought &mdash; " she began.  
</p><p>"Well," he answered, "I don't love her.  I don't want to marry  
her &mdash; so I shall have done."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="307"/>   
<p>"But," exclaimed his mother, amazed, "I thought lately you had  
made up your mind to have her, and so I said nothing."  
</p><p>"I had &mdash; I wanted to &mdash; but now I don't want.  It's no good.  I shall  
break off on Sunday.  I ought to, oughtn't I?"  
</p><p>"You know best.  You know I said so long ago."  
</p><p>"I can't help that now.  I shall break off on Sunday."  
</p><p>"Well," said his mother, "I think it will be best.  But lately I   
decided you had made up your mind to have her, so I said nothing,  
and should have said nothing.  But I say as I have always said, I  
don't think she is suited to you."  
</p><p>"On Sunday I break off," he said, smelling the pink.  He put the  
flower in his mouth.  Unthinking, he bared his teeth, closed them on  
the blossom slowly, and had a mouthful of petals.  These he spat  
into the fire, kissed his mother, and went to bed.  
</p><p>On Sunday he went up to the farm in the early afternoon.  He had  
written Miriam that they would walk over the fields to Hucknall.   
His mother was very tender with him.  He said nothing.  But she saw  
the effort it was costing.  The peculiar set look on his face stilled  
her.  
</p><p>"Never mind, my son," she said.  "You will be so much better  
when it is all over.  "  
</p><p>Paul glanced swiftly at his mother in surprise and resentment.   
He did not want sympathy.  
</p><p>Miriam met him at the lane-end.  She was wearing a new dress  
of figured muslin that had short sleeves.  Those short sleeves, and  
Miriam's brown-skinned arms beneath them-such pitiful, resigned   
arms &mdash; gave him so much pain that they helped to make him  
cruel.  She had made herself look so beautiful and fresh for him.   
She seemed to blossom for him alone.  Every time he looked at her  
&mdash; a mature young woman now, and beautiful in her new dress &mdash; it  
hurt so much that his heart seemed almost to be bursting with the  
restraint he put on it.  But he had decided, and it was irrevocable.  
</p><p>On the hills they sat down, and he lay with his head in her lap,  
whilst she fingered his hair.  She knew that "he was not there," as  
she put it.  Often, when she had him with her, she looked for him,  
and could not find him.  But this afternoon she was not prepared.  
</p><p>It was nearly five o'clock when he told her.  They were sitting  
on the bank of a stream, where the lip of turf hung over a hollow  
  
  
<pb n="308"/>   
  
bank of yellow earth, and he was hacking away with a stick, as he  
did when he was perturbed and cruel.  
</p><p>"I have been thinking," he said, "we ought to break off."  
</p><p>"Why?" she cried in surprise.  
</p><p>"Because it's no good going on."  
</p><p>"Why is it no good?"  
</p><p>"It isn't.  I don't want to marry.  I don't want ever to marry.  And  
if we're not going to marry, it's no good going on."  
</p><p>"But why do you say this now?"  
</p><p>"Because I've made up my mind."  
</p><p>"And what about these last months, and the things you told me  
then?"  
</p><p>"I can't help it! I don't want to go on."  
</p><p>"You don't want any more of me?"  
</p><p>"I want us to break off &mdash; you be free of me, I free of you."  
</p><p>"And what about these last months?"  
</p><p>"I don't know.  I've not told you anything but what I thought was  
true."  
</p><p>"Then why are you different now?"  
</p><p>"I'm not &mdash; I'm the same &mdash; only I know it's no good going on."  
</p><p>"You haven't told me why it's no good."  
</p><p>"Because I don't want to go on &mdash; and I don't want to marry."  
</p><p>"How many times have you offered to marry me, and I  
wouldn't?"  
</p><p>"I know; but I want us to break off."  
</p><p>There was silence for a moment or two, while he dug viciously  
at the earth.  She bent her head, pondering.  He was an unreasonable   
child.  He was like an infant which, when it has drunk its fill,  
throws away and smashes the cup.  She looked at him, feeling she  
could get hold of him and wring some consistency out of him. But  
she was helpless.  Then she cried:  
</p><p>"I have said you were only fourteen &mdash; you are only four!"  
</p><p>He still dug at the earth viciously.  He heard.  
</p><p>"You are a child of four," she repeated in her anger.  
</p><p>He did not answer, but said in his heart: "All right; if I'm a child  
of four, what do you want me for? I don't want another mother."  
But he said nothing to her, and there was silence.  
</p><p>"And have you told your people?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I have told my mother."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="309"/>   
<p>There was another long interval of silence.  
</p><p>"Then what do you want?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Why, I want us to separate.  We have lived on each other all  
these years; now let us stop.  I will go my own way without you,  
and you will go your way without me.  You will have an independent   
life of your own then."  
</p><p>There was in it some truth that, in spite of her bitterness, she  
could not help registering.  She knew she felt in a sort of bondage  
to him, which she hated because she could not control it.  She  
hated her love for him from the moment it grew too strong for her.   
And, deep down, she had hated him because she loved him and he  
dominated her.  She had resisted his domination.  She had fought  
to keep herself free of him in the last issue.  And she was free of  
him, even more than he of her.  
</p><p>"And," he continued, "we shall always be more or less each  
other's work.  You have done a lot for me, I for you.  Now let us  
start and live by ourselves."  
</p><p>"What do you want to do?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Nothing &mdash; only to be free," he answered.  
</p><p>She, however, knew in her heart that Clara's influence was over  
him to liberate him.  But she said nothing.  
</p><p>"And what have I to tell my mother?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I told my mother," he answered, "that I was breaking off &mdash; clean  
and altogether."  
</p><p>"I shall not tell them at home," she said.  
</p><p>Frowning, "You please yourself," he said.  
</p><p>He knew he had landed her in a nasty hole, and was leaving her  
in the lurch.  It angered him.  
</p><p>"Tell them you wouldn't and won't marry me, and have broken  
off," he said.  "It's true enough."  
</p><p>She bit her finger moodily.  She thought over their whole affair.   
She had known it would come to this; she had seen it all along.   
It chimed with her bitter expectation.  
</p><p>"Always &mdash; it has always been so!" she cried.  "It has been one  
long battle between us &mdash; you fighting away from me."  
</p><p>It came from her unawares, like a flash of lightning.  The man's  
heart stood still.  Was this how she saw it?  
</p><p>"But we've had some perfect hours, some perfect times, when  
we were together!" he pleaded.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="310"/>   
  
<p>"Never!" she cried; "never! It has always been you fighting me  
off."  
</p><p>"Not always &mdash; not at first!" he pleaded.  
</p><p>"Always, from the very beginning &mdash; always the same!"  
</p><p>She had finished, but she had done enough.  He sat aghast.  He  
had wanted to say: "It has been good, but it is at an end." And  
she &mdash; she whose love he had believed in when he had despised  
himself &mdash; denied that their love had ever been love.  "He had always  
fought away from her?" Then it had been monstrous.  There had  
never been anything really between them; all the time he had been  
imagining something where there was nothing.  And she had  
known.  She had known so much, and had told him so little.  She  
had known all the time.  All the time this was at the bottom of her!  
</p><p>He sat silent in bitterness.  At last the whole affair appeared in a  
cynical aspect to him.  She had really played with him, not he with  
her.  She had hidden all her condemnation from him, had flattered  
him, and despised him.  She despised him now.  He grew intellectual  
and cruel.  
</p><p>"You ought to marry a man who worships you," he said; "then  
you could do as you liked with him.  Plenty of men will worship  
you, if you get on the private side of their natures.  You ought to  
marry one such.  They would never fight you off."  
</p><p>"Thank you!" she said.  "But don't advise me to marry someone   
else any more.  You've done it before."  
</p><p>"Very well," he said; "I will say no more."  
</p><p>He sat still, feeling as if he had had a blow, instead of giving  
one.  Their eight years of friendship and love, the eight years of  
his life, were nullified.  
</p><p>"When did you think of this?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I thought definitely on Thursday night."  
</p><p>"I knew it was coming," she said.  
</p><p>That pleased him bitterly.  "Oh, very well! If she knew then it  
doesn't come as a surprise to her," he thought.  
</p><p>"And have you said anything to Clara?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No; but I shall tell her now."  
</p><p>There was a silence.  
</p><p>"Do you remember the things you said this time last year, in  
my grandmother's house &mdash; nay last month even?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="311"/>   
<p>"Yes," he said; "I do! And I meant them! I can't help that it's  
failed."  
</p><p>"It has failed because you want something else."  
</p><p>"It would have failed whether or not.  You never believed in  
me."  
</p><p>She laughed strangely.  
</p><p>He sat in silence.  He was full of a feeling that she had deceived  
him.  She had despised him when he thought she worshipped him.   
She had let him say wrong things, and had not contradicted him.   
She had let him fight alone.  But it stuck in his throat that she had  
despised him whilst he thought she worshipped him.  She should  
have told him when she found fault with him.  She had not played  
fair.  He hated her.  All these years she had treated him as if he were  
a hero, and thought of him secretly as an infant, a foolish child.  
Then why had she left the foolish child to his folly? His heart was  
hard against her.  
</p><p>She sat full of bitterness.  She had known &mdash; oh, well she had  
known! All the time he was away from her she had summed him  
up, seen his littleness, his meanness, and his folly.  Even she had  
guarded her soul against him.  She was not overthrown, not  
prostrated, not even much hurt.  She had known.  Only why, as he  
sat there, had he still this strange dominance over her? His very  
movements fascinated her as if she were hypnotised by him.  Yet  
he was despicable, false, inconsistent, and mean.  Why this  
bondage for her? Why was it the movement of his arm stirred her  
as nothing else in the world could? Why was she fastened to him?  
Why, even now, if he looked at her and commanded her, would  
she have to obey? She would obey him in his trifling commands.   
But once he was obeyed, then she had him in her power, she knew,  
to lead him where she would.  She was sure of herself.  Only, this  
new influence! Ah, he was not a man! He was a baby that cries for  
the newest toy.  And all the attachment of his soul would not keep  
him.  Very well, he would have to go.  But he would come back when  
he had tired of his new sensation.  
</p><p>He hacked at the earth till she was fretted to death.  She rose.   
He sat flinging lumps of earth in the stream.  
</p><p>"We will go and have tea here?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes," she answered.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="312"/>   
  
<p>They chattered over irrelevant subjects during tea.  He held forth  
on the love of ornament &mdash; the cottage parlour moved him thereto &mdash;  
and its connection with aesthetics.  She was cold and quiet.  As they  
walked home, she asked:  
</p><p>"And we shall not see each other?"  
</p><p>"No &mdash; or rarely," he answered.  
</p><p>"Nor write?" she asked, almost sarcastically.  
</p><p>"As you will," he answered.  "We're not strangers &mdash; never should  
be, whatever happened.  I will write to you now and again.  You  
please yourself."  
</p><p>"I see!" she answered cuttingly.  
</p><p>But he was at that stage at which nothing else hurts.  He had made  
a great cleavage in his life.  He had had a great shock when she had  
told him their love had been always a conflict.  Nothing more mattered.    
If it never had been much, there was no need to make a fuss  
that it was ended.  
</p><p>He left her at the lane-end.  As she went home, solitary, in her  
new frock, having her people to face at the other end, he stood still  
with shame and pain in the highroad, thinking of the suffering he  
caused her.  
</p><p>In the reaction towards restoring his self-esteem, he went into  
the Willow Tree for a drink.  There were four girls who had been  
out for the day, drinking a modest glass of port.  They had some  
chocolates on the table.  Paul sat near with his whisky.  He noticed  
the girls whispering and nudging.  Presently one, a bonny dark  
hussy, leaned to him and said:  
</p><p>"Have a chocolate?"  
</p><p>The others laughed loudly at her impudence.  
</p><p>"All right," said Paul.  "Give me a hard one &mdash; nut.  I don't like  
creams."  
</p><p>"Here you are, then," said the girl; "here's an almond for you."  
</p><p>She held the sweet between her fingers.  He opened his mouth.  
She popped it in, and blushed.  
</p><p>"You are nice!" he said.  
</p><p>"Well," she answered, "we thought you looked overcast, and  
they dared me offer you a chocolate."  
</p><p>"I don't mind if I have another &mdash; another sort," he said.  
</p><p>And presently they were all laughing together.  
</p><p>It was nine o'clock when he got home, falling dark.  He entered  
  
  
<pb n="313"/>   
the house in silence.  His mother, who had been waiting, rose  
anxiously.  
</p><p>"I told her," he said.  
</p><p>"I'm glad," replied the mother, with great relief.  
</p><p>He hung up his cap wearily.  
</p><p>"I said we'd have done altogether," be said.  
</p><p>"That's right, my son," said the mother.  "It's hard for her now,  
but best in the long run.  I know.  You weren't suited for her."  
</p><p>He laughed shakily as he sat down.  
</p><p>"I've had such a lark with some girls in a pub," he said.  
</p><p>His mother looked at him.  He had forgotten Miriam now.  He  
told her about the girls in the Willow Tree.  Mrs. Morel looked at  
him.  It seemed unreal, his gaiety.  At the back of it was too much  
horror and misery.  
</p><p>"Now have some supper," she said very gently.  
</p><p>Afterwards he said wistfully:  
</p><p>"She never thought she'd have me, mother, not from the first,  
and so she's not disappointed."  
</p><p>"I'm afraid," said his mother, "she doesn't give up hopes of you  
yet."  
</p><p>"No," he said, "perhaps not."  
</p><p>"You'll find it's better to have done," she said.  
</p><p>"I don't know," he said desperately.  
</p><p>"Well, leave her alone," replied his mother.  
So he left her, and she was alone.  Very few people cared for  
her, and she for very few people.  She remained alone with herself,  
waiting.</p>

<p>HE was gradually making it possible to earn a livelihood by his  
art.  Liberty's had taken several of his painted designs on various  
stuffs, and he could sell designs for embroideries, for altar-cloths,  
and similar things, in one or two places.  It was not very much he  
made at present, but he might extend it.  He had also made friends  
with the designer for a pottery firm, and was gaining some knowledge  
  
  
<pb n="314"/>   
  
of his new acquaintance's art.  The applied arts interested him  
very much.  At the same time he laboured slowly at his pictures.   
He loved to paint large figures, full of light, but not merely made  
up of lights and cast shadows, like the impressionists; rather  
definite figures that had a certain luminous quality, like some of  
Michael Angelo's people.  And these he fitted into a landscape,  
in what he thought true proportion.  He worked a great deal from  
memory, using everybody be knew.  He believed firmly in his work,  
that it was good and valuable.  In spite of fits of depression, shrinking,   
everything, he believed in his work.  
</p><p>He was twenty-four when he said his first confident thing to his  
mother.  
</p><p>"Mother," he said, "I s'll make a painter that they'll attend to."  
</p><p>She sniffed in her quaint fashion.  It was like a half-pleased shrug  
of the shoulders.  
</p><p>"Very well, my boy, we'll see," she said.  
</p><p>"You shall see, my pigeon! You see if you're not swanky one  
of these days!"  
</p><p>"I'm quite content, my boy," she smiled.  
</p><p>"But you'll have to alter.  Look at you with Minnie!"  
</p><p>Minnie was the small servant, a girl of fourteen.  
</p><p>"And what about Minnie?" asked Mrs. Morel, with dignity.  
</p><p>"I heard her this morning: 'Eh, Mrs. Morel! I was going to do  
that,' when you went out in the rain for some coal," he said.  "That  
looks a lot like your being able to manage servants!"  
</p><p>"Well, it was only the child's niceness," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"And you apologising to her: 'You can't do two things at once,  
can you?'"  
</p><p>"She was busy washing up," replied Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>"And what did she say? 'It could easy have waited a bit.  Now  
look how your feet paddle!'"  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; brazen young baggage!" said Mrs. Morel, smiling.  
</p><p>He looked at his mother, laughing.  She was quite warm and rosy  
again with love of him.  It seemed as if all the sunshine were on her  
for a moment.  He continued his work gladly.  She seemed so well  
when she was happy that he forgot her grey hair.  
</p><p>And that year she went with him to the Isle of Wight for  
a holiday.  It was too exciting for them both, and too beautiful.   
Mrs. Morel was full of joy and wonder.  But he would have her  
  
  
<pb n="315"/>   
  
walk with him more than she was able.  She bad a bad fainting bout.   
So grey her face was, so blue her mouth! It was agony to him.  He  
felt as if someone were pushing a knife in his chest.  Then she was  
better again, and he forgot.  But the anxiety remained inside him,  
like a wound that did not close.  
</p><p>After leaving Miriam he went almost straight to Clara.  On the  
Monday following the day of the rupture he went down to the  
work-room.  She looked up at him and smiled.  They had grown  
very intimate unawares.  She saw a new brightness about him.  
</p><p>"Well, Queen of Sheba!" he said, laughing.  
</p><p>"But why?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I think it suits you.  You've got a new frock on."  
</p><p>She flushed, asking:  
</p><p>"And what of it?"  
</p><p>"Suits you &mdash; awfully! I could design you a dress."  
</p><p>"How would it be?"  
</p><p>He stood in front of her, his eyes glittering as he expounded.   
He kept her eyes fixed with his.  Then suddenly he took hold of  
her.  She half-started back.  He drew the stuff of her blouse tighter,  
smoothed it over her breast.  
</p><p>"More so!" he explained.  
</p><p>But they were both of them flaming with blushes, and immediately   
he ran away.  He had touched her.  His whole body was  
quivering with the sensation.  
</p><p>There was already a sort of secret understanding between them.   
The next evening he went to the cinematograph with her for a few  
minutes before train-time.  As they sat, he saw her hand lying near  
him.  For some moments he dared not touch it.  The pictures  
danced and dithered.  Then he took her hand in his.  It was large  
and firm; it filled his grasp.  He held it fast.  She neither moved nor  
made any sign.  When they came out his train was due.  He hesitated.  
</p><p>"Good-night," she said.  He darted away across the road.  
</p><p>The next day he came again, talking to her.  She was rather  
superior with him.  
</p><p>"Shall we go a walk on Monday?" he asked.  
</p><p>She turned her face aside.  
</p><p>"Shall you tell Miriam?" she replied sarcastically.  
</p><p>"I have broken off with her," he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="316"/>   
  
<p>"When?"  
</p><p>"Last Sunday."  
</p><p>"You quarrelled?"  
</p><p>"No! I had made up my mind.  I told her quite definitely I should  
consider myself free."  
</p><p>Clara did not answer, and he returned to his work.  She was so  
quiet and so superb!  
</p><p>On the Saturday evening he asked her to come and drink coffee  
with him in a restaurant, meeting him after work was over.  She  
came, looking very reserved and very distant.  He had three-quarters of an hour to train-time.  
</p><p>"We will walk a little while," he said.  
</p><p>She agreed, and they went past the Castle into the Park.  He was  
afraid of her.  She walked moodily at his side, with a kind of resentful,   
reluctant, angry walk.  He was afraid to take her hand.  
</p><p>"Which way shall we go?" he asked as they walked in darkness.  
</p><p>"I don't mind."  
</p><p>"Then we'll go up the steps."  
</p><p>He suddenly turned round.  They had passed the Park steps.  She  
stood still in resentment at his suddenly abandoning her.  He  
looked for her.  She stood aloof.  He caught her suddenly in his  
arms, held her strained for a moment, kissed her.  Then he let her  
go.  
</p><p>"Come along," he said, penitent.  
</p><p>She followed him.  He took her hand and kissed her finger-tips.   
They went in silence.  When they came to the light, he let go her  
hand.  Neither spoke till they reached the station.  Then they looked  
each other in the eyes.  
</p><p>"Good-night," she said.  
</p><p>And he went for his train.  His body acted mechanically.  People  
talked to him.  He heard faint echoes answering them.  He was in  
a delirium.  He felt that he would go mad if Monday did not come  
at once.  On Monday he would see her again.  All himself was  
pitched there, ahead.  Sunday intervened.  He could not bear it.  He  
could not see her till Monday.  And Sunday intervened &mdash; hour after  
hour of tension.  He wanted to beat his head against the door of  
the carriage.  But he sat still.  He drank some whisky on the way  
home, but it only made it worse.  His mother must not be upset,  
that was all.  He dissembled, and got quickly to bed.  There he sat,  
  
  
<pb n="317"/>   
  
dressed, with his chin on his knees, staring out of the window at  
the far hill, with its few lights.  He neither thought nor slept, but  
sat perfectly still, staring.  And when at last he was so cold that he  
came to himself, he found his watch had stopped at half-past two.   
It was after three o'clock.  He was exhausted, but still there was the  
torment of knowing it was only Sunday morning.  He went to bed  
and slept.  Then he cycled all day long, till he was fagged out.  And  
he scarcely knew where he had been.  But the day after was Monday.    
He slept till four o'clock.  Then he lay and thought.  He was  
coming nearer to himself-he could see himself, real, somewhere  
in front.  She would go a walk with him in the afternoon.  Afternoon!   
It seemed years ahead.  
</p><p>Slowly the hours crawled.  His father got up; he heard him   
pottering about.  Then the miner set off to the pit, his heavy boots  
scraping the yard.  Cocks were still crowing.  A cart went down the  
road.  His mother got up.  She knocked the fire.  Presently she called  
him softly.  He answered as if he were asleep.  This shell of himself  
did well.  
</p><p>He was walking to the station &mdash; another mile! The train was near  
Nottingham.  Would it stop before the tunnels? But it did not  
matter; it would get there before dinner-time.  He was at Jordan's.   
She would come in half an hour.  At any rate, she would be near.   
He bad done the letters.  She would be there.  Perhaps she bad not  
come.  He ran downstairs.  Ah! he saw her through the glass door.   
Her shoulders stooping a little to her work made him feel he could  
not go forward; he could not stand.  He went in.  He was pale,  
nervous, awkward, and quite cold.  Would she misunderstand him?  
He could not write his real self with this shell.  
</p><p>"And this afternoon," he struggled to say.  "You will come?"  
</p><p>"I think so," she replied, murmuring.  
</p><p>He stood before her, unable to say a word.  She hid her  
face from him.  Again came over him the feeling that he would lose  
consciousness.  He set his teeth and went upstairs.  He had done  
everything correctly yet, and he would do so.  All the morning  
things seemed a long way off, as they do to a man under chloroform.    
He himself seemed under a tight band of constraint.  Then  
there was his other self, in the distance, doing things, entering stuff  
in a ledger, and he watched that far-off him carefully to see he  
made no mistake.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="318"/>   
  
<p>But the ache and strain of it could not go on much longer.  He  
worked incessantly.  Still it was only twelve o'clock.  As if he had  
nailed his clothing against the desk, he stood there and worked,  
forcing every stroke out of himself.  It was a quarter to one;  
he could clear away.  Then he ran downstairs.  
</p><p>"You will meet me at the Fountain at two o'clock," he said.  
</p><p>"I can't be there till half-past."  
</p><p>"Yes!" he said.  
</p><p>She saw his dark, mad eyes.  
</p><p>"I will try at a quarter past."  
</p><p>And he had to be content.  He went and got some dinner.  All  
the time he was still under chloroform, and every minute was  
stretched out indefinitely.  He walked miles of streets.  Then he  
thought he would be late at the meeting-place.  He was at the  
Fountain at five past two.  The torture of the next quarter of  
an hour was refined beyond expression.  It was the anguish of combining   
the living self with the shell.  Then he saw her.  She came!  
And he was there.  
</p><p>"You are late," he said.  
</p><p>"Only five minutes," she answered.  
</p><p>"I'd never have done it to you," he laughed.  
</p><p>She was in a dark blue costume.  He looked at her beautiful  
figure.  
</p><p>"You want some flowers," he said, going to the nearest florist's.   
</p><p>She followed him in silence.  He bought her a bunch of scarlet,  
brick-red carnations.  She put them in her coat, flushing.   
</p><p>"That's a fine colour!" he said.  
</p><p>"I'd rather have had something softer," she said.   
</p><p>He laughed.  
</p><p>"Do you feel like a blot of vermilion walking down the street?"  
he said.  
</p><p>She hung ber head, afraid of the people they met.  He looked  
sideways at her as they walked.  There was a wonderful close down  
on her face near the ear that he wanted to touch.  And a certain  
heaviness, the heaviness of a very full ear of corn that dips slightly  
in the wind, that there was about her, made his brain spin.   
He seemed to be spinning down the street, everything going round.  
</p><p>As they sat in the tramcar, she leaned her heavy shoulder against  
him, and he took her hand.  He felt himself coming round from the  
  
  
<pb n="319"/>   
  
anaesthetic, beginning to breathe.  Her ear, half-hidden among her  
blonde hair, was near to him.  The temptation to loss it was almost  
too great.  But there were other people on top of the car.  It still   
remained to him to kiss it.  After all, he was not himself, he was some  
attribute of hers, like the sunshine that fell on her.  
</p><p>He looked quickly away.  It had been raining.  The big bluff of  
the Castle rock was streaked with rain, as it reared above the flat  
of the town.  They crossed the wide, black space of the Midland  
Railway, and passed the cattle enclosure that stood out white.  Then  
they ran down sordid Wilford Road.  
</p><p>She rocked slightly to the tram's motion, and as she leaned  
against him, rocked upon him.  He was a vigorous, slender man,  
with exhaustless energy.  His face was rough, with rough-hewn  
features, like the common people's; but his eyes under the deep  
brows were so full of life that they fascinated her.  They seemed to  
dance, and yet they were still trembling on the finest balance of  
laughter.  His mouth the same was just going to spring into a laugh  
of triumph, yet did not.  There was a sharp suspense about him.   
She bit her lip moodily.  His hand was hard clenched over hers.  
</p><p>They paid their two halfpennies at the turnstile and crossed the  
bridge.  The Trent was very full.  It swept silent and insidious under  
the bridge, travelling in a soft body.  There had been a great deal  
of rain.  On the river levels were flat gleams of flood  
water.  The sky was grey, with glisten of silver here and there.  In Wilford  
churchyard the dahlias were sodden with rain &mdash; wet black-crimson  
balls.  No one was on the path that went along the green river  
meadow, along the elm-tree colonnade.  
</p><p>There was the faintest haze over the silvery-dark water and the  
green meadow-bank, and the elm-trees that were spangled with  
gold.  The river slid by in a body, utterly silent and swift,   
intertwining among itself like some subtle, complex creature.  Clara walked  
moodily beside him.  
</p><p>"Why," she asked at length, in rather a jarring tone, "did you  
leave Miriam?"  
</p><p>He frowned.  
</p><p>"Because I wanted to leave her," he said.  
</p><p>"Why?"  
</p><p>"Because I didn't want to go on with her.  And I didn't want to  
marry."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="320"/>   
  
<p>She was silent for a moment.  They picked their way down the  
muddy path.  Drops of water fell from the elm-trees.  
</p><p>"You didn't want to marry Miriam, or you didn't want to marry  
at all?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Both," he answered &mdash; "both!"  
</p><p>They had to manoeuvre to get to the stile, because of the pools  
of water.  
</p><p>"And what did she say?" Clara asked.  
</p><p>"Miriam? She said I was a baby of four, and that I always had  
battled her off."  
</p><p>Clara pondered over this for a time.  
</p><p>"But you have really been going with her for some time?" she  
asked.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"And now you don't want any more of her?"  
</p><p>"No.  I know it's no good."  
</p><p>She pondered again.  
</p><p>"Don't you think you've treated her rather badly?" she asked.   
</p><p>"Yes; I ought to have dropped it years back.  But it would have  
been no good going on.  Two wrongs don't make a right."  
</p><p>"How old are you?" Clara asked.   
</p><p>"Twenty-five."  
</p><p>"And I am thirty," she said.  
</p><p>"I know you are."  
</p><p>"I shall be thirty-one &mdash; or am I thirty-one?"  
</p><p>"I neither know nor care.  What does it matter!"  
</p><p>They were at the entrance to the Grove.  The wet, red track,   
already sticky with fallen leaves, went up the steep bank between  
the grass.  On either side stood the elm-trees like pillars along a  
great aisle, arching over and making high up a roof from which the  
dead leaves fell.  All was empty and silent and wet.  She stood on  
top of the stile, and he held both her hands.  Laughing, she looked  
down into his eyes.  Then she leaped.  Her breast came against his;  
he held her, and covered her face with kisses.  
</p><p>They went on up the slippery, steep red path.  Presently she   
released his hand and put it round her waist.  
</p><p>"You press the vein in my arm, holding it so tightly," she said.  
</p><p>They walked along.  His finger-tips felt the rocking of her breast.  
All was silent and deserted.  On  the  left  the  red  wet  plough-land  
  
  
<pb n="321"/>   
showed through the doorways between the elm-boles and their  
branches.  On the right, looking down, they could see the tree-tops  
of elms growing far beneath them, hear occasionally the gurgle of  
the river.  Sometimes there below they caught glimpses of the full,  
soft-sliding Trent, and of water-meadows dotted with small cattle.  
</p><p>"It has scarcely altered since little Kirke White used to come,"  
he said.  
</p><p>But he was watching her throat below the ear, where the flush  
was fusing into the honey-white, and her mouth that pouted disconsolate.    
She stirred against him as she walked, and his body was like a taut string.  
</p><p>Half-way up the big colonnade of elms, where the Grove rose  
highest above the river, their forward movement faltered to an  
end.  He led her across to the grass, under the trees at the edge of  
the path.  The cliff of red earth sloped swiftly down, through trees  
and bushes, to the river that glimmered and was dark between the  
foliage.  The far-below water-meadows were very green.  He and  
she stood leaning against one another, silent, afraid, their bodies  
touching all along.  There came a quick gurgle from the river  
below.  
</p><p>"Why," he asked at length, "did you hate Baxter Dawes?"  
</p><p>She turned to him with a spendid movement.  Her mouth was  
offered him, and her throat; her eyes were half-shut; her breast was  
tilted as if it asked for him.  He flashed with a small laugh, shut his  
eyes, and met her in a long, whole kiss.  Her mouth fused with his;  
their bodies were sealed and annealed.  It was some minutes before  
they withdrew.  They were standing beside the public path.  
</p><p>"Will you go down to the river?" he asked.  
</p><p>She looked at him, leaving herself in his hands.  He went over  
the brim of the declivity and began to climb down.  
</p><p>"It is slippery," he said.  
</p><p>"Never mind," she replied.  
</p><p>The red clay went down almost sheer.  He slid, went from one  
tuft of grass to the next, hanging on to the bushes, making for a  
little platform at the foot of a tree.  There he waited for her,   
laughing with excitement.  Her shoes were clogged with red earth.  It was  
hard for her.  He frowned.  At last he caught her hand, and  
she stood beside him.  The cliff rose above them and fell away below.  
  
<pb n="322"/>   
  
Her colour was up, her eyes flashed.  He looked at the big drop  
below them.  
</p><p>"It's risky," he said; "or messy, at any rate.  Shall we go back?"  
</p><p>"Not for my sake," she said quickly.  
</p><p>"All right.  You see, I can't help you; I should only hinder.  Give  
me that little parcel and your gloves.  Your poor shoes!"  
</p><p>They stood perched on the face of the declivity, under the trees.  
</p><p>"Well, I'll go again," he said.  
</p><p>Away he went, slipping, staggering, sliding to the next tree, into  
which he fell with a slam that nearly shook the breath out of him.   
She came after cautiously, hanging on to the twigs and grasses.  So  
they descended, stage by stage, to the river's brink.  There, to his  
disgust, the flood had eaten away the path, and the red decline  
ran straight into the water.  He dug in his heels and brought himself  
up violently.  The string of the parcel broke with a snap; the brown  
parcel bounded down, leaped into the water, and sailed smoothly  
away.  He hung on to his tree.  
</p><p>"Well, I'll be damned!" he cried crossly.  Then he laughed.  She  
was coming perilously down.  
</p><p>"Mind!" he warned her.  He stood with his back to the tree, waiting.    
"Come now," he called, opening his arms.  
</p><p>She let herself run.  He caught her, and together they stood  
watching the dark water scoop at the raw edge of the bank.  The  
parcel had sailed out of sight.  
</p><p>"It doesn't matter," she said.  
</p><p>He held her close and kissed her.  There was only room for their  
four feet.  
</p><p>"It's a swindle!" he said.  "But there's a rut where a man has  
been, so if we go on I guess we shall find the path again."  
</p><p>The river slid and twined its great volume.  On the other bank  
cattle were feeding on the desolate flats.  The cliff rose high above  
Paul and Clara on their right hand.  They stood against the tree in  
the watery silence.  
</p><p>"Let us try going forward," he said; and they struggled in the  
red clay along the groove a man's nailed boots had made.  They  
were hot and flushed.  Their barkled shoes hung heavy on their  
steps.  At last they found the broken path.  It was littered with rubble   
from the water, but at any rate it was easier.  They cleaned their  
boots with twigs.  His heart was beating thick and fast.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="323"/>   
  
<p>Suddenly, coming on to the little level, he saw two figures of  
men standing silent at the water's edge.  His heart leaped.  They  
were fishing.  He tumed and put his hand up warningly to Clara.   
She hesitated, buttoned her coat.  The two went on together.  
</p><p>The fishermen turned curiously to watch the two intruders on  
their privacy and solitude.  They had had a fire, but it was nearly  
out.  All kept perfectly still.  The men turned again to their fishing,  
stood over the grey glinting river like statues.  Clara went with  
bowed head, flushing; he was laughing to himself.  Directly they  
passed out of sight behind the willows.  
</p><p>"Now they ought to be drowned," said Paul softly.  
</p><p>Clara did not answer.  They toiled forward along a tiny path on  
the river's lip.  Suddenly it vanished.  The bank was sheer red solid  
clay in front of them, sloping straight into the river.  He stood and  
cursed beneath his breath, setting his teeth.  
</p><p>"It's impossible!" said Clara.  
</p><p>He stood erect, looking round.  Just ahead were two islets in  
the stream, covered with osiers.  But they were unattainable.  The  
cliff came down like a sloping wall from far above their heads.   
Behind, not far back, were the fishermen.  Across the river the  
distant cattle fed silently in the desolate afternoon.  He cursed again  
deeply under his breath.  He gazed up the great steep bank.  Was  
there no hope but to scale back to the public path?  
</p><p>"Stop a minute," he said, and, digging his heels sideways into  
the steep bank of red clay, he began nimbly to mount.  He looked  
across at every tree-foot.  At last he found what he wanted.  Two  
beech-trees side by side on the hill held a little level on the upper  
face between their roots.  It was littered with damp leaves, but it  
would do.  The fishermen were perhaps sufficiently out of sight.   
He threw down his rainproof and waved to her to come.  
</p><p>She toiled to his side.  Arriving there, she looked at him heavily,  
dumbly, and laid her head on his shoulder.  He held her fast as he  
looked round.  They were safe enough from all but the small,  
lonely cows over the river.  He sunk his mouth on her throat, where  
he felt her heavy pulse beat under his lips.  Everything was perfectly  
still.  There was nothing in the afternoon but themselves.  
</p><p>When she arose, he, looking on the ground all the time, saw  
suddenly sprinkled on the black wet beech-roots many scarlet  
carnation petals, like splashed drops of blood; and red, small  
  
  
<pb n="324"/>   
  
splashes fell from her bosom, streaming down her dress  to  her  feet.  
</p><p>"Your flowers are smashed," he said.  
</p><p>She looked at him heavily as she put back her hair.  Suddenly he  
put his finger-tips on her cheek.  
</p><p>"Why dost look so heavy?" he reproached her.  
</p><p>She smiled sadly, as if she felt alone in herself.  He caressed her  
cheek with his fingers, and kissed ber.  
</p><p>"Nay!" he said.  "Never thee bother!"  
</p><p>She gripped his fingers tight, and laughed shakily.  Then she  
dropped her hand.  He put the hair back from her brows, stroking  
her temples, kissing them lightly.  
</p><p>"But tha shouldna worrit!" he said softly, pleading.   
</p><p>"No, I don't worry!" she laughed tenderly and resigned.   
</p><p>"Yea, tha does! Dunna thee worrit," he implored, caressing.   
</p><p>"No!" she consoled him, kissing him.  
</p><p>They had a stiff climb to get to the top again.  It took them  
a quarter of an hour.  When he got on to the level grass, he threw  
off his cap, wiped the sweat from his forehead, and sighed.  
</p><p>"Now we're back at the ordinary level," he said.  
</p><p>She sat down, panting, on the tussocky grass.  Her cheeks were  
flushed pink.  He kissed her, and she gave way to joy.  
</p><p>"And now I'll clean thy boots and make thee fit for respectable  
folk," he said.  
</p><p>He kneeled at her feet, worked away with a stick and tufts of  
grass.  She put her fingers in his hair, drew his head to her, and  
kissed it.  
</p><p>"What am I supposed to be doing," he said, looking at her  
laughing; "cleaning shoes or dibbling with love? Answer me that!"  
</p><p>"Just whichever I please," she replied.  
</p><p>"I'm your boot-boy for the time being, and nothing else!" But  
they remained looking into each other's eyes and laughing.  Then  
they kissed with little nibbling kisses.  
</p><p>"T-t-t-t!" he went with his tongue, like his mother.  "I tell you,  
nothing gets done when there's a woman about."  
</p><p>And he returned to his boot-cleaning, singing softly.  She  
touched his thick hair, and he kissed her fingers.  He worked away  
at her shoes.  At last they were quite presentable.  
</p><p>"There you are, you see!" he said.  "Aren't I a great hand at  
  
<pb n="325"/>   
restoring you to respectability? Stand up! There, you look as   
irreproachable as Britannia herself!"  
</p><p>He cleaned his own boots a little, washed his hands in a puddle,  
and sang.  They went on into Clifton village.  He was madly in love  
with her; every movement she made, every crease in her garments,  
sent a hot flash through him and seemed adorable.  
</p><p>The old lady at whose house they had tea was roused into gaiety  
by them.  
</p><p>"I could wish you'd had something of a better day," she said,  
hovering round.  
</p><p>"Nay!" he laughed.  "We've been saying how nice it is."  
</p><p>The old lady looked at him curiously.  There was a peculiar glow  
and charm about him.  His eyes were dark and laughing.  He rubbed  
his moustache with a glad movement.  
</p><p>"Have you been saying so!" she exclaimed, a light rousing in  
her old eyes.  
</p><p>"Truly!" be laughed.  
</p><p>"Then I'm sure the day's good enough," said the old lady.  
</p><p>She fussed about, and did not want to leave them.  
</p><p>"I don't know whetber you'd like some radishes as well," she  
said to Clara; "but I've got some in the garden &mdash; and a cucumber."  
</p><p>Clara flushed.  She looked very handsome.  
</p><p>"I should like some radishes," she answered.  
</p><p>And the old lady pottered off gleefully.  
</p><p>"If she knew!" said Clara quietly to him.  
</p><p>"Well, she doesn't know; and it shows we're nice in ourselves,  
at any rate.  You look quite enough to satisfy an archangel, and I'm  
sure I feel harmless &mdash; so &mdash; if it makes you look nice, and makes  
folk happy when they have us, and makes us happy &mdash; why, we're  
not cheating them out of much!"  
</p><p>They went on with the meal.  When they were going away, the  
old lady came timidly with three tiny dahlias in full blow, neat as  
bees, and speckled scarlet and white.  She stood before Clara,  
pleased with herself, saying:  
</p><p>"I don't know whether &mdash; " and holding the flowers forward in  
her old hand.  
</p><p>"Oh, how pretty!" cried Clara, accepting the flowers.  
</p><p>"Shall she have them all?" asked Paul reproachfully of the old  
woman.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="326"/>   
  
<p>"Yes, she shall have them all," she replied, beaming with joy.   
"You have got enough for your share."  
</p><p>"Ah, but I shall ask her to give me one!" he teased.  
</p><p>"Then she does as she pleases," said the old lady, smiling.  And  
she bobbed a little curtsey of delight.  
</p><p>Clara was rather quiet and uncomfortable.  As they walked  
along, he said:  
</p><p>"You don't feel criminal, do you?"  
</p><p>She looked at him with startled grey eyes.  
</p><p>"Criminal!" she said.  "No."  
</p><p>"But you seem to feel you have done a wrong?"  
</p><p>"No," she said.  "I only think, 'If they knew!'"  
</p><p>"If they knew, they'd cease to understand.  As it is, they do  
understand, and they like it.  What do they matter? Here, with only  
the trees and me, you don't feel not the least bit wrong, do you?"  
</p><p>He took her by the arm, held her facing him, holding her eyes  
with his.  Something fretted him.  
</p><p>"Not sinners, are we?" he said, with an uneasy little frown.  
</p><p>"No," she replied.  
</p><p>He kissed her, laughing.  
</p><p>"You like your little bit of guiltiness, I believe," he said.  "I   
believe Eve enjoyed it, when she went cowering out of Paradise."  
</p><p>But there was a certain glow and quietness about her that made  
him glad.  When he was alone in the railway-carriage, he found himself   
tumultuously happy, and the people exceedingly nice, and the  
night lovely, and everything good.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel was sitting reading when he got home.  Her health  
was not good now, and there had come that ivory pallor into her  
face which he never noticed, and which afterwards he never forgot.    
She did not mention her own ill-health to him.  After all, she  
thought, it was not much.  
</p><p>"You are late!" she said, looking at him.  
</p><p>His eyes were shining; his face seemed to glow.  He smiled to  
her.  
</p><p>"Yes; I've been down Clifton Grove with Clara."  
</p><p>His mother looked at him again.  
</p><p>"But won't people talk?" she said.  
</p><p>"Why? They know she's a suffragette, and so on.  And what if  
they do talk!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="327"/>   
<p>"Of course, there may be nothing wrong in it," said his mother.  
"But you know what folks are, and if once she gets talked  
about &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Well, I can't help it.  Their jaw isn't so almighty important,   
after all."  
</p><p>"I think you ought to consider her."  
</p><p>"So I do! What can people say? &mdash; that we take a walk together.   
I believe you're jealous."  
</p><p>"You know I should be glad if she weren't a married woman."  
</p><p>"Well, my dear, she lives separate from her husband, and talks  
on platforms; so she's already singled out from the sheep, and, as  
far as I can see, hasn't much to lose.  No; her life's nothing to her,  
so what's the worth of nothing? She goes with me &mdash; it becomes  
something.  Then she must pay &mdash; we both must pay! Folk are so  
frightened of paying; they'd rather starve and die."  
</p><p>"Very well, my son.  We'll see how it will end."  
</p><p>"Very well, my mother.  I'll abide by the end."  
</p><p>"We'll see!"  
</p><p>"And she's &mdash; she's awfully nice, mother; she is really! You don't  
know!"  
</p><p>"That's not the same as marrying her."  
</p><p>"It's perhaps better."  
</p><p>There was silence for a while.  He wanted to ask his mother  
something, but was afraid.  
</p><p>"Should you like to know her?" He hesitated.  
</p><p>"Yes," said Mrs. Morel coolly.  "I should like to know what  
she's like."  
</p><p>"But she's nice, mother, she is! And not a bit common!"  
</p><p>"I never suggested she was."  
</p><p>"But you seem to think she's &mdash; not as good as &mdash;  She's better  
than ninety-nine folk out of a hundred, I tell you! She's better, she  
is! She's fair, she's honest, she's straight! There isn't anything   
underhand or superior about her.  Don't be mean about her!"  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel flushed.  
</p><p>"I am sure I am not mean about her.  She may be quite as you  
say, but &mdash; "  
</p><p>"You don't approve," he finished.  
</p><p>"And do you expect me to?" she answered coldly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="328"/>   
  
<p>"Yes! &mdash; yes! &mdash; if you'd anything about you, you'd be glad! Do  
you want to see her?"  
</p><p>"I said I did."  
</p><p>"Then I'll bring her &mdash; shall I bring her here?"  
</p><p>"You please yourself."  
</p><p>"Then I will bring her here &mdash; one Sunday &mdash; to tea.  If you think a  
horrid thing about her, I shan't forgive you."  
</p><p>His mother laughed.  
</p><p>"As if it would make any difference!" she said.  He knew he had  
won.  
</p><p>"Oh, but it feels so fine, when she's there! She's such a queen in  
her way."  
</p><p>Occasionally he still walked a little way from chapel with Miriam  
and Edgar.  He did not go up to the farm.  She, however, was very  
much the same with him, and he did not feel embarrassed in her  
presence.  One evening she was alone when he accompanied her.   
They began by talking books: it was their unfailing topic.  Mrs.  
Morel had said that his and Miriam's affair was like a fire fed on  
books &mdash; if there were no more volumes it would die out.  Miriam,  
for her part, boasted that she could read him like a book, could  
place her finger any minute on the chapter and the line.  He, easily  
taken in, believed that Miriam knew more about him than anyone else.    
So it pleased him to talk to her about himself, like the  
simplest egoist.  Very soon the conversation drifted to his own doings.    
It flattered him immensely that he was of such supreme interest.  
</p><p>"And what have you been doing lately?"  
</p><p>"I &mdash; oh, not much! I made a sketch of Bestwood from the garden,   
that is nearly right at last.  It's the hundredth try."  
</p><p>So they went on.  Then she said:  
</p><p>"You've not been out, then, lately?"  
</p><p>"Yes; I went up Clifton Grove on Monday afternoon with  
Clara."  
</p><p>"It was not very nice weather," said Miriam, "was it?"  
</p><p>"But I wanted to go out, and it was all right.  The Trent is full."  
</p><p>"And did you go to Barton?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No; we had tea in Clifton."  
</p><p>"Did you! That would be nice."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="329"/>   
  
<p>"It was! The jolliest old woman! She gave us several pompom  
dahlias, as pretty as you like."  
</p><p>Miriam bowed her head and brooded.  He was quite unconscious   
of concealing anything from her.  
</p><p>"What made her give them you?" she asked.  
</p><p>He laughed.  
</p><p>"Because she liked us &mdash; because we were jolly, I should think."  
</p><p>Miriam put her finger in her mouth.  
</p><p>"Were you late home?" she asked.  
</p><p>At last he resented her tone.  
</p><p>"I caught the seven-thirty."  
</p><p>"Ha!"  
</p><p>They walked on in silence, and he was angry.  
</p><p>"And how is Clara?" asked Miriam.  
</p><p>"Quite all right, I think."  
</p><p>"That's good!" she said, with a tinge of irony.  "By the way, what  
of her husband? One never hears anything of him."  
</p><p>"He's got some other woman, and is also quite all right," he replied.    
"At least, so I think."  
</p><p>"I see &mdash; you don't know for certain.  Don't you think a position  
like that is hard on a woman?"  
</p><p>"Rottenly hard!"  
</p><p>"It's so unjust!" said Miriam.  "The man does as he likes &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Then let the woman also," he said.  
</p><p>"How can she? And if she does, look at her position!"  
</p><p>"What of it?"  
</p><p>"Why, it's impossible! You don't understand what a woman  
forfeits &mdash; "  
</p><p>"No, I don't.  But if a woman's got nothing but her fair fame to  
feed on, why, it's thin tack, and a donkey would die of it!"  
</p><p>So she understood his moral attitude, at least, and she knew he  
would act accordingly.  
</p><p>She never asked him anything direct, but she got to know  
enough.  
</p><p>Another day, when he saw Miriam, the conversation tumed to  
marriage, then to Clara's marriage with Dawes.  
</p><p>"You see," he said, "she never knew the fearful importance of  
marriage.  She thought it was all in the day's march &mdash; it would have  
to come &mdash; and Dawes &mdash; well, a good many women would have given  
  
  
<pb n="330"/>   
  
their souls to get him; so why not him? Then she developed into  
the femme incomprise, and treated him badly, I'll bet my boots."  
</p><p>"And she left him because he didn't understand her?"  
</p><p>"I suppose so.  I suppose she had to.  It isn't altogether a question  
of understanding; it's a question of living.  With him, she was only  
half-alive; the rest was dormant, deadened.  And the dormant  
woman was the femme incomprise, and she had to be awakened."  
</p><p>"And what about him."  
</p><p>"I don't know.  I rather think he loves her as much as he can, but  
he's a fool."  
</p><p>"It was something like your mother and father," said Miriam.  
</p><p>"Yes; but my mother, I believe, got real joy and satisfaction out  
of my father at first.  I believe she had a passion for him; that's why  
she stayed with him.  After all, they were bound to each other."  
</p><p>"Yes," said Miriam.  
</p><p>"That's what one must have, I think," he continued-"the real,  
real flame of feeling through another person-once, only once, if  
it only lasts three months.  See, my mother looks as if she'd had  
everything that was necessary for her living and developing.  There's  
not a tiny bit of feeling of sterility about her."  
</p><p>"No," said Miriam.  
</p><p>"And with my father, at first, I'm sure she had the real thing.  She  
knows; she has been there.  You can feet it about her, and about  
him, and about hundreds of people you meet every day; and, once  
it has happened to you, you can go on with anything and ripen."  
</p><p>"What happened, exactly?" asked Miriam.  
</p><p>"It's so hard to say, but the something big and intense that  
changes you when you really come together with somebody else.  It  
almost seems to fertilise your soul and make it that you can go on  
and mature."  
</p><p>"And you think your mother had it with your father?"  
</p><p>"Yes; and at the bottom she feels grateful to him for giving it  
her, even now, though they are miles apart."  
</p><p>"And you think Clara never had it?"  
</p><p>"I'm sure."  
</p><p>Miriam pondered this.  She saw what he was seeking-a sort of  
baptism of fire in passion, it seemed to her.  She realised that he  
would never be satisfied till he had it.  Perhaps it was essential to  
him, as to some men, to sow wild oats; and afterwards, when he  
  
  
<pb n="331"/>   
  
was satisfied, he would not rage With restlessness any more, but  
could settle down and give her his life into her hands.  Well, then,  
if he must go, let him go and have his fill &mdash; something big and intense,   
he called it.  At any rate, when he had got it, he would not  
want it &mdash; that he said himself; he would want the other thing that  
she could give him.  He would want to be owned, so that he could  
work.  It seemed to ber a bitter thing that he must go, but she could  
let him go into an inn for a glass of whisky, so she could let him go  
to Clara, so long as it was something that would satisfy a need in  
him, and leave him free for herself to possess.  
</p><p>"Have you told your mother about Clara?" she asked.  
</p><p>She knew this would be a test of the seriousness of his feeling  
for the other woman: she knew he was going to Clara for something   
vital, not as a man goes for pleasure to a prostitute, if he told  
his mother.  
</p><p>"Yes," he said, "and she is coming to tea on Sunday."  
</p><p>"To your house?"  
</p><p>"Yes; I want mater to see her."  
</p><p>"Ah!"  
</p><p>There was a silence.  Things had gone quicker than she thought.  
She felt a sudden bitterness that he could leave her so soon and so  
entirely.  And was Clara to be accepted by his people, who had been  
so hostile to herself?  
</p><p>"I may call in as I go to chapel," she said.  "It is a long time since  
I saw Clara."  
</p><p>"Very well," he said, astonished, and unconsciously angry.  
</p><p>On the Sunday afternoon he went to Keston to meet Clara at  
the station.  As he stood on the platform he was trying to examine  
in himself if he had a premonition.  
</p><p>"Do I feel as if she'd come?" he said to himself, and he tried to  
find out.  His heart felt queer and contracted.  That seemed like  
foreboding.  Then he had a foreboding she would not come! Then  
she would not come, and instead of taking her over the fields home,  
as he had imagined, he would have to go alone.  The train was late;  
the afternoon would be wasted, and the evening.  He hated her for  
not coming.  Why had she promised, then, if she could not keep  
her promise? Perhaps she had missed her train-he himself was  
always missing trains-but that was no reason why she should miss  
this particular one.  He was angry with her; he was furious.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="332"/>   
  
<p>Suddenly he saw the train crawling, sneaking round the comer.   
Here, then, was the train, but of course she had not come.  The  
green engine hissed along the platform, the row of brown carriages  
drew up, several doors opened.  No; she had not come! No! Yes;  
ah, there she was! She had a big black hat on! He was at her side  
in a moment.  
</p><p>"I thought you weren't coming," he said.  
</p><p>She was laughing rather breathlessly as she put out her hand to  
him; their eyes met.  He took her quickly along the platform, talking  
at a great rate to hide his feeling.  She looked beautiful.  In her hat  
were large silk roses, coloured like tarnished gold.  Her costume of  
dark cloth fitted so beautifully over her breast and shoulders.  His  
pride went up as he walked with her.  He felt the station people,  
who knew him, eyed her with awe and admiration.  
</p><p>"I was sure you weren't coming," he laughed shakily.  
</p><p>She laughed in answer, almost with a little cry.  
</p><p>"And I wondered, when I was in the train, whatever I should do  
if you weren't there!" she said.  
</p><p>He caught ber hand impulsively, and they went along the narrow  
twitcher.  They took the road into Nuttall and over the Reckoning  
House Farm.  It was a blue, mild day.  Everywhere the brown leaves  
lay scattered; many scarlet hips stood upon the hedge beside the  
wood.  He gathered a few for her to wear.  
</p><p>"Though, really," he said, as he fitted them into the breast of  
her coat, "you ought to object to my getting them, because of the  
birds.  But they don't care much for rose-hips in this part, where  
they can get plenty of stuff.  You often find the berries going rotten  
in the springtime."  
</p><p>So he chattered, scarcely aware of what he said, only knowing  
he was putting berries in the bosom of her coat, while she stood  
patiently for him.  And she watched his quick hands, so fun of life,  
and it seemed to her she had never seen anything before.  Till now,  
everything had been indistinct.  
</p><p>They came near to the colliery.  It stood quite still and black  
among the corn-fields, its immense heap of slag seen rising almost  
from the oats.  
</p><p>"What a pity there is a coal-pit here where it is so pretty!" said  
Clara.  
</p><p>"Do you think so?" he answered.  "You see, I am so used to it I  
  
  
<pb n="333"/>   
  
should miss it.  No; and I like the pits here and there.  I like the rows  
of trucks, and the headstocks, and the steam in the daytime, and  
the lights at night.  When I was a boy, I always thought a pillar of  
cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night was a pit, with its steam,  
and its lights, and the burning bank, &mdash; and I thought the Lord was  
always at the pit-top."  
</p><p>As they drew near home she walked in silence, and seemed to  
hang back.  He pressed her fingers in his own.  She flushed, but gave  
no response.  
</p><p>"Don't you want to come home?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes, I want to come," she replied.  
</p><p>It did not occur to him that her position in his home would be  
rather a peculiar and difficult one.  To him it seemed just as if one of  
his men friends were going to be introduced to his mother, only  
nicer.  
</p><p>The Morels lived in a house in an ugly street that ran down a  
steep hill.  The street itself was hideous.  The house was rather   
superior to most.  It was old, grimy, with a big bay window, and it  
was semi-detached; but it looked gloomy.  Then Paul opened the  
door to the garden, and all was different.  The sunny afternoon was  
there, like another land.  By the path grew tansy and little trees.   
In front of the window was a plot of sunny grass, with old lilacs  
round it.  And away went the garden, with heaps of dishevelled  
chrysanthemums in the sunshine, down to the sycamore-tree, and  
the field, and beyond one looked over a few red-roofed cottages to  
the hills with all the glow of the autumn afternoon.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel sat in her rocking-chair, wearing her black silk  
blouse.  Her grey-brown hair was taken smooth back from her brow  
and her high temples; her face was rather pale.  Clara, suffering,  
followed Paul into the kitchen.  Mrs. Morel rose.  Clara thought her  
a lady, even rather stiff.  The young woman was very nervous.  She  
had almost a wistful look, almost resigned.  
</p><p>"Mother &mdash; Clara," said Paul.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel held out her hand and smiled.  
</p><p>"He has told me a good deal about you," she said.  
</p><p>The blood flamed in Clara's cheek.  
</p><p>"I hope you don't mind my coming," she faltered.  
</p><p>"I was pleased when he said he would bring you," replied Mrs.  
Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="334"/>   
  
<p>Paul, watching, felt his heart contract with pain.  His mother  
looked so small, and sallow, and done-for beside the luxuriant  
Clara.  
</p><p>"It's such a pretty day, mother!" he said.  "And we saw a jay."  
</p><p>His mother looked at him; he had tumed to her.  She thought  
what a man he seemed, in his dark, well-made clothes.  He was pale  
and detached-looking; it would be hard for any woman to keep  
him.  Her heart glowed; then she was sorry for Clara.  
</p><p>"Perhaps you'll leave your things in the parlour," said Mrs.  
Morel nicely to the young woman.  
</p><p>"Oh, thank you," she replied.  
</p><p>"Come on," said Paul, and he led the way into the little front  
room, with its old piano, its mahogany furniture, its yellowing  
marble mantelpiece.  A fire was burning; the place was littered with  
books and drawing-boards.  "I leave my things lying about," he  
said.  "It's so much easier."  
</p><p>She loved his artist's paraphernalia, and the books, and the  
photos of people.  Soon he was telling her: this was William, this  
was William's young lady in the evening dress, this was Annie and  
her husband, this was Arthur and his wife and the baby.  She felt  
as if she were being taken into the family.  He showed her photos,  
books, sketches, and they talked a little while.  Then they returned  
to the kitchen.  Mrs. Morel put aside her book.  Clara wore a blouse  
of fine silk chiffon, with narrow black-and-white stripes; her hair  
was done simply, coiled on top of her head.  She looked rather  
stately and reserved.  
</p><p>"You have gone to live down Sneinton Boulevard?" said Mrs.  
Morel.  "When I was a girl &mdash; girl, I say! &mdash; when I was a young woman  
we lived in Minerva Terrace."  
</p><p>"Oh, did you!" said Clara.  "I have a friend in number 6."  
</p><p>And the conversation had started.  They talked Nottingham and  
Nottingham people; it interested them both.  Clara was still rather  
nervous; Mrs. Morel was still somewhat on her dignity.  She clipped  
her language very clear and precise.  But they were going to get on  
well together, Paul saw.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel measured herself against the younger woman, and  
found herself easily stronger.  Clara was deferential.  She knew  
Paul's surprising regard for his mother, and she had dreaded the  
meeting, expecting someone rather hard and cold.  She was surprised  
  
  
<pb n="335"/>   
  
to find this little interested woman chatting with such readiness;   
and then she felt, as she felt with Paul, that she would not  
care to stand in Mrs. Morel's way.  There was something so hard  
and certain in his mother, as if she never had a misgiving in her  
life.  
</p><p>Presently Morel came down, ruffled and yawning, from his   
afternoon sleep.  He scratched his grizzled head, he plodded in his  
stocking feet, his waistcoat hung open over his shirt.  He seemed  
incongruous.  
</p><p>"This is Mrs. Dawes, father," said Paul.  
</p><p>Then Morel pulled himself together.  Clara saw Paul's manner  
of bowing and shaking hands.  
</p><p>"Oh, indeed!" exclaimed Morel.  "I am very glad to see you &mdash; I  
am, I assure you.  But don't disturb yourself.  No, no make yourself  
quite comfortable, and be very welcome."  
</p><p>Clara was astonished at this flood of hospitality from the old  
collier.  He was so courteous, so gallant! She thought him most  
delightful.  
</p><p>"And may you have come far?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Only from Nottingham," she said.  
</p><p>"From Nottingham! Then you have had a beautiful day for your  
journey."  
</p><p>Then he strayed into the scullery to wash his hands and face, and  
from force of habit came on to the hearth with the towel to dry  
himself.  
</p><p>At tea Clara felt the refinement and sang-froid of the household.   
Mrs. Morel was perfectly at her ease.  The pouring out the tea and  
attending to the people went on unconsciously, without interrupting   
her in her talk.  There was a lot of room at the oval table; the  
china of dark blue willow-pattern looked pretty on the glossy cloth.   
There was a little bowl of small, yellow chrysanthemums.  Clara felt  
she completed the circle, and it was a pleasure to her.  But she  
was rather afraid of the self-possession of the Morels, father and all.   
She took their tone; there was a feeling of balance.  It was a cool,  
clear atmosphere, where everyone was himself, and in harmony.   
Clara enjoyed it, but there was a fear deep at the bottom of her.  
</p><p>Paul cleared the table whilst his mother and Clara talked.  Clara  
was conscious of his quick, vigorous body as it came and went,  
seeming blown quickly by a wind at its work.  It was almost like  
  
  
<pb n="336"/>   
  
the hither and thither of a leaf that comes unexpected.  Most of  
herself went with him.  By the way she leaned forward, as if listening,   
Mrs. Morel could see she was possessed elsewhere as she  
talked, and again the elder woman was sorry for her.  
</p><p>Having finished, he strolled down the garden, leaving the two  
women to talk.  It was a hazy, sunny afternoon, mild and soft.  Clara  
glanced through the window after him as he loitered among the  
chrysanthemums.  She felt as if something almost tangible fastened  
her to him; yet he seemed so easy in his graceful, indolent movement,   
so detached as he tied up the too-heavy flower branches to  
their stakes, that she wanted to shriek in her helplessness.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel rose.  
</p><p>"You will let me help you wash up," said Clara.  
</p><p>"Eh, there are so few, it will only take a minute," said the  
other.  
</p><p>Clara, however, dried the tea-things, and was glad to be on such  
good terms with his mother; but it was torture not to be able to  
follow him down the garden.  At last she allowed herself to go; she  
felt as if a rope were taken off her ankle.  
</p><p>The afternoon was golden over the hills of Derbyshire.  He  
stood across in the other garden, beside a bush of pale Michaelmas   
daisies, watching the last bees crawl into the hive.  Hearing  
her coming, he turned to her with an easy motion, saying:  
</p><p>"It's the end of the run with these chaps."  
</p><p>Clara stood near him.  Over the low red wall in front was the  
country and the far-off hills, all golden dim.  
</p><p>At that moment Miriam was entering through the garden-door.   
She saw Clara go up to him, saw him turn, and saw them come  
to rest together.  Something in their perfect isolation together made  
her know that it was accomplished between them, that they were,  
as she put it, married.  She walked very slowly down the cinder-track of the long garden.  
</p><p>Clara had pulled a button from a hollyhock spire, and was  
breaking it to get the seeds.  Above her bowed head the pink  
flowers stared, as if defending her.  The last bees were falling  
down to the hive.  
</p><p>"Count your money," laughed Paul, as she broke the flat seeds  
one by one from the roll of coin.  She looked at him.  
</p><p>"I'm well off," she said, smiling.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="337"/>   
<p>"How much? Pf!" He snapped his fingers.  "Can I turn them  
into gold?"  
</p><p>"I'm afraid not," she laughed.  
</p><p>They looked into each other's eyes, laughing.  At that moment  
they became aware of Miriam.  There was a click, and everything  
had altered.  
</p><p>"Hello, Miriam!" he exclaimed.  "You said you'd come!"  
</p><p>"Yes.  Had you forgotten?"  
</p><p>She shook hands with Clara, saying:  
</p><p>"It seems strange to see you here."  
</p><p>"Yes," replied the other; "it seems strange to be here."  
</p><p>There was a hesitation.  
</p><p>"This is pretty, isn't it?" said Miriam.  
</p><p>"I like it very much," replied Clara.  
</p><p>Then Miriam realised that Clara was accepted as she had never  
been.  
</p><p>"Have you come down alone?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>"Yes; I went to Agatha's to tea.  We are going to chapel.  I only  
called in for a moment to see Clara."  
</p><p>"You should have come in here to tea," he said.  
</p><p>Miriam laughed shortly, and Clara turned impatiently aside.  
</p><p>"Do you like the chrysanthemums?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes; they are very fine," replied Miriam.  
</p><p>"Which sort do you like best?" he asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know.  The bronze, I think."  
</p><p>"I don't think you've seen all the sorts.  Come and look.  Come  
and see which are your favourites, Clara."  
</p><p>He led the two women back to his own garden, where the  
tousled bushes of flowers of all colours stood raggedly along the  
path down to the field.  The situation did not embarrass him, to his  
knowledge.  
</p><p>"Look, Miriam; these are the white ones that came from your  
garden.  They aren't so fine here, are they?"  
</p><p>"No," said Miriam.  
</p><p>"But they're hardier.  You're so sheltered; things grow big and  
tender, and then die.  These little yellow ones I like.  Will you have  
some?"  
</p><p>While they were out there the bells began to ring in the church,  
sounding loud across the town and the field.  Miriam looked at the  
  
<pb n="338"/>   
  
tower, proud among the clustering roofs, and remembered the  
sketches he had brought her.  It had been different then, but be had  
not left her even yet.  She asked him for a book to read.  He, ran  
indoors.  
</p><p>"What! is that Miriam?" asked his mother coldly.   
</p><p>"Yes; she said she'd call and see Clara."  
</p><p>"You told her, then?" came the sarcastic answer.   
</p><p>"Yes; why shouldn't I?"  
</p><p>"There's certainly no reason why you shouldn't," said Mrs.  
Morel, and she returned to her book.  He winced from his mother's  
irony, frowned irritably, thinking: "Why can't I do as I like?"  
</p><p>"You've not seen Mrs. Morel before?" Miriam was saying to  
Clara.  
</p><p>"No; but she's so nice!"  
</p><p>"Yes," said Miriam, dropping her head; "in some ways she's  
very fine."  
</p><p>"I should think so."  
</p><p>"Had Paul told you much about her?"  
</p><p>"He had talked a good deal."  
</p><p>"Ha!"  
</p><p>There was silence until he returned with the book.  
</p><p>"When will you want it back?" Miriam asked.  
</p><p>"When you like," he answered.  
</p><p>Clara turned to go indoors, whilst he accompanied Miriam to  
the gate.  
</p><p>"When will you come up to Willey Farm?" the latter asked.  
</p><p>"I couldn't say," replied Clara.  
</p><p>"Mother asked me to say she'd be pleased to see you any time,  
if you cared to come."  
</p><p>"Thank you; I should like to, but I can't say when."  
</p><p>"Oh, very well!" exclaimed Miriam rather bitterly, turning away.  
</p><p>She went down the path with her mouth to the flowers he had  
given her.  
</p><p>"You're sure you won't come in?" he said.  
</p><p>"No, thanks."  
</p><p>"We are going to chapel."  
</p><p>"Ah, I shall see you, then!" Miriam was very bitter.  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>They parted.  He felt guilty towards her.  She was bitter, and she  
  
  
<pb n="339"/>   
  
scorned him.  He still belonged to herself, she believed; yet he  
could have Clara, take her home, sit with her next his mother in  
chapel, give her the same hymn-book he had given herself years  
before.  She heard him running quickly indoors.  
</p><p>But he did not go straight in.  Halting on the plot of grass, he  
beard his mother's voice, then Clara's answer:  
</p><p>"What I hate is the bloodhound quality in Miriam."  
</p><p>"Yes," said his mother quickly, "yes; doesn't it make you hate  
her, now!"  
</p><p>His heart went hot, and he was angry with them for talking  
about the girl.  What right had they to say that? Something in the  
speech itself stung him into a flame of hate against Miriam.  Then  
his own heart rebelled furiously at Clara's taking the liberty of  
speaking so about Miriam.  After all, the girl was the better woman  
of the two, be thought, if it came to goodness.  He went indoors.   
His mother looked excited.  She was beating with her hand rhythmically   
on the sofa-arm, as women do who are wearing out.   
He could never bear to see the movement.  There was a silence;  
then he began to talk.  
</p><p>In chapel Miriam saw him find the place in the hymn-book for  
Clara, in exactly the same way as he used for herself.  And during  
the sermon he could see the girl across the chapel, her hat throwing   
a dark shadow over her face.  What did she think, seeing Clara  
with him? He did not stop to consider.  He felt himself cruel towards  
Miriam.  
</p><p>After chapel he went over Pentrich with Clara.  It was a dark  
autumn night.  They had said good-bye to Miriam, and his heart  
had smitten him as he left the girl alone.  "But it serves her right,"  
he said inside himself, and it almost gave him pleasure to go off  
under her eyes with this other handsome woman.  
</p><p>There was a scent of damp leaves in the darkness.  Clara's hand  
lay warm and inert in his own as they walked.  He was full of conflict.    
The battle that raged inside him made him feel desperate.  
</p><p>Up Pentrich Hill Clara leaned against him as he went.  He slid  
his arm round her waist.  Feeling the strong motion of her body  
under his arm as she walked, the tightness in his chest because of  
Miriam relaxed, and the hot blood bathed him.  He held her closer  
and closer.  
</p><p>Then: "You still keep on with Miriam," she said quietly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="340"/>   
  
<p>"Only talk.  There never was a great deal more than talk between   
us," he said bitterly.  
</p><p>"Your mother doesn't care for her," said Clara.  
</p><p>"No, or I might have married her.  But it's all up really!"  
</p><p>Suddenly his voice went passionate with hate.  
</p><p>"If I was with her now, we should be jawing about the 'Christian  
Mystery', or some such tack.  Thank God, I'm not!"  
</p><p>They walked on in silence for some time.  
</p><p>"But you can't really give her up," said Clara.  
</p><p>"I don't give her up, because there's nothing to give," he said.  
</p><p>"There is for her."  
</p><p>"I don't know why she and I shouldn't be friends as long as we  
live," he said.  "But it'll only be friends."  
</p><p>Clara drew away from him, leaning away from contact with him.  
</p><p>"What are you drawing away for?" he asked.  
</p><p>She did not answer, but drew farther from him.  
</p><p>"Why do you want to walk alone?" he asked.  
</p><p>Still there was no answer.  She walked resentfully, hanging her  
head.  
</p><p>"Because I said I would be friends with Miriam!" he exclaimed.  
</p><p>She would not answer him anything.  
</p><p>"I tell you it's only words that go between us," he persisted,  
trying to take her again.  
</p><p>She resisted.  Suddenly he strode across in front of her, barring  
her way.  
</p><p>"Damn it!" he said.  "What do you want now?"  
</p><p>"You'd better run after Miriam," mocked Clara.  
</p><p>The blood flamed up in him.  He stood showing his teeth.  She  
drooped sulkily.  The lane was dark, quite lonely.  He suddenly  
caught her in his arms, stretched forward, and put his mouth on  
her face in a kiss of rage.  She turned frantically to avoid him.  He  
held her fast.  Hard and relentless his mouth came for her.  Her  
breasts hurt against the wall of his chest.  Helpless, she went loose  
in his arms, and he kissed her, and kissed her.  
</p><p>He heard people coming down the hill.  
</p><p>"Stand up! stand up!" he said thickly, gripping her arm till it  
hurt.  If he had let go, she would have sunk to the ground.  
</p><p>She sighed and walked dizzily beside him.  They went on in  
silence.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="341"/>   
<p> "We will go over the fields," he said; and then she woke up.  
</p><p> But she let herself be helped over the stile, and she walked in  
silence with him over the first dark field.  It was the way to Nottingham   
and to the station, she knew.  He seemed to be looking about.   
They came out on a bare hilltop where stood the dark figure of the  
ruined windmill.  There be halted.  They stood together high up in  
the darkness, looking at the lights scattered on the night before  
them, handfuls of glittering points, villages lying high and low on  
the dark, here and there.  
</p><p> "Like treading among the stars," he said, with a quaky laugh.   
</p><p> Then he took her in his arms, and held her fast.  She moved  
aside her mouth to ask, dogged and low:  
</p><p> "What time is it?"  
</p><p> "It doesn't matter," he pleaded thickly.  
</p><p> "Yes it does &mdash; yes! I must go!"  
</p><p> "It's early yet," he said.  
</p><p> "What time is it?" she insisted.  
</p><p> All round lay the black night, speckled and spangled with lights.   
</p><p> "I don't know."  
</p><p> She put her hand on his chest, feeling for his watch.  He felt the  
joints fuse into fire.  She groped in his waistcoat pocket, while he  
stood panting.  In the darkness she could see the round, pale face  
of the watch, but not the figures.  She stooped over it.  He was panting   
till he could take her in his arms again.  
</p><p> "I can't see," she said.  
</p><p> "Then don't bother."  
</p><p> "Yes; I'm going!" she said, turning away.  
</p><p> "Wait! I'll look!" But he could not see.  "I'll strike a match."  
</p><p> He secretly hoped it was too late to catch the train.  She saw the  
glowing lantern of his hands as he cradled the light: then his face  
lit up, his eyes fixed on the watch.  Instantly all was dark again.  All  
was black before her eyes; only a glowing match was red near her  
feet.  Where was he?  
</p><p> "What is it?" she asked, afraid.  
</p><p> "You can't do it," his voice answered out of the darkness.  
</p><p>There was a pause.  She felt in his power.  She had heard the ring  
in his voice.  It frightened her.  
</p><p> "What time is it?" she asked, quiet, definite, hopeless.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="342"/>   
  
<p>"Two minutes to nine," he replied, telling the truth with a  
struggle.  
</p><p> "And can I get from here to the station in fourteen minutes?"  
</p><p> "No.  At any rate &mdash; "  
</p><p>She could distinguish his dark form again a yard or so away.  She  
wanted to escape.  
</p><p>"But can't I do it?" she pleaded.  
</p><p>"If you hurry," he said brusquely.  "But you could easily walk  
it, Clara; it's only seven miles to the tram.  I'll come with  
you."  
</p><p> "No; I want to catch the train."  
</p><p> "But why?"  
</p><p> "I do &mdash; I want to catch the train."  
</p><p> Suddenly his voice altered.  
</p><p>"Very well," he said, dry and hard.  "Come along, then."  
</p><p>And he plunged ahead into the darkness.  She ran after him,  
wanting to cry.  Now he was hard and cruel to her.  She ran over the  
rough, dark fields behind him, out of breath, ready to drop.  But  
the double row of lights at the station drew nearer.  Suddenly:  
</p><p>"There she is!" he cried, breaking into a run.  
</p><p>There was a faint rattling noise.  Away to the right the train, like  
a luminous caterpillar, was threading across the night.  The rattling  
ceased.  
</p><p>"She's over the viaduct.  You'll just do it."  
</p><p>Clara ran, quite out of breath, and fell at last into the train.  The  
whistle blew.  He was gone.  Gone! &mdash; and she was in a carriage full  
of people.  She felt the cruelty of it.  
</p><p>He turned round and plunged home.  Before he knew where be  
was he was in the kitchen at home.  He was very pale.  His  
eyes were dark and dangerous-looking, as if he were drank.  His  
mother looked at him.  
</p><p> "Well, I must say your boots are in a nice state!" she said.  
</p><p> He looked at his feet.  Then he took off his overcoat.  His mother  
wondered if he were drunk.  
</p><p> "She caught the train then?" she said.  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p>"I hope her feet weren't so filthy.  Where on earth you dragged  
her I don't know!"  
</p><p> He was silent and motionless for some time.  
</p><p> "Did you like her?" he asked grudgingly at last.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="343"/>   
  
<p> "Yes, I liked her.  But you'll tire of her, my son; you know you will."  
</p><p>He did not answer.  She noticed how he laboured in his  
breathing.  
</p><p> "Have you been running?" she asked.  
</p><p> "We had to run for the train."  
</p><p> "You'll go and knock yourself up.  You'd better drink hot milk."  
</p><p>It was as good a stimulant as he could have, but he refused and  
went to bed.  There he lay face down on the counterpane, and shed  
tears of rage and pain.  There was a physical pain that made him  
bite his lips till they bled, and the chaos inside him left him unable  
to think, almost to feel.  
</p><p>"This is how she serves me, is it?" he said in his heart, over  
and over, pressing his face in the quilt.  And he hated her. Again he  
went over the scene, and again he hated her.  
</p><p>The next day there was a new aloofness about him.  Clara was  
very gentle, almost loving.  But he treated her distantly, with a  
touch of contempt.  She sighed, continuing to be gentle.  He came  
round.  
</p><p>One evening of that week Sarah Bernhardt was at the Theatre  
Royal in Nottingham, giving "La Dame aux Camelias".  Paul  
wanted to see this old and famous actress, and he asked Clara to  
accompany him.  He told his mother to leave the key in the window   
for him.  
</p><p> "Shall I book seats?" he asked of Clara.  
</p><p>"Yes.  And put on an evening suit, will you? I've never seen you  
in it."  
</p><p>"But, good Lord, Clara! Think of me in evening suit at the  
theatre!" he remonstrated.  
</p><p> "Would you rather not?" she asked.  
</p><p> "I will if you want me to; but I s'll feel a fool."  
</p><p> She laughed at him.  
</p><p> "Then feel a fool for my sake, once, won't you?"  
</p><p> The request made his blood flush up.  
</p><p> "I suppose I s'll have to."  
</p><p> "What are you taking a suitcase for?" his mother asked.  
</p><p> He blushed furiously.  
</p><p> "Clara asked me," he said.  
</p><p> "And what seats are you going in?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="344"/>   
  
<p> "Circle &mdash; three-and-six each!"  
</p><p> "Well, I'm sure!" exclaimed his mother sarcastically.  
</p><p> "It's only once in the bluest of blue moons," he said.  
</p><p>He dressed at Jordan's, put on an overcoat and a cap, and met  
Clara in a cafe.  She was with one of her suffragette friends.  She  
wore an old long coat, which did not suit her, and had a little wrap  
over her head, which he hated.  The three went to the theatre  
together.  
</p><p>Clara took off her coat on the stairs, and he discovered she was  
in a sort of semi-evening dress, that left her arms and neck and  
part of her breast bare.  Her hair was done fashionably.  The dress,  
a simple thing of green crape, suited her.  She looked quite grand,  
he thought.  He could see her figure inside the frock, as if that were  
wrapped closely round her.  The firmness and the softness of her  
upright body could almost be felt as he looked at her.  He clenched  
his fists.  
</p><p>And he was to sit all the evening beside her beautiful naked  
arm, watching the strong throat rise from the strong chest, watching   
the breasts under the green stuff, the curve of her limbs in the  
tight dress.  Something in him hated her again for submitting him  
to this torture of nearness.  And he loved her as she balanced her  
head and stared straight in front of her, pouting, wistful, immobile,  
as if she yielded herself to her fate because it was too strong for  
her.  She could not help herself; she was in the grip of something  
bigger than herself.  A kind of eternal look about her, as if she were  
a wistful sphinx, made it necessary for him to kiss her.  He dropped  
his programme, and crouched down on the floor to get it, so that  
he could kiss her hand and wrist.  Her beauty was a torture to him.   
She sat immobile.  Only, when the lights went down, she sank a  
little against him, and he caressed her hand and arm with his  
fingers.  He could smell her faint perfume.  All the time his blood  
kept sweeping up in great white-hot waves that killed his consciousness   
momentarily.  
</p><p>The drama continued.  He saw it all in the distance, going on  
somewhere; he did not know where, but it seemed far away inside  
him.  He was Clara's white heavy arms, her throat, her moving  
bosom.  That seemed to be himself.  Then away somewhere the  
play went on, and he was identified with that also.  There was no  
himself.  The grey and black eyes of Clara, her bosom coming  
  
  
<pb n="345"/>   
  
down on him, her arm that he held gripped between his  
hands, were all that existed.  Then he felt himself small and helpless,   
her towering in her force above him.  
</p><p>Only the intervals, when the lights came up, hurt him expressibly.    
He wanted to run anywhere, so long as it would be dark  
again.  In a maze, he wandered out for a drink.  Then the lights  
were out, and the strange, insane reality of Clara and the drama  
took hold of him again.  
</p><p>The play went on.  But he was obsessed by the desire to kiss the  
tiny blue vein that nestled in the bend of her arm.  He could feel  
it. His whole face seemed suspended till he had put his lips there.   
It must be done.  And the other people! At last he bent quickly  
forward and touched it with his lips.  His moustache brushed the  
sensitive flesh.  Clara shivered, drew away her arm.  
</p><p>When all was over, the lights up, the people clapping, he came  
to himself and looked at his watch.  His train was gone.  
</p><p> "I s'll have to walk home!" he said.  
</p><p> Clara looked at him.  
</p><p> "It is too late?" she asked.  
</p><p> He nodded.  Then he helped her on with her coat.  
</p><p>"I love you! You look beautiful in that dress," he murmured  
over her shoulder, among the throng of bustling people.  
</p><p>She remained quiet.  Together they went out of the theatre.  He  
saw the cabs waiting, the people passing.  It seemed he met a pair  
of brown eyes which hated him.  But he did not know.  He and  
Clara turned away, mechanically taking the direction to the station.  
</p><p> The train had gone.  He would have to walk the ten miles home.  
</p><p> "It doesn't matter," he said.  "I shall enjoy it."  
</p><p>"Won't you," she said, flushing, "come home for the night? I  
can sleep with mother."  
</p><p> He looked at her.  Their eyes met.  
</p><p> "What will your mother say?" he asked.  
</p><p> "She won't mind."  
</p><p> "You're sure?"  
</p><p> "Quite! "  
</p><p> "Shall I come?"  
</p><p> "If you will."  
</p><p> "Very well."  
</p><p> And they turned away.  At the first stopping-place they took  
  
  
<pb n="346"/>   
  
the car.  The wind blew fresh in their faces.  The town was dark;  
the tram tipped in its haste.  He sat with her hand fast in his.   
</p><p> "Will your mother be gone to bed?" he asked.  
</p><p> "She may be.  I hope not."  
</p><p>They hurried along the silent, dark little street, the only people  
out of doors.  Clara quickly entered the house.  He hesitated.  
</p><p>He leaped up the step and was in the room.  Her mother appeared  
in the inner doorway, large and hostile.  
</p><p> "Who have you got there?" she asked.  
</p><p>"It's Mr. Morel; he has missed his train.  I thought we might put  
him up for the night, and save him a ten-mile walk."  
</p><p>"H'm," exclaimed Mrs. Radford.  "That's your look-out! If  
you've invited him, he's very welcome as far as I'm concerned.  
You keep the house!"  
</p><p> "If you don't like me, I'll go away again," he said.  
</p><p>"Nay, nay, you needn't! Come along in! I dunno what you'll  
think of the supper I'd got her."  
</p><p>It was a little dish of chip potatoes and a piece of bacon.  The  
table was roughly laid for one.  
</p><p>"You can have some more bacon," continued Mrs. Radford.   
"More chips you can't have."  
</p><p>"It's a shame to bother you," he said.  
</p><p>"Oh, don't you be apologetic! It doesn't do wi' me! You treated  
her to the theatre, didn't you?" There was a sarcasm in the last  
question.  
</p><p> "Well?" laughed Paul uncomfortably.  
</p><p> "Well, and what's an inch of bacon! Take your coat off."  
</p><p>The big, straight-standing woman was trying to estimate the  
situation.  She moved about the cupboard.  Clara took his coat.  The  
room was very warm and cosy in the lamplight.  
</p><p>"My sirs!" exclaimed Mrs. Radford; "but you two's a pair of  
bright beauties, I must say! What's all that get-up for?"  
</p><p>"I believe we don't know," he said, feeling a victim.  
</p><p>"There isn't room in this house for two such bobby-dazzlers,  
if you fly your kites that high!" she rallied them.  It was a nasty  
thrust.  
</p><p>He in his dinner jacket, and Clara in her green dress and bare  
arms, were confused.  They felt they must shelter each other in that  
little kitchen.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="347"/>   
<p>"And look at that blossom! " continued Mrs. Radford, pointing   
to Clara.  "What does she reckon she did it for?"  
</p><p>Paul looked at Clara.  She was rosy; her neck was warm  
with blushes.  There was a moment of silence.  
</p><p> "You like to see it, don't you?" he asked.  
</p><p>The mother had them in her power.  All the time his heart was  
beating hard, and he was tight with anxiety.  But he would fight her.  
</p><p>"Me like to see it!" exclaimed the old woman.  "What should I  
like to see her make a fool of herself for?"  
</p><p>"I've seen people look bigger fools," he said.  Clara was under  
his protection now.  
</p><p> "Oh, ay! and when was that?" came the sarcastic rejoinder.  
</p><p> "When they made frights of themselves," he answered.  
</p><p>Mrs. Radford, large and threatening, stood suspended on the  
hearthrug, holding her fork.  
</p><p>"They're fools either road," she answered at length, turning to  
the Dutch oven.  
</p><p>"No," he said, fighting stoutly.  "Folk ought to look as well as  
they can."  
</p><p>"And do you call that looking nice!" cried the mother, pointing  
a scornful fork at Clara.  "That &mdash; that looks as if it wasn't properly  
dressed!"  
</p><p>"I believe you're jealous that you can't swank as well," he said  
laughing.  
</p><p>"Me! I could have worn evening dress with anybody, if  
I'dwanted to!" came the scornful answer.  
</p><p>"And why didn't you want to?" he asked pertinently.  "Or did  
you wear it?"  
</p><p>There was a long pause.  Mrs. Radford readjusted the bacon in  
the Dutch oven.  His heart beat fast, for fear he had offended her.  
</p><p>"Me!" she exclaimed at last.  "No, I didn't! And when I was in  
service, I knew as soon as one of the maids came out in bare  
shoulders what sort she was, going to her sixpenny hop!"  
</p><p>"Were you too good to go to a sixpenny hop?" he said.  
</p><p>Clara sat with bowed head.  His eyes were dark and glittering.   
Mrs. Radford took the Dutch oven from the fire, and stood near  
him, putting bits of bacon on his plate.  
</p><p> "There's a nice crozzly bit!" she said.  
</p><p> "Don't give me the best!" he said.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="348"/>   
  
<p> "She's got what she wants," was the answer.  
</p><p>There was a sort of scornful forbearance in the woman's tone  
that made Paul know she was mollified.  
</p><p> "But do have some!" he said to Clara.  
</p><p> She looked up at him with her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.  
</p><p> "No thanks!" she said.  
</p><p> "Why won't you?" he answered carelessly.  
</p><p>The blood was beating up like fire in his veins.  Mrs. Radford  
sat down again, large and impressive and aloof.  He left Clara altogether   
to attend to the mother.  
</p><p> "They say Sarah Bernhardt's fifty," he said.  
</p><p> "Fifty! She's turned sixty!" came the scornful answer.  
</p><p>"Well," he said, "you'd never think it! She made me want to  
howl even now."  
</p><p>"I should like to see myself howling at that bad old baggage!"  
said Mrs. Radford.  "It's time she began to think herself a grandmother,   
not a shrieking catamaran &mdash; "  
</p><p> He laughed.  
</p><p> "A catamaran is a boat the Malays use," he said.  
</p><p> "And it's a word as I use," she retorted.  
</p><p>"My mother does sometimes, and it's no good my telling her,"  
he said.  
</p><p>"I s'd think she boxes your ears," said Mrs. Radford, good-humouredly.  
</p><p>"She'd like to, and she says she will, so I give her a little stool  
to stand on."  
</p><p>"That's the worst of my mother," said Clara.  "She never wants  
a stool for anything."  
</p><p> "But she often can't touch that lady with a long prop," retorted  
Mrs. Radford to Paul.  
</p><p> "I s'd think she doesn't want touching with a prop," he laughed.  
"I shouldn't."  
</p><p> "It might do the pair of you good to give you a crack on the head  
with one," said the mother, laughing suddenly.  
</p><p> "Why are you so vindictive towards me?" he said.  "I've not  
stolen anything from you."  
</p><p> "No; I'll watch that," laughed the older woman.  
</p><p> Soon the supper was finished.  Mrs. Radford sat guard in her  
  
  
<pb n="349"/>   
chair.  Paul lit a cigarette.  Clara went upstairs, returning with a  
sleeping-suit, which she spread on the fender to air.  
</p><p>"Why, I'd forgot all about them!" said Mrs. Radford.  "Where  
have they sprung from?"  
</p><p>"Out of my drawer."  
</p><p>"H'm! You bought 'em for Baxter, an' he wouldn't wear 'em,  
would he?" &mdash; laughing.  "Said he reckoned to do wi'out trousers i'  
bed." She turned confidentially to Paul, saying: "He couldn't bear  
'em, them pyjama things."  
</p><p> The young man sat making rings of smoke.  
</p><p> "Well, it's everyone to his taste," he laughed.  
</p><p> Then followed a little discussion of the merits of pyjamas.  
</p><p> "My mother loves me in them," he said.  "She says I'm a pierrot."  
</p><p> "I can imagine they'd suit you," said Mrs. Radford.  
</p><p>After a while he glanced at the little clock that was ticking on  
the mantelpiece.  It was half-past twelve.  
</p><p>"It is funny," he said, "but it takes hours to settle down to sleep  
after the theatre."  
</p><p> "It's about time you did," said Mrs. Radford, clearing the table.  
</p><p> "Are you tired?" he asked of Clara.  
</p><p> "Not the least bit," she answered, avoiding his eyes.  
</p><p> "Shall we have a game at cribbage?" he said.  
</p><p> "I've forgotten it."  
</p><p>"Well, I'll teach you again.  May we play crib, Mrs. Radford?"  
he asked.  
</p><p> "You'll please yourselves," she said; "but it's pretty late."  
</p><p> "A game or so will make us sleepy," he answered.  
</p><p>Clara brought the cards, and sat spinning her wedding-ring  
whilst he shuffled them.  Mrs. Radford was washing up in the  
scullery.  As it grew later Paul felt the situation getting more and  
more tense.  
</p><p>"Fifteen two, fifteen four, fifteen six, and two's eight &mdash; !"  
</p><p>The clock struck one.  Still the game continued.  Mrs.  
Radford had done all the little jobs preparatory to going to bed, had locked  
the door and filled the kettle.  Still Paul went on dealing and counting.    
He was obsessed by Clara's arms and throat.  He believed he  
could see where the division was just beginning for her breasts.  He  
could not leave her.  She watched his hands, and felt her joints melt  
as they moved quickly.  She was so near; it was almost as if he  
  
  
<pb n="350"/>   
  
touched her, and yet not quite.  His mettle was roused.  He hated  
Mrs. Radford.  She sat on, nearly dropping asleep, but determined  
and obstinate in her chair.  Paul glanced at her, then at Clara.  She  
met his eyes, that were angry, mocking, and hard as steel.  Her  
own answered him in shame.  He knew she, at any rate, was of  
his mind.  He played on.  
</p><p> At last Mrs. Radford roused herself stiffly, and said:  
</p><p> "Isn't it nigh on time you two was thinking o' bed?"  
</p><p>Paul played on without answering.  He hated her sufficiently to  
murder her.  
</p><p>"Half a minute," he said.  
</p><p>The elder woman rose and sailed stubbornly into the scullery,  
returning with his candle, which she put on the mantelpiece.  Then  
she sat down again.  The hatred of her went so hot down his veins,  
he dropped his cards.  
</p><p>"We'll stop, then," he said, but his voice was still a challenge.  
</p><p>Clara saw his mouth shut hard.  Again he glanced at her.  It  
seemed like an agreement.  She bent over the cards, coughing, to  
clear her throat.  
</p><p>"Well, I'm glad you've finished," said Mrs. Radford.  "Here,  
take your things" &mdash; she thrust the warm suit in his hand &mdash; "and this  
is your candle.  Your room's over this; there's only two, so you  
can't go far wrong.  Well, good-night.  I hope you'll rest well."  
</p><p> "I'm sure I shall; I always do," he said.  
</p><p> "Yes; and so you ought at your age," she replied.  
</p><p>He bade good-night to Clara, and went.  The twisting stairs of  
white, scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step.  He  
went doggedly.  The two doors faced each other.  He went in his  
room, pushed the door to, without fastening the latch.  
</p><p>It was a small room with a large bed.  Some of Clara's hair-pins  
were on the dressing-table &mdash; her hair-brush.  Her clothes and some  
skirts hung under a cloth in a comer.  There was actually a pair  
of stockings over a chair.  He explored the room.  Two books of his  
own were there on the shelf.  He undressed, folded his suit, and sat  
on the bed, listening.  Then he blew out the candle, lay down, and  
in two minutes was almost asleep.  Then click! &mdash; he was wide awake  
and writhing in torment.  It was as if, when he had nearly got to  
sleep, something had bitten him suddenly and sent him mad.  He  
sat up and looked at the room in the darkness, his feet doubled  
  
  
<pb n="351"/>   
  
under him, perfectly motionless, listening.  He heard a cat somewhere   
away outside; then the heavy, poised tread of the mother;  
then Clara's distinct voice:  
</p><p> "Will you unfasten my dress?"  
</p><p> There was silence for some time.  At last the mother said:  
</p><p> "Now then! aren't you coming up?"  
</p><p> "No, not yet," replied the daughter calmly.  
</p><p> "Oh, very well then! If it's not late enough, stop a bit longer.  
Only you needn't come waking me up when I've got to sleep."  
</p><p> "I shan't be long," said Clara.  
</p><p>Immediately afterwards Paul heard the mother slowly mounting  
the stairs.  The candlelight flashed through the cracks in his door.   
Her dress brushed the door, and his heart jumped.  Then it was  
dark, and he heard the clatter of her latch.  She was very leisurely  
indeed in her preparations for sleep.  After a long time it was quite  
still.  He sat strung up on the bed, shivering slightly.  His door was  
an inch open.  As Clara came upstairs, he would intercept her.  He  
waited.  All was dead silence.  The clock struck two.  Then he heard  
a slight scrape of the fender downstairs.  Now he could not help  
himself.  His shivering was uncontrollable.  He felt he must go or die.  
</p><p>He stepped off the bed, and stood a moment, shuddering.  Then  
he went straight to the door.  He tried to step lightly.  The first stair  
cracked like a shot.  He listened.  The old woman stirred in her  
bed.  The staircase was dark.  There was a slit of light under the  
stair-foot door, which opened into the kitchen.  He stood a moment.   
Then he went on, mechanically.  Every step creaked, and his back  
was creeping, lest the old woman's door should open behind him  
up above.  He fumbled with the door at the bottom.  The latch  
opened with a loud clack.  He went through into the kitchen, and  
shut the door noisily behind him.  The old woman daren't come now.  
</p><p>Then he stood, arrested.  Clara was kneeling on a pile of white  
underclothing on the hearth-rug, her back towards him, warming  
herself.  She did not look round, but sat crouching on her heels,  
and her rounded beautiful back was towards him, and her face was  
hidden.  She was warming her body at the fire for consolation.  The  
glow was rosy on one side, the shadow was dark and warm on the  
other.  Her arms hung slack.</p>  
  
<pb n="352"/>   
  
<p>He shuddered violently, clenching his teeth and fists hard to  
keep control.  Then he went forward to her.  He put one hand on  
her shoulder, the fingers of the other hand under her chin to raise  
her face.  A convulsed shiver ran through her, once, twice, at his  
touch.  She kept her head bent.  
</p><p>"Sorry!" he murmured, realising that his hands were very cold.  
</p><p>Then she looked up at him, frightened, like a thing that is afraid  
of death.  
</p><p> "My hands are so cold," he murmured.  
</p><p> "I like it," she whispered, closing her eyes.  
</p><p>The breath of her words were on his mouth.  Her arms clasped  
his knees.  The cord of his sleeping-suit dangled against her and  
made her shiver.  As the warmth went into him, his shuddering  
became less.  
</p><p>At length, unable to stand so any more, he raised her, and she  
buried her head on his shoulder.  His hands went over her slowly  
with an ifinite tenderness of caress.  She clung close to him, trying   
to hide herself against him.  He clasped her very fast.  Then at  
last she looked at him, mute, imploring, looking to see if she must  
be ashamed.  
</p><p>His eyes were dark, very deep, and very quiet.  It was as if her  
beauty and his taking it hurt him, made him sorrowful.  He looked  
at her with a little pain, and was afraid.  He was so humble before  
her.  She kissed him fervently on the eyes, first one, then the other,  
and she folded herself to him.  She gave herself.  He held her fast.   
It was a moment intense almost to agony.  
</p><p>She stood letting him adore her and tremble with joy of her.  It  
healed her hurt pride.  It healed her; it made her glad.  It made her  
feel erect and proud again.  Her pride had been wounded inside  
her.  She had been cheapened.  Now she radiated with joy and pride  
again.  It was her restoration and her recognition.  
</p><p>Then he looked at her, his face radiant.  They laughed to each  
other, and he strained her to his chest.  The seconds ticked off, the  
minutes passed, and still the two stood clasped rigid together,  
mouth to mouth, like a statue in one block.  
</p><p>But again his fingers went seeking over her, restless, wandering,  
dissatisfied.  The hot blood came up wave upon wave.  She laid her  
head on his shoulder.  
</p><p> "Come you to my room," he murmured.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="353"/>   
<p>She looked at him and shook her head, her mouth pouting disconsolately,   
her eyes heavy with passion.  He watched her fixedly.  
</p><p> "Yes!" he said.  
</p><p> Again she shook her head.  
</p><p> "Why not?" he asked.  
</p><p>She looked at him still heavily, sorrowfully, and again she shook  
her head.  His eyes hardened, and he gave way.  
</p><p>When, later on, he was back in bed, he wondered why she had  
refused to come to him openly, so that her mother would know.   
At any rate, then things would have been definite.  And she could  
have stayed with him the night, without having to go, as she was,  
to her mother's bed.  It was strange, and he could not understand  
it. And then almost immediately he fell asleep.  
</p><p>He awoke in the morning with someone speaking to him.  Opening   
his eyes, he saw Mrs. Radford, big and stately, looking down  
on him.  She held a cup of tea in her hand.  
</p><p> "Do you think you're going to sleep till Doomsday?" she said.  
</p><p> He laughed at once.  
</p><p> "It ought only to be about five o'clock," he said.  
</p><p>"Well," she answered, "it's half-past seven, whether or not.   
Here, I've brought you a cup of tea."  
</p><p>He rubbed his face, pushed the tumbled hair off his forehead,  
and roused himself.  
</p><p>"What's it so late for!" he grumbled.  
</p><p>He resented being wakened.  It amused her.  She saw his neck  
in the flannel sleeping-jacket, as white and round as a girl's.  He  
rubbed his hair crossly.  
</p><p>"It's no good your scratching your head," she said.  "It won't  
make it no earlier.  Here, an' how long d'you think I'm going to  
stand waiting wi' this here cup?"  
</p><p> "Oh, dash the cup!" he said.  
</p><p> "You should go to bed earlier," said the woman.  
</p><p> He looked up at her, laughing with impudence.  
</p><p> "I went to bed before you did," he said.  
</p><p> "Yes, my Guyney, you did!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"Fancy," he said, stirring his tea, "having tea brought to bed to  
me! My mother'll think I'm ruined for life."  
</p><p> "Don't she never do it?" asked Mrs. Radford.  
</p><p> "She'd as leave think of flying."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="354"/>   
  
<p>"Ah, I always spoilt my lot! That's why they've turned out such  
bad uns," said the elderly woman.  
</p><p>"You'd only Clara," he said.  "And Mr. Radford's in heaven.  So  
I suppose there's only you left to be the bad un."  
</p><p>"I'm not bad; I'm only soft," she said, as she went out of the  
bedroom.  "I'm only a fool, I am!"  
</p><p>Clara was very quiet at breakfast, but she had a sort of air of  
proprietorship over him that pleased him infinitely.  Mrs. Radford  
was evidently fond of him.  He began to talk of his painting.  
</p><p>"What's the good," exclaimed the mother, "of your whittling  
and worrying and twistin' and too &mdash; in' at that painting of yours?  
What good does it do you, I should like to know? You'd better be  
enjoyin' yourself."  
</p><p>"Oh, but," exclaimed Paul, "I made over thirty guineas last  
year."  
</p><p>"Did you! Well, that's a consideration, but it's nothing to the  
time you put in."  
</p><p>"And I've got four pounds owing.  A man said he'd give me  
five pounds if I'd paint him and his missis and the dog and the  
cottage.  And I went and put the fowls in instead of the dog, and  
he was waxy, so I had to knock a quid off.  I was sick of it, and I  
didn't like the dog.  I made a picture of it.  What shall I do when  
he pays me the four pounds?"  
</p><p>"Nay! you know your own uses for your money," said Mrs.  
Radford.  
</p><p>"But I'm going to bust this four pounds.  Should we go to the  
seaside for a day or two?"  
</p><p> "Who?"  
</p><p> "You and Clara and me."  
</p><p> "What, on your money!" she exclaimed, half-wrathful.  
</p><p> "Why not?"  
</p><p>"You wouldn't be long in breaking your neck at a hurdle race!"  
she said.  
</p><p> "So long as I get a good run for my money! Will you?"  
</p><p> "Nay; you may settle that atween you."  
</p><p> "And you're willing?" he asked, amazed and rejoicing.  
</p><p>"You'll do as you like," said Mrs. Radford, "whether I'm willing  
or not."</p>

<head>"Baxter Dawes"</head>  
 
  
<p>SOON after Paul had been to the theatre with Clara, he was drinking   
in the Punch Bowl with some friends of his when Dawes came  
in. Clara's husband was growing stout; his eyelids were getting  
slack over his brown eyes; he was losing his healthy firmness of  
flesh.  He was very evidently on the downward track. Having  
quarrelled with his sister, he had gone into cheap lodgings.  His  
mistress had left him for a man who would marry her.  He had  
been in prison one night for fighting when he was drunk, and there  
was a shady betting episode in which he was concerned.  
</p><p>Paul and he were confirmed enemies, and yet there was between   
them that peculiar feeling of intimacy, as if they were  
secretly near to each other, which sometimes exists between two  
people, although they never speak to one another.  Paul often  
thought of Baxter Dawes, often wanted to get at him and be friends  
with him.  He knew that Dawes often thought about him, and that  
the man was drawn to him by some bond or other.  And yet the  
two never looked at each other save in hostility.  
</p><p>Since he was a superior employee at Jordan's, it was the thing  
for Paul to offer Dawes a drink.  
</p><p> "What'll you have?" he asked of him.  
</p><p> "Nowt wi' a bleeder like you!" replied the man.  
</p><p>Paul turned away with a slight disdainful movement of the  
shoulders, very irritating.  
</p><p>"The aristocracy," he continued, "is really a military institution.    
Take Germany, now.  She's got thousands of aristocrats whose  
only means of existence is the army.  They're deadly poor, and  
life's deadly slow.  So they hope for a war.  They look for war as  
a chance of getting on.  Till there's a war they are idle good-for-nothings.  When there's a war, they are leaders and commanders.   
There you are, then &mdash; they want war!"  
</p><p>He was not a favourite debater in the public-house, being too  
quick and overbearing.  He irritated the older men by his assertive  
  
  
<pb n="356"/>   
  
manner, and his cocksureness.  They listened in silence, and were  
not sorry when he finished.  
</p><p>Dawes interrupted the young man's flow of eloquence by asking,  
in a loud sneer:  
</p><p> "Did you learn all that at th' theatre th' other night?"  
</p><p>Paul looked at him; their eyes met.  Then he knew Dawes had  
seen him coming out of the theatre with Clara.  
</p><p>"Why, what about th' theatre?" asked one of Paul's associates,  
glad to get a dig at the young fellow, and sniffing something tasty.  
</p><p>"Oh, him in a bob-tailed evening suit, on the lardy-da!" sneered  
Dawes, jerking his head contemptuously at Paul.  
</p><p> "That's comin' it strong," said the mutual friend.  "Tart an' all?"  
</p><p> "Tart, begod!" said Dawes.  
</p><p> "Go on; let's have it!" cried the mutual friend.  
</p><p>"You've got it," said Dawes, "an' I reckon Morelly had it an'  
all."  
</p><p>"Well, I'll be jiggered!" said the mutual friend.  "An' was it a  
proper tart?"  
</p><p> "Tart, God blimey &mdash; yes!"  
</p><p> "How do you know?"  
</p><p> "Oh," said Dawes, "I reckon he spent th' night &mdash; "  
</p><p> There was a good deal of laughter at Paul's expense.  
</p><p> "But who was she? D'you know her?" asked the mutual friend.  
</p><p> "I should shay sho," said Dawes.  
</p><p> This brought another burst of laughter.  
</p><p> "Then spit it out," said the mutual friend.  
</p><p> Dawes shook his head, and took a gulp of beer.  
</p><p>"It's a wonder he hasn't let on himself," he said.  "He'll be   
braggin' of it in a bit."  
</p><p>"Come on, Paul," said the friend; "it's no good.  You might just  
as well own up."  
</p><p>"Own up what? That I happened to take a friend to the theatre?"  
</p><p>"Oh well, if it was all right, tell us who she was, lad," said the  
friend.  
</p><p> "She was all right," said Dawes.  
</p><p>Paul was furious.  Dawes wiped his golden moustache with his  
fingers, sneering.  
</p><p>"Strike me &mdash; ! One o' that sort?" said the mutual friend.  "Paul,  
boy, I'm surprised at you.  And do you know her, Baxter?"  
</p><p> "Just a bit, like!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="357"/>   
<p> He winked at the other men.  
</p><p> "Oh well," said Paul, "I'll be going!"  
</p><p> The mutual friend laid a detaining hand on his shoulder.  
</p><p>"Nay," he said, "you don't get off as easy as that, my lad.  We've  
got to have a full account of this business."  
</p><p> "Then get it from Dawes!" he said.  
</p><p>"You shouldn't funk your own deeds, man," remonstrated the  
friend.  
</p><p>Then Dawes made a remark which caused Paul to throw half  
a glass of beer in his face.  
</p><p>"Oh, Mr. Morel!" cried the barmaid, and she rang the bell for  
the "chucker-out".  
</p><p>Dawes spat and rushed for the young man.  At that minute a  
brawny fellow with his shirt-sleeves rolled up and his trousers  
tight over his haunches intervened.  
</p><p> "Now, then!" he said, pushing his chest in front of Dawes.  
</p><p> "Come out!" cried Dawes.  
</p><p>Paul was leaning, white and quivering, against the brass rail  
of the bar.  He hated Dawes, wished something could exterminate  
him at that minute; and at the same time, seeing the wet hair on  
the man's forehead, he thought he looked pathetic.  He did not  
move.  
</p><p> "Come out, you  &mdash; ," said Dawes.  
</p><p> "That's enough, Dawes," cried the barmaid.  
</p><p>"Come on," said the "chucker-out", with kindly insistence,  
"you'd better be getting on."  
</p><p>And, by making Dawes edge away from his own close proximity,  
he worked him to the door.  
</p><p>"That's the little sod as started it!" cried Dawes, half-cowed,  
pointing to Paul Morel.  
</p><p>"Why, what a story, Mr. Dawes!" said the barmaid.  "You know  
it was you all the time."  
</p><p>Still the "chucker-out" kept thrusting his chest forward at him,  
still he kept edging back, until he was in the doorway and on the  
steps outside; then he turned round.  
</p><p> "All right," he said, nodding straight at his rival.  
</p><p> Paul had a curious sensation of pity, almost of affection, mingled  
with violent hate, for the man.  The coloured door swung to; there  
was silence in the bar.  
</p><p> "Serve, him, jolly well right!" said the barmaid.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="358"/>   
  
<p>"But it's a nasty thing to get a glass of beer in your eyes," said  
the mutual friend.  
</p><p>"I tell you I was glad he did," said the barmaid.  "Will you have  
another, Mr. Morel?"  
</p><p> She held up Paul's glass questioningly.  He nodded.  
</p><p>"He's a man as doesn't care for anything, is Baxter Dawes,"  
said one.  
</p><p>"Pooh! is he?" said the barmaid.  "He's a loud-mouthed one,  
he is, and they're never much good.  Give me a pleasant-spoken  
chap, if you want a devil!"  
</p><p>"Well, Paul, my lad," said the friend, "you'll have to take care  
of yourself now for a while."  
</p><p>"You won't have to give him a chance over you, that's all,"  
said the barmaid.  
</p><p> "Can you box?" asked a friend.  
</p><p> "Not a bit," he answered, still very white.  
</p><p> "I might give you a turn or two," said the friend.  
</p><p> "Thanks, I haven't time."  
</p><p> And presently he took his departure.  
</p><p>"Go along with him, Mr. Jenkinson," whispered the barmaid,  
tipping Mr. Jenkinson the wink.  
</p><p>The man nodded, took his hat, said: "Good-night all!" very  
heartily, and followed Paul, calling:  
</p><p>"Half a minute, old man.  You an' me's going the same road,  
I believe."  
</p><p>"Mr.  Morel doesn't like it," said the barmaid.  "You'll see, we  
shan't have him in much more.  I'm sorry; he's good company.   
And Baxter Dawes wants locking up, that's what he wants."  
</p><p>Paul would have died rather than his mother should get to know  
of this affair.  He suffered tortures of humiliation and self-consciousness.  There was now a good deal of his life of which  
necessarily he could not speak to his mother.  He had a life apart  
from her &mdash; his sexual life.  The rest she still kept.  But he felt he had  
to conceal something from her, and it irked him.  There was a  
certain silence between them, and he felt he had, in that silence,  
to defend himself against her; he felt condemned by her.  Then  
sometimes he hated her, and pulled at her bondage.  His life wanted  
to free itself of her.  It was like a circle where life turned back on  
itself, and got no farther.  She bore him, loved him, kept him, and  
  
  
<pb n="359"/>   
his love turned back into her, so that he could not be free to go  
forward with his own life, really love another woman.  At this  
period, unknowingly, he resisted his mother's influence.  He did  
not tell her things; there was a distance between them.  
</p><p>Clara was happy, almost sure of him.  She felt she had at last  
got him for herself; and then again came the uncertainty.  He told  
her jestingly of the affair with her husband.  Her colour came up,  
her grey eyes flashed.  
</p><p>"That's him to a 'T'," she cried &mdash; "like a navvy! He's not fit for  
mixing with decent folk."  
</p><p> "Yet you married him," he said.  
</p><p> It made her furious that he reminded her.  
</p><p> "I did!" she cried.  "But how was I to know?"  
</p><p> "I think he might have been rather nice," he said.  
</p><p> "You think I made him what he is!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p>"Oh no! he made himself.  But there's something about him &mdash; "  
</p><p>Clara looked at her lover closely.  There was something in him  
she hated, a sort of detached criticism of herself, a coldness which  
made her woman's soul harden against him.  
</p><p> "And what are you going to do?" she asked.  
</p><p> "How?"  
</p><p> "About Baxter."  
</p><p> "There's nothing to do, is there?" he replied.  
</p><p> "You can fight him if you have to, I suppose?" she said.  
</p><p>"No; I haven't the least sense of the 'fist'. It's funny.  With  
most men there's the instinct to clench the fist and hit.  It's not so  
with me.  I should want a knife or a pistol or something to fight  
with."  
</p><p> "Then you'd better carry something," she said.  
</p><p> "Nay," he laughed; "I'm not daggeroso."  
</p><p> "But he'll do something to you.  You don't know him."  
</p><p> "All right," he said, "we'll see."  
</p><p> "And you'll let him?"  
</p><p> "Perhaps, if I can't help it."  
</p><p> "And if he kills you?" she said.  
</p><p> "I should be sorry, for his sake and mine."  
</p><p> Clara was silent for a moment.  
</p><p> "You do make me angry!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p> "That's nothing afresh," he laughed.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="360"/>   
  
<p> "But why are you so silly? You don't know him."  
</p><p> "And don't want."  
</p><p> "Yes, but you're not going to let a man do as he likes with you?"  
</p><p> "What must I do?" he replied, laughing.  
</p><p> "I should carry a revolver," she said.  "I'm sure he's dangerous."  
</p><p> "I might blow my fingers off," he said.  
</p><p> "No; but won't you?" she pleaded.  
</p><p> "No."  
</p><p> "Not anything?"  
</p><p> "No."  
</p><p> "And you'll leave him to &mdash; ?"  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p> "You are a fool!"  
</p><p> "Fact!"  
</p><p> She set her teeth with anger.  
</p><p> "I could shake you!" she cried, trembling with passion.  
</p><p> "Why?"  
</p><p> "Let a man like him do as he likes with you."  
</p><p> "You can go back to him if he triumphs," he said.  
</p><p> "Do you want me to hate you?" she asked.  
</p><p> "Well, I only tell you," he said.  
</p><p> "And you say you love me!" she exclaimed, low and indignant.  
</p><p> "Ought I to slay him to please you?" he said.  "But if I did, see  
what a hold he'd have over me."  
</p><p> Do you think I'm a fool!" she exclaimed.  
</p><p> Not at all.  But you don't understand me, my dear."  
</p><p> There was a pause between them.  
</p><p> "But you ought not to expose yourself," she pleaded.  
</p><p> He shrugged his shoulders.  
 </p> 
<l>          "'The man in righteousness arrayed,</l>  
<l>            The pure and blameless liver,</l>  
<l>            Needs not the keen Toledo blade,</l>  
<l>            Nor venom-freighted quiver,'"</l>  
 <p> 
he quoted.  
</p><p> She looked at him searchingly.  
</p><p> "I wish I could understand you," she said.  
</p><p> "There's simply nothing to understand," he laughed.  
  
  
<pb n="361"/>   
  
She bowed her head, brooding.  
</p><p>He did not see Dawes for several days; then one morning as  
he ran upstairs from the Spiral room he almost collided with the  
burly metal-worker.  
</p><p> "What the &mdash; !" cried the smith.  
</p><p> "Sorry!" said Paul, and passed on.  
</p><p> "Sorry!" sneered Dawes.  
</p><p> Paul whistled lightly, "Put Me among the Girls".  
</p><p> "I'll stop your whistle, my jockey!" he said.  
</p><p> The other took no notice.  
</p><p> "You're goin' to answer for that job of the other night."  
</p><p>Paul went to his desk in his corner, and turned over the leaves  
of the ledger.  
</p><p>"Go and tell Fanny I want order 097, quick!" he said to his boy.  
</p><p>Dawes stood in the doorway, tall and threatening, looking at  
the top of the young man's head.  
</p><p>"Six and five's eleven and seven's one-and-six," Paul added  
aloud.  
</p><p> "An' you hear, do you!" said Dawes.  
</p><p>"Five and ninepence!" He wrote a figure.  "What's that?" he  
said.  
</p><p> "I'm going to show you what it is," said the smith.  
</p><p> The other went on adding the figures aloud.  
</p><p> "Yer crawlin' little  &mdash; , yer daresn't face me proper!"  
</p><p>Paul quickly snatched the heavy ruler.  Dawes started.  The young  
man ruled some lines in his ledger.  The elder man was infuriated.  
</p><p>"But wait till I light on you, no matter where it is, I'll settle your  
hash for a bit, yer little swine!"  
</p><p> "All right," said Paul.  
</p><p>At that the smith started heavily from the doorway.  Just  
then  
a whistle piped shrilly.  Paul went to the speaking-tube.  
</p><p>"Yes!" he said, and he listened.  "Er &mdash; yes!" He listened, then  
he laughed.  "I'll come down directly.  I've got a visitor just now."  
</p><p>Dawes knew from his tone that he had been speaking to Clara.  
He stepped forward.  
</p><p>"Yer little devil!" he said.  "I'll visitor you, inside of two   
minutes! Think I'm goin' to have you whipperty-snappin' round?"  
</p><p>The other clerks in the warehouse looked up.  Paul's office-boy  
appeared, holding some white article.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="362"/>   
  
<p>"Fanny says you could have had it last night if you'd let her  
know," he said.  
</p><p>"All right," answered Paul, looking at the stocking.  "Get it off."  
Dawes stood frustrated, helpless with rage.  Morel turned round.   
</p><p> "Excuse me a minute," he said to Dawes, and he would have  
run downstairs.  
</p><p>"By God, I'll stop your gallop!" shouted the smith, seizing him  
by the arm.  He turned quickly.  
</p><p> "Hey! Hey!" cried the office-boy, alarmed.  
</p><p>Thomas Jordan started out of his little glass office, and came  
running down the room.  
</p><p>"What's a-matter, what's a-matter?" he said, in his old man's  
sharp voice.  
</p><p>"I'm just goin' ter settle this little &mdash; , that's all," said Dawes  
desperately.  
</p><p> "What do you mean?" snapped Thomas Jordan.  
</p><p> "What I say," said Dawes, but he hung fire.  
</p><p> Morel was leaning against the counter, ashamed, half-grinning.  
</p><p> "What's it all about?" snapped Thomas Jordan.  
</p><p>"Couldn't say," said Paul, shaking his head and shrugging his  
shoulders.  
</p><p>"Couldn't yer, couldn't yer!" cried Dawes, thrusting forward  
his handsome, furious face, and squaring his fist.  
</p><p>"Have you finished?" cried the old man, strutting.  "Get off about  
your business, and don't come here tipsy in the morning."  
</p><p> Dawes turned his big frame slowly upon him.  
</p><p> "Tipsy!" he said.  "Who's tipsy? I'm no more tipsy than you are!"  
</p><p>"We've heard that song before," snapped the old man.  "Now  
you get off, and don't be long about it.  Comin' here with your  
rowdying."  
</p><p>The smith looked down contemptuously on his employer.  His  
hands, large, and grimy, and yet well shaped for his labour, worked  
restlessly.  Paul remembered they were the hands of Clara's husband,   
and a flash of hate went through him.  
</p><p>"Get out before you're turned out!" snapped Thomas Jordan.   
</p><p> "Why, who'll turn me out?" said Dawes, beginning to sneer.   
</p><p> Mr. Jordan started, marched up to the smith, waving him off,  
thrusting his stout little figure at the man, saying:  
</p><p> "Get off my premises &mdash; get off!"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="363"/>   
<p> He seized and twitched Dawes's arm.  
</p><p>"Come off!" said the smith, and with a jerk of the elbow he  
sent the little manufacturer staggering backwards.  
</p><p>Before anyone could help him, Thomas Jordan had collided  
with the flimsy spring-door.  It had given way, and let him crash  
down the half-dozen steps into Fanny's room.  There was a second  
of amazement; then men and girls were running.  Dawes stood a  
moment looking bitterly on the scene, then he took his departure.  
</p><p>Thomas Jordan was shaken and braised, not otherwise hurt.   
He was, however, beside himself with rage.  He dismissed Dawes  
from his employment, and summoned him for assault.  
</p><p>At the trial Paul Morel had to give evidence.  Asked how the  
trouble began, he said:  
</p><p>"Dawes took occasion to insult Mrs. Dawes and me because  
I accompanied her to the theatre one evening; then I threw some  
beer at him, and he wanted his revenge."  
</p><p> "Cherchez la femme!" smiled the magistrate.  
</p><p>The case was dismissed after the magistrate had told Dawes  
he thought him a skunk.  
</p><p> "You gave the case away," snapped Mr. Jordan to Paul.  
</p><p>"I don't think I did," replied the latter.  "Besides, you didn't  
really want a conviction, did you?"  
</p><p> "What do you think I took the case up for?"  
</p><p>"Well," said Paul, "I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing." Clara  
was also very angry.  
</p><p>"Why need my name have been dragged in?" she said.   
</p><p> "Better speak it openly than leave it to be whispered."  
</p><p> "There was no need for anything at all," she declared.   
</p><p> "We are none the poorer," he said indifferently.  
</p><p> "You may not be," she said.  
</p><p> "And you?" he asked.  
</p><p> "I need never have been mentioned."  
</p><p> "I'm sorry," he said; but he did not sound sorry.  
</p><p> He told himself easily: "She will come round." And she did.  
</p><p>He told his mother about the fall of Mr. Jordan and the trial  
of Dawes.  Mrs. Morel watched him closely.  
</p><p> "And what do you think of it all?" she asked him.  
</p><p> "I think he's a fool," he said.  
</p><p> But he was very uncomfortable, nevertheless.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="364"/>   
  
<p> "Have you ever considered where it will end?" his mother said.   
</p><p> "No," he answered; "things work out of themselves."  
</p><p> "They do, in a way one doesn't like, as a rule," said his mother.   
</p><p> "And then one has to put up with them," he said.   
</p><p> "You'll find you're not as good at 'putting up' as you imagine,"  
she said.  
</p><p> He went on working rapidly at his design.  
</p><p>"Do you ever ask her opinion?" she said at length.   
</p><p> "What of?"  
</p><p> "Of you, and the whole thing."  
</p><p>"I don't care what her opinion of me is.  She's fearfully in love  
with me, but it's not very deep."  
</p><p> "But quite as deep as your feeling for her."  
</p><p>He looked up at his mother curiously.  
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  "You know, mother, I think there must be  
something the matter with me, that I can't love.  When she's there,  
as a rule, I do love her.  Sometimes, when I see her just as the  
woman, I love her, mother; but then, when she talks and criticises,  
I often don't listen to her."  
</p><p> "Yet she's as much sense as Miriam."  
</p><p>"Perhaps; and I love her better than Miriam.  But why don't  
they hold me?"  
</p><p>The last question was almost a lamentation.  His mother tumed  
away her face, sat looking across the room, very quiet, grave, with  
something of renunciation.  
</p><p>"But you wouldn't want to marry Clara?" she said.  
</p><p>"No; at first perhaps I would.  But why &mdash; why don't I want to  
marry her or anybody? I feel sometimes as if I wronged my  
women, mother."  
</p><p> "How wronged them, my son?"  
</p><p> "I don't know."  
</p><p>He went on painting rather despairingly; he had touched the  
quick of the trouble.  
</p><p>"And as for wanting to marry," said his mother, "there's plenty  
of time yet."  
</p><p>"But no, mother.  I even love Clara, and I did Miriam; but to  
give myself to them in marriage I couldn't.  I couldn't belong to  
them.  They seem to want me, and I can't ever give it them."  
</p><p> "You haven't met the right woman."</p>  
  
<pb n="365"/>   
  
<p>"And I never shall meet the right woman while you live," he  
said.  
</p><p>She was very quiet.  Now she began to feel again tired, as if she  
were done.  
</p><p> "We'll see, my son," she answered.  
</p><p> The feeling that things were going in a circle made him mad.  
</p><p>Clara was, indeed, passionately in love with him, and he with  
her, as far as passion went.  In the daytime he forgot her a good  
deal.  She was working in the same building, but he was not aware  
of it.  He was busy, and her existence was of no matter to him.   
But all the time she was in her Spiral room she had a sense that  
he was upstairs, a physical sense of his person in the same building.    
Every second she expected him to come through the door,  
and when he came it was a shock to her.  But he was often short  
and offhand with her.  He gave her his directions in an official manner,   
keeping her at bay.  With what wits she had left she listened  
to him.  She dared not misunderstand or fail to remember, but it  
was a cruelty to her.  She wanted to touch his chest.  She knew  
exactly how his breast was shapen under the waistcoat, and she  
wanted to touch it.  It maddened her to hear his mechanical voice  
giving orders about the work.  She wanted to break through the  
sham of it, smash the trivial coating of business which covered  
him with hardness, get at the man again; but she was afraid, and  
before she could feel one touch of his warmth he was gone, and  
she ached again.  
</p><p>He knew that she was dreary every evening she did not see  
him, so he gave her a good deal of his time.  The days were often  
a misery to her, but the evenings and the nights were usually a  
bliss to them both.  Then they were silent.  For hours they sat  
together, or walked together in the dark, and talked only a few,  
almost meaningless words.  But he had her hand in his, and her  
bosom left its warmth in his chest, making him feel whole.  
</p><p>One evening they were walking down by the canal, and something   
was troubling him.  She knew she had not got him.  All the  
time he whistled softly and persistently to himself.  She listened,  
feeling she could learn more from his whistling than from his  
speech.  It was a sad dissatisfied tune &mdash; a tune that made her feel  
he would not stay with her.  She walked on in silence.  When they  
came to the swing bridge he sat down on the great pole, looking  
  
  
<pb n="366"/>   
  
at the stars in the water.  He was a long way from her.  She had  
been thinking.  
</p><p> "Will you always stay at Jordan's?" she asked.  
</p><p>"No," he answered without reflecting.  "No; I s'll leave Nottingham   
and go abroad &mdash; soon."  
</p><p> "Go abroad! What for?"  
</p><p> "I dunno! I feel restless."  
</p><p> "But what shall you do?"  
</p><p>"I shall have to get some steady designing work, and some sort  
of sale for my pictures first," he said.  "I am gradually making my  
way.  I know I am."  
</p><p> "And when do you think you'll go?"  
</p><p>"I don't know.  I shall hardly go for long, while there's my  
mother."  
</p><p> "You couldn't leave her?"  
</p><p> "Not for long."  
</p><p>She looked at the stars in the black water.  They lay very white  
and staring.  It was an agony to know be would leave her, but it  
was almost an agony to have him near her.  
</p><p>"And if you made a nice lot of money, what would you do?"  
she asked.  
</p><p> "Go somewhere in a pretty house near London with my mother."  
</p><p> "I see."  
</p><p> There was a long pause.  
</p><p>"I could still come and see you," he said.  "I don't know.  Don't  
ask me what I should do; I don't know."  
</p><p>There was a silence.  The stars shuddered and broke upon the  
water.  There came a breath of wind.  He went suddenly to her,  
and put his hand on her shoulder.  
</p><p>"Don't ask me anything about the future," he said miserably.   
"I don't know anything.  Be with me now, will you, no matter what  
it is?"  
</p><p>And she took him in her arms.  After all, she was a married  
woman, and she had no right even to what he gave her.  He needed  
her badly.  She had him in her arms, and he was miserable.  With  
her warmth she folded him over, consoled him, loved him.  She  
would let the moment stand for itself.  
</p><p> After a moment he lifted his head as if he wanted to speak.  
</p><p> "Clara," he said, struggling.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="367"/>   
  
<p>She caught him passionately to her, pressed his head down on  
her breast with her hand.  She could not bear the suffering in his  
voice.  She was afraid in her soul.  He might have anything of her  
-anything; but she did not want to know.  She felt she could not  
bear it.  She wanted him to be soothed upon her &mdash; soothed. She  
stood clasping him and caressing him, and he was something unknown   
to her &mdash; something almost uncanny.  She wanted to soothe  
him into forgetfulness.  
</p><p>And soon the struggle went down in his soul, and he forgot.   
But then Clara was not there for him, only a woman, warm, something   
he loved and almost worshipped, there in the dark.  But it was  
not Clara, and she submitted to him.  The naked hunger and inevitability   
of his loving her, something strong and blind and ruthless in its   
primitiveness, made the hour almost terrible to her.   
She knew how stark and alone he was, and she felt it was great  
that he came to her; and she took him simply because his need  
was bigger either than her or him, and her soul was still within  
her.  She did this for him in his need, even if he left her, for she  
loved him.  
</p><p>All the while the peewits were screaming in the field.  When  
he came to, he wondered what was near his eyes, curving and  
strong with life in the dark, and what voice it was speaking.  Then  
he realised it was the grass, and the peewit was calling.  The warmth  
was Clara's breathing heaving.  He lifted his head, and looked into  
her eyes.  They were dark and shining and strange, life wild at  
the source staring into his life, stranger to him, yet meeting him;  
and he put his face down on her throat, afraid.  What was she?  
A strong, strange, wild life, that breathed with his in the darkness  
through this hour.  It was all so much bigger than themselves that  
he was hushed.  They had met, and included in their meeting the  
thrust of the manifold grass stems, the cry of the peewit, the wheel  
of the stars.  
</p><p>When they stood up they saw other lovers stealing down the  
opposite hedge.  It seemed natural they were there; the night contained   
them.  
</p><p>And after such an evening they both were very still, having  
known the immensity of passion.  They felt small, half-afraid,  
childish and wondering, like Adam and Eve when they lost their  
innocence and realised the magnificence of the power which drove  
  
  
<pb n="368"/>   
  
them out of Paradise and across the great night and the great day  
of humanity.  It was for each of them an initiation and a satisfaction.    
To know their own nothingness, to know the tremendous  
living flood which carried them always, gave them rest within  
themselves.  If so great a magnificent power could overwhelm  
them, identify them altogether with itself, so that they knew they  
were only grains in the tremendous heave that lifted every grass  
blade its little height, and every tree, and living thing, then why  
fret about themselves? They could let themselves be carried by  
life, and they felt a sort of peace each in the other.  There was a  
verification which they had had together.  Nothing could nullify  
it, nothing could take it away; it was almost their belief in life.  
</p><p>But Clara was not satisfied.  Something great was there, she  
knew; something great enveloped her.  But it did not keep her.   
In the morning it was not the same.  They had known, but she  
could not keep the moment.  She wanted it again; she wanted something   
permanent.  She had not realised fully.  She thought it was he  
whom she wanted.  He was not safe to her.  This that had been  
between them might never be again; he might leave her.  She had  
not got him; she was not satisfied.  She had been there, but she  
had not gripped the &mdash; the something &mdash; she knew not what &mdash; which  
she was mad to have.  
</p><p>In the morning he had considerable peace, and was happy in  
himself.  It seemed almost as if he had known the baptism of fire  
in passion, and it left him at rest.  But it was not Clara.  It was   
something that happened because of her, but it was not her.  They were  
scarcely any nearer each other.  It was as if they had been blind  
agents of a great force.  
</p><p>When she saw him that day at the factory her heart melted like  
a drop of fire.  It was his body, his brows.  The drop of fire grew  
more intense in her breast; she must hold him.  But he, very quiet,  
very subdued this morning, went on giving his instruction.  She  
followed him into the dark, ugly basement, and lifted her arms  
to him.  He kissed her, and the intensity of passion began to burn  
him again.  Somebody was at the door.  He ran upstairs; she returned  
to her room, moving as if in a trance.  
</p><p>After that the fire slowly went down.  He felt more and more  
that his experience had been impersonal, and not Clara.  He loved  
her.  There was a big tenderness, as after a strong emotion they  
  
  
<pb n="369"/>   
  
had known together; but it was not she who could keep his soul  
steady.  He had wanted her to be something she could not be.  
</p><p>And she was mad with desire of him.  She could not see him  
without touching him.  In the factory, as he talked to her about  
Spiral hose, she ran her hand secretly along his side.  She followed  
him out into the basement for a quick kiss; her eyes, always mute  
and yearning, full of unrestrained passion, she kept fixed on his.   
He was afraid of her, lest she should too flagrantly give herself  
away before the other girls.  She invariably waited for him at  
dinner-time for him to embrace her before she went.  He felt as if  
she were helpless, almost a burden to him, and it irritated him.  
</p><p>"But what do you always want to be kissing and embracing  
for?" he said.  "Surely there's a time for everything."  
</p><p> She looked up at him, and the hate came into her eyes.  
</p><p> "Do I always want to be kissing you?" she said.  
</p><p>"Always, even if I come to ask you about the work.  I don't want  
anything to do with love when I'm at work.  Work's work &mdash; "  
</p><p> "And what is love?" she asked.  "Has it to have special hours?"  
</p><p> "Yes; out of work hours."  
</p><p> "And you'll regulate it according to Mr. Jordan's closing time?"  
</p><p> "Yes; and according to the freedom from business of any sort."  
</p><p> "It is only to exist in spare time?"  
</p><p> "That's all, and not always then &mdash; not the kissing sort of love."  
</p><p> "And that's all you think of it?"  
</p><p> "It's quite enough."  
</p><p> "I'm glad you think so."  
</p><p>And she was cold to him for some time &mdash; she hated him;  
and while she was cold and contemptuous, he was uneasy till she  
had forgiven him again.  But when they started afresh they were not  
any nearer.  He kept her because he never satisfied her.  
</p><p>In the spring they went together to the seaside.  They had rooms  
at a little cottage near Theddlethorpe, and lived as man and wife.   
Mrs. Radford sometimes went with them.  
</p><p>It was known in Nottingham that Paul Morel and Mrs. Dawes  
were going together, but as nothing was very obvious, and Clara  
always a solitary person, and he seemed so simple and innocent,  
it did not make much difference.  
</p><p>He loved the Lincolnshire coast, and she loved the sea.  In the  
early morning they often went out together to bathe.  The grey  
  
  
<pb n="370"/>   
  
of the dawn, the far, desolate reaches of the fenland smitten with  
winter, the sea-meadows rank with herbage, were stark enough  
to rejoice his soul.  As they stepped on to the highroad from their  
plank bridge, and looked round at the endless monotony of levels,  
the land a little darker than the sky, the sea sounding small beyond   
the sandhills, his heart fined strong with the sweeping relentlessness   
of life.  She loved him then.  He was solitary and  
strong, and his eyes had a beautiful light.  
</p><p>They shuddered with cold; then he raced her down the road  
to the green turf bridge.  She could run well.  Her colour soon came,  
her throat was bare, her eyes shone.  He loved her for being so  
luxuriously heavy, and yet so quick.  Himself was light; she went  
with a beautiful rush.  They grew warm, and walked hand in hand.  
</p><p>A flush came into the sky, the wan moon, half-way down the  
west, sank into insignificance.  On the shadowy land things began  
to take life, plants with great leaves became distinct. They came  
through a pass in the big, cold sandhills on to the beach.  The long  
waste of foreshore lay moaning under the dawn and the sea; the  
ocean was a flat dark strip with a white edge.  Over the gloomy sea  
the sky grew red.  Quickly the fire spread among the clouds and  
scattered them.  Crimson burned to orange, orange to dull gold,  
and in a golden glitter the sun came up, dribbling fierily over the  
waves in little splashes, as if someone had gone along and the  
light had spilled from her pail as she walked.  
</p><p>The breakers ran down the shore in long, hoarse strokes.  Tiny  
seagulls, like specks of spray, wheeled above the line of surf.  Their  
crying seemed larger than they.  Far away the coast reached out,  
and melted into the morning, the tussocky sandhills seemed to  
sink to a level with the beach.  Mablethorpe was tiny on their  
right.  They had alone the space of all this level shore, the sea, and  
the upcoming sun, the faint noise of the waters, the sharp crying  
of the gulls.  
</p><p>They had a warm hollow in the sandhills where the wind did  
not come.  He stood looking out to sea.  
</p><p>"It's very fine," he said.  
</p><p>"Now don't get sentimental," she said.  
</p><p>It irritated her to see him standing gazing at the sea, like a   
solitary and poetic person.  He laughed.  She quickly undressed.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="371"/>   
<p>"There are some fine waves this morning," she said triumphantly.  
</p><p>She was a better swimmer than he; he stood idly watching her.  
</p><p>"Aren't you coming?" she said.  
</p><p>"In a minute," he answered.  
</p><p>She was white and velvet skinned, with heavy shoulders.  A  
little wind, coming from the sea, blew across her body and ruffled  
her hair.  
</p><p>The morning was of a lovely limpid gold colour.  Veils of shadow  
seemed to be drifting away on the north and the south.  Clara stood  
shrinking slightly from the touch of the wind, twisting her hair.   
The sea-grass rose behind the white stripped woman.  She glanced  
at the sea, then looked at him.  He was watching her with dark  
eyes which she loved and could not understand.  She hugged her  
breasts between her arms, cringing, laughing:  
</p><p>"Oo, it will be so cold!" she said.  
</p><p>He bent forward and kissed her, held her suddenly close, and  
kissed her again.  She stood waiting.  He looked into her eyes, then  
away at the pale sands.  
</p><p>"Go, then!" he said quietly.  
</p><p>She flung her arms round his neck, drew him against her, kissed  
him passionately, and went, saying:  
</p><p>"But you'll come in?"  
</p><p>"In a minute."  
</p><p>She went plodding heavily over the sand that was soft as velvet.  
He, on the sandhills, watched the great pale coast envelop her.  She  
grew smaller, lost proportion, seemed only like a large white bird  
toiling forward.  
</p><p>"Not much more than a big white pebble on the beach, not  
much more than a clot of foam being blown and rolled over the  
sand," he said to himself.  
</p><p>She seemed to move very slowly across the vast sounding shore.   
As he watched, he lost her.  She was dazzled out of sight by the  
sunshine.  Again he saw her, the merest white speck moving against  
the white, muttering sea-edge.  
</p><p>"Look how little she is!" he said to himself.  "She's lost like a  
grain of sand in the beach &mdash; just a concentrated speck blown along,  
a tiny white foam-bubble, almost nothing among the morning.   
Why does she absorb me?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="372"/>   
  
<p>The morning was altogether uninterrupted: she was gone in  
the water.  Far and wide the beach, the sandhills with their blue  
marram, the shining water, glowed together in immense, unbroken  
solitude.  
</p><p>"What is she, after all?" he said to himself.  "Here's the seacoast  
morning, big and permanent and beautiful; there is she, fretting,  
always unsatisfied, and temporary as a bubble of foam.  What  
does she mean to me, after all? She represents something, like a  
bubble of foam represents the sea.  But what is she? It's not her  
I care for."  
</p><p>Then, startled by his own unconscious thoughts, that seemed  
to speak so distinctly that all the morning could hear, he undressed  
and ran quickly down the sands.  She was watching for him.  Her  
arm flashed up to him, she heaved on a wave, subsided, her  
shoulders in a pool of liquid silver.  He jumped through the breakers,   
and in a moment her hand was on his shoulder.  
</p><p>He was a poor swimmer, and could not stay long in the water.   
She played round him in triumph, sporting with her superiority,  
which he begrudged her.  The sunshine stood deep and fine on the  
water.  They laughed in the sea for a minute or two, then raced  
each other back to the sandhills.  
</p><p>When they were drying themselves, panting heavily, he watched  
her laughing, breathless face, her bright shoulders, her breasts  
that swayed and made him frightened as she rubbed them, and  
he thought again:  
</p><p>"But she is magnificent, and even bigger than the morning and  
the sea.  Is she &mdash; ? Is she &mdash; "  
</p><p>She, seeing his dark eyes fixed on her, broke off from her drying   
with a laugh.  
</p><p>"What are you looking at?" she said.  
</p><p>"You," he answered, laughing.  
</p><p>Her eyes met his, and in a moment he was kissing her white  
"goose-fleshed" shoulder, and thinking:  
</p><p>"What is she? What is she?"  
</p><p>She loved him in the morning.  There was something detached,  
hard, and elemental about his kisses then, as if he were only conscious   
of his own will, not in the least of her and her wanting him.  
</p><p>Later in the day he went out sketching.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="373"/>   
<p>You," he said to her, "go with your mother to Sutton.  I am so  
dull."  
</p><p>She stood and looked at him.  He knew she wanted to come with  
him, but he preferred to be alone.  She made him feel imprisoned  
when she was there, as if he could not get a free deep breath, as  
if there were something on top of him.  She felt his desire to be  
free of her.  
</p><p>In  the evening he came back to her.  They walked down the  
shore in the darkness, then sat for a while in the shelter of the  
sandhills.  
</p><p>"It seems," she said, as they stared over the darkness of the sea,  
where no light was to be seen &mdash; "it seemed as if you only loved me  
at night &mdash; as if you didn't love me in the daytime."  
</p><p>He ran the cold sand through his fingers, feeling guilty under  
the accusation.  
</p><p>"The night is free to you," he replied.  "In the daytime I want  
to be by myself."  
</p><p>"But why?" she said.  "Why, even now, when we are on this  
short holiday?"  
</p><p>"I don't know.  Love-making stifles me in the daytime."  
</p><p>"But it needn't be always love-making," she said.  
</p><p>"It always is," he answered, "when you and I are together."  
</p><p>She sat feeling very bitter.  
</p><p>"Do you ever want to marry me?" he asked curiously.  
</p><p>"Do you me?" she replied.  
</p><p>"Yes, yes; I should like us to have children," he answered  
slowly.  
</p><p>She sat with her head bent, fingering the sand.  
</p><p>"But you don't really want a divorce from Baxter, do you?" he  
said.  
</p><p>It was some minutes before she replied.  
</p><p>"No," she said, very deliberately; "I don't think I do."  
</p><p>"Why?"  
</p><p>"I don't know."  
</p><p>"Do you feel as if you belonged to him?"  
</p><p>"No; I don't think so."  
</p><p>"What, then?"  
</p><p>"I think he belongs to me," she replied.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="374"/>   
  
<p>He was silent for some minutes, listening to the wind blowing  
over the hoarse, dark sea.  
</p><p>"And you never really intended to belong to me?" he said.  
</p><p>"Yes, I do belong to you," she answered.  
</p><p>"No," he said; "because you don't want to be divorced."  
</p><p>It was a knot they could not untie, so they left it, took what they  
could get, and what they could not attain they ignored.  
</p><p>"I consider you treated Baxter rottenly," he said another time.  
</p><p>He half-expected Clara to answer him, as his mother would:  
"You consider your own affairs, and don't know so much about  
other people's." But she took him seriously, almost to his own  
surprise.  
</p><p>"Why?" she said.  
</p><p>"I suppose you thought he was a lily of the valley, and so you  
put him in an appropriate pot, and tended him according.  You  
made up your mind he was a lily of the valley and it was no good  
his being a cow-parsnip.  You wouldn't have it."  
</p><p>"I certainly never imagined him a lily of the valley."  
</p><p>"You imagined him something he wasn't.  That's just what a  
woman is.  She thinks she knows what's good for a man, and she's  
going to see he gets it; and no matter if he's starving, he may sit  
and whistle for what he needs, while she's got him, and is giving  
him what's good for him."  
</p><p>"And what are you doing?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I'm thinking what tune I shall whistle," he laughed.   
</p><p>And instead of boxing his ears, she considered him in earnest.   
</p><p>"You think I want to give you what's good for you?" she asked.   
</p><p>"I hope so; but love should give a sense of freedom, not of  
prison.  Miriam made me feel tied up like a donkey to a stake.  I  
must feed on her patch, and nowhere else.  It's sickening!"  
</p><p>"And would you let a woman do as she likes?"  
</p><p>"Yes; I'll see that she likes to love me.  If she doesn't-well,  
I don't hold her."  
</p><p>"If you were as wonderful as you say &mdash; ," replied Clara.  
</p><p>"I should be the marvel I am," he laughed.  
</p><p>There was a silence in which they hated each other, though  
they laughed.  
</p><p>"Love's a dog in a manger," he said.  
</p><p>"And which of us is the dog?" she asked.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="375"/>   
<p>"Oh well, you, of course."  
</p><p>So there went on a battle between them.  She knew she never  
fully had him.  Some part, big and vital in him, she had no  
hold over; nor did she ever try to get it, or even to realise what it  
was.  And he knew in some way that she held herself still as Mrs.  
Dawes.  She did not love Dawes, never had loved him; but she believed   
he loved her, at least depended on her.  She felt a certain  
surety about him that she never felt with Paul Morel.  Her passion  
for the young man had filled her soul, given her a certain satisfaction,   
eased her of her self-mistrust, her doubt.  Whatever else she  
was, she was inwardly assured.  It was almost as if she had gained  
herself, and stood now distinct and complete.  She had received  
her confirmation; but she never believed that her life belonged  
to Paul Morel, nor his to her.  They would separate in the end, and  
the rest of her life would be an ache after him.  But at any rate, she  
knew now, she was sure of herself.  And the same could almost be  
said of him.  Together they had received the baptism of life, each  
through the other; but now their missions were separate.  Where  
he wanted to go she could not come with him.  They would have  
to part sooner or later.  Even if they married, and were faithful to  
each other, still he would have to leave her, go on alone, and she  
would only have to attend to him when he came home.  But it was  
not possible.  Each wanted a mate to go side by side with.  
</p><p>Clara had gone to live with her mother upon Mapperley Plains.   
One evening, as Paul and she were walking along Woodborough  
Road, they met Dawes.  Morel knew something about the bearing  
of the man approaching, but he was absorbed in his thinking at  
the moment, so that only his artist's eye watched the form of the  
stranger.  Then he suddenly turned to Clara with a laugh, and put  
his hand on her shoulder, saying, laughing:  
</p><p>"But we walk side by side, and yet I'm in London arguing with  
an imaginary Orpen; and where are you?"  
</p><p>At that instant Dawes passed, almost touching Morel.  The  
young man glanced, saw the dark brown eyes burning, full of hate  
and yet tired.  
</p><p>"Who was that?" he asked of Clara.  
</p><p>"It was Baxter," she replied.  
</p><p>Paul took his hand from her shoulder and glanced round; then  
he saw again distinctly the man's form as it approached him.  Dawes  
  
  
<pb n="376"/>   
  
still walked erect, with his fine shoulders flung back, and his face  
lifted; but there was a furtive look in his eyes that gave one the  
impression he was trying to get unnoticed past every person he  
met, glancing suspiciously to see what they thought of him.  And  
his hands seemed to be wanting to hide.  He wore old clothes,  
the trousers were tom at the knee, and the handkerchief tied round  
his throat was dirty; but his cap was still defiantly over one eye.   
As she saw him, Clara felt guilty.  There was a tiredness and despair   
on his face that made her hate him, because it hurt her.  
</p><p>"He looks shady," said Paul.  
</p><p>But the note of pity in his voice reproached her, and made her  
feel hard.  
</p><p>"His true commonness comes out," she answered.  
</p><p>"Do you hate him?" he asked.  
</p><p>"You talk," she said, "about the cruelty of women; I wish you  
knew the cruelty of men in their brute force.  They simply don't  
know that the woman exists."  
</p><p>"Don't I?" he said.  
</p><p>"No," she answered.  
</p><p>"Don't I know you exist?"  
</p><p>"About me you know nothing," she said bitterly &mdash; "about me!"  
</p><p>"No more than Baxter knew?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Perhaps not as much."  
</p><p>He felt puzzled, and helpless, and angry.  There she walked unknown   
to him, though they had been through such experience together.  
</p><p>"But you know me pretty well," he said.  
</p><p>She did not answer.  
</p><p>"Did you know Baxter as well as you know me?" he asked.  
</p><p>"He wouldn't let me," she said.  
</p><p>"And I have let you know me?"  
</p><p>"It's what men won't let you do.  They won't let you get really  
near to them," she said.  
</p><p>"And haven't I let you?"  
</p><p>"Yes," she answered slowly; "but you've never come near to  
me. You can't come out of yourself, you can't.  Baxter could do  
that better than you."  
</p><p>He walked on pondering.  He was angry with her for prefering  
Baxter to him.</p>  
  
<pb n="377"/>   
  
<p>"You begin to value Baxter now you've not got him," he said.  
</p><p>"No; I can only see where he was different from you."  
</p><p>But he felt she had a grudge against him.  
</p><p>One evening, as they were coming home over the fields, she  
startled him by asking:  
</p><p>"Do you think it's worth it &mdash; the &mdash; the sex part?"  
</p><p>"The act of loving, itself?"  
</p><p>"Yes; is it worth anything to you?"  
</p><p>"But how can you separate it?" he said.  "It's the culmination of  
everything.  All our intimacy culminates then."  
</p><p>"Not for me," she said.  
</p><p>He was silent.  A flash of hate for her came up.  After all, she  
was dissatisfied with him, even there, where he thought they fulfilled   
each other.  But he believed her too implicitly.  
</p><p>"I feel," she continued slowly, "as if I hadn't got you, as if all  
of you weren't there, and as if it weren't me you were taking &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Who, then?"  
</p><p>"Something just for yourself.  It has been fine, so that I daren't  
think of it.  But is it me you want, or is it It?"  
</p><p>He again felt guilty.  Did he leave Clara out of count, and take  
simply women? But he thought that was splitting a hair.  
</p><p>"When I had Baxter, actually had him, then I did feel as if I  
had all of him," she said.  
</p><p>"And it was better?" he asked.  
</p><p>"Yes, yes; it was more whole.  I don't say you haven't given me  
more than he ever gave me."  
</p><p>"Or could give you."  
</p><p>"Yes, perhaps; but you've never given me yourself."  
</p><p>He knitted his brows angrily.  
</p><p>"If I start to make love to you," he said, "I just go like a leaf  
down the wind."  
</p><p>"And leave me out of count," she said.  
</p><p>"And then is it nothing to you?" he asked, almost rigid with  
chagrin.  
</p><p>"It's something; and sometimes you have carried me away &mdash;  
right away &mdash; I know &mdash; and &mdash; I reverence you for it &mdash; but &mdash; "  
</p><p>"Don't 'but' me," he said, kissing her quickly, as a fire ran  
through him.  
</p><p>She submitted, and was silent.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="378"/>   
  
<p>It was true as he said.  As a rule, when he started love-making,  
the emotion was strong enough to carry with it everything &mdash; reason,  
soul, blood &mdash; in a great sweep, like the Trent carries bodily its back-swirls and intertwinings, noiselessly.  Gradually the little criticisms,  
the little sensations, were lost, thought also went, everything borne  
along in one flood.  He became, not a man with a mind, but a great  
instinct.  His hands were like creatures, living; his limbs, his body,  
were all life and consciousness, subject to no will of his, but living  
in themselves.  Just as he was, so it seemed the vigorous, wintry  
stars were strong also with life.  He and they struck with the same  
pulse of fire, and the same joy of strength which held the bracken-frond stiff near his eyes held his own body firm.  It was as if he, and  
the stars, and the dark herbage, and Clara were licked up in an immense   
tongue of flame, which tore onwards and upwards.  Everything rushed   
along in living beside him; everything was still,  
perfect in itself, along with him.  This wonderful stillness in each  
thing in itself, while it was being borne along in a very ecstasy of  
living, seemed the highest point of bliss.  
</p><p>And Clara knew this held him to her, so she trusted altogether  
to the passion.  It, however, failed her very often.  They did not  
often reach again the height of that once when the peewits had  
called.  Gradually, some mechanical effort spoilt their loving, or,  
when they had splendid moments, they had them separately, and  
not so satisfactorily.  So often he seemed merely to be running on  
alone; often they realised it had been a failure, not what they had  
wanted.  He left her, knowing that evening had only made a little  
split between them.  Their loving grew more mechanical, without  
the marvellous glamour.  Gradually they began to introduce novelties,   
to get back some of the feeling of satisfaction.  They would  
be very near, almost dangerously near to the river, so that the  
black water ran not far from his face, and it gave a little thrill; or  
they loved sometimes in a little hollow below the fence of the path  
where people were passing occasionally, on the edge of the town,  
and they heard footsteps coming, almost felt the vibration of the  
tread, and they heard what the passersby said &mdash; strange little things  
that were never intended to be heard.  And afterwards each of them  
was rather ashamed, and these things caused a distance between  
the two of them.  He began to despise her a little, as if she had merited   
it!</p>  
  
  
<pb n="379"/>   
  
<p>One night he left her to go to Daybrook Station over the fields.   
It was very dark, with an attempt at snow, although the spring was  
so far advanced.  Morel had not much time; he plunged forward.  
  
The town ceases almost abruptly on the edge of a steep hollow;  
there the houses with their yellow lights stand up against the darkness.    
He went over the stile, and dropped quickly into the hollow  
of the fields.  Under the orchard one warm window shone in  
Swineshead Farm.  Paul glanced round.  Behind, the houses stood  
on the brim of the dip, black against the sky, like wild beasts glaring   
curiously with yellow eyes down into the darkness.  It was the  
town that seemed savage and uncouth, glaring on the clouds at  
the back of him.  Some creature stirred under the willows of the  
farm pond.  It was too dark to distinguish anything.  
</p><p>He was close up to the next stile before he saw a dark shape  
leaning against it.  The man moved aside.  
</p><p>"Good-evening!" he said.  
</p><p>"Good-evening!" Morel answered, not noticing.  
</p><p>"Paul Morel?" said the man.  
</p><p>Then he knew it was Dawes.  The man stopped his way.  
</p><p>"I've got yer, have I?" he said awkwardly.  
</p><p>"I shall miss my train," said Paul.  
</p><p>He could see nothing of Dawes's face.  The man's teeth seemed  
to chatter as he talked.  
</p><p>"You're going to get it from me now," said Dawes.  
</p><p>Morel attempted to move forward; the other man stepped in  
front of him.  
</p><p>"Are yer goin' to take that top-coat off," he said, "or are you  
goin' to lie down to it?"  
</p><p>Paul was afraid the man was mad.  
</p><p>"But," he said, "I don't know how to fight."  
</p><p>"All right, then," answered Dawes, and before the younger man  
knew where he was, he was staggering backwards from a blow  
across the face.  
</p><p>The whole night went black.  He tore off his overcoat and coat,  
dodging a blow, and flung the garments over Dawes.  The latter  
swore savagely.  Morel, in his shirt-sleeves, was now alert and furious.    
He felt his whole body unsheath itself like a claw.  He could  
not fight, so he would use his wits.  The other man became more  
distinct to him; he could see particularly the shirt-breast.  Dawes  
  
  
<pb n="380"/>   
  
stumbled over Paul's coats, then came rushing forward.  The young  
man's mouth was bleeding.  It was the other man's mouth he was  
dying to get at, and the desire was anguish in its strength.  He  
stepped quickly through the stile, and as Dawes was coming  
through after him, like a flash he got a blow in over the other's  
mouth.  He shivered with pleasure.  Dawes advanced slowly, spitting.    
Paul was afraid; he moved round to get to the stile again.  Suddenly,   
from out of nowhere, came a great blow against his ear,  
that sent him falling helpless backwards.  He heard Dawes's heavy  
panting, like a wild beast's, then came a kick on the knee, giving  
him such agony that he got up and, quite blind, leapt clean under  
his enemy's guard.  He felt blows and kicks, but they did not hurt.   
He hung on to the bigger man like a wild cat, till at last Dawes fell  
with a crash, losing his presence of mind.  Paul went down with  
him.  Pure instinct brought his hands to the man's neck, and before  
Dawes, in frenzy and agony, could wrench him free, he had got  
his fists twisted in the scarf and his knuckles dug in the throat of  
the other man.  He was a pure instinct, without reason or feeling.   
His body, hard and wonderful in itself, cleaved against the struggling   
body of the other man; not a muscle in him relaxed.  He was  
quite unconscious, only his body had taken upon itself to kill this  
other man.  For himself, be had neither feeling nor reason.  He lay  
pressed hard against his adversary, his body adjusting itself to its  
one pure purpose of choking the other man, resisting exactly at  
the right moment, with exactly the right amount of strength, the  
struggles of the other, silent, intent, unchanging, gradually pressing  
its knuckles deeper, feeling the struggles of the other body become  
wilder and more frenzied.  Tighter and tighter grew his body, like  
a screw that is gradually increasing in pressure, till something  
breaks.  
</p><p>Then suddenly he relaxed, full of wonder and misgiving.  Dawes  
had been yielding.  Morel felt his body flame with pain, as he realised   
what he was doing; he was all bewildered.  Dawes's struggles  
suddenly renewed themselves in a furious spasm.  Paul's hands  
were wrenched, torn out of the scarf in which they were knotted,  
and he was flung away, helpless.  He heard the horrid sound of the  
other's gasping, but he lay stunned; then, still dazed, he felt the  
blows of the other's feet, and lost consciousness.  
</p><p>Dawes, grunting with pain like a beast, was kicking the prostrate  
  
  
<pb n="381"/>   
  
body of his rival.  Suddenly the whistle of the train shrieked two  
fields away.  He tumed round and glared suspiciously.  What was  
coming? He saw the lights of the train draw across his vision.  It  
seemed to him people were approaching.  He made off across the  
field into Nottingham, and dimly in his consciousness as he went,  
he felt on his foot the place where his boot had knocked against  
one of the lad's bones.  The knock seemed to re-echo inside him;  
he hurried to get away from it.  
</p><p>Morel gradually came to himself.  He knew where he was and  
what had happened, but he did not want to move.  He lay still, with  
tiny bits of snow tickling his face.  It was pleasant to lie quite, quite  
still.  The time passed.  It was the bits of snow that kept rousing  
him when he did not want to be roused.  At last his will clicked into  
action.  
</p><p>"I mustn't lie here," he said; "it's silly."  
</p><p>But still he did not move.  
</p><p>"I said I was going to get up," he repeated.  "Why don't I?"  
</p><p>And still it was some time before he had sufficiently pulled   
himself together to stir; then gradually he got up.  Pain made him sick  
and dazed, but his brain was clear.  Reeling, he groped for his coats  
and got them on, buttoning his overcoat up to his ears.  It was some  
time before he found his cap.  He did not know whether his face  
was still bleeding.  Walking blindly, every step making him sick  
with pain, he went back to the pond and washed his face and hands.   
The icy water hurt, but helped to bring him back to himself.  He  
crawled back up the hill to the tram.  He wanted to get to his  
mother &mdash; he must get to his mother &mdash; that was his blind intention.   
He covered his face as much as he could, and struggled sickly  
along.  Continually the ground seemed to fall away from him as  
he walked, and he felt himself dropping with a sickening feeling  
into space; so, like a nightmare, he got through with the journey  
home.  
</p><p>Everybody was in bed.  He looked at himself.  His face was   
discoloured and smeared with blood, almost like a dead man's face.   
He washed it, and went to bed.  The night went by in delirium.  In  
the morning he found his mother looking at him.  Her blue eyes &mdash;  
they were all he wanted to see.  She was there; he was in her hands.  
</p><p>"It's not much, mother," he said.  "It was Baxter Dawes."  
</p><p>"Tell me where it hurts you," she said quietly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="382"/>   
  
<p>"I don't know &mdash; my shoulder.  Say it was a bicycle accident,  
mother."  
</p><p>He could not move his arm.  Presently Minnie, the little servant,  
came upstairs with some tea.  
</p><p>"Your mother's nearly frightened me out of my wits &mdash; fainted  
away," she said.  
</p><p>He felt he could not bear it.  His mother nursed him; he told her  
about it.  
</p><p>"And now I should have done with them  all," she said quietly.  
</p><p>"I will, mother."  
</p><p>She covered him up.  
</p><p>"And don't think about it," she said &mdash; "only try to go to  
sleep. The doctor won't be here till eleven."  
</p><p>He had a dislocated shoulder, and the second day acute bronchitis   
set in.  His mother was pale as death now, and very thin.  She  
would sit and look at him, then away into space.  There was something   
between them that neither dared mention.  Clara came to see  
him.  Afterwards he said to his mother:  
</p><p>"She makes me tired, mother."  
</p><p>"Yes; I wish she wouldn't come," Mrs. Morel replied.  
</p><p>Another day Miriam came, but she seemed almost like a  
stranger to him.  
</p><p>"You know, I don't care about them, mother," he said.  
</p><p>"I'm afraid you don't, my son," she replied sadly.  
</p><p>It was given out everywhere that it was a bicycle accident.  Soon  
he was able to go to work again, but now there was a constant sickness   
and gnawing at his heart.  He went to Clara, but there seemed,  
as it were, nobody there.  He could not work.  He and his mother  
seemed almost to avoid each other.  There was some secret between   
them which they could not bear.  He was not aware of it.   
He only knew that his life seemed unbalanced, as if it were going  
to smash into pieces.  
</p><p>Clara did not know what was the matter with him.  She realised  
that he seemed unaware of her.  Even when he came to her he  
seemed unaware of her; always he was somewhere else.  She felt  
she was clutching for him, and he was somewhere else.  It tortured  
her, and so she tortured him.  For a month at a time she kept him  
at arm's length.  He almost hated her, and was driven to her in  
spite of himself.  He went mostly into the company of men, was  
  
  
<pb n="383"/>   
  
always at the George or the White Horse.  His mother was ill,  
distant, quiet, shadowy.  He was terrified of something; he dared  
not look at her.  Her eyes seemed to grow darker, her face more  
waxen; still she dragged about at her work.  
</p><p>At Whitsuntide he said he would go to Blackpool for four days  
with his friend Newton.  The latter was a big, jolly fellow, with a  
touch of the bounder about him.  Paul said his mother must go to  
Sheffield to stay a week with Annie, who lived there.  Perhaps the  
change would do her good.  Mrs. Morel was attending a woman's  
doctor in Nottingham.  He said her heart and her digestion were  
wrong.  She consented to go to Sheffield, though she did not want  
to; but now she would do everything her son wished of her.  Paul  
said he would come for her on the fifth day, and stay also in Sheffield   
till the holiday was up.  It was agreed.  
</p><p>The two young men set off gaily for Blackpool.  Mrs. Morel  
was quite lively as Paul kissed her and left her.  Once at the  
station, he forgot everything.  Four days were clear &mdash; not an anxiety, not a  
thought.  The two young men simply enjoyed themselves.  Paul was  
like another man.  None of himself remained &mdash; no Clara, no Miriam,   
no mother that fretted him.  He wrote to them all, and long  
letters to his mother; but they were jolly letters that made her  
laugh.  He was having a good time, as young fellows will in a place  
like Blackpool.  And underneath it all was a shadow for her.  
</p><p>Paul was very gay, excited at the thought of staying with his  
mother in Sheffield.  Newton was to spend the day with them.  Their  
train was late.  Joking, laughing, with their pipes between their  
teeth, the young men swung their bags on to the tram-car.  Paul  
had bought his mother a little collar of real lace that he wanted  
to see her wear, so that he could tease her about it.  
</p><p>Annie lived in a nice house, and had a little maid.  Paul ran gaily  
up the steps.  He expected his mother laughing in the hall, but it  
was Annie who opened to him.  She seemed distant to him.  He  
stood a second in dismay.  Annie let him kiss her cheek.  
</p><p>"Is my mother ill?" he said.  
</p><p>"Yes; she's not very well.  Don't upset her."  
</p><p>"Is she in bed?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>And then the queer feeling went over him, as if all the sunshine  
had gone out of him, and it was all shadow.  He dropped the bag  
  
  
<pb n="384"/>   
  
and ran upstairs.  Hesitating, he opened the door.  His mother sat  
up in bed, wearing a dressing-gown of old-rose colour.  She looked  
at him almost as if she were ashamed of herself, pleading to him,  
humble.  He saw the ashy look about her.  
</p><p>"Mother!" he said.  
</p><p>"I thought you were never coming," she answered gaily.   
</p><p>But he only fell on his knees at the bedside, and buried his face  
in the bedclothes, crying in agony, and saying:  
</p><p>"Mother &mdash; mother &mdash; mother!"  
</p><p>She stroked his hair slowly with her thin hand.  
</p><p>"Don't cry," she said.  "Don't cry &mdash; it's nothing."  
</p><p>But he felt as if his blood was melting into tears, and he cried  
in terror and pain.  
</p><p>"Don't &mdash; don't cry," his mother faltered.  
</p><p>Slowly she stroked his hair.  Shocked out of himself, he cried,  
and the tears hurt in every fibre of his body.  Suddenly he stopped,  
but he dared not lift his face out of the bedclothes.  
</p><p>"You are late.  Where have you been?" his mother asked.  
</p><p>"The train was late," he replied, muffled in the sheet.  
</p><p>"Yes; that miserable Central! Is Newton come?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"I'm sure you must be hungry, and they've kept dinner waiting."  
</p><p>With a wrench he looked up at her.  
</p><p>"What is it, mother?" he asked brutally.  
</p><p>She averted her eyes as she answered:  
</p><p>"Only a bit of a tumour, my boy.  You needn't trouble.  It's been  
there &mdash; the lump has &mdash; a long time."  
</p><p>Up came the tears again.  His mind was clear and hard, but his  
body was crying.  
</p><p>"Where?" he said.  
</p><p>She put her hand on her side.  
</p><p>"Here.  But you know they can sweal a tumour away."  
</p><p>He stood feeling dazed and helpless, like a child.  He thought  
perhaps it was as she said.  Yes; he reassured himself it was so.   
But all the while his blood and his body knew definitely what it  
was.  He sat down on the bed, and took her hand.  She had never  
had but the one ring &mdash; her wedding-ring.  
</p><p>"When were you poorly?" he asked.  
</p><p>"It was yesterday it began," she answered submissively.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="385"/>   
  
<p>"Pains?"  
</p><p>"Yes; but not more than I've often had at home.  I believe Dr.  
Ansell is an alarmist."  
</p><p>"You ought not to have travelled alone," he said, to himself  
more than to her.  
</p><p>"As if that had anything to do with it!" she answered quickly.  
</p><p>They were silent for a while.  
</p><p>"Now go and have your dinner," she said.  "You must be  
hungry."  
</p><p>"Have you had yours?"  
</p><p>"Yes; a beautiful sole I had.  Annie is good to me."  
</p><p>They talked a little while, then he went downstairs.  He was  
very white and strained.  Newton sat in miserable sympathy.  
</p><p>After dinner he went into the scullery to help Annie to wash  
up. The little maid had gone on an errand.  
</p><p>"Is it really a tumour?" he asked.  
</p><p>Annie began to cry again.  
</p><p>"The pain she had yesterday &mdash; I never saw anybody suffer like  
it!" she cried.  "Leonard ran like a madman for Dr. Ansell, and  
when she'd got to bed she said to me: 'Annie, look at this lump  
on my side.  I wonder what it is?' And there I looked, and I  
thought I should have dropped.  Paul, as true as I'm here, it's a  
lump as big as my double fist.  I said: 'Good gracious, mother,  
whenever did that come?' 'Why, child,' she said, 'it's been there a  
long time.' I thought I should have died, our Paul, I did.  She's been  
having these pains for months at home, and nobody looking after  
her."  
</p><p>The tears came to his eyes, then dried suddenly.  
</p><p>"But she's been attending the doctor in Nottingham &mdash; and she  
never told me," he said.  
</p><p>"If I'd have been at home," said Annie, "I should have seen for  
myself."  
</p><p>He felt like a man walking in unrealities.  In the afternoon he  
went to see the doctor.  The latter was a shrewd, lovable man.  
</p><p>"But what is it?" he said.  
</p><p>The doctor looked at the young man, then knitted his fingers.   
</p><p>"It may be a large tumour which has formed in the membrane,"  
he said slowly, "and which we may be able to make go away."  
</p><p>"Can't you operate?" asked Paul.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="386"/>   
  
<p>"Not there," replied the doctor.  
</p><p>"Are you sure?"  
</p><p>"Quite!"  
</p><p>Paul meditated a while.  
</p><p>"Are you sure it's a tumour?" he asked.  "Why did Dr. Jameson  
in Nottingham never find out anything about it? She's been going  
to him for weeks, and he's treated her for heart and indigestion."  
</p><p>"Mrs. Morel never told Dr. Jameson about the lump," said the  
doctor.  
</p><p>"And do you know it's a tumour?"  
</p><p>"No, I am not sure."  
</p><p>"What else might it be? You asked my sister if there was cancer  
in the family.  Might it be cancer?"  
</p><p>"I don't know."  
</p><p>"And what shall you do?"  
</p><p>"I should like an examination, with Dr. Jameson."  
</p><p>"Then have one."  
</p><p>"You must arrange about that.  His fee wouldn't be less than  
ten guineas to come here from Nottingham."  
</p><p>"When would you like him to come?"  
</p><p>"I will call in this evening, and we will talk it over."  
</p><p>Paul went away, biting his lip.  
</p><p>His mother could come downstairs for tea, the doctor said.  Her  
son went upstairs to help her.  She wore the old-rose dressing-gown that Leonard had given Annie, and, with a little colour in  
her face, was quite young again.  
</p><p>"But you look quite pretty in that," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes; they make me so fine, I hardly know myself," she  
answered.  
</p><p>But when she stood up to walk, the colour went.  Paul helped  
her, half-carrying her.  At the top of the stairs she was gone.  He  
lifted her up and carried her quickly downstairs; laid her on the  
couch.  She was light and frail.  Her face looked as if she were dead,  
with blue lips shut tight.  Her eyes opened &mdash; her blue, unfailing eyes  
&mdash; and she looked at him pleadingly, almost wanting him to forgive  
her.  He held brandy to her lips, but her mouth would not open.   
All the time she watched him lovingly.  She was only sorry for him.   
The tears ran down his face without ceasing, but not a muscle  
moved.  He was intent on getting a little brandy between her lips.  
  
  
<pb n="387"/>   
  
Soon she was able to swallow a teaspoonful.  She lay back, so tired.  
The tears continued to run down his face.  
</p><p>"But," she panted, "it'll go off.  Don't cry!"  
</p><p>"I'm not doing," he said.  
</p><p>After a while she was better again.  He was kneeling beside the  
couch.  They looked into each other's eyes.  
</p><p>"I don't want you to make a trouble of it," she said.  
</p><p>"No, mother.  You'll have to be quite still, and then you'll get  
better soon."  
</p><p>But he was white to the lips, and their eyes as they looked at  
each other understood.  Her eyes were so blue &mdash; such a wonderful  
forget-me-not blue! He felt if only they had been of a different colour   
he could have borne it better.  His heart seemed to be ripping  
slowly in his breast.  He kneeled there, holding her hand, and neither   
said anything.  Then Annie came in.  
</p><p>"Are you all right?" she murmured timidly to her mother.  
</p><p>"Of course," said Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p>Paul sat down and told her about Blackpool.  She was curious.  
</p><p>A day or two after, he went to see Dr. Jameson in Nottingham,  
to arrange for a consultation.  Paul had practically no money in the  
world.  But he could borrow.  
</p><p>His mother had been used to go to the public consultation on  
Saturday morning, when she could see the doctor for only a nominal sum.    
Her son went on the same day.  The waiting-room was  
full of poor women, who sat patiently on a bench around the wall.   
Paul thought of his mother, in her little black costume, sitting  
waiting likewise.  The doctor was late.  The women all looked rather  
frightened.  Paul asked the nurse in attendance if he could see the  
doctor immediately he came.  It was arranged so.  The women sitting   
patiently round the walls of the room eyed the young man  
curiously.  
</p><p>At last the doctor came.  He was about forty, good-looking,  
brown-skinned.  His wife had died, and he, who had loved her, had  
specialised on women's ailments.  Paul told his name and his  
mother's.  The doctor did not remember.  
</p><p>"Number forty-six M.," said the nurse; and the doctor looked  
up the case in his book.  
</p><p>"There is a big lump that may be a tumour," said Paul.  "But  
Dr. Ansell was going to write you a letter."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="388"/>   
  
<p>"Ah, yes!" replied the doctor, drawing the letter from his pocket.   
He was very friendly, affable, busy, kind.  He would come to Sheffield   
the next day.  
</p><p>"What is your father?" he asked.  
</p><p>"He is a coal-miner," replied Paul.  
</p><p>"Not very well off, I suppose?"  
</p><p>"This &mdash; I see after this," said Paul.  
</p><p>"And you?" smiled the doctor.  
</p><p>"I am a clerk in Jordan's Appliance Factory."  
</p><p>The doctor smiled at him.  
</p><p>"Er &mdash; to go to Sheffield!" he said, putting the tips of his fingers  
together, and smiling with his eyes.  "Eight guineas?"  
</p><p>"Thank you!" said Paul, flushing and rising.  "And you'll come  
to-morrow?"  
</p><p>"To-morrow &mdash; Sunday? Yes! Can you tell me about what time  
there is a train in the afternoon?"  
</p><p>"There is a Central gets in at four-fifteen."  
</p><p>"And will there be any way of getting up to the house? Shall  
I have to walk?" The doctor smiled.  
</p><p>"There is the tram," said Paul; "the Western Park tram."  
</p><p>The doctor made a note of it.  
</p><p>"Thank you!" he said, and shook hands.  
</p><p>Then Paul went on home to see his father, who was left in the  
charge of Minnie.  Walter Morel was getting very grey now.  Paul  
found him digging in the garden.  He had written him a letter.  He  
shook hands with his father.  
</p><p>"Hello, son! Tha has landed, then?" said the father.  
</p><p>"Yes," replied the son.  "But I'm going back to-night."  
</p><p>"Are ter, beguy!" exclaimed the collier.  "An' has ter eaten owt?"  
</p><p>"No."  
</p><p>"That's just like thee," said Morel.  "Come thy ways in."  
</p><p>The father was afraid of the mention of his wife.  The two went  
indoors.  Paul ate in silence; his father, with earthy hands, and  
sleeves rolled up, sat in the arm-chair opposite and looked at him.  
</p><p>"Well, an' how is she?" asked the miner at length, in a little  
voice.  
</p><p>"She can sit up; she can be carried down for tea," said Paul.  
</p><p>"That's a blessin'!" exclaimed Morel.  "I hope we s'll soon be  
havin' her whoam, then.  An' what's that Nottingham doctor say?"</p>  
  
  
<pb n="389"/>   
  
<p>"He's going to-morrow to have an examination of her."  
</p><p>"Is he beguy! That's a tidy penny, I'm thinkin'!"  
</p><p>"Eight guineas."  
</p><p>"Eight guineas!" the miner spoke breathlessly.  "Well, we mun  
find it from somewhere."  
</p><p>"I can pay that," said Paul.  
</p><p>There was silence between them for some time.  
</p><p>"She says she hopes you're getting on all right with Minnie,"  
Paul said.  
</p><p>"Yes, I'm all right, an' I wish as she was," answered Morel.  
"But Minnie's a good little wench, bless 'er heart!" He sat looking   
dismal.  
</p><p>"I s'll have to be going at half-past three," said Paul.  
</p><p>"It's a trapse for thee, lad! Eight guineas! An' when dost think  
she'll be able to get as far as this?"  
</p><p>"We must see what the doctors say to-morrow," Paul said.  
</p><p>Morel sighed deeply.  The house seemed strangely empty, and  
Paul thought his father looked lost, forlorn, and old.  
</p><p>"You'll have to go and see her next week, father," he said.  
</p><p>"I hope she'll be a-whoam by that time," said Morel.  
</p><p>"If she's not," said Paul, "then you must come."  
</p><p>"I dunno wheer I s'll find th' money," said Morel.  
</p><p>"And I'll write to you what the doctor says," said Paul.  
</p><p>"But tha writes i' such a fashion, I canna ma'e it out," said  
Morel.  
</p><p>"Well, I'll write plain."  
</p><p>It was no good asking Morel to answer, for he could scarcely  
do more than write his own name.  
</p><p>The doctor came.  Leonard felt it his duty to meet him with a  
cab.  The examination did not take long.  Annie, Arthur, Paul, and  
Leonard were waiting in the parlour anxiously.  The doctors came  
down.  Paul glanced at them.  He had never had any hope, except  
when he had deceived himself.  
</p><p>"It may be a tumour; we must wait and see," said Dr. Jameson.  
</p><p>"And if it is," said Annie, "can you sweal it away?"  
</p><p>"Probably," said the doctor.  
</p><p>Paul put eight sovereigns and half a sovereign on the table.  The  
doctor counted them, took a florin out of his purse, and put that  
down.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="390"/>   
  
<p>"Thank you!" he said.  "I'm sorry Mrs. Morel is so ill.  But we  
must see what we can do."  
</p><p>"There can't be an operation?" said Paul.  
</p><p>The doctor shook his head.  
</p><p>"No," he said; "and even if there could, her heart wouldn't stand  
it."  
</p><p>"Is her heart risky?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>"Yes; you must be careful with her."  
</p><p>"Very risky?"  
</p><p>"No &mdash; er &mdash; no, no! Just take care."  
</p><p>And the doctor was gone.  
</p><p>Then Paul carried his mother downstairs.  She lay simply, like a  
child.  But when he was on the stairs, she put her arms round his  
neck, clinging.  
</p><p>"I'm so frightened of these beastly stairs," she said.  
</p><p>And he was frightened, too.  He would let Leonard do it another  
time.  He felt he could not carry her.  
</p><p>"He thinks it's only a tumour!" cried Annie to her mother.  "And  
he can sweal it away."  
</p><p>"I knew he could," protested Mrs. Morel scornfully.  
</p><p>She pretended not to notice that Paul had gone out of the room.   
He sat in the kitchen, smoking.  Then he tried to brush some grey  
ash off his coat.  He looked again.  It was one of his mother's grey  
hairs.  It was so long! He held it up, and it drifted into the chimney.   
He let go.  The long grey hair floated and was gone in the blackness  
of the chimney.  
</p><p>The next day he kissed her before going back to work.  It was  
very early in the morning, and they were alone.  
</p><p>"You won't fret, my boy!" she said.  
</p><p>"No, mother."  
</p><p>"No; it would be silly.  And take care of yourself."  
</p><p>"Yes," he answered.  Then, after a while: "And I shall come  
next Saturday, and shall bring my father?"  
</p><p>"I suppose he wants to come," she replied.  "At any rate, if he  
does you'll have to let him."  
</p><p>He kissed her again, and stroked the hair from her temples,   
gently, tenderly, as if she were a lover.  
</p><p>"Shan't you be late?" she murmured.  
</p><p>"I'm going," he said, very low.</p>  
  
<pb n="391"/>   
  
<p>Still he sat a few minutes, stroking the brown and grey hair from  
her temples.  
</p><p> "And you won't be any worse, mother?"  
</p><p> "No, my son."  
</p><p> "You promise me?"  
</p><p> "Yes; I won't be any worse."  
</p><p>He kissed her, held her in his arms for a moment, and was gone.   
In the early sunny morning he ran to the station, crying all the way;  
he did not know what for.  And her blue eyes were wide and staring   
as she thought of him.  
</p><p>In the afternoon he went a walk with Clara.  They sat in the little  
wood where bluebells were standing.  He took her hand.  
</p><p> "You'll see," he said to Clara, "she'll never be better."  
</p><p> "Oh, you don't know!" replied the other.  
</p><p> "I do," he said.  
</p><p> She caught him impulsively to her breast.  
</p><p> "Try and forget it, dear," she said; "try and forget it."  
</p><p> "I will," he answered.  
</p><p>Her breast was there, warm for him; her hands were in his hair.   
It was comforting, and he held his arms round her.  But he did not  
forget.  He only talked to Clara of something else.  And it was always   
so.  When she felt it coming, the agony, she cried to him:  
</p><p>"Don't think of it, Paul! Don't think of it, my darling!"  
</p><p>And she pressed him to her breast, rocked him, soothed him  
like a child.  So he put the trouble aside for her sake, to take it up  
again immediately he was alone.  All the time, as he went about,  
he cried mechanically.  His mind and hands were busy.  He cried,  
he did not know why.  It was his blood weeping.  He was just as  
much alone whether he was with Clara or with the men in the  
White Horse.  Just himself and this pressure inside him, that was  
all that existed.  He read sometimes.  He had to keep his mind occupied.    
And Clara was a way of occupying his mind.  
</p><p>On the Saturday Walter Morel went to Sheffield.  He was a forlorn   
figure, looking rather as if nobody owned him.  Paul ran upstairs.  
</p><p> "My father's come," he said, kissing his mother.  
</p><p> "Has he?" she answered wearily.  
</p><p> The old collier came rather frightened into the bedroom.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="392"/>   
  
<p>"How dun I find thee, lass?" he said, going forward and kissing  
her in a hasty, timid fashion.  
</p><p>"Well, I'm middlin'," she replied.  
</p><p>"I see tha art," he said.  He stood looking down on her.  Then  
he wiped his eyes with his handkerchief.  Helpless, and as if nobody   
owned him, he looked.  
</p><p> "Have you gone on all right?" asked the wife, rather wearily,  
as if it were an effort to talk to him.  
</p><p> "Yis," he answered.  "'Er's a bit behint-hand now and again,  
yer might expect."  
</p><p> "Does she have your dinner ready?" asked Mrs. Morel.  
</p><p> "Well, I've 'ad to shout at 'er once or twice," he said.  
</p><p> "And you must shout at her if she's not ready.  She will leave  
things to the last minute."  
</p><p>She gave him a few instructions.  He sat looking at her as if she  
were almost a stranger to him, before whom he was awkward and  
humble, and also as if he had lost his presence of mind, and wanted  
to run.  This feeling that he wanted to run away, that he was on  
thorns to be gone from so trying a situation, and yet must linger  
because it looked better, made his presence so trying.  He put up  
his eyebrows for misery, and clenched his fists on his knees, feeling   
so awkward in presence of big trouble.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel did not change much.  She stayed in Sheffield for  
two months.  If anything, at the end she was rather worse.  But  
she wanted to go home.  Annie had her children.  Mrs. Morel  
wanted to go home.  So they got a motor-car from Nottingham &mdash;  
for she was too ill to go by train &mdash; and she was driven through the  
sunshine.  It was just August; everything was bright and warm.   
Under the blue sky they could all see she was dying.  Yet she was  
jollier than she had been for weeks.  They all laughed and talked.  
</p><p>"Annie," she exclaimed, "I saw a lizard dart on that rock!"  
</p><p>Her eyes were so quick; she was still so full of life.  
</p><p>Morel knew she was coming.  He had the front door open.   
Everybody was on tiptoe.  Half the street turned out.  They heard  
the sound of the great motor-car.  Mrs. Morel, smiling, drove  
home down the street.  
</p><p>"And just look at them all come out to see me!" she said.  "But  
there, I suppose I should have done the same.  How do you do,  
Mrs. Mathews? How are you, Mrs. Harrison?"</p>  
  
<pb n="393"/>   
  
<p>They none of them could hear, but they saw her smile and nod.   
And they all saw death on her face, they said.  It was a great event  
in the street.  
</p><p>Morel wanted to carry her indoors, but he was too old.  Arthur  
took her as if she were a child.  They had set her a big, deep chair  
by the hearth where her rocking-chair used to stand.  When she  
was unwrapped and seated, and had drunk a little brandy, she  
looked round the room.  
</p><p>"Don't think I don't like your house, Annie," she said; "but  
it's nice to be in my own home again."  
</p><p> And Morel answered huskily:  
</p><p> "It is, lass, it is."  
</p><p> And Minnie, the little quaint maid, said:  
</p><p> "An' we glad t' 'ave yer."  
</p><p> There was a lovely yellow ravel of sunflowers in the garden.  
She looked out of the window.  
</p><p> "There are my sunflowers!" she said.</p>

<head>"The Release"</head>  
 
  
  
<p> "By the way," said Dr. Ansell one evening when Morel was in  
Sheffield, "we've got a man in the fever hospital here who comes  
from Nottingham &mdash; Dawes.  He doesn't seem to have many belongings   
in this world."  
</p><p> "Baxter Dawes!" Paul exclaimed.  
</p><p>"That's the man &mdash; has been a fine fellow, physically, I should  
think.  Been in a bit of a mess lately.  You know him?"  
</p><p> "He used to work at the place where I am."  
</p><p>"Did he? Do you know anything about him? He's just sulking,  
or he'd be a lot better than he is by now."  
</p><p>"I don't know anything of his home circumstances, except that  
he's separated from his wife and has been a bit down, I believe.   
But tell him about me, will you? Tell him I'll come and see him."  
</p><p> The next time Morel saw the doctor he said:  
</p><p> "And what about Dawes?"  
</p><p> "I said to him," answered the other, "'Do you know a man from  
  
  
<pb n="394"/>   
  
Nottingham named Morel?' and he looked at me as if he'd jump  
at my throat.  So I said: 'I see you know the name; it's Paul Morel.'  
Then I told him about your saying you would go and see him.   
'What does he want?' he said, as if you were a policeman."  
</p><p>"And did he say he would see me?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>"He wouldn't say anything &mdash; good, bad or indifferent," replied  
the doctor.  
</p><p>"Why not?"  
</p><p>"That's what I want to know.  There he lies and sulks, day in,  
day out.  Can't get a word of information out of him."  
</p><p>"Do you think I might go?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>"You might."  
</p><p>There was a feeling of connection between the rival men, more  
than ever since they had fought.  In a way Morel felt guilty towards  
the other, and more or less responsible.  And being in such a state  
of soul himself, he felt an almost painful nearness to Dawes, who  
was suffering and despairing, too.  Besides, they had met in a  
naked extremity of hate, and it was a bond.  At any rate, the elemental   
man in each had met.  
</p><p>He went down to the isolation hospital, with Dr. Ansell's card.  This  
sister, a healthy young Irishwoman, led him down the ward.  
</p><p>"A visitor to see you, Jim Crow," she said.  
</p><p>Dawes turned over suddenly with a startled grunt.  
</p><p>"Eh?"  
</p><p>"Caw!" she mocked.  "He can only say 'Caw!' I have brought  
you a gentleman to see you.  Now say 'Thank you,' and show some  
manners."  
</p><p>Dawes looked swiftly with his dark, startled eyes beyond the  
sister at Paul.  His look was full of fear, mistrust, hate, and misery.   
Morel met the swift, dark eyes, and hesitated.  The two men were  
afraid of the naked selves they had been.  
</p><p>"Dr.  Ansell told me you were here," said Morel, holding out  
his hand.  
</p><p>Dawes mechanically shook hands.  
</p><p>"So I thought I'd come in," continued Paul.  
</p><p>There was no answer.  Dawes lay staring at the opposite wall.  
</p><p>"Say 'Caw!"' mocked the nurse.  "Say 'Caw!' Jim Crow."  
</p><p>"He is getting on all right?" said Paul to her.  
</p><p>"Oh yes! He lies and imagines he's going to die," said the nurse,  
"and it frightens every word out of his mouth."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="395"/>   
  
<p>"And you must have somebody to talk to," laughed Morel.  
</p><p>"That's it!" laughed the nurse.  "Only two old men and a boy  
who always cries.  It is hard lines! Here am I dying to hear Jim  
Crow's voice, and nothing but an odd 'Caw!' will he give!"  
</p><p>"So rough on you!" said Morel.  
</p><p>"Isn't it?" said the nurse.  
</p><p>"I suppose I am a godsend," he laughed.  
</p><p>"Oh, dropped straight from heaven!" laughed the nurse.  
</p><p>Presently she left the two men alone.  Dawes was thinner, and  
handsome again, but life seemed low in him.  As the doctor said, he  
was lying sulking, and would not move forward towards convalescence.    
He seemed to grudge every beat of his heart.  
</p><p>"Have you had a bad time?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>Suddenly again Dawes looked at him.  
</p><p>"What are you doing in Sheffield?" he asked.  
</p><p>"My mother was taken ill at my sister's in Thurston Street.  What  
are you doing here?"  
</p><p>There was no answer.  
</p><p>"How long have you been in?" Morel asked.  
</p><p>"I couldn't say for sure," Dawes answered grudgingly.  
</p><p>He lay staring across at the wall opposite, as if trying to believe  
Morel was not there.  Paul felt his heart go hard and angry.  
</p><p>"Dr. Ansell told me you were here," he said coldly.  
</p><p>The other man did not answer.  
</p><p>"Typhoid's pretty bad, I know," Morel persisted.  
</p><p>Suddenly Dawes said:  
</p><p>"What did you come for?"  
</p><p>"Because Dr. Ansell said you didn't know anybody here.  Do  
you?"  
</p><p>"I know nobody nowhere," said Dawes.  
</p><p>"Well," said Paul, "it's because you don't choose to, then."  
</p><p>There was another silence.  
</p><p>"We s'll be taking my mother home as soon as we can," said  
Paul.  
</p><p>"What's a-matter with her?" asked Dawes, with a sick man's   
interest in illness.  
</p><p>"She's got a cancer."  
</p><p>There was another silence.  
</p><p>"But we want to get her home," said Paul.  "We s'll have to get  
a motor-car."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="396"/>   
  
<p> Dawes lay thinking.  
</p><p> "Why don't you ask Thomas Jordan to lend you his?" said  
Dawes.  
</p><p> "It's not big enough," Morel answered.  
</p><p> Dawes blinked his dark eyes as he lay thinking.  
</p><p> "Then ask Jack Pilkington; he'd lend it you.  You know him."  
</p><p> "I think I s'll hire one," said Paul.  
</p><p> "You're a fool if you do," said Dawes.  
</p><p> The sick man was gaunt and handsome again.  Paul was sorry  
for him because his eyes looked so tired.  
</p><p> "Did you get a job here?" he asked.  
</p><p> "I was only here a day or two before I was taken bad," Dawes  
replied.  
</p><p> "You want to get in a convalescent home," said Paul.  
</p><p> The other's face clouded again.  
</p><p> "I'm goin' in no convalescent home," he said.  
</p><p> "My father's been in the one at Seathorpe, an' he liked it.  Dr.  
Ansell would get you a recommend."  
</p><p> Dawes lay thinking.  It was evident he dared not face the  
world again.  
</p><p> "The seaside would be all right just now," Morel said.  "Sun on  
those sandhills, and the waves not far out."  
</p><p> The other did not answer.  
</p><p> "By Gad!" Paul concluded, too miserable to bother much; "it's  
all right when you know you're going to walk again, and swim!"  
</p><p> Dawes glanced at him quickly.  The man's dark eyes were afraid  
to meet any other eyes in the world.  But the real misery and   
helplessness in Paul's tone gave him a feeling of relief.  
</p><p> "Is she far gone?" he asked.  
</p><p> "She's going like wax," Paul answered; "but cheerful &mdash; lively!"  
</p><p> He bit his lip.  After a minute he rose.  
</p><p> "Well, I'll be going," he said.  "I'll leave you this half-crown."  
</p><p> "I don't want it," Dawes muttered.  
</p><p> Morel did not answer, but left the coin on the table.  
</p><p> "Well," he said, "I'll try and run in when I'm back in Sheffield.  
Happen you might like to see my brother-in-law? He works in  
Pyecrofts."  
</p><p> "I don't know him," said Dawes.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="397"/>   
<p>"He's all right.  Should I tell him to come? He might bring you  
some papers to look at."  
</p><p>The other man did not answer.  Paul went.  The strong emotion  
that Dawes aroused in him, repressed, made him shiver.  
</p><p>He did not tell his mother, but next day he spoke to Clara about  
this interview.  It was in the dinner-hour.  The two did not often go  
out together now, but this day he asked her to go with him to the  
Castle grounds.  There they sat while the scarlet geraniums and  
the yellow calceolarias blazed in the sunlight.  She was now always  
rather protective, and rather resentful towards him.  
</p><p>"Did you know Baxter was in Sheffield Hospital with typhoid?"  
he asked.  
</p><p>She looked at him with startled grey eyes, and her face went  
pale.  
</p><p> "No," she said, frightened.  
</p><p>"He's getting better.  I went to see him yesterday &mdash; the doctor  
told me."  
</p><p> Clara seemed stricken by the news.  
</p><p> "Is he very bad?" she asked guiltily.  
</p><p> "He has been.  He's mending now."  
</p><p> "What did he say to you?"  
</p><p> "Oh, nothing! He seems to be sulking."  
</p><p>There was a distance between the two of them.  He gave her  
more information.  
</p><p>She went about shut up and silent.  The next time they took a  
walk together, she disengaged herself from his arm, and walked  
at a distance from him.  He was wanting her comfort badly.  
</p><p> "Won't you be nice with me?" he asked.  
</p><p> She did not answer.  
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he said, putting his arm across her  
shoulder.  
</p><p> "Don't!" she said, disengaging herself.  
</p><p> He left her alone, and returned to his own brooding.  
</p><p> "Is it Baxter that upsets you?" he asked at length.  
</p><p> "I have been vile to him!" she said.  
</p><p>"I've said many a time you haven't treated him well," he  
replied.  
</p><p>And there was a hostility between them.  Each pursued his own  
train of thought.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="398"/>   
  
<p>"I've treated him &mdash; no, I've treated him badly," she said.  "And  
now you treat me badly.  It serves me right."  
</p><p>"How do I treat you badly?" he said.  
</p><p>"It serves me right," she repeated.  "I never considered him  
worth having, and now you don't consider me.  But it serves me  
right.  He loved me a thousand times better than you ever did."  
</p><p> "He didn't!" protested Paul.  
</p><p>"He did! At any rate, he did respect me, and that's what you  
don't do."  
</p><p>"It looked as if he respected you!" he said.  
</p><p>"He did! And I made him horrid &mdash; I know I did! You've taught  
me that.  And he loved me a thousand times better than ever you  
do."  
</p><p>"All right," said Paul.  
</p><p>He only wanted to be left alone now.  He had his own trouble,  
which was almost too much to bear.  Clara only tormented him  
and made him tired.  He was not sorry when he left her.  
</p><p>She went on the first opportunity to Sheffield to see her husband.   
The meeting was not a success.  But she left him roses and fruit  
and money.  She wanted to make restitution.  It was not that she  
loved him.  As she looked at him lying there her heart did not  
warm with love.  Only she wanted to humble herself to him, to  
kneel before him.  She wanted now to be self-sacrificial.  After all,  
she had failed to make Morel really love her.  She was morally  
frightened.  She wanted to do penance.  So she kneeled to Dawes,  
and it gave him a subtle pleasure.  But the distance between them  
was still very great &mdash; too great.  It frightened the man.  It almost  
pleased the woman.  She liked to feel she was serving him across  
an insuperable distance.  She was proud now.  
</p><p>Morel went to see Dawes once or twice.  There was a sort of  
friendship between the two men, who were all the while deadly  
rivals.  But they never mentioned the woman who was between  
them.  
</p><p>Mrs. Morel got gradually worse.  At first they used to carry her  
downstairs, sometimes even into the garden.  She sat propped in  
her chair, smiling, and so pretty.  The gold wedding-ring shone on  
her white hand; her hair was carefully brushed.  And she watched  
the tangled sunflowers dying, the chrysanthemums coming out,  
and the dahlias.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="399"/>   
  
<p>Paul and she were afraid of each other.  He knew, and she knew,  
that she was dying.  But they kept up a pretence of cheerfulness.   
Every morning, when he got up, he went into her room in his  
pyjamas.  
</p><p> "Did you sleep, my dear?" he asked.  
</p><p> "Yes," she answered.  
</p><p> "Not very well?"  
</p><p> "Well, yes! "  
</p><p>Then he knew she had lain awake.  He saw her hand under the  
bedclothes, pressing the place on her side where the pain was.  
</p><p> "Has it been bad?" he asked.  
</p><p> "No.  It hurt a bit, but nothing to mention."  
</p><p>And she sniffed in her old scornful way.  As she lay she looked  
like a girl.  And all the while her blue eyes watched him.  But there  
were the dark pain-circles beneath that made him ache  
again.  
</p><p> "It's a sunny day," he said.  
</p><p> "It's a beautiful day."  
</p><p> "Do you think you'll be carried down?"  
</p><p> "I shall see."  
</p><p>Then he went away to get her breakfast.  All day long he was  
conscious of nothing but her.  It was a long ache that made him  
feverish.  Then, when he got home in the early evening, he glanced  
through the kitchen window.  She was not there; she had not got  
up.  
</p><p>He ran straight upstairs and kissed her.  He was almost afraid  
to ask:  
</p><p> "Didn't you get up, pigeon?"  
</p><p> "No," she said.  "it was that morphia; it made me tired."  
</p><p> "I think he gives you too much," he said.  
</p><p> "I think he does," she answered.  
</p><p>He sat down by the bed, miserably.  She had a way of curling  
and lying on her side, like a child.  The grey and brown hair was  
loose over her ear.  
</p><p> "Doesn't it tickle you?" he said, gently putting it back.  
</p><p> "It does," she replied.  
</p><p>His face was near hers.  Her blue eyes smiled straight into his,  
like a girl's &mdash; warm, laughing with tender love.  It made him pant  
with terror, agony, and love.  
</p><p> "You want your hair doing in a plait," he said.  "Lie still."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="400"/>   
  
<p>And going behind her, he carefully loosened her hair, brushed  
it out.  It was like fine long silk of brown and grey.  Her head was  
snuggled between her shoulders.  As he lightly brushed and plaited  
her hair, he bit his lip and felt dazed.  It all seemed unreal, he could  
not understand it.  
</p><p>At night he often worked in her room, looking up from time to  
time.  And so often he found her blue eyes fixed on him.  And when  
their eyes met, she smiled.  He worked away again mechanically,  
producing good stuff without knowing what he was doing.  
</p><p>Sometimes he came in, very pale and still, with watchful, sudden   
eyes, like a man who is drunk almost to death.  They were both  
afraid of the veils that were ripping between them.  
</p><p>Then she pretended to be better, chattered to him gaily, made  
a great fuss over some scraps of news.  For they had both come to  
the condition when they had to make much of the trifles, lest they  
should give in to the big thing, and their human independence  
would go smash.  They were afraid, so they made light of things  
and were gay.  
</p><p>Sometimes as she lay he knew  
she was thinking of the past.  Her  
mouth gradually shut hard in a line.  She was holding herself rigid,  
so that she might die without ever uttering the great cry that was  
tearing from her.  He never forgot that hard, utterly lonely and  
stubborn clenching of her mouth, which persisted for weeks.  Sometimes,   
when it was lighter, she talked about her husband.  Now  
she hated him.  She did not forgive him.  She could not bear him  
to be in the room.  And a few things, the things that had been most  
bitter to her, came up again so strongly that they broke from her,  
and she told her son.  
</p><p>He felt as if his life were being destroyed, piece by piece, within  
him.  Often the tears came suddenly.  He ran to the station, the tear-drops falling on the pavement.  Often he could not go on with  
his work.  The pen stopped writing.  He sat staring, quite unconscious.    
And when he came round again he felt sick, and trembled  
in his limbs.  He never questioned what it was.  His mind did not  
try to analyse or understand.  He merely submitted, and kept his  
eyes shut; let the thing go over him.  
</p><p>His mother did the same.  She thought of the pain, of the morphia,   
of the next day; hardly ever of the death.  That was coming,  
she knew.  She had to submit to it.  But she would never entreat it  
  
  
<pb n="401"/>   
  
or make friends with it.  Blind, with her face shut hard and blind,  
she was pushed towards the door.  The days passed, the weeks,  
the months.  
</p><p>Sometimes, in the sunny afternoons, she seemed almost happy.  
</p><p>"I try to think of the nice times &mdash; when we went to Mablethorpe,  
and Robin Hood's Bay, and Shanklin," she said.  "After all, not  
everybody has seen those beautiful places.  And wasn't it beautiful!  
I try to think of that, not of the other things."  
</p><p>Then, again, for a whole evening she spoke not a word; neither  
did he.  They were together, rigid, stubborn, silent.  He went into  
his room at last to go to bed, and leaned against the doorway as if  
paralysed, unable to go any farther.  His consciousness went.  A  
furious storm, he knew not what, seemed to ravage inside him.   
He stood leaning there, submitting, never questioning.  
</p><p>In the morning they were both normal again, though her face  
was grey with the morphia, and her body felt like ash.  But they  
were bright again, nevertheless.  Often, especially if Annie or Arthur   
were at home, he neglected her.  He did not see much of  
Clara.  Usually he was with men.  He was quick and active and  
lively; but when his friends saw him go white to the gills, his eyes  
dark and glittering, they had a certain mistrust of him. Sometimes  
he went to Clara, but she was almost cold to him.  
</p><p>"Take me!" he said simply.  
</p><p>Occasionally she would.  But she was afraid.  When he had her  
then, there was something in it that made her shrink away from  
him &mdash; something unnatural.  She grew to dread him.  He was so  
quiet, yet so strange.  She was afraid of the man who was not there  
with her, whom she could feel behind this make-belief lover; somebody   
sinister, that filled her with horror.  She began to have a kind  
of horror of him.  It was almost as if he were a criminal.  He wanted  
her &mdash; he had her &mdash; and it made her feel as if death itself had her in  
its grip.  She lay in horror.  There was no man there loving her.  She  
almost hated him.  Then came little bouts of tenderness.  But she  
dared not pity him.  
</p><p>Dawes had come to Colonel Seely's Home near Nottingham.   
There Paul visited him sometimes, Clara very occasionally.  Between   
the two men the friendship developed peculiarly.  Dawes,  
who mended very slowly and seemed very feeble, seemed to leave  
himself in the hands of Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="402"/>   
  
<p>In the beginning of November Clara reminded Paul that it was  
her birthday.  
</p><p> "I'd nearly forgotten," he said.  
</p><p> "I'd thought quite," she replied.  
</p><p>"No.  Shall we go to the seaside for the week-end?"  
</p><p>They went.  It was cold and rather dismal.  She waited for him  
to be warm and tender with her, instead of which he seemed hardly  
aware of her.  He sat in the railway-carriage, looking out, and was  
startled when she spoke to him.  He was not definitely thinking.   
Things seemed as if they did not exist.  She went across to him.  
</p><p> "What is it dear?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Nothing!" he said.  "Don't those windmill sails look monotonous?"  
</p><p>He sat holding her hand.  He could not talk nor think.  It was a  
comfort, however, to sit holding her hand.  She was dissatisfied  
and miserable.  He was not with her; she was nothing.  
</p><p>And in the evening they sat among the sandhills, looking at the  
black, heavy sea.  
</p><p> "She will never give in," he said quietly.  
</p><p> Clara's heart sank.  
</p><p>"No," she replied.  
</p><p>"There are different ways of dying.  My father's people are  
frightened, and have to be hauled out of life into death like cattle  
into a slaughter-house, pulled by the neck; but my mother's people  
are pushed from behind, inch by inch.  They are stubborn people,  
and won't die."  
</p><p>"Yes," said Clara.  
</p><p>"And she won't die.  She can't.  Mr. Renshaw, the parson, was  
in the other day.  'Think!' he said to her; 'you will have your  
mother and father, and your sisters, and your son, in the Other  
Land.' And she said: 'I have done without them for a long time,  
and can do without them now.  It is the living I want, not the dead.'  
She wants to live even now."  
</p><p>"Oh, how horrible!" said Clara, too frightened to speak.  
</p><p>"And she looks at me, and she wants to stay with me," he went  
on monotonously.  "She's got such a will, it seems as if she would  
never go &mdash; never!"  
</p><p>"Don't think of it!" cried Clara.   
</p><p> "And she was religious &mdash; she is religious now &mdash; but it is no good.  
  
  
<pb n="403"/>   
She simply won't give in.  And do you know, I said to her on  
Thursday: 'Mother, if I had to die, I'd die.  I'd will to die.' And  
she said to me, sharp: 'Do you think I haven't? Do you think you  
can die when you like?"'  
</p><p>His voice ceased.  He did not cry, only went on speaking   
monotonously.  Clara wanted to run.  She looked round.  There was  
the black, re-echoing shore, the dark sky down on her.  She got up  
terrified.  She wanted to be where there was light, where there  
were other people.  She wanted to be away from him.  He sat with  
his head dropped, not moving a muscle.  
</p><p>"And I don't want her to eat," he said, "and she knows it.  When  
I ask her: 'Shall you have anything' she's almost afraid to say 'Yes.'  
'I'll have a cup of Benger's,' she says.  'It'll only keep your strength  
up,' I said to her.  'Yes' &mdash; and she almost cried &mdash; 'but there's such a  
gnawing when I eat nothing, I can't bear it.' So I went and made her  
the food.  It's the cancer that gnaws like that at her.  I wish she'd  
die!"  
</p><p>"Come!" said Clara roughly.  "I'm going."  
</p><p>He followed her down the darkness of the sands.  He did not  
come to her.  He seemed scarcely aware of her existence.  And she  
was afraid of him, and disliked him.  
</p><p>In the same acute daze they went back to Nottingham.  He was  
always busy, always doing something, always going from one to  
the other of his friends.  
</p><p>On the Monday he went to see Baxter Dawes.  Listless and pale,  
the man rose to greet the other, clinging to his chair as he held out  
his hand.  
</p><p> "You shouldn't get up," said Paul.  
</p><p> Dawes sat down heavily, eyeing Morel with a sort of suspicion.  
</p><p>"Don't you waste your time on me," he said, "if you've owt  
better to do."  
</p><p>"I wanted to come," said Paul.  "Here! I brought you some  
sweets."  
</p><p> The invalid put them aside.  
</p><p> "It's not been much of a week-end," said Morel.  
</p><p> "How's your mother?" asked the other.  
</p><p> "Hardly any different."  
</p><p> "I thought she was perhaps worse, being as you didn't come on  
Sunday."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="404"/>   
  
<p> "I was at Skegness," said Paul.  "I wanted a change."  
</p><p> The other looked at him with dark eyes.  He seemed to be waiting,   
not quite daring to ask, trusting to be told.  
</p><p> "I went with Clara," said Paul.  
</p><p> "I knew as much," said Dawes quietly.  
</p><p> "It was an old promise," said Paul.  
</p><p> "You have it your own way," said Dawes.  
</p><p>This was the first time Clara had been definitely mentioned   
between them.  
</p><p> "Nay," said Morel slowly; "she's tired of me."  
</p><p> Again Dawes looked at him.  
</p><p> "Since August she's been getting tired of me," Morel repeated.  
</p><p>The two men were very quiet together.  Paul suggested a game  
of draughts.  They played in silence.  
</p><p> "I s'll go abroad when my mother's dead," said Paul.  
</p><p> "Abroad!" repeated Dawes.  
</p><p> "Yes; I don't care what I do."  
</p><p> They continued the game.  Dawes was winning.  
</p><p>"I s'll have to begin a new start of some sort," said Paul; "and  
you as well, I suppose."  
</p><p> He took one of Dawes's pieces.  
</p><p> "I dunno where," said the other.  
</p><p>"Things have to happen," Morel said.  "It's no good doing   
anything &mdash; at least &mdash; no, I don't know.  Give me some toffee."  
</p><p> The two men ate sweets, and began another game of draughts.  
</p><p> "What made that scar on your mouth?" asked Dawes.  
</p><p>Paul put his hand hastily to his lips, and looked over the  
garden.  
</p><p> "I had a bicycle accident," he said.  
</p><p> Dawes's hand trembled as he moved the piece.  
</p><p> "You shouldn't ha' laughed at me," he said, very low.  
</p><p> "When?"  
</p><p>"That night on Woodborough Road, when you and her passed  
me &mdash; you with your hand on her shoulder."  
</p><p> "I never laughed at you," said Paul.  
</p><p> Dawes kept his fingers on the draught-piece.  
</p><p>"I never knew you were there till the very second when you  
passed," said Morel.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="405"/>   
<p> "It was that as did me," Dawes said, very low.  
</p><p> Paul took another sweet.  
</p><p> "I never laughed," he said, "except as I'm always laughing."  
</p><p> They finished the game.  
</p><p>That night Morel walked home from Nottingham, in order to  
have something to do.  The furnaces flared in a red blotch over Bulwell;   
the black clouds were like a low ceiling.  As he went along the  
ten miles of highroad, he felt as if he were walking out of life,   
between the black levels of the sky and the earth.  But at the end  
was only the sick-room.  If he walked and walked for ever, there  
was only that place to come to.  
</p><p>He was not tired when he got near home, or be did not  
know it.  Across the field he could see the red firelight leaping in  
her bedroom window.  
</p><p>"When she's dead," he said to himself, "that fire will go out."  
</p><p>He took off his boots quietly and crept upstairs.  His mothers  
door was wide open, because she slept alone still.  The red firelight  
dashed its glow on the landing.  Soft as a shadow, he peeped in her  
doorway.  
</p><p> "Paul!" she murmured.  
</p><p> His heart seemed to break again.  He went in and sat by the bed.  
</p><p> "How late you are!" she murmured.  
</p><p> "Not very," he said.  
</p><p>"Why, what time is it?" The murmur came plaintive and  
helpless.  
</p><p> "It's only just gone eleven."  
</p><p> That was not true; it was nearly one o'clock.  
</p><p> "Oh!" she said; "I thought it was later."  
</p><p>And he knew the unutterable misery of her nights that would  
not go.  
</p><p> "Can't you sleep, my pigeon?" he said.  
</p><p> "No, I can't," she wailed.  
</p><p>"Never mind, Little!" be said crooning.  "Never mind, my love.   
I'll stop with you half an hour, my pigeon; then perhaps it will be  
better."  
</p><p>And he sat by the bedside, slowly, rhythmically stroking her  
brows with his finger-tips, stroking her eyes shut, soothing her,  
holding her fingers in his free hand.  They could hear the sleepers'  
breathing in the other rooms.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="406"/>   
  
<p>"Now go to bed," she murmured, lying quite still under his  
fingers and his love.  
</p><p> "Will you sleep?" he asked.  
</p><p> "Yes, I think so."  
</p><p> "You feel better, my Little, don't you?"  
</p><p> "Yes," she said, like a fretful, half-soothed child.  
</p><p>Still the days and the weeks went by.  He hardly ever went to  
see Clara now.  But he wandered restlessly from one person to another   
for some help, and there was none anywhere.  Miriam had  
written to him tenderly.  He went to see her.  Her heart was very  
sore when she saw him, white, gaunt, with his eyes dark and bewildered.    
Her pity came up, hurting her till she could not bear it.  
</p><p> "How is she?" she asked.  
</p><p>"The same &mdash; the same!" he said.  "The doctor says she can't last,  
but I know she will.  She'll be here at Christmas."  
</p><p>Miriam shuddered.  She drew him to her; she pressed him to  
her bosom; she kissed him and kissed him.  He submitted, but  
it was torture.  She could not kiss his agony.  That remained alone  
and apart.  She kissed his face, and roused his blood, while his soul  
was apart writhing with the agony of death.  And she kissed him  
and fingered his body, till at last, feeling he would go mad, he got  
away from her.  It was not what he wanted just then &mdash; not that.   
And she thought she had soothed him and done him good.  
</p><p>December came, and some snow.  He stayed at home all the  
while now.  They could not afford a nurse.  Annie came to look after   
her mother; the parish nurse, whom they loved, came in morning and   
evening.  Paul shared the nursing with Annie.  Often, in the  
evenings, when friends were in the kitchen with them, they all  
laughed together and shook with laughter.  It was reaction.  Paul  
was so comical, Annie was so quaint.  The whole party laughed  
till they cried, trying to subdue the sound.  And Mrs. Morel, lying  
alone in the darkness heard them, and among her bitterness was  
a feeling of relief.  
</p><p>Then Paul would go upstairs gingerly, guiltily, to see if she had  
heard.  
</p><p> "Shall I give you some milk?" he asked.  
</p><p> "A little," she replied plaintively.  
</p><p>And he would put some water with it, so that it should not nourish   
her.  Yet he loved her more than his own life.</p>  
  
<pb n="407"/>   
  
<p>She had morphia every night, and her heart got fitful.  Annie  
slept beside her.  Paul would go in in the early morning, when his  
sister got up.  His mother was wasted and almost ashen in the  
morning with the morphia.  Darker and darker grew her eyes, all  
pupil, with the torture.  In the mornings the weariness and ache  
were too much to bear.  Yet she could not &mdash; would not &mdash; weep, or  
even complain much.  
</p><p>"You slept a bit later this morning, little one," he would say to  
her  
</p><p> "Did I?" she answered, with fretful weariness.  
</p><p> "Yes; it's nearly eight o'clock."  
</p><p>He stood looking out of the window.  The whole country was  
bleak and pallid under the snow.  Then he felt her pulse.  There  
was a strong stroke and a weak one, like a sound and its echo.  That  
was supposed to betoken the end.  She let him feel her wrist, knowing   
what he wanted.  
</p><p>Sometimes they looked in each other's eyes.  Then they almost  
seemed to make an agreement.  It was almost as if he were agreeing   
to die also.  But she did not consent to die; she would not.  Her  
body was wasted to a fragment of ash.  Her eyes were dark and  
full of torture.  
</p><p>"Can't you give her something to put an end to it?" he asked  
the doctor at last.  
</p><p> But the doctor shook his head.  
</p><p> "She can't last many days now, Mr. Morel," he said.  
</p><p> Paul went indoors.  
</p><p> "I can't bear it much longer; we shall all go mad," said Annie.  
</p><p> The two sat down to breakfast.  
</p><p> "Go and sit with her while we have breakfast, Minnie," said  
Annie.  But the girl was frightened.  
</p><p>Paul went through the country, through the woods, over the  
snow.  He saw the marks of rabbits and birds in the white snow.   
He wandered miles and miles.  A smoky red sunset came on slowly,  
painfully, lingering.  He thought she would die that day.  There  
was a donkey that came up to him over the snow by the wood's  
edge, and put its head against him, and walked with him alongside.    
He put his arms round the donkey's neck, and stroked his  
cheeks against his ears.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="408"/>   
  
<p>His mother, silent, was still alive, with her hard mouth gripped  
grimly, her eyes of dark torture only living.  
</p><p>It was nearing Christmas; there was more snow.  Annie and he  
felt as if they could go on no more.  Still her dark eyes were alive.   
Morel, silent and frightened, obliterated himself.  Sometimes he  
would go into the sick-room and look at her.  Then he backed out,  
bewildered.  
</p><p>She kept her hold on life still.  The miners had been out on  
strike, and returned a fortnight or so before Christmas.  Minnie  
went upstairs with the feeding-cup.  It was two days after the men  
had been in.  
</p><p>"Have the men been saying their hands are sore, Minnie?" she  
asked, in the faint, querulous voice that would not give in.  Minnie  
stood surprised.  
</p><p>"Not as I know of, Mrs. Morel," she answered.  
</p><p>"But I'll bet they are sore," said the dying woman, as she moved  
her head with a sigh of weariness.  "But, at any rate, there'll be  
something to buy in with this week."  
</p><p> Not a thing did she let slip.  
</p><p>"Your father's pit things will want well airing, Annie," she said,  
when the men were going back to work.  
</p><p> "Don't you bother about that, my dear," said Annie.  
</p><p> One night Annie and Paul were alone.  Nurse was upstairs.  
</p><p>"She'll live over Christmas," said Annie.  They were both full  
of horror.  
</p><p>"She won't," he replied grimly.  "I s'll give her morphia."  
</p><p> "Which?" said Annie.  
</p><p> "All that came from Sheffield," said Paul.  
</p><p> "Ay &mdash; do!" said Annie.  
</p><p>The next day he was painting in the bedroom.  She seemed to  
be asleep.  He stepped softly backwards and forwards at his painting.    
Suddenly her small voice wailed:  
</p><p> "Don't walk about, Paul."  
</p><p>He looked round.  Her eyes, like dark bubbles in her face, were  
looking at him.  
</p><p>"No, my dear," he said gently.  Another fibre seemed to snap  
in his heart.  
</p><p>That evening he got all the morphia pills there were, and took  
them downstairs.  Carefully he crushed them to powder.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="409"/>   
  
<p> "What are you doing?" said Annie.  
</p><p> "I s'll put 'em in her night milk."  
</p><p>Then they both laughed together like two conspiring children.   
On top of all their horror flicked this little sanity.  
</p><p>Nurse did not come that night to settle Mrs. Morel down.  Paul  
went up with the hot milk in a feeding-cup.  It was nine o'clock.  
</p><p>She was reared up in bed, and he put the feeding-cup between  
her lips that he would have died to save from any hurt.  She took  
a sip, then put the spout of the cup away and looked at him with  
her dark, wondering eyes.  He looked at her.  
</p><p>"Oh, it is bitter, Paul!" she said, making a little grimace.  
</p><p>"It's a new sleeping draught the doctor gave me for you," he  
said.  "He thought it would leave you in such a state in the  
morning."  
</p><p> "And I hope it won't," she said, like a child.  
</p><p> She drank some more of the milk.  
</p><p> "But it is horrid!" she said.  
</p><p>He saw her frail fingers over the cup, her lips making a little  
move.  
</p><p>"I know &mdash; I tasted it," he said.  "But I'll give you some clean  
milk afterwards."  
</p><p>"I think so," she said, and she went on with the draught.  She  
was obedient to him like a child.  He wondered if she knew.  He  
saw her poor wasted throat moving as she drank with difficulty.   
Then he ran downstairs for more milk.  There were no grains in  
the bottom of the cup.  
</p><p> "Has she had it?" whispered Annie.  
</p><p> "Yes &mdash; and she said it was bitter."  
</p><p> "Oh!" laughed Annie, putting her under lip between her teeth.  
</p><p> "And I told her it was a new draught.  Where's that milk?"  
</p><p> They both went upstairs.  
</p><p>"I wonder why nurse didn't come to settle me down?" complained   
the mother, like a child, wistfully.  
</p><p> "She said she was going to a concert, my love,"  replied  Annie.  
</p><p> "Did she?"  
</p><p>They were silent a minute.  Mrs. Morel gulped the little clean  
milk.  
</p><p> "Annie, that draught was horrid!" she said plaintively.  
</p><p> "Was it, my love? Well, never mind."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="410"/>   
  
<p>The mother sighed again with weariness.  Her pulse was very  
irregular.  
</p><p>"Let us settle you down," said Annie.  "Perhaps nurse will be  
so late."  
</p><p>"Ay," said the mother &mdash; "try."  
</p><p>They turned the clothes back.  Paul saw his mother like a girl  
curled up in her flannel nightdress.  Quickly they made one half  
of the bed, moved her, made the other, straightened her nightgown   
over her small feet, and covered her up.  
</p><p>"There," said Paul, stroking her softly.  "There! &mdash; now you'll  
sleep."  
</p><p>"Yes," she said.  "I didn't think you could do the bed so nicely,"  
she added, almost gaily.  Then she curled up, with her cheek on her  
hand, her head snugged between her shoulders.  Paul put the long  
thin plait of grey hair over her shoulder and kissed her.  
</p><p> "You'll sleep, my love," he said.  
</p><p> "Yes," she answered trustfully.  "Good-night."  
</p><p> They put out the light, and it was still.  
</p><p>Morel was in bed.  Nurse did not come.  Annie and Paul came  
to look at her at about eleven.  She seemed to be sleeping as usual  
after her draught.  Her mouth had come a bit open.  
</p><p> "Shall we sit up?" said Paul.  
</p><p> "I s'll lie with her as I always do," said Annie.  "She might wake  
up."  
</p><p> "All right.  And call me if you see any difference."  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p>They lingered before the bedroom fire, feeling the night big  
and black and snowy outside, their two selves alone in the world.   
At last he went into the next room and went to bed.  
</p><p>He slept almost immediately, but kept waking every now and  
again.  Then he went sound asleep.  He started awake at Annie's  
whispered, "Paul, Paul!" He saw his sister in her white nightdress,   
with her long plait of hair down her back, standing in the  
darkness.  
</p><p> "Yes?" he whispered, sitting up.  
</p><p> "Come and look at her."  
</p><p> He slipped out of bed.  A bud of gas was burning in the sick  
chamber.  His mother lay with her cheek on her hand, curled up  
as she had gone to sleep.  But her mouth had fallen open, and she  
  
  
<pb n="411"/>   
breathed with great, hoarse breaths, like snoring, and there were  
long intervals between.  
</p><p> "She's going!" he whispered.  
</p><p> "Yes," said Annie.  
</p><p> "How long has she been like it?"  
</p><p> "I only just woke up."  
</p><p> Annie huddled into the dressing-gown, Paul wrapped himself  
in a brown blanket.  It was three o'clock.  He mended the fire.  Then  
the two sat waiting.  The great, snoring breath was taken &mdash; held  
awhile &mdash; then given back.  There was a space &mdash; a long space.  Then  
they started.  The great, snoring breath was taken again.  He bent  
close down and looked at her.  
</p><p> "Isn't it awful!" whispered Annie.  
</p><p> He nodded.  They sat down again helplessly.  Again came the  
great, snoring breath.  Again they hung suspended.  Again it was  
given back, long and harsh.  The sound, so irregular, at such wide  
intervals, sounded through the house.  Morel, in his room, slept  
on. Paul and Annie sat crouched, huddled, motionless.  The great  
snoring sound began again &mdash; there was a painful pause while the  
breath was held &mdash; back came the rasping breath.  Minute after minute   
passed.  Paul looked at her again, bending low over her.  
</p><p> "She may last like this," he said.  
</p><p>They were both silent.  He looked out of the window, and could  
faintly discern the snow on the garden.  
</p><p> "You go to my bed," he said to Annie.  "I'll sit up."  
</p><p> "No," she said, "I'll stop with you."  
</p><p> "I'd rather you didn't," he said.  
</p><p> At last Annie crept out of the room, and he was alone.  He  
hugged himself in his brown blanket, crouched in front of his  
mother, watching.  She looked dreadful, with the bottom jaw fallen  
back.  He watched.  Sometimes he thought the great breath would  
never begin again.  He could not bear it &mdash; the waiting.  Then suddenly,   
startling him, came the great harsh sound.  He mended  
the fire again, noiselessly.  She must not be disturbed.  The minutes  
went by.  The night was going, breath by breath.  Each time the  
sound came he felt it wring him, till at last he could not feel so  
much.  
</p><p>His father got up.  Paul heard the miner drawing his stockings  
on, yawning.  Then Morel, in shirt and stockings, entered.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="412"/>   
  
<p> "Hush!" said Paul.  
</p><p>Morel stood watching.  Then he looked at his son, helplessly,  
and in horror.  
</p><p> "Had I better stop a-whoam?" he whispered.  
</p><p> "No.  Go to work.  She'll last through to-morrow."  
</p><p> "I don't think so."  
</p><p> "Yes.  Go to work."  
</p><p>The miner looked at her again, in fear, and went obediently  
out of the room.  Paul saw the tape of his garters swinging against  
his legs.  
</p><p>After another half-hour Paul went downstairs and drank a cup  
of tea, then returned.  Morel, dressed for the pit, came upstairs  
again.  
</p><p> "Am I to go?" he said.  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p>And in a few minutes Paul heard his father's heavy steps go  
thudding over the deadening snow.  Miners called in the streets  
as they tramped in gangs to work.  The terrible, long-drawn  
breaths continued &mdash; heave &mdash; heave &mdash; heave; then a long pause &mdash; then  
&mdash; ah-h-h-h-h! as it came back.  Far away over the snow sounded the  
hooters of the ironworks.  One after another they crowed and  
boomed, some small and far away, some near, the blowers of the  
collieries and the other works.  Then there was silence.  He mended  
the fire.  The great breaths broke the silence &mdash; she looked just the  
same.  He put back the blind and peered out.  Still it was dark.  Perhaps   
there was a lighter tinge.  Perhaps the snow was bluer.  He drew  
up the blind and got dressed.  Then, shuddering, he drank brandy  
from the bottle on the wash-stand.  The snow was growing blue.   
He heard a cart clanking down the street.  Yes, it was seven o'clock,  
and it was coming a little bit light.  He heard some people calling.   
The world was waking.  A grey, deathly dawn crept over the snow.   
Yes, he could see the houses.  He put out the gas.  It seemed very  
dark.  The breathing came still, but he was almost used to it.  He  
could see her.  She was just the same.  He wondered if he piled  
heavy clothes on top of her it would stop.  He looked at her.  That  
was not her &mdash; not her a bit.  If he piled the blanket and heavy coats  
on her &mdash;  
</p><p>Suddenly the door opened, and Annie entered.  She looked at  
him questioningly.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="413"/>   
<p> "Just the same," he said calmly.  
</p><p>They whispered together a minute, then he went downstairs to  
get breakfast.  It was twenty to eight.  Soon Annie came down.  
</p><p>"Isn't it awful! Doesn't she look awful!" she whispered, dazed  
with horror.  
</p><p> He nodded.  
</p><p> "If she looks like that!" said Annie.  
</p><p> "Drink some tea," he said.  
</p><p>They went upstairs again.  Soon the neighbours came with their  
frightened question:  
</p><p>"How is she?"  
</p><p>It went on just the same.  She lay with her cheek in her hand,  
her mouth fallen open, and the great, ghastly snores came and  
went.  
</p><p> At ten o'clock nurse came.  She looked strange and woebegone.  
</p><p> "Nurse," cried Paul, "she'll last like this for days?"  
</p><p> "She can't, Mr. Morel," said nurse.  "She can't."  
</p><p> There was a silence.  
</p><p>"Isn't it dreadful!" wailed the nurse.  "Who would have thought  
she could stand it? Go down now, Mr. Morel, go down."  
</p><p>At last, at about eleven o'clock, he went downstairs and sat in  
the neighbour's house.  Annie was downstairs also.  Nurse and  
Arthur were upstairs.  Paul sat with his head in his hand.  Suddenly  
Annie came flying across the yard crying, half mad:  
</p><p>"Paul &mdash; Paul &mdash; she's gone!"  
</p><p>In a second he was back in his own house and upstairs.  She lay  
curled up and still, with her face on her hand, and nurse was wiping   
her mouth.  They all stood back.  He kneeled down, and put  
his face to hers and his arms round her:  
</p><p>"My love &mdash; my love &mdash; oh, my love!" he whispered again and  
again.  "My love &mdash; oh, my love!"  
</p><p> Then he heard the nurse behind him, crying, saying:  
</p><p> "She's better, Mr. Morel, she's better."  
</p><p>When he took his face up from his warm, dead mother he went  
straight downstairs and began blacking his boots.  
</p><p>There was a good deal to do, letters to write, and so on.  The  
doctor came and glanced at her, and sighed.  
</p><p>"Ay &mdash; poor thing!" he said, then turned away.  "Well, call at the  
surgery about six for the certificate."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="414"/>   
  
<p>The father came home from work at about four o'clock.  He  
dragged silently into the house and sat down.  Minnie bustled  
to give him his dinner.  Tired, he laid his black arms on the table.   
There were swede turnips for his dinner, which he liked.  Paul  
wondered if he knew.  It was some time, and nobody had spoken.   
At last the son said:  
</p><p> "You noticed the blinds were down?"  
</p><p> Morel looked up.  
</p><p> "No," he said.  "Why &mdash; has she gone?"  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p> "When wor that?"  
</p><p> "About twelve this morning."  
</p><p> "H'm!"  
</p><p>The miner sat still for a moment, then began his dinner.  It was  
as if nothing had happened.  He ate his turnips in silence.  Afterwards   
he washed and went upstairs to dress.  The door of her room  
was shut.  
</p><p> "Have you seen her?"  Annie asked of him when he came down.  
</p><p> "No," he said.  
</p><p>In a little while he went out.  Annie went away, and Paul called  
on the undertaker, the clergyman, the doctor, the registrar.  It was  
a long business.  He got back at nearly eight o'clock. The undertaker   
was coming soon to measure for the coffin.  The house was  
empty except for her.  He took a candle and went upstairs.  
</p><p>The room was cold, that had been warm for so long.  Flowers,  
bottles, plates, all sick-room litter was taken away; everything  
was harsh and austere.  She lay raised on the bed, the sweep of  
the sheet from the raised feet was like a clean curve of snow, so  
silent.  She lay like a maiden asleep.  With his candle in his hand,  
he bent over her.  She lay like a girl asleep and dreaming of her  
love.  The mouth was a little open as if wondering from the suffering,   
but her face was young, her brow clear and white as if life had  
never touched it.  He looked again at the eyebrows, at the small,  
winsome nose a bit on one side.  She was young again.  Only the  
hair as it arched so beautifully from her temples was mixed with  
silver, and the two simple plaits that lay on her shoulders were  
filigree of silver and brown.  She would wake up.  She would lift  
her eyelids.  She was with him still.  He bent and kissed her   
passionately.  But there was coldness against his mouth.  He bit his  
  
  
<pb n="415"/>   
  
lips with horror.  Looking at her, he felt he could never, never let  
her go.  No! He stroked the hair from her temples.  That, too, was  
cold.  He saw the mouth so dumb and wondering at the hurt.  Then  
he crouched on the floor, whispering to her:  
</p><p>"Mother, mother!"  
</p><p>He was still with her when the undertakers came, young men  
who had been to school with him.  They touched her reverently,  
and in a quiet, businesslike fashion.  They did not look at her.   
He watched jealously.  He and Annie guarded her fiercely.  They  
would not let anybody come to see her, and the neighbours were  
offended.  
</p><p>After a while Paul went out of the house, and played cards at  
a friend's.  It was midnight when he got back.  His father rose from  
the couch as he entered, saying in a plaintive way:  
</p><p> "I thought tha wor niver comin', lad."  
</p><p>"I didn't think you'd sit up," said Paul.  
</p><p>His father looked so forlorn.  Morel had been a man without  
fear &mdash; simply nothing frightened him.  Paul realised with a start  
that he had been afraid to go to bed, alone in the house with his  
dead.  He was sorry.  
</p><p> "I forgot you'd be alone, father," he said.  
</p><p> "Dost want owt to eat?" asked Morel.  
</p><p> "No."  
</p><p>"Sithee &mdash; I made thee a drop o' hot milk.  Get it down thee;  
it's cold enough for owt."  
</p><p>Paul drank it.  
</p><p>After a while Morel went to bed.  He hurried past the closed  
door, and left his own door open.  Soon the son came upstairs also.   
He went in to kiss her good-night, as usual.  It was cold and dark.   
He wished they had kept her fire burning.  Still she dreamed her  
young dream.  But she would be cold.  
</p><p>"My dear!" he whispered.  "My dear!"  
</p><p>And he did not kiss her, for fear she should be cold and strange  
to him.  It eased him she slept so beautifully.  He shut her  
door softly, not to wake her, and went to bed.  
</p><p>In the morning Morel summoned his courage, hearing Annie  
downstairs and Paul coughing in the room across the landing.  He  
opened her door, and went into the darkened room.  He saw the  
white uplifted form in the twilight, but her he dared not see.  Bewildered,  
  
  
<pb n="416"/>   
  
too frightened to possess any of his faculties, he got out  
of the room again and left her.  He never looked at her again.  He  
had not seen her for months, because he had not dared to look.   
And she looked like his young wife again.  
</p><p>"Have you seen her?" Annie asked of him sharply after breakfast.  
</p><p> "Yes," he said.  
</p><p> "And don't you think she looks nice?"  
</p><p> "Yes."  
</p><p>He went out of the house soon after.  And all the time be  
seemed to be creeping aside to avoid it.  
</p><p>Paul went about from place to place, doing the business of the  
death.  He met Clara in Nottingham, and they had tea together in  
a cafe, when they were quite jolly again.  She was infinitely relieved  
to find he did not take it tragically.  
</p><p>Later, when the relatives began to come for the funeral, the  
affair became public, and the children became social beings.  They  
put themselves aside.  They buried her in a furious storm of rain  
and wind.  The wet clay glistened, all the white flowers were soaked.   
Annie gripped his arm and leaned forward.  Down below she saw  
a dark corner of William's coffin.  The oak box sank steadily.  She  
was gone.  The rain poured in the grave.  The procession of black,  
with its umbrellas glistening, turned away.  The cemetery was deserted   
under the drenching cold rain.  
</p><p>Paul went home and busied himself supplying the guests with  
drinks.  His father sat in the kitchen with Mrs. Morel's relatives,  
"superior" people, and wept, and said what a good lass she'd been,  
and how he'd tried to do everything he could for her &mdash; everything.   
He had striven all his life to do what he could for her, and he'd  
nothing to reproach himself with.  She was gone, but he'd done his  
best for her.  He wiped his eyes with his white handkerchief.   
He'd nothing to reproach himself for, he repeated.  All his life  
he'd done his best for her.  
</p><p>And that was how he tried to dismiss her.  He never thought  
of her personally.  Everything deep in him he denied.  Paul hated  
his father for sitting sentimentalising over her.  He knew he would  
do it in the public-houses.  For the real tragedy went on in Morel  
in spite of himself.  Sometimes, later, he came down from his afternoon   
sleep, white and cowering.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="417"/>   
<p> "I have been dreaming of thy mother," he said in a small voice.  
</p><p>"Have you, father? When I dream of her it's always just as she  
was when she was well.  I dream of her often, but it seems quite  
nice and natural, as if nothing had altered."  
</p><p>But Morel crouched in front of the fire in terror.  
</p><p>The weeks passed half-real, not much pain, not much of anything,   
perhaps a little relief, mostly a nuit blanche.  Paul went restless   
from place to place.  For some months, since his mother had  
been worse, he had not made love to Clara.  She was, as it were,  
dumb to him, rather distant.  Dawes saw her very occasionally,  
but the two could not get an inch across the great distance between  
them.  The three of them were drifting forward.  
</p><p>Dawes mended very slowly.  He was in the convalescent home  
at Skegness at Christmas, nearly well again.  Paul went to the seaside   
for a few days.  His father was with Annie in Sheffield.  Dawes  
came to Paul's lodgings.  His time in the home was up.  The two  
men, between whom was such a big reserve, seemed faithful to  
each other.  Dawes depended on Morel now.  He knew Paul and  
Clara had practically separated.  
</p><p> Two days after Christmas Paul was to go back to Nottingham.  
The evening before he sat with Dawes smoking before the fire.  
</p><p> "You know Clara's coming down for the day to-morrow?" he  
said.  
</p><p> The other man glanced at him.  
</p><p> "Yes, you told me," he replied.  
</p><p> Paul drank the remainder of his glass of whisky.  
</p><p> "I told the landlady your wife was coming," he said.  
</p><p> "Did you?" said Dawes, shrinking, but almost leaving himself  
in the other's hands.  He got up rather stiffly, and reached for  
Morel's glass.  
</p><p> "Let me fill you up," he said.  
</p><p>Paul jumped up.  
</p><p> "You sit still," he said.  
</p><p> But Dawes, with rather shaky hand, continued to mix the drink.  
</p><p> "Say when," he said.  
</p><p> "Thanks!" replied the other.  "But you've no business to get up."  
</p><p> "It does me good, lad," replied Dawes.  "I begin to think I'm  
right again, then."  
</p><p> "You are about right, you know."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="418"/>   
  
<p> "I am, certainly I am," said Dawes, nodding to him.  
</p><p> "And Len says he can get you on in Sheffield."  
</p><p>Dawes glanced at him again, with dark eyes that agreed with  
everything the other would say, perhaps a trifle dominated by  
him.  
</p><p>"It's funny," said Paul, "starting again.  I feel in a lot bigger mess  
than you."  
</p><p> "In what way, lad?"  
</p><p>"I don't know.  I don't know.  It's as if I was in a tangled sort  
of hole, rather dark and dreary, and no road anywhere."  
</p><p>"I know &mdash; I understand it," Dawes said, nodding.  "But you'll  
find it'll come all right."  
</p><p> He spoke caressingly.  
</p><p> "I suppose so," said Paul.  
</p><p> Dawes knocked his pipe in a hopeless fashion.  
</p><p> "You've not done for yourself like I have," he said.  
</p><p>Morel saw the wrist and the white hand of the other man gripping   
the stem of the pipe and knocking out the ash, as if he had  
given up.  
</p><p> "How old are you?" Paul asked.  
</p><p> "Thirty-nine," replied Dawes, glancing at him.  
</p><p>Those brown eyes, full of the consciousness of failure, almost  
pleading for reassurance, for someone to re-establish the man in  
himself, to warm him, to set him up firm again, troubled Paul.  
</p><p>"You'll just be in your prime," said Morel.  "You don't look  
as if much life had gone out of you."  
</p><p>The brown eyes of the other flashed suddenly.  
</p><p>"It hasn't," he said.  "The go is there."  
</p><p>Paul looked up and laughed.  
</p><p>"We've both got plenty of life in us yet to make things fly," he said.  
</p><p>The eyes of the two men met.  They exchanged one look.  Having  
recognised the stress of passion each in the other, they both drank  
their whisky.  
</p><p>"Yes, begod!" said Dawes, breathless.  
</p><p>There was a pause.  
</p><p>"And I don't see," said Paul, "why you shouldn't go on where  
you left off."  
</p><p>"What &mdash; " said Dawes, suggestively.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="419"/>   
  
<p>"Yes &mdash; fit your old home together again."  
</p><p>Dawes hid his face and shook his head.  
</p><p>"Couldn't be done," he said, and looked up with an ironic smile.  
</p><p>"Why? Because you don't want?"  
</p><p>"Perhaps."  
</p><p>They smoked in silence.  Dawes showed his teeth as he bit his  
pipe stem.  
</p><p>"You mean you don't want her?" asked Paul.  
</p><p>Dawes stared up at the picture with a caustic expression on  
his face.  
</p><p>"I hardly know," he said.  
</p><p>The smoke floated softly up.  
</p><p>"I believe she wants you," said Paul.  
</p><p>"Do you?" replied the other, soft, satirical, abstract.  
</p><p>"Yes.  She never really hitched on to me &mdash; you were always there  
in the background.  That's why she wouldn't get a divorce."  
</p><p>Dawes continued to stare in a satirical fashion at the picture  
over the mantelpiece.  
</p><p>"That's how women are with me," said Paul.  "They want me  
like mad, but they don't want to belong to me.  And she belonged  
to you all the time.  I knew."  
</p><p>The triumphant male came up in Dawes.  He showed his teeth  
more distinctly.  
</p><p>"Perhaps I was a fool," he said.  
</p><p>"You were a big fool," said Morel.  
</p><p>"But perhaps even then you were a bigger fool," said Dawes.  
</p><p>There was a touch of triumph and malice in it.  
</p><p>"Do you think so?" said Paul.  
</p><p>They were silent for some time.  
</p><p>"At any rate, I'm clearing out to-morrow," said Morel.  
</p><p>"I see," answered Dawes.  
</p><p>Then they did not talk any more.  The instinct to murder each  
other had returned.  They almost avoided each other.  
</p><p>They shared the same bedroom.  When they retired Dawes  
seemed abstract, thinking of something.  He sat on the side of the  
bed in his shirt, looking at his legs.  
</p><p>"Aren't you getting cold?" asked Morel.  
</p><p>"I was lookin' at these legs," replied the other.</p>  
  
<pb n="420"/>   
  
<p>"What's up with 'em? They look all right," replied Paul, from  
his bed.  
</p><p>"They look all right.  But there's some water in 'em yet."  
</p><p>"And what about it?"  
</p><p>"Come and look."  
</p><p>Paul reluctantly got out of bed and went to look at the rather  
handsome legs of the other man that were covered with glistening,   
dark gold hair.  
</p><p>"Look here," said Dawes, pointing to his shin.  "Look at the  
water under here."  
</p><p>"Where?" said Paul.  
</p><p>The man pressed in his finger-tips.  They left little dents that  
filled up slowly.  
</p><p>"It's nothing," said Paul.  
</p><p>"You feel," said Dawes.  
</p><p>Paul tried with his fingers.  It made little dents.  
</p><p>"H'm!" he said.  
</p><p>"Rotten, isn't it?" said Dawes.  
</p><p>"Why? It's nothing much."  
</p><p>"You're not much of a man with water in your legs."  
</p><p>"I can't see as it makes any difference," said Morel.  "I've got a  
weak chest."  
</p><p>He returned to his own bed.  
</p><p>"I suppose the rest of me's all right," said Dawes, and he put  
out the light.  
</p><p>In the morning it was raining.  Morel packed his bag.  The sea  
was grey and shaggy and dismal.  He seemed to be cutting himself  
off from life more and more.  It gave him a wicked pleasure to do it.  
</p><p>The two men were at the station.  Clara stepped out of the train,  
and came along the platform, very erect and coldly composed.  She  
wore a long coat and a tweed hat.  Both men hated her for her  
composure.  Paul shook hands with her at the barrier.  Dawes was  
leaning against the bookstall, watching.  His black overcoat was  
buttoned up to the chin because of the rain.  He was pale, with  
almost a touch of nobility in his quietness.  He came forward, limping   
slightly.  
</p><p>"You ought to look better than this," she said.  
</p><p>"Oh, I'm all right now."</p>  
  
  
<pb n="421"/>   
<p>The three stood at a loss.  She kept the two men hesitating near  
her.  
</p><p>"Shall we go to the lodging straight off,"  
said Paul, "or somewhere else?"  
</p><p>"We may as well go home," said Dawes.  
</p><p>Paul walked on the outside of the pavement, then Dawes, then  
Clara.  They made polite conversation.  The sitting-room faced the  
sea, whose tide, grey and shaggy, hissed not far off.  
</p><p>Morel swung up the big arm-chair.  
</p><p>"Sit down, Jack," he said.  
</p><p>"I don't want that chair," said Dawes.  
</p><p>"Sit down!" Morel repeated.  
</p><p>Clara took off her things and laid them on the couch.  She had  
a slight air of resentment.  Lifting her hair with her fingers, she  
sat down, rather aloof and composed.  Paul ran downstairs to speak  
to the landlady.  
</p><p>"I should think you're cold," said Dawes to his wife.  "Come  
nearer to the fire."  
</p><p>"Thank you, I'm quite warm," she answered.  
</p><p>She looked out of the window at the rain and at the sea.  
</p><p>"When are you going back?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Well, the rooms are taken until to-morrow, so he wants me  
to stop.  He's going back to-night."  
</p><p>"And then you're thinking of going to Sheffield?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>"Are you fit to start work?"  
</p><p>"I'm going to start."  
</p><p>"You've really got a place?"  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; begin on Monday."  
</p><p>"You don't look fit."  
</p><p>"Why don't I?"  
</p><p>She looked again out of the window instead of answering.  
</p><p>"And have you got lodgings in Sheffield?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>Again she looked away out of the window.  The panes were  
blurred with streaming rain.  
</p><p>"And can you manage all right?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I s'd think so.  I s'll have to!"  
</p><p>They were silent when Morel returned.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="422"/>   
  
<p>"I shall go by the four-twenty," he said as he entered.  
</p><p>Nobody answered.  
</p><p>"I wish you'd take your boots off," he said to Clara.  
</p><p>"There's a pair of slippers of mine."  
</p><p>"Thank you," she said.  "They aren't wet."  
</p><p>He put the slippers near her feet.  She left them there.  
</p><p>Morel sat down.  Both the men seemed helpless, and each of  
them had a rather hunted look.  But Dawes now carried himself  
quietly, seemed to yield himself, while Paul seemed to screw  
himself up.  Clara thought she had never seen him look so small  
and mean.  He was as if trying to get himself into the smallest possible   
compass.  And as he went about arranging, and as he sat talking,   
there seemed something false about him and out of tune.   
Watching him unknown, she said to herself there was no stabuity  
about him.  He was fine in his way, passionate, and able to give  
her drinks of pure life when he was in one mood.  And now he  
looked paltry and insignificant.  There was nothing stable about  
him.  Her husband had more manly dignity.  At any rate he did  
not waft about with any wind.  There was something evanescent  
about Morel, she thought, something shifting and false.  He would  
never make sure ground for any woman to stand on.  She despised  
him rather for his shrinking together, getting smaller.  Her husband  
at least was manly, and when he was beaten gave in.  But this  
other would never own to being beaten.  He would shift round  
and round, prowl, get smaller.  She despised him.  And yet she  
watched him rather than Dawes, and it seemed as if their three  
fates lay in his hands.  She hated him for it.  
</p><p>She seemed to understand better now about men, and what  
they could or would do.  She was less afraid of them, more sure  
of herself.  That they were not the small egoists she had imagined  
them made her more comfortable.  She had learned a good deal &mdash;  
almost as much as she wanted to leam.  Her cup had been full.  It  
was still as full as she could carry.  On the whole, she would not  
be sorry when he was gone.  
</p><p>They had dinner, and sat eating nuts and drinking by the fire.   
Not a serious word had been spoken.  Yet Clara realised that  
Morel was withdrawing from the circle, leaving her the option to  
stay with her husband.  It angered her.  He was a mean fellow,  
after all, to take what he wanted and then give her back.  She did  
  
  
<pb n="423"/>   
not remember that she herself had had what she wanted, and really,  
at the bottom of her heart, wished to be given back.  
</p><p>Paul felt crumpled up and lonely.  His mother had really   
supported his life.  He had loved her; they two had, in fact, faced the  
world together.  Now she was gone, and for ever behind him was  
the gap in life, the tear in the veil, through which his life seemed  
to drift slowly, as if he were drawn towards death.  He wanted  
someone of their own free initiative to help him.  The lesser things  
he began to let go from him, for fear of this big thing, the lapse  
towards death, following in the wake of his beloved. Clara could  
not stand for him to hold on to.  She wanted him, but not to understand   
him.  He felt she wanted the man on top, not the real him  
that was in trouble.  That would be too much trouble to her; he  
dared not give it her.  She could not cope with him.  It made him  
ashamed.  So, secretly ashamed because he was in such a mess,  
because his own hold on life was so unsure, because nobody held  
him, feeling unsubstantial, shadowy, as if he did not count for  
much in this concrete world, he drew himself together smaller  
and smaller.  He did not want to die; he would not give in.  But he  
was not afraid of death.  If nobody would help, he would go on  
alone.  
</p><p>Dawes had been driven to the extremity of life, until he was  
afraid.  He could go to the brink of death, he could lie on the edge  
and look in.  Then, cowed, afraid, he had to crawl back, and like a  
beggar take what offered.  There was a certain nobility in it.  As  
Clara saw, he owned himself beaten, and he wanted to be taken  
back whether or not.  That she could do for him.  
It was three o'clock.  
</p><p>"I am going by the four-twenty," said Paul again to Clara.  "Are  
you coming then or later?"  
</p><p>"I don't know," she said.  
</p><p>"I'm meeting my father in Nottingham at seven-fifteen," he  
said.  
</p><p>"Then," she answered, "I'll come later."  
</p><p>Dawes jerked suddenly, as if he had been held on a strain.  He  
looked out over the sea, but he saw nothing.  
</p><p>"There are one or two books in the corner," said Morel.  "I've  
done with 'em."  
</p><p>At about four o'clock he went.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="424"/>   
  
<p>"I shall see you both later," he said, as he shook hands.  
</p><p>"I suppose so," said Dawes.  "An' perhaps &mdash; one day &mdash; I s'll be  
able to pay you back the money as &mdash; "  
</p><p>"I shall come for it, you'll see," laughed Paul.  "I s'll be on the  
rocks before I'm very much older."  
</p><p>"Ay &mdash; well &mdash; " said Dawes.  
</p><p>"Good-bye," he said to Clara.  
</p><p>"Good-bye," she said, giving him her hand.  Then she glanced  
at him for the last time, dumb and humble.  
</p><p>He was gone.  Dawes and his wife sat down again.  
</p><p>"It's a nasty day for travelling," said the man.  
</p><p>"Yes," she answered.  
</p><p>They talked in a desultory fashion until it grew dark.  The   
landlady brought in the tea.  Dawes drew up his chair to the table   
without being invited, like a husband.  Then he sat humbly waiting for  
his cup.  She served him as she would, like a wife, not consulting  
his wish.  
</p><p>After tea, as it drew near to six o'clock, he went to the window.   
All was dark outside.  The sea was roaring.  
</p><p>"It's raining yet," he said.  
</p><p>"Is it?" she answered.  
</p><p>"You won't go to-night, shall you?" he said, hesitating.  
</p><p>She did not answer.  He waited.  
</p><p>"I shouldn't go in this rain," he said.  
</p><p>"Do you want me to stay?" she asked.  
</p><p>His hand as he held the dark curtain trembled.  
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  
</p><p>He remained with his back to her.  She rose and went slowly  
to him.  He let go the curtain, turned, hesitating, towards her.  She  
stood with her hands behind her back, looking up at him in a  
heavy, inscrutable fashion.  
</p><p>"Do you want me, Baxter?" she asked.  
</p><p>His voice was hoarse as he answered:  
</p><p>"Do you want to come back to me?"  
</p><p>She made a moaning noise, lifted her arms, and put them round  
his neck, drawing him to her.  He hid his face on her shoulder,  
holding her clasped.  
</p><p>"Take me back!" she whispered, ecstatic.  "Take me back, take  
  
  
<pb n="425"/>   
  
me back!" And she put her fingers through his fine, thin dark  
hair, as if she were only semi-conscious.  He tightened his grasp  
on her.  
</p><p>"Do you want me again?" he murmured, broken.</p>

<p>CLARA went with her husband to Sheffield, and Paul scarcely saw  
her again.  Walter Morel seemed to have let all the trouble go over  
him, and there he was, crawling about on the mud of it, just the  
same.  There was scarcely any bond between father and son, save  
that each felt he must not let the other go in any actual want.  As  
there was no one to keep on the home, and as they could neither  
of them bear the emptiness of the house, Paul took lodgings in  
Nottingham, and Morel went to live with a friendly family in Bestwood.  
</p><p>Everything seemed to have gone smash for the young man.  He  
could not paint.  The picture he finished on the day of his mother's  
death &mdash; one that satisfied him &mdash; was the last thing he did.  At work  
there was no Clara.  When he came home he could not take up his  
brushes again.  There was nothing left.  
</p><p>So he was always in the town at one place or another, drinking,   
knocking about with the men he knew.  It really wearied him.   
He talked to barmaids, to almost any woman, but there was that  
dark, strained look in his eyes, as if he were hunting something.  
</p><p>Everything seemed so different, so unreal.  There seemed no  
reason why people should go along the street, and houses pile  
up in the daylight.  There seemed no reason why these things  
should occupy the space, instead of leaving it empty.  His friends  
talked to him: he heard the sounds, and he answered.  But  
why there should be the noise of speech he could not understand.  
</p><p>He was most himself when he was alone, or working hard and  
mechanically at the factory.  In the latter case there was pure   
forgetfulness, when he lapsed from consciousness.  But it had to come  
to an end.  It hurt him so, that things had lost their reality.  The  
first snowdrops came.  He saw the tiny drop-pearls among the  
  
  
<pb n="426"/>   
  
grey.  They would have given him the liveliest emotion at one  
time.  Now they were there, but they did not seem to mean anything.    
In a few moments they would cease to occupy that place,  
and just the space would be, where they had been.  Tall, brilliant  
tram-cars ran along the street at night.  It seemed almost a wonder  
they should trouble to rustle backwards and forwards.  "Why trouble   
to go tilting down to Trent Bridges?" he asked of the big trams.   
It seemed they just as well might not be as be.  
</p><p>The realest thing was the thick darkness at night.  That seemed  
to him whole and comprehensible and restful.  He could leave  
himself to it.  Suddenly a piece of paper started near his feet and  
blew along down the pavement.  He stood still, rigid, with  
clenched fists, a flame of agony going over him.  And he saw again  
the sick-room, his mother, her eyes.  Unconsciously he had been  
with her, in her company.  The swift hop of the paper reminded  
him she was gone.  But he had been with her.  He wanted everything   
to stand still, so that he could be with her again.  
</p><p>The days passed, the weeks.  But everything seemed to have  
fused, gone into a conglomerated mass.  He could not tell one day  
from another, one week from another, hardly one place from  
another.  Nothing was distinct or distinguishable.  Often he lost  
himself for an hour at a time, could not remember what he had  
done.  
</p><p>One evening he came home late to his lodging.  The fire was  
burning low; everybody was in bed.  He threw on some more coal,  
glanced at the table, and decided he wanted no supper.  Then he  
sat down in the arm-chair.  It was perfectly still.  He did not know  
anything, yet he saw the dim smoke wavering up the chimney.   
Presently two mice came out, cautiously, nibbling the fallen  
crumbs.  He watched them as it were from a long way off.  The  
church clock struck two.  Far away he could hear the sharp clinking  
of the trucks on the railway.  No, it was not they that were far away.   
They were there in their places.  But where was he himself?  
</p><p>The time passed.  The two mice, careering wildly, scampered  
cheekily over his slippers.  He had not moved a muscle.  He did  
not want to move.  He was not thinking of anything.  It was easier  
so. There was no wrench of knowing anything.  Then, from time  
to time, some other consciousness, working mechanically, flashed  
into sharp phrases.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="427"/>   
<p>"What am I doing?"  
</p><p>And out of the semi-intoxicated trance came the answer:  
</p><p>"Destroying myself."  
</p><p>Then a dull, live feeling, gone in an instant, told him that it was  
wrong.  After a while, suddenly came the question:  
</p><p>"Why wrong?"  
</p><p>Again there was no answer, but a stroke of hot stubbornness  
inside his chest resisted his own annihilation.  
</p><p>There was a sound of a heavy cart clanking down the road.   
Suddenly the electric light went out; there was a bruising thud  
in the penny-in-the-slot meter.  He did not stir, but sat gazing in  
front of him.  Only the mice had scuttled, and the fire glowed red  
in the dark room.  
</p><p>Then, quite mechanically and more distinctly, the conversation  
began again inside him.  
</p><p>"She's dead.  What was it all for &mdash; her struggle?"  
</p><p>That was his despair wanting to go after her.  
</p><p>"You're alive."  
</p><p>"She's not."  
</p><p>"She is &mdash; in you."  
</p><p>Suddenly he felt tired with the burden of it.  
</p><p>"You've got to keep alive for her sake," said his will in him.  
</p><p>Something felt sulky, as if it would not rouse.  
</p><p>"You've got to carry forward her living, and what she had done,  
go on with it."  
</p><p>But he did not want to.  He wanted to give up.  
</p><p>"But you can go on with your painting," said the will in him.  
"Or else you can beget children.  They both carry on her effort."  
</p><p>"Painting is not living."  
</p><p>"Then live."  
</p><p>"Marry whom?" came the sulky question.  
</p><p>"As best you can."  
</p><p>"Miriam?"  
</p><p>But he did not trust that.  
</p><p>He rose suddenly, went straight to bed.  When he got inside  
his bedroom and closed the door, he stood with clenched fist.  
</p><p>"Mater, my dear &mdash; " he began, with the whole force of his  
soul.  Then he stopped.  He would not say it.  He would not admit  
that he wanted to die, to have done.  He would not own that life  
  
  
<pb n="428"/>   
  
had beaten him, or that death bad beaten him.  Going straight to  
bed, he slept at once, abandoning himself to the sleep.  
</p><p>So the weeks went on.  Always alone, his soul oscillated, first  
on the side of death, then on the side of life, doggedly.  The real  
agony was that he had nowhere to go, nothing to do, nothing to  
say, and was nothing himself.  Sometimes he ran down the streets  
as if he were mad: sometimes he was mad; things weren't there,  
things were there.  It made him pant.  Sometimes he stood before  
the bar of the public-house where he called for a drink.  Everything   
suddenly stood back away from him.  He saw the face of the  
barmaid, the gobbling drinkers, his own glass on the slopped,  
mahogany board, in the distance.  There was something between  
him and them.  He could not get into touch.  He did not want them;  
he did not want his drink.  Turning abruptly, he went out.  On  
the threshold he stood and looked at the lighted street.  But he was  
not of it or in it.  Something separated him.  Everything went on  
there below those lamps, shut away from him.  He could not get  
at them.  He felt he couldn't touch the lamp-posts, not if he reached.   
Where could he go? There was nowhere to go, neither back into  
the inn, or forward anywhere.  He felt stifled.  There was nowhere  
for him.  The stress grew inside him; he felt he should smash.  
</p><p>"I mustn't," he said; and, turning blindly, he went in and drank.   
Sometimes the drink did him good; sometimes it made him worse.   
He ran down the road.  For ever restless, he went here, there,   
everywhere.  He determined to work.  But when he had made six strokes,  
he loathed the pencil violently, got up, and went away, hurried  
off to a club where he could play cards or billiards, to a place where  
he could flirt with a barmaid who was no more to him than the  
brass pump-handle she drew.  
</p><p>He was very thin and lantern-jawed.  He dared not meet his  
own eyes in the mirror; he never looked at himself.  He wanted  
to get away from himself, but there was nothing to get hold of.   
In despair he thought of Miriam.  Perhaps &mdash; perhaps &mdash; ?  
</p><p>Then, happening to go into the Unitarian Church one Sunday  
evening, when they stood up to sing the second hymn he saw  
her before him.  The light glistened on her lower lip as she sang.   
She looked as if she had got something, at any rate: some hope  
in heaven, if not in earth.  Her comfort and her life seemed in the  
after-world.  A warm, strong feeling for her came up.  She seemed  
  
  
<pb n="429"/>   
to yearn, as she sang, for the mystery and comfort.  He put his  
hope in her.  He longed for the sermon to be over, to speak to her.  
</p><p>The throng carried her out just before him.  He could nearly  
touch her.  She did not know he was there.  He saw the brown,  
humble nape of her neck under its black curls.  He would leave  
himself to her.  She was better and bigger than he.  He would depend  
on her.  
</p><p>She went wandering, in her blind way, through the little throngs  
of people outside the church.  She always looked so lost and out  
of place among people.  He went forward and put his hand on her  
arm.  She started violently.  Her great brown eyes dilated in fear,  
then went questioning at the sight of him.  He shrank slightly from  
her.  
</p><p>"I didn't know &mdash; " she faltered.  
</p><p>"Nor I," he said.  
</p><p>He looked away.  His sudden, flaring hope sank again.  
</p><p>"What are you doing in town?" he asked.  
</p><p>"I'm staying at Cousin Anne's."  
</p><p>"Ha! For long?"  
</p><p>"No; only till to-morrow."  
</p><p>"Must you go straight home?"  
</p><p>She looked at him, then hid her face under her hat-brim.  
</p><p>"No," she said &mdash; "no; it's not necessary."  
</p><p>He turned away, and she went with him.  They threaded through  
the throng of church people.  The organ was still sounding in St.  
Mary's.  Dark figures came through the lighted doors; people were  
coming down the steps.  The large coloured windows glowed up in  
the night.  The church was like a great lantern suspended.  They  
went down Hollow Stone, and he took the car for the Bridges.  
</p><p>"You will just have supper with me," he said: "then I'll  
bring you back."  
</p><p>"Very well," she replied, low and husky.  
</p><p>They scarcely spoke while they were on the car.  The Trent ran  
dark and full under the bridge.  Away towards Colwick all was  
black night.  He lived down Holme Road, on the naked edge of  
the town, facing across the river meadows towards Sneinton  
Hermitage and the steep scarp of Colwick Wood.  The floods were  
out.  The silent water and the darkness spread away on their left  
Almost afraid, they hurried along by the houses.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="430"/>   
  
<p>Supper was laid.  He swung the curtain over the window.  There  
was a bowl of freesias and scarlet anemones on the table.  She bent  
to them.  Still touching them with her finger-tips, she looked up at  
him, saying:  
</p><p>"Aren't they beautiful?"  
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  "What will you drink &mdash; coffee?"  
</p><p>"I should like it," she said.  
</p><p>"Then excuse me a moment."  
</p><p>He went out to the kitchen.  
</p><p>Miriam took off her things and looked round.  It was a bare,  
severe room.  Her photo, Clara's, Annie's, were on the wall.  She  
looked on the drawing-board to see what he was doing.  There  
were only a few meaningless lines.  She looked to see what books  
he was reading.  Evidently just an ordinary novel.  The letters in  
the rack she saw were from Annie, Arthur, and from some man  
or other she did not know.  Everything he had touched, everything  
that was in the least personal to him, she examined with lingering  
absorption.  He had been gone from her for so long, she wanted  
to rediscover him, his position, what he was now.  But there was  
not much in the room to help her.  It only made her feel rather sad,  
it was so hard and comfortless.  
</p><p>She was curiously examining a sketch-book when he returned  
with the coffee.  
</p><p>"There's nothing new in it," he said, "and nothing very interesting."  
</p><p>He put down the tray, and went to look over her shoulder.  She  
tumed the pages slowly, intent on examining everything.  
</p><p>"H'm!" he said, as she paused at a sketch.  "I'd forgotten that.   
It's not bad, is it?"  
</p><p>"No," she said.  "I don't quite understand it."  
</p><p>He took the book from her and went through it.  Again he made a  
curious sound of surprise and pleasure.  
</p><p>"There's some not bad stuff in there," he said.  
</p><p>"Not at all bad," she answered gravely.  
</p><p>He felt again her interest in his work.  Or was it for himself?  
Why was she always most interested in him as he appeared in his  
work?  
</p><p>They sat down to supper.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="431"/>   
<p>"By the way," he said, "didn't I hear something about your  
earning your own living?"  
</p><p>"Yes," she replied, bowing her dark head over her cup.  
"And what of it?"  
</p><p>"I'm merely going to the farming college at Broughton for three  
months, and I shall probably be kept on as a teacher there."  
</p><p>"I say &mdash; that sounds all right for you! You always wanted to be  
independent."  
</p><p>"Yes.  
</p><p>"Why didn't you tell me?"  
</p><p>"I only knew last week."  
</p><p>"But I heard a month ago," he said.  
</p><p>"Yes; but nothing was settled then."  
</p><p>"I should have thought," he said, "you'd have told me you were  
trying."  
</p><p>She ate her food in the deliberate, constrained way, almost as if  
she recoiled a little from doing anything so publicly, that he knew  
so well.  
</p><p>"I suppose you're glad," he said.  
</p><p>"Very glad."  
</p><p>"Yes &mdash; it will be something."  
</p><p>He was rather disappointed.  
</p><p>"I think it will be a great deal," she said, almost haughtily,   
resentfully.  
</p><p>He laughed shortly.  
</p><p>"Why do you think it won't?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Oh, I don't think it won't be a great deal.  Only you'll find   
earning your own living isn't everything."  
</p><p>"No," she said, swallowing with difficulty; "I don't suppose it  
is."  
</p><p>"I suppose work can be nearly everything to a man," he said,  
though it isn't to me.  But a woman only works with a part of herself.    
The real and vital part is covered up."  
</p><p>"But a man can give all himself to work?" she asked.  
</p><p>"Yes, practically."  
</p><p>"And a woman only the unimportant part of herself?"  
</p><p>"That's it."  
</p><p>She looked up at him, and her eyes dilated with anger.</p>  
  
<pb n="432"/>   
  
<p>"Then," she said, "if it's true, it's a great shame."  
</p><p>"It is.  But I don't know everything," he answered.  
</p><p>After supper they drew up to the fire.  He swung her a chair facing   
him, and they sat down.  She was wearing a dress of dark claret  
colour, that suited her dark complexion and her large features.   
Still, the curls were fine and free, but her face was much older, the  
brown throat much thinner.  She seemed old to him, older than  
Clara.  Her bloom of youth had quickly gone.  A sort of stiffness, almost   
of woodenness, had come upon her.  She meditated a little  
while, then looked at him.  
</p><p>"And how are things with you?" she asked.  
</p><p>"About all right," he answered.  
</p><p>She looked at him, waiting.  
</p><p>"Nay," she said, very low.  
</p><p>Her brown, nervous hands were clasped over her knee.  They  
had still the lack of confidence or repose, the almost hysterical  
look.  He winced as he saw them.  Then he laughed mirthlessly.  She  
put her fingers between her lips.  His slim, black, tortured body lay  
quite still in the chair.  She suddenly took her finger from her mouth  
and looked at him.  
</p><p>"And you have broken off with Clara?"  
</p><p>"Yes."  
</p><p>His body lay like an abandoned thing, strewn in the chair.   
</p><p>"You know," she said, "I think we ought to be married."  
</p><p>He opened his eyes for the first time since many months, and   
attended to her with respect.  
</p><p>"Why?" he said.  
</p><p>"See," she said, "how you waste yourself! You might be ill, you  
might die, and I never know &mdash; be no more then than if I had never  
known you."  
</p><p>"And if we married?" he asked.  
</p><p>"At any rate, I could prevent you wasting yourself and being a  
prey to other women &mdash; like &mdash; like Clara."  
</p><p>"A prey?" he repeated, smiling.  
</p><p>She bowed her head in silence.  He lay feeling his despair come  
up again.  
</p><p>"I'm not sure," he said slowly, "that marriage would be much  
good."  
</p><p>"I only think of you," she replied.</p>  
  
<pb n="433"/>   
<p>"I know you do.  But &mdash; you love me so much, you want to put me  
in your pocket.  And I should die there smothered."  
</p><p>She bent her head, put her fingers between her lips, while the  
bitterness surged up in her heart.  
</p><p>"And what will you do otherwise?" she asked.  
</p><p>"I don't know &mdash; go on, I suppose.  Perhaps I shall soon go  
abroad."  
</p><p>The despairing doggedness in his tone made her go on her  
knees on the rug before the fire, very near to him.  There she  
crouched as if she were crushed by something, and could not raise  
her head.  His hands lay quite inert on the arms of his chair.  She  
was aware of them.  She felt that now he lay at her mercy.  If she  
could rise, take him, put her arms round him, and say, "You are  
mine," then he would leave himself to her.  But dare she? She  
could easily sacrifice herself.  But dare she assert herself? She was  
aware of his dark-clothed, slender body, that seemed one stroke of  
life, sprawled in the chair close to her.  But no; she dared not put  
her arms round it, take it up, and say, "It is mine, this body.  Leave  
it to me." And she wanted to.  It called to all her woman's instinct.   
But she crouched, and dared not.  She was afraid he would not let  
her.  She was afraid it was too much.  It lay there, his body, abandoned.    
She knew she ought to take it up and claim it, and claim  
every right to it.  But &mdash; could she do it? Her impotence before him,  
before the strong demand of some unknown thing in him, was her  
extremity.  Her hands fluttered; she half-lifted her head.  Her eyes,  
shuddering, appealing, gone, almost distracted, pleaded to him  
suddenly.  His heart caught with pity.  He took her hands, drew  
her to him, and comforted her.  
</p><p>"Will you have me, to marry me?" he said very low.  
</p><p>Oh, why did not he take her? Her very soul belonged to him.   
Why would he not take what was his? She had home so long the  
cruelty of belonging to him and not being claimed by him.  Now he  
was straining her again.  It was too much for her.  She drew back her  
head, held his face between her hands, and looked him in the eyes.   
No, he was hard.  He wanted something else.  She pleaded to him  
with all her love not to make it her choice.  She could not cope with  
it, with him, she knew not with what.  But it strained her till she felt  
she would break.  
</p><p>"Do you want it?" she asked, very gravely.</p>  
  
  
<pb n="434"/>   
  
<p>"Not much," he replied, with pain.  
</p><p>She turned her face aside; then, raising herself with dignity, she  
took his head to her bosom, and rocked him softly.  She was not to  
have him, then! So she could comfort him.  She put her fingers  
through his hair.  For her, the anguished sweetness of self-sacrifice.   
For him, the hate and misery of another failure.  He could not bear  
it &mdash; that breast which was warm and which cradled him without  
taking the burden of him.  So much he wanted to rest on her that  
the feint of rest only tortured him.  He drew away.  
</p><p>"And without marriage we can do nothing?" he asked.  
</p><p>His mouth was lifted from his teeth with pain.  She put her little  
finger between her lips.  
</p><p>"No," she said, low and like the toll of a bell.  "No, I think not."  
</p><p>It was the end then between them.  She could not take him and  
relieve him of the responsibility of himself.  She could only sacrifice   
herself to him &mdash; sacrifice herself every day, gladly.  And that he  
did not want.  He wanted her to hold him and say, with joy  
and authority: "Stop all this restlessness and beating against death.   
You are mine for a mate." She had not the strength.  Or was it a  
mate she wanted? or did she want a Christ in him?  
</p><p>He felt, in leaving her, he was defrauding her of life.  But he knew  
that, in staying, stilling the inner, desperate man, he was denying  
his own life.  And he did not hope to give life to her by denying his  
own.  
</p><p>She sat very quiet.  He lit a cigarette.  The smoke went up from  
it, wavering.  He was thinking of his mother, and had forgotten  
Miriam.  She suddenly looked at him.  Her bitterness came surging  
up. Her sacrifice, then, was useless.  He lay there aloof, careless  
about her.  Suddenly she saw again his lack of religion, his restless   
instability.  He would destroy himself like a perverse child.   
Well, then, he would!  
</p><p>"I think I must go," she said softly.  
</p><p>By her tone he knew she was despising him.  He rose quietly.  
</p><p>"I'll come along with you," he answered.  
</p><p>She stood before the mirror pinning on her hat.  How bitter,  
how unutterably bitter, it made her that he rejected her sacrifice!  
Life ahead looked dead, as if the glow were gone out.  She bowed  
her face over the flowers &mdash; the freesias so sweet and spring-like, the  
  
  
<pb n="435"/>   
scarlet anemones flaunting over the table.  It was like him to have  
those flowers.  
</p><p>He moved about the room with a certain sureness of touch,  
swift and relentless and quiet.  She knew she could not cope with  
him.  He would escape like a weasel out of her hands.  Yet without  
him her life would trail on lifeless.  Brooding, she touched the  
flowers.  
</p><p>"Have them!" he said; and he took them out of the jar, dripping  
as they were, and went quickly into the kitchen. She waited for  
him, took the flowers, and they went out together, he talking, she  
feeling dead.  
</p><p>She was going from him now.  In her misery she leaned against  
him as they sat on the car.  He was unresponsive.  Where would he  
go? What would be the end of him? She could not bear it, the  
vacant feeling where he should be.  He was so foolish, so wasteful,  
never at peace with himself.  And now where would he go? And  
what did he care that he wasted her? He had no religion; it was all  
for the moment's attraction that he cared, nothing else, nothing  
deeper.  Well, she would wait and see how it turned out with him.   
When he had had enough he would give in and come to her.  
</p><p>He shook hands and left her at the door of her cousin's house.   
When he tumed away he felt the last hold for him had gone.  The  
town, as he sat upon the car, stretched away over the bay of railway,   
a level fume of lights.  Beyond the town the country, little  
smouldering spots for more towns &mdash; the sea &mdash; the night &mdash; on and on!  
And he had no place in it! Whatever spot he stood on, there he  
stood alone.  From his breast, from his mouth, sprang the endless  
space, and it was there behind him, everywhere.  The people hurrying   
along the streets offered no obstruction to the void in which  
he found himself.  They were small shadows whose footsteps and  
voices could be heard, but in each of them the same night, the  
same silence.  He got off the car.  In the country all was dead still.   
Little stars shone high up; little stars spread far away in the flood-waters, a firmament below.  Everywhere the vastness and terror of  
the immense night which is roused and stirred for a brief while  
by the day, but which returns, and will remain at last eternal, holding   
everything in its silence and its living gloom.  There was no  
Time, only Space.  Who could say his mother had lived and did not  
live? She had been in one place, and was in another; that was all.  
  
  
<pb n="436"/>   
  
And his soul could not leave her, wherever she was.  Now she was  
gone abroad into the night, and he was with her still.  They were  
together.  But yet there was his body, his chest, that leaned against  
the stile, his hands on the wooden bar.  They seemed something.   
Where was he? &mdash; one tiny upright speck of flesh, less than an ear of  
wheat lost in the field.  He could not bear it.  On every side the immense   
dark silence seemed pressing him, so tiny a spark, into extinction,   
and yet, almost nothing, he could not be extinct.  Night,  
in which everything was lost, went reaching out, beyond stars and  
sun.  Stars and sun, a few bright grains, went spinning round for  
terror, and holding each other in embrace, there in a darkness that  
outpassed them all, and left them tiny and daunted.  So much, and  
himself, infinitesimal, at the core a nothingness, and yet not  
nothing.  
</p><p>"Mother!" he whispered &mdash; "mother!"  
</p><p>She was the only thing that held him up, himself, amid all this.   
And she was gone, intermingled herself.  He wanted her to touch  
him, have him alongside with her.  
</p><p>But no, he would not give in.  Turning sharply, he walked towards   
the city's gold phosphorescence.  His fists were shut, his  
mouth set fast.  He would not take that direction, to the darkness, to  
follow her.  He walked towards the faintly humming, glowing  
town, quickly.
