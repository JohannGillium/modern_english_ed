RIGHT HONORABLE,<lb/>
</head>

<p>I KNOW not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to
your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so
strong a prop to support so weak a burden only, if your honour seem
but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take
advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver
labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall
be sorry it had so noble a god-father, and never after ear so barren a
land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest.  I leave it to your
honourable survey, and your honour to your heart's content; which I
wish may always answer your own wish and the world's hopeful
expectation.</p>

<head>Venus and Adonis</head>

<lg type="poem">
<l>EVEN as the sun with purple-colour'd face</l>
<l>Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,</l>
<l>Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;</l>
<l>Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;</l>
<l>Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,</l>
<l>And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,</l>
<l>The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,</l>
<l>Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,</l>
<l>More white and red than doves or roses are;</l>
<l>Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,</l>
<l>Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,</l>
<l>And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;</l>
<l>If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed</l>
<l>A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:</l>
<l>Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,</l>
<l>And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,</l>
<l>But rather famish them amid their plenty,</l>
<l>Making them red and pale with fresh variety,</l>
<l>Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:</l>
<l>A summer's day will seem an hour but short,</l>
<l>Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,</l>
<l>The precedent of pith and livelihood,</l>
<l>And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,</l>
<l>Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:</l>
<l>Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force</l>
<l>Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,</l>
<l>Under her other was the tender boy,</l>
<l>Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,</l>
<l>With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;</l>
<l>She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,</l>
<l>He red for shame, but frosty in desire.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>The studded bridle on a ragged bough</l>
<l>Nimbly she fastens:&mdash;O, how quick is love!&mdash;</l>
<l>The steed is stalled up, and even now</l>
<l>To tie the rider she begins to prove:</l>
<l>Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,</l>
<l>And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>So soon was she along as he was down,</l>
<l>Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:</l>
<l>Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,</l>
<l>And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;</l>
<l>And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,</l>
<l>If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears</l>
<l>Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;</l>
<l>Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs</l>
<l>To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:</l>
<l>He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;</l>
<l>What follows more she murders with a kiss.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,</l>
<l>Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,</l>
<l>Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,</l>
<l>Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;</l>
<l>Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,</l>
<l>And where she ends she doth anew begin.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Forced to content, but never to obey,</l>
<l>Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;</l>
<l>She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,</l>
<l>And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;</l>
<l>Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,</l>
<l>So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,</l>
<l>So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;</l>
<l>Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,</l>
<l>Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:</l>
<l>Rain added to a river that is rank</l>
<l>Perforce will force it overflow the bank.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,</l>
<l>For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;</l>
<l>Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,</l>
<l>Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:</l>
<l>Being red, she loves him best; and being white,</l>
<l>Her best is better'd with a more delight.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;</l>
<l>And by her fair immortal hand she swears,</l>
<l>From his soft bosom never to remove,</l>
<l>Till he take truce with her contending tears,</l>
<l>Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;</l>
<l>And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Upon this promise did he raise his chin,</l>
<l>Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,</l>
<l>Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;</l>
<l>So offers he to give what she did crave;</l>
<l>But when her lips were ready for his pay,</l>
<l>He winks, and turns his lips another way.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Never did passenger in summer's heat</l>
<l>More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.</l>
<l>Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;</l>
<l>She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:</l>
<l>O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!</l>
<l>Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,</l>
<l>Even by the stern and direful god of war,</l>
<l>Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,</l>
<l>Who conquers where he comes in every jar;</l>
<l>Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,</l>
<l>And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Over my altars hath he hung his lance,</l>
<l>His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,</l>
<l>And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,</l>
<l>To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,</l>
<l>Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,</l>
<l>Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,</l>
<l>Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:</l>
<l>Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,</l>
<l>Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.</l>
<l>O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,</l>
<l>For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,&mdash;</l>
<l>Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red&mdash;</l>
<l>The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.</l>
<l>What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:</l>
<l>Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;</l>
<l>Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?</l>
<l>Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,</l>
<l>And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;</l>
<l>Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;</l>
<l>Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:</l>
<l>These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean</l>
<l>Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>The tender spring upon thy tempting lip</l>
<l>Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:</l>
<l>Make use of time, let not advantage slip;</l>
<l>Beauty within itself should not be wasted:</l>
<l>Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime</l>
<l>Rot and consume themselves in little time.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,</l>
<l>Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,</l>
<l>O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,</l>
<l>Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,</l>
<l>Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee</l>
<l>But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;</l>
<l>Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning:</l>
<l>My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,</l>
<l>My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;</l>
<l>My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,</l>
<l>Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,</l>
<l>Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,</l>
<l>Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,</l>
<l>Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:</l>
<l>Love is a spirit all compact of fire,</l>
<l>Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;</l>
<l>These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;</l>
<l>Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,</l>
<l>From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:</l>
<l>Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be</l>
<l>That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?</l>
<l>Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?</l>
<l>Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,</l>
<l>Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.</l>
<l>Narcissus so himself himself forsook,</l>
<l>And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,</l>
<l>Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,</l>
<l>Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:</l>
<l>Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:</l>
<l>Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;</l>
<l>Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,</l>
<l>Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?</l>
<l>By law of nature thou art bound to breed,</l>
<l>That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;</l>
<l>And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,</l>
<l>In that thy likeness still is left alive.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,</l>
<l>For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,</l>
<l>And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,</l>
<l>With burning eye did hotly overlook them;</l>
<l>Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,</l>
<l>So he were like him and by Venus' side.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,</l>
<l>And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,</l>
<l>His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,</l>
<l>Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,</l>
<l>Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love!</l>
<l>The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?</l>
<l>What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!</l>
<l>I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind</l>
<l>Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:</l>
<l>I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;</l>
<l>If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,</l>
<l>And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:</l>
<l>The heat I have from thence doth little harm,</l>
<l>Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;</l>
<l>And were I not immortal, life were done</l>
<l>Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,</l>
<l>Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?</l>
<l>Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel</l>
<l>What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?</l>
<l>O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,</l>
<l>She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this?</l>
<l>Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?</l>
<l>What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?</l>
<l>Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:</l>
<l>Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,</l>
<l>And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,</l>
<l>Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,</l>
<l>Statue contenting but the eye alone,</l>
<l>Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!</l>
<l>Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,</l>
<l>For men will kiss even by their own direction.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,</l>
<l>And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;</l>
<l>Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;</l>
<l>Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:</l>
<l>And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,</l>
<l>And now her sobs do her intendments break.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,</l>
<l>Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;</l>
<l>Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:</l>
<l>She would, he will not in her arms be bound;</l>
<l>And when from thence he struggles to be gone,</l>
<l>She locks her lily fingers one in one.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here</l>
<l>Within the circuit of this ivory pale,</l>
<l>I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;</l>
<l>Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:</l>
<l>Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,</l>
<l>Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Within this limit is relief enough,</l>
<l>Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,</l>
<l>Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,</l>
<l>To shelter thee from tempest and from rain</l>
<l>Then be my deer, since I am such a park;</l>
<l>No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,</l>
<l>That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:</l>
<l>Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,</l>
<l>He might be buried in a tomb so simple;</l>
<l>Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,</l>
<l>Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,</l>
<l>Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.</l>
<l>Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?</l>
<l>Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?</l>
<l>Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,</l>
<l>To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?</l>
<l>Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;</l>
<l>The time is spent, her object will away,</l>
<l>And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.</l>
<l>Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'</l>
<l>Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,</l>
<l>A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,</l>
<l>Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,</l>
<l>And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:</l>
<l>The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,</l>
<l>Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,</l>
<l>And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;</l>
<l>The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,</l>
<l>Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;</l>
<l>The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,</l>
<l>Controlling what he was controlled with.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane</l>
<l>Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;</l>
<l>His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,</l>
<l>As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:</l>
<l>His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,</l>
<l>Shows his hot courage and his high desire.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,</l>
<l>With gentle majesty and modest pride;</l>
<l>Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,</l>
<l>As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,</l>
<l>And this I do to captivate the eye</l>
<l>Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What recketh he his rider's angry stir,</l>
<l>His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?</l>
<l>What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?</l>
<l>For rich caparisons or trapping gay?</l>
<l>He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,</l>
<l>For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Look, when a painter would surpass the life,</l>
<l>In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,</l>
<l>His art with nature's workmanship at strife,</l>
<l>As if the dead the living should exceed;</l>
<l>So did this horse excel a common one</l>
<l>In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,</l>
<l>Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,</l>
<l>High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,</l>
<l>Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:</l>
<l>Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,</l>
<l>Save a proud rider on so proud a back.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;</l>
<l>Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;</l>
<l>To bid the wind a base he now prepares,</l>
<l>And whether he run or fly they know not whether;</l>
<l>For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,</l>
<l>Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;</l>
<l>She answers him as if she knew his mind:</l>
<l>Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,</l>
<l>She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,</l>
<l>Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,</l>
<l>Beating his kind embracements with her heels.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Then, like a melancholy malcontent,</l>
<l>He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,</l>
<l>Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:</l>
<l>He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.</l>
<l>His love, perceiving how he is enraged,</l>
<l>Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>His testy master goeth about to take him;</l>
<l>When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,</l>
<l>Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,</l>
<l>With her the horse, and left Adonis there:</l>
<l>As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,</l>
<l>Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,</l>
<l>Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:</l>
<l>And now the happy season once more fits,</l>
<l>That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;</l>
<l>For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong</l>
<l>When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,</l>
<l>Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:</l>
<l>So of concealed sorrow may be said;</l>
<l>Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;</l>
<l>But when the heart's attorney once is mute,</l>
<l>The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,</l>
<l>Even as a dying coal revives with wind,</l>
<l>And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;</l>
<l>Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,</l>
<l>Taking no notice that she is so nigh,</l>
<l>For all askance he holds her in his eye.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, what a sight it was, wistly to view</l>
<l>How she came stealing to the wayward boy!</l>
<l>To note the fighting conflict of her hue,</l>
<l>How white and red each other did destroy!</l>
<l>But now her cheek was pale, and by and by</l>
<l>It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now was she just before him as he sat,</l>
<l>And like a lowly lover down she kneels;</l>
<l>With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,</l>
<l>Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:</l>
<l>His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,</l>
<l>As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, what a war of looks was then between them!</l>
<l>Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;</l>
<l>His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;</l>
<l>Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:</l>
<l>And all this dumb play had his acts made plain</l>
<l>With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Full gently now she takes him by the hand,</l>
<l>A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,</l>
<l>Or ivory in an alabaster band;</l>
<l>So white a friend engirts so white a foe:</l>
<l>This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,</l>
<l>Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:</l>
<l>O fairest mover on this mortal round,</l>
<l>Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,</l>
<l>My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;</l>
<l>For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,</l>
<l>Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'</l>
<l>Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:</l>
<l>O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,</l>
<l>And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:</l>
<l>Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,</l>
<l>Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;</l>
<l>My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,</l>
<l>And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:</l>
<l>I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;</l>
<l>For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,</l>
<l>Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,</l>
<l>Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:</l>
<l>Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;</l>
<l>Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:</l>
<l>The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;</l>
<l>Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,</l>
<l>Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!</l>
<l>But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,</l>
<l>He held such petty bondage in disdain;</l>
<l>Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,</l>
<l>Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,</l>
<l>Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,</l>
<l>But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,</l>
<l>His other agents aim at like delight?</l>
<l>Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold</l>
<l>To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;</l>
<l>And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,</l>
<l>To take advantage on presented joy;</l>
<l>Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;</l>
<l>O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,</l>
<l>And once made perfect, never lost again.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,</l>
<l>Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;</l>
<l>Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;</l>
<l>My love to love is love but to disgrace it;</l>
<l>For I have heard it is a life in death,</l>
<l>That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?</l>
<l>Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?</l>
<l>If springing things be any jot diminish'd,</l>
<l>They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:</l>
<l>The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young</l>
<l>Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,</l>
<l>And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:</l>
<l>Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;</l>
<l>To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:</l>
<l>Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;</l>
<l>For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?</l>
<l>O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!</l>
<l>Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;</l>
<l>I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:</l>
<l>Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,</l>
<l>Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love</l>
<l>That inward beauty and invisible;</l>
<l>Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move</l>
<l>Each part in me that were but sensible:</l>
<l>Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,</l>
<l>Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,</l>
<l>And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,</l>
<l>And nothing but the very smell were left me,</l>
<l>Yet would my love to thee be still as much;</l>
<l>For from the stillitory of thy face excelling</l>
<l>Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by smelling.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,</l>
<l>Being nurse and feeder of the other four!</l>
<l>Would they not wish the feast might ever last,</l>
<l>And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,</l>
<l>Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,</l>
<l>Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,</l>
<l>Which to his speech did honey passage yield;</l>
<l>Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd</l>
<l>Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,</l>
<l>Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,</l>
<l>Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:</l>
<l>Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,</l>
<l>Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,</l>
<l>Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,</l>
<l>Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,</l>
<l>His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And at his look she flatly falleth down,</l>
<l>For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;</l>
<l>A smile recures the wounding of a frown;</l>
<l>But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!</l>
<l>The silly boy, believing she is dead,</l>
<l>Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And all amazed brake off his late intent,</l>
<l>For sharply he did think to reprehend her,</l>
<l>Which cunning love did wittily prevent:</l>
<l>Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!</l>
<l>For on the grass she lies as she were slain,</l>
<l>Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,</l>
<l>He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,</l>
<l>He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks</l>
<l>To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:</l>
<l>He kisses her; and she, by her good will,</l>
<l>Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:</l>
<l>Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,</l>
<l>Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array</l>
<l>He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;</l>
<l>And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,</l>
<l>So is her face illumined with her eye;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,</l>
<l>As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.</l>
<l>Were never four such lamps together mix'd,</l>
<l>Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;</l>
<l>But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,</l>
<l>Shone like the moon in water seen by night.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,</l>
<l>Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?</l>
<l>What hour is this? or morn or weary even?</l>
<l>Do I delight to die, or life desire?</l>
<l>But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;</l>
<l>But now I died, and death was lively joy.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:</l>
<l>Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,</l>
<l>Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain</l>
<l>That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;</l>
<l>And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,</l>
<l>But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!</l>
<l>O, never let their crimson liveries wear!</l>
<l>And as they last, their verdure still endure,</l>
<l>To drive infection from the dangerous year!</l>
<l>That the star-gazers, having writ on death,</l>
<l>May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,</l>
<l>What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?</l>
<l>To sell myself I can be well contented,</l>
<l>So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;</l>
<l>Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips</l>
<l>Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;</l>
<l>And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.</l>
<l>What is ten hundred touches unto thee?</l>
<l>Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?</l>
<l>Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,</l>
<l>Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,</l>
<l>Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:</l>
<l>Before I know myself, seek not to know me;</l>
<l>No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:</l>
<l>The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,</l>
<l>Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,</l>
<l>His day's hot task hath ended in the west;</l>
<l>The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'</l>
<l>The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,</l>
<l>And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light</l>
<l>Do summon us to part and bid good night.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;</l>
<l>If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'</l>
<l>Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'</l>
<l>The honey fee of parting tender'd is:</l>
<l>Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;</l>
<l>Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew</l>
<l>The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,</l>
<l>Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,</l>
<l>Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:</l>
<l>He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth</l>
<l>Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,</l>
<l>And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;</l>
<l>Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,</l>
<l>Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;</l>
<l>Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,</l>
<l>That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,</l>
<l>With blindfold fury she begins to forage;</l>
<l>Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,</l>
<l>And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,</l>
<l>Planting oblivion, beating reason back,</l>
<l>Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,</l>
<l>Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,</l>
<l>Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,</l>
<l>Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,</l>
<l>He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,</l>
<l>While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,</l>
<l>And yields at last to every light impression?</l>
<l>Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,</l>
<l>Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:</l>
<l>Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,</l>
<l>But then woos best when most his choice is froward.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,</l>
<l>Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.</l>
<l>Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;</l>
<l>What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:</l>
<l>Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,</l>
<l>Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For pity now she can no more detain him;</l>
<l>The poor fool prays her that he may depart:</l>
<l>She is resolved no longer to restrain him;</l>
<l>Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,</l>
<l>The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,</l>
<l>He carries thence incaged in his breast.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,</l>
<l>For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.</l>
<l>Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?</l>
<l>Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'</l>
<l>He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends</l>
<l>To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,</l>
<l>Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,</l>
<l>Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,</l>
<l>And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:</l>
<l>She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,</l>
<l>He on her belly falls, she on her back.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now is she in the very lists of love,</l>
<l>Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:</l>
<l>All is imaginary she doth prove,</l>
<l>He will not manage her, although he mount her;</l>
<l>That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,</l>
<l>To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,</l>
<l>Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,</l>
<l>Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,</l>
<l>As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.</l>
<l>The warm effects which she in him finds missing</l>
<l>She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:</l>
<l>She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;</l>
<l>Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;</l>
<l>She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.</l>
<l>Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;</l>
<l>You have no reason to withhold me so.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,</l>
<l>But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.</l>
<l>O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is</l>
<l>With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,</l>
<l>Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,</l>
<l>Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>On his bow-back he hath a battle set</l>
<l>Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;</l>
<l>His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;</l>
<l>His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;</l>
<l>Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,</l>
<l>And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,</l>
<l>Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;</l>
<l>His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;</l>
<l>Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:</l>
<l>The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,</l>
<l>As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,</l>
<l>To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;</l>
<l>Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,</l>
<l>Whose full perfection all the world amazes;</l>
<l>But having thee at vantage,&mdash;wondrous dread!&mdash;</l>
<l>Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;</l>
<l>Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:</l>
<l>Come not within his danger by thy will;</l>
<l>They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.</l>
<l>When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,</l>
<l>I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?</l>
<l>Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?</l>
<l>Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?</l>
<l>Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,</l>
<l>My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,</l>
<l>But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy</l>
<l>Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;</l>
<l>Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,</l>
<l>And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'</l>
<l>Distempering gentle Love in his desire,</l>
<l>As air and water do abate the fire.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,</l>
<l>This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,</l>
<l>This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,</l>
<l>That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,</l>
<l>Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear</l>
<l>That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And more than so, presenteth to mine eye</l>
<l>The picture of an angry-chafing boar,</l>
<l>Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie</l>
<l>An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;</l>
<l>Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed</l>
<l>Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,</l>
<l>That tremble at the imagination?</l>
<l>The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,</l>
<l>And fear doth teach it divination:</l>
<l>I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,</l>
<l>If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;</l>
<l>Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,</l>
<l>Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,</l>
<l>Or at the roe which no encounter dare:</l>
<l>Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,</l>
<l>And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy hounds.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,</l>
<l>Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles</l>
<l>How he outruns the wind and with what care</l>
<l>He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:</l>
<l>The many musets through the which he goes</l>
<l>Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,</l>
<l>To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,</l>
<l>And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,</l>
<l>To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,</l>
<l>And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:</l>
<l>Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For there his smell with others being mingled,</l>
<l>The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,</l>
<l>Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled</l>
<l>With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;</l>
<l>Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,</l>
<l>As if another chase were in the skies.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,</l>
<l>Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,</l>
<l>To harken if his foes pursue him still:</l>
<l>Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;</l>
<l>And now his grief may be compared well</l>
<l>To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch</l>
<l>Turn, and return, indenting with the way;</l>
<l>Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,</l>
<l>Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:</l>
<l>For misery is trodden on by many,</l>
<l>And being low never relieved by any.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Lie quietly, and hear a little more;</l>
<l>Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:</l>
<l>To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,</l>
<l>Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,</l>
<l>Applying this to that, and so to so;</l>
<l>For love can comment upon every woe.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,</l>
<l>Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:</l>
<l>The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.</l>
<l>I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;</l>
<l>And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'</l>
<l>In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,</l>
<l>The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,</l>
<l>And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.</l>
<l>Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips</l>
<l>Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,</l>
<l>Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:</l>
<l>Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,</l>
<l>Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,</l>
<l>For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;</l>
<l>Wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,</l>
<l>To shame the sun by day and her by night.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies</l>
<l>To cross the curious workmanship of nature,</l>
<l>To mingle beauty with infirmities,</l>
<l>And pure perfection with impure defeature,</l>
<l>Making it subject to the tyranny</l>
<l>Of mad mischances and much misery;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,</l>
<l>Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,</l>
<l>The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint</l>
<l>Disorder breeds by heating of the blood:</l>
<l>Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,</l>
<l>Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And not the least of all these maladies</l>
<l>But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:</l>
<l>Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,</l>
<l>Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,</l>
<l>Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,</l>
<l>As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,</l>
<l>Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,</l>
<l>That on the earth would breed a scarcity</l>
<l>And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,</l>
<l>Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night</l>
<l>Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What is thy body but a swallowing grave,</l>
<l>Seeming to bury that posterity</l>
<l>Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,</l>
<l>If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?</l>
<l>If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,</l>
<l>Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>So in thyself thyself art made away;</l>
<l>A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,</l>
<l>Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,</l>
<l>Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life.</l>
<l>Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,</l>
<l>But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Nay, then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again</l>
<l>Into your idle over-handled theme:</l>
<l>The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,</l>
<l>And all in vain you strive against the stream;</l>
<l>For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,</l>
<l>Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,</l>
<l>And every tongue more moving than your own,</l>
<l>Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,</l>
<l>Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown</l>
<l>For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,</l>
<l>And will not let a false sound enter there;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Lest the deceiving harmony should run</l>
<l>Into the quiet closure of my breast;</l>
<l>And then my little heart were quite undone,</l>
<l>In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.</l>
<l>No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,</l>
<l>But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>What have you urged that I cannot reprove?</l>
<l>The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger:</l>
<l>I hate not love, but your device in love,</l>
<l>That lends embracements unto every stranger.</l>
<l>You do it for increase: O strange excuse,</l>
<l>When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,</l>
<l>Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;</l>
<l>Under whose simple semblance he hath fed</l>
<l>Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;</l>
<l>Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,</l>
<l>As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,</l>
<l>But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;</l>
<l>Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,</l>
<l>Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;</l>
<l>Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;</l>
<l>Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>More I could tell, but more I dare not say;</l>
<l>The text is old, the orator too green.</l>
<l>Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;</l>
<l>My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:</l>
<l>Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,</l>
<l>Do burn themselves for having so offended.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,</l>
<l>Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,</l>
<l>And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;</l>
<l>Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.</l>
<l>Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,</l>
<l>So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Which after him she darts, as one on shore</l>
<l>Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,</l>
<l>Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,</l>
<l>Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:</l>
<l>So did the merciless and pitchy night</l>
<l>Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Whereat amazed, as one that unaware</l>
<l>Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,</l>
<l>Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,</l>
<l>Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,</l>
<l>Even so confounded in the dark she lay,</l>
<l>Having lost the fair discovery of her way.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,</l>
<l>That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,</l>
<l>Make verbal repetition of her moans;</l>
<l>Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:</l>
<l>Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!'</l>
<l>And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>She marking them begins a wailing note</l>
<l>And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;</l>
<l>How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;</l>
<l>How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:</l>
<l>Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,</l>
<l>And still the choir of echoes answer so.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Her song was tedious and outwore the night,</l>
<l>For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:</l>
<l>If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight</l>
<l>In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:</l>
<l>Their copious stories oftentimes begun</l>
<l>End without audience and are never done.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For who hath she to spend the night withal</l>
<l>But idle sounds resembling parasites,</l>
<l>Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,</l>
<l>Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?</l>
<l>She says ''Tis so:' they answer all ''Tis so;'</l>
<l>And would say after her, if she said 'No.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,</l>
<l>From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,</l>
<l>And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast</l>
<l>The sun ariseth in his majesty;</l>
<l>Who doth the world so gloriously behold</l>
<l>That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:</l>
<l>O thou clear god, and patron of all light,</l>
<l>From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow</l>
<l>The beauteous influence that makes him bright,</l>
<l>There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,</l>
<l>May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,</l>
<l>Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,</l>
<l>And yet she hears no tidings of her love:</l>
<l>She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:</l>
<l>Anon she hears them chant it lustily,</l>
<l>And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And as she runs, the bushes in the way</l>
<l>Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,</l>
<l>Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:</l>
<l>She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,</l>
<l>Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,</l>
<l>Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;</l>
<l>Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder</l>
<l>Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,</l>
<l>The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;</l>
<l>Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds</l>
<l>Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,</l>
<l>But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,</l>
<l>Because the cry remaineth in one place,</l>
<l>Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:</l>
<l>Finding their enemy to be so curst,</l>
<l>They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,</l>
<l>Through which it enters to surprise her heart;</l>
<l>Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,</l>
<l>With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:</l>
<l>Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,</l>
<l>They basely fly and dare not stay the field.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;</l>
<l>Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,</l>
<l>She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,</l>
<l>And childish error, that they are afraid;</l>
<l>Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:&mdash;</l>
<l>And with that word she spied the hunted boar,</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,</l>
<l>Like milk and blood being mingled both together,</l>
<l>A second fear through all her sinews spread,</l>
<l>Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:</l>
<l>This way runs, and now she will no further,</l>
<l>But back retires to rate the boar for murther.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;</l>
<l>She treads the path that she untreads again;</l>
<l>Her more than haste is mated with delays,</l>
<l>Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,</l>
<l>Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;</l>
<l>In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,</l>
<l>And asks the weary caitiff for his master,</l>
<l>And there another licking of his wound,</l>
<l>Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;</l>
<l>And here she meets another sadly scowling,</l>
<l>To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,</l>
<l>Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,</l>
<l>Against the welkin volleys out his voice;</l>
<l>Another and another answer him,</l>
<l>Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,</l>
<l>Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Look, how the world's poor people are amazed</l>
<l>At apparitions, signs and prodigies,</l>
<l>Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,</l>
<l>Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;</l>
<l>So she at these sad signs draws up her breath</l>
<l>And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,</l>
<l>Hateful divorce of love,'&mdash;thus chides she Death,&mdash;</l>
<l>Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean</l>
<l>To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,</l>
<l>Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set</l>
<l>Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>If he be dead,&mdash;O no, it cannot be,</l>
<l>Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:&mdash;</l>
<l>O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,</l>
<l>But hatefully at random dost thou hit.</l>
<l>Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart</l>
<l>Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,</l>
<l>And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.</l>
<l>The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;</l>
<l>They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:</l>
<l>Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,</l>
<l>And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?</l>
<l>What may a heavy groan advantage thee?</l>
<l>Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping</l>
<l>Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?</l>
<l>Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,</l>
<l>Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Here overcome, as one full of despair,</l>
<l>She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt</l>
<l>The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair</l>
<l>In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;</l>
<l>But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,</l>
<l>And with his strong course opens them again.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!</l>
<l>Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;</l>
<l>Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,</l>
<l>Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;</l>
<l>But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,</l>
<l>Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Variable passions throng her constant woe,</l>
<l>As striving who should best become her grief;</l>
<l>All entertain'd, each passion labours so,</l>
<l>That every present sorrow seemeth chief,</l>
<l>But none is best: then join they all together,</l>
<l>Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;</l>
<l>A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:</l>
<l>The dire imagination she did follow</l>
<l>This sound of hope doth labour to expel;</l>
<l>For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,</l>
<l>And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,</l>
<l>Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;</l>
<l>Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,</l>
<l>Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,</l>
<l>To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,</l>
<l>Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O hard-believing love, how strange it seems</l>
<l>Not to believe, and yet too credulous!</l>
<l>Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;</l>
<l>Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:</l>
<l>The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,</l>
<l>In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;</l>
<l>Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;</l>
<l>It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:</l>
<l>Now she adds honours to his hateful name;</l>
<l>She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,</l>
<l>Imperious supreme of all mortal things.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;</l>
<l>Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear</l>
<l>When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,</l>
<l>Which knows no pity, but is still severe;</l>
<l>Then, gentle shadow,&mdash;truth I must confess,&mdash;</l>
<l>I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>'Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue;</l>
<l>Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;</l>
<l>Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;</l>
<l>I did but act, he's author of thy slander:</l>
<l>Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet</l>
<l>Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,</l>
<l>Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;</l>
<l>And that his beauty may the better thrive,</l>
<l>With Death she humbly doth insinuate;</l>
<l>Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories</l>
<l>His victories, his triumphs and his glories.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I</l>
<l>To be of such a weak and silly mind</l>
<l>To wail his death who lives and must not die</l>
<l>Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!</l>
<l>For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,</l>
<l>And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear</l>
<l>As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;</l>
<l>Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,</l>
<l>Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'</l>
<l>Even at this word she hears a merry horn,</l>
<l>Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>As falcon to the lure, away she flies;</l>
<l>The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;</l>
<l>And in her haste unfortunately spies</l>
<l>The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;</l>
<l>Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,</l>
<l>Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,</l>
<l>Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,</l>
<l>And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,</l>
<l>Long after fearing to creep forth again;</l>
<l>So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled</l>
<l>Into the deep dark cabins of her head:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Where they resign their office and their light</l>
<l>To the disposing of her troubled brain;</l>
<l>Who bids them still consort with ugly night,</l>
<l>And never wound the heart with looks again;</l>
<l>Who like a king perplexed in his throne,</l>
<l>By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Whereat each tributary subject quakes;</l>
<l>As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,</l>
<l>Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,</l>
<l>Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.</l>
<l>This mutiny each part doth so surprise</l>
<l>That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And, being open'd, threw unwilling light</l>
<l>Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd</l>
<l>In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white</l>
<l>With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:</l>
<l>No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,</l>
<l>But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;</l>
<l>Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;</l>
<l>Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;</l>
<l>She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:</l>
<l>Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;</l>
<l>Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,</l>
<l>That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;</l>
<l>And then she reprehends her mangling eye,</l>
<l>That makes more gashes where no breach should be:</l>
<l>His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;</l>
<l>For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>My tongue cannot express my grief for one,</l>
<l>And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!</l>
<l>My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,</l>
<l>Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:</l>
<l>Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!</l>
<l>So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!</l>
<l>What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?</l>
<l>Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast</l>
<l>Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?</l>
<l>The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;</l>
<l>But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!</l>
<l>Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:</l>
<l>Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;</l>
<l>The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:</l>
<l>But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air</l>
<l>Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>And therefore would he put his bonnet on,</l>
<l>Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;</l>
<l>The wind would blow it off and, being gone,</l>
<l>Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;</l>
<l>And straight, in pity of his tender years,</l>
<l>They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>To see his face the lion walk'd along</l>
<l>Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;</l>
<l>To recreate himself when he hath sung,</l>
<l>The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;</l>
<l>If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey</l>
<l>And never fright the silly lamb that day.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>When he beheld his shadow in the brook,</l>
<l>The fishes spread on it their golden gills;</l>
<l>When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,</l>
<l>That some would sing, some other in their bills</l>
<l>Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;</l>
<l>He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,</l>
<l>Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,</l>
<l>Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;</l>
<l>Witness the entertainment that he gave:</l>
<l>If he did see his face, why then I know</l>
<l>He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>'Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:</l>
<l>He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,</l>
<l>Who did not whet his teeth at him again,</l>
<l>But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;</l>
<l>And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine</l>
<l>Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,</l>
<l>With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;</l>
<l>But he is dead, and never did he bless</l>
<l>My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'</l>
<l>With this, she falleth in the place she stood,</l>
<l>And stains her face with his congealed blood.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;</l>
<l>She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;</l>
<l>She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,</l>
<l>As if they heard the woeful words she told;</l>
<l>She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,</l>
<l>Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Two glasses, where herself herself beheld</l>
<l>A thousand times, and now no more reflect;</l>
<l>Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,</l>
<l>And every beauty robb'd of his effect:</l>
<l>Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,</l>
<l>That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:</l>
<l>Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:</l>
<l>It shall be waited on with jealousy,</l>
<l>Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,</l>
<l>Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,</l>
<l>That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,</l>
<l>Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;</l>
<l>The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd</l>
<l>With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:</l>
<l>The strongest body shall it make most weak,</l>
<l>Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>It shall be sparing and too full of riot,</l>
<l>Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;</l>
<l>The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,</l>
<l>Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;</l>
<l>It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,</l>
<l>Make the young old, the old become a child.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;</l>
<l>It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;</l>
<l>It shall be merciful and too severe,</l>
<l>And most deceiving when it seems most just;</l>
<l>Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,</l>
<l>Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>It shall be cause of war and dire events,</l>
<l>And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;</l>
<l>Subject and servile to all discontents,</l>
<l>As dry combustious matter is to fire:</l>
<l>Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,</l>
<l>They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd</l>
<l>Was melted like a vapour from her sight,</l>
<l>And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,</l>
<l>A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,</l>
<l>Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood</l>
<l>Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,</l>
<l>Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,</l>
<l>And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,</l>
<l>Since he himself is reft from her by death:</l>
<l>She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears</l>
<l>Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise&mdash;</l>
<l>Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire&mdash;</l>
<l>For every little grief to wet his eyes:</l>
<l>To grow unto himself was his desire,</l>
<l>And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good</l>
<l>To wither in my breast as in his blood.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;</l>
<l>Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:</l>
<l>Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,</l>
<l>My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:</l>
<l>There shall not be one minute in an hour</l>
<l>Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="poem">
<l>Thus weary of the world, away she hies,</l>
<l>And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid</l>
<l>Their mistress mounted through the empty skies</l>
<l>In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;</l>
<l>Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen</l>
<l>Means to immure herself and not be seen.</l>
