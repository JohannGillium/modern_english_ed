Orton, J. R.  "Trial Trip of the 'Flying Cloud.'"
<lb/>
 <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> 4 (Nov. 1859): 575-590</head>

<p>"THROUGH in four days to San Francisco," repeated I.
"Marvellous age!"
</p><p>I hastily computed the distance by an air-line, and placed the
speed of the craft at some thirty miles an hour.  That seemed
reasonable enough.  Indeed, the whole statement cohered
marvellously well; all the parts harmonized with each other and
looked plausible, even reasonable, as I have said, except the grand
fact itself, which was too momentous for belief.  But why should it
not be true?  What new achievement of the human mind ought to
startle one in this nineteenth century, after having witnessed the
wonders of steam and electro-magnetism?  I determined to sift the
matter, but immediately remembered that all the knowledge I had of
it had been imparted to me in the strictest confidence.  The
ingenious inventors, as was clearly their right, had reserved it to
themselves to choose the time and way of making their invention
public, when it was to break on the world, some fine morning, like
the discovery of a second moon performing its orbit round the
earth.  I sunk into a brown study.
</p><p>In the evening, Mr. Bonflon called again, as he had promised.
He brought with him a large roll of plans and drawings, for the
purpose of illustrating more clearly the principles and method of
construction and operation of his aerial ship.
<pb n="576"/>
They were
projected on a large scale, and the workmanship was superb.  Months
of hard labor by a finished draughtsman must have been devoted to
their execution.  "And what an additional outlay of time and
brains," thought I, "must have been required, to devise the scheme
and construct the machine itself, so as to elevate the ingenious
ideal into an absolute working reality!"  These drawings, Mr.
Bonflon informed me, were duplicates of others which had been
privately deposited in the Patent-Office at Washington.
</p><p>The one which chiefly attracted my attention was that which
represented the monster steamer complete, with all its appendages
and complement of passengers, in its majestic flight through the
air.  Below it were the drifting clouds.  Its course lay quite
above the storms and hurricanes and conflicting wind-currents which
vex the lower strata of the atmosphere, where it comes in contact
with the earth's uneven surface, and is kept in motion by the
contractions and expansions of alternate cold and heat, and is
broken and set whirling by the forests and gorges and mountain-tops
among which it is compelled to force its way.  Above all this, Mr.
Bonflon assured me, as aeronauts report, there is ever a smooth,
quiet atmospheric sea.
</p><p>"But how is life to be sustained for any considerable time in
that rarefied medium?" inquired I, "when it is asserted that even
in ascending high mountains, the texture of the soft parts of the
human body becomes so loose and flabby from diminished atmospheric
pressure as to cause one, so to speak, to sweat blood, &mdash; which oozes
perceptibly from the mouth and nose and eyes, and even from under
the finger-nails?"
</p><p>Mr. Bonflon pointed to a long, narrow line which floated
rearward at an angle of about forty-five degrees from the point of
its attachment to his ship.
</p><p>"That," said he, "is an India-rubber tube several thousand
feet long, extending down into the respirable atmosphere, and
keeping the cabins always supplied with fresh and wholesome air."
</p><p>"But would the heavier nether air flow in that direction?" I
asked.
</p><p>"With a little help from the engine," he replied, "a constant
current, whenever needed, is kept up; and the process of breathing
is rendered as easy and agreeable in the cabins of the 'Flying
Cloud' as in one's own parlors at home.  On the upper deck, which
is not inclosed, you see, it is different.  In the first trial-trip
to California, Mr. M&mdash; insisted on remaining above on this deck
for six consecutive hours, and the result was an attack of
hemorrhage from the lungs.  On his going below, however, it almost
instantly ceased."
</p><p>I must now endeavor to give the reader some definite idea of
this extraordinary machine, as exhibited in the drawings.  Its
buoyant power was, of course, on the principle of the balloon.  But
the gas-chamber, or part to be inflated, instead of being globular
in form, consisted of two horizontal cones joined at the base; or
more accurately still, it resembled an immense barrel extended at
both ends to a point, and resting on its side.  This shape was
given it, according to Mr. Bonflon, that it might offer the least
possible resistance to the element in which it was intended to
move.  In structure it was composed of a strong flexible frame of
whalebone and steel, covered with silk, strengthened and rendered
air-tight and water-proof by a coating of India-rubber.  Its size,
of course, would depend on the proposed tonnage of a particular
ship.  That of the working-model, as nearly as I remember, was
about six hundred feet long, by some seventy or eighty in breadth
in the middle, which was calculated to be amply sufficient to
sustain the immense car beneath, with its engine, and fuel for a
week, and three hundred passengers with their baggage; leaving
still a considerable margin for freight.
</p><p>Mr. Bonflon here pointed out, with great minuteness, the
simple, but ingenious method devised for the inflation of this
enormous machine, and the regulation of the gas; which I pass over,
from
<pb n="577"/>
an inability to render it intelligible by mere
description.
</p><p>The car or vessel suspended below, and to which the balloon
part bore the relation of masts and sails, was fashioned after the
best model of a clipper ship, but still farther elongated.  Below
deck, it was divided into sitting and dining cabins, state-rooms,
kitchen, engine-room, and so forth; and above was a long, railed,
promenade deck.  The attachment between the two parts was by means
of a network of ropes, extending from every quarter, and from the
whole circumference of the ship, connecting with staples in the
framework of the balloon, and finally embracing its entire body in
its folds.  Two enormous paddle-wheels, made of oiled silk
stretched on delicate frames, and driven by a steam-engine of the
lightest structure possible, furnished the propelling power; while
at the stern, like a vast fin, played the helm, of a similar
material and construction to the paddle-wheels.
</p><p>All this was explained to me in much fuller detail than I can
here repeat, by Mr. Bonflon, who added, that the materials employed
combined lightness with strength to a much greater degree than had
ever before been achieved, &mdash; that the fuel used was of the fluid
kind, a new combination of concentrated combustibles invented by
himself, &mdash; and that the weight of the entire machine had been
carefully calculated beforehand, together with its buoyant power,
and the results had demonstrated the accuracy of the mathematics.
</p><p>I turned on Mr. Bonflon and looked him squarely in the face.
He was a modest man and blushed slightly, but did not shrink.
There could be no dishonesty there.  His countenance bore the
unmistakable stamp of integrity, as well as intelligence; and his
whole appearance and bearing were those of a true man.
</p><p>Had he brought me the newspaper he promised, not yet eight
days old, from San Francisco?
</p><p>No.  He had been detained down-town all day in the whirl of
our New York Babel, and had not yet been home.  He would hand it in
to-morrow.
</p><p>Mr. Bonflon had been introduced to me that morning by a friend
on whose acuteness and judgment I felt I had many good reasons to
rely.  Without pretending any precise knowledge of the man, or,
indeed, any knowledge at all, beyond what had been gathered from
the individual himself in a very brief acquaintance of Mr.
Bonflon's own seeking, he expressed a warm interest in him
personally, as also in the startling discovery he professed to have
made.
</p><p>In that interview, Mr. Bonflon had informed us in brief, that,
after ten years of patient and toilsome experiment, of
disappointment, of perishing and reviving hope, he had at length
achieved the grand object of his life.  He had solved the problem
of the navigation of the air.  He had proved by actual results,
that the great ocean of atmosphere above us could be ploughed as
successfully and safely as the waters beneath, and with much
greater facility and pleasure.  He stated that the first trial-trip, after the completion of the ship, had been made in the night
from an obscure point in the State of Maryland, and extended north
and northeast, along the Atlantic coast, to New York, &mdash; whose glow
of light from a great height, like a phosphorescent mist, was
plainly distinguishable, &mdash; and thence to the neighborhood of Boston,
and back to the place of starting; and that a second, with equally
favorable results, had been made from the same point by a more
inland route, northwest to Buffalo and the Canada line; and he
named several well-known persons who were on board at one or the
other of these times, and related some little anecdotes
illustrative of their states of mind and apprehensions while
drifting above the earth on the occasion of these novel voyages.
</p><p>He said, further, that the President and heads of departments
at Washington were fully cognizant of the matter; and that a third
grant trial-trip, in the interest of government, had been secretly
made, with important dispatches to California,
<pb n="578"/>
relating to
the security of our rights in the Pacific.  Four days had been
consumed in the passage out, including a stoppage of a couple of
hours on a fine plateau, near the head waters of the Missouri, at
the foot of the Rocky Mountains; and the same in the return.  They
had landed in the night in a deep valley a few miles out of San
Francisco, and remained two days in that city; which gave a period
of ten days to the entire voyage, out and back.  Forty selected
individuals, all bound to secresy, had participated in the risks
and excitements of the extraordinary occasion.  Mr. Bonflon was not
of the number.  An heroic daughter of his was.  His partner, Mons.
De Aery, a French gentleman of great mechanical skill, had managed
the affair; and the craft, in the same hands, was now absent on her
second expedition across the American continent.
</p><p>Such was the sum of Mr. Bonflon's revelations of the morning.
What a discovery!  How the announcement would astonish the world!
How the practical fact would overturn the world, upset commerce,
and transform the habits and relations of mankind!  America, the
pioneer in many valuable discoveries and reforms, was still ahead,
 &mdash; still destined to lead the van in the development of the powers
and resources of Nature, and the onward march of nations.
</p><p>Hurriedly recalling all these points to mind, I requested to
know of Mr. Bonflon how it had been possible, with so many
confidants and the prying propensities of the press, whose agents,
like an invisible police, are everywhere, to keep the matter from
becoming public, &mdash; at least, to cover the affair so completely that
no hint of the existence of his machine should have been given in
any quarter, or of the vast changes which its introduction as a
power in the world could not fail to effect.
</p><p>To this he replied, that the press had behaved very
handsomely; that the principal papers of the country had <hi rend="italic">
attaches</hi> aboard on the first trip to the Pacific; but that all
parties &mdash; the government, the editors, together with De Aery and
himself &mdash; were agreed that the matter should be kept strictly
private, until its practicality and value should be established
beyond the possibility of question.
</p><p>I now remembered, that, several years ago, a good deal of
noise had been made about a flying-machine which had been
constructed in some of the suburbs of the city, &mdash; and that a day had
been advertised when it was to make an ascent, but it failed.  I
mentioned the circumstance to Mr. Bonflon.
</p><p>"Yes," he replied.  "It was at Hoboken.  De Aery and myself
spent years in the construction of that machine, and a large amount
of money.  On the day when the trial of its powers was to have
taken place, the weather proved unfavorable, and we met with
unexpected delays.  The spectators, who had congregated by the
thousands, became impatient; and the mob, breaking in upon us,
destroyed in an hour property which had cost us five thousand
dollars and the labor of years."
</p><p>I felt obliged to sympathize with Mr. Bonflon.  He had met
with the usual fortune of public benefactors, and particularly of
inventors.  His success, however, should it prove real, in the
unexampled brilliancy of its results, would more than compensate
him for all his disappointments and losses.  He would rank as the
greatest of discoverers, &mdash; as the master mind of this master
century.
</p><p>Leading him off from this one topic into general conversation,
I held him thus engaged for an hour.  I was charmed with his
comprehensive intelligence, and with the scope and liberality of
his views.  In everything relating to mechanics, his opinions were
marked with originality.  This had evidently been his favorite
field, where his quick perceptions and powers of concentration and
analysis had elevated him to an eminence where he stood almost
alone.  I had never met his equal.  In plausible suggestions
relative to the possibilities of the future, he took me quite above
my level,
<pb n="579"/>
and left me floating in a maze of glittering
bewilderment.  But I could discover no breaks, no confusion in his
mind, on the themes he presented.  His premises were apparently
well considered, and his conclusions the fair and natural sequences
flowing from them.
</p><p>On the following day, Mr. Bonflon called on me again.  In the
interval, my friend and myself had held extended consultations.  My
friend, while externally calm as the surface of a summer sea, as
was his wont, it was plain for me to see, was internally deeply
stirred and excited by the extraordinary nature of Mr. Bonflon's
revelations.  Acknowledging a mutual and increasing interest in the
intelligent inventor, we nevertheless parted in a wilderness of
doubt.  There was a mystery in the matter, &mdash; a surprise for the
world or a surprise for ourselves, &mdash; which time, it would seem, with
its busy thumb and finger, must be left to unravel at its leisure.
</p><p>Mr. Bonflon had not brought the California paper with him.
The two or three copies only which had come into his possession had
been handed around among his confidential friends, and he had not
been able to lay his hand on one.  He informed me that the "Flying
Cloud" was expected to return in three days, and, after remaining
two days on the Atlantic side of the continent, would then start on
her third experimental trip to the Pacific.  At that time he
expected to make one of the party himself, and he invited me to
accompany him.
</p><p>I accepted the invitation, and received from him particular
instructions as to the nature of my outfit.  It was in the midst of
the heats of summer.  He advised, however, a full supply of thick
clothing, on account of the increased chill and coldness of the
atmosphere at high altitudes; and, indeed, recommended a mail of
flannel next the skin.  Everything else &mdash; the supply of the larder,
with an excellent cook, beds, and so forth &mdash; would be found amply
provided by De Aery and himself for the comfort and accommodation
of their guests.  The station, or point of departure, Mr. Bonflon
informed me, was a retired spot but a few miles out of the city of
Baltimore; and he promised to be at hand at the proper time to
accompany me in person, and see me safely on board the "Flying
Cloud."
</p><p>I saw nothing more of Mr. Bonflon for several days.  Meanwhile
I arranged my affairs for a brief absence, and, as my family were
all off in the country, prepared a special letter for use, if
needed, to be dated and mailed at the last moment, notifying them
of a probable gap in my correspondence, on account of some pressing
business which would take me out of the city for a few days and
keep me constantly employed.
</p><p>In three or four days I received a note from Mr. Bonflon,
advising me to hold myself in readiness; and at the proper time, he
presented himself before me.  But he came to apologize.  The
"Flying Cloud" had returned.  The second trip had been as
successfully and safely performed as the first.  Nothing had
occurred to mar the pleasure of the voyage; but, unfortunately,
before coming on to New York, De Aery had filled out the complement
of guests for the third grand expedition.  Even he (Mr. Bonflon)
should remain behind; but he should see that seats were reserved
for us both, without fail, for the next succeeding trip.
</p><p>Mr. Bonflon took his leave; and I found myself more deeply
involved in doubt and perplexity than ever.  I could hardly say
that I was disappointed, or that I was not.  I had thrown myself on
a wave, with no look-out or means of judging where I was to be
cast, and had formed no opinions.  As yet, everything looked fair
with Mr. Bonflon.  His face was as honest as the morning sun, and
it was next to impossible to doubt him.  He might be the prey of
some strange phantasm, some monomania; but the evidences did not
show it.  The account he had given of himself was manly and
coherent; his claims as a discoverer had been modestly presented,
and were not wholly unsupported by circumstances, or unreasonable
<pb n="580"/>
in themselves.  Indeed, they must be regarded as coming
within the range of probabilities fully as much as, to human
seeming, had once the established, but ceaseless, wonders of steam
locomotion and electric telegraphing.
</p><p>Singularly enough, &mdash; and it illustrates the constantly shifting
scenes in the kaleidoscope of life, &mdash; within an hour, Mr. Bonflon
returned with a new message, and with the programme of the "Flying
Cloud" changed, if not reversed.  He had seen De Aery again.  One
or two of the expected passengers had telegraphed that untoward
circumstances would compel them to remain behind, and there would
be room for us.  But no time was to be lost; the air-steamer would
weigh anchor before daylight of the following morning, and we must
start for Baltimore by the next train.  De Aery and several others
were already flying over the rail on their way to Philadelphia.
</p><p>I did not allow myself to hesitate.  With an unusual degree of
excitement, made up of the mingled emotions of wonder, doubt, and,
I frankly confess, apprehension, I dated and superscribed the
letter to my absent family; and, taking my carpet-bag in my hand,
packed to plethora several days before in readiness for the
occasion, set out on the strange and questionable adventure.
</p><p>The run to Baltimore was made without accident or delay.  Mr.
Bonflon and myself conversed a good deal, and I found additional
cause to admire the discriminating character of his mind and the
curious and wonderful stores it contained.  Some of the time we
dozed, or sunk into a mental confusion like that to which the body
was subjected by the motion of the cars, and called it sleep.  My
own most impressive visions, however, were those of silent
wakefulness, and were connected with the morrow and the "Flying
Cloud."
</p><p>We stopped in the chief city of Maryland only long enough to
obtain some slight refreshments, such as could be furnished readily
in the middle of the night, and proceeded at once to the wharf or
station of our sky-sailer.  Ah, how shall I describe my sensations
on first beholding this most wonderful achievement of the age, and
thus satisfying myself that it was an actual existence, and not the
mere chimera of a diseased brain?  There she sat like a majestic
swan, floating, as it were, in the pure empyrean, and crowned with
a diadem of stars.  The Moon, Arcturus, and the Pleiades might well
all make obeisance to her, and the Milky Way invite her to extend
her flight and plough its snowy fields.  I was astonished at her
size, the symmetry of her parts, and the harmony of her
proportions, as she lay there at a great height, which I was quite
unable to estimate, in bold relief against the sky.
</p><p>But Mr. Bonflon could afford me but a brief time for
observation and the indulgence of my wonder.  The stores and most
of the passengers were already on board; and taking me by the arm,
he hurried me forward, and seated me in the small car or tender, by
means of which, and the agency of ropes and pulleys, we were to
reach her decks.  Our upward movement immediately commenced.  It
was steady and gentle, not calculated to create alarm; and still
the notion of quitting Mother Earth for an indefinite number of
days, to rove in the blue unknown of space, was attended with some
apprehensions and regrets.  I gazed anxiously at the receding
objects below; but my feelings underwent a change as we approached
the "Flying Cloud" herself, were pulled into her gangway, and I
found myself standing on her solid decks.  A brief further period
intervened, and our anchor was loosed; the tremendous machine
became instinct with life; she began to move; and, hurrah! we were
under way.
</p><p>The thoughts and emotions of this bewildering moment it is
impossible to describe.  Our craft moved off majestically, like
some huge water-fowl rising from the sea.  Her course was westward
and upward, like the eagle with his face turned toward the palace
of the sun.  At first the lights in the city of Baltimore became
<pb n="581"/>
more numerous and distinct, as intervening objects were
surmounted and overlooked.  Next they began to fade, shrinking down
into twinkling points like fireflies, until they disappeared.
Forests, hills, and mountains followed after, as our altitude was
increased, blending together like a hazy landscape, until, on
passing above the cloud region, and finding the level of our track,
the earth was wholly lost to our view, and our course lay through
the blue serene of space, without a lighthouse or a landmark, and
nothing but the constant lamps of heaven to guide us in our
passage.
</p><p>What a sea!  The ocean has its visible surface on which move
the ships; but we had none.  The heavens were beneath us as well as
above.  We were floating in the great circle of the systems and the
suns.  We were of the universe; but were to be numbered with the
constellations and the stars.  We could compare ourselves to a
company of immortals quitting the earth and traversing the electric
seas which lead to brighter homes.  Or we were voyagers to the sun,
or to the nearer Venus, or to the far distant Centaurus.  What a
world of new thought was forced upon us by the fancies and
realities and charm and awe of our extraordinary condition,
combined with the profound consciousness we could not fail to
entertain of the effects which this crowning discovery of Messrs.
Bonflon and De Aery must produce on travel, on commerce, on art,
and the common destiny of mankind!
</p><p>I found the atmosphere of the cabins, as my friend Bonflon had
asserted, agreeable and healthful.  I could also occupy the
promenade deck for half an hour with little inconvenience, so far
as the levity of the air was concerned; but the cold was severe;
while the system, in consequence of an undue expansion of its
particles, solid and fluid, from the diminished pressure of the
atmosphere, was rendered doubly susceptible to its influence.  The
advice given by Mr. Bonflon to case myself in flannels, with an
armament at hand of outer winter-clothing, proved well-timed; and
yet a period of lassitude, verging on faintness, invariably
followed every considerable exposure to the open air.
</p><p>But the pleasure of gazing on those fields of space without
obstruction, without the intervention of so much as a plate of
crystal glass, repaid me for every risk and every ill.  Though it
might be said there was no scenery there, where nothing was visible
but the stars, yet far beyond the power of mountain and valley,
forest and lake, waterfall and ocean, did that scene, which was no
scene, or next to none, bind me in the spell of its fascination.
The motion of our craft, as we careered noiselessly through the
shoreless and objectless void, without sense of effort or friction,
was a charm of itself, &mdash; bringing to a flower, crystallizing into
refulgent stars, the dim, obscure, however glorious, poetry of
life.  Here were the wildest imaginations of the dreamer melted in
a crucible, and reproduced in living forms of usefulness and
beauty.  In my own years of widely diversified experience, what had
I met with to compare with this?  Nothing.  The force of steam was
marvellous, &mdash; talking over a wire mysterious; but here I was in a
great ship riding among the planets and the stars.  I had likened
Niagara to a vast mill-dam, because I could find no peer to set
beside it; so now, in my weakness, the sublime pageant of the
"Flying Cloud" could search out nothing higher in my recollection
with which to compare it than a wild ride of my youth in a canoe,
for a half-mile or so, down the rapids of a river.
</p><p>But morning was at hand.  The rich golden glow of night, to
which the dwellers on the earth's surface are accustomed, as we
passed to higher altitudes, had given place to a thin inky blue.
This was obscured by no fleck or mist, and yet the stars shone
through it faint and dim, despoiling the firmament of its glory.
The same loss of power was manifest on the ushering in of day.  The
auroral flame, which ordinarily greets us in the east with such a
ruddy laugh, was now nothing better than a wan and dismal smile;
<pb n="582"/>
and even the sun, as he struggled up from what seemed a bed of
leaden mist, brought with him only a pallid, lifeless twilight.  It
was not that his rays were impeded by cloud or haze; he had lost
his power to shine.  He hung there in the heavens like a great
white shield, and looked down on us as rayless and powerless and
devoid of life as a dead man's eye.
</p><p>Having at length wearied myself with gazing, and feeling chill
and weak from the coldness and tenuity of the atmosphere, I
subsided into the comfort and companionship of the cabins below.
Among the passengers I recognized <hi rend="italic">attaches</hi> of the press,
besides several gentlemen of Philadelphia, Baltimore, and
Washington, with whom I was somewhat acquainted.  More circumspect,
or less slaves to the imagination than myself, they had contented
themselves with in-door observations.  But their enthusiasm was
none the less inflamed.  In astonishment they looked at each other;
in restless bewilderment they glanced out of the windows on the
desert, trackless plane traversed by the "Flying Cloud," and spoke
with a species of awe of the shock which the announcement of what
they were then witnessing would give to sober men's minds; and
suggested, in broken sentences, some of the consequences which
would be likely to flow from the grand invention.
</p><p>What with the excitement and lack of sleep, we all found
ourselves a little nervous.  Coffee and Havanas failed to allay the
feeling; and, in the absence of the morning papers, we resorted to
whist, chess, and our pocket supplies of the "Atlantic Monthly,"
"Harper," and so forth, and to the very select library provided by
Messrs. Bonflon and De Aery, the proprietors, for the use of the
passengers, &mdash; and at last to our beds.  It could not be denied that
we were nervous.  With all the smoothness and beauty of our
running, there was a sensation, an uncertain quivering motion, not
at first noticed and not at all definable, about our craft, that
constantly suggested the idea that we were standing on nothing, or,
at best, nothing better than dissolving quicksands, which were
liable at any moment wholly to slide away and leave us; and it
required some strength of mind to resist the vagary, and prevent it
from effecting a troublesome lodgment in the imagination.
</p><p>Thus passed the day, which fortunately, in my case, was
succeeded by a night of repose.  The restlessness of mind and body
once subdued, Nature asserted her empire, and I slept profoundly
until morning.  Another day and night followed, with little
variation from the first; and by this time, the strangeness and
mystery of my situation had quite worn away, and the feeling of
security was established.  I trod the upper deck with all the
pride, and more than the composure, of a modern monarch on his
throne.
</p><p>But the sameness of the scenery of the vast aerial ocean, in
which we were sailing alone, without consort, without ever
descrying a sail, or even keeping a lookout, without so much as
ever discovering a floating plank to remind us of a wreck, or a
seaweed to tell us of the land, was already beginning to pall on
the senses, when there appeared in the distance before us, and
multiplying to the right and the left, a succession of white,
sparkling pyramids and cones, resting on the clouds and flashing in
the nether light, like crystal monuments set to mark the boundaries
of space.  These were crests of the Rocky Mountains, covered with
perpetual snow.
</p><p>I gazed on them with rapture.  Right in our eye, nearly due
west, stood out Long's Peak, James's Peak, and the Spanish Peaks,
at first small in size, but momently swelling in dimensions; while,
far to the north, were just discernible the more lofty summits of
Mount Hooker and Mount Brown.  Lying between Mount James and the
Spanish Peaks, inclining to their eastern slope, lay the green
plateau, not yet visible, where we were to land.  Its position was
carefully pointed out to Mr. Bonflon and myself by Mr. De Aery, but
we strained our eyes and used our glasses in vain.  No strength
<pb n="583"/>
of sight could penetrate the clouds and haze which covered the
body of the mountains, and hid the earth, with the exception of
those lofty silver pinnacles, from our view.
</p><p>Though these high peaks, like distant masts at sea, were first
seen early in the day, the meridian of noon overtook us before we
came up with them.  At length, in increasing numbers and a thousand
diversified shapes, they lay spread out before us, and soon
thereafter were directly under our feet.  Our magical machine,
coming to a halt, fluttered like a great bird above them, and gave
us an opportunity, such as probably had never been enjoyed by
voyagers before, to spy out their beauty, their mystery, and their
strength.
</p><p>On nearing the mountains, we had left behind us the twilight
of the void, and come again into the full flood of day.  This
enabled the sight to rest upon the scene with pleasure, to examine
its diversified splendors, and penetrate its chasms and gorges,
otherwise inaccessible to man.  But to describe them is impossible.
Broad fields of sparkling snow, pyramids of ice, wide fissures
shining like steel mirrors, &mdash; produced by some unimaginable
convulsion, possibly a thousand or ten thousand years ago, and
large enough to ingulf a city, &mdash; with black humps or spires of
granite here and there projecting through the white; while afar
down the rocky sides of interminable swells and precipices came up
a sound of water and a blush of green, betokening the direction in
which we were to look for the generative body of Mother Earth; all
these, and much more which I cannot stop to name, were grouped in
the rough, but magnificent landscape before us.
</p><p>No cabin could confine me at such a time as this.  I stood out
on the upper deck in the extreme bow of the boat; and from an
unobstructed point of view, nearly over the figure-head, in the
very abandonment of daring, feasted my senses on the wondrous
glories of this mountain-scene of enchantment.
</p><p>De Aery was at the helm.  But I have scarcely introduced this
extraordinary gentleman to the reader.  He was a tall, black-haired, mercurial Frenchman, with an eye like a falcon, who, with
only an occasional Gallicism purposely indulged in, spoke American
like a native.  I had every confidence in his prudence and skill in
the management of his craft; and still, as I perceived that we were
gradually settling down in the direction of the loftiest of those
snow-peaks, until scarcely fifty feet intervened between us and its
round, polished brow, to all appearance as solid as feldspar, I
raised my voice and accosted him.
</p><p>"Halloo!  Captain!" said I, "are you intending to land us on
this Atlas-top?"
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Effectivement</hi>," replied he.  <hi rend="italic">"Mon Dieu</hi>!  B&mdash;, come
here."
</p><p>I went to him.
</p><p>"This," said he, "is the very Old Man of the Mountain.  I
intend to plant the stars and stripes in the centre of his bald
head."
</p><p>"Capital!" replied I.  "But can you achieve it safely?"
</p><p>"Yes.  I can manage my bird with as much ease as a pigeon
poises himself on his wings, or an Indian steers his canoe.  See!
we are approaching the crown of the pinnacle."
</p><p>I watched the experiment with an interest not unmingled with
fear.  He held in one hand a handsome American flag, of moderate
size, and occasionally, with a slight motion of his arm, and a
glance of pride, spread out its silken folds on the motionless air.
Gradually the "Flying Cloud," under his skilful hands, closed upon
the bleak, glittering summit, which, rounding off like the bald
head of some venerable giant, was, at its apex, scarcely ten feet
in diameter.
</p><p>"No eagle, even, has ever set his foot here," said De Aery.
"There is not a track, or feather, or mark of any living thing to
be seen.  The 'Flying Cloud' will be the first to explore many
mysteries and to explode others.  Not even do the winds reach this
height.  Boreas and the bird of Jove, &mdash; I will vanquish them
<pb n="584"/>
both.  I will step out upon that icy peak."
</p><p>"No, no, Captain," I expostulated.  "You might lose your
foothold and perish."
</p><p>"Not at all," rejoined he, with a laugh.  "I am as sure-footed
as a goat.  But if you think it risky, Monsieur, I forbear.  But
the snow looks solid as adamant.  I fear I shall not be able to
erect this flag, unless I have a firm spot for my feet."
</p><p>By this time our craft had reached a proper position, &mdash; her
stern alongside and almost in contact with the jutting peak, &mdash; to
answer the ambitious purpose of the Frenchman.  Raising the flag of
the Republic in his hand, he requested us all to do it proper
honor, &mdash; to salute it with a "three times three," &mdash; as he should
succeed in securing it in its place.  Cautiously extending the
staff, he brought it in contact with the snow, and gave it several
light blows, for the purpose of ascertaining its solidity.  It
seemed of almost icy texture, and emitted a half-sharp and half-muffled sound in reply.  Then, elevating the standard aloft in both
hands, he brought it down with force as the farmer urges a stake
into the ground; not doubting, as would seem, that a succession of
such blows would be needed in order to achieve his purpose.
</p><p>A single stroke of the shaft, however, proved more than
enough.  To the surprise and dismay of us all, the firm ringing
surface turned out but a shell, and all beneath, a loose bed of
sparkling snow-crystals, like white sand.  The flag sunk down and
disappeared, and De Aery, losing his balance, plunged over and went
with it.
</p><p>We gazed after him in speechless horror.  Before any one of us
had sufficiently recovered himself to speak, we were startled by a
dull sound, like a rushing wind, or distant, rumbling thunder; and
an immense mass of snow, many hundred feet in depth, and covering
a third of the cone, parted from its place, and, like a great,
foaming wave, broken and shapeless, rushed down the mountain's
side.  For the moment, all eyes were fixed upon it.  At first, it
swept on without cohering, like a cataract of sand; but, on coming
in contact with the moister snow below, it formed into a thousand
balls and masses, some rolling and some sliding, but each gathering
bulk and velocity as it went.
</p><p>By the aid of our glasses we were able to sweep the rough
slopes and precipitous descents below, to the distance of many
miles; and, forgetting De Aery, we watched the development of the
phenomenon with terror.  The larger slides gradually absorbed the
smaller ones, as common fish are swallowed by sharks; but those
which remained, fattened and expanded by what they fed on, assumed
enormous dimensions.  Choosing different paths, they pursued their
course in smoking tracks of devastation.  Rocks, precipices,
forests, furnished no obstruction.  Roaring, crashing onward, as
though Mars or the Sun had opened its batteries upon us, those
sliding, whirling worlds of snow swept through valleys large enough
to have furnished sites for cities, without a check, and bore down
or overleaped all obstacles, as easily as a man would walk over an
ant-hill, or some hollow where a toad had burrowed.  Finally they
were lost to sight, passing behind intervening spurs or ridges of
the mountain, or becoming hidden in the cloud-mists which lay
heavily about its base; but the sound continued to roll back upon
us for some time, like the roar of distant artillery.  I could no
longer wonder at the terror with which the cry of an avalanche is
said to fill the dwellers among the Alps.
</p><p>As this absorbing pageant of the mountains disappeared, our
thoughts reverted to De Aery.  Had he been carried away by the
snow-slip? or was his mangled corse below us among the black crags
laid bare by that catastrophe?  Turning my gaze beneath, I
discovered, far down, many hundred feet, a moving object, scarcely
bigger than a fly, and, on bringing my glass to bear upon it,
perceived that it was the Frenchman.  He was standing
<pb n="585"/>
on a
bare rib of rock, with his flag still in his hand, and apparently
unharmed.  Waving the ensign to attract our attention, at the same
time he shouted with the whole strength of his lungs.  But his
voice scarcely reached us, and probably would not alone have
attracted our notice.  We replied with encouraging cheers; and the
"three times three," which we had intended for the American eagle,
was given on the spot to De Aery.
</p><p>But how to rescue him from his perilous condition was indeed
a serious question.  The "Flying Cloud," it was obvious, with her
great size and spreading pinions, could not venture among those
ticklish quicksands, whose insecure foundations had just been so
strikingly illustrated before us.  Indeed, the slightest jar might
precipitate another fall of snow, and bury the object of our
solicitude five hundred feet deep in its bosom.  The sagacity of
Mr. Bonflon relieved us from our dilemma.  He hoisted out the small
car or tender, and, letting it down with great care and precision,
safely accomplished the object.  In the space of half an hour, De
Aery, without a scratch, and, like a gallant Gaul, rather proud of
his adventure than frightened at it, was again restored to our
arms.
</p><p>Drawing off from our dangerous proximity to the "Old Man of
the Mountain," which had so nearly proved fatal to at least one of
our number, but astonished beyond measure at the novelty of our
experiences and the grandeur of the scenes we had witnessed, we
retraced our course for a short distance, and, gradually lessening
the interval between us and the earth, soon had the satisfaction of
hearing the cry of "Land, ho!" from the look-out man.  The valley
was in sight where we were to take in water and enjoy a little
picnic on the green grass, ere the form and smell of Mother Earth,
with her homely but blessed realities, should be quite forgotten.
</p><p>We effected our landing in complete safety.  The spot was a
little, luxurious nook among the lesser hills, with few trees, but
full of wild flowers, wild fruits, and wild grasses.  Everything
about it was wild, but cheering and charming, especially to air-wanderers like us.  The foot of the white hunter, or even of the
roving Indian, had perhaps never visited it, nor foraging-parties
of the buffalo or deer, for we saw no signs of them; but birds of
varied plumage and song, and troops of squirrels, with footprints
here and there of the grizzly bear, and a drove of wild turkeys,
with red heads aloft, rushing over an eminence at our left as we
approached, and an occasional whir of a rattlesnake at our feet,
sufficiently indicated the kind of denizens by which the plateau
was inhabited.
</p><p>Here, on the rich sward and delicate mosses, under the shadow
of some willows, we spread out our repast by the side of a clear
mountain-spring; and, to say nothing of old Otard and Schiedam
Schnapps, opened some bottles of Sparkling Catawba, and old Jersey
Champagne, of a remote vintage, which I have now quite forgotten.
With the flow of these beverages flowed our speech, in jovial words
and songs and raillery enough, if not in wit.  De Aery, as having
by a hair's breadth just escaped with his life, and in virtue of
his extraordinary feat in leaping five hundred feet or more through
a bank of snow, now that the danger was over, was made the butt of
much pleasantry, which he bore with his usual equanimity and grace.
</p><p>When these arrowy flights at the expense of the light-hearted
Frenchman had exhausted themselves, I took occasion to inquire of
him what his sensations were during his brief burial.  He replied
as follows: &mdash;
</p><p>"I thought nothing at all about it.  I remember feeling
chagrined because I was making a failure, and clung tight to my
flag, fearing to lose that too.  <hi rend="italic">Mon Dieu!</hi>  It might be
expected that one would feel cold, buried up in ice; but such was
not the case.  I was hot.  The snow burned my face, as it came in
contact with it.  As to the ride, it was pleasant enough, but
rather rapid and perplexing to the breath.  It was like sinking
<pb n="586"/>
into a pit of quicksand, where everything gives way below
one, as though the bottom of the world had fallen out.  There was
the struggle of a moment to keep the fine snow out of my mouth and
nostrils, as I drew in my breath, and the next instant my feet came
in contact with the solid rock, where you discovered me.  The
magnificent avalanche you describe I know nothing about.  I neither
heard nor saw anything of it, only as I afterward examined the
marks it had left behind it.  This leads me to suppose that I was
a good deal confused at the time, though I was not aware of it.
Indeed, I have an impression of seeming to turn somersets in my
descent, and this may account for it.  But, for the honor of
France, I saved my adopted country's flag."
</p><p>High-minded Gaul!  We all praised and honored him, and
comforted him for his disappointment.  It was a noble attempt he
had made, to nail the American banner to the head of Mount James,
impelled by the loftiest of motives, &mdash; and, like many others of its
kind, had for the present failed.  At some other time he might
prove more successful; or some other might achieve the object in
his place, and so appropriate his laurels; but no one would be
likely to excel him in his flying leap.  In this he had distanced
even the famous traveller at Rhodes.
</p><p>Having given a couple of hours to this species of recreation,
we weighed anchor, and again got under way.  Slowly and smoothly,
without a ripple or a jar, we ascended through the blue ether to
our former altitude, and floated off over those majestic mountain-tops, toward the west.  Loath to part from scenes of such
impressive beauty, &mdash; scenes, alone paralleled in our recollection by
fabulous tales of Oriental enchantment, &mdash; we gazed behind us at
those flashing crests of alabaster, until they grew small in the
distance, and finally were wholly lost to our sight.  With them
disappeared the last vestige of the solid earth, and we were again
afloat in space.
</p><p>The following night and day were passed like their
predecessors.  Another night came, and we were over the eastern
bound of the State of California.  A few hours more, without
accident, would terminate our remarkable voyage, and set us down in
the city of San Francisco.  All of us were brimming high with hope.
Though we did not anticipate reaching the station before one or two
o'clock in the morning, and probably should not disembark before
dawn, we were loath to retire to rest.  It was near midnight before
all of us were in our berths.
</p><p>But when at length there, I found it impossible to sleep.  The
excitement attendant on the beginning of the trip seemed to have
returned on me with a double force.  I listened for some sound to
relieve the awful stillness which, like the wing of Death, seemed
to have settled over the "Flying Cloud"; but there was no soughing
of the wind, as at sea, and no noise to be heard, save the
monotonous movement of the engine and the paddle-wheels; and this,
so evenly did they play, was rather a motion than a sound.
</p><p>This period of restlessness was succeeded by one of strange
bewilderment, which might have been sleep, or might not.  Rapidly
changing scenes and fantastic figures some of them beautiful and
some horrible, flitted before me like a dissolving panorama.  A
band, as though of steel wire, seemed to encircle my brain, and to
compress it closer and closer; and the spine, for its whole length,
felt as though subjected to a like crushing pressure.
</p><p>How long this state of hallucination continued I have no means
of knowing.  From it, by a great effort, I suddenly aroused myself,
and returned to my proper senses.  Where I was, and all the
extraordinary events of the last few days, were clear in my
recollection.  But I was weighed down with weakness, and found, on
attempting to speak, that I had no voice.
</p><p>Suspecting that I had been stricken by some terrible disease,
I attempted to
<pb n="587"/>
rise; and, loath to disturb any of my
fellow-travellers, undertook to crawl out upon the upper deck.
This, after a good deal of effort, I accomplished.  Lying,
therefore, &mdash; I could not stand, &mdash; I prayed for a breath of air to
relieve my hot and oppressed brow; but in vain.  The atmosphere
seemed gone.  Chill and dark, the heavens spread out above me
without a twinkle or a smile.  The full-moon was there, and there
was no cloud or haze to obscure her light; but she did not shine.
Her white, rayless face was a mockery to the night.  The same was
true of the stars.  The dazzling canopy was faded out, and Cygnus
and the Great Bear were subdued to pallid points, like patches of
white-gray paper stuck upon a wall.
</p><p>Floating by the side of the "Flying Cloud," and nearly of her
size, I discovered a dark, irregular object, and dragged myself to
the edge of the deck to investigate it more closely.  The two came
together, but without damage or friction.  They touched and parted,
like substances nearly at rest in still water.  I put out my hand
on the strange visitor, and received a pretty severe shock, as
though I had been subjected to the action of an electric battery.
At the same time, a light, bluish flame ran over it surface,
showing me more accurately its form and dimensions.  To the touch,
it was solid and cold, like iron or granite.  I pressed upon it,
and it yielded like a floating dish.  I tried to break off a
fragment, but was unable to separate so much as a scale.
</p><p>A moment's reflection convinced me of the nature of this
apparent island in the air.  It was an immense aerolite; and with
this conviction came the solution of my own painful state.  We had
unconsciously passed beyond the controlling power of the earth's
gravitation, into the region of the upper atmosphere, where,
science informs us, these meteoric stones float in equilibrium,
until some accidental impulse throws them from their balance, when
they are precipitated to the surface of the earth.  I must be dying
for lack of air.  And the man at the helm, where was he?  He must
have fallen asleep, and left our vessel to her own buoyant fancies.
And my companions!  Bonflon!  De Aery!  All ere this might have
perished, and the "Flying Cloud," aside from myself, be bearing
into these upper altitudes nothing but a load of death.
</p><p>Terror-struck, I dragged myself, with all the speed I could
accomplish, to the stern.  There sat the helmsman at his post, but
asleep or insensible.  I shook him, but he gave no signs of life.
I shouted with what little strength I had, but in vain.
</p><p>"Wake up! wake up!" I cried, "or we are lost!"
</p><p>At length he opened his eyes, but did not move.
</p><p>"Wake up!" I screamed again.  "Breakers ahead, and worse.  You
have let the craft run wild.  We are above our level.  We are all
dying for lack of air."
</p><p>"Oh, let me sleep!" he murmured.  "I must sleep a little while
longer.  It can't &mdash; can't be morning yet."
</p><p>"By this time, fright, or the necessity of the occasion, was
renewing my strength.
</p><p>"Dick!" I shouted in his ear, "Dick, you scoundrel! you will
murder us all.  Do your duty, or I will shoot you!"
</p><p>With this I discharged a barrel of my revolver above his head,
which, like my voice in my efforts at hallooing, sounded only as a
faint echo of itself, but, nevertheless, proved sufficient to give
his dormant faculties a shock.  He started up, and, though still
but half-conscious, took the helm and gave it the direction I bade
him.
</p><p>From him I hastened to the engineer, whom I found in a like
state of insensibility.  I succeeded in arousing him; but it was
necessary that he should be made to comprehend the difficulties of
our situation, &mdash; that our craft, water-logged as it were, would
float forever where she was, for all anybody could say to the
contrary, until forced down by the power of the engine alone to
lower and life-giving
<pb n="588"/>
atmospheric planes.  To get him to
understand this was not so easy.  But I succeeded in part, and, in
my anxiety for my friends, rushed below to look after their
condition.
</p><p>As I anticipated, I found every one of them in a state of
incipient asphyxia.  But the "Flying Cloud" was already descending
into denser air.  Oxygen and pressure were performing their mystic
work; and within half an hour I had the pleasure of seeing them all
restored to consciousness and rapidly returning strength.  But the
renewed lights exposed a sight almost too frightful to mention.
Every man of us was crimson from escaped blood, which seemed to
have oozed forth, like a pale-red dew, from every pore of our
bodies.
</p><p>Messrs. Bonflon and De Aery, when they came to realize the
danger from which we had so narrowly escaped, were nearly dumb with
horror.  The lively Frenchman exhibited a sensibility which the
extremity of his single peril, a day or two before, had failed to
call up.  He wept aloud.  Mr. Bonflon was circumspect and
thoughtful.  He did not lose his Yankee balance; but both of them,
each in his own way, overwhelmed me with expressions of obligation.
</p><p>But the dangers of this dreadful night &mdash; a night which can
never pass from my recollection &mdash; were not yet over.  We were all
gathered in the main cabin, congratulating each other, next after
our escape, on our rapidly returning strength, &mdash; happy in the
thought that our trip out, though sprinkled with danger, was so
near a prosperous completion, and almost momently expecting to hear
the stroke of the bell which should announce to us that the red
light to designate our place of landing was in sight, when, instead
of the silver ring of this messenger of peace, we were startled and
horrified by an alarm of fire.
</p><p>Bonflon and De Aery rushed to the engine-room.  A cloud of
smoke poured out from the door by which they disappeared.  They
were gone only for a moment; for no man could remain in the hell of
flames and vapors into which they ventured and live.  They came out
dragging with them the half-suffocated, scorched, and blazing
engineer.  How the accident occurred, it was impossible to divine
and useless to inquire.  Closing the door tightly after them to
confine the flames, where confinement, except for the briefest
period, among matter so combustible, and partitions scarcely more
formidable than those of a paper bandbox, was clearly impossible,
they threw the burning engineer into our arms, and themselves took
the management of the craft.
</p><p>De Aery, in this crisis, rose from the man to the hero, almost
to a demigod.  His orders rung through the startled air clear and
round like the voice of a golden bell.  Bonflon seconded him with
coolness and decision.  With us a moment sufficed to extinguish the
burning garments of the engineer; but by that time the flames had
burst from the engine-room, and that part of the beautiful boat was
a ragged, crackling ruin.
</p><p>Fleeing to the upper deck, and taking refuge in the bow, we
became sensible that we were descending through the air with
frightful rapidity.  When the accident occurred, we were already at
a low level, on the look-out for the signal at our station.  This
circumstance was in our favor, if anything could be, when a danger
so imminent and dreadful was pressing.  Land, like a hazy shadow,
was just discoverable in the dim distance below us; and oh for one
foot of it as a place of rest!  But if it were possible to escape
the flames, it was clear enough that we must be dashed in pieces
against the solid earth.
</p><p>De Aery was now the only one remaining in the stern.  He was
exposed to great peril, but refused to quit his post while it
remained possible to control in any degree the motions of the
vessel.  The flames played about him without shaking his courage or
his coolness, and broke through upon the upper deck and separated
him from us with a seething hedge and whirlpool of fire.  We lost
sight of him, and supposed he had perished,
<pb n="589"/>
when suddenly
his voice, issuing from the midst of the furnace, rung on our ears
like a trumpet.
</p><p>"Up the ropes! quit the ship, or you die, every man of you!"
he shouted; and at the same time we discovered him emerging from
the flames and smoke, and ascending the network which enveloped the
balloon and connected it with the ship.  We followed his example;
some of our number &mdash; the more timid or the more daring, it would be
difficult to say which &mdash; continuing the ascent until they had
reached the upper surface of the gas-chamber, and placed its entire
fragile bulk between them and the hazard they most dreaded.
</p><p>The momentary refuge afforded by these upper works was
scarcely attained, when the bow, where we had stood but a minute
before, and the whole hull of the "Flying Cloud" with it, blended
together in one mass of surging fire.  The appearance in the
heavens of this strange sight, to a watcher at some <hi rend="italic">rancho</hi>, or
in the not distant city of San Francisco, if such there were, must
have afforded a more vivid illustration of the fall of a blazing
star or meteoric wonder than astronomer has ever put on record.
</p><p>But I delay the catastrophe.  Land and water soon became
distinguishable from each other beneath us, and hills from valleys,
and forests from bare plains.  There was little wind, except the
fierce currents rushing upward, produced by the heat of our own
conflagration.  This, for the time, subdued everything to itself,
and, as we approached the ground, served by its direction to modify
the fury of our descent.  The denser lower atmosphere also
contributed to the same end; and, most fortunately, when we reached
the earth, and the collision came, we struck in water instead of on
the land.
</p><p>Still, the collision was a fierce one.  With the mass of fire
between us and the ground directly below, blinded by the smoke and
half suffocated by the heat, we were not conscious of the good
fortune that awaited us, until, with a swoop and a plunge, we found
ourselves submerged, and, with an equal velocity, immediately
thrown back again by the buoyant force of the balloon into the open
air.  The flood of fire in which we had descended was instantly
extinguished; and we awoke to a sense of our possible safety in
darkness rendered doubly profound by the contrast.
</p><p>Daylight was near at hand.  By a careful adjustment of our
weights we kept the balloon from rolling, and sustained ourselves
above the water among the netting.  As morning came, we discovered
we had landed in a small lake, hardly large enough to be dignified
with the name, but obviously of considerable depth.  The shore was
not distant; and as the day was sultry, with a little grateful
labor at swimming and towing, on the part of a few of us, we soon
reached it.  There we examined into each other's condition.  Scarce
one of us but was able to show damage by fire, or from too rough
contact with the fragments of the "Flying Cloud," which preceded us
in our plunge into the lake.  But no bones were broken, and no one
badly flayed.  The case of the engineer was the worst; but even he
was able to keep upon his feet, and pronounced in no danger.
</p><p>No hut or field or sign of inhabitants was to be seen.  With
mixed feelings, in which, for the present at least, the sense of
personal safety triumphed over all regrets, even with Messrs.
Bonflon and De Aery, at the shipwreck of so many brilliant hopes,
we scuttled that part of our craft still afloat, and sunk it in the
lake; and with weary footsteps, but unobstructed with baggage, as
near as we could determine by the aid of a compass, took the
direction toward San Francisco.  A couple of hours brought us to
the <hi rend="italic">rancho</hi> of Senor Jose Dianza, who received us as a band of
pilgrims over the Plains, who, at the hands of robbers and the
elements, had lost everything but life, and helped us on to the
city of the land of gold.
</p><p>It is needless to detain the reader with the particulars of
our return.  They were such only as occur to thousands in the
<pb n="590"/>
rough and circuitous transit between San Francisco and New
York.  We came home by the Isthmus route, and in ships that
ploughed the honest waves.  We explained our absence to our
disturbed families and friends as best we might; and some will
remember &mdash; and if they do not, they can refresh their recollection
by a reference to the public prints &mdash; that several missing gentlemen
of some importance in the world, about that time, suddenly
reappeared upon the stage of action.
</p><p>We resolved that the whole affair in which we had been engaged
should remain forever buried in oblivion.  But time and reflection
have wrought a change with me, though I shall not presume to
disturb the veil which covers my associates.  I have come to
consider the adventure quite too good to be lost, and the
experiment in aerial navigation, which came so near proving
successful, of too much importance to science to be suppressed.
Hence, conquering my repugnance, I have decided, on my own
responsibility, to give these interesting and valuable particulars
to the world.
