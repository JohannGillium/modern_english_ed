<p><hi rend="italic">EDITOR'S NOTE.&mdash;It is time vigorous efforts were made to stop the
cruel frauds perpetrated on the name of one of the world's greatest
industries. Mining is a legitimate and honorable enterprise. It
contributes immensely to the national wealth. It has been the source of
some of our great fortunes.  Because there is something magical in the
suggestion of gold or coal or copper taken out of the ground, sharpers
have made mining an instrument of successful deception. They have
tricked people into investing their savings in worthless or even
non-existent mines. Perhaps you who read this have bitten at an
advertisement in a reputable publication, which pretended to place the
wealth of some western El Dorado at your feet for a few hundred dollars.
Doubtless your money has disappeared. It is for the purpose of giving
you the protection of a knowledge both of legitimate mining and of the
ways of thieves that this article is published</hi>.

<head>THE GOLD BRICK AND THE<lb/>
GOLD MINE<lb/>
<lb/>
Fake Mining Schemes that Steal the People's Savings<lb/>
<lb/>
By EMERSON HOUGH<lb/>
<lb/>
Author of "The Mississippi Bubble," "54-40 or Fight," etc.<lb/>

<div2 type="section" id="d6">

<p>AMERICA is the land of the free and the country of opportunity
for all.  Incidentally, it is free hunting-ground for sharpers, and a
land of opportunity for the unscrupulous. No such chances for fraudulent
business exist anywhere else in the world. Americans are the richest
people on earth, and the most easily parted from their money. Those
whose sole ambition is to get rich quick very frequently help some other
man to get rich quick. Society owes no debt to either of these. It is
obliged to support them both. This is wrong both as a moral and as an
industrial proposition. Once, a dollar was spent to mine a dollar.
To-day two are spent: One dollar goes into blasting powder, the other
into advertising and office furniture.

</p><p>No doubt you have heard the age-old legend of the Mother Vein of
Gold, which appears and vanishes, now and again, in this corner of the
world. Superstition regarding this great original vein of gold is found
wherever men seek the precious metal. The feverish Spaniards called this
phantom lode the Madre d'Oro, or "Mother of Gold."  Now it is located in
Mexico, now in India or Peru, California or Australia. Tradition says
that Montezuma got his gold from this great vein, which lay in a secret
valley whose whereabouts was jealously guarded by three priests of the
war tribe, sole possessors of the knowledge.  Any intruder who by chance
or design looked down into this valley was smitten absolutely blind.
Tradition among the successors of the Aztecs says that when Montezuma
passed, the Madre d'Oro sank back again into the earth, and has been
seen no more. Men still follow the phantom vein.  Those who see it, even
in their dreams, still are smitten blind.

</p><p>Gold! There is no other word that means quite so much. We want
gold; indeed, we must have it. Malleable, divisible, indestructible,
rare, it is the indispensable medium of exchange. It is our chosen unit
of power and success, the measure of civilization and human attainment.
Hence it has always been the object of human desire. The Golden Fleece
very probably was the sheepskin bottom of an old-time sluice-box, in a
day when they used wool, instead of blankets, below the rocker troughs.
In the vast ruined civilization of Southeast Africa unknown men once
mined probably $400,000,000 worth of gold. There are mines profitably
operated in Greece to-day which the Ph&oelig;nicians opened 1,200 B. C.
Sixteen hundred years later the Romans owned all the mines in Europe.
Hannibal once paid his warriors in gold coin of Carthage. Egypt was
settled by the Semitic races 2,500 B. C., because of the gold that was
found there. A thousand years later Job

   <pb n="45"/>

knew about gold, and five hundred years later still, King Solomon showed
what an abundance of wives and what a reputation for wisdom a man can
get when he has unlimited gold mines back of him. Columbus found America
when he was searching for the wealth of Ormus and of Ind. Cortez and
Pizarro toiled and slew in the hope of finding the Madre d'Oro. The
great discoveries of the world have been made by men in search of gold.
The great voyages of exploration were in part piratical voyages made in
search of gold already found and mined by others.</p>

</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d7">
<head>HONEST MINING IN HANNIBAL'S TIME</head>

<p>But there is to be said about gold mining ways of the old time, that
Tyre sought gold with actual ships, with actual men and mining
implements. The peninsula of Sinai did not sell stock, but mined actual
gold. Gold in those days meant actual risk and courage.  Perhaps even
then fraudulent promoters weren't unknown; but he who ventured, in the
days of Vespasian or Hannibal or Hiram, too prominently to gild the gold
brick certainly lost his head. The mining of gold was then a sober and
serious and honest matter.

</p><p>In America we place the gold brick ahead of the gold mine. We mix
alloy of duplicity and greed with the virgin metal of our standard of
value. By improved mining methods we nearly double our output of gold,
and so cheapen it by well-nigh a half. This shrunken gold dollar is
small enough; but that is not all. We adulterate and divide it by, say,
another half when we falsely double its cost.  This we certainly do when
we issue counterfeit promises as against good coin; for in civilization
and commerce always the genuine coinage has to pay the cost of the
counterfeit.  Your tailor charges you a stiff price for your suit of
clothes. That covers the clothes of the dead beats who did not pay. To
allow the sale of a fraudulent mining stock is to depreciate the basis
of this country's values. Such a wrong ought not to be allowed in a
country claiming an enlightened government.

</p><p>It is the thief who is protected in America, not his dupe. The
old law of <hi rend="italic">caveat emptor</hi> protects the <hi
rend="italic">seller</hi> of fake mining stocks, not the <hi
rend="italic">buyer</hi> of them. There is little or no actually
enforced law to protect the latter.  That is to say, there is little or
no actually enforced law to protect those who most need protection,
those of small incomes, orphans who have no guardians, wage earners who
have little education, widows whose life insurance is not quite enough
to support them, women engaged in the desperate battle of life and
needing more money, quick money, better to protect themselves. The fence
between these and the natural perils of the world is slight enough. In
America we break it down entirely.

</p><p>We offer these helpless ones freely as victims to the greater
cunning and strength of men wholly without sense of business honor or
personal decency. When we do this, we also attack the whole system of
savings banks, which is, or should be, the very bulwark of a nation's
financial safety. Says the wolf to the widow, to the busy professional
man, to the clerk, the stenographer, the wage earner:  "Take your money
out of the savings bank.  What is three per cent. a year, when I can
make you three hundred per cent. a year?  Give your money to me!" We
permit that.  Our national government does not undertake to put a stop
to it; our states do not undertake to do so; and this fact is more
possible through actual lack of proper statutes than through any
misinterpretation or lack of enforcement of the law.

</p><p>The field is one devised by nature for the trickster. His success
does not depend altogether on human gullibility; part of his argument
rests on the conditions which surround the industry of mining, one which
never can be free of extreme risk. All men know that gold is found far
away, where living is high and means of transportation are scarce; that
it costs large sums to find and dig it, and that such sums are more
easily raised among the many than among the few.  None of these
attending features has weight to stop the capitalization of bona-fide
enterprises. These latter are used as bait by men who have nothing
bona-fide to offer, and who make their fattest profits out of their
shallowest shafts.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d8">
<head>THE "SUCKER LIST" IN WALL STREET</head><lb/>

<p>Methods vary among such fraudulent operators, but new victims
continually are found. The "sucker list" of one firm in Wall Street
numbers 110,000 names, selected as those of persons who will bite more
than once at a mining scheme, and whose records show that they have so
bitten. This operator proudly declares that the only way a sucker can
get his name off that list is to die. In the

   <pb n="46"/>

reorganization of the firm of Douglas, Lacey &amp; Co., of New York City, it
was discovered that 20,000 persons had money invested in stocks of the
company.

</p><p>The best bait in this particular operation was a "trust fund"
established for the benefit of stockholders. The proceeds of the
better-paying mines were to be applied to pay dividends for those which
were less successful.  In this way, the various directors of the many
Douglas-Lacey Companies explained, it was impossible for the investors
to lose. But they did lose. The reorganization, intended to save some of
the better properties, wiped out more than seventy per cent. of the
small stockholders&mdash;widows, schoolteachers, stenographers, washwomen,
scrubwomen&mdash;all who once had a dollar in the stocking.

</p><p>Burr Brothers, Inc., of New York, used the effective bait of the
instalment plan of payment. Their literature and advertising offered
sudden wealth at twenty cents a share, payments to be in instalments,
"the best twenty offers" to be accepted. It was pointed out that if one
made one's weekly payment large enough to be included among the
fortunate twenty, one could have a nice, clean certificate sent to one
immediately, and pay for it at one's leisure. If you think the operators
could not afford to do that, you are ignorant. There was an old negro
woman in the South who often importuned her white friends for funds to
build a certain somewhat mythical church. They asked her what she
received for the time spent in collecting. "I has what I gits," was her
frank response.  She enunciated a great modern mining principle which
has made fortunes in Denver, Butte, New York, Boston, and many other
places where handsome lithographic work is done, and where advertising
space can be bought in journals considered reputable.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d9">
<head>NEW ENGLAND "DONE" BY AN INSANE MAN</head><lb/>

<p>Sometimes there are victims in enterprises of this sort where there
probably was no deliberate intent to deceive or to defraud.  Not long
ago, in Boston, one Henry D.  Reynolds, formerly president of the
Reynolds Alaska Development Company, was brought before the United
States Circuit Court on the charge of using the United States mails with
intent to defraud. Three alienists are said to have declared him insane.
In 1907 ex-Governor John G. Brady, of Alaska, endorsed Reynolds and his
schemes, and is reported to have collected in New England about $450,000
for these Reynolds projects. Brady gave "lectures" and stereopticon
exhibitions in New England churches.  Reynolds took out an excursion of
Boston and New England investors to Prince William Sound, at one time,
and showed them the seacoast of Alaska, practically all of which he
claimed to own. At Boulder Bay he took his party into a long tunnel, the
face of which they were told was composed of solid copper ore. When they
emerged into the garish light of day, each was given a bright copper
nugget, said to have come from the mine.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d10">
<head>ALASKA REYNOLDSIZED</head><lb/>

<p>Really, according to local report, these nuggets of native copper had
been taken from sluice boxes on Chittitu Creek, 235 miles inland.
Reynolds, so ran the story, had treated them with an acid bath to
brighten them, knowing that bright bait is better. At any rate, the
good, sober New Englanders went back home and sent him $300,000 more,
which set him entirely "dippy," in local phrase.

</p><p>Reynolds's scheme was to run all the barber shops, laundries,
bars, and pretty much everything else on the Alaskan coast. A certain
Sam Blum had a store and bank; Reynolds wanted it; and Blum, it is
alleged, annexed $50,000 of the New England money as a forfeited first
payment on his property.  A steamship company, it was said, got $75,000
of money on a forfeit. So the good New England savings merrily
disappeared, in one of the most spectacular farces ever known in Alaska;
which latter is too good and valid and valuable a national possession to
permit to be Reynoldsized, as it has been. Reynolds, in the belief of
one who knew him well, was a combination of the ignorant enthusiast, the
wild promoter, and the crazy man; and as for Brady, another Alaskan
called him "nothing worse than an innocent old ninny." Yet, even with so
sorry a mental equipment, these two took something like half a million
out of conservative New England! The ease with which money can be raised
for such enterprises by the deliberately fraudulent or the
unintentionally insane continues one of the wonders of our civilization.

</p><p>Another kind of bait offered is that of the "prominent name."
This has proved more useful in England than in this country.  Whittaker
Wright was able to secure members

   <pb n="47"/>

of the nobility for his boards of directors, and the English public
swallowed his schemes one after another, bait, hook, bob, and sinker.
In this country we have no lords whom we dearly love, so the names of
prominent literary or scientific men sometimes are employed by wise
promoters. A "prominent mining expert" is excellent bait. Some good men
have been used in this way, and the bait of their reputation in other
lines of activity has served to make ignorant and innocent people of
small means swallow the hook hid in the lying statements which they have
perhaps innocently, certainly ignorantly, fathered.  We are all familiar
with the literature of this class, sent to us under the guise of
personal and intimate confidence. Always that part of the communication
is followed by the blackfaced type where the stinger lies concealed. The
words AT ONCE usually come in capitals, as do LAST CHANCE, and PRICE
POSITIVELY WILL ADVANCE AFTER TEN DAYS. Millions and millions of dollars
have been extracted from the public by these means. There is no law
against it.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d11">
<head>"ADJOINING" MINES&mdash;GOOD BAIT</head><lb/>

<p>Then there is the same old argument about wonderful properties
"adjoining" such and such a dividend-paying property. Very often the
properties are miles apart. They might be within twenty-five feet of
each other, and one still might be worthless and the other rich. The
profits of old and famous properties very frequently are given in
advertising literature of this class, "to show what money there is in
mining." The "property" sold may be a ten-foot hole in a sand-bank two
thousand miles from any of these; yet this absurd argument is sufficient
to extract coin from the pocket of the American buyer.  You can use
Michigan to tout him on to Arizona; Utah to land him in California;
Mexico to interest him in Alaska. Is it not true? There is no law
against it.

</p><p>Again, the appeal to your mining pocket may come, not through the
advertising page, but in the proper person of the promoter or owner
himself. For instance, not long ago a gentleman from California came
into my office. He owned a mine on the old and well-traced Mother Vein,
of Tuolumne County, California. It had been well opened, and showed, in
development, according to a reputable engineer's report, three million
dollars' worth of ore in sight, with many tons of the best ore already
in the dump, stuff which would run very high in value.

</p><p>At the proper time the gentleman carefully produced from his
pocket a little ingot of pure gold, product of one test-mill run. He
gave the best of references as to his responsibility.  He offered to
guarantee ten per cent. dividends on all money invested, and declared
that he had a banking proposition and not a mine.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d12">
<head>WHEELBARROW VS. $72,000</head><lb/>

<p>"My Christian friend," said I to him, "you seem to have a good thing.
How far is it from your mine dump to the nearest bank?"

</p><p>"About five miles," he answered.

</p><p>"In that case," said I, "it seems to me you don't need to sell a
hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock to build a stamp-mill. You need
only enough to buy yourself a good, strong wheelbarrow. In two or three
months you can thus build your own stamp-mill and pay for it with ore,
and still have your mine all in your own hands."

</p><p>He could not see it that way, and, pursuing his own method, he
took $72,000 in two weeks out of the city of Chicago, from some of the
best business men of that city. Now, perhaps he had a real mine. I have
no right to doubt that he had; but the point of interest to the small
investor is this: <hi rend="italic">neither have I any right to
believe that he had</hi>. The thing for me to do, had I wished to
invest in this way, would have been to send an expert to see the
property personally.</p>


</div2><div2 type="section" id="d13">
<head>ENTER THE FINANCIAL AGENT</head><lb/>

<p>In this game of plucking the dollars of the poor and the ignorant,
there has been a gradual improvement in methods. The constant aim has
been, first, to increase the amount of the harvest; second, to reduce to
a minimum the risk the reapers run of detection and punishment by the
authorities. Experience in most lines of commercial activity has shown
that the middlemen often gather in the largest profits and have the
smallest losses.  Many of those working the mining game&mdash;and by this is
meant selling stocks on wind and water&mdash;have made use of this fact.
To-day in the majority of cases we have, in place of the prospector or
the company selling stock direct to the suckers, the financial or fiscal
agent. He operates either under the name of a banking firm or as a
security company, which is generally a registered trade-name

   <pb n="48"/>

intended as a cloak to cover the names of individuals not desirous of
publicity.

</p><p>The financial agent of this description is in reality the
organizer and promoter of the mining company whose stock he sells. But
should trouble come along, he is the first to assert that he has been
deceived as well as his customers. He sells the shares of the mine on a
commission basis so large that practically nothing is left for
development. He takes out of the money secured large salaries and the
entire expense of advertising and carrying on the exploitation. He
prepares all the literature. One of the advantages he claims for his
proposition is the wide distribution of the stock as a safeguard against
assault by wicked Wall Street interests.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d14">
<head>CULLED TWO MILLIONS IN FOUR YEARS</head><lb/>

<p>In this wide distribution, however, lies one of his own greatest
safeguards against either criminal or civil prosecution. Scattered over
the country are his investors&mdash;the mill hand, the poor seamstress, the
humble artisan, whose total investments, comprising perhaps all their
savings, seldom exceed one hundred dollars each; and, with their savings
gone, there isn't money left to pay carfare to the office of the
financial agent, let alone to undertake a civil suit or enlist the aid
of the authorities. The poor seamstress has no way of knowing any of her
fellow unfortunates.  Hence the utter impossibility of cooperation in
seeking to get back their savings.

</p><p>As an example of the fiscal agent, there may be cited the concern
of Douglas, Lacey &amp; Company, already mentioned, a concern which in four
years, through its operations in this country and in Canada, culled from
the people of this country, according to its own statement, over
$2,000,000 in exchange for stock certificates in more than forty
varieties of mining companies. Here is a letter written to a woman by
this concern four years after she had invested all her savings in the
stock of one of these companies through this concern, showing the
advantage of the fiscal agency plan:

</p><p>DOUGLAS, LACEY &amp; CO.<lb/>

Telephone, 790 &amp; 791 Rector<lb/>
DEAR MADAM:              June 2, 1908.

</p><p>Replying to your favor of June 1st would say that we do not find
in our files any recent letter from you, and your letter addressed care
of 44 Wall Street has probably gone to the Dead Letter Office, from
which you will in time receive it.

</p><p>Now, in reply to your question, we think if you are at all
familiar with business procedure, you will see that it would be
impossible for the fiscal agents of any of the companies to return money
which had been paid for shares and which had been turned over by the
fiscal agents to the treasury of the various companies and expended in
development work on the different properties.

</p><p>It is true that we have sold stock for our customers at various
times and we are glad to do so when it is possible. At the present time,
however, as this company is in process of reorganization, there would be
no market for its stock and for this reason we are unable to help you in
the way you request.

</p><p>Very truly yours<lb/>
Douglas, Lacey &amp; Co.

</p><p>In pursuing this method, few promoters have had the success of
Dr. John Grant Lyman. He is credited with having gathered in a half
million dollars in his International Zinc operations. This company was
supposed to have valuable zinc properties in the Joplin district of
Missouri. To unload its stock on the people of this country Lyman
organized the firm of Joshua Brown &amp; Company, Bankers, incorporated
under the laws of West Virginia. Through them the stock was sold until
the collapse of the scheme in 1901, when the investors found that what
property it did own was heavily mortgaged.  While the firm was taking in
the money, Lyman maintained a racing stable, had a reputation as a
daring automobilist, and even invaded the sacred precincts of the New
York Stock Exchange.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d15">
<head>LYMAN'S SCHEME TO GET STOCKING SAVINGS</head><lb/>

<p>Three years ago the papers throughout this country were filled with
the advertisements of the Union Securities Company, selling the stock of
the Boston Greenwater Copper Company. It was stated that the mine had
cost $200,000 and that so much ore was in sight that an offer of
$400,000 had been refused. The Union Securities Company, with offices in
New York and in Goldfield, Nevada, started the stock at forty-five cents
and lifted it to a dollar. It was merely another name for John Grant
Lyman. Not only did the Union Securities company sell the stock to the
public, but it also offered it to brokers at thirty-seven and a half
cents, on their guarantee that it would not be sold by them at less than
forty-five cents. The brokers began getting contracts for the stock and
then were told that the Union Securities Company was all sold out.

   <pb n="49"/>

</p><p>Shortly thereafter, confederates of Lyman came to these brokers
and offered stock to them at fifty cents a share; and the Union
Securities Company at the same time telegraphed the brokers that it
wanted all the shares it could get at sixty cents. That forced the
brokers to buy of confederates; but when they shipped on the stock to
the Union Securities Company, expecting to get sixty cents a share for
it, Lyman was gone. It had not cost him much. He owed the newspapers of
this country $150,000 for advertising, which went unpaid. He reaped
$300,000 profits.  Boston Greenwater Copper stock can still be found in
many a stocking&mdash;of humble folk.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d16">
<head>"SALTING" WITH A CIGARETTE</head><lb/>

<p>It is not, however, always the city promoter who furnishes all of the
crookedness. He himself may be deceived by those who sell him the mine.
Some of the most thrilling stories in literature might be written about
salted mines. The sale of the Bear's Nest Mine, and the special train
expedition to the salted Bear River placer field; the sale of the
Mulatos Mine to a set of Chinamen, and scores of other instances in
American mining history, have been regarded rather as big jokes than as
great lessons. And as to such large jesting we advance in finesse. The
old way of salting a placer or a quartz vein with a shotgun is now
antiquated.

</p><p>A little while ago a party of capitalists bought a Nevada placer
on what they thought to be strictly a "cinch" basis. With their own
hands they collected the specimen dirt from all over the claim, and they
watched a Mexican miner pan the dirt at the creek. The pans showed up
beautifully. They bought the claim. Later, it proved worthless.
Afterward they remembered that the Mexican smoked cigarettes all the
time he was panning, and that he was careless in expectorating, as well
as in knocking the ashes off his cigarettes.  The truth was that the
highly intelligent Greaser was using the cigarette trick in salting the
pan. There was much fine gold in his cigarette and under his lip!</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d17">
<head>THE MULATOS MINE SALTING SCHEME</head><lb/>

<p>All sorts of methods of salting mines, even to the injection, with a
hypodermic needle, of strong solutions of mineral salts into a mining
engineer's carefully sealed sample bags, have been worked. The most
honest, careful, and expert mining engineers have been deceived time and
again, and salted right under their own eyes. Even a bland Chinee may be
fooled. Take the instance of the Mulatos Mine: The bunch of Chinamen who
proposed to buy it insisted on a mill-run test on fresh-mined ore, taken
out <hi rend="italic">by themselves</hi>, for a five-days' run.
They were not taking any chances, in their own belief. The owners of the
mine, however&mdash;so runs the story&mdash;had a platform of plank arranged above
the timbers at the top of the drift where the Chinamen brought out their
ore cars.  On this planking a man lay face downward where he could see
each ore car that passed.  He had a rather hard life for five days on
the sandwiches and water which he took up there with him, but he managed
to drop a pinch or so of nice gold dust into every car of ore that came
trundling under him. The mill-run was an entire success from the
viewpoint of the sellers, although not from that of the buyers.

</p><p>There is no working law, let us repeat, which actually protects
the investor against this sort of thing, nor which always protects even
the promoter, though he be honest.  The game is risky all the way along
the line, in spite of state laws against the heinous crime of salting,
which latter hath as yet by no means lost its savor.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d18">
<head>THE MAIL AND MINING THIEVES</head><lb/>

<p>As matters stand to-day, the man selling mining stock on a fraudulent
basis fears the Post Office Department much more than he fears the
District Attorney. That is the main protection which the public has
against such schemes. But to depend upon it is like trying to stop
Niagara with a dam of reeds. The man who induces you to take your money
out of the savings bank in exchange for stock in a mine, through such
operations as have been described, thrives by reason of his use of the
United States mails.  It is a mail-order business pure and simple.

</p><p>Let us see what machinery the Government has to protect you and
prevent the letter-carrier from bringing daily to your door the
flamboyant literature intended to lure your money from the bank. There
are five hundred Post-Office inspectors employed in watching Uncle Sam's
mail wherever it is carried, in keeping the vast and complicated
machinery of the Post Office Department oiled and working smoothly, in
running down Post-Office

   <pb n="50"/>

robbers and mail thieves and, lastly, in keeping the mail free
from frauds. Ninety per cent. of this force is required to do the
routine work of the inspecting branch; that is to keep the machinery
running smoothly and to prevent delays. That leaves just ten per cent.
for actual detective work such as is necessary in running down thieves
and in tracing frauds. In the New York district, which comprises the
state of New York as well as New York City, there is a force of
twenty-five men working under a chief inspector. Of the ten men assigned
to work in New York City, by no means all have special detective
ability, and the time of these is taken up almost entirely in catching
actual thieves.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d19">
<head>POST-OFFICE PROTECTION INADEQUATE</head><lb/>

<p>It is only the biggest and most barefaced scheme that under these
conditions can receive any attention whatsoever from the department, and
even then its force is hopelessly inadequate and incompetent for the
work in hand, work requiring the highest-class detective ability.

</p><p>About twelve years ago the Post Office Department ran down and
convicted a swindler, Stephen Balliet, who was selling stock in a mine
full of water in Oregon and was known as "the mining genius of the
Northwest."  He was tried three times, finally convicted, and sent to
prison. That case cost the Post Office Department $18,000, took a man's
entire time for two years, and required two trips across this continent.
The Government has not tried since to get many such convictions.

</p><p>Perhaps because of the pressure of other work, perhaps for other
causes, investigations of this nature are allowed to languish. Some
years ago, when the firm of Douglas, Lacey &amp; Company was reaping its
harvest, an inspector was assigned to investigate the concern's
operations. He was one of the ablest inspectors of the service, a man
with real detective ability and a knowledge of the devious ways of
certain kinds of financing. He made a trip to Mexico and subsequently
sent in a report to Washington recommending that a fraud order be issued
against the concern and that its use of the mails be stopped. He waited
a long time and then got word from Washington that more evidence was
required.  He made another investigation and sent in another report,
recommending in even stronger language that the mails be barred and the
public protected. While on this work he was constantly assigned also to
other matters and finally was shifted to a station in the South.  The
concern collapsed some years later, leaving thousands of people in this
country and in Canada bereft of their small savings. There was no fraud
order ever issued against this firm, though shortly before it closed up
it was informed that if it continued to sell stock its use of the mails
would be stopped.

</p><p>The burden of proof is on the buyer. If he turns to the District
Attorney he finds perhaps a sympathetic official, without power to
assist him. The man selling bogus mining stocks knows all this;
therefore his harvest goes on. It is better than the green-goods game,
better than the wire-tapping swindle, safer than selling any other form
of gold bricks. A few years ago a reporter who was engaged in
investigating the schemes of Cardenio F. King&mdash;now in Charlestown jail,
but then posing as "the apostle of the golden rule in finance" and
selling his stocks by the barrel in every mill town in New England&mdash;made
a call on the late John B. Moran, then District Attorney in Boston and
widely known as a reformer. He asked Mr. Moran's help in proving that
King was a swindler.

</p><p>"Young man," said Boston's reform District Attorney, "if King was
selling corner lots in heaven and advertising them in the newspapers, I
couldn't stop him, because I haven't anybody to send up there and prove
that they are not there."

</p><p>King wasn't selling corner lots in heaven, but he was selling
stock in a Texas company that was the next thing to it, so far as
tangibility is concerned. It was only when he actually took from
investors money sent to him to buy real stocks, and pocketed it, that he
was put in jail.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d20">
<head>LAWS TO PROTECT INVESTORS</head><lb/>

<p>A plan for the protection of the investor by statute is embodied in a
model law drafted by the American Mining Congress of Denver, and
recommended for general passage:

</p><p>AN ACT.<lb/>

To Prohibit the Making or Publishing of False or Exaggerated Statements
or Publications of or Concerning the Affairs, Pecuniary Condition or
Property of Any Corporation, Joint Stock Association, Co-partnership or
Individual, Which Said Statements or Publications Are Intended to Give,
or Shall Have a

   <pb n="51"/>

Tendency to Give, a Less or Greater Apparent Value to the Shares, Bonds
or Property, or Any Part Thereof of Said Corporation, Joint Stock
Association, Co-partnership or Individual, Than the Said Shares, Bonds
or Property Shall Really and in Fact Possess, and Providing a Penalty
Therefor.

</p><p>Section 1. Any person who knowingly makes or publishes in any way
whatever, or permits to be so made or published, any book, prospectus,
notice, report, statement, exhibit or other publication of or concerning
the affairs, financial condition or property of any corporation,
Joint-stock association, co-partnership or individual, which said book,
prospectus, notice, report, statement, exhibit or other publication,
shall contain any statement which is false or wilfully exaggerated or
which is intended to give or which shall have a tendency to give, a less
or greater apparent value to the shares, bonds or property of said

any part of said shares, bonds or property, than said shares, bonds or
property or any part thereof, shall really and in fact possess, shall be
deemed guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof shall be
imprisoned for not more than ten years or fined not more than ten
thousand dollars, or shall suffer both said fine and imprisonment.

</p><p>This law has been enacted in six states and a campaign for its
general enactment is under way. But let not the credulous investor
suppose that even such a law would guarantee him against loss. The
Secretary of the American Mining Congress, Mr.  James F. Callbreath,
offers the following comment:</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d21">
<head>CAMPAIGN OF THE AMERICAN MINING CONGRESS</head><lb/>

<p>"I do not believe that any one law can effect protection to mining
investors, nor that the protection afforded through the Post Office
Department forbidding the use of mails for fraudulent advertising matter
can fully cover that ground. The greater part of mining frauds are
perpetrated without the use of the mails.

</p><p>"The proposed law, in our judgment, is the longest possible step
toward preventing mining frauds. A second step has been taken in the
form of a publicity law. My belief is that no system of laws, either
state or national, will prevent men from gambling in mines more
effectually than such laws now prevent gambling in its more common
forms. These may restrict and furnish protection to those who are wise
enough to open their eyes, but it will be impossible to protect all the
fools all the time. It is the purpose of the American Mining Congress,
after having secured the enactment of laws providing penalties for
fraudulent representations and requiring publicity, to perfect an
organization to <hi rend="italic">secure execution</hi> of these
laws, and also to carry on campaigns of education showing to investors,
first, that mining is a legitimate business and not a gamble; second,
that mines are found and not made; third, that investments in mining
should be made with the same care and prudence exercised by business men
when embarking in other business enterprises. . . .  The next work of
our organization will be along the line of developing some manner of
control of corporations by which paid-up capital stock shall represent
actual value."

</p><p>Mr. Callbreath would seem to be one fore-doomed to his own
troubles; yet it is clear that he and his organization stand for
legitimate mining as opposed to prospect-selling.  In strictly accurate
phrase, it is the prospect which is found, and the mine which is made
and investment cannot properly begin until a body of ore has been
blocked out in a proved prospect. Add to the glamor of risk the haze of
fraud, and the foregoing will show the nebulous condition of mining
investments in relation to mining laws in America to-day.

</p><p>What we really need is a Bureau of Mines at Washington. Nobody
protects the mining investor. Nobody guards the widest open gate into
the savings deposits of this country.

</p><p>The American Mining Congress, it should be stated, had a quasi
pre-inaugural pledge from President Taft in favor of a Federal Bureau of
Mines. Toward this we have made a start. A bill establishing this Bureau
has already passed both the House and the Senate, and bids fair to
become a law. But the activities of this new department will be confined
to safe-guarding mineworkers. The next step should be to enlarge the
province of the Bureau so as to include the supervision of the mining
industry for the protection of investors.

</p><p>It seems quite likely that the states and the nation will need to
unite if adequate protection to the investing public is to be expected.
But when did state and nation unite to solve a great popular problem?
When did section ever unite with section or even resident with
nonresident? This is America.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d22">
<head>THE ENGLISH WAY OF MINING&mdash;HONEST BUSINESS</head><lb/>

<p>Back of any movement of this kind there must be popular interest in
popular education.  Thus far, the greater publicity idea is of more
value than anything at hand. We may perhaps. best do our own little part
by

   <pb n="52"/>

offering some studies in the theory of mining, showing just <hi
rend="italic">why</hi> it is risky, and just <hi
rend="italic">how</hi> we ought to tabulate the risk. In addition to
this, we can present, and should perhaps first present, some of the
results of intelligent mining as pursued in other countries.
</p><p>Take the Rand Mines of South Africa, operated on the English
basis&mdash;mines which turned out more than $12,500,000 in one month not
long since. The English method of operating on the Rand is this: A corps
of experts is sent to examine a proposed property&mdash;that is to say, a
proved prospect. If their report be favorable, an estimate is made of
the cost of a five-or seven-compartment shaft, to be sunk, say, 3,500
feet. The cost of producing a year's supply of ore for the mill is then
considered. The cost of the mill and the cyanide plant is also figured.
The total cost is then cast up, and the company is ready to be formed
for a half million to five millions of dollars, according to existing
conditions. This money is paid in, and is ready to start operations.
These men mine carefully, using all possible scientific knowledge and
practical experience as guides. The operation may have risk, but it is
perforce honest.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d23">
<head>THE AMERICAN WAY&mdash;A GAMBLE</head><lb/>

<p>Now let us examine conditions not infrequent in the United States, by
no means assigning wings to all English mining men, or hoofs to all
Americans:

</p><p>A prospector discovers mineralized rock.  He locates one or more
claims as controlled by the laws of the district where he is.  Perhaps
others also locate more ground. A little work is done, and then the
claims are up for sale. A claim is perhaps sold for a few hundred to
several thousand dollars; sometimes the seller receives in addition
stock in the company to be formed. No attention is paid to the geology,
but a company is formed ostensibly for the purpose of mining, with a
capital of one million shares at one dollar par. Perhaps four hundred
thousand shares are placed in the treasury to be sold for development
purposes. Of course the whole thing is as yet on a wholly gambling
basis.  The property is still a prospect and not a mine, and hence it is
not possible to put it on an investing basis. Comparatively few
companies have ever used the services of a real expert, although very
possibly the company furnishes a report made from a purchasable local
"mining engineer," one of the cheapest commodities in any mining
district, where the wide hat and the high-laced boot often take the
place of a mining education and a reputable character. This is the stage
at which, this is the basis on which, most of the mining "investments"
of America are made.

</p><p>In this state of affairs grafters find their opportunity. Prices
in a boom camp are always above any sort of industrial warrant.  There
were literally millions of dollars poured into Goldfield and Tonopah for
claims which never had any careful examination by competent men.
Fortunes were made by local promoters and "operators" out of claims
which could not show ten feet of actual work. Sometimes the entire
capitalization was sold out, and the promoters put the money in their
pockets. One operator of this kind sold $130,000 worth of stock, and
omitted the precaution of putting even ten per cent. of it in the
treasury. Fortunately, he got into the penitentiary. Many of his fellows
never had actions brought against them except under the postal laws,
which naturally are inefficient. There was one shaft of a hundred feet
which cost twelve thousand dollars, charged up to the stockholders, the
names of dead men being used on the pay rolls as "laborers." The mine
boss and the local officers got big salaries to keep their mouths shut.
The real mine was in the savings banks of America, in the pockets of
non-residents. In Nevada alone, in the past four years, more than twenty
million dollars have been invested in <hi rend="italic">worthless</hi>
properties. One engineer with a
government certificate could have saved the clerks, stenographers,
widows, washwomen, and orphans of America fifteen million dollars at the
cost of, say, five thousand. Would that have been a good investment?
What could a dozen do? What could an efficient corps do? Is there here
yet one more future task for our patient and long-suffering United
States Army? What police work would pay better dividends?</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d24">
<head>THE PROMOTER AND THE CREAM</head><lb/>

<p>Even when the mine wins, the small stockholder rarely wins. The
promoters often take the cream. Suppose a company is organized for three
million shares. One million is put in the treasury for sale. Of this
million shares, say, two hundred thousand are offered at twenty-five
cents. This raises a working

   <pb n="53"/>

capital of fifty thousand dollars. Let us be very glowing, and suppose
that, with this fifty thousand dollars, we really uncover five million
dollars' worth of ore. The net profit would not exceed three million
dollars; so that the man who put in twenty-five cents might, after a
long time, get back a dollar. In the meantime, two million dollars would
have gone to promoters, in "commissions," and so forth.  There are
thousands of such cases, and still the people continue to bite on such
bait.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d25">
<head>THE PUBLIC = THE MINE</head><lb/>

<p>Instances of actual Nipissing rises caught in time by the lamb are
very rare. I rom first to last, the <hi rend="italic">public</hi>
is the mine, <hi rend="italic">and the returns come out of the
savings banks</hi>. In some mines "high grading"&mdash;the carrying away of
valuable pieces of ore by the miners themselves&mdash;is fought as sternly
as the diamond stealing by the Kaffirs in a Kimberley mine. In yet other
mines, far more numerous, high grading is encouraged among the miners.
The report gets out that the ore is so rich that the miners steal it in
their dinner pails. That booms the stock. <hi rend="italic">Wall
Street makes this money out of the market and not out of the
mine</hi>.

</p><p>In spite of all warning and all examples, the average American
will to a certain extent persist in gambling in mining stocks. Supposing
this to be true, it is of value for the investor to learn something of
the theory of mines, something enabling him to pass on the natural value
of any mining stock which is offered to him. What, then, is a mine?
What are some of the inevitable features in developing a mine?

</p><p>In the first place, there must be prospecting.  This is sheer and
unavoidable risk on the face of it, and it is attended with economic
waste which cannot be avoided. Of a hundred prospectors, ninety-nine die
poor. The failures must be charged off to industrial waste attendant
upon inherent conditions of the mining industry.

</p><p>Again, in the development of a mine after it is located and
proved in part, there is more unavoidable economic waste. The rock is
blank and silent. It can only be explored by means of expensive drifts
and drillings. In one mine at Bisbee, Arizona, a shaft was sunk which
had drifts at the 600-and 900-feet levels, all without result. Later on
they found a blanket of copper between those two levels, from which six
million dollars were taken.  Even in old established mines there is
something of a chance, and there are often unwittingly false standards
of values. Which is no argument for making all gamble that which
originally was part gamble.

</p><p>Any mine, no matter how rich, or how large, begins to be
exhausted from the time the first pick is stuck into the ground and all
its profits ought to be figured on the basis of diminishing deposits.
When your deposit is drawn out, your bank does not honor your check. A
mine is the reverse of a mortgage or a bond. The security does not
remain stable nor increase in value, but, on the contrary, <hi
rend="italic">continually decreases</hi> in value. In a mortgage, six
per cent. is wisdom; in a mining return, it is folly. A mine, instead of
being figured on the basis of a mortgage, ought to be figured on the
basis of a term annuity.  That is to say, on the basis of a wiping out
date. When the mine is done paying dividends, there is no return of the
face of the principal invested. Yet the great and gullible public
forgets this all-important fact, which differentiates mining from every
other form of business.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d26"><head>CRACKER-BOX INVESTORS</head><lb/>

<p>There is every probability that the average investor never heard of a
proper "amortization charge" in the management of a mine.  Until he
shall have heard of it, until he shall have learned something of the
terms of life annuities, he ought never to invest a cent in any mining
stock. After he actually has learned the theory of amortization, he will
observe that <hi rend="italic">almost every mining stock listed in
public prints is selling at an inflated value</hi>.  That is to say,
even the best and most stable of mines are overrated, not to mention the
purely wildcat ventures. Some mines may naturally be long-lived, others
short-lived; yet, if either pays a good, stiff dividend, <hi
rend="italic">the public makes no distinction between the two</hi>
and will buy the stock of either. In this investing, the public has no
protection on the part of the government, on the part of honest
publicity, or on the part of its own careful education.

</p><p>In the <hi rend="italic">majority</hi> of cases, a mine
ought to pay annually perhaps twenty per cent. of the investment, to be
profitable. That is to say, the actual value of any mine is rarely over
five times actual dividends paid after expenses of operation. How many
mines are capitalized on any such real basis as that? The answer lies in
our own ignorance, and in the

   <pb n="54"/>

shrewdness of the men who sell us mining stocks. Stocks that are the
best dividend-payers often sell at <hi rend="italic">ten</hi> or
<hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> times the face of the annual
dividends. Let the mine hit a brief streak of bonanza, and the stocks
will climb yet higher. We buy such stocks, or worse; but even a
fundamental acquaintance with the theory of mines would show us that
such an investment is usually a bad one. In a mortgage we do not look to
the interest to pay us back our principal; in a mine we <hi
rend="italic">must</hi> look to <hi rend="italic">dividends</hi>
to pay us back our <hi rend="italic">principal and interest</hi>
also. When the mine is done, our principal is gone. But how many mining
investors ever thought of that? And how many, when offered a ten per
cent. "guaranteed dividend" for five years on their money, ever stop to
reflect that, for instance, I could take your money and put it in a
cracker box, and myself make money by paying it back to you, ten per
cent. a year for nine years&mdash;and then explaining what had happened to
the cracker box! Now, most of us are just such cracker-box investors. We
pay out millions and millions annually, just that foolishly.  And our
nation, our states, allow us to do it.  They even&mdash;as recent legal
proceedings prove&mdash;allow the "inside" operating stockholders to borrow
money to pay dividends to the "outsiders." That keeps up the "values" in
the market. It does not enhance the real value in the mine.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d27">
<head>ENGLISH VS. AMERICAN MINE REPORTS</head><lb/>

<p>Again, granted even a valid and a well-managed mine, how much
information regarding it does the average investor in the stock secure?
In a general way, he knows in advance that all mining, whether placer or
quartz, is very expensive. Beyond that, he gets the annual report of the
officers, which will tell perhaps the names of the men who are spending
his money, the total earnings, the total output, the balance sheet, the
statement of capital stock issued&mdash;and little else.  All of which means
nothing!

</p><p>A well-regulated English company is obliged to go much farther
than this. A good annual report will show the advertisement of the
general meeting of stockholders, the list of directors and officers,
reports of directors, giving details of the condition of property,
including the development work, the tonnage of production, the values
recovered from such tonnage, the costs of operation, the profits for the
period covered, the balance sheet of accounts, the profit and loss
statement, including a working cost estimate, the appropriation list
showing what has been done with all the earnings, the reports of
managers giving details of the development work, the estimated values of
ores <hi rend="italic">exposed on three sides</hi>, the probable
values of ores not so well exposed, the working expenses, the
construction account, general remarks on the physical condition of the
property, and a map of the property itself.

</p><p>What American promoter would trouble himself to make such a
showing as that to the American sucker? Even if such detailed
information existed in the records of the average American mining
concern, the sucker could not get access to the books even did he have
the temerity to demand it.

</p><p>Professor H. S. Munroe, of the Columbia School of Mines, when
asked whether such a thing as general supervision of mining investment
could be possible, answered: "Yes, if some philanthropist will give us
ten millions to endow such an institution, and maintain a corps of
engineers in the field who will do work similar to that accomplished by
J.  Curle under the auspices of the <hi rend="italic">London Economist</hi>. Such work
should, of course, cover all incorporated mining companies, not merely a
few hundred of the more prominent gold mines; and it should be
continuous and not spasmodic. Such a plan is of course Utopian, but I
feel that anything less would be likely to do little good. Even Curle's
opinions began to lose their value within a month or two after they were
written, and are of less value every year. Mining can never be put on
the same basis as agriculture, for the reason that the risk of failure
is infinitely greater, and that it is impossible to prove the value of
any mine or mining region without spending a large amount of capital,
the greater part of which will inevitably be lost in this work of
initial development."

</p><p>Those are the sober words of an expert who spends his life in
studying the theory and practice of mining. If such words shall teach us
a little wisdom, so much the less need for laws. But let us consider
what the laws ought to do in order to protect you for the sake of your
family, and for the sake of society, and for the sake of the savings
which lie back of the prosperity of this country.

</p><p>Let us agree that no government can guarantee the safety of any
investment. Let us admit that digging gold can never be put on the same
amortization basis with digging potatoes, for instance, because the soil
remains

   <pb n="55"/>

for more potatoes, whereas the ore of a mine is exhausted and does
not raise more ore. Nevertheless, although the industries of potato
growing and ore digging are not the same, the principles lying back of
them ought to be precisely the same; and our governments, both state and
national, ought to see to it that they are kept precisely the same, and
controlled on the same plane legally. If it be true that no government
can watch after every mine, none the less any enlightened government can
establish general conditions for engaging in mining or engaging in the
sale of mining stock; and, perhaps with yet better results, it can
establish a general supervision over the mining intelligence of the
public, just as it does over the agricultural intelligence of that
public.</p>

</div2><div2 type="section" id="d28">
<head>NEEDED: A FEDERAL BUREAU OF MINES</head><lb/>

<p>The enactment of good mining laws, punishing the proved intent to
commit a fraud as well as the fraud itself, and seeing to it that
capital stock shall be paid up, seeing to it also that all moneys spent
by a mining corporation shall be traceable from start to finish, is the
natural first step toward the purification of American mining methods.
Beyond that, the national government could take a hand in the game
through a federal Bureau of Mines. There must be some clearing-house of
intelligence and of values in this country, some place from which our
intelligence may start and to which it may return. The public must have
accessible reports of engineers, state or federal, of a sort entitled to
confidence.

</p><p>The nest of vermin in our large cities, inhabited by those who
make a living out of the ignorance and eagerness of small investors,
must be smoked out once and for all. In this work, state and national
governments, popular education and intelligence, and the aid of the
better class journalism of America, all must be enlisted. The pages of
our press might well be far cleaner than they are. The publication which
prints the advertisements of a fake-mining enterprise is itself a party
to the fraud. A Bureau of Mines chief can sit behind the desk of every
advertising manager in the counting-rooms of every newspaper and
magazine in America. The press of this country, when it likes, can, by
taking thought, somewhat dim the splendor of the mahogany in many an
elegant suite of offices in New York, Boston, or elsewhere. It can
reduce the reckless and senseless expenditure of ill-gained wealth which
is making civilization a mockery in America, and branding our republican
form of government as a failure.

</p><p>We will have a different way of life, or another form of
government. We will have a better administration of law in the United
States or we will have another political party, possibly another
political system. We will clear up this rotten society, or we will try
how we like a different organization of society.  The people of America
are beginning to murmur.  The burden of the murmur is that they have
long enough been betrayed.  Unspeakable injustice has been done the
people of America under the forms of law and government.  It is coming
to be said that our law and government have not an even hand for all,
that a few are allowed to despoil the many. When a people murmurs, let a
government beware. Meantime the more that certain unspeakable things are
reduced in, and eliminated from, Wall Street and the other "financial
centers," the better for our schools, our taxes, our farming, our
industry, our living, our <hi rend="italic">character</hi>, our
country.

</p><p>After all, the government of this country, as we now have it
organized, depends on the <hi rend="italic">character</hi> of its
average individual citizen.  The end of this abuse of fake-mining
enterprises begins now, here, with you and me, in <hi
rend="italic">our</hi> intelligence, in <hi

<p>As for you and me, when next we see the flaming advertisement
advising us that the Madre d'Oro, Montezuma's fabled Mother Vein of
Gold, has once more come to the surface of the earth on Manhattan Island
or near Plymouth Rock; when next we read counsel that because mining
pays in Michigan it ought to pay in Nevada; when next we are advised to
get into the game at once because this is our LAST CHANCE&mdash;we might at
least ask to see the report of the engineer, likewise the record and
antecedents of the engineer; and many, many other things. Perchance we
might write and ask the mining promoter what, in his belief, is the
proper amortization charge in his particular mine. At which the average
mining promoter would probably fall dead.</p>
