<head>CHARLES GIBSON</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(1846-1923)<lb/> Muscogee </hi>
</p>
<p>Charles Gibson was born near Eufaula, Creek Nation, on March 20, 1846, the
son of John C. and Polly Gibson, a member of Tuckabatchee tribal town from
whom Gibson derived his tribal identity. The family had emigrated from
Alabama in 1832. The boat on which they traveled sank, and they lost
everything they owned. Upon arrival in the Indian Territory, they settled on
the Grand River near Fort Gibson and farmed.</p>
<p>Charles Gibson, who was self-educated, obtained what little formal education
he had in the common schools of the Creek Nation and at Asbury Mission. He
ran a store in the western part of the Creek Nation for a short time and
then worked twenty years as head clerk and buyer in the Grayson Brothers
store at North Fork Town. In 1896 he established his own store in Eufaula, a
developing town in the southeastern part of the Creek nation.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say when Gibson began writing, but he was described by one
of his contemporaries as "one of the best newspaper and short story writers
among the Indians." His range of forms varied greatly: fables, biographical
sketches, reminiscences, descriptions; but the thrust was always the same.
His common theme was the old ways of the Creeks and the loss of their
culture. In 1901 and 1902, his regular contributions to the Eufaula Indian
Journal were published as "Gibson&#61482;s Rifle Shots."</p>
<p>Wrote one Indian Territory editor in 1903: "Nearly everyone who knows
anything of Indian Territory or the Creek tribe has heard of Charles Gibson.
His fables, published at some time or other in nearly every paper of
Oklahoma or Indian Territory, together with 'Gibson&#61482;s Rifle
Shots&#61482; have made for him a name that could scarcely be obtained
by any other achievement. Full of wit and humor, yet in all his writings
there is imbedded a tinge of pathos, a mixture of humiliation and sarcasm,
showing a spirit of never having been reconciled to some event where
circumstances have ruled against his convictions. . . . His subjects
strongly tend to the philosophical, yet at the same time showing a personal
feeling no altogether in harmony with existing conditions. There are some
who call Charles Gibson a pessimist but in the same breath emphasize the
fact that he is 'a good Indian.'"</p>
<p>It is difficult to even estimate the numbers of works by Gibson. It was a
common event to see two or three of his works in a single issue of a weekly
newspaper. Many works were often reprinted in other papers as far away as
Kansas City. A brief survey of his works, however, suggests that Gibson is
one of the most prolific Native American writer of all times.</p>
<p>Here is a sample of his articles from 1901-1903, selected from the Eufaula
Indian Journal and Twin Territories, published at Muskogee. They have been
separated into three groups based on their content. In the Tradition
section, Gibson writes of old Muscogee (Creek) ways that seem to be lost to
his contemporary Indian and white peers. The Politics section, deals with
his commentary on the silly ideas and laws that the United States government
was attempting to impose (or not impose) on the Indians. The last section,
Miscellaneous, is a sampler of his other styles of writing. Editing has been
limited to correcting grossly misspelled words and minor typographical
errors. Minor misspellings, coined phrases, regionalisms, and incorrect
grammar have been left to reflect the "down-home" style and attitude that
Gibson strived so hard to create towards the many serious subjects that he
commented on.</p>

<head>A Creek Festival, Green Corn Dance</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Twin Territories</hi>, July 1899)</hi>
</p>
<p>About the last days of July of each year the Creeks have their "green
corn festival." This is how it is done: In the first place, this is a
very sacred festival, as it is dedicated to the Great Spirit on account
of the harvest of new corn. These festivals were formerly carried on at
the ripening of any and all fruits, but to-day all have been dropped
save the Green Corn festival. The Creek people are numbered by "towns."
Among these we will write up what is called Took-a-par-chee Town,<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> which
town, being more zealous and better equipped for the purpose, carries on
the festival longer than others. One article they have which other towns
do not possess is a lot of brass plates--say, about a dozen-- which are
held in high esteem among the Creeks. Tradition tells us they were
handed down out of the clouds to the Spo-ko-kees,<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> who were then on the
top of a very high mountain. This mountain--according to Creek
tradition--we claim was the Andes of South America, between New Grenada
and Venezuela, being the great hunting and camping-ground of the Creeks.</p>
<p>The Took-a-par-chee town has always been looked upon as the mother town
of all other towns, being one of the original towns of the Creeks--there
being several Creek towns of today, which were towns that were
vanquished and became Creek towns by adoption. Now to the festival. The
program runs as follows:</p>
<p>The first day after striking camp the women dance alone. The second day
the brass plates are taken to the nearest stream and polished very
bright, early in the morning by a picked band of young men. After having
polished them the young men return to camp with great pomp. Then it is
that the black drink in taken by all the men and youths of the town
(which is an emetic.)<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> After a cleansing of the stomach the dance goes
on, with the brass plates, and also a long reed or cane switch loaded
with white crane feathers. The second day and night closes with dances
by male and female. The third day is commenced by eating food without
salt and resting from the all-night dance of the previous night. The
fourth day is taken up with a chase or a hunt, bringing into camp what
is killed during the day, and which is converted into soup. On the fifth
day at early dawn is danced the genuine War Dance, accompanied by a sham
battle, engaged in by all the men and boys, after which all partake of
food with salt. During the remainder of the day young and old practice
ball-playing with sticks. The sixth and last day is commenced in
drinking medicine and dancing, in which all take a part throughout the
day and night, and which winds up the festival. New fire is built on the
morning of the second day by the medicine man of the town who rubs two
hard dry sticks together until the friction ignites the hole in a dry
log that is used. All other fire on this morning is put out and the new
fire is given to the entire camp. The Creeks were in the habit of taking
a chunk of this fire with them, horseback, often a two days' journey,
stopping and building fires along the road to get a new or fresh chunk
of fire.</p>
<p>Concerning the brass plates of the Took-a-par-chee mentioned, others than
the "wind clan"<ref target="n4">[4]</ref> are not allowed to touch them, as they believe it will
make them sick unto death, and may cause death. They have on one side
letters which have never been interpreted by anyone, therefore they are
held very sacred by the Creeks.</p>

<head>A "Medicine Man's" Examination</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Twin Territories</hi>, December 1899)</hi>
</p>
<p>In early days the Creek "Medicine Man" went through many trials and
endured numerous hard-ships in order to become a full fledged doctor.
The examination lasted many days and was severe in the extreme. In those
days the proposed doctor's chances to pass the examination seemed to
depend more upon his physical powers of endurance than upon his ability mentally.</p>
<p>The first step towards becoming a "medicine man" is the young Indian's
application to a board of old "medicine men," usually consisting of
three, who have successfully passed through the ordeal and who are
learned and experienced in their profession.</p>
<p>These old men take entire charge of the young applicant for several days.
He is taken by them to their homes where they see that he has careful
attention. Meanwhile he must place himself entirely at their disposal
and completely under their control and instructions. They sing certain
songs to him and otherwise entertain him. Then instructions follow. This
consists of teaching the applicant the practical use of certain roots
and herbs in curing certain diseases. He is shown the effect of various
remedies and is told the secrets known only to medicine men. One of the
most important of their instructions is, "never attempt to cure a
patient unless your are thoroughly acquainted with his disease."</p>
<p>(All "medicine men" were specialists.)</p>
<p>So far, so good; but the old instructors are not satisfied and thus
follows the worst part of the examination--or , what might be a better
word, preparation.</p>
<p>After the causes and remedies are learned, the test of manhood, or
hardihood, as you may call it, is put. Fasting is the principal feature
in this. Four days the young applicant is forced to fast, being allowed
only a small quantity of "safky"<ref target="n1b">[1]</ref> once a day.</p>
<p>The four days having passed, the ravenous fellow is allowed to eat
anything his appetite may demand--for one day--then fasting begins
again. Three times this four-day fast is repeated, with the one day of
relaxation until the applicant has fasted for in all, sixteen days.</p>
<p>Enough, you say? 'Tis only the beginning for following this is what is
termed the "eight-day fast," when the applicant fasts eight successive
days, with only safky once a day, as in the preceding test. Only about
one in fifty, we are told, has the fortitude and strength to undergo
this sixty-four days of fast, but the one who does stand it is forever
after looked upon as a man among men.</p>
<p>If the applicant has not given up in despair ere, this, the last test is
made, which is so terrible as to be doubted by many.</p>
<p>The wildest part of a forest is selected as the scene of this test. There
a grave is dug, about two feet deep, in which the applicant is buried. A
reed or piece of cane, saturated with salt water, is placed in his
mouth. This extends quite outside of the grave and through it the
applicant breathes.</p>
<p>The grave is covered over with leaves and dry brush, and in the dead of
night, these are set afire. The salt on the cane prevents it from
burning. After the fire, the applicant is resurrected with a great deal
of ceremony, and is pronounced by his instructors as being a
full-fledged Creek doctor. He is told that it is now in his power to
cure such diseases as he has been taught and that he can begin
"practicing" at once.</p>
<p>A gun-shot-wound doctor is taught in a different way from this. Their
mode of treating a wounded person is to make the patient fast four days
after being wounded, the doctor fasting with his patient. After the
fasting is over, the doctor and the patient eat the same dishes until
the latter is cured.</p>
<p>One interesting fact about the Creek doctor is that he does not harm his
patient, and if he doesn't cure him, he generally leaves him where he
finds him.</p>

<head>More Indian Tradition</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, June 7, 1901)</hi>
</p>
<p>Chas. Gibson Thinks it is a Cold Subject for the White Man.</p>
<p>A cold subject for the white man, this, but it is no worse than to look
over a newspaper filled up with the opening of some Indian reservation,
some gusher, world's fair, or the commission to the five civilized
tribes<ref target="n1c">1</ref> or the presentation of a bouquet to some high official, or some
railroad that is aiming at every little village in the Indian territory,
therefore we will try and cram down one more of the aforesaid traditions.</p>
<p>The Indian has been accused of being a cannibal. Tradition of the Indian
does not corroborate the white man's history of the North American. They
have a tradition like this:</p>
<p>In good old days there was a being that resembled a man very much, though
weighing some 400 or 500 pounds and was some eight or ten feet high.
This being was always a male, there being no females among them and
there was very few of these beings. In this story we have only one
cannibal. He could talk any language that then existed. He had a habit
of being very kind to any person; never cross at any time. He would
approach any one and speak very kindly to them and always before leaving
extended a very kind invitation to go with him and enjoy his
hospitality. In those days, as it is now, there was always some Indian
who had plenty of spare time and would follow this being off. That would
be the last seen of this party with so much time. Perchance his bow and
arrows would be all that would be left to tell the tale. He (the
cannibal) would entice little children to go with him. Their little
bones would be all that could be found of them. This thing of
cannibalism became too common and a certain lot of young men fixed up a
trap to lay this giant cannibal low. The giant came a certain road to a
certain camp of Indians. Just before reaching camp there was a certain
very deep creek to cross; this was the place picked out by the men to
lay the trap. The young men climbed trees and cut long grape vines which
were stretched across the creek. Then vines were interwoven until it
resembled a suspension bridge; leaves and soil were thrown over the
surface until any one could walk over the bridge nicely. When the thing
was completed the young men built a man trap under it and had it
arranged all right when they saw the cannibal coming. The young men
enticed a couple of little orphan children out on the end of the bridge,
where the little fellows would be safe and gave them some venison and
rice<ref target="n2c">2</ref> to eat. While the little fellows were eating, the giant walked
upon the bridge about half way and began to talk very pretty to the
children, hoping to get them to follow him off. Just about this time the
bridge gave way and the giant went down into the trap. The young men
rushed out of the brush and began hurling down wood gotten for the
purpose. After heaping a great lot of fuel on the giant, they set fire
to the heap. After awhile there was a loud explosion which was caused by
the giant's head or skull bursting. The fire burned down and the young
men raked out the burned bones of the giant, and among other medicines
that the medicine men have are some few pieces of this selfsame giant's
bones, which they claim have great medicinal properties even to this day.</p>

<head>Creek War Whoop</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, January 31, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>We know this is a very dull subject at this stage of the Indian's
history, but we happen to know that there was such a thing once as a
Creek war whoop. It was never given during a battle as some would have
you believe. The war whoop of the Creek Indian was given more as a
warning than as a summons to combat. When the enemy was close upon the
Creek Indian he went at once to all the camps, giving, at intervals,
three keen whoops as fast as he could draw his breath--short keen
whoops. As he drew near the camps of his people the whoops were given
oftener. He did not stop to report the cause but kept right on to the
next camp or settlement, as the case might be. After the first one
giving the war whoop gave out on his run, another took it up and carried
it to other camps and settlements until all the Creeks were warned. They
asked no questions but rushed to arms at once and formed scouting
parties. The Arbekas<ref target="n1d">1</ref> were always detailed by the Creeks to do picket
duty, for they were experts at the business. They were called the Gate
Town. Chitto Harjo<ref target="n2d">2</ref> is a member of this town. Maybe that is why he is a
little hard to conquer. He knows how to sound the war whoop of the
Creeks, though he is not allowed to do so at this stage of the Indian game.<ref target="n3d">3</ref></p>

<head>About Fish Killing</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, November 21, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>Last summer we witnessed a fish killing. This is one of the real Indian
sports, and when we saw the pleasure it afforded the old and the young,
we felt that it was hard, if not wrong, to abolish<ref target="n1e">1</ref> it as an uncivilized custom.</p>
<p>A fish killing, when properly managed, not only affords much pleasure but
also an excellent feast, which a civilized man would enjoy. It is one of
the oldest Creek customs. It has been practiced in the Creek nation
about seventy years, and there are as many fish in the streams today as
there were before. The next day after a fish killing one can drop his
hook in the water and get a bite just as if the stream had not been
poisoned.<ref target="n2e">2</ref> The poison, drifting down the stream soon loses its strength
and the fish recover their equilibrium. So the killing has to be done as
soon as the poison is put in. Some have the idea that this method of
killing fish is wanton destruction, but it is erroneous. It would not
cripple civilization much to allow the Indian to indulge in a sport that
is less cruel and wanton than the sport in which high explosives<ref target="n3e">3</ref> are
sometimes employed. The government would not be out as many fish as
dollars in permitting the poor Indians to continue the practice of their
old custom.</p>
<note id="n1e"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg> <p>Earlier in 1902, Congress passed a law regulating hunting and fishing
in Indian Territory.</p></note>
<note id="n2e"><seg type="note-symbol">2.</seg> <p>Horse chestnuts, buckeye juice or "Devil's shoestring." By mixing one
of these into the river or stream, the fish would become paralyzed and
float to the top for free picking.</p></note>

"poisons," which only stun them.</p></note>

<head>Indian Proverbs</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, March 20, 1903)</hi>
</p>
<p>The warrior that strings his bow and shoulders his quiver at the first
alarm is not the man to do the most killing of the enemy.</p>
<p>Keep your eye on the man that has no talk for any one. He will kill more
of his enemy than the man that talks heap too much.</p>
<p>When a white man seems to be real good to you is a good time for you to
let him alone; he wants something you have real bad.</p>
<p>To keep out of danger watch your friends and let the stranger go unwatched.</p>
<p>When you feel that you are perfectly safe from your enemies shoot your
gun off and put a fresh and sure load in your gun and look out.</p>
<p>To be safe in battle never shoot into the front ranks of your enemy,
always tackle the rear ranks of your enemy. There is less danger in the
hind wheels of a wagon.</p>
<p>There are a great deal more good people in the world than we give credit,
for the savage nature in man causes him to judge his fellowman too harshly.</p>
<p>I know nothing of the ark and the flood business. I came out of the knoll
of the earth it seems after the thing was all over.</p>
<p>Never talk too much about your neighbor. It is easier to swallow a small
lie then it is to gulp down a great lot of lies when your neighbor
proves to be the stronger man.</p>
<p>It does not necessarily take a handsome man to kill a deer, or marry a
good looking woman.</p>
<p>The friends we have had, the people we have become acquainted with, the
enemies we have had, will outnumber those we will meet again.</p>
<p>The Indian builds a small fire and sits comfortable by it. The white man
builds a big fire and has to move back and forward, to and from it, and
does not enjoy his fire.</p>
<p>The white man frets and fumes; gets bald and gray headed, and dies young,
hoarding up money for his next of kin to fight and quarrel over. The
Indian dies with old age, retaining his hair and its color, leaving his
nearest of kin friendly.</p>

<head>They All Do It</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, May 17, 1901)</hi>
</p>
<p>Chas. Gibson's Argument Proves That.</p>
<p>The humblest, the greatest, the richest, the poorest all, all do it. Take
a minister of the Gospel, take the good old deacons; in fact any Indian
of the Five tribes--there is not one in 500 but what will take a little
"sumthin" and one calls for two drinks, etc., and so on up to where they
lose all respect and pride and of course are prone to go down under the
weight of drink.</p>
<p>We often hear the white man preacher score the public for drinking. Not
one in five whites get in the gutter while four out of five Indians will
get to the gutter. Some of the ablest and best Indians of the Five
tribes will make no halt at one or two drinks of whiskey. After getting
one drink all of them [lose] their self respect and will get gloriously
drunk. The first or second drink is taken with closed doors but after
this they will take it where there is room to elevate the elbow and
bottle. This thing of drink is a worse curse to Indians than any other
race on the face of the earth to-day. Had it not been for Christopher
Columbus and his four ten-gallon kegs of whiskey this U.S. would belong
to the American Indians. This is a whole mouth full to say but Indian
tradition tells us when Columbus was unable to get communication with
the Indian he one night had a lifeboat landed on the beach with four
kegs of whiskey with three or four dozen tin cups handily placed around
the kegs and had the heads knocked out, in which shape Mr. Indian found
things on the beach. He approached the kegs with caution, looked into
the well filled kegs of whiskey with a great deal of pride. In fact he
had all his pride with him. He stuck the end of his finger into the kegs
and tasted each and saw that it was good not only to look upon but was
fair to the Indian taste. He and others went from keg to keg tasting
with the tips of their fingers until they were all feeling, as the
fellow said, salubrious. Just there is where he lost his pride and each
of them got a tin cup and drank with the white man's whiskey.</p>
<p>The next morning found several of the bucks in the gutter as it were, not
able to stagger away. Then Columbus knew he had the ropes on Mr. Injun
so he landed another yawl or lifeboat and proceeded to scoop Mr. Injun
and dump him into his life boat previous to carrying him to his ships
which he did on short notice. After getting him or them aboard it was no
trouble to swap land, his friendship, his birthright or anything else
that came handy for whiskey. Since which time the Indian has had a
weakness for strong drink. If the Indians could, in making treaties with
the U.S., have the U.S. to make a law to hang every white man who sells
whiskey to Indians and to hang the Indian for drinking the whiskey it
would settle the Indian problem, which problem has caused the U.S. no
little trouble.</p>
<p>In case the Cherokees make another agreement we would suggest that this
little hanging clause aforesaid be amended to their next agreement and
all will be calm and serene in the Cherokee nation and we will try and
have congress do likewise unto us.</p>

<p>The Indians Were But Now Are Not. Presto Chang[o], and You Done it Yourselves.</p>
<p>Did You Ever Think of It?</p>
<p>Some of Us Copper Colored People's Wants.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the neighborhood of 240 acres of land each. And, again;
isn't there a lot of money due us copper colored people in the U.S.
Treasury? That might come in handy now. Also moneys for school purposes
and some territorial form of government with a home rule, if we are not
entitled to statehood.</p>
<p>Did You Ever Think of It?</p>
<p>We have men here in the Territory who can fill any office required in a
territory. White, black, red, republican, democrat or any other
political party.</p>
<p>Did You Ever Think of It?</p>
<p>We are being ruled to-day as if white, black and red were wards of this
U.S. Why not give us a governor and let us do the balance, and brace up
and be somebody and be done with it.</p>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">The Creek Treaty</hi>
</p>
<p>It has been tampered with too much. It is like the Curtis bill.<ref target="n1f">1</ref> Every
one in congress seems to have been experts with Indians. If the Indian
is going to be taxed on 120 acres for five years before he can realize
anything off it, of course he will oppose the treaty. Who could blame
them for doing so. The Indians are poor and are not able, all of them,
to pay the taxes and hold on to this 120 acres. Of course if we are U.S.
citizens, the government has the right to tax her citizens on some of
our property, yet it is forbidden by the same power, that the 120 acres
must not be conveyed by contract otherwise.</p>
<p>Who ever heard of such laws. The taxes on 120 acres of good land will
amount to something in five years. What fullblood is going to be able to
pay taxes on say 720 acres for five years. Be it ever so small a tax it
will amount to several acres of the 720 acres in five years which land
will be sold for taxes, of course. Yet the Indian must not be allowed to
realize anything on each 120 acres belonging to his family say of six.</p>
<p>We hear some little talk from the full-bloods. They say "why, the white
people are trying to box us up so they can get a revenue on our lands,
but do not let us, the owners, get anything out of it." Why not wait the
five years and then make a treaty that will give us a deed to our lands
at once. Why not give us a deed and allow us to dispose of say 80 acres
for each one or our families. The proceeds of which might enable every
Creek Indian citizen to build up and fence, in good shape, the remaining
80 acres to each Creek citizen man woman and child.</p>
<p>Is it not better to have 360 acres of well fenced and well cultivated
land for six persons than 720 acres of unfenced and uncultivated land?
The other 360 acres which the Indian will dispose of, will, or course,
go into the hands of parties who will at once go to work to raise a
revenue for Uncle Sam one way or another. It is not the object of the
U.S. in making treaties with nations of Indians for the aforesaid lands
to remain blank on the face of this North American continent. Any man
can see that with his hands tied behind him. There has been too many
Indian experts. They have the Indian problem in such a tangle that the
U.S. is like the man who caught the wildcat. She would like for some one
to help let go the cat.</p>
<p>We are not an Indian expert, but we believe if the five year clause had
been left off of the Creek treaty, that it would have had easy sailing
through the Creek council. Reserve the 40 acres for each individual
Creek citizen and let them do as they please with the 120 acres as it
was in the agreement and we will feel that it would be right and if
nothing more, would have been according to the Creek agreement anyway.</p>
<note id="n1f"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg> <p>The Curtis Act (1898) provided for breakup of the tribes and allotment
of their land, with or without their consent. The Creeks, like the other
tribes, negotiated an allotment agreement, or "treaty," which had to be
ratified by the tribe's legislative body, or national council.</p></note>

<head>Passing of Creek Lands</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, June 21, 1901)</hi>
</p>
<p>Chas. Gibson Tells of the Passing of the Last Stomping Ground.</p>
<p>For twenty-five years there has been hatched without number, all leading
in one direction, some way to gobble up this, the last resting place,
the last home of the red man.</p>
<p>Now that the Creek treaty has been ratified, was it the lick or feather
that broke the Creek citizens back?</p>
<p>He is declared a citizen<ref target="n1g">1</ref> of the United States of America. Does he know
what that means, does know what that is, being a citizen of this great
U.S.? How will he know when his rights are being trespassed upon? Who
will advocate his cause? Must he not speak for himself? As long as he
does not say, I am a citizen of this great government and that the world
of men must respect, his nose will be kept to the grind stone. As some
old pelican said in olden times, "the watch word of all citizens of the
Indian Territory should be 'give me statehood and liberty or give me
home rule at least.'"</p>
<p>There are men, white, red and black, who are as able, in the five tribes,
to look after the affairs of this country as they have in any little old
state. But no, congress has rashly promised us more laws than any little
province on the face of the earth. Here among the five tribes we have a
slight touch of the Arkansas law;<ref target="n2g">2</ref> we have some Curtis laws, we have
some Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole laws; we have no
peace and order. That is what the Indian Territory is accused of at any rate.</p>
<p>What this country would need, right now, is statehood in short order. Get
a new broom and foreverlasting sweep these half dozen remnants of
disjointed rules and regulations off the face of the Indian Territory.</p>
<p>If the five tribes are U.S. citizens why not they be recognized as such
and give them home rule as their rights demand?</p>
<p>All the agreements and treaties go on to say we will endeavor by strict
laws to keep all intoxicants out of the Indian Territory. Why have such
stuff in a treaty? If there is anything that an Indian likes it is
whiskey. And if there is any production that a white man loves to sell
it is red whiskey. Whiskey selling to Indians is like hanging for
murder--the idea of stopping either is preposterous. As the fellow said,
that little thing can't be did, and furthermore, history repeats itself.
It is always essential to have whiskey very handy when Indian lands are
on the market. It makes an Indian feel rich enough to sell his land. It
is whiskey that he wants then--it is not land or money--Mr. Injun is now
a great pet. His fur is being rubbed down the right way. He is a bully
good fellow now. A cigar and a social drink don't cost him anything.
Just now he is gulping down great tubs full of flattery. Why? Well, you
know. But say five years from now the place that knew him once will not
be apt to recognize him any more because by that time he will have
worried down his throat enough red whiskey to overflow his 160 acres of
land. Then he will wake up to find himself a befuddled Indian pauper.</p>
<p>Thus will end the Indian's interest in this beautiful garden spot of the
United States.</p>

<head>Government Offices</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, February 14, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>There is, or should be, another government office, but we suppose there
is no one in congress with any poor relations that could fill the
place;<ref target="n1h">1</ref> therefore, it has been overlooked. There is room, or would be,
for three offices; that is, three interpreters for the three districts.
Indians are being constantly tried, some for murder. This crime is one
that consumes a great deal of the time of the court and the English
language itself is put to the test in order to convict or release a
prisoner, white or black.</p>
<p>Now, when we look at a case of a white or black man being tried in the
United States court we wonder what chances there is for hearing an
Indian case where all parties are Indians. This thing of interpreting a
murder trial is not the interpreting of a sermon, or a contract, or a
conversation between Indians and whites.</p>
<p>We are almost satisfied that many a criminal is turned loose and many an
innocent man convicted all on account of incompetent interpreters.</p>
<p>We have lived long among the Indians and whites, understand the Creek
language perfectly and know some English, and we know that it takes one
knowing both to know what awful mistakes can be made in trying to
convert English into the Creek language, and what a job it is to convert
Creek into English. A mistake is made so easily, but one who is
interpreting is never allowed to go back and explain the mistake on the
account of rush of business of the court. Being a court of justice it
cannot be too careful in having a first class interpreter, which animal
is a very rare article, in other words, good interpreters in any of
these five nations are very scarce. You can take our best educated
Indians as a general thing, and they will tell you that they are very
poor interpreters.</p>
<p>We believe congress, or someone who has the power, should have as a
regular salaried officer, a good interpreter, who should be paid enough
to leave his home and attend the courts. In all of these nations the
government pays out a great deal of money to parties undeserving, yet
she spends no money on an interpreter for her courts, which, we think,
is very essential. He is allowed very little pay for his work.</p>
<p>Each commissioner should have an interpreter as well as the court and he
should be paid like other petty officers of the United States.</p>

<head>Red Whiskey</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, July 18, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>Some time ago there came to town from the mountainous district of the
Creek nation one of the knowing ones, as he is called, or in other
words, a bad medicine man. He proceeded to tank up on what Bill
Shakespeare calls "that which cheers, the sad revives, the old inspires,
makes merriness forget her toils and furor her danger." He was of the
kind that can track his enemy at night and make himself visible or
invisible at will in battle. He was all this, yet he had a weakness for
the white man's red whisky. Now, the presence of this thing, whiskey, in
the Indian Territory is contrary to all treaties the U.S. government has
rashly and without aforethought made with the Indian people. So the
great medicine man in question got a little more than the law allowed
him to stand up under and was summarily placed behind the bars. But, by
virtue of his great knowledge of medicine, he escaped and got a citizen
of the town to make bond for him. Then he left and, of course, his
bondsman had to foot up for his bond.</p>
<p>Now, we don't know how this whiskey business is handled by the
authorities, but it seems they handle it very carelessly. In fact, it is
getting so far along that red whiskey can be bought in any territory
town by the drink, bottle or jug; and the men who introduce, sell and
give it away go scot free.</p>
<p>For years Congress has been bombarded with petitions for more laws, more
courts, etc. And these have been promised. Now, whether or not Congress
will impose a tax on red whiskey and make the sale of same legitimate
business in the Territory remains to be seen.</p>

<p>He does not believe there is a happy hunting ground for him or any other
race; but he does believe that people bob up after death in another
state. He believes that the individual enters a new life in some shape
or fashion--maybe as a deer. He does not believe that there is a heaven
or hell; but he does believe that there is a supreme law, being or power
to be adored and which he has named, The One Looking Over the Indian.</p>
<p>The Indian never takes this name in vain. He does not believe in doing
so, and had he a mind to do so, he lacks the language.</p>
<p>There is no natural Indian an infidel. He believes that when he has
committed a wrong he shall in some way suffer for it, but he does not
believe in expiating his misdeeds in jail. Nor does he believe that he
should suffer for crimes committed while intoxicated, or be called to
account for handling intoxicating liquors, having had nothing to do with
its manufacture.</p>
<p>The Indian believes that all treaties which he has made with the general
government have been highly detrimental to his welfare. He believes that
the white man is quick to promise but slow to fulfill; that he himself
is quick to follow the vices of the white man but slow to take on his virtues.</p>
<p>He believes that the Indian was not created to earn his bread by the
sweat of his brow, especially since bread has been on his bill of fare
but a short time.</p>
<p>He does not believe that it is right for monied men to rule the country.
He would rather that a committee of good men, well-tried and worthy, be
delegated to say who shall be ruler. Money or no money, he believes in
the equality of men before the law.</p>
<p>He believes that there are too many seekers after place in the Indian Territory.<ref target="n1i">1</ref></p>
<p>He believes that his country is too good a place for broken down
politicians from the north and the east. He believes that affairs in
this country would prosper just as well without so much out side help.</p>
<p>He believes that if his country is not good enough for some people there
are many ways out of it without being kicked out of it.</p>
<p>He believes that the land buyers will buy all the land in the country if
the Secretary of the Interior does not come down and put them in jail
for contempt or some other charge.</p>
<p>He believes that if the Territory was annexed to Oklahoma or Arkansas, or
to a chicken coop, some rooster would be governor and that the old hens
would gobble up all the offices before the Indian could say scat!</p>

<hi rend="bold">As To Statehood</hi>
</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, November 21, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>It is an old saying that politics makes strange bed fellows. However that
may be, most of the newspapers of the B.I.T. seem to have lots of
politics on hand. Some want single statehood and others hunger for
double statehood.<ref target="n1j">1</ref></p>
<p>Now, all this sort of business is entirely new to the Five Civilized
Tribes. They are rushing along so swiftly in the full current of
progress that the majority of them have never given a single thought to
the affairs of the white man. But it seems to us that the actual owners
of this Indian Territory ought to be allowed a word in the matter of
single or double statehood when the proper time comes, which is not
soon--1906. To a raw recruit, all this scramble to get in the statehood
band wagon seems a little premature. For if the Indian Territory has as
much trouble getting statehood as other territories that have been
admitted into the union, fifteen or twenty years hence will be time
enough to tackle this great question.</p>
<p>It is said that all citizens of the Indian Territory are United States
citizens, but when the claim is tested things are not what they seem.
For instance, an Indian cannot sell a foot of his allotment, deed or no
deed, price or no price, without the consent and approval of the
secretary of the interior. Go way back yonder in Newton county<ref target="n2j">2</ref> and buy
a bed of flint rocks or red clay from a citizen of that county and see
if he asks the approval of any body but Liza Jane<ref target="n3j">3</ref> to consummate the
trade. The citizen of Newton county is a citizen of the United States.
He has a deed to his land and a right to sell it whenever he feels like
it without anyone's consent except Liza's. When she touches the pen,
that settles it. But that practice does not obtain it in the Creek
nation. Any Indian can touch the pen, but it is no go. So it can be seen
that there is a great gulf yawning between the citizen of Newton county
and the citizen of the Creek nation.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Five Civilized Tribes are not allowed to exercise
their rights as United States citizens. In fact, we are allowed nothing
but a small slice of self government and that for only a limited time.
Yet, however small the slice, it might not mix well with single or
double statehood. One fourth of our lands are non-taxable and that would
not, perhaps, suit either Oklahoma or Arkansas. We cannot pool school
funds with either of these counties as yet. Our agreement says no moneys
belonging to the tribe shall be appropriated without the approval of
council, and the agreement provides that the council shall live until
1906. So it seems to us that it will be time enough to talk statehood
when we are United States citizens for keeps. Then we are not acquainted
anyway with those fellows on our borders.</p>
<p>It also appears to us that after five years there will be no room for a
scramble; for by that time all the people from our border states will
have flocked into the Indian Territory and taken up permanent abode.
Annexation then will be useless. The wants of all will then have been
satisfied and any kind of statehood will do--single, double or treble.</p>

<head>The Great Powwow</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, December 5, 1903)</hi>
</p>
<p>The great powwow of the Five Civilized Tribes at Eufaula<ref target="n1k">1</ref> came to an end
last Saturday evening just as the sun went down. To an outsider, it
looked like the last grand and final rally of the Indians of the Territory.</p>
<p>We looked over the representative body at roll call and were somewhat at
a loss to locate the Choctaws, the Indian blood having been about
bleached out of them. It looked to us like a convention of white
Indians. But upon a second survey we succeeded in seeing a few old faces
that said Indian to the core--the faces of Col. Kacher Homahtee<ref target="n2k">2</ref>, Old
Soggy<ref target="n3k">3</ref> and perhaps three others, who could lay claims to being full
blooded American Indians without objection.</p>
<p>Now, these delegates from the different nations were very able men,
however white or red their complexion. They did good work for their
constituents. But they had so much to look after in so short space of
time that we of the ignorant class regret that they did not give enough
time and thought to one little resolution that was offered and turned down.</p>
<p>This little resolution proposed that since there is an element of whites
and blacks among the Indians opposed to being hooked up in the traces
with Oklahoma, let us see how much of this element we can get to help us
in warding off the threatened blow of annexation.</p>
<p>Now, we believe in union; that is, we like lots of help. In fact, if we
can get the other fellow to go ahead and do the necessary work in our
stead we are for enjoying the fruits of his labor. But the convention
did not look at it that way and so turned the little resolution down as
we have stated.</p>
<p>In our judgement, it should not have been done. These whites and blacks
who are in sympathy with the Indians in opposing annexation with
Oklahoma or any other country are good people and believe that the
Indians' interests are theirs also. They have friends in congress as
well as those that seek union with Oklahoma. They would help put up a
strong fight. How much more effective would have been the work of the
convention had it invited the help of these people! Especially when some
of our own people are taking sides against us and appear to be on the
winning side. We believe the convention made a great mistake in not
extending an invitation to outside friends to join hands with the
Indians in the struggle.</p>

<p>Chas. Gibson's Description of Happiness in the Backwoods of Arkansaw.</p>
<p>Once upon a time we were down back yonder rambling around over the
country, looking for a sand rock for a relic. We failed in this but
found lots of flint rocks. While there the good neighbors got up what
they called a rag for our benefit.</p>
<p>The first man on the ground was the neighborhood doctor. Instead of pills
he had a bucket of pine tar and for surgical instruments he had a 10
cent pair of tweezers. He gave the order, or as it were, touched the
button, and each couple took their places, no shoes was the order of the
day, the fiddler started in with three strings and wound up with one.
When recess was taken each couple pranced up to the bar where
refreshments were liberally distributed which treat consisted of
squirrel gravy and gash. This it seems was the toney dish of the season.
When the recess was called and refreshments were over then came the
doctor and extracted the splinters and tarred up the wounds. Then on
went the dance and joy was unconspired until the next morning when the
main feast came off. This consisted of the following delicacies, corn
bread, cold corn and sassafras<ref target="n1l">1</ref> tea. Oh, yes you want to know what is
meant by gash in Arkansas. We will lead you into the dark recesses of
the conglomeration of Arkansas gash, it is bran peas, coon gravy, corn
meal, green mustard a little cabbage, then more corn meal, then a little
sweet potatoes, a little sorghum,<ref target="n2l">2</ref> and just a little rabbit and squirrel
gravey for seasoning. Here we are at sea, this is fully one-half of what
Arkansas gash is made out of. It was a very popular drink especially
[for] the girls. Rabbit and squirrel gravy is very nutrious, that is why
you see in traveling back yonder such rosy cheek girls. The above dish

<head>The Indian: His Past</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, May 16, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>He was monarch of all he surveyed. He wanted for nothing. Food was at his
disposal. He had the pick and choice of such game as his appetite
craved. In short, he subsisted on the fat of the land. Having a
boundless country to roam over and stretch his tepee where he pleased,
he knew nothing of confinement. He owned the earth and enjoyed the
freedom thereof. He was a man and rejoiced in his physical strength. He
was not savage when his rights were respected. He was even humane;
especially in the matter of killing game. He did not destroy game
wantonly. What game he destroyed was for food, not for the sport of it.
The twang of his bowstring did not make the game wild. He could approach
a bear or deer without scaring it out of the country. He did not have
the quality termed "game hog" of nowadays. When he sent an arrow home in
one deer , he did [not] look for a whack at another. He took his split
cane and proceeded to cut the hide loose from the legs, breast, etc,
oblivious to what went on about him. He was very careful not to give the
living deer a scare. He hunted only when he needed food and killed no
more game than was actually necessary. When he thought he needed a
change of meat, he poisoned<ref target="n1m">1</ref> the streams in the summer for fish. The
sport was free to all, likewise the fish. The poisoning of the stream
did not shorten the fish crop.</p>
<p>In his simple happiness, he adored the Giver and gave thanks for
fruits--strawberries, blackberries and so forth.</p>
<p>With the ripening of the corn came his annual festivity. This event was
celebrated with great pomp. He looked upon the corn as being over half
of his living. The festival season was religiously observed by his
entire tribe for eight or ten days. There was no hypocrisy, only pure
simple religion.</p>
<p>During this festival all lost property found was displayed for
identification. Such trivial effects as handkerchiefs, ropes, bells,
bows and arrows were hung up and a talk made notifying all present that
this or that was lost property subject to claim by the owner. Stray
horses and hogs were described and located and the owners thereof went
and got their stock without a cent of cost to themselves. One of the
headmen was always delegated to make a long talk to the young men,
admonishing them to lead up-right lives. There was, also, a renewal of
good friendship and brotherly love. The camps were filled with
rejoicing. Now and then a tear was shed for some dead leader of the
dance, or singer, or medicine man, or fire maker. The widows and orphans
were special guests at the festival. The sympathy of the tribe was
extended to them. Their relatives were admonished to look after them and
make them comfortable.</p>
<p>The young men on these occasions were called up before their elders and
given their war names. The Creeks were all known by their clans. For
instance, a young man of the deer clan was called and when he came up
before the namers he would probably be named Echo Micco, or King Deer.
Each was called and named according to his clan. He was presented with a
piece of tobacco duly cured and wrapped in pawpaw or hickory bark. The
young men so named discarded their old names forever. There was no
hunching, no laughing, no foolishness. The ceremonies were conducted as
sacredly as in any church.</p>
<p>"Don't get mad enough at your neighbor" said the old man to the young
men, "to kill him." "He that will not take this advice is billious,
sickly and a woman in temper.</p>
<p>"Don't take from your fellow-man the worth of an arrow without first
asking his consent.</p>
<p>"Don't talk too freely to your neighbor's wife; it might cause your
neighbor to lose his friendship for you."</p>
<p>"Above all listen to the advice of your elders."</p>
<p>These are some of the rules of conduct the young Indians of the past were
taught to live and die by.</p>

<head>The Indian--His Present</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, May 23, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>He is like a stray horse--everybody is wanting to use him. There is no
Indian today but what is attractive and full of interest. All eyes are
turned on him. Why is it? He is not a solon, nor a railroad magnate, nor
a merchant prince, nor a John Pierpont Morgan. He is not a great
evangelist, nor a person of royal rank, nor a high official of the
United States government. He is only a poor lo.<ref target="n1n">1</ref> Yet, in popular
parlance, he seems to be of a great lot of consequence. Well, the reason
of his popularity is because he is land poor. This is what is the matter
with him. He has more land than he knows what to do with. He is living
at the top of the pot. But friendly strangers have sought abode with
him, volunteering to take care of his surplus domain; and in the shuffle
the Indian has been caught up in the whirl of an everlasting picnic.
Thus is carried out the old sayings, come easy, go easy; let each day
provide for itself. His money is all in large bills and he has to
mortgage twenty dollars to get fifty cents worth of change. He is patted
on the back and told to go in and blow himself.<ref target="n2n">2</ref> He is put next to the
fact that not every man in the United States can boast of 160 acres of
terra firma;<ref target="n3n">3</ref> that there will be lots of land left after he is done
with; that it is no use to be a hale fellow well met unless one is a
hell of a fellow.</p>
<p>The Indian long ago cared but very little for money. He could do without
and not feel inconvenienced. But the Indian of this enlightened age,
being more civilized, has learned that the rattle of silver in one's
jeans commands respect. So he lets go of a few acres of land and is
happy. Nothing like putting on appearances. It is American to do so. Why
can't he, the most genuine and uncompromising American.</p>
<p>The Indian will hold his head up and stay in the front push as long as
his land holds out. He will live easy though he dies a hard death.</p>
<p>There are a few Indians who are holdbacks--that is, not selling any land
and depriving themselves of high living. They seemed to have forgotten
that they are liable to drop off any minute; that there is but one life
to live on this earth.</p>
<p>Now, in regard to the picnic hereinbefore mentioned, a great many talk
like this: you will sell all of your lands and be paupers within a few years.</p>
<p>This sort of talk may be all right, be we are not heeding it, because we
are also told that there will be plenty of land left when we are dead
and gone. So we are taking the money offered for our land and having a
good time, for tomorrow we may die and leave a lot of land for our poor
kinfolks to wrangle over in the courts, causing the legal fraternity no
end of bother.</p>
<p>With these few remarks on the present of the Indian we will proceed to
join the picnickers and shout, on with the dance! let joy be unconfined!</p>

<p>Looking back we see him despised because he is a savage and a shade
darker than the pale face. He is not given to work, cares little for
progress and is without love for money. Is he to be blamed? For all
these faults, if faults they be, he believes that the One looking over
him did not intend that he should work; that had the pale face stayed on
his own side he would to-day be happy.</p>
<p>Not so. He has been driven from one reservation to another until he
should be a worst savage to-day than he was five hundred years ago.</p>
<p>On the shores of the Atlantic he stood a giant. The little waves came and
went, but came oftener and higher as he stood till finally the giant was
forced to retreat from them, seeking safety on the banks. But the waves
followed him there and he retreated still further. He climbed the
mountains, but the waves sought him out, submerging the mountains. Then
the giant set his face unto the setting sun and climbed higher, yet did
the waters follow him. Weakened finally by his march, the giant stopped
and tried to stand his ground, but stumbled in the effort by selling a
piece of American soil to William Penn.<ref target="n1o">1</ref> Then one stumble followed
another until he was swept along with no landing in sight. He struggled
in vain to get away from the waves. He became disgusted with his own
weakness and man's inhumanity to man. He saw nothing to encourage him to
another effort. Meanwhile the waves rose higher.</p>
<p>One of these waves is called the Penn treaty, another the sale of
Alabama, another the Georgia squabble, another the emigration west of
the Mississippi, another the war of the rebellion whereby the giant lost
most of his property, and yet another the misinterpretation of a treaty
in 1866,<ref target="n2o">2</ref> giving the Negro about one-third of the giant's country
without the consideration of one dime.</p>
<p>The giant, or hero, of our fable has been oppressed more than any other
being on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Did you ever stop to think over this case of our hero? Well, about
one-half of our hero's countrymen served as soldiers during the late
war. How much of the rebellion they put down is not recorded, but we
find many old pensioners among the people of the giant. Now, the giant
gets no credit for his loyalty to the union, although the war swept away
about a third of his lost and only lands.</p>
<p>The last wave which will close over the life of the giant, which is not
worth living nohow, will be the winding up of tribal affairs. The wave
is already here.</p>
<p>The old Indian, who came from Alabama, has told his young people, "Even
the children of the pale face will call you bad names; kick you out and
not see that you have your rights. You will only be Indians, the hated
and despised people. If you are liked, it will be only while your land
lasts. Then you will be a vagabond the balance of your miserable life."</p>
<p>Such is the prophecy of the old Indian, who concludes this: "The white
man will say to you, who have sold your land and are begging food and
shelter, 'you are stout and able to work.' The white man's religion
teaches him that by the sweat of his brow shall he eat bread."</p>
<p>So will the noble red man of Cooper<ref target="n3o">3</ref> go down into his grave, if he has
any, unhonored and unsung. So will pass one of the honestest,
truthfulest, kindest, most charitable, hospitable, humblest, most
religious, most wronged, most patient, forbearing, but most revengeful
race of people that ever inhabited the earth.</p>

<head>Passing of the Indian's Religion</head>
<p>
<hi rend="bold">(from <hi rend="italic">Indian Journal</hi>, August 1, 1902)</hi>
</p>
<p>In this so-called free country of America, where a citizen can worship
according to the dictates of his own conscience, or party, the Indian is
fast losing his religion. In a few more years the religion whispered to
him in the wind will be lost entirely.</p>
<p>The Indian's religion was a poor makeshift, but the Great Spirit<ref target="n1p">1</ref> was
satisfied with it. When the wild vine and tree brought forth fruit, the
Indians rejoiced saying, "It is well. He that looks over us has given us
fruits to eat. Therefore let us gather at our Big House<ref target="n2p">2</ref> and rejoice,
cleansing our bodies of the past year's impurities and our minds of the
evil thoughts that we hold against one another."</p>
<p>Thus the Indians worshiped. There was nothing mean--nothing vulgar to mar
the occasion. Good will prevailed. The young men were given good advice
as well as the young girls. Everyone went away wiser and better. There
was no thirst for red whiskey--no intoxication. There was no stealing.</p>
<p>The Indian is now asked, nay, almost compelled to discard this simple,
wholesome religion for the religion of the white man. How pitiful is a
race of people under the foot of the conqueror! Their customs, religion,
everything that made their existence tolerable, wiped out as evils! They
must not hunt; they must not fish; they must not be heathens; but they
can drink red whiskey and indulge in all the vices!</p>

</p>
<p>We have heard of people raising the devil lots of times and we have come
across accounts of the dead being brought to life by divine power, but
we have never known until lately that common everyday cornbread-eating
folks could raise the dead.</p>
<p>This land business in the Creek country has brought many things to light.
For instance, it has leaked out that dead people are being held up in
their graves by their kin folks and made to call for their pro rata
share of land.<ref target="n1q">1</ref> They are made to say that they have not been dead long
enough to be excluded from participation in the land distribution. When
the papers are all fixed up they are allowed to slumber on, while their
lands are sold to land sharks wanting dead Indian lands. This is no
ordinary fable. The writer has been referred to several instances where
dead Indians have received certificates of allotments. If the matter was
investigated, many similar cases might be found.</p>
<note id="n1q"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg> <p>In breaking up the tribes, the U.S. government dissolved the tribes'
common title to the land and gave an equal share, or allotment, to each

</p>
<p>Wakachee,<ref target="n1r">1</ref> the old, weakminded, inoffensive Creek, who has been acting
curious and alarming his neighbors out at Lenna,<ref target="n2r">2</ref> has a queer history,
says Barney Riley.<ref target="n3r">3</ref></p>
<p>A close friendship exists between Wakachee and another Creek full-blood
of the name of Yahola Harjo,<ref target="n4r">4</ref> living somewhere between Muskogee and
Tulsa, who is also given to ways that are dark and tricks that are vain.
They visit each other frequently, and when they are together they hold
council and indulge in "stomp" dances on their own square ground.
Sometimes they sneak off to the woods or mountains and are gone for days.</p>
<p>Wakachee has a son and a stepson,<ref target="n5r">5</ref> both about grown. He has these boys
under fine control and they are ready to do anything that he requires of
them. Recently he had them assist him in building a bonfire of all his
household goods, including his dwelling. There are eight in the family,
himself, wife and six children. Among the things saved from the fire
were three new Winchester rifles and a breech loading shot gun. His
neighbors are scared within an inch of their lives. Some of them believe
that the spells to which Wakachee and his friend Yahola Harjo are
subject are contagious, while others are afraid of great bodily harm at
the hands of the weakminded Indian, who is a strong Snake follower,<ref target="n6r">6</ref> but
who now has no talk to make about politics.</p>
<p>Barney Riley says it is as good as a circus to see Wakachee and his
side-partner go through their performances of entertaining imaginary
friends on the "stomp" ground. Some nights they dance and yell till
daylight, often continuing the performance several nights in succession.
Wakachee's boys are believed to be similarly affected.</p>
<p>The people of the neighborhood believe that they ought to be confined but
are juberous<ref target="n7r">7</ref> about undertaking the job.</p>

</p>
<p>Now, the sale or introduction of the red stuff or other intoxicants in
the B. I. T. is strictly forbidden by law and treaty.<ref target="n2s">2</ref></p>
<p>Now, it happened in about this way:</p>
<p>A certain doctor, we will call him Jones, for it is a short, an uncommon
and a romantic name, ordered some drugs among other stuff that
invigorates the mind, loosens up the joints and causes the individual to
wake up notorious in the calaboose. Having such an uncommon name, Jones
thought that there would be no trouble about the stuff coming through
right-side-up-with-care and be delivered at the door O.K. But it turned
out, about the time the stuff was due, that there was another man who
was also named Jones and who was likewise engaged in the traffic of
drugs. So, when Jones No. 2 called for some stuff that was due him, too,
the station agent, not knowing any other Druggist Jones, of course,
collected express charges nicely for his company and delivered the goods
apparently in good order. Now, there was a day of reckoning ahead. Jones
No. 1 waltzed into the express office and demanded what was coming to
him. The agent was dumbfounded and said "Heaven help me, is your name
Jones? Who would have thought it? I am surprised to find two Joneses all
at one time in the same business at the same time. Now, how am I to know
who's who?"</p>
<p>Curious to relate, both Joneses were Indians.</p>
<p>Jones No. 2 landed home safe and sound with the stuff. Among other things
he discovered a few demijohns of a number one peach brandy, some sixteen
years old and good enough to cause him to make trouble. It came in
mighty handy about busk time.<ref target="n3s">3</ref></p>
<p>We don't know whether or not the Joneses are making any faces over the
matter, but we learned that the sixteen year old is exhausted.</p>
<p>The drayman, failing to collect his bill, let the cat out of the bag.</p>
