<p>
A spectre is haunting Europe -the spectre of communism. All
the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to
exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot,
French Radicals and German police-spies.
</p><p>
Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as
communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition
that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism,
against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against
its reactionary adversaries?
</p><p>
Two things result from this fact:
</p><p>
I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European
powers to be itself a power.
</p><p>
II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the
face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims,
their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre
of communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
</p><p>
To this end, Communists of various nationalities have
assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be
published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and
Danish languages.
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="d6">
<head>Chapter 1:  Bourgeois and Proletarians<ref target="n1.1">[1]</ref></head>
<p>
The history of all hitherto existing society<ref target="n1.2">[2]</ref>
is the history of class struggles.
</p><p>
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf,
guild-master<ref target="n1.3">[3]</ref> and journeyman, in a word,
oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another,
carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that
each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society
at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.
</p><p>
In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a
complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a
manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have
patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal
lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in
almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.
</p><p>
   The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins
of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It
has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression,
new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.
</p><p>
   Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however,
this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society
as
a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps,
into two great classes directly facing each other -bourgeoisie
and proletariat.
</p><p>
   From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered
burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first
elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.
</p><p>
   The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened
up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and
Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the
colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in
commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to
industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the
revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid
development.
</p><p>
   The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production
was monopolized by closed guilds, now no longer suffices for the
growing wants of the new markets. The manufacturing system took
its place. The guild-masters were pushed aside by the
manufacturing middle class; division of labor between the different
corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labor in each
single workshop.
</p><p>
   Meantime, the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever
rising. Even manufacturers no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam
and machinery revolutionized industrial production. The place of
manufacture was taken by the giant, Modern Industry; the place of
the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires, the leaders
of the whole industrial armies, the modern bourgeois.
</p><p>
   Modern industry has established the world market, for which the
discovery of America paved the way. This market has given an
immense development to commerce, to navigation, to
communication by land. This development has, in turn, reacted on
the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry,
commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion
the bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into
the background every class handed down from the Middle Ages.
</p><p>
   We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the
product of a long course of development, of a series of
revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange.
</p><p>
   Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was
accompanied by a corresponding political advance in that class.
An oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility, an
armed and self-governing association of medieval commune<ref
target="n1.4">[4]</ref>:
here independent urban republic (as in Italy and Germany); there
taxable "third estate" of the monarchy (as in France); afterward, in
the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the semi-feudal
or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility,
and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general -the
bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern
Industry and of the world market, conquered for itself, in the
modern representative state, exclusive political sway. The
executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the
common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary
part.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put
an end to all feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has
pitilessly
torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his "natural
superiors", and has left no other nexus between man and man
than naked self-interest, than callous "cash payment". It has
drowned out the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour, of
chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy
water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth
into
exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible
chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable
freedom -Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by
religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked,
shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation
hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe. It has
converted the physician, the lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man
of science, into its paid wage laborers.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental
veil, and has reduced the family relation into a mere money
relation.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the
brutal display of vigour in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries
so much admire, found its fitting complement in the most slothful
indolence. It has been the first to show what man's activity can
bring about. It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian
pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has
conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of
nations and crusades.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing
the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of
production, and with them the whole relations of society.
Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form,
was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all
earlier
industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production,
uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting
uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all
earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of
ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away,
all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify.
All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned, and
man
is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of
life and his relations with his kind.
</p><p>
   The need of a constantly expanding market for its products
chases the bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It
must nestle everywhere, settle everywhere, establish connections
everywhere.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie has, through its exploitation of the world
market, given a cosmopolitan character to production and
consumption in every country. To the great chagrin of
reactionaries, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the
national ground on which it stood. All old-established national
industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.
They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction
becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by
industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw
material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products
are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the
globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the
country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the
products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and
national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in
every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in
material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual
creations of individual nations become common property. National
one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more
impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures,
there arises a world literature.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of
production, by the immensely facilitated means of communication,
draws all, even the most barbarian, nations into civilization. The
cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which it
forces the barbarians' intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to
capitulate. It compels all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt
the bourgeois mode of production; it compels them to introduce
what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e., to become
bourgeois
themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own image.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the
towns. It has created enormous cities, has greatly increased the
urban population as compared with the rural, and has thus
rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of
rural life. Just as it has made the country dependent on the towns,
so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent
on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of
bourgeois, the East on the West.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the
scattered state of the population, of the means of production, and
of property. It has agglomerated population, centralized the means
of production, and has concentrated property in a few hands. The
necessary consequence of this was political centralization.
Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, with separate
interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became
lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code
of laws, one national class interest, one frontier, and one customs
tariff.
</p><p>
   The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years,
has created more massive and more colossal productive forces
than have all preceding generations together. Subjection of
nature's forces to man, machinery, application of chemistry to
industry and agriculture, steam navigation, railways, electric
telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation,
canalization or rivers, whole populations conjured out of the
ground -what earlier century had even a presentiment that such
productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor?
</p><p>
   We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on
whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated
in feudal society. At a certain stage in the development of these
means of production and of exchange, the conditions under
which feudal society produced and exchanged, the feudal
organization of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one
word, the feudal relations of property became no longer
compatible with the already developed productive forces; they
became so many fetters. They had to be burst asunder; they were
burst asunder.
</p><p>
   Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a
social and political constitution adapted in it, and the economic
and political sway of the bourgeois class.
</p><p>
   A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern
bourgeois society, with its relations of production, of exchange
and of property, a society that has conjured up such gigantic
means of production and of exchange, is like the sorcerer who is
no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he
has called up by his spells. For many a decade past, the history
of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of
modern productive forces against modern conditions of
production, against the property relations that are the conditions
for the existence of the bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to
mention the commercial crises that, by their periodical return, put
the existence of the entire bourgeois society on its trial, each
time
more threateningly. In these crises, a great part not only of the
existing products, but also of the previously created productive
forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks
out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an
absurdity -the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly
finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it
appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation, had cut off
the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and commerce
seem to be destroyed. And why? Because there is too much
civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry,
too much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of
society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions
of bourgeois property; on the contrary, they have become too
powerful for these conditions, by which they are fettered, and so
soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring disorder into the
whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of bourgeois
property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to
comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the
bourgeoisie get over these crises? On the one hand, by enforced
destruction of a mass of productive forces; on the other, by the
conquest of new markets, and by the more thorough exploitation
of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the way for more
extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the
means whereby crises are prevented.
</p><p>
   The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the
ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.
</p><p>
   But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring
death to itself; it has also called into existence the men who are
to
wield those weapons -the modern working class -the
proletarians.
</p><p>
   In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in
the same proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class,
developed -a class of laborers, who live only so long as they
find work, and who find work only so long as their labor increases
capital. These laborers, who must sell themselves piecemeal, are
a commodity, like every other article of commerce, and are
consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all
the fluctuations of the market.
</p><p>
   Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of
labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual
character,
and, consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an
appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most
monotonous, and most easily acquired knack, that is required of
him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted,
almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for
maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price of
a commodity, and therefore also of labor, is equal to its cost of
production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the
work increases, the wage decreases. What is more, in proportion
as the use of machinery and division of labor increases, in the
same proportion the burden of toil also increases, whether by
prolongation of the working hours, by the increase of the work
exacted in a given time, or by increased speed of machinery, etc.
</p><p>
   Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the
patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial
capitalist.
Masses of laborers, crowded into the factory, are organized like
soldiers. As privates of the industrial army, they are placed under
the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not
only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois
state; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the
overlooker, and, above all, in the individual bourgeois
manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims
gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and
the more embittering it is.
</p><p>
   The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual
labor, in other words, the more modern industry becomes
developed, the more is the labor of men superseded by that of
women. Differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive
social validity for the working class. All are instruments of labor,
more or less expensive to use, according to their age and sex.
</p><p>
   No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer,
so far at an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is
set upon by the other portion of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the
shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, etc.
</p><p>
   The lower strata of the middle class -the small tradespeople,
shopkeepers, and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen
and peasants -all these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly
because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on
which Modern Industry is carried on, and is swamped in the
competition with the large capitalists, partly because their
specialized skill is rendered worthless by new methods of
production. Thus, the proletariat is recruited from all classes of
the
population.
</p><p>
   The proletariat goes through various stages of development.
With its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first,
the contest is carried on by individual laborers, then by the work of
people of a factory, then by the operative of one trade, in one
locality, against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits
them. They direct their attacks not against the bourgeois condition
of production, but against the instruments of production
themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their
labor, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze,
they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman
of the Middle Ages.
</p><p>
   At this stage, the laborers still form an incoherent mass
scattered over the whole country, and broken up by their mutual
competition. If anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies,
this is not yet the consequence of their own active union, but of
the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order to attain its
own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat in
motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this
stage, therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but
the
enemies of their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the
landowners, the non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeois.
Thus, the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands
of the bourgeoisie; every victory so obtained is a victory for the
bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   But with the development of industry, the proletariat not only
increases in number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses,
its strength grows, and it feels that strength more. The various
interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat
are more and more equalized, in proportion as machinery
obliterates all distinctions of labor, and nearly everywhere
reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition
among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make
the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing
improvement of machinery, ever more rapidly developing, makes
their livelihood more and more precarious; the collisions between
individual workmen and individual bourgeois take more and more
the character of collisions between two classes. Thereupon, the
workers begin to form combinations (trade unions) against the
bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of
wages; they found permanent associations in order to make
provision beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there,
the contest breaks out into riots.
</p><p>
   Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time.
The real fruit of their battles lie not in the immediate result, but
in
the ever expanding union of the workers. This union is helped on
by the improved means of communication that are created by
Modern Industry, and that place the workers of different localities
in contact with one another. It was just this contact that was
needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all of the same
character, into one national struggle between classes. But every
class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain
which the burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable
highways, required centuries, the modern proletarian, thanks to
railways, achieve in a few years.
</p><p>
   This organization of the proletarians into a class, and,
consequently, into a political party, is continually being upset
again by the competition between the workers themselves. But it
ever rises up again, stronger, firmer, mightier. It compels
legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers, by
taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself.
Thus, the Ten-Hours Bill in England was carried.
</p><p>
   Altogether, collisions between the classes of the old society
further in many ways the course of development of the proletariat.
The bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first
with the aristocracy; later on, with those portions of the
bourgeoisie itself, whose interests have become antagonistic to
the progress of industry; at all time with the bourgeoisie of
foreign
countries. In all these battles, it sees itself compelled to appeal
to
the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus to drag it into the
political
arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the proletariat
with its own elements of political and general education, in other
words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the
bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling
class are, by the advance of industry, precipitated into the
proletariat, or are at least threatened in their conditions of
existence. These also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of
enlightenment and progress.
</p><p>
   Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive
hour, the progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class,
in fact within the whole range of old society, assumes such a
violent, glaring character, that a small section of the ruling class
cuts itself adrift, and joins the revolutionary class, the class
that
holds the future in its hands. Just as, therefore, at an earlier
period, a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie, so
now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat, and
in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who have
raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the
historical movement as a whole.
</p><p>
   Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie
today, the proletariat alone is a genuinely revolutionary class. The
other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern
Industry; the proletariat is its special and essential product.
</p><p>
   The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the
shopkeeper, the artisan, the peasant, all these fight against the
bourgeoisie, to save from extinction their existence as fractions of
the middle class. They are therefore not revolutionary, but
conservative. Nay, more, they are reactionary, for they try to roll
back the wheel of history. If, by chance, they are revolutionary,
they are only so in view of their impending transfer into the
proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future
interests; they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at
that of the proletariat.
</p><p>
   The "dangerous class", the social scum, that passively rotting
mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here
and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution;
its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more for the part of
a
bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.
</p><p>
   In the condition of the proletariat, those of old society at
large
are already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property;
his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in
common with the bourgeois family relations; modern industry labor,
modern subjection to capital, the same in England as in France,
in America as in Germany, has stripped him of every trace of
national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so many
bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many
bourgeois interests.
</p><p>
   All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to
fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large
to their conditions of appropriation. The proletarians cannot
become masters of the productive forces of society, except by
abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation, and thereby
also every other previous mode of appropriation. They have
nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to
destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual
property.
</p><p>
   All previous historical movements were movements of
minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian
movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the
immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority. The
proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir,
cannot raise itself up, without the whole super incumbent strata of
official society being sprung into the air.
</p><p>
   Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the
proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle.
The
proletariat of each country must, of course, first of all settle
matters with its own bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   In depicting the most general phases of the development of the
proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging
within existing society, up to the point where that war breaks out
into open revolution, and where the violent overthrow of the
bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat.
</p><p>
   Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have
already seen, on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed
classes. But in order to oppress a class, certain conditions must
be assured to it under which it can, at least, continue its slavish
existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, raised himself to
membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, under
the yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a
bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead of rising
with the process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the
conditions of existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper,
and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth.
And here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit any
longer to be the ruling class in society, and to impose its
conditions of existence upon society as an overriding law. It is
unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to
its
slave within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink
into such a state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by
him. Society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other
words, its existence is no longer compatible with society.
</p><p>
   The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of
the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital;
the condition for capital is wage labor. Wage labor rests
exclusively on competition between the laborers. The advance of
industry, whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie, replaces
the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by the
revolutionary combination, due to association. The development
of Modern Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very
foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates
products. What the bourgeoisie therefore produces, above all, are
its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat
are equally inevitable.

von Maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all
Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, village
communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form
of society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organization
of this primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical
form, by Lewis Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery
of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe. With
the dissolution of the primeval communities, society begins to be
differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes. I
have attempted to retrace this dissolution in The Origin of the Family,
Private Property, and the State, second edition, Stuttgart, 1886.</p></note>

<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d7">
<head>Chapter 2. Proletarians and Communists</head>
<p>
In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as
a whole? The Communists do not form a separate party opposed
to the other working-class parties.
</p><p>
   They have no interests separate and apart from those of the
proletariat as a whole.
</p><p>
   They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by
which to shape and mold the proletarian movement.
</p><p>
   The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class
parties by this only:
</p><p>
    (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the
    different countries, they point out and bring to the front
    the common interests of the entire proletariat,
    independently of all nationality.
</p><p>
    (2) In the various stages of development which the
    struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has
    to pass through, they always and everywhere represent
    the interests of the movement as a whole.
</p><p>
   The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand practically, the
most advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties
of every country, that section which pushes forward all others; on
the other hand, theoretically, they have over the great mass of the
proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the lines of
march, the conditions, and the ultimate general results of the
proletarian movement.
</p><p>
   The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all
other proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a
class,
overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political
power by the proletariat.
</p><p>
   The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way
based on ideas or principles that have been invented, or
discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer.
</p><p>
   They merely express, in general terms, actual relations
springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical
movement going on under our very eyes. The abolition of existing
property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism.
</p><p>
   All property relations in the past have continually been subject
to historical change consequent upon the change in historical
conditions.
</p><p>
   The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property
in favor of bourgeois property.
</p><p>
   The distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of
property generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But
modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete
expression of the system of producing and appropriating products
that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the
many by the few.
</p><p>
   In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up
in the single sentence: Abolition of private property.
</p><p>
   We Communists have been reproached with the desire of
abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit
of
a man's own labor, which property is alleged to be the
groundwork of all personal freedom, activity and independence.
</p><p>
   Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean
the property of petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of
property that preceded the bourgeois form? There is no need to
abolish that; the development of industry has to a great extent
already destroyed it, and is still destroying it daily.
</p><p>
   Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?
</p><p>
   But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a
bit. It creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits
wage labor, and which cannot increase except upon conditions of
begetting a new supply of wage labor for fresh exploitation.
Property, in its present form, is based on the antagonism of capital
and wage labor. Let us examine both sides of this antagonism.
</p><p>
   To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a
social status in production. Capital is a collective product, and
only by the united action of many members, nay, in the last resort,
only by the united action of all members of society, can it be set
in motion.
</p><p>
   Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.
</p><p>
   When, therefore, capital is converted into common property,
into the property of all members of society, personal property is
not thereby transformed into social property. It is only the social
character of the property that is changed. It loses its class
character.
</p><p>
   Let us now take wage labor.
</p><p>
   The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that
quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite
to keep the laborer in bare existence as a laborer. What,
therefore, the wage laborer appropriates by means of his labor
merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence. We by
no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the
products of labor, an appropriation that is made for the
maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no
surplus wherewith to command the labor of others. All that we
want to do away with is the miserable character of this
appropriation, under which the laborer lives merely to increase
capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of
the
ruling class requires it.
</p><p>
   In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to increase
accumulated labor. In communist society, accumulated labor is but
a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the
laborer.
</p><p>
   In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present;
in communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois
society, capital is independent and has individuality, while the
living person is dependent and has no individuality.
</p><p>
   And the abolition of this state of things is called by the
bourgeois, abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so.
The abolition of bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence,
and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at.
</p><p>
   By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of
production, free trade, free selling and buying.
</p><p>
   But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying
disappears also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all
the other "brave words" of our bourgeois about freedom in
general, have a meaning, if any, only in contrast with restricted
selling and buying, with the fettered traders of the Middle Ages,
but have no meaning when opposed to the communist abolition of
buying and selling, or the bourgeois conditions of production, and
of the bourgeoisie itself.
</p><p>
   You are horrified at our intending to do away with private
property. But in your existing society, private property is already
done away with for nine-tenths of the population; its existence for
the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those
nine-tenths. You reproach us, therefore, with intending to do
away with a form of property, the necessary condition for whose
existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense
majority of society.
</p><p>
   In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with
your property. Precisely so; that is just what we intend.
</p><p>
   From the moment when labor can no longer be converted into
capital, money, or rent, into a social power capable of being
monopolized, i.e., from the moment when individual property can
no longer be transformed into bourgeois property, into capital,
from that moment, you say, individuality vanishes.
</p><p>
   You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no
other person than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of
property. This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and
made impossible.
</p><p>
   Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the
products of society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power
to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriations.
</p><p>
   It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property,
all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.
</p><p>
   According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have
gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those who acquire
anything, do not work. The whole of this objection is but another
expression of the tautology: There can no longer be any wage
labor when there is no longer any capital.
</p><p>
   All objections urged against the communistic mode of
producing and appropriating material products, have, in the same
way, been urged against the communistic mode of producing and
appropriating intellectual products. Just as to the bourgeois, the
disappearance of class property is the disappearance of
production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is to him
identical with the disappearance of all culture.
</p><p>
   That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous
majority, a mere training to act as a machine.
</p><p>
   But don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended
abolition of bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois
notions of freedom, culture, law, etc. Your very ideas are but the
outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and
bourgeois property, just as your jurisprudence is but the will of
your class made into a law for all, a will whose essential
character and direction are determined by the economical
conditions of existence of your class.
</p><p>
   The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into
eternal laws of nature and of reason the social forms stringing
from your present mode of production and form of property &mdash;
historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of
production &mdash; this misconception you share with every ruling
class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case of
ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property,
you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own
bourgeois form of property.
</p><p>
   Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this
infamous proposal of the Communists.
</p><p>
   On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family,
based? On capital, on private gain. In its completely developed
form, this family exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state
of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the
family among proletarians, and in public prostitution.
</p><p>
   The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its
complement vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of
capital.
</p><p>
   Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of
children by their parents? To this crime we plead guilty.
</p><p>
   But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when
we replace home education by social.
</p><p>
   And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by
the social conditions under which you educate, by the
intervention direct or indirect, of society, by means of schools,
etc.? The Communists have not intended the intervention of
society in education; they do but seek to alter the character of
that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence of
the ruling class.
</p><p>
   The bourgeois claptrap about the family and education, about
the hallowed correlation of parents and child, becomes all the
more disgusting, the more, by the action of Modern Industry, all
the family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder, and their
children transformed into simple articles of commerce and
instruments of labor.
</p><p>
   But you Communists would introduce community of women,
screams the bourgeoisie in chorus.
</p><p>
   The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production.
He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in
common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion that the
lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.
</p><p>
   He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to
do away with the status of women as mere instruments of
production.
</p><p>
   For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous
indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which,
they pretend, is to be openly and officially established by the
Communists. The Communists have no need to introduce free
love; it has existed almost from time immemorial.
</p><p>
   Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of
their proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common
prostitutes, take the greatest pleasure in seducing each other's
wives.
</p><p>
   Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common
and thus, at the most, what the Communists might possibly be
reproached with is that they desire to introduce, in substitution
for
a hypocritically concealed, an openly legalized system of free
love. For the rest, it is self-evident that the abolition of the
present
system of production must bring with it the abolition of free love
springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution both public and
private.
</p><p>
   The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish
countries and nationality.
</p><p>
   The working men have no country. We cannot take from them
what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all
acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of
the nation, must constitute itself the nation, it is, so far, itself
national, though not in the bourgeois sense of the word.
</p><p>
   National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily
more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the
bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world market, to
uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life
corresponding thereto.
</p><p>
   The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still
faster. United action of the leading civilized countries at least is
one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.
</p><p>
   In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another
will also be put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by
another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism
between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one
nation to another will come to an end.
</p><p>
   The charges against communism made from a religious, a
philosophical and, generally, from an ideological standpoint, are
not deserving of serious examination.
</p><p>
   Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas,
views, and conception, in one word, man's consciousness,
changes with every change in the conditions of his material
existence, in his social relations and in his social life?
</p><p>
   What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual
production changes its character in proportion as material
production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever
been the ideas of its ruling class.
</p><p>
   When people speak of the ideas that revolutionize society, they
do but express that fact that within the old society the elements of
a new one have been created, and that the dissolution of the old
ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions
of existence.
</p><p>
   When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient
religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas
succumbed in the eighteenth century to rationalist ideas, feudal
society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary
bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of
conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free
competition within the domain of knowledge.
</p><p>
   "Undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious, moral, philosophical,
and juridicial ideas have been modified in the course of historical
development. But religion, morality, philosophy, political science,
and law, constantly survived this change."
</p><p>
   "There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice,
etc., that are common to all states of society. But communism
abolishes eternal truths, it abolishes all religion, and all
morality,
instead of constituting them on a new basis; it therefore acts in
contradiction to all past historical experience."
</p><p>
   What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all
past society has consisted in the development of class
antagonisms, antagonisms that assumed different forms at different
epochs.
</p><p>
   But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to
all past ages, viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the
other. No wonder, then, that the social consciousness of past
ages, despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays, moves
within certain common forms, or general ideas, which cannot
completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class
antagonisms.
</p><p>
   The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with
traditional relations; no wonder that its development involved the
most radical rupture with traditional ideas.
</p><p>
   But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to
communism.
</p><p>
   We have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the
working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling
class to win the battle of democracy.
</p><p>
   The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by
degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all
instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.e., of the
proletariat organized as the ruling class; and to increase the total
productive forces as rapidly as possible.
</p><p>
   Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by
means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the
conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures,
therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable,
but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves,
necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are
unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of
production.
</p><p>
   These measures will, of course, be different in different
countries.
</p><p>
   Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be
pretty generally applicable.
</p><p>
1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.
</p><p>
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
</p><p>
3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.
</p><p>
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
</p><p>
5. Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means
of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.
</p><p>
6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport
in the hands of the state.
</p><p>
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the
state; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and the improvement
of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
</p><p>
8. Equal obligation of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies,
especially for agriculture.
</p><p>
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual
abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more
equable distribution of the populace over the country.
</p><p>
10. Free education for all children in public schools.
Abolition of children's factory labor in its present form.
Combination of education with industrial production, etc.
</p><p>
   When, in the course of development, class distinctions have
disappeared, and all production has been concentrated in the
hands of a vast association of the whole nation, the public power
will lose its political character. Political power, properly so
called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing
another. If the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie
is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself as a
class; if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling
class, and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of
production, then it will, along with these conditions, have swept
away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of
classes generally, and will thereby have abolished its own
supremacy as a class.
</p><p>
   In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class
antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development
of each is the condition for the free development of all.

<div2 type="section" n="1" id="d9"><head>1. Reactionary Socialism</head>

<div3 type="part" n="1" id="d10"><head>A. Feudal Socialism</head>
<p>
   Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the
aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against
modern bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July 1830,
and in the English reform agitation, these aristocracies again
succumbed to the hateful upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political
struggle was altogether out of the question. A literary battle alone
remained possible. But even in the domain of literature, the old
cries of the restoration period had become impossible.<ref
target="n3.1.A.1">[1]</ref>
</p><p>
   In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to
lose sight, apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate its
indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited
working class alone. Thus, the aristocracy took their revenge by
singing lampoons on their new masters and whispering in his ears
sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.
</p><p>
   In this way arose feudal socialism: half lamentation, half
lampoon; half an echo of the past, half menace of the future; at
times, by its bitter, witty and incisive criticism, striking the
bourgeoisie to the very heart's core, but always ludicrous in its
effect, through total incapacity to comprehend the march of
modern history.
</p><p>
   The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the
proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often
as it joined them, saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of
arms, and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter.
</p><p>
   One section of the French Legitimists and "Young England"
exhibited this spectacle:
</p><p>
   In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to
that of the bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited
under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and
that are now antiquated. In showing that, under their rule, the
modern proletariat never existed, they forget that the modern
bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society.
</p><p>
   For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character
of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois
amounts to this: that under the bourgeois regime a class is being
developed which is destined to cut up, root and branch, the old
order of society.
</p><p>
   What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it
creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary
proletariat.
</p><p>
   In political practice, therefore, they join in all corrective
measures against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite
their high-falutin phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples
dropped from the tree of industry, and to barter truth, love, and
honour, for traffic in wool, beetroot-sugar, and potato
spirits.<ref target="n3.1.A.2">[2]</ref>
</p><p>
   As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord,
so has clerical socialism with feudal socialism.
</p><p>
   Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a socialist
tinge. Has not Christianity declaimed against private property,
against marriage, against the state? Has it not preached in the
place of these, charity and poverty, celibacy and mortification of
the flesh, monastic life and Mother Church? Christian socialism is
but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the
heart-burnings of the aristocrat.
</p>
<note id="n3.1.A.1"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg> <p>Not the English Restoration (1660-1689),
but the French Restoration (1814-1830).</p></note>
<note id="n3.1.A.2"><seg type="note-symbol">[2]</seg> <p>This applies chiefly to Germany, where the
landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their
estates cultivated for their own account by stewards, and are,
moreover, extensive beetroot-sugar manufacturers and distillers of
potato spirits. The wealthier british aristocracy are, as yet,
rather above that; but they, too, know how to make up for declining
rents by lending their names to floaters or more or less shady
joint-stock companies.</p></note>
</div3>

<div3 type="part" n="2" id="d11">
<head>B. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism</head>
<p>
   The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined
by the bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of
existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern
bourgeois society. The medieval burgesses and the small peasant
proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie. In
those countries which are but little developed, industrially and
commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side with
the rising bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   In countries where modern civilization has become fully
developed, a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed,
fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie, and ever
renewing itself a supplementary part of bourgeois society. The
individual members of this class, however, as being constantly
hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and,
as Modern Industry develops, they even see the moment
approaching when they will completely disappear as an
independent section of modern society, to be replaced in
manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs
and shopmen.
</p><p>
   In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more
than half of the population, it was natural that writers who sided
with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in their
criticism of the bourgeois rEgime, the standard of the peasant
and
petty bourgeois, and from the standpoint of these intermediate
classes, should take up the cudgels for the working class. Thus
arose petty-bourgeois socialism. Sismondi was the head of this
school, not only in France but also in England.
</p><p>
   This school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the
contradictions in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare
the hypocritical apologies of economists. It proved,
incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects of machinery and division
of labor; the concentration of capital and land in a few hands;
overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the
petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the
anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution
of
wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the
dissolution of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the
old nationalities.
</p><p>
   In it positive aims, however, this form of socialism aspires
either
to restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and
with them the old property relations, and the old society, or to
cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within
the framework of the old property relations that have been, and
were bound to be, exploded by those means. In either case, it is
both reactionary and Utopian.
</p><p>
   Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal
relations in agriculture.
</p><p>
   Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all
intoxicating effects of self-deception, this form of socialism ended
in a miserable hangover.

<head>C. German or "True" Socialism</head>
<p>
   The socialist and communist literature of France, a literature
that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and
that was the expressions of the struggle against this power, was
introduced into Germany at a time when the bourgeoisie in that
country had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism.
</p><p>
   German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux
esprits (men of letters), eagerly seized on this literature, only
forgetting that when these writings immigrated from France into
Germany, French social conditions had not immigrated along with
them. In contact with German social conditions, this French
literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed
a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the
eighteenth century, the demands of the first French Revolution
were nothing more than the demands of "Practical Reason" in
general, and the utterance of the will of the revolutionary French
bourgeoisie signified, in their eyes, the laws of pure will, of will
as
it was bound to be, of true human will generally.
</p><p>
   The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the
new French ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical
conscience, or rather, in annexing the French ideas without
deserting their own philosophic point of view.
</p><p>
   This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign
language is appropriated, namely, by translation.
</p><p>
   It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic
saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of
ancient heathendom had been written. The German literati
reversed this process with the profane French literature. They
wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French original.
For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic
functions of money, they wrote "alienation of humanity", and
beneath the French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote
"dethronement of the category of the general", and so forth.
</p><p>
   The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of
the French historical criticisms, they dubbed "Philosophy of
Action", "True Socialism", "German Science of Socialism",
"Philosophical Foundation of Socialism", and so on.
</p><p>
   The French socialist and communist literature was thus
completely emasculated. And, since it ceased, in the hands of the
German, to express the struggle of one class with the other, he felt
conscious of having overcome "French one-sidedness" and of
representing, not true requirements, but the requirements of truth;
not the interests of the proletariat, but the interests of human
nature, of man in general, who belongs to no class, has no
reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical
fantasy.
</p><p>
   This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so
seriously and solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in
such a mountebank fashion, meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic
innocence.
</p><p>
   The fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian
bourgeoisie, against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in
other words, the liberal movement, became more earnest.
</p><p>
   By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to "True"
Socialism of confronting the political movement with the socialistic
demands, of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism,
against representative government, against bourgeois competition,
bourgeois freedom of the press, bourgeois legislation, bourgeois
liberty and equality, and of preaching to the masses that they had
nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this bourgeois
movement. German socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the
French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the
existence of modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding
economic conditions of existence, and the political constitution
adapted thereto, the very things those attainment was the object
of the pending struggle in Germany.
</p><p>
   To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons,
professors, country squires, and officials, it served as a welcome
scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and
bullets,
with which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the
German working-class risings.
</p><p>
   While this "True" Socialism thus served the government as a
weapon for fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time,
directly represented a reactionary interest, the interest of German
philistines. In Germany, the petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the
sixteenth century, and since then constantly cropping up again
under the various forms, is the real social basis of the existing
state of things.
</p><p>
   To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of
things
in Germany. The industrial and political supremacy of the
bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction -on the one
hand, from the concentration of capital; on the other, from the rise
of a revolutionary proletariat. "True" Socialism appeared to kill
these two birds with one stone. It spread like an epidemic.
</p><p>
   The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of
rhetoric, steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this
transcendental robe in which the German Socialists wrapped their
sorry "eternal truths", all skin and bone, served to wonderfully
increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public. And on its
part German socialism recognized, more and more, its own calling
as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois philistine.
</p><p>
   It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the
German petty philistine to be the typical man. To every villainous
meanness of this model man, it gave a hidden, higher, socialistic
interpretation, the exact contrary of its real character. It went to
the extreme length of directly opposing the "brutally destructive"
tendency of communism, and of proclaiming its supreme and
impartial contempt of all class struggles. With very few exceptions,
all the so-called socialist and communist publications that now
(1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and
enervating literature.<ref target="n3.1.C.1">[1]</ref>
</p>
<note id="n3.1.C.1"><seg type="note-symbol">[1]</seg> <p>The revolutionary storm of 1848 swept

<head>2. Conservative or Bourgeois Socialism</head>
<p>
   A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social
grievances in order to secure the continued existence of
bourgeois society.
</p><p>
   To this section belong economists, philanthropists,
humanitarians, improvers of the condition of the working class,
organizers of charity, members of societies for the prevention of
cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, hole-and-corner
reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism has,
moreover, been worked out into complete systems.
</p><p>
   We may cite Proudhon's Philosophy of Poverty as an example
of this form.
</p><p>
   The socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern
social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily
resulting therefrom. They desire the existing state of society,
minus
its revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a
bourgeoisie without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally
conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best; and
bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable conception into
various more or less complete systems. In requiring the proletariat
to carry out such a system, and thereby to march straightaway
into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality that the
proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but
should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this
socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in
the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political
reform, but only a change in the material conditions of existence,
in economical relations, could be of any advantage to them. By
changes in the material conditions of existence, this form of
socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the
bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be
affected only by a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on
the continued existence of these relations; reforms, therefore, that
in no respect affect the relations between capital and labor, but,
at
the best, lessen the cost, and simplify the administrative work of
bourgeois government.
</p><p>
   Bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when, and
only when, it becomes a mere figure of speech.
</p><p>
   Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective
duties: for the benefit of the working class. Prison reform: for the
benefit of the working class. This is the last word and the only
seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism.
</p><p>
   It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois -for the benefit of the working class.
</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d14">
<head>3. Critical-Utopian Socialism and Communism</head>
<p>
   We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great
modern revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the
proletariat, such as the writings of Babeuf and others.
</p><p>
   The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own
ends,
made in times of universal excitement, when feudal society was
being overthrown, necessarily failed, owing to the then
undeveloped state of the proletariat, as well as to the absence of
the economic conditions for its emancipation, conditions that had
yet to be produced, and could be produced by the impending
bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that
accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had
necessarily a reactionary character. It inculcated universal
asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form.
</p><p>
   The socialist and communist systems, properly so called, those
of Saint-Simon, Fourier, Owen, and others, spring into existence
in the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle
between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois
and Proletarians).
</p><p>
   The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class
antagonisms, as well as the action of the decomposing elements
in the prevailing form of society. But the proletariat, as yet in
its
infancy, offers to them the spectacle of a class without any
historical initiative or any independent political movement.
</p><p>
   Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace
with the development of industry, the economic situation, as they
find it, does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for
the
emancipation of the proletariat. They therefore search after a new
social science, after new social laws, that are to create these
conditions.
</p><p>
   Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action;
historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones;
and the gradual, spontaneous class organization of the proletariat
to an organization of society especially contrived by these
inventors. Future history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the
propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans.
</p><p>
   In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring
chiefly for the interests of the working class, as being the most
suffering class. Only from the point of view of being the most
suffering class does the proletariat exist for them.
</p><p>
   The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their
own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider
themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to
improve the condition of every member of society, even that of
the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at
large, without the distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the
ruling class. For how can people when once they understand
their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best
possible state of society?
</p><p>
   Hence, they reject all political, and especially all
revolutionary
action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means,
necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to
pave the way for the new social gospel.
</p><p>
   Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when
the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a
fantastic conception of its own position, correspond with the first
instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of
society.
</p><p>
   But these socialist and communist publications contain also a
critical element. They attack every principle of existing society.
Hence, they are full of the most valuable materials for the
enlightenment of the working class. The practical measures
proposed in them -such as the abolition of the distinction
between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on of
industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage
system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the
function of the state into a more superintendence of production -all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class
antagonisms which were, at that time, only just cropping up, and
which, in these publications, are recognized in their earliest
indistinct and undefined forms only. These proposals, therefore,
are of a purely utopian character.
</p><p>
   The significance of critical-utopian socialism and communism
bears an inverse relation to historical development. In proportion
as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape,
this fantastic standing apart from the contest, these fantastic
attacks on it, lose all practical value and all theoretical
justifications. Therefore, although the originators of these systems
were, in many respects, revolutionary, their disciples have, in
every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast by the
original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive
historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore,
endeavour, and that consistently, to deaden the class struggle
and to reconcile the class antagonisms. They still dream of
experimental realization of their social utopias, of founding
isolated phalansteres, of establishing "Home Colonies", or setting
up a "Little Icaria"<ref target="n3.3.1">[1]</ref>&mdash;pocket editions
of the New Jerusalem -and to realise all these castles in the air,
they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the
bourgeois. By degrees, they sink into the category of the reactionary
conservative socialists depicted above, differing from these only by
more systematic pedantry, and by their fanatical and superstitious
belief in the miraculous effects of their social science.
</p><p>
   They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the
part
of the working class; such action, according to them, can only
result from blind unbelief in the new gospel.
</p><p>
   The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France,
respectively, oppose the Chartists and the formistes.

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d15">
<head>Chapter 4: Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various
Existing Opposition Parties</head>
<p>
   Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the
existing working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England
and the Agrarian Reformers in America.
</p><p>
   The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims,
for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working
class; but in the movement of the present, they also represent and
take care of the future of that movement. In France, the
Communists ally with the Social Democrats<ref target="n4.1">[1]</ref> against the
conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the
right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and
illusions traditionally handed down from the great Revolution.
</p><p>
   In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight
of
the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly
of
Democratic Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical
bourgeois.
</p><p>
   In Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian
revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation, that
party which fomented the insurrection of Krakow in 1846.
</p><p>
   In Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in
a revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal
squirearchy, and the petty-bourgeoisie.
</p><p>
   But they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the
working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile
antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the
German workers may straightway use, as so many weapons
against the bourgeoisie, the social and political conditions that
the
bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy,
and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary classes in
Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately
begin.
</p><p>
   The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany,
because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that
is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of
European civilization and with a much more developed proletariat
than that of England was in the seventeenth, and France in the
eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in
Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following
proletarian revolution.
</p><p>
   In short, the Communists everywhere support every
revolutionary movement against the existing social and political
order of things.
</p><p>
   In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading
question in each, the property question, no matter what its degree
of development at the time.
</p><p>
   Finally, they labor everywhere for the union and agreement of
the democratic parties of all countries.
</p><p>
   The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They
openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible
overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes
tremble at a communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing
to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
