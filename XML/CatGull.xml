<lb/>BY WILLA SIBERT CATHER
<lb/>THE AMBASSADOR'S STORY
</head>

<div2 type="chapter" n="1" id="d4">
<head>I</head>
<p>
IT often happens that one or another of my friends
stops before a red chalk drawing in my study and asks
me where I ever found so lovely a creature.  I have
never told the story of that picture to any one, and
the beautiful woman on the wall, until yesterday, in
all these twenty years has spoken to no one but me.
Yesterday a young painter, a countryman of mine, came
to consult me on a matter of business, and upon seeing
my drawing of Alexandra Ebbling, straightway forgot his
errand.  He examined the date upon the sketch and asked
me, very earnestly, if I could tell him whether the
lady were still living.  When I answered him, he
stepped back from the picture and said slowly:
</p><p>"So long ago?  She must have been very young.  She
was happy?"
</p><p>"As to that, who can say &mdash; about any one of us?" I
replied.  "Out of all that is supposed to make for
happiness, she had very little."
</p><p>We returned to the object of his visit, but when he
bade me goodbye at the door his troubled gaze again
went back to the drawing, and it was only by turning
sharply about that he took his eyes away from her.
</p><p>I went back to my study fire, and as the rain kept
away less impetuous visitors, I had a long time in
which to think of Mrs. Ebbling.  I even got out the
little box she gave me, which I had not opened for
years, and when Mrs. Hemway brought my tea I had barely
time to close the lid and defeat her disapproving gaze.
</p><p>My young countryman's perplexity, as he looked at
Mrs. Ebbling, had recalled to me the delight and pain
she gave me when I was of his years.  I sat looking at
her face and trying to see it through his eyes &mdash;
freshly, as I saw it first upon the deck of the
<hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>, twenty years ago.  Was it her
loveliness, I often ask myself, or her loneliness, or
her simplicity, or was it merely my own youth?  Was her
mystery only that of the mysterious North out of which
she came?  I still feel that she was very different
from all the beautiful and brilliant women I have
known; as the night is different from the day, or as
the sea is different from the land.  But this is our
story, as it comes back to me.

</p><p>For two years I had been studying Italian and
working in the capacity of clerk to the American
legation at Rome, and I was going home to secure my
first consular appointment.  Upon boarding my steamer
at Genoa, I saw my luggage into my cabin and then
started for a rapid circuit of the deck.  Everything
promised well.  The boat was thinly peopled, even for a
July crossing; the decks were roomy; the day was fine;
the sea was blue; I was sure of my appointment, and,
best of all, I was coming back to Italy.  All these
things were in my mind when I stopped sharply before a
<hi rend="italic">chaise longue</hi> placed sidewise near the stern.
Its occupant was a woman, apparently ill, who lay with
her eyes closed, and in her open arm was a chubby
little red-haired girl, asleep.  I can still remember
that first glance at Mrs. Ebbling, and how I stopped as
a wheel does when the band slips.  Her splendid,
vigorous body lay still and relaxed <pb n="146"/>  under the
loose folds of her clothing, her white throat and arms
and red-gold hair were drenched with sunlight.  Such
hair as it was: wayward as some kind of gleaming
seaweed that curls and undulates with the tide.  A
moment gave me her face; the high cheek-bones, the thin
cheeks, the gentle chin, arching back to a girlish
throat, and the singular loveliness of the mouth.  Even
then it flashed through me that the mouth gave the
whole face its peculiar beauty and distinction.  It was
proud and sad and tender, and strangely calm.  The
curve of the lips could not have been cut more cleanly
with the most delicate instrument, and whatever shade
of feeling passed over them seemed to partake of their
exquisiteness.
</p><p>But I am anticipating.  While I stood stupidly
staring (as if, at twenty-five, I had never before
beheld a beautiful woman) the whistles broke into a
hoarse scream, and the deck under us began to vibrate.
The woman opened her eyes, and the little girl
struggled into a sitting position, rolled out of her
mother's arm, and ran to the deck rail.  After putting
my chair near the stern, I went forward to see the
gang-plank up and did not return until we were dragging
out to sea at the end of a long tow-line.
</p><p>The woman in the <hi rend="italic">chaise longue</hi> was still
alone.  She lay there all day, looking at the sea.  The
little girl, Carin, played noisily about the deck.
Occasionally she returned and struggled up into the
chair, plunged her head, round and red as a little
pumpkin, against her mother's shoulder in an impetuous
embrace, and then struggled down again with a lively
flourishing of arms and legs.  Her mother took such
opportunities to pull up the child's socks or to smooth
the fiery little braids; her beautiful hands, rather
large and very white, played about the riotous little
girl with a quieting tenderness.  Carin chattered away
in Italian and kept asking for her father, only to be
told that he was busy.
</p><p>When any of the ship's officers passed, they
stopped for a word with my neighbor, and I heard the
first mate address her as Mrs. Ebbling.  When they
spoke to her, she smiled appreciatively and answered in
low, faltering Italian, but I fancied that she was glad
when they passed on and left her to her fixed
contemplation of the sea.  Her eyes seemed to drink the
color of it all day long, and after every interruption
they went back to it.  There was a kind of pleasure in
watching her satisfaction, a kind of excitement in
wondering what the water made her remember or forget.
She seemed not to wish to talk to any one, but I knew I
should like to hear whatever she might be thinking.
One could catch some hint of her thoughts, I imagined,
from the shadows that came and went across her lips,
like the reflection of light clouds.  She had a pile of
books beside her, but she did not read, and neither
could I.  I gave up trying at last, and watched the
sea, very conscious of her presence, almost of her
thoughts.  When the sun dropped low and shone in her
face, I rose and asked if she would like me to move her
chair.  She smiled and thanked me, but said the sun was
good for her.  Her yellow-hazel eyes followed me for a
moment and then went back to the sea.
</p><p>After the first bugle sounded for dinner, a heavy
man in uniform came up the deck and stood beside the
<hi rend="italic">chaise longue</hi>, looking down at its two occupants
with a smile of satisfied possession.  The breast of
his trim coat was hidden by waves of soft blond beard,
as long and heavy as a woman's hair, which blew about
his face in glittering profusion.  He wore a large
turquoise ring upon the thick hand that he rubbed good-humoredly over the little girl's head.  To her he spoke
Italian, but he and his wife conversed in some
Scandinavian tongue.  He stood stroking his fine beard
until the second bugle blew, then bent stiffly from his
hips, like a soldier, and patted his wife's hand as it
lay on the arm of her chair.  He hurried down the deck,
taking stock of the passengers as he went, and stopped
before a thin girl with frizzed hair and a lace coat,
asking her a facetious question in thick English.  They
began to talk about Chicago and went below.  Later I
saw him at the head of his table in the dining room,
the befrizzed Chicago lady on his left.  They must have
got a famous start at luncheon, for by the end of the
dinner Ebbling was peeling figs for her and presenting
them on the end of a fork.
</p><p>The Doctor confided to me that Ebbling was the
chief engineer and the dandy of the boat; but this time
he would have to behave himself, for he had brought his
sick wife along for the voyage.  She had a bad heart
valve, he added, and was in a serious way.
</p><p>After dinner Ebbling disappeared, presumably to his
engines, and at ten o'clock, when the stewardess came
to put Mrs. Ebbling to bed, I helped her to rise from
her chair, and the second mate ran up and supported her
down to her cabin.  About midnight I found the engineer
in the card room, playing with the Doctor, an Italian
naval officer, and the commodore of a Long Island yacht
club.  His face was even pinker than it had been at
dinner, and his fine beard was full of smoke.  I
thought a long while about Ebbling and his wife before
I went to sleep.
</p><p>The next morning we tied up at Naples to take on
our cargo, and I went on shore for the day.  I did not,
however, entirely escape the <pb n="147"/>  ubiquitous
engineer, whom I saw lunching with the Long Island
commodore at a hotel in the Santa Lucia.  When I
returned to the boat in the early evening, the
passengers had gone down to dinner, and I found Mrs.
Ebbling quite alone upon the deserted deck.  I
approached her and asked whether she had had a dull
day.  She looked up smiling and shook her head, as if
her Italian had quite failed her.  I saw that she was
flushed with excitement, and her yellow eyes were
shining like two clear topazes.
</p><p>"Dull?  Oh, no!  I love to watch Naples from the
sea, in this white heat.  She has just lain there on
her hillside among the vines and laughed for me all day
long.  I have been able to pick out many of the places
I like best."
</p><p>I felt that she was really going to talk to me at
last.  She had turned to me frankly, as to an old
acquaintance, and seemed not to be hiding from me
anything of what she felt.  I sat down in a glow of
pleasure and excitement and asked her if she knew
Naples well.
</p><p>"Oh, yes!  I lived there for a year after I was
first married.  My husband has a great many friends in
Naples.  But he was at sea most of the time, so I went
about alone.  Nothing helps one to know a city like
that.  I came first by sea, like this.  Directly to
Naples from Finmark, and I had never been South
before."  Mrs. Ebbling stopped and looked over my
shoulder.  Then, with a quick, eager glance at me, she
said abruptly: "It was like a baptism of fire.  Nothing
has ever been quite the same since.  Imagine how this
bay looked to a Finmark girl.  It seemed like the
overture to Italy."
</p><p>I laughed.  "And then one goes up the country&mdash;song
by song and wine by wine."
</p><p>Mrs. Ebbling sighed.  "Ah, yes.  It must be fine to
follow it.  I have never been away from the seaports
myself.  We live now in Genoa."
</p><p>The deck steward brought her tray, and I moved
forward a little and stood by the rail.  When I looked
back, she smiled and nodded to let me know that she was
not missing anything.  I could feel her intentness as
keenly as if she were standing beside me.
</p><p>The sun had disappeared over the high ridge behind
the city, and the stone pines stood black and flat
against the fires of the afterglow.  The lilac haze
that hung over the long, lazy slopes of Vesuvius warmed
with golden light, and films of blue vapor began to
float down toward Baiae.  The sky, the sea, and the
city between them turned a shimmering violet, fading
grayer as the lights began to glow like luminous pearls
along the water-front,&mdash;the necklace of an
irreclaimable queen.  Behind me I heard a low
exclamation; a slight, stifled sound, but it seemed the
perfect vocalization of that weariness with which we at
last let go of beauty, after we have held it until the
senses are darkened.  When I turned to her again, she
seemed to have fallen asleep.
</p><p>That night, as we were moving out to sea and the
tail lights of Naples were winking across the widening
stretch of black water, I helped Mrs. Ebbling to the
foot of the stairway.  She drew herself up from her
chair with effort and leaned on me wearily.  I could
have carried her all night without fatigue.
</p><p>"May I come and talk to you to-morrow?" I asked.
She did not reply at once.  "Like an old friend?" I
added.  She gave me her languid hand, and her mouth,
set with the exertion of walking, softened altogether.
<hi rend="italic">"Grazia,"</hi> she murmured.
</p><p>I returned to the deck and joined a group of my
countrywomen, who, primed with inexhaustible
information, were discussing the baseness of
Renaissance art.  They were intelligent and alert, and
as they leaned forward in their deck chairs under the
circle of light, their faces recalled to me Rembrandt's
picture of a clinical lecture.  I heard them through,
against my will, and then went to the stern to smoke
and to see the last of the island lights.  The sky had
clouded over, and a soft, melancholy wind was rushing
over the sea.  I could not help thinking how
disappointed I would be if rain should keep Mrs.
Ebbling in her cabin to-morrow.  My mind played
constantly with her image.  At one moment she was very
clear and directly in front of me; the next she was far
away.  Whatever else I thought about, some part of my
consciousness was busy with Mrs. Ebbling; hunting for
her, finding her, losing her, then groping again.  How
was it that I was so conscious of whatever she might be
feeling? that when she sat still behind me and watched
the evening sky, I had had a sense of speed and change,
almost of danger; and when she was tired and sighed, I
had wished for night and loneliness.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="2" id="d5">
<head>II</head>
<p> Though when we are young we seldom think much about
it, there is now and again a golden day when we feel a
sudden, arrogant pride in our youth; in the lightness
of our feet and the strength of our arms, in the warm
fluid that courses so surely within us; when we are
conscious of something powerful and mercurial in our
breasts, which comes up wave after wave <pb n="148"/>  and
leaves us irresponsible and free.  All the next morning
I felt this flow of life, which continually impelled me
toward Mrs. Ebbling.  After the merest greeting,
however, I kept away.  I found it pleasant to thwart
myself, to measure myself against a current that was
sure to carry me with it in the end.  I was content to
let her watch the sea&mdash;the sea that seemed now to have
come into me, warm and soft, still and strong.  I
played shuffleboard with the Commodore, who was anxious
to keep down his figure, and ran about the deck with
the stout legs of the little pumpkin-colored Carin
about my neck.  It was not until the child was having
her afternoon nap below that I at last came up and
stood beside her mother.
</p><p>"You are better to-day," I exclaimed, looking down
at her white gown.  She colored unreasonably, and I
laughed with a familiarity which she must have accepted
as the mere foolish noise of happiness, or it would
have seemed impertinent.
</p><p>We talked at first of a hundred trivial things, and
we watched the sea.  The coast of Sardinia had lain to
our port for some hours and would lie there for hours
to come, now advancing in rocky promontories, now
retreating behind blue bays.  It was the naked south
coast of the island, and though our course held very
near the shore, not a village or habitation was
visible; there was not even a goat-herd's hut hidden
away among the low pinkish sand hills.  Pinkish sand
hills and yellow head-lands; with dull-colored scrubby
bushes massed about their bases and following the dried
water-courses.  A narrow strip of beach glistened like
white paint between the purple sea and the umber rocks,
and the whole island lay gleaming in the yellow
sunshine and translucent air.  Not a wave broke on that
fringe of white sand, not the shadow of a cloud played
across the bare hills.  In the air about us, there was
no sound but that of a vessel moving rapidly through
absolutely still water.  She seemed like some great
sea-animal, swimming silently, her head well up.  The
sea before us was so rich and heavy and opaque that it
might have been lapis lazuli.  It was the blue of
legend, simply; the color that satisfies the soul like
sleep.
</p><p>And it was of the sea we talked, for it was the
substance of Mrs. Ebbling's story.  She seemed always
to have been swept along by ocean streams, warm or
cold, and to have hovered about the edge of great
waters.  She was born and had grown up in a little
fishing town on the Arctic ocean.  Her father was a
doctor, a widower, who lived with his daughter and who
divided his time between his books and his fishing rod.
Her uncle was skipper on a coasting vessel, and with
him she had made many trips along the Norwegian coast.
But she was always reading and thinking about the blue
seas of the South.
</p><p>"There was a curious old woman in our village, Dame
Ericson, who had been in Italy in her youth.  She had
gone to Rome to study art, and had copied a great many
pictures there.  She was well connected, but had little
money, and as she grew older and poorer she sold her
pictures one by one, until there was scarcely a well-to-do family in our district that did not own one of
Dame Ericson's paintings.  But she brought home many
other strange things; a little orange-tree which she
cherished until the day of her death, and bits of
colored marble, and sea shells and pieces of coral, and
a thin flask full of water from the Mediterranean.
When I was a little girl she used to show me her things
and tell me about the South; about the coral fishers,
and the pink islands, and the smoking mountains, and
the old, underground Naples.  I suppose the water in
her flask was like any other, but it never seemed so to
me.  It looked so elastic and alive, that I used to
think if one unsealed the bottle something penetrating
and fruitful might leap out and work an enchantment
over Finmark."
</p><p>Lars Ebbling, I learned, was one of her father's
friends.  She could remember him from the time when she
was a little girl and he a dashing young man who used
to come home from the sea and make a stir in the
village.  After he got his promotion to an Atlantic
liner and went South, she did not see him until the
summer she was twenty, when he came home to marry her.
That was five years ago.  The little girl, Carin, was
three.  From her talk, one might have supposed that
Ebbling was proprietor of the Mediterranean and its
adjacent lands, and could have kept her away at his
pleasure.  Her own rights in him she seemed not to
consider.
</p><p>But we wasted very little time on Lars Ebbling.  We
talked, like two very young persons, of arms and men,
of the sea beneath us and the shores it washed.  We
were carried a little beyond ourselves, for we were in
the presence of the things of youth that never change;
fleeing past them.  To-morrow they would be gone, and
no effort of will or memory could bring them back
again.  All about us was the sea of great adventure,
and below us, caught somewhere in its gleaming meshes,
were the bones of nations and navies . . . . . nations
and navies that gave youth its hope and made life
something more than a hunger of the bowels.  The
unpeopled Sardinian coast unfolded gently before us,
like something left <pb n="149"/>  over out of a world that
was gone; a place that might well have had no later
news since the corn ships brought the tidings of
Actium.
</p><p>"I shall never go to Sardinia," said Mrs. Ebbling.
"It could not possibly be as beautiful as this."
</p><p>"Neither shall I," I replied.
</p><p>As I was going down to dinner that evening, I was
stopped by Lars Ebbling, freshly brushed and scented,
wearing a white uniform, and polished and glistening as
one of his own engines.  He smiled at me with his own
kind of geniality.  "You have been very kind to talk to
my wife," he explained.  "It is very bad for her this
trip that she speaks no English.  I am indebted to
you."
</p><p>I told him curtly that he was mistaken, but my
acrimony made no impression upon his blandness.  I felt
that I should certainly strike the fellow if he stood
there much longer, running his blue ring up and down
his beard.  I should probably have hated any man who
was Mrs. Ebbling's husband, but Ebbling made me sick.
</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d6">
<head>III</head>
<p>
The next day I began my drawing of Mrs. Ebbling.
She seemed pleased and a little puzzled when I asked
her to sit for me.  It occurred to me that she had
always been among dull people who took her looks as a
matter of course, and that she was not at all sure that
she was really beautiful.  I can see now her quick,
confused look of pleasure.  I thought very little about
the drawing then, except that the making of it gave me
an opportunity to study her face; to look as long as I
pleased into her yellow eyes, at the noble lines of her
mouth, at her splendid, vigorous hair.
</p><p>"We have a yellow vine at home," I told her, "that
is very like your hair.  It seems to be growing while
one looks at it, and it twines and tangles about itself
and throws out little tendrils in the wind."
</p><p>"Has it any name?"
</p><p>"We call it love vine."
</p><p>How little a thing could disconcert her!
</p><p>As for me, nothing disconcerted me.  I awoke every
morning with a sense of speed and joy.  At night I
loved to hear the swish of the water rushing by.  As
fast as the pistons could carry us, as fast as the
water could bear us, we were going forward to something
delightful; to something together.  When Mrs. Ebbling
told me that she and her husband would be five days in
the docks in New York and then return to Genoa, I was
not disturbed, for I did not believe her.  I came and
went, and she sat still all day, watching the water.  I
heard an American lady say that she watched it like one
who is going to die, but even that did not frighten me:
I somehow felt that she had promised me to live.
</p><p>All those long blue days when I sat beside her
talking about Finmark and the sea, she must have known
that I loved her.  I sat with my hands idle on my knees
and let the tide come up in me.  It carried me so
swiftly that, across the narrow space of deck between
us, it must have swayed her, too, a little.  I had no
wish to disturb or distress her.  If a little, a very
little of it reached her, I was satisfied.  If it drew
her softly, but drew her, I wanted no more.  Sometimes
I could see that even the light pressure of my thoughts
made her paler.  One still evening, after a long talk,
she whispered to me, "You must go and walk now, and&mdash;don't
think about me."  She had been held too long and
too closely in my thoughts, and she begged me to
release her for a little while.  I went out into the
bow and put her far away, at the sky line, with the
faintest star, and thought of her gently across the
water.  When I went back to her, she was asleep.
</p><p>But even in those first days I had my hours of
misery.  Why, for instance, should she have been born
in Finmark, and why should Lars Ebbling have been her
only door of escape?  Why should she be silently taking
leave of the world at the age when I was just beginning
it, having had nothing, nothing of whatever is worth
while?
</p><p>She never talked about taking leave of things, and
yet I sometimes felt that she was counting the sunsets.
One yellow afternoon, when we were gliding between the
shores of Spain and Africa, she spoke of her illness
for the first time.  I had got some magnolias at
Gibraltar, and she wore a bunch of them in her girdle
and the rest lay on her lap.  She held the cool leaves
against her cheek and fingered the white petals.  "I
can never," she remarked, "get enough of the flowers of
the South.  They make me breathless, just as they did
at first.  Because of them I should like to live a long
while&mdash;almost forever."
</p><p>I leaned forward and looked at her.  "We could live
almost forever if we had enough courage.  It's of our
lives that we die.  If we had the courage to change it
all, to run away to some blue coast like that over
there, we could live on and on, until we were tired."
</p><p>She smiled tolerantly and looked southward through
half shut eyes.  "I am afraid I should never have
courage enough to go behind that mountain, at least.
Look at it, it looks as if it hid horrible things."
</p><p>A sea mist, blown in from the Atlantic, began
<pb n="150"/>
to mask the impassive African coast, and above the
fog, the grey mountain peak took on the angry red of
the sunset.  It burned sullen and threatening until the
dark land drew the night about her and settled back
into the sea.  We watched it sink, while under us,
slowly but ever increasing, we felt the throb of the
Atlantic come and go, the thrill of the vast, untamed
waters of that lugubrious and passionate sea.  I drew
Mrs. Ebbling's wraps about her and shut the magnolias
under her cloak.  When I left her, she slipped me one
warm, white flower.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="d7">
<head>IV</head>

<p>From the Straits of Gibraltar we dropped into the
abyss, and by morning we were rolling in the trough of
a sea that drew us down and held us deep, shaking us
gently back and forth until the timbers creaked, and
then shooting us out on the crest of a swelling
mountain.  The water was bright and blue, but so cold
that the breath of it penetrated one's bones, as if the
chill of the deep under-fathoms of the sea were being
loosed upon us.  There were not more than a dozen
people upon the deck that morning, and Mrs. Ebbling was
sheltered behind the stern, muffled in a sea jacket,
with drops of moisture upon her long lashes and on her
hair.  When a shower of icy spray beat back over the
deck rail, she took it gleefully.
</p><p>"After all," she insisted, "this is my own kind of
water; the kind I was born in.  This is first cousin to
the Pole waters, and the sea we have left is only a
kind of fairy tale.  It's like the burnt out volcanoes;
its day is over.  This is the real sea now, where the
doings of the world go on."
</p><p>"It is not our reality, at any rate," I answered.
</p><p>"Oh, yes, it is!  These are the waters that carry
men to their work, and they will carry you to yours."
</p><p>I sat down and watched her hair grow more alive and
iridescent in the moisture.  "You are pleased to take
an attitude," I complained.
</p><p>"No, I don't love realities any more than another,
but I admit them, all the same."
</p><p>"And who are you and I to define the realities?"
</p><p>"Our minds define them clearly enough, yours and
mine, everybody's.  Those are the lines we never cross,
though we flee from the equator to the Pole.  I have
never really got out of Finmark, of course.  I shall
live and die in a fishing town on the Arctic ocean, and
the blue seas and the pink islands are as much a dream
as they ever were.  All the same, I shall continue to
dream them."
</p><p>The Gulf Stream gave us warm blue days again, but
pale, like sad memories.  The water had faded, and the
thin, tepid sunshine made something tighten about one's
heart.  The stars watched us coldly, and seemed always
to be asking me what I was going to do.  The advancing
line on the chart, which at first had been mere
foolishness, began to mean something, and the wind from
the west brought disturbing fears and forebodings.  I
slept lightly, and all day I was restless and uncertain
except when I was with Mrs. Ebbling.  She quieted me as
she did little Carin, and soothed me without saying
anything, as she had done that evening at Naples when
we watched the sunset.  It seemed to me that every day
her eyes grew more tender and her lips more calm.  A
kind of fortitude seemed to be gathering about her
mouth, and I dreaded it.  Yet when, in an involuntary
glance, I put to her the question that tortured me, her
eyes always met mine steadily, deep and gentle and full
of reassurance.  That I had my word at last, happened
almost by accident.
</p><p>On the second night out from shore there was the
concert for the Sailors' Orphanage, and Mrs. Ebbling
dressed and went down to dinner for the first time, and
sat on her husband's right.  I was not the only one who
was glad to see her.  Even the women were pleased.  She
wore a pale green gown, and she came up out of it
regally white and gold.  I was so proud that I blushed
when any one spoke of her.  After dinner she was
standing by her deck-chair talking to her husband when
people began to go below for the concert.  She took up
a long cloak and attempted to put it on.  The wind blew
the light thing about, and Ebbling chatted and smiled
his public smile while she struggled with it.  Suddenly
his roving eye caught sight of the Chicago girl, who
was having a similar difficulty with her draperies, and
he pranced half the length of the deck to assist her.
I had been watching from the rail, and when she was
left alone I threw my cigar away and wrapped Mrs.
Ebbling up roughly.
</p><p>"Don't go down," I begged.  "Stay up here.  I want
to talk to you."
</p><p>She hesitated a moment and looked at me
thoughtfully.  Then, with a sigh, she sat down.  Every
one hurried down to the saloon, and we were absolutely
alone at last, behind the shelter of the stern, with
the thick darkness all about us and a warm east wind
rushing over the sea.  I was too sore and angry to
think.  I leaned toward her, holding the arm of her
chair with both hands, and began anywhere.
</p><p>"You remember those two blue coasts out of
Gibraltar?  It shall be either one you choose, <pb n="151"/>
if you will come with me.  I have not much money, but
we shall get on somehow.  There has got to be an end of
this.  We are neither one of us cowards, and this is
humiliating, intolerable."
</p><p>She sat looking down at her hands, and I pulled her
chair impatiently toward me.
</p><p>"I felt," she said at last, "that you were going to
say something like this.  You are sorry for me, and I
don't wish to be pitied.  You think Ebbling neglects
me, but you are mistaken.  He has had his
disappointments, too.  He wants children and a gay,
hospitable house, and he is tied to a sick woman who
can not get on with people.  He has more to complain of
than I have, and yet he bears with me.  I am grateful
to him, and there is no more to be said."
</p><p>"Oh, isn't there?" I cried, "and I?"
</p><p>She laid her hand entreatingly upon my arm.  "Ah,
you! you!  Don't ask me to talk about that.
<hi rend="italic">You</hi>&mdash;"  Her fingers slipped down my coat sleeve
to my hand and pressed it.  I caught her two hands and
held them, telling her I would never let them go.
</p><p>"And you meant to leave me day after tomorrow, to
say goodbye to me as you will to the other people on
this boat?  You meant to cut me adrift like this, with
my heart on fire and all my life unspent in me?"
</p><p>She sighed despondently.  "I am willing to suffer&mdash;
whatever I must suffer&mdash;to have had you," she answered
simply.  "I was ill&mdash;and so lonely&mdash;and it came so
quickly and quietly.  Ah, don't begrudge it to me!  Do
not leave me in bitterness.  If I have been wrong,
forgive me."  She bowed her head and pressed my fingers
entreatingly.  A warm tear splashed on my hand.  It
occurred to me that she bore my anger as she bore
little Carin's importunities, as she bore Ebbling.
What a circle of pettiness she had about her!  I fell
back in my chair and my hands dropped at my side.  I
felt like a creature with its back broken.  I asked her
what she wished me to do.
</p><p>"Don't ask me," she whispered.  "There is nothing
that we can do.  I thought you knew that.  You forget
that&mdash;that I am too ill to begin my life over.  Even if
there were nothing else in the way, that would be
enough.  And that is what has made it all possible, our
loving each other, I mean.  If I were well, we couldn't
have had even this much.  Don't reproach me.  Hasn't it
been at all pleasant to you to find me waiting for you
every morning, to feel me thinking of you when you went
to sleep?  Every night I have watched the sea for you,
as if it were mine and I had made it, and I have
listened to the water rushing by you, full of sleep and
youth and hope.  And everything you had done or said
during the day came back to me, and when I went to
sleep it was only to feel you more.  You see there was
never any one else; I have never thought of any one in
the dark but you."  She spoke pleadingly, and her voice
had sunk so low that I could scarcely hear her.
</p><p>"And yet you will do nothing," I groaned.  "You
will dare nothing.  You will give me nothing."
</p><p>"Don't say that.  When I leave you day after
tomorrow, I shall have given you all my life.  I can't
tell you how, but it is true.  There is something in
each of us that does not belong to the family or to
society, not even to ourselves.  Sometimes it is given
in marriage, and sometimes it is given in love, but
oftener it is never given at all.  We have nothing to
do with giving or withholding it.  It is a wild thing
that sings in us once and flies away and never comes
back, and mine has flown to you.  When one loves like
that, it is enough, somehow.  The other things can go
if they must.  That is why I can live without you, and
die without you."
</p><p>I caught her hands and looked into her eyes that
shone warm in the darkness.  She shivered and whispered
in a tone so different from any I ever heard from her
before or afterward: "Do you grudge it to me?  You are
so young and strong, and you have everything before
you.  I shall have only a little while to want you in&mdash;
and I could want you forever and not weary."  I kissed
her hair, her cheeks, her lips, until her head fell
forward on my shoulder and she put my face away with
her soft, trembling fingers.  She took my hand and held
it close to her, in both her own.  We sat silent, and
the moments came and went, bringing us closer and
closer, and the wind and water rushed by us,
obliterating our tomorrows and all our yesterdays.
</p><p>The next day Mrs. Ebbling kept her cabin, and I sat
stupidly by her chair until dark, with the rugged
little girl to keep me company, and an occasional nod
from the engineer.
</p><p>I saw Mrs. Ebbling again only for a few moments,
when we were coming into the New York harbor.  She wore
a street dress and a hat, and these alone would have
made her seem far away from me.  She was very pale, and
looked down when she spoke to me, as if she had been
guilty of a wrong toward me.  I have never been able to
remember that interview without heartache and shame,
but then I was too desperate to care about anything.  I
stood like a wooden post and let her approach me, let
her speak to me, let her leave <pb n="152"/>  me.  She came up
to me as if it were a hard thing to do, and held out a
little package, timidly, and her gloved hand shook as
if she were afraid of me.
</p><p>"I want to give you something," she said.  "You
will not want it now, so I shall ask you to keep it
until you hear from me.  You gave me your address a
long time ago, when you were making that drawing.  Some
day I shall write to you and ask you to open this.  You
must not come to tell me goodbye this morning, but I
shall be watching you when you go ashore.  Please don't
forget that."
</p><p>I took the little box mechanically and thanked her.
I think my eyes must have filled, for she uttered an
exclamation of pity, touched my sleeve quickly, and
left me.  It was one of those strange, low, musical
exclamations which meant everything and nothing, like
the one that had thrilled me that night at Naples, and
it was the last sound I ever heard from her lips.
</p><p>An hour later I went on shore, one of those who
crowded over the gang-plank the moment it was lowered.
But the next afternoon I wandered back to the docks and
went on board the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi>.  I asked for the
engineer, and he came up in his shirt sleeves from the
engine room.  He was red and dishevelled, angry and
voluble; his bright eye had a hard glint, and I did not
once see his masterful smile.  When he heard my inquiry
he became profane.  Mrs. Ebbling had sailed for Bremen
on the <hi rend="italic">Hobenstauffen</hi> that morning at eleven
o'clock.  She had decided to return by the northern
route and pay a visit to her father in Finmark.  She
was in no condition to travel alone, he said.  He
evidently smarted under her extravagance.  But who, he
asked, with a blow of his fist on the rail, could stand
between a woman and her whim?  She had always been a
wilful girl, and she had a doting father behind her.
When she set her head with the wind, there was no
holding her; she ought to have married the Arctic
Ocean.  I think Ebbling was still talking when I walked
away.
</p><p>I spent that winter in New York.  My consular
appointment hung fire (indeed, I did not pursue it with
much enthusiasm), and I had a good many idle hours in
which to think of Mrs. Ebbling.  She had never
mentioned the name of her father's village, and somehow
I could never quite bring myself to go to the docks
when Ebbling's boat was in and ask for news of her.
More than once I made up my mind definitely to go to
Finmark and take my chance at finding her; the shipping
people would know where Ebbling came from.  But I never
went.  I have often wondered why.  When my resolve was
made and my courage high, when I could almost feel
myself approaching her, suddenly everything crumbled
under me, and I fell back as I had done that night when
I dropped her hands, after telling her, only a moment
before, that I would never let them go.
</p><p>In the twilight of a wet March day, when the
gutters were running black outside and the Square was
liquefying under crusts of dirty snow, the housekeeper
brought me a damp letter which bore a blurred foreign
postmark.  It was from Niels Nannestad, who wrote that
it was his sad duty to inform me that his daughter,
Alexandra Ebbling, had died on the second day of
February, in the twenty-sixth year of her age.
Complying with her request, he inclosed a letter which
she had written some days before her death.
</p><p>I at last brought myself to break the seal of the
second letter.  It read thus:</p>

<q><text id="d8"><body>
<div1 type="letter" id="d9">

<opener><salute>"My Friend:&mdash; </salute></opener>
<p>You may open now the little package I
gave you.  May I ask you to keep it?  I gave it to you
because there is no one else who would care about it in
just that way.  Ever since I left you I have been
thinking what it would be like to live a lifetime
caring and being cared for like that.  It was not the
life I was meant to live, and yet, in a way, I have
been living it ever since I first knew you.</p>
    <p>"Of course you understand now why I could not go
with you.  I would have spoiled your life for you.
Besides that, I was ill&mdash;and I was too proud to give
you the shadow of myself.  I had much to give you, if
you had come earlier.  As it was, I was ashamed.
Vanity sometimes saves us when nothing else will, and
mine saved you.  Thank you for everything.  I hold this
to my heart, where I once held your hand.</p>
<closer><signed>Alexandra."</signed> </closer>
</div1></body></text></q>

<p>The dusk had thickened into night long before I got
up from my chair and took the little box from its place
in my desk drawer.  I opened it and lifted out a thick
coil, cut from where her hair grew thickest and
brightest.  It was tied firmly at one end, and when it
fell over my arm it curled and clung about my sleeve
like a living thing set free.  How it gleamed, how it
still gleams in the firelight!  It was warm and softly
scented under my lips, and stirred under my breath like
seaweed in the tide.  This, and a withered magnolia
flower, and two pink sea shells; nothing more.  And it
was all twenty years ago!</p>
