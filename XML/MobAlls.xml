<p><stage>Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,	and LAFEU, all in black</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death<lb/>
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to<lb/>
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,<lb/>
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times<lb/>
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose<lb/>
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather<lb/>
than lack it where there is such abundance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose<lb/>
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and<lb/>
finds no other advantage in the process but only the<lb/>
losing of hope by time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>This young gentlewoman had a father,&mdash;O, that<lb/>
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!&mdash;whose skill was<lb/>
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so<lb/>
far, would have made nature immortal, and death<lb/>
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the<lb/>
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be<lb/>
the death of the king's disease.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>How called you the man you speak of, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was<lb/>
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very<lb/>
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he<lb/>
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge<lb/>
could be set up against mortality.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>A fistula, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I heard not of it before.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman<lb/>
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my<lb/>
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that<lb/>
her education promises; her dispositions she<lb/>
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where<lb/>
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there<lb/>
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and<lb/>
traitors too; in her they are the better for their<lb/>
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise<lb/>
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches<lb/>
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all<lb/>
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;<lb/>
go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect<lb/>
a sorrow than have it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,<lb/>
excessive grief the enemy to the living.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess<lb/>
makes it soon mortal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Madam, I desire your holy wishes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>How understand we that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father<lb/>
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue<lb/>
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness<lb/>
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,<lb/>
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy<lb/>
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend<lb/>
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,<lb/>
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,<lb/>
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,<lb/>
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;<lb/>
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,<lb/>
Advise him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>He cannot want the best<lb/>
That shall attend his love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p><stage>[To HELENA]</stage></p><p>  The best wishes that can be forged in<lb/>
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable<lb/>
to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of<lb/>
your father.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O, were that all! I think not on my father;<lb/>
And these great tears grace his remembrance more<lb/>
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?<lb/>
I have forgot him: my imagination<lb/>
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.<lb/>
I am undone: there is no living, none,<lb/>
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one<lb/>
That I should love a bright particular star<lb/>
And think to wed it, he is so above me:<lb/>
In his bright radiance and collateral light<lb/>
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.<lb/>
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:<lb/>
The hind that would be mated by the lion<lb/>
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,<lb/>
To see him every hour; to sit and draw<lb/>
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<lb/>
In our heart's table; heart too capable<lb/>
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<lb/>
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy<lb/>
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAROLLES</stage>



</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;<lb/>
And yet I know him a notorious liar,<lb/>
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<lb/>
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,<lb/>
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones<lb/>
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see<lb/>
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Save you, fair queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>And you, monarch!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>And no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Are you meditating on virginity?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me<lb/>
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how<lb/>
may we barricado it against him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Keep him out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,<lb/>
in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some<lb/>
warlike resistance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>There is none: man, sitting down before you, will<lb/>
undermine you and blow you up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Bless our poor virginity from underminers and<lb/>
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how<lb/>
virgins might blow up men?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be<lb/>
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with<lb/>
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It<lb/>
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to<lb/>
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational<lb/>
increase and there was never virgin got till<lb/>
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is<lb/>
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost<lb/>
may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is<lb/>
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the<lb/>
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,<lb/>
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible<lb/>
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:<lb/>
virginity murders itself and should be buried in<lb/>
highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate<lb/>
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,<lb/>
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very<lb/>
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.<lb/>
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of<lb/>
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the<lb/>
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose<lb/>
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make<lb/>
itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the<lb/>
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it<lb/>
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with<lb/>
lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't<lb/>
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.<lb/>
Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out<lb/>
of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just<lb/>
like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not<lb/>
now. Your date is better in your pie and your<lb/>
porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,<lb/>
your old virginity, is like one of our French<lb/>
withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,<lb/>
'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;<lb/>
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Not my virginity yet . . . . .<lb/>
There shall your master have a thousand loves,<lb/>
A mother and a mistress and a friend,<lb/>
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,<lb/>
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,<lb/>
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;<lb/>
His humble ambition, proud humility,<lb/>
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,<lb/>
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world<lb/>
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,<lb/>
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he&mdash;<lb/>
I know not what he shall. God send him well!<lb/>
The court's a learning place, and he is one&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>What one, i' faith?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>That I wish well. 'Tis pity&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>What's pity?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>That wishing well had not a body in't,<lb/>
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,<lb/>
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,<lb/>
Might with effects of them follow our friends,<lb/>
And show what we alone must think, which never<lb/>
Return us thanks.<lb/>

<p>Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I<lb/>
will think of thee at court.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Under Mars, I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I especially think, under Mars.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why under Mars?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The wars have so kept you under that you must needs<lb/>
be born under Mars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>When he was predominant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>When he was retrograde, I think, rather.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why think you so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You go so much backward when you fight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>That's for advantage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;<lb/>
but the composition that your valour and fear makes<lb/>
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee<lb/>
acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the<lb/>
which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize<lb/>
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's<lb/>
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon<lb/>
thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and<lb/>
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When<lb/>
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast<lb/>
none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,<lb/>
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,<lb/>
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky<lb/>
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull<lb/>
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.<lb/>
What power is it which mounts my love so high,<lb/>
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?<lb/>
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings<lb/>
To join like likes and kiss like native things.<lb/>
Impossible be strange attempts to those<lb/>
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose<lb/>
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove<lb/>
So show her merit, that did miss her love?<lb/>
The king's disease&mdash;my project may deceive me,<lb/>
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Paris. The KING's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France,	with letters, and divers Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;<lb/>
Have fought with equal fortune and continue<lb/>
A braving war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>So 'tis reported, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it<lb/>
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,<lb/>
With caution that the Florentine will move us<lb/>
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend<lb/>
Prejudicates the business and would seem<lb/>
To have us make denial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>His love and wisdom,<lb/>
Approved so to your majesty, may plead<lb/>
For amplest credence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>He hath arm'd our answer,<lb/>
And Florence is denied before he comes:<lb/>
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see<lb/>
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave<lb/>
To stand on either part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>It well may serve<lb/>
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick<lb/>
For breathing and exploit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>What's he comes here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,<lb/>
Young Bertram.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;<lb/>
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,<lb/>
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts<lb/>
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My thanks and duty are your majesty's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I would I had that corporal soundness now,<lb/>
As when thy father and myself in friendship<lb/>
First tried our soldiership! He did look far<lb/>
Into the service of the time and was<lb/>
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;<lb/>
But on us both did haggish age steal on<lb/>
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me<lb/>
To talk of your good father. In his youth<lb/>
He had the wit which I can well observe<lb/>
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest<lb/>
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted<lb/>
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;<lb/>
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness<lb/>
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,<lb/>
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,<lb/>
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<lb/>
Exception bid him speak, and at this time<lb/>
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him<lb/>
He used as creatures of another place<lb/>
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,<lb/>
Making them proud of his humility,<lb/>
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man<lb/>
Might be a copy to these younger times;<lb/>
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now<lb/>
But goers backward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>His good remembrance, sir,<lb/>
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;<lb/>
So in approof lives not his epitaph<lb/>
As in your royal speech.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Would I were with him! He would always say&mdash;<lb/>
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words<lb/>
He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,<lb/>
To grow there and to bear,&mdash;'Let me not live,'&mdash;<lb/>
This his good melancholy oft began,<lb/>
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,<lb/>
When it was out,&mdash;'Let me not live,' quoth he,<lb/>
'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff<lb/>
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses<lb/>
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are<lb/>
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies<lb/>
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;<lb/>
I after him do after him wish too,<lb/>
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,<lb/>
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,<lb/>
To give some labourers room.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>You are loved, sir:<lb/>
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Steward</speaker>
<p>Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I<lb/>
wish might be found in the calendar of my past<lb/>
endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make<lb/>
foul the clearness of our deservings, when of<lb/>
ourselves we publish them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:<lb/>
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all<lb/>
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know<lb/>
you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability<lb/>
enough to make such knaveries yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Well, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though<lb/>
many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have<lb/>
your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel<lb/>
the woman and I will do as we may.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou needs be a beggar?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I do beg your good will in this case.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>In what case?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no<lb/>
heritage: and I think I shall never have the<lb/>
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for<lb/>
they say barnes are blessings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on<lb/>
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Is this all your worship's reason?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they<lb/>
are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>May the world know them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and<lb/>
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry<lb/>
that I may repent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have<lb/>
friends for my wife's sake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Such friends are thine enemies, knave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the<lb/>
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.<lb/>
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me<lb/>
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my<lb/>
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher<lb/>
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh<lb/>
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my<lb/>
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses<lb/>
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to<lb/>
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;<lb/>
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the<lb/>
Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in<lb/>
religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl<lb/>
horns together, like any deer i' the herd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next<lb/>
way:<lb/>
For I the ballad will repeat,<lb/>
Which men full true shall find;<lb/>
Your marriage comes by destiny,<lb/>
Your cuckoo sings by kind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Steward</speaker>
<p>May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to<lb/>
you: of her I am to speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;<lb/>
Helen, I mean.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,<lb/>
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?<lb/>
Fond done, done fond,<lb/>
Was this King Priam's joy?<lb/>
With that she sighed as she stood,<lb/>
With that she sighed as she stood,<lb/>
And gave this sentence then;<lb/>
Among nine bad if one be good,<lb/>
Among nine bad if one be good,<lb/>
There's yet one good in ten.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying<lb/>
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all<lb/>
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,<lb/>
if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we<lb/>
might have a good woman born but one every blazing<lb/>
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery<lb/>
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck<lb/>
one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>That man should be at woman's command, and yet no<lb/>
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it<lb/>
will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of<lb/>
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am<lb/>
going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Well, now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Steward</speaker>
<p>I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and<lb/>
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully<lb/>
make title to as much love as she finds: there is<lb/>
more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid<lb/>
her than she'll demand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Steward</speaker>
<p>Madam, I was very late more near her than I think<lb/>
she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate<lb/>
to herself her own words to her own ears; she<lb/>
thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any<lb/>
stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:<lb/>
Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put<lb/>
such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no<lb/>
god, that would not extend his might, only where<lb/>
qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that<lb/>
would suffer her poor knight surprised, without<lb/>
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.<lb/>
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of<lb/>
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I<lb/>
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;<lb/>
sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns<lb/>
you something to know it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>You have discharged this honestly; keep it to<lb/>
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this<lb/>
before, which hung so tottering in the balance that<lb/>
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,<lb/>
leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you<lb/>
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Steward</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter HELENA</stage></p>


<p>
Even so it was with me when I was young:<lb/>
If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn<lb/>
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;<lb/>
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;<lb/>
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,<lb/>
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:<lb/>
By our remembrances of days foregone,<lb/>
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.<lb/>
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>What is your pleasure, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>You know, Helen,<lb/>
I am a mother to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Mine honourable mistress.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Nay, a mother:<lb/>
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'<lb/>
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'<lb/>
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;<lb/>
And put you in the catalogue of those<lb/>
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen<lb/>
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds<lb/>
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:<lb/>
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,<lb/>
Yet I express to you a mother's care:<lb/>
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood<lb/>
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,<lb/>
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,<lb/>
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?<lb/>
Why? that you are my daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>That I am not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>I say, I am your mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Pardon, madam;<lb/>
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:<lb/>
I am from humble, he from honour'd name;<lb/>
No note upon my parents, his all noble:<lb/>
My master, my dear lord he is; and I<lb/>
His servant live, and will his vassal die:<lb/>
He must not be my brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Nor I your mother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You are my mother, madam; would you were,&mdash;<lb/>
So that my lord your son were not my brother,&mdash;<lb/>
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,<lb/>
I care no more for than I do for heaven,<lb/>
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,<lb/>
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:<lb/>
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother<lb/>
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?<lb/>
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see<lb/>
The mystery of your loneliness, and find<lb/>
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross<lb/>
You love my son; invention is ashamed,<lb/>
Against the proclamation of thy passion,<lb/>
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;<lb/>
But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks<lb/>
Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes<lb/>
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors<lb/>
That in their kind they speak it: only sin<lb/>
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,<lb/>
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?<lb/>
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;<lb/>
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,<lb/>
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,<lb/>
Tell me truly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Good madam, pardon me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Do you love my son?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Your pardon, noble mistress!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Love you my son?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Do not you love him, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,<lb/>
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose<lb/>
The state of your affection; for your passions<lb/>
Have to the full appeach'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Then, I confess,<lb/>
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,<lb/>
That before you, and next unto high heaven,<lb/>
I love your son.<lb/>
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:<lb/>
Be not offended; for it hurts not him<lb/>
That he is loved of me: I follow him not<lb/>
By any token of presumptuous suit;<lb/>
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;<lb/>
Yet never know how that desert should be.<lb/>
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;<lb/>
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve<lb/>
I still pour in the waters of my love<lb/>
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,<lb/>
Religious in mine error, I adore<lb/>
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,<lb/>
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,<lb/>
Let not your hate encounter with my love<lb/>
For loving where you do: but if yourself,<lb/>
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,<lb/>
Did ever in so true a flame of liking<lb/>
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian<lb/>
Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity<lb/>
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose<lb/>
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;<lb/>
That seeks not to find that her search implies,<lb/>
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Had you not lately an intent,&mdash;speak truly,&mdash;<lb/>
To go to Paris?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Madam, I had.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Wherefore? tell true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.<lb/>
You know my father left me some prescriptions<lb/>
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading<lb/>
And manifest experience had collected<lb/>
For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me<lb/>
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,<lb/>
As notes whose faculties inclusive were<lb/>
More than they were in note: amongst the rest,<lb/>
There is a remedy, approved, set down,<lb/>
To cure the desperate languishings whereof<lb/>
The king is render'd lost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>This was your motive<lb/>
For Paris, was it? speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>My lord your son made me to think of this;<lb/>
Else Paris and the medicine and the king<lb/>
Had from the conversation of my thoughts<lb/>
Haply been absent then.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>But think you, Helen,<lb/>
If you should tender your supposed aid,<lb/>
He would receive it? he and his physicians<lb/>
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,<lb/>
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit<lb/>
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,<lb/>
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off<lb/>
The danger to itself?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>There's something in't,<lb/>
More than my father's skill, which was the greatest<lb/>
Of his profession, that his good receipt<lb/>
Shall for my legacy be sanctified<lb/>
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour<lb/>
But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture<lb/>
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure<lb/>
By such a day and hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Dost thou believe't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam, knowingly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,<lb/>
Means and attendants and my loving greetings<lb/>
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home<lb/>
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:<lb/>
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,<lb/>
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles<lb/>
Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:<lb/>
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all<lb/>
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,<lb/>

<p>'Tis our hope, sir,<lb/>
After well enter'd soldiers, to return<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart<lb/>

Whether I live or die, be you the sons<lb/>
Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,&mdash;<lb/>

<p>Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:<lb/>

<p>I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,<lb/>

move under the influence of the most received star;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p><stage>[Kneeling]</stage></p><p>  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I'll fee thee to stand up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.<lb/>
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,<lb/>
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,<lb/>
And ask'd thee mercy for't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;<lb/>
Will you be cured of your infirmity?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?<lb/>
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if<lb/>
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine<lb/>
That's able to breathe life into a stone,<lb/>
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary<lb/>
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,<lb/>
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,<lb/>
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,<lb/>
And write to her a love-line.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>What 'her' is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,<lb/>
If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,<lb/>
If seriously I may convey my thoughts<lb/>
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke<lb/>
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,<lb/>
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more<lb/>
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her<lb/>
For that is her demand, and know her business?<lb/>
That done, laugh well at me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Now, good Lafeu,<lb/>
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee<lb/>
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine<lb/>
By wondering how thou took'st it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll fit you,<lb/>
And not be all day neither.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Nay, come your ways.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>This haste hath wings indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Nay, come your ways:<lb/>
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:<lb/>
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors<lb/>
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,<lb/>
That dare leave two together; fare you well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Now, fair one, does your business follow us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>
Gerard de Narbon was my father;<lb/>
In what he did profess, well found.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I knew him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The rather will I spare my praises towards him:<lb/>
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death<lb/>
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.<lb/>
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,<lb/>
And of his old experience the oily darling,<lb/>
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,<lb/>
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;<lb/>
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd<lb/>
With that malignant cause wherein the honour<lb/>
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,<lb/>
I come to tender it and my appliance<lb/>
With all bound humbleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>We thank you, maiden;<lb/>
But may not be so credulous of cure,<lb/>
When our most learned doctors leave us and<lb/>
The congregated college have concluded<lb/>
That labouring art can never ransom nature<lb/>
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not<lb/>
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,<lb/>
To prostitute our past-cure malady<lb/>
To empirics, or to dissever so<lb/>
Our great self and our credit, to esteem<lb/>
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>My duty then shall pay me for my pains:<lb/>
I will no more enforce mine office on you.<lb/>
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts<lb/>
A modest one, to bear me back a again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:<lb/>
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give<lb/>
As one near death to those that wish him live:<lb/>
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,<lb/>
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>What I can do can do no hurt to try,<lb/>
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.<lb/>
He that of greatest works is finisher<lb/>
Oft does them by the weakest minister:<lb/>
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,<lb/>
When judges have been babes; great floods have flown<lb/>
From simple sources, and great seas have dried<lb/>
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.<lb/>
Oft expectation fails and most oft there<lb/>
Where most it promises, and oft it hits<lb/>
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;<lb/>
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:<lb/>
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:<lb/>
It is not so with Him that all things knows<lb/>
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;<lb/>
But most it is presumption in us when<lb/>
The help of heaven we count the act of men.<lb/>
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;<lb/>
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.<lb/>
I am not an impostor that proclaim<lb/>
Myself against the level of mine aim;<lb/>
But know I think and think I know most sure<lb/>
My art is not past power nor you past cure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Are thou so confident? within what space<lb/>
Hopest thou my cure?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The great'st grace lending grace<lb/>
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring<lb/>
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,<lb/>
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp<lb/>
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,<lb/>
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass<lb/>
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,<lb/>
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,<lb/>
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Upon thy certainty and confidence<lb/>
What darest thou venture?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Tax of impudence,<lb/>
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame<lb/>
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name<lb/>
Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse&mdash;if worse&mdash;extended<lb/>
With vilest torture let my life be ended.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak<lb/>
His powerful sound within an organ weak:<lb/>
And what impossibility would slay<lb/>
In common sense, sense saves another way.<lb/>
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate<lb/>
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,<lb/>
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all<lb/>
That happiness and prime can happy call:<lb/>
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate<lb/>
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.<lb/>
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,<lb/>
That ministers thine own death if I die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>If I break time, or flinch in property<lb/>
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,<lb/>
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;<lb/>
But, if I help, what do you promise me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Make thy demand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>But will you make it even?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand<lb/>
What husband in thy power I will command:<lb/>
Exempted be from me the arrogance<lb/>
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,<lb/>
My low and humble name to propagate<lb/>
With any branch or image of thy state;<lb/>
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know<lb/>
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Here is my hand; the premises observed,<lb/>
Thy will by my performance shall be served:<lb/>
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,<lb/>
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.<lb/>
More should I question thee, and more I must,<lb/>
Though more to know could not be more to trust,<lb/>
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest<lb/>
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.<lb/>
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed<lb/>
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.<lb/>

<p><stage>Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter COUNTESS and Clown</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of<lb/>
your breeding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I<lb/>
know my business is but to the court.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>To the court! why, what place make you special,<lb/>
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he<lb/>
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make<lb/>
a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,<lb/>
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed<lb/>
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the<lb/>
court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all<lb/>
men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all<lb/>
questions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,<lb/>
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn<lb/>
buttock, or any buttock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Will your answer serve fit to all questions?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,<lb/>
as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's<lb/>
rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove<lb/>
Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his<lb/>
hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen<lb/>
to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the<lb/>
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all<lb/>
questions?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>From below your duke to beneath your constable, it<lb/>
will fit any question.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>It must be an answer of most monstrous size that<lb/>
must fit all demands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned<lb/>
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that<lb/>
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall<lb/>
do you no harm to learn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in<lb/>
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I<lb/>
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,<lb/>
more, a hundred of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir! spare not me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and<lb/>
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very<lb/>
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well<lb/>
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,<lb/>
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>I play the noble housewife with the time<lb/>
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,<lb/>
And urge her to a present answer back:<lb/>
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:<lb/>
This is not much.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Not much commendation to them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Not much employment for you: you understand me?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>They say miracles are past; and we have our<lb/>
philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,<lb/>
things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that<lb/>
we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves<lb/>
into seeming knowledge, when we should submit<lb/>
ourselves to an unknown fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath<lb/>
shot out in our latter times.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>And so 'tis.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>To be relinquish'd of the artists,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>So I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Both of Galen and Paracelsus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>So I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Of all the learned and authentic fellows,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Right; so I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>That gave him out incurable,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why, there 'tis; so say I too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Not to be helped,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Uncertain life, and sure death.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Just, you say well; so would I have said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you<lb/>
shall read it in&mdash;what do you call there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>That's it; I would have said the very same.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,<lb/>
I speak in respect&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the<lb/>
brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most<lb/>
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Very hand of heaven.<lb/>

<p>In a most weak&mdash;<lb/>

<p>Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the<lb/>
better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's<lb/>
able to lead her a coranto.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>'Fore God, I think so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Go, call before me all the lords in court.<lb/>
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;<lb/>
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense<lb/>
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive<lb/>
The confirmation of my promised gift,<lb/>
Which but attends thy naming.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter three or four Lords</stage></p>


<p>
Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel<lb/>
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,<lb/>
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice<lb/>
I have to use: thy frank election make;<lb/>
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress<lb/>
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,<lb/>
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',<lb/>
And writ as little beard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Peruse them well:<lb/>
Not one of those but had a noble father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen,<lb/>
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>We understand it, and thank heaven for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,<lb/>
That I protest I simply am a maid.<lb/>
Please it your majesty, I have done already:<lb/>
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,<lb/>
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,<lb/>
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;<lb/>
We'll ne'er come there again.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Make choice; and, see,<lb/>
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,<lb/>
And to imperial Love, that god most high,<lb/>
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>And grant it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace<lb/>
for my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,<lb/>
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:<lb/>
Love make your fortunes twenty times above<lb/>
Her that so wishes and her humble love!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>No better, if you please.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>My wish receive,<lb/>
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,<lb/>
I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the<lb/>
Turk, to make eunuchs of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Be not afraid that I your hand should take;<lb/>
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:<lb/>
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed<lb/>
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:<lb/>
sure, they are bastards to the English; the French<lb/>
ne'er got 'em.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You are too young, too happy, and too good,<lb/>
To make yourself a son out of my blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Fourth Lord</speaker>
<p>Fair one, I think not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk<lb/>
wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth<lb/>
of fourteen; I have known thee already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p><stage>[To BERTRAM]</stage></p><p>  I dare not say I take you; but I give<lb/>
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,<lb/>
Into your guiding power. This is the man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,<lb/>
In such a business give me leave to use<lb/>
The help of mine own eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Know'st thou not, Bertram,<lb/>
What she has done for me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Yes, my good lord;<lb/>
But never hope to know why I should marry her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>But follows it, my lord, to bring me down<lb/>
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:<lb/>
She had her breeding at my father's charge.<lb/>
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain<lb/>
Rather corrupt me ever!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which<lb/>
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<lb/>
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,<lb/>
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<lb/>
In differences so mighty. If she be<lb/>
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,<lb/>
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest<lb/>
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:<lb/>
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<lb/>
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:<lb/>
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,<lb/>
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<lb/>
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<lb/>
The property by what it is should go,<lb/>
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<lb/>
In these to nature she's immediate heir,<lb/>
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,<lb/>
Which challenges itself as honour's born<lb/>
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,<lb/>
When rather from our acts we them derive<lb/>
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave<lb/>
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave<lb/>
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb<lb/>
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb<lb/>
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?<lb/>
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<lb/>
I can create the rest: virtue and she<lb/>
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:<lb/>
Let the rest go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,<lb/>
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<lb/>
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;<lb/>
That dost in vile misprision shackle up<lb/>
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,<lb/>
We, poising us in her defective scale,<lb/>
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,<lb/>
It is in us to plant thine honour where<lb/>
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:<lb/>
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:<lb/>
Believe not thy disdain, but presently<lb/>
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<lb/>
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<lb/>
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<lb/>
Into the staggers and the careless lapse<lb/>
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<lb/>
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,<lb/>
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit<lb/>
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider<lb/>
What great creation and what dole of honour<lb/>
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late<lb/>
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now<lb/>
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,<lb/>
Is as 'twere born so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Take her by the hand,<lb/>
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise<lb/>
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate<lb/>
A balance more replete.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I take her hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Good fortune and the favour of the king<lb/>
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony<lb/>
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,<lb/>
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast<lb/>
Shall more attend upon the coming space,<lb/>
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,<lb/>
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.<lb/>

wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy<lb/>
travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the<lb/>
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from<lb/>
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I<lb/>
have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care<lb/>
not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and<lb/>
that thou't scarce worth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou<lb/>
hasten thy trial; which if&mdash;Lord have mercy on thee<lb/>
for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee<lb/>
well: thy casement I need not open, for I look<lb/>
through thee. Give me thy hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I have not, my lord, deserved it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not<lb/>
bate thee a scruple.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Well, I shall be wiser.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at<lb/>
a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound<lb/>
in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is<lb/>
to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold<lb/>
my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,<lb/>
that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor<lb/>
doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by<lb/>
thee, in what motion age will give me leave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off<lb/>
me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must<lb/>
be patient; there is no fettering of authority.<lb/>
I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with<lb/>
any convenience, an he were double and double a<lb/>
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I<lb/>
would of&mdash;I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter LAFEU</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news<lb/>
for you: you have a new mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make<lb/>
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good<lb/>
lord: whom I serve above is my master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Who? God?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou<lb/>
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of<lb/>
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set<lb/>
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine<lb/>
honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat<lb/>
thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and<lb/>
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast<lb/>
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a<lb/>
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and<lb/>
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords<lb/>
and honourable personages than the commission of your<lb/>
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not<lb/>
worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.<lb/>

I will not bed her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>O my Parolles, they have married me!<lb/>
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits<lb/>
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>There's letters from my mother: what the import is,<lb/>
I know not yet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!<lb/>
He wears his honour in a box unseen,<lb/>
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,<lb/>
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,<lb/>
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet<lb/>
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions<lb/>
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;<lb/>
Therefore, to the war!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,<lb/>
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,<lb/>
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king<lb/>
That which I durst not speak; his present gift<lb/>
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,<lb/>
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife<lb/>
To the dark house and the detested wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.<lb/>
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow<lb/>
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:<lb/>
A young man married is a man that's marr'd:<lb/>
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:<lb/>
The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's<lb/>

<p>If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>What two things?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her<lb/>

God send her quickly!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Bless you, my fortunate lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own<lb/>
good fortunes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them<lb/>
on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,<lb/>
I would she did as you say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Why, I say nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's<lb/>
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say<lb/>
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have<lb/>
nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which<lb/>
is within a very little of nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Away! thou'rt a knave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a<lb/>
knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had<lb/>
been truth, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you<lb/>
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;<lb/>
and much fool may you find in you, even to the<lb/>
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.<lb/>
Madam, my lord will go away to-night;<lb/>
A very serious business calls on him.<lb/>
The great prerogative and rite of love,<lb/>
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;<lb/>
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;<lb/>
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,<lb/>
Which they distil now in the curbed time,<lb/>
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy<lb/>
And pleasure drown the brim.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>What's his will else?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>That you will take your instant leave o' the king<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>You have it from his own deliverance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>And by other warranted testimony.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in<lb/>
knowledge and accordingly valiant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I have then sinned against his experience and<lb/>
transgressed against his valour; and my state that<lb/>
way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my<lb/>
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make<lb/>
us friends; I will pursue the amity.<lb/>

<p>Sir?<lb/>

When I should take possession of the bride,<lb/>
End ere I do begin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>A good traveller is something at the latter end of a<lb/>
dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a<lb/>
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should<lb/>
be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?<lb/>

<p>I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's<lb/>
displeasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs<lb/>
and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and<lb/>
out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer<lb/>
question for your residence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's<lb/>
prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this<lb/>
of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the<lb/>
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in<lb/>
matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them<lb/>
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:<lb/>
I have spoken better of you than you have or will to<lb/>
deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.<lb/>

<p>I shall obey his will.<lb/>
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,<lb/>
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does<lb/>
The ministration and required office<lb/>
On my particular. Prepared I was not<lb/>
For such a business; therefore am I found<lb/>
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you<lb/>
That presently you take our way for home;<lb/>
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,<lb/>
For my respects are better than they seem<lb/>
And my appointments have in them a need<lb/>
Greater than shows itself at the first view<lb/>
To you that know them not. This to my mother:<lb/>

'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so<lb/>

<p>Well, what would you say?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,<lb/>
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;<lb/>
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal<lb/>
What law does vouch mine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>What would you have?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.<lb/>
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:<lb/>
Faith yes;<lb/>
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which<lb/>
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten<lb/>
of thy body that I am father to, then call me<lb/>
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'<lb/>

<p>Ay, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lady, he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.<lb/>
My son corrupts a well-derived nature<lb/>
With his inducement.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Indeed, good lady,<lb/>
The fellow has a deal of that too much,<lb/>

Nothing in France, until he has no wife!<lb/>
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;<lb/>
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I<lb/>
That chase thee from thy country and expose<lb/>
Those tender limbs of thine to the event<lb/>
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I<lb/>
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou<lb/>
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark<lb/>
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,<lb/>
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,<lb/>
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,<lb/>
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.<lb/>
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;<lb/>
Whoever charges on his forward breast,<lb/>
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;<lb/>
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause<lb/>
His death was so effected: better 'twere<lb/>
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd<lb/>
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere<lb/>
That all the miseries which nature owes<lb/>
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,<lb/>
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,<lb/>
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;<lb/>
My being here it is that holds thee hence:<lb/>
Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although<lb/>
The air of paradise did fan the house<lb/>
And angels officed all: I will be gone,<lb/>
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,<lb/>
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!<lb/>
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.<lb/>

Write, write, that from the bloody course of war<lb/>
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:<lb/>
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far<lb/>
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:<lb/>
His taken labours bid him me forgive;<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we<lb/>
shall lose all the sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>They say the French count has done most honourable service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>It is reported that he has taken their greatest<lb/>
commander; and that with his own hand he slew the<lb/>
duke's brother.<lb/>

<p>
We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary<lb/>
way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIANA</speaker>
<p>Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with<lb/>
the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this<lb/>
French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and<lb/>
no legacy is so rich as honesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited<lb/>
by a gentleman his companion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIANA</speaker>
<p>I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a<lb/>
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the<lb/>
young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,<lb/>
enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of<lb/>
lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid<lb/>
hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,<lb/>
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of<lb/>
maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,<lb/>
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten<lb/>
them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but<lb/>
I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,<lb/>
though there were no further danger known but the<lb/>
modesty which is so lost.<lb/>

Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at<lb/>
my house; thither they send one another: I'll<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>To Saint Jaques le Grand.<lb/>
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>At the Saint Francis here beside the port.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>

<p>Ay, marry, is't.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>A march afar</stage></p>


<p>
Hark you! they come this way.<lb/>
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,<lb/>
But till the troops come by,<lb/>
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;<lb/>
The rather, for I think I know your hostess<lb/>
As ample as myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Is it yourself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>If you shall please so, pilgrim.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>You came, I think, from France?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I did so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Here you shall see a countryman of yours<lb/>
That has done worthy service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>His name, I pray you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:<lb/>
His face I know not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Whatsome'er he is,<lb/>
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,<lb/>
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him<lb/>
Against his liking: think you it is so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>There is a gentleman that serves the count<lb/>
Reports but coarsely of her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>What's his name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Monsieur Parolles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O, I believe with him,<lb/>
In argument of praise, or to the worth<lb/>
Of the great count himself, she is too mean<lb/>
To have her name repeated: all her deserving<lb/>
Is a reserved honesty, and that<lb/>
I have not heard examined.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor lady!<lb/>
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife<lb/>
Of a detesting lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,<lb/>
Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her<lb/>
A shrewd turn, if she pleased.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>How do you mean?<lb/>
May be the amorous count solicits her<lb/>
In the unlawful purpose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>He does indeed;<lb/>
And brokes with all that can in such a suit<lb/>
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:<lb/>
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard<lb/>
In honestest defence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARIANA</speaker>

I would he loved his wife: if he were honester<lb/>
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>I like him well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave<lb/>
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,<lb/>
I would Poison that vile rascal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?<lb/>

<p><stage>Camp before Florence.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his<lb/>
way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no<lb/>
more in your respect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>On my life, my lord, a bubble.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Do you think I am so far deceived in him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,<lb/>
without any malice, but to speak of him as my<lb/>
kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and<lb/>
endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner<lb/>
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's<lb/>
entertainment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in<lb/>
his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some<lb/>
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I would I knew in what particular action to try him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>None better than to let him fetch off his drum,<lb/>
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly<lb/>
surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he<lb/>
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink<lb/>
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he<lb/>
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when<lb/>
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship<lb/>
present at his examination: if he do not, for the<lb/>
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of<lb/>
base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the<lb/>
intelligence in his power against you, and that with<lb/>
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never<lb/>
trust my judgment in any thing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;<lb/>
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your<lb/>
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to<lb/>
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be<lb/>
melted, if you give him not John Drum's<lb/>
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.<lb/>
Here he comes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAROLLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to BERTRAM]</stage></p><p>  O, for the love of laughter,<lb/>
hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch<lb/>
off his drum in any hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your<lb/>
disposition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!<lb/>
There was excellent command,&mdash;to charge in with our<lb/>
horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>That was not to be blamed in the command of the<lb/>
service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar<lb/>
himself could not have prevented, if he had been<lb/>
there to command.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some<lb/>
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is<lb/>
not to be recovered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>It might have been recovered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>It might; but it is not now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>It is to be recovered: but that the merit of<lb/>
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact<lb/>
performer, I would have that drum or another, or<lb/>
'hic jacet.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you<lb/>
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this<lb/>
instrument of honour again into his native quarter,<lb/>
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will<lb/>
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you<lb/>
speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.<lb/>
and extend to you what further becomes his<lb/>
greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your<lb/>
worthiness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>But you must not now slumber in it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I'll about it this evening: and I will presently<lb/>
pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my<lb/>
certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;<lb/>
and by midnight look to hear further from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I know not what the success will be, my lord; but<lb/>
the attempt I vow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of<lb/>
thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.<lb/>

<p>I love not many words.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a<lb/>
strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems<lb/>
to undertake this business, which he knows is not to<lb/>
be done; damns himself to do and dares better be<lb/>
damned than to do't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it<lb/>
is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and<lb/>
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but<lb/>
when you find him out, you have him ever after.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of<lb/>
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>None in the world; but return with an invention and<lb/>
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we<lb/>
have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall<lb/>
to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case<lb/>
him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:<lb/>
when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a<lb/>
sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this<lb/>
very night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Your brother he shall go along with me.<lb/>

<p>Now will I lead you to the house, and show you<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>But you say she's honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once<lb/>
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,<lb/>
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,<lb/>

That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,<lb/>
That downward hath succeeded in his house<lb/>
From son to son, some four or five descents<lb/>
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds<lb/>
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,<lb/>
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,<lb/>
Howe'er repented after.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>Now I see<lb/>
The bottom of your purpose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>You see it lawful, then: it is no more,<lb/>
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,<lb/>
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;<lb/>
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,<lb/>
Herself most chastely absent: after this,<lb/>
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns<lb/>
To what is passed already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I have yielded:<lb/>
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,<lb/>
That time and place with this deceit so lawful<lb/>
May prove coherent. Every night he comes<lb/>
With musics of all sorts and songs composed<lb/>
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us<lb/>
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists<lb/>
As if his life lay on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>Why then to-night<lb/>
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,<lb/>
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed<lb/>
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,<lb/>
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:<lb/>
But let's about it.<lb/>

<p><stage>Without the Florentine camp.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other	Soldiers in ambush</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.<lb/>
When you sally upon him, speak what terrible<lb/>
language you will: though you understand it not<lb/>
yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to<lb/>
understand him, unless some one among us whom we<lb/>
must produce for an interpreter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Good captain, let me be the interpreter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>No, sir, I warrant you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>E'en such as you speak to me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He must think us some band of strangers i' the<lb/>
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of<lb/>
all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every<lb/>
one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we<lb/>
speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to<lb/>
know straight our purpose: choughs' language,<lb/>
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,<lb/>
interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,<lb/>
ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,<lb/>
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAROLLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be<lb/>
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have<lb/>
done? It must be a very plausive invention that<lb/>
carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces<lb/>
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find<lb/>
my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the<lb/>
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not<lb/>
daring the reports of my tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue<lb/>
was guilty of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>What the devil should move me to undertake the<lb/>
recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the<lb/>
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I<lb/>
must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in<lb/>
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they<lb/>
will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great<lb/>
ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the<lb/>
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a<lb/>
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of<lb/>
Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Is it possible he should know what he is, and be<lb/>
that he is?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I would the cutting of my garments would serve the<lb/>
turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>We cannot afford you so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in<lb/>
stratagem.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>'Twould not do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Hardly serve.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>How deep?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Thirty fathom.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear<lb/>
I recovered it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>You shall hear one anon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>

<p>Boskos thromuldo boskos.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I know you are the Muskos' regiment:<lb/>
And I shall lose my life for want of language;<lb/>
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,<lb/>
Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll<lb/>
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak<lb/>
thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy<lb/>
faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.<lb/>

<p>The general is content to spare thee yet;<lb/>
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on<lb/>
To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform<lb/>
Something to save thy life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>O, let me live!<lb/>
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,<lb/>
Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that<lb/>
Which you will wonder at.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>But wilt thou faithfully?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>If I do not, damn me.<lb/>

<p>Acordo linta.<lb/>
Come on; thou art granted space.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,<lb/>
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled<lb/>
Till we do hear from them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Soldier</speaker>
<p>Captain, I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>A' will betray us all unto ourselves:<lb/>
Inform on that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Soldier</speaker>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Florence. The Widow's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM and DIANA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>They told me that your name was Fontibell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord, Diana.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Titled goddess;<lb/>
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,<lb/>
In your fine frame hath love no quality?<lb/>
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,<lb/>
You are no maiden, but a monument:<lb/>
When you are dead, you should be such a one<lb/>
As you are now, for you are cold and stem;<lb/>
And now you should be as your mother was<lb/>
When your sweet self was got.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>She then was honest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>So should you be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>No:<lb/>
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,<lb/>
As you owe to your wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>No more o' that;<lb/>
I prithee, do not strive against my vows:<lb/>
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee<lb/>
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever<lb/>
Do thee all rights of service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Ay, so you serve us<lb/>
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,<lb/>
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves<lb/>
And mock us with our bareness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>How have I sworn!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,<lb/>
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.<lb/>
What is not holy, that we swear not by,<lb/>
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,<lb/>
If I should swear by God's great attributes,<lb/>
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,<lb/>
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,<lb/>
To swear by him whom I protest to love,<lb/>
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths<lb/>
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,<lb/>
At least in my opinion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Change it, change it;<lb/>
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;<lb/>
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts<lb/>
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,<lb/>
But give thyself unto my sick desires,<lb/>
Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever<lb/>
My love as it begins shall so persever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I see that men make ropes in such a scarre<lb/>
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power<lb/>
To give it from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Will you not, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>It is an honour 'longing to our house,<lb/>
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<lb/>
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world<lb/>
In me to lose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Mine honour's such a ring:<lb/>
My chastity's the jewel of our house,<lb/>
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;<lb/>
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world<lb/>
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom<lb/>
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,<lb/>
Against your vain assault.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Here, take my ring:<lb/>
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,<lb/>
And I'll be bid by thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:<lb/>
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.<lb/>
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,<lb/>
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,<lb/>
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:<lb/>
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them<lb/>
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:<lb/>
And on your finger in the night I'll put<lb/>
Another ring, that what in time proceeds<lb/>
May token to the future our past deeds.<lb/>
Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won<lb/>
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>For which live long to thank both heaven and me!<lb/>
You may so in the end.<lb/>
My mother told me just how he would woo,<lb/>
As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men<lb/>
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me<lb/>
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him<lb/>
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,<lb/>
Marry that will, I live and die a maid:<lb/>
Only in this disguise I think't no sin<lb/>
To cozen him that would unjustly win.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The Florentine camp.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>You have not given him his mother's letter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I have delivered it an hour since: there is<lb/>
something in't that stings his nature; for on the<lb/>
reading it he changed almost into another man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking<lb/>
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting<lb/>
displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his<lb/>
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a<lb/>
thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the<lb/>
grave of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in<lb/>
Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he<lb/>
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath<lb/>
given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself<lb/>
made in the unchaste composition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,<lb/>
what things are we!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course<lb/>
of all treasons, we still see them reveal<lb/>
themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,<lb/>
so he that in this action contrives against his own<lb/>
nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of<lb/>
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his<lb/>
company to-night?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see<lb/>
his company anatomized, that he might take a measure<lb/>
of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had<lb/>
set this counterfeit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his<lb/>
presence must be the whip of the other.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I hear there is an overture of peace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel<lb/>
higher, or return again into France?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether<lb/>
of his council.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal<lb/>
of his act.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his<lb/>
house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques<lb/>
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere<lb/>
sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the<lb/>
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her<lb/>
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and<lb/>
now she sings in heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>How is this justified?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which<lb/>
makes her story true, even to the point of her<lb/>
death: her death itself, which could not be her<lb/>
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by<lb/>
the rector of the place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Hath the count all this intelligence?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from<lb/>
point, so to the full arming of the verity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain<lb/>
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath<lb/>
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered<lb/>
with a shame as ample.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and<lb/>
ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our<lb/>
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would<lb/>
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
How now! where's your master?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath<lb/>
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next<lb/>
morning for France. The duke hath offered him<lb/>
letters of commendations to the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>They shall be no more than needful there, if they<lb/>
were more than they can commend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.<lb/>
Here's his lordship now.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM</stage></p>


<p>
How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a<lb/>
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:<lb/>
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his<lb/>
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my<lb/>
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;<lb/>
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected<lb/>
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but<lb/>
that I have not ended yet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>If the business be of any difficulty, and this<lb/>
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of<lb/>
your lordship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to<lb/>
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this<lb/>
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,<lb/>
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived<lb/>
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,<lb/>
poor gallant knave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping<lb/>
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry<lb/>
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;<lb/>
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he<lb/>
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes<lb/>
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to<lb/>
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the<lb/>
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Nothing of me, has a'?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his<lb/>
face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you<lb/>
are, you must have the patience to hear it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>

me: hush, hush!<lb/>

answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.<lb/>

duke is strong.' What say you to that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Five or six thousand; but very weak and<lb/>
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and<lb/>
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation<lb/>
and credit and as I hope to live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Shall I set down your answer so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur<lb/>
Parolles, the gallant militarist,&mdash;that was his own<lb/>
phrase,&mdash;that had the whole theoric of war in the<lb/>
knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of<lb/>
his dagger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword<lb/>
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him<lb/>
by wearing his apparel neatly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Well, that's set down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Five or six thousand horse, I said,&mdash; I will say<lb/>
true,&mdash;or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He's very near the truth in this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he<lb/>
delivers it.<lb/>

hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so<lb/>
many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,<lb/>
and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own<lb/>
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and<lb/>
fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and<lb/>
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand<lb/>
poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off<lb/>
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>What shall be done to him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my<lb/>
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Well, that's set down.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Reads</stage></p>


<p>
'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain<lb/>
be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is<lb/>
with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and<lb/>
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not<lb/>
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to<lb/>
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what<lb/>
do you know of it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of<lb/>
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Do you know this Captain Dumain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,<lb/>
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's<lb/>
fool with child,&mdash;a dumb innocent, that could not<lb/>
say him nay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know<lb/>
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your<lb/>
lordship anon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>What is his reputation with the duke?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer<lb/>
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him<lb/>
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Marry, we'll search.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,<lb/>
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters<lb/>
in my tent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I do not know if it be it or no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Our interpreter does it well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Excellently.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an<lb/>
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one<lb/>
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count<lb/>
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very<lb/>
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the<lb/>
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be<lb/>
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to<lb/>
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Damnable both-sides rogue!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;<lb/>
After he scores, he never pays the score:<lb/>
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;<lb/>
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;<lb/>
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,<lb/>
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:<lb/>
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,<lb/>
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.<lb/>
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,<lb/>
PAROLLES.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme<lb/>
in's forehead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold<lb/>
linguist and the armipotent soldier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now<lb/>
he's a cat to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be<lb/>
fain to hang you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to<lb/>
die; but that, my offences being many, I would<lb/>
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,<lb/>
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;<lb/>
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you<lb/>
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to<lb/>
his valour: what is his honesty?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for<lb/>
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he<lb/>
professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he<lb/>
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with<lb/>
such volubility, that you would think truth were a<lb/>
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will<lb/>
be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little<lb/>
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they<lb/>
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but<lb/>
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has<lb/>
every thing that an honest man should not have; what<lb/>
an honest man should have, he has nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I begin to love him for this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon<lb/>
him for me, he's more and more a cat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>What say you to his expertness in war?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English<lb/>
tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of<lb/>
his soldiership I know not; except, in that country<lb/>
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there<lb/>
called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of<lb/>
files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of<lb/>
this I am not certain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He hath out-villained villany so far, that the<lb/>
rarity redeems him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>A pox on him, he's a cat still.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>His qualities being at this poor price, I need not<lb/>
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple<lb/>
of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the<lb/>
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual<lb/>
succession for it perpetually.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Why does be ask him of me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>What's he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so<lb/>
great as the first in goodness, but greater a great<lb/>
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,<lb/>
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:<lb/>
in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming<lb/>
on he has the cramp.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray<lb/>
the Florentine?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all<lb/>
drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to<lb/>
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy<lb/>
the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who<lb/>
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the<lb/>
general says, you that have so traitorously<lb/>
discovered the secrets of your army and made such<lb/>
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can<lb/>
serve the world for no honest use; therefore you<lb/>
must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Unblinding him</stage></p>


<p>
So, look about you: know you any here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, noble captain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>God bless you, Captain Parolles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>God save you, noble captain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?<lb/>
I am for France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet<lb/>
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?<lb/>
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:<lb/>
but fare you well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that<lb/>
has a knot on't yet<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Who cannot be crushed with a plot?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Soldier</speaker>
<p>If you could find out a country where but women were<lb/>
that had received so much shame, you might begin an<lb/>
impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France<lb/>
too: we shall speak of you there.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit with Soldiers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,<lb/>
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;<lb/>
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft<lb/>
As captain shall: simply the thing I am<lb/>
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,<lb/>
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass<lb/>
that every braggart shall be found an ass.<lb/>
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live<lb/>
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!<lb/>
There's place and means for every man alive.<lb/>
I'll after them.<lb/>

<p><stage>Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta<lb/>
fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have<lb/>
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in<lb/>
his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at<lb/>
this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced<lb/>
by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>I would I had not known him; it was the death of the<lb/>
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had<lb/>
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my<lb/>
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I<lb/>
could not have owed her a more rooted love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a<lb/>
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the<lb/>
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much<lb/>
skill in grass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Your distinction?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>So you were a knave at his service, indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>At your service.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>No, no, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as<lb/>
great a prince as you are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Who's that? a Frenchman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy<lb/>
is more hotter in France than there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>What prince is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of<lb/>
darkness; alias, the devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this<lb/>
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;<lb/>
serve him still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a<lb/>
great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a<lb/>
good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the<lb/>
world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for<lb/>
the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be<lb/>
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble<lb/>
themselves may; but the many will be too chill and<lb/>
tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that<lb/>
leads to the broad gate and the great fire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I<lb/>
tell thee so before, because I would not fall out<lb/>
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well<lb/>
looked to, without any tricks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be<lb/>
jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>A shrewd knave and an unhappy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much<lb/>
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,<lb/>
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,<lb/>
indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to<lb/>
tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and<lb/>
that my lord your son was upon his return home, I<lb/>
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of<lb/>
my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,<lb/>
his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did<lb/>
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do<lb/>
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath<lb/>
conceived against your son, there is no fitter<lb/>
matter. How does your ladyship like it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>With very much content, my lord; and I wish it<lb/>
happily effected.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able<lb/>
body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here<lb/>
to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such<lb/>
intelligence hath seldom failed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I<lb/>
die. I have letters that my son will be here<lb/>
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain<lb/>
with me till they meet together.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might<lb/>
safely be admitted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>You need but plead your honourable privilege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I<lb/>
thank my God it holds yet.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Clown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of<lb/>
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't<lb/>
or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of<lb/>
velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a<lb/>
half, but his right cheek is worn bare.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery<lb/>
of honour; so belike is that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>But it is your carbonadoed face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk<lb/>
with the young noble soldier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine<lb/>
hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head<lb/>
and nod at every man.<lb/>

you, when I have held familiarity with fresher<lb/>
clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's<lb/>
mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong<lb/>
displeasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it<lb/>
smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will<lb/>
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.<lb/>
Prithee, allow the wind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake<lb/>
but by a metaphor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my<lb/>
nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get<lb/>
thee further.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's<lb/>
close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he<lb/>
comes himself.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LAFEU</stage></p>


<p>
Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's<lb/>
cat,&mdash;but not a musk-cat,&mdash;that has fallen into the<lb/>
unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he<lb/>
says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the<lb/>
carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,<lb/>
ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his<lb/>
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to<lb/>
your lordship.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly<lb/>
scratched.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to<lb/>
pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the<lb/>
knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who<lb/>
of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves<lb/>
thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for<lb/>
you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:<lb/>
I am for other business.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;<lb/>
save your word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>My name, my good lord, is Parolles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!<lb/>
give me your hand. How does your drum?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>O my good lord, you were the first that found me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,<lb/>
for you did bring me out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once<lb/>
both the office of God and the devil? One brings<lb/>
thee in grace and the other brings thee out.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpets sound</stage></p>


<p>
The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,<lb/>
inquire further after me; I had talk of you last<lb/>
night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall<lb/>
eat; go to, follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I praise God for you.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<p><stage>Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two	French Lords, with Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem<lb/>
Was made much poorer by it: but your son,<lb/>
As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know<lb/>
Her estimation home.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>'Tis past, my liege;<lb/>
And I beseech your majesty to make it<lb/>
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;<lb/>
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,<lb/>
O'erbears it and burns on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>My honour'd lady,<lb/>
I have forgiven and forgotten all;<lb/>
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,<lb/>
And watch'd the time to shoot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>This I must say,<lb/>
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord<lb/>
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady<lb/>
Offence of mighty note; but to himself<lb/>
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife<lb/>
Whose beauty did astonish the survey<lb/>
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,<lb/>
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve<lb/>
Humbly call'd mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Praising what is lost<lb/>
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;<lb/>
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill<lb/>
All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;<lb/>
The nature of his great offence is dead,<lb/>
And deeper than oblivion we do bury<lb/>
The incensing relics of it: let him approach,<lb/>
A stranger, no offender; and inform him<lb/>
So 'tis our will he should.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I shall, my liege.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>All that he is hath reference to your highness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me<lb/>
That set him high in fame.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BERTRAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>He looks well on't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I am not a day of season,<lb/>
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail<lb/>
In me at once: but to the brightest beams<lb/>
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;<lb/>
The time is fair again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My high-repented blames,<lb/>
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>All is whole;<lb/>
Not one word more of the consumed time.<lb/>
Let's take the instant by the forward top;<lb/>
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees<lb/>
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time<lb/>
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember<lb/>
The daughter of this lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Admiringly, my liege, at first<lb/>
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart<lb/>
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue<lb/>
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,<lb/>
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,<lb/>
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;<lb/>
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;<lb/>
Extended or contracted all proportions<lb/>
To a most hideous object: thence it came<lb/>
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,<lb/>
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye<lb/>
The dust that did offend it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Well excused:<lb/>
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away<lb/>
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,<lb/>
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,<lb/>
To the great sender turns a sour offence,<lb/>
Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults<lb/>
Make trivial price of serious things we have,<lb/>
Not knowing them until we know their grave:<lb/>
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,<lb/>
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust<lb/>
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,<lb/>
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.<lb/>
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.<lb/>
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:<lb/>
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay<lb/>
To see our widower's second marriage-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!<lb/>
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Come on, my son, in whom my house's name<lb/>
Must be digested, give a favour from you<lb/>
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,<lb/>
That she may quickly come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>BERTRAM gives a ring</stage></p>


<p>
By my old beard,<lb/>
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,<lb/>
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,<lb/>
The last that e'er I took her at court,<lb/>
I saw upon her finger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Hers it was not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,<lb/>
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.<lb/>
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,<lb/>
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood<lb/>
Necessitied to help, that by this token<lb/>
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave<lb/>
her<lb/>
Of what should stead her most?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My gracious sovereign,<lb/>
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,<lb/>
The ring was never hers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Son, on my life,<lb/>
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it<lb/>
At her life's rate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I am sure I saw her wear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:<lb/>
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,<lb/>
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name<lb/>
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought<lb/>
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed<lb/>
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully<lb/>
I could not answer in that course of honour<lb/>
As she had made the overture, she ceased<lb/>
In heavy satisfaction and would never<lb/>
Receive the ring again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Plutus himself,<lb/>
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,<lb/>
Hath not in nature's mystery more science<lb/>
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,<lb/>
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know<lb/>
That you are well acquainted with yourself,<lb/>
Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement<lb/>
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety<lb/>
That she would never put it from her finger,<lb/>
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,<lb/>
Where you have never come, or sent it us<lb/>
Upon her great disaster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>She never saw it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;<lb/>
And makest conjectural fears to come into me<lb/>
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove<lb/>
That thou art so inhuman,&mdash;'twill not prove so;&mdash;<lb/>
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,<lb/>
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close<lb/>
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,<lb/>
More than to see this ring. Take him away.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Guards seize BERTRAM</stage></p>


<p>
My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,<lb/>
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,<lb/>
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!<lb/>
We'll sift this matter further.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>If you shall prove<lb/>
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy<lb/>
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,<lb/>
Where yet she never was.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, guarded</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Gentleman</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Gracious sovereign,<lb/>
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:<lb/>
Here's a petition from a Florentine,<lb/>
Who hath for four or five removes come short<lb/>
To tender it herself. I undertook it,<lb/>
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech<lb/>
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know<lb/>
Is here attending: her business looks in her<lb/>
With an importing visage; and she told me,<lb/>
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern<lb/>
Your highness with herself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>  Upon his many protestations to marry me<lb/>
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won<lb/>
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows<lb/>
are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He<lb/>
stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow<lb/>
him to his country for justice: grant it me, O<lb/>
king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer<lb/>
flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.<lb/>
DIANA CAPILET.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for<lb/>
this: I'll none of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,<lb/>
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:<lb/>
Go speedily and bring again the count.<lb/>
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,<lb/>
Was foully snatch'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>Now, justice on the doers!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,<lb/>
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,<lb/>
Yet you desire to marry.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Widow and DIANA</stage></p>


<p>
What woman's that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,<lb/>
Derived from the ancient Capilet:<lb/>
My suit, as I do understand, you know,<lb/>
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Widow</speaker>
<p>I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour<lb/>
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,<lb/>
And both shall cease, without your remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Come hither, count; do you know these women?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, I neither can nor will deny<lb/>
But that I know them: do they charge me further?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Why do you look so strange upon your wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>She's none of mine, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>If you shall marry,<lb/>
You give away this hand, and that is mine;<lb/>
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;<lb/>
You give away myself, which is known mine;<lb/>
For I by vow am so embodied yours,<lb/>
That she which marries you must marry me,<lb/>
Either both or none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you<lb/>
are no husband for her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,<lb/>
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness<lb/>
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour<lb/>
Than for to think that I would sink it here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend<lb/>
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour<lb/>
Than in my thought it lies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Good my lord,<lb/>
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think<lb/>
He had not my virginity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou to her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>She's impudent, my lord,<lb/>
And was a common gamester to the camp.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,<lb/>
He might have bought me at a common price:<lb/>
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,<lb/>
Whose high respect and rich validity<lb/>
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that<lb/>
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,<lb/>
If I be one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>COUNTESS</speaker>
<p>He blushes, and 'tis it:<lb/>
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,<lb/>
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,<lb/>
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;<lb/>
That ring's a thousand proofs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Methought you said<lb/>
You saw one here in court could witness it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I did, my lord, but loath am to produce<lb/>
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>I saw the man to-day, if man he be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Find him, and bring him hither.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit an Attendant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>What of him?<lb/>
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,<lb/>
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;<lb/>
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.<lb/>
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,<lb/>
That will speak any thing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>She hath that ring of yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I think she has: certain it is I liked her,<lb/>
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:<lb/>
She knew her distance and did angle for me,<lb/>
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,<lb/>
As all impediments in fancy's course<lb/>
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,<lb/>
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,<lb/>
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;<lb/>
And I had that which any inferior might<lb/>
At market-price have bought.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I must be patient:<lb/>
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,<lb/>
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;<lb/>
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;<lb/>
Send for your ring, I will return it home,<lb/>
And give me mine again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>I have it not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>What ring was yours, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Sir, much like<lb/>
The same upon your finger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>And this was it I gave him, being abed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>The story then goes false, you threw it him<lb/>
Out of a casement.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I have spoke the truth.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PAROLLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.<lb/>
Is this the man you speak of?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,<lb/>
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,<lb/>
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,<lb/>
By him and by this woman here what know you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>So please your majesty, my master hath been an<lb/>
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,<lb/>
which gentlemen have.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>How, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>How is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>He loved her, sir, and loved her not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an<lb/>
equivocal companion is this!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Do you know he promised me marriage?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Faith, I know more than I'll speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAROLLES</speaker>
<p>Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,<lb/>
as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for<lb/>
indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and<lb/>
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I<lb/>
was in that credit with them at that time that I<lb/>
knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,<lb/>
as promising her marriage, and things which would<lb/>
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not<lb/>
speak what I know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say<lb/>
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy<lb/>
evidence; therefore stand aside.<lb/>
This ring, you say, was yours?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Who lent it you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>It was not lent me neither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Where did you find it, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I found it not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>If it were yours by none of all these ways,<lb/>
How could you give it him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I never gave it him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off<lb/>
and on at pleasure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Take her away; I do not like her now;<lb/>
To prison with her: and away with him.<lb/>
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,<lb/>
Thou diest within this hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I'll never tell you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Take her away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>I'll put in bail, my liege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>I think thee now some common customer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:<lb/>
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;<lb/>
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.<lb/>
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;<lb/>
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Widow</stage></p>


<p>
The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,<lb/>
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,<lb/>
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,<lb/>
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:<lb/>
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;<lb/>
And at that time he got his wife with child:<lb/>
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:<lb/>
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:<lb/>
And now behold the meaning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Is there no exorcist<lb/>
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?<lb/>
Is't real that I see?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord;<lb/>
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,<lb/>
The name and not the thing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>Both, both. O, pardon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>O my good lord, when I was like this maid,<lb/>
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;<lb/>
And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:<lb/>
'When from my finger you can get this ring<lb/>
And are by me with child,' &amp;c. This is done:<lb/>
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BERTRAM</speaker>
<p>If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,<lb/>
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENA</speaker>
<p>If it appear not plain and prove untrue,<lb/>
Deadly divorce step between me and you!<lb/>
O my dear mother, do I see you living?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LAFEU</speaker>
<p>Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To PAROLLES</stage></p>


<p>
Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,<lb/>
I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:<lb/>
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>Let us from point to point this story know,<lb/>
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To DIANA</stage></p>


<p>
If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,<lb/>
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;<lb/>
For I can guess that by thy honest aid<lb/>
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.<lb/>
Of that and all the progress, more or less,<lb/>
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:<lb/>
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,<lb/>
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.<lb/>

<sp><speaker>KING</speaker>
<p>The king's a beggar, now the play is done:<lb/>
All is well ended, if this suit be won,<lb/>
That you express content; which we will pay,<lb/>
With strife to please you, day exceeding day:<lb/>
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;<lb/>
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.<lb/>
