<p>On the other side of the Atlantic there is a populous city called
Grandville.  It is, as its name indicates, a great city, &mdash; but it is said that
it thinks itself a good deal greater than it really is.  I meant to say that
Grandville was its original name, and the name by which even at the
present day it is called by its own citizens.  But there are certain wits, or
it may be, vulgar people, who by some process have converted this name
into Grindwell.</p>
<p>I may be able, in the course of this sketch, to give a reason why so
sounding and aristocratic a name as Grandville has been changed into the
plebeian one of Grindwell.  I might account for it by adducing similar
instances of changes in the names of cities through the bad pronunciation
and spelling of foreigners.  For instance, the English nickname Livorno
Leghorn, the Germans insist on calling Venice Venedig, and the French
convert Washington into the Chinese word Voss-Hang-Tong.  And so it
may be that the name Grindwell has originated among us Americans
simply from miscalling or misspelling the foreign name of
Grandville.</p>
<p>I incline to think, however, that there is a better reason for the
name.</p>
<p>For a good many years Grandville has been famous for a great
machine, of a very curious construction, which is said to regulate the
movements of the whole city, and almost to convert the men, women,
and children into cranks, wheels, and pinions.  As a model of this
machine does not exist in our Patent Office at Washington, I shall beg
the reader's indulgence while I attempt to give some account of it.  It
may be thought a very curious affair, though I believe there is little
about it that is original or new.  The idea of it was handed down from
remote generations.</p>
<p>In America I know that many persons may consider the Grindwell
Governing Machine a humbug, &mdash; an obsolete, absurd, and tyrannous
institution, wholly unfitted to the nineteenth century.  A machine that
proposes to think and act for the whole people, and which is rigidly
opposed to the people's thinking and acting for themselves, is likely to
find little favor among us.  With us the doctrine is, that each one should
think for himself, &mdash; be an individual mind and will, and not the spoke of
a wheel.  Every American voter or votress is allowed to keep his or her
little intellectual wind-mill, coffee-mill, pepper-mill, loom, steam-engine,
hand-organ, or whatever moral manufacturing or grinding apparatus he
or she likes.  Each one may be his own Church or his own State, and yet
be none the less a good and useful citizen, and the union of the States be
in none the more danger.  But it is not so in Grindwell.  The rules of the
Grindwell machine allow no one to do his own grinding, unless his
mill-wheel is turned by the central governing power.  He must allow the
big State machine to do everything, &mdash; he paying for it, of course.  A
regular programme prescribes what he shall believe and say and do; and
any departure from this order is considered a violation of the laws, or at
least a reprehensible invasion of the time-honored customs of the
city.</p>

 <pb n="577"/>
<p>The Grindwell Governing Machine (though a patent has been taken
out for it in Europe, and it is thought everything of by royal heads and
the gilded flies that buzz about them) is really an old machine, nearly
worn out, and every now and then patched up and painted and varnished
anew.  If a committee of our knowing Yankees were sent over to gain
information with regard to its actual condition, I am inclined to think
they would bring back a curious and not very favorable report.  It
wouldn't astonish me, if they should pronounce the whole apparatus of
the State rotten from top to bottom, and only kept from falling to pieces
by all sorts of ingenious contrivances of an external and temporary
nature, &mdash; here a wheel, or pivot, or spring to be replaced, &mdash; there a
prop or buttress to be set up, &mdash; here a pipe choked up, &mdash; there a boiler
burst, &mdash; and so on, from one end of the works to the other.  However,
the machine keeps a-going, and many persons think it works
beautifully.</p>
<p>Everything is reduced to such perfect system in its operations, that
the necessity for individual opinion is almost superseded, and even
private consciences are laid upon the shelf, &mdash;  just as people lay by an
antiquated timepiece that no winding-up or shaking can persuade into
marking the hours, &mdash; for have they not the clock on the Government
railroad station opposite, which they can at any time consult by stepping
to the window?  For instance, individual honesty is set aside and
replaced by a system of rewards and punishments.  Honesty is an
old-fashioned coat.  The police, like a great sponge, absorbs the private
virtue.  It says to conscience, "Stay there, &mdash; don't trouble yourself, &mdash; I
will act for you."</p>
<p>You drop your purse in the street.  A rogue picks it up.  In his
private conscience he says, "Honesty is a very good thing, perhaps, but
it is by no means the best policy, &mdash; it is simply no policy at all, &mdash; it is
sheer stupidity.  What can be more politic than for me to pocket this
windfall and turn the corner quick?" &mdash; So preacheth his crooked fag-end
of a conscience, that <hi rend="italic">very, very</hi> small still voice, in very
husky tones; but he knows that a policeman, walking behind him, saw
him pick up the purse, which alters the case, &mdash; which, in fact,
completely sets aside his fag-end of a husky-voiced conscience, and
makes virtue his necessity, and necessity his virtue.  External morality is
hastily drawn on as a decent overcoat to hide the tag-rags of his
roguishness, while he magnanimously restores the purse to the
owner.</p>
<p>Jones left his umbrella in a cab one night.  Discovering that he
hadn't it under his arm, he rushed after the cabman; but he was gone.
Jones had his number, however, and with it proceeded the next day to
the police-office, feeling sure that he would find his umbrella there.
And there, in a closet appropriated to articles left in hackney-coaches, &mdash;
a perfect limbo of canes, parasols, shawls, pocket-books, and what-not, --he found it, ticketed and awaiting its lawful owner.  The explanation of
which mystery is, that the cabmen in Grindwell are strictly amenable to
the police for any departure from the system which provides for the
security of private property, and a yearly reward is given to those of the
coach-driving fraternity who prove to be the most faithful restorers of
articles left in their carriages.  Surely, the result of system can no farther
go than this, &mdash; that Monsieur Vaurien's moral sense, like his opinions,
should be absorbed and overruled by the governing powers.</p>
<p>What a capital thing it is to have the great governmental head and
heart thinking and feeling for us!  Why, even the little boys, on winter
afternoons, are restricted by the policemen from sliding on the ice in the
streets, for fear the impetuous little fellows should break or dislocate
some of their bones, and the hospital might have the expense of setting
them; so patriarchal a regard has the machine for its young
friends!</p>
<p>I might allude here to a special department of the machine, which
once had great power in overruling the thoughts

 <pb n="578"/>   and consciences of the people, and which is still
considered by some as not altogether powerless.  I refer to the
Ecclesiastic department of the Grindwell works.  This was formerly the
greatest laborsaving machinery ever invented.  But however powerful the
operation of the Church machinery upon the grandmothers and
grandfathers of the modern Grindwellites, it has certainly fallen greatly
into disuse, and is kept a-going now more for the sake of appearances
than for any real efficacy.  The most knowing ones think it rather old-fashioned and cumbrous, &mdash; at any rate, not comparable to the State
machinery, either in its design or its mode of operation.  And as in these
days of percussion-caps and Minie rifles we lay by an old matchlock or
crossbow, using it only to ornament our walls, &mdash; or as the powdered
postilion with his horn and his boots is superseded by the locomotive and
the electric telegraph, &mdash; so the old rusty Church wheels are removed into
buildings apart from the daily life of the people, where they seem to
revolve harmlessly and without any necessary connection with the State
wheels.</p>
<p>Not that I mean to say that it works smoothly and well at all times,
&mdash; this Grindwell machine.  How can such an old patched and crumbling
apparatus be expected always to work well?  And how can you hope to
find, even in the most enslaved or routine-ridden community, entire
obedience to the will of the monarch and his satellites?  Unfortunately
for the cause of order and quiet, there will always be found certain tough
lumps, in the shape of rebellious or non-conformist men, which refuse to
be melted in the strong solvents or ground up in the swift mills of
Absolutism.  Government must look after these impediments.  If they are
positively dangerous, they must be destroyed or removed.  If only
suspected, or known to be powerless or inactive, they must at least be
watched.</p>
<p>And here, again, the machine of government shows a remarkable
ingenuity of organization.</p>
<p>For instance, it is said that there are pipes laid all along the streets,
like hose, leading from a central reservoir.  Nobody knows exactly what
they are for; but if any one steps upon them, up spirts something like a
stream of gas, and takes the form of a <hi rend="italic">gendarme</hi>, &mdash; and the
unlucky street-walker must pay dear for his carelessness.  Telegraph
wires radiate like cobwebs from the chamber of the main-spring, and
carry intelligence of all that is going on in the houses and streets.
Man-traps are laid under the pavements, &mdash; sometimes they are secretly
introduced under your very table or bed, &mdash; and if anything is said
against that piece of machinery called the main-spring, or against the
head engineer, the trap will nab you and fly away with you, like the
spider that carried off Margery Mopp.  If a number of people get
together to discuss the meaning of and the reasons for the existence of
the main-spring, or any of the big wheels immediately connected
therewith, the ground under them will sometimes give way, and they will
suddenly find themselves in unfurnished apartments not to their liking.
And if any one should be so rash as to put his hand on the wheels, he is
cut to pieces or strangled by the silent, incessant, fatal whirl of the
engine.</p>
<p>The head engineer keeps his machine, and the city on which it
acts, as much in the dark as possible.  He has a special horror of
sunshine.  He seems to think that the sky is one great burning lens, and
his machine-rooms and the city a vast powder-magazine.</p>
<p>There are certain articles thought to be especially dangerous.
Newspapers are strictly forbidden, &mdash; unless first steeped in a tincture of
asbestos of a very dull color, expressly manufactured and supplied by the
Governing Machine.  When properly saturated with the essence of
dulness and death, and brought down from a glaring white and black to a
decidedly ashy-gray neutral color, a few small newspapers are permitted
to be circulated, but with the greatest caution.  They sometimes take fire,
it is said, &mdash;

 <pb n="579"/>
these journals, &mdash; when brought too near any brain
overcharged with electricity.  Two or three times, it is said, the
Governing Machine has been put out of order by the newspapers and
their readers bringing too much electro-magnetism (or something like it)
to bear on parts of the works; &mdash; the machine had even taken fire and
been nearly burnt up, and the head engineer got so singed that he never
dared to take the management of the works again.</p>
<p>So it is thought that nothing is so unfavorable to the working of the
wheels as light, heat, electricity, magnetism, and, generally, all the
imponderable and uncatchable essences that float about in the air; and
these, it is thought, are generated and diffused by these villanous
newspapers.  Certain kinds of books are also forbidden, as being electric
conductors.  Most of the books allowed in the city of Grindwell are so
heavy, that they are thought to be usually non-conductors, and therefore
quite safe in the hands of the people.</p>
<p>It is at the city gates that most vigilance is required with regard to
the prohibited articles.  There the poor fellows who keep the gates have
no rest night or day, &mdash; so many suspicious-looking boxes, bundles,
bales, and barrels claim admittance.  Quantities of articles are arrested
and prevented from entering.  Nothing that can in any way interfere with
the great machine can come in.  Newspapers and books from other
countries are torn and burnt up.  Speaking-trumpets, ear-trumpets,
spectacles, microscopes, spy-glasses, telescopes, and, generally, all
instruments and contrivances for extending the sphere of ordinary
knowledge, are very narrowly examined before they are admitted.  The
only trumpets freely allowed are of a musical sort, fit to amuse the
people, &mdash; the only spectacles, green goggles to keep out the glare of
truth's sunshine, &mdash; the magnifying-glasses, those which exaggerate the
proportions of the imperial governor of the machinery.  All sorts of
moral lightning-rods and telegraph-wires are arrested, and lie in great
piles outside the city walls.</p>
<p>But in spite of the utmost vigilance and care of the officers at the
gates and the sentinels on the thick walls, dangerous articles and
dangerous people will pass in.  A man like Kossuth or Mazzini going
through would produce such a current of the electric fluid, that the
machine would be in great danger of combustion.  Remonstrances were
sometimes sent to neighboring cities, to the effect that they should keep
their light and heat to themselves, and not be throwing such strong
<hi rend="italic">reflections</hi> into the weak eyes of the Grindwellites, and
putting in danger the governmental powder-magazine, &mdash; as the
machine-offices were sometimes called.  An inundation or bad harvest,
producing a famine among the poor, causes great alarm, and the
governmental officers have a time of it, running about distributing alms,
or raising money to keep down the price of bread.  Thousands of
servants in livery, armed with terrific instruments for the destruction of
life, are kept standing on and around the walls of the city, ready at a
moment's notice to shoot down any one who makes any movement or
demonstration in a direction contrary to the laws of the machine.  And to
support this great crowd of liveried lackeys, the people are squeezed like
sponges, till they furnish the necessary money.</p>
<p>The respectable editors of the daily papers go about somewhat as
the dogs do in August, with muzzles on their mouths.  They are
prohibited from printing more than a hundred words a day.  Any
reference to the sunshine, or to any of the subtile and imponderable
substances before mentioned, is considered contrary to the order of the
machines; to compensate for which, there is great show of gaslight
(under glass covers) throughout the city.  Gas and moonshine are the
staple subjects of conversation.  Besides lighting the streets and shops,
the chief use of fire seems to be for cooking, lighting pipes and cigars,
and fireworks to amuse the working classes.</p>
<p>Great attention is paid to polishing

 <pb n="580"/>   and beautifying the outer case of the machine, and the
outer surface generally of the city of Grindwell.  Where any portion of
the framework has fallen into dilapidation and decay, the gaunt skeleton
bones of the ruined structure are decked and covered with leaves and
flowers.  Old rusty boilers that are on the verge of bursting are newly
painted, varnished, and labelled with letters of gold.  The main-spring,
which has grown old and weak, is said to be helped by the secret
application of steam, &mdash; and the fires are fed with huge bundles of
worthless bank-bills and other paper promises.  The noise of the clanking
piston and wheels is drowned by orchestras of music; the roofs and sides
of the machine buildings are covered all over with roses; and the smell
of smoke and machine oil is prevented by scattering delicious perfumes.
The minds of the populace are turned from the precarious condition of
things by all sorts of public amusements, such as mask balls, theatres,
operas, public gardens, etc.</p>
<p>But all this does not preserve some persons from the continual
apprehension that there will be one day a great and terrific explosion.
Some say the city is sleeping over volcanic fires, which will sooner or
later burst up from below and destroy or change the whole upper
surface.  The actual state of things might be represented on canvas by a
gaping, laughing crowd pressing around a Punch-and-Judy exhibition in
the street, beneath a great ruined palace in the process of repairing,
where the rickety scaffolding, the loose stones and mortar, and in fact
the whole rotten building, may at any moment topple down upon their
heads.</p>
<p>But while such grave thoughts are passing in the minds of some
people, I must relate one or two amusing scenes which lately occurred at
the city gates.</p>
<p>Travellers are not prohibited from going and coming; but on
entering, it is necessary to be sure that they bring with their passports
and baggage no prohibited or dangerous articles.  A young man from our
side of the Atlantic, engaged in commerce, had been annoyed a good
deal by the gate-officers opening and searching his baggage.  The next
time he went to Grindwell, he brought, besides his usual trunks and
carpet-bags, a rather large and very mysterious-looking box.  After going
through with the trunks and bags, the officers took hold of this
box.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the young practical joker, "I have great
objections to having that box opened.  Yet it contains, I assure you,
nothing contraband, nothing dangerous to the peace of the Grindwell
government or people.  It is simply a toy I am taking to a friend's house
as a Christmas present to his little boy.  If I open it, I fear I shall have
difficulty in arranging it again as neatly as I wish, &mdash; and it would be a
great disappointment to my little friend Auguste Henri, if he should not
find it neatly packed.  It would show at once that it had been opened;
and children like to have their presents done up nicely, just as they
issued from the shop.  Gentlemen, I shall take it as a great favor, if you
will let it pass."</p>
<p>"Sir," said the head officer, "it is impossible to grant the favor you
ask.  The government is very strict.  Many prohibited articles have lately
found their way in.  We are determined to put a stop to it."</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," said the young man, "take hold of that box, &mdash; lift it.
You see how light it is; you see that there can be no contraband goods
there, &mdash; still less, anything dangerous.  I pray you to let it pass."</p>
<p>"Impossible, Sir!" said the officer.  "How do I know that there is
nothing dangerous there?  The weight is nothing.  Its lightness rather
makes it the more suspicious.  Boxes like this are usually heavy.  This is
something out of the usual course.  I'm afraid there's electricity here.
Gentlemen officers, proceed to do your duty!"</p>
<p>So a crowd of custom-house officers gathered around the suspected
box, with their noses bent down over the lid, awaiting

 <pb n="581"/>  the opening.  One of them was about to proceed with
hammer and chisel.</p>
<p>"Stop," said the young merchant, "I can save you a great deal of
trouble.  I can open it in an instant.  Allow me &mdash; by touching a little
spring here" &mdash; </p>
<p>As he said this, he pressed a secret spring on the side of the box.
No sooner was it done than the lid was thrown back with sudden and
tremendous violence, as if by some living force, and up jumped a
hideous and shaggy monster which knocked the six custom-house
officers flat on their backs.  It was an enormous Punchinello on springs,
who had been confined in the box like the Genie in the Arabian story,
and by the broad grin on his face he seemed delighted with his liberty
and his triumph over his inquisitors.  The six officers lay stunned by the
blow; and while others ran up to see what was the matter, the young
traveller persuaded Mr. Punch back again into his box, and, shutting him
down, took advantage of the confusion to carry it off with the rest of his
baggage, and reach a cab in safety.  When the officers recovered their
senses, the practical joker had escaped into the crowded city.  They
could give no clear account of what had happened; but I verily believe
they thought that Lucifer himself had knocked them down, and was now
let loose in the city of Grindwell.</p>
<p>Another amusing incident occurred afterwards at the city gates.
An American lady, who was a great lover of Art, had purchased a
bronze bust of Plato somewhere on the Continent.  She had it carefully
boxed, and took it along with her baggage.  She got on very well until
she reached the city of Grindwell.  Here she was stopped, of course, and
her baggage examined.  Finding nothing contraband, they were about to
let her pass, when they came to the box containing the ancient
philosopher's head.</p>
<p>"What's this?" they asked.  "What's in this box, so heavy?"</p>

<p>"A bust," said the lady.</p>
<p>"A bust? so heavy? a bust in a lady's baggage? &mdash;
Impossible!"</p>
<p>"I assure you, it is nothing but a bust."</p>
<p>"Pray, whose bust may it be, Madam?"</p>
<p>"The bust of Plato."</p>
<p>"Plato?  Plato?  Who is Plato?  Is he an Italian?"</p>
<p>"He was a Greek philosopher."</p>
<p>"Why is it so heavy?"</p>
<p>"It is a bronze bust."</p>
<p>"We beg your pardon, Madam; but we fear there's something
wrong here.  This Plato may be a conspirator, &mdash; a Carbonaro, &mdash; a
member of some secret society, &mdash; a red-republican, &mdash; a conductor of the
electric fluid.  How can we answer for this Plato?  We don't like this
heavy box; &mdash; these very heavy boxes are suspicious.  Suppose it should
be some infernal-machine.  Madam, we have our doubts.  This box must
be detained till full inquiries are made."</p>
<p>There was no help for it.  The box was detained.  "It must be so,
Plato!"  After waiting several hours, it was brought forward in presence
of the entire company of inquisitors, and cautiously opened.  Seeing no
Plato, but only some sawdust, they grew still more suspicious.  Having
placed the box on the ground, they all retired to a safe distance, as if
awaiting some explosion.  They evidently took it for an
infernal-machine.  In their eyes everything was a machine of some sort
or other.  After waiting some time, and finding that it didn't burst, nor
emit even a smell of sulphur, the boldest man of the party approached it
very cautiously, and upset it with his foot and ran.</p>
<p>All this while the lady and her friends stood by, silent spectators of
this farce.  The only danger of explosion was on their part, with laughter
at the whole scene.  They contrived, however, to keep their
countenances, though less rigidly than the Greek philosopher in the box
did his.</p>
<p>When the custom-house officials found, that, though the box was
upset, nothing occurred, they grew more bold, and, approaching, saw a
piece of the bronze head peering above the sawdust.  Then, for the first
time, they began to feel ashamed of themselves.  So replacing the
sawdust

 <pb n="582"/>   and the cover, they allowed the box to pass into the
city, and tried, by avoiding to speak of the affair among themselves to
forget what donkeys they had been.</p>
<p>The Grindwell government has many such alarms, and never
appears entirely at its ease.  It is fully aware of the combustible nature of
the component parts of the Governing Machine.  There is consequently
great outlay of means to insure its safety.  An immense number of public
spies and functionaries are constantly employed in looking after the fires
and lights about the city.  Heavy restrictions are laid on all substances
containing electricity, and great care is taken lest this subtile fluid should
condense in spots and take the form of lightning.  Fortunately, the
unclouded sunshine seldom comes into Grindwell, else there would be
the same fears with regard to light.</p>
<p>So long as this perpetual surveillance is kept up, the machine
seems to work on well enough in the main; but the moment there is any
remissness on the part of the police, &mdash; bang! goes a small explosion
somewhere, &mdash; or, crack! a bit of the machinery, &mdash; and out rush the
engineers with their bags of cotton-wool or tow to stop up the chinks, or
their bundles of paper money to keep up the steam, or their buckets of
oil and <hi rend="italic">soft soap</hi> to pour upon the wheels.</p>
<p>One eccentric gentleman of my acquaintance persists in predicting
that any day there may be a general blow-up, and the whole concern,
engineers, financiers, priests, soldiers, and flunkies, all go to smash.  He
evidently wishes to see it; though, as far as personal comfort goes, one
would rather be out of the way at such a time.</p>
<p>Most people seem to think, that, considering all things, the present
head engineer is about the best man that could be found for the post he
occupies.  There are, however, a number of the Grindwell people &mdash; I
can't say how many, for they are afraid to speak &mdash; who feel more and
more that they are living in a stifled and altogether abnormal condition,
and wish for an indefinite supply of the light, heat, air, and electricity
