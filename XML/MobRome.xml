<head>Prologue</head>


<p>Two households, both alike in dignity,<lb/>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<lb/>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<lb/>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<lb/>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<lb/>
A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<lb/>
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<lb/>
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<lb/>
The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<lb/>
And the continuance of their parents' rage,<lb/>
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<lb/>
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<lb/>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<lb/>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<lb/>
</p>

<head>Scene 1</head><p><stage>Verona. A public place.</stage>


</p><p><stage>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,	armed with swords and bucklers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>No, for then we should be colliers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>I strike quickly, being moved.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>But thou art not quickly moved to strike.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>A dog of the house of Montague moves me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:<lb/>
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will<lb/>
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes<lb/>
to the wall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,<lb/>
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push<lb/>
Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids<lb/>
to the wall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I<lb/>
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the<lb/>
maids, and cut off their heads.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>The heads of the maids?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;<lb/>
take it in what sense thou wilt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>They must take it in sense that feel it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and<lb/>
'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou<lb/>
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes<lb/>
two of the house of the Montagues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>How! turn thy back and run?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Fear me not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>No, marry; I fear thee!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as<lb/>
they list.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;<lb/>
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ABRAHAM</speaker>
<p>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>I do bite my thumb, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ABRAHAM</speaker>
<p>Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to GREGORY]</stage></p><p>  Is the law of our side, if I say<lb/>
ay?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I<lb/>
bite my thumb, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>Do you quarrel, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ABRAHAM</speaker>
<p>Quarrel sir! no, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ABRAHAM</speaker>
<p>No better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Well, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREGORY</speaker>
<p>Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Yes, better, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ABRAHAM</speaker>
<p>You lie.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SAMPSON</speaker>
<p>Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They fight</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter BENVOLIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Part, fools!<lb/>
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Beats down their swords</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter TYBALT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?<lb/>
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<lb/>
Or manage it to part these men with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,<lb/>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<lb/>
Have at thee, coward!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They fight</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;	then enter Citizens, with clubs</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!<lb/>
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<lb/>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Thou villain Capulet,&mdash;Hold me not, let me go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PRINCE, with Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<lb/>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,&mdash;<lb/>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<lb/>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<lb/>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<lb/>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<lb/>
Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,<lb/>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<lb/>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<lb/>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<lb/>
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,<lb/>
And made Verona's ancient citizens<lb/>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<lb/>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<lb/>
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:<lb/>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<lb/>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<lb/>
For this time, all the rest depart away:<lb/>
You Capulet; shall go along with me:<lb/>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<lb/>
To know our further pleasure in this case,<lb/>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<lb/>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<lb/>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Here were the servants of your adversary,<lb/>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<lb/>
I drew to part them: in the instant came<lb/>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<lb/>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<lb/>
He swung about his head and cut the winds,<lb/>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:<lb/>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<lb/>
Came more and more and fought on part and part,<lb/>
Till the prince came, who parted either part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?<lb/>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun<lb/>
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,<lb/>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<lb/>
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<lb/>
That westward rooteth from the city's side,<lb/>
So early walking did I see your son:<lb/>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me<lb/>
And stole into the covert of the wood:<lb/>
I, measuring his affections by my own,<lb/>
That most are busied when they're most alone,<lb/>
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,<lb/>
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Many a morning hath he there been seen,<lb/>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.<lb/>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<lb/>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<lb/>
Should in the furthest east begin to draw<lb/>
The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,<lb/>
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,<lb/>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<lb/>
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out<lb/>
And makes himself an artificial night:<lb/>
Black and portentous must this humour prove,<lb/>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>My noble uncle, do you know the cause?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>I neither know it nor can learn of him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Have you importuned him by any means?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Both by myself and many other friends:<lb/>
But he, his own affections' counsellor,<lb/>
Is to himself&mdash;I will not say how true&mdash;<lb/>
But to himself so secret and so close,<lb/>
So far from sounding and discovery,<lb/>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,<lb/>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<lb/>
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<lb/>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.<lb/>
We would as willingly give cure as know.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;<lb/>
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,<lb/>
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Good-morrow, cousin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Is the day so young?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>But new struck nine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ay me! sad hours seem long.<lb/>
Was that my father that went hence so fast?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Not having that, which, having, makes them short.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>In love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Out&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Of love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Out of her favour, where I am in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,<lb/>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,<lb/>
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!<lb/>
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<lb/>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<lb/>
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.<lb/>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<lb/>
O any thing, of nothing first create!<lb/>
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<lb/>
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<lb/>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,<lb/>
sick health!<lb/>
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!<lb/>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<lb/>
Dost thou not laugh?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>No, coz, I rather weep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Good heart, at what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>At thy good heart's oppression.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Why, such is love's transgression.<lb/>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<lb/>
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<lb/>
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown<lb/>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<lb/>
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;<lb/>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;<lb/>
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:<lb/>
What is it else? a madness most discreet,<lb/>
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.<lb/>
Farewell, my coz.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Soft! I will go along;<lb/>
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;<lb/>
This is not Romeo, he's some other where.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What, shall I groan and tell thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Groan! why, no.<lb/>
But sadly tell me who.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:<lb/>
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!<lb/>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit<lb/>
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;<lb/>
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,<lb/>
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.<lb/>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<lb/>
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,<lb/>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<lb/>
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,<lb/>
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,<lb/>
For beauty starved with her severity<lb/>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<lb/>
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<lb/>
To merit bliss by making me despair:<lb/>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<lb/>
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, teach me how I should forget to think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>By giving liberty unto thine eyes;<lb/>
Examine other beauties.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>'Tis the way<lb/>
To call hers exquisite, in question more:<lb/>
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows<lb/>
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;<lb/>
He that is strucken blind cannot forget<lb/>
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:<lb/>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<lb/>
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note<lb/>
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?<lb/>
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Of honourable reckoning are you both;<lb/>
And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.<lb/>
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>But saying o'er what I have said before:<lb/>
My child is yet a stranger in the world;<lb/>
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,<lb/>
Let two more summers wither in their pride,<lb/>
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Younger than she are happy mothers made.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>And too soon marr'd are those so early made.<lb/>
The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,<lb/>
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:<lb/>
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,<lb/>
My will to her consent is but a part;<lb/>
An she agree, within her scope of choice<lb/>
Lies my consent and fair according voice.<lb/>
This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,<lb/>
Whereto I have invited many a guest,<lb/>
Such as I love; and you, among the store,<lb/>
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.<lb/>
At my poor house look to behold this night<lb/>
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:<lb/>
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel<lb/>
When well-apparell'd April on the heel<lb/>
Of limping winter treads, even such delight<lb/>
Among fresh female buds shall you this night<lb/>
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,<lb/>
And like her most whose merit most shall be:<lb/>
Which on more view, of many mine being one<lb/>
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,<lb/>
Come, go with me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To Servant, giving a paper</stage></p>


<p>
Go, sirrah, trudge about<lb/>
Through fair Verona; find those persons out<lb/>
Whose names are written there, and to them say,<lb/>
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Find them out whose names are written here! It is<lb/>
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his<lb/>
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with<lb/>
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am<lb/>
sent to find those persons whose names are here<lb/>
writ, and can never find what names the writing<lb/>
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.&mdash;In good time.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,<lb/>
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;<lb/>
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;<lb/>
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:<lb/>
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,<lb/>
And the rank poison of the old will die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>For what, I pray thee?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>For your broken shin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Why, Romeo, art thou mad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;<lb/>
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,<lb/>
Whipp'd and tormented and&mdash;God-den, good fellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I<lb/>
pray, can you read any thing you see?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ay, if I know the letters and the language.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Ye say honestly: rest you merry!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Stay, fellow; I can read.<lb/>

uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece<lb/>

<p>Whose house?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My master's.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the<lb/>
great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house<lb/>
of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.<lb/>
Rest you merry!<lb/>

<p>At this same ancient feast of Capulet's<lb/>
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,<lb/>
With all the admired beauties of Verona:<lb/>
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,<lb/>
Compare her face with some that I shall show,<lb/>
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>When the devout religion of mine eye<lb/>
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;<lb/>
And these, who often drown'd could never die,<lb/>
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!<lb/>
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun<lb/>
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,<lb/>
Herself poised with herself in either eye:<lb/>
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd<lb/>
Your lady's love against some other maid<lb/>
That I will show you shining at this feast,<lb/>
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,<lb/>
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,<lb/>
I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!<lb/>
God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter JULIET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>How now! who calls?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Your mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Madam, I am here.<lb/>
What is your will?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>This is the matter:&mdash;Nurse, give leave awhile,<lb/>
We must talk in secret:&mdash;nurse, come back again;<lb/>
I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.<lb/>
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>She's not fourteen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,&mdash;<lb/>
And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four&mdash;<lb/>
She is not fourteen. How long is it now<lb/>
To Lammas-tide?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>A fortnight and odd days.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Even or odd, of all days in the year,<lb/>
Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.<lb/>
Susan and she&mdash;God rest all Christian souls!&mdash;<lb/>
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;<lb/>
She was too good for me: but, as I said,<lb/>
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;<lb/>
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.<lb/>
'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<lb/>
And she was wean'd,&mdash;I never shall forget it,&mdash;<lb/>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:<lb/>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<lb/>
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;<lb/>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:&mdash;<lb/>
Nay, I do bear a brain:&mdash;but, as I said,<lb/>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<lb/>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<lb/>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!<lb/>
Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,<lb/>
To bid me trudge:<lb/>
And since that time it is eleven years;<lb/>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,<lb/>
She could have run and waddled all about;<lb/>
For even the day before, she broke her brow:<lb/>
And then my husband&mdash;God be with his soul!<lb/>
A' was a merry man&mdash;took up the child:<lb/>
'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?<lb/>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<lb/>
Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,<lb/>
The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'<lb/>
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!<lb/>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,<lb/>
I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;<lb/>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,<lb/>
To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'<lb/>
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow<lb/>
A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;<lb/>
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:<lb/>
'Yea,' quoth my husband, 'fall'st upon thy face?<lb/>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;<lb/>
Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!<lb/>
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:<lb/>
An I might live to see thee married once,<lb/>
I have my wish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme<lb/>
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,<lb/>
How stands your disposition to be married?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>It is an honour that I dream not of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>An honour! were not I thine only nurse,<lb/>
I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,<lb/>
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<lb/>
Are made already mothers: by my count,<lb/>
I was your mother much upon these years<lb/>
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:<lb/>
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>A man, young lady! lady, such a man<lb/>
As all the world&mdash;why, he's a man of wax.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Verona's summer hath not such a flower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>What say you? can you love the gentleman?<lb/>
This night you shall behold him at our feast;<lb/>
Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,<lb/>
And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;<lb/>
Examine every married lineament,<lb/>
And see how one another lends content<lb/>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies<lb/>
Find written in the margent of his eyes.<lb/>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<lb/>
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:<lb/>
The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride<lb/>
For fair without the fair within to hide:<lb/>
That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,<lb/>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<lb/>
So shall you share all that he doth possess,<lb/>
By having him, making yourself no less.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>I'll look to like, if looking liking move:<lb/>
But no more deep will I endart mine eye<lb/>
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you<lb/>
called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?<lb/>
Or shall we on without a apology?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>The date is out of such prolixity:<lb/>
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,<lb/>
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,<lb/>
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;<lb/>
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke<lb/>
After the prompter, for our entrance:<lb/>
But let them measure us by what they will;<lb/>
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;<lb/>
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes<lb/>
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead<lb/>
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,<lb/>
And soar with them above a common bound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I am too sore enpierced with his shaft<lb/>
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,<lb/>
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:<lb/>
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>And, to sink in it, should you burden love;<lb/>
Too great oppression for a tender thing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,<lb/>
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>If love be rough with you, be rough with love;<lb/>
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.<lb/>
Give me a case to put my visage in:<lb/>
A visor for a visor! what care I<lb/>
What curious eye doth quote deformities?<lb/>
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,<lb/>
But every man betake him to his legs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>A torch for me: let wantons light of heart<lb/>
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,<lb/>
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;<lb/>
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.<lb/>
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:<lb/>
If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire<lb/>
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st<lb/>
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>I mean, sir, in delay<lb/>
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.<lb/>
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<lb/>
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>And we mean well in going to this mask;<lb/>
But 'tis no wit to go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Why, may one ask?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I dream'd a dream to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>And so did I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Well, what was yours?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>That dreamers often lie.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<lb/>
She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes<lb/>
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<lb/>
On the fore-finger of an alderman,<lb/>
Drawn with a team of little atomies<lb/>
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;<lb/>
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,<lb/>
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<lb/>
The traces of the smallest spider's web,<lb/>
The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,<lb/>
Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,<lb/>
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,<lb/>
Not so big as a round little worm<lb/>
Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;<lb/>
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut<lb/>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<lb/>
Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.<lb/>
And in this state she gallops night by night<lb/>
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;<lb/>
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,<lb/>
O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,<lb/>
O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,<lb/>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<lb/>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<lb/>
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,<lb/>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<lb/>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail<lb/>
Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,<lb/>
Then dreams, he of another benefice:<lb/>
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,<lb/>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<lb/>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<lb/>
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon<lb/>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<lb/>
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<lb/>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<lb/>
That plats the manes of horses in the night,<lb/>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<lb/>
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<lb/>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<lb/>
That presses them and learns them first to bear,<lb/>
Making them women of good carriage:<lb/>
This is she&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!<lb/>
Thou talk'st of nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>True, I talk of dreams,<lb/>
Which are the children of an idle brain,<lb/>
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<lb/>
Which is as thin of substance as the air<lb/>
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes<lb/>
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,<lb/>
And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,<lb/>
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;<lb/>
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I fear, too early: for my mind misgives<lb/>
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars<lb/>
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<lb/>
With this night's revels and expire the term<lb/>
Of a despised life closed in my breast<lb/>
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<lb/>
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,<lb/>
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.<lb/>

<p>O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!<lb/>
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night<lb/>
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;<lb/>
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!<lb/>
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,<lb/>
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.<lb/>
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,<lb/>

To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?<lb/>
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,<lb/>
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,<lb/>
A villain that is hither come in spite,<lb/>
To scorn at our solemnity this night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Young Romeo is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>'Tis he, that villain Romeo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;<lb/>
He bears him like a portly gentleman;<lb/>
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him<lb/>
To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:<lb/>
I would not for the wealth of all the town<lb/>
Here in my house do him disparagement:<lb/>
Therefore be patient, take no note of him:<lb/>
It is my will, the which if thou respect,<lb/>
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,<lb/>
And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>It fits, when such a villain is a guest:<lb/>
I'll not endure him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>He shall be endured:<lb/>
What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;<lb/>
Am I the master here, or you? go to.<lb/>
You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!<lb/>
You'll make a mutiny among my guests!<lb/>
You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Go to, go to;<lb/>
You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?<lb/>
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:<lb/>
You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.<lb/>
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:<lb/>
Be quiet, or&mdash;More light, more light! For shame!<lb/>
I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting<lb/>
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.<lb/>
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall<lb/>
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.<lb/>

<p><stage>[To JULIET]</stage></p><p>  If I profane with my unworthiest hand<lb/>
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:<lb/>
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand<lb/>
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,<lb/>
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<lb/>
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,<lb/>
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;<lb/>
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.<lb/>
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Then have my lips the sin that they have took.<lb/>

<p>What is her mother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Marry, bachelor,<lb/>
Her mother is the lady of the house,<lb/>
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous<lb/>
I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;<lb/>
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her<lb/>
Shall have the chinks.<lb/>

Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all<lb/>
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.<lb/>

<p>Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>The son and heir of old Tiberio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What's he that now is going out of door?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What's he that follows there, that would not dance?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I know not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Go ask his name: if he be married.<lb/>
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>His name is Romeo, and a Montague;<lb/>
The only son of your great enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>My only love sprung from my only hate!<lb/>
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!<lb/>
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,<lb/>
That I must love a loathed enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>What's this? what's this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>A rhyme I learn'd even now<lb/>
Of one I danced withal.<lb/>

<p>Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,<lb/>
And young affection gapes to be his heir;<lb/>
That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,<lb/>
With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.<lb/>
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,<lb/>
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,<lb/>
But to his foe supposed he must complain,<lb/>
And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:<lb/>
Being held a foe, he may not have access<lb/>
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;<lb/>
And she as much in love, her means much less<lb/>
To meet her new-beloved any where:<lb/>
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet<lb/>
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.<lb/>

He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;<lb/>
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.<lb/>
I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,<lb/>
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,<lb/>
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh<lb/>

</p><p><stage>JULIET appears above at a window</stage></p>


<p>
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?<lb/>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<lb/>
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<lb/>
Who is already sick and pale with grief,<lb/>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:<lb/>
Be not her maid, since she is envious;<lb/>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green<lb/>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<lb/>
It is my lady, O, it is my love!<lb/>
O, that she knew she were!<lb/>
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?<lb/>
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<lb/>
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:<lb/>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<lb/>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<lb/>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<lb/>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<lb/>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<lb/>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<lb/>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<lb/>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<lb/>
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<lb/>
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<lb/>
That I might touch that cheek!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Ay me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>She speaks:<lb/>
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<lb/>
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head<lb/>
As is a winged messenger of heaven<lb/>
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<lb/>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<lb/>
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<lb/>
And sails upon the bosom of the air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<lb/>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<lb/>
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<lb/>
And I'll no longer be a Capulet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<lb/>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<lb/>
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<lb/>
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<lb/>
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<lb/>
What's in a name? that which we call a rose<lb/>
By any other name would smell as sweet;<lb/>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,<lb/>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes<lb/>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<lb/>
And for that name which is no part of thee<lb/>
Take all myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I take thee at thy word:<lb/>
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;<lb/>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night<lb/>
So stumblest on my counsel?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>By a name<lb/>
I know not how to tell thee who I am:<lb/>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<lb/>
Because it is an enemy to thee;<lb/>
Had I it written, I would tear the word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words<lb/>
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:<lb/>
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?<lb/>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<lb/>
And the place death, considering who thou art,<lb/>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;<lb/>
For stony limits cannot hold love out,<lb/>
And what love can do that dares love attempt;<lb/>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>If they do see thee, they will murder thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<lb/>
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,<lb/>
And I am proof against their enmity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>I would not for the world they saw thee here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;<lb/>
And but thou love me, let them find me here:<lb/>
My life were better ended by their hate,<lb/>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>By whose direction found'st thou out this place?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;<lb/>
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.<lb/>
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<lb/>
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,<lb/>
I would adventure for such merchandise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,<lb/>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<lb/>
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night<lb/>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<lb/>
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!<lb/>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'<lb/>
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,<lb/>
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries<lb/>
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<lb/>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<lb/>
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,<lb/>
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,<lb/>
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<lb/>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<lb/>
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:<lb/>
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true<lb/>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<lb/>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<lb/>
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,<lb/>
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,<lb/>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<lb/>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear<lb/>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,<lb/>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<lb/>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What shall I swear by?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Do not swear at all;<lb/>
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<lb/>
Which is the god of my idolatry,<lb/>
And I'll believe thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>If my heart's dear love&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,<lb/>
I have no joy of this contract to-night:<lb/>
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;<lb/>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<lb/>
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!<lb/>
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,<lb/>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<lb/>
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest<lb/>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:<lb/>
And yet I would it were to give again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>But to be frank, and give it thee again.<lb/>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:<lb/>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<lb/>
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<lb/>
The more I have, for both are infinite.<lb/>

Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<lb/>
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<lb/>
From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:<lb/>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<lb/>
The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,<lb/>
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<lb/>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<lb/>

What is her burying grave that is her womb,<lb/>
And from her womb children of divers kind<lb/>
We sucking on her natural bosom find,<lb/>
Many for many virtues excellent,<lb/>
None but for some and yet all different.<lb/>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<lb/>
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:<lb/>
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live<lb/>
But to the earth some special good doth give,<lb/>
Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use<lb/>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:<lb/>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;<lb/>
And vice sometimes by action dignified.<lb/>
Within the infant rind of this small flower<lb/>
Poison hath residence and medicine power:<lb/>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;<lb/>
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<lb/>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still<lb/>
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;<lb/>
And where the worser is predominant,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Benedicite!<lb/>
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?<lb/>
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head<lb/>
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:<lb/>
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,<lb/>
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;<lb/>
But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain<lb/>
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:<lb/>
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<lb/>
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;<lb/>
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,<lb/>
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;<lb/>
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.<lb/>
I have been feasting with mine enemy,<lb/>
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,<lb/>
That's by me wounded: both our remedies<lb/>
Within thy help and holy physic lies:<lb/>
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,<lb/>
My intercession likewise steads my foe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;<lb/>
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set<lb/>
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:<lb/>
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;<lb/>
And all combined, save what thou must combine<lb/>
By holy marriage: when and where and how<lb/>
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,<lb/>
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,<lb/>
That thou consent to marry us to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<lb/>
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,<lb/>
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies<lb/>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<lb/>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<lb/>
Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<lb/>
How much salt water thrown away in waste,<lb/>
To season love, that of it doth not taste!<lb/>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<lb/>
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;<lb/>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<lb/>
Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:<lb/>
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,<lb/>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:<lb/>
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,<lb/>
Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>And bad'st me bury love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Not in a grave,<lb/>
To lay one in, another out to have.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now<lb/>
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;<lb/>
The other did not so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>O, she knew well<lb/>
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.<lb/>
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,<lb/>
In one respect I'll thy assistant be;<lb/>
For this alliance may so happy prove,<lb/>
To turn your households' rancour to pure love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Where the devil should this Romeo be?<lb/>
Came he not home to-night?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.<lb/>
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,<lb/>
Hath sent a letter to his father's house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>A challenge, on my life.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Romeo will answer it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Any man that can write may answer a letter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he<lb/>
dares, being dared.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a<lb/>
white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a<lb/>
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the<lb/>
blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to<lb/>
encounter Tybalt?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Why, what is Tybalt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is<lb/>
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as<lb/>
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and<lb/>
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and<lb/>
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk<lb/>
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the<lb/>
very first house, of the first and second cause:<lb/>
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the<lb/>
hai!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>The what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting<lb/>
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,<lb/>
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good<lb/>
whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,<lb/>
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with<lb/>
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these<lb/>
perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,<lb/>
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their<lb/>
bones, their bones!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,<lb/>
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers<lb/>
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a<lb/>
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to<lb/>
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;<lb/>
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey<lb/>
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior<lb/>
Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation<lb/>
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit<lb/>
fairly last night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in<lb/>
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>That's as much as to say, such a case as yours<lb/>
constrains a man to bow in the hams.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Meaning, to court'sy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Thou hast most kindly hit it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>A most courteous exposition.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Pink for flower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Why, then is my pump well flowered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast<lb/>
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it<lb/>
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O single-soled jest, solely singular for the<lb/>
singleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have<lb/>
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of<lb/>
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:<lb/>
was I with you there for the goose?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast<lb/>
not there for the goose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Nay, good goose, bite not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most<lb/>
sharp sauce.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an<lb/>
inch narrow to an ell broad!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added<lb/>
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?<lb/>
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art<lb/>
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:<lb/>
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,<lb/>
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Stop there, stop there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:<lb/>
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and<lb/>
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Here's goodly gear!<lb/>

<p>Anon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>My fan, Peter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the<lb/>
fairer face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>God ye good morrow, gentlemen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Is it good den?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the<lb/>
dial is now upon the prick of noon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Out upon you! what a man are you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to<lb/>
mar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'<lb/>
quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I<lb/>
may find the young Romeo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when<lb/>
you have found him than he was when you sought him:<lb/>
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>You say well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;<lb/>
wisely, wisely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>She will indite him to some supper.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What hast thou found?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,<lb/>
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sings</stage></p>


<p>
An old hare hoar,<lb/>
And an old hare hoar,<lb/>
Is very good meat in lent<lb/>
But a hare that is hoar<lb/>
Is too much for a score,<lb/>
When it hoars ere it be spent.<lb/>
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll<lb/>
to dinner, thither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I will follow you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Singing</stage></p>


<p>
'lady, lady, lady.'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy<lb/>
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,<lb/>
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand<lb/>
to in a month.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him<lb/>
down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such<lb/>
Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.<lb/>
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am<lb/>
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by<lb/>
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon<lb/>
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare<lb/>
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a<lb/>
good quarrel, and the law on my side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about<lb/>
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:<lb/>
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you<lb/>
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:<lb/>
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into<lb/>
a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross<lb/>
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman<lb/>
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double<lb/>
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered<lb/>
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I<lb/>
protest unto thee&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:<lb/>
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as<lb/>
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Bid her devise<lb/>
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;<lb/>
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell<lb/>
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>No truly sir; not a penny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Go to; I say you shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:<lb/>
Within this hour my man shall be with thee<lb/>
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;<lb/>
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy<lb/>
Must be my convoy in the secret night.<lb/>
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:<lb/>
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou, my dear nurse?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,<lb/>
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NURSE</speaker>
<p>Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady&mdash;Lord,<lb/>
Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:&mdash;O, there<lb/>
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain<lb/>
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief<lb/>
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her<lb/>
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer<lb/>
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks<lb/>
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not<lb/>
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for<lb/>
the&mdash;No; I know it begins with some other<lb/>
letter:&mdash;and she hath the prettiest sententious of<lb/>
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good<lb/>
to hear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Commend me to thy lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Ay, a thousand times.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;<lb/>
In half an hour she promised to return.<lb/>
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.<lb/>
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,<lb/>
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,<lb/>
Driving back shadows over louring hills:<lb/>
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,<lb/>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<lb/>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<lb/>
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve<lb/>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.<lb/>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<lb/>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<lb/>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<lb/>
And his to me:<lb/>
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;<lb/>
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.<lb/>
O God, she comes!<lb/>

O honey nurse, what news?<lb/>
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.<lb/>

<p>Peter, stay at the gate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Now, good sweet nurse,&mdash;O Lord, why look'st thou sad?<lb/>
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;<lb/>
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news<lb/>
By playing it to me with so sour a face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:<lb/>
Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!<lb/>

Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?<lb/>
Do you not see that I am out of breath?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath<lb/>
To say to me that thou art out of breath?<lb/>
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay<lb/>
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.<lb/>
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;<lb/>
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:<lb/>
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not<lb/>
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his<lb/>
face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels<lb/>
all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,<lb/>
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are<lb/>
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,<lb/>
but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy<lb/>
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>No, no: but all this did I know before.<lb/>
What says he of our marriage? what of that?<lb/>

<p>Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!<lb/>
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.<lb/>
My back o' t' other side,&mdash;O, my back, my back!<lb/>
Beshrew your heart for sending me about,<lb/>
To catch my death with jaunting up and down!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.<lb/>
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a<lb/>
courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I<lb/>
warrant, a virtuous,&mdash;Where is your mother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Where is my mother! why, she is within;<lb/>
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!<lb/>
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,<lb/>
Where is your mother?'<lb/>

<p>O God's lady dear!<lb/>
Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;<lb/>
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?<lb/>
Henceforward do your messages yourself.<lb/>

There stays a husband to make you a wife:<lb/>
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,<lb/>
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.<lb/>
Hie you to church; I must another way,<lb/>
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love<lb/>
Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:<lb/>
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,<lb/>
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.<lb/>
Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.<lb/>

<p><stage>Friar Laurence's cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>So smile the heavens upon this holy act,<lb/>
That after hours with sorrow chide us not!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,<lb/>
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy<lb/>
That one short minute gives me in her sight:<lb/>
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,<lb/>
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;<lb/>
It is enough I may but call her mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>These violent delights have violent ends<lb/>
And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,<lb/>
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey<lb/>
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness<lb/>
And in the taste confounds the appetite:<lb/>
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;<lb/>
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter JULIET</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot<lb/>
Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:<lb/>
A lover may bestride the gossamer<lb/>
That idles in the wanton summer air,<lb/>
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Good even to my ghostly confessor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>As much to him, else is his thanks too much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy<lb/>
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more<lb/>
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath<lb/>
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue<lb/>
Unfold the imagined happiness that both<lb/>
Receive in either by this dear encounter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,<lb/>
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:<lb/>
They are but beggars that can count their worth;<lb/>
But my true love is grown to such excess<lb/>
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Come, come with me, and we will make short work;<lb/>
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone<lb/>
Till holy church incorporate two in one.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:<lb/>
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,<lb/>
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;<lb/>
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he<lb/>
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword<lb/>
upon the table and says 'God send me no need of<lb/>
thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws<lb/>
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Am I like such a fellow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as<lb/>
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as<lb/>
soon moody to be moved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>And what to?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none<lb/>
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,<lb/>
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,<lb/>
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou<lb/>
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no<lb/>
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what<lb/>
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?<lb/>
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of<lb/>
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as<lb/>
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a<lb/>
man for coughing in the street, because he hath<lb/>
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:<lb/>
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing<lb/>
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for<lb/>
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou<lb/>
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man<lb/>
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>The fee-simple! O simple!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>By my head, here come the Capulets.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>By my heel, I care not.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter TYBALT and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.<lb/>
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>And but one word with one of us? couple it with<lb/>
something; make it a word and a blow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you<lb/>
will give me occasion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Could you not take some occasion without giving?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an<lb/>
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but<lb/>
discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall<lb/>
make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>We talk here in the public haunt of men:<lb/>
Either withdraw unto some private place,<lb/>
And reason coldly of your grievances,<lb/>
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;<lb/>
I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:<lb/>
Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;<lb/>
Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford<lb/>
No better term than this,&mdash;thou art a villain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<lb/>
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<lb/>
To such a greeting: villain am I none;<lb/>
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<lb/>
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I do protest, I never injured thee,<lb/>
But love thee better than thou canst devise,<lb/>
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:<lb/>
And so, good Capulet,&mdash;which name I tender<lb/>
As dearly as my own,&mdash;be satisfied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!<lb/>
Alla stoccata carries it away.<lb/>

Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou have with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine<lb/>
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you<lb/>
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the<lb/>
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher<lb/>
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your<lb/>
ears ere it be out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>I am for you.<lb/>

<p>Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They fight</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.<lb/>
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!<lb/>
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath<lb/>
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:<lb/>
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies	with his followers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>I am hurt.<lb/>
A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.<lb/>
Is he gone, and hath nothing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>What, art thou hurt?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.<lb/>
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Page</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a<lb/>
church-door; but 'tis enough, 'twill serve: ask for<lb/>
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I<lb/>
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'<lb/>
both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a<lb/>
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a<lb/>
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of<lb/>
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I<lb/>
was hurt under your arm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I thought all for the best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MERCUTIO</speaker>
<p>Help me into some house, Benvolio,<lb/>
Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!<lb/>
They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,<lb/>
And soundly too: your houses!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>This gentleman, the prince's near ally,<lb/>
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt<lb/>
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd<lb/>
With Tybalt's slander,&mdash;Tybalt, that an hour<lb/>
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,<lb/>
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate<lb/>
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter BENVOLIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!<lb/>
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,<lb/>
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>This day's black fate on more days doth depend;<lb/>
This but begins the woe, others must end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!<lb/>
Away to heaven, respective lenity,<lb/>
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter TYBALT</stage></p>


<p>
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,<lb/>
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul<lb/>
Is but a little way above our heads,<lb/>
Staying for thine to keep him company:<lb/>
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYBALT</speaker>
<p>Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,<lb/>
Shalt with him hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>This shall determine that.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They fight; TYBALT falls</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Romeo, away, be gone!<lb/>
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.<lb/>
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,<lb/>
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, I am fortune's fool!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Why dost thou stay?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit ROMEO</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Citizens, &amp;c</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?<lb/>
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>There lies that Tybalt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Up, sir, go with me;<lb/>
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their	Wives, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Where are the vile beginners of this fray?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>O noble prince, I can discover all<lb/>
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:<lb/>
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,<lb/>
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!<lb/>
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt<lb/>
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,<lb/>
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.<lb/>
O cousin, cousin!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENVOLIO</speaker>
<p>Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;<lb/>
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink<lb/>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<lb/>
Your high displeasure: all this uttered<lb/>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,<lb/>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<lb/>
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts<lb/>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,<lb/>
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<lb/>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<lb/>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<lb/>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,<lb/>
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,<lb/>
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than<lb/>
his tongue,<lb/>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<lb/>
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<lb/>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<lb/>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<lb/>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<lb/>
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,<lb/>
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I<lb/>
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.<lb/>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<lb/>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>He is a kinsman to the Montague;<lb/>
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:<lb/>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<lb/>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<lb/>
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;<lb/>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;<lb/>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;<lb/>
His fault concludes but what the law should end,<lb/>
The life of Tybalt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>And for that offence<lb/>
Immediately we do exile him hence:<lb/>
I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,<lb/>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;<lb/>
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine<lb/>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:<lb/>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<lb/>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:<lb/>
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,<lb/>
Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.<lb/>
Bear hence this body and attend our will:<lb/>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter JULIET</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<lb/>
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner<lb/>
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,<lb/>
And bring in cloudy night immediately.<lb/>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<lb/>
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo<lb/>
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.<lb/>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<lb/>
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,<lb/>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<lb/>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<lb/>
And learn me how to lose a winning match,<lb/>
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:<lb/>
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,<lb/>
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,<lb/>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<lb/>
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;<lb/>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<lb/>
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.<lb/>
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,<lb/>
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,<lb/>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,<lb/>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<lb/>
That all the world will be in love with night<lb/>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<lb/>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<lb/>
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,<lb/>
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day<lb/>
As is the night before some festival<lb/>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<lb/>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<lb/>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<lb/>
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Nurse, with cords</stage></p>


<p>
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords<lb/>
That Romeo bid thee fetch?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, the cords.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Throws them down</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!<lb/>
We are undone, lady, we are undone!<lb/>
Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Can heaven be so envious?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Romeo can,<lb/>
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!<lb/>
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?<lb/>
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.<lb/>
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'<lb/>
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more<lb/>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:<lb/>
I am not I, if there be such an I;<lb/>
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'<lb/>
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:<lb/>
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,&mdash;<lb/>
God save the mark!&mdash;here on his manly breast:<lb/>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<lb/>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,<lb/>
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!<lb/>
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!<lb/>
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;<lb/>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<lb/>
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!<lb/>
That ever I should live to see thee dead!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What storm is this that blows so contrary?<lb/>
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?<lb/>
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?<lb/>
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!<lb/>
For who is living, if those two are gone?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;<lb/>
Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>It did, it did; alas the day, it did!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!<lb/>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<lb/>
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!<lb/>
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!<lb/>
Despised substance of divinest show!<lb/>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,<lb/>
A damned saint, an honourable villain!<lb/>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,<lb/>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<lb/>
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?<lb/>
Was ever book containing such vile matter<lb/>
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell<lb/>
In such a gorgeous palace!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>There's no trust,<lb/>
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,<lb/>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<lb/>
Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:<lb/>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<lb/>
Shame come to Romeo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Blister'd be thy tongue<lb/>
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:<lb/>
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;<lb/>
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd<lb/>
Sole monarch of the universal earth.<lb/>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<lb/>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,<lb/>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<lb/>
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<lb/>
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:<lb/>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;<lb/>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<lb/>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<lb/>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<lb/>
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:<lb/>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<lb/>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,<lb/>
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;<lb/>
But, O, it presses to my memory,<lb/>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:<lb/>
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo&mdash;banished;'<lb/>
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'<lb/>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death<lb/>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:<lb/>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<lb/>
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,<lb/>
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'<lb/>
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<lb/>
Which modern lamentations might have moved?<lb/>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,<lb/>
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,<lb/>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<lb/>
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'<lb/>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<lb/>
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.<lb/>
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:<lb/>
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,<lb/>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.<lb/>
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,<lb/>
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:<lb/>
He made you for a highway to my bed;<lb/>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<lb/>
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;<lb/>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo<lb/>
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.<lb/>
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:<lb/>
I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.<lb/>

<p>O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,<lb/>

<p><stage>Friar Laurence's cell.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:<lb/>
Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,<lb/>
And thou art wedded to calamity.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?<lb/>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,<lb/>
That I yet know not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Too familiar<lb/>
Is my dear son with such sour company:<lb/>
I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,<lb/>
Not body's death, but body's banishment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'<lb/>
For exile hath more terror in his look,<lb/>
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hence from Verona art thou banished:<lb/>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>There is no world without Verona walls,<lb/>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<lb/>
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,<lb/>
And world's exile is death: then banished,<lb/>
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,<lb/>
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,<lb/>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!<lb/>
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,<lb/>
Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,<lb/>
And turn'd that black word death to banishment:<lb/>
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,<lb/>
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<lb/>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<lb/>
Live here in heaven and may look on her;<lb/>
But Romeo may not: more validity,<lb/>
More honourable state, more courtship lives<lb/>
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize<lb/>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand<lb/>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<lb/>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,<lb/>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<lb/>
But Romeo may not; he is banished:<lb/>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:<lb/>
They are free men, but I am banished.<lb/>
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?<lb/>
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,<lb/>
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,<lb/>
But 'banished' to kill me?&mdash;'banished'?<lb/>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<lb/>
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,<lb/>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<lb/>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,<lb/>
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:<lb/>
Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,<lb/>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!<lb/>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<lb/>
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,<lb/>
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>O, then I see that madmen have no ears.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:<lb/>
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<lb/>
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<lb/>
Doting like me and like me banished,<lb/>
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,<lb/>
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,<lb/>
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,<lb/>
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;<lb/>
Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking</stage></p>


<p>
Run to my study. By and by! God's will,<lb/>
What simpleness is this! I come, I come!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking</stage></p>


<p>
Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Let me come in, and you shall know<lb/>
my errand;<lb/>
I come from Lady Juliet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Welcome, then.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Nurse</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,<lb/>
Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O, he is even in my mistress' case,<lb/>
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!<lb/>
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,<lb/>
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.<lb/>
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:<lb/>
For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;<lb/>
Why should you fall into so deep an O?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Nurse!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?<lb/>
Doth she not think me an old murderer,<lb/>
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy<lb/>
With blood removed but little from her own?<lb/>
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says<lb/>
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;<lb/>
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,<lb/>
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,<lb/>
And then down falls again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>As if that name,<lb/>
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<lb/>
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand<lb/>
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,<lb/>
In what vile part of this anatomy<lb/>
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack<lb/>
The hateful mansion.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drawing his sword</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hold thy desperate hand:<lb/>
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:<lb/>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<lb/>
The unreasonable fury of a beast:<lb/>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<lb/>
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<lb/>
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,<lb/>
I thought thy disposition better temper'd.<lb/>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?<lb/>
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,<lb/>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<lb/>
Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<lb/>
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet<lb/>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<lb/>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;<lb/>
Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,<lb/>
And usest none in that true use indeed<lb/>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:<lb/>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<lb/>
Digressing from the valour of a man;<lb/>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<lb/>
Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;<lb/>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<lb/>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<lb/>
Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,<lb/>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<lb/>
And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.<lb/>
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,<lb/>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;<lb/>
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,<lb/>
But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:<lb/>
The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend<lb/>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:<lb/>
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;<lb/>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<lb/>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<lb/>
Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:<lb/>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<lb/>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<lb/>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:<lb/>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<lb/>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;<lb/>
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time<lb/>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<lb/>
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back<lb/>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<lb/>
Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.<lb/>
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;<lb/>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<lb/>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:<lb/>
Romeo is coming.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night<lb/>
To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!<lb/>
My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:<lb/>
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>How well my comfort is revived by this!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:<lb/>
Either be gone before the watch be set,<lb/>
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:<lb/>
Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,<lb/>
And he shall signify from time to time<lb/>
Every good hap to you that chances here:<lb/>
Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>But that a joy past joy calls out on me,<lb/>
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.<lb/>

<p><stage>A room in Capulet's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,<lb/>
That we have had no time to move our daughter:<lb/>
Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,<lb/>
And so did I:&mdash;Well, we were born to die.<lb/>
'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:<lb/>
I promise you, but for your company,<lb/>
I would have been a-bed an hour ago.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>These times of woe afford no time to woo.<lb/>
Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;<lb/>
To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender<lb/>
Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled<lb/>
In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.<lb/>
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;<lb/>
Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;<lb/>
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next&mdash;<lb/>
But, soft! what day is this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Monday, my lord,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,<lb/>
O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,<lb/>
She shall be married to this noble earl.<lb/>
Will you be ready? do you like this haste?<lb/>
We'll keep no great ado,&mdash;a friend or two;<lb/>
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,<lb/>
It may be thought we held him carelessly,<lb/>
Being our kinsman, if we revel much:<lb/>
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,<lb/>
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.<lb/>
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,<lb/>
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.<lb/>
Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!<lb/>
Afore me! it is so very very late,<lb/>
That we may call it early by and by.<lb/>
Good night.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:<lb/>
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,<lb/>
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;<lb/>
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:<lb/>
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>It was the lark, the herald of the morn,<lb/>
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks<lb/>
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:<lb/>
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day<lb/>
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<lb/>
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:<lb/>
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,<lb/>
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,<lb/>
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:<lb/>
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;<lb/>
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<lb/>
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,<lb/>
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;<lb/>
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat<lb/>
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:<lb/>
I have more care to stay than will to go:<lb/>
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.<lb/>
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!<lb/>
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<lb/>
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<lb/>
Some say the lark makes sweet division;<lb/>
This doth not so, for she divideth us:<lb/>
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,<lb/>
O, now I would they had changed voices too!<lb/>
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<lb/>
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,<lb/>
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!<lb/>
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<lb/>
For in a minute there are many days:<lb/>
O, by this count I shall be much in years<lb/>
Ere I again behold my Romeo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Farewell!<lb/>
I will omit no opportunity<lb/>
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve<lb/>
For sweet discourses in our time to come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<lb/>
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,<lb/>
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:<lb/>
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:<lb/>
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>

<p>O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:<lb/>
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.<lb/>
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;<lb/>
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,<lb/>
But send him back.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?<lb/>
Is she not down so late, or up so early?<lb/>
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LADY CAPULET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, Juliet!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Madam, I am not well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?<lb/>
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<lb/>
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;<lb/>
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;<lb/>
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend<lb/>
Which you weep for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Feeling so the loss,<lb/>
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,<lb/>
As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What villain madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>That same villain, Romeo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Villain and he be many miles asunder.&mdash;<lb/>
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;<lb/>
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>That is, because the traitor murderer lives.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:<lb/>
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:<lb/>
Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,<lb/>
Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,<lb/>
Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,<lb/>
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:<lb/>
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I never shall be satisfied<lb/>
With Romeo, till I behold him&mdash;dead&mdash;<lb/>
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.<lb/>
Madam, if you could find out but a man<lb/>
To bear a poison, I would temper it;<lb/>
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<lb/>
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<lb/>
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.<lb/>
To wreak the love I bore my cousin<lb/>
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.<lb/>
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>And joy comes well in such a needy time:<lb/>
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;<lb/>
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<lb/>
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,<lb/>
That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Madam, in happy time, what day is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,<lb/>
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,<lb/>
The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,<lb/>
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,<lb/>
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.<lb/>
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed<lb/>
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.<lb/>
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<lb/>
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,<lb/>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<lb/>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,<lb/>
And see how he will take it at your hands.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CAPULET and Nurse</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;<lb/>
But for the sunset of my brother's son<lb/>
It rains downright.<lb/>
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?<lb/>
Evermore showering? In one little body<lb/>
Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;<lb/>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<lb/>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<lb/>
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;<lb/>
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,<lb/>
Without a sudden calm, will overset<lb/>
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!<lb/>
Have you deliver'd to her our decree?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.<lb/>
I would the fool were married to her grave!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.<lb/>
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?<lb/>
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,<lb/>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<lb/>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:<lb/>
Proud can I never be of what I hate;<lb/>
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?<lb/>
'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'<lb/>
And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,<lb/>
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,<lb/>
But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,<lb/>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,<lb/>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<lb/>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!<lb/>
You tallow-face!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie! what, are you mad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<lb/>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<lb/>
I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,<lb/>
Or never after look me in the face:<lb/>
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;<lb/>
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<lb/>
That God had lent us but this only child;<lb/>
But now I see this one is one too much,<lb/>
And that we have a curse in having her:<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>God in heaven bless her!<lb/>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,<lb/>
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>I speak no treason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>O, God ye god-den.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>May not one speak?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Peace, you mumbling fool!<lb/>
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;<lb/>
For here we need it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>You are too hot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>God's bread! it makes me mad:<lb/>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<lb/>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<lb/>
To have her match'd: and having now provided<lb/>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<lb/>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,<lb/>
Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,<lb/>
Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;<lb/>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<lb/>
A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,<lb/>
To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,<lb/>
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'<lb/>
But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:<lb/>
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:<lb/>
Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.<lb/>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<lb/>
An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;<lb/>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in<lb/>
the streets,<lb/>
For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,<lb/>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:<lb/>
Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<lb/>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?<lb/>
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!<lb/>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<lb/>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<lb/>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:<lb/>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O God!&mdash;O nurse, how shall this be prevented?<lb/>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;<lb/>
How shall that faith return again to earth,<lb/>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<lb/>
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.<lb/>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<lb/>
Upon so soft a subject as myself!<lb/>
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?<lb/>
Some comfort, nurse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Faith, here it is.<lb/>
Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,<lb/>
That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;<lb/>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<lb/>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<lb/>
I think it best you married with the county.<lb/>
O, he's a lovely gentleman!<lb/>
Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,<lb/>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<lb/>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<lb/>
I think you are happy in this second match,<lb/>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<lb/>
Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,<lb/>
As living here and you no use of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Speakest thou from thy heart?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>And from my soul too;<lb/>
Or else beshrew them both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Amen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>What?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<lb/>
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,<lb/>
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,<lb/>
To make confession and to be absolved.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<lb/>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<lb/>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<lb/>
Which she hath praised him with above compare<lb/>
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;<lb/>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<lb/>
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:<lb/>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>My father Capulet will have it so;<lb/>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>You say you do not know the lady's mind:<lb/>
Uneven is the course, I like it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,<lb/>
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;<lb/>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<lb/>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<lb/>
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,<lb/>
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,<lb/>
To stop the inundation of her tears;<lb/>
Which, too much minded by herself alone,<lb/>
May be put from her by society:<lb/>
Now do you know the reason of this haste.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.<lb/>
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter JULIET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Happily met, my lady and my wife!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>What must be shall be.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>That's a certain text.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Come you to make confession to this father?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>To answer that, I should confess to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Do not deny to him that you love me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>I will confess to you that I love him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>If I do so, it will be of more price,<lb/>
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>The tears have got small victory by that;<lb/>
For it was bad enough before their spite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;<lb/>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>It may be so, for it is not mine own.<lb/>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;<lb/>
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.<lb/>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>God shield I should disturb devotion!<lb/>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:<lb/>
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,<lb/>
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;<lb/>
It strains me past the compass of my wits:<lb/>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<lb/>
On Thursday next be married to this county.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,<lb/>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:<lb/>
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<lb/>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<lb/>
And with this knife I'll help it presently.<lb/>
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;<lb/>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,<lb/>
Shall be the label to another deed,<lb/>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<lb/>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:<lb/>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,<lb/>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<lb/>
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<lb/>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<lb/>
Which the commission of thy years and art<lb/>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<lb/>
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,<lb/>
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,<lb/>
Which craves as desperate an execution.<lb/>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<lb/>
If, rather than to marry County Paris,<lb/>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<lb/>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<lb/>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<lb/>
That copest with death himself to scape from it:<lb/>
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<lb/>
From off the battlements of yonder tower;<lb/>
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk<lb/>
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;<lb/>
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,<lb/>
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,<lb/>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;<lb/>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave<lb/>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;<lb/>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;<lb/>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<lb/>
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent<lb/>
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:<lb/>
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<lb/>
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:<lb/>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<lb/>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;<lb/>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<lb/>
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse<lb/>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:<lb/>
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<lb/>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<lb/>
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,<lb/>
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;<lb/>
Each part, deprived of supple government,<lb/>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:<lb/>
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death<lb/>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<lb/>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<lb/>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<lb/>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:<lb/>
Then, as the manner of our country is,<lb/>
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier<lb/>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<lb/>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<lb/>
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<lb/>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<lb/>
And hither shall he come: and he and I<lb/>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<lb/>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<lb/>
And this shall free thee from this present shame;<lb/>
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,<lb/>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous<lb/>
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed<lb/>
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.<lb/>
Farewell, dear father!<lb/>

<p>Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin<lb/>
Of disobedient opposition<lb/>
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd<lb/>
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,<lb/>

Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.<lb/>

I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.<lb/>

Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.<lb/>

<p>Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:<lb/>
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;<lb/>
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.<lb/>
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,<lb/>
Our whole city is much bound to him.<lb/>

<p>Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,<lb/>
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,<lb/>

What if it be a poison, which the friar<lb/>
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,<lb/>
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,<lb/>
Because he married me before to Romeo?<lb/>
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,<lb/>
For he hath still been tried a holy man.<lb/>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<lb/>
I wake before the time that Romeo<lb/>
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!<lb/>
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,<lb/>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<lb/>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<lb/>
Or, if I live, is it not very like,<lb/>
The horrible conceit of death and night,<lb/>
Together with the terror of the place,&mdash;<lb/>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,<lb/>
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones<lb/>
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:<lb/>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<lb/>
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,<lb/>
At some hours in the night spirits resort;&mdash;<lb/>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<lb/>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<lb/>
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,<lb/>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:&mdash;<lb/>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<lb/>
Environed with all these hideous fears?<lb/>
And madly play with my forefather's joints?<lb/>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?<lb/>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,<lb/>
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?<lb/>
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost<lb/>
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body<lb/>
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!<lb/>

<p>Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:<lb/>
Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;<lb/>
Life and these lips have long been separated:<lb/>
Death lies on her like an untimely frost<lb/>
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O lamentable day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>O woful time!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,<lb/>
Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Come, is the bride ready to go to church?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Ready to go, but never to return.<lb/>
O son! the night before thy wedding-day<lb/>
Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,<lb/>
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.<lb/>
Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;<lb/>
My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,<lb/>
And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Have I thought long to see this morning's face,<lb/>
And doth it give me such a sight as this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!<lb/>
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw<lb/>
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!<lb/>
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,<lb/>
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,<lb/>
And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nurse</speaker>
<p>O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!<lb/>
Most lamentable day, most woful day,<lb/>
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!<lb/>
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!<lb/>
Never was seen so black a day as this:<lb/>
O woful day, O woful day!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!<lb/>
Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,<lb/>
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!<lb/>
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!<lb/>
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now<lb/>
To murder, murder our solemnity?<lb/>
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!<lb/>
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;<lb/>
And with my child my joys are buried.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not<lb/>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<lb/>
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,<lb/>
And all the better is it for the maid:<lb/>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<lb/>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<lb/>
The most you sought was her promotion;<lb/>
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:<lb/>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced<lb/>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<lb/>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,<lb/>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:<lb/>
She's not well married that lives married long;<lb/>
But she's best married that dies married young.<lb/>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<lb/>
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,<lb/>
In all her best array bear her to church:<lb/>
For though fond nature bids us an lament,<lb/>
Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>All things that we ordained festival,<lb/>
Turn from their office to black funeral;<lb/>
Our instruments to melancholy bells,<lb/>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,<lb/>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,<lb/>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<lb/>
And all things change them to the contrary.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;<lb/>
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare<lb/>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:<lb/>
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;<lb/>
Move them no more by crossing their high will.<lb/>

<p>Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;<lb/>
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's<lb/>
ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>Why 'Heart's ease?'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My<lb/>
heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,<lb/>
to comfort me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>You will not, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>I will then give it you soundly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>What will you give us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>No money, on my faith, but the gleek;<lb/>
I will give you the minstrel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>Then I will give you the serving-creature.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on<lb/>
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,<lb/>
I'll fa you; do you note me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>An you re us and fa us, you note us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Musician</speaker>
<p>Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you<lb/>
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer<lb/>
me like men:<lb/>
'When griping grief the heart doth wound,<lb/>
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,<lb/>
Then music with her silver sound'&mdash;<lb/>
why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver<lb/>
sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Musician</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Musician</speaker>
<p>I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Musician</speaker>
<p>Faith, I know not what to say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say<lb/>
for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'<lb/>
because musicians have no gold for sounding:<lb/>
'Then music with her silver sound<lb/>
With speedy help doth lend redress.'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Musician</speaker>
<p>What a pestilent knave is this same!<lb/>

mourners, and stay dinner.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,<lb/>
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:<lb/>
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;<lb/>
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit<lb/>
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.<lb/>
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead&mdash;<lb/>
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave<lb/>
to think!&mdash;<lb/>
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,<lb/>
That I revived, and was an emperor.<lb/>
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,<lb/>
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BALTHASAR, booted</stage></p>


<p>
News from Verona!&mdash;How now, Balthasar!<lb/>
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?<lb/>
How doth my lady? Is my father well?<lb/>
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;<lb/>
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:<lb/>
Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,<lb/>
And her immortal part with angels lives.<lb/>
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,<lb/>
And presently took post to tell it you:<lb/>
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,<lb/>
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!<lb/>
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,<lb/>
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:<lb/>
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import<lb/>
Some misadventure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Tush, thou art deceived:<lb/>
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.<lb/>
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>No matter: get thee gone,<lb/>
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit BALTHASAR</stage></p>


<p>
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.<lb/>
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift<lb/>
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!<lb/>
I do remember an apothecary,&mdash;<lb/>
And hereabouts he dwells,&mdash;which late I noted<lb/>
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,<lb/>
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,<lb/>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:<lb/>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<lb/>
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins<lb/>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<lb/>
A beggarly account of empty boxes,<lb/>
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,<lb/>
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,<lb/>
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.<lb/>
Noting this penury, to myself I said<lb/>
'An if a man did need a poison now,<lb/>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<lb/>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'<lb/>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;<lb/>
And this same needy man must sell it me.<lb/>
As I remember, this should be the house.<lb/>
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.<lb/>
What, ho! apothecary!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Apothecary</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
<p>Who calls so loud?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:<lb/>
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have<lb/>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<lb/>
As will disperse itself through all the veins<lb/>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead<lb/>
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath<lb/>
As violently as hasty powder fired<lb/>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
<p>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law<lb/>
Is death to any he that utters them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<lb/>
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,<lb/>
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,<lb/>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;<lb/>
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;<lb/>
The world affords no law to make thee rich;<lb/>
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
<p>My poverty, but not my will, consents.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Apothecary</speaker>
<p>Put this in any liquid thing you will,<lb/>
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength<lb/>
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROMEO</speaker>
<p>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,<lb/>
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,<lb/>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<lb/>
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<lb/>
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<lb/>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<lb/>
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.<lb/>

<p>Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FRIAR LAURENCE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>This same should be the voice of Friar John.<lb/>
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?<lb/>
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR JOHN</speaker>
<p>Going to find a bare-foot brother out<lb/>
One of our order, to associate me,<lb/>
Here in this city visiting the sick,<lb/>
And finding him, the searchers of the town,<lb/>
Suspecting that we both were in a house<lb/>
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<lb/>
Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;<lb/>
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR JOHN</speaker>
<p>I could not send it,&mdash;here it is again,&mdash;<lb/>
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<lb/>
So fearful were they of infection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,<lb/>
The letter was not nice but full of charge<lb/>
Of dear import, and the neglecting it<lb/>
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;<lb/>
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight<lb/>
Unto my cell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR JOHN</speaker>
<p>Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.<lb/>

Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,<lb/>

See thou deliver it to my lord and father.<lb/>
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,<lb/>
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,<lb/>
And do not interrupt me in my course.<lb/>
Why I descend into this bed of death,<lb/>
Is partly to behold my lady's face;<lb/>
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<lb/>
A precious ring, a ring that I must use<lb/>
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:<lb/>
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<lb/>
In what I further shall intend to do,<lb/>
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<lb/>
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:<lb/>
The time and my intents are savage-wild,<lb/>
More fierce and more inexorable far<lb/>
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.<lb/>

Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!<lb/>
What said my man, when my betossed soul<lb/>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think<lb/>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:<lb/>
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?<lb/>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<lb/>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<lb/>
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!<lb/>
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;<lb/>
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,<lb/>

This vault a feasting presence full of light.<lb/>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.<lb/>

How oft when men are at the point of death<lb/>
Have they been merry! which their keepers call<lb/>
A lightning before death: O, how may I<lb/>
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!<lb/>
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,<lb/>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:<lb/>
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet<lb/>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<lb/>
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.<lb/>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<lb/>
O, what more favour can I do to thee,<lb/>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<lb/>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<lb/>
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,<lb/>
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<lb/>
That unsubstantial death is amorous,<lb/>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<lb/>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<lb/>
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<lb/>
And never from this palace of dim night<lb/>
Depart again: here, here will I remain<lb/>
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here<lb/>
Will I set up my everlasting rest,<lb/>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<lb/>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<lb/>
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<lb/>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<lb/>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<lb/>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!<lb/>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<lb/>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!<lb/>
Here's to my love!<lb/>

The stony entrance of this sepulchre?<lb/>
What mean these masterless and gory swords<lb/>
To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enters the tomb</stage></p>


<p>
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?<lb/>
And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<lb/>
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!<lb/>
The lady stirs.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>JULIET wakes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>O comfortable friar! where is my lord?<lb/>
I do remember well where I should be,<lb/>
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Noise within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest<lb/>
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:<lb/>
A greater power than we can contradict<lb/>
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<lb/>
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;<lb/>
And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee<lb/>
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:<lb/>
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;<lb/>
Come, go, good Juliet,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Noise again</stage></p>


<p>
I dare no longer stay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit FRIAR LAURENCE</stage></p>


<p>
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?<lb/>
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:<lb/>
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop<lb/>
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;<lb/>
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,<lb/>
To make die with a restorative.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kisses him</stage></p>


<p>
Thy lips are warm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Lead, boy: which way?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>JULIET</speaker>
<p>Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Snatching ROMEO's dagger</stage></p>


<p>
This is thy sheath;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Stabs herself</stage></p>


<p>
there rust, and let me die.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:<lb/>
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.<lb/>
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,<lb/>
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,<lb/>
Who here hath lain these two days buried.<lb/>
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:<lb/>
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:<lb/>
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;<lb/>
But the true ground of all these piteous woes<lb/>
We cannot without circumstance descry.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
<p>Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Watchman</speaker>
<p>Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:<lb/>
We took this mattock and this spade from him,<lb/>
As he was coming from this churchyard side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>A great suspicion: stay the friar too.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the PRINCE and Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>What misadventure is so early up,<lb/>
That calls our person from our morning's rest?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>The people in the street cry Romeo,<lb/>
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,<lb/>
With open outcry toward our monument.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>What fear is this which startles in our ears?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;<lb/>
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,<lb/>
Warm and new kill'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;<lb/>
With instruments upon them, fit to open<lb/>
These dead men's tombs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!<lb/>
This dagger hath mista'en&mdash;for, lo, his house<lb/>
Is empty on the back of Montague,&mdash;<lb/>
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY CAPULET</speaker>
<p>O me! this sight of death is as a bell,<lb/>
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MONTAGUE and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Come, Montague; for thou art early up,<lb/>
To see thy son and heir more early down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;<lb/>
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:<lb/>
What further woe conspires against mine age?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Look, and thou shalt see.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>O thou untaught! what manners is in this?<lb/>
To press before thy father to a grave?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,<lb/>
Till we can clear these ambiguities,<lb/>
And know their spring, their head, their<lb/>
true descent;<lb/>
And then will I be general of your woes,<lb/>
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,<lb/>
And let mischance be slave to patience.<lb/>
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>I am the greatest, able to do least,<lb/>
Yet most suspected, as the time and place<lb/>
Doth make against me of this direful murder;<lb/>
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<lb/>
Myself condemned and myself excused.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Then say at once what thou dost know in this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR LAURENCE</speaker>
<p>I will be brief, for my short date of breath<lb/>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<lb/>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<lb/>
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:<lb/>
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day<lb/>
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death<lb/>
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,<lb/>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<lb/>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<lb/>
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce<lb/>
To County Paris: then comes she to me,<lb/>
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean<lb/>
To rid her from this second marriage,<lb/>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<lb/>
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,<lb/>
A sleeping potion; which so took effect<lb/>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<lb/>
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,<lb/>
That he should hither come as this dire night,<lb/>
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,<lb/>
Being the time the potion's force should cease.<lb/>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<lb/>
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight<lb/>
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone<lb/>
At the prefixed hour of her waking,<lb/>
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;<lb/>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,<lb/>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:<lb/>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<lb/>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<lb/>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<lb/>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,<lb/>
And bear this work of heaven with patience:<lb/>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<lb/>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<lb/>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<lb/>
All this I know; and to the marriage<lb/>
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this<lb/>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<lb/>
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,<lb/>
Unto the rigour of severest law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>We still have known thee for a holy man.<lb/>
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>I brought my master news of Juliet's death;<lb/>
And then in post he came from Mantua<lb/>
To this same place, to this same monument.<lb/>
This letter he early bid me give his father,<lb/>
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<lb/>
I departed not and left him there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>Give me the letter; I will look on it.<lb/>
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?<lb/>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;<lb/>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:<lb/>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<lb/>
And by and by my master drew on him;<lb/>
And then I ran away to call the watch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>This letter doth make good the friar's words,<lb/>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:<lb/>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<lb/>
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal<lb/>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<lb/>
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!<lb/>
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<lb/>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.<lb/>
And I for winking at your discords too<lb/>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>O brother Montague, give me thy hand:<lb/>
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more<lb/>
Can I demand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MONTAGUE</speaker>
<p>But I can give thee more:<lb/>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;<lb/>
That while Verona by that name is known,<lb/>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<lb/>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAPULET</speaker>
<p>As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;<lb/>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE</speaker>
<p>A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<lb/>
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:<lb/>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<lb/>
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:<lb/>
For never was a story of more woe<lb/>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
