<head>Renascence</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>All I could see from where I stood</l>
<l>Was three long mountains and a wood;</l>
<l>I turned and looked another way,</l>
<l>And saw three islands in a bay.</l>
<l>So with my eyes I traced the line</l>
<l>Of  the horizon, thin and fine,</l>
<l>Straight around till I was come</l>
<l>Back to where I'd started from;</l>
<l>And all I saw from where I stood</l>
<l>Was three long mountains and a wood.</l>
<l>Over these things I could not see;</l>
<l>These were the things that bounded me;</l>
<l>And I could touch them with my hand,</l>
<l>Almost, I thought, from where I stand.</l>
<l>And all at once things seemed so small</l>
<l>My breath came short, and scarce at all.</l>
<l>But, sure, the sky is big, I said;</l>
<l>Miles and miles above my head;</l>
<l>So here upon my back I'll lie</l>
<l>And look my fill into the sky.</l>
<l>And so I looked, and, after all,</l>
<l>The sky was not so very tall.</l>
<l>The sky, I said, must somewhere stop,</l>
<l>And &mdash; sure enough! &mdash; I see the top!</l>
<l>The sky, I thought, is not so grand;</l>
<l>I 'most could touch it with my hand!</l>
<l>And reaching up my hand to try,</l>
<l>I screamed to feel it touch the sky.</l>
<l>I screamed, and &mdash; lo! &mdash; Infinity</l>
<l>Came down and settled over me;</l>
<l>Forced back my scream into my chest,</l>
<l>Bent back my arm upon my breast,</l>
<l>And, pressing of the Undefined</l>
<l>The definition on my mind,</l>
<l>Held up before my eyes a glass</l>
<l>Through which my shrinking sight did pass</l>
<l>Until it seemed I must behold</l>
<l>Immensity made manifold;</l>
<l>Whispered to me a word whose sound</l>
<l>Deafened the air for worlds around,</l>
<l>And brought unmuffled to my ears</l>
<l>The gossiping of friendly spheres,</l>
<l>The creaking of the tented sky,</l>
<l>The ticking of Eternity.</l>
<l>I saw and heard, and knew at last</l>
<l>The How and Why of all things, past,</l>
<l>And present, and forevermore.</l>
<l>The Universe, cleft to the core,</l>
<l>Lay open to my probing sense</l>
<l>That, sick'ning, I would fain pluck thence</l>
<l>But could not, &mdash; nay! But needs must suck</l>
<l>At the great wound, and could not pluck</l>
<l>My lips away till I had drawn</l>
<l>All venom out. &mdash; Ah, fearful pawn!</l>
<l>For my omniscience paid I toll</l>
<l>In infinite remorse of soul.</l>
<l>All sin was of my sinning, all</l>
<l>Atoning mine, and mine the gall</l>
<l>Of all regret. Mine was the weight</l>
<l>Of every brooded wrong, the hate</l>
<l>That stood behind each envious thrust,</l>
<l>Mine every greed, mine every lust.</l>
<l>And all the while for every grief,</l>
<l>Each suffering, I craved relief</l>
<l>With individual desire, &mdash;</l>
<l>Craved all in vain!  And felt fierce fire</l>
<l>About a thousand people crawl;</l>
<l>Perished with each, &mdash; then mourned for all!</l>
<l>A man was starving in Capri;</l>
<l>He moved his eyes and looked at me;</l>
<l>I felt his gaze, I heard his moan,</l>
<l>And knew his hunger as my own.</l>
<l>I saw at sea a great fog bank</l>
<l>Between two ships that struck and sank;</l>
<l>A thousand screams the heavens smote;</l>
<l>And every scream tore through my throat.</l>
<l>No hurt I did not feel, no death</l>
<l>That was not mine; mine each last breath</l>
<l>That, crying, met an answering cry</l>
<l>From the compassion that was I.</l>
<l>All suffering mine, and mine its rod;</l>
<l>Mine, pity like the pity of God.</l>
<l>Ah, awful weight!  Infinity</l>
<l>Pressed down upon the finite Me!</l>
<l>My anguished spirit, like a bird,</l>
<l>Beating against my lips I heard;</l>
<l>Yet lay the weight so close about</l>
<l>There was no room for it without.</l>
<l>And so beneath the weight lay I</l>
<l>And suffered death, but could not die.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Long had I lain thus, craving death,</l>
<l>When quietly the earth beneath</l>
<l>Gave way, and inch by inch, so great</l>
<l>At last had grown the crushing weight,</l>
<l>Into the earth I sank till I</l>
<l>Full six feet under ground did lie,</l>
<l>And sank no more, &mdash; there is no weight</l>
<l>Can follow here, however great.</l>
<l>From off my breast I felt it roll,</l>
<l>And as it went my tortured soul</l>
<l>Burst forth and fled in such a gust</l>
<l>That all about me swirled the dust.</l>
</lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Deep in the earth I rested now;</l>
<l>Cool is its hand upon the brow</l>
<l>And soft its breast beneath the head</l>
<l>Of one who is so gladly dead.</l>
<l>And all at once, and over all</l>
<l>The pitying rain began to fall;</l>
<l>I lay and heard each pattering hoof</l>
<l>Upon my lowly, thatched roof,</l>
<l>And seemed to love the sound far more</l>
<l>Than ever I had done before.</l>
<l>For rain it hath a friendly sound</l>
<l>To one who's six feet underground;</l>
<l>And scarce the friendly voice or face:</l>
<l>A grave is such a quiet place.</l>
</lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>The rain, I said, is kind to come</l>
<l>And speak to me in my new home.</l>
<l>I would I were alive again</l>
<l>To kiss the fingers of the rain,</l>
<l>To drink into my eyes the shine</l>
<l>Of every slanting silver line,</l>
<l>To catch the freshened, fragrant breeze</l>
<l>From drenched and dripping apple-trees.</l>
<l>For soon the shower will be done,</l>
<l>And then the broad face of the sun</l>
<l>Will laugh above the rain-soaked earth</l>
<l>Until the world with answering mirth</l>
<l>Shakes joyously, and each round drop</l>
<l>Rolls, twinkling, from its grass-blade top.</l>
<l>How can I bear it; buried here,</l>
<l>While overhead the sky grows clear</l>
<l>And blue again after the storm?</l>
<l>O, multi-colored, multiform,</l>
<l>Beloved beauty over me,</l>
<l>That I shall never, never see</l>
<l>Again!  Spring-silver, autumn-gold,</l>
<l>That I shall never more behold!</l>
<l>Sleeping your myriad magics through,</l>
<l>Close-sepulchred away from you!</l>
<l>O God, I cried, give me new birth,</l>
<l>And put me back upon the earth!</l>
<l>Upset each cloud's gigantic gourd</l>
<l>And let the heavy rain, down-poured</l>
<l>In one big torrent, set me free,</l>
<l>Washing my grave away from me!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>I ceased; and through the breathless hush</l>
<l>That answered me, the far-off rush</l>
<l>Of herald wings came whispering</l>
<l>Like music down the vibrant string</l>
<l>Of my ascending prayer, and &mdash; crash!</l>
<l>Before the wild wind's whistling lash</l>
<l>The startled storm-clouds reared on high</l>
<l>And plunged in terror down the sky,</l>
<l>And the big rain in one black wave</l>
<l>Fell from the sky and struck my grave.</l>
<l>I know not how such things can be;</l>
<l>I only know there came to me</l>
<l>A fragrance such as never clings</l>
<l>To aught save happy living things;</l>
<l>A sound as of some joyous elf</l>
<l>Singing sweet songs to please himself,</l>
<l>And, through and over everything,</l>
<l>A sense of glad awakening.</l>
<l>The grass, a-tiptoe at my ear,</l>
<l>Whispering to me I could hear;</l>
<l>I felt the rain's cool finger-tips</l>
<l>Brushed tenderly across my lips,</l>
<l>Laid gently on my sealed sight,</l>
<l>And all at once the heavy night</l>
<l>Fell from my eyes and I could see, &mdash;</l>
<l>A drenched and dripping apple-tree,</l>
<l>A last long line of silver rain,</l>
<l>A sky grown clear and blue again.</l>
<l>And as I looked a quickening gust</l>
<l>Of wind blew up to me and thrust</l>
<l>Into my face a miracle</l>
<l>Of orchard-breath, and with the smell, &mdash;</l>
<l>I know not how such things can be! &mdash;</l>
<l>I breathed my soul back into me.</l>
<l>Ah!  Up then from the ground sprang I</l>
<l>And hailed the earth with such a cry</l>
<l>As is not heard save from a man</l>
<l>Who has been dead, and lives again.</l>
<l>About the trees my arms I wound;</l>
<l>Like one gone mad I hugged the ground;</l>
<l>I raised my quivering arms on high;</l>
<l>I laughed and laughed into the sky,</l>
<l>Till at my throat a strangling sob</l>
<l>Caught fiercely, and a great heart-throb</l>
<l>Sent instant tears into my eyes;</l>
<l>O God, I cried, no dark disguise</l>
<l>Can e'er hereafter hide from me</l>
<l>Thy radiant identity!</l>
<l>Thou canst not move across the grass</l>
<l>But my quick eyes will see Thee pass,</l>
<l>Nor speak, however silently,</l>
<l>But my hushed voice will answer Thee.</l>
<l>I know the path that tells Thy way</l>
<l>Through the cool eve of every day;</l>
<l>God, I can push the grass apart</l>
<l>And lay my finger on Thy heart!</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>The world stands out on either side</l>
<l>No wider than the heart is wide;</l>
<l>Above the world is stretched the sky, &mdash;</l>
<l>No higher than the soul is high.</l>
<l>The heart can push the sea and land</l>
<l>Farther away on either hand;</l>
<l>The soul can split the sky in two,</l>
<l>And let the face of God shine through.</l>
<l>But East and West will pinch the heart</l>
<l>That can not keep them pushed apart;</l>
<l>And he whose soul is flat &mdash; the sky</l>
<l>Will cave in on him by and by.</l>

<div1 type="poem" n="2" id="d7">
<head>Interim</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>The room is full of you! &mdash; As I came in</l>
<l>And closed the door behind me, all at once</l>
<l>A something in the air, intangible,</l>
<l>Yet stiff with meaning, struck my senses sick! &mdash;</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Sharp, unfamiliar odors have destroyed</l>
<l>Each other room's dear personality.</l>
<l>The heavy scent of damp, funereal flowers, &mdash;</l>
<l>The very essence, hush-distilled, of Death &mdash;</l>
<l>Has strangled that habitual breath of home</l>
<l>Whose expiration leaves all houses dead;</l>
<l>And wheresoe'er I look is hideous change.</l>
<l>Save here.  Here 'twas as if a weed-choked gate</l>
<l>Had opened at my touch, and I had stepped</l>
<l>Into some long-forgot, enchanted, strange,</l>
<l>Sweet garden of a thousand years ago</l>
<l>And suddenly thought, "I have been here before!"</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>You are not here.  I know that you are gone,</l>
<l>And will not ever enter here again.</l>
<l>And yet it seems to me, if I should speak,</l>
<l>Your silent step must wake across the hall;</l>
<l>If I should turn my head, that your sweet eyes</l>
<l>Would kiss me from the door. &mdash; So short a time</l>
<l>To teach my life its transposition to</l>
<l>This difficult and unaccustomed key! &mdash;</l>
<l>The room is as you left it; your last touch &mdash;</l>
<l>A thoughtless pressure, knowing not itself</l>
<l>As saintly &mdash; hallows now each simple thing;</l>
<l>Hallows and glorifies, and glows between</l>
<l>The dust's grey fingers like a shielded light.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>There is your book, just as you laid it down,</l>
<l>Face to the table, &mdash; I cannot believe</l>
<l>That you are gone! &mdash; Just then it seemed to me</l>
<l>You must be here.  I almost laughed to think</l>
<l>How like reality the dream had been;</l>
<l>Yet knew before I laughed, and so was still.</l>
<l>That book, outspread, just as you laid it down!</l>
<l>Perhaps you thought, "I wonder what comes next,</l>
<l>And whether this or this will be the end";</l>
<l>So rose, and left it, thinking to return.</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Perhaps that chair, when you arose and passed</l>
<l>Out of the room, rocked silently a while</l>
<l>Ere it again was still. When you were gone</l>
<l>Forever from the room, perhaps that chair,</l>
<l>Stirred by your movement, rocked a little while,</l>
<l>Silently, to and fro. . .</l>
</lg>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>And here are the last words your fingers wrote,</l>
<l>Scrawled in broad characters across a page</l>
<l>In this brown book I gave you. Here your hand,</l>
<l>Guiding your rapid pen, moved up and down.</l>
<l>Here with a looping knot you crossed a "t",</l>
<l>And here another like it, just beyond</l>
<l>These two eccentric "e's".  You were so small,</l>
<l>And wrote so brave a hand!</l>
<l rend="indent">                         How strange it seems</l>
<l>That of all words these are the words you chose!</l>
<l>And yet a simple choice; you did not know</l>
<l>You would not write again.  If you had known &mdash;</l>
<l>But then, it does not matter, &mdash; and indeed</l>
<l>If you had known there was so little time</l>
<l>You would have dropped your pen and come to me</l>
<l>And this page would be empty, and some phrase</l>
<l>Other than this would hold my wonder now.</l>
<l>Yet, since you could not know, and it befell</l>
<l>That these are the last words your fingers wrote,</l>
<l>There is a dignity some might not see</l>
<l>In this, "I picked the first sweet-pea to-day."</l>
<l>To-day!  Was there an opening bud beside it</l>
<l>You left until to-morrow? &mdash; O my love,</l>
<l>The things that withered, &mdash; and you came not back!</l>
<l>That day you filled this circle of my arms</l>
<l>That now is empty.  (O my empty life!)</l>
<l>That day &mdash; that day you picked the first sweet-pea, &mdash;</l>
<l>And brought it in to show me!  I recall</l>
<l>With terrible distinctness how the smell</l>
<l>Of your cool gardens drifted in with you.</l>
<l>I know, you held it up for me to see</l>
<l>And flushed because I looked not at the flower,</l>
<l>But at your face; and when behind my look</l>
<l>You saw such unmistakable intent</l>
<l>You laughed and brushed your flower against my lips.</l>
<l>(You were the fairest thing God ever made,</l>
<l>I think.)  And then your hands above my heart</l>
<l>Drew down its stem into a fastening,</l>
<l>And while your head was bent I kissed your hair.</l>
<l>I wonder if you knew.  (Beloved hands!</l>
<l>Somehow I cannot seem to see them still.</l>
<l>Somehow I cannot seem to see the dust</l>
<l>In your bright hair.)  What is the need of Heaven</l>
<l>When earth can be so sweet? &mdash; If only God</l>
<l>Had let us love, &mdash; and show the world the way!</l>
<l>Strange cancellings must ink th' eternal books</l>
<l>When love-crossed-out will bring the answer right!</l>
<l>That first sweet-pea!  I wonder where it is.</l>
<l>It seems to me I laid it down somewhere,</l>
<l>And yet, &mdash; I am not sure. I am not sure,</l>
<l>Even, if it was white or pink; for then</l>
<l>'Twas much like any other flower to me,</l>
<l>Save that it was the first.  I did not know,</l>
<l>Then, that it was the last.  If I had known &mdash;</l>
<l>But then, it does not matter.  Strange how few,</l>
<l>After all's said and done, the things that are</l>
<l>Of moment.</l>
<l rend="indent">     Few indeed!  When I can make</l>
<l>Of ten small words a rope to hang the world!</l>
<l>"I had you and I have you now no more."</l>
<l>There, there it dangles, &mdash; where's the little truth</l>
<l>That can for long keep footing under that</l>
<l>When its slack syllables tighten to a thought?</l>
<l>Here, let me write it down!  I wish to see</l>
<l>Just how a thing like that will look on paper!</l>
<lb/>
<l>"*I had you and I have you now no more*."</l>
<lb/>
<l>O little words, how can you run so straight</l>
<l>Across the page, beneath the weight you bear?</l>
<l>How can you fall apart, whom such a theme</l>
<l>Has bound together, and hereafter aid</l>
<l>In trivial expression, that have been</l>
<l>So hideously dignified? &mdash; Would God</l>
<l>That tearing you apart would tear the thread</l>
<l>I strung you on!  Would God &mdash; O God, my mind</l>
<l>Stretches asunder on this merciless rack</l>
<l>Of imagery!  O, let me sleep a while!</l>
<l>Would I could sleep, and wake to find me back</l>
<l>In that sweet summer afternoon with you.</l>
<l>Summer?  'Tis summer still by the calendar!</l>

<l>The shining strip is rent; the exquisite</l>

<l>Aches in my breast; part of my heart lies chilled</l>

<l>In two, and suffer for the rest of me.</l>

<l>A Fear that in the deep night starts awake</l>

<head>The Suicide</head>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>"Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!</l>
<l>Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!</l>
<l>And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,</l>
<l>I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly</l>
<l>That I might eat again, and met thy sneers</l>
<l>With deprecations, and thy blows with tears, &mdash;</l>
<l>Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,</l>
<l>As if spent passion were a holiday!</l>
<l>And now I go.  Nor threat, nor easy vow</l>
<l>Of tardy kindness can avail thee now</l>
<l>With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;</l>
<l>Lonely I came, and I depart alone,</l>
<l>And know not where nor unto whom I go;</l>
<l>But that thou canst not follow me I know."</l>
</lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain</l>
<l>My thought ran still, until I spake again:</l>
</lg><lb/>
<l>"Ah, but I go not as I came, &mdash; no trace</l>
<l>Is mine to bear away of that old grace</l>
<l>I brought!  I have been heated in thy fires,</l>
<l>Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,</l>
<l>Thy mark is on me!  I am not the same</l>
<l>Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.</l>
<l>Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.</l>
<l>In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed</l>
<l>Is wakeful for alarm, &mdash; oh, shame to thee,</l>
<l>For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,</l>
<l>Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing!</l>
<l>Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing</l>
<l>To have about the house when I was grown</l>
<l>If thou hadst left my little joys alone!</l>
<l>I asked of thee no favor save this one:</l>
<l>That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!</l>
<l>And this thou didst deny, calling my name</l>
<l>Insistently, until I rose and came.</l>
<l>I saw the sun no more. &mdash; It were not well</l>
<l>So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,</l>
<l>Need I arise to-morrow and renew</l>
<l>Again my hated tasks, but I am through</l>
<l>With all things save my thoughts and this one night,</l>
<l>So that in truth I seem already quite</l>
<l>Free and remote from thee, &mdash; I feel no haste</l>
<l>And no reluctance to depart; I taste</l>
<l>Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,</l>
<l>That in a little while I shall have quaffed."</l>
<lb/>
<l>Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,</l>
<l>Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed</l>
<l>Before me one by one till once again</l>
<l>I set new words unto an old refrain:</l>
<lb/>
<l>"Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!</l>
<l>Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine</l>
<l>Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown</l>
<l>Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!</l>
<l>And I have waited well for thee to show</l>
<l>If any share were mine, &mdash; and now I go!</l>
<l>Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain</l>
<l>I shall but come into mine own again!"</l>
<l>Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,</l>
<l>But turning, straightway, sought a certain door</l>
<l>In the rear wall.  Heavy it was, and low</l>
<l>And dark, &mdash; a way by which none e'er would go</l>
<l>That other exit had, and never knock</l>
<l>Was heard thereat, &mdash; bearing a curious lock</l>
<l>Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,</l>
<l>Whereof Life held content the useless key,</l>
<l>And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,</l>
<l>Whose sudden voice across a silence must,</l>
<l>I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear, &mdash;</l>
<l>A strange door, ugly like a dwarf. &mdash; So near</l>
<l>I came I felt upon my feet the chill</l>
<l>Of acid wind creeping across the sill.</l>
<l>So stood longtime, till over me at last</l>
<l>Came weariness, and all things other passed</l>
<l>To make it room; the still night drifted deep</l>
<l>Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.</l>
<lb/>
<l>But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,</l>
<l>Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!</l>
<l>Startled, I raised my head, &mdash; and with a shout</l>
<l>Laid hold upon the latch, &mdash; and was without.</l>

<l>     *    *    *    *    *</l>
<lg type="stanza">
<l>Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,</l>
<l>Leading me back unto my old abode,</l>
<l>My father's house!  There in the night I came,</l>
<l>And found them feasting, and all things the same</l>
<l>As they had been before.  A splendour hung</l>
<l>Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung</l>
<l>As, echoing out of very long ago,</l>
<l>Had called me from the house of Life, I know.</l>
<l>So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame</l>
<l>On the unlovely garb in which I came;</l>
<l>Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:</l>
<l>"It is my father's house!" I said and knocked;</l>
<l>And the door opened.  To the shining crowd</l>
<l>Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,</l>
<l>Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,</l>
<l>And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.</l>
<l>Ah, days of joy that followed!  All alone</l>
<l>I wandered through the house.  My own, my own,</l>
<l>My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,</l>
<l>All I had lacked so long and loved so well!</l>
<l>None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,</l>
<l>Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.</l>
</lg><lg type="stanza">
<l>I know not when the wonder came to me</l>
<l>Of what my father's business might be,</l>
<l>And whither fared and on what errands bent</l>
<l>The tall and gracious messengers he sent.</l>
<l>Yet one day with no song from dawn till night</l>
<l>Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.</l>
<l>And the next day I called; and on the third</l>
<l>Asked them if I might go, &mdash; but no one heard.</l>
<l>Then, sick with longing, I arose at last</l>
<l>And went unto my father, &mdash; in that vast</l>
<l>Chamber wherein he for so many years</l>
<l>Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.</l>
<l>"Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play</l>
<l>The harp that thou didst give me, and all day</l>
<l>I sit in idleness, while to and fro</l>
<l>About me thy serene, grave servants go;</l>
<l>And I am weary of my lonely ease.</l>
<l>Better a perilous journey overseas</l>
<l>Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,</l>
<l>To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed</l>
<l>That grows to naught, &mdash; I love thee more than they</l>
<l>Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.</l>
<l>Father, I beg of thee a little task</l>
<l>To dignify my days, &mdash; 'tis all I ask</l>
<l>Forever, but forever, this denied,</l>
<l>I perish."</l>
<l rend="indent">          "Child," my father's voice replied,</l>
<l>"All things thy fancy hath desired of me</l>
<l>Thou hast received.  I have prepared for thee</l>
<l>Within my house a spacious chamber, where</l>
<l>Are delicate things to handle and to wear,</l>
<l>And all these things are thine.  Dost thou love song?</l>
<l>My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.</l>
<l>Or sigh for flowers?  My fairest gardens stand</l>
<l>Open as fields to thee on every hand.</l>
<l>And all thy days this word shall hold the same:</l>
<l>No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.</l>
<l>But as for tasks &mdash;" he smiled, and shook his head;</l>
<l>"Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by", he said.</l>
