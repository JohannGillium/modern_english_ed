Sub conservatione formae specificae salva anima. &mdash; <lb/>

</q> 
</epigraph>

<p>I am come of a race noted for vigour of fancy and ardour of 
passion.  Men have called me mad; but the question is not yet 
settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence &mdash; 
whether much that is glorious &mdash; whether all that is profound &mdash; does 
not spring from disease of thought &mdash; from <hi rend="italic">moods</hi> of mind 
exalted at the expense of the general intellect.  They who dream 
by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream 
only by night.  In their grey visions they obtain glimpses of 
eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find that they have been 
upon the verge of the great secret.  In snatches, they learn 
something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere 
knowledge which is of evil.  They penetrate, however rudderless 
or compassless, into the vast ocean of the 
<pb n="170"/>  
'light ineffable' and 
again, like the adventurers of the Nubian geographer, ' 
<hi rend="italic">aggressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi</hi>'. 
</p><p>We will say, then, that I am mad.  I grant, at least, that 
there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence &mdash; the 
condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to 
the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life &mdash; and a 
condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and 
to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of 
my being.  Therefore, what I shall tell of the earlier period, 
believe; and to what I may relate of the later time, give only 
such credit as may seem due; or doubt it altogether; or, if doubt 
it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the Oedipus. 
</p><p>She whom I loved in youth, and of whom I now pen calmly and 
distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only 
sister of my mother long departed.  Eleonora was the name of my 
cousin.  We had always dwelled together, beneath a 
tropical sun, in the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass.  No 
unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay far away 
up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about 
it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses.  No 
path was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, 
there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many 
thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories 
of many millions of fragrant flowers.  Thus it was that we lived 
all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley, &mdash; I, 
and my cousin, and her mother. 
</p><p>From the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end 
of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, 
brighter than all save the eyes of Eleonora; and, winding 
stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length, 
through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those 
whence it had issued.  We called it the 'River of Silence'; for 
there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow.  No murmur 
arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the 
pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its 
bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each 
in its own old station, shining on gloriously for ever. 
</p><p>The margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets 
that glided, through devious ways, into its channel, as well as 
the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the 
depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at 
the bottom, &mdash; these spots, not less than the whole surface of the 
<pb n="171"/>  
valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were 
carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even, 
and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the 
yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the 
ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts, 
in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of God. 
</p><p>And, here and there, in groves about this grass, like 
wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall 
slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully towards 
the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley. 
Their bark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendour of 
ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of 
Eleonora; so that but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves 
that spread from their summits in long tremulous lines, dallying 
with the Zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of 
Syria doing homage to their Sovereign the Sun. 
</p><p>Hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed I 
wish Eleonora before Love entered within our hearts.  It was one 
evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the 
fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other's embrace, beneath 
the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the waters 
of the River of Silence at our images therein.  We spoke no words 
during the rest of that sweet day; and our words even upon the 
morrow were tremulous and few.  We had drawn the god Eros from 
that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the 
fiery souls of our forefathers.  The passions which had for 
centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies 
for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a 
delirious bliss over the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass.  A 
change fell upon all things.  Strange brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burst out upon the trees where no flowers had been known 
before.  The tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by 
one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up, in place of 
them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel.  And life arose in our 
paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay 
glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us.  The 
golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of 
which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, 
into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of 
Aeolus &mdash; sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora.  And now, 
too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions 
of Hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, 
and settling in 
<pb n="172"/>  
peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and 
lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, 
turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, 
as if for ever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of 
glory. 
</p><p>The loveliness of Eleonora was that of the Seraphim; but she 
was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led 
among the flowers.  No guile disguised the fervour of love which 
animated her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses 
as we walked together in the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass, 
and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place 
therein. 
</p><p>At length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad 
change which must befall Humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only 
upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our 
converse, as, in the songs of the bard of Schiraz, the same 
images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive 
variation of phrase. 
</p><p>She had seen that the finger of Death was upon her bosom &mdash; 
that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness 
only to die; but the terrors of the grave, to her, lay solely in 
a consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at 
twilight, by the banks of the River of Silence.  She grieved to 
think that, having entombed her in the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass, I would quit for ever its happy recesses, 
transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to 
some maiden of the outer and every-day world.  And, then and 
there, I threw myself hurriedly at the feet of Eleonora, and 
offered up a vow, to herself and to Heaven, that I would never 
bind myself in marriage to any daughter of Earth &mdash; that I would in 
no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of 
the devout affection with which she had blessed me.  And I called 
the Mighty Ruler of the Universe to witness the pious solemnity 
of my vow.  And the curse which I invoked of <hi rend="italic">Him</hi> and of her, 
a saint in Helusion, should I prove traitorous to that promise, 
involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not 
permit me to make record of it here.  And the bright eyes of 
Eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly 
burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very 
bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow (for what was 
she but a child?), and it made easy to her the bed of her death. 
And she said to me, not many days afterwards, tranquilly dying, 
that, because of what I had done for the comfort of her spirit, 
she would watch over me in that 
<pb n="173"/>  
spirit when departed, and, if so 
it were permitted her, return to me visibly in the watches of the 
night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the 
souls in Paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent 
indications of her presence; sighing upon me in the evening 
winds, or filling the air which I breathed with perfume 
from the censers of the angels.  And with these words upon her 
lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the 
first epoch of my own. 
</p><p>Thus far I have faithfully said.  But as I pass the barrier 
in Time's path formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed 
with the second era of my existence, I feel that a shadow gathers 
over my brain, and I mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. 
But let me on. &mdash;   Years dragged themselves along heavily, and 
still I dwelled within the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass; &mdash; 
but a second change had come upon all things.  The star-shaped 
flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more. 
The tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of 
them, ten by ten, dark eye-like violets that writhed uneasily and 
were ever encumbered with dew.  And Life departed from our paths; 
for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage 
before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all 
the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company.  And the 
golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower 
end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again.  And 
the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of 
Aeolus and more divine than all save the voice of Eleonora, it 
died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, 
until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity 
of its original silence.  And then, lastly the voluminous cloud 
arose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness 
of old, fell back into the regions of Hesper, and took away all 
its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the Valley of the 
Many-Coloured Grass. 
</p><p>Yet the promises of Eleonora were not forgotten; for I heard 
the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and 
streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; 
and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that 
bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct 
murmurs filled often the night air; and once &mdash; oh, but once only! 
I was awakened from a slumber like the slumber of death by the 
pressing of spiritual lips upon my own. 
</p><p>But the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be 
filled. 
<pb n="174"/>  
I longed for the love which had before filled it to 
overflowing.  At length the valley <hi rend="italic">pained</hi> me through 
its memories of Eleonora, and I left it for ever for the vanities 
and the turbulent triumphs of the world. 
 
<lb/>                           * 
 
</p><p>I found myself within a strange city, where all things might 
have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams I had 
dreamed so long in the Valley of the Many-Coloured Grass.  The 
pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangour of 
arms, and the radiant loveliness of woman, bewildered and 
intoxicated my brain.  But as yet my soul had proved true to its 
vows, and the indications of the presence of Eleonora were still 
given me in the silent hours of the night.  Suddenly, these 
manifestations they ceased; and the world grew dark before mine 
eyes; and I stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed &mdash; 
at the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from 
some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the 
king I served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart 
yielded at once &mdash; at whose foot-stool I bowed down without a 
struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. 
What indeed was my passion for the young girl of the valley in 
comparison with the fervour, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which I poured out my whole 
soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal Ermengarde? &mdash;   Oh 
bright was the seraph Ermengarde! and in that knowledge I had 
room for none other. &mdash;   Oh divine was the angel Ermengarde! and 
as I looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes I thought 
only of them &mdash; and <hi rend="italic">of her</hi>. 
</p><p>I wedded; &mdash; nor dreaded the curse I had invoked; and its 
bitterness was not visited upon me.  And once &mdash; but once again in 
the silence of the night, there came through my lattice the soft 
sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into 
familiar and sweet voice, saying: 
</p><p>'Sleep in peace! &mdash; for the Spirit of Love reigneth and 
ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate her who is Ermengarde, 
thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee 
in Heaven, of thy vows unto Eleonora.'
