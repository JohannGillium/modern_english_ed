<head>The Birthday of the Infanta<lb/>  
TO MRS.  WILLIAM H. GRENFELL,<lb/>  
OF TAPLOW COURT</head>  
  
<p>IT was the birthday of the Infanta.  She was just twelve  
years of age, and the sun was shining brightly in the  
gardens of the palace.  
</p><p>Although she was a real Princess and the Infanta of  
Spain, she had only one birthday every year, just like  
the children of quite poor people, so it was naturally a  
matter of great importance to the whole country that  
she should have a really fine day for the occasion.  And  
a really fine day it certainly was.  The tall striped tulips  
stood straight up upon their stalks, like long rows of  
soldiers, and looked defiantly across the grass at the roses,  
and said: "We are quite as splendid as you are now." The  
purple butterflies fluttered about with gold dust on their  
wings, visiting each flower in turn; the little lizards crept  
out of the crevices of the wall and lay basking in the white  
glare; and the pomegranates split and cracked with the  
heat and showed their bleeding red hearts.  Even the pale  
yellow lemons, that hung in such profusion from the  
mouldering trellis and along the dim arcades, seemed  
to have caught a richer colour from the wonderful sunlight,  
and the magnolia trees opened their great globelike  
blossoms of folded ivory and filled the air with a sweet  
heavy perfume.  
</p><p>The little Princess herself walked up and down the  
terrace with her companions and played at hide-and-seek  
round the stone vases and the old moss-grown statues.  On  
ordinary days she was only allowed to play with children  
<pb n="246"/>    
of her own rank, so she had always to play alone,  
but her birthday was an exception, and the King had given  
orders that she was to invite any of her young friends  
whom she liked to come and amuse themselves with her.   
There was a stately grace about these slim Spanish  
children as they glided about, the boys with their large-plumed hats and short fluttering cloaks, the girls holding  
up the trains of their long brocaded gowns and shielding  
the sun from their eyes with huge fans of black and silver.   
But the Infanta was the most graceful of all, and the most  
tastefully attired, after the somewhat cumbrous fashion of  
the day.  Her robe was of grey satin, the skirt and the  
wide puffed sleeves heavily embroidered with silver, and  
the stiff corset studded with rows of fine pearls.  Two  
tiny slippers with big pink rosettes peeped out beneath  
her dress as she walked.  Pink and pearl was her great  
gauze fan, and in her hair, which, like an aureole of faded  
gold, stood out stiffly round her pale little face, she had  
a beautiful white rose.  
</p><p>From a window in the palace the sad melancholy King  
watched them.  Behind him stood his brother, Don Pedro  
of Aragon, whom he hated, and his confessor, the Grand  
Inquisitor of Granada, sat by his side.  Sadder even  
than usual was the King, for as he looked at the Infanta  
bowing with childish gravity to the assembling courtiers,  
or laughing behind her fan at the grim Duchess of Albuquerque  
who always accompanied her, he thought of the  
young Queen, her mother, who but a short time before &mdash;   
so it seemed to him &mdash; had come from the gay country of  
France and had withered away in the sombre splendour of  
the Spanish court, dying just six months after the birth  
of her child, and before she had seen the almonds blossom  
twice in the orchard or plucked the second year's  
fruit from the old gnarled fig-tree that stood in the centre  
of the now grass-grown court-yard.  So great had been  
his love for her that he had not suffered even the grave  
to hide her from him.  She had been embalmed  
by a Moorish physician, who in return for this service  
had been granted his life which for heresy and  
suspicion of magical practices had been already forfeited,  
men said, to the Holy Office, and her body was still lying  
on its tapestried bier in the black marble chapel of the  
<pb n="247"/>    
palace, just as the monks had borne her in on that windy  
March day nearly twelve years before.  Once every month  
the King, wrapped in a dark cloak and with a muffled  
lantern in his hand, went in and knelt by her side, calling  
out, "Mi reina! Mi reina!" and sometimes breaking  
through the formal etiquette that in Spain governs  
every separate action of life and sets limits even to the  
sorrow of a King, he would clutch at the pale jeweled  
hands in a wild agony of grief and try to wake by his  
mad kisses the cold painted face.  
</p><p>To-day he seemed to see her again, as he had seen her  
first at the Castle of Fontainebleau, when he was but  
fifteen years of age, and she still younger.  They had been  
formally betrothed on that occasion by the papal nuncio  
in the presence of the French King and all the Court, and  
he had returned to the Escurial bearing with him a little  
ringlet of yellow hair and the memory of two childish lips  
bending down to kiss his hand as he stepped into his  
carriage.  Later on had followed the marriage, hastily performed  
at Burgos, a small town on the frontier between  
the two countries, and the grand public entry into Madrid  
with the customary celebration of high mass at the Church  
of La Atocha, and a more than usually solemn auto-da-fe, in which nearly three hundred heretics, amongst  
whom were many Englishmen, had been delivered over to  
the secular arm to be burned.  
</p><p>Certainly he had loved her madly, and to the ruin, many  
thought, of his country, then at war with England for the  
possession of the empire of the New World.  He had hardly  
ever permitted her to be out of his sight; for her, he had  
forgotten, or seemed to have forgotten, all grave affairs  
of State; and, with that terrible blindness that passion  
brings upon its servants, he had failed to notice that the  
elaborate ceremonies by which he sought to please her  
did but aggravate the strange malady from which she  
suffered.  When she died he was, for a time, like one bereft  
of reason.  Indeed, there is no doubt but that he would  
have formally abdicated and retired to the great Trappist  
monastery at Granada, of which he was already titular  
Prior, had he not been afraid to leave the little Infanta  
at the mercy of his brother, whose cruelty, even in Spain,  
was notorious, and who was suspected by many of having  
<pb n="248"/>    
caused the Queen's death by means of a pair of poisoned  
gloves that he had presented to her on the occasion of  
her visiting his castle in Aragon.  Even after the expiration  
of the three years of public mourning that he had  
ordained throughout his whole dominions by royal edict,  
he would never suffer his ministers to speak about any new  
alliance and when the Emperor himself sent to him and  
offered him the hand of the lovely Archduchess of Bohemia,  
his niece, in marriage, he bade the ambassadors  
tell their master that the King of Spain was already wedded  
to sorrow, and that though she was but a barren  
bride, he loved her better than beauty &mdash; an answer that  
cost his crown the rich provinces of the Netherlands,  
which soon after, at the Emperor's instigation, revolted  
against him under the leadership of some fanatics of the  
reformed church.  
</p><p>His whole married life, with its fierce, fiery-coloured  
joys and the terrible agony of its sudden ending, seemed  
to come back to him to-day as he watched the Infanta  
playing on the terrace.  She had all the Queen's pretty  
petulance of manner, the same wilful way of tossing her  
head, the same proud, curved, beautiful mouth, the same  
wonderful smile &mdash; vrai sourire de France indeed &mdash; as she  
glanced up now and then at the window, or stretched out  
her little hand for the stately Spanish gentlemen to kiss.  
But the shrill laughter of the children grated on his ears,  
and the bright pitiless sunlight mocked his sorrow, and a  
dull odour of strange spices, spices such as embalmers  
use, seemed to taint &mdash; or was it fancy? &mdash; the clear morning  
air.  He buried his face in his hands, and when the  
Infanta looked up again, the curtains had been drawn  
and the King had retired.  
</p><p>She made a little moue of disappointment and shrugged  
her shoulders.  Surely he might have stayed with her on  
her birthday.  What did the stupid State-affairs matter? Or  
had he gone to that gloomy chapel, where the candles  
were always burning and where she was never allowed to  
enter? How silly of him, when the sun was shining so  
brightly and everybody was so happy! Besides, he would  
miss the sham bull-fight, for which the trumpet was already  
sounding, to say nothing of the puppet-show and  
the other wonderful things.  Her uncle and the Grand Inquisitor  
<pb n="249"/>    
were much more sensible.  They had come out on  
the terrace and paid her nice compliments.  So she tossed  
her pretty head, and taking Don Pedro by the hand, she  
walked slowly down the steps towards a long pavilion of  
purple silk that had been erected at the end of the garden,  
the other children following in strict order of precedence,  
those who had the longest names going first.  
  
</p><p>A PROCESSION of noble boys, fantastically dressed as toreadors,  
came out to meet her, and the young Count of  
Tierra-Nueva, a wonderfully handsome lad of about fourteen  
years of age, uncovering his head with all the grace  
of a born hidalgo and grandee of Spain, led her solemnly  
into a little gilt-and-ivory chair that was placed on a  
raised dais above the arena.  The children grouped themselves  
all round, fluttering their big fans and whispering  
to each other, and Don Pedro and the Grand Inquisitor  
stood laughing at the entrance.  Even the duchess &mdash; the  
Camerera-Mayor as she was called &mdash; a thin, hard-featured  
woman with a yellow ruff, did not look quite so bad-tempered  
as usual, and something like a chill smile flitted  
across her wrinkled face and twitched her thin bloodless  
lips.  
</p><p>It certainly was a marvellous bull-fight, and much nicer,  
the Infanta thought, than the real bull-fight that she had  
been brought to see at Seville, on the occasion of the  
visit of the Duke of Parma to her father.  Some of the  
boys pranced about on richly caparisoned hobby-horses  
brandishing long javelins with gay streamers of bright ribands  
attached to them; others went on foot, waving their  
scarlet cloaks before the bull and vaulting lightly over the  
barrier when he charged them; and as for the bull himself,  
he was just like a live bull, though he was only made  
of wicker-work and stretched hide, and  sometimes insisted  
on running round the arena on his  hind legs, which  
no live bull ever dreams of doing.  He  made a splendid  
fight of it, too, and the children got so  excited that they  
stood up upon the benches, and waved their lace handkerchiefs,  
and  cried out: Bravo toro!  Bravo toro! just  
as sensibly as  if they had been grown-up people.  At  
last, however, after a prolonged combat, during which  
several of the hobby-horses were gored through and  
<pb n="250"/>    
through, and their riders dismounted, the young Count  
of Tierra-Nueva brought the bull to his knees, and having  
obtained permission from the Infanta to give the coup de  
grace, he plunged his wooden sword into the neck of the  
animal with such violence that the head came right  
off and disclosed the laughing face of little Monsieur de  
Lorraine, the son of the French Ambassador at Madrid.  
</p><p>The arena was then cleared amidst much applause, and  
the dead hobby-horses dragged solemnly away by two  
Moorish pages in yellow-and-black liveries, and after a  
short interlude, during which a French posture-master performed  
upon the tight rope, some Italian puppets appeared  
in the semi-classical tragedy of Sophonisba on the stage  
of a small theatre that had been built up for the purpose.   
They acted so well, and their gestures were so extremely  
natural, that at the close of the play the eyes of the  
Infanta were quite dim with tears.  Indeed, some of the  
children really cried, and had to be comforted with sweetmeats,  
and the Grand Inquisitor himself was so affected  
that he could not help saying to Don Pedro that it seemed  
to him intolerable that things made simply out of wood  
and coloured wax, and worked mechanically by wires,  
should be so unhappy and meet with such terrible misfortunes.  
</p><p>An African juggler followed, who brought in a large  
flat basket covered with a red cloth, and having placed  
it in the centre of the arena, he took from his turban  
a curious reed pipe and blew through it.  In a few moments  
the cloth began to move, and as the pipe grew  
shriller and shriller, two green and gold snakes put out  
their strange, wedge-shaped heads and rose slowly up,  
swaying to and fro with the music as a plant sways in the  
water.  The children, however, were rather frightened at  
their spotted hoods and quick darting tongues, and were  
much more pleased when the juggler made a tiny orange-tree grow out of the sand and bear pretty white blossoms  
and clusters of real fruit; and when he took the fan of  
the little daughter of the Marquess de Las-Torres and  
changed it into a blue bird that flew all round the pavilion  
and sang, their delight and amazement knew no  
bounds.  The solemn minuet, too, performed by the dancing  
boys from the church of Nuestra Senora Del Pilar,  
<pb n="251"/>    
was charming.  The Infanta had never before seen this wonderful  
ceremony which takes place every year at May-time in front of the high altar of the Virgin, and in her  
honour; and, indeed, none of the royal family of Spain  
had entered the great cathedral of Saragossa since a mad  
priest, supposed by many to have been in the pay of  
Elizabeth of England, had tried to administer a poisoned  
wafer to the Prince of the Asturias.  So she had known  
only by hearsay of "Our Lady's Dance," as it was called,  
and it certainly was a beautiful sight.  The boys wore old-fashioned court dresses of white velvet, and their curious  
three-cornered hats were fringed with silver and surmounted  
with huge plumes of ostrich feathers, the dazzling  
whiteness of their costumes, as they moved about in the  
sunlight, being still more accentuated by their swarthy  
faces and long black hair.  Everybody was fascinated by the  
grave dignity with which they moved through the intricate  
figures of the dance, and by the elaborate grace of  
their slow gestures and stately bows, and when they had  
finished their performance and doffed their great plumed  
hats to the Infanta, she acknowledged their reverence  
with much courtesy and made a vow that she would send  
a large wax candle to the shrine of Our Lady of Pilar in  
return for the pleasure that she had given her.  
</p><p>A troop of handsome Egyptians &mdash; as the gipsies were  
termed in those days &mdash; then advanced into the arena, and  
sitting down cross-legs, in a circle, began to play softly  
upon their zithers, moving their bodies to the tune and  
humming, almost below their breath, a low dreamy air.   
When they caught sight of Don Pedro, they scowled at  
him, and some of them looked terrified, for only a few  
weeks before he had had two of their tribe hanged for  
sorcery in the market-place at Seville, but the pretty Infanta  
charmed them as she leaned back, peeping over her  
fan with her great blue eyes, and they felt sure that one  
so lovely as she was could never be cruel to anybody.  So  
they played on very gently and just touching the cords  
of the zithers with their long pointed nails, and their heads  
began to nod as though they were falling asleep.  Suddenly,  
with a cry so shrill that all the children were startled  
and Don Pedro's hand clutched at the agate pommel  
of his dagger, they leaped to their feet and whirled madly  
<pb n="252"/>    
round the enclosure, beating their tambourines and  
chaunting some wild love-song in their strange guttural  
language.  Then at another signal they all flung themselves  
again to the ground and lay there quite still, the dull  
strumming of the zithers being the only sound that broke  
the silence.  After they had done this several times, they  
disappeared for a moment and came back leading a brown  
shaggy bear by a chain and carrying on their shoulders  
some little Barbary apes.  The bear stood upon his head  
with the utmost gravity, and the wizened apes played  
all kinds of amusing tricks with two gipsy boys who  
seemed to be their masters, and fought with tiny swords,  
and fired off guns, and went through a regular soldier's  
drill just like the King's own bodyguard.  In fact, the gipsies  
were a great success.  
</p><p>But the funniest part of the whole morning's entertainment  
was undoubtedly the dancing of the little dwarf.   
When he stumbled into the arena, waddling on his crooked  
legs and wagging his huge misshapen head from side to  
side, the children went off into a loud shout of delight,  
and the Infanta herself laughed so much that the Camerera  
was obliged to remind her that although there were  
many precedents in Spain for a King's daughter weeping  
before her equals, there were none for a Princess of the  
blood royal making so merry before those who were her  
inferiors in birth.  The dwarf, however, was really quite  
irresistible, and even at the Spanish Court, always noted  
for its cultivated passion for the horrible, so fantastic a  
little monster had never been seen.  It was his first appearance,  
too.  He had been discovered only the day before,  
running wild through the forest, by two of the nobles  
who happened to have been hunting in a remote part of  
the great cork-wood that surrounded the town, and had  
been carried off by them to the palace as a surprise for  
the Infanta &mdash; his father, who was a poor charcoal-burner,  
being but too well pleased to get rid of so ugly and useless  
a child.  Perhaps the most amusing thing about him was  
his complete unconsciousness of his own grotesque appearance.  
Indeed, he seemed quite happy and full of the  
highest spirits.  When the children laughed, he laughed as  
freely and as joyously as any of them, and at the close  
of each dance he made them each the funniest of bows,  
<pb n="253"/>    
smiling and nodding at them just as if he were really one  
of themselves, and not a little misshapen thing that Nature,  
in some humourous mood, had fashioned for others  
to mock at.  As for the Infanta, she absolutely fascinated  
him.  He could not keep his eyes off her, and seemed to  
dance for her alone, and when at the close of the performance,  
remembering how she had seen the great ladies  
of the Court throw bouquets to Caffarelli the famous  
Italian treble, whom the Pope had sent from his own  
chapel to Madrid that he might cure the King's melancholy  
by the sweetness of his voice, she took out of her  
hair the beautiful white rose, and partly for a jest and  
partly to tease the Camerera, threw it to him across the  
arena with her sweetest smile, he took the whole matter  
quite seriously, and pressing the flower to his rough  
coarse lips, he put his hand upon his heart and sank on  
one knee before her, grinning from ear to ear and with  
his little bright eyes sparkling with pleasure.  
</p><p>This so upset the gravity of the Infanta that she kept  
on laughing long after the little dwarf had run out of the  
arena, and expressed a desire to her uncle that the dance  
should be immediately repeated.  The Camerera, however,  
on the plea that the sun was too hot, decided that it would  
be better that her Highness should return without delay  
to the palace, where a wonderful feast had been already  
prepared for her, including a real birthday cake with her  
own initials worked all over it in painted sugar and a  
lovely silver flag waving from the top.  The Infanta accordingly  
rose up with much dignity, and having given orders  
that the little dwarf was to dance again for her after the  
hour of siesta, and conveyed her thanks to the young  
Count of Tierra-Nueva for his charming reception, she  
went back to her apartments, the children following in the  
same order in which they had entered.  
  
</p><p>NOW when the little dwarf heard that he was to dance  
a second time before the Infanta, and by her own express  
command, he was so proud that he ran out into  
the garden, kissing the white rose in an absurd ecstasy of  
pleasure and making the most uncouth and clumsy gestures  
of delight.  
</p><p>The flowers were quite indignant at his daring to intrude  
<pb n="254"/>    
into their beautiful home, and when they saw him  
capering up and down the walks and waving his arms  
above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could  
not restrain their feelings any longer.  
</p><p>"He is really far too ugly to be allowed to play in any  
place where we are," cried the tulips.  
</p><p>"He should drink poppy-juice and go to sleep for a  
thousand years," said the great scarlet lilies, and they  
grew quite hot and angry.  
</p><p>"He is a perfect horror!" screamed the cactus.  "Why,  
he is twisted and stumpy, and his head is completely out  
of proportion with his legs.  Really, he makes me feel  
prickly all over, and if he comes near me, I will sting  
him with my thorns."  
</p><p>"And he has actually got one of my best blooms," exclaimed  
the white rose-tree.  "I gave it to the Infanta  
this morning myself, as a birthday present, and he has  
stolen it from her." And she called out "Thief, thief,  
thief!" at the top of her voice.  
</p><p>Even the red geraniums, who did not usually give themselves  
airs, and were known to have a great many poor  
relations themselves, curled up in disgust when they saw  
him, and when the violets meekly remarked that though  
he was certainly extremely plain, still he could not help  
it, they retorted with a good deal of justice that that was  
his chief defect, and that there was no reason why one  
should admire a person because he was incurable; and,  
indeed, some of the violets themselves felt that the ugliness  
of the little dwarf was almost ostentatious, and that  
he would have shown much better taste if he had looked  
sad, or at least pensive, instead of jumping about merrily  
and throwing himself into such grotesque and silly attitudes.  
</p><p>As for the old sun-dial, who was an extremely remarkable  
individual, and had once told the time of day to no  
less a person than the Emperor Charles V himself, he  
was so taken aback by the little dwarf's appearance that  
he almost forgot to mark two whole minutes with his long  
shadowy finger, and could not help saying to the great  
milk-white peacock, who was sunning herself on the  
balustrade, that everyone knew that the children of kings  
were kings, and that the children of charcoal-burners were  
<pb n="255"/>    
charcoal-burners, and that it was absurd to pretend that  
it wasn't so; a statement with which the peacock entirely  
agreed, and indeed screamed out, "Certainly, certainly,"  
in such a loud, harsh voice, that the gold-fish who lived in  
the basin of the cool splashing fountain put their heads  
out of the water and asked the huge stone tritons what on  
earth was the matter.  
</p><p>But somehow the birds liked him.  They had seen him  
often in the forest, dancing about like an elf after the  
eddying leaves, or crouched up in the hollow of some  
old oak-tree, sharing his nuts with the squirrels.  They did  
not mind his being ugly, a bit.  Why, even the nightingale  
herself, who sang so sweetly in the orange groves at  
night that sometimes the moon leaned down to listen, was  
not much to look at after all; and besides, he had been  
kind to them, and during that terribly bitter winter, when  
there were no berries on the trees, and the ground was  
as hard as iron, and the wolves had come down to the  
very gates of the city to look for food, he had never once  
forgotten them, but had always given them crumbs out  
of his little hunch of black bread and divided with them  
whatever poor breakfast he had.  
</p><p>So they flew round and round him, just touching his  
cheek with their wings as they passed, and chattered to  
each other, and the little dwarf was so pleased that he  
could not help showing them the beautiful white rose and  
telling them that the Infanta herself had given it to him  
because she loved him.  
</p><p>They did not understand a single word of what he was  
saying, but that made no matter, for they put their heads  
on one side and looked wise, which is quite as good as  
understanding a thing and very much easier.  
</p><p>The lizards also took an immense fancy to him, and  
when he grew tired of running about and flung himself  
down on the grass to rest, they played and romped all  
over him, and tried to amuse him in the best way they  
could.  "Every one cannot be as beautiful as a lizard,"  
they cried; "that would be too much to expect.  And,  
though it sounds absurd to say so, he is really not so  
ugly after all &mdash; provided, of course, that one shuts one's  
eyes and does not look at him." The lizards were extremely  
philosophical by nature, and often sat thinking for  
<pb n="256"/>    
hours and hours together, when there was nothing else to  
do, or when the weather was too rainy for them to go out.  
</p><p>The flowers, however, were excessively annoyed at  
their behaviour and at the behaviour of the birds.  "It only  
shows," they said, "what a vulgarizing effect this incessant  
rushing and flying about has.  Well-bred people always stay  
exactly in the same place, as we do.  No one ever saw  
us hopping up and down the walks, or galloping madly  
through the grass after dragon-flies.  When we do want  
change of air, we send for the gardener, and he carries  
us to another bed.  This is dignified, and as it should be.   
But birds and lizards have no sense of repose; and, indeed,  
birds have not even a permanent address.  They  
are mere vagrants like the gipsies, and should be treated  
in exactly the same manner." So they put their noses in  
the air, and looked very haughty, and were quite delighted  
when after some time they saw the little dwarf scramble  
up from the grass and make his way across the terrace  
to the palace.  
</p><p>"He should certainly be kept indoors for the rest of  
his natural life," they said.  "Look at his hunched back  
and his crooked legs," and they began to titter.  
</p><p>But the little dwarf knew nothing of all this.  He liked  
the birds and the lizards immensely, and thought that the  
flowers were the most marvellous things in the whole  
world, except of course the Infanta, but then she had  
given him the beautiful white rose, and she loved him, and  
that made a great difference.  How he wished that he had  
gone back with her! She would have put him on her right  
hand, and smiled at him, and he would have never left  
her side, but would have made her his playmate, and  
taught her all kinds of delightful tricks.  For though he had  
never been in a palace before, he knew a great many  
wonderful things.  He could make little cages out of rushes  
for the grasshoppers to sing in, and fashion the long-jointed bamboo into the pipe that Pan loves to hear.  He  
knew the cry of every bird, and could call the starlings  
from the tree-top, or the heron from the mere.  He  
knew the trail of every animal, and could track the hare  
by its delicate footprints and the boar by the trampled  
leaves.  All the wind-dances he knew, the mad dance in  
red raiment with the autumn, the light dance in blue  
<pb n="257"/>    
sandals over the corn, the dance with white snow-wreaths  
in winter, and the blossom-dance through the orchards in  
spring.  He knew where the wood-pigeons built their nests,  
and once when a fowler had snared the parent birds, he  
had brought up the young ones himself and had built a  
little dove-cot for them in the cleft of a pollard elm.  They  
were quite tame, and used to feed out of his hands every  
morning.  She would like them, and the rabbits that scurried  
about in the long fern, and the jays with their steely  
feathers and black bills, and the hedgehogs that could  
curl themselves up into prickly balls, and the great wise  
tortoises that crawled slowly about, shaking their heads  
and nibbling at the young leaves.  Yes, she must certainly  
come to the forest and play with him.  He would give her  
his own little bed, and would watch outside the window  
till dawn, to see that the wild horned cattle did not harm  
her, nor the gaunt wolves creep too near the hut.  And  
at dawn he would tap at the shutters and wake her, and  
they would go out and dance together all the day long.   
It was really not a bit lonely in the forest.  Sometimes a  
bishop rode through on his white mule, reading out of a  
painted book.  Sometimes in their green velvet caps and  
their jerkins of tanned deerskin, the falconers passed by,  
with hooded hawks on their wrists.  At vintage time came  
the grape-treaders, with purple hands and feet, wreathed  
with glossy ivy and carrying dripping skins of wine; and  
the charcoal-burners sat round their huge braziers at  
night, watching the dry logs charring slowly in the fire  
and roasting chestnuts in the ashes, and the robbers came  
out of their caves and made merry with them.  Once,  
too, he had seen a beautiful procession winding up the  
long dusty road to Toledo.  The monks went in front, singing  
sweetly and carrying bright banners and crosses of  
gold, and then, in silver armour, with matchlocks and  
pikes, came the soldiers, and in their midst walked three  
barefoot men, in strange yellow dresses painted all over  
with wonderful figures, and carrying lighted candles in  
their hands.  Certainly, there was a great deal to look at  
in the forest, and when she was tired he would find a soft  
bank of moss for her, or carry her in his arms, for he  
was very strong, though he knew that he was not tall.   
He would make her a necklace of red bryony berries  
<pb n="258"/>    
that would be quite as pretty as the white berries that she  
wore on her dress, and when she was tired of them, she  
could throw them away, and he would find her others.   
He would bring her acorn-cups, and dew-drenched anemones,  
and tiny glow-worms to be stars in the pale gold  
of her hair.  
  
</p><p>BUT where was she? He asked the white rose, and it  
made him no answer.  The whole palace seemed asleep,  
and even where the shutters had not been closed, heavy  
curtains had been drawn across the windows to keep out  
the glare.  He wandered all round looking for some place  
through which he might gain an entrance, and at last he  
caught sight of a little private door that was lying open.   
He slipped through and found himself in a splendid hall,  
far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was  
so much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was  
made of great coloured stones, fitted together into a sort  
of geometrical pattern.  But the little Infanta was not there  
 &mdash; only some wonderful white statues that looked down on  
him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and  
strangely smiling lips.  
</p><p>At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain  
of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the  
King's favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he  
loved best.  Perhaps she was hiding behind that? He  
would try, at any rate.  
</p><p>So he stole quietly across and drew it aside.  No; there  
was only another room, though a prettier room, he  
thought, than the one he had just left.  The walls were  
hung with a many-figured green arras of needle-wrought  
tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish  
artists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.  
It had once been the chamber of Jean le Fou,  
as he was called, that mad king who was so enamoured  
of the chase that he had often tried in his delirium to  
mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the  
stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding  
his hunting horn and stabbing with his dagger at the pale  
flying deer.  It was now used as the council-room, and on  
the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the ministers,  
<pb n="259"/>    
stamped with the gold tulips of Spain and with the  
arms and emblems of the house of Hapsburg.  
</p><p>The little dwarf looked in wonder all round him and  
was half-afraid to go on.  The strange silent horsemen who  
galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making  
any noise seemed to him like those terrible phantoms  
of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking &mdash;   
the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet  
a man, turn him into a hind and chase him.  But he  
thought of the pretty Infanta and took courage.  He wanted  
to find her alone and to tell her that he, too, loved her.   
Perhaps she was in the room beyond.  
</p><p>He ran across the soft Moorish carpets and opened  
the door.  No! She was not here either.  The room was  
quite empty.  
</p><p>It was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign  
ambassadors, when the King &mdash; which of late had not been  
often &mdash; consented to give them a personal audience; the  
same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared  
from England to make arrangements for the marriage  
of their Queen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns  
of Europe, with the Emperor's eldest son.  The hangings  
were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier  
with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down  
from the black-and-white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy  
of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile  
were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself,  
covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver  
tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On  
the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver  
tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the  
canopy, stood the chair for the papal nuncio, who alone  
had the right to be seated in the King's presence on the  
occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose cardinal's  
hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple  
tabouret in front.  On the wall, facing the throne, hung a  
life-sized portrait of Charles V in hunting dress, with a  
great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Phillip II receiving  
the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre  
of the other wall.  Between the windows stood a black  
ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the  
<pb n="260"/>    
figures from Holbein's Dance of Death had been graved  
 &mdash; by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.  
</p><p>But the little dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  
He would not have given his rose for all the pearls  
on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the  
throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the Infanta before  
she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to  
come away with him when he had finished his dance.   
Here, in the palace, the air was close and heavy, but in  
the forest the wind blew free and the sunlight with wandering  
hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside.   
There were flowers, too, in the forest; not so splendid,  
perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly  
scented for all that &mdash; hyacinths in early spring that  
flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and grassy  
knolls, yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round  
the gnarled roots of the oak trees, bright celandine, and  
blue speedwell, and irises lilac and gold.  There were grey  
catkins on the hazels, and the fox-gloves drooped with  
the weight of their dappled, bee-haunted cells.  The chestnut  
had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its  
pallid moons of beauty.  Yes: surely she would come  
if he could only find her! She would come with him to  
the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her  
delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he  
passed into the next room.  
</p><p>Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most  
beautiful.  The walls were covered with a pink-flowered  
Lucca damask, patterned with birds and dotted with  
dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of massive  
silver, festooned with florid wreaths and swinging Cupids;  
in front of the two large fire-places stood great screens  
broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the floor, which  
was of sea-green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into  
the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under the  
shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room,  
he saw a little figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a  
cry of joy broke from his lips, and he moved out into the  
sunlight.  As he did so, the figure moved out also, and he  
saw it plainly.  
</p><p>The Infanta! It was a monster, the most grotesque monster  
he had ever beheld.  Not properly shaped, as all other  
<pb n="261"/>    
people were, but hunchbacked, and crooked-limbed, with  
huge lolling head and mane of black hair.  The little dwarf  
frowned, and the monster frowned also.  He laughed, and  
it laughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just  
as he himself was doing.  He made it a mocking bow,  
and it returned him a low reverence.  He went towards it,  
and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made  
and stopping when he stopped himself.  He shouted with  
amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand,  
and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as  
cold as ice.  He grew afraid, and moved his hand across,  
and the monster's hand followed it quickly.  He tried to  
press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.   
The face of the monster was now close to his own,  
and seemed full of terror.  He brushed his hair off his  
eyes.  It imitated him.  He struck at it, and it returned  
blow for blow.  He loathed it, and it made hideous faces  
at him.  He drew back, and it retreated.  
</p><p>What is it? He thought for a moment, and looked  
round at the rest of the room.  It was strange, but everything  
seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of  
clear water.  Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and  
couch for couch.  The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove  
by the doorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and  
the silver Venus that stood in the sunlight held out her  
arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.  
</p><p>Was it Echo? He had called to her once in the valley,  
and she had answered him word for word.  Could she  
mock the eye, as she mocked the voice? Could she make  
a mimic world just like the real world? Could the shadows  
of things have colour and life and movement? Could  
it be that &mdash; ?  
</p><p>He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful  
white rose, he turned round and kissed it.  The monster  
had a rose of its own, petal for petal the same! It kissed  
it with like kisses, and pressed it to its heart with horrible  
gestures.  
</p><p>When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry  
of despair and fell sobbing to the ground.  So it  
was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked, foul to  
look at and grotesque.  He himself was the monster, and  
<pb n="262"/>    
it was at him that all the children had been laughing, and  
the little Princess who he had thought loved him &mdash; she too  
had been merely mocking at his ugliness and making  
merry over his twisted limbs.  Why had they not left him  
in the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how  
loathsome he was? Why had his father not killed him,  
rather than sell him to his shame? The hot tears poured  
down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces.  
</p><p>The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered  
the faint petals in the air.  It grovelled on the ground,  
and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face  
drawn with pain.  He crept away, lest he should see it, and  
covered his eyes with his hands.  He crawled, like some  
wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.  
</p><p>And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her  
companions through the open window, and when they saw  
the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the  
floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and  
exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy  
laughter, and stood all round him and watched him.  
</p><p>"His dancing was funny," said the Infanta; "but his acting  
is funnier still.  Indeed he is almost as good as the  
puppets, only of course not quite so natural." And she  
fluttered her big fan and applauded.  
</p><p>But the little dwarf never looked up, and his sobs  
grew fainter and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious  
gasp and clutched his side.  And then he fell back again,  
and lay quite still.  
</p><p>"That is capital," said the Infanta, after a pause; "but  
now you must dance for me."  
</p><p>"Yes," cried all the children, "you must get up and  
dance, for you are as clever as the Barbary apes, and  
much more ridiculous."  
</p><p>But the little dwarf made no answer.  
</p><p>And the Infanta stamped her foot and called out to  
her uncle, who was walking on the terrace with the chamberlain,  
reading some dispatches that had just arrived  
from Mexico where the Holy Office had recently been established.  
"My funny little dwarf is sulking," she cried,  
"you must wake him up and tell him to dance for me."  
</p><p>They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don  
Pedro stooped down and slapped the dwarf on the cheek  
<pb n="263"/>    
with his embroidered glove.  "You must dance," he said,  
"petit monstre.  You must dance.  The Infanta of Spain and  
the Indies wishes to be amused."  
But the little dwarf never moved.  
</p><p>"A whipping master should be sent for," said Don  
Pedro wearily, and he went back to the terrace.  But the  
chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt beside the little  
dwarf and put his hand upon his heart.  And after a few  
moments, he shrugged his shoulders and rose up, and having  
made a low bow to the Infanta, he said:  
</p><p>"Mi bella Princesa, your funny little dwarf will never  
dance again.  It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might  
have made the King smile."  
</p><p>"But why will he not dance again?" asked the Infanta,  
laughing.  
</p><p>"Because his heart is broken," answered the chamberlain.  
</p><p>And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty, rose-leaf lips  
curled in pretty disdain.  "For the future let those who  
come to play with me have no hearts," she cried, and she  
ran out into the garden.
