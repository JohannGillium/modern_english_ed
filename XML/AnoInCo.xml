				<head>THE INDIAN OF COMMERCE. </head>

				<p>For purposes of literary classification, all Indians may be divided, quite
					regardless of linguistic affinities, into three sole tribes&mdash;the human,
					the inhuman, and the super-human. There is the actual aborigine, interesting to
					competent fiction as to science because he is a man and at the same time a
					living archive from the childhood of the race. There is the wooden eikon which
					stands for questionable cigars or unquestionable penny-a-lining&mdash;in
					either case a mere peg upon which to hang commercial profit. And there is also
					the Red Man of Rhapsody&mdash;a conveniently distant fiction to carry
					heroics which would seem rather too absurd if fathered upon poor human nature as
					we see it next door. With the last-mentioned tribe deals one of the handsomest
					and one of the most preposterous books of the season, 'A Child of the Sun,' by
					Charles Eugene Banks (Stone). Brilliant as a parrot in mechanical coloration,
					the text also seems to have undergone some mental "three-color process."
					Fenimore Cooper was cold ethnography to this, and even Prescott's Empire of
					Montezuma quite as true to life. There is nothing Indian in these pages, except
					the good intention. A curbstone version of the "legend" of the Piasau serves for
					warp; and into it the author has woven a truly curious fabric of girl-graduate
					mundiloquence and scope. Nominally in prose, the book is in fact very largely
					couched in wilful and poor Hiawathan measure, doubly cheap by being masked in
					"long type." Perhaps the most diagrammatic comment on the quality of the volume
					is in its own exemplary lines about "Pakoble," belle of the "Arctide" tribe, who
					was "so perfect in beauty that the artists of the Arctides often begged the
					favor of her time, that they might preserve her loveliness to future
					generations." It must be said that the fifteen "color-type" illustrations, by
					Louis Betts, are far and away above their company and their sort. Of no value as
					racial types, they are very uncommonly attractive and sympathetic, and not
					without a touch of real poetry in conception as well as in color-scheme. Its
					whole dress would befit a worthier volume. </p>
				<p>In boards and "bleating buckskin" (born sheep) and of a cover design grateful to
					the aesthetic if not to the scientific eye, 'An Alphabet of Indians' (Russell)
					is a <pb n="320"/> posthumous collection from Emery Leverett Williams. The
					twenty-six folio-page drawings, bluntly posteresque, are not ill-done in their
					sort. As to verisimilitude, however, they are much closer to the alphabet than
					to the Indian&mdash;as doubtless should be expected of diversions in this
					category, under which the dragon's teeth of Cadmus come up, with the
					processional years, as Brownies, Gibson-Girls, Pickaninnies, Wild Animals I Have
					Guessed At, and so on. It is a special altruism of the alphabet that it
					furnishes more or less pretext for just about the largest number of drawings
					that may safely be marketed at once. All twenty-five of the tribes here
					compulsorily foregathered look much more like one another than like themselves,
					and the ethnic differentiation of them would be hopeless but for the convenient
					lettering. The alternate pages of text are wholly commonplace, and very largely
					misleading&mdash;thanks, chiefly, to an apparent system of attributing
					traits, heard-of as "Indian," to the tribe whose page chances to have most space
					left. "Travvis poles," and jackrabbits that burrow, are among the contributions
					to knowledge here presented. Children, at whom the book is seemingly levelled,
					will find no special thrill in its pictures, and no competent information
					whatever in its letterpress. </p>
				<p>George Bird Grinnell's 'Jack among the Indians' is a boy's book, in which
					interest must derive from no special magnetism or impulse of the author, but
					from his peculiarly matter-of-fact habit of narration, as of a real happening in
					settings as familiar to him as attractive to all boys. This is not necessarily
					dispraise. Like Mr. Grinnell's more serious work, this tale is an unimaginative,
					every-day presentment of Western and Indian themes by a man who has a very
					unusual practical familiarity with both. </p>
				<p>Amid the perennial output of books which might in fact just as well be about any
					other topic whatever, but, for considerations of the market, are anilined with a
					weak suffusion of Indian, it is a grateful pleasure to commend Albert Ernest
					Jenks's honest and unpretentious story of 'The Childhood of Ji-Shib, the
					Ojibwa.' It is for "popular" consumption, but Dr. Jenks's technical paper on
					"The Wild Rice Gatherers of the Upper Lakes" gave us reason to expect the
					accuracy we find here. Without special literary grace, beyond its directness and
					homely intuition, the little book is workmanlike, interesting, and informative.
					It will appeal to unspoiled children of any age, and will repay their interest
					with principle. The author's decorations can hardly be said to better the page.
					Nor does Professor McGee's introduction add to the accuracy of a generally
					reliable book, with his gloss upon "the Red Man" and the "Red child." Our
					aborigines are brown. A veritable "Red Indian" would be as much a treasure for
					any museum as a marked man among his people. With much more creditable
					observation, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> calls <hi rend="italic">us</hi> "red." </p>
				<p>For reasons not particularly obscure, our generic Indian policy seems not only
					not to stimulate, but in fact to strangle, the individual and potential
					mentality which all first-hand students have detected in our American aborigine.
					Politically denied the civic status and responsibility which should develop him;
					submerged in an interminable tutelage which is devised rather for the tutor's
					convenience than for the ward's betterment, and has no logical plan of majority;
					bound down to a scheme of "education" which is almost exclusively materialistic,
					it is small wonder that he has failed to give us a literature which should have
					been fascinating and precious almost beyond compare&mdash;the unadulterated
					expression of a people clear-thinking, unsophisticated, far nearer to nature
					than we may ever again come, and of opportunity for a valuable connotation of
					our own history. That which should have been the foreword of any real conspectus
					of "American Literature," the word of the First Americans, has somewhere been
					smothered in our processes. The great Government print-factory schools turn out
					still faster their bolts of human calico, and in more unvarying patterns of
					mediocrity. With another generation, the literal aboriginal mind, with all its
					value of originality, individuality, and nearness to the unsophisticated fact,
					will have disappeared. There will be Indians no longer, but smatters of "white
					men" under a brown complexion. We have somewhere, somehow, wasted our chance to
					bring out one of the most significant, instructive, and delightful members
					American scholarship might have had&mdash;the classics of the First
					Americans. And this is strange, for a consciously superior nation. We have thus
					far developed nothing to rival, nor even fairly to suggest, that astonishing
					"school" of American Indian poets, essayists, theologues, and historians evolved
					and nurtured by Spanish rule in Mexico, Peru, and other American colonies, more
					than three hundred years ago. The poetry, the oratory, the simple but adequate
					philosophy, of our own tribes, have been clearly enough vouched for, and more or
					less competently recorded, by our students of their folklore, their ethnology,
					and their history&mdash;but why not by themselves? Why have we had no
					Tezozomoc, no Camargo, no Diego Duran, no Salcamayhun, no Ixtilixochitls, to
					give us American history from the side of the invaded? Why not even a Garcilaso
					de la Vega, whose notorious 'Comentarios Reales' and 'Florida del Inca' are
					quite as scientific and sober history as much that still sells enormously among
					us in three-volume editions; whose sixteenth-century ethnology is still
					unconfessedly followed in very many pretentious works; and whose rare and hardly
					known little volume of poems (1581) is as saturated a solution of Virgil as the
					best Harvard undergraduate of them all could write now if he tried? </p>
				<p>The answer is, of course, that our Government plan of Indian education is neither
					devised nor operated by poets and historians, nor yet aimed at producing them.
					It has devolved some Indian police, some Rough Riders amenable to Rooseveltian
					discipline, several very tolerable brass-bands, and foot-ball teams much more
					than tolerable. But these are its jewels. Its average output is of cobblers,
					tinkers, typesetters, and the like, who can have no livelihood if they go home
					to their nomad fathers, and who presently will be "looked after" by the labor
					unions if they presume to practise these industries in competition with
					"Americans." Also, farm hands&mdash;not at all farmers, for they are taught
					by non-farmers, mostly, and in every event taught the tenets which are not only
					useless but prejudicial when applied to the unlike climatic conditions where
					their tribal lands are situated. Most vital of all, as a smotherer of human
					development, our system takes the Indian child away from home (confessedly, the
					farther the better), for more convenience of the instructor, and teaches him not
					only without, but practically against, the filial and human affections. In
					effect, the Indian home figures in this plan simply as a potential breeder of
					more pupils&mdash;who must, however, be taught, with more or less brutal
					directness, to despise their parents, and who are forced to abandon any language
					in which they might converse with those parents. The vital wisdom of the old
					plan, perhaps unformulated, but so basic that its common-sense humanity atoned
					for and outweighed the feudal and ecclesiastic coloration, was that it taught
					and uplifted the home and the child at the same time. If the child must learn
					Spanish, so did his parents. He was still able to talk with his
					mother&mdash;and now in two languages. It is notorious that in our scheme
					many children are sent home unable to speak to or understand their mothers in
					any tongue whatever. There was in the old r&eacute;gime a certain devout
					patience (lacking in ours) which did not have to extinguish the native tongue to
					teach the new one. Under that mediaeval system, the pupil was part of the family
					and part of the State; not a mere unit of raw material for a machine-tender to
					"work up" on salary. </p>
				<p>Yet now and then, by sheer character, an Indian does rise superior to our
					Governmental planing-machine&mdash;not because of our system, but in its
					direct despite. For instance, it is notorious that the remarkable papers of
					Zitkala-Sa in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic</hi> brought down upon her head an
					avalanche of instructorial wrath&mdash; most of it in ludicrous rhetorical
					contrast to her clean and high-minded style. Yet those papers were true and of
					serious value, as field students know, and from the merely literary viewpoint
					had an uncommon quality and a humanity as unsullied and refreshing as a mountain
					brook. </p>
				<p>Entirely different, but of no less significance, is 'The Middle Five,' by Francis
					la Flesche, son of the Omaha chief E-Sta-ma-za, and well known to students by
					his collaboration with Miss Fletcher upon the folklore and songs of his people.
					It is an unaffected, admirably human, story of Indian boyhood at
					school&mdash;a modest Omaha 'Tom Brown'; charming because so real and
					unconscious a human document; valuable because so literal a transcript of the
					aboriginal mind. In the introduction, Mr. La Flesche says, in the quietest way,
					many things whose apparently innocent sarcasm will doubtless be least felt by
					those who are most in need of it. The frontispiece, a sympathetic drawing in
					colors, adds to the virtue of the book, for it is by a young Indian girl
					striving against mostly objective odds to make a living as an American
					illustrator, Miss Angel de Cora. Thoroughly likable for its own sake, this
					little volume must have its place with libraries and students as one of the very
					few, and one of the most considerable, literary productions of our conterminous
					American Indian. </p>
