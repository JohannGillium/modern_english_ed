</head>
<p>

<hi rend="italic">Rev. Deodat Lawson had served as minister at Salem Village from 1684
to 1688. Upon hearing about the witchcraft outbreak in the village and
that several members of his family may have previously died there under
"the malicious operations of the infernal powers," Lawson decided to
visit his former abode to learn what was happening. Lawson's
observations during the latter part of March and the first of April were
subsequently written into a 10-page pamphlet titled</hi> A Brief and True
Narrative <hi rend="italic">and printed by Benjamin Harris of Boston. These short
though tantalizing descriptions give a broader perspective than many of
the surviving court records.</hi>

</p><p> On the Nineteenth day of March last I went to Salem Village, and
lodged at Nathaniel Ingersols near to the Minister Mr. P[arris]'s house,
and presently after, I came into my Lodging Capt. Walcuts Daughter Mary
came to Lieut.  Ingersols and spake to me, but, suddenly after as she
stood by the door, was bitten, so that she cried out of her Wrist, and
looking on it with a Candle, we saw apparently the marks of Teeth both
upper and lower set, on each side of her wrist.

</p><p> In the beginning of the Evening, I went to give Mr. P. a visit.
When I was there, his Kins-woman, Abigail Williams, (about 12 years of
age,) had a grievous fit; she was at first hurryed with Violence to and
fro in the room; (though Mrs. Ingersol endeavoured to hold her,)
sometimes makeing as if she would fly, stretching up her arms as high as
she could, and crying "Whish, Whish, Whish!" several times; Presently
after she said there was Goodw N[urse]. and said, "Do you not see her?
Why there she stands!" And the said Goodw. N. offered her The Book, but
she was resolved she would not take it, saying Often, "I wont, I wont, I
wont, take it, I do not know what Book it is: I am sure it is none of
Gods Book, it is the Divels Book, for ought I know." After that, she run
to the Fire, and begun to throw Fire Brands, about the house; and run
against the Back, as if she would run up Chimney, and, as they said, she
had attempted to go into the Fire in other Fits.  </p>
