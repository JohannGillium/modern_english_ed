Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences</head>

Martin Luther 
</p> 
<p> 
<date value="1517-10-31">October 31, 1517</date> 
</p> 
<p> 
Out of love for the truth and the desire to bring it to light, 
the following propositions will be discussed at Wittenberg, 
under the presidency of the Reverend Father Martin Luther, 
Master of Arts and of Sacred Theology, and Lecturer in 
Ordinary on the same at that place. Wherefore he requests that 
those who are unable to be present and debate orally with us, 
may do so by letter. 
</p> 
<p> 
In the Name our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. 
</p> 
</div2> 
<div2 type="decree" id="d5"> 
 
<p> 
1.  When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, "Repent" (Mt 4:17), he willed 
 the entire life of believers to be one of repentance. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
2.  This word cannot be understood as referring to the sacrament of penance, 
 that is, confession and satisfaction, as administered by the clergy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
3.  Yet it does not mean solely inner repentance; such inner repentance is 
 worthless unless it produces various outward mortification of the flesh. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
4.  The penalty of sin remains as long as the hatred of self (that is, true 
 inner repentance), namely till our entrance into the kingdom of heaven. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
5.  The pope neither desires nor is able to remit any penalties except those 
 imposed by his own authority or that of the canons. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
6.  The pope cannot remit any guilt, except by declaring and showing that it 
 has been remitted by God; or, to be sure, by remitting guilt in cases 
reserved 
 to his judgment.  If his right to grant remission in these cases were 
 disregarded, the guilt would certainly remain unforgiven. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
7.  God remits guilt to no one unless at the same time he humbles him in all 
 things and makes him submissive to the vicar, the priest. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
8.  The penitential canons are imposed only on the living, and, according to 
 the canons themselves, nothing should be imposed on the dying. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
9.  Therefore the Holy Spirit through the pope is kind to us insofar as the 
 pope in his decrees always makes exception of the article of death and of 
 necessity. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
10.  Those priests act ignorantly and wickedly who, in the case of the dying, 
 reserve canonical penalties for purgatory. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
11.  Those tares of changing the canonical penalty to the penalty of purgatory 
 were evidently sown while the bishops slept (Mt 13:25). 
</p> 
 
<p> 
12.  In former times canonical penalties were imposed, not after, but before 
 absolution, as tests of true contrition. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
13.  The dying are freed by death from all penalties, are already dead as far 
 as the canon laws are concerned, and have a right to be released from them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
14.  Imperfect piety or love on the part of the dying person necessarily 
 brings with it great fear; and the smaller the love, the greater the fear. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
15.  This fear or horror is sufficient in itself, to say nothing of other 
 things, to constitute the penalty of purgatory, since it is very near to the 
 horror of despair. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
16.  Hell, purgatory, and heaven seem to differ the same as despair, fear, and 
 assurance of salvation. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
17.  It seems as though for the souls in purgatory fear should necessarily 
 decrease and love increase. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
18.  Furthermore, it does not seem proved, either by reason or by Scripture, 
 that souls in purgatory are outside the state of merit, that is, unable to 
 grow in love. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
19.  Nor does it seem proved that souls in purgatory, at least not all of 
 them, are certain and assured of their own salvation, even if we ourselves 
may be entirely certain of it. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
20.  Therefore the pope, when he uses the words "plenary remission of all 
 penalties," does not actually mean "all penalties," but only those imposed by 
 himself. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
21.  Thus those indulgence preachers are in error who say that a man is 
 absolved from every penalty and saved by papal indulgences. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
22.  As a matter of fact, the pope remits to souls in purgatory no penalty 
 which, according to canon law, they should have paid in this life. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
23.  If remission of all penalties whatsoever could be granted to anyone at 
 all, certainly it would be granted only to the most perfect, that is, to very 
 few. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
24.  For this reason most people are necessarily deceived by that 
 indiscriminate and high-sounding promise of release from penalty. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
25.  That power which the pope has in general over purgatory corresponds to 
 the power which any bishop or curate has in a particular way in his own 
 diocese and parish. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
26.  The pope does very well when he grants remission to souls in purgatory, 
 not by the power of the keys, which he does not have, but by way of 
 intercession for them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
27.  They preach only human doctrines who say that as soon as the money clinks 
 into the money chest, the soul flies out of purgatory. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
28.  It is certain that when money clinks in the money chest, greed and 
 avarice can be increased; but when the church intercedes, the result is in 
the hands of God alone. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
29.  Who knows whether all souls in purgatory wish to be redeemed, since we 
 have exceptions in St. Severinus and St. Paschal, as related in a legend. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
30.  No one is sure of the integrity of his own contrition, much less of 
 having received plenary remission. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
31.  The man who actually buys indulgences is as rare as he who is really 
 penitent; indeed, he is exceedingly rare. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
32.  Those who believe that they can be certain of their salvation because 
 they have indulgence letters will be eternally damned, together with their 
 teachers. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
33.  Men must especially be on guard against those who say that the pope's 
 pardons are that inestimable gift of God by which man is reconciled to him. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
34.  For the graces of indulgences are concerned only with the penalties of 
 sacramental satisfaction established by man. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
35.  They who teach that contrition is not necessary on the part of those who 
 intend to buy souls out of purgatory or to buy confessional privileges preach 
 unchristian doctrine. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
36.  Any truly repentant Christian has a right to full remission of penalty 
 and guilt, even without indulgence letters. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
37.  Any true Christian, whether living or dead, participates in all the 
 blessings of Christ and the church; and this is granted him by God, even 
 without indulgence letters. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
38.  Nevertheless, papal remission and blessing are by no means to be 
 disregarded, for they are, as I have said (Thesis 6), the proclamation of the 
 divine remission. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
39.  It is very difficult, even for the most learned theologians, at one and 
 the same time to commend to the people the bounty of indulgences and the need 
 of true contrition. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
40.  A Christian who is truly contrite seeks and loves to pay penalties for 
 his sins; the bounty of indulgences, however, relaxes penalties and causes 
men to hate them -- at least it furnishes occasion for hating them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
41.  Papal indulgences must be preached with caution, lest people erroneously 
 think that they are preferable to other good works of love. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
42.  Christians are to be taught that the pope does not intend that the buying 
 of indulgences should in any way be compared with works of mercy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
43.  Christians are to be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the 
 needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
44.  Because love grows by works of love, man thereby becomes better.  Man 
 does not, however, become better by means of indulgences but is merely freed 
 from penalties. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
45.  Christians are to be taught that he who sees a needy man and passes him 
 by, yet gives his money for indulgences, does not buy papal indulgences but 
 God's wrath. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
46.  Christians are to be taught that, unless they have more than they need, 
 they must reserve enough for their family needs and by no means squander it 
on indulgences. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
47.  Christians are to be taught that they buying of indulgences is a matter 
 of free choice, not commanded. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
48.  Christians are to be taught that the pope, in granting indulgences, needs 
 and thus desires their devout prayer more than their money. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
49.  Christians are to be taught that papal indulgences are useful only if 
 they do not put their trust in them, but very harmful if they lose their fear 
 of God because of them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
50.  Christians are to be taught that if the pope knew the exactions of the 
 indulgence preachers, he would rather that the basilica of St. Peter were 
 burned to ashes than built up with the skin, flesh, and bones of his sheep. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
51.  Christians are to be taught that the pope would and should wish to give 
 of his own money, even though he had to sell the basilica of St. Peter, to 
 many of those from whom certain hawkers of indulgences cajole money. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
52.  It is vain to trust in salvation by indulgence letters, even though the 
 indulgence commissary, or even the pope, were to offer his soul as security. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
53.  They are the enemies of Christ and the pope who forbid altogether the 
 preaching of the Word of God in some churches in order that indulgences may 
be  preached in others. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
54.  Injury is done to the Word of God when, in the same sermon, an equal or 
 larger amount of time is devoted to indulgences than to the Word. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
55.  It is certainly the pope's sentiment that if indulgences, which are a 
 very insignificant thing, are celebrated with one bell, one procession, and 
 one ceremony, then the gospel, which is the very greatest thing, should be 
 preached with a hundred bells, a hundred processions, a hundred ceremonies. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
56.  The true treasures of the church, out of which the pope distributes 
 indulgences, are not sufficiently discussed or known among the people of 
 Christ. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
57.  That indulgences are not temporal treasures is certainly clear, for many 
 indulgence sellers do not distribute them freely but only gather them. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
58.  Nor are they the merits of Christ and the saints, for, even without the 
 pope, the latter always work grace for the inner man, and the cross, death, 
 and hell for the outer man. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
59.  St. Lawrence said that the poor of the church were the treasures of the 
 church, but he spoke according to the usage of the word in his own time. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
60.  Without want of consideration we say that the keys of the church, given 
 by the merits of Christ, are that treasure. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
61.  For it is clear that the pope's power is of itself sufficient for the 
 remission of penalties and cases reserved by himself. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
62.  The true treasure of the church is the most holy gospel of the glory and 
 grace of God. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
63.  But this treasure is naturally most odious, for it makes the first to be 
 last (Mt. 20:16). 
</p> 
 
<p> 
64.  On the other hand, the treasure of indulgences is naturally most 
 acceptable, for it makes the last to be first. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
65.  Therefore the treasures of the gospel are nets with which one formerly 
 fished for men of wealth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
66.  The treasures of indulgences are nets with which one now fishes for the 
 wealth of men. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
67.  The indulgences which the demagogues acclaim as the greatest graces are 
 actually understood to be such only insofar as they promote gain. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
68.  They are nevertheless in truth the most insignificant graces when 
 compared with the grace of God and the piety of the cross. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
69.  Bishops and curates are bound to admit the commissaries of papal 
 indulgences with all reverence. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
70.  But they are much more bound to strain their eyes and ears lest these men 
 preach their own dreams instead of what the pope has commissioned. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
71.  Let him who speaks against the truth concerning papal indulgences be 
 anathema and accursed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
72.  But let him who guards against the lust and license of the indulgence 
 preachers be blessed. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
73.  Just as the pope justly thunders against those who by any means whatever 
 contrive harm to the sale of indulgences. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
74.  Much more does he intend to thunder against those who use indulgences as 
 a pretext to contrive harm to holy love and truth. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
75.  To consider papal indulgences so great that they could absolve a man even 
 if he had done the impossible and had violated the mother of God is madness. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
76.  We say on the contrary that papal indulgences cannot remove the very 
 least of venial sins as far as guilt is concerned. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
77.  To say that even St. Peter if he were now pope, could not grant greater 
 graces is blasphemy against St. Peter and the pope. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
78.  We say on the contrary that even the present pope, or any pope 
 whatsoever, has greater graces at his disposal, that is, the gospel, 
spiritual 
 powers, gifts of healing, etc., as it is written, 1 Co 12[:28]. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
79.  To say that the cross emblazoned with the papal coat of arms, and set up 
 by the indulgence preachers is equal in worth to the cross of Christ is 
 blasphemy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
80.  The bishops, curates, and theologians who permit such talk to be spread 
 among the people will have to answer for this. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
81.  This unbridled preaching of indulgences makes it difficult even for 
 learned men to rescue the reverence which is due the pope from slander or 
from 
 the shrewd questions of the laity. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
82.  Such as: "Why does not the pope empty purgatory for the sake of holy love 
 and the dire need of the souls that are there if he redeems an infinite 
number 
 of souls for the sake of miserable money with which to build a church?  The 
 former reason would be most just; the latter is most trivial. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
83.  Again, "Why are funeral and anniversary masses for the dead continued and 
 why does he not return or permit the withdrawal of the endowments founded for 
 them, since it is wrong to pray for the redeemed?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
84.  Again, "What is this new piety of God and the pope that for a 
 consideration of money they permit a man who is impious and their enemy to 
buy 
 out of purgatory the pious soul of a friend of God and do not rather, because 
 of the need of that pious and beloved soul, free it for pure love's sake?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
85.  Again, "Why are the penitential canons, long since abrogated and dead in 
 actual fact and through disuse, now satisfied by the granting of indulgences 
 as though they were still alive and in force?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
86.  Again, "Why does not the pope, whose wealth is today greater than the 
 wealth of the richest Crassus, build this one basilica of St. Peter with his 
 own money rather than with the money of poor believers?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
87.  Again, "What does the pope remit or grant to those who by perfect 
 contrition already have a right to full remission and blessings?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
88.  Again, "What greater blessing could come to the church than if the pope 
 were to bestow these remissions and blessings on every believer a hundred 
 times a day, as he now does but once?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
89.  "Since the pope seeks the salvation of souls rather than money by his 
 indulgences, why does he suspend the indulgences and pardons previously 
 granted  when they have equal efficacy?" 
</p> 
 
<p> 
90.  To repress these very sharp arguments of the laity by force alone, and 
 not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the church and the pope 
to 
 the ridicule of their enemies and to make Christians unhappy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
91.  If, therefore, indulgences were preached according to the spirit and 
 intention of the pope, all these doubts would be readily resolved. Indeed, 
 they would not exist. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
92.  Away, then, with all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, 
 "Peace, peace," and there is no peace! (Jer 6:14) 
</p> 
 
<p> 
93.  Blessed be all those prophets who say to the people of Christ, "Cross, 
 cross," and there is no cross! 
</p> 
 
<p> 
94.  Christians should be exhorted to be diligent in following Christ, their 
 Head, through penalties, death and hell. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
95.  And thus be confident of entering into heaven through many tribulations 
 rather than through the false security of peace (Acts 14:22).
