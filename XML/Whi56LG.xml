<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l n="first">I CELEBRATE myself, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I assume you shall assume, </l>

<l>For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to you. </l>

</lg>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I loafe and invite my soul, </l>

<l>I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summer grass. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Houses and rooms are full of perfumes &mdash; the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shelves are crowded with perfumes, </l>

<l>I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like it, </l>

<l>The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not let it. </l>

</lg>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the distillation, it is odorless, </l>



<pb n="6" id="Whi56LG014"/>

<l>It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it, </l>

<l>I will go to the bank by the wood, and become 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undisguised and naked, </l>

<l>I am mad for it to be in contact with me. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>The smoke of my own breath, </l>

<l>Echoes, ripples, buzzed whispers, love-root, silk-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thread, crotch, vine, </l>

<l>My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart, the passing of blood and air through 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lungs, </l>

<l>The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shore and dark-colored sea-rocks, and of 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hay in the barn, </l>

<l>The sound of the belched words of my voice, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words loosed to the eddies of the wind, </l>

<l>A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around of arms, </l>

<l>The play of shine and shade on the trees as the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supple boughs wag, </l>

<l>The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;along the fields and hill-sides, </l>

<l>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of me rising from bed and meeting the sun. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Have you reckoned a thousand acres much? 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have you reckoned the earth much? </l>

<l>Have you practiced so long to learn to read? </l>

<l>Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poems? </l>



<pb n="7" id="Whi56LG015"/>

<l>Stop this day and night with me, and you shall 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possess the origin of all poems, </l>

<l>You shall possess the good of the earth and sun &mdash; 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there are millions of suns left, </l>

<l>You shall no longer take things at second or third 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor feed on the spectres in books, </l>

<l>You shall not look through my eyes either, nor 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take things from me, </l>

<l>You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourself. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I have heard what the talkers were talking, the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talk of the beginning and the end, </l>

<l>But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>There was never any more inception than there is 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, </l>

<l>Nor any more youth or age than there is now, </l>

<l>And will never be any more perfection than there 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is now, </l>

<l>Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Urge, and urge, and urge, </l>

<l>Always the procreant urge of the world. </l>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Out of the dimness opposite equals advance &mdash; 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always substance and increase, always sex, </l>

<l>Always a knit of identity, always distinction, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always a breed of life. </l>

<l>To elaborate is no avail &mdash; learned and unlearned

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uprights, well entretied, braced in the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beams, </l>

<l>Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, </l>

<l>I and this mystery here we stand. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is all that is not my soul. </l>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the seen, </l>

<l>Till that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Showing the best and dividing it from the worst, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age vexes age, </l>

<l>Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, while they discuss I am silent, and go 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bathe and admire myself. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any man hearty and clean, </l>

<l>Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none shall be less familiar than the rest. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I am satisfied &mdash; I see, dance, laugh, sing; </l>

<l>As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my side through the night, and withdraws at 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the peep of the day, </l>

<l>And leaves for me baskets covered with white 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towels, swelling the house with their plenty, </l>

<l>Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and scream at my eyes, </l>

<l>That they turn from gazing after and down the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;road, </l>

<l>And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, </l>

<l>Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the con-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tents of two, and which is ahead? </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Trippers and askers surround me, </l>

<l>People I meet &mdash; the effect upon me of my early 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, of the ward and city I live in, of the 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nation, </l>

<l>The latest news, discoveries, inventions, societies,

<l>My dinner, dress, associates, looks, work, compli-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ments, dues, </l>

<l>The real or fancied indifference of some man or

<l>The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ill-doing, or loss or lack of money, or depress-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ions or exaltations, </l>

<l>Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am, </l>

<l>Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unitary, </l>

<l>Looks down, is erect, bends an arm on an 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impalpable certain rest, </l>

<l>Looks with its side-curved head, curious what will 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come next, </l>

<l>Both in and out of the game, and watching and

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Backward I see in my own days where I sweated

<l>Not words, not music or rhyme I want &mdash; not cus-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tom or lecture, not even the best, </l>

<l>Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I mind how we lay in June, such a transparent 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;summer morning, </l>

<l>You settled your head athwart my hips, and gently 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned over upon me, </l>



<pb n="11" id="Whi56LG019"/>

<l>And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, </l>

<l>And reached till you felt my beard, and reached 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till you held my feet. </l>

</lg>


<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and joy and knowledge that pass all the art

<l>And I know that the hand of God is the promise

<l>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother

<l>And that all the men ever born are also my bro-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thers, and the women my sisters and lovers, </l>

<l>And that a kelson of the creation is love, </l>

<l>And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the

<l>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them, </l>

<l>Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assorted, contradictory, </l>

<l>The gashed bodies on battle-fields, the insane in 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their strong-doored rooms, the sacred idiots, </l>

<l>The new-born emerging from gates, and the dying

<l>The night pervades them and enfolds them. </l>

<l>The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie

<salute>DEAR SIR &mdash; </salute> 
</opener> 

<p>I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of "LEAVES OF GRASS." I find it 
the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very 
happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of 
what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the 
temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean. 
</p> 

<p>I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things 
said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and 
which large perception only can inspire. 
</p> 

<p>I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground 
somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but 
the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and 
encouraging. 
</p> 

<p>I did not know until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper that I could trust the 
name as real 
<milestone unit="collate" n="15*"/>

and available for a post-office. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my 
tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.

<p>HERE are thirty-two Poems, which I send you, dear Friend and Master, not having found how I 
could satisfy myself with sending any usual acknowledgment of your letter. The first edition, on 
which you mailed me that till now unanswered letter, was twelve poems &mdash; I printed a thousand 
copies, and they readily sold; these thirty-two Poems I stereotype, to print several thousand 
copies of. I much enjoy making poems. Other work I have set for myself to do, to meet people 
and The States face to face, to confront them with an American rude tongue; but the work of my 
life is making poems. I keep on till I make a hundred, and then several hundred &mdash; perhaps a 
thousand. The way is clear to me. A few years, and the average annual call for my Poems is ten 
or twenty thousand copies &mdash; more, quite likely. Why should I hurry or compromise? In poems or 
in speeches I say the word or two that has got to be said, adhere to the body, step with the 
countless common footsteps, and remind every man and woman of something. 
</p> 

<p>Master, I am a man who has perfect faith. Master, we have not come through centuries, caste, 
heroisms, fables, to halt in this land today. Or I think it is to collect a ten-fold impetus that any 
halt is made. As nature, inexorable, onward, resistless, impassive amid the threats and sereams of 
disputants, so America. Let all defer. Let all 


<pb n="347" id="Whi56LG355"/>

attend respectfully the leisure of These States, their politics, poems, literature, manners, and their 
free-handed modes of training their own offspring. Their own comes, just matured, certain, 
numerous and capable enough, with egotistical tongues, with sinewed wrists, seizing openly 
what belongs to them. They resume Personality, too long left out of mind. Their shadows are 
projected in employments, in books, in the cities, in trade; their feet are on the flights of the steps 
of the Capitol; they dilate, a larger, brawnier, more candid, more democratic, lawless, positive 
native to The States, sweet-bodied, completer, dauntless, flowing, masterful, beard-faced, new 
race of men. 
</p> 

<p>Swiftly, on limitless foundations, the United States too are founding a literature. It is all as well 
done, in my opinion, as could be practicable. Each element here is in condition. Every day I go 
among the people of Manhattan Island, Brooklyn, and other cities, and among the young men, to 
discover the spirit of them, and to refresh myself. These are to be attended to; I am myself more 
drawn here than to those authors, publishers, importations, reprints, and so forth. I pass coolly 
through those, understanding them perfectly well. and that they do the indispensable service, 
outside of men like me, which nothing else could do. In poems, the young men of The States 
shall be represented, for they out-rival the best of the rest of the earth. 
</p> 

<p>The lists of ready-made literature which America inherits by the mighty inheritance of the 
English language &mdash; all the rich repertoire of traditions, poems, historics, metaphysics, plays, 
classics, translations, have made, and still continue, magnificent preparations for that other 
plainly signified literature, to be our own, to be electric, fresh, lusty, to express the full-sized 
body, male and female &mdash; to give the modern meanings of things, to grow up beautiful, lasting, 
commensurate with America, with all the passions of home, with the inimitable sympathies of 
having been 


<pb n="348" id="Whi56LG356"/>

boys and girls together, and of parents who were with our parents. 
</p> 

<p>What else can happen The States, even in their own despite? That huge English flow, so sweet, 
so undeniable, has done incalculable good here, and is to be spoken of for its own sake with 
generous praise and with gratitude. Yet the price The States have had to lie under for the same 
has not been a small price. Payment prevails; a nation can never take the issues of the needs of 
other nations for nothing. America, grandest of lands in the theory of its politics, in popular 
reading, in hospitality, breadth, animal beauty, cities, ships, machines, money, credit, collapses 
quick as lightning at the repeated, admonishing, stern words, Where are any mental expressions 
from you, beyond what you have copied or stolen? Where the born throngs of poets, literats, 
orators, you promised? Will you but tag after other nations? They struggled long for their 
literature, painfully working their way, some with deficient languages, some with priest-craft, 
some in the endeavor just to live &mdash; yet achieved for their times, works, poems, perhaps the only 
solid consolation left to them through ages afterward of shame and decay. You are young, have 
the perfectest of dialects, a free press, a free government, the world forwarding its best to be with 
you. As justice has been strictly done to you, from this hour do strict justice to yourself. Strangle 
the singers who will not sing you loud and strong. Open the doors of The West. Call for new 
great masters to comprehend new arts, new perfections, new wants. Submit to the most robust 
bard till he remedy your barrenness. Then you will not need to adopt the heirs of others; you will 
have true heirs, begotten of yourself, blooded with your own blood. 
</p> 

<p>With composure I see such propositions, seeing more and more every day of the answers that 
serve. Expressions do 


<pb n="349" id="Whi56LG357"/>

not yet serve, for sufficient reasons; but that is getting ready, beyond what the earth has hitherto 
known, to take home the expressions when they come, and to identify them with the populace of 
The States, which is the schooling cheaply procured by any outlay any number of years. Such 
schooling The States extract from the swarms of reprints, and from the current authors and 
editors. Such service and extract are done after enormous, reckless, free modes, characteristic of 
The States. Here are to be attained results never elsewhere thought possible; the modes are very 
grand too. The instincts of the American people are all perfect, and tend to make heroes. It is a 
rare thing in a man here to understand The States. 
</p> 

<p>All current nourishments to literature serve. Of authors and editors I do not know how many 
there are in The States, but there are thousands, each one building his or her step to the stairs by 
which giants shall mount. Of the twenty-four modern mammoth two-double, three-double, and 
four-double cylinder presses now in the world, printing by steam, twenty-one of them are in 
These States. The twelve thousand large and small shops for dispensing books and 
newspapers &mdash; the same number of public libraries, any one of which has all the reading wanted to 
equip a man or woman for American reading &mdash; the three thousand different newspapers, the 
nutriment of the imperfect ones coming in just as usefully as any &mdash; the story papers, various, full 
of strong-flavored romances, widely circulated &mdash; the onecent and two-cent journals &mdash; the political 
ones, no matter what side &mdash; the weeklies in the country &mdash; the sporting and pictorial papers &mdash; the 
monthly magazines, with plentiful imported feed &mdash; the sentimental novels, numberless copies of 
them &mdash; the low-priced flaring tales, adventures, biographies &mdash; all are prophetic; all waft rapidly on. 
I see that they swell wide, for reasons. I am not troubled at the movement of them, but greatly 
pleased. I see plying 



<pb n="350" id="Whi56LG358"/>

shuttles, the active ephemeral myriads of books also, faithfully weaving the garments of a 
generation of men, and a generation of women, they do not perceive or know. What a progress 
popular reading and writing has made in fifty years! What a progress fifty years hence! The time 
is at hand when inherent literature will be a main part of These States, as general and real as 
steam-power, iron, corn, beef, fish. First-rate American persons are to be supplied. Our perennial 
materials for fresh thoughts, histories, poems, music, orations, religions, recitations, amusements, 
will then not be disregarded, any more than our perennial fields, mines, rivers, seas. Certain 
 things are established, and are immovable; in those things millions of years stand justified. The 
mothers and fathers of whom modern centuries have come, have not existed for nothing; they too 
had brains and hearts. Of course all literature, in all nations and years, will share marked 
attributes in common, as we all, of all ages, share the common human attributes. America is to be 
kept coarse and broad. What is to be done is to withdraw from precedents, and be directed to men 
and women &mdash; also to The States in their federalness; for the union of the parts of the body is not 
more necessary to their life than the union of These States is to their life. 
</p> 

<p>A profound person can easily know more of the people than they know of themselves. Always 
waiting untold in the souls of the armies of common people, is stuff better than anything that can 
possibly appear in the leadership of the same. That gives final verdicts. In every department of 
These States, he who travels with a coterie, or with selected persons, or with imitators, or with 
infidels, or with the owners of slaves, or with that which is ashamed of the body of a man, or 
with that which is ashamed of the body of a woman, or with any thing less than the bravest and 
the openest, travels straight for the 


<pb n="351" id="Whi56LG359"/>

slopes of dissolution. The genius of all foreign literature is clipped and cut small, compared to 
our genius, and is essentially insulting to our usages, and to the organic compacts of These 
States. Old forms, old poems, majestic and proper in their own lands here in this land are exiles; 
the air here is very strong. Much that stands well and has a little enough place provided for it in 
the small scales of European kingdoms, empires, and the like, here stands haggard, dwarfed, 
ludicrous, or has no place little enough provided for it. Authorities, poems, models, laws, names, 
imported into America, are useful to America today to destroy them, and so move disencumbered 
to great works, great days. 
</p> 

<p>Just so long, in our country or any country, as no revolutionists advance, and are backed by the 
people, sweeping off the swarms of routine representatives, officers in power, book-makers, 
teachers, ecclesiastics, politicians, just so long, I perceive, do they who are in power fairly 
represent that country, and remain of use, probably of very great use. To supersede them, when it 
is the pleasure of These States, full provision is made; and I say the time has arrived to use it 
with a strong hand. Here also the souls of the armies have not only overtaken the souls of the 
officer, but passed on, and left the souls of the officers behind out of sight many weeks' journey; 
and the souls of the armies now go en-masse without officers. Here also formulas, glosses, 
blanks, minuti&aelig;, are choking the throats of the spokesmen to death. Those things most listened 
for, certainly those are the things least said. There is not a single History of the World. There is 
not one of America, or of the organic compacts of These States, or of Washington, or of 
Jefferson, nor of Language, nor any Dictionary of the English Language. There is no great 
author; every one has demeaned himself to some etiquette or some impotence. There is no 
manhood or life-power in poems; there are shoats and 


<pb n="352" id="Whi56LG360"/>

geldings more like. Or literature will be dressed up, a fine gentleman, distasteful to our instincts, 
foreign to our soil. Its neck bends right and left wherever it goes. Its costumes and jewelry prove 
how little it knows Nature. Its flesh is soft; it shows less and less of the indefinable hard 
something that is Nature. Where is any thing but the shaved Nature of synods and schools? 
Where is a savage and luxuriant man? Where is an overseer? In lives, in poems, in codes of law, 
in Congress, in tuitions, theatres, conversations, argumentations, not a single head lifts itself 
clean out, with proof that it is their master, and has subordinated them to itself, and is ready to try 
their superiors. None believes in These States, boldly illustrating them in himself. Not a man 
faces round at the rest with terrible negative voice, refusing all terms to be bought off from his 
own eye-sight, or from the soul that he is, or from friendship, or from the body that he is, or from 
the soil and sea. To creeds, literature, art, the army, the navy, the executive, life is hardly 
proposed, but the sick and dying are proposed to cure the sick and dying. The churches are one 
vast lie; the people do not believe them, and they do not believe themselves; the priests are 
continually telling what they know well enough is not so, and keeping back what they know is 
so. The spectacle is a pitiful one. I think there can never be again upon the festive earth more 
bad-disordered persons deliberately taking seats, as of late in These States, at the heads of the 
public tables &mdash; such corpses' eyes for judges &mdash; such a rascal and thief in the Presidency. 
</p> 

<p>Up to the present, as helps best, the people, like a lot of large boys, have no determined tastes, 
are quite unaware of the grandeur of themselves, and of their destiny, and of their immense 
strides &mdash; accept with voracity whatever is presented them in novels, histories, newspapers, poems, 
schools, lectures, every thing. Pretty soon, through these 


<pb n="353" id="Whi56LG361"/>

and other means, their development makes the fibre that is capable of itself, and will assume 
determined tastes. The young men will be clear what they want, and will have it. They will 
follow none except him whose spirit leads them in the like spirit with themselves. Any such man 
will be welcome as the flowers of May. Others will be put out without ceremony. How much is 
there anyhow, to the young men of These States, in a parcel of helpless dandies, who can neither 
fight, work, shoot, ride, run, command &mdash; some of them devout, some quite insane, some 
castrated &mdash; all second-hand, or third, fourth, or fifth hand &mdash; waited upon by waiters, putting not this 
land first, but always other lands first, talking of art, doing the most ridiculous things for fear of 
being called ridiculous, smirking and skipping along, continually taking off their hats &mdash; no one 
behaving, dressing, writing, talking, loving, out of any natural and manly tastes of his own, but 
each one looking cautiously to see how the rest behave, dress, write, talk, love &mdash; pressing the 
noses of dead books upon themselves and upon their country &mdash; favoring no poets, philosophs, 
literats here, but dog-like danglers at the heels of the poets, philosophs, literats, of 
enemies'lands &mdash; favoring mental expressions, models of gentlemen and ladies, social habitudes in 
These States, to grow up in sneaking defiance of the popular substratums of The States? Of 
course they and the likes of them can never justify the strong poems of America. Of course no 
feed of theirs is to stop and be made welcome to muscle the bodies, male and female, for 
Manhattan Island, Brooklyn, Boston, Worcester, Hartford, Portland, Montreal, Detroit, Buffalo, 
Cleaveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Iowa City, Philadelphia, 
Baltimore, Releigh, Savannah, Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, Brownsville, San 
Francisco, Havana, and a thousand equal cities, present and to come. Of course what they and the 
likes of them have been used for, draws toward its close, 


<pb n="354" id="Whi56LG362"/>

after which they will all be discharged, and not one of them will ever be heard of any more. 
</p> 

<p>America, having duly conceived, bears out of herself offspring of her own to do the 
workmanship wanted. To freedom, to strength, to poems, to personal greatness, it is never 
permitted to rest, not a generation or part of a generation. To be ripe beyond further increase is to 
prepare to die. The architects of These States laid their foundations, and passed to further, 
spheres. What they laid is a work done; as much more remains. Now are needed other architects, 
whose duty is not less difficult, but perhaps more difficult. Each age forever needs architects. 
America is not finished, perhaps never will be; now America is a divine true sketch. There are 
Thirty-Two States sketched &mdash; the population thirty millions. In a few years there will be Fifty 
States. Again in a few years there will be A Hundred States, the population hundreds of millions, 
the freshest and freest of men. Of course such men stand to nothing less than the freshest and 
freest expression. 
</p> 

<p>Poets here, literats here, are to rest on organic different bases from other countries; not a class set 
apart, circling only in the circle of themselves, modest and pretty, desperately scratching for 
rhymes, pallid with white paper, shut off, aware of the old pictures and traditions of the race, but 
unaware of the actual race around them &mdash; not breeding in and in among each other till they all 
have the scrofula. Lands of ensemble, bards of ensemble! Walking freely out from the old 
traditions, as our politics has walked out, American poets and literats recognize nothing behind 
them superior to what is present with them &mdash; recognize with joy the sturdy living forms of the 
men and women of These States, the divinity of sex, the perfect eligibility of the female with the 
male, all The States, liberty and equality, real articles, the different trades, mechanics, the 


<pb n="355" id="Whi56LG363"/>

young fellows of Manhattan Island, customs, instincts, slang, Wisconsin, Georgia, the noble 
Southern heart, the hot blood, the spirit that will be nothing less than master, the filibuster spirit, 
the Western man, native-born perceptions, the eye for forms, the perfect models of made things, 
the wild smack of freedom, California, money, electrictelegraphs, free-trade, iron and the iron 
mines &mdash; recognize without demur those splendid resistless black poems, the steam-ships of the 
sea-board states, and those other resistless splendid poems, the locomotives, followed through 
the interior states by trains of rail-road cars. 
</p> 

<p>A word remains to be said, as of one ever present, not yet permitted to be acknowledged, 
discarded or made dumb by literature, and the results apparent. To the lack of an avowed, 
empowered, unabashed development of sex, (the only salvation for the same,) and to the fact of 
speakers and writers fraudulently assuming as always dead what every one knows to be always 
alive, is attributable the remarkable non-personality and indistinctness of modern productions in 
books, art, talk; also that in the scanned lives of men and women most of them appear to have 
b&eacute;en for some time past of the neuter gender; and also the stinging fact that in orthodox society 
today. if the dresses were changed, the men might easily pass for women and the women for 
men. 
</p> 

<p>Infidelism usurps most with f&oelig;tid polite face; among the rest infidelism about sex. By silence or 
obedience the pens of savans, poets, historians, biographers, and the rest, have long connived at 
the filthy law, and books enslaved to it, that what makes the manhood of a man, that sex, 
womanhood, maternity, desires, lusty animations, organs, acts, are unmentionable and to be 
ashamed of, to be driven to skulk out of literature with whatever belongs to them. This filthy law 
has to be repealed &mdash; it stands in the way of great reforms. Of women just as much as 


<pb n="356" id="Whi56LG364"/>

men, it is the interest that there should not be infidelism about sex, but perfect faith. Women in 
These States approach the day of that organic equality with men, without which, I see, men 
cannot have organic equality among themselves. This empty dish, gallantry, will then be filled 
with something. This tepid wash, this diluted deferential love, as in songs, fictions, and so forth, 
is enough to make a man vomit; as to manly friendship, everywhere observed in The States, there 
is not the first breath of it to be observed in print. I say that the body of a man or woman, the 
main matter, is so far quite unexpressed in poems; but that the body is to be expressed, and sex 
is. Of bards for These States, if it come to a question, it is whether they shall celebrate in poems 
the eternal decency of the amativeness of Nature, the motherhood of all, or whether they shall be 
the bards of the fashionable delusion of the inherent nastiness of sex, and of the feeble and 
querulous modesty of deprivation. This is important in poems, because the whole of the other 
expressions of a nation are but flanges out of its great poems. To me, henceforth, that theory of 
any thing, no matter what, stagnates in its vitals, cowardly and rotten, while it cannot publicly 
accept, and publicly name, with specific words, the things on which all existence, all souls, all 
realization, all decency, all health, all that is worth being here for, all of woman and of man, all 
beauty, all purity, all sweetness, all friendship, all strength, all life, all immortality depend. The 
courageous soul, for a year or two to come, may be proved by faith in sex, and by disdaining 
concessions. 
</p> 

<p>To poets and literats &mdash; to every woman and man, today or any day, the conditions of the present, 
needs, dangers, prejudices, and the like, are the perfect conditions on which we are here, and the 
conditions for wording the future with undissuadable words. These States, receivers of 


<pb n="357" id="Whi56LG365"/>

the stamina of past ages and lands, initiate the outlines of repayment a thousand fold. They fetch 
the American great masters, waited for by old worlds and new, who accept evil as well as good, 
ignorance as well as erudition, black as soon as white, foreign-born materials as well as 
home-born, reject none, force discrepancies into range, surround the whole, concentrate them on 
present periods and places, show the application to each and any one's body and soul, and show 
the true use of precedents. Always America will be agitated and turbulent. This day it is taking 
shape, not to be less so, but to be more so, stormily, capriciously, on native principles, with such 
vast proportions of parts! As for me, I love screaming, wrestling, boiling-hot days. 
</p> 

<p>Of course, we shall have a national character, an identity. As it ought to be, and as soon as it 
ought to be, it will be. That, with much else, takes care of itself, is a result, and the cause of 
greater results. With Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon &mdash; with the states around the Mexican 
sea &mdash; with cheerfully welcomed immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa &mdash; with Connecticut, 
Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island &mdash; with all varied interests, facts, beliefs, parties, 
genesis &mdash; there is being fused a determined character, fit for the broadest use for the freewomen 
and freemen of Tho States, accomplished and to be accomplished, without any exception 
whatever &mdash; each indeed free, each idiomatic, as becomes live states and men, but each adhering to 
one enclosing general form of politics, manners, talk, personal style, as the plenteous varieties of 
the race adhere to one physical form. Such character is the brain and spine to all, including 
literature, including poems. Such character, strong, limber, just, open-mouthed, 
American-blooded, full of pride, full of ease, of passionate friendliness, is to stand compact upon

and ever-unsurveyable seas and shores.

indicated in ourselves, and that we will stick to it and enlarge upon it through These States.

<p>WE have before us one of the most extraordinary specimens of Yankee intelligence and 
American eccentricity in authorship, it is possible to conceive. It is of a <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> so peculiar 
as to embarrass us, and has an air at once so novel, so audacious, and so strange as to verge upon 
absurdity, and yet it would be an injustice to pronounce it so, as the work is saved from this 
extreme by a certain mastery over diction not very easy of definition. What Emerson has 
pronounced to be good must not be lightly treated, and before we pronounce upon the merits of 
this performance it is but right to examine them. We have, then, a series of pithy prose sentences 
strung together &mdash; forming twelve grand divisions in all, but which, having a rude rhymical 
cadence about them, admit of the designation poetical being applied. They are destitute of rhyme, 
measure of feet, and the like, every condition under which poetry is generally understood to exist 
being absent; but in their strength of expression, their fervor, hearty wholesomeness, their 
originality, mannerism, and freshness, one finds in them a singular harmony and flow, as if by 
reading, they gradually formed themselves into melody, and adopted characteristics peculiar and 
appropriate to themselves alone. If, however, some sentences be fine, there are others altogether 
laughable; nevertheless, in the bare strength, the unhesitating frankness of a man who "believes 
in the flesh and the appetites," and who dares to call simplest things by their plainest names, 
conveying also a large sense of the beautiful, and with an emphasis which gives a clearer 
conception of what manly modesty really is than any thing we have, in all conventional forms of 
word, deed, or act so far known of, that we rid ourselves, little by little, of the 


<pb n="360" id="Whi56LG368"/>

strangeness with which we greet this bluff new-comer, and, beginning to understand him better, 
appreciate him in proportion as he becomes more known. He will soon make his way into the 
confidence of his readers, and his poems in time will become a pregnant text-book, out of which 
quotation as sterling as the minted gold will be taken and applied to every form and phase of the 
"inner" or the "outer" life; and we express our pleasure in making the acquaintance of Walt 
Whitman, hoping to know more of him in time to come.

<title>LEAVES OF GRASS. A volume of Poems, just published. 
</title> 
</head> 

<p>To give judgment on real poems, one needs an account of the poet himself. Very devilish to 
some, and very divine to some, will appear the poet of these new poems, the "LEAVES OF 
GRASS," an attempt, as they are, of a naive, masculine, affectionate, contemplative, sensual, 
imperious person, to cast into literature not only his own grit and arrogance, but his own flesh 
and form, undraped, regardless of models, regardless of modesty or law, and ignorant or silently 
scornful, as at first appears, of all except his own presence and experience, and all outside the 
fiercely loved land of his birth, and the birth of his parents and their parents for several 
generations before him. Politeness this man has none, and regulation he has none. A rude child of 
the people! &mdash; No imitation &mdash; No foreigner &mdash; but a growth and idiom of America. No discontented &mdash; a 
careless slouch, enjoying to-day. No dilletant democrat &mdash; a man who is art-and-part with the 
commonalty, and with immediate life &mdash; loves the streets &mdash; loves the docks &mdash; loves the free rasping 
talk of men &mdash; likes to be called by his given name, and nobody at all need Mr him &mdash; can laugh with 
laughers &mdash; likes the cheap ways of laborers &mdash; is not prejudiced one mite against the Irish &mdash; talks 
readily with them &mdash; talks readily with niggers &mdash; does not make a stand on being a gentleman, nor 
on learning or manners &mdash; eats cheap fare, likes the strong-flavored coffee of the coffee-stands in 
the market, at sunrise &mdash; likes a supper of oysters fresh from the oyster-smack &mdash; likes to make one at 
the crowded table among sailors and workpeople &mdash; would leave a select soiree of elegant people 
any time to go with tumultuous men, 


<pb n="361" id="Whi56LG369"/>

roughs, receive their caresses and welcome, listen to their noise, oaths, smut, fluency, laughter, 
repartee &mdash; and can preserve his presence perfectly among these, and the like of these. The effects 
he produces in his poems are no effects of artists or the arts, but effects of the original eye or 
arm, or the actual atmosphere or tree or bird. You may feel the unconscious teaching of a fine 
brute, but will never feel the teaching of a fine writer or speaker. 
</p> 

<p>Other poets celebrate great events, personages, romances, wars, loves, passions, the victories and 
power of their country, or some real or imagined incident &mdash; and polish their work, and come to 
conclusions, and satisfy the reader. This poet celebrates himself; and that is the way he celebrates 
all. He comes to no conclusions, and does not satisfy the reader. He certainly leaves him what the 
serpent left the woman and the man, the taste of the Paradisaic tree of the knowledge of good and 
evil, never to be erased again. 
</p> 

<p>What good is it to argue about egotism? There can be no two thoughts on Walt Whitman's 
egotism. That is avowedly what he steps out of the crowd and turns and faces them for. Mark, 
critics! Otherwise is not used for you the key that leads to the use of the other keys to this 
well-enveloped man. His whole work, his life, manners, friendships, writings, all have among 
their leading purposes an evident purpose to stamp a new type of character, namely his own, and 
indelibly fix it and publish it, not for a model but an illustration, for the present and future of 
American letters and American young men, for the south the same as the north, and for the 
Pacific and Mississippi country, and Wisconsin and Texas and Kansas and Canada and Havana 
and Nicaragua, just as much as New York and Boston. Whatever is needed toward this 
achievement he puts his hand to, and lets imputations take their time to die. 
</p> 

<p>First be yourself what you would show in your poem &mdash; such seems to be this man's example and 
inferred rebuke to the schools of poets. He makes no allusions to books or writers; their spirits do 
not seem to have touched him; he has not a word to say for or against them, or their theories or 
ways. He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know 
so well. Of pure American breed, large and lusty &mdash; age thirty-six years, (1855,) &mdash; never once using 
medicine &mdash; never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes &mdash; 
<milestone unit="collate" n="16"/> 


<pb n="362" id="Whi56LG370"/>

neck open, shirt-collar flat and broad, countenance tawny transparent red, beard well-mottled 
with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked &mdash; his 
physiology corroborating a rugged phrenology 
 &mdash; a spirit 
that mixes cheerfully with the world &mdash; a person singularly beloved and looked toward, especially 
by young men and the illiterate &mdash; one who has firm attachments there, and associates there &mdash; one 
who does not associate with literary people &mdash; a man never called upon to make speeches at public 
dinners, never on platforms amid the crowds of clergymen, or professors, or aldermen, or 
congressmen &mdash; rather down in the bay with pilots in their pilot-boat &mdash; or off on a cruise with 
fishers in a fishing smack &mdash; or with a band of loungers over the open grounds of the country &mdash; fond 
of New York and Brooklyn &mdash; fond of the life of the great ferries, or along Broadway, observing 
the endless wonders of that thoroughfare of the world &mdash; One whom, if you would meet, you need 
not expect to meet an extraordinary person &mdash; one in whom you will see the singularity which 
consists in no singularity &mdash; whose contact is no dazzle or fascination, nor requires any deference, 
but has the easy fascination of what is homely and accustomed &mdash; of something you knew before, 
and was waiting for &mdash; of natural pleasures, and well-known places, and welcome familiar 
faces &mdash; there you have Walt Whitman, the begetter of a new offspring out of literature, taking with 
easy nonchalance the chances of 


<pb n="363" id="Whi56LG371"/>

its present reception, and, through all misunderstandings and distrusts, the chances of its future 
reception &mdash; preferring always to speak for himself rather than have others speak for him.

<p>Carlyle represents a cotemporary reviewer taking leave of the Belles-Lettres department 
somewhat in this abrupt manner: "The end having come, it is fit that we end &mdash; Poetry having 
ceased to be read, or published, or written, how can it continue to be reviewed? With your Lake 
Schools, and Border-Thief Schools, and Cockney and Satanic Schools, there has been enough to 
do; and now, all these Schools having burnt or smouldered themselves out, and left nothing but a 
wide-spread wreck of ashes, dust, and cinders &mdash; or perhaps dying embers, kicked to and fro under 
the feet of innumerable women and children in the magazines, and at best blown here and there 
into transient sputters, what remains but to adjust ourselves to circumstances? Urge me not," 
continues this desperate <hi rend="italic">Literateur,</hi> "with considerations that Poetry, as the inward Voice 
of Life, must be perennial, only dead in one form to become alive in another; that this still 
abundant deluge of Metre, seeing there must needs be fractions of Poetry floating, scattered in it, 
ought still to be net-fished, at all events, surveyed and taken note of. The survey of English 
metre, at this epoch, perhaps transcends the human faculties; to hire out the reading of it by 
estimate, at a remunerative rate per page, would, in a few quarters, reduce the cashbox of any 
extant review to the verge of insolvency." 
</p> 

<p>Such is the humorous but essentially truthful picture of the condition and product of the creative 
faculties during the second quarter of the present century. The great poets, Byron, Shelley, 
Wordsworth, Goethe, and Schiller, had fulfilled their tasks and gone to other spheres; and all that 
remained, with few exceptions, were weak and feeble echoes of their dying strains, caught up 
and repeated by numerous imitators and pretenders. And so has it ever been; the visions and 
perceptions of one man become the creed and superficial life-element of other minds. 
Swedenborg is worthy to be enrolled among the master-minds of the world, because he entered 
for himself into the Arcana 


<pb n="364" id="Whi56LG372"/>

of the profoundest mysteries that can concern human intelligences; his great thoughts are 
revolved, quoted, and represented in all "New Church" publications, but very rarely digested and 
assimilated by those who claim to be his followers. Still more rare is it to find any receiver of 
"the heavenly doctrines" determined to enter for himself into the very interiors of all that 
Swedenborg taught &mdash; to see, not the mighty reflections that Swedenborg was able to give of 
interior realities, but their originals, as they stand constellated in the heavens! 
</p> 

<p>But Divine Providence, leading forth the race, as a father the tottering steps of his children, 
causes the outward form on which all men are prone to rely, to be forever changing and passing 
away before their eyes. The seeds of death are ever found lurking in the fairest external 
appearances, till those externals become the mere correspondences and representatives of interior 
realities, and then, though enduring as the fadeless garments of the blest, they are ever-varying, 
as those robes of light change with each changing state. The Coming Age will recognize the 
profoundest truths in the internal thought of the Swedish sage, while his most tenacious 
adherents will be forced to admit that, in externals, he often erred, and was not unfrequently 
deceived. But the discovered error will not only wean them from a blind and bigoted reliance 
upon frail man, but confirm the sincere lovers of truth in loyalty to her standard. So, also, the 
Spiritualists are being taught a severe but salutary lesson, that if they will penetrate into the 
heavenly Arcana of the Inner Life, they must do so by purifying and elevating their own minds, 
and not by "sitting in circles" or ransacking town and country to find the most "reliable 
Mediums." Still no step in human progress and development is in vain; even the falls of the child 
are essential to its discipline. The mistakes and errors of men are needful while in their present 
imperfect state. They are to the seekers of truth what trials and losses are to those in the pursuit 
of wealth; they but enhance the value of the prize, and confirm the devotion of the true aspirant, 
as frowns rekindle the ardor of lovers. 
</p> 

<p>Moreover, as man must ever enter into the kingdom of a new unfolding truth with the simplicity 
and teachableness of little children, it is well that the outer form of the old disappear, that the 
new may stand alone in its place. It seems also to be a Law that when a change entire and 
universal 


<pb n="365" id="Whi56LG373"/>

is to be outwrought, the means preparatory to its introduction shall be equally wide-spreads, and 
ultimated to the lowest possible plane. Hence the Spiritual manifestations meet the most external 
minds; and allow even the unregenerate to know by experience the fact and process of Spiritual 
inspiration; so that skepticism becomes impossible to the candid and living mind. The second 
step will be, after such have been convinced that Spiritual intercourse is possible, that they learn 
that it is worse than useless for the purpose of attaining any thing desirable, beyond this 
conviction &mdash; except so far as is orderly and directed, not by the will of man, but of God. But as the 
old form of poetic inspiration died out with Byron and Shelley, Wordsworth and Goethe, and as 
the miscellaneous Spirit-intercourse itself, also as quickly passes away, there will, we apprehend, 
spring up forms of mediatorial inspiration, of which there will be two permanent types. The first 
and highest, as it seems to us, will be the opening of the interiors to direct influx to the inspiring 
sources of love and wisdom. The heavens will flow down into the hearts and lives, into the 
thought and speech of harmonic natures, as the silent dews impregnate the patient earth. Men 
will live in heaven, hence they must be inspired by that breath of life that fills its ethereal 
expanse. A second class of Media will be used for the ultimation, for ends of use and in 
accordance with Laws of Order, of the creative thoughts and hymns, the Epics and Lyrics, of 
individual Spirits and societies of Spirits. These will be to the former Media as the youthful artist 
who copies the work of a master to the Angelos and Raphaels, who both design and execute their 
plans, though they themselves, in their deepest interiors, are instructed and sustained from 
above. 
</p> 

<p>But in the transition period in which we now are, many varieties of Mediumship must be 
expected. There are those who stand in rapport with the diseased mentalities of the past and 
present, and pour forth as Divine Revelations the froth and scum of a receding age; they are the 
sponges who absorb the waste and impurities of humanity. They are also like running sores that 
gather the corrupt humors and drain the body of its most noxious fluids. There are others who 
come in contact with the outmost portion of the Spirit-life. These give crude, and in themselves, 
false notions of the state of man after death; yet they prepare the way for more truthful 
disclosures; if in no other way 


<pb n="366" id="Whi56LG374"/>

by stimulating the appetite for more substantial nourishment. There are those also who are lifted 
by genial inspirations to receive influxes from the upper mind-sphere of the age. They stand, as it 
were, on clear mountains of intellectual elevation, and with keenest perception discern the purer 
forms of new unfolding truths ere they become sufficiently embodied to be manifest to the 
grosser minds of the race. Of these, Ralph Waldo Emerson is the highest type. He sees the future 
of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man; he welcomes those impalpable forms, as 
Spiritualists receive with gladdened minds the returning hosts of Spirit-friends. 
</p> 

<p>There are other mediatorial natures who are in mental and heart-sympathy with man, as he now 
is, struggling to free himself from the tyranny of the old and effete, and to grasp and retain the 
new life flowing down from the heavens. And as the kindling rays at first produce more smoke 
than fire, so their lay is one of promise rather than performance. Such we conceive to be the 
interior condition of the author of "LEAVES OF GRASS." He accepts man as he is as to his 
whole nature, and all men as his own brothers. The lambent flame of his genius encircles the 
world &mdash; nor does he clearly discern between that which is to be preserved and that which is but as 
fuel for the purification of the ore from its dross. There is a wild strength, a Spartan simplicity 
about the man, and he stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation, like a drunken 
Hercules amid the dainty dancers. That his song is highly mediatorial, he himself asserts, though 
probably he is unacquainted with the Spiritual developments of the age. 
</p> 

<lg type="verse" n="1"><l>"Through me," he sings, "many long dumb voices, </l>

<l>Voices of the interminable generations of slaves, </l>

<l>Voices of the diseased and despairing, </l>

<l>Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, </l>

<l>And of threads that connect the stars, </l>

<l>And of the rights of them the others are down upon. </l>

</lg><lg type="verse" n="1"><l>Through me forbidden voices &mdash; voices velled, </l>

<l>Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured." </l>

</lg>


<p>We omit much even in this short extract, for the book abounds in passages that can not be quoted 
in drawing-rooms, and expressions that fall upon the tympanums of ears polite, with a terrible 
dissonance. His very gait, as he walks through the world, makes dainty people nervous, and 
conservatives regard him as a social revolution. His 


<pb n="367" id="Whi56LG375"/>

style is everywhere graphic and strong, and he sings many things before untouched in prose or 
rhyme, in an idiom that is neither prose nor rhyme, nor yet orthodox blank verse. But it serves his 
purpose well. He wears his strange garb, cut and made by himself, as gracefully as a South 
American cavalier his poncho. We will continue our quotations. 
</p> 

<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extract of several pages</hi>) 
</p> 

<p>Such are the graphic pictures which this new world-painter flings from his easel and dashes upon 
the moving panorama of life. His night-thoughts are not less striking, as, borne by the Muse, he 
looks into every chamber, and hears the quiet breathing of slumbering humanity. 
</p> 

<p>As the volume advances toward its conclusion, the Spirit of the poet becomes calmer and more 
serenely elevated. But everywhere his sympathy is with <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> and not with 
conventionalisms. 
</p> 

<p>We can not take leave of this remarkable volume without advising our friends, who are not too 
delicately nerved, to study the work as a sign of the times, written, as we perceive, under 
powerful influxes; a prophecy and promise of much that awaits all who are entering with us into 
the opening doors of a new Era. A portion of that thought, which broods over the American 
nation, is here seized and bodied forth by a son of the people, rudely, wildly, and with some 
perversions, yet strongly and genuinely, according to the perception of this bold writer. He is the 
young Hercules who has seized the serpents that would make him and us their prey; but instead 
of strangling, he would change them to winged and beautiful forms, who shall become the 
servants of mankind.

<p>WALT WHITMAN'S LEAVES OF GRASS. &mdash; Our account of the last month's literature would 
be incomplete without some notice of a curious and lawless collection of poems, called 
"LEAVES OF GRASS," and issued in a thin quarto, without the name of publisher or author. 
The poems, twelve in number, are neither in rhyme nor blank verse, but in a sort of excited prose 
broken into lines without any attempt at measure or regularity, and, as many readers will perhaps 
think, without any idea of sense or reason. The writer's 


<pb n="368" id="Whi56LG376"/>

scorn for the wonted usages of good writing, extends to the vocabulary he adopts; words usually 
banished from polite society are here employed without reserve and with perfect indifference as 
to their effect on the reader's mind; and not only is the book one not to be read aloud to a mixed 
audience, but the introduction of terms, never before heard or seen, and of slang expressions, 
often renders an otherwise striking passage altogether laughable. But, as the writer is a new light 
in poetry, it is only fair to let him state his theory for himself. We extract from the preface: 
</p> 
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extract</hi>.) 
</p> 

<p>The application of these principles, and of many others equally peculiar, which are expounded in 
a style equally oracular throughout the long preface &mdash; is made <hi rend="italic">passim,</hi> and often with 
comical success, in the poems themselves, which may briefly be described as a compound of the 
New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy. A fireman or omnibus driver, who had 
intelligence enough to absorb the speculations of that school of thought which culminated at 
Boston some fifteen or eighteen years ago, and resources of expression to put them forth again in 
a form of his own, with sufficient self-conceit and contempt for public taste to affront all usual 
propriety of diction, might have written this gross yet elevated, this superficial yet profound, this 
preposterous yet somehow fascinating book. As we say, it is a mixture of Yankee 
transcendentalism and New York rowdyism, and, what must be surprising to both these 
elements, they here seem to fuse and combine with the most perfect harmony. The vast and 
vague conceptions of the one, lose nothing of their quality in passing through the coarse and odd 
intellectual medium of the other; while there is an original perception of nature, a manly brawn, 
and an epic directness in our new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental 
school. But we have no intention of regularly criticizing this very irregular production; our aim is 
rather to coll, from the rough and ragged thicket of its pages, a few passages equally remarkable 
in point of thought and expression. Of course we do not select those which are the most 
transcendental or the most bold. 
</p> 
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extracts</hi>.) 
</p> 

<p>As seems very proper in a book of transcendental poetry, the author withholds his name from the 
title-page, and 

<pb n="369" id="Whi56LG377"/>

presents his portrait, neatly engraved on steel, instead. This no doubt, is upon the principle that 
the name is morely accidental; while the portrait affords an idea of the essential being from 
whom these utterances proceed. We must add, however, that this significant reticence does not 
prevail throughout the volume, for we learn on p. 29, that our poet is "Walt Whitman, an 
American, one of the roughs, a kosmos." That he was an American, we knew before, for, aside 
from America, there is no quarter of the universe where such a production could have had a 
genesis. That he was one of the roughs was also tolerably plain; but that he was a kosmos, is a 
piece of news we were hardly prepared for. Precisely what a kosmos is, we hope Walt Whitman 
will take early occasion to inform the impatient public.

<p>It is always reserved for second-rate poems immediately to gratify. As first-rate or natural 
objects, in their perfect simplicity and proportion, do not startle or strike, but appear no more 
than matters of course, so probably natural poetry does not, for all its being the rarest, and telling 
of the longest and largest work. The artist or writer whose talent is to please the connoisseurs of 
his time, may obey the laws of his time, and achieve the intense and elaborated beauty of parts. 
The perfect poet cannot afford any special beauty of parts, or to limit himself by any laws less 
than those universal ones of the great masters, which include all times, and all men and women, 
and the living and the dead. For from the study of the universe is drawn this irrefragable truth, 
that the law of the requisites of a grand poem, or any other complete workmanship, is originality, 
and the average and superb beauty of the ensemble. Possessed with this law, the fitness of aim, 
time, persons, places, surely follows. Possessed with this law, and doing justice to it, no poet or 
any one else will make anything ungraceful or mean, any more than any emanation of nature 
is. 
</p> 

<p>The poetry of England, by the many rich geniuses of 


<pb n="370" id="Whi56LG378"/>

that wonderful little island, has grown out of the facts of the English race, the monarchy and 
aristocracy prominent over the rest, and conforms to the spirit of them. No nation ever did or 
ever will receive with national affection any poets except those born of its national blood. Of 
these, the writings express the finest infusions of government, traditions, faith, and the 
dependence or independence of a people, and even the good or bad physiognomy, and the ample 
or small geography. Thus what very properly fits a subject of the British crown may fit very ill 
an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of 
delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect, 
is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; every thing receives its tinge from that. In 
the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakspeare just as much as the rest, there is the 
air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve, 
are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of 
mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakspeare, represented in America, is not 
an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone never silent in their plots and 
characters be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson 
was the most enormous of liars, and common persons north and south should bow low to their 
betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the 
Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they 
must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern 
successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops. 
</p> 

<p>English versification is full of these danglers, and America follows after them. Every body writes 
poetry, and yet there is not a single poet. An age greater than the proudest of the past is swiftly 
slipping away, without one lyric voice to seize its greatness and speak it as an encouragement 
and onward lesson. We have heard, by many grand announcements, that he was to come; but will 
he come?

<p>The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred 
Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy and their combination into love. This 
love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakspeare the same as the rest. It is 
possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it 
from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and 
goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and 
weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the 
occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connection with the charms of the neck, hair, or 
complexion of a particular female. 
</p> 

<p>Poetry, to Tennyson and his British and American eleves, is a gentleman of the first degree, 
boating, fishing, and shooting genteelly through nature, admiring the ladies, and talking to them 
in company with that elaborate halfchoked deference that is to be made up by the terrible license 
of men among themselves. The spirit of the burnished society of upper-class England fills this 
writer and his effusions from top to toe. Like that, he does not ignore courage and the superior 
qualities of men, but all is to show forth through dandified forms. He meets the nobility and 
gentry half-way. The models are the same both to the poet and the parlors. Both have the same 
supercilious elegance, both love the reminiscences which extol caste, both agree on the topics 
proper for mention and discussion, both hold the same undertone of church and state, both have 
the same languishing melancholy and irony, both indulge largely in persiflage, both are marked 
by the contour of high blood and a constitutional a version to anything cowardly 


<pb n="372" id="Whi56LG380"/>

and mean, both accept the love depicted in romances as the great business of a life or a poem, 
both seem unconscious of the mighty truths of eternity and immortality, both are silent on the 
presumptions of liberty and equality, and both devour themselves in solitary lassitude. Whatever 
may be said of all this, it harmonizes and represents facts. The present phases of high-life in 
Great Britain are as natural a growth there as Tennyson and his poems are a natural growth of 
those phases. It remains to be distinctly admitted that this man is a real poet, notwithstanding his 
ennui and his aristocracy. 
</p> 

<p>Meanwhile a strange voice parts others aside and demands for its owner that position that is only 
allowed after the seal of many returning years has stamped with approving stamp the claims of 
the loftiest leading genius. Do you think the best honors of the earth are won so easily, Walt 
Whitman? Do you think city and country are to fall before the vehement egotism of your 
recitative of yourself? 
</p> 

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I am the poet of the body, </l>

<l>And I am the poet of the soul. </l>

</lg>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, </l>

<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new tongue. </l>

</lg>

<l>I chant a new chant of dilation or pride, </l>

<l>We have had ducking and deprecating about enough, </l>

<l>I show that size is only development. </l>

</lg>
 

<p>It is indeed a strange voice! Critics and lovers and readers of poetry as hitherto written, may well 
be excused the chilly and unpleasant shudders which will assuredly run through them, to their 
very blood and bones, when they first read Walt Whitman's poems. If this is poetry, where must 
its foregoers stand! And what is at once to become of the ranks of rhymsters, melancholy and 
swallow-tailed, and of all the confectioners and upholsterers of verse, if the tan-faced man here 
advancing and claiming to speak for America and the nineteenth hundred of the Christian list of 
years, typifies indeed the natural and proper hard? 
</p> 

<p>The theory and practice of poets have hitherto been to select certain ideas or events or 
personages, and then 


<pb n="373" id="Whi56LG381"/>

describe them in the best manner they could, always with as much ornament as the case allowed. 
Such are not the theory and practice of the new poet. He never presents for perusal a poem 
ready-made on the old models, and ending when you come to the end of it; but every sentence 
and every passage tells of an interior not always seen, and exudes an impalpable something 
which sticks to him that reads, and pervades and provokes him to tread the half-invisible road 
where the poet, like an apparition, is striding fearlessly before. If Walt Whitman's premises are 
true, then there is a subtler range of poetry than that of the grandeur and life of events, as in 
Homer, or of characters, as in Shakspeare &mdash; poetry to which all other writing is subservient, and 
which confronts the very meanings of the works of nature and competes with them. It is the 
direct bringing of occurrences and persons and things to bear on the listener or beholder, to 
re-appear through him or her; and it offers the best way of making them a part of him and her as 
the right aim of the greatest poet. 
</p> 

<p>Of the spirit of life in visible forms &mdash; of the spirit of the seed growing out of the ground &mdash; of the 
spirit of the resistless motion of the globe passing unsuspected but quick as lightning along its 
orbit &mdash; of them is the spirit of this man's poetry. Like them it eludes and mocks criticism, and 
appears unerringly in results. Things, facts, events, persons, days, ages, qualities, tumble 
pell-mell, exhaustless and copious, with what appear to be the same disregard of parts and the 
same absence of special purpose, as in nature. But the voice of the few rare and controlling 
critics, and the voice of more than one generation of men or two generations of men, must speak 
for the inexpressible purposes of nature, and for this haughtiest of writers that has ever yet 
written and printed a book. His is to prove either the most lamentable of failures or the most 
glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature. And after all we have written we confess 
our brain-felt and heart-felt inability to decide which we think it is likely to be.

to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums, and her Fanny Ferns; but 
the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the 
winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for 
which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet 
presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile 
delicacy of the civilized poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt 
exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom these articles 
belong scorns the delicate arts of civilization. The man is the true impersonation of his 
book &mdash; rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this 
erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is &mdash;</p>

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, </l>

<l>Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual. </l>
</lg>

<p>
The words "an American" are a surplusage, "one of the roughs" too painfully apparent; but what 
is intended to be conveyed by "a kosmos" we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that 
the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to 
declare is "not to be read aloud to a mixed audience." We should have passed over this book, 
"LEAVES OF GRASS," with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics 
attempted to "fix" this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature 
to America &mdash; who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it 
possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in 
the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt 
Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt, 
oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet &mdash; that each one of her 
children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old 
conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly 
original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief 
in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and 


<pb n="375" id="Whi56LG383"/>

Shakspeare; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being 
himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the 
manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be 
thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong 
relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; may, further, that his crude mind is capable 
of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is 
excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is as unacquainted with art, as a hog is 
with mathematics. His poems &mdash; we must call them so for convenience &mdash; twelve in number, are 
innocent of rhythm. and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed, 
Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few 
amiable savages. Or rather, perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban flinging down his 
logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact, Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have 
written this: 
</p> 

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>I too am not a bit tamed &mdash; I too am untranslatable, </l>

<l>I sound my <hi rend="italic">barbaric yawp</hi> over the roofs of the world. </l>

</lg>
 

<p>Is this man with the "barbaric yawp" to push Long-fellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to 
stand and "make mouths" at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not 
ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its 
bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of 
the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of 
melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave 
of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's 
compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not 
prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the "LEAVES OF GRASS" 
deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type 
of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of <hi rend="italic">a man:</hi> we, who may have 
been misdirected by civilization, call it the expression of <hi rend="italic">a beast</hi>. 
</p> 

<p>The leading idea of Walt Whitman's poems is as old as 


<pb n="376" id="Whi56LG384"/>

the hills. It is the doctrine of universal sympathy which the first poet maintained, and which the 
last on earth will maintain also. He says: 
</p> 

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail but I am handcuffed to 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him and walk by his side, </l>

<l>Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last 
<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gasp. </l>

</lg>
 

<p>To show this sympathy he instances a thousand paltry, frivolous, and obscene circumstances. 
Herein we may behold the difference between a great and a contemptible poet. What 
Shakspeare &mdash; mighty shade of the mightiest bard, forgive us the comparison! &mdash; expressed in a 
single line,</p>

<lg type="verse" n="1">
<l>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, </l>
</lg>

<p>
this Walt Whitman has tortured into scores of pages. A single extract will show what we mean. 
This miserable spinner of words declares that the earth has "no themes, or hints, or provokers," 
and never had, if you cannot find such themes, or hints, or provokers 
in &mdash; </p> 

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">(Extract.)</hi> </p> 

<p>Can it be possible that its author intended this as a portion of a poem? Is it not more reasonable 
to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of 
his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is 
self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really 
assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The 
critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production 
as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly 
rare, and <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their GREAT 
UNTAMED. 
</p> 

<p>We must not neglect to quote an unusual passage, which may be suggestive to writers of the Old 
World. To silence our incredulous readers, we assure them that the passage may be found at page 
92. 
</p> 

<p><hi rend="italic">(Extract.)</hi> 
</p> 

<p>The transformation and the ethereal nature of Walt Whitman is marvellous to us, but perhaps not 
so to a nation from which the spirit-rappers sprung.

<p>We will neither weary nor insult our readers with more extracts from this notable book. Emerson 
<hi rend="italic">has praised it,</hi> and called it the "most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has 
yet contributed." Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous; 
but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of 
genius &mdash; if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and andacious 
egotism, their animal vigor, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet &mdash; then our 
studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon 
intellect, Shakspeare, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a 
poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, "the poet of the body." Adopt 
this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had 
commenced a notice of "LEAVES OF GRASS" in anger, we could not but dismiss it in grief, for 
its author, we have just discovered, is conscious of his affliction. He says, at page 33,

<title>LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York. </title> 
</head> 

<p>We have too long overlooked in this country the great poet who has recently arisen in America, 
of whom some of his countrymen speak in connection with Bacon and Shakspeare, whom others 
compare with Tennyson &mdash; much to the disadvantage of our excellent laureate &mdash; and to whom Mr. 
Emerson writes that he finds in his book. "incomparable things, said incomparably well." The 
book he pronounces "the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet 
contributed;" at which, indeed, says Mr. Emerson in the printed letter sent to us &mdash; "I 
rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion." 
</p> 

<p>No illusion truly is Walt Whitman, the new American prodigy, who, as he is himself candid 
enough to intimate, sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He is described by one 
of his own local papers as "a tenderly, affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral, 
susceptible, and imperious person," who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may 
be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough, 
according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author 
describes himself as "one of the roughs, a kosmos;" indeed, he seems to be very much impressed 
with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the 
portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a 
pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his 
forehead. 
</p> 

<p>On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Walt Whitman, this kosmos is 
"a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy." 
</p> 

<p>But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content, 
in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper of the West. We can 
describe him perfectly by a few suppositions. Suppose that Mr. Tupper had been brought up to 
the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time 
as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle? 
Suppose him maddened by this course of 


<pb n="379" id="Whi56LG387"/>

reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakspeare to 
boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own 
self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences? In that state he would write a book 
exactly like Walt Whitman's "LEAVES OF GRASS." 
</p> 
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extracts and Interlineated remarks</hi>.) 
</p> 

<p>We must be just to Walt Whitman in allowing that he has one positive merit. His verse has a 
purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies, 
his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his 
delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with 
fellow-men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest 
manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these "LEAVES OF 
GLASS." Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely 
obscene, and intentionally foulmouthed, as Walt Whitman is. 
</p> 
<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extracts and Interlineations</hi>.) 
</p> 

<p>In the construction of our artificial Whitman, we began with the requirement that a certain 
philosopher should have been bred to the business of an auctioneer. We must add now, to 
complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us, 
should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of 
Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general 
term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots 
included under it. Does Walt Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town 
lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns, 
waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, "a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye, a 
Louisianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sand-hills and pines," 
&#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. We will give an 
illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to 
things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however, 
to show how there 


<pb n="380" id="Whi56LG388"/>

arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental 
mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots. 
</p> 

<lg type="verse" n="1"> 
<l>The usual routine, the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk; </l>

<l>The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of hunting or fishing. </l>

<p rend="center">(<hi rend="italic">Extract continued</hi>.)</p> 

<p>Now let us compare with this a real auctioneer's catalogue. We will take that of Goldsmith's 
chambers, by way of departing as little as we can from the poetical. For, as Walt Whitman would 
say (and here we quote quite literally, prefixing only a verse of our own, from "A Catalogue of 
the Household Furniture with the select collection of scarce, curious, and valuable books of Dr. 
Goldsmith, deceased, which, by order of the admr, will be sold by auction, &#x0026;c.,

After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr. Good, the auctioneer who, at 
his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet Street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the 
summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit "the most extraordinary piece of wit 
and wisdom that" (according to Mr. Emerson) "America has yet contributed."

<p> 
<bibl>LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York, 1855. London: 
Horsell</bibl> 
</p> 

<p>"Latter-day poetry" in America is of a very different character from the same manifestation in the 
old country. Here, it is occupied for the most part with dreams of the middle ages, of the old 
knightly and religious times; in America it is employed chiefly with the present, except when it 
travels out into the undiscovered future. Here our latter-day poets are apt to whine over the times, 
as if heaven were perpetually betraying the earth with a show of progress that is in fact 
retrogression, like the backward advance of crabs; there, the minstrels of the stars and stripes 
blow a loud note of exultation before the grand new epoch, and think the Greeks and Romans, 
the early Oriental races, and the later men of the middle centuries, of small account before the 
onward tramping of these present generations. Of this latter sect is a certain phenomenon who 
has recently started up in Brooklyn, New York &mdash; one Walt Whitman, author of "LEAVES OF 
GRASS," who has been received by a section of his countrymen as a sort of prophet, and by 
Englishmen as a kind of fool. For ourselves, we are not disposed to accept him as the one, having 
less faith in latter-day prophets than in latter-day poets; but assuredly we cannot regard him as 
the other. Walt is one of the most amazing, one of the most startling, one of the most perplexing 
creations of the modern American mind; but he is no fool, though abundantly eccentric, nor is his 
book mere food for laughter, though undoubtedly containing much that may easily and fairly be 
turned into ridicule. 
</p> 

<p>The singularity of the author's mind &mdash; his utter disregard of ordinary forms and modes &mdash; appears in 
the very title-page and frontispicce of his work. Not only is there 


<pb n="382" id="Whi56LG390"/>

no author's name, (which in itself would not be singular) but there is no publisher's name &mdash; that of 
the English bookseller being a London addition. Fronting the title is the portrait of a bearded 
gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and a Spanish hat, with an all-pervading atmosphere of 
Yankeedoodle about him; but again there is no patronymic, and we can only infer that this 
roystering blade is the author of the book. Then follows a long prose treatise by way of preface 
(and here once more the anonymous system is carried out, the treatise having no heading 
whatever); and after that we have the poem, in the course of which a short autobiographical 
discourse reveals to us the name of the author. 
</p> 

<p>A passage from the Preface, if it may be so called, will give some insight into the character and 
objects of the work. 
</p> 

<p> 
Other states Indicate themselves in their deputies &mdash; but the genius of the United States is not best 
or most in its executives or legislatures nor in its ambassadors, or authors, or colleges, or 
churches, or pariors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors; but always most in the common 
people. Their manners, speech, dress, friendships; the freshness and candor of their 
physiognomy, the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom, 
their aversion to any thing indecorous, or soft, or mean &mdash; the practical acknowledgment of the 
citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states, the flerceness of their roused resentment, 
their curiosity and welcome of novelty, their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy, their 
susceptibility to a slight, the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the 
presence of superiors, the fluency of their speech, their delight in music, (the sure symptom of 
manly tenderness and native elegance of soul,) their good temper and open-handedness, the 
terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to 
him &mdash; these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of 
it. 
</p> 

<p>This "gigantic and generous treatment," we presume, is offered in the pages which ensue. The 
poem is written in wild, irregular, unrhymed, almost unmetrical "lengths," like the measured 
prose of Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper's <hi rend="italic">Proverbial Philosophy,</hi> or some of the Oriental 
writings. The external form, therefore, is startling, and by no means seductive, to English ears, 
accustomed to the sumptuous music of ordinary metre; and the central principle of the poem is 
equally staggering. It seems to resolve itself into an all-attracting egotism &mdash; an eternal presence of 
the individual soul of Walt Whitman in all things, yet in such wise that this one soul shall be 
presented as a type of all human souls whatsoever. He goes forth into the world, this rough, 


<pb n="383" id="Whi56LG391"/>

devil-may-care Yankee; passionately identifies himself with all forms of being, sentient or 
inanimate; sympathizes deeply with humanity; riots with a kind of Bacchanal fury in the force 
and fervor of his own sensations; will not have the most vicious or abandoned shut out from final 
comfort and reconciliation; is delighted with Broadway, New York, and equally in love with the 
desolate back-woods, and the long stretch of the uninhabited prairie, where the wild beasts 
wallow in the reeds, and the wilder birds start upward from their nests among the grass; 
perceives a divine mystery wherever his feet conduct or his thoughts transport him; and beholds 
all things tending toward the central and sovereign Me. Such, as we conceive, is the key to this 
strange, grotesque, and bewildering book; yet we are far from saying that the key will unlock all 
the quirks and oddities of the volume. Much remains of which we confess we can make nothing; 
much that seems to us purely fantastical and preposterous; much that appears to our muddy 
vision gratuitously prosaic, needlessly plain-speaking, disgusting without purpose, and singular 
without result. There are so many evidences of a noble soul in Whitman's pages that we regret 
these aberrations, which only have the effect of discrediting what is genuine by the show of 
something false; and especially do we deplore the unnecessary openness with which Walt reveals 
to us matters which ought rather to remain in sacred silence. It is good not to be ashamed of 
Nature; it is good to have an allinclusive charity; but it is also good, sometimes, to leave the veil 
across the Temple.

<p>We were attracted by the very singular title of the work, to seek the work itself. and what we 
thought ridiculous in the title is eclipsed in the pages of this heterogeneous mass of bombast, 
egotism, vulgarity, and nonsense. The beastliness of the author is set forth in his own description 
of himself, and we can conceive no better reward than the lash for such a violation of decency as 
we have before us. Speaking of "this mass of stupid filth," the <hi rend="italic">Criterion</hi> says: "It is 
impossible to imagine how any man's fancy 


<pb n="384" id="Whi56LG392"/>

could have conceived it, unless he were possessed of the soul of a sentimental donkey that had 
died of disappointed love." 
</p> 

<p>This book should find no place where humanity urges any claim to respect, and the author should 
be kicked from all decent society as below the level of the brute. There is neither wit nor method 
in his disjointed babbling, and it seems to us he must be some escaped lunatic, raving in pitiable 
delirium.
