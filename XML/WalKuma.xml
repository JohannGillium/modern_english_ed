I have left the World, and it is my business now to say such prayers; but

There is no need to know his name. He is buried in that tomb over there, 
among the rushes to this side of the pine tree. It is because he cannot 
get free

 that he needs your prayers.

<stage> 
They go into the cottage, which is represented by a wicker framework at 
the front. 
</stage> 
 
<p> 
Listen! I thought you were taking me to where there would be a chapel, so 
that I could begin my prayers. But here I can see no painted picture nor 
carven image that I could put up. There is nothing on the wall but a great 
pike,   &mdash;   no handstaff, but only an iron crowbar; and other weapons of 
war are nailed up. What is the reason of this? 
</p> 
</sp>

<sp> 
<speaker>Kumasaka</speaker> 
<p> 
You must know that when I first took the vows of priesthood I went round 
from village to village here, to Tarui, Auhaka and Akasaka   &mdash;   there is 
no end to them, but I know all the roads,   &mdash;   through the tall grass at 
Aono and the thick woods of Koyasu, night or day, rain or fine. For I was 
a hill-bandit in those days, a thief of the night, tilting baggage from 
mules' backs; even stripping servant-girls of their clothes, as they went 
from farm to farm, and leaving them sobbing. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Then it was that I used to take with me that pike there and waving it in 
their faces, "Stand and deliver!" I would cry. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
But at last a time came when it was not so. 
<ref target="n62.1">[2]</ref> 
 And after that time I was glad enough to find shelter even in such a 
place as this. I yielded my will and was content. For at last I had indeed 
resolved to leave the hateful World. 
</p>

"But I must have done, or dawn will find me talking still. Go to your 
rest, Sir; and I too will doze awhile." So he spoke, and seemed to go into 
the bedroom. But suddenly the cottage vanished: nothing was left but the 
tall grass. It was under the shadow of a pine-tree that he 
<ref target="n63.4">[7]</ref> 
 had rested!

I have seen strange things. I cannot sleep, no, not even for a while as

<l>But Ushiwaka parried it lightly and sprang to the left.</l> 
<l>Kumasaka was after him in a moment, and as he sprang nimbly over the 
pike 
<ref target="n67.1">[11]</ref></l> 
<l>Turned the point towards him.</l> 
<l>But as he drew back the pike, Ushiwaka crossed to the right.</l> 
<l>Then levelling the pike, Kumasaka struck a great blow.</l> 
<l>This time the boy parried it with a blow that disengaged them,</l> 
<l>And springing into the air leapt hither and thither with invisible 
speed.</l> 
<l>And while the robber sought him,</l> 
<l>The wonderful boy pranced behind and stuck his sword through a chink in 
his coat of mail.</l> 
<l>"Hey, what is that?" cried Kumasaka. "Has this urchin touched me?"</l> 
<l>And he was very angry.</l> 
<l>But soon Heaven's fatal ordinance was sealed by despair:</l> 
<milestone unit="speech" n="Kuma2-31"/>
<l>"This sword-play brings me no advantage," he cried; "I will wrestle 
with him."</l> 
<l>Then he threw away his pike, and spreading out his great hands,</l> 
 
 
<pb n="68"/>  
<l>Down this corridor and into this corner he chased him, but when he 
would have grasped him,</l> 
<l>Like lightning, mist, moonlight on the water,   &mdash;   </l> 
<l>The eye could see, but the hand could not touch.</l>
