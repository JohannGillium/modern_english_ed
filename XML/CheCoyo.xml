	<head>HOW SQUIRE COYOTE BROUGHT FIRE TO THE CAHROCS.</head>
<note><p>[illustration omitted]</p></note>

<l>IN the beginning Chareya made fire </l>
<l>(That is, the Cahrocs say so), </l>
<l>Housed it safe with two beldams dire, </l>
<l>And meant to have it stay so. </l>
<l>But the Cahrocs declared that fire should be free, </l>
<l>Not jealously kept under lock and key. </l>
<l>Crafty Squire Coyote, </l>
<l>&mdash;Counselor of note, he,&mdash; </l>
<l>Just such a case he was meant for: </l>
<l>Forthwith his honor was sent for. </l>

<l>Squire Coyote came.  On hearing the case, </l>
<l>The cunningest smile passed over his face; </l>
<l>Then, slyly winking, </l>
<l>In the midst of his thinking </l>
<l>He stopt, stopt short. </l>
<l>An emphatic snort, </l>
<l>And said he: "Tight spot, </l>
<l>'Twere vain to conceal it: </l>
<l>Very sorry you're in it. </l>
<l>But, though tight as a Gordian knot, </l>
<l>What are you 'bout </l>
<l>That you don't get out? </l>
<l>It's only the work of a minute: </l>
<l>The way to get fire is to&mdash;<hi rend="italic">steal</hi> it." </l>
<l>Squire Coyote was right&mdash;every Cahroc knew it, </l>
<l>But (bless them!) how were they going to do it? </l>
<l>"Ah!" said Coyote, </l>
<l>Stroking his goatee </l>
<pb n="394"/> <note><p>[illustration omitted]</p></note>
<l>And taking his hat, </l>
<l>"Let me 'tend to that." </l>
<l>Then, airily bowing to left and right, </l>
<l>He scampered away, and was out of sight. </l>

<l>Fire for the Cahroc nation! </l>
<l>Coyote made preparation. </l>
<l>From the land of the Cahrocs afar to the East </l>
<l>&mdash;The rogue, he knew every inch of the road&mdash; </l>
<l>Was stationed, now here, now there, a beast, </l>
<l>All the way to the hut where the hags abode. </l>
<l>The weaklings farthest off he put, </l>
<l>The strong ones nearest the witches' hut; </l>
<l>And lastly, hard by the guarded den, </l>
<l>Placed one of the sinewy Cahroc men. </l>

<l>This done, up he trotted, and tapped, </l>
<l>The gentlest possible, rapped </l>
<l>At the old crones' smoky door. </l>
<l>"Beg pardon for being so bold; </l>
<l>Fact is, I am numb with cold: </l>
<l>Pray give me a bed on your floor." </l>
<l>The trick succeeded; they let him in, </l>
<l>And, snug at the feet of the beldams dire, </l>
<l>He stretched his length to the open fire. </l>

<l>Not long he lay, when, oh, the din, </l>
<l>The drubbing sudden heard outside! </l>
<l>Such a bumping and banging, </l>
<l>Such a whacking and whanging! </l>
<l>"Itch to your skins!" the witches cried, </l>
<l>And rushed from the hut to see </l>
<l>What the horrible noise could be. </l>

<l>Now, it was only the Cahroc man </l>
<l>Playing his part of Coyote's plan; </l>
<l>But the simple old crones, you can well understand, </l>
<pb n="395"/>
<l>Didn't see through it, </l>
<l>And, before they knew it, </l>
<l>Coyote was off with a half-burnt brand, </l>
<l>Twitching and whisking it, </l>
<l>Switching and frisking it, </l>
<l>The best he knew, </l>
<l>Away he flew, </l>
<l>The Cahrocs' laughter </l>
<l>And the crones close after. </l>
<note><p>[illustration omitted]</p></note>

<l>Over hill and dale, </l>
<l>Like a comet's tail, </l>
<l>Sweeps the borrowed brand </l>
<l>Toward Cahroc-land. </l>
<l>But the crones are fleet and strong, </l>
<l>And it can't be long </l>
<l>Before Coyote is made to feel </l>
<l>How wicked a thing it is to steal. </l>
<l>His spindling pegs </l>
<l>&mdash;Mere spider legs&mdash; </l>
<l>Nature never designed 'em </l>
<l>To match the big shanks behind 'em. </l>

<l>He runs as never wolf ran; </l>
<l>Every muscle and nerve, </l>
<l>All his wild-wood verve, </l>
<l>Is put to the strain; </l>
<l>But, scratch it the fastest he can, </l>
<l>The gray hags gain. </l>
<l>And the race must soon be over. </l>
<l>Race over?  See there&mdash;who's that? </l>
<l>Zounds!  What a monstrous cat! </l>
<l>It's the cougar sprung from his cover. </l>
<l>Ha, ha!  All but from the head crone's hand </l>
<l>His jaws have rescued the precious brand, </l>
<l>And he's off like shot! </l>
<l>"On time to a dot," </l>
<l>Coughs Coyote, clearing the soot </l>
<l>From his throat and the specks from his eyes; </l>
<l>"Bravo, my gallant brute!&mdash; </l>
<l>And still the good fire flies!" </l>

<l>Fly it had to.  You wouldn't believe old bones </l>
<l>Could scuttle as now did the legs of the crones. </l>
<l>The witches were marvelous fleet and strong, </l>
<l>But, you see, the line of the beasts was too long: </l>
<l>From the cougar the brand was passed to the bear, </l>
<l>And so on down to the fox, to the hare, </l>
<l>Thence on and on, till, flat in their tracks, </l>
<l>The crones collapsed like empty sacks. <pb n="396"/>  </l>
<l>Thus the brand was brought from the bel-dams' den </l>
<l>Safe to the homes of the Cahroc men. </l>

<l>And only two mishaps </l>
<l>'Mongst all the scampering chaps </l>
<l>That, each from the proper place, </l>
<l>Took his turn in the fire-brand chase. </l>
<l>The squirrel, as sudden he whirled, </l>
<l>Turning a corner of stumps and bowlders, </l>
<l>Burned his beautiful tail, so it curled </l>
<l>Clean over his back, </l>
<l>And scorched a brown track, </l>
<l>Still seen (tail also) over his shoulders. </l>

<l>The frog, poor thing! </l>
<l>His was a harder fate. </l>
<l>Small as smallest coal in the grate </l>
<l>Was the brand when he got it. </l>
<l>Jump and spring </l>
<l>He did, till he thought it </l>
<l>Was safe; when, pounce, like a stone, </l>
<l>Fell the claws of the foremost crone. </l>
<l>At last </l>
<l>He was fast; </l>
<l>No sort of use </l>
<l>To try to get loose. </l>
<l>His eyeballs bulged, his little heart thumped&mdash; </l>
<l>'Most broke his ribs, so hard it bumped. </l>
<l>So frightened he was, that, down to this day, </l>
<l>He looks very much in the same scared way. </l>

<l>The frog was caught, </l>
<l>Was squeezed </l>
<l>Till he wheezed; </l>
<l>But not too tight </l>
<l>For just a mite </l>
<l>Of ranine thought: </l>
<l>"Co-roak, chug, choke, </l>
<l>Granny Hag, good joke. </l>
<l>Well you've followed it; </l>
<l>So move up your hand </l>
<l>And take your old brand"&mdash; </l>
<l>Then he swallowed it! </l>
<l>And before the crone could wholly recover </l>
<l>From the sight of such a wonder, </l>
<l>Slipping her fingers from under, </l>
<l>He plunged into a pool all over. </l>
<l>He had saved the brand, </l>
<l>But the witch's hand </l>
<l>Still clutched his special pride and care&mdash; </l>
<l>His tail, piteously wriggling there. </l>
<l>Henceforth&mdash;he must grin and bear it&mdash; </l>
<l>The tadpole alone was to wear it. </l>

<l>At length, when the crones had gone, </l>
<l>He sought an old log, and got on: </l>
<l>"Rather short of beauty, </l>
<l>But I did my duty; </l>
<l>That's enough for a frog." </l>
<l>Then he spat on the log, </l>
<l>Spat the swallowed spark </l>
<l>Well into its bark. </l>

<l>Fire, fire to your heart's desire; </l>
<l>Fire, fire for the world entire: </l>
<l>It's free as air to everybody, </l>
<l>White man or Cahroc, wise man or noddy. </l>

<l>From the beldams' den, </l>
<l>A gift to all men, </l>
<l>Coyote brought it. </l>
<l>In the wettest weather </l>
<l>Rub two sticks together, </l>
<l>Presto&mdash;you've got it! </l>
