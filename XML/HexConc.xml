<head>AFRICAN INDEPENDENT CHURCH:</head>

<p>since the late nineteenth century thousands of NEW
RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS have developed in Africa all of which claim to be CHRISTIAN yet they
reject traditional MISSIONARY Churches and attempt to incorporate many TRADITIONAL African
BELIEFS and practices into their WORSHIP and THEOLOGY. Most of these Churches are
thoroughly Christian although some are clearly closer to AFRICAN TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS
than to CHRISTIANITY.</p>

</div2>
<div2 id="d48" type="entry">
<head>AFRICAN RELIGIONS:</head>

<p>although some books speak about "African religion"
it is clear that there are many religions in Africa. The main ones are AFRICAN TRADITIONAL
RELIGIONS, CHRISTIANITY and ISLAM. The study of African religions is greatly neglected in
religious studies where a tendency exists to GROUP many diverse TRADITIONS together as
"African religion." No serious scholar suggests that the religions of
India&mdash;BUDDHISM, the HINDU TRADITION, JAINISM, etc.,&mdash;can be treated as essentially one
religion, even though they share many similar concepts; e.g. KARMA, MEDITATION or YOGA.
Yet African religions are frequently treated as fundamentally "the same" perhaps
because of a subconscious belief that while Indian religions represent profound
philosophical traditions, African religions are judged "primitive." In fact
African traditions are highly complex and deserve much better treatment than they have
received from Western scholars in the past.</p>

</div2>
<div2 id="d49" type="entry">
<head>AFRICAN TRADITIONAL RELIGIONS:</head>

<p>the RELIGIONS of African peoples have developed
within various African CULTURES without being influenced by major world religions such as
CHRISTIANITY, HINDUISM or ISLAM. Although there is an infinite variety of traditional
religions in Africa, beliefs such as WITCHCRAFT and the role of the ancestors seem to be
common themes in many societies. African traditional religions stress healing and the
spiritual well-being of people and are usually expressed through dance and music. Healers,
PROPHETS and other RITUAL specialists play an important role in these religions although
not all have people easily identified as PRIESTS. The main religious divisions in Africa
follow geographic lines and are North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa and
South Africa. In many ways East and Southern African Traditional Religions, which lack
professional Priests, share common elements which make them quite distinct from West and
North African religions, where professional Priests play an important role in traditional
religious practices.</p>

<p>this is the title of the IMMS of Nizaris, first given to Hasan 'Ali

<head>AHMADIYA:</head>

<p>an Islamic SECT considered HERETICAL by the ORTHODOX established in nineteenth
century India by MIRZA GHULAM AHMAD. It began as a revitalization movement within ISLAM
but in 1889 Ahmad claimed to have received a REVELATION giving him the right to receive
homage and claimed to be the MAHDI or world teacher expected by ZOROASTRIANS, HINDUS and
BUDDHISTS. He said he was an AVATAR of KRISHNA, who had come in the SPIRIT of MUHAMMAD.
Defending his BELIEFS against the ORTHODOX, he held that <hi rend="italic">Sura</hi> LXI, in the <hi rend="italic">QURA'N</hi>
speaks of him. He claimed his personality had been merged with that of MUHAMMAD, so to
call him a PROPHET did not contradict ISLAMIC BELIEF. He is believed to have performed
SIGNS and MIRACLES as proof of his AUTHORITY. After his death, his son, BASHIR AL-DIN
MAHMUD AHMAD, was appointed his successor. The movement's MISSIONS have spread to many
parts of the world and its teachings can be found in <hi rend="italic">The Teachings of Islam</hi>
(Ahmad, 1963). Regarding CHRISTIANITY, Ghulam Ahmad taught that JESUS was crucified, but
taken from the cross alive. Resuscitated Jesus went to Kashmir where he preached, married
and died at the age of 120.</p>

centuries before being brutally suppressed by the INQUISITION. It professed a FORM of
MANICHAEAN DUALISM which regarded CHRIST as an ANGEL with a phantom body, proclaimed that
the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH was corrupt, and taught a form of ESOTERIC and OCCULT knowledge

the action of transferring the ownership of anything to another; (4) loss of connection
with one's own deepest feelings and needs. HEGEL and MARX argued that what is alienated is
an essential part of human nature and that the process of alienation must be seen
historically. FEUERBACH described God as the product of human alienation in the sense of
His being a projection of the highest human ATTRIBUTES from people to a divine BEING. Marx
said man creates himself by creating his world, but in class-society is alienated from his

The method reads a text presupposing that its apparent meaning conceals another
"deeper" meaning or "true" meaning; e.g. instead of treating the story
DAVID in HISTORICAL terms, allegorical interpretation sees his life story in terms of the
PILGRIMAGE of the SOUL towards final SALVATION.</p>

comprehensive account of human experience and REALITY: a WORLDVIEW or WELTANSCHAUUNG. The aim of analytic philosophy is to clarify the logical status of various kinds of utterances
and to eliminate PARADOXES and confusions arising when the limits and function of language
are not observed; e.g. what does it mean to say that "GOD is merciful?" Is this
the same kind of statement as "the Judge is merciful?"</p>

<head>ANICCA:</head>

<p>key BUDDHIST doctrine regarding the impermanence of all things which
FORMS the first of the three characteristic marks of EXISTENCE. It is a feature of all
existence which Buddhists claim can be observed empirically thus providing evidence for
Buddhist claims about the NATURE of the UNIVERSE. Everything is in a state of FLUX but
more importantly the mind, or consciousness, is essentially impermanent and consciousness
arises or ceases from moment to moment. Recognition of the impermanence of physical things
is easy, but to also see that consciousness is similar is much more difficult and one of
the tasks of BUDDHISM. Only when this is done can the INDIVIDUAL go on to recognize that
there is no permanent SELF or that there is no such thing as a SOUL. Everything, including
individual consciousness, is impermanent. This doctrine separates Buddhism from all other
RELIGIONS in that it denies the essential spiritual nature of the person and sees such
BELIEFS as an illusion which binds sentient BEINGS to EXISTENCE.</p>

<div2 id="d102" type="entry">
<head>ANIMISM:</head>

<p>a very misleading term often used to characterize African and other
non-literate religious systems. The term was first introduced by Sir Edward B. TYLOR as a
"minimum definition" of RELIGION. He argued that from sleep experiences, such as
dreams etc., "primitive man" developed the idea of <hi rend="italic">"anima"</hi> or
the spiritual principle which animates material objects. Thus rivers, trees, stones, the
sun, moon, and SACRED objects such as masks, were said to possess spiritual power caused
by the indwelling of SPIRIT BEINGS. These ideas, Tylor argued, produced fear which led to
WORSHIP and the development of religion. Today the term animism has fallen into disuse
among serious scholars of religion although it is still retained by some MISSIOLOGISTS.
The reason most academics have rejected this term is because it fails to recognize the
highly complex NATURE of many non-literate religions which do not rely on simplistic
notions of the spiritual world. The idea behind animism is in fact a racist one which
assumes that non-literate peoples lack the INTELLECTUAL ability to develop complex
religions and PHILOSOPHIES. It is therefore best abandoned to allow for the recognition of
the complexity of religious systems. The British anthropologist E. E. EVANS-PRITCHARD did
more than anyone else to dispel simplistic notions about "primitive religion" in
books such as <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft Oracles and Magic Among the Azande</hi> (1936) and <hi rend="italic">Nuer

<p>known by his contemporaries as "Doctor
Angelicus" he is the most important philosopher and theologian of the ROMAN CATHOLIC
TRADITION. Educated by BENEDICTINES and DOMINICANS he studied in Paris and Cologne. Later
he taught in Paris 1252-59, 1269-72; and Italy 1259-69, 1272-74. He was responsible for
"baptizing" the PHILOSOPHY of ARISTOTLE which he made the basis of Roman
Catholic THEOLOGY and APOLOGETICS. His Aristotelianism was opposed by the FRANCISCANS, but
his teachings were made the official doctrine of the Dominican Order. He was canonized in
1323 and made a Doctor of the Church in 1567. Finally, the study of Thomas Aquinas was
made part of all theological training in 1366. Made patron of all Roman Catholic
universities in 1880. His authority as teacher was reaffirmed in 1923. In his thought the
relation of REASON to FAITH is one of subalternation, in which the lower (reason) accepts
principles of the higher (faith). He rejected ANSELM of CANTERBURY'S ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT
preferring the COSMOLOGICAL and TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS for the EXISTENCE of GOD. For
Aquinas there is a level of knowledge attainable by REASON alone; another attainable by

<head>ARCANE SCHOOL:</head>

<p>the organization established in 1923 by Alice BAILEY to propagate
a FORM of THEOSOPHY and the teachings of the GREAT WHITE BROTHERHOOD. Originally part of
the THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY proper. Bailey clashed with Annie BESANT over Besant's BELIEF
that Jiddu KRISHNAMURTI was the expected world savior. Instead she received SPIRITUALIST
communications promising the return of CHRIST in the form of the Buddhist BODHISATTVA
MAITREYA. In recent years Benjamin Creme has claimed that he is the fulfillment of this

<head>ARIANISM:</head>

<p>CHRISTIANITY'S most troublesome schism named after its principle
exponent ARIUS who was a thorough-going Greek RATIONALIST who inherited the almost
universally held LOGOS CHRISTOLOGY of the Eastern Roman Empire. He contended that GOD was
immutable and unknowable therefore CHRIST had to be a created BEING made by God as the
first in the created order. The ORTHODOX counter-attack on Arianism pointed out that Arian
THEOLOGY reduced CHRIST to a demigod and in effect reintroduced POLYTHEISM into
Christianity because Christ was worshipped among Arians. Politically, Arianism has been
accused of seeing the Emperor as a semi-divine BEING and promoting the sacralization of
the State. In February 325, Arius was condemned as a heretic at a Synod in Antioch. The
Emperor Constantine, who was sympathetic to Arianism, then called the first ECUMENICAL
council&mdash;known as the Council of Nicaea&mdash;which met in May 325 and also condemned Arius and
his teachings, but instead of resolving the issues, the Council launched an Empire-wide
Christological debate during which it often seemed that Arianism would triumph as the
dominant form of Christianity. Only after a hundred years of heated debate did ORTHODOXY
emerge triumphant. Today, a FORM of Arianism has been revived among UNITARIANS and the
JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES. Wild claims are also made by various OCCULT groups about Arianism as
a persecuted source of occult knowledge.</p>

<head>ARISTOBULUS OF PANEAS (3rd-2nd Century B.C.):</head>

<p>JEWISH Alexandrian philosopher who

the true source of many philosophical ideas among the Greeks. He is known to have written

</div2>
<div2 id="d140" type="entry">
<head>ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.):</head>

<p>born in the Greek colony of Stagira. He was sent to
Athens at the age of 18 where he remained in close association with the ACADEMY of PLATO
for twenty years. The logic of Aristotle, called "ANALYTIC" is, he argued, a
discipline prior to all others because it sets forth the requirements of scientific
inquiry and proof. Aristotelian logic depends on formal relations and the possibility of
discovering principles, i.e. UNIVERSALS and CAUSES. Aristotle is fond of tracing the
transition in knowledge from the particulars of sense experience&mdash;the things we can
know&mdash;to the universals which are grasped by INTUITIVE reason. For Aristotle every
sensible object is a union of two principles, MATTER and FORM. Matter is regarded as
potentiality the form which actualizes it. The fact of motion or change is then accounted
for as a process by which potential BEING passes over through form into actual being.
Aristotle has had a long and profound influence on Western THEOLOGY especially since his
work was used as the basis of theological reflection by Thomas AQUINAS in the twelfth
century. Aristotle's philosophy provides the basis for many classical APOLOGETIC arguments
including the COSMOLOGICAL and TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENTS for BELIEF in GOD who Aristotle
called "the unmoved Mover." His ideas also lent legitimation to the ROMAN
CATHOLIC doctrine of TRANSUBSTANTIATION and not surprisingly were strongly rejected by
early PROTESTANT REFORMERS such as Martin LUTHER and John CALVIN. They were reinstated as
the basis for CHRISTIAN scholarship by later reformers and are the official basis for
Roman Catholic teachings. </p>

<head>ARMINIANISM:</head>

<p>a general term embracing the teachings of Jacobus ARMINIUS. The
THEOLOGICAL views of Arminius and his followers were summed up in five points which were
designed to counter the prevailing CALVINIST ORTHODOXY of his day. They are: (1) GOD from
all ETERNITY predestined to ETERNAL LIFE those of whom He foresaw would remain steadfast
in FAITH to their end; (2) CHRIST died for all mankind, not only the elect; (3) through
free will Man cooperates in his CONVERSION; (4) humans may RESIST divine GRACE; (5) humans
may FALL from divine grace. At the SYNOD OF DORT the Arminian teachings were condemned as
heretical by orthodox CALVINISTS. Today, Arminianism is the major theological force among
North American EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS.</p>

French REVOLUTION, he was shocked by DEMOCRACY in America and propounded a sophisticated
snobbery in the guise of an attack on the "philistinism" of the English middle
classes. In fact, his ideals are a continuation of the destructive social views of his
father. He dabbled in THEOLOGY opposing TRADITIONAL ORTHODOXY in a desire to dispense with

<p>champion of ORTHODOXY against ARIANISM. He was
Egyptian by birth but Greek by education. Athanasius took no official part in the
proceedings of the Council of Nicea but as secretary to BISHOP Alexander, his notes,
circulars, and encyclicals had an important effect on the outcome of the Council. Because
Arianism had a wide following in the Empire and the sympathies of Roman Emperors,
Athanasius was hounded through five exiles totalling seventeen years of flight and hiding.
His later years were spent peacefully at Alexandria. Almost single-handedly Athanasius
saved the CHRISTIAN CHURCH from the PAGAN intellectualism of Arianism. As a young man he

Some Roman writers, however, began to take it literally but it was not until the

<p>the greatest of the Latin CHRISTIAN Fathers and

Berber descent and almost certainly Black. His mother, Monica, was a Christian whose
virtues he praised. But at Carthage he was drawn into sexual excesses:  later, while
studying RHETORIC and PHILOSOPHY, he came under the influence of MANICHAEISM followed by
NEOPLATONISM. In the spring of 387, after many sessions with AMBROSE, BISHOP of MILAN, and
the study of the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi>, Augustine was BAPTIZED. These events are recorded in his <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi>
which is a spiritual classic and the first real work of Christian autobiography. His
CHRISTIANITY remained strongly ASCETIC and his writings display a remarkably African
ethos. In 396 he was consecrated BISHOP of HIPPO and remained a PASTOR until his death.
For more than thirty years Augustine was the leading the theologian in African
Christianity. In 410 the Goths sacked Rome and the PAGANS blamed the Christians whose GOD
they said caused the disaster. Augustine put the capstone on his theological activity by
defending the Christians against this charge in his great work <hi rend="italic">The City of God</hi>.
Augustine's THEOLOGY helped bring about the PROTESTANT REFORMATION and deeply influenced

<head>BAH&Amacr;'&Imacr; FAITH:</head>

<p>a NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT originating from ISLAM and considered HERETICAL
by the ORTHODOX. It was founded in Persia by BAH&Amacr; 'ULL&Amacr;H (1817-1892) who suffered
imprisonment and exile for his beliefs. Towards the end of his life he lived at Bahji near
Acre where he wrote <hi rend="italic">Kit&amacr;b-i-&Imacr;q&amacr;n</hi> (Book of Certitude), which is the book of
Baha'u'llah's laws and contains many of the basic teachings of his&nbsp; religion, in
addition to numerous other works including the other major doctrinal work the <hi rend="italic">Kitab-i-Aqdas
</hi>(Most Holy Book) which codifies Baha'i laws. The <hi rend="italic">Iqan</hi> was written before
Baha'ullah announced himself as a prophet and concentrates on the interpretation of
Biblical and Quranic symbolism, the mystical path, theological concepts and issues. GOD is
held to be transcendent and unknowable; but makes Himself manifest by His creation and
especially by prophets who are a mirror in which God, the will and attributes, are
reflected. The movement seeks (1) universal peace, (2) holding to unity of the human race,
(3) advocating removal of prejudice, (4) teaching that all religions have an essential
unity, and (5) the establishment of an international body similar to the United Nations,
(6) the creation and use of a universal language. Before his death he appointed his son,
'Abbas Effendi (ABDU'L-BAHA), as his successor and the recognized interpreter of his
writings. 'Abbas Effendi appointed his grandson, Shoghi Effendi, as "The Guardian of
the Baha'i Faith" and official interpreter of the religion, he also undertook
MISSIONARY work in Europe and America. Today the movement is led by a nine member body,
the Universal House of Justice, which is elected every five years from members around the
world. The movement has spread widely in Europe, America, Africa and in Eastern countries.
The administrative center is at Haifa, Israel.</p>

<head>BAPTISM:</head>

<p>RITUAL immersion or sprinkling with water symbolic of REPENTANCE and NEW
BIRTH. It developed in JUDAISM prior to the time of JESUS and became a central practice in
the work of JOHN THE BAPTIST and became the CHRISTIAN RITUAL of INITIATION. Within
CHRISTIANITY strong DOCTRINAL disputes exist as to both the mode and appropriate subjects
of baptism. Until the REFORMATION most Christian groups baptized entire families including
children. Sectarian groups, later to be known as BAPTISTS, objected to this practice
claiming that BELIEF was a necessary prerequisite for baptism. Defenders of infant baptism
argue either that the act itself mystically REGENERATES the individual, or that the
practice is justified in terms of GOD'S COVENANT with the CHURCH. Advocates of infant
baptism usually accept sprinkling as an acceptable mode of baptism on the grounds that
this was common in JUDAISM. Baptists usually insist on adult baptism by total immersion. </p>

although individual Churches are linked to associations of various kinds. Early on they
split into two groups:  General Baptists which are ARMINIAN in THEOLOGY and Particular
Baptists which are CALVINIST. Today, Baptists form a loose family of Churches with their
main numerical base in the USA. Although there are international and national bodies many
Baptist Churches belong to neither, hence the great diversity of belief and practice.</p>

For many modern Hindus it represents the ESSENCE of their religion with its message that

On the eve of the battle of Kuruksetra, Arjuna has scruples about the prospect of killing
his fellow men, some of whom are his kinsmen, but he is told by Krishna that he must
perform his duty in a disinterested way appropriate to his CASTE as a warrior. The

explaining away references to PROPHECY and MIRACLES on literary and textual grounds.
Eventually ORTHODOX scholars also accepted the validity of many methods created by the
Biblical critics to answer such questions as:  "What are the most reliable and
trustworthy texts of the <hi rend="italic">HEBREW BIBLE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">NEW TESTAMENT</hi>? What is the
relationship between the various books? When and by whom were the texts written and for
what purpose? What are the sources, if any, the authors used? What is the relationship of
these sources to other oral and written materials of the time?" Biblical criticism
today is understood as the application of general historical principles and RATIONALIST
assumptions to the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi> and has evolved into various sub-disciplines such as <hi rend="italic">redaction
criticism, source criticism, form criticism, literary criticism</hi>, etc.
CONSERVATIVE scholars often make a distinction between "higher criticism" which  n
they see as essentially rationalist and "lower criticism" which is understood as
a legitimate quest for textual purity.</p>

<head>BIORYTHEMS:</head>

<p>a fad of the 1970s NEW AGE MOVEMENT which sought to find links between
human emotional changes, physical well-being, etc., and a rhythmic cycle in nature. The
idea goes back to a nineteenth century physician Wilhelm Fliess whose work was popularized
by George S. Thommen in various books published in the late 1960s and 1970s. There seems
to be no scientific basis for this view and it is rapidly loosing popularity through its

Bishop; later on Bishops came to control a specific territory or DIOCESE, then Archbishops
and eventually the POPE were added by the Western Church. In the East, Bishops retained
much of their earlier status and powers. Bishops had the power to ordain PRIESTS and were
the guardians of ORTHODOX DOCTRINE.</p>

<div2 id="d314" type="entry">
<head>BUDDHISM:</head>

<p>the Western name for what is generally known in Asia as the Buddha-asana, the
RELIGION or discipleship of the BUDDHA. Buddhism appears to have originated in north-east
India in the sixth century B.C. and according to TRADITION was the result of the religious
experience of GAUTAMA a young prince and son of a ruler of the akya tribe. His home was in
the foothills of the Himalayas but his awaking or ENLIGHTENMENT occurred at a place now
known as Bodh-Gay, on the banks of one of the southern tributaries of the Ganges. The
doctrine which he began to preach is known as the DHAMMA (Dharma) and consists of an
analysis of the human situation, existence, and personality to provide a means whereby the
suffering and mortality of mankind may be transcended and a new state of BEING achieved.
The Buddha's personality and preaching attracted disciples, who were subsequently
organized into communities known as the SAGHA. The doctrine was independent of belief in a
CREATOR GOD, priestly rites or functions. It was regarded by contemporary HINDU priests
(BRAHMAN) as HERETICAL. In many discourses (Sutta) the Buddha is represented as engaging
in controversy with BRAHMANS. The new community of the Sagha was an egalitarian society in
which CASTE differences were disregarded.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d315" type="entry">
<head>BUDDHIST SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT:</head>

<p>the first major division in the SAGHA is traditionally
connected with the Council of Vai&sacute;&amacr;l&imacr; approximately 100 years after death of the BUDDHA (383
BC). Disagreement arose concerning degree of strictness with which monastic discipline was
to be observed. The dissenting body henceforth became known as the Mah&amacr;saghikas&mdash;the Great
Sagha Party&mdash;since they claimed a greater following for their more LIBERAL interpretation
of the rules. The Sthaviras (Elders) were the stricter more CONSERVATIVE group which
subsequently divided into eighteen different schools, among the more important of which
were the THERAV&Amacr;DINS. The Mahsaghikas also divided into numerous separate schools, the most
important being the Lokottaravdins, Praj&ntilde;aptivdins and the Caitiyas. The MAH&Amacr;Y&Amacr;NA developed
out of the Mahsaghikas tradition although its origins are obscure. The two principal
Mahyna schools in India were the M&Amacr;DHYAMIKA and the YOG&Amacr;C&Amacr;RAS. In China and Japan, Mahyna
developed into a number of schools notably the T'ien-t'ai or TENDAI, CH'AN or ZEN,
Ch&ecirc;n-yen or SHINGON, the PURE LAND, and the NICHIREN.</p>

<head>CALENDAR:</head>

<p>most traditional religions follow a LITURGICAL calendar. In ISLAM a lunar
calendar is still used to set the dates and times for important feasts and fasting such as
RAMADAM; in CHRISTIANITY the calendar is fixed. There are differences in usage between
Western and Eastern Churches resulting in different dates for CHRISTMAS and EASTER. The
purpose of a religious calendar is to instill in the minds of people the great events of a
RELIGION by the repetition of religious acts and ceremonies spread throughout the year.
Thus in Christianity there is ADVENT, or the time preceding the BIRTH of JESUS when the
prophecies of the <hi rend="italic">HEBREW BIBLE</hi> are remembered, followed by CHRISTMAS which
celebrates the birth of CHRIST and lead on to LENT when His temptations and earthly life
is remembered leading up to EASTER when the death and RESURRECTION of JESUS is meditated
on. Finally there is PENTECOST&mdash;or WHITSUN&mdash;when the ASCENSION and heavenly reign of
CHRIST comes into play. Liturgical Churches have various SAINTS days added to commemorate

Developing charismatic gifts, the group then began to encourage "prophecy." This

<head>CHINESE RELIGIONS:</head>

<p>scholars have traditionally held the view that there were three
major religious TRADITIONS in China:  BUDDHISM, CONFUCIANISM and TAOISM. Today this view is
challenged by a much more complex one which sees the Chinese religious tradition
dynamically incorporating various religious traditions within Chinese religion. The cult

which took differing forms as political dynasties changed.</p>

<head>COMPARATIVE RELIGION:</head>

<p>the study of comparative religion began with the Greek historian
XENOPHANES in the sixth century B.C. when he observed that Thracians and Ethiopians both
depicted their GODS after their own image. Although writers like SAINT AUGUSTINE made some
acute observations on the differences between religions it was not until the THEORY of
EVOLUTION gained popularity in the late nineteenth century that the serious study of
comparative religion began. Under the influence of DARWIN, various scholars discovered
what they believed to be evolutionary links between different religions. Max MULLER, E. B.
TAYLOR and Sir James FRAZER were among the founders of the "new" science. In
Britain the study of non-CHRISTIAN RELIGIONS tended to be linked to the needs of empire
and had a more ANTHROPOLOGICAL bias than the theologically orientated Americans. In
Germany it was the history of religions in an essentially evolutionary and HEGALIAN
framework which predominated. </p>

<p>During the 1960s comparative religion, renamed "RELIGIOUS STUDIES," became a
popular course in many American universities and the great increase in Asian immigration
encouraged this trend. At its crudest, comparative religion teaches that all religions are
essentially equal and originate from one underlying reality. Thus the TEN COMMANDMENTS,
SERMON ON THE MOUNT, the FOUR NOBLE TRUTHS of BUDDHISM and HINDU teachings derived from
the <hi rend="italic">BHAGAVAD-GTA</hi> are sometimes seen as being essentially the same. </p>

<p>One fundamental problem for the more popular forms of comparative religion is that upon
closer study the teachings of the major world religions are at least as different as they
are similar. THERAVDA BUDDHISM presents a strong argument against the crudest forms of
comparative religion because of its rejection of the importance of BELIEF in GOD, or Gods,
and denial of the existence of an individual self. Similarly many religions, like ISLAM,
do not separate religion and politics as JUDAISM and CHRISTIANITY do. The rise of new
religious movements in Western society, often called CULTS, emphasizes the
inter-connectedness of the world. Today, for the first time since the Roman Empire,
Western Christians live in a religiously plural world. See: E. J. Sharpe, <hi rend="italic">Comparative
Religion: A History</hi>; Ninian Smart, <hi rend="italic">Reasons and Faiths</hi>; H. G. Coward, <hi rend="italic">Pluralism:

<div2 id="d468" type="entry">
<head>COUNCIL, CHURCH:</head>

<p>throughout CHRISTIAN HISTORY Councils of the CHURCH have been held to
determine correct or ORTHODOX doctrine. The first recorded Council of Church leaders was
held in JERUSALEM around 48 A.D. to discuss the admission of GENTILE converts into the
Christian community. All Christians recognize four ECUMENICAL Councils:  NICENE (325 A.D.);
CONSTANTINOPLE (381 A.D.); EPHESUS (431 A.D.); and CHALCEDON (451 A.D.). The ROMAN
CATHOLIC CHURCH claims a total of twenty-one Councils while other Churches count them
differently. REFORMATION meetings which produced such documents as the AUGSBURG
CONFESSION; BELGIC CONFESSION; WESTMINSTER CONFESSION; and the CANON OF DORT were, in
effect, PROTESTANT Councils. Similarly the ORTHODOX Churches recognize a number of
Councils of their own such as the COUNCIL of TRULLAN (692 A.D.).</p>

<div2 id="d469" type="entry">
<head>COUNTER CULTURE:</head>

<p>the SOCIAL movement which emerged in Haight Asbury in 1967 in

<head>COVENANT:</head>

<p>a HEBREW religious idea which conceives of God's relationship to mankind in

<p>Scottish PROTESTANTS who resisted the imposition of EPISCOPAL forms of

<head>CREATIO EX NIHILO:</head>

<p>the traditional CHRISTIAN doctrine that GOD CREATED the UNIVERSE
"out of nothing." This is an important BELIEF because it seeks to deny that God
used pre-existing matter and therefore that the CREATION might be ONTOLOGICALLY flawed
from the very beginning. Instead Christians attribute the presence of EVIL to the FALL.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d479" type="entry">
<head>CREATION:</head>

<p>an important doctrine in traditional CHRISTIANITY, JUDAISM and ISLAM where
GOD is the sole creator of the UNIVERSE and all things. Some other religious traditions
incorporate a view of creation, others deny it any special place in their BELIEF systems,
while many see GOD, or Gods, created out of pre-existing matter and some even view
creation as an emanation of God. The doctrine of creation is important because of its
implications for the related problems of EVIL and human SALVATION.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d480" type="entry">
<head>CREATIONISM:</head>

<p>the BELIEF that humans and the entire UNIVERSE owe their existence to GOD.
In recent years the word has been "hijacked" by FUNDAMENTALISTS who insist that
such a belief implies a literal six day CREATION 6,000 years ago. This view is the result
of nineteenth century RATIONALISM entering CHRISTIANITY and not supported by the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi>

26:5-9; 1 Corinthians 15:3-5; Romans 1:3-4; and 10:9-10</hi>. In CHRISTIAN HISTORY three
creeds have achieved particular prominence:  (1) the APOSTLES' creed was supposedly written
by the Apostles; (2) the NICENE creed which embodies in altered form, and without the
anathemas, the CHRISTOLOGICAL teaching of the Council of Nicaea adopted in answer to
ARIANISM and probably rests on creeds from Jerusalem and Antioch; (3) commonly called the
ATHANASIAN creed and is popularly attributed to ATHANASIUS but it is thought to be a
fourth or fifth century Canticle of unknown authorship. As a direct statement of
Trinitarian belief it became the test of ORTHODOXY and competence of the clergy in the
West from the seventh century on. The REFORMERS valued it highly while the ANGLICANS made
liturgical use of it. But the Eastern, or GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH, refused to recognize it.</p>

<div2 id="d495" type="entry">
<head>CULT:</head>

<p>a controversial and misunderstood word greatly misused by the media where it
means a GROUP nobody likes through association with BRAINWASHING. In THEOLOGY the term
"cult" has been used to refer to forms of WORSHIP and the RITUALS associated
with them such as those at the JERUSALEM TEMPLE in ANCIENT JUDAISM. Sociologically, it
refers to small religious groups which are in tension with established religious
TRADITIONS and society generally. Rodney STARK and William Sims BAINBRIDGE give an
OPERATIONAL DEFINITION of cult as:  "a religious body which does not have a prior tie
with another established religious body in the society in question. The cult may represent
an alien (external) religion, or it may have originated in the host society, but through
innovation, not fusion. Whether domestic or imported, the cult is something new <hi rend="italic">vis-&aacute;-vis</hi>
the other religious bodies in the society in question." On the basis of this
definition, they identify three types of cult:  "Audience Cults" which resemble a
very loose lecture circuit where people participate in lectures, seminars and workshops as
well as buying books and subscribing to magazines which promote a general spiritual point
of view. "Client Cults" where mobilization is partial, rather than all embracing
and people participate as clients, for example attending occasional SPIRITUALIST meetings,
when they have specific needs rather than join as members. Finally, there are "Cult
Movements" proper where membership is required and there is a development toward the
status of a SECT.</p>

his story of the madman in <hi rend="italic">The Gay Science</hi> which was taken up by PROTESTANT
theologians in the 1960s to express the REALITY of religion in a SECULAR SOCIETY. The

<head>DEIFICATION:</head>

<p>the making of a person or thing into a DEITY which was characteristic of

Western theology. Through the work of the HOLY SPIRIT, humans are believed to regain those

<head>DIALECTIC:</head>

<p>a form of reasoning originally used by PLATO in his early dialogues as
conversation. In medieval THEOLOGY the dialectical method took the form of stating an
opinion using an established authority, then a different opinion was given from another
authority before a final solution was proposed to reconcile the two contradictory
opinions. In modern PHILOSOPHY the term is associated with the LOGIC of HEGEL. He argued
that the very nature of REASON leads us to posit a THESIS which generates its ANTITHESIS,
or opposite. This process, in turn, leads to a synthesis or reconciling of the two theses.
Karl MARX claimed to see the laws of Hegelian dialectics at work in HISTORY and the
economic affairs of humans. This led him to develop his materialist interpretation of
history. Religiously the term was used by Soren KIERKEGAARD who saw the dialectic as two
apparent opposites with profound EXISTENTIAL significance. Kierkegaard's ideas, in turn,
influenced NEO-ORTHODOX theologians in the twentieth century.</p>

</div2>
<div2 id="d556" type="entry">
<head>DIVORCE:</head>

<p>the dissolution of marriage. Of all the world religions, CHRISTIANITY has the
most problem with divorce due to the difficulty of interpreting various sayings of JESUS
and SACRAMENTAL views of marriage. In theory the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH forbids divorce
although exceptions can be made through annulment of the marriage. The EASTERN ORTHODOX
Churches allow divorce for a number of reasons, while PROTESTANTS are divided about the
issue. More FUNDAMENTALIST groups usually totally deny the practice on Biblical grounds.
One complicating factor is deciding exactly what constitutes a marriage. At the time of
Jesus the JEWS practiced POLYGAMY thus undermining many of the more literalist
interpretations of marriage as a sexual act. Although greatly neglected, John MILTON'S <hi rend="italic">The
Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce</hi> is a classic statement about the meaning of
marriage and Biblical teachings about divorce.</p>

<head>DUALISM:</head>

<p>a dualist argues that to explain the FACTS of the world, or even particular
facts encountered in daily life, requires a BELIEF in two different ultimate and
irreducible PRINCIPLES. There are two major FORMS of dualism:  the first offers an
interpretation of the universe which sees it as a cosmic battleground between the
principles of GOOD and EVIL:  ZOROASTRIANISM is a classic example of this view within a
religious movement. The second form argues for the strict division of human nature into
SPIRIT and MATTER. This view first emerged in Indian religions and entered the West with
PYTHAGOREANS and ORPHISM in the sixth century B.C. Both forms of dualism have influenced
certain developments of CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY although many philosophers have maintained that
the idea of GOD as the CREATOR of the UNIVERSE implies a form of MONISM while the early
CREEDS stressed the RESURRECTION of the body not the IMMORTALITY of the SOUL.</p>

<head>ENGLAND, CHURCH OF:</head>

<p>also known as ANGLICANISM. The origins of English CHRISTIANITY are
unknown, but the presence of British BISHOPS at the COUNCIL OF ARLES (3l4) indicates the
existence of an organized CHURCH. Following the Roman withdrawal and Teutonic invasions,
CHRISTIANITY retreated to the Celtic lands, but in the late sixth and early seventh
centuries, Roman and Celtic missions began the RECONVERSION of England. The SYNOD OF
WHITBY (663-664) secured the observance of Roman forms. The English Church was largely
isolated from continental ECCLESIASTICAL affairs until the NORMAN INVASION of 1066.
However, distance from Rome, the conflict between England and France, and Papal decline
made English submission more nominal than real. It was an easy matter for King Henry VIII
(1491-1547) to use his divorce from Catherine of Aragon as grounds for detaching England
from Papal obedience. The parliament of 1532-1536 created King Henry "Supreme Head on
Earth of the Church of England." Under Edward VI (1537-1553), the Church underwent a
LITURGICAL and doctrinal REFORMATION. The accession of MARY TUDOR (1516-1558) inaugurated
a period of Roman reaction, during which many of the Edwardian reformers were martyred.
Elizabeth I (1558-1603) restored a PROTESTANT settlement, but her aim was a comprehensive,
national, EPISCOPAL Church, with the monarch as Supreme Governor. Moderate PROTESTANTISM
reflected in the Church's doctrinal basis, the THIRTY-NINE ARTICLES of Religion and in the
writings of Richard HOOKER, gave Anglicanism its classic <hi rend="italic">Via Media</hi> statements.
The post-Restoration Church had its High and Low wings. Like most PROTESTANT
DENOMINATIONS, the Anglican Church was affected by DEISM in the eighteenth century, but
the key movement of this period was the EVANGELICAL Revival. Medieval spirituality was
revived by the OXFORD MOVEMENT, led by John Henry NEWMAN and John KEBLE, with an emphasis
on the Church, APOSTOLIC SUCCESSION, SACRAMENTAL GRACE, and ASCETIC HOLINESS. The movement
was seen by many people as a Romanizing tendency. Since the mid-nineteenth century, due to
the activity of the CHRISTIAN SOCIALISTS, the Church has become increasingly aware of its
social responsibilities and in the mid-1960s it witnessed the beginning of an EVANGELICAL
revival among its clergy.</p>

<p>a movement characterized by the historian TROELTSCH (1865-1923) as
the beginning of the really modern period of European CULTURE. It had its roots in
PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY and was strongly influenced by PIETISM finding its clearest
expression in the work of KANT who defined "the Enlightenment" in his book <hi rend="italic">Religion
Within the Limits of Reason</hi> (1793) as man's emergence from a self-inflicted state of
minority. Kant wrote: "Have the courage to make use of your own understanding, is
therefore the watchword of the Enlightenment." The Enlightenment originated in the
Netherlands and England in the mid-seventeenth century but reached its high-water mark in
French RATIONALISM and MATERIALISM finding political expression in the French REVOLUTION.
Its richest philosophical and political results were achieved in Germany under the
influence of Kant. Although many branches of the Enlightenment were self-consciously
ANTI-CHRISTIAN and a distinctive form of Enlightenment Christianity developed in
Protestant countries, other branches of PROTESTANTISM were influential in promoting
concerns similar to those of the Rationalists. Enlightenment Christianity as such was
characterized by a retreat from DOGMAS, SACRAMENTS and CEREMONIES, FAITH in PROVIDENCE,
obligation to "virtue" and a tendency to subordinate Christian dogmas to current
ideas from SCIENCE and CULTURE.</p>

<head>ENTHUSIASM:</head>

<p>the original Greek word means "rapture" or being possessed by a

<div2 id="d618" type="entry">
<head>EPICURUS (341-270 B.C.):</head>

<p>Greek philosopher who cultivated friendship and rejected both
SKEPTICISM and IDEALISM in favor of an emphasis on immediate experience. SENSE DATA is the

<p>from the Greek term meaning "inner" or "hidden." Today it
refers to secret teachings which either belong to secret societies or lie behind the

<head>ESP:</head>

<p>extra sensory perception. Claims by individuals to experience para-normal
PHENOMENA such as TELEPATHY, PROPHECIES, significant or prophetic DREAMS, VISIONS, powers

nature clearly belong to the realm of PSEUDO-SCIENCE, sufficient examples exist in the
experience of many people to leave open the possibility that some powers of this nature do
exist. There are two main problems with such claims:  first, they clearly violate the known

Oracles and Magic, Amongst the Azande </hi>(1937) is a masterpiece which demonstrates the
inner coherence of seemingly IRRATIONAL BELIEF systems. Its publication led to a bitter
dispute with Malinowski who disassociated himself from Evans-Pritchard's views and
attempted to prevent him from obtaining an academic post. Evans-Pritchard's CONVERSION to
CATHOLICISM in 1944 further raised the ire of the academic community but with the help of
RADCLIFFE-BROWN, he obtained the Chair of SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY at the University of Oxford

<head>EVOLUTION:</head>

<p>in modern times the theory of evolution was first advanced by Charles BONNET
(1720-1793) who argued that an embryo already contains all the parts of the mature
organism. Charles LYELL (1797-1874) speculated on the evolution of land animals in 1832
and his work influenced Charles DARWIN (1809-1882), who wrote <hi rend="italic">The Origin of Species</hi>
(1859). Prior to that, Herbert SPENCER in 1852 had defined a general theory of evolution
from lower to higher forms of life and organization. What Darwin did was new; he described
some of the processes by which new species developed and generalized these as NATURAL
SELECTION. In the development of SOCIAL DARWINISM, the generalized natural history
provided images for social action and change and came to justify ruthless competition on
the basis of "natural selection" and "the survival of the fittest."</p>

In this way they become at best mechanical, at worst MAGICAL. BAPTISM for example was
believed to result in the SALVATION of individuals regardless of the personal FAITH or

<head>EXISTENCE:</head>

<p>usually contrasted with ESSENCE in classical THEOLOGY and refers to the
actuality in time and space of any subject, in contrast to its mere possibility or

in which humans live their lives. Since the distinctive nature of human existence is
choice of freedom, and freedom in turn cannot be defined as a "thing," Jean-Paul
SARTRE has argued that "man has no essence" or "existence precedes
essence."</p>

<p>an adjective frequently used in contemporary THEOLOGICAL and religious

</div2>
<div2 id="d661" type="entry">
<head>EXISTENTIALISM:</head>

<p>a PHILOSOPHICAL movement which emerged shortly before the Second World
War united by common concerns, motifs, and emphasis. The most influential exponents were
Martin HEIDEGGER, whose <hi rend="italic">Being and Time</hi> appeared in 1927, Karl JASPERS, his second
volume of <hi rend="italic">Philosophie</hi> appeared in 1932, and Jean-Paul SARTRE. All the important
leaders were indebted to the writings of Soren KIERKEGAARD&mdash;a once neglected Danish
author&mdash;whose works were not translated into German until early in this century and into
English much later. The movement may be characterized as follows. It begins with the
conviction that Western PHILOSOPHY since the Greeks has been preoccupied with the idea of
ESSENCE, that is with the general and UNIVERSAL features of anything, rather than with
concrete. INDIVIDUAL essence being counted more real than EXISTENCE because it is
unchanging. Consequently, Western philosophy has been INTELLECTUALISTIC and RATIONALISTIC.
It is, therefore, irrelevant as far as illuminating life is concerned because it obscured
the TRUTH about human existence rather than illuminating REALITY. Existentialism had a
profound impact on NEO-ORTHODOX theologians, like Karl BARTH, Rudolf BULTMANN, Paul
TILLICH, and Reinhold NIEBUHR as well as on some Roman Catholics like Gabriel MARCEL and
Karl RAHNER. The self, they argued, is a unity of radical FREEDOM and limitedness. FAITH,
therefore, is acceptance of this paradoxical unity. But faith is not the possession of a
CREED, DOCTRINE, or BELIEF it is the decision to be oneself as this person in this
specific situation. Thus decision is made possible by the unconditioned acceptance of the
person by GOD which enables each individual to have the courage to be.</p>

<p>the act of casting out DEMONS or EVIL SPIRITS in a RITUAL designed to free

<head>FAITH:</head>

<p>In CHRISTIAN thought two tendencies concerning the Faith may be observed: first,
faith is regarded as BELIEF or mental assent to the TRUTH; and second, faith is understood
as the orientation of the total person best described as TRUST, confidence, or loyalty.
The THEOLOGICAL system of Thomas AQUINAS was based on such an intellectualistic model of
faith. His teachings are basic to the doctrine of ROMAN CATHOLICISM where faith is to be
regarded as an act of intellectual assent to SUPERNATURAL truths based on their divine
AUTHORITY. LUTHER rejected this view of faith arguing instead that it is the response of
the total person to the <hi rend="italic">Gospel</hi>. Other religious systems sometimes make use of the
word "faith" when translating texts into English, but only PURE LAND BUDDHISM
has a view of faith similar to the CHRISTIAN one. The other usages distort both the
meaning of faith and the beliefs of the religion concerned. In addition to faith being
used in this way, it is possible to speak about "the faith" of a group, meaning
the complex of beliefs and practices belonging to a particular RELIGION. In general
though, faith usually refers to Christianity.</p>

<div2 id="d673" type="entry">
<head>FALL OF MAN:</head>

<p>a term used in CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY to denote humanities original rebellion
against GOD as described in the Biblical story of ADAM and EVE found in <hi rend="italic">Genesis 3</hi>.
Theologians argue about whether the story it to be taken literally or whether it is
symbolic of the human condition. Most agree that the essential point of the Christian
understanding of the human situation is that SUFFERING and EVIL entered the world as a
result of a wrong moral choice on the part of human beings. Other religious TRADITIONS
either do not share this pessimistic view of the human condition or view it as an
ONTOLOGICAL and not a MORAL problem. JUDAISM does not see the human condition as a result
of an act of rebellion while HINDUISM expresses a far more radical pessimism based on the
essential nature of the existence within the bounds of KARMA.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d674" type="entry">
<head>FALLACY:</head>

<p>arguments which seem correct but upon examination prove false. They are
arguments which are PSYCHOLOGICALLY persuasive but logically wrong through mistakes in
relating, inferring, or concluding, while reasoning. TRADITIONAL logic identified
fallacies as either "formal" or "informal." A formal fallacy appears
valid but actually breaks the rules of reasoning. Informal fallacies are harder to
discover but can usually be exposed by counter examples. They result from either
carelessness and inattention to the subject matter or through ambiguity in the language
used. As a result, informal fallacies may be classified as fallacies of relevance and
fallacies of ambiguity. </p>

<head>FEUERBACH, Ludwig Andreas (1804-1872):</head>

<p>German MATERIALIST philosopher famous for his

over Irish rebels. He studied under HEGEL whose idealism he rejected in favor of a
thorough-going materialism. Subsequently he strongly attacked religious BELIEFS,
especially those of PROTESTANT CHRISTIANITY as represented by SCHLEIERMACHER, by arguing
that the idea of GOD is an outward projection of man's inner nature. Thus the HOLY Family
reflects the inadequacies of actual human families and subconsciously compensates for them
in the imagination of the believer. His work had a profound influence on MARX who accepted

<p>a term used in the CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHY of Herman DOOYEWEERD
to signify the encounter between the old pre-Homeric Greek RELIGION of life and the later

stream of life which is unable to fix itself in any individual form but out of which
transitory beings are generated whose existence is limited by an individual form with the
result they are subjected to the fate of death. This is the MATTER motive of Greek thought
which found its most pregnant expression in the worship of DIONYSUS. The form motive found
in the later Olympian religion valued measure and harmony and rested on the essential
DEIFICATION of the CULTURAL aspect of Greek society and the personification of cultural
powers though the Olympian Gods. Its greatest expression was in the WORSHIP of the
law-giver&mdash;the Delphic God&mdash; APOLLO.</p>

<p>founder of the Franciscan Order and son of a wealthy

for over a year. This experience led him to reflect on life and make a PILGRIMAGE to Rome
in 1205. After a VISION, he began to rebuild the CHURCH of SAINT DAMIAN near Assisi. His
father, assisted by the local Bishop, attempted to forcibly restore him to a secular
vocation but he persisted in his religious convictions whereupon his father disowned him.
In 1209 he began preaching brotherly love, apostolic poverty and REPENTANCE. This led to
the founding of his Order and his original Rule. In 1224 he retired to a HERMITAGE to
spend the remainder of his life in PRAYER. During this time he composed his <hi rend="italic">Canticle

<p>a British lawyer influenced by William Robertson
SMITH who became the first ever professor of SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY at the University of
Liverpool, England in 1907. He quickly retired from this post and devoted his life to
writing. Although a prolific writer his "anthropology" was decidedly the
"armchair" variety based on interpretations of works by MISSIONARIES, traders
and travellers which tended to take BELIEFS and practices totally out of their social and
historical context to create a grand theory. His influence on the development of
COMPARATIVE RELIGION and popular religious ideas was considerable as can be seen by the
continuing popularity of his major work <hi rend="italic">The Golden Bough</hi> (published in twelve
volumes between 1890 and 1915) which attempts to show underlying themes common to all

<head>FREEDOM:</head>

<p>an important concept in Western PHILOSOPHY where it becomes the basis for
moral choice and the basis of TRADITIONAL legal thought. It is characterized by a lack of
restraint and the ability to make one's own decisions without interference. The concept
runs into difficulties when we try to understand what is meant by "restraint"
and what limits exist that inhibit our ability to act freely and, as a result, intense
debate rages around the concept. In RELIGION it becomes an important issue in terms of the
JUSTICE of GOD. Can humans freely choose to serve God or do they require DIVINE
assistance? If God's GRACE is needed to bring men and women into His service, is it fair
for God to judge those who do not respond when they lack the grace needed to enable them
to respond? The issue is complex and has plagued both philosophers and theologians for
centuries. </p>

<div2 id="d731" type="entry">
<head>FREEMASONRY:</head>

<p>an international organization whose principles are embodied in SYMBOLS and
ALLEGORIES connected with the art of building and involving an oath of secrecy. The
origins of the movement probably lie in twelfth century Europe. There are two major
divisions:  the Old Charges which date 1390 and 1400; and The Masonic Word, which is a
Scottish institution of obscure origin. From the eighteenth century there developed
"Speculative Masonry" or modern FREEMASONRY. The Grand Lodge was formed in 1717
to co-ordinate other Lodges. The origins of most Masonic ceremonies are obscure and
probably date to the seventeenth century. The movement places considerable emphasis on
social welfare activities and claims to be based on the fundamentals of all religions. In
the eighteenth century it was closely associated with DEISM and even today a general
deistic ethos generally prevails modified by the incorporation of religious symbols
derived from ASSYRIAN and EGYPTIAN BELIEFS. The CHURCH OF ENGLAND, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH
and many EVANGELICAL denominations have condemned FREEMASONRY as UN-CHRISTIAN. Recently
various sensational journalists have published exposes claiming that it is a closed club
which often breaks the law to promote the interests of its members. Such claims are, of
course, hotly denied by Masons.</p>

repressed and forgotten impressions underlies all abnormal mental states such as hysteria

desires, especially of sexual desires. Strongly ANTI-CHRISTIAN he authored <hi rend="italic">The Future
of an Illusion</hi> (1927) and <hi rend="italic">Moses and Monotheism</hi> (1939), works which develop

<head>FUNDAMENTALISM:</head>

<p>a CONSERVATIVE THEOLOGICAL movement which arose in American
PROTESTANTISM in the 1920s in opposition to "MODERNISM." Fundamentalism should
be understood primarily as an attempt to protect the essential doctrines or
"fundamentals" of the CHRISTIAN FAITH from the eroding effects of modern
thought. The doctrines considered essential by Fundamentalists include:  the VIRGIN BIRTH
of JESUS, His RESURRECTION and DEITY, His substitutionary ATONEMENT and SECOND COMING.
Finally, they lay great stress on the authority of the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi> which is usually
expressed in terms of its INFALLIBILITY and INERRANCY. The roots of fundamentalism go back
to the nineteenth century when EVOLUTION, BIBLICAL CRITICISM, and COMPARATIVE RELIGION
began to challenge the authority of the Biblical REVELATION. A significant offensive
against MODERNISM was launched in 1910 with the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Fundamentals</hi> a
series of tracts written by conservative scholars to counter certain theological
tendencies they considered dangerous. In a relatively short time the fundamentalist image
became stereotyped as close-minded, belligerent, separatist, and uncultured. Even though
the original Fundamentalists were well educated scholars&mdash;some from leading universities,
such as Graham Gresham Machen at Princeton&mdash; the movement as a whole quickly became
identified with a rejection of education and a reactionary rural nostalgia for earlier
times. Recently the term "fundamentalism" has been applied to MUSLIMS and
members of other FAITHS who wish to retain their TRADITIONAL BELIEFS. Although there may
be some merit is such usage, it is very misleading because many people identified thus are
simply anti-Western. For example the Iranian REVOLUTION is usually described as
"fundamentalist Islam" while the Saudis are seen as pro-Western and therefore
more LIBERAL. In reality the Iranians interpret the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> in a far more liberal
and open manner than the Saudis who are much closer to CHRISTIAN fundamentalists in their
religious beliefs and practices than the Iranians. The use of "fundamentalism"
in this context is, therefore, not very helpful.</p>

<head>GARDNER, Gerald Brousseau (1884-1964):</head>

<p>English Mason, OCCULTIST and creator of modern
WITCHCRAFT or "WICCA." He was a sickly child and received very little formal
education. In 1900 he moved to Sri Lanka where he worked on a plantation and later became
a civil servant. He travelled widely in the East, absorbing local CULTURES and FOLK
BELIEFS. Retiring to England in 1938, he joined a THEOSOPHICAL group led by the daughter
of Annie BESANT, through whom he met Dorothy Clutterbuck who claimed to be a WITCH and
initiated him into "the craft." In 1949, under the assumed name
"Scire," he published a novel <hi rend="italic">High Magic's Aid</hi> where he outlined many
of his ideas about MAGICAL RITUAL. Following the repeal of England's Witchcraft Laws in
1951, he published <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft Today </hi>(1954) and numerous other books. Gardner's
system is a mish-mash of Masonic ritual, Eastern FOLK CULTURE, YOGIC RELIGION and his own
vivid imagination designed to appeal to a popular audience on the basis of its alleged
historical roots. Central to his ideas is the creation of a CULT of the Mother Goddess
about whom he wrote in his novel <hi rend="italic">A Goddess Arrives</hi> (1948). In 1963 Gardner
initiated Raymond and Rosemary Buckland who spread his CREED to North America.</p>

SPIRITUALIST ideas into a Gothic type mythology which drew on YOGIC RELIGIONS and his own

pseudo-historical justifications leading many to falsely believe that they were joining an

<head>GOD:</head>

<p>although many people claim that all RELIGIONS share the idea of God, in fact only
CHRISTIANITY, ISLAM and JUDAISM have a similar understanding of the term. This
understanding probably comes from a common source rooted in the religion of ABRAHAM with
the result that these religions may be identified as ABRAMIC RELIGIONS. Traditionally, the
Abramic religions understood God as the CREATOR of the UNIVERSE and everything that
exists. All three religions saw God as a personal BEING who demanded obedience from humans
but it was in Christianity that the personal relationship between God and humans was given
its highest expression through the doctrine of the INCARNATION which taught that God
became man in the person of JESUS CHRIST. Islam and Judaism place greater stress on God as
law-giver and our responsibility to respond to Him by obeying His law. Many INDIAN
religions developed highly personal versions of the DEITY but usually limited the powers
of each deity through the acceptance of a vast pantheon of over three million Gods. The
concept of a CREATOR GOD in the Abramic sense is, however, missing from Indian religions.
CHINESE and JAPANESE religions recognized an impersonal force behind the universe but
never developed a concept of God similar to the Abramic one. In other religious
traditions, God or Gods may play important roles for specific tasks, such as healings, but
their power and role as creator or personality is severely limited. BUDDHISM is unique in
recognizing the existence of Gods in the affairs of daily life but in declaring in no
uncertain terms that as a religion or practice, Buddhism has nothing to do with God.
Indeed, Buddhism explicitly denies the Abramic concept of God and is therefore often
described as a FORM of ATHEISM.</p>

WHITEFIELD linked these regional awakenings into a "Great Awakening" through his
itinerant preaching tours. The established Clergy soon criticized the revivalists'
preaching and practices and Edwards became their vigorous defender. In his book <hi rend="italic">Some
Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival</hi> (1743), and later work <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on</hi>

of Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers, Brown, and Dartmouth

<head>GROUND MOTIVE:</head>

<p>a term used in the PHILOSOPHY of Herman DOOYEWEERD. A ground motive
represents the fundamental motivation or driving force of a CULTURE. It is the common
spirit which gives a community its dynamics and controls its entire attitude to life.
Ground motives exercise unconscious influence on individuals and societies. Dooyeweerd
recognizes four basic ground motives in the development of Western society:  form-matter;
creation-fall-redemption; nature-grace; and nature-freedom. In his view only the Christian
ground motive of creation-fall-redemption exists as a radical unity that avoids
dialectical tensions. The others are plagued reductionist tendencies which force a choice
between one or the other poles of the ground motive. For example, in the field of
PSYCHOLOGY, various conflicts exist between "humanistic psychology" and
deterministic theories. According to Dooyeweerd these conflicts reflect the influence of
the polar tensions of the modern Western ground motive of nature-freedom and not, as most,
practitioners think, different interpretations of "the facts."</p>

re-create its social structure on the basis of a knowledge of its cosmology. The technique
is based on the concept of positional control or the social restraints, physical or

<p>Hebrew term for "PIETY" or "the pious." In the eighteenth
century it became associated with an Eastern European JEWISH sect founded by RABBI ISRAEL
ben Eliezer. It reacted against what it saw as the arid interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">TALMUD</hi>

<div2 id="d849" type="entry">
<head>HEGEL, George Wilhelm Friedrich (1770-1831):</head>

<p>German philosopher whose system is
commonly known as "HEGELIANISM." His complex idealist philosophy contains many
elements the most influential of which are:  (1) the DIALECTIC which is generally
interpreted to mean that all reasoning is dialectical proceeding from a CONCEPT to a new
and contradictory concept which gives way to a third concept that transcends and
synthesizes both earlier concepts. This is usually stated as thesis-antithesis and
synthesis; (2) the theory of self-realization by which the dialectical process in the
individual leads to a determinate "SELF" which is "for itself;" (3)
the theory of history which is a dialectical process leading to the manifestation of the
ABSOLUTE SPIRIT and arguing that in every specific age the spirit manifests itself in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitgeist</hi>
or the "spirit-of-the-age" which determines social and political life,
knowledge, religion and art. Hegel's work strongly influenced such people as FEUERBACH and
MARX. Critics contend that it leads to TOTALITARIANISM and is so obscure as to bewitch the
intellect.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d850" type="entry">
<head>HEIDEGGER, Martin (1884-1976):</head>

<p>a central figure in contemporary continental PHILOSOPHY,
the development of EXISTENTIALISM and new directions in HERMENEUTICS. In <hi rend="italic">Being and
Time</hi> (1927) he characterized everyday existence as unauthentic because we are
"thrown" into our world, or mental UNIVERSE, which makes our SELF inseparable
from our world and as a result genuine being remains undiscovered. Although his philosophy
was deeply spiritual, he attacked CHRISTIANITY for contribution to our self-betrayal and
contributing to the destruction of genuine CULTURE. As early as 1946 Karl Lowith pointed
out Heidegger's enthusiasm for the Nazis:  this was vigorously denied by his followers but
now seems established beyond all doubt.</p>

<head>HELL:</head>

<p>an old English term used to translate the HEBREW terms SHE'OL and GEHENNA. In
most religions Hell&mdash;or the Hells&mdash;is the place of the dammed. In the YOGIC religions,
however, escape from Hell is ultimately possible through eventual REBIRTH. In traditional
ABRAMIC religions Hell appears to be the permanent state of the wicked and implies eternal
separation from GOD.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d855" type="entry">
<head>HENOTHEISM:</head>

<p>from the Greek words <hi rend="italic">henos</hi> meaning "one" and <hi rend="italic">theos</hi>
or "God" this term was coined by Max MULLER for a FORM of RELIGION which accepts
the WORSHIP of one GOD by a particular individual or GROUP but does not deny the existence
of different GODS worshiped by other people. It is sometimes described as
"one-God-at-a-timeism." M&uuml;ller suggested that originally the ancient HEBREWS

<head>HERDER, Johann Gottfried von (1744-1803):</head>

<p>German LUTHERAN scholar and leader of the
ROMANTIC movement who was influenced by the philosophy of KANT. His studies of the <hi rend="italic">Synoptic
Gospels</hi> (1796) and the <hi rend="italic">Gospel of John</hi> (1797) led him to conclude that they
could not be harmonized and helped launch German BIBLICAL CRITICISM. His philosophy of
language argued that the language of a people encapsulates its HISTORICAL identity and
underlying unity. This view greatly influenced German NATIONALISM and although Herder was
essentially LIBERAL, this led to REACTIONARY politics and RACISM. His most influential
works were his <hi rend="italic">Outlines of a Philosophy of History of Man</hi> (1800) and <hi rend="italic">Treatise
upon the Origin of Language</hi> (1827).</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d861" type="entry">
<head>HERESY:</head>

<p>in its loose sense it refers to the conscious, willful, rejection of any
doctrine held to be normative by a GROUP or institution. ROMAN CATHOLICISM defines a
heretic as any BAPTIZED person who, wishing to call himself a CHRISTIAN, denies the TRUTH
REVEALED to the CHURCH. Until the nineteenth century, PROTESTANTS generally regarded
heresy as the willful rejection of any truth taught in the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi>. With the rise
of BIBLICAL CRITICISM, defining heresy became a problem because the notion of a CANON and
ORTHODOXY itself came under increasing criticism. Although originally a religious term, it
is common today to talk about political, scientific and other forms of heresy to mean
deviation from the <hi rend="italic">status quo</hi> or accepted ORTHODOXY.</p>

His works became CULT readings among the West Coast HIPPIES in America during the 1960s.
The hallmark of his work is a desire for experience untrammeled by the inhibitions of
institutionalized society to elicit a LIBERATION of thought and behavior. His most famous

<head>HIGH GODS:</head>

<p>many scholars argue that a PRIMITIVE MONOTHEISM lies behind most religious
movements even though the people concerned appear, at first sight, to WORSHIP many GODS.
The idea is that behind the lesser Gods of everyday life lies a more remote High God who
is the true God and source of their religious ideas. This CONCEPT originated as a FORM of

SCHMIDT whose ideas are generally rejected by modern scholars.</p>

<head>HINDUISM:</head>

<p>the religion which has come to be called Hinduism by Westerners is an
amalgamation of various CULTS and BELIEFS within the common social framework of India's
CASTE system. It acquired its characteristic form in the period after the <hi rend="italic">UPANISHADS</hi>
with increasing importance of popular GODS like VSUDEVA, VISHNU, iva, as objects of
devotion. This represented an amalgamation of VEDIC and BRAHMNICAL religion, mediated by a
priestly class, the BRAHMINS. One can distinguish the following periods:  (1) the VEDIC,
during which Vedic HYMNS were composed and collected, lasting from the latter part of 2nd
millennium B.C. to about 800 B.C; (2) the UPANISADIC in which a MONISTIC and MONOTHEISTIC
RELIGION developed;( 3) the classical period, during which Hinduism acquired its typical
form. This period lasted from 500 B.C.to 500 A.D; (4) the MEDIEVAL period which was
important for the evolution of BHAKTI cults; (5) finally, the modern period during which
Hinduism came to terms with the impact of the West as mediated by the British. Typically
this last period is identified with VEDNTA although other movements flourished in India
and elsewhere. Hinduism is not usually thought of as a MISSIONARY religion though
organizations like the RAMAKRISHNA and HARE KRISHNA increasingly make UNIVERSAL claims and
seek non-Indian CONVERTS.</p>

process of interpreting the past based on evidence available in the present and accounts
inherited from earlier times. Although each generation re-interprets history in light of
contemporary questions, history claims a scientific status through its careful use of

<p>the speculative PHILOSOPHY which considers the similarities and differences,

idealism interprets the universal as FORM or the basic pattern which underlies REALITY. It

agree that the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi> places a high value on the human being. The issue is
complicated by the doctrine of the FALL. ROMAN CATHOLICS maintain that the Fall caused
humans to lose certain SUPERNATURAL endowments and gifts but that the essential human

<head>INCA RELIGION:</head>

<p>much of what is known of Inca religion comes from Spanish sources and
archaeological evidence. The Inca appear to have WORSHIPED a CREATOR GOD who had no name
but was given a series of titles. Numerous other DEITIES also existed and were worshiped.
Ceremonies were held in large areas in the open air and TEMPLES were used to store RITUAL
paraphernalia. Many PRIESTS and attendants served the religion which involved large public
ceremonies and constant SACRIFICE. Human victims&mdash;mainly women and children&mdash;appear to
have been sacrificed in times of crisis. In general, the Spanish regarded Inca worship
with horror as a bloodthirsty CULT:  even allowing for their own lust for gold and
conquest, their account of Inca religion seems essentially true and chilling.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d958" type="entry">
<head>INCARNATION:</head>

<p>the taking on of HUMAN FORM; to make real or to provide with a body. In
RELIGION the term refers to the appearance of a DEITY or some other SPIRITUAL entity in
either the flesh or some other MATERIAL form. CHRISTIANS believe in the INCARNATION OF
CHRIST while HINDUS speak about the incarnations of various DEITIES. In ISLAM the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi>
is often referred to as the incarnation of GOD'S word.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d959" type="entry">
<head>INCARNATION OF CHRIST:</head>

<p>one of the key and unique BELIEFS of CHRISTIANITY which teaches
that JESUS CHRIST, the SON OF GOD, was both fully God and fully human. This is quite
different from other ancient religious MYTHOLOGIES where a God either takes on human form
or has human offspring who are part God and part human. In Christian THEOLOGY the CREATOR
GOD took on human form to become fully human while, at the same time, remaining fully
DIVINE. Early Christian CREEDS went to great lengths to explain what this meant while at
the same time distinguishing Christian teaching from similar sounding PAGAN notions of
God-men. The NICENE CREED, for example, says "I believe...in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the only-begotten Son of God, Begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God; Light
of Light; Very God of Very God; Begotten, not made...who...was incarnate by the Holy Ghost
of the Virgin Mary, And was made man...." Elaborating on this, the CREED attributed
to ATHANASIUS says "He is God, of the Substance of the Father...and he is Man, of the
Substance of his Mother...Perfect God; Perfect Man...Who although he be God and Man, yet
he is not two, but is one Christ. One altogether; not by conversion of Godhead into flesh,
but by taking Manhood into God; One altogether; not by confusion of Substance but by unity
of Person..." For CHRISTIANS this is a crucial DOCTRINE because they believe that it
enables Jesus Christ to act as MEDIATOR between God and man. See <hi rend="italic">1 Timothy 2:5</hi>. </p>

<head>ISLAM:</head>

<p>the FAITH, obedience and practice of the followers of MUHAMMAD believed by them
to be the final and perfected RELIGION revealed by GOD. When the word is written
"islam" it denotes surrender to God, but when written "Islam" it
denotes the religion established by Muhammad in the seventh century A.D. Fundamentally it
means submitting oneself to God and renouncing any other object of WORSHIP. It is
sometimes said that the word "islam" means peace, but this does not seem correct
linguistically. The first MIRACLE of Islam is the poetry of its HOLY BOOK&mdash;the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi>.
The second miracle is the early conquests of Muslim armies. During Muhammad's lifetime his
followers were confined to Arabia. After his death, Syria was quickly conquered, Damascus
being taken in 635 and Jerusalem in 636, Mada'in the Persian capital fell in 637. Within a
century Muslim armies reached the borders of China and spread Westward to conquer North
Africa. In 711 Spain was invaded and the Muslims were defeated at Tours, France in 732:
this battle ended Islam's first major thrust into Europe. Today there are over 200,000,000
Muslims in the world. Islam is a MONOTHEISTIC religion based on the CREED "There is
no God but God and Muhammad is His PROPHET." ABRAHAM, MOSES and JESUS and other
Biblical figures are also recognized as Prophets but their REVELATIONS are said to have
been distorted by their followers. Muhammad was the last of the prophets to whom God
revealed His Holy Word the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi>. The test of ORTHODOXY in Islam is not assent to
a BELIEF, but attendance at WORSHIP. Muslims are expected to observe five basic religious
duties involving:  weekly communal worship; daily devotions; fasting during the month of
Ramadan; the payment of religious tax; and pilgrimage to MECCA at least once in their
lifetime. To these duties JIHD&mdash;religious war&mdash;or the defence of Islam by military force,
is also added. The duties are not inflexible but may be modified according to
circumstances and in theory at least, depend upon the individual's conscience for their
performance. In addition to this, Islam makes no distinction between religious and civil
law, the secular and the sacred, Church and State. As a result the whole of life is
governed by religious law which is ultimately based upon the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi>. The
interpretation of law is therefore one of the great concerns of Islam about which scholars
argue it is also one of the major issues today when Islamic societies face MODERNITY and
the challenge of SECULARISM. Islamic APOLOGISTS argue that the women in Islam have always
been able to own property and have enjoyed a much higher status than women in the West.
This claim appears true, in terms of the formal documents, but is highly questionable in
terms of actual practice which tends to make women subordinate to their nearest male
relative.</p>

orphanages, houses for reclaiming prostitutes, schools, centers of poor relief, and even a
system of banking for destitute peasants. Francis XAVIER is perhaps the most famous Jesuit
missionary. By the time of Loyola's death in 1556, the Society was one thousand strong
with its influence being felt more acutely among the aristocracy than the poor. Through
the establishment of Colleges in university settings, the Society became a teaching Order
and a leader in CATHOLIC higher education. The Jesuits strongly supported the POPE at the

<head>JESUS OF NAZARETH (5 B.C.?-30 A.D.?):</head>

<p>the founder of CHRISTIANITY. He was given the
title "Christ" by his followers to acknowledge their BELIEF that he was the
expected MESSIAH of Israel. JEWISH authors reject this claim although some, along with
MUSLIMS, accept that he was a PROPHET&mdash;or at least performed a prophetic role.
Traditionally, however, Jews have regarded Him as an imposter and attacked Him in such
works as the medieval <hi rend="italic">Toledoth Yeshu</hi>. Most of our evidence about his life comes
from CHRISTIAN sources, although he is mentioned by several Roman and Jewish writers.
Although documentary evidence about his life is scant, it is far more extensive and
reliable than for any other ancient figure or religious leader. Very little is known of
his life before the age of thirty:  our only reliable source is the <hi rend="italic">NEW TESTAMENT</hi>
which records many of his sayings, tells about his birth and one incident in Jerusalem at
the age of twelve, all other stories concern his MINISTRY after the age of 30. Tales that
he visited England or India during the hidden years are pure speculation with no basis in
fact. He began proclaiming the KINGDOM OF GOD and the FATHERHOOD OF GOD at around the age
of thirty and his message of REPENTANCE was associated with HEALING and other
extraordinary acts and lasted about three years. Finally, his criticism of corruption and
established religion provoked the TEMPLE authorities in JERUSALEM who conspired to have
him executed. After a summary trial of dubious legality, by both Jewish and ROMAN
authorities, he was executed by crucifixion. His death took place on the eve of the Jewish
PASSOVER. After being buried in a rock tomb for three days, his body disappeared and his
disciples claimed that he had risen from the dead. Forty days later he was said to have
ascended into heaven where he reigns with God. CHRISTIANITY is based upon the story of the
life, death and RESURRECTION of Jesus. In recent years various accounts of his
"death" which assume a swoon and slow recovery followed by flight to Kashmir,
Tibet, even Japan have circulated, however, like the tales about his life before the age
of thirty, such accounts are wild speculations lacking all historical basis.</p>

</div2>
<div2 id="d1041" type="entry">
<head>JUDAISM, ANCIENT:</head>

<p>the religion of the <hi rend="italic">HEBREW BIBLE</hi> which proclaims a COVENANT
between GOD and the PEOPLE OF ISRAEL. From ABRAHAM the JEWISH People develop as a distinct
nation who experience the SALVATION of God and were given His laws by MOSES during the
EXODUS. In Sinai, the Covenant is renewed and the Israelites enter Canaan. A new state
occurs during the second half of the fifth century B.C. when EZRA reorganizes the
community and reinstitutes the Covenant. Slowly HELLENISM influenced Jewish thought and
the theocratic State gave way to a Commonwealth. At the same time a more liberal
interpretation of the <hi rend="italic">TORAH</hi> emerged as Persian and Greek ideas influenced Jewish
thought. Various schools, about which we really know little, such as the PHARISEES,
SADDUCEES, ZEALOTS and the QUMRAN COMMUNITY developed until the religion was brought to an
abrupt end with a revolt against Roman rule and the destruction of JERUSALEM in 70 A.D.</p>

<div2 id="d1042" type="entry">
<head>JUDAISM, MODERN:</head>

<p>when Eastern Europe&mdash;the place of refuge&mdash;became a death trap with
Cossacks slaughtering JEWS, ISRAEL ben Eliezer Ba'al Shem Tov, "The good
master-of-the-name," became spokesman for those who had no learning but a simple
PIETY. He taught the love of nature, music, dancing, direct communion with GOD. His
followers told each other stories:  the peasant who recognized the alphabet and asked God
to order it into the proper prayer and of the boy whose whistling in the synagogue was
more important than the scholars learning. Thus Hasidism arose as a mixture of PIETISM,
MYSTICISM and ANTINOMIANISM which swept through Polish Jews at a time when the Western
religious authority was dying due to the Age of Reason. Hasidism came into its own as the
commercial middle class gained power and confidence and there was a lowering of religious
and class barriers. The largest Jewish community today is in the United States.</p>

<head>JUDAISM, RABBINIC:</head>

<p>after the loss of JERUSALEM and the destruction of the TEMPLE in 70

be found in the <hi rend="italic">TORAH</hi>&mdash;and interpreted by the <hi rend="italic">TALMUD</hi>&mdash;which evidences
concern for the whole of life. The central motive of Rabbinic Judaism was henceforth the

works applying his ideas to METAPHYSICS, ETHICS, aesthetics, RELIGION and philosophy. He
argued that our knowledge of things is conditioned by mental structures or
"categories" that order our experience. As a result we cannot know
"things-in-themselves, "the NOUMENA," but only the PHENOMENA which results
from the interaction between our minds and what is observed. Kant argued that we can
neither prove nor disprove the existence of GOD with the result that religion must be

<p>a loose designation for a wide range or religious thought
unified more by a temper of mind than specific BELIEFS. It originated in the nineteenth

It was characterized by:  (1) an eagerness to discard old ORTHODOXIES when judged
IRRATIONAL in the light of modern knowledge or irrelevant to the central core of religious
experience; (2) a confidence in the power of human REASON guided by experience; (3) a
BELIEF in freedom; (4) a BELIEF in the social NATURE of human existence; (5) a FAITH in
the benevolence of GOD and the goodness of creation. Liberal Protestantism
enthusiastically endorsed BIBLICAL CRITICISM. The movement is generally traced back to the
German THEOLOGIAN Frederick SCHLEIERMACHER and seen in the work of Albrecht RITSCHL who

was characterized by an emphasis on the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man.</p>

<p>a religious movement founded by John and Charles WESLEY and a GROUP of their

MOVEMENT that made a significant impact on the nineteenth century MISSIONARY movement and
Christian enterprise throughout the world. The original movement is today a family of
Churches loosely connected to the World Methodist Council and claims a membership of over
18 million and a community of 40 million. In 1839 John Wesley started a society in London
to promote EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANITY in England. In 1841 he began the training of
Lay-ministers and in 1769 sent his first missionaries to serve in America. Wesley and his
followers finally broke away from ANGLICANISM in 1784 to establish their own CHURCH. With
a few notable exceptions, such as Welsh METHODISM, the movement is strongly ARMINIAN in
theology with a strong social concern. In the twentieth century Methodism has tended to
encourage LIBERAL THEOLOGY and has moved away from its revivalist roots.</p>

SOUL. The most famous mystery religions are the ELEUSINIAN MYSTERIES, ORPHISM, MITHRAISM
and various FORMS of GNOSTICISM.</p>

<div2 id="d1300" type="entry">
<head>MYSTIC:</head>

<p>one who claims to know GOD immediately through a FORM of SPIRITUAL inwardness,
as against knowing through sensation or ratiocination, i.e. through logical processes.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d1301" type="entry">
<head>MYSTICISM:</head>

<p>the implications of this word are often unclear. In the study of RELIGION it
refers to the immediate experience of a SACRED-human relationship, and in particular to
the experiences of oneness with a DIVINE or trans-divine BEING or STATE. It is difficult
to study and describe because MYSTICS tend to claim that their experience is
self-authenticating, and that it cannot be satisfactorily expressed in words. </p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d1302" type="entry">
<head>MYTH:</head>

<p>a myth is a type of narrative which seeks to express in imaginative FORM a BELIEF
about man, the world, and/or GOD or GODS which cannot adequately be expressed in simply
PROPOSITIONS. Since this word is used in both contemporary scientific and theological
literature, any DEFINITION of it appears to be arbitrary. In common language, the word is
used to denote stories that have no basis in FACT. This meaning is too loose for
anthropologists and philosophers. Myths can be contrasted with LEGENDS, fairy tales, etc.
This implies no JUDGMENT on the TRUTH of the story; indeed, it is possible to have a true
story serve as a myth. Critics of myth argue that it tends to open the door to
IRRATIONALISM. Myth has been held to be a truer or deeper version of REALITY than SECULAR
HISTORY, realistic description, or scientific explanation. This view ranges from
irrationalism and post-CHRISTIAN supernaturalism to more sophisticated accounts in which
myths are held to be fundamental expressions of certain properties of the human mind. Myth
is both a very significant and difficult word. One very useful DEFINITION is a story with
culturally formative power that functions to direct the life and thought of INDIVIDUALS
and GROUPS or SOCIETIES.</p>

<head>ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT:</head>

<p>the so-called "PROOF" for the EXISTENCE of GOD which is
distinguished by its claim to be an A PRIORI argument. It is associated with ANSELM of
CANTERBURY who argued that God is the BEING "than which nothing greater can be
conceived." Since existence is greater than non-existence, the greatest conceivable
being must of necessity exist. Therefore God exists necessarily. In a second form of the
argument, Anselm argues that God cannot be conceived as not existing because existence is
logically appropriate to the idea of God as PERFECTION. Therefore either the idea of God
is self-contradictory, or if it is consistent, then God exists necessarily.</p>

<p>a modern CHRISTIAN REVITALIZATION MOVEMENT with roots in the nineteenth

1907, a CHRISTIAN TRADITION, which developed and emphasized the GIFTS of the HOLY SPIRIT
especially HEALING and SPEAKING IN TONGUES. This NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENT began as a
REVITALIZATION MOVEMENT within CHRISTIANITY but quickly led to the formation of various
new DENOMINATIONS such as the ASSEMBLIES OF GOD. In the mid-1960s the movement was spread
by David Du Plessis to the ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH and various MAINLINE PROTESTANT
denominations which had resisted Pentecostal teachings. As a result of the activities of
Du Plessis and other former Pentecostals, the CHARISMATIC MOVEMENT emerged and has since
become the major thrust of modern Pentecostal teachings in addition to developing its own

PROTESTANT REFORMERS denied even this, arguing that perfection is a goal which can never
be attained. John WESLEY, however, taught that in principle all Christians can become
perfect. Critics of perfectionism argue that the doctrine inevitably leads to LEGALISM and
a depressing preoccupation with self-improvement.</p>

<p>a passage of SCRIPTURE appointed to be read in a CHRISTIAN CHURCH.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d1448" type="entry">
<head>PERSON:</head>

<p>in Roman law a person was a legal entity or party to a contract while in Roman
theater a person described the mask worn by the actor to play a specific role. Neither
usage identifies a person as a self-conscious being. CHRISTIAN usage developed from these
Roman ideas with TERTULLIAN who created the formula "three persons in one
Substance" to describe the TRINITY. He argued that GOD was one with respect to his
BEING, NATURE or SUBSTANCE but three with respect to the exercise of his sovereignty.
Jesus Christ was one person having two natures:  divine and human. From this theological
origin the term came to be applied to individual IDENTITY and is often associated with the
SOUL. BUDDHISM denies both the EXISTENCE of the individual person and the soul.</p>



</div2>
<div2 id="d1449" type="entry">
<head>PERSONALISM:</head>

<head>PHENOMENOLOGY OF RELIGION:</head>

<p>a term was first used by the Dutch scholar Chantepie de la
Saussaye in 1887 which has affinities with HUSSERL'S PHENOMENOLOGY. It attempts to gain

attempts to place themselves in the position of the believer to understand what a BELIEF
means to someone who accepts its TRUTH.</p>

<head>PLATO (427?-347 BC):</head>

<p>Greek philosopher of aristocratic Athenian descent who saw Athens
decline politically and commercially as a result of the Peloponnesian War 431-404 BC. He
founded the Academy (perhaps in 386 B.C.) which became the first endowed university and
flourished until it closed in 529 A.D. Plato held that the material and sensible world is
merely a temporary copy of permanent unchanging FORMS, which are the object of all real
knowledge. True ethical values are attained only by those individuals who have the proper
perspective of SOUL or MIND and who place REASON above the baser elements of their
personality. The best government is possible only when philosophers, who are rational
members of the State, become rulers. His teacher was SOCRATES and ARISTOTLE was his

<head>PLYMOUTH BRETHREN:</head>

<p>one of the most influential NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS to emerge in the
nineteenth century; founded by John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) in 1830. The Brethren split
into a number of different groups including the extremist EXCLUSIVE BRETHREN and moderate
OPEN BRETHREN. Despite their small size, they have had an immense influence on MODERN
CHRISTIANITY. Their emphasis on the imminent RETURN OF CHRIST helped popularize both
PREMILLENIALISM and DISPENSATIONALISM while their rejection of a paid CLERGY fostered the
growth of HOUSE CHURCH MOVEMENTS and similar anti-clerical groups. They have been
particularly influential in the field of MISSIONS where their idea of FAITH MISSIONS
influenced groups as diverse as the CHINA INLAND MISSION and L'ABRI. On the negative side
many prominent anti-Christian figures, like Alister CROWLEY, came from Brethren homes.</p>

<head>POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC:</head>

<p>the logical FALLACY which assumes that because "A"

someone who eats ice cream and then claims that the ice cream caused their headache has
committed this fallacy. The ice cream may or may not have caused the headache but the
observation that it preceded the headache does not prove that it caused it. Further

<head>PRESBYTERIANISM:</head>

<p>a GROUP of PROTESTANT CHURCHES arising out of the CALVINIST

SYNOD. Finally there is the General Assembly or National Synod. Each court consists of
Elders and Ministers who appoint new Ministers and determine the policy of both local
CONGREGATIONS and the Church as a whole. The two other major methods of Church government
are CONGREGATIONAL and EPISCOPAL. Presbyterianism first appeared in Scotland in the late
sixteenth century and spread throughout the world. Today there are over 120 independent
Presbyterian Churches loosely united in the WORLD ALLIANCE OF REFORMED CHURCHES. Apart
from their distinct method of Church Government, they accept CALVINIST CREEDS the most

</div2>
<div2 id="d1520" type="entry">
<head>PROBLEM OF EVIL:</head>

<p>the TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHIC and practical problem which asks how an
all knowing and all powerful GOD, who is both the CREATOR of the UNIVERSE and by
definition GOOD, can allow SUFFERING and EVIL. It concerns the basic human problem of
MEANING and significance in the face of DEATH and suffering. It is often seen as a
particularly difficult question for THEISM which attributes both power and goodness to the
DEITY creating the famous dilemma:  either GOD is able to prevent EVIL and will not, or, He
is willing to prevent it and cannot. If the former, he is not merciful; if the latter, he
is not OMNIPOTENT. It is, however, an equally great problem for all people who think about
the meaning of life. Various religions answer it in different ways. In HINDUISM it is
answered in terms of KARMA and MY with the great dialogue between ARUNJA and KRISHNA in
the <hi rend="italic">BHAGAVAD-GTA</hi>. BUDDHISM meets the problem by stating that all life is
characterized by impermanence which can be escaped through the attainment of NIRVNA.
JUDAISM and ISLAM find the solution in submission to the WILL of GOD, while CHRISTIANITY
presents a complex answer beginning with the FALL and ending in the ATONEMENT. The biggest
difference between the YOGIC and ABRAMIC solutions to this problem is that Yogic religions
see it in terms of ONTOLOGY while the Abramic religions recognize a MORAL issue.</p>

<head>Q:</head>

<p>the symbol used by <hi rend="italic">NEW TESTAMENT</hi> scholars to refer to supposed common
material found in the <hi rend="italic">Gospels of Matthew</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Luke</hi>. It stands for the
German word "Quelle" meaning "source." The theory of "Q" was
introduced by nineteenth century German Biblical critics and vigorously propagated by Dr.
Streeter, an Oxford professor, who argued that an original text "Q" lay behind
the <hi rend="italic">Gospels</hi> we know today. His views and the way they were enforced was strongly
criticized by various scholars, including F. W. Farmer, though they remain widely accepted

<div2 id="d1558" type="entry">
<head>QUAKERS:</head>

<p>a small PROTESTANT GROUP known as the SOCIETY OF FRIENDS which arose in the

leading of the HOLY SPIRIT, or INNER LIGHT, rejected the SACRAMENTS, insisted on
"plain speech," simple dress and repudiated all FORMS of art including music.
There are two possible origins of the name:  the first is derived from Fox's call to
Justice Bennet in 1650 that he should "quake" before the WORD OF GOD; the second
meaning comes from some members of the group who shook or quaked during services. Strongly
pacifist, the Quakers have been very active in SOCIAL REFORM and education.</p>

<head>QUANTUM THEORY:</head>

<p>classical physics as developed by NEWTON held that it was possible to

modern physics recognized that we can know either the speed or the position of a particle
but not both. The implication of these findings, which were given expression in the work
of Nils BOHR, Max PLANCK and Albert EINSTEIN, is that the older mechanistic view of the
physical UNIVERSE which was essentially deterministic no longer holds true. As a result,
arguments such as those of David HUME against the possibility of MIRACLES are no longer as

<head>QURA'N:</head>

<p>the HOLY BOOK of ISLAM which was REVEALED by GOD through the ANGEL GABRIEL to
MUHAMMUD who commissioned various scribes to record it. The name means "that which is
'read' or 'recited.'" The essential teachings are that God is One and that He demands
absolute submission from mankind; hence the name of the religion:  ISLAM. MUSLIMS believe
that the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> was given by WAHY&mdash;REVELATION&mdash;which is not to be confused with
ILHM or INSPIRATION. For Muslims the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> <hi rend="italic">is</hi> the eternal WORD OF GOD
and as such is a DIVINE attribute. Islamic teaching about the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> does not
correspond to CHRISTIAN views about the person of CHRIST as the INCARNATION of God
instead, Christ is seen by the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> as a prophet of God. While Christians
believe that the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi> was inspired by God they also accept that it was written
by men. Muslims reject such a view insisting that the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> is uniquely the Word
of God without human intervention. Therefore, while it is correct to speak of PAUL as the
author of <hi rend="italic">Romans</hi>, it is incorrect to say that the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> was written by
Muhammad. Nevertheless, originally a number of variant readings existed which were
destroyed on the orders of AB BAKR to avoid confusion and the type of problem CHRISTIANS
face with the SYNOPTIC GOSPELS. A further difficulty involves the question of translation.
Because the <hi rend="italic">QUR'N</hi> is believed to have been spoken by God its language is SACRED
and considered inimitable, therefore, pious Muslims argue that it cannot be translated and
only truly exists in Arabic. To the extent that English versions exist, they must be
regarded as renditions rather than translations. Such an approach is taken by Marmaduke
Pickthall in his <hi rend="italic">The Meaning of the Glorious Qur'n</hi> (1930).</p>

loyalty Rma questions. St throws herself on a pyre but the fire GOD, AGNI, refuses to
accept her SACRIFICE and Rma realizes her innocence. After returning to his kingdom and
assuming the throne his people again question St's purity creating doubts which cause Rma
to send her away. She gives birth to twins and asks the earth to swallow her, which it
does, thus finally proving her innocence. Years later Rma recognizes the twins and give
them his kingdom allowing him to return to HEAVEN as VISHNU. The epic, which is around

<head>REFORMATION:</head>

<p>a term which has come to mean any religious movement which REFORMS a
pre-existing TRADITION to restore its primitive purity or ORTHODOXY. More specifically it
is associated with the religious movement that began with the protest of Martin LUTHER
against the SALE of INDULGENCES in Germany in 1517. It led to the creation of independent
CHURCHES which renounced the claims of the PAPACY and sought to return to a thoroughly
Biblical CHRISTIANITY. The REFORMERS taught that the <hi rend="italic">BIBLE</hi> is the only source of
FAITH and DOCTRINE, rejected TRANSUBSTANTIATION, INDULGENCES, the WORSHIP OF SAINTS and
MARY, emphasized JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH and proclaimed the PRIESTHOOD OF ALL BELIEVERS.
Known as PROTESTANTS, because of Luther's protest against widespread corruption in the
ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, the Reformation quickly spread throughout Northern Europe and made
significant inroads into Southern European countries where it was eventually defeated by
the COUNTER REFORMATION and the INQUISITION which ruthlessly persecuted Protestants as
HERETICS who were burnt at the stake. The movement broke into several branches led by
Martin LUTHER, and Ulrich ZWINGLI, Menno SIMONS and the ANGLICAN TRADITION originating in
England.</p>

SACRED from the SECULAR; the veneration and support of what is supposed to be a HISTORIC
or authentic TRADITION which is often identified with religious ORTHODOXY; a MILLENARIAN
or APOCALYPTIC response which sees the modern age as doomed and looks for SALVATION to the
direct intervention of GOD or GODS in the affairs of the world; the identification of the
modern, or ideas taken to be modern, with religion and the claim that modern values

<div2 id="d1619" type="entry">
<head>RELIGION, TYPOLOGIES OF REACTION TO MODERNITY:</head>

<p>in practice religious reactions to

traditions; an accommodation to the new which maintains an organic connection to some
older tradition; attempts to reject the new and preserve the old or what is seen as
ancient traditions; a strident re-assertion of the old or traditional BELIEFS and
practices in a new condensed, "purified" or REDUCTIONIST form; the creation of
GROUPS which self-consciously celebrate the modern and denigrate tradition and old ways or

<head>RELIGION:</head>

<p>hundreds of different definitions of religion exist each reflecting either a
scholarly or a DOGMATIC bias depending in the last resort on the PRESUPPOSITIONS of the
person making the definition. Religion clearly contains intellectual, RITUAL, SOCIAL and
ETHICAL elements, bound together by an explicit or implicit BELIEF in the REALITY of an
unseen world, whether this belief be expressed in SUPERNATURALISTIC or IDEALISTIC terms. A
number of the more common definitions are:</p>

<p>BERGER, Peter -"the human enterprise by which a SACRED cosmos is
established."</p>
<p>DURKHEIM Emile -"a unified system of BELIEFS and practices relative to SACRED
things."</p>
<p>FRAZER, James -"a propitiation or conciliation of powers superior to man which
are believed to direct or control the course of NATURE and human life."</p>
<p>HEGEL, George -"the knowledge possessed by the finite mind of its NATURE as
ABSOLUTE mind."</p>
<p>JAMES, William -"the BELIEF that there is an unseen order, and that our supreme
GOOD lies in harmoniously adjusting ourselves thereto."</p>
<p>KANT, Immanuel -"the recognition of all our duties as divine commands."</p>
<p>MARX, Karl -" the SELF-conscious and SELF-feeling of man who has either not found
himself or has already lost himself again... the general theory of the world... its logic
in a popular FORM... its moral sanction, its solemn completion, its universal ground for
consolation and justification. It is the fantastic realization of the human
essence..."</p>
<p>SCHLEIERMACHER, Friedrich -"a feeling for the infinite" and "a feeling
of ABSOLUTE dependence."</p>
<p>SMART, Ninian -"a set of institutionalized RITUALS with a TRADITION and
expressing and/or evoking sacral sentiments directed at a divine or trans-divine focus
seen in the context of the human phenomenological environment and at least partially
described by MYTHS or by myths and doctrines.</p>
<p>STARK, Rodney -"any socially organized pattern of BELIEFS and practices
concerning ultimate meaning that assumes the EXISTENCE of the SUPERNATURAL."</p>
<p>WHITEHEAD, Alfred North -"what the individual does with his own
solitariness."</p>
<p>WEBER, Max -"to say what it <hi rend="underline">is</hi>, is not possible... the essence of religion

UPANISHADS</hi> and other religious literature. BUDDHISM treats the sayings of the BUDDHA
as a FORM of revelation although it denies the involvement of God while JAINISM denies all
SUPERNATURAL sources of revelation. In other TRADITIONS, revelation comes from ANCESTORS
and GODS for specific purposes. Traditionally the ABRAMIC religions have claimed that
revelation ended with the CANON of their SCRIPTURES. Claims about continuing revelation
have led to REVITALIZATION MOVEMENTS and religious REVIVALISM which often provoked the
wrath of the ORTHODOX who saw such claims as HERESY. Recently such ideas have become
popular in the Christian CHARISMATIC MOVEMENT where PROPHETS and PROPHECY are an
increasingly common phenomena.</p>

<head>RG VEDA:</head>

<p>the most ancient book of HINDUISM which consists of Four collections of VEDIC
HYMNS composed before 900 B.C. and preserved in ORAL TRADITION until they were written
down in the sixteenth century and later by MUSLIMS in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries. The hymns were used in SACRIFICIAL RITUALS by BRAHMINS and are treated as
eternally existent. There are 1028 hymns which refer to the GODS; the most important of
which are INDRA, AGNI, VARUA, and SOMA. VISHNU and RUDRA are present but as minor deities.

<head>RITSCHL, Albrecht (1822-1889):</head>

<p>major LIBERAL or MODERNIST German PROTESTANT theologian
who rejected all FORMS of NATURAL THEOLOGY, MYSTICISM and METAPHYSICS arguing that
THEOLOGY must concentrate on moral and ethical issues. He interpreted JUSTIFICATION and
FORGIVENESS OF SINS as something achieved through the CHURCH which is the COMMUNITY for
which JESUS died and SIN as selfishness or deeds of men in opposition to the achievement
of the KINGDOM OF GOD. CHRIST's death therefore was no longer to be viewed as a
PROPITIATION for sin but rather the sharing of His consciousness of Sonship. In all of
this Ritschl rejected traditional views of ORIGINAL SIN, INCARNATION, REVELATION,
RESURRECTION and the CHURCH. He also created a chasm between the JESUS OF HISTORY and the
CHRIST OF FAITH. His major works include <hi rend="italic">The Christian Doctrine of Justification and
Reconciliation</hi> (18760-1874) and <hi rend="italic">The History of Pietism</hi> (1880-1885, 3 vols.).</p>

<div2 id="d1640" type="entry">
<head>RITUAL:</head>

<p>SACRED custom or any FORM of repetitive behavior which is fixed by TRADITION.
In the study of RELIGION it means "traditional religious behavior or actions."
The ritual element in religion cannot easily be separated from FAITH and BELIEF. Religious
ritual presupposes the EXISTENCE of a supernatural or DIVINE order, revealed natural
occurrences such as the alternation of life and death, day and night, the movements of
heavenly bodies and the progression of the seasons. Rituals are of many types but common
to them all is the conviction that what is being done on earth approximates the divine or
supernaturally revealed order. Religious REFORMATIONS or REVITALIZATION MOVEMENTS often
interpret their own reactions against the ritual expressions of another group as a total
rejection of RITUAL but this is mistaken. The PLYMOUTH BRETHREN reject the ROMAN CATHOLIC
High MASS on theological grounds as "dead ritual" yet, in fact, their own
services have complex rituals even though the participants usually do not recongnize the
fact. Each ritual corresponds to and must be understood in terms of a body of convictions
concerning the DIVINE and mankind and the relationship between the two.</p>

</div2>
<div2 id="d1642" type="entry">
<head>ROMAN CATHOLICISM:</head>

<p>in the past it was relatively easy to describe Catholicism.
Twentieth century developments make this a much more complex task. The dogmatic
formulation may be found in the decrees of the COUNCIL OF TRENT, the CREED OF POPE PIUS
IV, the decrees of the VATICAN COUNCILS, Papal utterances claiming INFALLIBILITY, and the
body of Roman Catholic CANON law. Alongside these there are the LITURGY, and the
hierarchically organization of the CHURCH. Roman Catholicism claims that the SACRAMENTS
which are ministered by the CHURCH are channels of GRACE that flow from GOD to the
recipient. There are seven SACRAMENTS:  Baptism, Confirmation, the Mass, Holy Orders,
Penance, Matrimony, Extreme Unction. The focal point of traditional Roman Catholic WORSHIP
is the Mass. It is interpreted as TRANSUBSTANTIATION, a DOGMA first promulgated in 1215
asserting that the substance of the bread and wine used in the RITUAL actually become the
body, blood, SOUL and DIVINITY of CHRIST. Confession to PRIESTS has played a key role in
Roman Catholicism which alongside the doctrine of PURGATORY led to the practice of the
SALE of INDULGENCES in the sixteenth century. Another prominent feature is the CULT of
MARY which stems from the mother GODDESS of the Mediterranean world who bore such titles
as "Star of the Sea" and played the role of "Our Lady" of various
cities.</p>

<div2 id="d1643" type="entry">
<head>ROMANTICISM:</head>

<p>a movement in art, literature, PHILOSOPHY, and RELIGION, in the latter
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries which was sentimental, full of expression, and
idealized melancholy. The movement arose as a reaction to the RATIONALISM of the
ENLIGHTENMENT and stressed emotionalism, sensualism, fantasy, and imagination over
rational order and control. REALITY is found through feeling, immediate experience,
spiritual illumination, brooding, and listening to the inner voices. Romantics had a deep
interest in the past, especially the Middle Ages and non-CLASSICAL, Nordic, mythology,
folklore, and primitivism. They published medieval historical records and literature. The
impact of romanticism on RELIGION and THEOLOGY is immense. In America it stimulated
TRANSCENDENTALISM and an interest in Eastern religions; in Britain the ROMANTICS tended to
view the CHURCH with indifference or join the OXFORD MOVEMENT; in Germany the majority
moved towards a Germanic NATIONALISM.</p>

a form of therapy known as DIANETICS. This dealt with workings of the human mind and aimed at
 relieving emotional traumas. In the process Hubbard came to believe that the human spirit
animates the mind, is immortal, and can resolve its own problems. As aa result he created Scientology
 as a religious movement. Through Scientology, and the methods Hubbard taught, an individual discovers
 they are a SPIRITUAL being, or THETAN, and learn to becomes their own SAVIOR thus gaining
spiritual freedom. Scientology uses the language of SCIENCE to promote a Westernized version
of YOGIC RELIGION supported by the rich MYTHOLOGY found in Hubbard's science
fiction novels. Although many attempts have been made to deny the
religious NATURE of Scientology, it has too many features of actual
RELIGIONS to be dismissed as a pious fraud or SECULAR PHILOSOPHY.</p>

<head>SOUL:</head>

<p>the immortal element in human beings sometimes regarded as our true SELF. The
EXISTENCE of the soul is denied in BUDDHISM and certain FORMS of HINDUISM. Other HINDU
philosophies teach the existence of the soul which is integral to the notion of

CONCEPT was the RESURRECTION of the body rather than the IMMORTALITY of the soul which
gradually replaced the earlier emphasis.</p>

<div2 id="d1817" type="entry">
<head>SPIRITISM:</head>

<p>a mode of thought and more importantly behavior based on the BELIEF that the
SPIRITS of the dead and other spirits interact and sometimes even communicate with the
living. Such intercourse normally takes place through dreams, illness and unusual events
which reveal the presence of a spirit. When the spirit disturbs the living, a SHAMAN or
similar religious expert is called in to solve the problem and if appropriate directly
contact the spirit or spirits concerned. Appeasement of the spirit often involves
SACRIFICE and RITUALS which appear similar to GROUP therapy.</p>

<div2 id="d1818" type="entry">
<head>SPIRITS:</head>

<p>disembodied entities which display the characteristics of INDIVIDUAL PERSONS

<div2 id="d1821" type="entry">
<head>SPIRITUALISM:</head>

<p>a modern FORM of SPIRITISM dating from 1848, when two teen-age sisters,
Margaretta and Katie Fox, of Hydesville, New York, reported "rappings" in their
home. They interpreted these noises as messages from a peddler who had died in the house.
Enthusiasm for spiritualism swept the North America spreading to Europe and Latin America.
The teachings of SWEDENBORG and bitter rivalry between competing CHRISTIAN DENOMINATIONS
and a growing awareness of the problems of BIBLICAL CRITICISM, as presented by FREE
THINKERS like BRADLAUGH and PAINE, may be seen as a contributing factor to the growth of
the spiritualist movement. After rapid growth in the 1850s, when by some estimates
something like 75% of Americans visited spiritualists, enthusiasm declined. Spiritualist
ideas have had an influence far greater than the number of committed spiritualists would
suggest making an important contribution to the growth of NEW RELIGIOUS MOVEMENTS. In
places like Brazil, spiritualism has encouraged the growth of SYNCRATISM between ROMAN
CATHOLIC, TRADITIONAL AFRICAN and Native American religious TRADITIONS.</p>

<p>an inductive argument from observations about the presence of

begins by assuming that someone who has never seen a clockwork watch before accidentally
discovers one. Paley goes on to say that after careful examination of the design and
operation of the watch, any reasonable person would conclude that the watch was man made,
therefore, he reasons, anyone who carefully observes the UNIVERSE must ultimately reach
the conclusion that it displays characteristics indicating the presence of a mind behind
its design. Although strongly attacked by David HUME, this FORM of argument has been
revived recently by a number of statisticians and astrophysicists.</p>

of truth have dominated Western philosophy:  the COHERENCE THEORY which states that truth
is known by its coherence within a system of ideas, while the CORRESPONDENCE THEORY sees
truth as corresponding to an external REALITY. Other theories of truth include PRAGMATISM,
that which works is true; and various SCIENTIFIC theories of involving experimentation and
VERIFICATION or the ideas of POPPER based on falsification rather than verification.</p>

the inspiration of the HOLY SPIRIT. He defined its task as renewing the religious life of

symbolic meanings. There are three main schools of Vednta that of Advaita which promotes
MONISM; Viidvaita or qualified NON-DUALISM and Dvaita which is a FORM of DUALISM. All
three are similar to PLATONISM in aiming to go beyond the limits of EMPIRICAL observation
to explore the NATURE of BRAHMAN. Both AKARA and RMNUJA taught forms of Vednta even though
they presented sharply differing interpretations of the TRADITION. In the late nineteenth
century various thinkers sought to create a synthesis between various aspects of Vednta
and Western forms of IDEALISM while Vivekananda, RADHAKRISHNAN and SRI AUROBINDO adapted

<head>VICIOUS CIRCLE:</head>

<p>the logical FALLACY which involves supporting an argument by circular
reasoning where the conclusion has already been used to support a premise upon which the
conclusion is based. Generally it means using a statement to support a second statement

essentially the same thing as the first statement. For example:  one might argue that the
Beatles are better musicians than Bach because people who know about music prefer the
Beatles. When asked who these people are who know about music, one is told it is people

<head>WITCHCRAFT:</head>

<p>a widespread system of BELIEFS and practices involving supernatural power
and agencies thought to influence human affairs. It is generally distinguished from
SORCERY and takes many FORMS in different CULTURES. Sometimes the conscious action of
individuals is involved, on other occasions it operates without conscious effort as a
result of inherited powers or alien forces. Since the ENLIGHTENMENT it has been usual to
regard witchcraft as an IRRATIONAL system of beliefs belonging to a primitive past. But,
anthropologists, beginning with EVANS-PRITCHARD, have shown that witchcraft involves a
system of thought which once accepted follows a logical pattern. In the West popular
belief in witchcraft died out during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries to be
revived in the late nineteenth century by GARDNER and other OCCULTISTS as a form of RITUAL
MAGIC and continues today with groups like WICCA. In other parts of the world witchcraft
has never died out although its manifestation is very different due to the SOCIAL setting
from modern witchcraft in the West.</p>
