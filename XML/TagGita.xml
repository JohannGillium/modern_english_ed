				<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

				<p>A few days ago I said to a distinguished Bengali doctor of medicine, `I know no
					German, yet if a translation of a German poet had moved me, I would go to the
					British Museum and find books in English that would tell me something of his
					life, and of the history of his thought. But though these prose translations
					from Rabindranath Tagore have stirred my blood as nothing has for years, I shall
					not know anything of his life, and of the movements of thought that have made
					them possible, if some Indian traveller will not tell me.' It seemed to him
					natural that I should be moved, for he said, `I read <pb n="viii"/> Rabindranath
					every day, to read one line of his is to forget all the troubles of the world.'
					I said, `An Englishman living in London in the reign of Richard the Second had
					he been shown translations from Petrarch or from Dante, would have found no
					books to answer his questions, but would have questioned some Florentine banker
					or Lombard merchant as I question you. For all I know, so abundant and simple is
					this poetry, the new renaissance has been born in your country and I shall never
					know of it except by hearsay.' He answered, `We have other poets, but none that
					are his equal; we call this the epoch of Rabindranath. No poet seems to me as
					famous in Europe as he is among us. He is as great in music as in poetry, and
					his sons are sung from the west of India into Burma wherever Bengali is spoken.
					He was already famous at nineteen when <pb n="ix"/> he wrote his first novel;
					and plays when he was but little older, are still played in Calcutta. I so much
					admire the completeness of his life; when he was very young he wrote much of
					natural objects, he would sit all day in his garden; from his twenty-fifth year
					or so to his thirty-fifth perhaps, when he had a great sorrow, he wrote the most
					beautiful love poetry in our language'; and then he said with deep emotion,
					`words can never express what I owed at seventeen to his love poetry. After that
					his art grew deeper, it became religious and philosophical; all the inspiration
					of mankind are in his hymns. He is the first among our saints who has not
					refused to live, but has spoken out of Life itself, and that is why we give him
					our love.' I may have changed his well-chosen words in my memory but not his
					thought. `A little while ago he <pb n="x"/> was to read divine service in one of
					our churches &mdash; we of the Brahma Samaj use your word `church' in
					English &mdash; it was the largest in Calcutta and not only was it crowded,
					but the streets were all but impassable because of the people.' </p>
				<p>Other Indians came to see me and their reverence for this man sounded strange in
					our world, where we hide great and little things under the same veil of obvious
					comedy and half-serious depreciation. When we were making the cathedrals had we
					a like reverence for our great men? `Every morning at three &mdash; I know,
					for I have seen it' &mdash; one said to me, `he sits immovable in
					contemplation, and for two hours does not awake from his reverie upon the nature
					of God. His father, the Maha Rishi, would sometimes sit there all through the
					next day; once, upon a <pb n="xi"/> river, he fell into contemplation because of
					the beauty of the landscape, and the rowers waited for eight hours before they
					could continue their journey.' He then told me of Mr. Tagore's family and how
					for generations great men have come out of its cradles. `Today,' he said, `there
					are Gogonendranath and Abanindranath Tagore, who are artists; and Dwijendranath,
					Rabindranath's brother, who is a great philosopher. The squirrels come from the
					boughs and climb on to his knees and the birds alight upon his hands.' I notice
					in these men's thought a sense of visible beauty and meaning as though they held
					that doctrine of Nietzsche that we must not believe in the moral or intellectual
					beauty which does not sooner or later impress itself upon physical things. I
					said, `In the East you know how to keep a family illustrious. The other day the
					curator of a <pb n="xii"/> museum pointed out to me a little dark-skinned man
					who was arranging their Chinese prints and said, ``That is the hereditary
					connoisseur of the Mikado, he is the fourteenth of his family to hold the post.'
					He answered, `When Rabindranath was a boy he had all round him in his home
					literature and music.' I thought of the abundance, of the simplicity of the
					poems, and said, `In your country is there much propagandist writing, much
					criticism? We have to do so much, especially in my own country, that our minds
					gradually cease to be creative, and yet we cannot help it. If our life was not a
					continual warfare, we would not have taste, we would not know what is good, we
					would not find hearers and readers. Four-fifths of our energy is spent in the
					quarrel with bad taste, whether in our own minds or in the minds of others.' `I
					understand,' <pb n="xiii"/> he replied, `we too have our propagandist writing.
					In the villages they recite long mythological poems adapted from the Sanskrit in
					the Middle Ages, and they often insert passages telling the people that they
					must do their duties.' </p>
				<p>have carried the manuscript of these translations about with me for days,
					reading it in railway trains, or on the top of omnibuses and in restaurants, and
					I have often had to close it lest some stranger would see how much it moved me.
					These lyrics &mdash; which are in the original, my Indians tell me, full of
					subtlety of rhythm, of untranslatable delicacies of colour, of metrical
					invention &mdash; display in their thought a world I have dreamed of all my
					live long. The work of a supreme culture, they yet appear as <pb n="xiv"/> much
					the growth of the common soil as the grass and the rushes. A tradition, where
					poetry and religion are the same thing, has passed through the centuries,
					gathering from learned and unlearned metaphor and emotion, and carried back
					again to the multitude the thought of the scholar and of the noble. If the
					civilization of Bengal remains unbroken, if that common mind which &mdash;
					as one divines &mdash; runs through all, is not, as with us, broken into a
					dozen minds that know nothing of each other, something even of what is most
					subtle in these verses will have come, in a few generations, to the beggar on
					the roads. When there was but one mind in England, Chaucer wrote his <hi
						rend="italic">Troilus and Cressida</hi>, and thought he had written to be
					read, or to be read out &mdash; for our time was coming on apace &mdash;
					he was sung by minstrels for a while. Rabindranath <pb n="xv"/> Tagore, like
					Chaucer's forerunners, writes music for his words, and one understands at every
					moment that he is so abundant, so spontaneous, so daring in his passion, so full
					of surprise, because he is doing something which has never seemed strange,
					unnatural, or in need of defence. These verses will not lie in little
					well-printed books upon ladies' tables, who turn the pages with indolent hands
					that they may sigh over a life without meaning, which is yet all they can know
					of life, or be carried by students at the university to be laid aside when the
					work of life begins, but, as the generations pass, travellers will hum them on
					the highway and men rowing upon the rivers. Lovers, while they await one
					another, shall find, in murmuring them, this love of God a magic gulf wherein
					their own more bitter passion may bathe and renew its youth. At every <pb
						n="xvi"/> moment the heart of this poet flows outward to these without
					derogation or condescension, for it has known that they will understand; and it
					has filled itself with the circumstance of their lives. The traveller in the
					read-brown clothes that he wears that dust may not show upon him, the girl
					searching in her bed for the petals fallen from the wreath of her royal lover,
					the servant or the bride awaiting the master's home-coming in the empty house,
					are images of the heart turning to God. Flowers and rivers, the blowing of conch
					shells, the heavy rain of the Indian July, or the moods of that heart in union
					or in separation; and a man sitting in a boat upon a river playing lute, like
					one of those figures full of mysterious meaning in a Chinese picture, is God
					Himself. A whole people, a whole civilization, <pb n="xvii"/> immeasurably
					strange to us, seems to have been taken up into this imagination; and yet we are
					not moved because of its strangeness, but because we have met our own image, as
					though we had walked in Rossetti's willow wood, or heard, perhaps for the first
					time in literature, our voice as in a dream. </p>
				<p>Since the Renaissance the writing of European saints &mdash; however familiar
					their metaphor and the general structure of their thought &mdash; has ceased
					to hold our attention. We know that we must at last forsake the world, and we
					are accustomed in moments of weariness or exaltation to consider a voluntary
					forsaking; but how can we, who have read so much poetry, seen so many paintings,
					listened to so much music, where the cry of the flesh and the cry of the soul
					seems one, forsake it harshly and rudely? What have we in common <pb n="xviii"/>
					with St. Bernard covering his eyes that they may not dwell upon the beauty of
					the lakes of Switzerland, or with the violent rhetoric of the Book of
					Revelations? We would, if we might, find, as in this book, words full of
					courtesy. `I have got my leave. Bid me farewell, my brothers! I bow to you all
					and take my departure. Here I give back the keys of my door &mdash; and I
					give up all claims to my house. I only ask for last kind words from you. We were
					neighbours for long, but I received more than I could give. Now the day has
					dawned and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out. A summons has come and I am
					ready for my journey.' And it is our own mood, when it is furthest from `a
					Kempis or John of the Cross, that cries, `And because I love this life, I know I
					shall love death as well.' Yet it is not only in our thoughts of the parting
					that this book <pb n="xix"/> fathoms all. We had not known that we loved God,
					hardly it may be that we believed in Him; yet looking backward upon our life we
					discover, in our exploration of the pathways of woods, in our delight in the
					lonely places of hills, in that mysterious claim that we have made, unavailingly
					on the woman that we have loved, the emotion that created this insidious
					sweetness. `Entering my heart unbidden even as one of the common crowd, unknown
					to me, my king, thou didst press the signet of eternity upon many a fleeting
					moment.' This is no longer the sanctity of the cell and of the scourge; being
					but a lifting up, as it were, into a greater intensity of the mood of the
					painter, painting the dust and the sunlight, and we go for a like voice to St.
					Francis and to William Blake who have seemed so alien in our violent history. </p>


				<pb n="xx"/>





				<p>We write long books where no page perhaps has any quality to make writing a
					pleasure, being confident in some general design, just as we fight and make
					money and fill our heads with politics &mdash; all dull things in the doing
					&mdash; while Mr. Tagore, like the Indian civilization itself, has been
					content to discover the soul and surrender himself to its spontaneity. He often
					seems to contrast life with that of those who have loved more after our fashion,
					and have more seeming weight in the world, and always humbly as though he were
					only sure his way is best for him: `Men going home glance at me and smile and
					fill me with shame. I sit like a beggar maid, drawing my skirt over my face, and
					when they ask me, what it is I want, I drop <pb n="xxi"/> my eyes and answer
					them not.' At another time, remembering how his life had once a different shape,
					he will say, `Many an hour I have spent in the strife of the good and the evil,
					but now it is the pleasure of my playmate of the empty days to draw my heart on
					to him; and I know not why this sudden call to what useless inconsequence.' An
					innocence, a simplicity that one does not find elsewhere in literature makes the
					birds and the leaves seem as near to him as they are near to children, and the
					changes of the seasons great events as before our thoughts had arisen between
					them and us. At times I wonder if he has it from the literature of Bengal or
					from religion, and at other times, remembering the birds alighting on his
					brother's hands, I find pleasure in thinking it hereditary, a mystery that was
					growing through the centuries like the courtesy <pb n="xxii"/> of a Tristan or a
					Pelanore. Indeed, when he is speaking of children, so much a part of himself
					this quality seems, one is not certain that he is not also speaking of the
					saints, `They build their houses with sand and they play with empty shells. With
					withered leaves they weave their boats and smilingly float them on the vast
					deep. Children have their play on the seashore of worlds. They know not how to
					swim, they know not how to cast nets. Pearl fishers dive for pearls, merchants
					sail in their ships, while children gather pebbles and scatter them again. They
					seek not for hidden treasures, they know not how to cast nets.' </p>

				<p>The night darkened. Our day's works had been done. We thought that the last guest
					had arrived for the night and the doors in the village were all shut. Only some
					said the king was to come. We laughed and said `No, it cannot be!' </p>
				<p>It seemed there were knocks at the door and we said it was nothing but the wind.
					We put out the lamps and lay down to sleep. Only some said, `It is the
					messenger!' We laughed and said `No, it must be the wind!' </p>
				<p>There came a sound in the dead of the night. We sleepily thought it was the
					distant thunder. The earth shook, the walls rocked, and it troubled us in our
					sleep. Only some said it was the sound of wheels. We said in a drowsy murmur,
					`No, it must be the rumbling of clouds!' <pb n="45" id="TagGita45"/>
				</p>
				<p>The night was still dark when the drum sounded. The voice came `Wake up! delay
					not!' We pressed our hands on our hearts and shuddered with fear. Some said,
					`Lo, there is the king's flag!' We stood up on our feet and cried `There is no
					time for delay!' </p>
				<p>The king has come &mdash; but where are lights, where are wreaths? Where is
					the throne to seat him? Oh, shame! Oh utter shame! Where is the hall, the
					decorations? Someone has said, `Vain is this cry! Greet him with empty hands,
					lead him into thy rooms all bare!' </p>
				<p>Open the doors, let the conch-shells be sounded! in the depth of the night has
					come the king of our dark, dreary house. The thunder roars in the sky. The
					darkness shudders with lightning. Bring out thy tattered piece of mat and spread
					it in the courtyard. With the storm has come <pb n="46" id="TagGita46"/> of a
					sudden our king of the fearful night. </p>

					Thou hast taken every moment of my life in thine own hands. </p>
				<p>Hidden in the heart of things thou art nourishing seeds into sprouts, buds into
					blossoms, and ripening flowers into fruitfulness. </p>
				<p>I was tired and sleeping on my idle bed and imagined all work had ceased. <pb

				<p>Time is endless in thy hands, my lord. There is none to count thy minutes. </p>
				<p>Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers. Thou knowest how to
					wait. </p>
				<p>Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower. </p>
				<p>We have no time to lose, and having no time we must scramble for a chances. We
					are too poor to be late. </p>
				<p>And thus it is that time goes by while I give it to every querulous man who
					claims it, and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last. </p>
				<p>At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate to be shut; but I find that
					yet there is time. </p>

				<p>Mother, I shall weave a chain of pearls for thy neck with my tears of sorrow. </p>
				<p>The stars have wrought their anklets of light to deck thy feet, but mine will
					hang upon thy breast. </p>
				<p>Wealth and fame come from thee and it is for thee to give or to withhold them.

				<p>It is the pang of separation that spreads throughout the world and gives birth to
