</p><p><stage>Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX,	SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
<p>Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France<lb/>
In my behavior to the majesty,<lb/>
The borrow'd majesty, of England here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
<p>Philip of France, in right and true behalf<lb/>
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,<lb/>
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim<lb/>
To this fair island and the territories,<lb/>
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,<lb/>
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword<lb/>
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,<lb/>
And put these same into young Arthur's hand,<lb/>
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>What follows if we disallow of this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
<p>The proud control of fierce and bloody war,<lb/>
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Here have we war for war and blood for blood,<lb/>
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
<p>Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,<lb/>
The farthest limit of my embassy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:<lb/>
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;<lb/>
For ere thou canst report I will be there,<lb/>
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:<lb/>
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath<lb/>
And sullen presage of your own decay.<lb/>
An honourable conduct let him have:<lb/>
Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>What now, my son! have I not ever said<lb/>
How that ambitious Constance would not cease<lb/>
Till she had kindled France and all the world,<lb/>
Upon the right and party of her son?<lb/>
This might have been prevented and made whole<lb/>
With very easy arguments of love,<lb/>
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must<lb/>
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Our strong possession and our right for us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Your strong possession much more than your right,<lb/>
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:<lb/>
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,<lb/>
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Sheriff</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ESSEX</speaker>
<p>My liege, here is the strangest controversy<lb/>
Come from country to be judged by you,<lb/>
That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Let them approach.<lb/>
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay<lb/>
This expedition's charge.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD</stage></p>


<p>
What men are you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Your faithful subject I, a gentleman<lb/>
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,<lb/>
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,<lb/>
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand<lb/>
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>What art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
<p>The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?<lb/>
You came not of one mother then, it seems.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Most certain of one mother, mighty king;<lb/>
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:<lb/>
But for the certain knowledge of that truth<lb/>
I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:<lb/>
Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother<lb/>
And wound her honour with this diffidence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;<lb/>
That is my brother's plea and none of mine;<lb/>
The which if he can prove, a' pops me out<lb/>
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:<lb/>
Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,<lb/>
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>I know not why, except to get the land.<lb/>
But once he slander'd me with bastardy:<lb/>
But whether I be as true begot or no,<lb/>
That still I lay upon my mother's head,<lb/>
But that I am as well begot, my liege,&mdash;<lb/>
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!&mdash;<lb/>
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.<lb/>
If old sir Robert did beget us both<lb/>
And were our father and this son like him,<lb/>
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee<lb/>
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;<lb/>
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.<lb/>
Do you not read some tokens of my son<lb/>
In the large composition of this man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Mine eye hath well examined his parts<lb/>
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,<lb/>
What doth move you to claim your brother's land?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Because he hath a half-face, like my father.<lb/>
With half that face would he have all my land:<lb/>
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
<p>My gracious liege, when that my father lived,<lb/>
Your brother did employ my father much,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:<lb/>
Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
<p>And once dispatch'd him in an embassy<lb/>
To Germany, there with the emperor<lb/>
To treat of high affairs touching that time.<lb/>
The advantage of his absence took the king<lb/>
And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;<lb/>
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,<lb/>
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores<lb/>
Between my father and my mother lay,<lb/>
As I have heard my father speak himself,<lb/>
When this same lusty gentleman was got.<lb/>
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd<lb/>
His lands to me, and took it on his death<lb/>
That this my mother's son was none of his;<lb/>
And if he were, he came into the world<lb/>
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.<lb/>
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,<lb/>
My father's land, as was my father's will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;<lb/>
Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,<lb/>
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;<lb/>
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands<lb/>
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,<lb/>
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,<lb/>
Had of your father claim'd this son for his?<lb/>
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept<lb/>
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;<lb/>
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,<lb/>
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,<lb/>
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;<lb/>
My mother's son did get your father's heir;<lb/>
Your father's heir must have your father's land.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBERT</speaker>
<p>Shall then my father's will be of no force<lb/>
To dispossess that child which is not his?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,<lb/>
Than was his will to get me, as I think.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge<lb/>
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,<lb/>
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,<lb/>
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Madam, an if my brother had my shape,<lb/>
And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;<lb/>
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,<lb/>
My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin<lb/>
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose<lb/>
Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'<lb/>
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,<lb/>
Would I might never stir from off this place,<lb/>
I would give it every foot to have this face;<lb/>
I would not be sir Nob in any case.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,<lb/>
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?<lb/>
I am a soldier and now bound to France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.<lb/>
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,<lb/>
Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.<lb/>
Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Nay, I would have you go before me thither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Our country manners give our betters way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>What is thy name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,<lb/>
Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:<lb/>
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,<lb/>
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:<lb/>
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.<lb/>
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,<lb/>
When I was got, sir Robert was away!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>The very spirit of Plantagenet!<lb/>
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?<lb/>
Something about, a little from the right,<lb/>
In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:<lb/>
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,<lb/>
And have is have, however men do catch:<lb/>
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,<lb/>
And I am I, howe'er I was begot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;<lb/>
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.<lb/>
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed<lb/>
For France, for France, for it is more than need.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!<lb/>
For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BASTARD</stage></p>


<p>
A foot of honour better than I was;<lb/>
But many a many foot of land the worse.<lb/>
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.<lb/>
'Good den, sir Richard!'&mdash;'God-a-mercy, fellow!'&mdash;<lb/>
And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;<lb/>
For new-made honour doth forget men's names;<lb/>
'Tis too respective and too sociable<lb/>
For your conversion. Now your traveller,<lb/>
He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,<lb/>
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,<lb/>
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise<lb/>
My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'<lb/>
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,<lb/>
'I shall beseech you'&mdash;that is question now;<lb/>
And then comes answer like an Absey book:<lb/>
'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;<lb/>
At your employment; at your service, sir;'<lb/>
'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'<lb/>
And so, ere answer knows what question would,<lb/>
Saving in dialogue of compliment,<lb/>
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,<lb/>
The Pyrenean and the river Po,<lb/>
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.<lb/>
But this is worshipful society<lb/>
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,<lb/>
For he is but a bastard to the time<lb/>
That doth not smack of observation;<lb/>
And so am I, whether I smack or no;<lb/>
And not alone in habit and device,<lb/>
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,<lb/>
But from the inward motion to deliver<lb/>
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:<lb/>
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,<lb/>
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;<lb/>
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.<lb/>
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?<lb/>
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband<lb/>
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY</stage></p>


<p>
O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!<lb/>
What brings you here to court so hastily?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</speaker>
<p>Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,<lb/>
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?<lb/>
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?<lb/>
Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</speaker>
<p>Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,<lb/>
Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?<lb/>
He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GURNEY</speaker>
<p>Good leave, good Philip.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Philip! sparrow: James,<lb/>
There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit GURNEY</stage></p>


<p>
Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:<lb/>
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me<lb/>
Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:<lb/>
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,<lb/>
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:<lb/>
We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,<lb/>
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?<lb/>
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</speaker>
<p>Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,<lb/>
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?<lb/>
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.<lb/>
What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.<lb/>
But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;<lb/>
I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;<lb/>
Legitimation, name and all is gone:<lb/>
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;<lb/>
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</speaker>
<p>Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>As faithfully as I deny the devil.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY FAULCONBRIDGE</speaker>
<p>King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:<lb/>
By long and vehement suit I was seduced<lb/>
To make room for him in my husband's bed:<lb/>
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!<lb/>
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,<lb/>
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Now, by this light, were I to get again,<lb/>
Madam, I would not wish a better father.<lb/>
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,<lb/>
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:<lb/>
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,<lb/>
Subjected tribute to commanding love,<lb/>
Against whose fury and unmatched force<lb/>
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,<lb/>
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.<lb/>
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts<lb/>
May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,<lb/>
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!<lb/>
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well<lb/>
When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.<lb/>
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;<lb/>
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,<lb/>
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:<lb/>
Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.<lb/>

<p>A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,<lb/>
As seal to this indenture of my love,<lb/>
That to my home I will no more return,<lb/>
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,<lb/>
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,<lb/>
Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides<lb/>
And coops from other lands her islanders,<lb/>
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,<lb/>
That water-walled bulwark, still secure<lb/>
And confident from foreign purposes,<lb/>
Even till that utmost corner of the west<lb/>
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,<lb/>
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,<lb/>
Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength<lb/>
To make a more requital to your love!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords<lb/>
In such a just and charitable war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent<lb/>
Against the brows of this resisting town.<lb/>
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,<lb/>
To cull the plots of best advantages:<lb/>
We'll lay before this town our royal bones,<lb/>
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,<lb/>
But we will make it subject to this boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Stay for an answer to your embassy,<lb/>
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:<lb/>
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,<lb/>
That right in peace which here we urge in war,<lb/>
And then we shall repent each drop of blood<lb/>
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CHATILLON</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,<lb/>
Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!<lb/>
What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;<lb/>
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CHATILLON</speaker>
<p>Then turn your forces from this paltry siege<lb/>
And stir them up against a mightier task.<lb/>
England, impatient of your just demands,<lb/>
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,<lb/>
Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time<lb/>
To land his legions all as soon as I;<lb/>
His marches are expedient to this town,<lb/>
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.<lb/>
With him along is come the mother-queen,<lb/>
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;<lb/>
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;<lb/>
With them a bastard of the king's deceased,<lb/>
And all the unsettled humours of the land,<lb/>
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,<lb/>
With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,<lb/>
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,<lb/>
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,<lb/>
To make hazard of new fortunes here:<lb/>
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits<lb/>
Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er<lb/>
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,<lb/>
To do offence and scath in Christendom.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drum beats</stage></p>


<p>
The interruption of their churlish drums<lb/>
Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,<lb/>
To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>How much unlook'd for is this expedition!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>By how much unexpected, by so much<lb/>
We must awake endavour for defence;<lb/>
For courage mounteth with occasion:<lb/>
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD,	Lords, and forces</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Peace be to France, if France in peace permit<lb/>
Our just and lineal entrance to our own;<lb/>
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,<lb/>
Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct<lb/>
Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Peace be to England, if that war return<lb/>
From France to England, there to live in peace.<lb/>
England we love; and for that England's sake<lb/>
With burden of our armour here we sweat.<lb/>
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;<lb/>
But thou from loving England art so far,<lb/>
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king<lb/>
Cut off the sequence of posterity,<lb/>
Out-faced infant state and done a rape<lb/>
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.<lb/>
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;<lb/>
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:<lb/>
This little abstract doth contain that large<lb/>
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time<lb/>
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.<lb/>
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,<lb/>
And this his son; England was Geffrey's right<lb/>
And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God<lb/>
How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,<lb/>
When living blood doth in these temples beat,<lb/>
Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>From whom hast thou this great commission, France,<lb/>
To draw my answer from thy articles?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts<lb/>
In any breast of strong authority,<lb/>
To look into the blots and stains of right:<lb/>
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:<lb/>
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong<lb/>
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Alack, thou dost usurp authority.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Let me make answer; thy usurping son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,<lb/>
That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>My bed was ever to thy son as true<lb/>
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy<lb/>
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey<lb/>
Than thou and John in manners; being as like<lb/>
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.<lb/>
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think<lb/>
His father never was so true begot:<lb/>
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Hear the crier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>What the devil art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>One that will play the devil, sir, with you,<lb/>
An a' may catch your hide and you alone:<lb/>
You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,<lb/>
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;<lb/>
I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;<lb/>
Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLANCH</speaker>
<p>O, well did he become that lion's robe<lb/>
That did disrobe the lion of that robe!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>It lies as sightly on the back of him<lb/>
As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:<lb/>
But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,<lb/>
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>What craker is this same that deafs our ears<lb/>
With this abundance of superfluous breath?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Women and fools, break off your conference.<lb/>
King John, this is the very sum of all;<lb/>
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,<lb/>
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:<lb/>
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.<lb/>
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;<lb/>
And out of my dear love I'll give thee more<lb/>
Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:<lb/>
Submit thee, boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Come to thy grandam, child.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Do, child, go to it grandam, child:<lb/>
Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will<lb/>
Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:<lb/>
There's a good grandam.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Good my mother, peace!<lb/>
I would that I were low laid in my grave:<lb/>
I am not worth this coil that's made for me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!<lb/>
His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,<lb/>
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,<lb/>
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;<lb/>
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed<lb/>
To do him justice and revenge on you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!<lb/>
Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp<lb/>
The dominations, royalties and rights<lb/>
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,<lb/>
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:<lb/>
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;<lb/>
The canon of the law is laid on him,<lb/>
Being but the second generation<lb/>
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Bedlam, have done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>I have but this to say,<lb/>
That he is not only plagued for her sin,<lb/>
But God hath made her sin and her the plague<lb/>
On this removed issue, plague for her<lb/>
And with her plague; her sin his injury,<lb/>
Her injury the beadle to her sin,<lb/>
All punish'd in the person of this child,<lb/>
And all for her; a plague upon her!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Thou unadvised scold, I can produce<lb/>
A will that bars the title of thy son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:<lb/>
A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:<lb/>
It ill beseems this presence to cry aim<lb/>
To these ill-tuned repetitions.<lb/>
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls<lb/>
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak<lb/>
Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>'Tis France, for England.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>England, for itself.<lb/>
You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,<lb/>
Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>For our advantage; therefore hear us first.<lb/>
These flags of France, that are advanced here<lb/>
Before the eye and prospect of your town,<lb/>
Have hither march'd to your endamagement:<lb/>
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,<lb/>
And ready mounted are they to spit forth<lb/>
Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:<lb/>
All preparation for a bloody siege<lb/>
All merciless proceeding by these French<lb/>
Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;<lb/>
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,<lb/>
That as a waist doth girdle you about,<lb/>
By the compulsion of their ordinance<lb/>
By this time from their fixed beds of lime<lb/>
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made<lb/>
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.<lb/>
But on the sight of us your lawful king,<lb/>
Who painfully with much expedient march<lb/>
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,<lb/>
To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,<lb/>
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;<lb/>
And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,<lb/>
To make a shaking fever in your walls,<lb/>
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,<lb/>
To make a faithless error in your ears:<lb/>
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,<lb/>
And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,<lb/>
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,<lb/>
Crave harbourage within your city walls.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>When I have said, make answer to us both.<lb/>
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection<lb/>
Is most divinely vow'd upon the right<lb/>
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,<lb/>
Son to the elder brother of this man,<lb/>
And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:<lb/>
For this down-trodden equity, we tread<lb/>
In warlike march these greens before your town,<lb/>
Being no further enemy to you<lb/>
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal<lb/>
In the relief of this oppressed child<lb/>
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then<lb/>
To pay that duty which you truly owe<lb/>
To that owes it, namely this young prince:<lb/>
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,<lb/>
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;<lb/>
Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent<lb/>
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;<lb/>
And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,<lb/>
With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,<lb/>
We will bear home that lusty blood again<lb/>
Which here we came to spout against your town,<lb/>
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.<lb/>
But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,<lb/>
'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls<lb/>
Can hide you from our messengers of war,<lb/>
Though all these English and their discipline<lb/>
Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.<lb/>
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,<lb/>
In that behalf which we have challenged it?<lb/>
Or shall we give the signal to our rage<lb/>
And stalk in blood to our possession?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:<lb/>
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>That can we not; but he that proves the king,<lb/>
To him will we prove loyal: till that time<lb/>
Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Doth not the crown of England prove the king?<lb/>
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,<lb/>
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Bastards, and else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>To verify our title with their lives.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>As many and as well-born bloods as those,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Some bastards too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Stand in his face to contradict his claim.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Till you compound whose right is worthiest,<lb/>
We for the worthiest hold the right from both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Then God forgive the sin of all those souls<lb/>
That to their everlasting residence,<lb/>
Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,<lb/>
In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since<lb/>
Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,<lb/>
Teach us some fence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To AUSTRIA</stage></p>


<p>
Sirrah, were I at home,<lb/>
At your den, sirrah, with your lioness<lb/>
I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,<lb/>
And make a monster of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Peace! no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth<lb/>
In best appointment all our regiments.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Speed then, to take advantage of the field.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>It shall be so; and at the other hill<lb/>
Command the rest to stand. God and our right!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France,	with trumpets, to the gates</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>French Herald</speaker>
<p>You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,<lb/>
And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,<lb/>
Who by the hand of France this day hath made<lb/>
Much work for tears in many an English mother,<lb/>
Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;<lb/>
Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,<lb/>
Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;<lb/>
And victory, with little loss, doth play<lb/>
Upon the dancing banners of the French,<lb/>
Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,<lb/>
To enter conquerors and to proclaim<lb/>
Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter English Herald, with trumpet</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>English Herald</speaker>
<p>Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:<lb/>
King John, your king and England's doth approach,<lb/>
Commander of this hot malicious day:<lb/>
Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,<lb/>
Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;<lb/>
There stuck no plume in any English crest<lb/>
That is removed by a staff of France;<lb/>
Our colours do return in those same hands<lb/>
That did display them when we first march'd forth;<lb/>
And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come<lb/>
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,<lb/>
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:<lb/>
Open your gates and gives the victors way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,<lb/>
From first to last, the onset and retire<lb/>
Of both your armies; whose equality<lb/>
By our best eyes cannot be censured:<lb/>
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;<lb/>
Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:<lb/>
Both are alike; and both alike we like.<lb/>
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,<lb/>
We hold our town for neither, yet for both.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their	powers, severally</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?<lb/>
Say, shall the current of our right run on?<lb/>
Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,<lb/>
Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell<lb/>
With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,<lb/>
Unless thou let his silver water keep<lb/>
A peaceful progress to the ocean.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,<lb/>
In this hot trial, more than we of France;<lb/>
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,<lb/>
That sways the earth this climate overlooks,<lb/>
Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,<lb/>
We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,<lb/>
Or add a royal number to the dead,<lb/>
Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss<lb/>
With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,<lb/>
When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!<lb/>
O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;<lb/>
The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;<lb/>
And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,<lb/>
In undetermined differences of kings.<lb/>
Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?<lb/>
Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,<lb/>
You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!<lb/>
Then let confusion of one part confirm<lb/>
The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>The king of England; when we know the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Know him in us, that here hold up his right.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>In us, that are our own great deputy<lb/>
And bear possession of our person here,<lb/>
Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>A greater power then we denies all this;<lb/>
And till it be undoubted, we do lock<lb/>
Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;<lb/>
King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,<lb/>
Be by some certain king purged and deposed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,<lb/>
And stand securely on their battlements,<lb/>
As in a theatre, whence they gape and point<lb/>
At your industrious scenes and acts of death.<lb/>
Your royal presences be ruled by me:<lb/>
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,<lb/>
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend<lb/>
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:<lb/>
By east and west let France and England mount<lb/>
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,<lb/>
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down<lb/>
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:<lb/>
I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,<lb/>
Even till unfenced desolation<lb/>
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.<lb/>
That done, dissever your united strengths,<lb/>
And part your mingled colours once again;<lb/>
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;<lb/>
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth<lb/>
Out of one side her happy minion,<lb/>
To whom in favour she shall give the day,<lb/>
And kiss him with a glorious victory.<lb/>
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?<lb/>
Smacks it not something of the policy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,<lb/>
I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers<lb/>
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;<lb/>
Then after fight who shall be king of it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>An if thou hast the mettle of a king,<lb/>
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,<lb/>
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,<lb/>
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;<lb/>
And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,<lb/>
Why then defy each other and pell-mell<lb/>
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>We from the west will send destruction<lb/>
Into this city's bosom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>I from the north.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Our thunder from the south<lb/>
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>O prudent discipline! From north to south:<lb/>
Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:<lb/>
I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,<lb/>
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;<lb/>
Win you this city without stroke or wound;<lb/>
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,<lb/>
That here come sacrifices for the field:<lb/>
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,<lb/>
Is niece to England: look upon the years<lb/>
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:<lb/>
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,<lb/>
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?<lb/>
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,<lb/>
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?<lb/>
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,<lb/>
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?<lb/>
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,<lb/>
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:<lb/>
If not complete of, say he is not she;<lb/>
And she again wants nothing, to name want,<lb/>
If want it be not that she is not he:<lb/>
He is the half part of a blessed man,<lb/>
Left to be finished by such as she;<lb/>
And she a fair divided excellence,<lb/>
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.<lb/>
O, two such silver currents, when they join,<lb/>
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;<lb/>
And two such shores to two such streams made one,<lb/>
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,<lb/>
To these two princes, if you marry them.<lb/>
This union shall do more than battery can<lb/>
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,<lb/>
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,<lb/>
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,<lb/>
And give you entrance: but without this match,<lb/>
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,<lb/>
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks<lb/>
More free from motion, no, not Death himself<lb/>
In moral fury half so peremptory,<lb/>
As we to keep this city.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Here's a stay<lb/>
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death<lb/>
Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,<lb/>
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,<lb/>
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions<lb/>
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!<lb/>
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?<lb/>
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;<lb/>
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:<lb/>
Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his<lb/>
But buffets better than a fist of France:<lb/>
Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words<lb/>
Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;<lb/>
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:<lb/>
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie<lb/>
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,<lb/>
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe<lb/>
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.<lb/>
I see a yielding in the looks of France;<lb/>
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls<lb/>
Are capable of this ambition,<lb/>
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath<lb/>
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,<lb/>
Cool and congeal again to what it was.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Why answer not the double majesties<lb/>
This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Speak England first, that hath been forward first<lb/>
To speak unto this city: what say you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,<lb/>
Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'<lb/>
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:<lb/>
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,<lb/>
And all that we upon this side the sea,<lb/>
Except this city now by us besieged,<lb/>
Find liable to our crown and dignity,<lb/>
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich<lb/>
In titles, honours and promotions,<lb/>
As she in beauty, education, blood,<lb/>
Holds hand with any princess of the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>I do, my lord; and in her eye I find<lb/>
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,<lb/>
The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:<lb/>
Which being but the shadow of your son,<lb/>
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:<lb/>
I do protest I never loved myself<lb/>
Till now infixed I beheld myself<lb/>
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Whispers with BLANCH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!<lb/>
Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!<lb/>
And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy<lb/>
Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,<lb/>
That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be<lb/>
In such a love so vile a lout as he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLANCH</speaker>
<p>My uncle's will in this respect is mine:<lb/>
If he see aught in you that makes him like,<lb/>
That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,<lb/>
I can with ease translate it to my will;<lb/>
Or if you will, to speak more properly,<lb/>
I will enforce it easily to my love.<lb/>
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,<lb/>
That all I see in you is worthy love,<lb/>
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,<lb/>
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,<lb/>
That I can find should merit any hate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>What say these young ones? What say you my niece?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLANCH</speaker>
<p>That she is bound in honour still to do<lb/>
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;<lb/>
For I do love her most unfeignedly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,<lb/>
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,<lb/>
With her to thee; and this addition more,<lb/>
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.<lb/>
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,<lb/>
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>And your lips too; for I am well assured<lb/>
That I did so when I was first assured.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,<lb/>
Let in that amity which you have made;<lb/>
For at Saint Mary's chapel presently<lb/>
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.<lb/>
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?<lb/>
I know she is not, for this match made up<lb/>
Her presence would have interrupted much:<lb/>
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>And, by my faith, this league that we have made<lb/>
Will give her sadness very little cure.<lb/>
Brother of England, how may we content<lb/>
This widow lady? In her right we came;<lb/>
Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,<lb/>
To our own vantage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>We will heal up all;<lb/>
For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne<lb/>
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town<lb/>
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;<lb/>
Some speedy messenger bid her repair<lb/>
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,<lb/>
If not fill up the measure of her will,<lb/>
Yet in some measure satisfy her so<lb/>
That we shall stop her exclamation.<lb/>
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,<lb/>
To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but the BASTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!<lb/>
John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,<lb/>
Hath willingly departed with a part,<lb/>
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,<lb/>
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field<lb/>
As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear<lb/>
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,<lb/>
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,<lb/>
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,<lb/>
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,<lb/>
Who, having no external thing to lose<lb/>
But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,<lb/>
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,<lb/>
Commodity, the bias of the world,<lb/>
The world, who of itself is peised well,<lb/>
Made to run even upon even ground,<lb/>
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,<lb/>
This sway of motion, this Commodity,<lb/>
Makes it take head from all indifferency,<lb/>
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:<lb/>
And this same bias, this Commodity,<lb/>
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,<lb/>
Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,<lb/>
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,<lb/>
From a resolved and honourable war,<lb/>
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.<lb/>
And why rail I on this Commodity?<lb/>
But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:<lb/>
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,<lb/>
When his fair angels would salute my palm;<lb/>
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,<lb/>
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.<lb/>
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail<lb/>
And say there is no sin but to be rich;<lb/>
And being rich, my virtue then shall be<lb/>
To say there is no vice but beggary.<lb/>
Since kings break faith upon commodity,<lb/>
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!<lb/>
False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!<lb/>
Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?<lb/>
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:<lb/>
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:<lb/>
It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:<lb/>
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word<lb/>
Is but the vain breath of a common man:<lb/>
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;<lb/>
I have a king's oath to the contrary.<lb/>
Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,<lb/>
For I am sick and capable of fears,<lb/>
Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,<lb/>
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,<lb/>
A woman, naturally born to fears;<lb/>
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,<lb/>
With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,<lb/>
But they will quake and tremble all this day.<lb/>
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?<lb/>
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?<lb/>
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?<lb/>
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,<lb/>
Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?<lb/>
Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?<lb/>
Then speak again; not all thy former tale,<lb/>
But this one word, whether thy tale be true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>As true as I believe you think them false<lb/>
That give you cause to prove my saying true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,<lb/>
Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,<lb/>
And let belief and life encounter so<lb/>
As doth the fury of two desperate men<lb/>
Which in the very meeting fall and die.<lb/>
Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?<lb/>
France friend with England, what becomes of me?<lb/>
Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:<lb/>
This news hath made thee a most ugly man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>What other harm have I, good lady, done,<lb/>
But spoke the harm that is by others done?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Which harm within itself so heinous is<lb/>
As it makes harmful all that speak of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>I do beseech you, madam, be content.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,<lb/>
Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,<lb/>
Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,<lb/>
Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,<lb/>
Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,<lb/>
I would not care, I then would be content,<lb/>
For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou<lb/>
Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.<lb/>
But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,<lb/>
Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:<lb/>
Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,<lb/>
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,<lb/>
She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;<lb/>
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,<lb/>
And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France<lb/>
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,<lb/>
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.<lb/>
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,<lb/>
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!<lb/>
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?<lb/>
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone<lb/>
And leave those woes alone which I alone<lb/>
Am bound to under-bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, madam,<lb/>
I may not go without you to the kings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:<lb/>
I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;<lb/>
For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.<lb/>
To me and to the state of my great grief<lb/>
Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great<lb/>
That no supporter but the huge firm earth<lb/>
Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;<lb/>
Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.<lb/>

<p>'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day<lb/>
Ever in France shall be kept festival:<lb/>
To solemnize this day the glorious sun<lb/>
Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,<lb/>
Turning with splendor of his precious eye<lb/>
The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:<lb/>
The yearly course that brings this day about<lb/>
Shall never see it but a holiday.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>A wicked day, and not a holy day!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Rising</stage></p>


<p>
What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,<lb/>
That it in golden letters should be set<lb/>
Among the high tides in the calendar?<lb/>
Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,<lb/>
This day of shame, oppression, perjury.<lb/>
Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child<lb/>
Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,<lb/>
Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:<lb/>
But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;<lb/>
No bargains break that are not this day made:<lb/>
This day, all things begun come to ill end,<lb/>
Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause<lb/>
To curse the fair proceedings of this day:<lb/>
Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>You have beguiled me with a counterfeit<lb/>
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,<lb/>
Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;<lb/>
You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,<lb/>
But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:<lb/>
The grappling vigour and rough frown of war<lb/>
Is cold in amity and painted peace,<lb/>
And our oppression hath made up this league.<lb/>
Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!<lb/>
A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!<lb/>
Let not the hours of this ungodly day<lb/>
Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,<lb/>
Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!<lb/>
Hear me, O, hear me!<lb/>

<p>Lady Constance, peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war<lb/>
O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame<lb/>
That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!<lb/>
Thou little valiant, great in villany!<lb/>
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!<lb/>
Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight<lb/>
But when her humorous ladyship is by<lb/>
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,<lb/>
And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,<lb/>
A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear<lb/>
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,<lb/>
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,<lb/>
Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend<lb/>
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,<lb/>
And dost thou now fall over to my fores?<lb/>
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,<lb/>
And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>O, that a man should speak those words to me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Here comes the holy legate of the pope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!<lb/>
To thee, King John, my holy errand is.<lb/>
I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,<lb/>
And from Pope Innocent the legate here,<lb/>
Do in his name religiously demand<lb/>
Why thou against the church, our holy mother,<lb/>
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce<lb/>
Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop<lb/>
Of Canterbury, from that holy see?<lb/>
This, in our foresaid holy father's name,<lb/>
Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>What earthy name to interrogatories<lb/>
Can task the free breath of a sacred king?<lb/>
Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name<lb/>
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,<lb/>
To charge me to an answer, as the pope.<lb/>
Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England<lb/>
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest<lb/>
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;<lb/>
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,<lb/>
So under Him that great supremacy,<lb/>
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,<lb/>
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:<lb/>
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart<lb/>
To him and his usurp'd authority.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Though you and all the kings of Christendom<lb/>
Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,<lb/>
Dreading the curse that money may buy out;<lb/>
And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,<lb/>
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,<lb/>
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,<lb/>
Though you and all the rest so grossly led<lb/>
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,<lb/>
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose<lb/>
Against the pope and count his friends my foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Then, by the lawful power that I have,<lb/>
Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.<lb/>
And blessed shall he be that doth revolt<lb/>
From his allegiance to an heretic;<lb/>
And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,<lb/>
Canonized and worshipped as a saint,<lb/>
That takes away by any secret course<lb/>
Thy hateful life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O, lawful let it be<lb/>
That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!<lb/>
Good father cardinal, cry thou amen<lb/>
To my keen curses; for without my wrong<lb/>
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>And for mine too: when law can do no right,<lb/>
Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:<lb/>
Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,<lb/>
For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;<lb/>
Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,<lb/>
How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Philip of France, on peril of a curse,<lb/>
Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;<lb/>
And raise the power of France upon his head,<lb/>
Unless he do submit himself to Rome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,<lb/>
And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>King Philip, listen to the cardinal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Your breeches best may carry them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>What should he say, but as the cardinal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Bethink you, father; for the difference<lb/>
Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,<lb/>
Or the light loss of England for a friend:<lb/>
Forego the easier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLANCH</speaker>
<p>That's the curse of Rome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here<lb/>
In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLANCH</speaker>
<p>The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,<lb/>
But from her need.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O, if thou grant my need,<lb/>
Which only lives but by the death of faith,<lb/>
That need must needs infer this principle,<lb/>
That faith would live again by death of need.<lb/>
O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;<lb/>
Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>The king is moved, and answers not to this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>O, be removed from him, and answer well!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUSTRIA</speaker>
<p>Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,<lb/>
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Good reverend father, make my person yours,<lb/>
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.<lb/>
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,<lb/>
And the conjunction of our inward souls<lb/>
Married in league, coupled and linked together<lb/>
With all religious strength of sacred vows;<lb/>
The latest breath that gave the sound of words<lb/>
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love<lb/>
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,<lb/>
And even before this truce, but new before,<lb/>
No longer than we well could wash our hands<lb/>
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,<lb/>
Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd<lb/>
With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint<lb/>
The fearful difference of incensed kings:<lb/>
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,<lb/>
So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,<lb/>
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?<lb/>
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,<lb/>
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,<lb/>
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,<lb/>
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed<lb/>
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,<lb/>
And make a riot on the gentle brow<lb/>
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,<lb/>
My reverend father, let it not be so!<lb/>
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose<lb/>
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest<lb/>
To do your pleasure and continue friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>All form is formless, order orderless,<lb/>
Save what is opposite to England's love.<lb/>
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,<lb/>
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,<lb/>
A mother's curse, on her revolting son.<lb/>
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,<lb/>
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,<lb/>
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,<lb/>
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;<lb/>
And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,<lb/>
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow<lb/>
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,<lb/>
That is, to be the champion of our church!<lb/>
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself<lb/>
And may not be performed by thyself,<lb/>
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss<lb/>
Is not amiss when it is truly done,<lb/>
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,<lb/>
The truth is then most done not doing it:<lb/>
The better act of purposes mistook<lb/>
Is to mistake again; though indirect,<lb/>
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,<lb/>
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire<lb/>
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.<lb/>
It is religion that doth make vows kept;<lb/>
But thou hast sworn against religion,<lb/>
By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,<lb/>
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth<lb/>
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure<lb/>
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;<lb/>
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!<lb/>
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;<lb/>
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.<lb/>
Therefore thy later vows against thy first<lb/>
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;<lb/>
And better conquest never canst thou make<lb/>
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts<lb/>
Against these giddy loose suggestions:<lb/>
Upon which better part our prayers come in,<lb/>
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know<lb/>
The peril of our curses light on thee<lb/>
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,<lb/>
But in despair die under their black weight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELINOR</speaker>
<p>Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,<lb/>
We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh<lb/>
There is a soul counts thee her creditor<lb/>
And with advantage means to pay thy love:<lb/>
And my good friend, thy voluntary oath<lb/>
Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.<lb/>
Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,<lb/>
But I will fit it with some better time.<lb/>
By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed<lb/>
To say what good respect I have of thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>I am much bounden to your majesty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,<lb/>
But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,<lb/>
Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.<lb/>
I had a thing to say, but let it go:<lb/>
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,<lb/>
Attended with the pleasures of the world,<lb/>
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds<lb/>
To give me audience: if the midnight bell<lb/>
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,<lb/>
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;<lb/>
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,<lb/>
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,<lb/>
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,<lb/>
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,<lb/>
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,<lb/>
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes<lb/>
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,<lb/>
A passion hateful to my purposes,<lb/>
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,<lb/>
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply<lb/>
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,<lb/>
Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;<lb/>
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,<lb/>
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:<lb/>
But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;<lb/>
And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>So well, that what you bid me undertake,<lb/>
Though that my death were adjunct to my act,<lb/>
By heaven, I would do it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Do not I know thou wouldst?<lb/>
Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye<lb/>
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,<lb/>
He is a very serpent in my way;<lb/>
And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,<lb/>
He lies before me: dost thou understand me?<lb/>
Thou art his keeper.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,<lb/>
A whole armado of convicted sail<lb/>
Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.<lb/>

<p>Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>What can go well, when we have run so ill?<lb/>
Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?<lb/>
Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?<lb/>
And bloody England into England gone,<lb/>
O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>What he hath won, that hath he fortified:<lb/>
So hot a speed with such advice disposed,<lb/>
Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,<lb/>
Doth want example: who hath read or heard<lb/>
Of any kindred action like to this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Well could I bear that England had this praise,<lb/>
So we could find some pattern of our shame.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CONSTANCE</stage></p>


<p>
Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;<lb/>
Holding the eternal spirit against her will,<lb/>
In the vile prison of afflicted breath.<lb/>
I prithee, lady, go away with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>No, I defy all counsel, all redress,<lb/>
But that which ends all counsel, true redress,<lb/>
Death, death; O amiable lovely death!<lb/>
Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!<lb/>
Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,<lb/>
Thou hate and terror to prosperity,<lb/>
And I will kiss thy detestable bones<lb/>
And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows<lb/>
And ring these fingers with thy household worms<lb/>
And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust<lb/>
And be a carrion monster like thyself:<lb/>
Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest<lb/>
And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,<lb/>
O, come to me!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>O fair affliction, peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:<lb/>
O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!<lb/>
Then with a passion would I shake the world;<lb/>
And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy<lb/>
Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,<lb/>
Which scorns a modern invocation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Thou art not holy to belie me so;<lb/>
I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;<lb/>
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;<lb/>
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:<lb/>
I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!<lb/>
For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:<lb/>
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!<lb/>
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,<lb/>
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;<lb/>
For being not mad but sensible of grief,<lb/>
My reasonable part produces reason<lb/>
How I may be deliver'd of these woes,<lb/>
And teaches me to kill or hang myself:<lb/>
If I were mad, I should forget my son,<lb/>
Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:<lb/>
I am not mad; too well, too well I feel<lb/>
The different plague of each calamity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note<lb/>
In the fair multitude of those her hairs!<lb/>
Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,<lb/>
Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends<lb/>
Do glue themselves in sociable grief,<lb/>
Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,<lb/>
Sticking together in calamity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>To England, if you will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>Bind up your hairs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?<lb/>
I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud<lb/>
'O that these hands could so redeem my son,<lb/>
As they have given these hairs their liberty!'<lb/>
But now I envy at their liberty,<lb/>
And will again commit them to their bonds,<lb/>
Because my poor child is a prisoner.<lb/>
And, father cardinal, I have heard you say<lb/>
That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:<lb/>
If that be true, I shall see my boy again;<lb/>
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,<lb/>
To him that did but yesterday suspire,<lb/>
There was not such a gracious creature born.<lb/>
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud<lb/>
And chase the native beauty from his cheek<lb/>
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,<lb/>
As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,<lb/>
And so he'll die; and, rising so again,<lb/>
When I shall meet him in the court of heaven<lb/>
I shall not know him: therefore never, never<lb/>
Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>You hold too heinous a respect of grief.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>He talks to me that never had a son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>You are as fond of grief as of your child.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONSTANCE</speaker>
<p>Grief fills the room up of my absent child,<lb/>
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,<lb/>
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,<lb/>
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,<lb/>
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;<lb/>
Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?<lb/>
Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,<lb/>
I could give better comfort than you do.<lb/>
I will not keep this form upon my head,<lb/>
When there is such disorder in my wit.<lb/>
O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!<lb/>
My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!<lb/>
My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING PHILIP</speaker>
<p>I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>There's nothing in this world can make me joy:<lb/>
Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale<lb/>
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;<lb/>
And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste<lb/>
That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Before the curing of a strong disease,<lb/>
Even in the instant of repair and health,<lb/>
The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,<lb/>
On their departure most of all show evil:<lb/>
What have you lost by losing of this day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>All days of glory, joy and happiness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>If you had won it, certainly you had.<lb/>
No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,<lb/>
She looks upon them with a threatening eye.<lb/>
'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost<lb/>
In this which he accounts so clearly won:<lb/>
Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>As heartily as he is glad he hath him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.<lb/>
Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;<lb/>
For even the breath of what I mean to speak<lb/>
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,<lb/>
Out of the path which shall directly lead<lb/>
Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.<lb/>
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be<lb/>
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,<lb/>
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,<lb/>
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.<lb/>
A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand<lb/>
Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;<lb/>
And he that stands upon a slippery place<lb/>
Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:<lb/>
That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;<lb/>
So be it, for it cannot be but so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,<lb/>
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>How green you are and fresh in this old world!<lb/>
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;<lb/>
For he that steeps his safety in true blood<lb/>
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.<lb/>
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts<lb/>
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,<lb/>
That none so small advantage shall step forth<lb/>
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;<lb/>
No natural exhalation in the sky,<lb/>
No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,<lb/>
No common wind, no customed event,<lb/>
But they will pluck away his natural cause<lb/>
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,<lb/>
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,<lb/>
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,<lb/>
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,<lb/>
If that young Arthur be not gone already,<lb/>
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts<lb/>
Of all his people shall revolt from him<lb/>
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change<lb/>
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath<lb/>
Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.<lb/>
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:<lb/>
And, O, what better matter breeds for you<lb/>
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge<lb/>
Is now in England, ransacking the church,<lb/>
Offending charity: if but a dozen French<lb/>
Were there in arms, they would be as a call<lb/>
To train ten thousand English to their side,<lb/>
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,<lb/>
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,<lb/>
Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful<lb/>
What may be wrought out of their discontent,<lb/>
Now that their souls are topful of offence.<lb/>
For England go: I will whet on the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:<lb/>
If you say ay, the king will not say no.<lb/>

<p>As little prince, having so great a title<lb/>
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.<lb/>

<p>Indeed, I have been merrier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Mercy on me!<lb/>
Methinks no body should be sad but I:<lb/>
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,<lb/>
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,<lb/>
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,<lb/>
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,<lb/>
I should be as merry as the day is long;<lb/>
And so I would be here, but that I doubt<lb/>
My uncle practises more harm to me:<lb/>
He is afraid of me and I of him:<lb/>
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?<lb/>
No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven<lb/>
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.<lb/>

<p>
How now, foolish rheum!<lb/>
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!<lb/>
I must be brief, lest resolution drop<lb/>
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.<lb/>
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:<lb/>
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?<lb/>

<p>And will you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>And I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,<lb/>
I knit my handercher about your brows,<lb/>
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,<lb/>
And I did never ask it you again;<lb/>
And with my hand at midnight held your head,<lb/>
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,<lb/>
Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,<lb/>
Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'<lb/>
Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'<lb/>
Many a poor man's son would have lien still<lb/>
And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;<lb/>
But you at your sick service had a prince.<lb/>
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love<lb/>
And call it cunning: do, an if you will:<lb/>
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,<lb/>
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?<lb/>
These eyes that never did nor never shall<lb/>
So much as frown on you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>I have sworn to do it;<lb/>
And with hot irons must I burn them out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!<lb/>
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,<lb/>
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears<lb/>
And quench his fiery indignation<lb/>
Even in the matter of mine innocence;<lb/>
Nay, after that, consume away in rust<lb/>
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.<lb/>
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?<lb/>
An if an angel should have come to me<lb/>
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,<lb/>
I would not have believed him,&mdash;no tongue but Hubert's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Come forth.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Stamps</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, &amp;c</stage></p>


<p>
Do as I bid you do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out<lb/>
Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?<lb/>
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.<lb/>
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!<lb/>
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,<lb/>
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;<lb/>
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,<lb/>
Nor look upon the iron angerly:<lb/>
Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,<lb/>
Whatever torment you do put me to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Go, stand within; let me alone with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Executioner</speaker>
<p>I am best pleased to be from such a deed.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Executioners</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Alas, I then have chid away my friend!<lb/>
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:<lb/>
Let him come back, that his compassion may<lb/>
Give life to yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Come, boy, prepare yourself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Is there no remedy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>None, but to lose your eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,<lb/>
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,<lb/>
Any annoyance in that precious sense!<lb/>
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,<lb/>
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues<lb/>
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:<lb/>
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;<lb/>
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,<lb/>
So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.<lb/>
Though to no use but still to look on you!<lb/>
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold<lb/>
And would not harm me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>I can heat it, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,<lb/>
Being create for comfort, to be used<lb/>
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;<lb/>
There is no malice in this burning coal;<lb/>
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out<lb/>
And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>But with my breath I can revive it, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>An if you do, you will but make it blush<lb/>
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:<lb/>
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;<lb/>
And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,<lb/>
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.<lb/>
All things that you should use to do me wrong<lb/>
Deny their office: only you do lack<lb/>
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,<lb/>
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye<lb/>
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:<lb/>
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,<lb/>
With this same very iron to burn them out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>O, now you look like Hubert! all this while<lb/>
You were disguised.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Peace; no more. Adieu.<lb/>
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;<lb/>
I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:<lb/>
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,<lb/>
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,<lb/>
Will not offend thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Silence; no more: go closely in with me:<lb/>
Much danger do I undergo for thee.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>KING JOHN'S palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,<lb/>
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,<lb/>
Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,<lb/>
And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,<lb/>
The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;<lb/>
Fresh expectation troubled not the land<lb/>
With any long'd-for change or better state.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,<lb/>
To guard a title that was rich before,<lb/>
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,<lb/>
To throw a perfume on the violet,<lb/>
To smooth the ice, or add another hue<lb/>
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light<lb/>
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,<lb/>
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>But that your royal pleasure must be done,<lb/>
This act is as an ancient tale new told,<lb/>
And in the last repeating troublesome,<lb/>
Being urged at a time unseasonable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>In this the antique and well noted face<lb/>
Of plain old form is much disfigured;<lb/>
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,<lb/>
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,<lb/>
Startles and frights consideration,<lb/>
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,<lb/>
For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>When workmen strive to do better than well,<lb/>
They do confound their skill in covetousness;<lb/>
And oftentimes excusing of a fault<lb/>
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,<lb/>
As patches set upon a little breach<lb/>
Discredit more in hiding of the fault<lb/>
Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>To this effect, before you were new crown'd,<lb/>
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness<lb/>
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,<lb/>
Since all and every part of what we would<lb/>
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Some reasons of this double coronation<lb/>
I have possess'd you with and think them strong;<lb/>
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,<lb/>
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask<lb/>
What you would have reform'd that is not well,<lb/>
And well shall you perceive how willingly<lb/>
I will both hear and grant you your requests.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,<lb/>
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,<lb/>
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,<lb/>
Your safety, for the which myself and them<lb/>
Bend their best studies, heartily request<lb/>
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint<lb/>
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent<lb/>
To break into this dangerous argument,&mdash;<lb/>
If what in rest you have in right you hold,<lb/>
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend<lb/>
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up<lb/>
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days<lb/>
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth<lb/>
The rich advantage of good exercise?<lb/>
That the time's enemies may not have this<lb/>
To grace occasions, let it be our suit<lb/>
That you have bid us ask his liberty;<lb/>
Which for our goods we do no further ask<lb/>
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,<lb/>
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HUBERT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Let it be so: I do commit his youth<lb/>
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Taking him apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>This is the man should do the bloody deed;<lb/>
He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:<lb/>
The image of a wicked heinous fault<lb/>
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his<lb/>
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;<lb/>
And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,<lb/>
What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>The colour of the king doth come and go<lb/>
Between his purpose and his conscience,<lb/>
Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:<lb/>
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence<lb/>
The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:<lb/>
Good lords, although my will to give is living,<lb/>
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:<lb/>
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Indeed we heard how near his death he was<lb/>
Before the child himself felt he was sick:<lb/>
This must be answer'd either here or hence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?<lb/>
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?<lb/>
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame<lb/>
That greatness should so grossly offer it:<lb/>
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,<lb/>
And find the inheritance of this poor child,<lb/>
His little kingdom of a forced grave.<lb/>
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,<lb/>
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!<lb/>
This must not be thus borne: this will break out<lb/>
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>They burn in indignation. I repent:<lb/>
There is no sure foundation set on blood,<lb/>
No certain life achieved by others' death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood<lb/>
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?<lb/>
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:<lb/>
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>From France to England. Never such a power<lb/>
For any foreign preparation<lb/>
Was levied in the body of a land.<lb/>
The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;<lb/>
For when you should be told they do prepare,<lb/>
The tidings come that they are all arrived.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?<lb/>
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,<lb/>
That such an army could be drawn in France,<lb/>
And she not hear of it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My liege, her ear<lb/>
Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died<lb/>
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,<lb/>
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died<lb/>
Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue<lb/>
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!<lb/>
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased<lb/>
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!<lb/>
How wildly then walks my estate in France!<lb/>
Under whose conduct came those powers of France<lb/>
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Under the Dauphin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Thou hast made me giddy<lb/>
With these ill tidings.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret</stage></p>


<p>
Now, what says the world<lb/>
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff<lb/>
My head with more ill news, for it is full.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>But if you be afeard to hear the worst,<lb/>
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed<lb/>
Under the tide: but now I breathe again<lb/>
Aloft the flood, and can give audience<lb/>
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>How I have sped among the clergymen,<lb/>
The sums I have collected shall express.<lb/>
But as I travell'd hither through the land,<lb/>
I find the people strangely fantasied;<lb/>
Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,<lb/>
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:<lb/>
And here a prophet, that I brought with me<lb/>
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found<lb/>
With many hundreds treading on his heels;<lb/>
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,<lb/>
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,<lb/>
Your highness should deliver up your crown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PETER</speaker>
<p>Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Hubert, away with him; imprison him;<lb/>
And on that day at noon whereon he says<lb/>
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.<lb/>
Deliver him to safety; and return,<lb/>
For I must use thee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt HUBERT with PETER</stage></p>


<p>
O my gentle cousin,<lb/>
Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:<lb/>
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,<lb/>
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,<lb/>
And others more, going to seek the grave<lb/>
Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night<lb/>
On your suggestion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Gentle kinsman, go,<lb/>
And thrust thyself into their companies:<lb/>
I have a way to win their loves again;<lb/>
Bring them before me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>I will seek them out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.<lb/>
O, let me have no subject enemies,<lb/>
When adverse foreigners affright my towns<lb/>
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!<lb/>
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,<lb/>
And fly like thought from them to me again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.<lb/>
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need<lb/>
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;<lb/>
And be thou he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>With all my heart, my liege.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>My mother dead!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter HUBERT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;<lb/>
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about<lb/>
The other four in wondrous motion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Five moons!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Old men and beldams in the streets<lb/>
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:<lb/>
Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:<lb/>
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads<lb/>
And whisper one another in the ear;<lb/>
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,<lb/>
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,<lb/>
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.<lb/>
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,<lb/>
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,<lb/>
With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;<lb/>
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,<lb/>
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste<lb/>
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,<lb/>
Told of a many thousand warlike French<lb/>
That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:<lb/>
Another lean unwash'd artificer<lb/>
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?<lb/>
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?<lb/>
Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause<lb/>
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>It is the curse of kings to be attended<lb/>
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant<lb/>
To break within the bloody house of life,<lb/>
And on the winking of authority<lb/>
To understand a law, to know the meaning<lb/>
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns<lb/>
More upon humour than advised respect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Here is your hand and seal for what I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth<lb/>
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal<lb/>
Witness against us to damnation!<lb/>
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds<lb/>
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,<lb/>
A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,<lb/>
Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,<lb/>
This murder had not come into my mind:<lb/>
But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,<lb/>
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,<lb/>
Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,<lb/>
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;<lb/>
And thou, to be endeared to a king,<lb/>
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>My lord&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause<lb/>
When I spake darkly what I purposed,<lb/>
Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,<lb/>
As bid me tell my tale in express words,<lb/>
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,<lb/>
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:<lb/>
But thou didst understand me by my signs<lb/>
And didst in signs again parley with sin;<lb/>
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,<lb/>
And consequently thy rude hand to act<lb/>
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.<lb/>
Out of my sight, and never see me more!<lb/>
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,<lb/>
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:<lb/>
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,<lb/>
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,<lb/>
Hostility and civil tumult reigns<lb/>
Between my conscience and my cousin's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Arm you against your other enemies,<lb/>
I'll make a peace between your soul and you.<lb/>
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine<lb/>
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,<lb/>
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.<lb/>
Within this bosom never enter'd yet<lb/>
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;<lb/>
And you have slander'd nature in my form,<lb/>
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,<lb/>
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind<lb/>
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,<lb/>
Throw this report on their incensed rage,<lb/>
And make them tame to their obedience!<lb/>
Forgive the comment that my passion made<lb/>
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,<lb/>
And foul imaginary eyes of blood<lb/>
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.<lb/>
O, answer not, but to my closet bring<lb/>
The angry lords with all expedient haste.<lb/>
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.<lb/>

<p><stage>Before the castle.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ARTHUR, on the walls</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ARTHUR</speaker>
<p>The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:<lb/>
Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!<lb/>
There's few or none do know me: if they did,<lb/>
This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.<lb/>
I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.<lb/>
If I get down, and do not break my limbs,<lb/>
I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:<lb/>
As good to die and go, as die and stay.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Leaps down</stage></p>

O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:<lb/>
Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:<lb/>
It is our safety, and we must embrace<lb/>
This gentle offer of the perilous time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Who brought that letter from the cardinal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,<lb/>
Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love<lb/>
Is much more general than these lines import.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>To-morrow morning let us meet him then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be<lb/>
Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!<lb/>
The king by me requests your presence straight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:<lb/>
We will not line his thin bestained cloak<lb/>
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot<lb/>
That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.<lb/>
Return and tell him so: we know the worst.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>But there is little reason in your grief;<lb/>
Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>This is the prison. What is he lies here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Seeing ARTHUR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!<lb/>
The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Murder, as hating what himself hath done,<lb/>
Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,<lb/>
Found it too precious-princely for a grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,<lb/>
Or have you read or heard? or could you think?<lb/>
Or do you almost think, although you see,<lb/>
That you do see? could thought, without this object,<lb/>
Form such another? This is the very top,<lb/>
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,<lb/>
Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,<lb/>
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,<lb/>
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage<lb/>
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>All murders past do stand excused in this:<lb/>
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,<lb/>
Shall give a holiness, a purity,<lb/>
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;<lb/>
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,<lb/>
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>It is a damned and a bloody work;<lb/>
The graceless action of a heavy hand,<lb/>
If that it be the work of any hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>If that it be the work of any hand!<lb/>
We had a kind of light what would ensue:<lb/>
It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;<lb/>
The practise and the purpose of the king:<lb/>
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,<lb/>
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,<lb/>
And breathing to his breathless excellence<lb/>
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,<lb/>
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:<lb/>
Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>O, he is old and blushes not at death.<lb/>
Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>I am no villain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Must I rob the law?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Drawing his sword</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;<lb/>
By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:<lb/>
I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,<lb/>
Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;<lb/>
Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget<lb/>
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Not for my life: but yet I dare defend<lb/>
My innocent life against an emperor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Thou art a murderer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Do not prove me so;<lb/>
Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,<lb/>
Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>Cut him to pieces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Keep the peace, I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:<lb/>
If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,<lb/>
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,<lb/>
I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;<lb/>
Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,<lb/>
That you shall think the devil is come from hell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?<lb/>
Second a villain and a murderer?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Lord Bigot, I am none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>Who kill'd this prince?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>'Tis not an hour since I left him well:<lb/>
I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep<lb/>
My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,<lb/>
For villany is not without such rheum;<lb/>
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem<lb/>
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.<lb/>
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor<lb/>
The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;<lb/>
For I am stifled with this smell of sin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BIGOT</speaker>
<p>Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>There tell the king he may inquire us out.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?<lb/>
Beyond the infinite and boundless reach<lb/>
Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,<lb/>
Art thou damn'd, Hubert.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Do but hear me, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Ha! I'll tell thee what;<lb/>
Thou'rt damn'd as black&mdash;nay, nothing is so black;<lb/>
Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:<lb/>
There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell<lb/>
As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Upon my soul&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>If thou didst but consent<lb/>
To this most cruel act, do but despair;<lb/>
And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread<lb/>
That ever spider twisted from her womb<lb/>
Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam<lb/>
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,<lb/>
Put but a little water in a spoon,<lb/>
And it shall be as all the ocean,<lb/>
Enough to stifle such a villain up.<lb/>
I do suspect thee very grievously.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,<lb/>
Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath<lb/>
Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,<lb/>
Let hell want pains enough to torture me.<lb/>
I left him well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Go, bear him in thine arms.<lb/>
I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way<lb/>
Among the thorns and dangers of this world.<lb/>
How easy dost thou take all England up!<lb/>
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,<lb/>
The life, the right and truth of all this realm<lb/>
Is fled to heaven; and England now is left<lb/>
To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth<lb/>
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.<lb/>
Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty<lb/>
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest<lb/>
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:<lb/>
Now powers from home and discontents at home<lb/>
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,<lb/>
As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,<lb/>
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.<lb/>
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can<lb/>
Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child<lb/>
And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:<lb/>
A thousand businesses are brief in hand,<lb/>
And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Thus have I yielded up into your hand<lb/>
The circle of my glory.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Giving the crown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Take again<lb/>
From this my hand, as holding of the pope<lb/>
Your sovereign greatness and authority.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,<lb/>
And from his holiness use all your power<lb/>
To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.<lb/>
Our discontented counties do revolt;<lb/>
Our people quarrel with obedience,<lb/>
Swearing allegiance and the love of soul<lb/>
To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.<lb/>
This inundation of mistemper'd humour<lb/>
Rests by you only to be qualified:<lb/>
Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,<lb/>
That present medicine must be minister'd,<lb/>
Or overthrow incurable ensues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>It was my breath that blew this tempest up,<lb/>
Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;<lb/>
But since you are a gentle convertite,<lb/>
My tongue shall hush again this storm of war<lb/>
And make fair weather in your blustering land.<lb/>
On this Ascension-day, remember well,<lb/>
Upon your oath of service to the pope,<lb/>
Go I to make the French lay down their arms.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet<lb/>
Say that before Ascension-day at noon<lb/>
My crown I should give off? Even so I have:<lb/>
I did suppose it should be on constraint:<lb/>
But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out<lb/>
But Dover castle: London hath received,<lb/>
Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:<lb/>
Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone<lb/>
To offer service to your enemy,<lb/>
And wild amazement hurries up and down<lb/>
The little number of your doubtful friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Would not my lords return to me again,<lb/>
After they heard young Arthur was alive?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>They found him dead and cast into the streets,<lb/>
An empty casket, where the jewel of life<lb/>
By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>That villain Hubert told me he did live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.<lb/>
But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?<lb/>
Be great in act, as you have been in thought;<lb/>
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust<lb/>
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:<lb/>
Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;<lb/>
Threaten the threatener and outface the brow<lb/>
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,<lb/>
That borrow their behaviors from the great,<lb/>
Grow great by your example and put on<lb/>
The dauntless spirit of resolution.<lb/>
Away, and glister like the god of war,<lb/>
When he intendeth to become the field:<lb/>
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.<lb/>
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,<lb/>
And fright him there? and make him tremble there?<lb/>
O, let it not be said: forage, and run<lb/>
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,<lb/>
And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>The legate of the pope hath been with me,<lb/>
And I have made a happy peace with him;<lb/>
And he hath promised to dismiss the powers<lb/>
Led by the Dauphin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>O inglorious league!<lb/>
Shall we, upon the footing of our land,<lb/>
Send fair-play orders and make compromise,<lb/>
Insinuation, parley and base truce<lb/>
To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,<lb/>
A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,<lb/>
And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,<lb/>
Mocking the air with colours idly spread,<lb/>
And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:<lb/>
Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;<lb/>
Or if he do, let it at least be said<lb/>
They saw we had a purpose of defence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Have thou the ordering of this present time.<lb/>

<p><stage>LEWIS's camp at St. Edmundsbury.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE,	BIGOT, and Soldiers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,<lb/>
And keep it safe for our remembrance:<lb/>
Return the precedent to these lords again;<lb/>
That, having our fair order written down,<lb/>
Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,<lb/>
May know wherefore we took the sacrament<lb/>
And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Upon our sides it never shall be broken.<lb/>
And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear<lb/>
A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith<lb/>
To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,<lb/>
I am not glad that such a sore of time<lb/>
Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,<lb/>
And heal the inveterate canker of one wound<lb/>
By making many. O, it grieves my soul,<lb/>
That I must draw this metal from my side<lb/>
To be a widow-maker! O, and there<lb/>
Where honourable rescue and defence<lb/>
Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!<lb/>
But such is the infection of the time,<lb/>
That, for the health and physic of our right,<lb/>
We cannot deal but with the very hand<lb/>
Of stern injustice and confused wrong.<lb/>
And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,<lb/>
That we, the sons and children of this isle,<lb/>
Were born to see so sad an hour as this;<lb/>
Wherein we step after a stranger march<lb/>
Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up<lb/>
Her enemies' ranks,&mdash;I must withdraw and weep<lb/>
Upon the spot of this enforced cause,&mdash;<lb/>
To grace the gentry of a land remote,<lb/>
And follow unacquainted colours here?<lb/>
What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!<lb/>
That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,<lb/>
Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,<lb/>
And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;<lb/>
Where these two Christian armies might combine<lb/>
The blood of malice in a vein of league,<lb/>
And not to spend it so unneighbourly!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>A noble temper dost thou show in this;<lb/>
And great affections wrestling in thy bosom<lb/>
Doth make an earthquake of nobility.<lb/>
O, what a noble combat hast thou fought<lb/>
Between compulsion and a brave respect!<lb/>
Let me wipe off this honourable dew,<lb/>
That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:<lb/>
My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,<lb/>
Being an ordinary inundation;<lb/>
But this effusion of such manly drops,<lb/>
This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,<lb/>
Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed<lb/>
Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven<lb/>
Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.<lb/>
Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,<lb/>
And with a great heart heave away the storm:<lb/>
Commend these waters to those baby eyes<lb/>
That never saw the giant world enraged;<lb/>
Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,<lb/>
Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.<lb/>
Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep<lb/>
Into the purse of rich prosperity<lb/>
As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,<lb/>
That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.<lb/>
And even there, methinks, an angel spake:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH</stage></p>


<p>
Look, where the holy legate comes apace,<lb/>
To give us warrant from the hand of heaven<lb/>
And on our actions set the name of right<lb/>
With holy breath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Hail, noble prince of France!<lb/>
The next is this, King John hath reconciled<lb/>
Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,<lb/>
That so stood out against the holy church,<lb/>
The great metropolis and see of Rome:<lb/>
Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;<lb/>
And tame the savage spirit of wild war,<lb/>
That like a lion foster'd up at hand,<lb/>
It may lie gently at the foot of peace,<lb/>
And be no further harmful than in show.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:<lb/>
I am too high-born to be propertied,<lb/>
To be a secondary at control,<lb/>
Or useful serving-man and instrument,<lb/>
To any sovereign state throughout the world.<lb/>
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars<lb/>
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,<lb/>
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;<lb/>
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out<lb/>
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.<lb/>
You taught me how to know the face of right,<lb/>
Acquainted me with interest to this land,<lb/>
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;<lb/>
And come ye now to tell me John hath made<lb/>
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?<lb/>
I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,<lb/>
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;<lb/>
And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back<lb/>
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?<lb/>
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,<lb/>
What men provided, what munition sent,<lb/>
To underprop this action? Is't not I<lb/>
That undergo this charge? who else but I,<lb/>
And such as to my claim are liable,<lb/>
Sweat in this business and maintain this war?<lb/>
Have I not heard these islanders shout out<lb/>
'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?<lb/>
Have I not here the best cards for the game,<lb/>
To win this easy match play'd for a crown?<lb/>
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?<lb/>
No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>You look but on the outside of this work.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Outside or inside, I will not return<lb/>
Till my attempt so much be glorified<lb/>
As to my ample hope was promised<lb/>
Before I drew this gallant head of war,<lb/>
And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,<lb/>
To outlook conquest and to win renown<lb/>
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpet sounds</stage></p>

What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD, attended</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>According to the fair play of the world,<lb/>
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:<lb/>
My holy lord of Milan, from the king<lb/>
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;<lb/>
And, as you answer, I do know the scope<lb/>
And warrant limited unto my tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,<lb/>
And will not temporize with my entreaties;<lb/>
He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>By all the blood that ever fury breathed,<lb/>
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;<lb/>
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.<lb/>
He is prepared, and reason too he should:<lb/>
This apish and unmannerly approach,<lb/>
This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,<lb/>
This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,<lb/>
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared<lb/>
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,<lb/>
From out the circle of his territories.<lb/>
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,<lb/>
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,<lb/>
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,<lb/>
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,<lb/>
To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,<lb/>
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out<lb/>
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake<lb/>
Even at the crying of your nation's crow,<lb/>
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;<lb/>
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,<lb/>
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?<lb/>
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms<lb/>
And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,<lb/>
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.<lb/>
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,<lb/>
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb<lb/>
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;<lb/>
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids<lb/>
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,<lb/>
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,<lb/>
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts<lb/>
To fierce and bloody inclination.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;<lb/>
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;<lb/>
We hold our time too precious to be spent<lb/>
With such a brabbler.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL PANDULPH</speaker>
<p>Give me leave to speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>No, I will speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>We will attend to neither.<lb/>
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war<lb/>
Plead for our interest and our being here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;<lb/>
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start<lb/>
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,<lb/>
And even at hand a drum is ready braced<lb/>
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;<lb/>
Sound but another, and another shall<lb/>
As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear<lb/>
And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,<lb/>
Not trusting to this halting legate here,<lb/>
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need<lb/>
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits<lb/>
A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day<lb/>
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>

Even to our ocean, to our great King John.<lb/>
My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;<lb/>
For I do see the cruel pangs of death<lb/>
Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;<lb/>
And happy newness, that intends old right.<lb/>

<head>Scene 5</head>

<p><stage>The French camp.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEWIS and his train</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,<lb/>
But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,<lb/>
When English measure backward their own ground<lb/>
In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,<lb/>
When with a volley of our needless shot,<lb/>
After such bloody toil, we bid good night;<lb/>
And wound our tattering colours clearly up,<lb/>
Last in the field, and almost lords of it!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Where is my prince, the Dauphin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Here: what news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The Count Melun is slain; the English lords<lb/>
By his persuasion are again fall'n off,<lb/>
And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,<lb/>
Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!<lb/>
I did not think to be so sad to-night<lb/>
As this hath made me. Who was he that said<lb/>
King John did fly an hour or two before<lb/>
The stumbling night did part our weary powers?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEWIS</speaker>
<p>Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:<lb/>
The day shall not be up so soon as I,<lb/>
To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 6</head>

<p><stage>An open place in the neighbourhood of Swinstead Abbey.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD and HUBERT, severally</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>A friend. What art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Of the part of England.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Whither dost thou go?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>What's that to thee? why may not I demand<lb/>
Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Hubert, I think?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Thou hast a perfect thought:<lb/>
I will upon all hazards well believe<lb/>
Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.<lb/>
Who art thou?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Who thou wilt: and if thou please,<lb/>
Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think<lb/>
I come one way of the Plantagenets.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night<lb/>
Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,<lb/>
That any accent breaking from thy tongue<lb/>
Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,<lb/>
To find you out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Brief, then; and what's the news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,<lb/>
Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Show me the very wound of this ill news:<lb/>
I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:<lb/>
I left him almost speechless; and broke out<lb/>
To acquaint you with this evil, that you might<lb/>
The better arm you to the sudden time,<lb/>
Than if you had at leisure known of this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>How did he take it? who did taste to him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,<lb/>
Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king<lb/>
Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HUBERT</speaker>
<p>Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,<lb/>
And brought Prince Henry in their company;<lb/>
At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,<lb/>
And they are all about his majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,<lb/>
And tempt us not to bear above our power!<lb/>
I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,<lb/>
Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;<lb/>
These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;<lb/>
Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.<lb/>
Away before: conduct me to the king;<lb/>
I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.<lb/>

<head>Scene 7</head>

<p><stage>The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>It is too late: the life of all his blood<lb/>
Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,<lb/>
Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,<lb/>
Doth by the idle comments that it makes<lb/>
Foretell the ending of mortality.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PEMBROKE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief<lb/>
That, being brought into the open air,<lb/>
It would allay the burning quality<lb/>
Of that fell poison which assaileth him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Let him be brought into the orchard here.<lb/>
Doth he still rage?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit BIGOT</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PEMBROKE</speaker>
<p>He is more patient<lb/>
Than when you left him; even now he sung.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes<lb/>
In their continuance will not feel themselves.<lb/>
Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,<lb/>
Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now<lb/>
Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds<lb/>
With many legions of strange fantasies,<lb/>
Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,<lb/>
Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death<lb/>
should sing.<lb/>
I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,<lb/>
Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,<lb/>
And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings<lb/>
His soul and body to their lasting rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born<lb/>
To set a form upon that indigest<lb/>
Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;<lb/>
It would not out at windows nor at doors.<lb/>
There is so hot a summer in my bosom,<lb/>
That all my bowels crumble up to dust:<lb/>
I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen<lb/>
Upon a parchment, and against this fire<lb/>
Do I shrink up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>How fares your majesty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>Poison'd,&mdash;ill fare&mdash;dead, forsook, cast off:<lb/>
And none of you will bid the winter come<lb/>
To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,<lb/>
Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course<lb/>
Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north<lb/>
To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips<lb/>
And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,<lb/>
I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait<lb/>
And so ingrateful, you deny me that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>O that there were some virtue in my tears,<lb/>
That might relieve you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>The salt in them is hot.<lb/>
Within me is a hell; and there the poison<lb/>
Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize<lb/>
On unreprievable condemned blood.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the BASTARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>O, I am scalded with my violent motion,<lb/>
And spleen of speed to see your majesty!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING JOHN</speaker>
<p>O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:<lb/>
The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,<lb/>
And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail<lb/>
Are turned to one thread, one little hair:<lb/>
My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,<lb/>
Which holds but till thy news be uttered;<lb/>
And then all this thou seest is but a clod<lb/>
And module of confounded royalty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,<lb/>
Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;<lb/>
For in a night the best part of my power,<lb/>
As I upon advantage did remove,<lb/>
Were in the Washes all unwarily<lb/>
Devoured by the unexpected flood.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>KING JOHN dies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.<lb/>
My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>Even so must I run on, and even so stop.<lb/>
What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,<lb/>
When this was now a king, and now is clay?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind<lb/>
To do the office for thee of revenge,<lb/>
And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,<lb/>
As it on earth hath been thy servant still.<lb/>
Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,<lb/>
Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,<lb/>
And instantly return with me again,<lb/>
To push destruction and perpetual shame<lb/>
Out of the weak door of our fainting land.<lb/>
Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;<lb/>
The Dauphin rages at our very heels.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>It seems you know not, then, so much as we:<lb/>
The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,<lb/>
Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,<lb/>
And brings from him such offers of our peace<lb/>
As we with honour and respect may take,<lb/>
With purpose presently to leave this war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>He will the rather do it when he sees<lb/>
Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>Nay, it is in a manner done already;<lb/>
For many carriages he hath dispatch'd<lb/>
To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel<lb/>
To the disposing of the cardinal:<lb/>
With whom yourself, myself and other lords,<lb/>
If you think meet, this afternoon will post<lb/>
To consummate this business happily.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,<lb/>
With other princes that may best be spared,<lb/>
Shall wait upon your father's funeral.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>At Worcester must his body be interr'd;<lb/>
For so he will'd it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>Thither shall it then:<lb/>
And happily may your sweet self put on<lb/>
The lineal state and glory of the land!<lb/>
To whom with all submission, on my knee<lb/>
I do bequeath my faithful services<lb/>
And true subjection everlastingly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SALISBURY</speaker>
<p>And the like tender of our love we make,<lb/>
To rest without a spot for evermore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE HENRY</speaker>
<p>I have a kind soul that would give you thanks<lb/>
And knows not how to do it but with tears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BASTARD</speaker>
<p>O, let us pay the time but needful woe,<lb/>
Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.<lb/>
This England never did, nor never shall,<lb/>
Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,<lb/>
But when it first did help to wound itself.<lb/>
Now these her princes are come home again,<lb/>
Come the three corners of the world in arms,<lb/>
And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,<lb/>
If England to itself do rest but true.<lb/>
