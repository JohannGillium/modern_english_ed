CHARLES W. CHESNUTT
</head>


<p>AMONG the human flotsam and jetsam that followed in the wake of the
Civil War, there drifted into a certain Southern town, shortly after the
surrender, two young colored men, named respectively William Cain and
Rufus Green.  They had made each other's acquaintance in a refugee camp
attached to an army cantonment, and when the soldiers went away, William
and Rufus were thrown upon their own resources.  They were fast friends,
and discussed with each other the subject of their future.

</p><p>"Well, ez fer me," said William, "my marster had put me ter de
bricklayer's an' plasterer's trade, an' I'd wukked at it six weeks befo'
I come away.  I hadn' larnt eve'ything, but I reckon I knows ernuff
ter make a livin' at it."

</p><p>"Ez fer me," returned Rufus gloomily &mdash; he was not of the most
cheerful temperament &mdash; "I don' know how ter use nuffin' but a hoe."

</p><p>"I has ter use de hoe in my bizness too," rejoined William.  "De
mo'tar has ter be mix' wid a hoe.  W'y can't we go in podners?  You
kin mix de mo'tar, an' I'll put it on, tel I've larnt you all I knows.
We'll keep ou' money tergether, an' w'at I makes shill be ez much
yo'n ez mine, an' w'at you makes shill be ez much mine ez yo'n, an' w'at
we bofe makes shill belong ter bofe of us.  How would dat 'rangement
suit you?"

</p><p>Rufus, having felt some alarm at the prospect of facing the world
alone &mdash; slavery had not been a good school for training in self-reliance
&mdash; found this proposition a very agreeable one, and promptly express-ed his willingness to accept it.

</p><p>"And now," said William, who thus early in the affair assumed
the initiative, "we ought to hab somethin' ter show ou' agreement &mdash;
dat's de way w'ite folks does bizness, an' we'll hafter do de same.  I
knows a man roun' here w'at kin write, an' we'll git some paper an'
hab him draw up de articles."

</p><p>The scribe and the paper were found, and William dictated the
following agreement, the phraseology of which is reminiscent of certain

<pb n="272"/>

solemn forms which he had heard used from time to time, being
town-bred and accustomed to the ways of the world: &mdash;

</p><p>"William Cain and Rufus Green is gone in partners this day to
work at whatever their hands find to do.  What they makes shall belong
to one as much as the other, and they shall stand by each other in
sickness and in health, in good luck and in bad, till death shall us
part, and the Lord have mercy on our souls.  Amen."

</p><p>This was written in a doubtful hand, on each of two sheets of
foolscap paper, and signed by the partners with their respective marks.
Each received a copy of the agreement, and they promised the man a
half-dollar for his services, to be paid out of their first earnings.

</p><p>Having found a place to live, William and Rufus settled down as
well as their uncertain fortunes would permit.  It soon became apparent
that William was the more capable of the two, and equally clear &mdash; to
his patrons at least &mdash; that he had not worked at his trade long enough
to learn to do fine work.  In consequence of the discovery, the partners
soon themselves engaged almost solely in the white-washing and patching
business, at which they were fairly successful.  Even here, however,
William's relative superiority manifested itself, and he generally
wielded the brush while Rufus mixed the whitewash.  When business was
slack, they engaged in such manual labor as they could find.  They ate
together, slept together, and had a common purse, from which they
supplied their necessities and had a little left for amusements and
tobacco.

</p><p>They were living thus, in a hand-to-mouth way, but with the
cheerful contentment characteristic of their race, when a Northern
philanthropist, filled with the fine, post-bellum zeal for the freedmen,
purchased at a low price an extensive plantation in the vicinity of the
town, which he cut up into small farms, and, for the encouragement of
industry and thrift among the Negroes, sold to them at prices little
more than nominal.  All but two of the farms had been disposed of before
he discovered William and Rufus.  Learning that they lived in what they
called partnership, he informed them that such a relation was
incompatible with the development of self-reliance and strength of
character, and that their best interests would be promoted by their
learning each to fight his own battle.  A thoughtful student of history
might have suggested to the philanthropist that the power of highly
developed races lies mainly in their ability to combine for the better
accomplishment of a common purpose.  The good man meant well, however,
and his method was admirably adapted to separate the wheat from the
chaff.  His arguments, or his liberal offer, proved effective; William
and Rufus put away the whitewash pails and brushes and became
freeholders and farmers upon adjoining tracts of land.

</p><p>The soil was fertile, and the new owners were filled with the
buoyant hopefulness and zeal which characterized the colored people
immediately after their emancipation, when there seemed to be a rosy
future for their race, not in some distant generation, when the memory

<pb n="273"/>

of their bondage should have become dim and legendary, but for
themselves and their children.  The good philanthropist, waiving for the
moment his theory of self-reliance &mdash; of which indeed his whole generous
scheme was a contradiction &mdash; gave his beneficiaries advice and
oversight for several years, during which William and Rufus, in company
with their neighbors, throve apace.  In much less time than even the
philanthropist had anticipated, both farms were paid for, and William
and Rufus tasted the pleasures which any healthy-minded man feels when
he first knows himself owner, in fee simple, by metes and bounds, of a
piece of the soil which, in a broader sense, is the common heritage of
mankind.

</p><p>During the first years of their separation William and Rufus
remained fast friends.  The friendship, like their former partnership,
was of more practical benefit to Rufus than to William.  It was largely
due to William's advice about plowing and planting and harvesting, to
William's superior knowledge of horses and cattle and hogs, and his more
trustworthy intuitions about wind and weather, that Rufus had been able
to pay for his farm and procure his deed at the same time with William.
This aid, too, was rendered spontaneously, and so much as a matter of
course, that Rufus, who was a man of slow perceptions, flattered himself
upon being a very successful farmer, and on the high-road to substantial
wealth.

</p><p>Nevertheless, as the years rolled on, William's greater prosperity
became apparent even to Rufus, who began gradually to appreciate
the fact that William's fields bore larger crops, that his cows calved
oftener and gave more milk, that his hogs were fatter and better
bred, that his hens laid more eggs and suffered less from fox or hawk,
or other thieves.

</p><p>Shortly after becoming a landowner Rufus had married a wife, who
in time bore him several children.  William, too, had selected a
helpmeet, with a like effect upon his household.  The first rift in the
long friendship came one day when one of William's children and one of
Rufus's had a juvenile dispute, which, if left to themselves, they would
have forgotten in an hour.  Their mothers, however, took up the quarrel,
and having longer memories, became somewhat estranged over it.  Since
the families were near neighbors and had long been dependent upon one
another for the exchange of neighborly courtesies, a quarrel was irksome
to say the least.  At first William and Rufus paid no attention to the
misunderstanding, its only effect upon them being that they met and
talked along the turnrows and across fences rather than by each other's
firesides.  As it was, the trouble would probably soon have been
smoothed over, had not the demon Envy, with its train of malice and all
uncharitableness, taken possession of Rufus's wife and passed from her
to her husband.

</p><p>Mrs. William Cain came out to church one Sunday in a new
frock.  Rufus was unable, at the moment, to buy his wife a garment
equally handsome.  To make matters worse, William drove Mrs. Cain

<pb n="274"/>

to church the same day in a new buggy, a luxury in which Rufus, who,
like William himself, had hitherto walked to church or driven thither
in his cart, could not as yet afford to indulge.

</p><p>"Dat Cain 'oman is puttin' on mo' airs 'n ef she own' somebody,"
sniffed Mrs. Rufus.  "She jes' displayin' dem clo's, an' he's jes'
bought dat buggy &mdash; he must 'a' got it on credit &mdash; jes' ter show off an'
make us feel po' an' mean.  Rufus, ef you are de man I take you fer,
you won' have nuthin' mo' ter do wid dem people!"

</p><p>When William next saw Rufus working near the fence and walk-ed down to pass the time of day, Rufus saw him coming and moved
farther away.  For the first few times that this occurred, William sup-posed it to be a mere coincidence; but when Rufus one day passed him
on the road without speaking, even the pretence of deep absorption in
thought did not deceive William.  His old friend had turned against
him, and he felt sore at heart.  Surely a friendship of such long standing
ought not to be broken because of a few hard words by two quick-tempered women on account of a children's quarrel.

</p><p>It occurred to William that perhaps he might pour oil upon the
troubled waters.  One Saturday evening he sent his hired man over
to Rufus's house with a message.

</p><p>"My boss wants ter know," said the messenger, "ef you wouldn't
lack ter borry his buggy ter-morrer afternoon an' take a ride somewhar."

</p><p>This seemed to Rufus very kind of William, and he was on the
point of accepting the offer, when Mrs. Green broke in: &mdash;

</p><p>"You kin go an' tell William Cain dat we don' go ridin' in borried
buggies; dat w'en we git able ter pay fer a buggy, we'll ride, an' not
be trapesin' roun' de country showin' off in buggies w'at ain't paid fer!"

</p><p>This message, delivered with fidelity both to language and
spirit, aroused some righteous resentment in William's bosom.  If Rufus
preferred enmity to friendship, William concluded that he would at least
not force his good offices upon his neighbor, but would hereafter wait
until they were requested.  He knew from past experience that Rufus
would need them sooner or later.  As a consequence of this mutual
coolness, the breach between the neighbors became, if not wider, at
least more pronounced.

</p><p>The purchase of the buggy and the incidents growing out of it,
had taken place in the autumn, after the crops had been gathered and
sold.  During the following winter Rufus's sweet potatoes, which had not
been properly put up, began to rot, and almost his entire supply was
spoiled before he became aware of their condition.  During any other
winter, William, whose potatoes always kept well, would have lent him,
at a nominal price, enough potatoes to tide him over the season.  This
time, however, Rufus was compelled to pay winter prices for his
potatoes, and cart them home from the town, five miles away.

</p><p>Henceforth misfortune seemed to follow Rufus.  His cows went

<pb n="275"/>

dry, and the family had to get along without milk, while they could see,
as they drove along the road, William's pigs feeding upon the surplus of
his dairy.  One of Rufus's two horses was taken sick.  Upon a similar
occasion, the winter before, William had suggested treatment which had
cured the complaint.  Rufus administered the same remedy for a different
disease, and the horse died.  So far had the ill-feeling toward his
neighbor gone that Rufus ascribed the death of the horse to William,
instead of to his own folly in giving the medicine without a proper
understanding of the ailment.

</p><p>William would have been willing at any moment to resume their
former relations, upon proper advances from Rufus, of whose misfortunes
he was indeed not fully informed, for intercourse between the two
families had entirely ceased and even the children were forbidden to
play together.  The line that separated their farms marked as well the
boundary between two school districts, and the children went in opposite
directions to different schools.  But there came a time when even
William's patience was exhausted, and he began to feel something like
anger toward his whilom friend.

</p><p>The rear part of William's farm consisted of a low meadow,
through which ran a small stream.  With the instinct of a wise farmer
seeking to diversify his crops to the best advantage, William had
planted this meadow in rice, with very good results.  In the cultivation
of this cereal it was necessary, now and then, to flood the meadow.
This had heretofore been accomplished easily by damming up the stream at
the point where it left William's land, whereby it overspread its banks
and overflowed the low ground.  This had resulted also in flooding
Rufus's meadow, which was of similar location and extent, and through
which the stream flowed before reaching William's land; but as Rufus had
hitherto followed William's advice and example in the matter of planting
rice, this overflow was mutually satisfactory and profitable to both.

</p><p>In the season that followed the beginning of this alienation of
an old friendship, Rufus planted his meadow in rice; but lacking
William's wisdom, and not having the benefit of his advice, Rufus's crop
proved a failure, and the following year he determined to plant the
meadow in corn.  Having received no notice of his neighbor's intention
to change the crop, William planted rice as usual, and in due time
dammed up the stream in order to flood the meadow.  When Rufus saw the
water coming upon his corn, he said nothing to William, but went to
consult a lawyer, who advised an injunction.  A lawsuit was accordingly
begun, and William restrained from backing up the water on the adjoining
land.

</p><p>It was this unneighborly conduct on the part of Rufus that turned
the milk of William's friendship into the gall of enmity.  He employed
the best lawyer in the county, and instructed him to fight the lawsuit
to the bitter end.

</p><p>A quarrel between adjoining land-owners is usually a tedious
affair,

<pb n="276"/>

with many collateral complications, and the law's delays are proverbial.
In the course of the next year or two it became necessary, at a certain
stage of the proceedings, to make a detailed plat of Rufus's farm, for
which purpose a surveyor was employed.  In order to perform his work
properly, the surveyor went to the county records and procured an exact
copy of the description in Rufus's deed.  When with his instruments he
went to survey Rufus's lines he made a remarkable discovery &mdash; the deed
did not convey that piece of land at all, but contained a repetition of
the description of another parcel in the philanthropist's allotment,
previously sold to a different purchaser.

</p><p>The surveyor was &mdash; he believed unjustly &mdash; a poor man.  His
ancestors had once been rich in land and slaves.  His grandfather had
once owned the very plantation out of which Rufus's farm had been
carved.  The family had been ruined by the war.  Driving past these
flourishing farms, the surveyor had often thought they ought to be his
own.  Now he had discovered that one of the best of them was occupied by
a Negro who held it under a clouded title.  After a very brief struggle
with his conscience, the surveyor made a long journey.  In a distant
Northern city he found a descendant of the philanthropist, who had met
with reverses and had died in comparative poverty.  Upon certain
plausible representations the surveyor procured, for a small sum, a
quit-claim deed of all the right, title and interest of the
philanthropist's heir in the land occupied and improved for many years
by Rufus.  Armed with this document he returned home and began an action
in ejectment.

</p><p>The writ served upon Rufus fell like a bombshell in the heart of
his household.  Never had he so needed the advice and moral support of
his former friend as when he first comprehended the import of the
proceedings now begun against him.  If he had followed his first
impulse, he would have gone and begged his friend's pardon for his own
past conduct, to which, he obscurely realized, the alienation of recent
years was almost entirely due.  Some such suggestion to his wife evoked,
however, a torrent of indignant protest.

</p><p>"Beg his pa'don indeed!" she cried.  "He's 'sponsable fer all ou'
troubles.  Ef he had n' dammed up dat creek you never would 'a' gone
ter law, an' den you would n' 'a' h'ed no su'veyor, an' all dis trouble
would n' 'a' come on us.  He's 'sponsable fer it all, an' you sha' n't go
nigh 'im."

</p><p>So Rufus went for advice to his lawyer, who tried the case and
lost it on a technicality.  A better advocate might have won it.  A rich
man, properly advised, might have taken the case to a higher court with
a fair prospect of ultimate success.  But Rufus's misfortunes, including
the expenses of litigation, had exhausted his cash and his credit, both
of which had been derived from the property now decreed to be no longer
his.  He lost the spring of hope, and yielded to

<pb n="277"/>

what seemed the inevitable.  His wife took the blow as hard, but in a
different manner.

</p><p>"You're no 'count at all," she said to Rufus bitterly.  "I ma'ied
a man wid land an' hosses an' cows an' hawgs.  Now after ten years er
slavin', w'at is I got?  A man wid nuthin', an' not much er dat!  I've
wukked myse'f ter skin an' bone, fer who?  Fer a w'ite man!  I mought as
well never 'a' be'n freed.  But I'll do so no longer!  Hencefo'th you
c'n go yo' way an' I'll go mine."

</p><p>She went away in anger, taking her two children and moving to the
neighboring town, where she rented a small room and took in washing for
a living.  Rufus still lingered at the farm, which he had received a
two-weeks' notice to vacate.  Several times during the first week he had
seen William near the line fence, looking toward the house that must
soon be occupied by strangers.  Perhaps William was sorry for his old
friend &mdash; more likely he was gloating over his fallen enemy.  Rufus
hardened his heart and stiffened his neck, and when he saw William,
looked the other way.

</p><p>On the last day of the second week Rufus harnessed up the old
sore-backed horse, his sole remaining beast of burden, to the rickety
spring wagon which in the apathy of hopelessness he had not cleaned
or repaired for several months.  Only the day before he had seen the
new owner riding along the road with his wife, inspecting their future
domain.  Rufus had rented an abandoned log cabin in the woods not
far away, where he could hide his diminished head in shame; and he
hoped to procure day's work on the neighboring farms, whereby to
keep body and soul together.  He would resign his deaconship in the
church, and henceforth lead the life of obscurity for which alone his
meager talents qualified him.  It was hard, nevertheless, to leave the
land that he had labored upon for so many years, the house he had
built with his own hands, and in which he had expected to spend his
declining years in peaceful comfort &mdash; it was very, very hard.

</p><p>He loaded the wagon with his few remaining chattels &mdash; his wife
had taken some, and others had been sold.  When he had brought the
last piece out of the house, he sat down upon the doorstep and buried
his face in his hands.  In that moment of self-examination the true
source of his misfortunes became entirely clear to him.  Long he sat
there, until even the sore-backed horse turned his head with an air of
mild surprise in his lack-lustre eye.

</p><p>"Rufus!"

</p><p>So deeply had Rufus been absorbed in his own somber thoughts
that he had not seen William climb over the fence and approach
the house.  At the sound of his voice so near at hand, Rufus looked
up and saw William standing before him with outstretched hand.

</p><p>"No, William," said Rufus, shaking his head slowly, "I could n'
shake han's wid you."

</p><p>"Stop yo' foolishness, Rufus, an' listen ter me?  Gimme yo'
han'!"

<pb n="278"/>

</p><p>"No, William," returned Rufus sadly, "I ain' fitten fer ter tech
yo' han'.  You wuz my bes' frien'; you made me w'at I wuz; an' I
tu'ned my back on you, an' ha'dened my heart lak Farro of ole Egyp'
ter de child'en er Is'ael.  You had never done me nuthin' but good;
but I went ter de law 'g'inst you, an' den de law come ter me &mdash; an'
I've be'n sarved right!  I ain' fitten' ter tech yo' han', William.  Go
'long an' leave me ter my punishment!"

</p><p>"You has spoke de truf, Rufus, de Lord's truf! but ef I kin
fergive w'at you done ter me, dey ain' no 'casion fer you ter bear
malice 'ginst yo'se'f.  Git up f'm dere, man, an' gimme yo' han', an'
den listen ter my wo'ds!"

</p><p>Rufus rose slowly, and taking each other's hands they buried their
enmity in a prolonged and fervent clasp.

</p><p>"An' now Rufus," said William drawing from his pocket an old
yellow paper, through which the light shone along the seams where it
had been folded, "does you reco'nize dat paper?"

</p><p>"No, William, you 'member I never l'arned ter read."

</p><p>"Well, I has, an' I'll read dis paper ter you:

</p><p>"'William Cain an' Rufus Green is gone in partners this day to
work at whatever their hands find to do.  What they makes shall belong
to one as much as the other, and they shall stand by each other in
sickness and in health, in good luck and in bad, till death shall us
part, and the Lord have mercy on our souls.  Amen."

</p><p>"Ou' ole podnership paper, William," said Rufus sadly, "ou' ole
podnership, w'at wuz broke up ten years ago!"

</p><p>"Broke up?  Who said it wuz broke up?" exclaimed William.  It
says 'in good luck an' in bad, till death shall us part,' an' it means
w'at it says!  Do you suppose de Lord would have mussy on my soul ef
I wuz ter fersake my ole podner at de time er his greates' trouble?
He would n' be a jes' God ef he did!  Come 'long now, Rufus, an'
we'll put dem things back in yo' house, an onhitch dat hoss.  You ain'
gwine ter stir one foot f'm dis place, onless it's ter go home ter dinner
wid me.  I've seen my lawyer, an' he says you got plenty er time yit
ter 'peal you' case an' take it ter de upper co't, wid eve'y chance ter
win it &mdash; an' he's a hones' man, w'at knows de law.  I've got money in
de bank, an' w'at's mine is yo'n till yo' troubles is ended, an' f'm dis
time fo'th we is podners 'till death shall us part.'"
