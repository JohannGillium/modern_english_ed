<head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>  
  
<p>WILLIAM PENN, <hi rend="italic">the founder of Pennsylvania, was the son of Sir  
William Penn, a distinguished English Admiral.  He was born in 1644.  
His boyhood was marked by a combination of pietism with a strong  
interest in athletics, and he was expelled from Oxford for  
nonconformity.  After leaving the University he traveled on the  
Continent, served in the navy, and studied law. In 1667 he became a  
Quaker, and in the next year he was committed to the Tower for an  
attack on the orthodoxy of the day.  During his imprisonment he wrote  
his well-known treatise on self-sacrifice, "No Cross, No Crown"; and  
after his release he suffered from time to time renewed imprisonments,  
till he finally turned his attention to America as a possible refuge  
for the persecuted Friends.  In 1682 he obtained a charter creating  
him proprietor and governor of East New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and,  
after drawing up a constitution for the colony on the basis of  
religious toleration, he sailed for his new province.  After two  
years, during which the population of the colony grew rapidly through  
emigration from Germany, Holland, and Scandinavia, as well as Great  
Britain, he returned to England, where his consultations with James  
II, whom he believed to be sincere in his professions of toleration,  
led to much misunderstanding of his motives and character.  At the  
Revolution of 1688 he was treated as a Jacobite, but finally obtained  
the goodwill of William III, and resumed his preaching and writing.  
In 1699 he again came to America, this time with the intention of  
remaining; but two years later he went home to oppose the proposal to  
convert his province into a crown colony.  Queen Anne received him  
favorably, and he remained in England till his death in 1719.</hi>  
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Penn's voluminous writings are largely controversial, and often  
concerned with issues no longer vital.  But his interpretation and  
defense of Quaker doctrine remain important; and the "Fruits of  
Solitude," here printed, is a mine of pithy comment upon human life,  
which combines with the acute common sense of Franklin the spiritual  
elevation of Woolman.</hi> </p>

<head>THE PREFACE</head>  
  
<p>READER, &mdash; This Enchiridion, I present thee with, is the Fruit  
of Solitude: A School few care to learn in, tho' None instructs  
us better.  Some Parts of it are the Result of serious Reflection:  
Others the Fleshings of Lucid Intervals: Writ for private Satisfaction,   
and now publish'd for an Help to Human Conduct.  
</p><p>The Author blesseth God for his Retirement, and kisses that  
Gentle Hand which led him into it: For though it should prove  
Barren to the World, it can never do so to him.  
</p><p>He has now had some Time he could call his own; a Property  
he was never so much Master of before: In which he has taken  
a View of himself and the World; and observed wherein he hath  
hit and mist the Mark; What might have been done, what  
mended, and what avoided in his Human Conduct: Together  
with the Omissions and Excesses of others, as well Societies and  
Governments, as private Families, and Persons.  And he verily  
thinks, were he to live over his Life again, he could not only,  
with God's Grace, serve Him, but his Neighbor and himself,  
better than he hath done, and have Seven Years of his Time to  
spare.  And yet perhaps he hath not been the Worst or the  
Idlest Man in the World; nor is he the Oldest.  And this is the  
rather said, that it might quicken, Thee, Reader, to lose none of  
the Time that is yet thine.  
</p><p>There is nothing of which we are apt to be so lavish as of  
Time, and about which we ought to be more solicitous; since  
without it we can do nothing in this World.  Time is what we  
want most, but what, alas! we use worst; and for which God  
will certainly most strictly reckon with us, when Time shall  
be no more.  
</p><p>It is of that Moment to us in Reference to both Worlds,  
that I can hardly wish any Man better, than that he would  
seriously consider what he does with his Time: How and to  
What Ends he Employs it; and what Returns he makes to  
God, his Neighbor and Himself for it.  Will he ne'er have a  
Leidger for this? This, the greatest Wisdom and Work of Life.  
</p><p>To come but once into the World, and Trifle away our true  
Enjoyment of it, and of our selves in it, is lamentable indeed.   
This one Reflection would yield a thinking Person great Instruction.  
<pb n="334"/>   
And since nothing below Man can so Think; Man, In  
being Thoughtless, must needs fall below himself.  And that,  
to be sure, such do, as are unconcern'd in the Use of their most  
Precious Time.  
</p><p>This is but too evident, if we will allow our selves to  
consider,  
that there 's hardly any Thing we take by the Right End, or  
improve to its just Advantage.  
</p><p>We understand little of the Works of God, either In Nature  
or Grace.  We pursue False Knowledge, and Mistake Education   
extreamly.  We are violent in our Affections, Confused  
and Immethodical in our whole Life; making That a Burthen,  
which was given for a Blessing; and so of little Comfort to our  
selves or others; Misapprehending the true Notion of Happiness,  
and so missing of the Right Use of Life, and Way of happy  
Living.  
</p><p>And till we are perswaded to stop, and step a little aside, out  
of the noisy Crowd and Incumbering Hurry of the World, and  
Calmly take a Prospect of Thins, it will be impossible we  
should be able to make a right judgment of our Selves or know  
our own Misery.  But after we have made the just Reckonings  
which Retirement will help us to, we shall begin to think the  
World in great measure Mad, and that we have been in a sort  
of Bedlam all this while.  
</p><p>Reader, whether Young or Old, think it not too soon or too  
late to turn over the Leaves of thy past Life: And be sure to  
fold down where any Passage of it may affect thee; And bestow  
thy Remainder of Time, to correct those Faults in thy future  
Conduct; Be it in Relation to this or the next life.  What thou  
wouldst do, if what thou hast done were to do again, be sure to  
do as long as thou livest, upon the like Occasions.  
</p><p>Our Resolutions seem to be Vigorous, as often as we reflect  
upon our past Errors; But, Alas! they are apt to flat again upon  
fresh Temptations to the same Things.  
</p><p>The Author does not pretend to deliver thee an Exact Place;  
his Business not being Ostentation, but Charity.  'Tis   
Miscellaneous in the Matter of it, and by no means Artificial in the  
Composure.  But it contains Hints, that it may serve thee for  
Texts to Preach to thy Self upon, and which comprehend Much  
of the Course of Human Life: Since whether thou art Parent or  
Child, Prince or Subject, Master or Servant, Single or Married,  
<pb n="335"/>   
Publick or Private, Mean or Honorable, Rich  or Poor, Prosperous  
or Improsperous, in Peace or Controversy, in Business or Solitude;  
Whatever be thy Inclination or Aversion, Practice or Duty, thou  
wilt find something not unsuitably said for thy Direction and   
Advantage.  Accept and Improve what deserves thy Notice; The  
rest excuse, and place to account of good Will to Thee and the  
whole Creation of God.

<head>THE INTRODUCTION TO THE READER</head>  
  
<p>THE Title of this Treatise shows, there was a former of the  
same Nature; and the Author hopes he runs no Hazard in  
recommending both to his Reader's Perusal.  He is well aware  
of the low Reckoning the Labors of indifferent Authors are  
under, at a Time when hardly any Thing passes for current,  
that is not calculated to flatter the Sharpness of contending

they cannot raise and support their Credit, by their own   
Usefulness; and how far this will be able to do it, he knows not;  
yet he thinks himself tollerably safe in making it publick, in  
three Respects.  
</p><p>First, That the Purchase is small, and the Time but little, that  
is requisite to read it.  
</p><p>Next, Though some Men should not find it relish'd high  
enough for their finer Wits, or warmer Pallats, it will not   
perhaps be useless to those of lower Flights, and who are less   
engaged in publick Heats.  
</p><p>Lastly, The Author honestly aims at as general a Benefit as  
the Thing will bear; to Youth especially, whether he hits the  
Mark or not: And that without the least Ostentation, or any  
private Regards.

<div2 type="section" id="d10">
<head>IGNORANCE</head> 
  
<p>IT IS admirable to consider how many Millions of People  
come into, and go out of the World, Ignorant of themselves,   
and of the World they have lived in.  
</p><p>2.  If one went to see Windsor-Castle, or Hampton-Court,  
it would be strange not to observe and remember the Situation,   
the Building, the Gardens, Fountains, &amp;c. that make  
up the Beauty and Pleasure of such a Seat? And yet few  
People know themselves; No, not their own Bodies, the  
Houses of their Minds, the most curious Structure of the  
World; a living walking Tabernacle: Nor the World of  
which it was made, and out of which it is fed; which would  
be so much our Benefit, as well as our Pleasure, to know.   
We cannot doubt of this when we are told that the Invisible  
Things of God are brought to light by the Things that are  
seen; and consequently we read our Duty in them as often  
as we look upon them, to him that is the Great and Wise  
Author of them, if we look as we should do.  
</p><p>3.  The World is certainly a great and stately Volume of  
natural Things; and may be not improperly styled the   
Hieroglyphicks of a better: But, alas! how very few Leaves of it  
do we seriously turn over! This ought to be the Subject of  
the Education of our Youth, who, at Twenty, when they  
should be fit for Business, know little or nothing of it.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d11">
<head>EDUCATION</head>  
<p>4.   We are in Pain to make them Scholars, but not Men!  
To talk, rather than to know, which is true Canting.  
<pb n="338"/>   
</p><p>5.  The first Thing obvious to Children is what is sensible;  
and that we make no Part of their rudiments.  
</p><p>6.  We press their Memory too soon, and puzzle, strain, and  
load them with Words and Rules; to know Grammer and  
Rhetorick, and a strange Tongue or two, that it is ten  
to one may never be useful to them; Leaving their natural  
Genius to Mechanical and Physical, or natural Knowledge  
uncultivated and neglected; which would be of exceeding  
Use and Pleasure to them through the whole Course of  
their Life.  
</p><p>7.  To be sure, Languages are not to be despised or   
neglected.  But Things are still to be preferred.  
</p><p>8.  Children had rather be making of Tools and Instruments   
of Play; Shaping, Drawing, Framing, and Building,  
&amp;c. than getting some Rules of Propriety of Speech by Heart:  
And those also would follow with more judgment, and less  
Trouble and Time.  
</p><p>9.  It were Happy if we studied Nature more in natural  
Things; and acted according to Nature; whose rules are few,  
plain and most reasonable.  
</p><p>10.  Let us begin where she begins, go her Pace, and close  
always where she ends, and we cannot miss of being good  
Naturalists.  
</p><p>11.  The Creation would not be longer a Riddle to us: The  
Heavens, Earth, and Waters, with their respective, various  
and numerous Inhabitants: Their Productions, Natures,  
Seasons, Sympathies and Antipathies; their Use, Benefit and  
Pleasure, would be better understood by us: And an eternal  
Wisdom, Power, Majesty, and Goodness, very conspicuous  
to us, thro' those sensible and passing Forms: The World  
wearing the Mark of its Maker, whose Stamp is everywhere  
visible, and the Characters very legible to the Children of  
Wisdom.  
</p><p>12.  And it would go a great way to caution and direct  
People in their Use of the World, that they were better  
studied and known in the Creation of it.  
</p><p>13.  For how could Man find the Confidence to abuse it,  
while they should see the Great Creator stare them in the  
Face, in all and every part thereof?  
</p><p>14.  Their Ignorance makes them insensible, and that   
<pb n="339"/>   
Insensibility hardy in misusing this noble Creation, that has the  
Stamp and Voice of a Deity every where, and in every Thing  
to the Observing.  
</p><p>15.  It is pity therefore that Books have not been composed  
for Youth, by some curious and careful Naturalists, and also  
Mechanicks, in the Latin Tongue, to be used in Schools, that  
they might learn Things with Words: Things obvious and  
familiar to them, and which would make the Tongue easier  
to be obtained by them.  
</p><p>16.  Many able Gardiners and Husbandmen are yet  
Ignorant of the Reason of their Calling as most Artificers   
are of the Reason of their own Rules that govern  
their excellent Workmanship.  But a Naturalist and   
Mechanick of this sort is Master of the Reason of both, and  
might be of the Practice too, if his Industry kept pace  
with his Speculation; which were very commendable; and  
without which he cannot be said to be a complete Naturalist   
or Mechanick.  
</p><p>17.  Finally, if Man be the Index or Epitomy of the World,  
as Philosophers tell us, we have only to read our selves well  
to be learned in it.  But because there is nothing we less   
regard than the Characters of the Power that made us, which  
are so clearly written upon us and the World he has given us,  
and can best tell us what we are and should be, we are even  
Strangers to our own Genius: The Glass in which we should  
see that true instructing and agreeable Variety, which is to  
be observed in Nature, to the Admiration of that Wisdom  
and Adoration of that Power which made us all. 
</p>
</div2> 
<div2 type="section" id="d12"> 
<head>PRIDE</head>  
<p>18.  And yet we are very apt to be full of our selves,   
instead of Him that made what we so much value; and, but for  
whom we can have no Reason to value our selves.  For we  
have nothing that we can call our own; no, not our selves:  
For we are all but Tenants, and at Will too, of the great  
Lord of our selves, and the rest of this great Farm, the  
World that we live upon.  
</p><p>19.  But methinks we cannot answer it to our Selves as well  
as our Maker, that we should live and die ignorant of our  
<pb n="340"/>   
Selves, and thereby of Him and the Obligations we are under  
to Him for our Selves.  
</p><p>20.  If the worth of a Gift sets the Obligation, and directs  
the return of the Party that receives it; he that is ignorant  
of it, will be at a loss to value it and the Giver, for it.  
</p><p>21.   Here is Man in his Ignorance of himself.  He knows  
not how to estimate his Creator, because he knows not how  
to value his Creation.  If we consider his Make, and lovely  
Compositure; the several Stories of his lovely Structure.   
His divers Members, their Order, Function and Dependency:  
The Instruments of Food, the Vessels of Digestion, the   
several Transmutations it passes.  And how Nourishment is   
carried and diffused throughout the whole Body, by most innate  
and imperceptible Passages.  How the Animal Spirit is  
thereby refreshed, and with an unspeakable Dexterity and  
Motion sets all Parts at work to feed themselves.  And last  
of all, how the Rational Soul is seated in the Animal, as its  
proper House, as is the Animal in the Body: I say if this  
rare Fabrick alone were but considered by us, with all the  
rest by which it is fed and comforted, surely Man would  
have a more reverent Sense of the Power, Wisdom and Goodness   
of God, and of that Duty he owes to Him for it.  But  
if he would be acquainted with his own Soul, its noble Faculties,   
its Union with the Body, its Nature and End, and the  
Providences by which the whole Frame of Humanity is   
preserved, he would Admire and Adore his Good and Great God.   
But Man is become a strange Contradiction to himself; but  
it is of himself; Not being by Constitution, but Corruption,  
such.  
</p><p>22.  He would have others obey him, even his own kind;  
but he will not obey God, that is so much above him, and who  
made him.  
</p><p>23.  He will lose none of his Authority; no, not bate an  
Ace of it: He is humorous<ref target="PenSoln1">1</ref> 
to his Wife, he beats his Children,  
is angry with his Servants, strict with his Neighbors, revenges   
all Affronts to Extremity; but, alas, forgets all the  
while that he is the Man; and is more in Arrear to God, that  
is so very patient with him, than they are to him with whom  
he is so strict and impatient.  
<pb n="341"/>   
</p><p>24.  He is curious to wash, dress, and perfume his Body,  
but careless of his Soul.  The one shall have many Hours,  
the other not so many Minutes.  This shall have three or  
four new Suits in a Year, but that must wear its old Cloaths  
still.  
</p><p>25.  If he be to receive or see a great Man, how nice and  
anxious is he that all things be in order? And with what  
Respect and Address does he approach and make his Court?  
But to God, how dry and formal and constrained in his  
Devotion?  
</p><p>26.  In his Prayers he says, Thy Will be done: But means  
his own: At least acts so.  
</p><p>27.  It is too frequent to begin with God and end with the  
World.  But He is the good Man's Beginning and End; his  
Alpha and Omega.

<head>LUXURY</head> 
<p> 
28.  Such is now become our Delicacy,  
that we will not eat  ordinary Meat, nor drink small, 
pall'd<ref target="PenSoln2">2</ref>  
Liquor; we must have  
the best, and the best cook'd for our Bodies, while our Souls  
feed on empty or corrupted Things.  
</p><p>29.  In short, Man is spending all upon a bare House, and  
hath little or no Furniture within to recommend it; which  
is preferring the Cabinet before the jewel, a Lease of seven  
Years before an Inheritance.  So absurd a thing is Man, after  
all his proud Pretences to Wit and Understanding.

</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d14">
<head>INCONSIDERATION</head>
<p>30.  The want of due Consideration is the Cause of all the  
Unhappiness Man brings upon himself.  For his second  
Thoughts rarely agree with his first, which pass not without  
a considerable Retrenchment or Correction.  And yet that  
sensible Warning is, too frequently, not Precaution enough  
for his future Conduct.  
</p><p>31.  Well may we say our Infelicity is of our selves; since  
there is nothing we do that we should not do, but we know  
it, and yet do it.
</p>
</div2>
<pb n="342"/>   
<div2 type="section" id="d15">
<head>DISAPPOINTMENT AND RESIGNATION</head>
<p>32.  For Disappointments, that come not by our own Folly,  
they are the Tryals or Corrections of Heaven: And it is our  
own Fault, if they prove not our Advantage.  
</p><p>33.  To repine at them does not mend the Matter: It is only  
to grumble at our Creator.  But to see the Hand of God in  
them, with an humble submission to his Will, is the Way to  
turn our Water into Wine, and engage the greatest Love and  
Mercy on our side.  
</p><p>34.  We must needs disorder our selves, if we only look at  
our Losses.  But if we consider how little we deserve what  
is left, our Passion will cool, and our Murmurs will turn into  
Thankfulness.  
</p><p>35.  If our Hairs fall not to the Ground, less do we or our  
Substance without God's Providence.  
</p><p>36.  Nor can we fall below the Arms of God, how low   
soever it be we fall.  
</p><p>37.  For though our Saviour's Passion is over, his   
Compassion is not.  That never fails his humble, sincere   
Disciples: In him, they find more than all that they lose in the  
World.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d16">
<head>MURMURING</head>  
<p>38.  Is it reasonable to take it ill, that any Body desires of  
us that which is their own? All we have is the Almighty's:  
And shall not God have his own when he calls for it?  
</p><p>39.  Discontentedness is not only in such a Case Ingratitude,   
but Injustice.  For we are both unthankful for the time  
we had it, and not honest enough to restore it, if we could  
keep it.  
</p><p>40.  But it is hard for us to look on things in such a Glass,  
and at such a Distance from this low World; and yet it is  
our Duty, and would be our Wisdom and our Glory to do so.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d17">
<head>CENSORIOUSNESS</head>
<p>41.  We are apt to be very pert at censuring others, where  
we will not endure advice our selves.  And nothing shews  
our Weakness more than to be so sharp-sighted at spying  
other Men's Faults, and so purblind about our own.  
<pb n="343"/>   
</p><p>42.  When the Actions of a Neighbor are upon the Stage,  
we can have all our Wits about us, are so quick and critical  
we can split an Hair, and find out ever Failure and Infirmity:   
But are without feeling, or have but very little Sense  
of our own.  
</p><p>43.  Much of this comes from Ill Nature, as well as from  
an inordinate Value of our selves: For we love Rambling  
better than home, and blaming the unhappy, rather than   
covering and relieving them.  
</p><p>44.   In such Occasions some shew their Malice, and are  
witty upon Misfortunes; others their Justice, they can reflect  
a pace: But few or none their Charity; especially if it be  
about Money Matters.  
</p><p>45.   You shall see an old Miser come forth with a set  
Gravity, and so much Severity against the distressed, to   
excuse his Purse, that he will, e'er he has done, put it out of  
all Question, That Riches is Righteousness with him.  This,  
says he, is the Fruit of your Prodigality (as if, poor Man,  
Covetousness were no Fault) Or, of your Projects, or grasping   
after a great Trade: While he himself would have done  
the same thing, but that he had not the Courage to venture  
so much ready Money out of his own trusty Hands, though it  
had been to have brought him back the Indies in return.  But  
the Proverb is just, Vice should not correct Sin.  
</p><p>46.  They have a Right to censure, that have a Heart to  
help: The rest is Cruelty, not Justice.

<div2 type="section" id="d18">
<head>BOUNDS OF CHARITY</head>  
<p>47.  Lend not beyond thy Ability, nor refuse to lend out of  
thy Ability; especially when it will help others more than it  
can hurt thee.  
</p><p>48.  If thy Debtor be honest and capable, thou hast thy  
Mony again, if not with Encrease, with Praise.  If he prove  
insolvent, don't ruin him to get that, which it will not ruin  
thee to lose: For thou art but a Steward, and another is thy  
Owner, Master and judge.  
</p><p>48.  The more merciful Acts thou dost, the more Mercy  
thou wilt receive; and if with a charitable Imployment of  
thy Temporal Riches, thou gainest eternal Treasure, thy Purchase  
<pb n="344"/>   
is infinite: Thou wilt have found the Art of Multiplying

<div2 type="section" id="d19">
<head>FRUGALITY OR BOUNTY</head>
<p>50.  Frugality is good if Liberality be join'd with it.  The  
first is leaving off superfluous Expences; the last bestowing  
them to the Benefit of others that need.  The first without  
the last begins Covetousness; the last without the first begins  
Prodigality: Both together make an excellent Temper.   
Happy the Place where ever that is found.  
</p><p>51.   Were it universal, we should be Cur'd of two   
Extreams, Want and Excess: and the one would supply the  
other, and so bring both nearer to a Mean; the just Degree  
of earthly Happiness.  
</p><p>52.  It is a Reproach to Religion and Government to suffer  
so much Poverty and Excess.  
</p><p>53.  Were the Superfluities of a Nation valued, and made  
a perpetual Tax or Benevolence, there would be more Alms-houses than Poor; Schools than Scholars; and enough to  
spare for Government besides.  
</p><p>54.  Hospitality is good, if the poorer sort are the subjects  
of our Bounty; else too near a Superfluity.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d20">
<head>DISCIPLINE</head>  
<p>55.  If thou wouldst he happy and easie in thy Family,  
above all things observe Discipline.  
</p><p>56.  Every one in it should know their Duty; and there  
should be a Time and Place for every thing; and whatever  
else is done or omitted, be sure to begin and end with God.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d21">
<head>INDUSTRY</head>  
<p>57.  Love Labor: For if thou dost not want it for Food,  
thou mayest for Physick.  It is wholesom for thy Body, and  
good for thy Mind.  It prevents the Fruits of Idleness, which  
many times comes of nothing to do, and leads too many to  
do what is worse than nothing.  
</p><p>58.  A Garden, an Elaboratory, a Work-house, Improvements  
<pb n="345"/>   
and Breeding, are pleasant and Profitable Diversions  
to the Idle and Ingenious: For here they miss Ill Company,  
and converse with Nature and Art; whose Variety are  
equally grateful and instructing; and preserve a good   
Constitution of Body and Mind.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d22">
<head>TEMPERANCE</head>
<p>59.  To this a spare Diet contributes much.  Eat therefore  
to live, and do not live to eat.  That's like a Man, but this  
below a Beast.  
</p><p>60.  Have wholesome, but not costly Food, and be rather  
cleanly than dainty in ordering it.  
</p><p>61.  The Receipts of Cookery are swell'd to a Volume, but  
a good Stomach excels them all; to which nothing contributes   
more than Industry and Temperance.  
</p><p>62.  It is a cruel Folly to offer up to Ostentation so many  
Lives of Creatures, as make up the State of our Treats; as  
it is a prodigal one to spend more in Sawce than in Meat.  
</p><p>63.  The Proverb says, That enough is as good as a Feast:  
But it is certainly better, if Superfluity be a Fault, which  
never fails to be at Festivals.  
</p><p>64.  If thou rise with an Appetite, thou art sure never to  
sit down without one.  
</p><p>65.  Rarely drink but when thou art dry; nor then,   
between Meals, if it can be avoided.  
</p><p>66.  The smaller<ref target="PenSoln4">4</ref> 
 the Drink, the clearer the Head, and the  
cooler the Blood; which are great Benefits in Temper and  
Business.  
</p><p>67.  Strong Liquors are good at some Times, and in small  
Proportions; being better for Physick than Food, for Cordials   
than common Use.  
</p><p>68.  The most common things are the most useful; which  
shews both the Wisdom and Goodness of the great Lord of  
the Family of the World.  
</p><p>69.  What therefore he has made rare, don't thou use too  
commonly: Lest thou shouldest invert the Use and Order of  
things; become Wanton and Voluptuous; and thy Blessings  
prove a Curse.  
<pb n="346"/>   
</p><p>70.  Let nothing be lost, said our saviour.  But that is lost  
that is misused.  
</p><p>71.  Neither urge another to that thou wouldst be unwilling  
to do thy self, nor do thy self what looks to thee unseemly,  
and intemperate in another.  
</p><p>72.  All Excess is ill: But Drunkenness is of the worst  
Sort.  It spoils Health, dismounts the Mind, and unmans  
Men: It reveals Secrets, is Quarrelsome, Lascivious, Impudent,   
Dangerous and Mad.  In fine, he that is drunk is not  
a Man: Because he is so long void of Reason, that   
distinguishes a Man from a Beast.

</p><p>74.   Chuse thy Cloaths by thine own Eyes, not another's.   
The more plain and simple they are, the better.  Neither   
unshapely, nor fantastical; and for Use and decency, and not  
for Pride.  
</p><p>75.  If thou art clean and warm, it is sufficient; for more

are the Rich and Charming Attire of the Soul: And the  
plainer the Dress, the more Distinctly, and with greater

grow weary of a Married State, and stray from thy Promise,  
to search out thy Pleasures in forbidden Places.  
<pb n="347"/>   
</p><p>81.  Let not Enjoyment lessen, but augment Affection; it  
being the basest of Passions to like when we have not, what  
we slight when we possess.  
</p><p>82.  It is the difference betwixt Lust and Love, that this is  
fixt, that volatile.  Love grows, Lust wastes by Enjoyment:  
And the Reason is, that one springs from an union of Souls,

Purge of the Law.  The only Gratification he gives his  
Neighbors, is to let them see that he himself is as little the  
better for what he has, as they are.  For he always looks  
like Lent; a Sort of Lay Minim.<ref target="PenSoln7">7</ref>  
In some Sense he may be  
compar'd to Pharoah's lean Kine, for all that he has does  
him no good.  He commonly wears his Cloaths till they leave  
him, or that no Body else can wear them.  He affects to be  
thought poor, to escape Robbery and Taxes: And by looking  
as if he wanted an Alms, excusing himself from giving any.   
He ever goes late to Markets, to cover buying the worst:  
But does it because that is cheapest.  He lives of the Offal.   
His Life were an insupportable Punishment to any Temper  
but his own: And no greater Torment to him on Earth, than  
to live as other Men do.  But the Misery of his Pleasure is,  
that he is never satisfied with getting, and always in Fear of  
losing what he cannot use.  
</p><p>91.  How vilely has he lost himself, that becomes a Slave  
to his Servant, and exalts him to the Dignity of his Maker!  
Gold is the God, the Wife, the Friend of the Money-Monger  
of the World.  
</p><p>92.  But in Marriage do thou be wise; prefer the Person  
before Money; Vertue before Beauty, the Mind before the  
Body: Then thou hast a Wife, a Friend, a Companion, a  
Second Self; one that bears an equal Share with thee in all  
thy Toyls and Troubles.  
</p><p>93.  Chuse one that Measures her satisfaction, Safety and  
Danger, by thine; and of whom thou art sure, as of thy  
secretest Thoughts: A Friend as well as a Wife, which   
indeed a Wife implies: For she is but half a Wife that is not,  
or is not capable of being such a Friend.  
</p><p>94.  Sexes make no Difference; since in Souls there is  
none: And they are the Subjects of Friendship.  
</p><p>95.  He that minds a Body and not a Soul, has not the  
better Part of that Relation; and will consequently want the  
Noblest Comfort of a Married Life.  
</p><p>96.  The Satisfaction of our Senses is low, short, and  
transient: But the Mind gives a more raised and extended  
Pleasure, and is capable of an Happiness founded upon  
<pb n="349"/>   
Reason; not bounded and limited by  the  Circumstances  that  
Bodies are confin'd to.  
</p><p>97.  Here it is we ought to search out our Pleasure, where  
the Field is large and full of Variety, and of an induring  
Nature: Sickness, Poverty, or Disgrace, being not able to  
shake it, because it is not under the moving Influences of  
Worldly Contingencies.  
</p><p>98.  The Satisfaction of those that do so is in well-doing,  
and in the Assurance they have of a future Reward: That  
they are best loved of those they love most, and that they  
enjoy and value the Liberty of their Minds above that of  
their Bodies; having the whole Creation for their Prospect,  
the most Noble and Wonderful Works and Providences of  
God, the Histories of the Antients, and in them the Actions  
and Examples of the Vertuous; and lastly, themselves, their  
Affairs and Family, to exercise their Minds and Friendship  
upon.  
</p><p>99.   Nothing can be more entire and without Reserve;  
nothing more zealous, affectionate and sincere; nothing more  
contented and constant than such a Couple; nor no greater  
temporal Felicity than to be one of them.  
</p><p>100.  Between a Man and his Wife nothing ought to rule  
but Love.  Authority is for Children and Servants; yet not  
without Sweetness.  
</p><p>101.  As Love ought to bring them together, so it is the  
best Way to keep them well together.  
</p><p>102.   Wherefore use her not as a Servant, whom thou  
would'st, perhaps, have serv'd Seven Years to have   
obtained.  
</p><p>103.  An Husband and Wife that love and value one   
another, shew their Children and Servants, That they should do  
so too.  Others visibly lose their Authority in their Families  
by their Contempt of one another; and teach their Children  
to be unnatural by their own Example.  
</p><p>104.  It is a general Fault, not to be more careful to   
preserve Nature in Children; who, at least in the second   
Descent, hardly have the Feeling of their Relation; which must  
be an unpleasant Reflection to affectionate Parents.  
</p><p>105.  Frequent Visits, Presents, intimate Correspondence  
and Intermarriages within allowed Bounds, are Means of  
<pb n="350"/>   
keeping up the Concern and Affection that Nature requires  
from Relations.

<head>FRIENDSHIP</head>
<p>106.  Friendship is the next Pleasure we may hope for: And  
where we find it not at home, or have no home to find it in,  
we may seek it abroad.  It is an Union of Spirits, a   
Marriage of Hearts, and the Bond thereof Vertue.  
</p><p>107.  There can be no Friendship where there is no   
Freedom.  Friendship loves a free Air, and will not be penned up  
in streight and narrow Enclosures.  It will speak freely, and  
act so too; and take nothing ill where no ill is meant; nay,  
where it is, 'twill easily forgive, and forget too, upon small  
Acknowledgments.  
</p><p>108.  Friends are true Twins in Soul; they Sympathize in  
every thing, and have the Love and Aversion.  
</p><p>109.  One is not happy without the other, nor can either of  
them be miserable alone.  As if they could change Bodies,  
they take their turns in Pain as well as in Pleasure;   
relieving one another in their most adverse Conditions.  
</p><p>110.  What one enjoys, the other cannot Want.  Like the  
Primitive Christians, they have all things in common, and  
no Property but in one another.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d27">
<head>QUALITIES OF A FRIEND</head>
<p>111.  A true Friend unbosoms freely, advises justly, assists  
readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends   
courageously, and continues a Friend unchangeably.  
</p><p>112.  These being the Qualities of a Friend, we are to find  
them before we chuse one.  
</p><p>113.   The Covetous, the Angry, the Proud, the Jealous,  
the Talkative, cannot but make ill Friends, as well as the  
False.  
</p><p>114.  In short, chuse a Friend as thou dost a Wife, till  
Death separate you.  
</p><p>115.  Yet be not a Friend beyond the Altar: but let Virtue  
bound thy Friendship: Else it is not Friendship, but an Evil  
Confederacy.  
116.  If my Brother or Kinsman will be my Friend, I ought  
<pb n="351"/>   
to prefer him before a Stranger, or I shew little Duty or  
Nature to my Parents.  
</p><p>117.  And as we ought to prefer our Kindred in Point of  
Affection, so too in Point of Charity, if equally needing and  
deserving.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d28">
<head>CAUTION AND CONDUCT</head>
<p>118.  Be not easily acquainted, lest finding Reason to cool,  
thou makest an Enemy instead of a good Neighbor.  
</p><p>119.  Be Reserved, but not Sour; Grave, but not Formal;  
Bold, but not Rash; Humble, but not Servile; Patient, not  
Insensible; Constant, not Obstinate; Chearful, not Light;  
Rather Sweet than Familiar; Familiar, than Intimate; and  
Intimate with very few, and upon very good Grounds.  
</p><p>120.  Return the Civilities thou receivest, and be grateful  
for Favors.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d29">
<head>REPARATION</head>  
<p>121.  If thou hast done an Injury to another, rather own it  
than defend it.  One way thou gainest Forgiveness, the  
other, thou doubl'st the Wrong and Reckoning.  
</p><p>122.  Some oppose Honor to Submission: But it can be no  
Honor to maintain, what it is dishonorable to do.  
</p><p>123.  To confess a Fault, that is none, out of Fear, is   
indeed mean: But not to be afraid of standing in one, is  
Brutish.  
</p><p>124.  We should make more Haste to Right our Neighbor,  
than we do to wrong him, and instead of being Vindicative,  
we should leave him to be judge of his own Satisfaction.  
</p><p>125.   True Honor will pay treble Damages, rather than  
justifie one wrong with another.  
</p><p>126.  In such Controversies, it is but too common for some  
to say, Both are to blame, to excuse their own Unconcernedness,   
which is a base Neutrality.  Others will cry, They are  
both alike; thereby involving the Injured with the Guilty,  
to mince the Matter for the Faulty, or cover their own   
Injustice to the wronged Party.  
</p><p>127.  Fear and Gain are great Perverters of Mankind, and  
where either prevail, the judgment is violated.  
<pb n="352"/>   
</p><p>128.  Avoid Company where it is not profitable or   
necessary; and in those Occasions speak little, and last.  
</p><p>129.   Silence is Wisdom, where Speaking is Folly; and  
always safe.  
</p><p>130.  Some are so Foolish as to interrupt and anticipate  
those that speak, instead of hearing and thinking before they  
answer; which is uncivil as well as silly.  
</p><p>131.  If thou thinkest twice, before thou speakest once,  
thou wilt speak twice the better for it.  
</p><p>132.  Better say nothing than not to the Purpose.  And to  
speak pertinently, consider both what is fit, and when it is  
fit to speak.  
</p><p>133.  In all Debates, let Truth be thy Aim, not Victory, or  
an unjust Interest: And endeavor to gain, rather than to  
expose thy Antagonist.  
</p><p>134.  Give no Advantage in Argument, nor lose any that is  
offered.  This is a Benefit which arises from Temper.  
</p><p>135.  Don't use thy self to dispute against thine own   
judgment, to shew Wit, lest it prepare thee to be too indifferent  
about what is Right: Nor against another Man, to vex him,  
or for mere Trial of Skill; since to inform, or to be informed,  
ought to be the End of all Conferences.  
</p><p>136.  Men are too apt to be concerned for their Credit,  
more than for the Cause.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d30">
<head>ELOQUENCE</head>
<p>137.  There is a Truth and Beauty in Rhetorick; but it  
oftener serves ill Turns than good ones.  
</p><p>138.   Elegancy, is a good Meen and Address given to  
Matter, be it by proper or figurative Speech: Where the  
Words are apt, and allusions very natural, Certainly it has a  
moving Grace: But it is too artificial for Simplicity, and  
oftentimes for Truth.  The Danger is, lest it delude the  
Weak, who in such Cases may mistake the Handmaid for  
the Mistress, if not Error for Truth.  
</p><p>139.  'Tis certain Truth is least indebted to it, because she  
has least need of it, and least uses it.  
<pb n="353"/>   
</p><p>140.  But it is a reprovable Delicacy in them, that despise  
Truth in plain Cloths.  
</p><p>141.  Such Luxuriants have but false Appetites; like those  
Gluttons, that by Sawces force them, where they have no  
Stomach, and Sacrifice to their Pallate, not their Health:  
Which cannot be without great Vanity, nor That without  
some Sin.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d31">
<head>TEMPER</head>
<p>142.  Nothing does Reason more Right, than the Coolness  
of those that offer it: For Truth often suffers more by the  
Heat of its Defenders, than from the Arguments of its  
Opposers.  
</p><p>143.  Zeal ever follows an Appearance of Truth, and the  
Assured are too apt to be warm; but 't is their weak side  
in Argument; Zeal being better shewn against Sin, than  
Persons or their Mistakes.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d32">
<head>TRUTH</head>
<p>144.  Where thou art Obliged to speak, be sure speak the  
Truth: For Equivocation is half way to Lying, as Lying,  
the whole way to Hell.  
</p><p>JUSTICE<lb/>  
</p><p>145.  Believe nothing against another but upon good   
Authority: Nor report what may hurt another, unless it be a  
greater hurt to others to conceal it.  
</p><p> SECRECY<lb/>  
</p><p>146.  It is wise not to seek a Secret, and honest not to  
reveal one.  
</p><p>147.  Only trust thy self, and another shall not betray thee.  
</p><p>148.  Openness has the Mischief, though not the Malice of  
Treachery.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d33">
<head>COMPLACENCY</head>
<p>149.  Never assent merely to please others.  For that is,  
besides Flattery, oftentimes Untruth; and discovers a Mind  
liable to be servile and base: Nor contradict to vex others,  
<pb n="354"/>   
for that shows an ill Temper, and provokes, but profits no  
Body.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d34">
<head>SHIFTS</head>  
<p>150.  Do not accuse others to excuse thy self; for that is  
neither Generous nor Just.  But let Sincerity and Ingenuity  
be thy Refuge, rather than Craft and Falsehood: for   
Cunning borders very near upon Knavery.  
</p><p>151.  Wisdom never uses nor wants it.  Cunning to Wise,  
is as an Ape to a Man.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d35">
<head>INTEREST</head>
<p>152.  Interest has the Security, tho' not the Virtue of a  
Principle.  As the World goes 't is the surer side; For Men  
daily leave both Relations and Religion to follow it.  
</p><p>153.  'Tis an odd Sight, but very evident, That Families  
and Nations, of cross Religions and Humors unite against  
those of their own, where they find an Interest to do it.  
</p><p>154.  We are tied down by our Senses to this World; and  
where that is in Question, it can be none with Worldly Men,  
whether they should not forsake all other Considerations  
for it.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d36">
<head>INQUIRY</head>  
<p>155.  Have a care of Vulgar Errors.  Dislike, as well as  
Allow Reasonably.  
</p><p>156.   Inquiry is Human; Blind Obedience Brutal.  Truth  
never loses by the one, but often suffers by the other.  
</p><p>157.   The usefulest Truths are plainest: And while we  
keep to them, our Differences cannot rise high.  
</p><p>158.  There may be a Wantonness in Search, as well as a  
Stupidity in Trusting.  It is great Wisdom equally to avoid  
the Extreams.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d37">
<head>RIGHT-TIMING</head>
<p>159.  Do nothing improperly.  Some are Witty, Kind, Cold,  
Angry, Easie, Stiff, Jealous,  Careless, Cautious, Confident,  
Close, Open, but all in the wrong Place.  
</p><p>160.  It is all mistaking where the Matter is of Importance.  
<pb n="355"/>   
</p><p>161.  It is not enough that a thing be Right, if it be not fit  
to be done.  If not Imprudent, tho' just, it is not advisable.   
He that loses by getting, had better lose than get  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d38">
<head>KNOWLEDGE</head>
<p>162.    Knowledge is the Treasure, but Judgment the   
Treasurer of a Wise Man.  
</p><p>163.  He that has more Knowledge than Judgment, is made  
for another Man's use more than his own.  
</p><p>164.  It cannot be a good Constitution, where the  Appetite  
is great and the Digestion is weak.  
</p><p>165.  There are some Men like Dictionaries; to be lookt  
into upon occasions, but have no Connection, and are little  
entertaining.  
</p><p>166.  Less Knowledge than Judgment will always have the  
advantage upon the Injudicious knowing Man.  
</p><p>167.  A Wise Man makes what he learns his own, 'tother  
shows he's but a Copy, or a Collection at most.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d39">
<head>WIT</head>  
<p>168.  Wit is an happy and striking way of expressing a  
Thought.  
</p><p>169.  'Tis not often tho' it be lively and mantling, that it  
carries a great Body with it.  
</p><p>170.  Wit therefore is fitter for Diversion than Business,  
being more grateful to Fancy than judgment.  
</p><p>171.  Less Judgment than Wit, is more Sale than Ballast.  
</p><p>172.  Yet it must be confessed, that Wit gives an Edge to  
Sense, and recommends it extreamly.  
</p><p>173.  Where Judgment has Wit to express it, there's the  
best Orator.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d40">
<head>OBEDIENCE TO PARENTS</head>
<p>174.  If thou wouldest be obeyed, being a Father; being a  
Son, be Obedient.  
</p><p>175.  He that begets thee, owes thee; and has a natural  
Right over thee.  
</p><p>176.  Next to God, thy Parents; next them, the Magistrate.  
<pb n="356"/>   
</p><p>177.  Remember that thou are not more indebted to thy  
Parents for thy Nature, than for thy Love and Care.  
</p><p>178.  Rebellion therefore in Children, was made Death by  
God's Law, and the next Sin to Idolatry, in the People;  
which is renouncing of God, the Parent of all.  
</p><p>179.  Obedience to Parents is not only our Duty, but our  
Interest.  If we received our Life from them, We prolong  
it by obeying them: For Obedience is the first   
Commandment with Promise.  
</p><p>180.  The Obligation is as indissolvable as the Relation.  
</p><p>181.  If we must not disobey God to obey them; at least we  
must let them see, that there is nothing else in our refusal.   
For some unjust Commands cannot excuse the general Neglect   
of our Duty.  They will be our Parents and we must  
be their Children still: And if we cannot act for them against  
God, neither can we act against them for ourselves or anything else.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d41">
<head>BEARING</head>
<p>182.  A Man in Business must put up many Affronts, if he  
loves his own Quiet.  
</p><p>183.  We must not pretend to see all that we see, if we  
would be easie.  
</p><p>184.  It were endless to dispute upon everything that is  
disputable.  
</p><p>185.  A vindictive Temper is not only uneasie to others,  
but to them that have it.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d42">
<head>PROMISING</head>
<p>186.  Rarely Promise: But, if Lawful, constantly perform.  
</p><p>187.  Hasty Resolutions are of the Nature of Vows; and  
to be equally avoided.  
</p><p>188.  I will never do this, says one, yet does it: I am   
resolved to do this, says another; but flags upon second  
Thoughts: Or does it, tho' awkwardly, for his Word's sake:  
As if it were worse to break his Word, than to do amiss in  
keeping it.  
</p><p>189.   Wear none of thine own Chains; but keep free,  
whilst thou art free.  
</p><p>190.  It is an Effect of Passion that Wisdom corrects, to  
<pb n="357"/>   
lay thy self under Resolutions that cannot be well made, and  
must be worse performed.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d43">
<head>FIDELITY</head>  
<p>191.  Avoid all thou canst to be Entrusted: But do thy   
utmost to discharge the Trust thou undertakest: For Carelessness   
is Injurious, if not Unjust.  
</p><p>192.  The Glory of a Servant is Fidelity; which cannot be  
without Diligence, as well as Truth.  
</p><p>193.  Fidelity has Enfranchised Slaves, and Adopted   
Servants to be Sons.  
</p><p>194.  Reward a good Servant well: And rather quit than  
Disquiet thy self with an ill one.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d44">
<head>MASTER</head>
<p>195.  Mix Kindness with Authority; and rule more by   
Discretion than Rigor.  
</p><p>196.  If thy Servant be faulty, strive rather to convince  
him of his Error, than discover thy Passion: And when he  
is sensible, forgive him.  
</p><p>197.  Remember he is thy Fellow-Creature, and that God's  
Goodness, not thy Merit, has made the Difference betwixt  
Thee and Him.  
</p><p>198.  Let not thy Children Domineer over thy Servants:  
Nor suffer them to slight thy Children.  
</p><p>199.  Suppress Tales in the general: But where a Matter  
requires notice, encourage the Complaint, and right the  
Aggrieved.  
</p><p>200.  If a Child, he ought to Entreat, and not to   
Command; and if a Servant, to comply where he does not  
obey.  
</p><p>201.  Tho' there should be but one Master and Mistress in  
a Family, yet Servants should know that Children have the  
Reversion.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d45">
<head>SERVANT</head>  
<p>202.  Indulge not unseemly Things in thy Master's   
Children, nor refuse them what is fitting: For one is the highest  
<pb n="358"/>   
Unfaithfulness, and the other, Indiscretion as well as  
Disrespect.  
</p><p>203.  Do thine own Work honestly and chearfully: And  
when that is done, help thy Fellow; that so another time he  
may help thee.  
</p><p>204.  If thou wilt be a Good Servant, thou must be  
True; and thou canst not be True if thou Defraud'st thy  
Master.  
</p><p>205.  A Master may be Defrauded many ways by a servant:  
As in Time, Care, Pains, Money, Trust.  
</p><p>206.  But, a True Servant is the Contrary: He's Diligent,  
Careful, Trusty.  He Tells no Tales, Reveals no Secrets,  
Refuses no Pains: Not to be Tempted by Gain, nor aw'd by  
Fear, to Unfaithfulness.  
</p><p>207.  Such a Servant, serves God in serving his Master;  
and has double Wages for his Work, to wit, Here and  
Hereafter.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d46">
<head>JEALOUSY</head>
<p>208.  Be not fancifully jealous: For that is Foolish; as, to  
be reasonably so, is Wise.  
</p><p>209.  He that superfines up another Man's Actions, cozens  
himself, as well as injures them.  
</p><p>210.  To be very subtil and scrupulous in Business, is as  
hurtful, as being over-confident and secure.  
</p><p>211.  In difficult Cases, such a Temper is Timorous; and  
in dispatch Irresolute.  
</p><p>212.  Experience is a safe Guide: And a Practical Head,  
is a great Happiness in Business.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d47">
<head>POSTERITY</head>
<p>213.  We are too careless of Posterity; not considering  
that as they are, so the next Generation will be.  
</p><p>214.  If we would amend the World, we should mend Our  
selves; and teach our Children to be, not what we are, but  
what they should be.  
</p><p>215.  We are too apt to awaken and turn up their Passions   
by the Examples of our own; and to teach them to be  
pleased, not with what is best, but with what pleases best.  
<pb n="359"/>   
</p><p>216.  It is our Duty, and ought to be our Care, to  
ward against that Passion in them, which is more   
especially our Own Weakness and Affliction: For we are in  
great measure accountable for them, as well as for our  
selves.  
</p><p>217.  We are in this also true Turners of the World upside  
down; For Money is first, and Virtue last, and least in our  
care.  
</p><p>218.  It is not How we leave our Children, but What we  
leave them.  
</p><p>219.  To be sure Virtue is but a Supplement, and not a  
Principal in their Portion and Character: And therefore we  
see so little Wisdom or Goodness among the Rich, in   
proportion to their Wealth.

<head>A COUNTRY LIFE</head>
<p>220.  The Country Life is to be preferr'd; for there we see  
the Works of God; but in Cities little else but the Works of  
Men: And the one makes a better Subject for our Contemplation   
than the other.  
</p><p>221.  As Puppets are to Men, and 
Babies<ref target="PenSoln8">8</ref>  to Children, so  
is Man's Workmanship to God's: We are the Picture, he the  
Reality.  
</p><p>222.  God's Works declare his Power, Wisdom and   
Goodness; but Man's Works, for the most part, his Pride, Folly  
and Excess.  The one is for use, the other, chiefly,  for  
Ostentation and Lust.  
</p><p>223.  The Country is both the Philosopher's Garden and  
his Library, in which he Reads and Contemplates the Power,  
Wisdom and Goodness of God.  
</p><p>224.  It is his Food as well as Study; and gives him Life,  
as well as Learning.  
</p><p>225.  A Sweet and Natural Retreat from Noise and Talk,  
and allows opportunity for Reflection, and gives the best  
Subjects for it.  
</p><p>226.  In short, 't is an Original, and the Knowledge and  
Improvement of it, Man's oldest Business and Trade, and  
the best he can be of.

<head>ART AND PROJECT</head> 
<p>227.  Art, is Good, where it is beneficial.  Socrates wisely  
bounded his Knowledge and Instruction by Practice.  
</p><p>228.  Have a care therefore of Projects: And yet despise  
nothing rashly, or in the Lump.  
</p><p>229.  Ingenuity, as well as Religion, sometimes suffers   
between two Thieves; Pretenders and Despisers.  
</p><p>230.  Though injudicious and dishonest Projectors often  
discredit Art, yet the most useful and extraordinary   
Inventions have not, at first, escap'd the Scorn of Ignorance; as  
their Authors, rarely, have cracking of their Heads, or  
breaking their backs.  
</p><p>231.  Undertake no Experiment, in Speculation, that   
appears not true in Art; nor then, at thine own Cost, if costly  
or hazardous in making.  
</p><p>232.  As many Hands make light Work, so several Purses  
make cheap Experiments.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d50">
<head>INDUSTRY</head>  
<p>233.  Industry, is certainly very commendable, and supplies  
the want of Parts.  
</p><p>234.  Patience and Diligence, like Faith, remove Mountains.  
</p><p>235.  Never give out while there is Hope; but hope not  
beyond Reason, for that shews more Desire than Judgment.  
</p><p>236.  It is a profitable Wisdom to know when we have  
done enough: Much Time and Pains are spared, in not  
flattering our selves against Probabilities.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d51">
<head>TEMPORAL HAPPINESS</head>
<p>237.  Do Good with what thou hast, or it will do thee  
no good.  
</p><p>238.  Seek not to be Rich, but Happy.  The one lies in  
Bags, the other in Content: which Wealth can never give.  
</p><p>239.  We are apt to call things by wrong Names.  We will  
have Prosperity to be Happiness, and Adversity to be  
Misery; though that is the School of Wisdom, and oftentimes  
the way to Eternal Happiness.  
<pb n="361"/>   
</p><p>240.  If thou wouldest be Happy, bring thy Mind to thy  
Condition, and have an Indifferency for more than what is  
sufficient.  
</p><p>241.  Have but little to do, and do it thy self: And do to  
others as thou wouldest have them do to thee: So, thou  
canst not fail of Temporal Felicity.  
</p><p>242.  The generality are the worse for their Plenty: The  
Voluptuous consumes it, the Miser hides it: 'Tis the good  
Man that uses it, and to good Purposes.  But such are hardly  
found among the Prosperous.  
</p><p>243.  Be rather Bountiful, than Expensive.  
</p><p>244.  Neither make nor go to Feasts, but let the laborious  
Poor bless thee at Home in their Solitary Cottages.  
</p><p>245.  Never voluntarily want what thou hast in Possession;  
nor sospend it as to involve thyself in want unavoidable.  
</p><p>246.  Be not tempted to presume by Success: For many  
that have got largely, have lost all, by coveting to get more.  
</p><p>247.  To hazard much to get much, has more of Avarice  
than Wisdom.  
</p><p>248.  It is great Prudence both to Bound and Use Prosperity.  
</p><p>249.  Too few know when they have Enough; and fewer  
know how to employ it.  
</p><p>250.  It is equally adviseable not to part lightly with what  
is hardly gotten, and not to shut up closely what flows in  
freely.  
</p><p>251.  Act not the Shark upon thy Neighbors; nor take   
Advantage of the Ignorance, Prodigality or Necessity of any  
one: For that is next door to Fraud, and, at best, makes but  
an Unblest Gain.  
</p><p>252.  It is oftentimes the judgment of God upon Greedy  
Rich Men, that he suffers them to push on their Desires of  
Wealth to the Excess of over-reaching, grinding or   
oppression, which poisons all the rest they have gotten: So  
that it commonly runs away as fast, and by as bad ways as  
it was heap'd up together.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d52">
<head>RESPECT</head>
<p>253.  Never esteem any Man, or thy self, the more for  
Money; nor think the meaner of thy self or another for want  
of it: Vertue being the just Reason of respecting, and the  
want of it, of slighting any one.  
<pb n="362"/>   
</p><p>255.  He that prefers him upon other accounts, bows to an  
Idol.  
</p><p>256.  Unless Virtue guide us, our Choice must be wrong.  
</p><p>257.  An able bad Man, is an ill Instrument, and to be  
shunned as the Plague.  
</p><p>258.  Be not deceived with the first appearances of things,  
but give thy self Time to be in the right.  
</p><p>259.  Show, is not Substance: Realities Govern Wise Men.  
</p><p>260.  Have a Care therefore where there is more Sail than  
Ballast.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d53">
<head>HAZARD</head>
<p>261.  In all Business it Is best to put nothing to hazard:  
But where it is unavoidable, be not rash, but firm and  
resign'd.  
</p><p>262.  We should not be troubled for what we cannot help:  
But if it was our Fault, let it be so no more.  Amendment  
is Repentance, if not Reparation.  
</p><p>263.   As a Desperate Game needs an able Gamester, so  
Consideration often would prevent, what the best skill in the  
World Cannot Recover.  
</p><p>264.  Where the Probability of Advantage exceeds not that  
of Loss, Wisdom never Adventures.  
</p><p>265.  To Shoot well Flying is well; but to Chose it, has  
more of Vanity than judgment.  
</p><p>266.  To be Dextrous in Danger is a Virtue; but to Court  
Danger to show it, is Weakness.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d54">
<head>DETRACTION</head>
<p>267.  Have a care of that base Evil Detraction.  It is the  
Fruit of Envy, as that is of Pride; the immediate Offspring  
of the Devil: Who, of an Angel, a Lucifer, a Son of the  
Morning, made himself a Serpent, a Devil, a Beelzebub, and  
all that is obnoxious to the Eternal Goodness.  
</p><p>268.  Vertue is not secure against Envy.  Men will Lessen  
what they won't Imitate.  
<pb n="363"/>   
</p><p>269.  Dislike what deserves it, but never Hate: For that is  
of the Nature of Malice; which is almost ever to Persons,  
not Things, and is one of the blackest Qualities Sin begets  
in the Soul.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d55">
<head>MODERATION</head>
<p>270.  It were an happy Day if Men could bound and  
qualifie their Resentments with Charity to the Offender:  
For then our Anger would be without Sin, and better  
convict and edifie the Guilty; which alone can make it  
lawful.  
</p><p>271.  Not to be provok'd is best: But if mov'd, never   
correct till the Fume is spent; For every Stroke our Fury  
strikes, is sure to hit our selves at last.  
</p><p>272.  If we did but observe the Allowances our Reason  
makes upon Reflection, when our Passion is over, we could  
not want a Rule how to behave our selves again in the like  
Occasions.  
</p><p>273.  We are more prone to Complain than Redress, and  
to Censure than Excuse.  
</p><p>274.  It is next to unpardonable, that we can so often Blame  
what we will not once mend.  It shews, we know, but will  
not do our Master's Will.  
</p><p>275.  They, that censure, should Practice: Or else let them  
have the first stone, and the last too.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d56">
<head>TRICK</head>
<p>276.  Nothing needs a Trick but a Trick; Sincerity loathes  
one.  
</p><p>277.  We must take care to do Right Things Rightly: For  
a just Sentence may be unjustly executed.  
</p><p>278.  Circumstances give great Light to true Judgment, if  
well weigh'd.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d57">
<head>PASSION</head>
<p>279.  Passion is a sort of Fever in the Mind, which ever  
leaves us weaker than it found us.  
</p><p>280.  But being, intermitting to be sure, 't is curable  
with care.  
<pb n="364"/>   
</p><p>281.  It more than any thing deprives us of the use of  
our Judgment; for it raises a Dust very hard to see through.  
</p><p>282.   Like Wine, whose Lees fly by being jogg'd, it is too  
muddy to Drink.  
</p><p>283.  It may not unfitly be termed, the Mob of the Man,  
that commits a Riot upon his Reason.  
</p><p>284.  I have sometimes thought, that a Passionate Man is  
like a weak Spring that cannot stand long lock'd.  
</p><p>285.  And as true, that those things are unfit for use, that  
can't bear small Knocks, without breaking.  
</p><p>286.  He that won't hear can't Judge, and he that can't  
bear Contradiction, may, with all his Wit, miss the Mark.  
</p><p>287.  Objection and Debate Sift out Truth, which needs  
Temper as well as Judgment.  
</p><p>288.  But above all, observe it in Resentments, for their  
Passion is most Extravagant.  
</p><p>289.  Never chide for Anger, but Instruction.  
</p><p>290.   He that corrects out of Passion, raises Revenge  
sooner than Repentance.  
</p><p>291.   It has more of Wantonness than Wisdom, and   
resembles those that Eat to please their Pallate, rather than  
their Appetite.  
</p><p>292.  It is the difference between a Wise and a Weak  
Man; This judges by the Lump, that by Parts and their  
Connection.  
</p><p>293.  The Greeks use to say, all Cases are governed by  
their Circumstances.  The same thing may be well and ill  
as they change or vary the Matter.  
</p><p>294.  A Man's Strength is shewn by his Bearing.  <hi rend="italic">Bonum

<head>PERSONAL CAUTIONS</head>
<p>295.  Reflect without Malice but never without Need.  
</p><p>296.  Despise no Body, nor no Condition; lest it come to  
be thine own.  
</p><p>297.  Never Rail nor Taunt.  The one is Rude, the other  
Scornful, and both Evil.  
</p><p>298.  Be not provoked by Injuries, to commit them.

</p><p>302.   Have a care of presuming upon After-Games:  
<ref target="PenSon10">10</ref> For if that miss, all is gone.  
</p><p>303.  Opportunities should never be lost, because they can  
hardly be regained.  
</p><p>304.  It is well to cure, but better to prevent a Distemper.   
The first shows more Skill, but the last more Wisdom.  
</p><p>305.  Never make a Tryal of Skill in difficult or hazardous  
Cases.  
</p><p>306.  Refuse not to be informed: For that shews Pride or  
Stupidity.  
</p><p>307.   Humility and Knowledge in poor Cloaths, excel  
Pride and Ignorance in costly attire.

<head>BALLANCE</head>
<p>309.  We must not be concern'd above the Value of the  
thing that engages us; nor raised above Reason, in   
maintaining what we think reasonable.  
</p><p>31O.It is too common an Error, to invert the Order of  
Things; by making an End of that which is a Means, and  
a Means of that which is an End.  
</p><p>311.   Religion and Government escape not this Mischief:  
The first is too often made a Means instead of an End; the  
other an End instead of a Means.  
</p><p>312.  Thus Men seek Wealth rather than Subsistence; and  
the End of Cloaths is the least Reason of their Use.  Nor is  
the satisfying of our Appetite our End in Eating, so much  
as the pleasing of our Pallate.  The like may also be said  
of Building, Furniture, &amp;c. where the Man rules not the  
Beast, and Appetite submits not to Reason.  
</p><p>313.  It is great Wisdom to proportion our Esteem to the  
Nature of the Thing: For as that way things will not he  
undervalued, so neither will they engage as above their  
intrinsick worth.  
</p><p>314.  If we suffer little Things to have great hold upon us,  
<pb n="366"/>   
we shall be as much transported for them, as if they  
deserv'd it.  
</p><p>315.  It is an old Proverb, <hi rend="italic">Maxima bella ex levissimus  
causis</hi>: The greatest Feuds have had the smallest Beginnings.  
</p><p>316.  No matter what the Subject of the Dispute be, but  
what place we give it in our Minds: For that governs our  
Concern and Resentment.  
</p><p>317.  It is one of the fatalest Errors of our Lives, when we  
spoil a good Cause by an ill Management: And it is not   
impossible but we may mean well in an ill Business; but that  
will not defend it.  
</p><p>318.  If we are but sure the End is Right, we are too apt  
to gallop over all Bounds to compass it; not considering  
that lawful Ends may be very unlawfully attained.  
</p><p>319.  Let us be careful to take just ways to compass just  
Things; that they may last in their Benefits to us.  
</p><p>320.  There is a troublesome Humor some Men have, that  
if they may not lead, they will not follow; but had rather  
a thing were never done, than not done their own way, tho'  
other ways very desirable.  
</p><p>321.  This comes of an over-fulness of our selves; and  
shows we are more concern'd for Praise, than the Success  
of what we think a good Thing.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d60">
<head>POPULARITY</head>
<p>322.  Affect not to be seen, and Men will less see thy  
Weakness.  
</p><p>323.  They that shew more than they are, raise an   
Expectation they cannot answer; and so lose their Credit, as  
soon as they are found out.  
</p><p>324.  Avoid Popularity.  It has many Snares, and no real  
Benefit to thy self; and Uncertainty to others.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d61">
<head>PRIVACY</head>
<p>325.  Remember the Proverb, <hi rend="italic">Bene qui latuit, bent vixit</hi>.    
They are happy that live Retiredly.  
</p><p>326.  If this be true, Princes and their Grandees, of all  
Men, are the unhappiest: For they live least alone: And  
<pb n="367"/>   
they that must be enjoyed by every Body, can never enjoy  
themselves as they should.  
</p><p>327.  It is the Advantage little Men have upon them; they  
can be Private, and have leisure for Family Comforts, which  
are the greatest worldly Contents Men can enjoy.   
</p><p>328.  But they that place Pleasure in Greediness, seek it  
there: And we see Rule is as much the Ambition of some  
Natures, as Privacy is the Choice of others.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d62">
<head>GOVERNMENT</head>
<p>329.  Government has many Shapes: But 't is Sovereignty,  
tho' not Freedom, in all of them.  
</p><p>330.  <hi rend="italic">Rex &amp; Tyrannus</hi> are very different Characters: One  
Rules his People by Laws, to which they consent; the other  
by his absolute Will and Power.  That is call'd Freedom,  
This Tyranny.  
</p><p>331.  The first is endanger'd by the Ambition of the   
Popular, which shakes the Constitution: The other by an ill  
Administration, which hazards the Tyrant and his Family.  
</p><p>332.  It is great Wisdom in Princes of both sorts, not to  
strain Points too high with their People: For whether the  
People have a Right to oppose them or not, they are ever  
sure to attempt it, when things are carried too far; though  
the Remedy oftentimes proves worse than the Disease.  
</p><p>333.  Happy that King who is great by Justice, and that  
People who are free by Obedience.  
</p><p>334.  Where the Ruler is Just, he may be strict; else it is  
two to one it turns upon him: And tho' he should prevail,  
he can be no Gainer, where his People are the Losers.  
</p><p>335.  Princes must not have Passions in Government, nor  
Resent beyond Interest and Religion.  
</p><p>336.  Where Example keeps pace with Authority, Power  
hardly fails to be obey'd, and Magistrates to be honored.  
</p><p>337.  Let the People think they Govern and they will be  
Govern'd.  
</p><p>338.  This cannot fail, if Those they Trust, are Trusted.  
</p><p>339.  That Prince that is Just to them in great things, and  
Humors them sometimes in small ones, is sure to have and  
keep them from all the World.  
<pb n="368"/>   
</p><p>340.  For the People is the Politick Wife of the Prince, that  
may be better managed by Wisdom, than ruled by Force.  
</p><p>341.  But where the Magistrate is partial and serves ill  
turns, he loses his Authority with the People; and gives the  
Populace opportunity to gratifie their Ambition: And to lay  
a Stumbling-block for his People to fall.  
</p><p>342.  It is true, that where a Subject is more Popular than  
the Prince, the Prince is in Danger: But it is as true, that  
it is his own Fault: For no Body has the like Means, Interest  
or Reason, to be popular as He.  
</p><p>343.  It is an unaccountable thing, that some Princes   
incline rather to be fear'd than lov'd; when they see, that  
Fear does not oftener secure a Prince against the   
Dissatisfaction of his People, than Love makes a Subject too many  
for such a Prince.  
</p><p>344.  Certainly Service upon Inclination is like to go  
farther than Obedience upon Compulsion.  
</p><p>345.  The Romans had a just Sense of this, when they  
plac'd Optimus before Maximus, to their most Illustrious  
Captains and Cesars.  
</p><p>346.  Besides, Experience tells us, That Goodness raises a  
nobler Passion in the Soul, and gives a better Sense of  
Duty than Severity.  
</p><p>347.  What did Pharaoh get by increasing the Israelites  
Task? Ruine to himself in the End.  
</p><p>348.  Kings, chiefly in this, should imitate God: Their  
Mercy should be above all their Works.  
</p><p>349.  The Difference between the Prince and the Peasant,  
is in this World: But a Temper ought to be observ'd by him  
that has the Advantage here, because of the Judgment in  
the next.  
</p><p>350.  The End of every thing should direct the Means:  
Now that of Government being the Good of the whole,  
nothing less should be the Aim of the Prince.  
</p><p>351.  As often as Rulers endeavor to attain just Ends by  
just Mediums, they are sure of a quiet and easy Government;  
and as sure of Convulsions, where the Nature of things are  
violated, and their Order overrul'd.  
</p><p>352.  It is certain, Princes ought to have great Allowances  
made them for Faults in Government; since they see by other  
<pb n="369"/>   
People's Eyes, and hear by their Ears.  But Ministers of  
State, their immediate Confidants and Instruments, have  
much to answer for, if to gratifie private Passions, they   
misguide the Prince to do publick Injury.  
</p><p>353.  Ministers of State should undertake their Posts at  
their Peril.  If Princes overrule them, let them shew the  
Law, and humbly resign: If Fear, Gain or Flattery prevail,  
let them answer it to the Law.  
</p><p>354.  The Prince cannot be preserv'd, but where the   
Minister is punishable: For People, as well as Princes, will not  
endure <hi rend="italic">Imperium in Imperio</hi>.<ref target="PolSon11">11</ref>
</p><p>355.  If Ministers are weak or ill Men, and so spoil their  
Places, it is the Prince's Fault that chose them: But if their  
Places spoil them, it is their own Fault to be made worse  
by them.  
</p><p>356.  It is but just that those that reign by their Princes,  
should suffer for their Princes: For it is a safe and   
necessary Maxim, not to shift Heads in Government, while the  
Hands are in being that should answer for them.  
</p><p>357.  And yet it were intolerable to be a Minister of State,  
if every Body may be Accuser and judge.  
</p><p>358.  Let therefore the false Accuser no more escape an  
exemplary Punishment, than the Guilty Minister.  
</p><p>359.  For it profanes Government to have the Credit of  
the leading Men in it, subject to vulgar Censure; which is  
often ill grounded.  
</p><p>360.  The Safety of a Prince, therefore consists in a well-chosen Council: And that only can be said to be so, where  
the Persons that compose it are qualified for the Business  
that comes before them.  
</p><p>361.  Who would send to a Taylor to make a Lock, or to  
a Smith to make a Suit of Cloaths?  
</p><p>362.  Let there be Merchants for Trade, Seamen for the  
Admiralty, Travellers for Foreign Affairs, some of the   
Leading Men of the Country for Home-Business, and Common  
and Civil Lawyers to advise of Legality and Right: Who  
should always keep to the strict Rules of Law.  
</p><p>363.  Three Things contribute much to ruin Governments;  
Looseness, Oppression and Envy.  
<pb n="370"/>   
</p><p>364.  Where the Reins of Government are too slack, there  
the Manners of the People are corrupted: And that destroys  
Industry, begets Effeminacy, and provokes Heaven against it.  
</p><p>365.  Oppression makes a Poor Country, and a Desperate  
People, who always wait an Opportunity to change.  
</p><p>366.  He that ruleth over Men, must be just, ruling in the  
Fear of God, said an old and a wise King.  
</p><p>367.  Envy disturbs and distracts Government, clogs the  
Wheels, and perplexes the Administration: And nothing  
contributes more to the Disorder, than a partial distribution  
of Rewards, and Punishments in the Sovereign.  
</p><p>368.  As it is not reasonable that Men should he compell'd  
to serve; so those that have Employments should not be  
endured to leave them humorously.  
</p><p>369.  Where the State intends a Man no Affront, he should

<div2 type="section" id="d63">
<head>A PRIVATE LIFE</head>
<p>370.  Private Life is to be preferr'd; the Honor and Gain  
of publick Posts, bearing no proportion with the Comfort  
of it.  The one is free and quiet, the other servile and noisy.  
</p><p>371.  It was a great Answer of the Shunamite Woman,  
I dwell among my own People.  
</p><p>372.  They that live of their own, neither need, nor often  
list to wear the Livery of the Publick.  
</p><p>373.  Their Subsistance is not during Pleasure; nor have  
they patrons to please or present.  
</p><p>374.  If they are not advanced, neither can they be,   
disgraced.  And as they know not the Smiles of Majesty, so  
they feel not the Frowns of Greatness; or th Effects of  
Envy.  
</p><p>375.  If they want the Pleasures of a Court, they also  
escape the Temptations of it.  
</p><p>376.  Private Men, in fine, are so much their own, that  
paying common Dues, they are Sovereigns of all the rest.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d64">
<head>A PUBLICK LIFE</head>
<p>377.  Yet the Publick must and will be served; and they  
that do it well, deserve publick Marks of honor and Profit.  
<pb n="371"/>   
</p><p>378.  To do so, Men must have publick Minds, as well  
as Salaries; or they will serve private Ends at the Publick  
Cost.  
</p><p>379.   Governments can never be well administered, but  
where those entrusted make Conscience of well discharging  
their Place.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d65">
<head>QUALIFICATIONS</head>
<p>380.  Five Things are requisite to a good Officer; Ability,  
Clean Hands, Dispatch, Patience and Impartiality.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d66">
<head>CAPACITY</head>
<p>381.  He that understands not his Employment, whatever  
else he knows, must be unfit for it, and the Publick suffers  
by his Inexpertness.  
</p><p>382.  They that are able, should be just too; or the   
Government may be the worse for their Capacity.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d67">
<head>CLEAN HANDS</head>
<p>383.  Covetousness in such Men prompts them to   
prostitute the Publick for Gain.  
</p><p>384.  The taking of a Bribe or Gratuity, should be   
punished with as severe Penalties, as the defrauding of the  
State.  
</p><p>385.  Let Men have sufficient Salaries, and exceed them  
at their Peril.  
</p><p>386.  It is a Dishonor to Government, that its Officers  
should live of Benevolence; as it ought to be Infamous  
for Officers to dishonor the Publick, by being twice paid  
for the same Business.  
</p><p>387.  But to be paid, and not to do Business, is rank  
Oppression.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d68">
<head>DISPATCH</head>
<p>388.  Dispatch is a great and good Quality in an Officer  
where Duty, not Gain, excites it.  But of this, too many  
make their private Market and Over-plus to their Wages  
Thus the Salary is for doing, and the Bribe, for dispatching  
<pb n="372"/>   
the Business: As if Business  could be done before it were  
dispatched: Or what ought to be done, ought not to be   
dispatch'd: Or they were to be  paid apart, one by the   
Government, t'other by the Party.  
</p><p>389.  Dispatch is as much the Duty of an Officer, as  
doing; and very much the Honor of the Government he  
serves.  
</p><p>390.  Delays have been more injurious than direct  
Injustice.  
</p><p>391.  They too often starve those they dare not deny.  
</p><p>392.  The very Winner is made a Loser, because he pays  
twice for his own; like those that purchase Estates   
Mortgaged before to the full Value.  
</p><p>393.  Our Law says well, to delay Justice is Injustice.  
</p><p>394.  Not to have a Right, and not to come at it, differs  
little.  
</p><p>395.  Refuse or Dispatch is the Duty and Wisdom of a  
good Officer.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d69">
<head>PATIENCE</head>
<p>396.  Patience is a Virtue every where; but it shines with  
great Lustre in the Men of Government.  
</p><p>397.  Some are so Proud or Testy, they won't hear what  
they should redress.  
</p><p>398.  Others so weak, they sink or burst under the weight  
of their Office, though they can lightly run away with the  
Salary of it.  
</p><p>399.  Business can never be well done, that is not well  
understood: Which cannot be without Patience.  
</p><p>400.  It is Cruelty indeed not to give the Unhappy an  
Hearing, whom we ought to help: But it is the top of  
Oppression to Browbeat the humble and modest Miserable,  
when they seek Relief.  
</p><p>401.  Some, it is true, are unreasonable in their Desires  
and Hopes: But then we should inform, not rail at and  
reject them.  
</p><p>402.  It is therefore as great an Instance of Wisdom as a  
Man in Business can give, to be Patient under the   
Impertinencies and Contradictions that attend it.  
</p><p>403.  Method goes far to prevent Trouble in Business: For  
<pb n="373"/>   
it makes the Task easy, hinders Confusion, saves abundance  
of Time, and instructs those that have Business depending,  
both what to do and what to hope.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d70">
<head>IMPARTIALITY</head>
<p>404.  Impartiality, though it be the last, is not the least  
Part  
of the Character of a good Magistrate.  
</p><p>405.  It is noted as a Fault, in Holy Writ, even to regard  
the Poor: How much more the Rich in judgment?  
</p><p>406.  If our Compassions must not sway us; less should  
our Fears, Profits or Prejudices.  
</p><p>407.  Justice is justly represented Blind, because she sees  
no Difference in the Parties concerned.  
</p><p>408.  She has but one Scale and Weight, for Rich and  
Poor, Great and Small.  
</p><p>409.  Her Sentence is not guided by the Person, but the  
Cause.  
</p><p>410.  The Impartial Judge in Judgment, knows nothing  
but the Law: The Prince no more than the Peasant, his  
Kindred than a Stranger.  Nay, his Enemy is sure to be  
upon equal Terms with his Friend, when he is upon the  
Bench.  
</p><p>411.  Impartiality is the Life of Justice, as that is of  
Government.  
</p><p>412.  Nor is it only a Benefit to the State, for private  
Families cannot subsist comfortably without it.  
</p><p>413.  Parents that are partial, are ill obeyed by their  
Children; and partial Masters not better served by their  
Servants.  
</p><p>414.  Partiality is always Indirect, if not Dishonest: For   
it  
shews a Byass where Reason would have none; if not an  
Injury, which Justice every where forbids.  
</p><p>415.  As it makes Favorites without Reason, so it uses no  
Reason in judging of Actions: Confirming the Proverb, The  
Crow thinks her own Bird the fairest.  
</p><p>416.  What some see to be no Fault in one, they will have  
Criminal in another.  
</p><p>417.  Nay, how ugly do our own Failings look to us in  
the Persons of others, which yet we see not in our selves.  
<pb n="374"/>   
</p><p>418.  And but too common it is for some People, not to  
know their own Maxims and Principles in the Mouths of  
other Men, when they give occasion to use them.  
</p><p>419.  Partiality corrupts our judgment of Persons and  
Things, of our selves and others.  
</p><p>420.  It contributes more than any thing to Factions in  
Government, and Fewds in Families.  
</p><p>421.  It is prodigal Passion, that seldom returns 'till it is  
Hunger-bit, and Disappointments bring it within bounds.  
</p><p>422.  And yet we may be indifferent, to a Fault.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d71">
<head>INDIFFERENCY</head>
<p>423.  Indifference is good in Judgment, but bad in Relation,  
and stark nought in Religion.  
</p><p>424.  And even in judgment, our Indifferency must be to  
the Persons, not Causes: For one, to be sure, is right  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d72">
<head>NEUTRALITY</head>
<p>425.  Neutrality is something else than Indifferency; and  
yet of kin to it too.  
</p><p>426.  A judge ought to be Indifferent, and yet he cannot  
be said to be Neutral.  
</p><p>427.  The one being to be Even in judgment, and the other  
not to meddle at all.  
</p><p>428.  And where it is Lawful, to be sure, it is best to be  
Neutral.  
</p><p>429.  He that espouses Parties, can hardly divorce himself  
from their Fate; and more fall with their Party than rise  
with it.  
</p><p>430.  A wise Neuter joins with neither; but uses both, as  
his honest Interest leads him.  
</p><p>431.  A Neuter only has room to be a Peace-maker: For  
being of neither side, he has the Means of mediating a  
Reconciliation of both.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d73">
<head>A PARTY</head>  
<p>432.  And yet, where Right or Religion gives a Call, a  
Neuter must be a Coward or an Hypocrite.  
<pb n="375"/>   
</p><p>433.  In such Cases we should never be backward: nor yet  
mistaken.  
</p><p>434.  When our Right or Religion is in question, then is  
the fittest time to assert it.  
</p><p>435.  Nor must we always be Neutral where our   
Neighbors are concerned: For tho' Medling is a Fault, Helping is  
a Duty.  
</p><p>436.  We have a Call to do good, as often as we have the  
Power and Occasion.  
</p><p>437.  If Heathens could say, We are not born for our  
selves; surely Christians should practise it.  
</p><p>438.  They are taught so by his Example, as well as  
Doctrine, from whom they have borrowed their Name.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d74">
<head>OSTENTATION</head>
<p>439.  Do what good thou canst unknown; and be not vain  
of what ought rather to be felt, than seen.  
</p><p>440.  The Humble, in the Parable of the Day of   
Judgment, forgot their good Works; Lord, when did we do so  
and so?  
</p><p>441.  He that does Good, for Good's sake, seeks neither  
Praise nor Reward; tho' sure of both at last.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d75">
<head>COMPLEAT VIRTUE</head>
<p>442.  Content not thy self that thou art Virtuous in the  
general: For one Link being wanting, the Chain is defective.  
</p><p>443.  Perhaps thou art rather Innocent than Virtuous, and  
owest more to thy Constitution, than thy Religion.  
</p><p>444.  Innocent, is not to be Guilty: But Virtuous is to overcome  
our evil Inclinations.  
</p><p>445.  If thou hast not conquerd thy self in that which is  
thy own particular Weakness, thou hast no Title to Virtue,  
tho' thou art free of other Men's.  
</p><p>446.  For a Covetous Man to inveigh against Prodigality,  
an Atheist against Idolatry, a Tyrant against Rebellion, or  
a Lyer against Forgery, and a Drunkard against   
Intemperance, is for the Pot to call the Kettle black.  
</p><p>447.  Such Reproof would have but little Success; because  
it would carry but little Authority with it.  
<pb n="376"/>   
</p><p>448.  If thou wouldest conquer thy Weakness, thou must  
never gratify it.  
</p><p>449.  No Man is compelled to Evil; his Consent only makes  
it his.  
</p><p>450.  'Tis no Sin to be tempted, but to be overcome.  
</p><p>451.  What Man in his right Mind, would conspire his own  
hurt? Men are beside themselves, when they transgress  
their Convictions.  
</p><p>452.  If thou would'st not Sin, don't Desire; and if thou  
would'st not Lust, don't Embrace the Temptation: No, not  
look at it, nor think of it.  
</p><p>453.  Thou would'st take much Pains to save thy Body:  
Take some, prithee, to save thy Soul.  
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" id="d76">
<head>RELIGION</head>
<p>454.  Religion is the Fear of God, and its Demonstration  
on good Works; and Faith is the Root of both: For without  
Faith we cannot please God, nor can we fear what we do  
not believe.  
</p><p>455.  The Devils also believe and know abundance: But in  
this is the Difference, their Faith works not by Love, nor  
their Knowledge by Obedience; and therefore they are never  
the better for them.  And if ours be such, we shall be of  
their Church, not of Christ's: For as the Head is, so must  
the Body be.  
</p><p>456.  He was Holy, Humble, Harmless, Meek, Merciful,  
&amp;c. when among us; to teach us what we should be, when he  
was gone.  And yet he is among us still, and in us too, a  
living and perpetual Preacher of the same Grace, by his  
Spirit in our Consciences.  
</p><p>457.  A Minister of the Gospel ought to be one of Christ's  
making, if he would pass for one of Christ's Ministers.  
</p><p>458.  And if he be one of his making, he Knows and Does  
as well as Believes.  
</p><p>459.  That Minister whose Life is not the Model of his  
Doctrine, is a Babler rather than a Preacher; a Quack rather  
than a Physician of Value.  
</p><p>460.  Of old Time they were made Ministers by the Holy  
Ghost: And the more that is an Ingredient now, the fitter  
they are for that Work.  
<pb n="377"/>   
</p><p>461.  Running Streams are not so apt to corrupt; nor  
Itinerant, as settled Preachers: But they are not to run   
before they are sent.  
</p><p>462.  As they freely receive from Christ, so they give.  
</p><p>463.  They will not make that a Trade, which they know  
ought not, in Conscience, to be one.  
</p><p>464.  Yet there is no fear of their Living that design not  
to live by it.  
</p><p>465.  The humble and true Teacher meets with more than  
he expects.  
</p><p>466.  He accounts Content with Godliness great Gain, and  
therefore seeks not to make a Gain of Godliness.  
</p><p>467.  As the Ministers of Christ are made by him, and are  
like him, so they beget People into the same Likeness.  
</p><p>468.  To be like Christ then, is to be a Christian.  And  
Regeneration is the only way to the Kingdom of God, which  
we pray for.  
</p><p>469.  Let us to Day, therefore, hear his Voice, and not  
harden our Hearts; who speaks to us many ways.  In the  
Scriptures, in our Hearts, by his Servants and his   
Providences: And the Sum of all is HOLINESS and CHARITY.  
</p><p>470.  St. James gives a short Draught of this Matter, but  
very full and reaching, Pure Religion and undefiled before  
God the Father, is this, to visit the Fatherless and the  
Widows in their Affliction, and to keep our selves unspotted  
from the World.  Which is compriz'd in these Two Words,  
CHARITY and PIETY.  
</p><p>471.  They that truly make these their Aim, will find them  
their Attainment; and with them, the Peace that follows so  
excellent a Condition.  
</p><p>472.  Amuse not thy self therefore with the numerous  
Opinions of the World, nor value thy self upon verbal  
Orthodoxy, Philosophy, or thy Skill in Tongues, or   
Knowledge of the Fathers: (too much the Business and Vanity of  
the World).  But in this rejoyce, That thou knowest God,  
that is the Lord, who exerciseth loving Kindness, and   
Judgment, and Righteousness in the Earth.  
</p><p>473.  Publick Worship is very commendable, if well   
performed.  We owe it to God and good Example.  But we  
must know, that God is not tyed to Time or Place, who is  
<pb n="378"/>   
every where at the same Time: And this we shall know, as  
far as we are capable, if where ever we are, our Desires are  
to be with him.  
</p><p>474.  Serving God, People generally confine to the Acts of  
Publick and Private Worship: And those, the more zealous  
do oftener repeat, in hopes of Acceptance.  
</p><p>475.  But if we consider that God is an Infinite Spirit, and,  
as such, every where; and that our Saviour has taught us,  
That he will be worshipped in Spirit and in Truth; we shall  
see the shortness of such a Notion.  
</p><p>476.  For serving God concerns the Frame of our Spirits,  
in the whole Course of our Lives; in every Occasion we  
have, in which we may shew our Love to his Law.  
</p><p>477.  For as Men in Battle are continually in the way of  
shot, so we, in this World, are ever within the Reach of  
Temptation.  And herein do we serve God, if we avoid what  
we are forbid, as well as do what he commands.  
</p><p>478.  God is better served in resisting a Temptation to Evil,  
than in many formal Prayers.  
</p><p>479.   This is but Twice or Thrice a Day; but That  
every Hour and Moment of the Day.  So much more is  
our continual Watch, than our Evening and Morning  
Devotion.  
</p><p>480.  Wouldst thou then serve God? Do not that alone,  
which thou wouldest not that another should see thee do.  
</p><p>481.  Don't take God's Name in vain, or disobey thy   
Parents, or wrong thy Neighbor, or commit Adultery even in  
thine Heart.  
</p><p>482.  Neither be vain, Lascivious, Proud, Drunken,   
Revengeful or Angry: Nor Lye, Detract, Backbite, Overreach,  
Oppress, Deceive or Betray: But watch vigorously against  
all Temptations to these Things; as knowing that God is  
present, the Overseer of all thy Ways and most inward  
Thoughts, and the Avenger of his own Law upon the   
Disobedient, and thou wilt acceptably serve God.  
</p><p>483.  Is it not reason, if we expect the Acknowledgments  
of those to whom we are bountiful, that we should   
reverently pay ours to God, our most magnificent and constant  
Benefactor?  
</p><p>484.  The World represents a Rare and Sumptuous Palace,  
<pb n="379"/>   
Mankind the great Family in it, and God the mighty Lord  
and Master of it.  
</p><p>485.  We are all sensible what a stately Seat it is: The  
Heavens adorned with so many glorious Luminaries; and  
the Earth with Groves, Plains, Valleys, Hills, Fountains,  
Ponds, Lakes and Rivers; and Variety of Fruits, and   
Creatures for Food, Pleasure and Profit.  In short, how Noble  
an House he keeps, and the Plenty and Variety and   
Excellency of his Table; his Orders, Seasons and Suitableness  
of every Time and Thing.  But we must be as sensible, or  
at least ought to be, what Careless and Idle Servants we  
are, and how short and disproportionable our Behavior is to  
his Bounty and Goodness: How long he bears, and often he  
reprieves and forgives us: Who, notwithstanding our Breach  
of Promises, and repeated Neglects, has not yet been   
provok'd to break up House, and send us to shift for our selves.   
Should not this great Goodness raise a due Sense in us of our  
Undutifulness, and a Resolution to alter our Course and  
mend our Manners; that we may be for the future more  
worthy Communicants at our Master's good and great  
Table? Especially since it is not more certain that we   
deserve his Displeasure than that we should feel it, if we  
continue to be unprofitable Servants.  
</p><p>486.  But tho' God has replenisht this World with   
abundance of good Things for Man's Life and Comfort, yet they  
are all but Imperfect Goods.  He only is the Perfect Good  
to whom they point.  But alas! Men cannot see him for  
them; tho' they should always see him In them.  
</p><p>487.  I have often wondered at the unaccountableness of  
Man in this, among other things; that tho' he loves Changes  
so well, he should care so little to hear or think of his last,  
great, and best Change too, if he pleases.  
</p><p>488.  Being, as to our Bodies, composed of changeable   
Elements, we with the World, are made up of, and subsist by  
Revolution: But our Souls being of another and nobler   
Nature, we should seek our Rest in a more induring Habitation.  
</p><p>489.  The truest end of Life, is, to know the Life that  
never ends.  
</p><p>490.  He that makes this his Care, will find it his Crown  
at last.  
<pb n="380"/>   
</p><p>491.  Life else, were a Misery rather than a Pleasure, a  
Judgment, not a Blessing.  
</p><p>492.  For to Know, Regret and Resent; to Desire, Hope  
and Fear, more than a Beast, and not live beyond him, is to  
make a Man less than a Beast.  
</p><p>493.  It is the Amends of a short and troublesome Life,  
that Doing well, and Suffering ill, Entitles Man to One  
Longer and Better.  
</p><p>494.  This ever raises the Good Man's Hope, and gives  
him Tastes beyond the other World.  
</p><p>495.  As 't is his Aim, so none else can hit the Mark.  
</p><p>496.  Many make it their Speculation, but 't is the Good  
Man's Practice.  
</p><p>497.  His Work keeps Pace with his Life, and so leaves  
nothing to be done when he Dies.  
</p><p>498.  And he that lives to live ever, never fears dying.  
</p><p>499.  Nor can the Means be terrible to him that heartily  
believes the End.  
</p><p>500.  For tho' Death be a Dark Passage, it leads to   
Immortality, and that 's Recompence enough for Suffering  
of it.  
</p><p>50l.And yet Faith Lights us, even through the Grave,  
being the Evidence of Things not seen.  
</p><p>502.  And this is the Comfort of the Good, that the Grave  
cannot hold them, and that they live as soon as they die.  
</p><p>503.  For Death is no more than a Turning of us over  
from Time to Eternity.  
</p><p>504.  Nor can there be a Revolution without it; for it  
supposes the Dissolution of one form, in order to the   
Succession of another.  
</p><p>505.  Death then, being the Way and Condition of Life,  
we cannot love to live, if we cannot bear to die.  
</p><p>506.  Let us then not cozen our selves with the Shells and  
Husks of things; nor prefer Form to Power, nor Shadows  
to Substance: Pictures of Bread will not satisfie Hunger, nor  
those of Devotion please God.  
</p><p>507.  This World is a Form; our Bodies are Forms; and  
no visible Acts of Devotion can be without Forms.  But yet  
the less Form in Religion the better, since God is a Spirit:  
For the more mental our Worship, the more adequate to the  
<pb n="381"/>   
Nature of God; the more silent, the more suitable to the  
Language of a Spirit.  
</p><p>508.  Words are for others, not for our selves: Nor  
for God, who hears not as Bodies do; but as Spirits  
should.  
</p><p>509.  If we would know this Dialect; we must learn of  
the Divine Principle in us.  As we hear the Dictates of that,  
so God hears us.  
</p><p>510.  There we may see him too in all his Attributes; Tho'  
but in little, yet as much as we can apprehend or bear: for  
as he is in himself, he is incomprehensible, and dwelleth in  
that Light which no Eye can approach.  But in his Image  
we may behold his Glory; enough to exalt our Apprehensions   
of God, and to instruct us in that Worship which  
pleaseth him.  
</p><p>511.  Men may Tire themselves in a Labyrinth of Search,  
and talk of God: But if we would know him indeed, it  
must be from the Impressions we receive of him; and the  
softer our Hearts are, the deeper and livelier those will be  
upon us.  
</p><p>512.  If he has made us sensible of his Justice, by his   
Reproof; of his Patience, by his Forbearance; of his Mercy, by  
his Forgiveness; of his Holiness, by the Sanctification of our  
Hearts through his Spirit; we have a grounded Knowledge  
of God.  This is Experience, that Speculation; This Enjoyment, that Report.  In short, this is undeniable Evidence,  
with the realities of Religion, and will stand all Winds and  
Weathers.  
</p><p>513.  As our Faith, so our Devotion should be lively.  Cold  
Meat won't serve at those Repasts.  
</p><p>514.  It 's a Coal from God's Altar must kindle our Fire:  
And without Fire, true Fire, no acceptable Sacrifice.  
</p><p>515.  Open thou my Lips, and then, said the Royal Prophet,  
My Mouth shall praise God.  But not 'till then.  
</p><p>516.  The Preparation of the Heart, as well as Answer of  
the Tongue, is of the Lord: And to have it, our Prayers  
must be powerful, and our Worship grateful.  
</p><p>517.  Let us chuse, therefore, to commune where there is  
the warmest Sense of Religion; where Devotion exceeds  
Formality, and Practice most corresponds with Profession;  
<pb n="382"/>   
and where there is at least as much Charity as Zeal: For  
where this Society is to be found, there shall we find the  
Church of God.  
</p><p>518.  As Good, so Ill Men are all of a Church; and every  
Body knows who must be Head of it.  
</p><p>519.  The Humble, Meek, Merciful, Just, Pious and Devout  
Souls, are everywhere of one Religion; and when Death  
has taken off the Mask, they will know one another, tho' the  
divers Liveries they wear here make them Strangers.  
</p><p>520.  Great Allowances are to be made of Education, and  
personal Weaknesses: But 't is a Rule with me, that Man is  
truly Religious, that loves the Persuasion he is of, for the  
Piety rather than Ceremony of it.  
</p><p>521.  They that have one End, can hardly disagree when  
they meet.  At least their concern is in the Greater, moderates   
the value and difference about the lesser things.  
</p><p>522.  It is a sad Reflection, that many Men hardly have  
any Religion at all; and most Men have none of their own:  
For that which is the Religion of their Education, and not  
of their Judgment, is the Religion of Another, and not  
Theirs.  
</p><p>523.  To have Religion upon Authority, and not upon   
Conviction, is like a Finger Watch, to be set forwards or   
backwards, as he pleases that has it in keeping.  
</p><p>524.  It is a Preposterous thing, that Men can venture their  
Souls where they will not venture their Money: For they  
will take their Religion upon trust, but not trust a Synod  
about the Goodness of Half a Crown.  
</p><p>525.  They will follow their own Judgment when their  
Money is concerned, whatever they do for their Souls.  
</p><p>526.  But to be sure, that Religion cannot be right, that a  
Man is the worse for having.  
</p><p>527.  No Religion is better than an Unnatural One.  
</p><p>528.  Grace perfects, but never sours or spoils Nature.  
</p><p>529.  To be Unnatural in Defence of Grace, is a   
Contradiction.  
</p><p>530.  Hardly any thing looks worse, than to defend   
Religion by ways that shew it has no Credit with us.  
</p><p>531.  A Devout Man is one thing, a Stickler is quite  
another.  
<pb n="383"/>   
</p><p>532.  When our Maids exceed their just Bounds, we must  
needs discredit what we would recommend.  
</p><p>533.  To be Furious in Religion, is to be Irreligiously  
Religious.  
</p><p>534.  If he that is without Bowels, is not a Man; How  
then can he be a Christian?  
</p><p>535.  It were better to be of no Church, than to be bitter  
for any.  
</p><p>536.  Bitterness comes very near to Enmity, and that is  
Beelzebub; because the Perfection of Wickedness.  
</p><p>537.  A good End cannot sanctifie evil Means; nor must  
we ever do Evil, that Good may come of it.  
</p><p>538.  Some Folks think they may Scold, Rail, Hate, Rob  
and Kill too; so it be but for God's sake.  
</p><p>539.  But nothing in us unlike him, can please him.  
</p><p>540.  It is as great Presumption to send our Passions  
upon God's Errands, as it is to palliate them with God's  
Name.  
</p><p>541.  Zeal dropped in Charity, is good, without it good for  
nothing: For it devours all it comes near.  
</p><p>542.  They must first judge themselves, that presume to  
censure others: And such will not be apt to overshoot the  
Mark.  
</p><p>543.  We are too ready to retaliate, rather than forgive,  
or gain by Love and Information.  
</p><p>544.  And yet we could hurt no Man that we believe  
loves us.  
</p><p>545.  Let us then try what Love will do: For if Men did  
once see we Love them, we should soon find they would not  
harm us.  
</p><p>546.  Force may subdue, but Love gains: And he that   
forgives first, wins the Lawrel,  
</p><p>547.  If I am even with my Enemy, the Debt is paid; but  
if I forgive it, I oblige him for ever.  
</p><p>548.  Love is the hardest Lesson in Christianity; but, for  
that reason, it should be most our care to learn it.  <hi rend="italic">Difficilia  
quae Pulchra</hi>.<ref target="PolSon12">12</ref>
</p><p>549.  It is a severe Rebuke upon us, that God makes us so  
many Allowances, and we make so few to our Neighbor: As  
<pb n="384"/>   
if Charity had nothing to do with Religion; Or Love with  
Faith, that ought to work by it.  
</p><p>550.  I find all sorts of People agree, whatsoever were their  
Animosities, when humbled by the Approaches of Death:  
Then they forgive, then they pray for, and love one another:  
Which shews us, that it is not our Reason, but our Passion,  
that makes and holds up the Feuds that reign among men  
in their Health and Fulness.  They, therefore, that live   
nearest to that which they should die, must certainly live best.  
</p><p>551.  Did we believe a final Reckoning and Judgment; or  
did we think enough of what we do believe, we would allow  
more Love in Religion than we do; since Religion it self is  
nothing else but Love to God and Man.  
</p><p>552.  He that lives in Love lives in God, says the Beloved  
Disciple: And to be sure a Man can live no where better.  
</p><p>553.  It is most reasonable Men should value that Benefit,  
which is most durable.  Now Tongues shall cease, and  
Prophecy fail, and Faith shall be consummated in Sight, and  
Hope in Enjoyment; but Love remains.  
</p><p>554.  Love is indeed Heaven upon Earth; since Heaven  
above would not be Heaven without it: For where there is  
not Love; there is Fear: But perfect Love casts out Fear.   
And yet we naturally fear most to offend what we most  
Love.  
</p><p>555.  What we Love, we 'll Hear; what we Love, we 'll  
Trust; and what we Love, we 'll serve, ay, and suffer for  
too.  If you love me (says our Blessed Redeemer) keep my  
Commandments.  Why? Why then he 'll Love us; then  
we shall be his Friends; then he 'll send us the Comforter;  
then whatsoever we ask, we shall receive; and then where  
he is we shall be also, and that for ever.  Behold the Fruits  
of Love; the Power, Vertue, Benefit and Beauty of Love!  
</p><p>556.  Love is above all; and when it prevails in us all, we  
shall all be Lovely, and in Love with God and one with  
another.<lb/>

<head>THE RIGHT MORALIST</head> 
 
<p>A RIGHT Moralist, is a Great and Good Man, but for  
that Reason he is rarely to be found.  
</p><p>2.  There are a Sort of People, that are fond of  
the Character, who, in my Opinion, have but little Title  
to it.  
</p><p>3.  They think it enough, not to defraud a Man of his Pay,  
or betray his Friend; but never consider, That the Law forbids   
the one at his Peril, and that Virtue is seldom the  
Reason of the other.  
</p><p>4.  But certainly he that Covets, can no more be a Moral  
Man, than he that Steals; since he does so in his Mind.   
Nor can he be one that Robs his Neighbor of his Credit, or  
that craftily undermines him of his Trade or Office.  
</p><p>5.  If a Man pays his Taylor, but Debauches his Wife; Is  
he a current Moralist?  
</p><p>6.  But what shall we say of the Man that Rebels against  
his Father, is an Ill Husband, or an Abusive Neighbor; one  
that 's Lavish of his Time, of his Health, and of his Estate,  
in which his Family is so nearly concerned? Must he go  
for a Right Moralist, because he pays his Rent well?  
</p><p>7.  I would ask some of those Men of Morals, Whether he  
that Robs God and Himself too, tho' he should not defraud  
his Neighbor, be the Moral Man?  
</p><p>8.  Do I owe my self Nothing? And do I not owe All to  
God? And if paying what we owe, makes the Moral Man,  
is it not fit we should begin to render our Dues, where we  
owe our very Beginning; ay, our All?  
</p><p>9.  The Compleat Moralist begins with God; he gives him  
<pb n="392"/>   
his Due, his Heart, his Love, his Service; the Bountiful  
Giver of his Well-Being, as well as Being.  
</p><p>10.  He that lives without a Sense of this Dependency and  
Obligation, cannot be a Moral Man, because he does not  
make his Returns of Love and 0bedience; as becomes an  
honest and a sensible Creature: Which very Term Implies  
he is not his own; and it cannot be very honest to mis-imploy another's Goods.  
</p><p>11.  But can there be no Debt, but to a fellow Creature?  
Or, will our Exactness in paying those Dribling ones, while  
we neglect our weightier Obligations, Cancel the Bonds we  
lie under, and render us right and thorough Moralists?  
</p><p>12.  As Judgments are paid before Bonds, and Bonds  
before Bills or Book-Debts, so the Moralist considers his  
Obligations according to their several Dignities.  
</p><p>In the first Place, Him to whom he owes himself.  Next,  
himself, in his Health and Livelihood.  Lastly, His other  
Obligations, whether Rational or Pecuniary; doing to others,  
to the Extent of his Ability, as he would have them do unto  
him.  
</p><p>13.  In short, The Moral Man is he that Loves God above  
All, and his Neighbor as himself, which fulfils both Tables  
at once.  
</p> 
<p> 
THE WORLD'S ABLE MAN<lb/>  
14.  It is by some thought, the Character of an Able Man,  
to be Dark and not Understood.  But I am sure that is not  
fair Play.  
</p><p>15.  If he be so by Silence, 't is better; but if by Disguises,  
't is insincere and hateful.  
</p><p>16.  Secrecy is one Thing, false Lights is another.  
</p><p>17.  The honest Man, that is rather free, than open, is ever  
to be preferrd; especially when Sense is at Helm.  
</p><p>18.  The Glorying of the other Humor is in a Vice: For it  
is not Humane to be Cold, Dark, and Unconversable.  I  
was a going to say, they are like Pick-Pockets in a Crowd,  
where a Man must ever have his Hand on his Purse; or as  
Spies in a Garrison, that if not prevented betrays it.  
</p><p>19.  They are the Reverse of Human Nature, and yet this  
is the present World's Wise Man and Politician: Excellent  
<pb n="393"/>   
Qualities for Lapland, where, they say, Witches, though not  
many Conjurors, dwell.  
</p><p>20.  Like Highway-Men, that rarely Rob without Vizards,  
or in the same Wigs and Cloaths, but have a Dress for every  
Enterprize.  
</p><p>21.  At best, he may be a Cunning Man, which is a sort of  
Lurcher in the Politicks.  
</p><p>22.  He is never too hard for the Wise Man upon the  
Square, for that is out of his Element, and puts him quite  
by his Skill.  
</p><p>Nor are Wise Men ever catch'd by him, but when they  
trust him.  
</p><p>23.  But as Cold and Close as he seems, he can and will  
please all, if he gets by it, though it should neither please  
God nor himself at bottom.  
</p><p>24.  He is for every Cause that brings him Gain, but   
Implacable if disappointed of Success.  
</p><p>25.  And what he cannot hinder, he will be sure to Spoil,  
by over-doing it.  
</p><p>26.  None so Zealous then as he, for that which he cannot  
abide.  
</p><p>27.  What is it he will not, or cannot do, to hide his true  
Sentiments.  
</p><p>28.  For his Interest, he refuses no Side or Party; and will  
take the Wrong by the Hand, when t'other won't do, with  
as good a Grace as the Right.  
</p><p>29.  Nay, he commonly chooses the Worst, because that  
brings the best Bribe: His Cause being ever Money.  
</p><p>30.  He Sails with all Winds, and is never out of his Way,  
where any Thing is to be had.  
</p><p>31.  A Privateer indeed, and everywhere a very Bird of Prey.  
</p><p>32.  True to nothing but himself, and false to all Persons  
and Parties, to serve his own Turn.  
</p><p>33.  Talk with him as often as you please, he will never  
pay you in good Coin; for 't is either False or Clipt.  
</p><p>34.  But to give a False Reason for any Thing, let my  
Reader never learn of him, no more than to give a Brass  
Half-Crown for a good one: Not only because it is not true,  
but because it Deceives the Person to whom it is given;  
which I take to be an Immorality.  
<pb n="394"/>   
</p><p>35.  Silence Is much more preferable, for it saves the  
Secret, as well as the Person's Honor.  
</p><p>36.  Such as give themselves the Latitude of saying what  
they do not mean, come to be errant Jockeys at more Things  
than one; but in Religion and Politicks, 't is most pernicious.  
</p><p>37.  To hear two Men talk the Reverse of their own   
Sentiments, with all the good Breeding and Appearance of   
Friendship imaginable, on purpose to Cozen or Pump each other,  
is to a Man of Virtue and Honor, one of the Melancholiest,  
as well as most Nauseous Thing in the World.  
</p><p>38.  But that it should be the Character of an Able Man,  
is to Disinherit Wisdom, and Paint out our Degeneracy to  
the Life, by setting up Fraud, an errant Impostor, in her  
Room.  
</p><p>39.  The Tryal of Skill between these two is, who shall  
believe least of what t'other says; and he that has the   
Weakness, or good Nature to give out first, (viz. to believe any  
Thing t'other says) is lookd upon to be Trickd.  
</p><p>40.  I cannot see the Policy, any more than the Necessity,  
of a Man's Mind always giving the Lye to his Mouth, or his  
Mouth ever giving the false Alarms of his Mind: For no  
Man can be long believed, that teaches all Men to distrust  
him; and since the Ablest have sometimes need of Credit,  
where lies the Advantage of their Politick Cant or Banter  
upon Mankind?  
</p><p>41.  I remember a Passage of one of Queen Elizabeth's  
Great Men, as Advice to his Friend; The Advantage, says  
he, I had upon others at Court, was, that I always spoke as  
I thought, which being not believed by them, I both   
preserv'd a good Conscience, and suffered no Damage from that  
Freedom: Which, as it shows the Vice to be Older than our  
Times, so that Gallant Man's Integrity, to be the best Way  
of avoiding it.  
</p><p>42.  To be sure it is wise as well as Honest, neither to  
flatter other Men's Sentiments, nor Dissemble and less  
Contradict our own.  
</p><p>43.  To hold ones Tongue, or speak Truth, or talk only of  
indifferent Things, is the Fairest Conversation.  
</p><p>44.  Women that rarely go Abroad without Vizard-Masks,  
have none of the best Reputation.  But when we consider  
<pb n="395"/>   
what all this Art and Disguise are for, it equally heightens  
the Wise Man's Wonder and Aversion: Perhaps it is to   
betray a Father, a Brother, a Master, a Friend, a Neighbor, or  
ones own Party.  
</p><p>45.  A fine Conquest! what Noble Grecians and Romans  
abhorr'd: As if Government could not subsist without  
Knavery, and that Knaves were the Usefullest Props to it;  
tho' the basest, as well as greatest, Perversion of the Ends  
of it.  
</p><p>46.  But that it should become a Maxim, shows but too  
grossly the Corruption of the Times.  
</p><p>47.  I confess I have heard the Stile of a Useful Knave,  
but ever took it to be a silly or a knavish Saying; at least an  
Excuse for Knavery.  
</p><p>48.  It is as reasonable to think a Whore makes the best  
Wife, as a Knave the best Officer.  
</p><p>49.  Besides, Employing Knaves, Encourages Knavery   
instead of punishing it; and Alienates the Reward of Virtue.  
Or, at least, must make the World believe, the Country  
yields not honest Men enough, able to serve her.  
</p><p>50.  Art thou a Magistrate? Prefer such as have clean  
Characters where they live, and of Estates to secure a just  
Discharge of their Trusts; that are under no Temptation to  
strain Points for a Fortune: For sometimes such may be  
found, sooner than they are Employed.  
</p><p>51.  Art thou a Private Man? Contract thy Acquaintance  
in a narrow Compass, and chuse Those for the Subjects of  
it, that are Men of Principles; such as will make full Stops,  
where Honor will not lead them on; and that had rather  
bear the disgrace of not being thorow Paced Men, than   
forfeit their Peace and Reputation by a base Compliance.  
 THE WISE MAN<lb/>  
</p><p>52.  The Wise Man Governs himself by the Reason of his  
Case, and because what he does is Best: Best, in a Moral  
and Prudent, not a Sinister Sense.  
</p><p>53.  He proposes just Ends, and employs the fairest and  
Probablest Means and Methods to attain them.  
</p><p>54.  Though you cannot always penetrate his Design, on  
<pb n="396"/>   
his Reasons for it, yet you shall ever see his Actions of a  
Piece , and his Performances like a Workman: They will  
bear the Touch of Wisdom and Honor, as often as they  
are tryed.  
</p><p>55.  He scorns to serve himself by Indirect Means, or be  
an Interloper in Government, since just Enterprises never  
want any just Ways to succeed them.  
</p><p>56.  To do Evil, that Good may come of it, is for Bunglers  
in Politicks, as well as Morals.  
</p><p>57.  Like those Surgeons, that will cut off an Arm they  
can't cure, to hide their Ignorance and save their Credit.  
</p><p>58.  The Wise Man is Cautious, but not cunning;  
Judicious, but not Crafty; making Virtue the Measure of  
using his Excellent Understanding in the Conduct of his  
Life.  
</p><p>59.  The Wise Man is equal, ready, but not officious; has  
in every Thing an Eye to Sure Footing: He offends no  
Body, nor easily is offended, and always willing to   
Compound for Wrongs, if not forgive them.  
</p><p>60.  He is never Captious, nor Critical; hates Banter and  
Jests: He may be Pleasant, but not Light; he never deals  
but in Substantial Ware, and leaves the rest for the Toy  
Pates (or Shops) of the World; which are so far from being  
his Business, that they are not so much as his Diversion.  
</p><p>61.  He is always for some solid Good, Civil or Moral; as,  
to make his Country more Virtuous, Preserve her Peace  
and Liberty, Imploy her Poor, Improve Land, Advance  
Trade, Suppress Vice, Incourage Industry, and all Mechanick  
Knowledge; and that they should be the Care of the   
Government, and the Blessing and Praise of the People.  
</p><p>62.  To conclude: He is Just, and fears God, hates   
Covetousness, and eschews Evil, and loves his Neighbor as himself.  
   OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THOUGHTS<lb/>  
</p><p>63.  Man being made a Reasonable, and so a Thinking  
Creature, there is nothing more Worthy of his Being, than  
the Right Direction and Employment of his Thoughts; since  
upon This, depends both his Usefulness to the Publick, and  
his own present and future Benefit in all Respects.  
<pb n="397"/>   
</p><p>64.  The Consideration of this, has often obliged me to  
Lament the Unhappiness of Mankind, that through too great  
a Mixture and Confusion of Thoughts, have been hardly  
able to make a Right or Mature Judgment of Things.  
</p><p>65.  To this is owing the various Uncertainty and   
Confusion we see in the World, and the Intemperate Zeal that  
occasions them.  
</p><p>66.  To this also is to be attributed the imperfect   
Knowledge we have of Things, and the slow Progress we make in  
attaining to a Better; like the Children of Israel that were  
forty Years upon their Journey, from Egypt to Canaan,  
which might have been performed in Less than One.  
</p><p>67.  In fine, 't is to this that we ought to ascribe, if not  
all, at least most of the Infelicities we Labor under.  
</p><p>68.  Clear therefore thy Head, and Rally and Manage thy  
Thoughts Rightly, and thou wilt Save Time, and See and  
Do thy Business Well; for thy Judgment will be Distinct,  
thy Mind Free, and the Faculties Strong and Regular.  
</p><p>69.  Always remember to bound thy Thoughts to the  
present Occasion.  
</p><p>70.  If it be thy Religious Duty, suffer nothing else to  
Share in them.  And if any Civil or Temporal Affair,   
observe the same Caution, and thou wilt be a whole Man to  
every Thing, and do twice the Business in the same Time.  
</p><p>71.  If any Point over-Labors thy Mind, divert and   
relieve it, by some other Subject, of a more Sensible, or  
Manual Nature, rather than what may affect the   
Understanding; for this were to write one Thing upon another,  
which blots out our former Impressions, or renders them  
illegible.  
</p><p>72.  They that are least divided in their Care, always give  
the best Account of their Business.  
</p><p>73.   As therefore thou art always to pursue the present  
Subject, till thou hast master'd it, so if it fall out that thou  
hast more Affairs than one upon thy Hand, be sure to prefer  
that which is of most Moment, and will least wait thy  
Leisure.  
</p><p>74.   He that judges not well of the Importance of his  
Affairs, though he may be always Busy, he must make but  
a small Progress.  
<pb n="398"/>   
</p><p>75.  But make not more Business necessary than is so;  
and rather lessen than augment Work for thy self.  
</p><p>76.  Nor yet be over-eager in pursuit of any Thing; for  
the Mercurial too often happen to leave Judgment behind  
them, and sometimes make Work for Repentance.  
</p><p>77.  He that over-runs his Business, leaves it for him that  
follows more leisurely to take it up; which has often proved  
a profitable Harvest to them that never Sowd.  
</p><p>78.  'Tis the Advantage that slower Tempers have upon  
the Men of lively Parts, that tho' they don't lead, they will  
Follow well, and Glean Clean.  
</p><p>79.  Upon the whole Matter, Employ thy Thoughts as thy  
Business requires, and let that have a Place according to  
Merit and Urgency; giving every Thing a Review and due  
Digestion, and thou wilt prevent many Errors and Vexations,  
as well as save much Time to thy self in the Course of thy  
Life.  
  OF ENVY<lb/>  
</p><p>80.  It is the Mark of an ill Nature, to lessen good Actions,  
and aggravate ill Ones.  
</p><p>81.  Some men do as much begrutch others a good Name,  
as they want one themselves; and perhaps that is the   
Reason of it.  
</p><p>82.  But certainly they are in the Wrong, that can think  
they are lessened, because others have their Due.  
</p><p>83.  Such People generally have less Merit than   Ambition,  
that Covet the Reward of other Men's; and to be sure a  
very ill Nature, that will rather Rob others of their Due,  
than allow them their Praise.  
</p><p>84.  It is more an Error of our Will, than our Judgment:  
For we know it to be an Effect of our Passion, not our  
Reason; and therefore we are the more culpable in our  
Partial Estimates.  
</p><p>85.  It is as Envious as Unjust, to underrate another's  
Actions where their intrinsick Worth recommends them to  
disengaged Minds.  
</p><p>86.  Nothing shews more the Folly, as well as Fraud of  
Man, than Clipping of Merit and Reputation.  
</p><p>87.  And as some Men think it an Allay to themselves,  
<pb n="399"/>   
that others have their Right; so they know no End of   
Pilfering to raise their own Credit.  
</p><p>88.  This Envy is the Child of Pride and Misgives, rather  
than Mistakes.  
</p><p>89.  It will have Charity,  to be Ostentation; Sobriety,  
Covetousness; Humility, Craft; Bounty, Popularity: In  
short, Virtue must be Design, and Religion, only Interest.   
Nay, the best of Qualities must not pass without a BUT to  
allay their Merit and abate their Praise.  Basest of Tempers!  
and they that have them, the Worst of Men!  
</p><p>90.  But Just and Noble Minds Rejoice in other Men's  
Success, and help to augment their Praise.  
</p><p>91.  And indeed they are not without a Love to Virtue,  
that take a Satisfaction in seeing her Rewarded, and such  
deserve to share her Character that do abhor to lessen it.  
    OF MAN'S LIFE<lb/>  
</p><p>92.  Why is Man less durable than the Works of his  
Hands, but because This is not the Place of his Rest?  
</p><p>93.  And it is a Great and Just Reproach upon him, that  
he should fix his Mind where he cannot stay himself.  
</p><p>94.  Were it not more his Wisdom to be concerned about  
those Works that will go with him, and erect a Mansion for  
him where Time has Power neither over him nor it?  
</p><p>95.  'Tis a sad Thing for Man so often to miss his Way  
to his Best, as well as most Lasting Home.  
 OF AMBITION<lb/>  
</p><p>96.  They that soar too high, often fall hard; which makes  
a low and level Dwelling preferrable.  
</p><p>97.  The tallest Trees are most in the Power of the Winds,  
and Ambitious Men of the Blasts of Fortune.  
</p><p>98.  They are most seen and observed, and most envyed:  
Least Quiet, but most talk'd of, and not often to their  
Advantage.  
</p><p>99.  Those Buildings had need of a good Foundation, that  
lie so much exposed to Weather.  
</p><p>100.  Good Works are a Rock, that will support their  
<pb n="400"/>   
Credit; but Ill Ones a Sandy Foundation that Yields to  
Calamities.  
</p><p>101.  And truly they ought to expect no Pity in their Fall,  
that when in Power had no Bowels for the Unhappy.  
</p><p>102.  The worst of Distempers; always Craving and  
Thirsty, Restless and Hated: A perfect Delirium in the  
Mind: Insufferable in Success, and in Disappointments most  
Revengeful.  
   OF PRAISE OR APPLAUSE<lb/>  
</p><p>103.  We are too apt to love Praise, but not to Deserve it.  
</p><p>104.  But if we would Deserve it, we must love Virtue  
more than That.  
</p><p>105.  As there is no Passion in us sooner moved, or more  
deceivable, so for that Reason there is none over which we  
ought to be more Watchful, whether we give or receive it:  
For if we give it, we must be sure to mean it, and measure  
it too.  
</p><p>106.  If we are Penurious, it shows Emulation; if we   
exceed, Flattery.  
</p><p>107.  Good Measure belongs to Good Actions; more looks  
Nauseous, as well as Insincere; besides, 't is a Persecuting  
of the Meritorious, who are out of Countenance to hear,  
what they deserve.  
</p><p>108.  It is much easier for him to merit Applause, than  
hear of it: And he never doubts himself more, or the Person  
that gives it, than when he hears so much of it.  
</p><p>109.  But to say true, there needs not many Cautions on  
this Hand, since the World is rarely just enough to the  
Deserving.  
</p><p>110.  However, we cannot be too Circumspect how we  
receive Praise: For if we contemplate our selves in a  
false Glass, we are sure to be mistaken about our Dues;  
and because we are too apt to believe what is Pleasing,  
rather than what is True, we may be too easily swell'd,  
beyond our just Proportion, by the Windy Compliments  
of Men.  
</p><p>111.  Make ever therefore Allowances for what is said on  
such Occasions, or thou Exposest, as well as Deceivest thy  
self.  
<pb n="401"/>   
</p><p>112.  For an Over-value of our selves, gives us but a  
dangerous Security in many Respects.  
</p><p>113.  We expect more than belongs to us; take all that 's  
given us though never meant us; and fall out with those  
that are not as full of us as we are of our selves.  
</p><p>114.  In short, 't is a Passion that abuses our Judgment,  
and makes us both Unsafe and Ridiculous.  
</p><p>115.  Be not fond therefore of Praise, but seek Virtue that  
leads to it.  
</p><p>116.  And yet no more lessen or dissemble thy Merit, than  
over-rate it: For tho' Humility be a Virtue, an affected one  
is none.  
    OF CONDUCT IN SPEECH<lb/>  
</p><p>117.  Enquire often, but Judge rarely, and thou wilt not  
often be mistaken.  
</p><p>118.  It is safer to Learn, than teach; and who conceals  
his Opinion, has nothing to Answer for.  
</p><p>119.  Vanity or Resentment often engage us, and 't is two  
to one but we come off Losers; for one shews a Want of  
Judgment and Humility, as the other does of Temper and  
Discretion.  
</p><p>120.  Not that I admire the Reserved; for they are next  
to Unnatural that are not Communicable.  But if Reservedness   
be at any Time a Virtue, 't is in Throngs or ill  
Company.  
</p><p>121.  Beware also of Affectation in Speech; it often wrongs  
Matter, and ever shows a blind Side.  
</p><p>122.  Speak properly, and in as few Words as you can,  
but always plainly; for the End of Speech is not   
Ostentation, but to be understood.  
</p><p>123.  They that affect Words more than Matter, will dry  
up that little they have.  
</p><p>124.  Sense never fails to give them that have it, Words  
enough to make them understood.  
</p><p>125.  But it too often happens in some Conversations, as in  
Apothecary-Shops, that those Pots that are Empty, or have  
things of Small Value in them, are as gaudily Dress'd and  
Flourish'd, as those that are full of precious Drugs.  
</p><p>126.  This Laboring of slight Matter with flourish'd Turns  
<pb n="402"/>   
of Expression, is fulsome, and worse than the Modern   
Imitation of Tapestry, and East-India Goods, in Stuffs and  
Linnens.  In short, 't is but Taudry Talk, and next to very  
Trash.  
    UNION OF FRIENDS<lb/>  
</p><p>127.  They that love beyond the World, cannot be   
separated by it.  
</p><p>128.  Death cannot kill, what never dies.  
</p><p>129.  Nor can Spirits ever be divided that love and live in  
the same Divine Principle; the Root and Record of their  
Friendship.  
</p><p>130.  If Absence be not death, neither is theirs.  
</p><p>131.  Death is but Crossing the World, as Friends do the  
Seas; They live in one another still.  
</p><p>132.  For they must needs be present, that love and live  
in that which is Omnipresent.  
</p><p>133.  In this Divine Glass, they see Face to Face; and their  
Converse is Free, as well as Pure.  
</p><p>134.  This is the Comfort of Friends, that though they may  
be said to Die, yet their Friendship and Society are, in the  
best Sense, ever present, because Immortal.  
   OF BEING EASY IN LIVING<lb/>  
</p><p>135.  'Tis a Happiness to be delivered from a Curious  
Mind, as well as from a Dainty Palate.  
</p><p>136.  For it is not only a Troublesome but Slavish Thing  
to be Nice.  
</p><p>137.  They narrow their own Freedom and Comforts, that  
make so much requisite to enjoy them.  
</p><p>138.  To be Easy in Living, is much of the Pleasure of  
Life: But Difficult Tempers will always want it.  
</p><p>139.  A Careless and Homely Breeding is therefore   
preferable to one Nice and Delicate.  
</p><p>140.  And he that is taught to live upon a little, owes more  
to his Father's Wisdom, than he that has a great deal left  
him, does to his Father's Care.  
</p><p>141.  Children can't well be too hardly Bred: For besides  
that it fits them to bear the Roughest Providences, it is more  
Masculine, Active and Healthy.  
<pb n="403"/>   
</p><p>142.  Nay, 't is certain, that Liberty of the Mind is  
mightily preserved by it: For so 't is served, instead of being  
a Servant, indeed a Slave to sensual Delicacies.  
</p><p>143.  As Nature is soon answered, so are such satisfied.  
</p><p>144.  The Memory of the Ancients is hardly in any Thing  
more to be celebrated, than in a Strict and Useful Institution  
of Youth.  
</p><p>145.  By Labor they prevented Luxury in their young   
People, till Wisdom and Philosophy had taught them to Resist  
and Despise it.  
</p><p>146.  It must be therefore a gross Fault to strive so hard  
for the Pleasure of our Bodies, and be so insensible and  
careless of the Freedom of our Souls.  
  OF MAN'S INCONSIDERATENESS AND PARTIALITY<lb/>  
</p><p>147.  'Tis very observable, if our Civil Rights are invaded  
or incroach'd upon, we are mightily touch'd, and fill every  
Place with our Resentment and Complaint; while we suffer  
our selves, our Better and Nobler Selves, to be the Property  
and Vassals of Sin, the worst of Invaders.  
</p><p>148.  In vain do we expect to be delivered from such  
Troubles, till we are delivered from the Cause of them, our  
Disobedience to God.  
</p><p>149.  When he has his Dues from us, it will be time enough  
for Him to give us ours out of one another.  
</p><p>150.  'Tis our great Happiness, if we could understand it,  
that we meet with such Checks in the Career of our worldly  
Enjoyments, lest we should Forget the Giver, adore the Gift,  
and terminate our Felicity here, which is not Man's ultimate  
Bliss.  
</p><p>151.  Our Losses are often made Judgments by our Guilt,  
and Mercies by our Repentance.  
</p><p>152.  Besides, it argues great Folly in Men to let their  
Satisfaction exceed the true Value of any Temporal Matter:  
For Disappointments are not always to be measured by the  
Loss of the Thing, but the Over-value we put upon lt.  
</p><p>153.  And thus Men improve their own Miseries, for want  
of an Equal and Just Estimate of what they Enjoy or Lose.  
</p><p>154.  There lies a Proviso upon every Thing in this World,  
<pb n="404"/>   
and we must observe it at our own Peril, viz.  To love God  
above all, and Act for Judgment, the Last I mean.  
 OF THE RULE OF JUDGING<lb/>  
</p><p>155.  In all Things Reason should prevail: 'Tis quite   
another Thing to be stiff than steady in an Opinion.  
</p><p>156.  This May be Reasonable, but that is ever Wilful.  
</p><p>157.  In such Cases it always happens, that the clearer the  
Argument, the greater the Obstinacy, where the Design is  
not to be convinced.  
</p><p>158.  This is to value Humor more than Truth, and prefer  
a sullen Pride to a reasonable Submission.  
</p><p>159.  'Tis the Glory of a Man to vail to Truth; as it is  
the Mark of a good Nature to be Easily entreated.  
</p><p>160.  Beasts Act by Sense, Man should by Reason; else he  
is a greater Beast than ever God made: And the Proverb  
is verified, The Corruption of the best Things is the worst  
and most offensive.  
</p><p>161.  A reasonable Opinion must ever be in Danger, where  
Reason is not Judge.  
</p><p>162.  Though there is a Regard due to Education, and the  
Tradition of our Fathers, Truth will ever deserve, as well  
as claim the Preference.  
</p><p>163.  If like Theophilus and Timothy, we have been  
brought up in the Knowledge of the best Things, 't is our   
Advantage: But neither they nor we lose by trying their Truth;  
for so we learn their, as well as its intrinsick Worth.  
</p><p>164.  Truth never lost Ground by Enquiry, because she is  
most of all Reasonable.  
</p><p>165.  Nor can that need another Authority, that is Self-evident.  
</p><p>166.  If my own Reason be on the Side of a Principle, with  
what can I Dispute or withstand it?  
</p><p>167.  And if Men would once consider one another reasonably,   
they would either reconcile their Differences, or more  
Amicably maintain them.  
</p><p>168.  Let That therefore be the Standard, that has most  
to say for itself.  Tho' of that let every Man he Judge for  
himself.  
<pb n="405"/>   
</p><p>169.  Reason, like the Sun, is Common to All; And 't is  
for want of examining all by the same Light and Measure,  
that we are not all of the same Mind: For all have it to that  
End, though all do not use it So.  
    OF FORMALITY<lb/>  
</p><p>170.  Form is Good, but not Formality.  
</p><p>171.  In the Use of the best of Forms there is too much  
of that I fear.  
</p><p>172.  'Tis absolutely necessary, that this Distinction should  
go along with People in their Devotion; for too many are  
apter to rest upon What they do, than How they do their  
Duty.  
</p><p>173.  If it were considered, that it is the Frame of the  
Mind that gives our Performances Acceptance, we would  
lay more Stress on our Inward Preparation than our   
Outward Action.  
OF THE MEAN NOTION WE HAVE OF GOD<lb/>  
</p><p>174.  Nothing more shews the low Condition Man is fallen  
into, than the unsuitable Notion we must have of God, by  
the Ways we take to please him.  
</p><p>175.  As if it availed any Thing to him that we performed  
so many Ceremonies and external Forms of Devotion, who  
never meant more by them, than to try our Obedience, and,  
through them, to shew us something more Excellent and  
Durable beyond them.  
</p><p>176.  Doing, while we are Undoing, is good for nothing.  
</p><p>177.  Of what Benefit is it to say our Prayers regularly, go  
to Church, receive the Sacraments, and may be go to   
Confessions too; ay, Feast the Priest, and give Alms to the  
Poor, and yet Lye, Swear, Curse, be Drunk, Covetous,  
Unclean, Proud, Revengeful, Vain and Idle at the same  
Time?  
</p><p>178.  Can one excuse or ballance the other? Or will God  
think himself well served, where his Law is Violated? Or  
well used, where there is so much more Shew than Substance?  
<pb n="406"/>   
</p><p>179.  'Tis a most dangerous Error for a Man to think to  
excuse himself in the Breach of a Moral Duty, by a Formal  
Performance of Positive Worship; and less when of Human  
Invention.  
</p><p>180.  Our Blessed Saviour most rightly and clearly   
distinguished and determined this Case, when he told the Jews,  
that they were his Mother, his Brethren and Sisters, who  
did the Will of his Father.  
OF THE BENEFIT OF JUSTICE<lb/>  
</p><p>181.  Justice is a great Support of Society, because in  
Insurance to all Men of their Property: This violated,  
there 's no Security, which throws all into Confusion to  
recover it.  
</p><p>182.  An Honest Man is a fast Pledge in Dealing.  A Man  
is Sure to have it if it be to be had.  
</p><p>183.  Many are so, merely of Necessity: Others not so  
only for the same Reason: But such an honest Man is not  
to be thanked, and such a dishonest Man is to be pity'd.  
</p><p>184.  But he that is dishonest for Gain, is next to a Robber,  
and to be punish'd for Example.  
</p><p>185.   And indeed there are few Dealers, but what are  
Faulty, which makes Trade Difficult, and a great Temptation  
to Men of Virtue.  
</p><p>186.  'Tis not what they should, but what they can get:  
Faults or Decays must be concealed: Big Words given, where  
they are not deserved, and the Ignorance or Necessity of the  
Buyer imposed upon for unjust Profit.  
</p><p>187.  These are the Men that keep their Words for  
their own Ends, and are only Just for Fear of the Magistrate.  
</p><p>188.  A Politick rather than a Moral Honesty; a   
constrained, not a chosen Justice: According to the Proverb,  
Patience per Force, and thank you for nothing.  
</p><p>189.  But of all Justice, that is the greatest, that passes  
under the Name of Law.  A Cut-Purse in   
Westminster-Hall exceeds; for that advances Injustice to   
Oppression, where Law is alledged for that which it should  
punish.  
<pb n="407"/>   
 OF JEALOUSY<lb/>  
</p><p>190.  The Jealous are Troublesome to others, but a   
Torment to themselves.  
</p><p>191.  Jealousy is a kind of Civil War in the Soul, where  
Judgment and Imagination are at perpetual Jars.  
</p><p>192.  This Civil Dissension in the Mind, like that of the  
Body Politick, commits great Disorders, and lays all waste.  
</p><p>193.  Nothing stands safe in its Way: Nature, Interest,  
Religion, must Yield to its Fury.  
</p><p>194.  It violates Contracts, Dissolves Society, Breaks   
Wedlock, Betrays Friends and Neighbors.  No Body is Good,  
and every one is either doing or designing them a Mischief.  
</p><p>195.  It has a Venome that more or less rankles wherever  
it bites: And as it reports Fancies for Facts, so it disturbs  
its own House as often as other Folks.  
</p><p>196.  Its Rise is Guilt or Ill Nature, and by Reflection  
thinks its own Faults to be other Men's; as he that 's   
overrun with the Jaundice takes others to be Yellow.  
</p><p>197.  A Jealous Man only sees his own Spectrum, when he  
looks upon other Men, and gives his Character in theirs.  
   OF STATE<lb/>  
</p><p>198.  I love Service, but not State; One is Useful, the other  
is Superfluous.  
</p><p>199.  The Trouble of this, as well as Charge, Is Real; but  
the Advantage only Imaginary.  
</p><p>200.  Besides, it helps to set us up above our selves, and  
Augments our Temptation to Disorder.  
</p><p>201.  The Least Thing out of Joint, or omitted, make us  
uneasy: and we are ready to think our selves ill served,  
about that which is of no real Service at all: Or so much  
better than other Men, as we have the Means of greater  
State.  
</p><p>202.  But this is all for want of Wisdom, which carries the  
truest and most forceable State along with it.  
</p><p>203.  He that makes not himself Cheap by indiscreet   
Conversation, puts Value enough upon himself every where.  
</p><p>204.  The other is rather Pageantry than State.  
<pb n="408"/>   
   OF A GOOD SERVANT<lb/>  
</p><p>205.  A True, and a Good Servant, are the same Thing.  
</p><p>206.  But no Servant is True to his Master, that Defrauds  
him.  
</p><p>207.  Now there are many Ways of Defrauding a Master, as, of  
Time, Care, Pains, Respect, and Reputation, as well as Money.  
</p><p>208.  He that Neglects his Work, Robs his Master, since  
he is Fed and Paid as if he did his Best; and he that is not  
as Diligent in the Absence, as in the Presence of his Master,  
cannot be a true Servant.  
</p><p>209.  Nor is he a true Servant, that buys dear to share in  
the Profit with the Seller.  
</p><p>210.  Nor yet he that tells Tales without Doors; or deals  
basely in his Master's Name with other People; or Connives  
at others Loyterings, Wasteings, or dishonorable Reflections.  
</p><p>211.  So that a true Servant is Diligent, Secret, and   
Respectful: More Tender of his Master's Honor and Interest,  
than of his own Profit.  
</p><p>212.  Such a Servant deserves well, and if Modest under  
his Merit, should liberally feel it at his Master's Hand.  
 OF AN IMMEDIATE PURSUIT OF THE WORLD<lb/>  
</p><p>213.  It shews a Depraved State of Mind, to Cark and Care  
for that which one does not need.  
</p><p>214.  Some are as eager to be Rich, as ever they were to  
Live: For Superfluity, as for Subsistance.  
</p><p>215.  But that Plenty should augment Covetousness, is a  
Perversion of Providence; and yet the Generality are the  
worse for their Riches.  
</p><p>216.  But it is strange, that Old Men should excel: For   
generally Money lies nearest them that are nearest their Graves;  
As if they would augment their Love in Proportion to the  
little Time they have left to enjoy it: And yet their Pleasure  
is without Enjoyment, since none enjoy what they do not use.  
</p><p>217.  So that instead of learning to leave their greath  
Wealth easily, they hold the Faster, because they must leave  
it: So Sordid is the Temper of some Men.  
</p><p>218.  Where Charity keeps Pace with Gain, Industry is  
<pb n="409"/>   
blessed: But to slave to get, and keep it Sordidly, is a Sin  
against Providence, a Vice in Government, and an Injury  
to their Neighbors.  
</p><p>219.  Such are they as spend not one Fifth of their   
Income, and, it may be, give not one Tenth of what they spend  
to the Needy.  
</p><p>220.  This is the worst Sort of Idolatry, because there can be  
no Religion in it, nor Ignorance pleaded in Excuse of it; and  
that it wrongs other Folks that ought to have a Share therein.  
  OF THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLICK IN OUR ESTATES<lb/>  
</p><p>221.  Hardly any Thing is given us for our Selves, but the  
Publick may claim a Share with us.  But of all we call ours,  
we are most accountable to God and the Publick for our   
Estates: In this we are but Stewards, and to Hord up all to  
ourselves is great Injustice as well as Ingratitude.  
</p><p>222.  If all Men were so far Tenants to the Publick, that  
the Superfluities of Gain and Expence were applied to the  
Exigencies thereof, it would put an End to Taxes, leave  
never a Beggar, and make the greatest Bank for National  
Trade in Europe.  
</p><p>223.  It is a Judgment upon us, as well as Weakness, tho'  
we wont't see it, to begin at the wrong End.  
</p><p>224.  If the Taxes we give are not to maintain Pride, I am  
sure there would be less, if Pride were made a Tax to the  
Government.  
</p><p>225.  I confess I have wondered that so many Lawful and  
Useful Things are excised by Laws, and Pride left to Reign  
Free over them and the Publick.  
</p><p>226.  But since People are more afraid of the Laws of  
Man than of God, because their Punishment seems to be  
nearest: I know not how magistrates can be excused in their  
suffering such Excess with Impunity.  
</p><p>227.  Our Noble English Patriarchs as well as Patriots,  
were so sensible of this Evil, that they made several excellent   
Laws, commonly called Sumptuary, to Forbid, at  
least Limit the Pride of the People; which because the   
Execution of them would be our Interest and Honor, their  
Neglect must be our just Reproach and Loss.  
<pb n="410"/>   
</p><p>228.  'Tis but Reasonable that the Punishment of Pride  
and Excess should help to support the Government, since  
it must otherwise inevitably be ruined by them,  
</p><p>229.  But some say, It ruins Trade, and will make the Poor  
Burthensome to the Publick; But if such Trade in   
Consequence ruins the Kingdom, is it not Time to ruin that  
Trade? Is Moderation no Part of our Duty, and Temperance   
an Enemy to Government?  
</p><p>230.  He is a Judas that will get Money by any Thing.  
</p><p>231.  To wink at a Trade that effeminates the People, and  
invades the Ancient Discipline of the Kingdom, is a Crime  
Capital, and to be severely punish'd instead of being excused  
by the Magistrate.  
</p><p>232.  Is there no better Employment for the Poor than  
Luxury? Miserable Nation!  
</p><p>233.  What did they before they fell into these forbidden  
Methods? Is there not Land enough in England to Cultivate,   
and more and better Manufactures to be Made?  
</p><p>234.  Have we no Room for them in our Plantations, about  
Things that may augment Trade, without Luxury?  
</p><p>235.  In short, let Pride pay, and Excess be well Excised:  
And if that will Cure the People, it will help to Keep the  
Kingdom.  
THE VAIN MAN<lb/>  
</p><p>236.  But a Vain Man is a Nauseous Creature: He is so  
full of himself that he has no Room for any Thing else, be  
it never so Good or Deserving.  
</p><p>237.  'Tis I at every turn that does this, or can do that.   
And as he abounds in his Comparisons, so he is sure to give  
himself the better of every Body else; according to the  
Proverb, All his Geese are Swans.  
</p><p>238.  They are certainly to be pity'd that can be so much  
mistaken at Home.  
</p><p>239.  And yet I have sometimes thought that such People are  
in a sort Happy, that nothing can put out of Countenance with  
themselves, though they neither have nor merit other Peoples.  
</p><p>240.  But at the same Time one would wonder they should  
not feel the Blows they give themselves, or get from others,  
for this intolerable and ridiculous Temper; nor shew any  
<pb n="411"/>   
Concern at that which makes others blush for, as well as at  
them, (viz.) their unreasonable Assurance.  
</p><p>241.  To be a Man's own Fool is bad enough, but the Vain  
Man is Every Body's.  
</p><p>242.  This silly Disposition comes of a Mixture of   
Ignorance, Confidence, and Pride; and as there is more or less of  
the last, so it is more or less offensive or Entertaining.  
</p><p>243.  And yet perhaps the worst Part of this Vanity is it's  
Unteachableness.  Tell it any Thing, and it has known it  
long ago; and out-runs Information and Instruction, or else  
proudly puffs at it.  
</p><p>244.  Whereas the greatest Understandings doubt most, are  
readiest to learn, and least pleas'd with themselves; this, with  
no Body else.  
</p><p>245.  For tho' they stand on higher Ground, and so see  
farther than their Neighbors, they are yet humbled by their  
Prospect, since it shews them something, so much higher and  
above their Reach.  
</p><p>246.  And truly then it is, that Sense shines with the   
greatest Beauty when it is set in Humility.  
</p><p>247.  An humble able Man is a Jewel worth a Kingdom:  
It is often saved by him, as Solomon's Poor Wise Man did  
the City.  
</p><p>248.  May we have more of them, or less Need of them.  
THE CONFORMIST<lb/>  
</p><p>249.  It is reasonable to concur where Conscience does not  
forbid a Compliance; for Conformity is at least a Civil  
Virtue.  
</p><p>250.  But we should only press it in Necessaries, the rest  
may prove a Snare and Temptation to break Society.  
</p><p>251.  But above all, it is a Weakness in Religion and   
Government, where it is carried to Things of an Indifferent  
Nature, since besides that it makes Way for Scruples, Liberty   
is always the Price of it.  
</p><p>252.  Such Conformists have little to boast of, and   
therefore the less Reason to Reproach others that have more  
Latitude.  
</p><p>253.  And yet the Latitudinarian that I love, is one that is  
<pb n="412"/>   
only so in Charity; for the Freedom I recommend is no  
Scepticism in Judgment, and much less so in Practice.  
THE OBLIGATIONS OF GREAT MEN TO ALMIGHTY GOD<lb/>  
</p><p>254.  It seems but reasonable, that those whom God has  
Distinguish'd from others; by his Goodness, should distinguish   
themselves to him by their Gratitude.  
</p><p>255.  For tho' he has made of One Blood all Nations, he  
has not rang'd or dignified them upon the Level, but in a  
sort of Subordination and Dependency.  
</p><p>256.  If we look upwards, we find it in the Heavens, where  
the Planets have their several Degrees of Glory, and so the  
other Stars of Magnitude and Lustre.  
</p><p>257.  If we look upon the Earth, we see it among the Trees  
of the Wood, from the Cedar to the Bramble; in the Waters  
among the Fish, from the Leviathan to the Sprat; in the  
Air among the Birds, from the Eagle to the Sparrow;  
among the Beasts, from the Lyon to the Cat; and among  
Mankind it self, from the King to the Scavenger.  
</p><p>258.  Our Great Men, doubtless, were designed by the  
Wise Framer of the World for our Religious, Moral and  
Politick Planets; for Lights and Directions to the lower  
Ranks of the numerous Company of their own Kind, both  
in Precepts and Examples; and they are well paid for their  
Pains too, who have the Honor and Service of their fellow  
Creatures, and the Marrow and Fat of the Earth for their  
Share.  
</p><p>259.  But is it not a most unaccountable Folly, that Men  
should be Proud of the Providences that should Humble  
them?  Or think the Better of themselves, instead of Him  
that raised them so much above the Level; or in being so  
in their Lives, in Return of his Extraordinary Favors.  
</p><p>260.  But it is but too near a-kin to us, to think no further  
than our selves, either in the Acquisition, or Use of our  
Wealth and Greatness; when, alas, they are the Preferments  
of Heaven, to try our Wisdom, Bounty and Gratitude.  
</p><p>261.  'Tis a dangerous Perversion of the End of Providence   
to Consume the Time, Power and Wealth he has  
given us above other Men, to gratify our Sordid Passions,  
<pb n="413"/>   
instead of playing the good Stewards, to the Honor of our  
great Benefactor, and the Good of our Fellow-Creatures.  
</p><p>262.  But it is an Injustice too; since those Higher Ranks  
of Men are but the Trustees of Heaven for the Benefit of  
lesser Mortals, who, as Minors, are intituled to all their Care  
and Provision.  
</p><p>263.  For though God has dignified some Men above their  
Brethren, it never was to serve their Pleasures, but that they  
might take Pleasure to serve the Publick.  
</p><p>264.  For this Cause doubtless it was, that they were raised  
above Necessity or any Trouble to Live, that they might have  
more Time and Ability to Care for Others: And 't is certain,  
where that Use is not made of the Bounties of Providence,  
they are Imbezzell'd and Wasted.  
</p><p>265.  It has often struck me with a serious Reflection, when  
I have observed the great Inequality of the World; that one  
Man should have such Numbers of his fellow Creatures to  
Wait upon him, who have Souls to be saved as well as he;  
and this not for Business, but State.  Certainly a poor   
Employment of his Money, and a worse of their Time.  
</p><p>266.  But that any one Man should make Work for so  
many; or rather keep them from Work, to make up a Train,  
has a Levity and Luxury in it very reprovable, both in   
Religion and Government.  
</p><p>267.  But even in allowable Services it has an humbling  
Consideration, and what should raise the Thankfulness of  
the Great Men to him that has so much better'd their   
Circumstances, and Moderated the Use of their Dominion over  
those of their own Kind.  
</p><p>268.  When the poor Indians hear us call any of our Family  
by the Name of Servants, they cry out, What, call Brethren  
Servants! We call our Dogs Servants, but never Men.  The  
Moral certainly can do us no Harm, but may Instruct us to  
abate our Height, and narrow our State and Attendance.  
</p><p>269.  And what has been said of their Excess, may in some  
measure be apply'd to other Branches of Luxury, that set ill  
Examples to the lesser World, and Rob the Needy of their  
Pensions.  
</p><p>270.  GOD Almighty Touch the Hearts of our Grandees  
with a Sense of his Distinguish'd Goodness, and that true  
<pb n="414"/>   
End of it; that they may better distinguish themselves in  
their Conduct, to the Glory of Him that has thus liberally  
Preferr'd them, and the Benefit of their fellow Creatures.  
    OF REFINING UPON 0THER MEN'S ACTIONS OR INTERESTS<lb/>  
</p><p>271.  This seems to be the Master-Piece of our Politicians;  
But nobody shoots more at Random, than those Refiners.  
</p><p>272.  A perfect Lottery, and meer Hap-Hazard.  Since the  
true Spring of the Actions of Men is as Invisible as their  
Hearts; and so are their Thoughts too of their several  
Interests.  
</p><p>273.  He that judges of other Men by himself, does not  
always hit the Mark, because all Men have not the same  
Capacity, nor Passions in Interest.  
</p><p>274.  If an able Man refines upon the Proceedings of an  
ordinary Capacity, according to his own, he must ever miss  
it: But much more the ordinary Man, when he shall pretend  
to speculate the Motives to the able Man's Actions: For the  
Able Man deceives himself by making t'other wiser than he  
is in the Reason of his Conduct; and the ordinary Man  
makes himself so, in presuming to judge of the Reasons of  
the Abler Man's Actions.  
</p><p>275.  'Tis in short a Wood, a Maze, and of nothing are we  
more uncertain, nor in anything do we oftener befool ourselves.  
</p><p>276.  The Mischiefs are many that follow this Humor, and  
dangerous: For Men Misguide themselves, act upon false   
Measures, and meet frequently with mischievous Disappointments.  
</p><p>277.  It excludes all Confidence in Commerce; allows of no  
such Thing as a Principle in Practice; supposes every Man to  
act upon other Reasons than what appears, and that there is  
no such Thing as a Straightness or Sincerity among   
Mankind: A Trick instead of Truth.  
</p><p>278.  Neither, allowing Nature or Religion; but some  
Worldly Fetch or Advantage: The true, the hidden Motive  
to all Men to act or do.  
</p><p>279.  'Tis hard to express its Uncharitableness, as well as  
Uncertainty; and has more of Vanity than Benefit in it.  
</p><p>280.  This Foolish Quality gives a large Field, but let what  
I have said serve for this Time.  
<pb n="415"/>   
   OF CHARITY<lb/>  
</p><p>281.  Charity has various Senses, but is Excellent in all of  
them.  
</p><p>282.  It imports; first, the Commiseration of the Poor, and  
Unhappy of Mankind, and extends an Helping-Hand to  
mend their Condition.  
</p><p>283.  They that feel nothing of this, are at best not above  
half of Kin to Human Race; since they must have no Bowels,  
which makes such an Essential Part thereof, who have no  
more Nature.  
</p><p>284.  A Man, and yet not have the Feeling of the Wants or  
Needs of his own Flesh and Blood! A Monster rather!  
And may he never be suffer'd to propagate such an unnatural  
Stock in the World.  
</p><p>285.  Such an Uncharitableness spoils the best Gains, and  
two to one but it entails a Curse upon the Possessors.  
</p><p>286.  Nor can we expect to be heard of God in our  
Prayers, that turn the deaf Ear to the Petitions of the   
Distressed amongst our fellow Creatures.  
</p><p>287.  God sends the Poor to try us, as well as he tries them  
by being such: And he that refuses them a little out of the  
great deal that God has given him, Lays up Poverty in Store  
for his own Posterity.  
</p><p>288.  I will not say these Works are Meritorious, but dare  
say they are Acceptable, and go not without their Reward:  
Tho' to Humble us in our Fulness and Liberality too, we  
only Give but what is given us to Give as well as use; for  
if we are not our own, less is that so which God has   
intrusted us with.  
</p><p>289.  Next, CHARITY makes the best Construction of Things  
and Persons, and is so far from being an evil Spy, a Back-biter, or a Detractor, that it excuses Weakness, extenuates  
Miscarriages, makes the best of every Thing; forgives every  
Body, serves All, and hopes to the End.  
</p><p>290.  It moderates Extreams, is always for Expediences,  
labors to accommodate Differences, and had rather suffer  
than Revenge: And so far from Exacting the utmost  
Farthing, that it had rather lose than seek her Own Violently.  
<pb n="416"/>   
</p><p>291.  As it acts Freely, so, Zealously too; but 't is always  
to do Good, for it hurts no Body.  
</p><p>292.  An Universal Remedy against Discord, and an Holy  
Cement for Mankind.  
</p><p>293.  And lastly, 'Tis Love to God and the Brethren,  
which raises the Soul above all worldly Considerations; and,  
as it gives a Taste of Heaven upon Earth, so 't is Heaven  
in the Fulness of it hereafter to the truly Charitable here.  
</p><p>294.  This is the Noblest Sense Charity has, after which  
all should press, as that more Excellent Way.  
</p><p>295.  Nay, most Excellent; for as Faith, Hope and Charity  
were the more Excellent Way that Great Apostle discovered  
to the Christians, (too apt to stick in Outward Gifts and  
Church Performances) so of that better Way he preferred  
Charity as the best Part, because it would out-last the rest,  
and abide for ever.  
</p><p>296.  Wherefore a Man can never be a true and good  
Christian without Charity, even in the lowest Sense of it:  
And yet he may have that Part thereof, and still be none of  
the Apostle's true Christian, since he tells us, That tho' we  
should give all our Goods to the Poor, and want Charity  
(in her other and higher Senses) it would profit us nothing.  
</p><p>297.  Nay, tho' we had All Tongues, All Knowledge, and  
even Gifts of Prophesy, and were Preachers to others; ay,  
and had Zeal enough to give our Bodies to be burned, yet  
if we wanted Charity, it would not avail us for Salvation.  
</p><p>298.  It seems it was his (and indeed ought to be our)  
Unum Necessarium, or the One Thing Needful, which our  
Saviour attributed to Mary in Preference to her Sister  
Martha, that seems not to have wanted the lesser Parts of  
Charity.  
</p><p>299.   Would God this Divine Virtue were more implanted  
and diffused among Mankind, the Pretenders to Christianity  
especially, and we should certainly mind Piety more than  
Controversy, and Exercise Love and Compassion instead of  
Censuring and Persecuting one another in any Manner  
whatsoever.</p>
