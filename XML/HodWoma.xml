<div2 type="part" n="1.1" id="d4">

<p>THE medical man was holding my wrist and talking, and I was not
listening.  In the first place, I knew more about myself than he could tell
me; in the second, I should scarcely have understood what he was saying
if I had listened; and in the third, I was in so listless and indifferent a
condition of mind that I did not care to listen &mdash; did not care to answer --did not even care to look, as I was half unconsciously looking at the
dead brown leaves twisting in the eddying wind that whirled them down
the street.</p>
 <p>How dull it all looked! how dull the dragging days were! how I
was beginning to hate the big, obtrusive stone houses, and dread the long
gray patch of November sky showing itself over the roof, and alternately
drifting leaden clouds and drizzling leaden rain that made the wide
flagged pavement wet and shining with the slop of passing feet!  I had
always disliked the English winter, but I had never lost spirit in any
other winter as I had during this one.  Three months of its slow, dull
birth had added a hundred-fold to the listless misery which had become
almost a part of myself, and more than once I had almost hoped that its
ending would end my life.  If during that wretched autumn I had hoped
for anything, I had hoped for this, however vaguely; but the time had
often been when I had been so utterly indifferent to life or death that I
had not even cared to wish for either.</p>
 <p>I was in one of the worst of these moods to-day, and when the
doctor came it was at its strongest; so, as he talked to me I scarcely
listened, but looked out at the whirling leaves and dust in silence.  But,
though I was not listening, I could not help hearing his last words.</p>

 <p>"And as I told Mr. Leith," he was saying, "I cannot be
responsible for the result if you do not go."</p>
 <p>I began to listen then, though I scarcely knew why.</p>
 <p>"Go?" I repeated, "where am I to go, and why?"</p>
 <p>"Anywhere," was his emphatic reply.  "To the sea-side &mdash; to some
country place &mdash; to Yarmouth &mdash; to Swansea &mdash; to Switzerland &mdash; anywhere
away from London."</p>
 <p>"But why?" I asked again, beginning to wonder if the man did
not, after all, know something more than I had fancied.</p>
 <p>"Because," looking at me steadily, "if you remain here you will
die in two months, and Mr. Leith will blame me."</p>
 <p>"Will he?" I muttered, half unconsciously &mdash; "would he blame
anybody?"</p>
 <p>Doctor Branaird looked at me again &mdash; keenly this time &mdash; but he
said nothing.</p>
 <p>"And I may go anywhere out of London?" I said, after a short
pause.</p>
 <p>"Anywhere," he answered &mdash; "though I should advise the sea-side."</p>
 <p>"And you have spoken to my husband about it?"</p>
 <p>"Yes."</p>
 <p>"What did he say?"  I asked this unwillingly.</p>
 <p>"He said that he hoped the change would improve your
health."</p>
 <p>I looked out at the leaves in the street again.  It was so like him.
I knew what it meant.  I must decide for myself. He did not care.  I
might live if I cared for life &mdash; die if I chose.</p>
 <p>"I have a friend in Bamborough," I said after a while, "I will go
there."</p>
 <p>Dr. Branaird rose and took his hat.</p>
 <p>"Do," he advised &mdash; "Bamborough is just the place I should have
chosen for you, had I not thought it best to let you choose for yourself.
There is plenty of strong sea-breeze on the Cornish coast, and your
friend will improve the tone of your nervous system if she is anything of
a woman."</p>
 <p>So he left me, and so I turned to the street again and stared
blankly at the dead leaves and the patch of gray November sky.  But I
could not watch it long.  For the first time in many long months a
certain quiet excitement crept upon me, brought about by the thoughts
that drifted into my mind concerning my friend at Bamborough &mdash;
concerning Lisbeth Grant.</p>
 <p>We had been girls together and we had loved each other.  We had
been to each other what girls seldom are &mdash; we had been faithful, though
for four years Lisbeth had been a wife, and though she was the mother
of three children.  I knew she was faithful to me still, notwithstanding
that since her wedding-day we had never seen each other.</p>
 <p>"My hands are full, Gervase," she had written to me once, &mdash;
"and my heart is full too &mdash; to the brim.  Hugh and his children fill it as
they fill the hands.  They give me no time to stagnate.  They keep the
hands at work and the heart at work too &mdash; loving, hoping, thinking for
them &mdash; and I am sure the beating

 <pb n="560"/>   is more in time for the work the children bring.  But
they have not crowded you out, Gervase, you may be sure of that.
There is all the more room because they have made it larger.  The
children have made me love you more than ever."</p>
 <p>"Yes," I said to myself as I got up from my chair &mdash; "yes, I will
go to Lisbeth.  If I am going to die, better die with Lisbeth than
here."</p>
 <p>I did not love my husband &mdash; I had never loved him, I told myself.
It was not even love that had made us happy in the first months of our
marriage.  It had only been a weak mockery after all, and we had both
learned the truth too late.  Even the little child that had scarcely drawn a
breath could not soften our hearts towards each other.  And, worse than
this, out of my wretchedness had grown a shadow of sin and despair.  I
looked backwards sometimes to a fancy I had long left behind &mdash; to a
fancy that I thought my husband had long blotted out, and looking
backward so, I fell into a wonder at what now seemed my blindness.
That man would have loved me; there would have come no bitter words
from him, &mdash; that man would have been true to me through life and
death; <hi rend="italic">his</hi> love would never have died, burning out the more
rapidly for the very strength of its first flame.</p>
 <p>I did not often wait for my husband, but I waited for him that
night.  I wanted to tell him of my decision.  Not that I fancied he would
care for my absence or presence, &mdash; he was past that; we were both past
it.  Still I would show just so much grace as to make a pretense of
consulting him.</p>
 <p>"I am going to Bamborough," I said to him, "to visit Lisbeth
Grant.  Doctor Branaird advises me to do so."  And I glanced at him
carelessly.</p>
 <p>He had just come in, and tossed his hat upon a sofa in his careless
fashion, and now he was standing upon the hearth looking silently into
the fire.  He did not raise his eyes.</p>
 <p>"I hope you will find your health improved," he said.</p>
 <p>"I hope so," I returned briefly.</p>
 <p>But he was not quite easy, I could see, and I must confess to
some slight surprise.  The old black lines came out on his forehead, but
they were not angry lines; they were something new to me in their
changed expression.  He was so fidgety too, and even more taciturn than
usual.  But I took no notice of the change until after we had supped and
he had been reading for half an hour, when he suddenly broke the
silence by flinging his book upon the sofa after his hat and speaking to
me abruptly:</p>
 <p>"You are not worse than usual," he said, "are you?"  I did not
look up this time, but went on working steadily.  "I think not," I
answered; "I am sure not."</p>
 <p>I would not tell him the truth.  He should have had sight clear
enough to discover it for himself.</p>
 <p>He got up, and coming to the side of the hearth upon which I was
seated, caught hold of my netting silk, so stopping my work.</p>
 <p>"That is not true," he said &mdash; "it is one of your fables."</p>
 <p>"One of <hi rend="italic">my</hi> fables?" I returned quietly.</p>
 <p>He took hold of my hand and held it up so that my loose sleeve
fell back from my arm.</p>
 <p>"Yes," he said, "it is a fable.  Look at your arm &mdash; look at your
wrist, see how your bracelet fits it.  It was as round as a baby's
before" &mdash; and here seeming to recollect himself, he let my hand
drop.</p>
 <p>I looked at it myself as I settled my sleeve again, and as I looked
I smiled faintly.  My beautiful arms had been my pride once, and now
the heavy gold bracelet slipped loosely up and down over a white surface
that was little more than delicate skin and slender bone.  Perhaps after
all Doctor Branaird was right &mdash; I had better leave London.</p>
 <p>So the next day I went to Bamborough and Lisbeth.  But early in
the morning, as I stood before the mirror in my dressing-room, my
husband came to me.  I was surprised again, for of late there had been
so little pretense at sentiment between us that I had scarcely expected he
would care to make any farewells.  But I discovered in a very few
moments that this was what he had come for, and I felt myself excited
and nervous.  This surprised me too.  If we had loved each other I might
have understood the feeling; but since we did not love each other, what
could it mean?  He stood by my toilet-table, looking pale and agitated
for a few minutes after his entrance, and then he broke the awkward
silence:</p>
 <p>"You will need money," he began.</p>
 <p>I interrupted him.</p>
 <p>"No," I said, "you mistake.  I do not need any.  Thank
you."</p>
 <p>"Very well," he answered, "if that is the case I suppose it is
useless to offer you any.  But if you should require anything &mdash; wish
anything &mdash; I hope you will write to me about it."</p>
 <p>"Thank you again," I replied.  "I will write to you once a week
whether I wish anything or not."

 <pb n="561"/>  </p>
 <p>He lingered a few minutes longer and then turned to go.</p>
 <p>"Then as I shall not see you again I will bid you good-bye," he
said; "you will not return until &mdash; "</p>
 <p>"I recover or die," I interrupted.  "If Bamborough agrees with me
no better than London has done, Doctor Branaird says I shall die in two
months; so good-bye."</p>
 <p>I scarcely knew what feeling of desperation prompted me to make
a speech so reckless, but it was a feeling desperate enough.</p>
 <p>"Gervase!" he exclaimed.</p>
 <p>I would not look at him, but in the mirror I saw reflected on his
face a pallor as ashen as the pallor of death.  Sometimes in after months
I wished that I had looked at him more straightly.</p>
 <p>But he said nothing more &mdash; only waited a moment and then came
to my side.</p>
 <p>"Good-bye," he said.</p>
 <p>"Good-bye," I answered.  And the next moment he had touched
my cheek lightly with his lips and was gone.</p>
 <p>It was late when I reached Bamborough, and the tide was coming
in under a red, fog-obscured sun.  I looked out of the carriage window
as I drove from the station through the narrow streets, and looking I saw
little more than an immense expanse of sea, and a dry and wet brown
beach where fishermen were lounging, fishermen's children shouting and
playing, and fishermen's boats drawn up and fastened upon the sand with
chains.  I had always felt drawn towards the sea with a curious sense of
fascination, and this evening the fresh salt air blew so coolly upon my
cheeks that I had a quiet, half-defined feeling that I was not sorry I had
come to Bamborough.</p>
 <p>And at her open door Lisbeth stood ready to welcome me, and my
first glance showed me the same handsome womanly face and handsome
womanly figure, neither face nor figure a whit unfamiliar or a whit less
perfect for the crown of comely matronhood.  Two of her children clung
to her flowing skirts, her handsome baby clasped her neck, and as she
stood there smiling, I thought of Cordelia, and my heart warmed, --Lisbeth's strength and beauty always warmed it.</p>
 <p>She caught me in the one arm her child left free, and drew me
into the hall, pressing her warm red lips to mine.</p>
 <p>"My dear!" she said, "my dearest!" and it seemed as though she
had for the moment no other words to utter.  Her very voice warmed me
and put life into my veins.  I clung to her, enjoying her tender caresses,
but scarcely speaking a word, for at least Lisbeth understood what my
silence often meant and would not reproach me with it.  She did not ask
me any questions.  It seemed that in an instant she comprehended
everything, for she carried me to my room and took off my wrappings as
if I had been a child and she my mother.  I could not help noticing the
mother touch in her strong, gentle hands, and the mother tone in her
voice.</p>
 <p>"I will show you my children as soon as you are rested," she said,
"but you must rest first, Gervase.  Your husband's telegram did not
prepare me for seeing you look so changed."</p>
 <p>I felt a sudden pulsation of the heart.</p>
 <p>"My husband's telegram!" I said &mdash; "did he send one?"</p>
 <p>"Yes," she answered, "very early this morning, to say that you
were coming."</p>
 <p>I answered not a word.  Why had he done this?  If we had loved
each other, I should have known that it was because he could not brook
the thought of my meeting even the momentary chill of an unexpected
reception; but now the news only startled me.</p>
 <p>But though she spoke no word, Lisbeth's eyes lost nothing.  I
knew that she was searching me even when she spoke of other things,
and I knew that she was searching me when, after she had called her
children into the room, she stood near me in her royal mother pride,
with her little one in her fair, strong arms.</p>
 <p>"This is Hugh's boy," she said, touching the crumpled brown
curls of her eldest.  "Look up, Lawrence.  See, Gervase &mdash; Hugh's
eyes."</p>
 <p>They were magnificent children.  Lisbeth's perfect, healthful
nature had dowered them, and her unwarped, fearless soul shone out of
their childish eyes.  A desolate aching filled my breast as Lisbeth stood
near me with them.  Her life was so full &mdash; mine so empty.  I had never
loved children very much &mdash; had seen very little of them &mdash; and of my
own baby I had seen nothing but the poor little cold body I had for one
moment caught a glimpse of as Roger bent over it, shaken with a man's
terrible weeping.  I thought of this when I looked at Lisbeth's children,
but no tears came into my eyes.  I was wondering vaguely if I were a
wicked woman, and if my faded, empty life were my punishment.  I do
not think I had ever loved my baby or wept for it &mdash; Roger had ceased to
love me long before its birth, and I had learned to know what a mistake
I had made.</p>
 <p>But I lived again that day as I talked to Lisbeth.  We sat by the
fire after tea &mdash; she with her child on her breast, and I on a lounging

 <pb n="562"/>   chair near her, until the heavy fog had crept over the
sands and up into the little town, hiding even the red lights.  We had so
much to say, and we were alone together for the first time since we had
parted four years ago.  Hugh was absent on business, and the children
had gone to bed, so we went over the four years again &mdash; but until the
close of the evening Lisbeth said nothing of my husband.  At length,
after a silence, she lifted her eyes from the fire and looked at me
tenderly &mdash; searchingly &mdash; sadly.</p>
 <p>"And you are happy, Gervase?" she said.  I could not answer her
at first, but after a silent struggle the words came.  I could not tell a lie
to Lisbeth.</p>
 <p>"Happy! no, I am wretched."</p>
 <p>She looked at me for a moment longer and then spoke
again.</p>
 <p>"Gervase," she said, "if your little child had lived &mdash; "  I broke in
upon her, losing all self-control in a wild, sudden passion of
uncontrollable weeping.</p>
 <p>"No &mdash; no!" I cried out.  "Better as it is &mdash; far, far better as it
is."</p>
 <p>She moved her seat nearer to me and drew my head down upon
her lap with that tender mother touch.</p>
 <p>"Gervase," she said softly, "you think you do not love your
husband."</p>
 <p>"How did she know? for she seemed to understand me in an
instant.  I cried out again in the midst of my passionate sobs.</p>
 <p>"I have never loved him," I said &mdash; "he has never loved me.  It
was a mistake &mdash; it was all wrong from first to last, and he is wretched
too."</p>
 <p>It was all told then &mdash; the miserable secret that had grown to its
full strength in my own heart alone.  It was all told in one brief rash
speech &mdash; no, not quite all.  The rest would be a secret forever even from
Lisbeth.</p>
 <p>But I had wept myself into calmness at last, and we had been
talking together again, though with longer silence between our words
than there had been before, when in one of these silences I heard the
front door open, and felt a great rioting rush of the boisterous sea wind,
and there were sounds of a man's footsteps in the hall, and a man's
voice flung out a scrap of song: &mdash;  </p>
 <p>     "I am come, its deeps are learned &mdash; </p>
 <p>      Come, but there is naught to say:</p>
 <p>      Married eyes with mine have met,</p>
 <p>      Silence!  Oh!  I had my day,</p>
 <p>          Margaret, Margaret?" </p>
 <p>I was trembling from head to foot.</p>
 <p>"The rush of night wind has made you shiver," Lisbeth
said.</p>
 <p>But I scarcely heard her.</p>
 <p>"Who is it?" I asked breathlessly, though I knew so well &mdash; </p>

 <p>"It is Hugh's cousin," was her answer.  "I forgot to tell you.  It is
Ralph Gwynne."  </p>
</div2>

<div2 type="part" n="1.2" id="d5">

 <p>I HAD been nearly a month at Bamborough and my health was
improving slowly.  As Doctor Branaird had prophesied, Lisbeth had
strengthened my nerves.  Her perfect health and spirits roused me as
nothing else would have done, and I found myself growing stronger from
their force of example.  It might be, too, that since I was relieved from
my husband's presence a pressure was removed that had been too heavy
for me.  But, though I was so much better, I was creeping towards the
goal of health very slowly, and it seemed that a breath of renewed pain
would undo all.</p>
 <p>"You do not gain color fast enough," Lisbeth said to me one
morning.  "You do not get enough of the sea breeze.  You must go out
with Ralph again to-day, Gervase."</p>
 <p>I had often been out with Ralph.</p>
 <p>He looked up first at Lisbeth and then at me.</p>
 <p>"I am entirely at Mrs. Leith's service," he said, "and I think you
are right, Lisbeth; she needs more air."  I got up and walked to the
window, so that my back was turned to both of them, but Ralph Gwynne
followed me and looked out over my shoulder.</p>
 <p>Bamborough looked better than usual this morning.  An
adventurous ghost of sunshine was casting a clear bright light over the
brown sands and gray waves, and over the huts and boats and sturdy
brown-legged children.  It gave to Bamborough in November a pretense
of fresh animation that three times as much sunshine could not have been
able to give to London.  So I carelessly remarked to Ralph
Gwynne.</p>
 <p>"Is it bright enough to tempt you out &mdash; with me?" he said in a
low voice.</p>
 <p>He knew I was not strong enough to refuse.  He had not changed.
He was the very Ralph Gwynne who had led me, years before, into a
girlish romance that was like a dream of heaven, and had only ended
when Fate separated us and put between us and our untold love a whole
world.  But now it was different.  There was more than a whole world
between us; there was the past, the present, and the future.  I at least
had suffered since we bade each other an indefinite farewell &mdash; I at least
could not love as I had

 <pb n="563"/>
once loved.  Sometimes before the very thought of love my whole nature
rose up and battled fiercely.  At first I think that I was only indifferent;
but in the end I fancied that this man understood me a little, and
sorrowed a little over the woman's blunder I had made.</p>
 <p>"Let us ask no questions of each other," he had said to me once.
"We have both suffered.  Let us trust each other."</p>
 <p>It was just what I needed.  I should never have told him what I
felt, but I was not sorry that one human soul understood the misery the
dragging days held for me.  So this morning as we walked along the
beach we were both silent.  It was our custom to be oftener silent than
inclined to speak.  We both listened to the moan of the breakers and
watched the long line of foam out at sea; and at last both by one accord
stopped where a cluster of rocks sheltered us from the wind.  I sat down,
but Ralph Gwynne remained standing, with his back against a rock and
his arms folded.  At length he spoke to me.</p>
 <p>"It is three years to-day," he said, "since you were
married."</p>
 <p>The sudden, hurried beating of my heart almost suffocated me.  I
had forgotten until this moment, and the rush of old memories
overpowered me.  I remembered the very day &mdash; just such a day as this,
with sunshine warming even the leaden November sky, and whitening
the piled edges of the clouds.  I had thought it bright then.  I
remembered too how the day had closed in as I stood at the window of
my new home with Roger's arms folded about me and his heart beating
against mine.  I could scarcely speak steadily, but I managed to do so at
length.</p>
 <p>"So long?" I said coldly; "yes, I believe you are right.  Where
were you?  How did you learn it?"</p>
 <p>He did not look at me; his eyes were fixed steadily on the
far-away white line of foam.</p>
 <p>"I was in Calcutta," he answered.  "The news had been a long
time on its way and reached me on this very day &mdash; the day that was to
be your wedding-day.  I shall not forget it easily."</p>
 <p>I dropped my glove, and as I stooped to pick it up a sudden
recollection flashed across my brain.  One day, three months after our
marriage, Roger had come home with a budget of news from Calcutta,
and among other things had referred to the intense heat and the
prevalence of sunstroke among the foreign inhabitants.</p>
 <p>"My informant is one of the travelers for Amboyse &amp; Derig," he
said, "and he tells me that the very day he left &mdash; the day we were
married, Gervase &mdash; one of the salesmen was struck down with it.  He
was talking to one of our clerks who had just arrived from England--talking about our wedding too, Hegblase says &mdash; and he saw the young
fellow change color and stagger, and in a minute more he fell like a
shot.  Gwynne his name was, I believe &mdash; Ralph Gwynne."</p>
 <p>So one man had suffered for me at least &mdash; one man's love had not
died a natural death in a few brief months.</p>
 <p>Ralph put his hand into his pocket and drew forth a letter.</p>
 <p>"This was handed to me last night," he said.  "It bears a London
post-mark."</p>
 <p>I did not offer to take it for a moment.  I knew he had searched
me to the core, that he had seen every fruitless pang and bitter
humiliation of the past two years.  My letters to my husband had been
regularly sent, but his answers had been few and far between, and my
pride had forced a fresh sting upon me even while I was otherwise
indifferent to the neglect.  So I hesitated now, and the next moment
Ralph Gwynne came to my side as if drawn there by an uncontrollable
impulse.  A gleam of light shot over his dark face.</p>
 <p>"You do not care to take it," he said.  "The very sight of it is a
new torture.  Let me throw it into the sea, Gervase."</p>
 <p>His vehemence actually startled me into self-control.  "That would
be a new reading of old laws," I said.  "No, give it to me."</p>
 <p>He submitted without a word.  But I did not read the letter.  It
had come too late for perusal, I said to myself.  So I held it in my hand
carelessly, making a show of an ease I could not feel.</p>
 <p>It was in my hand when we returned and I sat down before the
fire in Lisbeth's room.  The sea breeze had done me no good this
morning.  I was tired and worn out, and drooping into a chair before I
removed my wrappings, sat silent, resting my chin upon my hand and
holding the letter loosely.</p>
 <p>Lisbeth came in to find me sitting thus, and at her first glance at
me I saw a strange shadow cross her face.</p>
 <p>"Tired, Gervase?" she asked.</p>
 <p>"Yes," I answered briefly.</p>
 <p>She crossed the room to the fire and knelt down, on pretense of
brightening the hearth a little with the brush she held in her hand.  The
next minute she turned her fair, gracious face full upon me.

 <pb n="564"/>  </p>
 <p>"And you have not read your husband's letter?" she said.  "Why,
Gervase?"</p>
 <p>"Because I am not going to read it," I replied, and then, ruled by
some sudden wretched impulse, I flung it into the fire.</p>
 <p>But Lisbeth said nothing.  I wondered at the time whether it was
possible for her calm, healthful nature to comprehend the morbid misery
that possessed me.  I fancied not.  The broad, even current of her life's
affection had swept on undisturbed, bearing on its smooth surface many
flowers.  She could not understand me and my weak miseries and
weaker regrets.</p>
 <p>I hid my face in my hands when she left the room, and abandoned
myself to thought.  I could not explain why it was that during this month
at Bamborough I had scarcely once thought of returning to London and
my husband.  If ever my mind had recurred to the thought, I had shrunk
from it with a misery almost intense.  I felt that I could not go back now
unless, as I had hoped, in a coffin, shut out forever from his
sight.</p>
 <p>As I sat by the fire I was wondering vaguely how he would meet
me if treated thus &mdash; whether he would be touched for a moment with
some remembrance of those first days of our marriage, when we had at
least fancied we loved each other.</p>
 <p>Two hot tears falling upon my hand startled me from my reverie
just in time to hear Lisbeth coming down stairs with her child in her
arms, and singing to it softly.  Should we have loved each other better --Roger and I &mdash; if my baby had not died, &mdash; I asked myself with a
pang.</p>
 <p>Lisbeth came in and sat down near me again, still singing softly,
still holding her baby upon her shoulder as she rocked her chair.  O how
I envied her her strength and happiness!  She was so strong and happy;
her handsome baby was so light a burden in her arms; her quietly busy
ways so womanly gracious.  I looked at her lovely, clear-browed face,
and at the coronal of thick light-brown braids across her stately head; I
looked at her peaceful eyes, and the soft mouth that seemed made for
children's kisses, and, remembering her girlhood, gave the palm to the
beauty of her mother life.</p>
 <p>Her calm, radiant face struck me to the heart's core.  Often
during the last year I had told myself that I was only one of the many,
that my mistake was only the mistake all women suffer from &mdash;  the
mistake of hoping for a happiness the world cannot hold.  But Lisbeth
broke down my theory.</p>
 <p>I did not write to London again.  The correspondence had only
been a matter of courtesy at first, and a shadow of neglect could end
it.</p>
 <p>Ralph Gwynne did not go away, as Lisbeth had told me he
intended doing.  He had changed his mind, he said.  Bamborough agreed
with him, and the India house had prolonged his furlough in
consideration of his past services and present ill health.  He did not look
ill, I thought, and I told him so.  But he stayed at Bamborough from day
to day, and the longer he stayed the more strongly his old power
reasserted itself.  Not that I loved him.  I was past that.  Love could not
come back to me, but I had loved him once with all the fervor of a girl's
romance, and at least he loved me and had not forgotten the past.  One
tithe of such love as he poured at my feet, in actions that were unspoken
words, might have won me back to my husband and peace.</p>
 <p>I did not repulse him.  The listless wretchedness that ruled me
would have prevented that, even if there had not been a faint fascination
in the miserable aggrandizement of feeling that at least one man had been
true to me, and was true to me yet.  I used sometimes to wonder that
Lisbeth never guessed at the truth.  She rarely spoke to me of my
husband &mdash; never of Ralph Gwynne &mdash; and yet I was always conscious of
a restraining influence in her simple presence.  A glance from her would
check my recklessness.  She held me back by a thread when nothing else
on earth could have controlled me.</p>
 <p>And so the days drifted by, and I strolled upon the sands with my
old lover, and sat in the shelter of the rocks with him, and let him say
what he would, scarcely listening, as I watched the waves and the
incoming and outgoing boats and dipping sea-gulls.</p>
 <p>After my husband's letters ceased coming I did not grow better,
even slowly.  I grew nervous and restless &mdash; even more nervous and
restless than I had been in London.  The old red spot came back upon
each cheek, I did not sleep well, and when night came on I often spent
hours at my window watching the driving clouds, and listening to the
chanting of the fishermen in the late-returning Bamborough boat.</p>
 <p>I was sitting thus one night when I heard a low knock at my door,
and opened it to find Lisbeth standing there, shawl-wrapped and without
a light.</p>
 <p>"May I come in, Gervase?" she asked.</p>
 <p>I opened the door wider that she might pass. </p>

 <pb n="565"/>
 <p>"Of course," I said; "you know that.  What is it, Lisbeth?"</p>

 <p>"It is nothing," she answered &mdash; "only that I heard you moving
and thought I would come and sit with you.  Hugh is out."</p>
 <p>We both went back to the window, and she knelt down in a girlish
fashion of hers, resting an arm upon the window-ledge and turning her
fair face up to the night sky and the starlight.</p>
 <p>"I hope you are wrapped up well, Gervase," she said after a
while.</p>
 <p>"I am quite warm enough, thank you."</p>
 <p>"You must take care of yourself, you know," she said in her
sweet, even voice, "for your husband's sake."</p>
 <p>I smiled.</p>
 <p>"For my husband's sake," I said, "yes."</p>
 <p>"When he wrote to me last," she began, taking no notice of my
words.</p>
 <p>I started a little.</p>
 <p>"When he wrote to you!" I exclaimed.  "When did he write to
you?"</p>
 <p>"Yesterday," she said; "last week, the week before &mdash; every week
since you have been here.  He was afraid you would not speak quite
freely of your wants, and he was anxious to hear all about your illness,
and to be quite sure that no wish was left ungratified."</p>
 <p>I leaned back in my chair, and held to the cushioned arms for
support.  My breath was coming quickly and a sudden heat had flashed
to my face.  I could not understand this, but a strange feeling of joy took
possession of me &mdash; though I told myself that I did not love this man and
had never loved him.</p>
 <p>"Your illness has been a great anxiety to him, Gervase."  Lisbeth
went on still, with her face turned upward in the twilight&mdash;
"and it has
troubled him more since you came here.  He has felt your absence
deeply.</p>
 <p>I did not speak in answer, but I was weak woman enough to feel
another thrill of mingled pain and pleasure.  Lost as the past irrevocably
was, it had yet a strong power over me.  As there never was a husband
colder than mine, so there had never been a bridegroom more
impassioned in affection; and, even in this winter of indifference, I could
remember days in the dead summer when his untiring love had wakened
me to a happiness almost divine, ephemeral as it had proved.  Glancing
at Lisbeth, the thought struck me that under her quiet speeches and quiet
manner there lay a deeper thought for me than I had fancied, and then
there flashed across my mind a remembrance of times when she had
silently stood between me and the man who was my evil genius.</p>
 <p>At this moment I recognized the man's power for evil over me as
I had never done before, and a curious sense of repugnance came upon
me with my recollection of something I had sometimes seen sleeping in
his quiet persistence.  I could not understand the influence that stung me
to anger and roused my pride, but I never failed to succumb to it,
nevertheless, and it invariably roused me to some fresh rashness of
speech or action.  But though I said little to Lisbeth, the pang of
remembrance softened my heart, and before she left me I had made up
my mind to write a few words to my husband, at least; and when she
was gone I drew my desk towards me and wrote them &mdash; only a few
words.</p>
 <p>"Your wife Gervase."</p>
 <p>I had not ended a letter thus for two years, and I hesitated a
moment before I wrote the signature.  But despite the lingering of pen
over paper they were written at last, and as I looked at them I felt the
warm blood beat into my cheeks, and my head drooped upon my clasped
hands.  Should I send them or not?  I thought of Ralph Gwynne, and of
what I had suffered, and my letter's fate was almost sealed.  But even as
I paused, a soft little cry from Lisbeth's room broke upon my ear.  It
was hushed the next moment, but the tiny voice had turned the
scale.</p>
 <p>I put the letter into its envelope and sealed it with a new
resolution.  I would try to retrieve something of the past, at least.  I
would do no new wrong.  I would cherish no bitterness against my dead
child's father.  If I could not be happy I would endeavor to be patient.
It might not be for long &mdash; it could not be for long, I knew.</p>
 <p>"I will give it to Ralph Gwynne to post in the morning," I said
aloud &mdash; "it will show him that &mdash; "</p>
 <p>I did not finish my sentence, because I dared not, even in the
silence of my room.  Even to the readers of this record I have not told
all that my reckless misery drove me to.  I could not justify my
weakness, and otherwise had better be silent.</p>
 <p>The sun was shining bright and warm into the breakfast-room
when I went down with my letter in the morning, and the salt sea wind
blew fresh through the open window up from the beach.  As I had lain
awake in the night a change seemed to have come over me, and under its
influence I forgot the dull November days and pitiless November skies in
this one rare chance of morning warmth and sunlight. </p>

 <pb n="566"/>
 <p>Ralph Gwynne was alone in the room, his stubborn persistency
showing itself as it always did in his waiting for my coming.</p>
 <p>I went to him at once, holding my letter in my hand.</p>
 <p>"I have a letter here I am anxious shall reach London to-night," I
said, looking straight into his face.  "I thought I would give it into your
charge at once, as you generally go into Bamborough earlier than any
one else.  Will you post it for me?"</p>
 <p>He held out his hand and took it from me, slipping it into his vest
pocket with scarcely a glance, but I knew that he had seen the
superscription by the instantaneous change in his face.  It was a very
slight change, almost an imperceptible one in fact, but I saw it
notwithstanding and caught its meaning.</p>
 <p>"I envy your husband," he had said to me once &mdash; "I pity him &mdash; I
hate him."</p>
 <p>And just at the moment this abrupt, passionate speech, which was
only one of many such, was embodied in the faint change that passed
over his dark face, as he leaned upon the window ledge and looked out
calmly enough at the fishermen working upon the beach.</p>
 <p>He did not even refer to the letter in the commonplace
conversation we drifted into.  The momentary shadow left him so
entirely that I found myself wondering if he had altogether forgotten it.
But though he did not refer to the letter, before Lisbeth came in he spoke
of my husband.</p>
 <p>"I did not know," he said, after an interval of silence &mdash;  "until
yesterday I did not know that your husband had ever visited
Bamborough."</p>
 <p>The words were so unexpected that I glanced up quickly to see
what they might signify, but to judge from his careless, averted face,
they might have held no significance at all.</p>
 <p>"I did not know," I said coldly, "that my husband had visited
Bamborough at all.  If he has been here I have been kept in ignorance of
the fact."</p>
 <p>"He has been here," he said indifferently, "often."</p>
 <p>I did not make any reply.  I knew well enough that he intended to
force me to questioning him, but I was not in the mood to question, and
so was silent.  If my husband had been to Bamborough in secret,
whatever his motive might be, he had hidden it from me, and the
mystery was only a new thread in the web of his distrust, so it might
pass.  It was only a fresh sting, but I felt it at the time all the more
deeply because of my last night's resolve and the three words with which
I had ended my letter.  I made no comment, I did not even speak of it to
Lisbeth when she came.  I buried it in my own heart, as I was prone to
bury my miseries.</p>
 <p>When breakfast was over I wandered out on the beach alone.  I
did not often walk alone, but this morning even Lisbeth herself would
have been unwelcome.</p>
 <p>Down upon the sands where the rocks clustered together, and
where the boats oftenest came up to the little cove, was my favorite
resting-place, and there I took my seat as usual upon a large flat stone.
The brawny fishermen knew me, and the barelegged, shouting children
knew me too, and as I sat there there were few who passed me without a
good-natured greeting.  I had amused myself with watching them often,
but they did not amuse me now.  I was dull and wretched again.  It was
a trivial thing to be wretched about, this slight concealment, which might
have had no motive, but it had dampened my spirit and made me
indifferent and miserable once more.  The brown, bare-legged fishermen
passed to and fro, mending their nets in the sun, and wading in and out
of the water, but I scarcely saw them; the children shouted and chased
each other like happy, uncouth young savages, but I did not notice their
play.  I saw nothing but the sea and sky, and a boat whose tiny sail
seemed growing larger as it neared the shore, until a shadow fell before
me, and I glanced up half impatiently and saw Ralph Gwynne.  He took
a seat at my side, and then spoke to me carelessly.</p>
 <p>"I thought I should find you here," he said.</p>
 <p>"You did not go to Bamborough, then," was my cold
comment.</p>
 <p>"No," hesitatingly and slowly; "I thought I would see you
first."</p>
 <p>I looked out at the boat again absently; it was coming nearer to
the land, and I felt a faint sort of interest in it, because I saw a woman at
the prow, and the woman had a child thrown over her shoulder.</p>
 <p>"Why?" I asked.</p>
 <p>He did not answer me at first, but turned on his elbow, and spoke
to one of the net-mending fishermen who sat not far from us.</p>
 <p>"Who is coming in, Gunnle?" he asked; "your women don't fish,
do they?"</p>
 <p>The man touched his hat good-naturedly.</p>
 <p>"Some on 'em does," he said; "this un doent though, this un 'ats
comin [sic] in.  She's bin o'er to Banbro' fur work.  It's Janey &mdash; Janey
an' th child, little Roger."</p>
 <p>I moved impatiently, though I scarcely knew

 <pb n="567"/>   why.  The boat was almost upon the beach, and the
next minute the man who was in it jumped out and waded up, dragging it
in by its chain with a great splash of the sea water, and then the woman
turned her head, and as she got up I saw her distinctly.  She was a
handsome young creature, tall and straight and shapely, and very unlike
the rest of the Bamborough women, with her long violet eyes, and thick
curling red brown hair.</p>
 <p>"Look at her, Gervase," Ralph Gwynne whispered, "and look at
the child."</p>
 <p>He had no need to tell me to do so, for I was looking at them
both.  There was a certain proud, steadfast sadness which attracted my
attention in the girl's face, and I could not help noticing that she did not
look at any of the bystanders when she replied to their friendly greetings.
But as she passed the place where I sat my eye caught hers, perhaps
because I had looked at her so steadily, and I observed that the instant
she saw me a hot deep color ran up to her forehead, and she walked on
hurriedly, holding her child more tightly.</p>
 <p>As soon as she was gone Ralph Gwynne turned again to the old
fisherman, and spoke to him just as he had spoken before.</p>
 <p>"She's a handsome creature," he said, "and the child is handsome
too.  Who is her husband?"</p>
 <p>The old fellow glanced up at me.</p>
 <p>"Savin' the lady's presence," he said in a low voice, "she haint
got none &mdash; Janey haint.  We're all sorry for her here.  There haint one
of us but is sorry for Janey.  She never was a bad 'un, but she was
handsome an' unfortnit, and she's seen a sight o' trouble.  She doent say
much to none on us, because she doent like to face us, but she knows we
feel friendly to'rds her, Janey does, and she knows we feel friendly
to'rds little Roger."</p>
 <p>"Roger?" I broke out abruptly, scarcely knowing what I
said.</p>
 <p>The old man looked up at me, rubbing his weather-beaten
forehead as if I puzzled him by my vehemence.</p>
 <p>"Yes'm," he said, "his name it's Roger Leith, and its named for --"</p>
 <p>I did not stop to hear the rest.  For a moment the whole horrible
truth flashed upon me, and I staggered to my feet blindly, clinging to
Ralph Gwynne, who had risen too.  "Come away," I said; "take me
away somewhere &mdash; farther down the beach &mdash; anywhere out of
sight."</p>
 <p>He did not speak to me, nor I to him, until he had half carried,
half dragged me to the very rock shelter where we had sat the day he
handed me my husband's letter, and there I dropped upon the sands,
hiding my wretched face in my hands.</p>
 <p>"Tell me the truth," I panted; "tell me &mdash;   You knew this!"</p>

 <p>He looked down at me with some vague pity in his eyes, and
though I knew that he would have forged a lie to suit his purpose, I
knew that this was no lie, and that he believed it even more steadfastly
than I did.</p>
 <p>"Yes," he answered, "I knew it."</p>
 <p>"And came to prove it to me?"</p>
 <p>"Yes."</p>
 <p>I knew then what I had never known before.  I knew that even in
my misery I had mocked myself with a delusion.  I knew that I had
never loved this man, even as I fancied I did, through the contrast of his
warmth with my husband's coldness; I knew that through all I had been
weaker than the weakest of women, for I had loved my husband and I
loved him still.</p>
 <p>I broke into a low, wretched, hysterical laugh.</p>
 <p>"You might have spared me this much," I said.  "If my ignorance
was not bliss, it was folly to be wiser than I was &mdash; to know more of my
humiliation than I did."</p>
 <p>"It would have been folly to let you add to the humiliation by
relenting towards the man who has trampled you in the dust," he said
passionately.  "I swore that you should not send this letter &mdash;  am I to
keep my oath?"</p>
 <p>I held out my hand for it.</p>
 <p>"No!" I cried out sharply, "give it to me."</p>
 <p>He handed it to me, and as I touched it the remembrance of what
it contained and how I had been duped rushed upon me with the force of
a whirlwind.  I tore it into a hundred pieces and scattered it on the
sand.</p>
 <p>"There," I said, "it is gone &mdash; forever."</p>
 <p>He came and bent over me, a little later, as I sat with my face
buried in my hands, and he touched my shoulder, for I did not look up
at him.</p>
 <p>"And you will listen to me, Gervase!" he said.</p>
 <p>I shook his hand off quickly, for his touch angered me &mdash; but I
had made up my mind.</p>
 <p>"Yes," I answered him, "I will listen." </p>
 <p>                .   .   .   .   .   .   . </p>
 <p>I sat crouched before my window, feeling cold and sick and weak,
but still with my mind full of my desperate resolve.  I had written my
farewell letter to my husband, and it lay upon the table.  I had written
my

 <pb n="568"/>   farewell letter to Lisbeth and told her all, in the faint
hope that Lisbeth would believe what no one else on earth would believe
&mdash; in the faint hope that Lisbeth would believe my solemn word, when I
told her that even at the worst I should not be so utterly lost as the world
would deem me.  I had laid my things all back into my trunks, even to
the merest trifle.  The very dress I wore was one I had myself
purchased.  I had not retained in my possession a single thing my
husband had ever given to me &mdash; not even the sapphire ring that had been
the pledge of our betrothal.  And now that all my preparations were
made, I was waiting at my opened window for the signal that was to
come to me from the beach below.  I had thrown myself adrift on the
broad ocean of chance, and the waves might fling me upon what shore
they would, for the momentary passion of misery had settled into passive
despair.</p>
 <p>"When women lose all, as I am doing," I had said to Ralph
Gwynne that night, "they generally have something at stake, some love
or hope, but I have none; I had risked all I had to risk, and lost all I had
to lose.  You are clinging to a mad hope if you think to win me even in
the course of time.  I tell you I shall never love you.  I will leave
England with you, not because I love you, but because I love my
husband and cannot bear to see his face again.  I will be honest with
you.  I take all to give nothing.  If you love me enough to help me, well
and good; if not, leave me here and I will go out into the world
alone."</p>
 <p>And he had held to his purpose and agreed.  Of course he did not
believe me strong enough to battle against his stubborn persistence, and
of course he was false in professing to be honest; but I knew my own
steady strength of obstinate endurance, and he did not.  And here, in the
dim moonlight that streamed through the curtain of sea fog into my
window, I was waiting for his signal, and Lisbeth was sleeping in the
next room with her baby on her breast and her little children near her.  I
thought of the abasement I had seen in the handsome girl-face a few
hours before, and I thought of the child who had looked at me over his
mother's shoulder in his fearless baby way.</p>
 <p>"Roger's baby &mdash; Roger's!"</p>
 <p>I hid my face in my hands, stifling the low cry that burst from
me.  I remembered the one moment, on the night of my baby's birth,
when the delirious mists had cleared away from my brain, and I had seen
my husband bending over the tiny form that lay upon the white
pillow.</p>
 <p>"If my baby had lived," I said aloud, "if my baby had lived I
might have been like Lisbeth."</p>
 <p>I got up after this and walked across the floor and back again a
dozen times.  I was wondering what he would say when Lisbeth gave
him the letter, and whether there would be a shadow of self-reproach in
his memory of the past.  I did not ask myself how my life was to be
spent.  I had a vague feeling that it could not last long, but I asked
myself a hundred times how my husband would spend his.  He would
not mourn for me, I told myself, and some better woman might make
him happy; but even in this my worst and most reckless mood, my heart
cried out aloud at the thought.  I had ceased pacing the floor and gone
back to the window again.  I had even waited in the chill moonlight an
hour when the signal came, and I rose with a fierce pulsation of the heart
to obey its summons.  I took up my shawl from the bed and folded it
around me; I went to the table where my husband's letter lay and I bent
over and kissed it &mdash; my last farewell.  I caught a glimpse of my face in
the glass as I did so, and saw that there was a great hollow purple ring
about my eyes and a deathly pallor on my cheeks.  I laid my husband's
letter back and crossed the room to the door; as I laid my hand upon the
key I heard a light footstep in the corridors, and as I turned the handle
and stepped out I started backward with a low cry, for I stood face to
face with &mdash; Lisbeth.</p>
 <p>We looked at each other breathlessly for an instant in dead silence
&mdash; I at her with a wild intense, unreasonable longing for some hope that
might rescue me even at this late hour &mdash; she at me with nothing in her
tender, dilated eyes but pity and wonder and love.  Then she broke the
strange stillness in a hurried, terrified voice.</p>
 <p>"Gervase," she said, "Gervase, what does this mean?"</p>
 <p>I met her gaze steadily.  I do not think I was in my right
senses.</p>
 <p>"I am going away," I said, and my voice sounded strange and
unnatural even to myself.</p>
 <p>Another moment and she caught me in her arms as if I had been a
child, and so drew me into the room and closed the door.</p>
 <p>Her face was white as death.  She was woman enough to read at a
glance how matters stood, but her purely healthful nature could not at
once comprehend a recklessness so desperate. </p>

 <pb n="569"/>
 <p>"What do you mean?" she demanded &mdash; "I cannot believe &mdash; where
are you going?"</p>
 <p>I answered her as steadily as before.</p>
 <p>"I am going away," I said, "where I do not know &mdash; I do not even
care.  I am going away from England with Ralph Gwynne.  I am going
away with him that I may be lost to my husband forever.  You think I
am a wicked woman, Lisbeth, and so I am, but God has laid his hand
upon me and I am under a curse."</p>
 <p>She gazed at me as if she believed I had gone mad indeed.</p>
 <p>"You are going away?" she cried out &mdash; "You!  Gervase!
Gervase!"</p>
 <p>Nothing more; but the fullness of divine pity and passionate
appeal in her voice, in her face, even in her clasped hands, overpowered
me.  I sank into a chair, holding to its arms to steady myself.</p>
 <p>"Lisbeth," I said, feeling as though I had turned to ice, "I saw a
woman upon the beach to day [sic]  &mdash; a woman with a little child in her
arms &mdash; and the child's name is Roger Leith.  You cannot save me,
Lisbeth &mdash; let me go."</p>
 <p>She caught me in her arms and held me.  She thought that I was
dying &mdash; I thought I was, myself, and it was only the sudden flush of
comprehension in her face that helped me to retain my
consciousness.</p>
 <p>"Who told you that the child's name was Roger Leith?" she cried
out &mdash; "Who could be so cruel as to lead you astray with that?  My poor
Gervase, tell me!"</p>
 <p>I rested my face upon her bosom, panting for breath in the
darkness.</p>
 <p>"It is true," I gasped; "Ralph Gwynne was with me and he knew.
One of the fishermen upon the beach told us the child's name and its
mother's history."</p>
 <p>"Listen," she said, and her voice rang out like a command, "listen
to me.  Some one has told you a lie.  <hi rend="italic">I</hi> can tell you the girl's
history &mdash; no one knows it better than I, Gervase, as no one knows better
that the truth should prove to you the wrong you have done your
husband.  It was not through him that this girl was lost &mdash; it was through
him that she was saved.  He found her in London, wandering in the
streets with her child in her arms, and he saved her from despair and
death.  He brought her here &mdash; back to her home &mdash; and helped her in her
wretchedness so mercifully that she prayed from him upon her knees that
her child might bear his name, since it could claim no other.  He has
guarded her ever since: he has saved two human souls &mdash; one for the sake
of the little child who died, Gervase &mdash; his little child and yours."</p>
 <p>In an instant it flashed upon me that I had not waited to hear the
end of the fisherman's explanation.  And he would doubtless have
cleared away my misery with the next word, for they must all know the
story, even the roughest of them &mdash; the story of my husband's generous
deed.  And then the thought that I had not been deemed worthy to hear it
struck me to the heart.</p>
 <p>"I did not dream of this," I said; "how could I? he has told me
nothing.  He has never loved me even well enough to trust me so
far."</p>
 <p>He has loved you always," Lisbeth said, "though you have both
been wrong; he has loved you better than you have loved him, and he
has been wretched through your distrust and coldness.  It was his despair
that made him seek me when he brought Janey to Bamborough.  He
knew that you had loved me, and so came to me for comfort and help.
And you would go away &mdash; you, with the past all unredeemed, and your
husband's love unsought, &mdash; you, with your little child's white soul to
hold you to purity and faith!  Gervase!  Gervase!"</p>
 <p>There was a moment's silence in which I crouched shuddering in
my chair, my face buried in my hands!  And then there came beneath the
window the sound of a man's footsteps, and the sound of a man speaking
in a low voice.  His words might have been an echo of Lisbeth's but that
the one voice was the voice of the tempter, and the other the voice of the
rescuer.</p>
 <p>"Gervase!  Gervase!"</p>
 <p>It was Ralph Gwynne.</p>
 <p>My strength was ebbing away fast.  I could not have spoken to
him if I would; but Lisbeth rose and went to the window, as calm in her
womanly strength of purity as ever she had been in her calm woman's
life.</p>
 <p>"Ralph!" she said, her grave, pure-toned voice dropping upon the
still night air like the voice of a spirit, "Ralph, Gervase is here &mdash; with
<hi rend="italic">me</hi>."</p>
 <p>He did not reply, and not another word was uttered between them.
She came back to me as his footsteps died away in the distance, and
found me shivering from head to foot, yet burning with sudden
fever.</p>
 <p>"Better to have let me go, Lisbeth," I said weakly, "better to have
let me go away and die, for I should have died, Lisbeth &mdash; I am dying
now."  And as she caught me in her arms again the dark room seemed to
blaze up into sudden light and then fade out, and as the shadows closed
around me I felt that the end of life had come. </p>

 <pb n="570"/>
 <p>Weeks of interminable wanderings in some mysterious, barren
land of misery, &mdash; weeks of interminable watching hideous panoramas
that seemed to pass and repass and pass again, &mdash; weeks, nay, it appeared
ages, of suffering through old wrongs, and loves and hates, &mdash; and weeks
of waiting restlessly with frantic impatience for something which never
came and never would come &mdash; for some stopping-place or shutting out
of the crowding faces I did not know and was constantly scanning and
striving to remember &mdash; weeks of such suffering, with now and then a
blank or a dim sense of struggling consciousness, and then one day a
long blank ended by my opening my eyes heavily, and dimly seeing
Lisbeth bending over the bed upon which I lay.</p>
 <p>I did not speak to her &mdash; I could not.  My weakness was so great,
my power over my languid limbs so utterly lost, that I gazed up at her
without even trying to address her, only thinking half unconsciously of
stories I had heard of people who had fallen into trances and retained the
spirit of life without the power of motion.  Was I in such a trance?  No,
for Lisbeth was speaking to me and I could hear her quite distinctly,
though I could not reply.</p>
 <p>"You must not try to speak, Gervase," she was saying &mdash; "you
must not try to think, even.  You are getting better and you must
sleep."</p>
 <p>I heard her first words plainly enough, but as she ended her voice
seemed to die away into the distance, and as my eyes drooped she was
lost to me.</p>
 <p>This was my first awakening after the night I had fallen into her
arms, and after this first awakening there were no more of the
interminable wanderings, though I seldom was strong enough to open my
eyes.  But as I lay there with my eyes shut I grew strong enough in a
day or two to listen to the hushed voices of the people who were in my
room, and in the end to distinguish them one from another.  I heard
Lisbeth's voice often, calm and low and sweet.  I heard Hugh's softened
until it was like a woman's.  I heard a voice I knew to be the doctor's.  I
heard other voices strange to me, but first of all and before all I heard
my husband's.  I did not hear it once or twice, or at stated intervals: day
and night without an hour of absence.  I felt Lisbeth's touch often: I felt
Hugh's.  I felt hands that were kindly and tender enough, but there was
one hand that never touched me without drawing me farther from the
grave and nearer to life, and this hand was my husband's.</p>
 <p>And at length I found myself awake again, far into the night, and
this time my eyes fell first upon my husband seated at my bedside, and
when I made an effort to speak I found strength enough to utter a single
word:</p>
 <p>"Lisbeth."</p>
 <p>He brought her to my side with a gesture, and as he turned
towards the light his haggard face was a wonder to me; but I had only
power, when Lisbeth bent over me, to say to her one thing, in a whisper
so weak that I scarcely could hear it myself.</p>
 <p>"If I live," I said, "he must know.  If &mdash; I die, it &mdash; cannot matter.
Let him love &mdash; me &mdash; if he will."</p>
 <p>The weak tears began to roll down my cheeks, and I could not
stop their flow, and I saw that Lisbeth's tears were falling too.</p>
 <p>"You will not die," she said; "you will live to retrieve the past.
He knows all &mdash; he read your letter.  Roger, speak to her."</p>
 <p>He laid his haggard face near mine upon the pillow, and the old
glow of our bridal days was in his eyes.</p>
 <p>"You shall not die," he said, "you cannot die &mdash; you are mine &mdash; I
love you.  I have followed you down to the valley of death, and brought
you back, and I claim you, as God is merciful.  I have loved you
through all our misery, but I was not fit to understand your woman's
heart.  The blame was mine, not yours.  God forgive me for the wrong I
did your tenderness.  You love me &mdash; yes, you love me.  You must love
me &mdash; you cannot help it.  Do not try to speak.  This shall be my first
sacrifice, that I will deny myself the bliss of hearing your voice, since to
speak might fatigue you.  Do not try to speak, but if you love me and
would give me hope, lay your hand upon my cheek."</p>
 <p>Not a word of the wrong I had done, not a word of the misery I
had wrought for him, not a word of distrust or reproach: I had come up
from the grave and the gates of Heaven seemed opening to me.  I tried
to speak, but could not, for my soul was full and overflowing with the
passion of a joy too divine for human words to express.  But I found
strength at last to move, and stirring a little in the very faintness of
happiness, I laid my hand upon my husband's cheek, my head upon his
arm, and so was clasped to his breast.</p>
 <p>He loved me &mdash; he had loved me always, though he had tortured
himself with the belief that my love for him had died.  He was unlike
most men, as I was unlike most women; he could not speak in common
words of what lay so deeply locked in his heart.  But tortured as he was,
he had hoped as I never hoped.

<pb n="571"/>    He had come to Lisbeth for comfort because she loved
me, and she had given it to him.  Lisbeth knew what I did not know
myself, that it was my distrust and love that was wearing my life away,
and in her silent woman fashion, she watched and restrained me when I
was unconscious of her power.</p>
 <p>I did not see Ralph Gwynne again until three happy years had
passed, and in passing had made my life like Lisbeth's.  Then, as I stood
one night in the brightly-lighted hall of our home, holding my child in
my strong arms, as I greeted my husband a man passed by upon the
pavement and looked in at me.  As the light from the hall lamp fell upon
his face I saw it was Ralph Gwynne, and that he knew me.</p>
