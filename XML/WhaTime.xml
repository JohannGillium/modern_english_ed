<p>MRS. LIDCOTE, as the huge, menacing mass of New York defined itself 
far off across the waters, shrank back into her corner of the 
deserted deck and sat listening with a kind of unreasoning terror 
to the steady onward drive of the screws. 
</p><p>She had set out on the voyage quietly enough,&mdash;in what she 
called her "reasonable" mood,&mdash;but the week at sea had given her 
too much time to think of things, had left her too long alone with 
the past. 
</p><p>When she was alone, it was always the past that occupied her.  
She couldn't get away from it, and she didn't any longer care to.  
During her long years of exile she had made her terms with it, had 
learned to accept the fact that it would always be there, huge, 
obstructing, encumbering, much bigger and more dominant than 
anything the future could possibly conjure up.  And, at any rate, 
she was sure of it, she understood it, knew how to reckon with it; 
she had learned to screen and manage and protect it as one does an 
afflicted member of one's family. 
</p><p>There had never been any danger of her being allowed to forget 
the past.  It looked out at her from the face of every 
acquaintance, it appeared suddenly in the eyes of strangers when a 
word enlightened them: "Yes, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Mrs. Lidcote, don't you know?"  
It had sprung at her the first day out, when, across the dining-room, from the captain's table, she had seen Mrs. Lorin Boulger's 
revolving eye-glass suddenly pause and the eye behind it grow as 
blank as a dropped blind.  The next day, of course, the captain had 
asked, "You know your ambassadress, Mrs. Boulger?" and she had 
replied that, No, she seldom left Florence, and hadn't been to Rome 
for more than a day since the Boulgers had been sent to Italy.  She 
was so used to these set phrases that it cost her no effort to 
repeat them.  And the captain had promptly changed the subject. 
</p><p>No, she didn't, as a rule, mind the <hi rend="italic">past</hi>, because she was 
used to it and understood it.  It was a great concrete fact in her 
path that she had to walk around every time she moved in any 
direction.  But now, in the light of the dreadful event that had 
summoned her from Italy,&mdash;the sudden, unanticipated news of her 
daughter's divorce from Horace Pursh and immediate remarriage with 
Wilbour Barkley,&mdash;the past, her own poor, miserable past, started 
up at her with eyes of accusation, became, to her disordered fancy, 
like the "afflicted" relative suddenly breaking away from nurses 
and keepers and publicly parading the horror and misery one had, 
all the long years, so patiently screened and secluded. 
</p><p>Yes, there it had stood before her through the long, agitated 
weeks since the news had come,&mdash;during her interminable journey 
from India, where Leila's letter had overtaken her, and the 
feverish halt in her apartment in Florence, where she had had to 
stop and gather up her possessions for a fresh start,&mdash;there it had 
stood grinning at her with a new balefulness which seemed to say, 
"Oh, but you've got to look at me <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, because I'm not only 
your own past, but Leila's present." 
</p><p>Certainly it was a master-stroke of those arch-ironists of the 
shears and spindle to duplicate her own story in her daughter's.  
Mrs. Lidcote had always <pb n="345"/>  fancied somewhat grimly that, 
having so signally failed to be of use to Leila in other ways, she 
would at least serve her as a warning.  She had even at times 
consciously abstained from defending herself, from making the best 
of her case, had stoically refused to plead extenuating 
circumstances, lest Leila's impulsive sympathy should lead to 
deductions that might react disastrously on her own life.  And now 
that very thing had happened, and Mrs. Lidcote could hear the whole 
of New York saying with one voice: "Yes, Leila's done just what her 
mother did.  With such an example, what else could you expect?" 
</p><p>Yet if she had been an example, poor woman, she had been an 
awful one; she had been, one would have supposed, of more use as a 
deterrent than a hundred blameless mothers as incentives.  For how 
could any one who had seen anything of her life in the last 
eighteen years have the courage to repeat so disastrous an 
experiment? 
</p><p>Well, logic in such cases didn't count, example didn't count, 
nothing, she supposed, counted but having the same impulses in the 
blood; and that presumably was the dark inheritance she had 
bestowed upon her daughter.  Leila hadn't consciously copied her; 
she had simply "taken after" her, had been, so to speak, a 
projection of her own long-past rebellion. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote had deplored, when she started, that the <hi rend="italic"> 
Utopia</hi> was a slow steamer, and would take eight full days to bring 
her to her unhappy daughter; but now, as the moment of reunion 
approached, she would willingly have turned the boat about and fled 
back to the high seas.  It was not only because she felt still so 
unprepared to face what New York had in store for her, but because 
she needed more time to dispose of what the <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> had already 
given her.  The past was bad enough, but the present and future 
were worse, because they were less comprehensible, and because, as 
she grew older, surprises and inconsequences troubled her more than 
the worst certainties. 
</p><p>There was Mrs. Boulger, for instance.  In the light, or rather 
the darkness, of new developments, it might really be that Mrs. 
Boulger had not meant to cut her, but had simply failed to 
recognize her.  Mrs. Lidcote had arrived at this extraordinary 
hypothesis simply by listening to the conversation of the persons 
sitting next to her on deck&mdash;two lively young women with the latest 
Paris hats on their heads and the latest New York ideas beneath 
them.  These ladies, as to whom it would have been impossible for 
a person with Mrs. Lidcote's primitive categories to determine 
whether they were married or unmarried, "nice" or "horrid," or any 
one or other of the definite things which young women, in her youth 
and her society, were of necessity constrained to be, had revealed 
a familiarity with the world of New York that, again according to 
Mrs. Lidcote's traditions, should have implied a recognized place 
in it.  But in the present fluid state of manners what did anything 
imply except what their hats implied&mdash;that one couldn't tell what 
was coming next? 
</p><p>They seemed, at any rate, to frequent a group of idle and 
opulent people who executed the same gestures and revolved on the 
same pivots as Mrs. Lidcote's daughter and her friends: their 
Coras, Matties, and Mabels seemed at any moment likely to reveal 
familiar patronymics, and once one of the speakers, summing up a 
discussion of which their neighbor had missed the beginning, had 
affirmed with headlong assurance: "Leila?  Oh, <hi rend="italic"> Leila's</hi> all 
right." 
</p><p>Could it be <hi rend="italic">her</hi> Leila, the mother had wondered, with a 
sharp thrill of curiosity and apprehension?  If only they would 
mention surnames!  But their talk leaped elliptically from allusion 
to allusion, their unfinished sentences dangled over abysses of 
conjecture, and it was one of the marks of their state that they 
gave their bewildered hearer the impression not so much of talking 
only of their intimates, but of being intimate with every one 
alive. 
</p><p>Her old friend Franklin Ide could have told her, perhaps; but 
here was the last day of the voyage, and she hadn't yet found 
courage to ask him.  Great as had been the joy of discovering his 
name on the passenger-list, and seeing his friendly, hirsute 
countenance among the throng against the taffrail at Cherbourg, she 
had as yet said nothing to him except, when they had met, "Of 
course I'm going out to Leila." 
</p><p>She had said nothing to Franklin Ide because she had always 
instinctively shrunk from taking him into her confidence.  She was 
sure he felt sorry for her, sorrier per-<pb n="346"/> haps than any one 
had ever felt; but he had always paid her the supreme tribute of 
not showing it.  His attitude allowed her to imagine that 
compassion was not the basis of his feeling for her, and it was 
part of her joy in his friendship that it was the one relation 
seemingly unconditioned by her state, the one in which she could 
think and feel and behave like any other woman. 
</p><p>Now, however, as the cloudy problem of New York loomed nearer, 
she began to regret that she had not spoken, had not at least 
questioned him about the hints she had gathered on the way.  He did 
not know the two ladies next to her, he did not even, as it 
happened, know Mrs. Lorin Boulger; but he knew New York, and New 
York was the sphinx whose riddle she must read or perish. 
</p><p>Almost as the thought passed through her mind his stooping 
shoulders and grizzled head detached themselves against the dazzle 
of light in the west, and he sauntered down the empty deck and 
dropped into the chair at her side. 
</p><p>"You're expecting the Barkleys to meet you, I suppose?" he 
asked composedly. 
</p><p>It was the first time she had heard any one pronounce her 
daughter's new name, and it immediately occurred to her that her 
friend, who was shy and inarticulate, had been trying to say it all 
the way over and had at last shot it out at her only because he 
felt it must be now or never. 
</p><p>"I don't know.  I cabled, of course.  But I believe she's at&mdash; 
they're at&mdash;<hi rend="italic">his</hi> place somewhere." 
</p><p>"Oh, Barkley's; yes, near Lenox, isn't it?  But she's sure to 
come to town to meet you." 
</p><p>He said it so easily and naturally that her own constraint was 
relieved, and suddenly, before she knew what she meant to do, she 
had burst out, "She may dislike the idea of seeing people." 
</p><p>Ide, whose absent, short-sighted gaze had been fixed on the 
slowly gliding water, turned in his seat to stare at his companion. 
</p><p>"Who?  Leila?" he said, with an incredulous laugh. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote flushed to her faded hair, and grew pale again.  
"It took <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a long time&mdash;to get used to it," she stammered, 
forcing a smile. 
</p><p>His look grew gently commiserating.  "I think you'll find&mdash;" 
he wavered for a word&mdash;"that things are different now&mdash;altogether 
easier." 
</p><p>"That's what I've been wondering&mdash;since we started."  She was 
determined now to speak.  She moved nearer, so that their arms 
touched, and she could drop her voice to the lowest murmur.  "You 
see, it all came on me in a flash.  My going off to India and Siam 
on that long trip kept me away from letters for weeks at a time; 
and she didn't want to tell me beforehand&mdash;oh, I understand <hi rend="italic"> 
that</hi>, poor child!  You know how good she's always been to me; how 
she's tried to spare me.  And she knew, of course, what a state of 
horror I'd be in.  She knew I'd rush to her at once and try to stop 
it.  So she never gave me a hint of anything, and she even managed 
to muzzle Susy Suffern&mdash;you know Susy is the one of the family who 
keeps me posted about things at home.  I don't yet see how she 
prevented Susy's telling me; but she did.  And her first letter, 
the one I got up at Bangkok, simply said the thing was over,&mdash;the 
divorce, I mean,&mdash;and that the very next day she'd&mdash;well, I suppose 
there was no use waiting; and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> seems to have behaved as well 
as possible, to have wanted to marry her as much as&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Who?  Barkley?" he helped her out.  "I should say so!  Why, 
what do you suppose&mdash;"  He interrupted himself.  "He'll be devoted 
to her, I assure you," he said. 
</p><p>"Oh, of course; I'm sure he will.  He's written me&mdash;really 
beautifully.  But it's a terrible strain on a man's devotion, a 
terrible test.  I'm not sure that Leila realizes&mdash;" 
</p><p>Ide sounded again his little, reassuring laugh.  "I'm not sure 
that you realize.  <hi rend="italic"> They're</hi> all right." 
</p><p>It was the very phrase that the young lady in the next seat 
had applied to the unknown "Leila," and its recurrence on Ide's 
lips flushed Mrs. Lidcote with fresh courage. 
</p><p>"I wish I knew just what you mean.  The two young women next 
to me&mdash;the ones with the wonderful hats&mdash;have been talking in the 
same way." 
</p><p>"What?  About Leila?" 
</p><p>"About <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Leila; I fancied it might be mine.  And about 
society in general.  All their friends seem to be divorced; some of 
<pb n="347"/>  them seem to announce their engagements before they get 
their decree.  One of them,&mdash;<hi rend="italic">her</hi> name was Mabel,&mdash;as far as I 
could make out, her husband found out that she meant to divorce him 
by noticing that she wore a new engagement-ring." 
</p><p>"Well, you see Leila did everything 'regularly,' as the French 
say," Ide rejoined. 
</p><p>"Yes; but are these people in society?  The people my 
neighbors talk about?" 
</p><p>Ide shrugged his shoulders.  "It would take an arbitration 
commission a good many sittings to define the boundaries of society 
nowadays.  But at any rate they're in New York; and I assure you 
you're <hi rend="italic"> not;</hi> you're farther and farther from it." 
</p><p>"But I've been back there several times to see Leila."  She 
hesitated and looked away from him.  Then she brought out slowly: 
"And I've never noticed&mdash;the least change&mdash;in&mdash;in my own case&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh," he sounded deprecatingly, and she trembled with the fear 
of having gone too far.  But the hour was past when she could be 
held by such scruples.  She must know where she was and where Leila 
was.  "Mrs. Boulger still cuts me," she brought out with an 
embarrassed laugh. 
</p><p>"Are you sure?  You've probably cut <hi rend="italic"> her;</hi> if not now, at 
least in the past.  And in a cut, if you're not first, you're 
nowhere.  That's what keeps up so many quarrels." 
</p><p>The word roused Mrs. Lidcote to a renewed sense of realities.  
"But the Purshes," she said&mdash;"the Purshes are so strong!  There are 
so many of them, and they all back each other up, just as my 
husband's family did.  I know what it means to have a clan against 
one.  They're stronger than any number of separate friends.  The 
Purshes will <hi rend="italic">never</hi> forgive Leila for leaving Horace.  Why, his 
mother opposed his marrying her because of&mdash;of my situation.  She 
tried to get Leila to promise that she wouldn't see me when they 
went to Europe on their honeymoon.  And now she'll say it was my 
example." 
</p><p>Her companion, vaguely stroking his beard, mused a moment upon 
this; then he asked with seeming irrelevance, "What did Leila say 
when you wrote that you were coming?" 
</p><p>"She said it wasn't the least necessary, but I'd better come, 
because it was the only way to convince me that it wasn't." 
</p><p>"Well, then, that proves she's not afraid of the Purshes." 
</p><p>She breathed a long sigh of remembrance.  "Oh, just at first, 
you know&mdash;one never is." 
</p><p>He laid his hand on hers with a rapid gesture of intelligence 
and pity.  "You'll see, you'll see," he merely promised her. 
</p><p>A shadow lengthened down the deck before them, and a steward 
stood there, proffering a wireless despatch. 
</p><p>"Oh, now I shall know!" she exclaimed. 
</p><p>She tore the message open, and then let it fall on her knees, 
dropping her clasped hands on it in silence. 
</p><p>Ide's inquiry roused her: "It's all right?" 
</p><p>"Oh, quite right.  Perfectly.  She can't come; but she's 
sending Susy Suffern.  She says that Susy will explain."  After 
another silence she added, with a sudden gush of bitterness, "As if 
I needed any explanation!" 
</p><p>She felt Ide's hesitating glance upon her.  "She's in the 
country?" 
</p><p>"Yes.  'Prevented last moment.  Longing for you, expecting 
you.  Love from both.'  Don't you <hi rend="italic">see</hi>, the poor darling, that 
she couldn't face it?" 
</p><p>"No, I don't."  He waited.  "Do you mean to go to her 
immediately?" 
</p><p>"It will be too late to catch a train this evening; but I 
shall take the first to-morrow morning."  She considered a moment.  
"Perhaps it's better.  I need a talk with Susy first.  She's to 
meet me at the dock, and I'll take her straight back to the hotel 
with me." 
</p><p>As she developed this plan, she had the sense that Ide was 
still thoughtfully, even gravely, considering her.  When she 
ceased, he remained silent a moment; then he said almost 
ceremoniously: "If your talk with Miss Suffern doesn't last too 
late, would it be indiscreet of me to ask to see you when it's 
over?  I shall be dining at the club, and I'll call you up at about 
ten, if I may.  I'm off to Chicago on business to-morrow morning, 
and it would be a satisfaction to know, before I start, that your 
cousin's been able to reassure you, as I know she will." 
</p><p>He spoke with a sudden, shy deliberateness that, even to Mrs. 
Lidcote's troubled perceptions, sounded a long-silenced note of 
feeling.  Perhaps the breaking down of <pb n="348"/>  the barrier of 
reticence between them had released unsuspected emotions in both.  
The tone of his appeal moved her curiously and loosened the tight 
strain of her fears. 
</p><p>"Oh, yes, come&mdash;do come," she murmured, rising.  The huge 
threat of New York was imminent now, dwarfing, under long reaches 
of embattled masonry, the great deck she stood on and all the 
little specks of life it carried.  One of them, drifting nearer, 
took the shape of her maid, flanked by luggage-laden stewards, and 
signing to her that it was time to go below.  As they descended to 
the main deck, the throng swept her against Mrs. Lorin Boulger's 
shoulder, and she heard the ambassadress call to an interlocutor, 
over the vexed sea of hats: "So sorry!  I should have been 
delighted, but I've promised to spend Sunday with some friends at 
Lenox."

<p>SUSY SUFFERN'S explanation did not end till after ten o'clock, and 
she had just gone when Franklin Ide, who, complying with an old New 
York tradition, had caused himself to be preceded by a long, white 
box of roses, was ushered into Mrs. Lidcote's sitting-room. 
</p><p>He came forward with his shy, half-humorous smile and, taking 
her hand, looked at her for a moment without speaking. 
</p><p>"It's all right," he then pronounced affirmatively. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote returned his smile.  "It's extraordinary.  
Everything's changed.  Even Susy has changed; and you know the 
extent to which Susy stood for old New York.  There's no old New 
York left, it seems.  She talked in the most amazing way.  She 
snaps her fingers at the Purshes.  She told me&mdash;<hi rend="italic">me</hi>, that every 
woman had a right to happiness, that self-expression was the 
highest duty.  She accused me of misunderstanding Leila; she said 
my point of view was conventional!  She was bursting with pride at 
having been in the secret, and wearing a brooch that Wilbour 
Barkley'd given her!" 
</p><p>Franklin Ide had seated himself in the arm-chair of green art-velvet that she had pushed forward for him under the electric 
chandelier.  He threw back his head and laughed.  "What did I tell 
you?" he exclaimed. 
</p><p>"Yes; but I can't believe that Susy's not mistaken.  Poor 
dear, she has the habit of lost causes; and she may feel that, 
having stuck to me, she can do no less than stick to Leila." 
</p><p>"But she didn't&mdash;did she?&mdash;openly defy the world for you?  She 
didn't snap her fingers at your husband's family?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote shook her head, still smiling.  "No.  It was 
enough to defy <hi rend="italic">my</hi> family.  She did that, almost.  It was 
doubtful at one time if they would tolerate her seeing me, and she 
almost had to disinfect herself after each visit.  I believe that 
at first my sister-in-law wouldn't let the girls come down when 
Susy dined with her." 
</p><p>"Well, isn't your cousin's present attitude the best possible 
proof that times have changed?" 
</p><p>"Yes, yes; I know."  She leaned forward from her sofa-corner, 
fixing her eyes on his thin, kindly face, which gleamed on her 
indistinctly through a sudden blur.  "If it's true, it's&mdash;it's 
dazzling.  She says Leila's perfectly happy.  It's as if an angel 
had gone about in all the cemeteries lifting gravestones, and the 
buried people walked again, and the living didn't shrink from 
them." 
</p><p>"That's about it," he assented. 
</p><p>She drew a deep breath, and sat looking away from him down the 
long perspective of lamp-fringed streets over which her windows 
hung. 
</p><p>"I can understand how happy you must be," he began at length. 
</p><p>She turned to him impetuously.  "Yes, yes; I'm happy.  But I'm 
lonely, too&mdash;lonelier than ever.  I didn't take up much room in the 
world before; but now&mdash;where is there a corner for me?  Oh, since 
I've begun to confess myself, why shouldn't I go on?  Telling you 
this lifts a gravestone from <hi rend="italic"> me!</hi>  You see, before this, Leila 
needed me.  She was unhappy, and I knew it, and though we hardly 
ever talked of it, I felt that, in a way, the thought that I'd been 
through the same thing, and down to the dregs of it, helped her.  
And her needing me helped <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.  And when the news of her 
marriage came, my first thought was that now she'd need me more 
than ever, that she'd have no one but me to turn to.  Yes, under 
all my distress there was a fierce joy in that.  It was so new and 
wonderful to feel again <pb n="349"/>  that there was one person who 
wouldn't be able to get on without me!  And now what you and Susy 
tell me seems to have taken my child from me; and just at first 
that's all that I can feel." 
</p><p>"Of course it's all you feel."  He looked at her musingly.  
"Why didn't Leila come to meet you?" he then inquired. 
</p><p>"Oh, that was really my fault.  You see, I'd cabled that I was 
not sure of being able to get off on the <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi>, and apparently 
my second cable was delayed, and when she received it, she'd 
already asked some people over Sunday&mdash;one or two of her old 
friends, Susy says.  I'm so glad they should have wanted to go to 
her at once; but naturally I'd rather have been alone with her." 
</p><p>"You still mean to go, then?" 
</p><p>"Oh, I must.  Susy wanted to drag me off to Ridgefield with 
her over Sunday, and Leila sent me word that of course I might go 
if I wanted to, and that I was not to think of her; but I know how 
disappointed she would be.  Susy said she was afraid I might be 
upset at her having people to stay, and that, in that case, she 
wouldn't urge me to come.  But if <hi rend="italic">they</hi> don't mind, why should 
I?  And of course, if they're willing to go to Leila, it must mean--" 
</p><p>"Of course.  I'm glad you recognize that," Franklin Ide 
exclaimed abruptly.  He stood up and went over to her, taking her 
hand with one of his quick unexpected gestures.  "There's something 
I want to say to you," he began&mdash; 
 
THE next morning, in the train, through all the other contending 
thoughts in Mrs. Lidcote's mind there ran the warm undercurrent of 
what Franklin Ide had wanted to say to her. 
</p><p>He had wanted, she knew, to say it once before, when, nearly 
eight years earlier, the hazard of meeting at the end of a rainy 
autumn in a small, deserted Swiss hotel had thrown them for a 
fortnight into unwonted propinquity.  They had walked and talked 
together, borrowed each other's books and newspapers, spent the 
long, chill evenings over the fire in the dim lamplight of her 
little pitch-pine sitting-room; and she had been wonderfully 
comforted by his presence, and hard, frozen places in her had 
melted, and she had known that she would be desperately sorry when 
he went.  And then, just at the end, in his odd, indirect way, he 
had let her see that it rested with her to have him stay if she 
chose.  She could still relive the sleepless night she had given to 
that discovery.  It was preposterous, of course, to think of 
repaying his devotion by accepting such a sacrifice; but how find 
reasons to convince him?  She could not bear to let him think her 
less touched, less inclined to him than she was: the generosity of 
his love deserved that she should repay it with the truth.  Yet how 
let him see what she felt, and yet refuse what he offered?  How 
confess to him what had been on her lips when he made the offer: 
"I've seen what it did to one man; and there must never, never be 
another?"  The tacit ignoring of her past had been the element in 
which their friendship lived, and she could not suddenly, to him of 
all men, begin to talk of herself like a guilty woman in a play.  
Somehow, in the end, she had managed it, had averted a direct 
explanation, had made him understand that her life was over, that 
she existed only for her daughter, and that a more definite word 
from him would have been almost a breach of delicacy.  She was so 
used to behaving as if her life were over!  And, at any rate, he 
had taken her hint, and she had been able to spare her 
sensitiveness and his.  The next year, when he came to Florence to 
see her, they met again in the old friendly way; and that till now 
had continued to be the tenor of their intimacy. 
</p><p>And now, suddenly and unexpectedly, he had brought up the 
question again, directly this time, and in such a form that she 
could not evade it: putting the renewal of his plea, after so long 
an interval, on the ground that, on her own showing, her chief 
argument against it no longer existed. 
</p><p>"You tell me Leila's happy.  If she's happy, she doesn't need 
you&mdash;need you, that is, in the same way as before.  You wanted 
then, I know, to be always in reach, always free and available if 
she should suddenly call you to her or take refuge with you.  I 
understood that&mdash;I respected it.  I didn't urge my case because I 
saw it was useless.  You couldn't, I understood well enough, have 
felt free to take such happiness as life with me <pb n="350"/>  might have 
given you while she was unhappy, and, as you imagined, with no hope 
of release.  Even then I didn't feel as you did about it; I 
understood better the trend of things here.  But ten years ago the 
change hadn't really come; and I had no way of convincing you that 
it was coming.  Still, I always fancied that Leila might not think 
her case was closed, and so I chose to think that ours wasn't 
either.  Let me go on thinking so, at any rate, till you've seen 
her, and confirmed with your own eyes what Susy Suffern tells you."

<p>ALL through what Susy Suffern told and retold her during their 
four-hours' flight to the hills this plea of Ide's kept coming back 
to Mrs. Lidcote.  She did not yet know what she felt as to its 
ultimate bearing on her own fate, but it was something on which her 
confused thoughts could stay themselves amid the welter of new 
impressions, and she was inexpressibly glad that he had said what 
he had, and said it at that particular moment.  It helped her to 
hold fast to her identity in the rush of strange names and new 
categories that her cousin's talk poured out on her. 
</p><p>With the progress of the journey Miss Suffern's communications 
grew more and more amazing.  She was like a cicerone preparing the 
mind of an inexperienced traveler for the marvels about to burst on 
it. 
</p><p>"You won't know Leila.  She's had her pearls reset.  Sargent's 
to paint her.  Oh, and I was to tell you that she hopes you won't 
mind being the least bit squeezed over Sunday.  The house was built 
by Wilbour's father, you know, and it's rather old-fashioned&mdash;only 
ten spare bedrooms.  Of course that's small for what they mean to 
do, and she'll show you the new plans they've had made.  Their idea 
is to keep the present house as a wing.  She told me to explain&mdash; 
she's so dreadfully sorry not to be able to give you a sitting-room 
just at first.  They're thinking of Egypt for next winter, unless 
of course, Wilbour gets his appointment.  Oh, didn't she write you 
about that?  Why, he wants Rome, you know&mdash;the second 
secretaryship.  Or, rather, he wanted England; but Leila insisted 
that if they went abroad, she must be near you.  And of course what 
she says is law.  Oh, they quite hope they'll get it.  You see 
Horace's uncle is in the Cabinet,&mdash;one of the assistant 
secretaries,&mdash;and I believe he has a good deal of pull&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Horace's uncle?  You mean Wilbour's, I suppose," Mrs. Lidcote 
interjected, with a gasp of which a fraction was given to Miss 
Suffern's flippant use of the language. 
</p><p>"Wilbour's?  No, I don't.  I mean Horace's.  Oh, there's no 
bad feeling between them, I assure you.  Since Horace's engagement 
was announced&mdash;you didn't know Horace was engaged?  Why, he's 
marrying one of Bishop Thorbury's girls: the red-haired one who 
wrote the novel that every one's talking about, 'This Flesh of 
Mine.'  They're to be married in the cathedral.  Of course Horace 
<hi rend="italic">can</hi>, because it was Leila who&mdash;but, as I say, there's not the 
<hi rend="italic">least</hi> feeling, and Horace wrote himself to his uncle about 
Wilbour." 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote's thoughts fled back to what she had said to Ide 
the day before on the deck of the <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi>.  "I didn't take up 
much room before, but now where is there a corner for me?"  Where 
indeed in this crowded, topsyturvy world, with its headlong changes 
and helter-skelter readjustments, its new tolerances and 
indifferences and accommodations, was there room for a character 
fashioned by slower, sterner processes and a life broken under 
their inexorable pressure?  And then, in a flash, she viewed the 
chaos from a new angle, and order seemed to move upon the void.  If 
the old processes were changed, her case was changed with them; 
she, too, was a part of the general readjustment, a tiny fragment 
of the new pattern worked out in bolder, freer harmonies.  Since 
her daughter had no penalty to pay, was not she herself, by the 
same stroke, released from the long toll that life had taken of 
her?  The rich arrears of youth and joy were gone irrevocably; but 
was there not enough left to accumulate new stores of happiness?  
That, of course, was what Franklin Ide had felt and had meant her 
to feel.  He had seen at once what the change in her daughter's 
situation would make in her view of her own.  It was almost&mdash; 
wondrously enough!&mdash;as if Leila's folly had been the means of 
vindicating hers. <pb n="351"/>  
 
EVERYTHING else for the moment faded for Mrs. Lidcote in the glow 
of her daughter's embrace.  It was unnatural, it was almost 
terrifying, to find herself suddenly standing on a strange 
threshold, under an unknown roof, in a big hall full of pictures, 
flowers, firelight, and hurrying servants, and in this spacious, 
unfamiliar confusion to discover Leila, bareheaded, laughing, 
authoritative, with a strange young man jovially echoing her 
welcome and transmitting her orders; but once Mrs. Lidcote had her 
child on her breast, and her child's, "It's all right, you old 
darling!" in her ears, every other feeling was lost in the deep 
sense of well-being that only Leila's hug could give. 
</p><p>The sense was still with her, warming her veins and pleasantly 
fluttering her heart, as she went up to her room after luncheon.  
A little constrained by the presence of visitors, and not 
altogether sorry to defer for a few hours the "long talk" with her 
daughter for which she somehow felt herself tremulously unready, 
she had withdrawn, on the plea of fatigue, to the bright, luxurious 
bedroom into which Leila had again and again apologized for having 
been obliged to "squeeze" her.  The room was bigger and finer than 
any in her small apartment in Florence; but it was not the standard 
of affluence implied in her daughter's tone about it that chiefly 
struck her, nor yet the finish and complexity of its appointments.  
It was the look it shared with the rest of the house, and with the 
trim perspective of the gardens beneath its windows, of being part 
of an "establishment"&mdash;of something solid, avowed, founded on 
sacraments and precedents and principles.  There was nothing about 
the place, or about Leila and Wilbour, that suggested either 
passion or peril: their relation seemed as comfortable as their 
furniture and as respectable as their balance at the bank. 
</p><p>This was, in the whole confusing experience, the thing that 
confused Mrs. Lidcote most, that gave her at once the deepest 
feeling of security for Leila and the strongest sense of 
apprehension for herself.  Yes, there was something oppressive in 
the completeness and compactness of Leila's well-being.  Ide had 
been right: her daughter did not need her.  Leila, with her first 
embrace, had unconsciously attested the fact in the same phrase as 
Ide himself, as the two young women with the hats.  "It's all 
right, you old darling!" she had said; and her mother sat alone, 
trying to fit herself into the new scheme of things which such a 
certainty betokened. 
</p><p>Her first distinct feeling was one of irrational resentment.  
If such a change was to come, why had it not come sooner?  Here was 
she, a woman not yet old, who had paid with the best years of her 
life for the theft of the happiness that her daughter's 
contemporaries took as their due.  There was no sense, no sequence, 
in it.  She had had what she wanted, but she had had to pay too 
much for it.  She had had to pay the last bitterest price of 
learning that love has a price: that it is worth so much and no 
more.  She had known the anguish of watching the man she loved 
discover this first, and of reading the discovery in his eyes.  It 
was a part of her history that she had not trusted herself to think 
of for a long time past: she always took a big turn about that 
haunted corner of her conscience.  But now, at the sight of the 
young man down-stairs, so openly and jovially Leila's, she was 
overwhelmed at the senseless waste of her own adventure, and wrung 
with the irony of perceiving that the success or failure of the 
deepest human experiences may hang on a matter of chronology. 
</p><p>Then gradually the thought of Ide returned to her.  "I chose 
to think that our case wasn't closed," he had said.  She had been 
deeply touched by that.  To every one else her case had been closed 
so long!  <hi rend="italic">Finis</hi> was scrawled all over her.  But here was one 
man who had believed and waited, and what if what he believed in 
and waited for were coming true?  If Leila's "all right" should 
really foreshadow hers? 
</p><p>As yet, of course, it was impossible to tell.  She had 
fancied, indeed, when she entered the drawing-room before luncheon, 
that a too-sudden hush had fallen on the assembled group of Leila's 
friends, on the slender, vociferous young women and the lounging, 
golf-stockinged young men.  They had all received her politely, 
with the kind of petrified politeness that may be either a tribute 
to age or a protest at laxity; but to them, of course, she must be 
an old woman because she was Leila's mother, and in a society so 
dominated by <pb n="352"/>  youth the mere presence of maturity was a 
constraint. 
</p><p>One of the young girls, however, had presently emerged from 
the group, and, attaching herself to Mrs. Lidcote's side, had 
listened to her with a blue gaze of admiration which gave the older 
woman a sudden happy consciousness of her long-forgotten social 
graces.  It was agreeable to find herself attracting this young 
Charlotte Wynn, whose mother had been among her closest friends, 
and in whom something of the soberness and softness of the earlier 
manners had survived.  But the little colloquy, broken up by the 
announcement of luncheon, could of course result in nothing more 
definite than this reminiscent emotion. 
</p><p>No, she could not yet tell how her own case was to be fitted 
into the new order of things; but there were more people&mdash;"older 
people" Leila had put it&mdash;arriving by the afternoon train, and that 
evening at dinner she would doubtless be able to judge.  She began 
to wonder nervously who the new-comers might be.  Probably she 
would be spared the embarrassment of finding old acquaintances 
among them; but it was odd that her daughter had mentioned no 
names. 
</p><p>Leila had proposed that, later in the afternoon, Wilbour 
should take her mother for a drive: she said she wanted them to 
have a "nice, quiet talk."  But Mrs. Lidcote wished her talk with 
Leila to come first, and had, moreover, at luncheon, caught stray 
allusions to an impending tennis-match in which her son-in-law was 
engaged.  Her fatigue had been a sufficient pretext for declining 
the drive, and she had begged Leila to think of her as peacefully 
reposing in her room till such time as they could snatch their 
quiet moment. 
</p><p>"Before tea, then, you duck!" Leila with a last kiss had 
decided; and presently Mrs. Lidcote, through her open window, had 
heard the fresh, loud voices of her daughter's visitors chiming 
across the gardens from the tennis-court.

<p>LEILA had come and gone, and they had had their talk.  It had not 
lasted as long as either of them wished, for in the middle of it 
Leila had been summoned to the telephone to receive an important 
message from town, and had sent her maid to tell Mrs. Lidcote that 
she couldn't come back just then, as one of the young ladies had 
been called away unexpectedly and arrangements had to be made for 
her departure.  But the mother and daughter had had almost an hour 
together, and Mrs. Lidcote was happy.  She had never seen Leila so 
tender, so solicitous.  The only thing that troubled her was, 
indeed, the very excess of this solicitude, the exaggerated 
expression of her daughter's annoyance that their first moments 
together should have been marred by the presence of strangers. 
</p><p>"Not strangers to me, darling, since they're friends of 
yours," her mother had assured her. 
</p><p>"Yes; but I know your feeling, you queer, wild mother.  I know 
how you've always hated people."  (<hi rend="italic"> Hated people!</hi>  Had Leila 
forgotten why?)  "And that's why I told Susy that if you preferred 
to go with her to Ridgefield on Sunday, I should so perfectly 
understand, should so patiently wait for our good hug.  But you 
didn't really mind them at luncheon, did you, dearest?" 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote, at that, had suddenly thrown a long, startled 
look at her daughter.  "I don't mind things of that kind any 
longer," she had simply answered. 
</p><p>"But that doesn't console me for having exposed you to the 
bother of it, for having let you come here when I ought to have <hi rend="italic"> 
ordered</hi> you off to Ridgefield with Susy.  If Susy hadn't been 
stupid, she'd have made you go there with her.  I hate to think of 
you up here all alone." 
</p><p>Again Mrs. Lidcote tried to read something more than a rather 
obtuse devotion in her daughter's radiant gaze.  "I'm glad to have 
had a rest this afternoon, dear; and later&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh, yes, later, when all this fuss is over, we'll more than 
make up for it, sha'n't we, you precious darling?"  And at this 
point Leila had been summoned to the telephone, leaving Mrs. 
Lidcote alone with her conjectures. 
</p><p>These were still floating before her in cloudy imprecision 
when Miss Suffern's tap on the door roused her to the lapse of 
time. <pb n="588"/>  
</p><p>"You've come to take me down to tea?  I'd forgotten how late 
it was," she said. 
</p><p>Miss Suffern, a plump, peering little woman, with prim hair 
and a conciliatory smile, nervously adjusted, as she came in, the 
pendant bugles of her oddly elaborate black dress.  Miss Suffern 
was always in mourning, and always commemorating the demise of 
distant relatives by wearing the discarded wardrobe of their next 
of kin.  "It isn't <hi rend="italic">exactly</hi> mourning," she would say; "but it's 
the only stitch of black poor Julia had&mdash;and of course George was 
only my mother's step-cousin." 
</p><p>As she came forward, Mrs. Lidcote found herself humorously 
wondering whether she were mourning Horace Pursh's divorce in one 
of his mother's old black satins. 
</p><p>"Oh, <hi rend="italic">did</hi> you mean to go down?"  Susy Suffern peered at 
her, a little fluttered.  "Leila sent me up to keep you company.  
She thought it would be cozier for you to have tea here.  She was 
afraid you were feeling rather tired." 
</p><p>"I was; but I've had the whole afternoon to rest in.  And this 
wonderful sofa to help me." 
</p><p>"Leila told me to tell you that she'd rush up for a minute 
before dinner, after everybody had arrived; but the train is always 
dreadfully late.  She's in despair at not giving you a sitting-room; she wanted to know if I thought you really minded." 
</p><p>"Of course I don't mind.  It's not like Leila to think I 
should."  Mrs. Lidcote drew aside to make way for the housemaid, 
who appeared in the doorway, bearing a table spread with a studied 
variety of tea-cakes. 
</p><p>"Leila saw to it herself," Miss Suffern murmured as the door 
closed on the housemaid's efficient figure.  "Her one idea is that 
you should feel happy here." 
</p><p>It struck Mrs. Lidcote as one more mark of the subverted state 
of things that her daughter's solicitude should find expression in 
the tenuity of sandwiches and the piping-hotness of muffins; but 
then everything that had happened since her arrival seemed to 
increase her confusion. 
</p><p>The note of a motor-horn down the drive gave another turn to 
her thoughts.  "Are those the new arrivals already?" she asked. 
</p><p>"Oh, dear, no; they won't be here till after seven."  Miss 
Suffern craned her head from the window to catch a glimpse of the 
motor.  "It must be Charlotte leaving." 
</p><p>"Was it the little Wynn girl who was called away in a hurry 
just now?  I hope it's not on account of illness." 
</p><p>"Oh, no; I believe there was some mistake about dates.  Her 
mother telephoned her that she was expected at the Stepleys, at 
Fishkill, and she had to be rushed over to Albany to catch a 
train." 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote meditated.  "I'm sorry.  She's a charming young 
thing.  I hoped I should have another talk with her this evening 
after dinner." 
</p><p>"Yes; it's too bad."  Miss Suffern's gaze grew vague.  "You <hi rend="italic"> 
do</hi> look tired, you know," she continued, seating herself at the 
tea-table and preparing to dispense its delicacies.  "You must go 
straight back to your sofa and let me wait on you.  The excitement 
has told on you more than you think, and you mustn't fight against 
it any longer.  Just stay quietly up here and let yourself go.  
You'll have Leila to yourself on Monday." 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote received the tea-cup which her cousin proffered, 
but showed no other disposition to obey her injunctions.  For a 
moment she stirred her tea in silence; then she asked, "Is it your 
idea that I should stay quietly up here till Monday?" 
</p><p>Miss Suffern set down her own cup with a gesture so sudden 
that it endangered an adjacent plate of scones.  When she had 
assured herself of the safety of the scones, she looked up with a 
fluttered laugh.  "Perhaps, dear, by to-morrow you'll be feeling 
differently.  The air here, you know&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Yes, I know."  Mrs. Lidcote bent forward to help herself to 
a scone.  "Who's arriving this evening?" she then inquired. 
</p><p>Miss Suffern frowned and peered.  "You know my wretched head 
for names.  Leila told me, of course&mdash;but there are so many&mdash;" 
</p><p>"So many?  She didn't tell me she expected a big party." 
</p><p>"Oh, not big: but rather outside of her little group.  And of 
course, as it's the first time, she's a little excited at having 
the older set." <pb n="589"/>  
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote considered this.  "The older set?  Our 
contemporaries, you mean?" 
</p><p>"Why&mdash;yes."  Miss Suffern paused as if to gather herself up 
for a leap.  "The Ashton Gileses," she brought out. 
</p><p>"The Ashton Gileses?  Really?  I shall be glad to see Mary 
Giles again.  It must be eighteen years," said Mrs. Lidcote, 
steadily. 
</p><p>"Yes," Miss Suffern gasped, precipitately refilling her cup. 
</p><p>"The Ashton Gileses; and who else?" 
</p><p>"Well, the Sam Fresbies.  But the most important person, of 
course, is Mrs. Lorin Boulger." 
</p><p>"Mrs. Boulger?  Leila didn't tell me she was coming." 
</p><p>"Didn't she?  I suppose she forgot everything when she saw 
you.  But really the party was got up for Mrs. Boulger.  You see, 
it's very important that she should&mdash;well, take a fancy to Leila 
and Wilbour: his being appointed to Rome virtually depends on it.  
And you know Leila insists on Rome in order to be near you.  So she 
asked Mary Giles, who's intimate with the Boulgers, if the visit 
couldn't possibly be arranged; and Mary's cable caught Mrs. Boulger 
at Cherbourg.  She's to be only a fortnight in America; and getting 
her to come directly here was rather a triumph." 
</p><p>"Yes; I see it was," said Mrs. Lidcote. 
</p><p>"You know, she's rather&mdash;rather fussy; and Mary was a little 
doubtful if&mdash;" 
</p><p>"If she would, on account of Leila?" Mrs. Lidcote murmured. 
</p><p>"Well, yes.  In her official position.  But luckily she's a 
friend of the Barkleys.  And finding the Gileses and Fresbies here 
will make it all right.  The times have changed," Susy Suffern 
indulgently summed up. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote smiled.  "Yes; a few years ago it would have 
seemed improbable that I should ever again be dining with Mary 
Giles and Harriet Fresbie and Mrs. Lorin Boulger." 
</p><p>Miss Suffern did not at the moment seem disposed to enlarge 
upon this theme; and after an interval of silence Mrs. Lidcote 
suddenly resumed, "Do they know I'm here, by the way?" 
</p><p>The effect of her question was to produce in Miss Suffern an 
exaggerated access of peering and frowning.  She twitched the tea-things about, fingered her bugles with a flurried hand, and, 
looking at the clock, exclaimed amazedly: "Mercy!  Is it seven 
already?" 
</p><p>"Not that it can make any difference, I suppose," Mrs. Lidcote 
musingly continued.  "But did Leila tell them I was coming?" 
</p><p>Miss Suffern looked at her with pain.  "Why, you don't 
suppose, dearest, that Leila would do anything&mdash;" 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote went on: "For, of course, it's of the first 
importance, as you say, that Mrs. Lorin Boulger should be favorably 
impressed in order that Wilbour may have the best possible chance 
of getting Rome." 
</p><p>"I <hi rend="italic">told</hi> Leila you'd feel that, dear.  You see, it's 
actually on <hi rend="italic">your</hi> account&mdash;so that they may get a post near you--that Leila invited Mrs. Boulger." 
</p><p>"Yes, I see that, of course."  Mrs. Lidcote, abruptly rising 
from her seat, turned her eyes to the clock.  "But, as you say, 
it's getting late.  Oughtn't we to dress for dinner?" 
</p><p>Miss Suffern, at the suggestion, stood up also, an agitated 
hand among her bugles.  "I do wish I could persuade you to stay up 
here this evening.  I'm sure Leila'd be happier if you would.  
Really, you're much too tired to come down." 
</p><p>"What nonsense, Susy!"  Mrs. Lidcote spoke with a sudden 
sharpness, her hand stretched to the bell.  "When do we dine?  At 
half-past eight?  Then I must really send you packing.  At my age 
it takes time to dress." 
</p><p>Miss Suffern, thus decisively projected toward the threshold, 
lingered there to reiterate reproachfully: "Leila'll never forgive 
herself if you make an effort you're not up to."  But Mrs. Lidcote 
smiled on her without answering, and the icy light-wave propelled 
her through the door.

<p>MRS. LIDCOTE, though she had made the gesture of ringing for her 
maid, had not done so. 
</p><p>When the door closed, she stood a moment motionless in the 
middle of her soft, spacious room.  The little fire which had been 
kindled at twilight danced on the brightness of silver and mirrors 
and sober gilding; and the sofa toward which Miss <pb n="590"/>  Suffern 
had urged her heaped up its accumulated cushions in inviting 
proximity to a table laden with new books and papers.  She could 
not recall having ever been more luxuriously housed, or having ever 
had so strange a sense of being out alone, under the night, in a 
wind-beaten plain without shelter.  She sat down by the fire and 
thought. 
</p><p>A tap on the door made her lift her head, and she saw her 
daughter on the threshold.  The intricate ordering of Leila's fair 
hair and the contrasted negligence of her draperies showed that she 
had interrupted her dressing to hasten to her mother; but once in 
the room, she paused a moment, smiling uncertainly, as though she 
had forgotten the object of her haste. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote rose to her feet.  "Time to dress, dearest?  
Don't scold!  I sha'n't be late," she said. 
</p><p>"To dress?"  Leila hung before her with a puzzled look.  "Why, 
I thought, dear&mdash;I mean, I hoped you'd decided just to stay here 
quietly and rest." 
</p><p>Her mother smiled.  "But I've been resting all the afternoon!" 
</p><p>Leila shone on her apprehensively.  "Yes, but&mdash;you know you <hi rend="italic"> 
do</hi> look tired.  And when Susy told me just now that you meant to 
make the effort&mdash;" 
</p><p>"You came in to stop me?" 
</p><p>"I came in to tell you that you needn't feel in the least 
obliged&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Of course.  I understand that." 
</p><p>There was a pause during which Leila, vaguely averting herself 
from her mother's scrutiny, drifted toward the dressing-table and 
began to disturb the symmetry of the toilet implements laid out on 
it. 
</p><p>"Do your visitors know that I'm here?" Mrs. Lidcote suddenly 
went on. 
</p><p>"Do they&mdash;  Of course&mdash;why, naturally," Leila rejoined, 
absorbed in trying to turn the stopper of a salts-bottle. 
</p><p>"Then won't they think it odd if I don't appear at dinner?" 
</p><p>"Oh, not in the least, dearest.  Really, I assure you they'll 
<hi rend="italic">all</hi> understand."  Leila laid down the bottle and turned back to 
her mother, her face alight with reassurance. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote stood motionless, her head erect, her smiling 
eyes on her daughter's.  "Will they think it odd if I <hi rend="italic"> do?"</hi> 
</p><p>Leila stopped short, her lips half parted to reply.  As she 
paused, the color stole over her bare neck, swept up to her throat, 
and burst into flame in her cheeks.  Thence it sent its devastating 
crimson up to her very temples, to the lobes of her ears, to the 
edges of her eyelids, beating all over her in great waves of red, 
as if fanned by some imperceptible wind which blew back the words 
from her lips. 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote for a moment silently watched the conflagration; 
then she turned away her eyes with a slight laugh.  "I only meant 
that I was afraid it might upset the arrangement of your dinner-table if I didn't, at the last, come down.  If you can really 
assure me that it won't, I believe I'll take you at your word and 
go back to this irresistible sofa."  She paused, as if waiting for 
her daughter to speak; then she held out her arms.  "Run off and 
dress, dearest, and don't have me on your mind."  She clasped Leila 
close, pressing a long kiss on the last afterglow of her subsiding 
blush.  "I do feel the least bit overdone, and if it really won't 
inconvenience you to have me drop out of things, I believe I'll 
just basely take to my bed and stay there till your party scatters.  
And now run off, dear, or you'll be late; and make my excuses to 
them all."

<p>THE Barkleys' visitors had dispersed, and Mrs. Lidcote, completely 
restored by her two days' rest, found herself, on the following 
Monday, alone with her children and Miss Suffern. 
</p><p>There was a note of jubilation in the air, for the party had 
"gone off" so extraordinarily well, and so completely, as it 
appeared, to the satisfaction of Mrs. Lorin Boulger, that Wilbour's 
early appointment to Rome was almost to be counted on.  So certain 
did this seem that the prospect of a prompt reunion mitigated the 
distress with which Leila learned of her mother's decision to 
return almost immediately to Italy.  No one understood this 
decision: it seemed to Leila absolutely unintelligible that Mrs. 
Lidcote should not stay on with them till their own fate was fixed, 
and Wilbour handsomely echoed her astonishment. 
</p><p>"Why shouldn't you, as Leila says, wait here till we can all 
pack up and go together?" <pb n="591"/>  
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote smiled her gratitude with her refusal.  "After 
all, it's not yet sure that you'll be packing up." 
</p><p>"Oh, you ought to have seen Wilbour with Mrs. Boulger," Leila 
triumphed. 
</p><p>"No, you ought to have seen Leila with her," Leila's husband 
exulted. 
</p><p>Miss Suffern enthusiastically appended, "I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> think 
inviting Harriet Fresbie was a stroke of genius!" 
</p><p>"Oh, we'll be with you soon," Leila laughed.  "So soon that 
it's really foolish to separate." 
</p><p>But Mrs. Lidcote held out with the quiet firmness which her 
daughter knew it was useless to oppose.  After her long months in 
India, it was really imperative, she declared, that she should get 
back to Florence and see what was happening to her little place 
there; and she had been so comfortable on the <hi rend="italic">Utopia</hi> that she 
had a fancy to return by the same ship.  There was nothing for it, 
therefore, but to acquiesce in her decision and keep her with them 
till the afternoon before the day of the <hi rend="italic"> Utopia's</hi> sailing.  
This arrangement fitted in with certain projects which, during her 
two days' seclusion, Mrs. Lidcote had silently matured.  It had 
become to her of the first importance to get away as soon as she 
could, and the little place in Florence, which held her past in 
every fold of its curtains and between every page of its books, 
seemed now to her the one spot where that past would be endurable 
to look upon. 
</p><p>She was not unhappy during the intervening days.  The sight of 
Leila's well-being, the sense of Leila's tenderness, were, after 
all, what she had come for; and of these she had full measure.  
Leila had never been happier or more tender; and the contemplation 
of her bliss, and the enjoyment of her affection, were an absorbing 
occupation for her mother.  But they were also a sharp strain on 
certain over-tightened chords, and Mrs. Lidcote, when at last she 
found herself alone in the New York hotel to which she had returned 
the night before embarking, had the feeling that she had just 
escaped with her life from the clutch of a giant hand. 
</p><p>She had refused to let her daughter come to town with her; she 
had even rejected Susy Suffern's ministrations.  She wanted no 
viaticum but that of her own thoughts; and she let these come to 
her without shrinking from them as she sat in the same high-hung 
sitting-room in which, just a week before, she and Franklin Ide had 
had their memorable talk. 
</p><p>She had promised her friend to let him hear from her, but she 
had not done so.  She knew that he had probably come back from 
Chicago, and that if he learned of her sudden decision to return to 
Italy it would be impossible for her not to see him before sailing; 
and as she wished above all things not to see him, she had kept 
silent, intending to send him a letter from the steamer. 
</p><p>There was no reason why she should wait till then to write it.  
The actual moment was more favorable, and the task, though not 
agreeable, would at least bridge over an hour of her lonely 
evening.  She went up to the writing-table, drew out a sheet of 
paper, and began to write his name.  And as she did so, the door 
opened, and he came in. 
</p><p>The words she met him with were the last she could have 
imagined herself saying when they had parted.  "How in the world 
did you know that I was here?" 
</p><p>He caught her meaning in a flash.  "You didn't want me to, 
then?"  He stood looking at her.  "I suppose I ought to have taken 
your silence as meaning that.  But I happened to meet Mrs. Wynn, 
who is stopping here, and she asked me to dine with her and 
Charlotte, and Charlotte's young man.  They told me they'd seen you 
arriving this afternoon, and I couldn't help coming up." 
</p><p>There was a pause between them, which Mrs. Lidcote at last 
surprisingly broke with the exclamation, "Ah, she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> recognize 
me, then!" 
</p><p>"Recognize you?"  He stared.  "Why&mdash;" 
</p><p>"Oh, I saw she did, though she never moved an eyelid.  I saw 
it by Charlotte's blush.  The child has the prettiest blush.  I saw 
that her mother wouldn't let her speak to me." 
</p><p>Ide put down his hat with an impatient laugh.  "Hasn't Leila 
cured you of your delusions?" 
</p><p>She looked at him intently.  "Then you don't think Margaret 
Wynn meant to cut me?" 
</p><p>"I think your ideas are absurd." 
</p><p>She paused for a perceptible moment without taking this up; 
then she said, at a tangent: "I'm sailing to-morrow early. <pb n="592"/>  
I meant to write to you&mdash;there's the letter I'd begun." 
</p><p>Ide followed her gesture, and then turned his eyes back to her 
face.  "You didn't mean to see me, then, or even to let me know 
that you were going till you'd left?" 
</p><p>"I felt it would be easier to explain to you in a letter&mdash;" 
</p><p>"What in God's name is there to explain?"  She made no reply, 
and he pressed on: "It can't be that you're worried about Leila, 
for Charlotte Wynn told me she'd been there last week, and there 
was a big party arriving when she left: Fresbies and Gileses, and 
Mrs. Lorin Boulger&mdash;all the board of examiners!  If Leila has 
passed <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, she's got her degree." 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote had dropped down into a corner of the sofa where 
she had sat during their talk of the week before.  "I was stupid," 
she began abruptly.  "I ought to have gone to Ridgefield with Susy.  
I didn't see till afterward that I was expected to." 
</p><p>"You were expected to?" 
</p><p>"Yes.  Oh, it wasn't Leila's fault.  She suffered&mdash;poor 
darling; she was distracted.  But she'd asked her party before she 
knew I was arriving." 
</p><p>"Oh, as to that&mdash;"  Ide drew a deep breath of relief.  "I can 
understand that it must have annoyed her dreadfully not to have you 
to herself just at first.  But, after all, you were among old 
friends or their children: the Gileses and Fresbies&mdash;and little 
Charlotte Wynn."  He paused a moment before the last name, and 
scrutinized her hesitatingly.  "Even if they came at the wrong 
time, you must have been glad to see them all at Leila's." 
</p><p>She gave him back his look with a faint smile.  "I didn't see 
them," she replied. 
</p><p>"You didn't see them?" 
</p><p>"No.  That is, excepting little Charlotte Wynn.  That child is 
exquisite.  We had a little talk before luncheon the day I arrived.  
But when her mother found out that I was staying in the house, she 
telephoned her to leave immediately, and so I didn't see her 
again." 
</p><p>The blood rushed suddenly to Ide's sallow face.  "I don't know 
where you get such ideas!" 
</p><p>She pursued, as if she had not heard him: "Oh, and I saw Mary 
Giles for a minute, too.  Susy Suffern brought her up to my room 
the last evening, after dinner, when all the others were at bridge.  
She meant it kindly&mdash;but it wasn't much use." 
</p><p>"But what were you doing in your room in the evening after 
dinner?" 
</p><p>"Why, you see, when I found out my mistake in coming,&mdash;how 
embarrassing it was for Leila, I mean,&mdash;I simply told her that I 
was very tired, and preferred to stay up-stairs till the party was 
over." 
</p><p>Ide, with a groan, struck his hand against the arm of his 
chair.  "I wonder how much of all this you simply imagined!" 
</p><p>"I didn't imagine the fact of Harriet Fresbie's not even 
asking if she might see me when she knew I was in the house.  Nor 
of Mary Giles's getting Susy, at the eleventh hour, to smuggle her 
up to my room when the others wouldn't know where she'd gone; nor 
poor Leila's ghastly fear lest Mrs. Lorin Boulger, for whom the 
party was given, should guess I was in the house, and prevent her 
husband's giving Wilbour the second secretaryship because she'd 
been obliged to spend a night under the same roof with his mother-in-law!" 
</p><p>Ide continued to drum on his chair-arm with exasperated 
fingers.  "You don't <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that any of the acts you describe are 
due to the causes you suppose." 
</p><p>Mrs. Lidcote paused before replying, as if honestly trying to 
measure the weight of this argument.  Then she said in a low tone: 
"I know that Leila was in an agony lest I should come down to 
dinner the first night.  And it was for me she was afraid, not for 
herself.  Leila is never afraid for herself." 
</p><p>"But the conclusions you draw are simply preposterous.  There 
are narrow-minded women everywhere, but the women who were at 
Leila's knew perfectly well that their going there would give her 
a sort of social sanction, and if they were willing that she should 
have it, why on earth should they want to withhold it from you?" 
</p><p>"That's what I told myself a week ago, in this very room, 
after my first talk with Susy Suffern."  She lifted a misty smile 
to his anxious eyes.  "That's why I listened to what you said to me 
the same evening, and why your arguments half convinced me, and 
made me think that <pb n="593"/>  what had been possible for Leila might 
not be altogether impossible for me.  If the new dispensation had 
come, why not for me as well as for the others?  I can't tell you 
the flight my imagination took!" 
</p><p>Franklin Ide rose from his seat and crossed the room to a 
chair near her sofa-corner.  "All I cared about was that it 
seemed&mdash;for the moment&mdash;to be carrying you toward me," he said. 
</p><p>"I cared about that, too.  That's why I meant to go away 
without seeing you."  They gave each other grave look for look.  
"Because, you see, I was mistaken," she went on.  "We were both 
mistaken.  You say it's preposterous that the women who didn't 
object to accepting Leila's hospitality should have objected to 
meeting me under her roof.  And so it is; but I begin to understand 
why.  It's simply that society is much too busy to revise its own 
judgments.  Probably no one in the house with me stopped to 
consider that my case and Leila's were identical.  They only 
remembered that I'd done something which, at the time I did it, was 
condemned by society.  My case has been passed on and classified: 
I'm the woman who has been cut for nearly twenty years.  The older 
people have half forgotten why, and the younger ones have never 
really known: it's simply become a tradition to cut me.  And 
traditions that have lost their meaning are the hardest of all to 
destroy." 
</p><p>Ide had sat motionless while she spoke.  As she ended, he 
stood up with a short laugh and walked across the room to the 
window.  Outside, the immense, black prospect of New York, strung 
with myriads of lines of light, stretched away into the smoky edges 
of the night.  He showed it to her with a gesture. 
</p><p>"What do you suppose such words as you've been using&mdash; 
'society,' 'tradition,' and the rest&mdash;mean to all the life out 
there?" 
</p><p>She came and stood by him, and looked out of the window.  
"Less than nothing, of course.  But you and I are not out there.  
We're shut up in a little, tight round of habit and association, 
just as we're shut up in this room.  Remember, I thought I'd got 
out of it once; but what really happened was that the other people 
went out, and left me in the same little room.  The only difference 
was that I was there alone.  Oh, I've made it habitable now, I'm 
used to it; but I've lost any illusions I may have had as to an 
angel's opening the door." 
</p><p>Ide again laughed impatiently.  "Well, if the door won't open, 
why not let another prisoner in?  At least it would be less of a 
solitude&mdash;" 
</p><p>She turned from the dark window back into the vividly lighted 
room. 
</p><p>"It would be more of a prison.  You forget that I know all 
about that.  We're all imprisoned, of course&mdash;all of us middling 
people, who don't carry our freedom in our heads.  But we've 
accommodated ourselves to our different cells, and if we're moved 
suddenly into new ones, we're likely to find a stone wall where we 
thought there was thin air, and to knock ourselves senseless 
against it.  I saw a man do that once." 
</p><p>Ide, leaning with folded arms against the window-frame, 
watched her in silence as she moved restlessly about the room, 
gathering together some scattered books and tossing a handful of 
torn letters into the paper-basket.  When she ceased, he rejoined: 
"All you say is based on preconceived theories.  Why didn't you put 
them to the test by coming down to meet your old friends?  Don't 
you see the inference they would naturally draw from your hiding 
yourself when they arrived?  It looked as though you were afraid of 
them&mdash;or as though you hadn't forgiven them.  Either way, you put 
them in the wrong, instead of waiting to let them put you in the 
right.  If Leila had buried herself in the desert, do you suppose 
society would have gone to fetch her out?  You say you were afraid 
for Leila, and that she was afraid for you.  Don't you see what all 
these complications of feeling mean?  Simply that you were too 
nervous at the moment to let things happen naturally, just as 
you're too nervous now to judge them rationally."  He paused and 
turned his eyes to her face.  "Don't try to just yet.  Give 
yourself a little more time.  Give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> a little more time.  I've 
always known it would take time." 
</p><p>He moved nearer, and she let him have her hand.  With the 
grave kindness of his face so close above her she felt like a child 
roused out of frightened dreams and finding a light in the room. 
</p><p>"Perhaps you're right," she heard herself begin; then 
something within her <pb n="594"/>  clutched her back, and her hand fell 
away from him. 
</p><p>"I know I'm right; trust me," he urged.  "We'll talk of this 
in Florence soon." 
</p><p>She stood before him, feeling with despair his kindness, his 
patience, and his unreality.  Everything he said seemed like a 
painted gauze let down between herself and the real facts of life; 
and a sudden desire seized her to tear the gauze into shreds. 
</p><p>She drew back a little and looked at him with a smile of 
superficial reassurance.  "You <hi rend="italic">are</hi> right&mdash;about not talking any 
longer now.  I'm nervous and tired, and it would do no good.  I 
brood over things too much.  As you say, I must try not to shrink 
from people."  She turned away and glanced at the clock.  "Why, 
it's only ten!  If I send you off, I shall begin to brood again; 
and if you stay, we shall go on talking about the same thing.  Why 
shouldn't we go down and see Margaret Wynn for half an hour?" 
</p><p>She spoke lightly and rapidly, her brilliant eyes on his face.  
As she watched him, she saw it change, as if her smile had thrown 
a too vivid light upon it. 
</p><p>"Oh, no&mdash;not to-night!" he exclaimed. 
</p><p>"Not to-night?  Why, what other night have I, when I'm off at 
dawn?  Besides, I want to show you at once that I mean to be more 
sensible&mdash;that I'm not going to be afraid of people any more.  And 
I should really like another glimpse of little Charlotte."  He 
stood before her, his hand in his beard, with the gesture he had in 
moments of perplexity.  "Come!" she ordered him gaily, turning to 
the door. 
</p><p>He followed her and laid his hand on the door-knob.  "Don't 
you think&mdash;hadn't you better let me go first and see?  They told me 
they'd had a tiring day at the dressmaker's.  I dare say they have 
gone to bed." 
</p><p>"But you said they'd a young man of Charlotte's dining with 
them.  Surely he wouldn't have left by ten?  At any rate, I'll go 
down with you and see.  It takes so long if one sends a servant 
first."  She put him gently aside, and then paused as a new thought 
struck her.  "Or wait; my maid's in the next room.  I'll tell her 
to go and ask if Margaret will receive me.  Yes, that's much the 
best way." 
</p><p>She turned back and went toward the door that led to her 
bedroom; but before she could open it she felt Ide's quick touch on 
her arm. 
</p><p>"I believe&mdash;I remember now&mdash;Charlotte's young man was 
suggesting that they should all go out&mdash;to a music-hall or 
something of the sort.  I'm sure&mdash;I'm positively sure, that you 
won't find them." 
</p><p>Her hand dropped from the door, his dropped from her arm, and 
as they drew back and faced each other she saw the blood rise 
slowly through his sallow skin, redden his neck and ears, encroach 
upon the edges of his beard, and settle in dull patches under his 
kind, troubled eyes.  She had seen the same blush on another face, 
and the same impulse of compassion she had then felt made her turn 
her gaze away again. 
</p><p>A knock on the door broke the silence, and a porter put his 
head into the room. 
</p><p>"It's only just to know how many pieces there'll be to go down 
to the steamer in the morning." 
</p><p>With the words she suddenly felt that the veil of painted 
gauze was torn in tatters, and that she was moving again among the 
grim edges of reality. 
</p><p>"Oh, dear," she exclaimed, "I never <hi rend="italic">can</hi> remember!  Wait a 
minute; I shall have to ask my maid." 
</p><p>She opened her bedroom door and called out briskly: "Annette!"
