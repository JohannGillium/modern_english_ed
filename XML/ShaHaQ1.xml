<l n="58">So frownd he once, when in an angry parle </l>
<l n="59">He smot the sleaded pollax on the yce, </l>

<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="63">In what particular to worke, I know not, </l>
<l n="64">But in the thought and scope of my opinion, </l>
<l n="65">This bodes some strange eruption to the state. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Mar.</speaker>
<l n="66">Good, now sit downe, and tell me he that knowes </l>
<l n="67">Why this same strikt and most obseruant watch, </l>
<l n="68">So nightly toyles the subiect of the land, </l>
<l n="69">And why such dayly cost of brazen Cannon </l>
<l n="70">And forraine marte, for implements of warre, </l>
<l n="71">Why such impresse of ship-writes, whose sore taske </l>
<l n="72">Does not diuide the sunday from the weeke: </l>
<l n="73">What might be toward that this sweaty march </l>
<l n="74">Doth make the night ioynt labourer with the day, </l>
<l n="75">Who is't that can informe me? </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="76">Mary that can I, at least the whisper goes so, </l>
<l n="77">Our late King, who as you know was by Fortenbrasse of Norway, </l>
<l n="78">Thereto prickt on by a most emulous cause, dared to </l>
<l n="79">The combate, in which our valiant Hamlet, </l>
<l n="80">For so this side of our knowne world esteemed him, </l>
<l n="81">Did slay this Fortenbrasse, </l>
<l n="82">Who by a seale compact well ratified, by law </l>
<l n="83">And heraldrie, did forfeit with his life all those </l>
<l n="84">His lands which he stoode seazed of by the conqueror, </l>
<l n="85">Against the which a moity competent, </l>
<l n="86">Was gaged by our King: </l>
<l n="87">Now sir, yong Fortenbrasse, </l>
<l n="88">Of inapproued mettle hot and full, </l>
<l n="89">Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there, </l>
<pb n="B2v" id="ShaHaQ1B2v"/>
<l n="90">Sharkt vp a sight of lawlesse Resolutes </l>
<l n="91">For food and diet to some enterprise, </l>
<l n="92">That hath a stomacke in't: and this (I take it) is the </l>
<l n="93">Chiefe head and ground of this our watch. </l>
<stage type="entrance">Enter the Ghost.</stage>
<l n="94">But loe, behold, see where it comes againe, </l>
<l n="95">Ile crosse it, though it blast me: stay illusion, </l>
<l n="96">If there be any good thing to be done, </l>
<l n="97">That may doe ease to thee, and grace to mee, </l>
<l n="98">Speake to mee. </l>
<l n="99">If thou art priuy to thy countries fate, </l>
<l n="100">Which happly foreknowing may preuent, O speake to me, </l>

<l n="102">Or hoorded treasure in the wombe of earth, </l>
<l n="103">For which they say you Spirites oft walke in death, speake </l>
<l n="104">to me, stay and speake, speake, stoppe it Marcellus. </l>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="106">Tis heere. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l n="107">Tis gone, O we doe it wrong, being so maiesticall, </l>
<l n="108">To offer it the shew of violence, </l>
<l n="109">For it is as the ayre invelmorable, </l>
<l n="110">And our vaine blowes malitious mockery. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>2.</speaker>
<l n="111">It was about to speake when the Cocke crew. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="112">And then it faded like a guilty thing, </l>
<l n="113">Vpon a fearefull summons: I haue heard </l>
<l n="114">The Cocke, that is the trumpet to the morning, </l>
<l n="115">Doth with his earely and shrill crowing throate, </l>
<l n="116">Awake the god of day, and at his sound, </l>
<l n="117">Whether in earth or ayre, in sea or fire, </l>
<l n="118">The strauagant and erring spirite hies </l>
<l n="119">To his confines, and of the trueth heereof </l>
<l n="120">This present obiect made probation. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l n="121">It faded on the crowing of the Cocke, </l>
<l n="122">Some say, that euer gainst that season comes, </l>
<l n="123">Wherein our Sauiours birth is celebrated, </l>
<l n="124">The bird of dawning singeth all night long, </l>
<pb n="B3" id="ShaHaQ1B3"/>
<l n="125">And then they say, no spirite dare walke abroade, </l>
<l n="126">The nights are wholesome, then no planet frikes, </l>
<l n="127">No Fairie takes, nor Witch hath powre to charme, </l>
<l n="128">So gratious, and so hallowed is that time. </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Hor.</speaker>
<l n="129">So haue I heard, and doe in parte beleeue it: </l>
<l n="130">But see the Sunne in russet mantle clad, </l>
<l n="131">Walkes ore the deaw of yon hie mountaine top, </l>
<l n="132">Breake we our watch vp, and by my aduise, </l>
<l n="133">Let vs impart what wee haue seene to night </l>
<l n="134">Vnto yong Hamlet: for vpon my life </l>
<l n="135">This Spirite dumbe to vs will speake to him: </l>
<l n="136">Do you consent, wee shall acquaint him with it, </l>
<l n="137">As needefull in our loue, fitting our duetie? </l>
</sp>
<sp><speaker>Marc.</speaker>
<l n="138">Lets doo't I pray, and I this morning know, </l>
<l n="139">Where we shall finde him most conueniently. </l>
