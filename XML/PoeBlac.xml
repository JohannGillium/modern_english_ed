<pb n="563"/>  
 
<p>For the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about 
to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief.  Mad indeed would I be 
to expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own 
evidence.  Yet, mad am I not &mdash; and very surely do I not dream.  But 
to-morrow I die, and to-day I would unburden my soul.  My immediate 
purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and 
without comment, a series of mere household events.  In their 
consequences, these events have terrified &mdash; have tortured &mdash; have 
destroyed me.  Yet I will not attempt to expound them.  To me, they 
have presented little but horror &mdash; to many they will seem less 
terrible than <hi rend="italic">baroques</hi>.  Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may 
be found which will reduce my phantasm to the commonplace &mdash; some 
intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my 
own, which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with 
<pb n="564"/>  
awe, nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural 
causes and effects. 
</p><p>From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of 
my disposition.  My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as 
to make me the jest of my companions.  I was especially fond of 
animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of 
pets.  With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy 
as when feeding and caressing them.  This peculiarity of character 
grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of 
my principal sources of pleasure.  To those who have cherished an 
affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the 
trouble of explaining the nature of the intensity of the 
gratification thus derivable.  There is something in the unselfish 
and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the 
heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry 
friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere <hi rend="italic">Man</hi>. 
</p><p>I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a 
disposition not uncongenial with my own.  Observing my partiality 
for domestic pets, she lost no opportunity of procuring those of 
the most agreeable kind.  We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, 
rabbits, a small monkey, and <hi rend="italic">a cat</hi>. 
</p><p>This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, 
entirely black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree.  In 
speaking of his intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a 
little tinctured with superstition, made frequent allusion to the 
ancient popular notion, which regarded all black cats as witches in 
disguise.  Not that she was ever <hi rend="italic">serious</hi> upon this point &mdash; and 
I mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it 
happens, just now, to be remembered. 
</p><p>Pluto &mdash; this was the cat's name &mdash; was my favourite pet and 
playmate.  I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went 
about the house.  It was even with difficulty that I could prevent 
him from following me through the streets. 
</p><p>Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, 
during which my general temperament and character &mdash; through the 
instrumentality of the fiend Intemperance &mdash; had (I blush to confess 
it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse.  I grew, day by 
day, more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings 
<pb n="565"/>  
of others.  I suffered myself to use intemperate language 
to my wife.  At length, I even offered her personal violence.  My 
pets, of course, were made to feel the change in my disposition. 
I not only neglected, but ill-used them.  For Pluto, however, I 
still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from maltreating 
him, as I made no scruple of maltreating the rabbits, the monkey, 
or even the dog, when by accident, or through affection, they came 
in my way.  But my disease grew upon me &mdash; for what disease is like 
alcohol? &mdash; and at length even Pluto, who was now becoming old, and 
consequently somewhat peevish &mdash; even Pluto began to experience the 
effects of my ill-temper. 
</p><p>One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my 
haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.  I 
seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a 
slight wound upon my hand with his teeth.  The fury of a demon 
instantly possessed me.  I knew myself no longer.  My original soul 
seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body; and a more than 
fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of my 
frame.  I took from my waistcoat pocket a pen-knife, opened it, 
grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of 
its eyes from the socket!  I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen 
the damnable atrocity. 
</p><p>When reason returned with the morning &mdash; when I had slept off 
the fumes of the night's debauch &mdash; I experienced a sentiment half of 
horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; 
but it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul 
remained untouched.  I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned 
in wine all memory of the deed. 
</p><p>In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.  The socket of the 
lost eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no 
longer appeared to suffer any pain.  He went about the house as 
usual, but, as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my 
approach.  I had so much of my old heart left, as to be at first 
grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had 
once so loved me.  But this feeling soon gave place to irritation. 
And then came, as if to my final and irrevocable overthrow, the 
spirit of PERVERSENESS.  Of this spirit philosophy takes no 
account.  Yet I am not more sure that my soul lives, than I am that 
perverseness is one 
<pb n="566"/>  
of the primitive impulses of the human 
heart &mdash; one of the indivisible primary faculties, or sentiments, 
which give direction to the character of man.  Who has not, a 
hundred times, found himself committing a vile or a silly action, 
for no other reason than because he knows he should <hi rend="italic">not</hi>?  Have 
we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgment, 
to violate that which is <hi rend="italic">Law</hi>, merely because we understand it 
to be such?  This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to my final 
overthrow.  It was this unfathomable longing of the soul <hi rend="italic">to vex 
itself</hi> &mdash; to offer violence to its own nature &mdash; to do wrong for the 
wrong's sake only &mdash; that urged me to continue and finally to 
consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute. 
One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and 
hung it to the limb of a tree &mdash; hung it with the tears streaming 
from my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart &mdash; hung it 
<hi rend="italic">because</hi> I knew that it had loved me, and <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I felt it 
had given me no reason of offence &mdash; hung it <hi rend="italic">because</hi> I knew that 
in so doing I was committing a sin &mdash; a deadly sin that would so 
jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it &mdash; if such a thing were 
possible &mdash; even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of the Most 
Merciful and Most Terrible God. 
</p><p>On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I 
was aroused from sleep by the cry of 'Fire!'  The curtains of my 
bed were in flames.  The whole house was blazing.  It was with 
great difficulty that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our 
escape from the conflagration.  The destruction was complete.  My 
entire worldly wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself 
thenceforward to despair. 
</p><p>I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of 
cause and effect between the disaster and the atrocity.  But I am 
detailing a chain of facts, and wish not to leave even a possible 
link imperfect.  On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the 
ruins.  The walls, with one exception, had fallen in.  This 
exception was found in a compartment wall, not very thick, which 
stood about the middle of the house, and against which had rested 
the head of my bed.  The plastering had here, in great measure, 
resisted the action of the fire &mdash; a fact which I attributed to its 
having been recently spread.  About this wall a dense crowd were 
collected, and many persons seemed to be examining a particular 
portion of it with 
<pb n="567"/>  
very minute and eager attention.  The 
words 'strange!' 'singular!' and other similar expressions, excited 
my curiosity.  I approached and saw, as if graven in bas-relief 
upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic <hi rend="italic">cat</hi>.  The 
impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.  There was 
a rope about the animal's neck. 
</p><p>When I first beheld this apparition &mdash; for I could scarcely 
regard it as less &mdash; my wonder and my terror were extreme.  But at 
length reflection came to my aid.  The cat, I remembered, had been 
hung in a garden adjacent to the house.  Upon the alarm of fire, 
this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd &mdash; by some one 
of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, 
through an open window, into my chamber.  This had probably been 
done with the view of arousing me from sleep.  The falling of other 
walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of 
the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of which, with the flames and 
the <hi rend="italic">ammonia</hi> from the carcass, had then accomplished the 
portraiture as I saw it. 
</p><p>Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not 
altogether to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, 
it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy. 
For months I could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, 
during this period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment 
that seemed, but was not, remorse.  I went so far as to regret the 
loss of the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts 
which I now habitually frequented, for another pet of the same 
species, and of somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply 
its place. 
</p><p>One night as I sat, half-stupefied, in a den of more than 
infamy, my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, 
reposing upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of gin, or 
of rum, which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.  I 
had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some 
minutes, and what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had 
not sooner perceived the object thereupon.  I approached it, and 
touched it with my hand.  It was a black cat &mdash; a very large one &mdash; 
fully as large as Pluto, and closely resembling him in every 
respect but one.  Pluto had not a white hair upon any portion of 
his body; but this 
<pb n="568"/>  
cat had a large, although indefinite, 
splotch of white, covering nearly the whole region of the breast. 
</p><p>Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly, 
rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice. 
This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search.  I at 
once offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made 
no claim to it &mdash; knew nothing of it &mdash; had never seen it before. 
</p><p>I continued my caresses, and when I prepared to go home, the 
animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.  I permitted it to do 
so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded.  When it 
reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became 
immediately a great favourite with my wife. 
</p><p>For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within 
me.  This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but &mdash; I 
know not how or why it was &mdash; its evident fondness for myself rather 
disgusted and annoyed me.  By slow degrees, these feelings of 
disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.  I 
avoided the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance 
of my former deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing 
it.  I did not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill-use it; but gradually &mdash; very gradually &mdash; I came to look upon it with 
unutterable loathing, and to flee silently from its odious 
presence, as from the breath of a pestilence. 
</p><p>What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the 
discovery, on the morning after I brought it home, that, like 
Pluto, it also had been deprived of one of its eyes.  This 
circumstance, however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have 
already said, possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling 
which had once been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many 
of my simplest and purest pleasures. 
</p><p>With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for 
myself seemed to increase.  It followed my footsteps with a 
pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader 
comprehend.  Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or 
spring upon my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses.  If 
I arose to walk, it would get between my feet, and thus nearly 
throw me down, or, fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, 
clamber, in this manner, to my breast.  At such times, although I 
longed to 
<pb n="569"/>  
destroy it with a blow, I was yet withheld from 
so doing, partly by a memory of my former crime, but chiefly &mdash; let 
me confess it at once &mdash; by absolute <hi rend="italic">dread</hi> of the beast. 
</p><p>This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil &mdash; and yet 
I should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.  I am almost 
ashamed to own &mdash; yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed 
to own &mdash; that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired 
me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimeras it would be 
possible to conceive.  My wife had called my attention, more than 
once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have 
spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between 
the strange beast and the one I had destroyed.  The reader will 
remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very 
indefinite; but, by slow degrees &mdash; degrees nearly imperceptible, and 
which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful &mdash; it 
had, at length, resumed a rigorous distinctness of outline.  It was 
now the representation of an object that I shudder to name &mdash; and for 
this, above all, I loathed, and dreaded, and would have rid myself 
of the monster <hi rend="italic">had I dared</hi> &mdash; it was now, I say, the image of a 
hideous &mdash; of a ghastly thing &mdash; of the GALLOWS! &mdash; oh, mournful and 
terrible engine of horror and of crime &mdash; of agony and death! 
</p><p>And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere 
humanity.  And a <hi rend="italic">brute beast</hi> &mdash; whose fellow I had contemptuously 
destroyed &mdash; a <hi rend="italic">brute beast</hi> to work out for <hi rend="italic">me</hi> &mdash; for me, a man, 
fashioned in the image of the High God &mdash; so much of insufferable 
woe!  Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of rest 
any more!  During the former the creature left me no moment alone; 
and, in the latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable 
fear, to find the hot breath of <hi rend="italic">the thing</hi> upon my face, and its 
vast weight &mdash; an incarnate nightmare that I had no power to shake 
off &mdash; incumbent eternally upon my <hi rend="italic">heart</hi>! 
</p><p>Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble 
remnant of the good within me succumbed.  Evil thoughts became my 
sole intimates &mdash; the darkest and most evil of thoughts.  The 
moodiness of my usual temper increased to hatred of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> things 
and of all mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and 
ungovernable outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned 
<pb n="570"/>  
myself, my uncomplaining wife, alas! was the most usual and 
the most patient of sufferers. 
</p><p>One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into 
the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to 
inhabit.  The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly 
throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness.  Uplifting an axe, 
and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto 
stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course, 
would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished. 
But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.  Goaded, by the 
interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm 
from her grasp, and buried the axe in her brain.  She fell dead 
upon the spot, without a groan. 
</p><p>This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and 
with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body.  I 
knew that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by 
night, without the risk of being observed by the neighbours.  Many 
projects entered my mind.  At one period I thought of cutting the 
corpse into minute fragments and destroying them by fire.  At 
another, I resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the 
cellar.  Again, I deliberated about casting it into the well in the 
yard &mdash; about packing it in a box, as if merchandise, with the usual 
arrangements, and so getting a porter to take it from the house. 
Finally I hit upon what I considered a far better expedient than 
either of these.  I determined to wall it up in the cellar &mdash; as the 
monks of the Middle Ages are recorded to have walled up their 
victims. 
</p><p>For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.  Its 
walls were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered 
throughout with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the 
atmosphere had prevented from hardening.  Moreover, in one of the 
walls was a projection, caused by a false chimney, or fire-place, 
that had been filled up and made to resemble the rest of the 
cellar.  I made no doubt that I could readily displace the bricks 
at this point, insert the corpse, and wall the whole up as before, 
so that no eye could detect anything suspicious. 
</p><p>And in this calculation I was not deceived.  By means of a 
crowbar I easily dislodged the bricks, and having carefully 
<pb n="571"/>  
deposited the body against the inner wall, I propped it in that 
position, while, with little trouble, I relaid the whole structure 
as it originally stood.  Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, 
with every possible precaution, I prepared a plaster which could 
not be distinguished from the old, and with this I very carefully 
went over the new brickwork.  When I had finished, I felt satisfied 
that all was right.  The wall did not present the slightest 
appearance of having been disturbed.  The rubbish on the floor was 
picked up with the minutest care.  I looked around triumphantly, 
and said to myself, 'Here at least, then, my labour has not been in 
vain.' 
</p><p>My next step was to look for the beast which had been the 
cause of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly 
resolved to put it to death.  Had I been able to meet with it at 
the moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it 
appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of 
my previous anger, and forbore to present itself in my present 
mood.  It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the 
blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature 
occasioned in my bosom.  It did not make its appearance during the 
night &mdash; and thus for one night at least, since its introduction into 
the house, I soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, <hi rend="italic">slept</hi> even with 
the burden of murder upon my soul! 
</p><p>The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor 
came not.  Once again I breathed as a free man.  The monster, in 
terror, had fled the premises for ever!  I should behold it no 
more!  My happiness was supreme!  The guilt of my dark deed 
disturbed me but little.  Some few inquiries had been made, but 
these had been readily answered.  Even a search had been 
instituted &mdash; but of course nothing was to be discovered.  I looked 
upon my future felicity as secured. 
</p><p>Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the 
police came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again 
to make rigorous investigation of the premises.  Secure, however, 
in the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no 
embarrassment whatever.  The officers bade me accompany them in 
their search.  They left no nook or corner unexplored.  At length, 
for the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar.  I 
quivered not in a muscle.  My heart beat calmly as that of one who 
slumbers in 
<pb n="572"/>  
innocence.  I walked the cellar from end to 
end.  I folded my arms upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro. 
The police were thoroughly satisfied, and prepared to depart.  The 
glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained.  I burned to say 
if but one word, by way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their 
assurance of my guiltlessness. 
</p><p>'Gentlemen,' I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, 
'I delight to have allayed your suspicions.  I wish you all health, 
and a little more courtesy.  By-the-by, gentlemen, this &mdash; this is a 
very well-constructed house.'  (In the rabid desire to say 
something easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.)  'I may 
say an <hi rend="italic">excellently</hi> well-constructed house.  These walls &mdash; are 
you going, gentlemen? &mdash; these walls are solidly put together'; and 
here, through the mere frenzy of bravado, I rapped heavily, with a 
cane which I held in my hand, upon that very portion of the 
brickwork behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom. 
</p><p>But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs on the Arch-Fiend!  No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk into 
silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb! &mdash; by 
a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child, 
and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous 
scream, half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have 
arisen only out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the damned 
in their agony and of the demons that exult in the damnation. 
</p><p>Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.  Swooning, I 
staggered to the opposite wall.  For one instant the party upon the 
stairs remained motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe.

whose craft had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice 
had consigned me to the hangman.  I had walled the monster up 
within the tomb!
