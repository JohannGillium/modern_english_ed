<head>I</head>


<p>ANDREY VASSILITCH KOVRIN, who held a master's
degree at the University, had exhausted himself,
and had upset his nerves.  He did not send for a
doctor, but casually, over a bottle of wine, he spoke
to a friend who was a doctor, and the latter advised
him to spend the spring and summer in the country.
Very opportunely a long letter came from Tanya
Pesotsky, who asked him to come and stay with them
at Borissovka.  And he made up his mind that he
really must go.

</p><p>To begin with &mdash; that was in April &mdash; he went to
his own home, Kovrinka, and there spent three weeks
in solitude; then, as soon as the roads were in good
condition, he set off, driving in a carriage, to visit
Pesotsky, his former guardian, who had brought him
up, and was a horticulturist well known all over
Russia.  The distance from Kovrinka to Borissovka
was reckoned only a little over fifty miles.  To drive
along a soft road in May in a comfortable carriage
with springs was a real pleasure.

</p><p>Pesotsky had an immense house with columns and
lions, off which the stucco was peeling, and with a
footman in swallow-tails at the entrance.  The old
park, laid out in the English style, gloomy and severe,


   <pb n="104"/>

stretched for almost three-quarters of a mile to the river, and there
ended in a steep, precipitous clay bank, where pines grew with bare
roots that looked like shaggy paws; the water shone below with an
unfriendly gleam, and the peewits flew up with a plaintive cry, and
there one always felt that one must sit down and write a ballad.  But
near the house itself, in the courtyard and orchard, which together with
the nurseries covered ninety acres, it was all life and gaiety even in
bad weather.  Such marvellous roses, lilies, camellias; such tulips of
all possible shades, from glistening white to sooty black &mdash; such a
wealth of flowers, in fact, Kovrin had never seen anywhere as at
Pesotsky's.  It was only the beginning of spring, and the real glory of
the flower-beds was still hidden away in the hot-houses.  But even the
flowers along the avenues, and here and there in the flower-beds, were
enough to make one feel, as one walked about the garden, as though one
were in a realm of tender colours, especially in the early morning when
the dew was glistening on every petal.

</p><p>What was the decorative part of the garden, and what Pesotsky
contemptuously spoke of as rubbish, had at one time in his childhood
given Kovrin an impression of fairyland.

</p><p>Every sort of caprice, of elaborate monstrosity
and mockery at Nature was here.  There were
espaliers of fruit-trees, a pear-tree in the shape of
a pyramidal poplar, spherical oaks and lime-trees,
an apple-tree in the shape of an umbrella, plum-trees
trained into arches, crests, candelabra, and even into
the number 1862 &mdash; the year when Pesotsky first


   <pb n="105"/>

took up horticulture.  One came across, too, lovely,
graceful trees with strong, straight stems like palms,
and it was only by looking intently that one could
recognise these trees as gooseberries or currants.
But what made the garden most cheerful and gave
it a lively air, was the continual coming and going
in it, from early morning till evening; people with
wheelbarrows, shovels, and watering-cans swarmed
round the trees and bushes, in the avenues and the
flower-beds, like ants. . . .

</p><p>Kovrin arrived at Pesotsky's at ten o'clock in the
evening.  He found Tanya and her father, Yegor
Semyonitch, in great anxiety.  The clear starlight
sky and the thermometer foretold a frost towards
morning, and meanwhile Ivan Karlitch, the gardener,
had gone to the town, and they had no one to rely
upon.  At supper they talked of nothing but the
morning frost, and it was settled that Tanya should
not go to bed, and between twelve and one should
walk through the garden, and see that everything
was done properly, and Yegor Semyonitch should
get up at three o'clock or even earlier.

</p><p>Kovrin sat with Tanya all the evening, and after midnight went
out with her into the garden.  It was cold.  There was a strong smell of
burning already in the garden.  In the big orchard, which was called the
commercial garden, and which brought Yegor Semyonitch several thousand
clear profit, a thick, black, acrid smoke was creeping over the ground
and, curling around the trees, was saving those thousands from the
frost.  Here the trees were arranged as on a chessboard, in straight and
regular rows like


   <pb n="106"/>

ranks of soldiers, and this severe pedantic regularity,
and the fact that all the trees were of the same size,
and had tops and trunks all exactly alike, made them
look monotonous and even dreary.  Kovrin and
Tanya walked along the rows where fires of dung,
straw, and all sorts of refuse were smouldering, and
from time to time they were met by labourers who
wandered in the smoke like shadows.  The only
trees in flower were the cherries, plums, and certain
sorts of apples, but the whole garden was plunged
in smoke, and it was only near the nurseries that
Kovrin could breathe freely.

</p><p>"Even as a child I used to sneeze from the smoke
here," he said, shrugging his shoulders, "but to this
day I don't understand how smoke can keep off
frost."

</p><p>"Smoke takes the place of clouds when there are
none . . ." answered Tanya.

</p><p>"And what do you want clouds for?"

</p><p>"In overcast and cloudy weather there is no

</p><p>frost."

</p><p>"You don't say so."

</p><p>He laughed and took her arm.  Her broad, very earnest face,
chilled with the frost, with her delicate black eyebrows, the turned-up
collar of her coat, which prevented her moving her head freely, and the
whole of her thin, graceful figure, with her skirts tucked up on account
of the dew, touched him.

</p><p>"Good heavens! she is grown up," he said.
"When I went away from here last, five years ago,
you were still a child.  You were such a thin, longlegged creature, with your hair hanging on your


   <pb n="107"/>

shoulders; you used to wear short frocks, and I used
to tease you, calling you a heron. . . .  What time
does!"

</p><p>"Yes, five years!" sighed Tanya.  "Much
water has flowed since then.  Tell me, Andryusha,
honestly," she began eagerly, looking him in the
face: "do you feel strange with us now?  But why
do I ask you?  You are a man, you live your own
interesting life, you are somebody. . . .  To grow
apart is so natural!  But however that may be,
Andryusha, I want you to think of us as your people.
We have a right to that."

</p><p>"I do, Tanya."

</p><p>"On your word of honour?"

</p><p>"Yes, on my word of honour."

</p><p>"You were surprised this evening that we have
so many of your photographs.  You know my
father adores you.  Sometimes it seems to me that
he loves you more than he does me.  He is proud
of you.  You are a clever, extraordinary man, you
have made a brilliant career for yourself, and he is
persuaded that you have turned out like this because
he brought you up.  I don't try to prevent him from
thinking so.  Let him."

</p><p>Dawn was already beginning, and that was especially perceptible
from the distinctness with which the coils of smoke and the tops of the
trees began to stand out in the air.

</p><p>"It's time we were asleep, though," said Tanya, "and it's cold,
too."  She took his arm.  "Thank you for coming, Andryusha.  We have
only uninteresting acquaintances, and not many of them.  We


   <pb n="108"/>

have only the garden, the garden, the garden, and nothing else.
Standards, half-standards," she laughed.  "Aports, Reinettes,
Borovinkas, budded stocks, grafted stocks. . . .  All, all our life has
gone into the garden.  I never even dream of anything but apples and
pears.  Of course, it is very nice and useful, but sometimes one longs
for something else for variety.  I remember that when you used to come
to us for the summer holidays, or simply a visit, it always seemed to be
fresher and brighter in the house, as though the covers had been taken
off the lustres and the furniture.  I was only a little girl then, but
yet I understood it."

</p><p>She talked a long while and with great feeling.  For some reason
the idea came into his head that in the course of the summer he might
grow fond of this little, weak, talkative creature, might be carried
away and fall in love; in their position it was so possible and natural!
This thought touched and amused him; he bent down to her sweet,
preoccupied face and hummed softly:

</p><p>"'Onyegin, I won't conceal it;

</p><p>  I madly love Tatiana. . . .'"

</p><p>By the time they reached the house, Yegor Semyonitch had got up.
Kovrin did not feel sleepy; he talked to the old man and went to the
garden with him.  Yegor Semyonitch was a tall, broad-shouldered,
corpulent man, and he suffered from asthma, yet he walked so fast that
it was hard work to hurry after him.  He had an extremely preoccupied
air; he was always hurrying somewhere, with an expression


   <pb n="109"/>

that suggested that if he were one minute late
all would be ruined!

</p><p>"Here is a business, brother . . ." he began,
standing still to take breath.  "On the surface of
the ground, as you see, is frost; but if you raise the
thermometer on a stick fourteen feet above the
ground, there it is warm. . . .  Why is that?"

</p><p>"I really don't know," said Kovrin, and he
laughed.

</p><p>"H'm! . . .  One can't know everything, of
course. . . .  However large the intellect may be,
you can't find room for everything in it.  I suppose
you still go in chiefly for philosophy?"

</p><p>"Yes, I lecture in psychology; I am working at
philosophy in general."

</p><p>"And it does not bore you?"

</p><p>"On the contrary, it's all I live for."

</p><p>"Well, God bless you! . . ." said Yegor Semyonitch, meditatively
stroking his grey whiskers.  "God bless you! . . .  I am delighted about
you . . . delighted, my boy. . . ."

</p><p>But suddenly he listened, and, with a terrible face,
ran off and quickly disappeared behind the trees in
a cloud of smoke.

</p><p>"Who tied this horse to an apple-tree?" Kovrin
heard his despairing, heart-rending cry.  "Who is
the low scoundrel who has dared to tie this horse to
an apple-tree?  My God, my God!  They have
ruined everything; they have spoilt everything; they
have done everything filthy, horrible, and abominable.
The orchard's done for, the orchard's ruined.  My
God!"


   <pb n="110"/>

</p><p>When he came back to Kovrin, his face looked
exhausted and mortified.
</p><p>"What is one to do with these accursed people?"
he said in a tearful voice, flinging up his hands.
"Styopka was carting dung at night, and tied the
horse to an apple-tree!  He twisted the reins round
it, the rascal, as tightly as he could, so that the bark
is rubbed off in three places.  What do you think
of that!  I spoke to him and he stands like a post
and only blinks his eyes.  Hanging is too good for
him."
</p><p>Growing calmer, he embraced Kovrin and kissed
him on the cheek.
</p><p>"Well, God bless you! . . . God bless you!
. . ." he muttered.  "I am very glad you have
come.  Unutterably glad. . . .  Thank you."
</p><p>Then, with the same rapid step and preoccupied
face, he made the round of the whole garden, and
showed his former ward all his greenhouses and
hot-houses, his covered-in garden, and two apiaries
which he called the marvel of our century.
</p><p>While they were walking the sun rose, flooding
the garden with brilliant light.  It grew warm.
Foreseeing a long, bright, cheerful day, Kovrin
recollected that it was only the beginning of May,
and that he had before him a whole summer as
bright, cheerful, and long; and suddenly there stirred
in his bosom a joyous, youthful feeling, such as he
used to experience in his childhood, running about
in that garden.  And he hugged the old man and
kissed him affectionately.  Both of them, feeling
touched, went indoors and drank tea out of old-fashioned


   <pb n="111"/>

china cups, with cream and satisfying krendels made with milk
and eggs; and these trifles reminded Kovrin again of his childhood and
boyhood.  The delightful present was blended with the impressions of the
past that stirred within him; there was a tightness at his heart; yet he
was happy.

</p><p>He waited till Tanya was awake and had coffee
with her, went for a walk, then went to his room
and sat down to work.  He read attentively, making
notes, and from time to time raised his eyes to look
out at the open windows or at the fresh, still dewy
flowers in the vases on the table; and again he
dropped his eyes to his book, and it seemed to him as
though every vein in his body was quivering and
fluttering with pleasure.
</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d5">
<head>II</head>

<p>In the country he led just as nervous and restless
a life as in town.  He read and wrote a great deal,
he studied Italian, and when he was out for a walk,
thought with pleasure that he would soon sit down
to work again.  He slept so little that every one
wondered at him; if he accidently [sic] dozed for half
an hour in the daytime, he would lie awake all night,
and, after a sleepless night, would feel cheerful and
vigorous as though nothing had happened.
</p><p>He talked a great deal, drank wine, and smoked
expensive cigars.  Very often, almost every day,
young ladies of neighbouring families would come
to the Pesotskys', and would sing and play the piano
with Tanya; sometimes a young neighbour who was


   <pb n="112"/>

a good violinist would come, too.  Kovrin listened
with eagerness to the music and singing, and was
exhausted by it, and this showed itself by his eyes
closing and his head falling to one side.

</p><p>One day he was sitting on the balcony after evening tea, reading.
At the same time, in the drawing-room, Tanya taking soprano, one of the
young ladies a contralto, and the young man with his violin, were
practising a well-known serenade of Braga's.  Kovrin listened to the
words &mdash; they were Russian &mdash; and could not understand their meaning.
At last, leaving his book and listening attentively, he understood: a
maiden, full of sick fancies, heard one night in her garden mysterious
sounds, so strange and lovely that she was obliged to recognise them as
a holy harmony which is unintelligible to us mortals, and so flies back
to heaven.  Kovrin's eyes began to close.  He got up, and in exhaustion
walked up and down the drawing-room, and then the dining-room.  When the
singing was over he took Tanya's arm, and with her went out on the
balcony.

</p><p>"I have been all day thinking of a legend," he
said.  "I don't remember whether I have read it
somewhere or heard it, but it is a strange and almost
grotesque legend.  To begin with, it is somewhat
obscure.  A thousand years ago a monk, dressed in
black, wandered about the desert, somewhere in
Syria or Arabia. . . .  Some miles from where he
was, some fisherman saw another black monk, who
was moving slowly over the surface of a lake.  This
second monk was a mirage.  Now forget all the


   <pb n="113"/>

laws of optics, which the legend does not recognise, and listen to the
rest.  From that mirage there was cast another mirage, then from that
other a third, so that the image of the black monk began to be repeated
endlessly from one layer of the atmosphere to another.  So that he was
seen at one time in Africa, at another in Spain, then in Italy, then in
the Far North. . . .  Then he passed out of the atmosphere of the earth,
and now he is wandering all over the universe, still never coming into
conditions in which he might disappear.  Possibly he may be seen now in
Mars or in some star of the Southern Cross.  But, my dear, the real
point on which the whole legend hangs lies in the fact that, exactly a
thousand years from the day when the monk walked in the desert, the
mirage will return to the atmosphere of the earth again and will appear
to men.  And it seems that the thousand years is almost up. . . .
According to the legend, we may look out for the black monk to-day or
to-morrow."

</p><p>"A queer mirage," said Tanya, who did not like
the legend.
</p><p>"But the most wonderful part of it all," laughed
Kovrin, "is that I simply cannot recall where I
got this legend from.  Have I read it somewhere?
Have I heard it?  Or perhaps I dreamed of the
black monk.  I swear I don't remember.  But the
legend interests me.  I have been thinking about
it all day."
</p><p>Letting Tanya go back to her visitors, he went
out of the house, and, lost in meditation, walked
by the flower-beds.  The sun was already setting.


   <pb n="114"/>

The flowers, having just been watered, gave forth a damp, irritating
fragrance.  Indoors they began singing again, and in the distance the
violin had the effect of a human voice.  Kovrin, racking his brains to
remember where he had read or heard the legend, turned slowly towards
the park, and unconsciously went as far as the river.  By a little path
that ran along the steep bank, between the bare roots, he went down to
the water, disturbed the peewits there and frightened two ducks.  The
last rays of the setting sun still threw light here and there on the
gloomy pines, but it was quite dark on the surface of the river.  Kovrin
crossed to the other side by the narrow bridge.  Before him lay a wide
field covered with young rye not yet in blossom.  There was no living
habitation, no living soul in the distance, and it seemed as though the
little path, if one went along it, would take one to the unknown,
mysterious place where the sun had just gone down, and where the evening
glow was flaming in immensity and splendour.

</p><p>"How open, how free, how still it is here!"
thought Kovrin, walking along the path.  "And it
feels as though all the world were watching me,
hiding and waiting for me to understand it. . . ."
</p><p>But then waves began running across the rye, and
a light evening breeze softly touched his uncovered
head.  A minute later there was another gust of
wind, but stronger &mdash; the rye began rustling, and he
heard behind him the hollow murmur of the pines.
Kovrin stood still in amazement.  From the horizon
there rose up to the sky, like a whirlwind or a waterspout,


   <pb n="115"/>

a tall black column.  Its outline was indistinct, but from the first
instant it could be seen that it was not standing still, but moving with
fearful rapidity, moving straight towards Kovrin, and the nearer it came
the smaller and the more distinct it was.  Kovrin moved aside into the
rye to make way for it, and only just had time to do so.

</p><p>A monk, dressed in black, with a grey head and black eyebrows,
his arms crossed over his breast, floated by him. . . .  His bare feet
did not touch the earth.  After he had floated twenty feet beyond him,
he looked round at Kovrin, and nodded to him with a friendly but sly
smile.  But what a pale, fearfully pale, thin face!  Beginning to grow
larger again, he flew across the river, collided noiselessly with the
clay bank and pines, and passing through them, vanished like smoke.

</p><p>"Why, you see," muttered Kovrin, "there must be truth in the
legend."

</p><p>Without trying to explain to himself the strange apparition, glad
that he had succeeded in seeing so near and so distinctly, not only the
monk's black garments, but even his face and eyes, agreeably excited, he
went back to the house.

</p><p>In the park and in the garden people were moving
about quietly, in the house they were playing &mdash; so
he alone had seen the monk.  He had an intense
desire to tell Tanya and Yegor Semyonitch, but he
reflected that they would certainly think his words
the ravings of delirium, and that would frighten
them; he had better say nothing.
</p><p>He laughed aloud, sang, and danced the mazurka;


   <pb n="116"/>

he was in high spirits, and all of them, the visitors
and Tanya, thought he had a peculiar look, radiant
and inspired, and that he was very interesting.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d6">
<head>III</head>

<p>After supper, when the visitors had gone, he went
to his room and lay down on the sofa: he wanted
to think about the monk.  But a minute later Tanya
came in.
</p><p>"Here, Andryusha; read father's articles," she
said, giving him a bundle of pamphlets and proofs.
"They are splendid articles.  He writes capitally."
</p><p>"Capitally, indeed!" said Yegor Semyonitch,
following her and smiling constrainedly; he was
ashamed.  "Don't listen to her, please; don't read
them!  Though, if you want to go to sleep, read
them by all means; they are a fine soporific."
</p><p>"I think they are splendid articles," said Tanya,
with deep conviction.  "You read them, Andryusha,
and persuade father to write oftener.  He could
write a complete manual of horticulture."
</p><p>Yegor Semyonitch gave a forced laugh, blushed,
and began uttering the phrases usually made us of
by an embarrassed author.  At last he began to give
way.
</p><p>"In that case, begin with Gaucher's article and
these Russian articles," he muttered, turning over
the pamphlets with a trembling hand, "or else you
won't understand.  Before you read my objections,
you must know what I am objecting to.  But it's


   <pb n="117"/>

all nonsense . . . tiresome stuff.  Besides, I believe it's bedtime."

</p><p>Tanya went away.  Yegor Semyonitch sat down
on the sofa by Kovrin and heaved a deep sigh.
</p><p>"Yes, my boy . . ." he began after a pause.
"That's how it is, my dear lecturer.  Here I write
articles, and take part in exhibitions, and receive
medals. . . .  Pesotsky, they say, has apples the
size of a head, and Pesotsky, they say, has made
his fortune with his garden.  In short, 'Kotcheby
is rich and glorious.'  But one asks oneself: what is
it all for?  The garden is certainly fine, a model.
It's not really a garden, but a regular institution,
which is of the greatest public importance because
it marks, so to say, a new era in Russian agriculture
and Russian industry.  But, what's it for?  What's
the object of it?"
</p><p>"The fact speaks for itself."

</p><p>"I do not mean in that sense.  I meant to ask:  what will happen
to the garden when I die?  In the condition in which you see it now, it
would not be maintained for one month without me.  The whole secret of
success lies not in its being a big garden or a great number of
labourers being employed in it, but in the fact that I love the work.
Do you understand?  I love it perhaps more than myself.  Look at me; I
do everything myself.  I work from morning to night: I do all the
grafting myself, the pruning myself, the planting myself.  I do it all
myself: when any one helps me I am jealous and irritable till I am rude.
The whole secret lies

in loving it &mdash; that is, in the sharp eye of the master;
yes, and in the master's hands, and in the feeling
that makes one, when one goes anywhere for an
hour's visit, sit, ill at ease, with one's heart far away,
afraid that something may have happened in the
garden.  But when I die, who will look after it?
Who will work?  The gardener?  The labourers?
Yes?  But I will tell you, my dear fellow, the worst
enemy in the garden is not a hare, not a cockchafer,
and not the frost, but any outside person."
</p><p>"And Tanya?" asked Kovrin, laughing.  "She
can't be more harmful than a hare?  She loves the
work and understands it."
</p><p>"Yes, she loves it and understands it.  If after
my death the garden goes to her and she is the
mistress, of course nothing better could be wished.
But if, which God forbid, she should marry," Yegor
Semyonitch whispered, and looked with a frightened
look at Kovrin, "that's just it.  If she marries and
children come, she will have no time to think about
the garden.  What I fear most is: she will marry
some fine gentleman, and he will be greedy, and he
will let the garden to people who will run it for profit,
and everything will go to the devil the very first
year!  In our work females are the scourge of
God!"
</p><p>Yegor Semyonitch sighed and paused for a
while.
</p><p>"Perhaps it is egoism, but I tell you frankly:
I don't want Tanya to get married.  I am afraid
of it!  There is one young dandy comes to see us,
bringing his violin and scraping on it; I know Tanya


   <pb n="119"/>

will not marry him, I know it quite well; but I can't
bear to see him!  Altogether, my boy, I am very
queer.  I know that."
</p><p>Yegor Semyonitch got up and walked about the
room in excitement, and it was evident that he
wanted to say something very important, but could
not bring himself to it.

</p><p>"I am very fond of you, and so I am going to speak to you
openly," he decided at last, thrusting his hands into his pockets.  "I
deal plainly with certain delicate questions, and say exactly what I
think, and I cannot endure so-called hidden thoughts.  I will speak
plainly: you are the only man to whom I should not be afraid to marry my
daughter.  You are a clever man with a good heart, and would not let my
beloved work go to ruin; and the chief reason is that I love you as a
son, and I am proud of you.  If Tanya and you could get up a romance
somehow, then &mdash; well!  I should be very glad and even happy.  I tell
you this plainly, without mincing matters, like an honest man."

</p><p>Kovrin laughed.  Yegor Semyonitch opened the
door to go out, and stood in the doorway.
</p><p>"If Tanya and you had a son, I would make a
horticulturist of him," he said, after a moment's
thought.  "However, this is idle dreaming.  Goodnight."

</p><p>Left alone, Kovrin settled himself more comfortably on the sofa
and took up the articles.  The title of one was "On Intercropping"; of
another, "A few Words on the Remarks of Monsieur Z.  concerning the
Trenching of the Soil for a New


   <pb n="120"/>

Garden"; a third, "Additional Matter concerning Grafting with a Dormant
Bud"; and they were all of the same sort.  But what a restless, jerky
tone!  What nervous, almost hysterical passion!  Here was an article,
one would have thought, with most peaceable and impersonal contents: the
subject of it was the Russian Antonovsky Apple.  But Yegor Semyonitch
began it with "Audiatur altera pars," and finished it with "Sapienti
sat"; and between these two quotations a perfect torrent of venomous
phrases directed "at the learned ignorance of our recognised
horticultural authorities, who observe Nature from the height of their
university chairs," or at Monsieur Gaucher, "whose success has been the
work of the vulgar and the dilettanti."  "And then followed an
inappropriate, affected, and insincere regret that peasants who stole
fruit and broke the branches could not nowadays be flogged.

</p><p>"It is beautiful, charming, healthy work, but even
in this there is strife and passion," thought Kovrin,
"I suppose that everywhere and in all careers men
of ideas are nervous, and marked by exaggerated
sensitiveness.  Most likely it must be so."
</p><p>He thought of Tanya, who was so pleased with
Yegor Semyonitch's articles.  Small, pale, and so
thin that her shoulder-blades stuck out, her eyes,
wide and open, dark and intelligent, had an intent
gaze, as though looking for something.  She walked
like her father with a little hurried step.  She talked
a great deal and was fond of arguing, accompanying
every phrase, however insignificant, with expressive


   <pb n="121"/>

mimicry and gesticulation.  No doubt she was nervous in the extreme.

</p><p>Kovrin went on reading the articles, but he understood nothing of
them, and flung them aside.  The same pleasant excitement with which he
had earlier in the evening danced the mazurka and listened to the music
was now mastering him again and rousing a multitude of thoughts.  He got
up and began walking about the room, thinking about the black monk.  It
occurred to him that if this strange, supernatural monk had appeared to
him only, that meant that he was ill and had reached the point of having
hallucinations.  This reflection frightened him, but not for long.

</p><p>"But I am all right, and I am doing no harm to
any one; so there is no harm in my hallucinations,"
he thought; and he felt happy again.

</p><p>He sat down on the sofa and clasped his hands round his head.
Restraining the unaccountable joy which filled his whole being, he then
paced up and down again, and sat down to his work.  But the thought that
he read in the book did not satisfy him.  He wanted something gigantic,
unfathomable, stupendous.  Towards morning he undressed and reluctantly
went to bed: he ought to sleep.

</p><p>When he heard the footsteps of Yegor Semyonitch going out into
the garden, Kovrin rang the bell and asked the footman to bring him some
wine.  He drank several glasses of Lafitte, then wrapped himself up,
head and all; his consciousness grew clouded and he fell asleep.

<head>IV</head>

<p>Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya often quarrelled
and said nasty things to each other.

</p><p>They quarrelled about something that morning.  Tanya burst out
crying and went to her room.  She would not come down to dinner nor to
tea.  At first Yegor Semyonitch went about looking sulky and dignified,
as though to give every one to understand that for him the claims of
justice and good order were more important than anything else in the
world; but he could not keep it up for long, and soon sank into
depression.  He walked about the park dejectedly, continually sighing:
"Oh, my God!  My God!" and at dinner did not eat a morsel.  At last,
guilty and conscience-stricken, he knocked at the locked door and called
timidly:

</p><p>"Tanya!  Tanya!"
</p><p>And from behind the door came a faint voice,
weak with crying but still determined:
</p><p>"Leave me alone, if you please."

</p><p>The depression of the master and mistress was reflected in the
whole household, even in the labourers working in the garden.  Kovrin
was absorbed in his interesting work, but at last he, too, felt dreary
and uncomfortable.  To dissipate the general ill-humour in some way, he
made up his mind to intervene, and towards evening he knocked at Tanya's
door.  He was admitted.

</p><p>"Fie, fie, for shame!" he began playfully, looking with surprise
at Tanya's tear-stained, woebegone


   <pb n="123"/>

face, flushed in patches with crying.  "Is it really
so serious?  Fie, fie!"
</p><p>"But if you knew how he tortures me!" she said,
and floods of scalding tears streamed from her big
eyes.  "He torments me to death," she went on,
wringing her hands.  "I said nothing to him . . .
nothing . . . I only said that there was no need to
keep . . . too many labourers . . . if we could
hire them by the day when we wanted them.  You
know . . . you know the labourers have been doing
nothing for a whole week. . . .  I . . . I . . .
only said that, and he shouted and . . . said . . .
a lot of horrible insulting things to me.  What
for?"
</p><p>"There, there," said Kovrin, smoothing her hair.
"You've quarrelled with each other, you've cried,
and that's enough.  You must not be angry for long
&mdash; that's wrong . . . all the more as he loves you
beyond everything."
</p><p>"He has . . . has spoiled my whole life," Tanya
went on, sobbing.  "I hear nothing but abuse and
. . . insults.  He thinks I am of no use in the house.
Well!  He is right.  I shall go away to-morrow; I
shall become a telegraph clerk. . . .  I don't
care. . . ."
</p><p>"Come, come, come. . . .  You mustn't cry,
Tanya.  You mustn't, dear. . . .  You are both
hot-tempered and irritable, and you are both to
blame.  Come along; I will reconcile you."
</p><p>Kovrin talked affectionately and persuasively,
while she went on crying, twitching her shoulders


   <pb n="124"/>

and wringing her hands, as though some terrible misfortune had really
befallen her.  He felt all the sorrier for her because her grief was not
a serious one, yet she suffered extremely.  What trivialities were
enough to make this little creature miserable for a whole day, perhaps
for her whole life!  Comforting Tanya, Kovrin thought that, apart from
this girl and her father, he might hunt the world over and would not
find people who would love him as one of themselves, as one of their
kindred.  If it had not been for those two he might very likely, having
lost his father and mother in early childhood, never to the day of his
death have known what was meant by genuine affection and that
na&iuml;ve, uncritical love which is only lavished on very close blood
relations; and he felt that the nerves of this weeping, shaking girl
responded to his half-sick, overstrained nerves like iron to a magnet.
He never could have loved a healthy, strong, rosy-cheeked woman, but
pale, weak, unhappy Tanya attracted him.

</p><p>And he liked stroking her hair and her shoulders,
pressing her hand and wiping away her tears. . . .
At last she left off crying.  She went on for a long
time complaining of her father and her hard, insufferable life in that house, entreating Kovrin to
put himself in her place; then she began, little by
little, smiling, and sighing that God had given her
such a bad temper.  At last, laughing aloud, she
called herself a fool, and ran out of the room.
</p><p>When a little later Kovrin went into the garden,
Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya were walking side by
side along an avenue as though nothing had happened,


   <pb n="125"/>


and both were eating rye bread with salt on
it, as both were hungry.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="5" id="d8">
<head>V</head>

<p>Glad that he had been so successful in the part of peacemaker,
Kovrin went into the park.  Sitting on a garden seat, thinking, he heard
the rattle of a carriage and a feminine laugh &mdash; visitors were arriving.
When the shades of evening began falling on the garden, the sounds of
the violin and singing voices reached him indistinctly, and that
reminded him of the black monk.  Where, in what land or in what planet,
was that optical absurdity moving now?

</p><p>Hardly had he recalled the legend and pictured in his imagination
the dark apparition he had seen in the rye-field, when, from behind a
pine-tree exactly opposite, there came out noiselessly, without the
slightest rustle, a man of medium height with uncovered grey head, all
in black, and barefooted like a beggar, and his black eyebrows stood out
conspicuously on his pale, death-like face.  Nodding his head
graciously, this beggar or pilgrim came noiselessly to the seat and sat
down, and Kovrin recognised him as the black monk.

</p><p>For a minute they looked at one another, Kovrin
with amazement, and the monk with friendliness,
and, just as before, a little slyness, as though he were
thinking something to himself.
</p><p>"But you are a mirage," said Kovrin.  "Why
are you here and sitting still?  That does not fit in
with the legend."


   <pb n="126"/>

</p><p>"That does not matter," the monk answered in a low voice, not
immediately turning his face towards him.  "The legend, the mirage, and
I are all the products of your excited imagination.  I am a phantom."

</p><p>"Then you don't exist?" said Kovrin.
</p><p>"You can think as you like," said the monk, with
a faint smile.  "I exist in your imagination, and
your imagination is part of nature, so I exist in
nature."

</p><p>"You have a very old, wise, and extremely expressive face, as
though you really had lived more than a thousand years," said Kovrin.
"I did not know that my imagination was capable of creating such
phenomena.  But why do you look at me with such enthusiasm?  Do you like
me?"

</p><p>"Yes, you are one of those few who are justly
called the chosen of God.  You do the service of
eternal truth.  Your thoughts, your designs, the
marvellous studies you are engaged in, and all your
life, bear the Divine, the heavenly stamp, seeing that
they are consecrated to the rational and the beautiful
&mdash; that is, to what is eternal."
</p><p>"You said 'eternal truth.' . . .  But is eternal
truth of use to man and within his reach, if there is
no eternal life?"
</p><p>"There is eternal life," said the monk.
</p><p>"Do you believe in the immortality of man?"
</p><p>"Yes, of course.  A grand, brilliant future is in
store for you men.  And the more there are like
you on earth, the sooner will this future be realised.
Without you who serve the higher principle and live


   <pb n="127"/>

in full understanding and freedom, mankind would
be of little account; developing in a natural way, it
would have to wait a long time for the end of its
earthly history.  You will lead it some thousands
of years earlier into the kingdom of eternal truth
&mdash; and therein lies your supreme service.  You are
the incarnation of the blessing of God, which rests
upon men."
</p><p>"And what is the object of eternal life?" asked
Kovrin.

</p><p>"As of all life &mdash; enjoyment.  True enjoyment lies in knowledge,
and eternal life provides innumerable and inexhaustible sources of
knowledge, and in that sense it has been said: 'In My Father's house
there are many mansions.'"

</p><p>"If only you knew how pleasant it is to hear
you!" said Kovrin, rubbing his hands with satisfaction.

</p><p>"I am very glad."

</p><p>"But I know that when you go away I shall be worried by the
question of your reality.  You are a phantom, an hallucination.  So I am
mentally deranged, not normal?"

</p><p>"What if you are?  Why trouble yourself?  You are ill because you
have overworked and exhausted yourself, and that means that you have
sacrificed your health to the idea, and the time is near at hand when
you will give up life itself to it.  What could be better?  That is the
goal towards which all divinely endowed, noble natures strive."

</p><p>"If I know I am mentally affected, can I trust
myself?"


   <pb n="128"/>

</p><p>"And are you sure that the men of genius, whom all men trust, did
not see phantoms, too?  The learned say now that genius is allied to
madness.  My friend, healthy and normal people are only the common herd.
Reflections upon the neurasthenia of the age, nervous exhaustion and
degeneracy, et cetera, can only seriously agitate those who place the
object of life in the present &mdash; that is, the common herd."

</p><p>"The Romans used to say: <foreign lang="la"><hi rend="italic">Mens sana in
corpore sano</hi></foreign>."

</p><p>"Not everything the Greeks and the Romans said is true.
Exaltation, enthusiasm, ecstasy &mdash; all that distinguishes prophets,
poets, martyrs for the idea, from the common folk &mdash; is repellent to the
animal side of man &mdash; that is, his physical health.  I repeat, if you
want to be healthy and normal, go to the common herd."

</p><p>"Strange that you repeat what often comes into my mind," said
Kovrin.  "It is as though you had seen and overheard my secret thoughts.
But don't let us talk about me.  What do you mean by 'eternal truth'?"

</p><p>The monk did not answer.  Kovrin looked at him and could not
distinguish his face.  His features grew blurred and misty.  Then the
monk's head and arms disappeared; his body seemed merged into the seat
and the evening twilight, and he vanished altogether.

</p><p>"The hallucination is over," said Kovrin; and he
laughed.  "It's a pity."
</p><p>He went back to the house, light-hearted and


   <pb n="129"/>

happy.  The little the monk had said to him had flattered, not his
vanity, but his whole soul, his whole being.  To be one of the chosen,
to serve eternal truth, to stand in the ranks of those who could make
mankind worthy of the kingdom of God some thousands of years sooner &mdash;
that is, to free men from some thousands of years of unnecessary
struggle, sin, and suffering; to sacrifice to the idea everything &mdash;
youth, strength, health; to be ready to die for the common weal &mdash; what
an exalted, what a happy lot!  He recalled his past &mdash; pure, chaste,
laborious; he remembered what he had learned himself and what he had
taught to others, and decided that there was no exaggeration in the
monk's words.

</p><p>Tanya came to meet him in the park: she was by
now wearing a different dress.
</p><p>"Are you here?" she said.  "And we have been
looking and looking for you. . . .  But what is the
matter with you?" she asked in wonder, glancing
at his radiant, ecstatic face and eyes full of tears.
"How strange you are, Andryusha!"
</p><p>"I am pleased, Tanya," said Kovrin, laying his
hand on her shoulders.  "I am more than pleased:
I am happy.  Tanya, darling Tanya, you are an
extraordinary, nice creature.  Dear Tanya, I am so
glad, I am so glad!"

</p><p>He kissed both her hands ardently, and went on:

</p><p>"I have just passed through an exalted, wonderful, unearthly
moment.  But I can't tell you all about it or you would call me mad and
not believe me.  Let us talk of you.  Dear, delightful Tanya!  I love
you, and am used to loving you.  To have


   <pb n="130"/>

you near me, to meet you a dozen times a day, has
become a necessity of my existence; I don't know
how I shall get on without you when I go back
home."
</p><p>"Oh," laughed Tanya, "you will forget about us
in two days.  We are humble people and you are a
great man."
</p><p>"No; let us talk in earnest!" he said.  "I shall
take you with me, Tanya.  Yes?  Will you come
with me?  Will you be mine?"
</p><p>"Come," said Tanya, and tried to laugh again,
but the laugh would not come, and patches of colour
came into her face.
</p><p>She began breathing quickly and walked very
quickly, but not to the house, but further into the
park.

</p><p>"I was not thinking of it . . . I was not thinking of it," she
said, wringing her hands in despair.

</p><p>And Kovrin followed her and went on talking,
with the same radiant, enthusiastic face:

</p><p>"I want a love that will dominate me altogether;
and that love only you, Tanya, can give me.  I am
happy!  I am happy!"

</p><p>She was overwhelmed, and huddling and shrinking together, seemed
ten years older all at once, while he thought her beautiful and
expressed his rapture aloud:

</p><p>"How lovely she is!"
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d9">
<head>VI</head>

<p>Learning from Kovrin that not only a romance
had been got up, but that there would even be a


   <pb n="131"/>

wedding, Yegor Semyonitch spent a long time in
pacing from one corner of the room to the other,
trying to conceal his agitation.  His hands began
trembling, his neck swelled and turned purple, he
ordered his racing droshky and drove off somewhere.
Tanya, seeing how he lashed the horse, and seeing
how he pulled his cap over his ears, understood
what he was feeling, shut herself up in her room, and
cried the whole day.

</p><p>In the hot-houses the peaches and plums were already ripe; the
packing and sending off of these tender and fragile goods to Moscow took
a great deal of care, work, and trouble.  Owing to the fact that the
summer was very hot and dry, it was necessary to water every tree, and a
great deal of time and labour was spent on doing it.  Numbers of
caterpillars made their appearance, which, to Kovrin's disgust, the
labourers and even Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya squashed with their
fingers.  In spite of all that, they had already to book autumn orders
for fruit and trees, and to carry on a great deal of correspondence.
And at the very busiest time, when no one seemed to have a free moment,
the work of the fields carried off more than half their labourers from
the garden.  Yegor Semyonitch, sunburnt, exhausted, ill-humoured,
galloped from the fields to the garden and back again; cried that he was
being torn to pieces, and that he should put a bullet through his
brains.

</p><p>Then came the fuss and worry of the trousseau, to which the
Pesotskys attached a good deal of importance.  Every one's head was in a
whirl from the


   <pb n="132"/>

snipping of the scissors, the rattle of the sewing-machine, the smell
of hot irons, and the caprices of the dressmaker, a huffy and nervous
lady.  And, as ill-luck would have it, visitors came every day, who had
to be entertained, fed, and even put up for the night.  But all this
hard labour passed unnoticed as though in a fog.  Tanya felt that love
and happiness had taken her unawares, though she had, since she was
fourteen, for some reason been convinced that Kovrin would marry her and
no one else.  She was bewildered, could not grasp it, could not believe
herself. . . .  At one minute such joy would swoop down upon her that
she longed to fly away to the clouds and there pray to God, at another
moment she would remember that in August she would have to part from her
home and leave her father; or, goodness knows why, the idea would occur
to her that she was worthless &mdash; insignificant and unworthy of a great
man like Kovrin &mdash; and she would go to her room, lock herself in, and
cry bitterly for several hours.  When there were visitors, she would
suddenly fancy that Kovrin looked extraordinarily handsome, and that all
the women were in love with him and envying her, and her soul was filled
with pride and rapture, as though she had vanquished the whole world;
but he had only to smile politely at any young lady for her to be
trembling with jealousy, to retreat to her room &mdash; and tears again.
These new sensations mastered her completely; she helped her father
mechanically, without noticing peaches, caterpillars or labourers, or
how rapidly the time was passing.


   <pb n="133"/>

</p><p>It was almost the same with Yegor Semyonitch.  He worked from
morning till night, was always in a hurry, was irritable, and flew into
rages, but all of this was in a sort of spellbound dream.  It seemed as
though there were two men in him: one was the real Yegor Semyonitch, who
was moved to indignation, and clutched his head in despair when he heard
of some irregularity from Ivan Karlovitch the gardener; and another &mdash;
not the real one &mdash; who seemed as though he were half drunk, would
interrupt a business conversation at half a word, touch the gardener on
the shoulder, and begin muttering:

</p><p>"Say what you like, there is a great deal in blood.  His mother
was a wonderful woman, most high-minded and intelligent.  It was a
pleasure to look at her good, candid, pure face; it was like the face of
an angel.  She drew splendidly, wrote verses, spoke five foreign
languages, sang. . . .  Poor thing!  she died of consumption.  The
Kingdom of Heaven be hers."

</p><p>The unreal Yegor Semyonitch sighed, and after a
pause went on:

</p><p>"When he was a boy and growing up in my house, he had the same
angelic face, good and candid.  The way he looks and talks and moves
is as soft and elegant as his mother's.  And his intellect!  We were
always struck with his intelligence.  To be sure, it's not for nothing
he's a Master of Arts!  It's not for nothing!  And wait a bit, Ivan
Karlovitch, what will he be in ten years' time?  He will be far above
us!"

</p><p>But at this point the real Yegor Semyonitch, suddenly


   <pb n="134"/>

coming to himself, would make a terrible face, would clutch his
head and cry:

</p><p>"The devils!  They have spoilt everything!  They
have ruined everything!  They have spoilt everything!  The garden's done
for, the garden's ruined!"

</p><p>Kovrin, meanwhile, worked with the same ardour as before, and did
not notice the general commotion.  Love only added fuel to the flames.
After every talk with Tanya he went to his room, happy and triumphant,
took up his book or his manuscript with the same passion with which he
had just kissed Tanya and told her of his love.  What the black monk had
told him of the chosen of God, of eternal truth, of the brilliant future
of mankind and so on, gave peculiar and extraordinary significance to
his work, and filled his soul with pride and the consciousness of his
own exalted consequence.  Once or twice a week, in the park or in the
house, he met the black monk and had long conversations with him, but
this did not alarm him, but, on the contrary, delighted him, as he was
now firmly persuaded that such apparitions only visited the elect few
who rise up above their fellows and devote themselves to the service of
the idea.

</p><p>One day the monk appeared at dinner-time and sat in the
dining-room window.  Kovrin was delighted, and very adroitly began a
conversation with Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya of what might be of
interest to the monk; the black-robed visitor listened and nodded his
head graciously, and Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya listened, too, and
smiled gaily without


   <pb n="135"/>

suspecting that Kovrin was not talking to them
but to his hallucination.

</p><p>Imperceptibly the fast of the Assumption was ap-proaching, and
soon after came the wedding, which, at Yegor Semyonitch's urgent desire,
was celebrated with "a flourish" &mdash; that is, with senseless festivities
that lasted for two whole days and nights.  Three thousand roubles'
worth of food and drink was consumed, but the music of the wretched
hired band, the noisy toasts, the scurrying to and fro of the footmen,
the uproar and crowding, prevented them from appreciating the taste of
the expensive wines and wonderful delicacies ordered from Moscow.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="7" id="d10">
<head>VII</head>

<p>One long winter night Kovrin was lying in bed,
reading a French novel.  Poor Tanya, who had
headaches in the evenings from living in town, to
which she was not accustomed, had been asleep a
long while, and, from time to time, articulated some
incoherent phrase in her restless dreams.
</p><p>It struck three o'clock.  Kovrin put out the light
and lay down to sleep, lay for a long time with his
eyes closed, but could not get to sleep because, as
he fancied, the room was very hot and Tanya talked
in her sleep.  At half-past four he lighted the candle
again, and this time he saw the black monk sitting
in an arm-chair near the bed.
</p><p>"Good-morning," said the monk, and after a
brief pause he asked: "What are you thinking of
now?"


   <pb n="136"/>

</p><p>"Of fame," answered Kovrin.  "In the French novel I have just
been reading, there is a description of a young <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, who does
silly things and pines away through worrying about fame.  I can't
understand such anxiety."

</p><p>"Because you are wise.  Your attitude towards
fame is one of indifference, as towards a toy which
no longer interests you."
</p><p>"Yes, that is true."

</p><p>"Renown does not allure you now.  What is there flattering,
amusing, or edifying in their carving your name on a tombstone, then
time rubbing off the inscription together with the gilding?  Moreover,
happily there are too many of you for the weak memory of mankind to be
able to retain your names."

</p><p>"Of course," assented Kovrin.  "Besides, why
should they be remembered?  But let us talk of
something else.  Of happiness, for instance.  What
is happiness?'
</p><p>When the clock struck five, he was sitting on the
bed, dangling his feet to the carpet, talking to the
monk:

</p><p>"In ancient times a happy man grew at last frightened of his
happiness &mdash; it was so great! &mdash; and to propitiate the gods he brought
as a sacrifice his favourite ring.  Do you know, I, too, like
Polykrates, begin to be uneasy of my happiness.  It seems strange to me
that from morning to night I feel nothing but joy; it fills my whole
being and smothers all other feelings.  I don't know what sadness,
grief, or boredom is.  Here I am not asleep;


   <pb n="137"/>

I suffer from sleeplessness, but I am not dull.  I say
it in earnest; I begin to feel perplexed."
</p><p>"But why?" the monk asked in wonder.  "Is
joy a supernatural feeling?  Ought it not to be
the normal state of man?  The more highly a man
is developed on the intellectual and moral side, the
more independent he is, the more pleasure life gives
him.  Socrates, Diogenes, and Marcus Aurelius,
were joyful, not sorrowful.  And the Apostle tells
us: 'Rejoice continually'; 'Rejoice and be glad.'"
</p><p>"But will the gods be suddenly wrathful?"
Kovrin jested; and he laughed.  "If they take from
me comfort and make me go cold and hungry, it
won't be very much to my taste."

</p><p>Meanwhile Tanya woke up and looked with amazement and horror at
her husband.  He was talking, addressing the arm-chair, laughing and
gesticulating; his eyes were gleaming, and there was something strange
in his laugh.

</p><p>"Andryusha, whom are you talking to?" she
asked, clutching the hand he stretched out to the
monk.  "Andryusha!  Whom?"
</p><p>"Oh!  Whom?" said Kovrin in confusion.
"Why, to him. . . .  He is sitting here," he said,
pointing to the black monk.

</p><p>"There is no one here . . . no one!  Andryusha, you are ill!"

</p><p>Tanya put her arm round her husband and held him tight, as though
protecting him from the apparition, and put her hand over his eyes.

</p><p>"You are ill!" she sobbed, trembling all over.
"Forgive me, my precious, my dear one, but I have


   <pb n="138"/>

noticed for a long time that your mind is clouded in some way. . . .
You are mentally ill, Andryusha. . . ."

</p><p>Her trembling infected him, too.  He glanced
once more at the arm-chair, which was now empty,
felt a sudden weakness in his arms and legs, was
frightened, and began dressing.
</p><p>"It's nothing, Tanya; it's nothing," he muttered,
shivering.  "I really am not quite well . . . it's
time to admit that."

</p><p>"I have noticed it for a long time . . . and
father has noticed it," she said, trying to suppress
her sobs.  "You talk to yourself, smile somehow
strangely . . . and can't sleep.  Oh, my God, my
God, save us!" she said in terror.  "But don't be
frightened, Andryusha; for God's sake don't be
frightened. . . ."

</p><p>She began dressing, too.  Only now, looking at her, Kovrin
realised the danger of his position &mdash; realised the meaning of the black
monk and his conversations with him.  It was clear to him now that he
was mad.

</p><p>Neither of them knew why they dressed and went into the
dining-room: she in front and he following her.  There they found Yegor
Semyonitch standing in his dressing-gown and with a candle in his hand.
He was staying with them, and had been awakened by Tanya's sobs.

</p><p>"Don't be frightened, Andryusha," Tanya was
saying, shivering as though in a fever; "don't be
frightened. . . .  Father, it will all pass over . . .
it will all pass over. . . ."


   <pb n="139"/>

</p><p>Kovrin was too much agitated to speak.  He
wanted to say to his father-in-law in a playful tone:
"Congratulate me; it appears I have gone out of
my mind"; but he could only move his lips and smile
bitterly.
</p><p>At nine o'clock in the morning they put on his
jacket and fur coat, wrapped him up in a shawl, and
took him in a carriage to a doctor.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="8" id="d11">
<head>VIII</head>

<p>Summer had come again, and the doctor advised their going into
the country.  Kovrin had recovered; he had left off seeing the black
monk, and he had only to get up his strength.  Staying at his
father-in-law's, he drank a great deal of milk, worked for only two
hours out of the twenty-four, and neither smoked nor drank wine.

</p><p>On the evening before Elijah's Day they had an evening service in
the house.  When the deacon was handing the priest the censer the
immense old room smelt like a graveyard, and Kovrin felt bored.  He went
out into the garden.  Without noticing the gorgeous flowers, he walked
about the garden, sat down on a seat, then strolled about the park;
reaching the river, he went down and then stood lost in thought, looking
at the water.  The sullen pines with their shaggy roots, which had seen
him a year before so young, so joyful and confident, were not whispering
now, but standing mute and motionless, as though they did not recognise
him.  And, indeed, his head was closely cropped, his beautiful long hair


   <pb n="140"/>

was gone, his step was lagging, his face was fuller
and paler than last summer.
</p><p>He crossed by the footbridge to the other side.
Where the year before there had been rye the oats
stood, reaped, and lay in rows.  The sun had set
and there was a broad stretch of glowing red on the
horizon, a sign of windy weather next day.  It was
still.  Looking in the direction from which the year
before the black monk had first appeared, Kovrin
stood for twenty minutes, till the evening glow had
begun to fade. . . .
</p><p>When, listless and dissatisfied, he returned home
the service was over.  Yegor Semyonitch and Tanya
were sitting on the steps of the verandah, drinking
tea.  They were talking of something, but, seeing
Kovrin, ceased at once, and he concluded from their
faces that their talk had been about him.
</p><p>"I believe it is time for you to have your milk,"
Tanya said to her husband.
</p><p>"No, it is not time yet . . ." he said, sitting
down on the bottom step.  "Drink it yourself; I
don't want it."
</p><p>Tanya exchanged a troubled glance with her
father, and said in a guilty voice:
</p><p>"You notice yourself that milk does you good."
</p><p>"Yes, a great deal of good!" Kovrin laughed.
"I congratulate you: I have gained a pound in
weight since Friday."  He pressed his head tightly
in his hands and said miserably: "Why, why have
you cured me?  Preparations of bromide, idleness,
hot baths, supervision, cowardly consternation at
every mouthful, at every step &mdash; all this will reduce


   <pb n="141"/>

me at last to idiocy.  I went out of my mind, I had
megalomania; but then I was cheerful, confident, and
even happy; I was interesting and original.  Now I
have become more sensible and stolid, but I am just
like every one else: I am &mdash; mediocrity; I am weary
of life. . . .  Oh, how cruelly you have treated me!
. . .  I saw hallucinations, but what harm did that
do to any one?  I ask, what harm did that do any
one?"
</p><p>"Goodness knows what you are saying!" sighed
Yegor Semyonitch.  "It's positively wearisome to
listen to it."
</p><p>"Then don't listen."

</p><p>The presence of other people, especially Yegor Semyonitch,
irritated Kovrin now; he answered him drily, coldly, and even rudely,
never looked at him but with irony and hatred, while Yegor Semyonitch
was overcome with confusion and cleared his throat guiltily, though he
was not conscious of any fault in himself.  At a loss to understand why
their charming and affectionate relations had changed so abruptly, Tanya
huddled up to her father and looked anxiously in his face; she wanted to
understand and could not understand, and all that was clear to her was
that their relations were growing worse and worse every day, that of
late her father had begun to look much older, and her husband had grown
irritable, capricious, quarrelsome and uninteresting.  She could not
laugh or sing; at dinner she ate nothing; did not sleep for nights
together, expecting something awful, and was so worn out that on one
occasion she lay in a dead faint from dinner-time


   <pb n="142"/>

till evening.  During the service she thought her
father was crying, and now while the three of them
were sitting together on the terrace she made an
effort not to think of it.

</p><p>"How fortunate Buddha, Mahomed, and Shakespeare were that their
kind relations and doctors did not cure them of their ecstasy and their
inspiration," said Kovrin.  "If Mahomed had taken bromide for his
nerves, had worked only two hours out of the twenty-four, and had drunk
milk, that remarkable man would have left no more trace after him than
his dog.  Doctors and kind relations will succeed in stupefying mankind,
in making mediocrity pass for genius and in bringing civilisation to
ruin.  If only you knew," Kovrin said with annoyance, "how grateful I am
to you."

</p><p>He felt intense irritation, and to avoid saying too much, he got
up quickly and went into the house.  It was still, and the fragrance of
the tobacco plant and the marvel of Peru floated in at the open window.
The moonlight lay in green patches on the floor and on the piano in the
big dark dining-room.  Kovrin remembered the raptures of the previous
summer when there had been the same scent of the marvel of Peru and the
moon had shone in at the window.  To bring back the mood of last year he
went quickly to his study, lighted a strong cigar, and told the footman
to bring him some wine.  But the cigar left a bitter and disgusting
taste in his mouth, and the wine had not the same flavour as it had the
year before.  And so great is the effect of giving up a habit, the cigar
and the two gulps of wine made


   <pb n="143"/>

him giddy, and brought on palpitations of the heart,
so that he was obliged to take bromide.
</p><p>Before going to bed, Tanya said to him:
</p><p>"Father adores you.  You are cross with him
about something, and it is killing him.  Look at him;
he is ageing, not from day to day, but from hour to
hour.  I entreat you, Andryusha, for God's sake,
for the sake of your dead father, for the sake of my
peace of mind, be affectionate to him."
</p><p>"I can't, I don't want to."
</p><p>"But why?" asked Tanya, beginning to tremble
all over.  "Explain why."
</p><p>"Because he is antipathetic to me, that's all," said
Kovrin carelessly; and he shrugged his shoulders.
"But we won't talk about him: he is your father."

</p><p>"I can't understand, I can't," said Tanya, pressing her hands to
her temples and staring at a fixed point.  "Something incomprehensible,
awful, is going on in the house.  You have changed, grown unlike
yourself. . . .  You, clever, extraordinary man as you are, are
irritated over trifles, meddle in paltry nonsense. . . .  Such trivial
things excite you, that sometimes one is simply amazed and can't believe
that it is you.  Come, come, don't be angry, don't be angry," she went
on, kissing his hands, frightened of her own words.  "You are clever,
kind, noble.  You will be just to father.  He is so good."

</p><p>"He is not good; he is just good-natured.  Burlesque old uncles
like your father, with well-fed, good-natured faces, extraordinarily
hospitable and queer, at one time used to touch me and amuse me


   <pb n="144"/>

in novels and in farces and in life; now I dislike
them.  They are egoists to the marrow of their
bones.  What disgusts me most of all is their being
so well-fed, and that purely bovine, purely hoggish
optimism of a full stomach."
</p><p>Tanya sat down on the bed and laid her head on
the pillow.
</p><p>"This is torture," she said, and from her voice it
was evident that she was utterly exhausted, and that
it was hard for her to speak.  "Not one moment
of peace since the winter. . . .  Why, it's awful!
My God!  I am wretched."
</p><p>"Oh, of course, I am Herod, and you and your
father are the innocents.  Of course."

</p><p>His face seemed to Tanya ugly and unpleasant.  Hatred and an
ironical expression did not suit him.  And, indeed, she had noticed
before that there was something lacking in his face, as though ever
since his hair had been cut his face had changed, too.  She wanted to
say something wounding to him, but immediately she caught herself in
this antagonistic feeling, she was frightened and went out of the
bedroom.
</p>
</div2>
<div2 type="section" n="9" id="d12">
<head>IX</head>

<p>Kovrin received a professorship at the University.  The inaugural
address was fixed for the second of December, and a notice to that
effect was hung up in the corridor at the University.  But on the day
appointed he informed the students' inspector, by telegram, that he was
prevented by illness from giving the lecture.


   <pb n="145"/>

</p><p>He had h&aelig;morrhage from the throat.  He was often spitting
blood, but it happened two or three times a month that there was a
considerable loss of blood, and then he grew extremely weak and sank
into a drowsy condition.  This illness did not particularly frighten
him, as he knew that his mother had lived for ten years or longer
suffering from the same disease, and the doctors assured him that there
was no danger, and had only advised him to avoid excitement, to lead a
regular life, and to speak as little as possible.

</p><p>In January again his lecture did not take place
owing to the same reason, and in February it was
too late to begin the course.  It had to be postponed
to the following year.

</p><p>By now he was living not with Tanya, but with another woman, who
was two years older than he was, and who looked after him as though he
were a baby.  He was in a calm and tranquil state of mind; he readily
gave in to her, and when Varvara Niko-laevna &mdash; that was the name of
his friend &mdash; decided to take him to the Crimea, he agreed, though he
had a presentiment that no good would come of the trip.

</p><p>They reached Sevastopol in the evening and stopped at an hotel to
rest and go on the next day to Yalta.  They were both exhausted by the
journey.  Varvara Nikolaevna had some tea, went to bed and was soon
asleep.  But Kovrin did not go to bed.  An hour before starting for the
station, he had received a letter from Tanya, and had not brought
himself to open it, and now it was lying in his coat pocket, and the
thought of it excited him disagreeably.


   <pb n="146"/>

At the bottom of his heart he genuinely considered now that his
marriage to Tanya had been a mistake.  He was glad that their separation
was final, and the thought of that woman who in the end had turned into
a living relic, still walking about though everything seemed dead in her
except her big, staring, intelligent eyes &mdash; the thought of her roused
in him nothing but pity and disgust with himself.  The handwriting on
the envelope reminded him how cruel and unjust he had been two years
before, how he had worked off his anger at his spiritual emptiness, his
boredom, his loneliness, and his dissatisfaction with life by revenging
himself on people in no way to blame.  He remembered, also, how he had
torn up his dissertation and all the articles he had written during his
illness, and how he had thrown them out of window, and the bits of paper
had fluttered in the wind and caught on the trees and flowers.  In every
line of them he saw strange, utterly groundless pretension, shallow
defiance, arrogance, megalomania; and they made him feel as though he
were reading a description of his vices.  But when the last manuscript
had been torn up and sent flying out of window, he felt, for some
reason, suddenly bitter and angry; he went to his wife and said a great
many unpleasant things to her.  My God, how he had tormented her!  One
day, wanting to cause her pain, he told her that her father had played a
very unattractive part in their romance, that he had asked him to marry
her.  Yegor Semyonitch accidentally overheard this, ran into the


   <pb n="147"/>

room, and, in his despair, could not utter a word,
could only stamp and make a strange, bellowing
sound as though he had lost the power of speech,
and Tanya, looking at her father, had uttered a
heart-rending shriek and had fallen into a swoon.
It was hideous.
</p><p>All this came back into his memory as he looked
at the familiar writing.  Kovrin went out on to the
balcony; it was still warm weather and there was a
smell of the sea.  The wonderful bay reflected the
moonshine and the lights, and was of a colour for
which it was difficult to find a name.  It was a soft
and tender blending of dark blue and green; in places
the water was like blue vitriol, and in places it seemed
as though the moonlight were liquefied and filling
the bay instead of water.  And what harmony of
colours, what an atmosphere of peace, calm, and
sublimity!
</p><p>In the lower storey under the balcony the win-dows were probably open, for women's voices and
laughter could be heard distinctly.  Apparently
there was an evening party.
</p><p>Kovrin made an effort, tore open the envelope,
and, going back into his room, read:
</p><p>"My father is just dead.  I owe that to you, for
you have killed him.  Our garden is being ruined;
strangers are managing it already &mdash; that is, the very
thing is happening that poor father dreaded.  That,
too, I owe to you.  I hate you with my whole soul,
and I hope you may soon perish.  Oh, how wretched
I am!  Insufferable anguish is burning my soul. . . .


   <pb n="148"/>

My curses on you.  I took you for an extraordinary
man, a genius; I loved you, and you have turned out
a madman. . . ."

</p><p>Kovrin could read no more, he tore up the letter and threw it
away.  He was overcome by an uneasiness that was akin to terror.
Varvara Nikolaevna was asleep behind the screen, and he could hear her
breathing.  From the lower storey came the sounds of laughter and
women's voices, but he felt as though in the whole hotel there were no
living soul but him.  Because Tanya, unhappy, broken by sorrow, had
cursed him in her letter and hoped for his perdition, he felt eerie and
kept glancing hurriedly at the door, as though he were afraid that the
uncomprehended force which two years before had wrought such havoc in
his life and in the life of those near him might come into the room and
master him once more.

</p><p>He knew by experience that when his nerves were out of hand the
best thing for him to do was to work.  He must sit down to the table and
force himself, at all costs, to concentrate his mind on some one
thought.  He took from his red portfolio a manuscript containing a
sketch of a small work of the nature of a compilation, which he had
planned in case he should find it dull in the Crimea without work.  He
sat down to the table and began working at this plan, and it seemed to
him that his calm, peaceful, indifferent mood was coming back.  The
manuscript with the sketch even led him to meditation on the vanity of
the world.  He thought how much life exacts for the worthless or very
commonplace


   <pb n="149"/>

blessings it can give a man.  For instance, to gain, before forty, a
university chair, to be an ordinary professor, to expound ordinary and
second-hand thoughts in dull, heavy, insipid language &mdash; in fact, to
gain the position of a mediocre learned man, he, Kovrin, had had to
study for fifteen years, to work day and night, to endure a terrible
mental illness, to experience an unhappy marriage, and to do a great
number of stupid and unjust things which it would have been pleasant not
to remember.  Kovrin recognised clearly, now, that he was a mediocrity,
and readily resigned himself to it, as he considered that every man
ought to be satisfied with what he is.

</p><p>The plan of the volume would have soothed him completely, but the
torn letter showed white on the floor and prevented him from
concentrating his attention.  He got up from the table, picked up the
pieces of the letter and threw them out of window, but there was a light
wind blowing from the sea, and the bits of paper were scattered on the
windowsill.  Again he was overcome by uneasiness akin to terror, and he
felt as though in the whole hotel there were no living soul but himself.
. . .  He went out on the balcony.  The bay, like a living thing, looked
at him with its multitude of light blue, dark blue, turquoise and fiery
eyes, and seemed beckoning to him.  And it really was hot and
oppressive, and it would not have been amiss to have a bathe.

</p><p>Suddenly in the lower storey under the balcony a
violin began playing, and two soft feminine voices
began singing.  It was something familiar.  The
song was about a maiden, full of sick fancies, who


   <pb n="150"/>

heard one night in her garden mysterious sounds, so strange and lovely
that she was obliged to recognise them as a holy harmony which is
unintelligible to us mortals, and so flies back to heaven. . . .  Kovrin
caught his breath and there was a pang of sadness at his heart, and a
thrill of the sweet, exquisite delight he had so long forgotten began to
stir in his breast.

</p><p>A tall black column, like a whirlwind or a waterspout, appeared
on the further side of the bay.  It moved with fearful rapidity across
the bay, towards the hotel, growing smaller and darker as it came, and
Kovrin only just had time to get out of the way to let it pass. . . .
The monk with bare grey head, black eyebrows, barefoot, his arms crossed
over his breast, floated by him, and stood still in the middle of the
room.

</p><p>"Why did you not believe me?" he asked reproachfully, looking
affectionately at Kovrin.  "If you had believed me then, that you were a
genius, you would not have spent these two years so gloomily and so
wretchedly."

</p><p>Kovrin already believed that he was one of God's chosen and a
genius; he vividly recalled his conversations with the monk in the past
and tried to speak, but the blood flowed from his throat on to his
breast, and not knowing what he was doing, he passed his hands over his
breast, and his cuffs were soaked with blood.  He tried to call Varvara
Nikolaevna, who was asleep behind the screen; he made an effort and
said:

</p><p>"Tanya!"


   <pb n="151"/>

</p><p>He fell on the floor, and propping himself on his
arms, called again:
</p><p>"Tanya!"
</p><p>He called Tanya, called to the great garden with
the gorgeous flowers sprinkled with dew, called to
the park, the pines with their shaggy roots, the rye-field, his marvellous learning, his youth, courage, joy
&mdash; called to life, which was so lovely.  He saw on
the floor near his face a great pool of blood, and
was too weak to utter a word, but an unspeakable,
infinite happiness flooded his whole being.  Below,
under the balcony, they were playing the serenade,
and the black monk whispered to him that he was a
genius, and that he was dying only because his frail
human body had lost its balance and could no longer
serve as the mortal garb of genius.
</p><p>When Varvara Nikolaevna woke up and came
out from behind the screen, Kovrin was dead, and a
blissful smile was set upon his face.
