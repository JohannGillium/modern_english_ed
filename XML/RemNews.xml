<p>LESS than two weeks ago I passed over the trail from 
Rushville, Nebraska, to the Pine Ridge Agency behind Major-General 
Nelson A. Miles.  To-night the moon is shining as it did then, but 
it will go down in the middle of the night, and I can see in my 
mind's eye the Second Infantry and the Ninth Troopers, with their 
trains of wagons, plodding along in the dark.  The distance is 
twenty-eight miles, and at four o'clock in the morning they will 
arrive.  When the Ogallalas view the pine-clad bluffs they will see 
in the immediate foreground a large number of Sibley tents, and, 
being warriors, they will know that each Sibley has eighteen men in 
it.  They will be much surprised.  They will hold little impromptu 
councils, and will probably seek for the motive of this 
concentration of troops.  And some man will say: "Well, the 
soldiers are here, and if your people don't keep quiet&mdash;  Well, you 
know what soldiers are for."  The Ogallalas will understand why the 
soldiers are there without any further explanation.  There may be 
and probably will be some white friend of the Indians who can tell 
them something they do not know.  A little thing has happened since 
the Ogallalas laid their arms down, and that is that the bluecoats 
in the Second Infantry can put a bullet into the anatomy of an 
Ogallala at one thousand yards' range with almost absolute 
certainty if the light is fair and the wind not too strong. 
</p><p>I must not try to prophesy what the Ogallalas will do when 
they see the Sibleys, but I hope the friend will be there to tell 
them what a regular soldier and a Long Tom can do.  The days when 
they could circle like hawks about a rabbit are gone.  The modern 
United States soldier can pile a pony up in a heap before its rider 
can go one hundred yards.  I realize that before this matter is 
printed the biggest Indian war since 1758 will be in progress, or 
that the display of military force will have accomplished its 
object, and the trouble gone. 
</p><p>The thing that is most remarkable about this concentration of 
troops is that the white people of the country read it in the 
evening papers, and with the first rays of to-morrow's sun the 
Ogallalas, the Cheyennes, and the Sitting Bull people will see it 
with their own eyes.  Why did not the white people know it before?  
It must have occupied the military authorities for some days.  The 
reason is this: not until late years could the Indians read 
English, but now the school-boys and squaw men can, and I have 
picked up copies of the New York and Chicago papers on the counters 
of an Indian trader's store, where a room was full of Indians, 
three or four of whom could probably read as well as most men.  The 
cause of the secrecy is at once apparent.  If an Omaha paper had 
printed a despatch saying that General Miles was suddenly to 
concentrate troops at Pine Ridge Agency in three days' time, that 
paper would be on the counter in a trader's store inside of a day 
and a half, and the Ogallalas, in all probability, would be 
scampering over the plains on the way to meet the northern 
Cheyennes and join issue with Uncle Sam's troops.  Now they awake 
some fine morning and see the Sibleys, and if a turbulent 
disposition is displayed, the ringleaders are arrested, and the 
thing stopped.  Hundreds of settlers' lives will be saved, 
thousands of dollars' worth of horses and cattle are left 
untouched, and the general government escapes the expenses of a war 
which would run into the millions.  Meanwhile you and I read our 
papers, and find we are reading news which is fresh, only it might 
have been printed three days before. 
</p><p>In these days a military officer has to conduct his operations 
as secretly in Indian war as he would in a civilized case, all of 
which is very different from the days when expeditions were fitting 
out for months, and every man knew of it.  The Interior Department, 
a few old medicine men, and the most desperate of the old war 
chiefs must divide the blame for the whole business.
