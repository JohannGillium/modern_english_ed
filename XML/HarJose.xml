<p>SCULPTURE labors under the disadvantage of having in most
cases to carry out a subject or make a likeness at the bidding of
some one else besides the artist himself.  In painting there is
more chance for an independent choice of topic, though the painted
portrait is usually undertaken under the same hampering bonds.
Luckily Mr. Olin I. Warner, while travelling in the West, happened
to be on the Cherokee Reservation when Chief Joseph, the famous
leader of the Nez Perces, was expected at army head-quarters.  He
waited until the old chief arrived, and used such arguments that in
the course of several sittings he obtained the bass-relief
medallion which is here to be seen [illustration omitted].  It was
shown at the National Academy last spring, but hardly received the
place and the attention it deserved.  The portrait is a true labor
of love on the part of the sculptor, and while it gives one of the
many types of our North-American Indians, is said to be an
excellent likeness of the warrior.
</p><p>The remnant of the Nez Perces to which Joseph belongs are now
on a portion of the Cherokee Reservation, purchased in 1878 from
the Cherokees.  It is a square containing about 91,000 acres, lying
across the Salt Fork of the Arkansas River, just above that which
was bought for the Poncas.  They have the Poncas on the east, and
the Otoes and Missourias on the southeast.  Kansas lies well to the
north, and one crosses the big Osage Reservation when approaching
it from the eastward.  After their capitulation to General Miles in
1877, the remnant of the tribe, numbering 431 souls, were taken to
Fort Leavenworth, where the location of their camp was so unhealthy
that they lost many by disease.  They were removed to their
reservation on the Salt Fork in 1879, whence it has been proposed
to move them again, in pursuance of the hand-to-hand policy which
has affected Cherokees, Osages, and other larger nations in their
gradual removal to the West before the swarming settlers.  It was
probably because of business relating to the further removal of the
Indians that Chief Joseph came within range of our sculptor, and
found himself immortalized in clay.  Though he had ridden hard for
many days to reach head-quarters, the old chief was fresh and
alert.  But, curiously enough, he found that sitting for his
portrait was quite a different task from sitting a horse.  Mr.
Warner says that it wearied Chief Joseph exceedingly, far more than
it does white men who are much less vigorous.
</p><p>The Nez Perces belonged in what is now the State of Idaho, and
the greater part of the tribe remained on reservations in that
Territory.  A few years ago several thousands were flourishing in
the northern part of the Territory, having farms, schools, and
churches.  Other accounts make them out as debased by drink and the
vices of white adventurers.  A minority of the Nez Perces never
agreed to the cession of their lands, and occupied the army for
some months at various times in making them submit.  The name given
the Nez Perces by the French <hi rend="italic">coureurs de bois</hi> is singularly
inappropriate, as they do not mutilate their noses, and seem never
to have done so as a tribe, whatever may have been the fashion in
some branch of their kindred.  The Sahaptins, for example, who have
given the name to a congeries of tribes including the Nez Perces,
are said to have bored the nose in order to carry a nose ornament
like the Hindoo women and some tribes of Brazil.
</p><p>Chief Joseph calls himself Hin-mah-too-yah-lat-kekht, and the
tribe is said to use Numepo as their preferred title, though
nomenclature among Indians is a parlous thing, many names at the
same time and different names at different epochs being the fashion
with them individually and in the mass.  He is a very high type of
Indian as regards brains and courage, but he possesses many of the
peculiarities of the savage.  His eyes are dull and his features
stolid as a rule, but if a bird passes, an animal makes a sound in
the bush, an insect comes within earshot or eyesight, something
happens in that vacant look.  Things that we do not regard have
hidden meanings to him, either in connection with the weather, or
by reason of superstitions which link certain results with certain
appearances, or because the sight of one animal or insect has to do
with the presence or the absence of another.  The sculptor says
that only when some beast, bird, or insect was in sight did the old
chief look the warrior and the Indian.  When that was gone he
relapsed into the apparently unthinking state of an animal, and
showed very plainly that to remain in one position while the clay
was modelling itself under the artist's fingers was a penance
greater than to wait immovable for hours until game revealed itself
or an enemy crept in sight.
</p><p>Chief Joseph belongs to the light-colored Indians.  As most
people are aware, the native races vary in tint from a brown that
approaches the blackness of a negro to a light coffee-color not so
dark as many Europeans.  The Quichuas of Peru are very black, and
the Heidahs of Queen Charlotte and Blackfeet of the Saskatchewan
are fair.  The Pammas of Brazil are lighter than many Spaniards and
Portuguese, while the Iroquois and Algonquin tribes are coppery or
light brown.  But what is often overlooked is the apparent
unimportance of climate on the color of the Indians under the
arctic circle or at the equator.  Were it not for the broad plaits
of hair and absence of beard, giving to Chief Joseph that curious
resemblance, in our eyes, to an old woman which we see in so many
Indians, the face might be that of a European.  As heavy lips, as
bent a nose, as high a cheek-bone, may be seen in any crowd of
white men.  The forehead is good, and the brain cavity ample.  In
sailors and woodsmen we find the same close-lipped, somewhat
saturnine expression.
</p><p>On the artistic side one may note how Mr. Warner has felt the
building up of the cranium and jaw, and how strongly yet subtly he
has modelled the texture of the face.  From the inscription the
marks of quotation might well be spared at the words Joseph and Nez
Perce, while the word Indians itself might be criticised as
redundant.
</p><p>Chief Joseph, as we all know, had a claim to the Wallowa
Valley in Oregon, dating from the Stevens treaty in 1855, and
conceded again to him and his tribe of about 500 Indians in 1873 by
General Grant, while the latter was President.  Two years later the
concession of June 16, 1873, was revoked, and the Wallowa Valley
was thrown into the public domain along with all of Oregon west of
the Snake River.  In 1877 it was determined to remove the Nez
Perces from Oregon to the reservation in Idaho, and General Howard
reported that they had agreed to go, not willingly, but under
constraint.  Some whites were killed, and Chief White Bird sent
word that he would not remove, whereupon an unequal war began
between retreating bands of Nez Perces and companies of United
States cavalry, aided by volunteers.  The Indians crossed the
Yellowstone Park and River, endeavoring to escape into British
territory, but were followed closely by Howard, and headed off by
General, then Colonel Miles.  In the battle that ensued near the
mouth of Eagle Creek 6 chiefs and 25 warriors were killed, and 38
men wounded.  Two officers and 21 men were killed and 4 officers
and 38 men wounded on the side of the pursuers.  The whole camp of
about 450 men, women, and children fell into Colonel Miles's hands.
General Howard reached the battle-field just in time to be present
at the surrender.
</p><p>Chief Joseph conducted this retreat with very extraordinary
skill.  He beat Colonel Gibbon with 15 officers, 146 troopers, and
34 volunteers, though with much loss of men.  He stampeded General
Howard's horses and pack-train, fought Colonel Sturgis on the
Yellowstone River, losing many horses, and came very near making
good his retreat to British America.  Of this campaign General
Sherman has said: "The Indians throughout displayed a courage and
skill that elicited universal praise; they abstained from scalping;
let captive women go free; did not commit indiscriminate murder of
peaceful families, which is usual; and fought with almost
scientific skill, using advance and rear guards, skirmish lines,
and field fortifications."  These facts only make harder the fate
that awaited them, for it shows that no forbearance, no bravery and
generalship, are able to win for Indians justice.  The right of the
Nez Perces to the Wallowa Valley was perfect, and the killing of
four white men possibly but not certainly by Indians was made the
pretext of hunting them down and letting them die of disease at
Fort Leavenworth.  By neglecting to provide means to prevent
tyranny and land-grabbing on the part of its white citizens our
government is constantly forced to violate the most solemn
treaties, and confess itself unworthy of trust.  The weakness and
injustice of our dealing with Indians was never shown in a more
picturesque and striking example than in our conduct toward this
little section of the Nez Perces.  It is only fair to say, however,
that we have had recent examples in which the government realized
that the nation has a duty to perform in protecting Indians against
encroachments by white settlers, and the troops were used in a more
honorable exploit than hunting down men with whom the nation had
broken a solemn compact.
