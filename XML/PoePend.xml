<p>I was sick &mdash; sick unto death with that long agony; and when 
they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that 
my senses were leaving me.  The sentence &mdash; the dread sentence of 
death &mdash; was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. 
After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in 
one dreamy indeterminate hum.  It conveyed to my soul the idea of 
<hi rend="italic">revolution</hi> &mdash; perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr 
of a mill-wheel.  This only for a brief period; for presently I 
heard no more.  Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an 
exaggeration!  I saw the lips of the black-robed judges.  They 
appeared to me white &mdash; whiter than the sheet upon which I trace 
these words &mdash; and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the 
intensity of their expression 
<pb n="746"/>  
of firmness &mdash; of immoveable 
resolution &mdash; of stern contempt of human torture.  I saw that the 
decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. 
I saw them writhe with a deadly locution.  I saw them fashion the 
syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. 
I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and 
nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped 
the walls of the apartment.  And then my vision fell upon the seven 
tall candles upon the table.  At first they wore the aspect of 
charity, and seemed white slender angels who would save me; but 
then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, 
and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the 
wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became 
meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them 
there would be no help.  And there stole into my fancy, like a rich 
musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the 
grave.  The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long 
before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at 
length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges 
vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank 
into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of 
darkness supervened; all sensation appeared swallowed up in that 
mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades.  Then silence, and 
stillness, and night were the universe. 
</p><p>I had swooned; but will not say that all of consciousness was 
lost.  What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or 
even to describe; yet all was not lost.  In the deepest slumber &mdash; 
no!  In delirium &mdash; no!  In a swoon &mdash; no!  In death &mdash; no! even in the 
grave all <hi rend="italic">is not</hi> lost.  Else there is no immortality for man. 
Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer 
web of <hi rend="italic">some</hi> dream.  Yet in a second afterwards, (so frail may 
that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed.  In the 
return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of 
the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of 
physical, existence.  It seems probable that if, upon reaching the 
second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we 
should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf 
beyond.  And that gulf is &mdash; what?  How at least shall we distinguish 
its shadows from those of the tomb?  But if the impressions of what 
I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, 
after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel 
whence they come?  He who has never swooned is not he who finds 
strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is 
not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the 
many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some 
novel flower &mdash; is not he whose brain grows bewildered with 
<pb n="747"/>  
the intense meaning of some musical cadence which has never before 
arrested his attention. 
</p><p>Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid 
earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming 
nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments 
when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief 
periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason 
of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that 
condition of what men term unconsciousness.  These shadows of 
memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me 
in silence down &mdash; down &mdash; still down &mdash; till a hideous dizziness 
oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the 
descent.  They tell also of a vague horror at my heart on account 
of that heart's unnatural stillness.  Then comes a sense of sudden 
motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a 
ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the 
limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil.  After 
this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is <hi rend="italic"> 
madness</hi> &mdash; the madness of a memory which busies itself among 
forbidden things. 
</p><p>Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound &mdash; the 
tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its 
beating.  Then a pause in which all is blank.  Then again sound, 
and motion, and touch &mdash; a tingling sensation pervading my frame. 
Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought &mdash; a 
condition which lasted long.  Then, very suddenly, <hi rend="italic">thought</hi>, and 
shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to realize my true state. 
Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility.  Then a rushing 
revival of soul and a successful effort to move.  And now a full 
memory of the trial, of the judges, of the tall candles, of the 
sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. 
Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later 
day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to 
recall. 
</p><p>So far, I had not opened my eyes.  I felt that I lay upon my 
back, unbound.  I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon 
something damp and hard.  There I suffered it to remain for many 
minutes, while I strove to imagine where and <hi rend="italic">what</hi> I could be. 
I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision.  I dreaded the first 
glance at objects around.  It was not that I feared to look upon 
things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be <hi rend="italic"> 
nothing</hi> to see.  At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I 
quickly unclosed my eyes.  My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. 
The blackness of the eternal night encompassed me.  I gasped for 
breath.  The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle 
me.  The atmosphere was intolerably close.  I still lay quietly, 
and made effort to exercise my reason.  I 
<pb n="748"/>  
brought to mind 
the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to 
deduce my real condition.  The sentence had passed; and it appeared 
to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed.  Yet not 
for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead.  Such a 
supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether 
inconsistent with real existence; &mdash; but where and in what state was 
I?  The condemned to death, I knew perished usually at the <hi rend="italic"> 
autos-da-fe</hi>, and one of these had been held on the very night of 
the day of my trial.  Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await 
the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? 
This I at once saw could not be.  Victims had been in immediate 
demand.  Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells 
at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded. 
</p><p>A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon 
my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into 
insensibility.  Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, 
trembling convulsively in every fibre.  I thrust my arms wildly 
above and around me in all directions.  I felt nothing; yet dreaded 
to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of <hi rend="italic">a 
tomb</hi>.  Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big 
beads upon my forehead.  The agony of suspense grew, at length, 
intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, 
and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching 
some faint ray of light.  I proceeded for many paces; but still all 
was blackness and vacancy.  I breathed more freely.  It seemed 
evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates. 
</p><p>And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there 
came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the 
horrors at Toledo.  Of the dungeons there had been strange things 
narrated &mdash; fables I had always deemed them &mdash; but yet strange, and too 
ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper.  Was I left to perish of 
starvation in this subterrene world of darkness; or what fate, 
perhaps even more fearful, awaited me?  That the result would be 
death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too 
well the character of my judges to doubt.  The mode and the hour 
were all that occupied or distracted me. 
</p><p>My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid 
obstruction.  It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry &mdash; very 
smooth, slimy, and cold.  I followed it up; stepping with all the 
careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired 
me.  This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining 
the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and 
return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the 
fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall.  I therefore sought the 
knife which had been in 
<pb n="749"/>  
my pocket, when led into the 
inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been 
exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge.  I had thought of forcing 
the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify 
my point of departure.  The difficulty, nevertheless, was but 
trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first 
insuperable.  I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the 
fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall.  In 
groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter 
this rag upon completing the circuit.  So, at least, I thought: but 
I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own 
weakness.  The ground was moist and slippery.  I staggered onwards 
for perhaps a half hour, when I stumbled and fell.  My excessive 
fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me 
as I lay. 
</p><p>Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me 
a loaf and a pitcher with water.  I was too much exhausted to 
reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. 
Shortly afterwards, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with 
much toil, came at last upon the fragment of serge.  Up to the 
period when I fell, I had counted fifty-two paces, and, upon 
resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight paces &mdash; when I arrived 
at the rag.  There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, 
admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty 
yards in circuit.  I had met, however, with many angles in the 
wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for 
vault I could not help supposing it to be. 
</p><p>I had little object &mdash; certainly no hope &mdash; in these researches; 
but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them.  Quitting the 
wall, I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure.  At first, I 
proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly 
of solid material, was treacherous with slime.  At length, however, 
I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly &mdash; endeavoring to 
cross in as direct a line as possible.  I had advanced some ten or 
twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my 
robe became entangled between my legs.  I stepped on it, and fell 
violently on my face. 
</p><p>In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately 
apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few 
seconds afterwards, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my 
attention.  It was this: my chin rested upon the floor of the 
prison, but my lips, and the upper portion of my head, although 
seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing.  At 
the same time, my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the 
peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils.  I put 
forward my arm and 
<pb n="750"/>  
shuddered to find that I had fallen at 
the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no 
means of ascertaining at the moment.  Groping about the masonry 
just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, 
and let it fall into the abyss.  For nearly a minute I hearkened to 
its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in 
its descent: at length, there was a sullen plunge into water, 
succeeded by loud echoes.  At the same moment, there came a sound 
resembling the quick opening, and as rapid closing of a door 
overhead, while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the 
gloom, and as suddenly faded away. 
</p><p>I now saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and 
congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had 
escaped.  A step farther before my fall, and the world had seen me 
no more.  And the death just avoided was of that very character 
which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales 
respecting the Inquisition.  To the victims of tyranny, there was 
the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with 
its most hideous moral horrors.  I had been reserved for the 
latter.  By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I 
trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every 
respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited 
me. 
</p><p>Shaking in every limb, I groped my way back to the wall &mdash; 
resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the 
wells, of which my imagination now pictured many in various 
positions about the dungeon.  In other conditions of mind, I might 
have had courage to end my misery at once, by a plunge into one of 
these abysses; but now I was the veriest of cowards.  Neither could 
I forget what I had read of these pits &mdash; that the <hi rend="italic">sudden</hi> 
extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan. 
</p><p>Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at 
length I again slumbered.  Upon arousing, I found by my side, as 
before, a loaf and a pitcher of water.  A burning thirst consumed 
me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught.  It must have been 
drugged &mdash; for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly 
drowsy.  A deep sleep fell upon me &mdash; a sleep like that of death. 
How long it lasted I, of course, know not; but when, once again, I 
unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible.  By a wild, 
sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first 
determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the 
prison. 
</p><p>In its size I had been greatly mistaken.  The whole circuit of 
its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards.  For some minutes this 
fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed &mdash; for what 
could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which 
environed me, than the mere dimension of my dungeon?  But my soul 
<pb n="751"/>  
took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in 
endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my 
measurement.  The truth at length flashed upon me.  In my first 
attempt at exploration, I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the 
period when I fell: I must then have been within a pace or two of 
the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit 
of the vault.  I then slept &mdash; and, upon awaking, I must have 
returned upon my steps &mdash; thus supposing the circuit nearly double 
what it actually was.  My confusion of mind prevented me from 
observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended 
it with the wall to the right. 
</p><p>I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the 
enclosure.  In feeling my way, I had found many angles, and thus 
deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of 
total darkness upon our arousing from lethargy or sleep!  The 
angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at 
odd intervals.  The general shape of the prison was square.  What 
I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, 
in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depressions. 
The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in 
all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel 
superstition of the monks has given rise.  The figures of fiends in 
aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really 
fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls.  I observed 
that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently 
distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from 
the effects of a damp atmosphere.  I now noticed the floor, too, 
which was of stone.  In the centre yawned the circular pit from 
whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon. 
</p><p>All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort &mdash; for my 
personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber.  I now 
lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework 
of wood.  To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling 
a surcingle.  It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and 
body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such 
extent, that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with 
food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor.  I 
saw, to my horror, that the pitcher was absent: to my horror &mdash; for 
I was consumed with intolerable thirst.  This thirst it appeared to 
be the design of my persecutors to stimulate &mdash; for the food in the 
dish was meat pungently seasoned. 
</p><p>Looking upwards I surveyed the ceiling of my prison.  It was 
some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the 
side walls.  In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my 
whole attention.  It was the painted figure of Time as he is 
commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, 
at a casual glance, 
<pb n="752"/>  
I supposed to be the pictured 
image of a huge pendulum, such as we see on antique clocks.  There was 
something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused 
me to regard it more attentively.  While I gazed directly upward at 
it, (for its position was immediately over my own,) I fancied that 
I saw it in motion.  In an instant afterwards the fancy was 
confirmed.  Its sweep was brief, and of course slow.  I watched it 
for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder.  Wearied at 
length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the 
other objects in the cell. 
</p><p>A slight noise attracted my notice, and, looking to the floor, 
I saw several enormous rats traversing it.  They had issued from 
the well, which lay just within view to my right.  Even then, while 
I gazed, they came up in troops, hurriedly, with ravenous eyes, 
allured by the scent of the meat.  From this it required much 
effort and attention to scare them away. 
</p><p>It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I 
could take but imperfect note of time,) before I again cast my eyes 
upward.  What I then saw confounded and amazed me.  The sweep of 
the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard.  As a 
natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater.  But what 
mainly disturbed me was the idea that it had perceptibly <hi rend="italic"> 
descended</hi>.  I now observed &mdash; with what horror it is needless to 
say &mdash; that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of 
glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the 
horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a 
razor.  Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from 
the edge into a solid and broad structure above.  It was appended 
to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole <hi rend="italic">hissed</hi> as it swung 
through the air. 
</p><p>I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish 
ingenuity in torture.  My cognizance of the pit had become known to 
the inquisitorial agents &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">pit</hi>, whose horrors had been 
destined for so bold a recusant as myself &mdash; <hi rend="italic">the pit</hi>, typical of 
hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their 
punishments.  The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest 
of accidents.  I knew that surprise, or <hi rend="italic">entrapment</hi> into 
torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of 
these dungeon deaths.  Having failed to fall, it was no part of the 
demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no 
alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. 
Milder!  I half smiled in my agony as I thought of such application 
of such a term. 
</p><p>What boots it to tell of the long, long hours of horror more 
than mortal, during which I counted the rushing vibrations of the 
steel!  Inch by inch &mdash; line by line &mdash; with a descent only appreciable 
at intervals that seemed ages &mdash; down and still down it came!  Days 
passed 
<pb n="753"/>  
&mdash; it might have been that many days passed &mdash; 
ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath.  The 
odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils.  I prayed &mdash; 
I wearied heaven with prayer for its more speedy descent.  I grew 
frantically mad, and struggled to force myself upwards against the 
sweep of the fearful scimitar.  And then I fell suddenly calm, and 
lay smiling at the glittering death, as a child at some rare 
bauble. 
</p><p>There was an interval of utter insensibility; it was brief; 
for, upon again lapsing into life, there had been no perceptible 
descent in the pendulum.  But it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have been long &mdash; for I 
knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could 
have arrested the vibration at pleasure.  Upon my recovery, too, I 
felt very &mdash; oh, inexpressibly &mdash; sick and weak, as if through long 
inanition.  Even amid all the agonies of that period, the human 
nature <hi rend="italic">craved food</hi>.  With painful effort I outstretched my left 
arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small 
remnant which had been spared me by the rats.  As I put a portion 
of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half-formed thought 
of joy &mdash; of hope.  Yet what business had <hi rend="italic">I</hi> with hope?  It was, 
as I say, a half-formed thought &mdash; man has many such, which are never 
completed.  I felt that it was of joy &mdash; of hope; but I felt also 
that it had perished in its formation.  In vain I struggled to 
realize &mdash; to regain it.  Long suffering had nearly annihilated all 
my ordinary powers of mind.  I was an imbecile &mdash; an idiot. 
</p><p>The vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my 
length.  I saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region 
of the heart.  It would fray the serge of my robe &mdash; it would return 
and repeat its operation &mdash; again &mdash; and again.  Notwithstanding its 
terrifically wide sweep, (some thirty feet or more,) and the 
hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls 
of iron, still the fraying of the serge of my robe would be all 
that, for several minutes, it would accomplish.  And at this 
thought I paused.  I dared not go farther than this reflection.  I 
dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention &mdash; as if, in so 
dwelling, I could arrest <hi rend="italic">here</hi> the descent of the steel.  I 
forced myself to ponder upon the <hi rend="italic">sound</hi> of the crescent as it 
should pass across the garment &mdash; upon the peculiar thrilling 
sensation which the friction of cloth produces in the nerves.  I 
pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge. 
</p><p>Down &mdash; steadily down it <hi rend="italic">crept</hi>.  I took a frenzied pleasure 
in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity.  To the 
right &mdash; to the left &mdash; far and wide &mdash; with the shriek and the plunge of 
a damned spirit! to my heart, with the stealthy pace of the tiger. 
I alternately laughed and howled, as the one or the other idea grew 
predominant. 
</p><p>Down &mdash; certainly, relentlessly down!  It vibrated within three 
inches 
<pb n="754"/>  
of my bosom!  I struggled violently &mdash; furiously 
&mdash; to free my left arm.  This was free only from the elbow to the hand. 
I could reach the latter, from the platter beside me, to my mouth, 
with great effort, but no farther.  Could I have broken the 
fastenings above the elbow, I would have seized and attempted to 
arrest the pendulum.  I might as well have attempted to arrest an 
avalanche! 
</p><p>Down &mdash; still unceasingly &mdash; still inevitably down!  I gasped and 
struggled at each vibration.  I shrunk convulsively at its every 
sweep.  My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the 
eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves 
spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a 
relief, oh, how unspeakable!  I still quivered in every nerve to 
think how slight a sinking or slipping of the machinery would 
precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom.  It was hope 
that prompted the nerve to quiver &mdash; the frame to shrink.  It was 
hope &mdash; the hope that triumphs on the rack &mdash; that whispers to the 
death-condemned even in the dungeons of the Inquisition. 
</p><p>I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel 
in actual contact with my robe &mdash; and with this observation there 
suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of <hi rend="italic"> 
despair</hi>.  For the first time during many hours &mdash; or perhaps days &mdash; I 
<hi rend="italic">thought</hi>.  It now at once occurred to me, that the bandage, or 
surcingle, which enveloped me, was <hi rend="italic">unique</hi>.  I was tied by no 
separate cords.  The first stroke of the razor-like crescent 
athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might 
be unwound from my person by means of my left hand.  But how 
fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel!  The result of 
the slightest struggle, how deadly!  Was it likely, moreover, that 
the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this 
possibility?  Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom <hi rend="italic"> 
in the track</hi> of the pendulum?  Dreading to find my faint, and, as 
it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to 
obtain a distinct view of my breast.  The surcingle enveloped my 
limbs and body close in all directions &mdash; <hi rend="italic">save in the path of the 
destroying crescent</hi>. 
</p><p>Scarcely had I dropped my head back in its original position, 
when there flashed upon my mind what I cannot better describe than 
as the <hi rend="italic">unformed half</hi> of that idea of deliverance to which I 
have previously alluded, and of which a moiety only floated 
indeterminately through my brain when I raised <hi rend="italic">food</hi> to my 
burning lips.  The whole thought was now present &mdash; feeble, scarcely 
sane, scarcely definite &mdash; but still entire.  I proceeded at once, 
with the nervous energy of despair, to attempt its execution. 
</p><p>For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework 
upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats.  They were 
<pb n="755"/>  
wild, bold, ravenous &mdash; their red eyes glaring upon me 
as if they waited but for motionless on my part to make me their prey. 
"To what food," I thought, "have they been accustomed in the well?" 
</p><p>They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, 
all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish.  I had fallen 
into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter; 
and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived 
it of effect.  In their voracity, the vermin frequently fastened 
their sharp fangs in my fingers.  With the particles of the oily 
and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage 
wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I 
lay breathlessly still. 
</p><p>At first, the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at 
the change &mdash; at the cessation of movement.  They shrank alarmedly 
back; many sought the well.  But this was only for a moment.  I had 
not counted in vain upon their voracity.  Observing that I remained 
without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the 
framework, and smelt at the surcingle.  This seemed the signal for 
a general rush.  Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. 
They clung to the wood &mdash; they overran it, and leapt in hundreds upon 
my person.  The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them 
not at all.  Avoiding its strokes, they busied themselves with the 
anointed bandage.  They pressed &mdash; they swarmed upon me in ever 
accumulating heaps.  They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips 
sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; a 
disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and 
chilled, with a deadly clamminess, my heart.  Yet one minute, and 
I felt that the struggle would be over.  Plainly I perceived the 
loosening of the bandage.  I knew that in more than one place it 
must be already severed.  With a more than human resolution I lay 
<hi rend="italic">still</hi>. 
</p><p>Nor had I erred in my calculations &mdash; nor had I endured in vain. 
I at length felt that I was <hi rend="italic">free</hi>.  The surcingle hung in 
ribands from my body.  But the stroke of the pendulum already 
pressed upon my bosom.  It had divided the serge of the robe.  It 
had cut through the linen beneath.  Twice again it swung, and a 
sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.  But the moment of 
escape had arrived.  At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried 
tumultuously away.  With a steady movement &mdash; cautious, sidelong, 
shrinking, and slow &mdash; I slid from the embrace of the bandage and 
beyond the sweep of the scimitar.  For the moment, at least, <hi rend="italic">I 
was free</hi>. 
</p><p>Free! &mdash; and in the grasp of the Inquisition!  I had scarcely 
stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the 
prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased, and I beheld 
it 
<pb n="756"/>  
drawn up, by some invisible force, through the 
ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart.  My every 
motion was undoubtedly watched.  Free! &mdash; I had but escaped death in 
one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some 
other.  With that thought I rolled my eyes nervously around on the 
barriers of iron that hemmed me in.  Something unusual &mdash; some change 
which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly &mdash; it was obvious, 
had taken place in the apartment.  For many minutes of a dreamy and 
trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected 
conjecture.  During this period, I became aware, for the first 
time, of the origin of the sulphureous light which illuminated the 
cell.  It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, 
extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, 
which thus appeared, and were completely separated from the floor. 
I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture. 
</p><p>As I rose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in 
the chamber broke at once upon my understanding.  I have observed 
that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were 
sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and 
indefinite.  These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily 
assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the 
spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have 
thrilled ever firmer nerves than my own.  Demon eyes, of a wild and 
ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where 
none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of 
a fire that I could not force my diseased imagination to regard as 
unreal. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Unreal</hi>! &mdash; Even while I gazed there came to my nostrils the 
breath of the vapor of heated iron!  A suffocating odor pervaded 
the prison!  A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that 
glared at my agonies!  A richer tint of crimson diffused itself 
over the pictured horrors of blood.  I panted!  I gasped for 
breath!  There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors &mdash; 
oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men!  I shrank from the 
glowing metal to the centre of the cell.  Amid the thought of the 
fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the 
well came over my soul like balm.  I rushed to its deadly brink. 
I threw my straining vision below.  The glare from the enkindled 
roof illumined its inmost recesses.  Yet, for a wild moment, did my 
spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw.  At length 
it forced &mdash; it wrestled its way into my soul &mdash; it burned itself in 
upon my shuddering reason.  Oh! for a voice to speak &mdash; oh! horror! &mdash; 
oh! any horror but this!  With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, 
and buried my face in my hands &mdash; weeping bitterly. 
</p><p>The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, 
shuddering as with a fit of the ague.  There had been a second 
change in the 
<pb n="757"/>  
cell &mdash; and now the change was obviously in 
the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>.  As before, it was in vain that I at first endeavored to 
appreciate or understand what was taking place.  But not long was 
I left in doubt.  The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by 
my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the 
King of Terrors.  The room had been square.  I saw that two of its 
iron angles were now acute &mdash; two, consequently, obtuse.  The fearful 
difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. 
In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a 
lozenge.  But the alteration stopped not here &mdash; I neither hoped nor 
desired it to stop.  I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom 
as a garment of eternal peace.  "Death," I said, "any death but 
that of the pit!"  Fool! might I have not known that <hi rend="italic">into the 
pit</hi> it was the object of the burning iron to urge me?  Could I 
resist its glow? or if even that, could I withstand its pressure? 
And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that 
left me no time for contemplation.  Its centre, and of course, its 
greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf.  I shrank back &mdash; 
but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onwards.  At length 
for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of 
foothold on the firm floor of the prison.  I struggled no more, but 
the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream 
of despair.  I felt that I tottered upon the brink &mdash; I averted my 
eyes &mdash; 
</p><p>There was a loud blast as of many trumpets!  There was a 
discordant hum of human voices!  There was a harsh grating as of a 
thousand thunders!  The fiery walls rushed back!  An outstretched 
arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss.  It was that 
of General Lasalle.  The Inquisition was in the hands of its 
enemies.  The French army had entered Toledo.
