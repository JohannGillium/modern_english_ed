<p>  "BUT Guy's heart slept under the violets on Muriel's 
grave."</p><p> 
     It was a beautiful ending; Theodora had seen girls cry over 
last chapters that weren't half as pathetic.  She laid her pen 
aside and read the words over, letting her voice linger on the 
fall 
of the sentence; then, drawing a deep breath, she wrote across 
the 
foot of the page the name by which she had decided to become 
known 
in literature&mdash;Gladys Glyn.</p><p> 
     Down-stairs the library clock struck two.  Its muffled thump 
sounded like an admonitory knock against her bedroom floor.  Two 
o'clock! and she had promised her mother to be up early enough to 
see that the buttons were sewn on Johnny's reefer, and that Kate 
had her cod-liver oil before starting for school!</p><p> 
     Lingeringly, tenderly she gathered up the pages of her 
novel,&mdash;there were five hundred of them,&mdash;and tied them with the 
blue satin ribbon that her Aunt Julia had given her.  She had 
meant 
to wear the ribbon with her new dotted muslin on Sundays, but 
this 
was putting it to a nobler use.  She bound it round her 
manuscript, 
tying the ends in a pretty bow.  Theodora was clever at making 
bows, and could have trimmed hats beautifully, had not all her 
spare moments been given to literature.  Then, with a last look 
at 
the precious pages, she sealed and addressed the package.  She 
meant to send it off next morning to the <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi>.  
She knew 
it would be hard to obtain access to a paper which numbered so 
many 
popular authors among its contributors, but she had been 
encouraged 
to make the venture by something her Uncle James had said the 
last 
time he had come down from Boston.</p><p> 
     He had been telling his brother, Doctor Dace, about his new 
house out at Brookline.  Uncle James was prosperous, and was 
always 
moving into new houses with more "modern improvements."  Hygiene 
was his passion, and he migrated in the wake of sanitary 
plumbing.</p><p> 
     "The bath-rooms alone are worth the money," he was saying, 
cheerfully, "although it <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> a big rent.  But then, when a 
man's 
got no children to save up for&mdash;" he glanced compassionately 
round 
Doctor Dace's crowded table&mdash;"and it <hi rend="italic"> is</hi> something to be 
in a 
neighborhood where the drainage is A 1.  That's what I was 
telling 
our neighbor.  Who do you suppose she is, by the way?"  He smiled 
at Theodora.  "I rather think that young lady knows all about 
her.  
Ever hear of Kathleen Kyd?"</p><p> 
     Kathleen Kyd!  The famous "society novelist," the creator of 
more "favorite heroines" than all her predecessors put together 
had 
ever turned out; the author of "Fashion and Passion," "An 
American 
Duchess," "Rhona's Revolt."  Was there any intelligent girl from 
Maine to California whose heart would not have beat faster at the 
mention of that name?</p><p> 
     "Why, yes," Uncle James was saying, "Kathleen Kyd lives next 
door.  Frances G. Wollop is her real name, and her husband's a 
dentist.  She's a very pleasant, sociable kind of woman; you'd 
never think she was a writer.  Ever hear how she began to write?  
She told me the whole story.  It seems she was saleswoman in a 
store, working on starvation wages, with a mother and a 
consumptive 
sister to support.  Well, she wrote a story one day, just for 
fun, 
and sent it to the <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi>.  They'd never heard of 
her, of 
course, and she never expected to hear from them.  She did, 
though.  
They took the story and passed their plate for more.  She became 
a 
regular contributor and eventually was known all over the 
country.  
Now she tells me her books bring her in about ten thousand a 
year.  
Rather more than you and I can boast of, eh, John?  Well, I hope 
<hi rend="italic"> 
this</hi> household doesn't contribute to her support."  He 
glanced 
sharply at Theodora.  "I don't believe in feeding youngsters on 
sentimental trash; it's like sewer-gas&mdash;doesn't smell bad, and 
infects the system without your knowing it."</p><p> 
     Theodora listened breathlessly.  Kathleen Kyd's first story 
had been accepted by the <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi>, and they had asked 
for 
more!  Why should Gladys Glyn be less fortunate?  Theodora had 
done 
a great deal of novel-reading,&mdash;far more than her parents were 
aware of,&mdash;and felt herself competent to pronounce upon the 
quality 
of her own work.  She was almost sure that "April Showers" was a 
remarkable book.  If it lacked Kathleen Kyd's lightness of touch, 
it had an emotional intensity never achieved by that brilliant 
writer.  Theodora did not care to amuse her readers; she left 
that 
to more frivolous talents.  Her aim was to stir the depths of 
human 
nature, and she felt she had succeeded.  It was a great thing for 
a girl to be able to feel that about her first novel.  Theodora 
was 
only seventeen; and she remembered, with a touch of retrospective 
compassion, that George Eliot had not become famous till she was 
nearly forty.</p><p> 
     No, there was no doubt about the merit of "April Showers."  
But would not an inferior work have had a better chance of 
success?  
Theodora recalled the early struggles of famous authors, the 
notorious antagonism of publishers and editors to any new writer 
of 
exceptional promise.  Would it not be wiser to write the book 
down 
to the average reader's level, reserving for some later work the 
great "effects" into which she had thrown all the fervor of her 
imagination?  The thought was sacrilege!  Never would she lay 
hands 
on the sacred structure she had reared; never would she resort to 
the inartistic expedient of modifying her work to suit the 
popular 
taste.  Better obscure failure than a vulgar triumph.  The great 
authors never stooped to such concessions, and Theodora felt 
herself included in their ranks by the firmness with which she 
rejected all thought of conciliating an unappreciative public.  
The 
manuscript should be sent as it was.</p><p> 
     She woke with a start and a heavy sense of apprehension.  
The 
<hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi> had refused "April Showers!"  No, that 
couldn't be 
it; there lay the precious manuscript, waiting to be posted.  
What 
was it, then?  Ah, that ominous thump below stairs&mdash;nine o'clock 
striking!  It was Johnny's buttons!</p><p> 
     She sprang out of bed in dismay.  She had been so determined 
not to disappoint her mother about Johnny's buttons!  Mrs. Dace, 
helpless from chronic rheumatism, had to entrust the care of the 
household to her eldest daughter; and Theodora honestly meant to 
see that Johnny had his full complement of buttons, and that Kate 
and Bertha went to school tidy.  Unfortunately, the writing of a 
great novel leaves little time or memory for the lesser 
obligations 
of life, and Theodora usually found that her good intentions 
matured too late for practical results.</p><p> 
     Her contrition was softened by the thought that literary 
success would enable her to make up for all the little 
negligences 
of which she was guilty.  She meant to spend all her money on her 
family; and already she had visions of a wheeled chair for her 
mother, a fresh wallpaper for the doctor's shabby office, 
bicycles 
for the girls, and Johnny's establishment at a boarding-school 
where sewing on his buttons would be included in the curriculum.  
If her parents could have guessed her intentions, they would not 
have found fault with her as they did: and Doctor Dace, on this 
particular morning, would not have looked up to say, with his 
fagged, ironical air:</p><p> 
     "I suppose you didn't get home from the ball till 
morning."</p><p> 
     Theodora's sense of being in the right enabled her to take 
the 
thrust with a dignity that would have awed the unfeeling parent 
of 
fiction.</p><p> 
     "I'm sorry to be late, father," she said.</p><p> 
     Doctor Dace, who could never be counted on to behave like a 
father in a book, shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p><p> 
     "Your sentiments do you credit, but they haven't kept your 
mother's breakfast warm."</p><p> 
     "Hasn't mother's tray gone up yet?"</p><p> 
     "Who was to take it, I should like to know?  The girls came 
down so late that I had to hustle them off before they'd finished 
breakfast, and Johnny's hands were so dirty that I sent him back 
to 
his room to make himself decent.  It's a pretty thing for the 
doctor's children to be the dirtiest little savages in 
Norton!"</p><p> 
     Theodora had hastily prepared her mother's tray, leaving her 
own breakfast untouched.  As she entered the room up-stairs, Mrs. 
Dace's patient face turned to her with a smile much harder to 
bear 
than her father's reproaches.</p><p> 
     "Mother, I'm <hi rend="italic"> so</hi> sorry&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "No matter, dear.  I suppose Johnny's buttons kept you.  I 
can't think what that boy does to his clothes!"</p><p> 
     Theodora set the tray down without speaking.  It was 
impossible to own to having forgotten Johnny's buttons without 
revealing the cause of her forgetfulness.  For a few weeks longer 
she must bear to be misunderstood; then&mdash;ah, then if her novel 
were 
accepted, how gladly would she forget and forgive!  But what if 
it 
were refused?  She turned aside to hide the dismay that flushed 
her 
face.  Well, then she would admit the truth&mdash;she would ask her 
parents' pardon, and settle down without a murmur to an obscure 
existence of mending and combing.</p><p> 
     She had said to herself that after the manuscript had been 
sent, she would have time to look after the children and catch up 
with the mending; but she had reckoned without the postman.  He 
came three times a day; and for an hour before each ring she was 
too excited to do anything but wonder if he would bring an answer 
this time, and for an hour afterward she moved about in a leaden 
stupor of disappointment.  The children had never been so trying. 
 
They seemed to be always coming to pieces, like cheap furniture; 
<pb n="26"/>  one would have supposed they had been put 
together with bad 
glue.  Mrs. Dace worried herself ill over Johnny's tatters, 
Bertha's bad marks at school, and Kate's open abstention from 
cod-liver oil; and Doctor Dace, coming back late from a long round of 
visits to a fireless office with a smoky lamp, called out 
furiously 
to know if Theodora would kindly come down and remove the "East, 
West, home's best" that hung above the empty grate.</p><p> 
     In the midst of it all, Miss Sophy Brill called.  It was 
very 
kind of her to come, for she was the busiest woman in Norton.  
She 
made it her duty to look after other people's affairs, and there 
was not a house in town but had the benefit of her personal 
supervision.  She generally came when things were going wrong, 
and 
the sight of her bonnet on the door-step was a surer sign of 
calamity than a crape bow on the bell.  After she left, Mrs. Dace 
looked very sad, and the doctor punished Johnny for warbling down 
the entry: 
</p><p> 
                    "Miss Sophy Brill</p><p> 
                     Is a bitter pill!" 
 
while Theodora, locking herself in her room, resolved with tears 
that she would never write another novel.</p><p> 
     The week was a long nightmare.  Theodora could neither eat 
nor 
sleep.  She was up early enough, but instead of looking after the 
children and seeing that breakfast was ready, she wandered down 
the 
road to meet the postman, and came back wan and empty-handed, 
oblivious of her morning duties.  She had no idea how long the 
suspense would last; but she didn't see how authors could live if 
they were kept waiting more than a week.</p><p> 
     Then suddenly, one afternoon&mdash;she never quite knew how or 
when 
it happened&mdash;she found herself with a <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi> 
envelope in 
her hands, and her dazzled eyes flashing over a wild dance of 
words 
that wouldn't settle down and make sense.</p><p> 
     "Dear Madam:"  [They called her <hi rend="italic"> Madam!</hi>  And then; 
yes, the 
words were beginning to fall into line now.]  "Your novel, 'April 
Showers,' has been received, and we are glad to accept it on the 
usual terms.  A serial on which we were counting for immediate 
publication has been delayed by the author's illness, and the 
first 
chapters of 'April Showers' will therefore appear in our 
midsummer 
number.  Thanking you for favoring us with your manuscript, we 
remain," and so forth.</p><p> 
     Theodora found herself in the wood beyond the schoolhouse.  
She was kneeling on the ground, brushing aside the dead leaves 
and 
pressing her lips to the little bursting green things that pushed 
up eager tips through last year's decay.  It was spring&mdash;spring!  
Everything was crowding toward the light, and in her own heart 
hundreds of germinating hopes had burst into sudden leaf.  She 
wondered if the thrust of those little green fingers hurt the 
surface of the earth as her springing raptures hurt&mdash;yes, 
actually 
hurt!&mdash;her hot, constricted breast!  She looked up through 
interlacing boughs at a tender, opaque blue sky full of the 
coming 
of a milky moon.  She seemed enveloped in an atmosphere of loving 
comprehension.  The brown earth throbbed with her joy, the tree-tops trembled with it, and a sudden star broke through the 
branches 
like an audible "I know!"</p><p> 
     Theodora, on the whole, behaved very well.  Her mother 
cried, 
her father whistled and said he supposed he must put up with 
grounds in his coffee now, and be thankful if he ever got a hot 
meal again; while the children took the most deafening and 
harassing advantage of what seemed a sudden suspension of the 
laws 
of nature.</p><p> 
     Within a week everybody in Norton knew that Theodora had 
written a novel, and that it was coming out in the <hi rend="italic"> Home 
Circle</hi>.  
On Sundays, when she walked up the aisle, her friends dropped 
their 
prayer-books and the soprano sang false in her excitement.  Girls 
with more pin-money than Theodora had ever dreamed of copied her 
hats and imitated her way of speaking.  The local paper asked her 
for a poem; her old school-teachers stopped to shake hands and 
grew 
shy over their congratulations; and Miss Sophy Brill came to 
call.  
She had put on her Sunday bonnet, and her manner was almost 
abject.  
She ventured, very timidly, to ask her young friend how she 
wrote, 
whether it "just came to her," and if she had found that the kind 
of pen she used made any difference; and wound up by begging 
Theodora to write a sentiment in her album.</p><p> 
     Even Uncle James came down from Boston to talk the wonder 
over.  He called Theodora a "sly baggage," and proposed that she 
should give him her earnings to invest in a new patent 
grease-trap 
company.  From what Kathleen Kyd had told him, he thought 
Theodora 
would probably get a thousand dollars for her story.  He 
concluded 
by suggesting that she should base her next romance on the 
subject 
of sanitation, making the heroine nearly die of sewer-gas 
poisoning 
because her parents won't listen to the handsome young doctor 
next 
door, when he warns them that their plumbing is out of order.  
That 
was a subject that would interest everybody, and do a lot more 
good 
than the sentimental trash most women wrote.</p><p> 
     At last the great day came.  Theodora had left an order with 
the bookseller for the midsummer number of the <hi rend="italic"> Home 
Circle</hi>, and 
before the shop was open she was waiting on the sidewalk.  She 
clutched the precious paper and ran home without opening it.  Her 
excitement was almost more than she could bear.  Not heeding her 
father's call to breakfast, she rushed up-stairs and locked 
herself 
in her room.  Her hands trembled so that she could hardly turn 
the 
pages.  At last&mdash;yes, there it was: "April Showers."</p><p> 
     The paper dropped from her hands.  What name had she read 
beneath the title?  Had her emotion blinded her?</p><p> 
     "April Showers, by <hi rend="italic"> Kathleen Kyd</hi>."</p><p> 
     Kathleen Kyd!  Oh, cruel misprint!  Oh, dastardly 
typographer!  
Through tears of rage and disappointment Theodora looked again: 
yes, there was no mistaking the hateful name.  Her glance ran on. 
 
She found herself reading a first paragraph that she had never 
seen 
before.  She read farther.  All was strange.  The horrible truth 
burst upon her: <hi rend="italic"> It was not her story!</hi> 
</p><p> 
                             &mdash; 
</p><p> 
     She never knew how she got back to the station.  She 
struggled 
through the crowd on the platform, and a gold-banded arm pushed 
her 
into the train just starting for Norton.  It would be dark when 
she 
reached home; but that didn't matter&mdash;nothing mattered now.  She 
sank into her seat, closing her eyes in the vain attempt to shut 
out the vision of the last few hours; but minute by minute memory 
forced her to relive it; she felt like a rebellious school child 
dragged forth to repeat the same detested "piece."</p><p> 
     Although she did not know Boston well, she had made her way 
easily enough to the <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi> building; at least, she 
supposed she had, since she remembered nothing till she found 
herself ascending the editorial stairs as easily as one does 
incredible things in dreams.  She must have walked very fast, for 
her heart was beating furiously, and she had barely breath to 
whisper the editor's name to a young man who looked out at her 
from 
a glass case, like a zoological specimen.  The young man led her 
past other glass cases containing similar specimens to an inner 
enclosure which seemed filled by an enormous presence.  Theodora 
felt herself enveloped in the presence, submerged by it, gasping 
for air as she sank under its rising surges.</p><p> 
     Gradually fragments of speech floated to the surface.  
"'April 
Showers?'  Mrs. Kyd's new serial?  <hi rend="italic"> Your</hi> manuscript, you 
say?  
You have a letter from me?  The name, please?  Evidently some 
unfortunate misunderstanding.  One moment."  And then a bell 
ringing, a zoological specimen ordered to unlock a safe, her name 
asked for again, the manuscript, her own precious manuscript, 
tied 
with Aunt Julia's ribbon, laid on the table before her, and her 
outcries, her protests, her interrogations, drowned in a flood of 
bland apology: "An unfortunate accident&mdash;Mrs. Kyd's manuscript 
received the same day&mdash;extraordinary coincidence in the choice of 
a title&mdash;duplicate answers sent by mistake&mdash;Miss Dace's novel 
hardly suited to their purpose&mdash;should of course have been 
returned&mdash;regrettable oversight&mdash;accidents would happen&mdash;sure she 
understood."</p><p> 
     The voice went on, like the steady pressure of a surgeon's 
hand on a shrieking nerve.  When it stopped she was in the 
street.  
A cab nearly ran her down, and a car-bell jangled furiously in 
her 
ears.  She clutched her manuscript, carrying it tenderly through 
the crowd, like a live thing that had been hurt.  She could not 
bear to look at its soiled edges and the ink-stain on Aunt 
Julia's 
ribbon.</p><p> 
     The train stopped with a jerk, and she opened her eyes.  It 
was dark, and by the windy flare of gas on the platform she saw 
the 
Norton passengers getting out.  She stood up stiffly and followed 
them.  A warm wind blew into her face the fragrance of the summer 
woods, and she remembered how, two months earlier, she had knelt 
among the dead leaves, pressing her lips to the first shoots of 
green.  Then for the first time she thought of home.  She had 
fled 
away in the morning without a word, and her heart sank at the 
thought of her mother's fears.  And her father&mdash;how angry he 
would 
be!  She bent her head under the coming storm of his 
derision.</p><p> 
     The night was cloudy, and as she stepped into the darkness 
beyond the station a hand was slipped in hers.  She stood still, 
too weary to feel frightened, and a voice said, quietly:</p><p> 
     "Don't walk so fast, child.  You look tired."</p><p> 
     "Father!"  Her hand dropped from his, but he recaptured it 
and 
drew it through his arm.  When she found voice, it was to 
whisper, 
"You were at the station?"</p><p> 
     "It's such a good night I thought I'd stroll down and meet 
you."</p><p> 
     Her arm trembled against his.  She could not see his face in 
the dimness, but the light of his cigar looked down on her like a 
friendly eye, and she took courage to falter out: "Then you 
knew&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "That you'd gone to Boston?  Well, I rather thought you 
had."</p><p> 
     They walked on slowly, and presently he added, "You see, you 
left the <hi rend="italic"> Home Circle</hi> lying in your room."</p><p> 
     How she blessed the darkness and the muffled sky!  She could 
not have borne the scrutiny of the tiniest star.</p><p> 
     "Then mother wasn't very much frightened?"</p><p> 
     "Why, no, she didn't appear to be.  She's been busy all day 
over some toggery of Bertha's."</p><p> 
     Theodora choked.  "Father, I'll&mdash;"  She groped for words, 
but 
they eluded her.  "I'll do things&mdash;differently; I haven't 
meant&mdash;"  
Suddenly she heard herself bursting out: "It was all a mistake, 
you 
know&mdash;about my story.  They didn't want it; they won't have it!" 
and she shrank back involuntarily from his impending 
mirth.</p><p> 
     She felt the pressure of his arm, but he didn't speak, and 
she 
figured his mute hilarity.  They moved on in silence.  Presently 
he 
said:</p><p> 
     "It hurts a bit just at first, doesn't it?"</p><p> 
     "O father!"</p><p> 
     He stood still, and the gleam of his cigar showed a face of 
unexpected participation.</p><p> 
     "You see I've been through it myself."</p><p> 
     "You, father?  You?"</p><p> 
     "Why, yes.  Didn't I ever tell you?  I wrote a novel once.  
I 
was just out of college, and I didn't want to be a doctor.  No; I 
wanted to be a genius.  So I wrote a novel."</p><p> 
     The doctor paused, and Theodora clung to him in a mute 
passion 
of commiseration.  It was as if a drowning creature caught a live 
hand through the murderous fury of the waves.</p><p> 
     "Father&mdash;O father!"</p><p> 
     "It took me a year&mdash;a whole year's hard work; and when I'd 
finished it the publishers wouldn't have it, either; not at any 
price.  And that's why I came down to meet you, because I 
remembered my walk home."
