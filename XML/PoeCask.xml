<head>The Cask of Amontillado</head> 
<pb n="1090"/>   
<p>The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could; 
but when he ventured upon insult, I vowed revenge.  You, who 
so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that 
I gave utterance to a threat.  AT LENGTH I would be avenged; this was a 
point definitively settled &mdash; but the very definitiveness with which it 
was resolved precluded the idea of risk.  I must not only punish, but 
punish with impunity.  A wrong is unredressed when retribution 
overtakes its redresser.  It is equally unredressed when the avenger 
fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. 
</p><p>It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given 
Fortunato cause to doubt my good will.  I continued, as was my 
wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile NOW 
was at the thought of his immolation. 
</p><p>He had a weak point &mdash; this Fortunato &mdash; although in other regards 
he was a man to be respected and even feared.  He prided himself 
upon his connoisseurship in wine.  Few Italians have the true virtuoso 
spirit.  For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the 
time and opportunity &mdash; to practise imposture upon the British and 
<pb n="1091"/>  
Austrian MILLIONAIRES.  In painting and gemmary Fortunato, like his 
countrymen, was a quack &mdash; but in the matter of old wines he was 
sincere.  In this respect I did not differ from him materially; I was 
skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I 
could. 
</p><p>It was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of 
the carnival season, that I encountered my friend.  He accosted me 
with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much.  The man 
wore motley.  He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his 
head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells.  I was so pleased 
to see him that I thought I should never have done wringing his 
hand. 
</p><p>I said to him &mdash; "My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met.  How 
remarkably well you are looking to-day.  But I have received a pipe 
of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts." 
</p><p>"How?" said he.  "Amontillado?  A pipe?  Impossible!  And in the 
middle of the carnival!" 
</p><p>"I have my doubts," I replied; "and I was silly enough to pay the 
full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter.  You 
were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain." 
</p><p>"Amontillado!" 
</p><p>"I have my doubts." 
</p><p>"Amontillado!" 
</p><p>"And I must satisfy them." 
</p><p>"Amontillado!" 
</p><p>"As you are engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi.  If any one has 
a critical turn, it is he.  He will tell me &mdash; " 
</p><p>"Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry." 
</p><p>"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your 
own." 
</p><p>"Come, let us go." 
</p><p>"Whither?" 
</p><p>"To your vaults." 
</p><p>"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good nature.  I 
perceive you have an engagement.  Luchresi &mdash; " 
</p><p>"I have no engagement; &mdash; come." 
</p><p>"My friend, no.  It is not the engagement, but the severe cold with 
which I perceive you are afflicted.  The vaults are insufferably damp. 
They are encrusted with nitre." 
</p><p>"Let us go, nevertheless.  The cold is merely nothing.  Amontillado! 
You have been imposed upon.  And as for Luchresi, he cannot 
distinguish Sherry from Amontillado." 
</p><p>Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting 
<pb n="1092"/>  
on a mask of black silk, and drawing a ROQUELAIRE closely about 
my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo. 
</p><p>There were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make 
merry in honor of the time.  I had told them that I should not return 
until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir 
from the house.  These orders were sufficient, I well knew, to insure 
their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was 
turned. 
</p><p>I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to 
Fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway 
that led into the vaults.  I passed down a long and winding staircase, 
requesting him to be cautious as he followed.  We came at length to 
the foot of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of 
the catacombs of the Montresors. 
</p><p>The gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap 
jingled as he strode. 
</p><p>"The pipe," said he. 
</p><p>"It is farther on," said I; "but observe the white web-work which 
gleams from these cavern walls." 
</p><p>He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy 
orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication. 
</p><p>"Nitre?" he asked, at length. 
</p><p>"Nitre," I replied.  "How long have you had that cough?" 
</p><p>"Ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash; ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash; ugh! ugh! ugh! &mdash; ugh! ugh! 
ugh! &mdash; ugh! ugh! ugh!" 
</p><p>My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes.  "It 
is nothing," he said, at last. 
</p><p>"Come," I said, with decision, "we will go back; your health is 
precious.  You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, 
as once I was.  You are a man to be missed.  For me it is no matter.  We 
will go back; you will be ill, and I cannot be responsible.  Besides, 
there is Luchresi &mdash; " 
</p><p>"Enough," he said; "the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill 
me.  I shall not die of a cough." 
</p><p>"True &mdash; true," I replied; "and, indeed, I had no intention of 
alarming you unnecessarily &mdash; but you should use all proper caution.  A 
draught of this Medoc will defend us from the damps." 
</p><p>Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long 
row of its fellows that lay upon the mould. 
</p><p>"Drink," I said, presenting him the wine. 
</p><p>He raised it to his lips with a leer.  He paused and nodded to me 
familiarly, while his bells jingled. 
<pb n="1093"/>  
</p><p>"I drink," he said, "to the buried that repose around us." 
</p><p>"And I to your long life." 
</p><p>He again took my arm, and we proceeded. 
</p><p>"These vaults," he said, "are extensive." 
</p><p>"The Montresors," I replied, "were a great and numerous family." 
</p><p>"I forget your arms." 
</p><p>"A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a 
serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel." 
</p><p>"And the motto?" 
</p><p>"NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSIT." 
</p><p>"Good!" he said. 
</p><p>The wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled.  My own fancy 
grew warm with the Medoc.  We had passed through long walls of 
piled skeletons, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost 
recesses of the catacombs.  I paused again, and this time I made 
bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow. 
</p><p>"The nitre!" I said; "see, it increases.  It hangs like moss upon the 
vaults.  We are below the river's bed.  The drops of moisture trickle 
among the bones.  Come, we will go back ere it is too late.  Your 
cough &mdash; " 
</p><p>"It is nothing," he said; "let us go on.  But first, another draught of 
the Medoc." 
</p><p>I broke and reached him a flacon of De Grave.  He emptied it at a 
breath.  His eyes flashed with a fierce light.  He laughed and threw the 
bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand. 
</p><p>I looked at him in surprise.  He repeated the movement &mdash; a 
grotesque one. 
</p><p>"You do not comprehend?" he said. 
</p><p>"Not I," I replied. 
</p><p>"Then you are not of the brotherhood." 
</p><p>"How?" 
</p><p>"You are not of the masons." 
</p><p>"Yes, yes," I said, "yes, yes." 
</p><p>"You?  Impossible!  A mason?" 
</p><p>"A mason," I replied. 
</p><p>"A sign," he said, "a sign." 
</p><p>"It is this," I answered, producing from beneath the folds of my 
ROQUELAIRE a trowel. 
</p><p>"You jest," he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces.  "But let us proceed 
to the Amontillado." 
</p><p>"Be it so," I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak, and again 
<pb n="1094"/>  
offering him my arm.  He leaned upon it heavily.  We continued our 
route in search of the Amontillado.  We passed through a range of 
low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at 
a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux 
rather to glow than flame. 
</p><p>At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less 
spacious.  Its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the 
vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris.  Three 
sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. 
From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and lay 
promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some 
size.  Within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we 
perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth about four feet, in 
width three, in height six or seven.  It seemed to have been constructed 
for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the 
interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the 
catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of 
solid granite. 
</p><p>It was in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavored 
to pry into the depth of the recess.  Its termination the feeble light did 
not enable us to see. 
</p><p>"Proceed," I said; "herein is the Amontillado.  As for Luchresi &mdash; " 
</p><p>"He is an ignoramus," interrupted my friend, as he stepped 
unsteadily forward, while I followed immediately at his heels.  In an 
instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his 
progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered.  A moment 
more and I had fettered him to the granite.  In its surface were two 
iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. 
From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. 
Throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few 
seconds to secure it.  He was too much astounded to resist. 
Withdrawing the key I stepped back from the recess. 
</p><p>"Pass your hand," I said, "over the wall; you cannot help feeling 
the nitre.  Indeed it is VERY damp.  Once more let me IMPLORE you to 
return.  No?  Then I must positively leave you.  But I must first render 
you all the little attentions in my power." 
</p><p>"The Amontillado!" ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from 
his astonishment. 
</p><p>"True," I replied; "the Amontillado." 
</p><p>As I said these words I busied myself among the pile of bones of 
which I have before spoken.  Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered 
a quantity of building stone and mortar.  With these 
<pb n="1095"/>  
materials and with the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to wall 
up the entrance of the niche. 
</p><p>I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered 
that the intoxication of Fortunato had in great measure worn off. 
The earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from the 
depth of the recess.  It was NOT the cry of a drunken man.  There was 
then a long and obstinate silence.  I laid the second tier, and the third, 
and the fourth; and then I heard the furious vibration of the chain. 
The noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that I might 
hearken to it with the more satisfaction, I ceased my labors and sat 
down upon the bones.  When at last the clanking subsided, I resumed 
the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and 
the seventh tier.  The wall was now nearly upon a level with my 
breast.  I again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the masonwork, 
threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within. 
</p><p>A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from 
the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. 
For a brief moment I hesitated &mdash; I trembled.  Unsheathing my rapier, 
I began to grope with it about the recess: but the thought of an instant 
reassured me.  I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the 
catacombs, and felt satisfied.  I reapproached the wall.  I replied to 
the yells of him who clamored.  I re-echoed &mdash; I aided &mdash; I surpassed 
them in volume and in strength.  I did this, and the clamorer grew 
still. 
</p><p>It was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close.  I had 
completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier.  I had finished a 
portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single 
stone to be fitted and plastered in.  I struggled with its weight; I 
placed it partially in its destined position.  But now there came from 
out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head.  It was 
succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognising as 
that of the noble Fortunato.  The voice said &mdash; 
</p><p>"Ha! ha! ha! he! he! &mdash; a very good joke indeed &mdash; an excellent jest. 
We will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo &mdash; he! he! he! 
 &mdash; over our wine &mdash; he! he! he!" 
</p><p>"The Amontillado!" I said. 
</p><p>"He! he! he! &mdash; he! he! he! &mdash; yes, the Amontillado.  But is it not 
getting late?  Will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo, the Lady 
Fortunato and the rest?  Let us be gone." 
</p><p>"Yes," I said, "let us be gone." 
</p><p>"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONTRESOR!" 
</p><p>"Yes," I said, "for the love of God!" 
<pb n="1096"/>  
</p><p>But to these words I hearkened in vain for a reply.  I grew 
impatient.  I called aloud &mdash; 
</p><p>"Fortunato!" 
</p><p>No answer.  I called again &mdash; 
</p><p>"Fortunato!" 
</p><p>No answer still.  I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture 
and let it fall within.  There came forth in return only a jingling of the 
bells.  My heart grew sick; it was the dampness of the catacombs that 
made it so.  I hastened to make an end of my labor.  I forced the last 
stone into its position; I plastered it up.  Against the new masonry I 
re-erected the old rampart of bones.  For the half of a century no 
mortal has disturbed them.  IN PACE REQUIESCAT!
