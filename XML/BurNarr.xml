follows. The Rev. Deodat Lawson was singularly qualified to write it. He had
himself, only a little earlier (1684-1688), served as pastor to Salem Village, the
rural community in which these happenings took their rise; and, though
dissensions in the parish prevented his longer stay, he seems to have been no
party to these dissensions and must meanwhile have learned to know the scene
and all the actors of that later drama which he here depicts. He was, too, a man
of education, travel, social experience. Born in England, the son of a scholarly
Puritan minister, and doubtless educated there, he first appears in New England
in 1676, and at the time of his call to Salem Village was making his home in
Boston. Thither he returned in 1688: Samuel Sewall, who on May 13 had him in
at Sunday dinner, notes in his diary that he &ldquo;came to Town to dwell last
week,&rdquo; and often mentions him thereafter. How at the outbreak of the
witchpanic he came to revisit the Village and to chronicle the doings there, he
himself a dozen years later thus told his English friends:<ref target="n1">[1]</ref></p>

<q>It pleased God in the Year of our Lord 1692 to visit the People at a place
called Salem Village in New-England, with a very Sore and Grievous Affliction,
in which they had reason to believe, that the Soveraign and Holy God was
pleased to permit Satan and his Instruments, to Affright and Afflict those poor
Mortals in such an Astonishing and Unusual manner.</q>


<pb n="148"/>


<q>Now, I having for some time before attended the work of the Ministry in
that Village, the Report of those Great Afflictions came quickly to my notice; and
the more readily because the first Person Afflicted was in the Minister's Family,
who succeeded me, after I was removed from them; in pitty therefore to my
Christian Friends, and former Acquaintance there, I was much concerned about
them, frequently consulted with them, and fervently (by Divine Assistance)
prayed for them; but especially my Concern was augmented, when it was
Reported, at an Examination of a Person suspected for Witchcraft, that my Wife
and Daughter, who Dyed Three Years before, were sent out of the World under
the Malicious Operations of the Infernal Powers; as is more fully represented in
the following Remarks. I did then Desire, and was also Desired, by some
concerned in the Court, to be there present, that I might hear what was alledged
in that respect; observing therefore, when I was amongst them, that the Case of
the Afflicted was very amazing, and deplorable; and the Charges brought against
the Accused, such as were Ground of Suspicions yet very intricate, and difficult
to draw up right Conclusions about them; I thought good for the satisfaction of
my self, and such of my Friends as might be curious to inquiry into those
Mysteries of Gods Providence and Satans Malice, to draw up and keep by me,
a Brief Account of the most Remarkable things, that came to my Knowledge in
those Affairs; which Remarks were afterwards, (at my Request) Revised and
Corrected by some who Sate Judges on the Bench, in those Matters; and were
now Transcribed, from the same Paper, on which they were then Written.</q>

<p>A narrative so timely and so vouched for must have gone speedily into
print.<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> The latest day named in it &mdash; &ldquo;the 5th of
April&rdquo; &mdash; was probably the date both of its completion and of its
going to press. In 1693 it was reprinted in London by John Dunton, who
appended to it an anonymous &ldquo;Further Account of the Tryals of the
New-England Witches&rdquo; (an extract from &ldquo;a letter from thence to
a Gentleman in London&rdquo;) bringing the story to February, 1693, and to
both joined


<pb n="149"/>


Increase Mather's <hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi> (see pp.
377, 378, below),prefixing to the volume thus made up the title:
<hi rend="italic">A Further Account of the Tryals of the New-England Witches.
With the Observations of a Person who was upon the Place several Days when
the suspected Witches were first taken into Examination. To which is added,
Cases of Conscience</hi>, etc.<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> In 1704 Lawson, himself now in England, cast
it into a new form as an appendix to the English edition of his Salem
sermon.<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>
All names are now left out, that he &ldquo;may not grieve any, whose Relations
were either Accused or Afflicted, in those times of Trouble and Distress,&rdquo;
and what had been a narrative is given a statistical form under &ldquo;three
Heads, viz. (1.) Relating to the Afflicted, (2.) Relating to the Accused, And (3.)
Relating to the Confessing Witches.&rdquo;<ref target="n5">[5]</ref> On his own views, and the probable
trend of his influence while at Salem, light is thrown by his introductory
words:</p>


<q>After this,<ref target="n6">[6]</ref> I being by the Providence of God called over into England, in
the Year 1696; I then brought that Paper of Remarks on the Witchcraft with me;
upon the sight thereof, some Worthy Ministers and Christian Friends here desired
me to Reprint the Sermon and subjoyn the Remarks thereunto, in way of
Appendix, but for some particular Reasons I did then Decline it; But now,
forasmuch as I my self had been an Eye and Ear Witness of most of those
Amazing things, so far as they come within the Notice of Humane Senses; and
the Requests of my Friends were Renewed since I came to Dwell in London; I
have given way to the Publishing of them; that I may satisfy such as are not
resolved to the Contrary, that there may be (and are) such Operations of the
Powers of Darkness on the


<pb n="150"/>


Bodies and Minds of Mankind, by Divine Permission; and that those who Sate
Judges in those Cases, may by the serious Consideration of the formidable Aspect
and perplexed Circumstances of that Afflictive Providence be in some measure
excused; or at least be less Censured, for passing Sentance on several Persons,
as being the Instruments of Satan in those Diabolical Operations, when they were
involved in such a Dark and Dismal Scene of Providence, in which Satan did
seem to Spin a finer Thred of Spiritual Wickedness than in the ordinary methods
of Witchcraft; hence the Judges desiring to bear due Testimony against such
Diabolical Practices, were inclined to admit the validity of such a sort of
Evidence as was not so clearly and directly demonstrable to Human Senses, as
in other Cases is required, or else they could not discover the Mysteries of
Witchcraft....</q>


<p>One can not read these words without a suspicion that the reaction in New
England against those held responsible for the procedure at Salem may have had
to do with his return to England; and even in England, it is clear, his cause now
needed defense. If any can wish him further ill, let them be appeased by our two
glimpses of his after fate &mdash; a despairing letter in 1714,<ref target="n7">[7]</ref> begging from his
New England friends meat, drink, and clothing for his sick and starving family,
and the passing phrase of a writer who in 1727, mentioning Thomas Lawson,
adds that &ldquo;he was the father of the unhappy Mr. Deodate Lawson, who
came hither from New England.&rdquo;<ref target="n8">[8]</ref></p>



<p>But the reader should not enter on the study of the witchpanic of 1692
without knowing something of our other sources of knowledge. The contemporary
narratives are practically all printed in the pages that follow, and a part of the
trial records will be found embodied in Cotton Mather's
<hi rend="italic">Wonders</hi>;<ref target="n9">[9]</ref> but most of these must be sought otherwhere,
and, alas, they are sadly scattered. Some Governor Hutchinson preserved in


<pb n="151"/>


his wise and careful pages on this subject,<ref target="n10">[10]</ref> where alone a part can now be found.
Many have drifted into private hands &mdash; like those which in 1860 came into
the hands of the Massachusetts Historical Society and are in part printed in its
<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> (1860-1862, pp. 31-37), or those
published by Drake in the foot-notes and appendices to his various histories and
editions,<ref target="n11">[11]</ref> or those now in the keeping of the Essex Institute at Salem or of the
Boston Public Library.<ref target="n12">[12]</ref> Such of these as are in print are mentioned in the notes
at the proper points. But most are still in public keeping at Salem; and these in
1864 were printed by W. Elliot Woodward in the two volumes of his
<hi rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, the work most fundamental
for the first-hand study of this episode. It is, however, imperfect and far from
complete, and there is hope of a better: the <hi rend="italic">Records and
Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County</hi>, of which a third volume
has just appeared, must in due course include these witch-trials, and Mr. George
Francis Dow, their editor (who has already by his publication of the witchcraft
records relating to Topsfield<ref target="n13">[13]</ref> shown his keenness in such work), has in mind the
seizing of this opportunity to print all obtainable papers relating to the Salem
Witchcraft episode. Precious documents too are published by Upham in his
classical <hi rend="italic">Salem Witchcraft</hi><ref target="n14">[14]</ref> and in the acute and
learned studies of Mr. Abner C. Goodell and Mr. George H.
Moore.<ref target="n15">[15]</ref></p>

<head>Narrative</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the Nineteenth day of March
last<ref target="n17">[17]</ref> I went to Salem Village,<ref target="n18">[18]</ref> and lodged at Nathaniel Ingersols near to the

<pb n="153"/>

Minister Mr. P's. house,<ref target="n19">[19]</ref> and presently after I came into my Lodging Capt. Walcuts
Daughter Mary<ref target="n20">[20]</ref> came to Lieut. Ingersols and spake to me, but, suddenly after
as she stood by the door, was bitten, so that she cried out of her Wrist, and
looking on it with a Candle, we saw apparently the marks of Teeth both upper
and lower set, on each side of her wrist.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Evening, I went to give Mr. P.<ref target="n21">[21]</ref> a visit. When I was
there, his Kins-woman, Abigail Williams, (about 12 years of age,) had a grievous
fit; she was at first hurryed with Violence to and fro in the room, (though Mrs.
Ingersol endeavoured to hold her,) sometimes makeing as if she would fly,
stretching up her arms as high as she could, and crying &ldquo;Whish, Whish,
Whish!&rdquo; several times; Presently after she said there was Goodw.
N.<ref target="n22">[22]</ref> and said, &ldquo;Do you not see her? Why there she stands!&rdquo; And the said
Goodw. N. offered her The Book, but she was resolved she would not

<pb n="154"/>

take it, saying Often, &ldquo;I wont, I wont, I wont, take it, I do not know what
Book it is: I am sure it is none of Gods Book, it is the Divels Book, for ought I
know.&rdquo; After that, she run to the Fire, and begun to throw Fire Brands,
about the house; and run against the Back, as if she would run up Chimney, and,
as they said, she had attempted to go into the Fire in other Fits.</p>

<p>On Lords Day, the Twentieth of March, there were sundry of the afflicted
Persons at Meeting, as, Mrs. Pope, and Goodwife Bibber, Abigail Williams.
Mary Walcut, Mary Lewes, and Docter Griggs' Maid.<ref target="n23">[23]</ref> There was also at
Meeting, Goodwife C.<ref target="n24">[24]</ref> (who was afterward Examined on suspicion of being a
Witch:) They had several Sore Fits, in the time of Publick Worship, which did
something interrupt me in my First Prayer; being so unusual. After Psalm was
Sung, Abigail Williams said to me, &ldquo;Now stand up, and Name your
Text&rdquo;: And after it was read, she said, &ldquo;It is a long Text.&rdquo;
In the beginning of Sermon, Mrs. Pope, a Woman afflicted, said to me,
&ldquo;Now there is enough of that.&rdquo; And in the afternoon, Abigail
Williams upon my referring to my Doctrine said to me, &ldquo;I know no
Doctrine you had, If you did name one, I have forgot it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>In Sermon time when Goodw. C was present in the Meetinghouse Ab. W.
called out, &ldquo;Look where Goodw. C sits on the Beam suckling her Yellow
bird betwixt her fingers&rdquo;! Anne Putnam another Girle afflicted said there
was a Yellow-bird sat on my hat as it hung on the Pin in the Pulpit: but those that
were by, restrained her from speaking loud about it.</p>


<p>On Monday the 21st of March, The Magistrates of Salem appointed to
come to Examination of Goodw C.<ref target="n25">[25]</ref> And about

<pb n="155"/>

twelve of the Clock, they went into the Meeting-House, which was Thronged with
Spectators: Mr. Noyes<ref target="n26">[26]</ref> began with a very pertinent and pathetic Prayer; and
Goodwife C. being called to answer to what was Alledged against her, she
desired to go to Prayer, which was much wondred at, in the presence of so many
hundred people: The Magistrates told her, they would not admit it; they came not
there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her, in what was Alledged against her.
The Worshipful Mr. Hathorne<ref target="n27">[27]</ref> asked her, Why she Afflicted those Children? she
said, she did not Afflict them. He asked her, who did then? she said, &ldquo;I
do not know; How should I know?&rdquo; The Number of the Afflicted Persons
were about that time Ten, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Four Married
Women, Mrs. Pope, Mrs. Putman,<ref target="n28">[28]</ref> Goodw. Bibber, and an Ancient Woman,
named Goodall, three Maids, Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes, at Thomas Putman's,
and a Maid at Dr. Griggs's, there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age,
each of them, or thereabouts, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Elizabeth Parris,
Abigail Williams and Ann Putman; these were most of them at G. C's
Examination, and did vehemently accuse her in the Assembly of afflicting them,
by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc. And that they did in their Fit see her
Likeness coming to them, and bringing a Book to them, she said, she had no
Book; they affirmed, she had a Yellow-Bird, that used to suck betwixt her
Fingers, and being asked about it, if she had any Familiar Spirit, that attended
her, she said, She had no Familiarity with any such thing. She was a Gospel
Woman: which Title she called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her,
ah! She was, A Gospel Witch. Ann Putman did there affirm, that one day when
Lieutenant Fuller was at

<pb n="156"/>




Prayer at her Fathers House, she saw the shape of Goodw. C. and she thought
Goodw. N. Praying at the same time to the Devil, she was not sure it was
Goodw. N. she thought it was; but very sure she saw the Shape of G. C. The
said C. said, they were poor, distracted Children, and no heed to be given to
what they said. Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes replyed, it was the judgment of all
that were present, they were Bewitched, and only she, the Accused Person said,
they were Distracted. It was observed several times, that if she did but bite her
Under lip in time of Examination the persons afflicted were bitten on their armes
and wrists and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Ministers and others.
And being watched for that, if she did but Pinch her Fingers, or Graspe one hand
hard in another, they were Pinched and produced the Marks before the
Magistrates, and Spectators. After that, it was observed, that if she did but lean
her Breast against the Seat, in the Meeting House, (being the Barr at which she
stood,) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of grievous
torment in her Bowels as if they were torn out. She vehemently accused said C.
as the instrument, and first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, she
got off her Shoe, and hit Goodwife C. on the head with it. After these postures
were watched, if said C. did but stir her feet, they were afflicted in their Feet,
and stamped fearfully. The afflicted persons asked her why she did not go to the
company of Witches which were before the Meeting house mustering? Did she
not hear the Drum beat? They accused her of having Familiarity with the Devil,
in the time of Examination, in the shape of a Black man whispering in her ear;
they affirmed, that her Yellow-Bird sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly;
and order being given to see if there were any sign, the Girl that saw it said, it
was too late now; she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head; which was
found there sticking upright.</p>


<p>They told her, she had Covenanted with the Devil for ten years, six of them
were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the Magistrates to
answer that Question in the Catechism, &ldquo;How many persons be there in
the God-Head?&rdquo; she answered it but oddly, yet was there no great thing
to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon her,

<pb n="157"/>




and said, They could not prove a Witch; she was that Afternoon Committed to
Salem-Prison; and after she was in Custody, she did not so appear to them, and
afflict them as before.</p>


<p>On Wednesday the 23 of March, I went to Thomas Putmans, on purpose
to see his Wife: I found her lying on the Bed, having had a sore fit a little before.
She spake to me, and said, she was glad to see me; her Husband and she both
desired me to pray with her, while she was sensible; which I did, though the
Apparition said, I should not go to Prayer. At the first beginning she attended;
but after a little time, was taken with a fit: yet continued silent, and seemed to
be Asleep: when Prayer was done, her Husband going to her, found her in a Fit;
he took her off the Bed, to set her on his Knees; but at first she was so stiff, she
could not be bended; but she afterwards set down; but quickly began to strive
violently with her Arms and Leggs; she then began to Complain of, and as it
were to Converse personally with, Goodw. N., saying, &ldquo;Goodw. N. Be
gone! Be gone! Be gone! are you not ashamed, a Woman of your Profession, to
afflict a poor Creature so? what hurt did I ever do you in my life! you have but
two years to live, and then the Devil will torment your Soul, for this your Name
is blotted out of Gods Book, and it shall never be put in Gods Book again, be
gone for shame, are you not afraid of that which is coming upon you? I Know,
I know, what will make you afraid; the wrath of an Angry God, I am sure that
will make you afraid; be gone, do not tourment me, I know what you would have
(we judged she meant, her Soul) but it is out of your reach; it is Clothed with the
white Robes of Christs Righteousness.&rdquo; After this, she seemed to dispute
with the Apparition about a particular Text of Scripture. The Apparition seemed
to deny it, (the Womans eyes being fast closed all this time); she said, She was
sure there was such a Text; and she would tell it; and then the Shape would be
gone, for said she, &ldquo;I am sure you cannot stand before that Text!&rdquo;
then she was sorely Afflicted; her mouth drawn on one side, and her body
strained for about a minute, and then said, &ldquo;I will tell, I will tell; it is, it
is, it is!&rdquo; three or four times, and then was afflicted to hinder her from
telling, at last she broke forth and said, &ldquo;It is the third Chapter of the
Revelations.&rdquo; I did something scruple the reading it, and did let my
scruple ap

pear, lest Satan should make any Superstitious lie to improve the Word of the
Eternal God. However, tho' not versed in these things, I judged I might do it this
once for an Experiment. I began to read, and before I had near read through the
first verse, she opened her eyes, and was well; this fit continued near half an
hour. Her Husband and the Spectators told me, she had often been so relieved by
reading Texts that she named, something pertinent to her Case; as Isa. 40. 1, Isa.
49. 1, Isa. 50. 1, and several others.</p>


<p>On Thursday the Twenty fourth of march, (being in course the Lecture
Day, at the Village,) Goodwife N. was brought before the Magistrates Mr.
Hathorne and Mr. Corwin,<ref target="n29">[29]</ref> about Ten of
[the] Clock, in the Fore Noon, to be
Examined in the Meeting House; the Reverend Mr. Hale<ref target="n30">[30]</ref> begun with Prayer, and
the Warrant being read, she was required to give answer, Why she aflicted those
persons? she pleaded her owne innocency with earnestness. Thomas Putman's
Wife, Abigail Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she
appeared to them, and afflicted them in their fitts: but some of the other said, that
they had seen her, but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which was
Mary Walcut, who was presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out
of her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her wrist. It was so
disposed, that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of
Examination,<ref target="n31">[31]</ref> but
both Magistrates

<pb n="159"/>




and Ministers told me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences
made by her, were much after the same manner, as the former was. And her
Motions did produce like effects as to Biteing, Pinching, Bruising, Tormenting,
at their Breasts, by her Leaning, and when, bended Back, were as if their Backs
was broken. The afflicted persons said, the Black Man whispered to her in the
Assembly, and therefore she could not hear what the Magistrates said unto her.
They said also that she did then ride by the Meeting-house, behind the Black
Man. Thomas Putman's wife had a grievous Fit, in the time of Examination, to
the very great Impairing of her strength, and wasting of her spirits, insomuch as
she could hardly move hand, or foot, when she was carryed out. Others also were
there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such an hideous scrietch and
noise, (which I heard as I walked, at a little distance from the Meeting house,)
as did amaze me, and some that were within told me the whole assembly was
struck with consternation, and they were afraid, that those that sate next to them,
were under the influence of Witchcraft. This woman also was that day committed
to Salem Prison. The Magistrates and Ministers also did informe me, that they
apprehended a child of Sarah G.<ref target="n32">[32]</ref> and Examined it, being between 4 and 5 years
of Age, And as to matter of Fact, they did Unanimously affirm, that when this
Child did but cast its eye upon the afflicted persons, they were tormented, and
they held her Head, and yet so many as her eye could fix upon were afflicted.
Which they did several times make careful observation of: the afflicted
complained, they had often been Bitten by this child, and produced the marks of
a small set of teeth, accordingly, this was also committed to Salem Prison; the
child looked hail, and well as other Children. I saw it at Lieut.
Ingersols.<ref target="n33">[33]</ref> After
the commitment of Goodw. N., Tho: Putmans wife was much better, and had no
violent fits

<pb n="160"/>




at all from that 24th of March to the 5th of April. Some others also said they had
not seen her so frequently appear to them, to hurt them.</p>


<p>On the 25th of March, (as Capt. Stephen Sewal,<ref target="n34">[34]</ref> of Salem, did afterwards
inform me) Eliza. Paris had sore Fits, at his house, which much troubled himself,
and his wife, so as he told me they were almost discouraged. She related, that the
great Black Man came to her, and told her, if she would be ruled by him, she
should have whatsoever she desired, and go to a Golden City. She relating this
to Mrs. Sewall, she told the child, it was the Divel, and he was a Lyar from the
Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he came again: which she did accordingly,
at the next coming to her, in her fits.</p>


<p>On the 26th of March, Mr. Hathorne, Mr. Corwin, and Mr.
Higison<ref target="n35">[35]</ref> were
at the Prison-Keepers House, to Examine the Child,<ref target="n36">[36]</ref> and it told them there, it
had a little Snake that used to Suck on the lowest Joynt of it[s] Fore-Finger; and
when they inquired where, pointing to other places, it told them, not there, but
there, pointing on the Lowest point of Fore-Finger; where they Observed a deep
Red Spot, about the Bigness of a Flea-bite, they asked who gave it that Snake?
whether the great Black man, it said no, its Mother gave it.</p>


<p>The 31 of March there was a Publick Fast kept at Salem on account of
these Afflicted Persons. And Abigail Williams said, that the Witches had a
Sacrament that day at an house in the Village, and that they had Red Bread and
Red Drink. The first of April, Mercy Lewis, Thomas Putman's Maid, in her fitt,
said, they did eat Red Bread like Mans Flesh, and

<pb n="161"/>




would have had her eat some: but she would not; but turned away her head, and
Spit at them, and said, &ldquo;I will not Eat, I will not Drink, it is
Blood,&rdquo; etc. She said, &ldquo;That is not the Bread of Life, that is not the
Water of Life; Christ gives the Bread of Life, I will have none of it!&rdquo; This
first of April also Marcy Lewis aforesaid saw in her fitt a White man and was
with him in a Glorious Place, which had no Candles nor Sun, yet was full of
Light and Brightness; where was a great Multitude in White glittering Robes, and
they Sung the Song in the fifth of Revelation the Ninth verse, and the 110 Psalm,
and the 149 Psalm; and said with her self, &ldquo;How long shall I stay here?
let me be along with you&rdquo;: She was loth to leave this place, and grieved
that she could tarry no longer. This Whiteman<ref target="n37">[37]</ref> hath appeared several times to
some of them, and given them notice how long it should be before they had
another Fit, which was sometimes a day, or day and half, or more or less: it hath
fallen out accordingly.</p>


<p>The third of April, the Lords-Day, being Sacrament-day, at the Village,
Goodw. C.<ref target="n38">[38]</ref> upon Mr. Parris's naming his Text, John 6, 70, <hi
rend="italic">One of them is a Devil</hi>, the said Goodw. C. went
immediately out of the Meeting-House, and flung the door after her violently, to
the amazement of the Congregation: She was afterward seen by some in their
Fits, who said, &ldquo;O Goodw. C., I did not think to see you here!&rdquo;
(and being at their Red bread and drink) said to her, &ldquo;Is this a time to
receive the Sacrament, you ran-away on the Lords-Day, and scorned to receive
it in the Meeting-House, and, Is this a time to receive it? I wonder at
you!&rdquo; This is the summ of what I either saw my self, or did receive
Information from persons of undoubted Reputation and Credit.</p>

a rural district (what is now the township of Danvers, with parts of the townships
adjoining it) which till 1672 had been a mere dependence of the town, but in that
year, at the request of its inhabitants, was set off as a separate parish, though not
as a distinct town. Despite the name of &ldquo;village,&rdquo; there was in
Salem Village no huddle of houses amounting to a hamlet, though about the
meeting-house (where now is Danvers Highlands) the farm-houses clustered more
thickly than elsewhere. Prefixed to the Rev. Charles W. Upham's

in the Salem panic was to be so great, had been at Salem Village since 1688,
succeeding Deodat Lawson as its spiritual head. Till then, though educated at
Harvard, which is to say for the ministry, he had been engaged in the West
Indian trade, and had lived for a time in Barbadoes, whence he had brought back
with him the two slaves, John and Tituba, perhaps half negro, half native, with
whom we must soon have to do. Abigail Williams, his niece, was a member of
his household; and we shall meet also his little daughter Elizabeth, aged nine. The
account of his life by S. P. Fowler (Essex Institute,

(Salem, 1857) and is appended to Drake's ed. of Mather and Calef (III. 198-222).

daughter, both named Ann, were also to have a leading part among &ldquo;the
afflicted.&rdquo; &ldquo;Doctor Griggs' maid,&rdquo; Elizabeth Hubbard, aged

<hi rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, I. 50-60. Especially
interesting is the evidence as to her rational attitude: &ldquo;shee told us,&rdquo;

were not men trained to the law, but only respected laymen.</p></note>

<note id="n31"><seg type="note-symbol">[31].</seg> <p>What drew Mr. Lawson away from the examinations was doubtless the
need to complete his preparation for the important sermon of that day; and it must
have been this on which he was pondering when (as he records a few lines later)
the shrieks of the afflicted reached him as he walked, &ldquo;a little distance
from the meeting-house.&rdquo; That sermon was, however, no extempore
production, but a studied disquisition on the power and malice of the Devil, who
&ldquo;Contracts and Indents with Witches and Wizzards, that they shall be the
Instruments by whom he may more secretly Affect and Afflict the Bodies and
Minds of others.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the Devil,&rdquo; taught Lawson,
committing himself wholly to belief in the worth of that &ldquo;spectral
evidence&rdquo; which was to play such a part in the Salem episode,
&ldquo;having them in his subjection, by their Consent, he will use their Bodies
and Minds, Shapes and Representations, to Affright and Afflict others at his
pleasure.&rdquo; The magistrates were present at the sermon; and to them he
dedicated the sermon when, in the following year, he gave it to the press under
the title of <hi rend="italic">Christ's Fidelity the only Shield against Satan's

<head>Remarks of things more than ordinary about the Afflicted Persons.</head>


<p>1. They are in their Fits tempted to be Witches, are shewed the List of the
Names of others, and are tortured, because they will not yield to Subscribe, or
meddle with, or touch the Book, and are promised to have present Relief if they
would do it.</p>

<pb n="162"/>

<p>2. They did in the Assembly mutually Cure each other, even with a Touch
of their Hand, when Strangled, and otherwise Tortured; and would endeavour to
get to their Afflicted, to Relieve them.</p>


<p>3. They did also foretel when anothers Fit was a-coming, and would say,
&ldquo;Look to her! she will have a Fit presently,&rdquo; which fell out
accordingly, as many can bear witness, that heard and saw it.</p>


<p>4. That at the same time, when the Accused Person was present, the
Afflicted Persons saw her Likeness in other places of the Meeting-House,
suckling her Familiar, sometimes in one place and posture, and sometimes in
another.</p>


<p>5. That their Motions in their Fits are Preternatural, both as to the manner,
which is so strange as a well person could not Screw their Body into; and as to
the violence also it is preternatural, being much beyond the Ordinary force of the
same person when they are in their right mind.</p>


<p>6. The eyes of some of them in their fits are exceeding fast closed, and if
you ask a question they can give no answer, and I do believe they cannot hear at
that time, yet do they plainely converse with the Appearances, as if they did
discourse with real persons.</p>


<p>7. They are utterly pressed against any persons Praying with them, and told
by the appearances, they shall not go to Prayer, so Tho. Putmans wife was told,
I should not Pray; but she said, I should: and after I had done, reasoned with the
Appearance, &ldquo;Did not I say he should go to Prayer?&rdquo;</p>


<p>8. The forementioned Mary W.<ref target="n39">[39]</ref> being a little better at ease, the Afflicted
persons said, she had signed the book; and that was the reason she was better.
Told me by Edward Putman.<ref target="n40">[40]</ref></p>

particular persons hurting of them.</p>


<p>2. In Time of Examination, they seemed little affected, though all the
Spectators were much grieved to see it.</p>


<p>3. Natural Actions in them produced Preternatural actions in the
Afflicted, so that they are their own Image without any Poppits of Wax
or otherwise.<ref target="n41">[41]</ref>

</p><p>4. That they are accused to have a Company about 23 or 24 and they did
Muster in Armes, as it seemed to the Afflicted Persons.

</p><p>5. Since they were confined, the Persons have not been so much
Afflicted with their appearing to them, Biteing or Pinching of them,
etc.

</p><p>6. They are reported by the Afflicted Persons to keep dayes of Fast
and dayes of Thanksgiving, and Sacraments;. Satan endeavours to
Transforme himself to an Angel of Light, and to make his Kingdom and
Administrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p><p>7. Satan Rages Principally amongst the Visible Subjects of Christ's
Kingdom and makes use (at least in appearance) of some of them to
Afflict others; that Christ's Kingdom may be divided against it self,
and so be weakened.

</p><p>8. Several things used in England at Tryal of Witches, to the Number
of 14 or 15, which are wont to pass instead of or in Concurrence with

<head>LETTER OF THOMAS BRATTLE, F. R. S., 1692</head>

<div2 type="introduction" id="d19">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>


<p><hi rend="small-caps">From</hi> that April day when Mr. Lawson
closed his account it was long before another eye-witness undertook a narrative.
Yet great things were doing. At Salem accusation and hearing went on apace, and
the jails grew crowded, awaiting the session of a court. On May 14 arrived from
England President Increase Mather, bringing the new charter, and with him the
new governor, Sir William Phips. What the governor thought of the emergency
and how he dealt with it we shall presently learn from his own pen. But other
pens were earlier busy. Perhaps the most notable was that of Thomas Brattle,
who early in October addressed the following letter to some clerical
correspondent. Who this divine may have been whose questions the letter answers
is unknown: our document is not the original, but a copy without superscription,
and from its contents we can infer no more than that he lived or had lived in the
colony. But Thomas Brattle we know well. &ldquo;He was,&rdquo; wrote
President Leverett of Harvard at his death, &ldquo;a gentleman by his birth and
education of the first order in this country.&rdquo; Born at Boston, in 1658, of
wealthy parentage, a graduate and a master of arts of Harvard, then a traveller
and a student abroad, he won such distinction as a mathematician, and notably as
an astronomer, as to be made a member of the Royal Society, and was in close
touch with the world of scholars; but his career was that of an opulent and
cultivated Boston merchant, and for twenty years, from 1693 to his death in
1713, he was treasurer of Harvard College. &ldquo;In the Church,&rdquo; said
of him the Boston <hi rend="italic">News-Letter</hi>, &ldquo;he was
known and valued for his Catholick Charity to all of the reformed


<pb n="168"/>


Religion, but more especially his great Veneration for the Church of England,
although his general and more constant communion was with the
Nonconformists.&rdquo; In other words, he was of the liberal party in religion
and politics, an eminent opponent of the Puritan theocracy, and he did not escape
the epithets &ldquo;apostate&rdquo; and &ldquo;infidel.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The letter here printed did not see print in his own day; but that the present
copy exists suggests that it may have been meant to circulate in
manuscript,<ref target="n43">[43]</ref> and
it is not impossible that it was even written for that purpose. Yet if so, we may
be sure it was used with discretion. It was his grand-nephew, the then well-known
Thomas Brattle, Esq., of Cambridge, who late in the eighteenth century
communicated it to the Massachusetts Historical Society.<ref target="n44">[44]</ref> From that manuscript
copy it is here reprinted.</p>



<div3 type="notes" id="d20">
<head>Notes</head>

<note id="n43"><seg type="note-symbol">[43].</seg> <p>The suggestion is that of Sibley, in his sketch of Brattle's life
(<hi rend="italic">Harvard Graduates</hi>, II. 489-498), the best summary of
what is known of him. That the extant copy is without superscription, and signed
by initials only, may point to such a use. It must not be forgotten that it was
written on the eve of the session of the General Court.</p></note>

<salute><hi rend="italic">Reverend Sir</hi>,</salute>
</opener>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Your's</hi> I received the other day, and am
very ready to serve you to my uttmost. I should be very loath to bring myself into
any snare by my freedom with you, and therefore hope that you will put the best
construction on what I write, and secure me from such as would interprett my
lines otherwise than they are designed. Obedience to lawfull authority I evermore
accounted a great duty; and willingly I would not practise any thing that might
thwart and contradict such a principle. Too many are ready to despise dominions,
and speak evil of Dignities; and I am sure the mischiefs, which arise from a
factious and rebellious spirit, are very sad and notorious; insomuch that I would
sooner bite my finger's ends than willingly cast dirt on authority, or any way
offer reproach to it: Far, therefore, be it from me, to have any thing to do with
those men your letter mentions, whom you acknowledge to be men of a factious
spirit, and never more in their element than when they are declaiming against
men in public place, and contriving methods that tend to the disturbance of the
common peace. I never accounted it a credit to my cause, to have the good liking
of such men. <hi rend="italic">My son!</hi> (says Solomon)
<hi rend="italic">fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that
are given to change</hi>. Prov. xxiv. 21. However, Sir, I never thought Judges
infallible; but reckoned that they, as well as private men, might err; and that
when they were guilty of erring, standers by, who possibly had not half their
judgment, might, notwithstanding, be able to detect and behold their errors. And
furthermore, when errors of that nature are thus detected and observed, I never
thought it an interfering with dutifullness and subjection for one man to
communicate his thoughts to another thereabout; and with modesty


<pb n="170"/>


and due reverence to debate the premised failings; at least, when errours are
fundamental, and palpably pervert the great end of authority and government: for
as to circumstantial errours, I must confesse my principle is, that it is the duty of
a good subject to cover with his silence a multitude of them. But I shall no longer
detain you with my preface, but passe to some things you look for, and whether
you expect such freedome from me, yea or no, yet shall you find, that I am very
open to communicate my thoughts unto you, and in plain terms to tell you what
my opinion is of the Salem proceedings.</p>


<p>First, as to the method which the Salem Justices do take in their
examinations, it is truly this: A warrant being issued out to apprehend the persons
that are charged and complained of by the afflicted children, (as they are called);
said persons are brought before the Justices, (the afflicted being present.) The
Justices ask the apprehended why they afflict those poor children; to which the
apprehended answer, they do not afflict them. The Justices order the apprehended
to look upon the said children, which accordingly they do; and at the time of that
look, (I dare not say by that look, as the Salem Gentlemen do) the afflicted are
cast into a fitt. The apprehended are then blinded, and ordered to touch the
afflicted; and at that touch, tho' not by the touch, (as above) the afflicted
ordinarily do come out of their fitts. The afflicted persons then declare and
affirm, that the apprehended have afflicted them; upon which the apprehended
persons, tho' of never so good repute, are forthwith committed to prison, on
suspicion for witchcraft. One of the Salem Justices<ref target="n45">[45]</ref> was pleased to tell Mr.
Alden,<ref target="n46">[46]</ref> (when upon his examination) that truly he had been acquainted with him
these many years; and had always accounted him a good man; but indeed now he
should be obliged to change his opinion. This, there are more than one or two did
hear, and are ready to swear to, if not in so many words, yet as to its natural and
plain meaning. He saw reason to change his opinion of Mr. Alden, because that
at the time he touched the poor child, the poor child came out of her fitt.


<pb n="171"/>


I suppose his Honour never made the experiment, whether there was not as much
virtue in his own hand, as there was in Mr. Alden's, to cure by a touch. I know
a man that will venture two to one with any Salemite whatever, that let the matter
be duly managed, and the afflicted person shall come out of her fitt upon the
touch of the most religious hand in Salem. It is worthily noted by some, that at
some times the afflicted will not presently come out of their fitts upon the touch
of the suspected; and then, forsooth, they are ordered by the Justices to grasp
hard, harder yet, etc. insomuch that at length the afflicted come out of their fitts;
and the reason is very good, because that a touch of any hand, and processe of
time, will work the cure; infallibly they will do it, as experience teaches.</p>


<p>I cannot but condemn this method of the Justices, of making this touch of
the hand a rule to discover witchcraft; because I am fully persuaded that it is
sorcery, and a superstitious method, and that which we have no rule for, either
from reason or religion. The Salem Justices, at least some of them, do assert, that
the cure of the afflicted persons is a natural effect of this touch; and they are so
well instructed in the Cartesian philosophy, and in the doctrine of <hi
rend="italic">effluvia</hi>, that they undertake to give a demonstration how
this touch does cure the afflicted persons; and the account they give of it is this;
that by this touch, the venemous and malignant particles, that were ejected from
the eye, do, by this means, return to the body whence they came, and so leave
the afflicted persons pure and whole. I must confesse to you, that I am no small
admirer of the Cartesian philosophy; but yet I have not so learned it. Certainly
this is a strain that it will by no means allow of.</p>


<p>I would fain know of these Salem Gentlemen, but as yet could never know,
how it comes about, that if these apprehended persons are witches, and, by a look
of the eye, do cast the afflicted into their fitts by poisoning them, how it comes
about, I say, that, by a look of their eye, they do not cast others into fitts, and
poison others by their looks; and in particular, tender, fearfull women, who often
are beheld by them, and as likely as any in the whole world to receive an ill
impression from them. This Salem philosophy, some men may call the


<pb n="172"/>


new philosophy; but I think it rather deserves the name of Salem superstition and
sorcery, and it is not fitt to be named in a land of such light as New-England is.
I think the matter might be better solved another way; but I shall not make any
attempt that way, further than to say, that these afflicted children, (as they are
called,) do hold correspondence with the devill, even in the esteem and account
of the S. G.;<ref target="n47">[47]</ref> for when the black man, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> (say
these gentlemen,) the Devill, does appear to them, they ask him many questions,
and accordingly give information to the inquirer; and if this is not holding
correspondence with the devill, and something worse, I know not what is.</p>


<p>But furthermore, I would fain know of these Salem Justices what need there
is of further proof and evidence to convict and condemn these apprehended
persons, than this look and touch, if so be they are so certain that this falling
down and arising up, when there is a look and a touch, are natural effects of the
said look and touch, and so a perfect demonstration and proof of witchcraft in
those persons. What can the Jury or Judges desire more, to convict any man of
witchcraft, than a plain demonstration, that the said man is a witch? Now if this
look and touch, circumstanced as before, be a plain demonstration, (as their
Philosophy teaches,) what need they seek for further evidences, when, after all,
it can be but a demonstration?</p>


<p>But let this pass with the S. G. for never so plain and natural a
demonstration; yet certain is it, that the reasonable part of the world, when
acquainted herewith, will laugh at the demonstration, and conclude that the said
S. G. are actually possessed, at least, with ignorance and folly.</p>


<p>I most admire<ref target="n48">[48]</ref> that Mr. N. N.<ref target="n49">[49]</ref> the Reverend Teacher at Salem, who was
educated at the School of Knowledge, and is certainly a learned, a charitable, and
a good man, though all the devils in Hell, and all the possessed girls in Salem,
should say to the contrary; at him, (I say,) I do most admire; that he should cry
up the above mentioned philosophy after the manner that he does. I can assure
you, that I can bring you more than two, or twice two, (very credible persons)
that will


<pb n="173"/>


affirm, that they have heard him vindicate the above mentioned demonstration as
very reasonable.</p>


<p>Secondly, with respect to the confessours, (as they are improperly called,)
or such as confesse themselves to be witches, (the second thing you inquire into
in your letter), there are now about fifty of them in Prison; many of which I have
again and again seen and heard; and I cannot but tell you, that my faith is strong
concerning them, that they are deluded, imposed upon, and under the influence
of some evill spirit; and therefore unfitt to be evidences either against themselves,
or any one else. I now speak of one sort of them, and of others afterward.</p>


<p>These confessours, (as they are called,) do very often contradict
themselves, as inconsistently as is usual for any crazed, distempered person to do.
This the S. G. do see and take notice of; and even the Judges themselves have,
at some times, taken these confessours in flat lyes, or contradictions, even in the
Courts; By reason of which, one would have thought, that the Judges would have
frowned upon the said confessours, discarded them, and not minded one tittle of
any thing that they said; but instead thereof, (as sure as we are men,) the Judges
vindicate these confessours, and salve their contradictions, by proclaiming, that
the Devill takes away their memory, and imposes upon their brain. If this reflects
any where, I am very sorry for it: I can but assure you, that, upon the word of
an honest man, it is truth, and that I can bring you many credible persons to
witnesse it, who have been eye and ear wittnesses to these things.</p>


<p>These confessours then, at least some of them, even in the Judges' own
account, are under the influence of the Devill; and the brain of these Confessours
is imposed upon by the Devill, even in the Judges' account. But now, if, in the
Judges' account, these confessours are under the influence of the Devill, and their
brains are affected and imposed upon by the Devill, so that they are not their own
men, why then should these Judges, or any other men, make such account of, and
set so much by, the words of these Confessours, as they do? In short, I argue
thus:</p>


<p>If the Devill does actually take away the memory of them at some times,
certainly the Devill, at other times, may very


<pb n="174"/>


reasonably be thought to affect their fancyes, and to represent false ideas to their
imagination. But now, if it be thus granted, that the Devill is able to represent
false ideas (to speak vulgarly) to the imaginations of the confessours, what man
of sense will regard the confessions, or any of the words, of these
confessours?</p>


<p>The great cry of many of our neighbours now is, What, will you not
believe the confessours? Will you not believe men and women who confesse that
they have signed to the Devill's book? that they were baptized by the Devill; and
that they were at the mock-sacrament once and again? What! will you not believe
that this is witchcraft, and that such and such men are witches, altho' the
confessours do own and assert it?</p>


<p>Thus, I say, many of our good neighbours do argue; but methinks they
might soon be convinced that there is nothing at all in all these their arguings, if
they would but duly consider of the premises.</p>


<p>In the mean time, I think we must rest satisfyed in it, and be thankfull to
God for it, that all men are not thus bereft of their senses; but that we have here
and there considerate and thinking men, who will not thus be imposed upon, and
abused, by the subtle endeavours of the crafty one.</p>


<p>In the next place, I proceed to the form of their inditements, and the Trials
thereupon.</p>


<p>The Inditement runs for sorcery and witchcraft, acted upon the body of
such an one, (say M. Warren), at such a particular time, (say April 14, '92,) and
at divers other times before and after, whereby the said M. W. is wasted and
consumed, pined, etc.</p>


<p>Now for the proof of the said sorcery and witchcraft, the prisoner at the bar
pleading not guilty.</p>


<p>1. The afflicted persons are brought into Court; and after much patience
and pains taken with them, do take their oaths, that the prisoner at the bar did
afflict them: And here I think it very observable, that often, when the afflicted
do mean and intend only the appearance and shape of such an one, (say G.
Proctour) yet they positively swear that G. Proctour did afflict them; and they
have been allowed so to do; as tho' there was no real difference between G.
Proctour and the shape of G.

<pb n="175"/>




Proctour. This, methinks, may readily prove a stumbling block to the Jury, lead
them into a very fundamental errour, and occasion innocent blood, yea the
innocentest blood imaginable, to be in great danger. Whom it belongs unto, to be
eyes unto the blind, and to remove such stumbling blocks, I know full well; and
yet you and every one else, do know as well as I who do not.<ref target="n50">[50]</ref></p>


<p>2. The confessours do declare what they know of the said prisoner; and
some of the confessours are allowed to give their oaths; a thing which I believe
was never heard of in this world; that such as confesse themselves to be witches,
to have renounced God and Christ, and all that is sacred, should yet be allowed
and ordered to swear by the name of the great God! This indeed seemeth to me
to be a grosse taking of God's name in vain. I know the S. G. do say, that there
is hopes that the said Confessours have repented; I shall only say, that if they
have repented, it is well for themselves; but if they have not, it is very ill for you
know who. But then,</p>


<p>3. Whoever can be an evidence against the prisoner at the bar is ordered
to come into Court; and here it scarce ever fails but that evidences, of one nature
and another, are brought in, tho', I think, all of them altogether aliene to the
matter of inditement; for they none of them do respect witchcraft upon the bodyes
of the afflicted, which is the alone matter of charge in the inditement.</p>


<p>4. They are searched by a Jury; and as to some of them, the Jury brought
in, that [on] such or such a place there was a preternatural excrescence. And I
wonder what person there is, whether man or woman, of whom it cannot be said
but that, in some part of their body or other, there is a preternatural excrescence.
The term is a very general and inclusive term.</p>


<p>Some of the S. G. are very forward to censure and condemn the poor
prisoner at the bar, because he sheds no tears: but such betray great ignorance in
the nature of passion, and as great heedlessnesse as to common passages of a
man's life. Some there are who never shed tears; others there are that ordinarily
shed tears upon light occasions, and yet for their lives cannot shed a tear when
the deepest sorrow is upon their hearts; and who is there that knows not these
things? Who

<pb n="176"/>




knows not that an ecstasye of Joy will sometimes fetch teares, when as the quite
contrary passion will shutt them close up? Why then should any be so silly and
foolish as to take an argument from this appearance? But this is by the by. In
short, the prisoner at the bar is indited for sorcery and witchcraft acted upon the
bodyes of the afflicted. Now, for the proof of this, I reckon that the only
pertinent evidences brought in are the evidences of the said afflicted.</p>


<p>It is true, that over and above the evidences of the afflicted persons, there
are many evidences brought in, against the prisoner at the bar; either that he was
at a witch meeting, or that he performed things which could not be done by an
ordinary natural power; or that she sold butter to a saylor, which proving bad at
sea, and the seamen exclaiming against her, she appeared, and soon after there
was a storm, or the like. But what if there were ten thousand evidences of this
nature; how do they prove the matter of inditement! And if they do not reach the
matter of inditement, then I think it is clear, that the prisoner at the bar is brought
in guilty, and condemned, merely from the evidences of the afflicted
persons.</p>


<p>The S. G. will by no means allow, that any are brought in guilty, and
condemned, by virtue of spectre Evidence, (as it is called,) <hi
rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the evidence of these afflicted persons, who are said
to have spectral eyes; but whether it is not purely by virtue of these spectre
evidences, that these persons are found guilty, (considering what before has been
said,) I leave you, and any man of sense, to judge and determine. When any man
is indited for murthering the person of A. B. and all the direct evidence be, that
the said man pistolled the shadow of the said A. B. tho' there be never so many
evidences that the said person murthered C. D., E. F. and ten more persons, yet
all this will not amount to a legal proof, that he murthered A. B.; and upon that
inditement, the person cannot be legally brought in guilty of the said inditement;
it must be upon this supposition, that the evidence of a man's pistolling the
shadow of A. B. is a legal evidence to prove that the said man did murther the
person of A. B. Now no man will be so much out of his witts as to make this a
legal evidence; and yet this seems to be our case; and how to apply it is very easy
and obvious.</p>


<pb n="177"/>


<p>As to the late executions,<ref target="n51">[51]</ref> I shall only tell you, that in the opinion of many
unprejudiced, considerate and considerable spectatours, some of the condemned
went out of the world not only with as great protestations, but also with as good
shews of innocency, as men could do.</p>


<p>They protested their innocency as in the presence of the great God, whom
forthwith they were to appear before: they wished, and declared their wish, that
their blood might be the last innocent blood shed upon that account. With great
affection<ref target="n52">[52]</ref> they intreated Mr. C. M.<ref target="n53">[53]</ref> to pray with them: they prayed that God
would discover what witchcrafts were among us; they forgave their accusers; they
spake without reflection on Jury and Judges, for bringing them in guilty, and
condemning them: they prayed earnestly for pardon for all other sins, and for an
interest in the pretious blood of our dear Redeemer; and seemed to be very
sincere, upright, and sensible of their circumstances on all accounts; especially
Proctor and Willard, whose whole management of themselves, from the Goal to
the Gallows, and whilst at the Gallows, was very affecting and melting to the
hearts of some considerable Spectatours, whom I could mention to
you: &mdash; but they are executed, and so I leave them.</p>


<p>Many things I cannot but admire and wonder at, an account of which I shall
here send you.</p>


<p>And 1. I do admire that some particular persons, and particularly Mrs.
Thatcher of Boston,<ref target="n54">[54]</ref> should be much complained of by the afflicted persons, and
yet that the Justices should never issue out their warrants to apprehend them,

<pb n="178"/>




when as upon the same account they issue out their warrants for the apprehending
and imprisoning many others.</p>


<p>This occasions much discourse and many hot words, and is a very great
scandal and stumbling block to many good people; certainly distributive Justice
should have its course, without respect to persons; and altho' the said Mrs.
Thatcher be mother in law to Mr. Corwin,<ref target="n55">[55]</ref> who is one of the Justices and
Judges, yet if Justice and conscience do oblige them to apprehend others on the
account of the afflicted their complaints, I cannot see how, without injustice and
violence to conscience, Mrs. Thatcher can escape, when it is well known how
much she is, and has been, complained of.</p>


<p>2. I cannot but admire that Mr. H. U.<ref target="n56">[56]</ref> (whom we all think innocent,)
should yet be apprehended on this account, and ordered to prison, by a mittimus
under Mr. Lynd's<ref target="n57">[57]</ref> his hand, and yet that he should be suffered, for above a
fortnight, to be in a private house; and after that, to quitt the house, the town,
and the Province, and yet that authority should not take effectual notice of it.
Methinks that same Justice, that actually imprisoned others, and refused bail for
them on any terms, should not be satisfyed without actually imprisoning Mr. U.
and refusing bail for him, when his case is known to be the very same with the
case of those others.</p>


<p>If he may be suffered to go away, why may not others? If others may not
be suffered to go, how in Justice can he be allowed herein?</p>


<p>3. If our Justices do think that Mrs. C.<ref target="n58">[58]</ref> Mr. E.<ref target="n59">[59]</ref> and his
wife, Mr. A.<ref target="n60">[60]</ref>
and others, were capital offenders, and justly imprisoned on a capital account, I
do admire that the said Justices should hear of their escape from prison, and
where they are gone and entertained, and yet not send forthwith to the said
places,<ref target="n61">[61]</ref> for the surrendering of them, that Justice might be done them. In other
Capitalls<ref target="n62">[62]</ref> this has been practised;

<pb n="179"/>




why then is it not practised in this case, if really judged to be so heinous
as is made for?</p>


<p>4. I cannot but admire, that any should go with their distempered friends
and relations to the afflicted children, to know what their distempered friends ayl;
whether they are not bewitched; who it is that afflicts them, and the like. It is
true, I know no reason why these afflicted may not be consulted as well as any
other, if so be that it was only their natural and ordinary knowledge that was had
recourse to: but it is not on this notion that these afflicted children are sought
unto; but as they have a supernatural knowledge; a knowledge which they obtain
by their holding correspondence with spectres or evill spirits, as they themselves
grant. This consulting of these afflicted children, as abovesaid, seems to me to
be a very grosse evill, a real abomination, not fitt to be known in N.
E.<ref target="n63">[63]</ref> and yet
is a thing practised, not only by Tom and John &mdash; I mean the ruder and
more ignorant sort &mdash; but by many who professe high, and passe among us
for some of the better sort. This is that which aggravates the evil, and makes it
heinous and tremendous; and yet this is not the worst of it, for, as sure as I now
write to you, even some of our civil leaders, and spiritual teachers, who, (I
think,) should punish and preach down such sorcery and wickedness, do yet allow
of, encourage, yea, and practise this very abomination.</p>


<p>I know there are several worthy Gentlemen in Salem, who account this
practise as an abomination, have trembled to see the methods of this nature which
others have used, and have declared themselves to think the practise to be very
evill and corrupt; but all avails little with the abettours of the said practice.</p>


<p>A person from Boston, of no small note, carried up his child to Salem,
(near 20 miles,) on purpose that he might consult the afflicted about his child;
which accordingly he did; and the afflicted told him, that his child was afflicted
by Mrs. Cary and Mrs. Obinson.<ref target="n64">[64]</ref> The man returned to Boston, and went
forthwith to the Justices for a warrant to seise the said

<pb n="180"/>




Obinson, (the said Cary being out of the way); but the Boston Justices saw reason
to deny a warrant. The Rev. Mr. I. M.<ref target="n65">[65]</ref> of Boston, took occasion severely to
reprove the said man; asking him whether there was not a God in Boston, that he
should go to the Devill in Salem for advice; warning him very seriously against
such naughty practices; which, I hope, proved to the conviction and good of the
said person; if not, his blood will be upon his own head.</p>


<p>This consulting of these afflicted children, about their sick, was the
unhappy begining of the unhappy troubles at poor Andover: Horse and man were
sent up to Salem Village, from the said Andover, for some of the said afflicted;
and more than one or two of them were carried down to see Ballard's
wife,<ref target="n66">[66]</ref> and
to tell who it was that did afflict her. I understand that the said B. took advice
before he took this method; but what pity was it, that he should meet with, and
hearken to such bad Counsellours? Poor Andover does now rue the day that ever
the said afflicted went among them; they lament their folly, and are an object of
great pity and commiseration. Capt. B.<ref target="n67">[67]</ref>
and Mr. St.<ref target="n68">[68]</ref> are complained of by the
afflicted, have left the town, and do abscond. Deacon Fry's wife, Capt'n
Osgood's wife, and some others, remarkably pious and good people in repute, are
apprehended and imprisoned; and that that is more admirable, the forementioned
women are become a kind of confessours, being first brought thereto by the
urgings and arguings of their good husbands, who, having taken up that corrupt
and highly pernicious opinion, that whoever were accused by the afflicted, were
guilty, did break charity with their dear wives, upon their being accused, and
urge them to confesse their guilt; which so far prevailed with them as to make
them say, they were afraid of their being in the snare of the Devill; and which,
through the rude and bar

<pb n="181"/>




barous methods<ref target="n1">[*]</ref> that were afterwards used at Salem, issued in somewhat plainer
degrees of confession, and was attended with imprisonment. The good Deacon
and Captain are now sensible of the errour they were in; do grieve and mourn
bitterly, that they should break their charity with their wives, and urge them to
confesse themselves witches. They now see and acknowledge their rashnesse and
uncharitablenesse, and are very fitt objects for the pity and prayers of every good
Christian. Now I am writing concerning Andover, I cannot omit the opportunity
of sending you this information; that Whereas there is a report spread abroad the
country, how that they were much addicted to Sorcery in the said town, and that
there were fourty men in it that could raise the Devill as well as any astrologer,
and the like; after the best search that I can make into it, it proves a mere
slander, and a very unrighteous imputation.</p>


<p>The Rev'd Elders of the said place were much surprized upon their hearing
of the said Report, and faithfully made inquiry about it; but the whole of
naughtiness, that they could discover and find out, was only this, that two or
three girls had foolishly made use of the sieve and scissors,<ref target="n70">[70]</ref> as children have
done in other towns. This method of the girls I do not Justifye in any measure;
but yet I think it very hard and unreasonable, that a town should lye under the
blemish and

<pb n="182"/>




scandal of sorceryes and conjuration, merely for the inconsiderate practices of
two or three girls in the said town.</p>


<p>5. I cannot but admire that the Justices, whom I think to be well-meaning
men, should so far give ear to the Devill, as merely upon his authority to issue
out their warrants, and apprehend people. Liberty was evermore accounted the
great priviledge of an Englishman; but certainly, if the Devill will be heard
against us, and his testimony taken, to the siezing and apprehending of us, our
liberty vanishes, and we are fools if we boast of our liberty. Now, that the
Justices have thus far given ear to the Devill, I think may be mathematically
demonstrated to any man of common sense: And for the demonstration and proof
hereof, I desire, only, that these two things may be duly considered, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>


<p>1. That several persons have been apprehended purely upon the complaints
of these afflicted, to whom the afflicted were perfect strangers, and had not the
least knowledge of imaginable, before they were apprehended.</p>


<p>2. That the afflicted do own and assert, and the Justices do grant, that the
Devill does inform and tell the afflicted the names of those persons that are thus
unknown unto them. Now these two things being duly considered, I think it will
appear evident to any one, that the Devill's information is the fundamental
testimony that is gone upon in the apprehending of the aforesaid people.</p>


<p>If I believe such or such an assertion as comes immediately from the
Minister of God in the pulpitt, because it is the word of the everliving God, I
build my faith on God's testimony: and if I practise upon it, this my practice is
properly built on the word of God: even so in the case before us,</p>


<p>If I believe the afflicted persons as informed by the Devill, and act
thereupon, this my act may properly be said to be grounded upon the testimony
or information of the Devill. And now, if things are thus, I think it ought to be
for a lamentation to you and me, and all such as would be accounted good
Christians.</p>


<p>If any should see the force of this argument, and upon it say, (as I heard
a wise and good Judge once propose,) that they know not but that God almighty,
or a good spirit, does give this information to these afflicted persons; I make
answer

<pb n="183"/>




thereto, and say, that it is most certain that it is neither almighty God, nor yet
any good Spirit, that gives this information; and my Reason is good, because God
is a God of truth; and the good Spirits will not lye; whereas these informations
have several times proved false, when the accused were brought before the
afflicted.</p>


<p>6. I cannot but admire that these afflicted persons should be so much
countenanced and encouraged in their accusations as they are: I often think of the
Groton woman, that was afflicted, an account of which we have in print, and is
a most certain truth, not to be doubted of.<ref target="n71">[71]</ref> I shall only say, that there was as
much ground, in the hour of it, to countenance the said Groton woman, and to
apprehend and imprison, on her accusations, as there is now to countenance these
afflicted persons, and to apprehend and imprison on their accusations. But
furthermore, it is worthy of our deepest consideration, that in the conclusion,
(after multitudes have been imprisoned, and many have been put to death,) these
afflicted persons should own that all was a mere fancy and delusion of the
Devill's, as the Groton woman did own and acknowledge with respect to herself;
if, I say, in after times, this be acknowledged by them, how can the Justices,
Judges, or any else concerned in these matters, look back upon these things
without the greatest of sorrow and grief imaginable? I confesse to you, it makes
me tremble when I seriously consider of this thing. I have heard that the chief
judge<ref target="n72">[72]</ref> has expressed himself very hardly of the accused woman at Groton, as
tho' he believed her to be a witch to this day; but by such as knew the said
woman, this is judged a very uncharitable opinion of the

<pb n="184"/>




said Judge, and I do not understand that any are proselyted thereto.</p>


<p>Rev'd Sir, these things I cannot but admire and wonder at. Now, if so be
it is the effect of my dullness that I thus admire, I hope you will pity, not censure
me: but if, on the contrary, these things are just matter of admiration, I know that
you will join with me in expressing your admiration hereat.</p>


<p>The chief Judge is very zealous in these proceedings, and says, he is very
clear as to all that hath as yet been acted by this Court, and, as far as ever I
could perceive, is very impatient in hearing any thing that looks another way. I
very highly honour and reverence the wisdome and integrity of the said Judge,
and hope that this matter shall not diminish my veneration for his honour;
however, I cannot but say, my great fear is, that wisdome and counsell are
withheld from his honour as to this matter, which yet I look upon not so much
as a Judgment to his honour as to this poor land.</p>


<p>But altho' the Chief Judge, and some of the other Judges, be very zealous
in these proceedings, yet this you may take for a truth, that there are several
about the Bay, men for understanding, Judgment, and Piety, inferiour to few, (if
any,) in N. E. that do utterly condemn the said proceedings, and do freely deliver
their Judgment in the case to be this, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> that these
methods will utterly ruine and undoe poor N. E. I shall nominate some of these
to you, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> The hon'ble Simon Bradstreet, Esq.
(our late Governor); the hon'ble Thomas Danforth, Esq. (our late Deputy
Governor); the Rev'd Mr. Increase Mather, and the Rev'd Mr. Samuel Willard.
Major N. Saltonstall, Esq. who was one of the Judges, has left the Court, and is
very much dissatisfyed with the proceedings of it. Excepting Mr. Hale, Mr.
Noyes, and Mr. Parris, the Rev'd Elders, almost throughout the whole Country,
are very much dissatisfyed. Several of the late Justices, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> Thomas Graves, Esq. N. Byfield, Esq. Francis
Foxcroft, Esq. are much dissatisfyed; also several of the present Justices; and in
particular, some of the Boston Justices, were resolved rather to throw up their
commissions than be active in disturbing the liberty of their Majesties' subjects,
merely on the accusations of these afflicted, possessed children.</p>


<pb n="185"/>


<p>Finally; the principal Gentlemen in Boston, and thereabout, are generally
agreed that irregular and dangerous methods have been taken as to these
matters.</p>


<p>Sir, I would not willingly lead you into any errour, and therefore would
desire you to note,</p>


<p>1. That when I call these afflicted &ldquo;the afflicted children,&rdquo; I
would not be understood as though I meant, that all that are afflicted are <hi
rend="italic">children</hi>: there are several young men and women that
are afflicted, as well as children: but this term has most prevailed among us,
because of the younger sort that were first afflicted, and therefore I make use of
it.</p>


<p>2. That when I speak of the Salem Gentlemen, I would not be understood
as tho' I meant every Individual Gentleman in Salem; nor yet as tho' I meant,
that there were no men but in Salem that run upon these notions: some term they
must have, and this seems not improper, because in Salem this sort of Gentlemen
does most abound.</p>


<p>3. That other Justices in the Country, besides the Salem Justices, have
issued out their warrants, and imprisoned, on the accusations of the afflicted as
aforesaid; and therefore, when I speak of the Salem Justices, I do not mean them
exclusively.</p>


<p>4. That as to the above mentioned Judges, that are commissionated for this
Court at Salem, five of them do belong to Suffolk county; four of which five do
belong to Boston;<ref target="n73">[73]</ref> and therefore I see no reason why Boston should talk of
Salem, as tho' their own Judges had had no hand in these proceedings at
Salem.</p>


<p>Nineteen persons have now been executed, and one pressed to death for a

Bradbury of Salisbury, from the intercession of some friends; and two or three
more, because they are confessours.<ref target="n74">[74]</ref></p>


<p>The Court is adjourned to the first Tuesday in November, then to be kept

great assembly,<ref target="n75">[75]</ref> and this matter will be a peculiar matter of their agitation. I
think it is matter of earnest supplication and prayer to almighty God, that he
would afford his gracious presence to the said assembly, and direct them aright
in this weighty matter. Our hopes are here; and if, at this Juncture, God does not
graciously appear for us, I think we may conclude that N. E. is undone and
undone.</p>


<p>I am very sensible, that it is irksome and disagreeable to go back, when a
man's doing so is an implication that he has been walking in a wrong path:
however, nothing is more honourable than, upon due conviction, to retract and
undo, (so far as may be,) what has been amiss and irregular.</p>


<p>I would hope that, in the conclusion, both the Judges and Justices will see
and acknowledge that such were their best friends and advisers as disswaded from
the methods which they have taken, tho' hitherto they have been angry with them,
and apt to speak very hardly of them.</p>


<p>I cannot but highly applaud, and think it our duty to be very thankfull, for
the endeavours of several Elders,<ref target="n76">[76]</ref> whose lips, (I think,) should preserve
knowledge, and whose counsell should, I think, have been more regarded, in a
case of this nature, than as yet it has been: in particular, I cannot but think very
honourably of the endeavours of a Rev'd person in Boston,<ref target="n77">[77]</ref> whose good affection
to his countrey in general,

<pb n="187"/>




and spiritual relation to three of the Judges in particular, has made him very
solicitous and industrious in this matter; and I am fully persuaded, that had his
notions and proposals been hearkened to, and followed, when these troubles were
in their birth, in an ordinary way, they would never have grown unto that heigth
which now they have. He has as yet mett with little but unkindness, abuse, and
reproach from many men; but I trust that, in after times, his wisdome and service
will find a more universal acknowledgment; and if not, his reward is with the
Lord.</p>


<p>Two or three things I should have hinted to you before, but they slipped my
thoughts in their proper place.</p>


<p>Many of these afflicted persons, who have scores of strange fitts in a day,
yet in the intervals of time are hale and hearty, robust and lusty, as tho' nothing
had afflicted them. I Remember that when the chief Judge gave the first Jury their
charge, he told them, that they were not to mind whether the bodies of the said
afflicted were really pined and consumed, as was expressed in the inditement; but
whether the said afflicted did not suffer from the accused such afflictions as
naturally

<pb n="188"/>




<hi rend="italic">tended</hi> to their being pined and consumed, wasted,
etc. This, (said he,) is a pining and consuming in the sense of the law. I add
not.</p>


<p>Furthermore: These afflicted persons do say, and often have declared it,
that they can see Spectres when their eyes are shutt, as well as when they are
open. This one thing I evermore accounted as very observable, and that which
might serve as a good key to unlock the nature of these mysterious troubles, if
duly improved by us. Can they see Spectres when their eyes are shutt? I am sure
they lye, at least speak falsely, if they say so; for the thing, in nature, is an utter
impossibility. It is true, they may strongly fancye, or have things represented to
their imagination, when their eyes are shutt; and I think this is all which ought
to be allowed to these blind, nonsensical girls; and if our officers and Courts have
apprehended, imprisoned, condemned, and executed our guiltlesse neighbours,
certainly our errour is great, and we shall rue it in the conclusion. There are two
or three other things that I have observed in and by these afflicted persons, which
make me strongly suspect that the Devill imposes upon their brains, and deludes
their fancye and imagination; and that

<pb n="189"/>




the Devill's book (which they say has been offered them) is a mere fancye of
theirs, and no reality: That the witches' meeting, the Devill's Baptism, and mock
sacraments, which they oft speak of, are nothing else but the effect of their
fancye, depraved and deluded by the Devill, and not a Reality to be regarded or
minded by any wise man. And whereas the Confessours have owned and asserted
the said meetings, the said Baptism, and mock Sacrament, (which the S. G. and
some others, make much account of) I am very apt to think, that, did you know
the circumstances of the said Confessours, you would not be swayed thereby, any
otherwise than to be confirmed, that all is perfect Devilism, and an Hellish design
to ruine and destroy this poor land: For whereas there are of the said Confessours
55 in number, some of them are known to be distracted, crazed women,
something of which you may see by a petition lately offered to the chief Judge,
a copy whereof I may now send you;<ref target="n78">[78]</ref> others of them denyed their guilt, and
maintained their innocency for above eighteen hours, after most violent,
distracting, and draggooning<ref target="n79">[79]</ref> methods had been used with them, to make them
confesse. Such methods they were, that more than one of the said confessours did
since tell many, with teares in their eyes, that they thought their very lives would
have gone out of their bodyes; and wished that they might have been cast into the
lowest dungeon, rather than be tortured with such repeated buzzings and
chuckings and unreasonable urgings as they were treated withal.</p>


<p>They soon recanted their confessions, acknowledging, with sorrow and
grief, that it was an hour of great temptation with them; and I am very apt to
think, that as for five or six of the said confessours, if they are not very good
Christian women, it will be no easy matter to find so many good Christian
women in N. E. But, finally, as to about thirty of these fiftyfive Confessours,
they are possessed (I reckon) with the Devill, and afflicted as the children are,
and therefore not fitt to be regarded as to any thing they say of themselves or
others. And whereas the S. G. do say that these confessours made

<pb n="190"/>




their Confessions before they were afflicted, it is absolutely contrary to universal
experience, as far as ever I could understand. It is true, that some of these have
made their confession before they had their falling, tumbling fitts, but yet not
absolutely before they had any fitts and marks of possession, for (as the S. G.
know full well) when these persons were about first confessing, their mouths
would be stopped, and their throats affected, as tho' there was danger of
strangling, and afterward (it is true) came their tumbling fitts. So that, I say, the
confessions of these persons were in the beginning of their fitts, and not truly
before their fitts, as the S. G. would make us believe.</p>


<p>Thus, (Sir,) I have given you as full a narrative of these matters as readily
occurs to my mind, and I think every word of it is matter of fact; the several
glosses and descants whereupon, by way of Reasoning, I refer to your Judgment,
whether to approve or disapprove.</p>


<p>What will be the issue of these troubles, God only knows; I am afraid that
ages will not wear off that reproach and those stains which these things will leave
behind them upon our land. I pray God pity us, Humble us, Forgive us, and
appear mercifully for us in this our mount of distress: Herewith I conclude, and
subscribe myself,</p>

New England, and there, though counted an able preacher, declined a settlement
and drifted into public life. He seems to have set store by his learning in
theology, and to the end to have maintained the Devil's impotence to personate
by a spectre any but a guilty witch. As to his career see the careful study by

[we] may be led in the right way as to the Witchcrafts. The season and manner
of doing it, is such, that the Court of Oyer and Terminer count themselves
thereby dismissed. 29 Nos and 33 yeas to the Bill.&rdquo; The bill itself has
been printed (from the Mass. Archives, XI. 70) by G. H. Moore, in the
<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the American Antiquarian Society (n. s.,
II. 172); and that those of Brattle's mind had not relied alone on prayer to
influence the assembly may be seen by the petition printed in the
<hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>, XXVII. 55, and in the
<hi rend="italic">Proceedings </hi> of the American Antiquarian Society, n. s., V. 246 (see also

<note id="n77"><seg type="note-symbol">[77].</seg> <p>It has been generally assumed, and with reason, that this &ldquo;Rev'd
person&rdquo; was the Rev. Samuel Willard. Three of the judges (Sargent,
Sewall, and Winthrop) were members of his church (the Old South), and, unless
one suspect Brattle of intent to mislead, &ldquo;spiritual relation&rdquo; must
here mean a pastor's. The phrase &ldquo;good affection to the country&rdquo;
suggests, too, one who, like Willard, shared Brattle's political views. We have
seen already (p. 23) what caution in 1671 he used in the case of Elizabeth Knapp;
and, if the &ldquo;notions and proposals&rdquo; meant by Brattle are now lost,
we have from his pen what puts his position in 1692 beyond all
question &mdash; a little dialogue, published anonymously while the troubles were
at their height, which with fairness and courtesy, but with striking clearness and
boldness, argues against the iniquity of the procedure. Its title runs: <hi rend="italic">Some Miscellany Observations on our Present Debates respecting
Witchcrafts, in a Dialogue between S. and B. By P. E. and J. A. Philadelphia,
Printed by William Bradford, for Hezekiah Usher</hi>. 1692.
&ldquo;S.&rdquo; and &ldquo;B.&rdquo; undoubtedly mean Salem and Boston.
Philadelphia and Bradford probably had as little to do with the book (the type is
not Bradford's) as did Hezekiah Usher, P. E. (Philip English), or J. A. (John
Alden), three notable fugitives from Salem justice. All alike were merely remote
enough to bear in safety the imputation of such a book. John Alden and Hezekiah
Usher were members of Willard's church; and Philip English and his wife he
visited while in custody at Boston, and probably was a party to their escape. At
least the Rev. William Bentley, of Salem, recording in his diary, May 21, 1793,
what their great-granddaughter Susanna Hathorne had told him, relates that
Willard and Moodey &ldquo;visited them and invited them to the public worship
on the day before they were to return to Salem for trial. Their text was that they
that are persecuted in one city, let them flee to another. After Meeting the
Ministers visited them at the Gaol, and asked them whether they took notice of
the discourse, and told them their danger and urged them to escape since so many
had suffered. Mr. English replied, `God will not permit them to touch me.' Mrs.
English said: `Do you not think the sufferers innocent?' He (Moody) said `Yes.'
She then added, `Why may we not suffer also?' The Ministers then told him if
he would not carry his wife away they would.&rdquo; (Quoted by R. D. Paine,
in his <hi rend="italic">Ships and Sailors of Old Salem</hi>, from
Bentley's privately printed diary, which seems to give the tale in a more primitive
form than his letter to Alden, in the Mass. Hist. Soc., <hi
rend="italic">Collections</hi>, X.) &ldquo;It ought never to be
forgotten,&rdquo; said Willard's colleague, Ebenezer Pemberton, preaching in
1707 his funeral sermon, &ldquo;with what Prudence, Courage and Zeal he
appeared for the Good of this People in that Dark and Mysterious Season when
we were assaulted from the Invisible World. And how singularly Instrumental he
was in discovering the Cheats and Delusions of Satan, which did threaten to stain
our Land with Blood and to deluge it with all manner of Woes.&rdquo; True,
Judge Sewall, mentioning in 1696 (<hi rend="italic">Diary</hi>, I. 433)
Willard's sermon at the day of public prayer, says that he spake smartly
&ldquo;at last&rdquo; about the Salem witchcraft; but &ldquo;at last&rdquo;
here means &ldquo;at the end,&rdquo; &ldquo;as the peroration of his
sermon.&rdquo; It is clearly Willard whom Cotton Mather has especially in mind
when in his life of Phips and again in his <hi rend="italic">Magnalia</hi>
(bk. II., p. 62) he sets forth the views of those &ldquo;who from the beginning
were very much dissatisfied with these proceedings,&rdquo; having
&ldquo;already known of one at the Town of Groton&rdquo; who had falsely
accused a neighbor. The strange suggestion of W. F. Poole that Brattle here
means Cotton Mather himself, is adequately answered by Upham, in his <hi

<head>LETTERS OF GOVERNOR PHIPS TO THE HOME GOVERNMENT, 1692-1693</head>

<pb n="193"/>

<div2 type="introduction" id="d24">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Sir William Phips</hi>, who arrived in May as
the royal governor under the new charter, was no stranger to New England. Born
in 1651 at a hamlet on the Maine coast, just beyond the Kennebec, where his
father, a Bristol gunsmith, had become a settler, he had early turned from
sheep-herding to ship-carpentry, and then coming up to Boston, where at
twenty-two he first learned to read and write, he had by thrift become the master
of a vessel and had found a path to fortune in the rescue of lost treasure from
Spanish galleons sunken in West Indian waters. These ventures had brought him
into partnership with some of the most powerful of English nobles, and even with
royalty itself, and his sturdy honesty (or perhaps a wise use of his wealth) won
him from the King in 1687 the honor of knighthood and in 1688 appointment as
high sheriff of New England. The hostility of Governor Andros brought the
sheriffship to nothing; but the English revolution overturned Andros in 1689, and
the emancipated colonies made Sir William head of the expedition that conquered
Nova Scotia, and then sent him with another against Quebec. Meanwhile
President Increase Mather was laboring in England, as the agent of
Massachusetts, for the restoration of the ancient charter; and when Sir William
(who during his absence had, as his son's convert, become a member of his
church) turned up there too, and just in time to support him against the other New
England commissioners in accepting from the King what could be got, though not
what could be wished, he was the natural nominee for the new
governorship.</p>


<p>But the new governor was little trained for such an emergency

<pb n="194"/>

as awaited him in New England. What more natural in such a crisis, which
to the thought of that day seemed to need the divine more than the statesman,
than to turn for counsel to his pastor and patron, or to his colleague the new
lieutenant-governor,<ref target="n80">[80]</ref> who had enjoyed precisely that training in theology which
seemed now his own chief lack? Stoughton was made chief justice of a special
court created by the governor to try the witch-cases,<ref target="n81">[81]</ref> and during the latter's
repeated absences<ref target="n82">[82]</ref> at the frontier became the acting governor. The ministers of
Boston were &ldquo;consulted by his Excellency and the Honourable
Council&rdquo; as to the conduct of the trials. Their &ldquo;Return,&rdquo;
bearing date of June 15, was drawn by Cotton Mather;<ref target="n83">[83]</ref> and it was perhaps now
that that divine, who had early (May 31) furnished the judges a body of
instructions,<ref target="n84">[84]</ref> was inspired by &ldquo;the Direction of His Excellency the
Governor&rdquo;<ref target="n85">[85]</ref> to undertake that &ldquo;Account of the Sufferings brought

<pb n="195"/>

upon the Countrey by Witchcraft,&rdquo; which was ready for submission to Sir
William on his return from the east in early October, and with which, under its
title of <hi rend="italic">The Wonders of the Invisible World</hi>, we
must soon make acquaintance. The opening clauses of the governor's letter show
plainly the influence of that book;<ref target="n86">[86]</ref> and the change in tone between its earlier and
its later portion, and yet more between the letter of October and that of February,
is not the least interesting feature of these documents.<ref target="n87">[87]</ref></p>

of course also a nominee of Mather's. He had not been forward in the revolution
which overthrew the Andros government, but he had rallied to it, and Cotton
Mather had written his father wishing he might &ldquo;do anything to restore
him to the favor of the country.&rdquo;</p></note>

appended to Increase Mather's <hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>
(1693) and has been often reprinted, both with that work and in later books. It is
Cotton Mather himself (in his life of Phips) who tells us that he drafted it.</p></note>

court (<hi rend="italic">Mather Papers</hi>, pp. 391-397). It is
endorsed &mdash; with reason &mdash; &ldquo;Mr Cotton Mather, an Essay
concerning Witchcraft&rdquo;; for an essay it really is. A supplement, and an
interesting one, is his letter of August 17 to John Foster, a member of the
Council (printed by Upham in his <hi rend="italic">Salem Witchcraft and
Cotton Mather</hi>, pp. 39-40).</p></note>

<note id="n85"><seg type="note-symbol">[85].</seg> <p>It has been questioned (by Upham and again by G. H. Moore) whether
&ldquo;the Governor&rdquo; whose &ldquo;commands&rdquo; Mather alleges
(see p. 206) may not be Stoughton instead of Phips; but his discrimination
between the two is too clear and too constant to admit the suspicion, and still less
can Stoughton and Sewall (see pp. 251, 378) have been inexact. A doubt as to
who consulted the clergy must be similarly answered. Yet Stoughton may well
have been behind both acts.</p></note>

<note id="n86"><seg type="note-symbol">[86].</seg> <p>His phrases are taken almost bodily from the book (see, in Drake's
edition, pp. 102-109, not here reprinted); and his statement as to the methods of
the court echoes Mather's. It has been suggested (by Moore) that Mather himself
drafted the letter; but neither the style nor the matter of its later portion can be

on October 5, and the answers, dated October 11, cannot have reached Boston
before the middle of that month. More distinctly than the Boston clergy they
reject &ldquo;spectral evidence.&rdquo; According to the Anglican rector at New
York, John Miller (commenting on Mather's statement as borrowed by the
geographer Hermann Moll), &ldquo;the advice of the established English Minister
was also asked and generously given&rdquo;; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he adds,
&ldquo;they were not so civill as to thank him for it, nor do they here

<head>LETTERS OF GOVERNOR PHIPS</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">When</hi> I first arrived I found this Province
miserably harrassed with a most Horrible witchcraft or Possession of Devills
which had broke in upon severall Townes, some scores of poor people were taken
with preternaturall torments some scalded with brimstone some had pins stuck in
their flesh others hurried into the fire and water and some dragged out of their
houses and carried over the tops of trees and hills for many Miles together; it
hath been represented to mee much like that of Sweden about thirty
years agoe,<ref target="n88">[88]</ref>
and there were many committed to prison upon suspicion of Witchcraft before my
arrivall. The loud cries and clamours of the friends of the afflicted people with
the advice of the Deputy Governor and many others prevailed with mee to give
a Commission of Oyer and Terminer for discovering what witchcraft might be at
the bottome or whether it were not a possession. The chief Judge in this
Commission was the Deputy Governour and the rest were persons of the best
prudence and figure that could then be pitched upon. When the Court came to sitt
at Salem in the County of Essex they convicted more than twenty persons of
being guilty of witchcraft, some of the convicted were such as confessed their
Guilt, the Court as I understand began their proceedings with the accusations of
the afflicted and then went upon other humane<ref target="n89">[89]</ref> evidences to strengthen that. I
was almost the whole time of the proceeding abroad in the service of Their
Majesties in the Eastern part of the Country and depended upon the Judgement
of the Court as to a right method of proceeding in cases of Witchcraft but when
I came home I found many persons in a strange ferment of dissatisfaction which
was increased by some hott Spiritts that blew up the flame,<ref target="n90">[90]</ref> but

<pb n="197"/>




on enquiring into the matter I found that the Devill had taken upon him the name
and shape of severall persons who were doubtless inocent and to my certain
knowledge of good reputation for which cause I have now forbidden the
committing of any more that shall be accused without unavoydable necessity, and
those that have been committed I would shelter from any Proceedings against
them wherein there may be the least suspition of any wrong to be done unto the
Innocent. I would also wait for any particular directions or commands if their
Majesties please to give mee any for the fuller ordering this perplexed affair. I
have also put a stop to the printing of any discourses one way or other, that may
increase the needless disputes of people upon this occasion, because I saw a
likely-hood of kindling an inextinguishable flame if I should admitt any publique
and open Contests and I have grieved to see that some who should have done
their Majesties and this Province better service have so far taken Councill of
Passion as to desire the precipitancy of these matters, these things have been
improved by some to give me many interuptions in their Majesties service and in
truth none of my vexations have been greater than this, than that their Majesties
service has been hereby unhappily clogged, and the Persons who have made soe
ill improvement of these matters here are seeking to turne it all upon
mee,<ref target="n91">[91]</ref> but
I hereby declare that as soon as I came from fighting against their Majesties
Enemyes and understood what danger some of their innocent subjects might be
exposed to, if the evidence of the afflicted persons only did prevaile either to the
committing or trying any of them, I did before

<pb n="198"/>




any application was made unto me about it put a stop to the proceedings of the
Court and they are now stopt till their Majesties pleasure be known. Sir I beg
pardon for giving you all this trouble, the reason is because I know my enemies
are seeking to turn it all upon me and I take this liberty because I depend upon
your friendship, and desire you will please to give a true understanding of the
matter if any thing of this kind be urged or made use of against mee. Because the
justnesse of my proceeding herein will bee a sufficient defence. Sir</p>

committed upon suspition of withcraft and that continuall complaints were made
to me that many persons were grievously tormented by witches and that they
cryed out upon severall persons by name, as the cause of their torments. The
number of these complaints increasing every day, by advice of the Lieut Govr.
and the Councill I gave a Commission of Oyer and Terminer to try the suspected
witches and at that time the generality of the People represented the matter to me
as reall witchcraft and gave very strange instances of the same. The first in
Commission was the Lieut. Govr. and the rest persons of the best prudence and
figure that could then be pitched upon and I depended upon the Court for a right
method of proceeding in cases of witchcraft. At that time I went to command the
army at the Eastern part of the Province, for the French and Indians had made
an attack upon some of our Fronteer Towns. I continued there for some time but
when I returned I found people much disatisfied at the proceedings of the Court,
for about Twenty persons were condemned and executed of which number some
were thought by many persons to be innocent. The Court still proceeded in the
same method of trying them, which was by the evidence of the afflicted persons
who when they were brought into the Court as soon as the suspected witches
looked upon them instantly fell to the ground in strange agonies and grievous
torments, but when touched by them upon the arme or some other part of their
flesh they immediately revived and came to themselves, upon [which] they made
oath that the Prisoner at the Bar did afflict them and that they saw their shape or
spectre come from their bodies which put them to such paines and torments:
When I enquired into the matter I was enformed by the Judges that they begun
with this, but had humane testimony against such as were condemned and
undoubted proof of their being witches, but at length I found that the Devill did
take upon him the shape of Innocent persons and some were accused of whose
innocency I was well assured and many considerable persons of unblameable life
and conversation were cried out upon as witches and wizards. The Deputy Govr.
notwithstanding persisted vigorously in the same method, to the great
disatisfaction and disturbance of the people, until I put an

<pb n="200"/>




end to the Court and stopped the proceedings, which I did because I saw many
innocent persons might otherwise perish and at that time I thought it my duty to
give an account thereof that their Ma'ties pleasure might be signifyed, hoping that
for the better ordering thereof the Judges learned in the law in England might
give such rules and directions as have been practized in England for proceedings
in so difficult and so nice a point; When I put an end to the
Court<ref target="n93">[93]</ref> there were
at least fifty persons in prison in great misery by reason of the extream cold and
their poverty, most of them having only spectre evidence against them, and their
mittimusses being defective, I caused some of them to be lett out upon bayle and
put the Judges upon considering of a way to reliefe others and prevent them from
perishing in prison, upon which some of them were convinced and acknowledged
that their former proceedings were too violent and not grounded upon a right
foundation but that if they might sit againe, they would proceed after another
method, and whereas Mr. Increase Mathew<ref target="n94">[94]</ref> and severall other Divines did give
it as their Judgment that the Devill might afflict in the shape of an innocent
person and that the look and the touch of the suspected persons was not sufficient
proofe against them, these things had not the same stress layd upon them as
before, and upon this consideration I permitted a spetiall Superior
Court<ref target="n95">[95]</ref> to be
held at Salem

<pb n="201"/>




in the County of Essex on the third day of January, the Lieut Govr. being Chief
Judge. Their method of proceeding being altered, all that were brought to tryall
to the number of fifety two, were cleared saving three, and I was enformed by
the Kings Attorny Generall that some of the cleared and the condemned were
under the same circumstances or that there was the same reason to clear the three
condemned as the rest according to his Judgment. The Deputy Govr. signed a
Warrant for their speedy execucion and also of five others who were condemned
at the former Court of Oyer and terminer, but considering how the matter had
been managed I sent a reprieve whereby the execucion was stopped untill their
Maj. pleasure be signified and declared. The Lieut. Gov. upon this occasion was
inranged and filled with passionate anger and refused to sitt upon the bench in a
Superior Court then held at Charles Towne,<ref target="n96">[96]</ref> and indeed hath from the beginning
hurried on these matters with great precipitancy and by his warrant hath caused
the estates, goods and chattles of the executed to be seized and disposed of
without my knowledge or consent. The stop put to the first method of proceedings
hath dissipated the blak cloud that threatened this Province with destruccion; for
whereas this delusion of the Devill did spread and its dismall effects touched the
lives and estates of many of their Ma'ties Subjects and the reputacion of some of
the principall persons here,<ref target="n97">[97]</ref> and indeed unhappily clogged and interrupted their

<head>FROM &ldquo;THE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE
WORLD,&rdquo; BY COTTON MATHER, 1693</head>


<pb n="205"/>

<div2 type="introduction" id="d31">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p>How <hi rend="italic">The Wonders of the Invisible World</hi>
came to be written we have already seen.<ref target="n99">[99]</ref> Its author had &ldquo;a talent for
sudden composures.&rdquo; We have seen what a scrap-bag was his
<hi rend="italic">Memorable Providences</hi>; and the pigeon-holes of his desk
must for months have been gathering materials that could now be put to use.
What these materials were is suggested by his title-page; but the title-page
description is not exact. There is first an essay, entitled &ldquo;Enchantments
Encountered,&rdquo; on New England as a home of the saints and the plot of the
Devil against her, especially as revealed by the witches now confessing; next an
abstract of the rules of Perkins, Gaule, and Bernard for the detection of witches.
Then follows &ldquo;A Discourse on the Wonders of the Invisible World, uttered
(in part) on Aug. 4, 1692.&rdquo; It is a sermon on Rev. xii. 12, depicting in
apocalyptic phrase the Devil's wrath and its present manifestation. Next comes
&ldquo;An Hortatory and Necessary Address, to a Country now extraordinarily
alarum'd by the Wrath of the Devil&rdquo; &mdash; this, too, doubtless written
for a sermon. &ldquo;Having thus discoursed on the Wonders of the Invisible
World,&rdquo; says then the author, &ldquo;I shall now, with God's help, go
on to relate some Remarkable and Memorable Instances of Wonders which that
World has given to ourselves.&rdquo; Yet he still inserts &ldquo;A Narrative of
an Apparition which a Gentleman in Boston had of his Brother,&rdquo; before
proceeding to those Salem trials, the kernel of his book, which are reprinted
below.</p>

<p>Doubtless these were meant, as the title-page suggests, to form a part of the
&ldquo;Enchantments Encountered,&rdquo; but failed

<pb n="206"/>

to arrive in time. Mather had long been begging them from Stephen Sewall
(brother of Judge Sewall), the clerk of the court; but the clerk was then very
busy. On September 20 Mather wrote: &ldquo;That I may be the more capable
to assist in lifting up a standard against the infernal enemy, I must renew my
most importunate request.&rdquo; What he asks is &ldquo;a narrative of the
evidence given in at the trials of half a dozen, or if you please, a dozen, of the
principal witches that have been condemned.&rdquo; He pleads not only Sewall's
promise, but that &ldquo;his Excellency, the Governor, laid his positive
commands upon me to desire this favor of you&rdquo;; &ldquo;and the truth
is,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;there are some of his circumstances with reference
to this affair, which I need not mention, that call for the expediting of your
kindness.&rdquo; He wants also some of the clerk's &ldquo;observations about
the confessors, and the credibility of what they assert, or about things evidently
preternatural in the witchcrafts&rdquo;; but, &ldquo;assure yourself,&rdquo; he
concludes, &ldquo;I shall not wittingly make what you write prejudicial to any
worthy design which those two excellent persons, Mr. Hale and Mr. Noyes, may
have in hand.&rdquo; But the clerk took counsel before he acted. His brother's
<hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> records, on Thursday, September 22, that
&ldquo;William Stoughton, Esqr., John Hathorne, Esqr., Mr. Cotton Mather,
and Capt. John Higginson, with my brother St., were at our house, speaking
about publishing some Trials of the Witches.&rdquo; These had been received
and utilized by early October (see p. 247), and the book, thus far complete, could
before October 11 be laid before the judges (see p. 251) and by the 12th could
furnish material for the governor's letter (see p. 195).</p>

<p>Before the book was out of press there was time to add the narrative of the
Swedish witches and the sermon on &ldquo;the Devil discovered&rdquo;; but
these could not seriously have delayed the printing, for the book, complete and
printed, must have gone to London by the same ship which in mid-October took

<pb n="207"/>

Sir William's letter. A copy of the book was doubtless sent, with this letter, to
the home government; and it was perhaps precisely for this use that the volume
had been hurried into existence and into print. What is certain is that such a copy
had before December 24 reached the hands of John Dunton, the London
publisher; for on that day he announced its speedy publication, and by December
29 it was already in print, though with &ldquo;1693&rdquo; on its
title-page.<ref target="n100">[100]</ref>
A &ldquo;second edition,&rdquo; much abridged (though not by the omission of
the Salem trials), he issued in February 1693, and reprinted it as a
&ldquo;third&rdquo; in June.</p>

<p>The news-letter, with imprint of 1692, calling itself <hi rend="italic">A
True Account of the Tryals... at Salem, in New England... in a Letter to a Friend
in London</hi> and signed at end &ldquo;C. M.&rdquo; is only a bookseller's
fraud, compiled from the <hi rend="italic">Wonders</hi> by some hack
(who has not even taken the trouble to imitate its style) and printed in
1693.</p>

<p>The <hi rend="italic">Wonders</hi> was reprinted at Salem in 1861
(with Calef's <hi rend="italic">More Wonders</hi>), by Mr. S. P. Fowler,
in a volume called <hi rend="italic">Salem Witchcraft</hi>; but, alas, from
the abridged &ldquo;third edition&rdquo; and with serious further abridgment.
In 1862 the first London edition was embodied in a volume of John Russell
Smith's <hi rend="italic">Library of Old Authors</hi> (<hi
rend="italic">cf.</hi> p. 149, note 1); and in 1866 the work was again
reprinted, and with much more exactness,<ref target="n101">[101]</ref> as

no. V. of the <hi rend="italic">Historical Series</hi> of W. Elliot
Woodward (Roxbury, Mass.), being again coupled with Calef's <hi
rend="italic">More Wonders</hi> (forming nos. VI., VII., of the same series) under a common title, <hi
rend="italic">The Witchcraft Delusion in New England</hi>, and a common
editor, S. G. Drake, who contributes elaborate introductions and notes. An
alleged reprint by J. Smith, London, 1834 (and again by H. Howell in 1840), as
an addition to Baxter's, <hi rend="italic">Certainty of the World of
Spirits</hi> is not Mather's <hi rend="italic">Wonders</hi> at all, but
only the witchcraft pages of his <hi rend="italic">Magnalia</hi>.</p>

<head>The Author's Defence.</head>

<p>'<hi rend="small-caps">Tis</hi>, as I remember, the Learned
Scribonius,<ref target="n104">[104]</ref> who Reports, that One of his Acquaintance, devoutly making his
Prayers on the behalf of a Person molested by Evil Spirits, received from those
Evil Spirits an horrible Blow over the Face: And I may my self Expect not few
or small Buffetings from Evil Spirits, for the Endeavours wherewith I am now
going to Encounter them. I am far from Insensible, That at this Extraordinary
Time of the Devils Coming down in Great Wrath upon us, there are too many
Tongues and Hearts thereby Set on Fire of Hell; that the various Opinions about
the Witchcrafts which of Later Time have Troubled us, are maintained by some
with so much Cloudy Fury, as if they could never be sufficiently Stated, unless
written in the Liquor wherewith Witches use to write their Covenants; and that
he who becomes an Author at such a Time, had need be Fenced with Iron, and
the Staff of a Spear. The unaccountable Frowardness, Asperity, Untreatableness,
and Inconsistency of many persons, every Day gives a Visible Exposition of that
passage, <hi rend="italic">An Evil Spirit from the Lord came upon
Saul</hi>; and Illustration of that Story, <hi rend="italic">There met him
two Possessed with Devils, exceeding Fierce, so that no man might pass by that
way</hi>. To send abroad a Book, among such Readers, were a very unadvised
Thing, if a man had not such Reasons to give, as I can bring, for such an
Undertaking. Briefly, I hope it cannot be said, They are all so; No, I hope the
Body of this People, are yet in such a Temper, as to be capable of Applying their
Thoughts, to make a Right Use of the Stupendous and prodigious Things that are
happening among us: and because I

<pb n="211"/>

was concern'd, when I saw that no Abler Hand Emitted any Essayes to Engage
the Minds of this People in such Holy, Pious, Fruitful Improvements, as God
would have to be made of His Amazing Dispensations now upon us, Therefore
it is, that One of the Least among the Children of New-England, has here done,
what is done. None, but the Father, who sees in Secret, knows the Heart-breaking
Exercises, wherewith I have Composed what is now going to be Exposed, Lest
I should in any One Thing miss of Doing my Designed Service for His Glory,
and for His People; But I am now somewhat comfortably Assured of His
favourable Acceptance; and, I will not Fear; what can a Satan do unto me!</p>

<p>Having Performed Something of what God Required, in labouring to suit
His Words unto His Works, at this Day among us, and therewithal handled a
Theme that has been sometimes counted not unworthy the Pen, even of a King,
it will easily be perceived, that some subordinate Ends have been considered in
these Endeavours.</p>

<p>I have indeed set my self to Countermine the whole Plot of the Devil
against New-England,<ref target="n105">[105]</ref> in every Branch of it, as far as one of my Darkness can
comprehend such a Work of Darkness. I may add, that I have herein also aimed
at the Information and Satisfaction of Good men in another Countrey, a Thousand
Leagues off, where I have, it may be, More, or however, more Considerable
Friends, than in My Own;<ref target="n106">[106]</ref> And I do what I can to have that Countrey, now as
well as alwayes, in the best Terms with My Own. But while I am

<pb n="212"/>

doing these things, I have been driven a little to do something likewise for My
self; I mean, by taking off the false Reports and hard Censures about my Opinion
in these matters, the Parters Portion, which my pursuit of Peace has procured me
among the Keen. My hitherto Unvaried Thoughts are here Published; and, I
believe, they will be owned by most of the Ministers of God in these Colonies;
nor can amends be well made me, for the wrong done me, by other sorts of
Representations.</p>


<p>In fine, For the Dogmatical part of my Discourse, I want no Defence; for
the Historical part of it, I have a very Great One. The Lieutenant-Governour of
New-England, having perused it, has done me the Honour of giving me a
Shield,<ref target="n107">[107]</ref> under the Umbrage whereof I now dare to walk Abroad.</p>

<p>I Live by Neighbours that force me to produce these Undeserved Lines. But
now, as when Mr. Wilson,<ref target="n108">[108]</ref> beholding a great Muster of Souldiers, had it by a
Gentleman then present said unto him, &ldquo;Sir, I'l tell you a great Thing:
here is a mighty Body of People; and there is not Seven of them all but what
Loves Mr. Wilson;&rdquo; that Gracious Man presently and pleasantly Reply'd,
&ldquo;Sir, I'll tell you as good a thing as that; here is a mighty Body of People,
and there is not so much as One among them all, but Mr. Wilson Loves
him.&rdquo; Somewhat so: 'Tis possible that among this Body of People there
may be few that Love the Writer of this Book; but give me leave to boast so far,
there is not one among all this Body of People, whom this Mather would not
Study to Serve, as well as to Love. With such a Spirit of Love, is the Book now
before us written: I appeal to all this World; and if this World will deny me the
Right of acknowledging so much, I Appeal to the Other, that it is Not written
with an Evil Spirit: for which cause I shall not wonder, if Evil Spirits be
Exasperated by what is Written, as the Sadducees doubtless were with what was
Discoursed in the Days of our Saviour. I only Demand the Justice, that others
Read it, with the same Spirit where-with I writ it.<ref target="n109">[109]</ref></p>


<p>But I shall no longer detain my Reader, from His expected entertainment,
in a Brief Account of the Trials which have passed upon some of the Malefactors
Lately Executed at Salem, for the Witchcrafts whereof they stood Convicted.

For my own part, I was not Present at any of Them;<ref target="n110">[110]</ref> nor ever Had I any
personal prejudice at the persons thus brought upon the Stage; much less at the
Surviving Relations of those persons, with and for whom I would be as Hearty
a mourner as any man Living in the World: The Lord Comfort them! But having
Received a Command so to do,<ref target="n111">[111]</ref> I can do no other than shortly Relate the Chief
Matters of fact, which occurr'd in the Trials of some that were Executed, in an
Abridgment collected out of the Court-Papers, on this occasion put into my
Hands.<ref target="n112">[112]</ref> You are to take the Truth, just as it was; and the Truth will hurt no good
man. There might have been more of these, if my Book would not thereby have
been swollen too big; and if some other worthy hands did not perhaps intend
something further in these Collections;<ref target="n113">[113]</ref> for which cause I have only singled out
Four or Five, which may serve to Illustrate the way of dealing, wherein
Witchcrafts use to be concerned; and I Report matters not as an Advocate but as

<p>They were some of the Gracious Words inserted in the Advice, which many

as Murder, and Executed in this place more than Forty Years ago, did then give
Notice of An Horrible Plot against the Country by Witchcraft, and a Foundation
of Witchcraft then laid, which if it were not seasonably discovered would
probably Blow up, and pull down all the Churches in the Country.&rdquo;
&ldquo;We have now with Horror,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;seen the Discovery
of such a Witchcraft!&rdquo; and from the confessions at Salem he learns that
&ldquo;at prodigious Witch-Meetings the Wretches have proceeded so far as to
Concert and Consult the Methods of Rooting out the Christian Religion from this
Country&rdquo; and setting up instead of it a &ldquo;Diabolism.&rdquo; Not
even this is all: &ldquo;it may be fear'd that, in the Horrible Tempest which is

<note id="n115"><seg type="note-symbol">[115]</seg> <p>What next follows, very cleverly ensuring a friendly attitude toward the

London in 1682, which had been a guide to the Salem judges (see p. 416,
below).</p></note>
</div3>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d39">
<head>I. The Tryal of G. B.<ref target="n116">[116]</ref> At a Court of Oyer and Terminer,
Held in Salem, 1692.</head>

<p>Glad should I have been, if I had never known the Name of this man; or
never had this occasion to mention so much as the first Letters of his
Name.<ref target="n117">[117]</ref> But
the Government requiring some Account of his Trial to be Inserted in this Book,
it becomes me with all Obedience to submit unto the Order.</p>


<p>I. This G. B. was indicted for Witch-crafts, and in the Prosecution of the
Charge against him, he was Accused by five or six of the Bewitched, as the
Author of their Miseries; he was Accused by eight of the Confessing Witches, as
being an Head Actor at some of their Hellish Randezvouzes, and one

<pb n="216"/>




who had the promise of being a King in Satans Kingdom, now going to be
Erected: he was Accused by nine persons for extraordinary Lifting, and such
Feats of Strength, as could not be done without a Diabolical Assistance. And for
other such Things he was Accused, until about Thirty Testimonies were brought
in against him; nor were these judg'd the half of what might have been
considered for his Conviction: however they were enough to fix the Character of
a Witch upon him according to the Rules of Reasoning, by the Judicious
Gaule,<ref target="n118">[118]</ref>
in that Case directed.</p>


<p>II. The Court being sensible, that the Testimonies of the Parties Bewitched
use to have a Room among the Suspicions or Presumptions, brought in against
one Indicted for Witchcraft, there were now heard the Testimonies of several
Persons, who were most notoriously Bewitched, and every day Tortured by
Invisible Hands, and these now all charged the Spectres of G. B. to have a share
in their Torments. At the Examination of this G. B. the Bewitched People were
grievously harassed with Preternatural Mischiefs, which could not possibly be
Dissembled; and they still ascribed it unto the Endeavours of G. B. to kill them.
And now upon his Trial, one of the Bewitched Persons testify'd, That in her
Agonies, a little Black hair'd man came to her, saying his Name was B. and
bidding her set her hand unto a Book which he show'd unto her; and bragging
that he was a Conjurer, above the ordinary Rank of Witches; That he often
persecuted her with the offer of that Book, saying, She should be well, and need
fear no body, if she would but Sign it; but he inflicted cruel Pains and Hurts upon
her, because of her Denying so to do. The Testimonies of the other Sufferers
concurred with these; and it was Remarkable, that whereas Biting was one of the
ways which the Witches used for the vexing of the Sufferers, when they cry'd out
of G. B. biting them, the print of the Teeth would be seen on the Flesh of the
Complainers, and just

<pb n="217"/>




such a sett of Teeth as G. B's would then appear upon them, which could be
distinguished from those of some other mens. Others of them testify'd, That in
their Torments, G. B. tempted them to go unto a Sacrament, unto which they
perceived him with a sound of Trumpet Summoning of other Witches, who
quickly after the Sound would come from all Quarters unto the Rendezvouz. One
of them falling into a kind of Trance, afterwards affirmed, That G. B. had carried
her into a very high Mountain, where he show'd her mighty and glorious
Kingdoms, and said, He would give them all to her, if she would write in his
Book; but she told him, They were none of his to give; and refused the motions,
enduring of much misery for that Refusal.</p>


<p>It cost the Court a wonderful deal of Trouble, to hear the Testimonies of
the Sufferers; for when they were going to give in their Depositions, they would
for a long time be taken with fitts, that made them uncapable of saying any thing.
The Chief Judge asked the prisoner, who he thought hindred these witnesses from
giving their testimonies? and he answered, He supposed it was the Divel. That
Honourable person then reply'd, How comes the Divel so loathe to have any
Testimony born against you? Which cast him into very great confusion.</p>


<p>III. It has been a frequent thing for the Bewitched people to be entertained
with Apparitions of Ghosts of murdered people, at the same time that the Spectres
of the witches trouble them. These Ghosts do always affright the Beholders more
than all the other spectral Representations; and when they exhibit themselves,
they cry out, of being Murdered by the witchcrafts or other violences of the
persons who are then in spectre present. It is further considerable, that once or
twice, these Apparitions have been seen by others at the very same time that they
have shewn them selves to the Bewitched; and seldom have there been these
Apparitions but when something unusual and suspected had attended the Death of
the party thus Appearing. Some that have bin accused by these Apparitions,
accosting of the Bewitched People, who had never heard a word of any such
persons ever being in the world, have upon a fair examination freely and fully
confessed the murders of those very persons, altho' these also did not know

<pb n="218"/>




how the Apparitions had complained of them. Accordingly several of the
Bewitched had given in their Testimony, that they had been troubled with the
Apparitions of two women, who said that they were G. B's two wives, and that
he had been the Death of them; and that the Magistrates must be told of it, before
whom if B. upon his trial deny'd it, they did not know but that they should
appear again in the Court. Now, G. B. had been infamous for the Barbarous
usage of his two successive wives, all the Country over. Moreover, It was
testify'd, the spectre of G. B. threatning of the sufferers told them, he had killed
(besides others) Mrs. Lawson and her Daughter Ann.<ref target="n119">[119]</ref> And it was noted, That
these were the vertuous wife and Daughter of one at whom this G. B. might have
a prejudice for his being serviceable at Salem-village, from whence himself had
in Ill Terms removed some years before: and that when they dy'd, which was
long since, there were some odd circumstances about them, which made some of
the Attendents there suspect something of witchcraft, tho' none Imagined from
what Quarter it should come.</p>


<p>Well, G. B. being now upon his Triall, one of the Bewitched persons was
cast into Horror at the Ghosts of B's two deceased wives then appearing before
him, and crying for Vengeance against him. Hereupon several of the Bewitched
persons were successively called in, who all not knowing what the former had
seen and said, concurred in their Horror of the Apparition, which they affirmed
that he had before him. But he, tho' much appalled, utterly deny'd that he
discerned any thing of it; nor was it any part of his Conviction.</p>


<p>IV. Judicious Writers have assigned it a great place in the Conviction of
witches, when persons are Impeached by other Notorious witches, to be as Ill as
themselves; especially, if the persons have been much noted for neglecting the
Worship of God. Now, as there might have been Testimonies Enough of G. B's
Antipathy to Prayer and the other Ordinances of God, tho' by his profession
singularly obliged there-unto; so, there now came in against the prisoner the
Testimonies of several persons, who confessed their own having been Horrible
Witches, and ever since their confessions had been themselves terribly Tortured
by the Devils and other

<pb n="219"/>




Witches, even like the other Sufferers; and therein undergone the pains of many
Deaths for their Confessions.</p>


<p>These now Testify'd, that G. B. had been at Witch-meetings with them; and
that he was the Person who had Seduc'd and Compell'd them into the snares of
Witchcraft: That he promised them Fine Cloaths, for doing it; that he brought
Poppets to them, and thorns to stick into those Poppets, for the afflicting of other
People; And that he exhorted them, with the rest of the Crue, to bewitch all
Salem-Village, but be sure to do it Gradually, if they would prevail in what they
did.</p>


<p>When the Lancashire Witches<ref target="n120">[120]</ref> were condemn'd, I don't Remember that
there was any considerable further Evidence, than that of the Bewitched, and then
that of some that confessed. We see so much already against G. B. But this being
indeed not Enough, there were other things to render what had already been
produced credible.</p>


<p>V. A famous Divine<ref target="n121">[121]</ref> recites this among the Convictions of a Witch; The
Testimony of the Party Bewitched, whether Pining or Dying; together with the
Joint Oathes of Sufficient Persons that have seen certain Prodigious Pranks or
Feats wrought by the party Accused. Now God had been pleased so to leave this
G. B. that he had ensnared himself by several Instances, which he had formerly
given of a Preternatural strength, and which were now produced against him. He
was a very Puny man;<ref target="n122">[122]</ref> yet he had often done things beyond the strength of a
Giant. A Gun of about seven foot barrel, and so heavy that strong men could not
steadily hold it out with both hands; there were several Testimonies, given in by
Persons of Credit and Honour, that he made nothing of taking up such a Gun
behind the Lock, with but one hand, and holding it out like a Pistol, at Arms-end.
G. B. in his Vindication was so foolish as to say, That an Indian was there, and
held it out at the same time: Whereas, none of the Spectators ever saw

<pb n="220"/>




any such Indian; but they suppos'd the Black man (as the Witches call the Devil;
and they generally say he resembles an Indian) might give him that Assistence.
There was Evidence likewise brought in, that he made nothing of Taking up
whole Barrels fill'd with Malasses or Cider, in very Disadvantagious Postures,
and Carrying of them through the Difficultest Places out of a Canoo to the
Shore.</p>


<p>Yea, there were Two Testimonies that G. B. with only putting the
Fore-Finger of his Right hand into the Muzzel of an heavy Gun, a Fowling-piece
of about six or seven foot Barrel, did Lift up the Gun, and hold it out at Arms
end; a Gun which the Deponents though strong men could not with both hands
Lift up, and hold out at the Butt end, as is usual. Indeed, one of these Witnesses
was over perswaded by some persons to be out of the way upon G. B's Trial; but
he came afterwards with sorrow for his withdraw, and gave in his Testimony:
Nor were either of these Witnesses made use of as evidences in the Trial.</p>


<p>VI. There came in several Testimonies relating to the Domestick Affayrs
of G. B. which had a very hard Aspect upon him; and not only prov'd him a very
ill man; but also confirmed the Belief of the Character, which had been already
fastned on him.</p>


<p>'Twas testifyed, That keeping his two Successive Wives in a strange kind
of Slavery, he would when he came home from abroad pretend to tell the Talk
which any had with them; That he has brought them to the point of Death, by his
Harsh Dealings with his Wives, and then made the People about him to promise
that in Case Death should happen, they would say nothing of it; That he used all
means to make his Wives Write, Sign, Seal, and Swear a Covenant, never to
Reveal any of his Secrets; That his Wives had privately complained unto the
Neighbours about frightful Apparitions of Evil Spirits, with which their House
was sometimes infested; and that many such things have been Whispered among
the Neighbourhood. There were also some other Testimonies, relating to the
Death of People, whereby the Consciences of an Impartial Jury were convinced
that G. B. had Bewitched the persons mentioned in the Complaints. But I am
forced to omit several passages, in this, as well as in all the succeeding

<pb n="221"/>




Trials, because the Scribes who took Notice of them, have not Supplyed
me.</p>


<p>VII. One Mr. Ruck, Brother in Law to this G. B., Testify'd, that G. B. and
he himself, and his Sister, who was G. B's Wife, going out for Two or three
Miles to gather Straw-Berries, Ruck with his Sister the Wife of G. B. Rode home
very Softly, with G. B. on Foot in their Company. G. B. stept aside a little into
the Bushes; Whereupon they Halted and Halloo'd for him. He not answering,
they went away homewards, with a Quickened pace, without any expectation of
seeing him in a considerable while; and yet when they were got near home, to
their Astonishment they found him on foot with them, having a Basket of
Straw-Berries. G. B. immediately then fell to chiding his Wife, on the account
of what she had been speaking to her Brother, of him, on the Road: which when
they wondred at, he said, He knew their thoughts. Ruck being startled at that,
made some Reply, intimating that the Devil himself did not know so far; but G.
B. answered, My God makes known your Thoughts unto me. The prisoner now
at the Barr had nothing to answer, unto what was thus Witnessed against him,
that was worth considering. Only he said, Ruck and his Wife left a Man with
him, when they left him. Which Ruck now affirm'd to be false; and when the
Court asked G. B. What the Man's Name was? his countenance was much
altered; nor could he say, who 'twas. But the Court began to think, that he then
step'd aside, only that by the assistance of the Black Man, he might put on his
Invisibility, and in that Fascinating Mist, gratifie his own Jealous humour, to hear
what they said of him. Which trick of rendring themselves Invisible, our Witches
do in their confessions pretend that they sometimes are Masters of; and it is the
more credible, because there is Demonstration that they often render many other
things utterly Invisible.</p>


<p>VIII. Faltring, Faulty, unconstant, and contrary Answers upon Judicial and
deliberate examination, are counted some unlucky symptoms of guilt, in all
crimes, Especially in Witchcrafts.<ref target="n123">[123]</ref> Now there never was a prisoner more
Eminent for them, than G. B. both at his Examination and on his Trial.

His Tergiversations, Contradictions, and Falsehoods, were very sensible: he had
little to say, but that he had heard some things that he could not prove, Reflecting
upon the Reputation of some of the witnesses. Only he gave in a paper to the
Jury; wherein, altho' he had many times before granted, not only that there are
Witches, but also that the present sufferings of the Countrey are the Effect of
horrible Witchcrafts, yet he now goes to evince it, That there neither are, nor
ever were Witches, that having made a compact with the Divel, Can send a Divel
to Torment other people at a distance. This paper was Transcribed out
of Ady,<ref target="n124">[124]</ref>
which the Court presently<ref target="n125">[125]</ref> knew, as soon as they heard it. But he said, he had
taken none of it out of any Book; for which, his evasion afterwards was, that a
Gentleman gave him the discourse in a manuscript, from whence he Transcribed
it.</p>


<p>IX. The Jury brought him in guilty: But when he came to Dy, he utterly
deny'd the Fact, whereof he had been thus convicted.<ref target="n126">[126]</ref></p>

<note id="n116"><seg type="note-symbol">[116]</seg> <p>The Rev. George Burroughs, the most notable of the victims at Salem.
A graduate of Harvard in the class of 1670, he preached in Maine for some
years, and in 1680 became pastor at Salem Village, where he fell heir to a parish
quarrel, and, becoming involved in it, found it wise to remove in
1683 &mdash; Deodat Lawson succeeding him. Burroughs returned to Maine, and
was a pastor there at Wells, when his accusation by the &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo;
at Salem caused his arrest. He was brought back to Salem on May 4, committed
on May 9, tried on August 5, executed on August 19. As to his story see

<note id="n117"><seg type="note-symbol">[117]</seg> <p>It is not improbable that Mather had already begun to find himself blamed
for his harsh words as to Burroughs. On August 5, the day of his trial, he had
written to a friend: &ldquo;Our Good God is working of Miracles. Five Witches
were Lately Executed, impudently demanding of God a Miraculous Vindication
of their Innocency. Immediately upon this, Our God Miraculously sent in Five
Andover-Witches, who made a most ample, surprising, amazing Confession, of
all their Villainies and declared the Five newly executed to have been of their
Company; discovering many more; but all agreeing in Burroughs being their
Ringleader, who, I suppose, this day receives his Trial at Salem, whither a Vast
Concourse of people is gone; My Father this morning among the
Rest.&rdquo;</p></note>

&ldquo;The Reason of the Book&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Grand Errour of these

the name of Witches.&rdquo; &ldquo;When one Mr. Burroughs, a Clergyman,

<head>II. The Tryal of Bridget Bishop,<ref target="n127">[127]</ref> alias Oliver, At the
Court of Oyer and Terminer Held at Salem, June, 2, 1692.</head>

<p>I. She was Indicted for Bewitching of several persons in the
Neighbourhood, the Indictment being drawn up, according to the Form in such
Cases usual. And pleading, Not Guilty, there were brought in several persons,
who had long undergone many kinds of Miseries, which were preternaturally
Inflicted, and generally ascribed unto an horrible Witchcraft. There was little
Occasion to prove the Witchcraft, it being Evident and Notorious to all
Beholders. Now to fix the Witchcraft on the Prisoner at the Bar, the first thing
used, was the Testimony of the Bewitched; whereof several Testify'd, That the
Shape of the Prisoner did oftentimes very grievously pinch them, choak them,
Bite them, and Afflict them; urging them to write their Names in a Book, which
the said Spectre called, Ours. One of them did further Testify, that it was the
Shape of this Prisoner, with another, which one Day took her from her Wheel,
and carrying her to the River side, threatned there to Drown her, if she did not
Sign to the Book mentioned: which yet she refused. Others of them did also
Testify, that the said Shape did in her Threats brag to them that she had been the
Death of sundry persons, then by her Named; that she had Ridden a man then
likewise Named. Another Testify'd the Apparition of Ghosts unto the Spectre of
Bishop, crying out, You Murdered us! About the Truth whereof, there was in the
matter of Fact but too much Suspicion.</p>


<p>II. It was Testify'd, That at the Examination of the Prisoner before the
Magistrates, the Bewitched were extreamly Tortured. If she did but cast her Eyes
on them, they were presently struck down; and this in such a manner as there
could be no Collusion in the Business. But upon the Touch of her Hand upon
them, when they lay in their Swoons, they would immediately Revive; and not
upon the Touch of any ones else. Moreover, upon some Special Actions of her
Body,

<pb n="224"/>




as the shaking of her Head, or the Turning of her Eyes, they presently and
painfully fell into the like postures. And many of the like Accidents now fell out,
while she was at the Bar. One at the same time testifying, That she said, She
could not be Troubled to see the Afflicted thus Tormented.</p>


<p>III. There was Testimony likewise brought in, that a man striking once at
the place, where a Bewitched person said, the Shape of this Bishop stood, the
Bewitched cried out, that he had Tore her Coat, in the place then particularly
specify'd; and the Womans Coat was found to be Torn in that very place.</p>


<p>IV. One Deliverance Hobbs, who had Confessed her being a Witch, was
now Tormented by the Spectres, for her Confession. And she now Testify'd, That
this Bishop tempted her to Sign the Book again, and to Deny what she had
Confess'd. She affirmed, that it was the Shape of this Prisoner, which whipped
her with Iron Rods, to compel her thereunto. And she affirmed, that this Bishop
was at a General Meeting of the Witches, in a Field at Salem-Village, and there
partook of a Diabolical Sacrament in Bread and Wine then Administred!</p>


<p>V. To render it further Unquestionable, that the prisoner at the Bar was the
Person truly charged in <hi rend="italic">this</hi> Witchcraft, there were
produced many Evidences of <hi rend="italic">other</hi> Witchcrafts, by
her perpetrated. For Instance, John Cook testify'd, that about five or six years
ago, One morning, about Sun-Rise, he was in his Chamber assaulted by the Shape
of this prisoner: which Look'd on him, grin'd at him, and very much hurt him
with a Blow on the side of the Head: and that on the same day, about Noon, the
same Shape walked in the Room where he was, and an Apple strangely flew out
of his Hand, into the Lap of his Mother, six or eight foot from him.</p>


<p>VI. Samuel Gray testify'd, That about fourteen years ago, he wak'd on a
Night, and saw the Room where he lay full of Light; and that he then saw plainly
a Woman between the Cradle and the Bed-side, which look'd upon him. He Rose,
and it vanished; tho' he found the Doors all fast. Looking out at the Entry-Door,
he saw the same Woman, in the same Garb again; and said, In Gods Name, what
do you come for? He went to Bed, and had the same Woman again assaulting
him. The Child in the Cradle gave a great schreech, and the Woman Disappeared.
It was long before the Child

<pb n="225"/>




could be quieted; and tho' it were a very likely thriving Child, yet from this time
it pined away, and after divers months dy'd in a sad Condition. He knew not
Bishop, nor her Name; but when he saw her after this, he knew by her
Countenance, and Apparrel, and all Circumstances, that it was the Apparition of
this Bishop which had thus troubled him.</p>


<p>VII. John Bly and his Wife testify'd, that he bought a sow of Edward
Bishop, the Husband of the prisoner; and was to pay the price agreed, unto
another person. This Prisoner being Angry that she was thus hindred from
fingring the money, Quarrell'd with Bly. Soon after which, the Sow was taken
with strange Fits, Jumping, Leaping, and knocking her head against the Fence;
she seem'd Blind and Deaf, and would neither eat nor be suck'd. Whereupon a
neighbour said, she believed the Creature was Over-Looked; and sundry other
circumstances concurred, which made the Deponents Belive that Bishop had
Bewitched it.</p>


<p>VIII. Richard Coman testify'd, that eight years ago, as he lay Awake in his
Bed, with a Light Burning in the Room, he was annoy'd with the Apparition of
this Bishop, and of two more that were strangers to him, who came and
oppressed him so, that he could neither stir himself, nor wake any one else, and
that he was the night after molested again in the like manner; the said Bishop
taking him by the Throat, and pulling him almost out of the Bed. His kinsman
offered for this cause to lodge with him; and that Night, as they were Awake,
Discoursing together, this Coman was once more visited by the Guests which had
formerly been so troublesome; his kinsman being at the same time strook
speechless and unable to move Hand or Foot. He had laid his sword by him,
which these unhappy spectres did strive much to wrest from him; only he held too
fast for them. He then grew able to call the People of his house; but altho' they
heard him, yet they had not power to speak or stirr; until at last, one of the
people crying out, what's the matter? the spectres all vanished.</p>


<p>IX. Samuel Shattock testify'd, That in the Year 1680, this Bridget Bishop
often came to his house upon such frivolous and foolish errands, that they
suspected she came indeed with a purpose of mischief. Presently whereupon his
eldest child, which was of as promising Health and Sense as any

<pb n="226"/>




child of its Age, began to droop exceedingly; and the oftener that Bishop came
to the House, the worse grew the Child. As the Child would be standing at the
Door, he would be thrown and bruised against the Stones, by an Invisible Hand,
and in like sort knock his Face against the sides of the House, and bruise it after
a miserable manner. Afterwards this Bishop would bring him things to Dy,
whereof he could not Imagine any use; and when she paid him a piece of Money,
the Purse and Money were unaccountably conveyed out of a Lock'd box, and
never seen more. The Child was immediately hereupon taken with terrible fits,
whereof his Friends thought he would have dyed: indeed he did almost nothing
but cry and Sleep for several Months together; and at length his understanding
was utterly taken away. Among other Symptoms of an Inchantment upon him,
one was, that there was a Board in the Garden, whereon he would walk; and all
the invitations in the world could never fetch him off. About Seventeen or
Eighteen years after, there came a Stranger to Shattocks House, who seeing the
Child, said, &ldquo;This poor Child is Bewitched; and you have a Neighbour
living not far off, who is a Witch.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Your Neighbour
has had a falling out with your Wife; and she said in her Heart, your Wife is a
proud Woman, and she would bring down her Pride in this Child.&rdquo; He
then Remembred, that Bishop had parted from his Wife in muttering and
menacing Terms, a little before the Child was taken Ill. The abovesaid Stranger
would needs carry the Bewitched Boy with him to Bishops House, on pretence
of buying a pot of Cyder. The Woman Entertained him in furious manner; and
flew also upon the Boy, scratching his Face till the Blood came; and saying,
&ldquo;Thou Rogue, what, dost thou bring this Fellow here to plague
me?&rdquo; Now it seems the Man had said, before he went, that he would fetch
Blood of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>. Ever after the Boy was follow'd with
grievous Fits, which the Doctors themselves generally ascribed unto Witchcraft;
and wherein he would be thrown still into the Fire or the Water, if he were not
constantly look'd after; and it was verily believed that Bishop was the cause of
it.</p>


<p>X. John Louder testify'd, that upon some little controversy with Bishop
about her fowles, going well to Bed, he did awake in the Night by moonlight, and
did see clearly the likeness

<pb n="227"/>




of thisoman grievously oppressing him; in which miserable condition she held
him, unable to help him self, till near Day. He told Bishop of this; but she deny'd
it, and threatned him very much. Quickly after this, being at home on a Lords
day, with the doors shutt about him, he saw a Black Pig approach him; at which
he going to kick, it vanished away. Immediately after, sitting down, he saw a
Black thing Jump in at the Window, and come and stand before him. The Body
was like that of a Monkey, the Feet like a Cocks, but the Face much like a mans.
He being so extreemly affrighted, that he could not speak, this Monster spoke to
him, and said, &ldquo;I am a Messenger sent unto you, for I understand that you
are in some Trouble of Mind, and if you will be ruled by me, you shall want for
nothing in this world.&rdquo; Whereupon he endeavoured to clap his hands upon
it; but he could feel no substance, and it jumped out of the window again; but
immediately came in by the Porch, though the Doors were shut, and said,
&ldquo;You had better take my Counsel!&rdquo; He then struck at it with a
stick, but struck only the Groundsel, and broke the Stick. The Arm with which
he struck was presently Disenabled, and it vanished away. He presently went out
at the Back-Door, and spyed this Bishop, in her Orchard, going toward her
House; but he had not power to set one foot forward unto her. Whereupon
returning into the House, he was immediately accosted by the Monster he had
seen before; which Goblin was now going to Fly at him; whereat he cry'd out,
&ldquo;The whole Armour of God be between me and you!&rdquo; So it sprang
back, and flew over the Apple Tree, shaking many Apples off the Tree, in its
flying over. At its Leap, it flung Dirt with its Feet against the Stomach of the
Man; whereon he was then struck Dumb, and so continued for three Days
together. Upon the producing of this Testimony, Bishop deny'd that she knew this
Deponent: yet their two Orchards joined, and they had often had their Little
Quarrels for some years together.</p>


<p>XI. William Stacy Testifyed, That receiving Money of this Bishop, for
work done by him, he was gone but a matter of Three Rods from her, and
looking for his money, found it unaccountably gone from him. Some time after,
Bishop asked him, whether his Father would grind her grist for her? He

<pb n="228"/>




demanded why? she Reply'd, &ldquo;Because Folks count me a Witch.&rdquo;
He answered, &ldquo;No Question, but he will grind it for you.&rdquo; Being
then gone about six Rods from her, with a small Load in his Cart, suddenly the
Off-wheel slump't and sunk down into an Hole upon plain ground, so that the
Deponent was forced to get help for the Recovering of the wheel. But stepping
Back to look for the Hole which might give him this disaster, there was none at
all to be found. Some time after, he was waked in the Night; but it seem'd as
Light as Day, and he perfectly saw the shape of this Bishop in the Room,
Troubling of him; but upon her going out, all was Dark again. He charg'd Bishop
afterwards with it, and she deny'd it not; but was very angry. Quickly after, this
Deponent having been threatned by Bishop, as he was in a dark Night going to
the Barn, he was very suddenly taken or lifted from the ground, and thrown
against a stone wall; After that, he was again hoisted up and thrown down a
Bank, at the end of his House. After this again, passing by this Bishop, his Horse
with a small load, striving to Draw, all his Gears flew to pieces, and the Cart fell
down; and this deponent going then to lift a Bag of corn, of about two Bushels,
could not budge it with all his might.</p>


<p>Many other pranks of this Bishops this Deponent was Ready to testify. He
also testify'd, that he verily Believed, the said Bishop was the Instrument of his
Daughter Priscilla's Death; of which suspicion, pregnant Reasons were
assigned.</p>


<p>XII. To Crown all, John Bly and William Bly Testify'd, That being
Employ'd by Bridget Bishop, to help take down the Cellar-wall of the old House,
wherein she formerly Lived, they did in Holes of the said old Wall find several
Poppets,<ref target="n128">[128]</ref> made up of Rags and Hogs Brussels, with Headless Pins in them, the
Points being outward. Whereof she could give no Account unto the Court, that
was Reasonable or Tolerable.</p>


<p>XIII. One thing that made against the Prisoner was, her being evidently
convicted of Gross Lying in the Court, several Times, while she was making her
Plea. But besides this, a

<pb n="229"/>




Jury of Women found a preternatural Teat upon her Body,<ref target="n129">[129]</ref> but upon a second
search, within Three or four hours, there was no such thing to be seen. There
was also an account of other people whom this woman had afflicted. And there
might have been many more, if they had been enquired for. But there was no
need of them.</p>


<p>XIV. There was one very strange thing more, with which the Court was
newly Entertained. As this Woman was, under a Guard, passing by the Great and
Spacious Meeting-House of Salem, she gave a Look towards the House. And
immediately a D&aelig;mon Invisibly Entring the Meeting-house, Tore down a
part of it; so that tho' there were no person to be seen there, yet the people at the
Noise running in, found a Board, which was strongly fastned with several Nails,
transported unto another quarter of the House.</p>

<head>III. The Tryal of Susanna Martin,<ref target="n130">[130]</ref> At the Court of Oyer
and Terminer, Held by Adjournment at Salem, June 29, 1692.</head>

<p>I. Susanna Martin, pleading Not Guilty to the Indictment of Witchcraft
brought in against her, there were produced the evidences of many persons very
sensibly and grievously Bewitched; who all complaned of the prisoner at the Bar,
as the person whom they Believed the cause of their Miseries. And now, as well
as in the other Trials, there was an extraordinary endeavour by Witchcrafts, with
Cruel and Frequent Fits, to hinder the poor sufferers from giving in their
complaints; which the Court was forced with much patience to obtain, by much
waiting and watching for it.</p>


<p>II. There was now also an Account given, of what passed at her first
examination before the Magistrates. The cast of her eye then striking the Afflicted
People to the ground, whether they saw that Cast or no; there were these among
other passages between the Magistrates and the Examinate.</p>

<p>It was then also noted in her, as in others like her, that if the Afflicted went
to approach her, they were flung down to the Ground. And, when she was asked
the Reason of it, she said, &ldquo;I cannot tell; it may be, the Devil bears me
more Malice than another.&rdquo;</p>


<p>III. The Court accounted themselves Alarum'd by these things, to Enquire
further into the Conversation of the Prisoner; and see what there might occur, to
render these Accusations further credible. Whereupon, John Allen, of Salisbury,
testify'd, That he refusing, because of the weakness of his Oxen, to Cart some
Staves, at the request of this Martin, she was displeased at it; and said, &ldquo;It
had been as good that he had; for his Oxen should never do him much more
Service.&rdquo; Whereupon this Deponent said, &ldquo;Dost thou threaten me,
thou old Witch? I'l throw thee into the Brook&rdquo;: Which to avoid, she flew
over the Bridge, and escaped. But, as he was going home, one of his Oxen Tired,
so that he was forced to Unyoke him, that he might get him home. He then put
his Oxen, with many more, upon Salisbury Beach, where Cattle did use to get
Flesh. In a few days, all the Oxen upon the Beach were found by their Tracks,
to have run unto the mouth of

<pb n="231"/>




Merrimack-River, and not returned; but the next day they were found come
ashore upon Plum-Island. They that sought them used all imaginable gentleness,
but they would still run away with a violence that seemed wholly Diabolical, till
they came near the mouth of Merrimack-River; when they ran right into the Sea,
swimming as far as they could be seen. One of them then swam back again, with
a swiftness amazing to the Beholders, who stood ready to receive him, and help
up his Tired Carcass: But the Beast ran furiously up into the Island, and from
thence, through the Marishes, up into Newbury Town, and so up into the Woods;
and there after a while found near Amesbury. So that, of Fourteen good Oxen,
there was only this saved: the rest were all cast up, some in one place, and some
in another, Drowned.</p>


<p>IV. John Atkinson Testify'd, That he Exchanged a Cow with a Son of
Susanna Martins, whereat she muttered, and was unwilling he should have it.
Going to Receive this Cow, tho' he Hamstring'd her, and Halter'd her, she of a
Tame Creature grew so mad, that they could scarce get her along. She broke all
the Ropes that were fastned unto her, and though she were Ty'd fast unto a Tree,
yet she made her Escape, and gave them such further Trouble, as they could
ascribe to no cause but Witchcraft.</p>


<p>V. Bernard Peache testify'd, That being in Bed on a Lords-day Night, he
heard a scrabbling at the Window, whereat he then saw Susanna Martin come in,
and jump down upon the Floor. She took hold of this Deponents Feet, and
drawing his Body up into an Heap, she lay upon him near Two Hours; in all
which time he could neither speak nor stirr. At length, when he could begin to
move, he laid hold on her Hand, and pulling it up to his mouth, he bit three of
her Fingers, as he judged, unto the Bone. Whereupon she went from the
Chamber, down the Stairs, out at the Door. This Deponent there-upon called unto
the people of the House, to advise them of what passed; and he himself did
follow her. The people saw her not; but there being a Bucket at the Left-hand of
the Door, there was a drop of Blood found on it; and several more drops of
Blood upon the Snow newly fallen abroad. There was likewise the print of her
two Feet just without the Threshold; but no more sign of any Footing further
off.</p>


<pb n="232"/>


<p>At another time this Deponent was desired by the Prisoner, to come unto
an Husking of Corn, at her House; and she said, If he did not come, it were
better that he did! He went not; but the Night following, Susanna Martin, as he
judged, and another came towards him. One of them said, &ldquo;Here he
is!&rdquo; but he having a Quarter-staff, made a Blow at them. The Roof of the
Barn broke his Blow; but following them to the Window, he made another Blow
at them, and struck them down; yet they got up, and got out, and he saw no more
of them.</p>


<p>About this time, there was a Rumour about the Town, that Martin had a
Broken Head; but the Deponent could say nothing to that.</p>


<p>The said Peache also testify'd the Bewitching of Cattle to Death, upon
Martin's Discontents.</p>


<p>VI. Robert Downer testifyed, That this Prisoner being some years ago
prosecuted at Court for a Witch,<ref target="n131">[131]</ref> he then said unto her, He believed she was a
Witch. Whereat she being dissatisfied, said, That some Shee-Devil would Shortly
fetch him away! Which words were heard by others, as well as himself. The
Night following, as he lay in his Bed, there came in at the Window the likeness
of a Cat, which Flew upon him, took fast hold of his Throat, lay on him a
considerable while, and almost killed him. At length he remembred what Susanna
Martin had threatned the Day before; and with much striving he cryed out,
&ldquo;Avoid, thou Shee-Devil! In the Name of God the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, Avoid!&rdquo; Whereupon it left him, leap'd on the Floor, and
Flew out at the Window.</p>


<p>And there also came in several Testimonies, that before ever Downer spoke
a word of this Accident, Susanna Martin and her Family had related, How this
Downer had been Handled!</p>


<p>VII. John Kembal testifyed, that Susanna Martin, upon a Causeless Disgust,
had threatned him, about a certain Cow of his, That she should never do him any
more Good: and it

<pb n="233"/>




came to pass accordingly. For soon after the Cow was found stark Dead on the
dry Ground, without any Distemper to be discerned upon her. Upon which he
was followed with a strange Death upon more of his Cattle, whereof he lost in
One Spring to the value of Thirty Pounds. But the said John Kembal had a further
Testimony to give in against the Prisoner which was truly admirable.</p>


<p>Being desirous to furnish himself with a Dog, he applied himself to buy one
of this Martin, who had a Bitch with Whelps in her House. But she not letting
him have his Choice, he said, he would supply himself then at one Blezdels.
Having mark'd a puppy which he lik'd at Blezdels, he met George Martin, the
Husband of the prisoner, going by, who asked him, Whether he would not have
one of his Wives Puppies? and he answered, No. The same Day, one Edmund
Eliot, being at Martins House, heard George Martin relate, where this Kembal
had been, and what he had said. Whereupon Susanna Martin replyed, &ldquo;If
I live, I'll give him Puppies enough!&rdquo; Within a few Dayes after, this
Kembal coming out of the Woods, there arose a little Black Cloud in the N.W.
and Kembal immediately felt a Force upon him, which made him not able to
avoid running upon the stumps of Trees, that were before him, albeit he had a
broad, plain Cart way, before him; but tho' he had his Ax also on his Shoulder
to endanger him in his Falls, he could not forbear going out of his way to tumble
over them. When he came below the Meeting-House, there appeared unto him a
little thing like a Puppy, of a Darkish Colour; and it shot backwards and forwards
between his Legs. He had the Courage to use all possible Endeavours of Cutting
it with his Ax; but he could not Hit it; the Puppy gave a jump from him, and
went, as to him it seem'd, into the Ground. Going a little further, there appeared
unto him a Black Puppy, somewhat bigger than the first, but as Black as a Cole.
Its motions were quicker than those of his Ax; it Flew at his Belly, and away;
then at his Throat; so, over his Shoulder one way, and then over his Shoulder
another way. His heart now began to fail him, and he thought the Dog would
have Tore his Throat out. But he recovered himself, and called upon God in his
Distress; and Naming the Name of Jesus Christ, it Vanished away at once. The
Deponent Spoke

<pb n="234"/>




not one Word of these Accidents, for fear of affrighting his wife. But the next
Morning, Edmond Eliot going into Martins House, this woman asked him where
Kembal was? He Replyed, At home, a bed, for ought he knew. She returned,
&ldquo;They say, he was frighted last Night.&rdquo; Eliot asked, &ldquo;With
what?&rdquo; She answered, &ldquo;With Puppies.&rdquo; Eliot asked, Where
she heard of it, for he had heard nothing of it? She rejoined, &ldquo;About the
Town.&rdquo; Altho' Kembal had mentioned the Matter to no Creature
Living.</p>


<p>VIII. William Brown testify'd, that Heaven having blessed him with a most
Pious and prudent wife, this wife of his one day mett with Susanna Martin; but
when she approch'd just unto her, Martin vanished out of sight, and left her
extremely affrighted. After which time, the said Martin often appear'd unto her,
giving her no little trouble; and when she did come, she was visited with Birds
that sorely peck't and Prick'd her; and sometimes a Bunch, like a pullets egg,
would Rise in her throat, ready to Choak her, till she cry'd out, &ldquo;Witch,
you shan't choak me!&rdquo; While this good Woman was in this Extremity, the
Church appointed a Day of Prayer, on her behalf; whereupon her Trouble ceas'd;
she saw not Martin as formerly; and the Church, instead of their Fast, gave
Thanks for her Deliverance. But a considerable while after, she being Summoned
to give in some Evidence at the Court, against this Martin, quickly thereupon this
Martin came behind her, while she was milking her Cow, and said unto her,
&ldquo;For thy defaming me at Court, I'l make thee the miserablest Creature in
the World.&rdquo; Soon after which, she fell into a strange kind of Distemper,
and became horribly Frantick, and uncapable of any Reasonable Action; the
Physicians declaring, that her Distemper was preternatural, and that some Devil
had certainly Bewitched her; and in that Condition she now remained.</p>


<p>IX. Sarah Atkinson testify'd, That Susanna Martin came from Amesbury
to their House at Newbury, in an extraordinary Season, when it was not fit for
any one to Travel. She came (as she said unto Atkinson) all that long way on
Foot. She brag'd and show'd how dry she was; nor could it be perceived that so
much as the Soles of her Shoes were wet. Atkinson was amazed at it; and
professed, that she should her self have

<pb n="235"/>




been wet up to the knees, if she had then came so far; but Martin reply'd, She
scorn'd to be Drabbled! It was noted, that this Testimony upon her Trial cast her
in a very singular Confusion.</p>


<p>X. John Pressy testify'd, That being one Evening very unaccountably
Bewildred, near a field of Martins, and several times, as one under an
Enchantment, returning to the place he had left, at length he saw a marvellous
Light, about the Bigness of an Half-Bushel, near two Rod out of the way. He
went, and struck at it with a Stick, and laid it on with all his might. He gave it
near forty blows; and felt it a palpable substance. But going from it, his Heels
were struck up, and he was laid with his Back on the Ground, Sliding, as he
thought, into a Pit; from whence he recover'd, by taking hold on the Bush; altho'
afterwards he could find no such Pit in the place. Having, after his Recovery,
gone five or six Rod, he saw Susanna Martin standing on his Left-hand, as the
Light had done before; but they changed no words with one another. He could
scarce find his House in his Return; but at length he got home, extreamly
affrighted. The next day, it was upon Enquiry understood, that Martin was in a
miserable condition by pains and hurts that were upon her.</p>


<p>It was further testify'd by this Deponent, That after he had given in some
Evidence against Susanna Martin, many years ago, she gave him foul words
about it; and said, He should never prosper more; particularly, That he should
never have more than two Cows; that tho' he were never so likely to have more,
yet he should never have them. And that from that very Day to this, namely for
Twenty Years together, he could never exceed that Number; but some strange
thing or other still prevented his having of any more.</p>


<p>XI. Jervis Ring testifyed, that about seven years ago, he was oftentimes and
grievously Oppressed in the Night, but saw not who Troubled him, until at last
he, Lying perfectly Awake, plainly saw Susanna Martin approach him. She came
to him, and forceably Bit him by the Finger; so that the Print of the Bite is now
so long after to be seen upon him.</p>


<p>XII. But besides all of these Evidences, there was a most wonderful
Account of one Joseph Ring, produced on this Occasion.</p>


<pb n="236"/>


<p>This man has been strangely carried about by D&aelig;mons, from one
Witch-Meeting to another, for near two years together; and for one Quarter of
this Time, they have made him and kept him Dumb, tho' he is now again able to
speak. There was one T. H.<ref target="n132">[132]</ref> who having, as tis judged, a Design of engaging
this Joseph Ring in a Snare of Devillism, contrived a wile, to bring this Ring two
Shillings in Debt unto him.</p>


<p>Afterwards, this poor man would be visited with unknown shapes, and this
T. H. sometimes among them; which would force him away with them, unto
unknown Places, where he saw meetings, Feastings, Dancings; and after his
Return, wherein they hurried him along thro' the Air, he gave Demonstrations to
the Neighbours, that he had indeed been so transported. When he was brought
unto these Hellish meetings, one of the First things they still<ref target="n133">[133]</ref> did unto him, was
to give him a knock on the Back, whereupon he was ever as if Bound with
Chains, uncapable of Stirring out of the place, till they should Release him. He
related, that there often came to him a man, who presented him a Book, whereto
he would have him set his Hand; promising to him, that he should then have even
what he would; and presenting him with all the Delectable Things, persons, and
places, that he could imagine. But he refusing to subscribe, the business would
end with dreadful Shapes, Noises and Screeches, which almost scared him out of
his witts. Once with the Book, there was a Pen offered him, and an Inkhorn with
Liquor in it, that seemed like Blood: but he never toucht it.</p>


<p>This man did now affirm, that he saw the Prisoner at several of those
Hellish Randezvouzes.</p>


<p>Note, This Woman was one of the most Impudent, Scurrilous, wicked
creatures in the world; and she did now throughout her whole Trial discover
herself to be such an one. Yet when she was asked, what she had to say for her
self? her Cheef Plea was, That she had Led a most virtuous and Holy Life!</p>

<head>IV. The Trial of Elizabeth How,<ref target="n134">[134]</ref> at the Court of Oyer
and Terminer, Held by Adjournment at Salem, June 30, 1692.</head>

<p>I. Elizabeth How pleading Not Guilty to the Indictment of Witchcrafts, then
charged upon her, the Court, according to the usual proceeding of the Courts in
England, in such Cases, began with hearing the Depositions of Several Afflicted
People, who were grievously Tortured by sensible and evident Witchcrafts, and
all complained of the Prisoner, as the cause of their Trouble. It was also found
that the Sufferers were not able to bear her Look, as likewise, that in their
greatest Swoons, they distinguished her Touch from other peoples, being thereby
raised out of them.</p>


<p>And there was other Testimony of people to whom the shape of this How
gave trouble Nine or Ten years ago.</p>


<p>II. It has been a most usual thing for the Bewitched persons, at the same
time that the Spectres representing the Witches Troubled them, to be visited with
Apparitions of Ghosts, pretending to have bin Murdered by the Witches then
represented. And sometimes the confessions of the witches afterwards
acknowledged those very Murders, which these Apparitions charged upon them;
altho' they had never heard what Informations had been given by the
Sufferers.</p>


<p>There were such Apparitions of Ghosts testified by some of the present
Sufferers, and the Ghosts affirmed that this How had Murdered them: which
things were Fear'd but not prov'd.</p>


<p>III. This How had made some Attempts of Joyning to the Church, at
Ipswich, several years ago; but she was deny'd an Admission into that Holy
Society, partly through a suspicion of witchcraft, then urged against her. And
there now came in Testimony, of Preternatural Mischiefs, presently befalling
some that had been Instrumental to Debar her from the Communion, whereupon
she was Intruding.</p>


<pb n="238"/>


<p>



</p>


<p>IV. There was a particular Deposition of Joseph Safford, That his Wife had
conceived an extream Aversion to this How, on the Reports of her Witchcrafts:
but How one day, taking her by the hand, and saying, &ldquo;I believe you are
not Ignorant of the great Scandal that I ly under, by an evil Report Raised upon
me,&rdquo; She immediately, unreasonably, and unperswadeably, even like one
Enchanted, began to take this Womans part. How being soon after propounded,
as desiring an Admission to the Table of the Lord, some of the pious Brethren
were unsatisfy'd about her. The Elders appointed a Meeting to hear Matters
objected against her; and no Arguments in the world could hinder this Goodwife
Safford from going to the Lecture. She did indeed promise, with much ado, that
she would not go to the Church-Meeting, yet she could not refrain going thither
also. How's Affayrs there were so Canvased, that she came off rather Guilty than
Cleared; nevertheless Goodwife Safford could not forbear taking her by the Hand,
and saying, &ldquo;Tho' you are Condemned before men, you are Justify'd
before God.&rdquo; She was quickly taken in a very strange manner, Frantick,
Raving, Raging and Crying out, &ldquo;Goody How must come into the Church;
she is a precious Saint; and tho' she be Condemned before Men, she is Justify'd
before God.&rdquo; So she continued for the space of two or three Hours; and
then fell into a Trance. But coming to her self, she cry'd out, &ldquo;Ha! I was
mistaken&rdquo;; and afterwards again repeated, &ldquo;Ha! I was
mistaken!&rdquo; Being asked by a stander by, &ldquo;Wherein?&rdquo; She
replyed, &ldquo;I thought Goody How had been a Precious Saint of God, but
now I see she is a Witch. She has Bewitched me, and my Child, and we shall
never be well, till there be Testimony for her, that she may be taken into the
Church.&rdquo; And How said afterwards, that she was very Sorry to see
Safford at the Church-Meeting mentioned. Safford after this declared herself to
be afflicted by the Shape of How; and from that Shape she endured many
Miseries.</p>


<p>V. John How, Brother to the Husband of the prisoner testifyed, that he
refusing to accompany the prisoner unto her Examination, as was by her desired,
immediately some of his Cattle were Bewitched to Death, Leaping three or four
foot high, turning about, Squeaking, Falling, and Dying, at once; and going to
cut off an Ear, for an use that might as well per

<pb n="239"/>




haps have been Omitted,<ref target="n135">[135]</ref> the Hand wherein he held his knife was taken very
Numb, and so it remained, and full of Pain, for several Dayes; being not well at
this very Time. And he suspected this prisoner for the Author of it.</p>


<p>VI. Nehemiah Abbot testify'd, that unusual and mischievous Accidents
would befal his cattle, whenever he had any Difference with this Prisoner. Once,
Particularly, she wished his Oxe Choaked; and within a Little while that Oxe was
Choaked with a Turnip in his Throat. At another time, refusing to lend his horse,
at the Request of her Daughter, the horse was in a Preternatural manner abused.
And several other Odd Things of that kind were testify'd.</p>


<p>VII. There came in Testimony, that one goodwife Sherwin, upon some
Difference with How, was Bewitched, and that she Dy'd, Charging this How of
having an Hand in her Death. And that other People had their Barrels of Drink
unaccountably mischieved, spoilt, and spilt, upon their Displeasing of her.</p>


<p>The things in themselves were Trivial; but there being such a Course of
them, it made them the more to be considered. Among others, Martha Wood gave
her Testimony, that a Little after her Father had been employ'd in gathering an
Account of Howes Conversation, they once and again Lost Great Quantities of
Drink out of their Vessels, in such a manner, as they could ascribe to nothing but
Witchcraft. As also, that How giving her some Apples, when she had eaten of
them she was taken with a very strange kind of a maze, insomuch that she knew
not what she said or did.</p>


<p>VIII. There was Likewise a cluster of Depositions, that one Isaac
Cummings refusing to lend his Mare unto the Husband of this How, the mare was
within a Day or two taken in a strange condition. The Beast seemed much
Abused; being

<pb n="240"/>




Bruised, as if she had been Running over the Rocks, and marked where the Bridle
went, as if burnt with a Red hot Bridle. Moreover, one using a Pipe of Tobacco
for the Cure of the Beast, a blew Flame issued out of her, took hold of her Hair,
and not only Spread and Burnt on her, but it also flew upwards towards the Roof
of the Barn, and had like to have set the Barn on Fire. And the Mare dy'd very
suddenly.</p>


<p>IX. Timothy Perley and his Wife Testify'd, not only that unaccountable
Mischiefs befel their Cattle, upon their having of Differences with this Prisoner:
but also, that they had a Daughter destroy'd by Witchcrafts; which Daughter still
charged How as the cause of her Affliction; and it was noted, that she would be
struck down, whenever How were spoken of. She was often endeavoured to be
Thrown into the Fire, and into the Water, in her strange Fits: tho' her Father had
Corrected her for Charging How with Bewitching her, yet (as was testify'd by
others also) she said, she was sure of it, and must dy standing to it. Accordingly
she Charged How to the very Death; and said, Tho' How could Afflict and
Torment her Body, yet she could not Hurt her Soul: and, That the Truth of this
matter would appear, when she should be Dead and Gone.</p>


<p>X. Francis Lane testify'd, That being hired by the Husband of this How to
get him a parcel of Posts and Rails, this Lane hired John Pearly to assist him.
This Prisoner then told Lane, that she believed the Posts and Rails would not do,
because John Perley helped him; but that if he had got them alone, without John
Pearlies help, they might have done well enough. When James How came to
receive his Posts and Rails of Lane, How taking them up by the ends, they, tho'
good and sound, yet unaccountably broke off, so that Lane was forced to get
Thirty or Forty more. And this Prisoner being informed of it, she said, she told
him so before; because Pearly help'd about them.</p>


<p>XI. Afterwards there came in the Confessions of several other (penitent)
Witches, which affirmed this How to be one of those, who with them had been
baptized by the Devil in the River at Newbery-Falls: before which, he made them
there kneel down by the Brink of the River and Worship him.</p>

in 1657, Thomas Mullener cut off the tail and ear of a pig and threw them into
the fire to find out the witch (<hi rend="italic">Records of the Colony of

<head>V. The Trial of Martha Carrier,<ref target="n136">[136]</ref> at the Court of Oyer and
Terminer, Held by Adjournment at Salem, August 2, 1692.</head>

<p>I. Martha Carrier was Indicted for the Bewitching of certain Persons,
according to the Form usual in such Cases. Pleading Not Guilty, to her
Indictment, there were First brought in a considerable number of the Bewitched
Persons; who not only made the Court sensible of an horrid Witchcraft committed
upon them, but also deposed, That it was Martha Carrier, or her Shape, that
Grievously Tormented them, by Biting, Pricking, Pinching, and Choaking of
them. It was further deposed, that while this Carrier was on her Examination,
before the Magistrates, the Poor People were so Tortured that every one expected
their Death upon the very Spott; but that upon the binding of Carrier they were
eased. Moreover the Look of Carrier then laid the Afflicted People for Dead; and
her Touch, if her Eye at the same Time were off them, raised them again. Which
things were also now seen upon her Trial. And it was Testifyed, that upon the
mention of some having their Necks twisted almost round, by the Shape of this
Carrier, she replyed, &ldquo;Its no matter, tho' their Necks had been twisted
quite off.&rdquo;</p>


<p>II. Before the Trial of this prisoner, several of her own Children had
frankly and fully confessed, not only that they were Witches themselves, but that
this their Mother had made them so. This Confession they made with great shows
of Repentance, and with much Demonstration of Truth. They Related Place,
Time, Occasion; they gave an account of Journeyes, Meetings, and Mischiefs by
them performed; and were very credible in what they said. Nevertheless, this
Evidence was not produced against the Prisoner at the Bar, inasmuch as there was
other Evidence enough to proceed upon.</p>


<p>III. Benjamin Abbot gave in his Testimony, that last March was a twelve
month, this Carrier was very Angry with

<pb n="242"/>

him, upon laying out some Land, near her Husbands: Her Expressions in this
Anger, were, That she would stick as close to Abbot, as the Bark stuck to the
Tree, and that he should Repent of it afore seven years came to an end, so as
Doctor Prescot should never cure him. These words were heard by others,
besides Abbot himself; who also heard her say, She would hold his Nose as close
to the Grindstone, as ever it was held since his Name was Abbot. Presently after
this, he was taken with a swelling in his Foot, and then with a pain in his side,
and exceedingly Tormented. It bred into a sore, which was Lanced by Doctor
Prescot, and several Gallons of Corruption ran out of it. For six weeks it
continued very bad; and then another sore bred in his Groin, which was also
Lanc'd by Doctor Prescot. Another Sore then bred in his Groin, which was
likewise Cut, and put him to very great Misery. He was brought unto Deaths
Door, and so remained until Carrier was taken, and carried away by the
Constable; from which very day, he began to mend, and so grew better every
day, and is well ever since.</p>

<p>Sarah Abbot also, his Wife, testify'd, that her Husband was not only all this
while Afflicted in his Body, but also that strange, extraordinary and
unaccountable Calamities befel his Cattel; their Death being such as they could
guess at no Natural Reason for.</p>


<p>IV. Allin Toothaker testify'd, That Richard, the Son of Martha Carrier,
having some Difference with him, pull'd him down by the Hair of the Head.
When he Rose again, he was going to strike at Richard Carrier; but fell down flat
on his Back to the ground, and had not power to stir hand or foot, until he told
Carrier he yielded; and then he saw the Shape of Martha Carrier go off his
Breast.</p>


<p>This Toothaker had Received a Wound in the Wars; and he now testify'd,
that Martha Carrier told him, He should never be Cured. Just afore the
Apprehending of Carrier, he could thrust a knitting Needle into his Wound, four
Inches

<pb n="243"/>

Deep; but presently after her being Siezed, he was thoroughly Healed.</p>


<p>He further testify'd, That when Carrier and he sometimes were at variance,
she would clap her hands at him, and say, He should get nothing by it;
Whereupon he several times lost his Cattle, by strange Deaths, whereof no
Natural Causes could be given.</p>


<p>V. John Rogger also testifyed, That upon the threatning words of this
malicious Carrier, his Cattle would be strangely Bewitched; as was more
particularly then described.</p>


<p>VI. Samuel Preston testify'd, that about two years ago, having some
Difference with Martha Carrier, he lost a Cow in a strange Preternatural unusual
manner; and about a month after this, the said Carrier, having again some
Difference with him, she told him, He had lately lost a Cow, and it should not
be long before he Lost another! which accordingly came to Pass; for he had a
Thriving and well-kept Cow, which without any known cause quickly fell down
and Dy'd.</p>


<p>VII. Phebe Chandler testify'd, that about a Fortnight before the
apprehension of Martha Carrier, on a Lords-Day, while the Psalm was singing,
in the Church, this Carrier then took her by the shoulder and shaking her, asked
her, where she Lived? she made her no Answer, although as Carrier, who lived
next door to her Fathers House, could not in reason but know who she was.
Quickly after this, as she was at several times crossing the Fields, she heard a
voice, that she took to be Martha Carriers, and it seem'd as if it was over her
Head. The voice told her, she should within two or three days be Poisoned.
Accordingly, within such a Little time, One Half of her Right Hand became
greatly swollen, and very painful; as also part of her Face; whereof she can give
no account how it came. It continued very Bad for some dayes; and several times
since, she has had a great pain in her Breast; and been so siezed on her Legs, that
she has hardly been able to go. She added that lately, going well to the House of
God, Richard, the Son of Martha Carrier, Look'd very earnestly upon her, and
immediately her hand, which had formerly been poisoned, as is abovesaid, began
to pain her greatley, and she had a strange Burning at her stomach; but was then
struck deaf,

<pb n="244"/>

so that she could not hear any of the prayer, or singing, till the two or three last
words of the Psalme.</p>

<p>VIII. One Foster, who confessed her own Share in the Witchcraft for which
the Prisoner stood indicted, affirm'd, That she had seen the Prisoner at some of
their Witch-Meetings, and that it was this Carrier, who perswaded her to be a
Witch. She confessed, That the Devil carry'd them on a Pole, to a
Witch-Meeting; but the Pole broke, and she hanging about Carriers Neck, they
both fell down, and she then Received an Hurt by the Fall, whereof she was not
at this very time Recovered.</p>


<p>IX. One Lacy, who likewise confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now
Testify'd, That she and the Prisoner were once Bodily present at a Witch-meeting
in Salem-Village; and that she knew the Prisoner to be a Witch, and to have been
at a Diabolical Sacrament, and that the Prisoner was the undoing of her and her
Children, by Enticing them into the Snare of the Devil.</p>


<p>X. Another Lacy, who also Confessed her share in this Witchcraft, now
Testify'd, That the Prisoner was at the Witch-Meeting, in Salem Village, where
they had Bread and Wine Administred unto them.</p>


<p>XI. In the Time of this Prisoner's Trial, one Susanna Shelden in open Court
had her Hands Unaccountably Ty'd together with a Wheel-band, so fast that
without Cutting it could not be Loosed: It was done by a Spectre; and the
Sufferer affirm'd, it was the Prisoners.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Memorandum</hi>. This Rampant Hag, Martha
Carrier, was the Person, of whom the Confessions of the Witches, and of her
own Children among the rest, agreed, That the Devil had promised her, she
should be Queen of Hell.</p>


<p>Having thus far done the Service imposed upon me, I will further pursue
it, by relating a few of those Matchless Curiosities, with which the Witchcraft
now upon us has entertained us. And I shall Report nothing but with Good
Authority, and what I would Invite all my Readers to examine, while tis yet Fresh
and New, that if there be found any mistake, it may be as willingly Retracted, as
it was unwillingly Committed.</p>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d49">
<head>The First Curiositie.</head>

<p>I. Tis very Remarkable to see what an Impious and Impudent Imitation of
Divine Things is Apishly affected by the Devil, in several of those matters,
whereof the Confessions of our Witches and the Afflictions of our Sufferers have
informed us.</p>


<p>That Reverend and Excellent Person, Mr. John Higginson,<ref target="n137">[137]</ref> in My
Conversation with him, Once invited me to this Reflection; That the Indians
which came from far to settle about Mexico, were in their Progress to that
Settlement, under a Conduct of the Devil, very strangely Emulating what the
Blessed God gave to Israel in the Wilderness.</p>


<p>Acosta<ref target="n138">[138]</ref> is our Author for it, that the Devil in their Idol Vitzlipultzli
governed that mighty Nation. He commanded them to leave their Country,
promising to make them Lords over all the Provinces possessed by Six other
Nations of Indians, and give them a Land abounding with all precious things.
They went forth, carrying their Idol with them, in a Coffer of Reeds, supported
by Four of their Principal Priests; with whom he still Discoursed, in secret,
Revealing to them the Successes, and Accidents of their way. He advised them,
when to March, and where to Stay, and without his Commandment they moved
not. The first thing they did, wherever they came, was to Erect a Tabernacle, for
their False God; which they set always in the midst of their Camp, and there
placed the Ark upon an Altar. When they, Tired with pains, talked of proceeding
no further in their Journey, than a certain pleasant Stage, whereto they were
arrived, this Devil in one night horribly kill'd them that had started this Talk, by
pulling out their Hearts. And so they passed on, till they came to Mexico.</p>


<p>The Devil which then thus imitated what was in the Church of the Old
Testament, now among Us would Imitate the Affayrs

<pb n="246"/>




of the Church in the New. The Witches do say, that they form themselves much
after the manner of Congregational Churches; and that they have a Baptism and
a Supper, and Officers among them, abominably Resembling those of our
Lord.</p>


<p>But there are many more of these Bloody Imitations, if the Confessions of
the Witches are to be Received; which I confess, ought to be but with very much
of Caution.</p>


<p>What is their striking down with a fierce Look? What is their making of the
Afflicted Rise, with a touch of their Hand? What is their Transportation thro' the
Air? What is their Travelling in Spirit, while their Body is cast into a Trance?
What is their causing of Cattle to run mad and perish? What is their Entring their
Names in a Book? What is their coming together from all parts, at the Sound of
a Trumpet? What is their Appearing sometimes Cloathed with Light or Fire upon
them? What is their Covering of themselves and their Instruments with
Invisibility? But a Blasphemous Imitation of certain Things recorded about our
Saviour, or His Prophets, or the Saints in the Kingdom of God.</p>

<head>A Second Curiositie.</head>

<p>II. In all the Witchcraft which now Grievously Vexes us, I know not
whether any thing be more Unaccountable, than the Trick which the Witches
have, to render themselves and their Tools Invisible. Witchcraft seems to be the
Skill of Applying the Plastic Spirit of the World<ref target="n139">[139]</ref> unto some unlawful purposes,
by means of a Confederacy with Evil Spirits. Yet one would wonder how the Evil
Spirits themselves can do some things: especially at Invisibilizing of the Grossest
Bodies. I can tell the Name of an Ancient Author, who pretends to show the way,
how a man may come to walk about Invisible, and I can tell the Name of another
Ancient Author, who pretends to Explode that way. But I will not speak too
plainly, Lest I should unawares Poison some of my Readers, as the

<pb n="247"/>




Pious Hemingius did one of his Pupils, when he only by way of Diversion recited
a Spell, which, they had said, would cure Agues.<ref target="n140">[140]</ref> This much I will say; The
notion of procuring Invisibility, by any Natural Expedient yet known, is, I
Believe, a meer Plinyism; How far it may be obtained by a Magical Sacrament,
is best known to the Dangerous Knaves that have Try'd it. But our Witches do
seem to have got the Knack: and this is one of the Things, that make me think,
Witchcraft will not be fully understood, until the Day when there shall not be one
Witch in the World.</p>


<p>There are certain people very Dogmatical about these matters; but I'l give
them only these Three Bones to Pick.</p>


<p>First, One of our Bewitched people was cruelly assaulted by a Spectre, that,
she said, ran at her with a Spindle: tho' no body else in the Room, could see
either the Spectre or the Spindle. At last, in her miseries, giving a Snatch at the
Spectre, she pull'd the Spindle away; and it was no sooner got into her hand, but
the other people then present beheld, that it was indeed a Real, Proper, Iron
Spindle, belonging they knew to whom; which when they Lock'd up very safe,
it was nevertheless by D&aelig;mons unaccountably stole away, to do further
mischief.</p>


<p>Secondly, Another of our Bewitched People was haunted with a most
abusive Spectre, which came to her, she said, with a Sheet about her. After she
had undergone a deal of Teaze, from the Annoyances of the Spectre, she gave a
Violent Snatch at the Sheet that was upon it; wherefrom she tore a Corner, which
in her Hand immediately became Visible to a Roomful of Spectators; a Palpable
Corner of a Sheet. Her Father, who was now holding her, Catch'd that he might
Keep what his Daughter had so strangely Seized, but the unseen Spectre had like
to have pull'd his Hand off, by Endeavouring to wrest it from him; however he
still held it, and I suppose has it still to show; it being but a few Hours ago,
namely about the Beginning of this October, that this Accident happened; in the
family of one Pitman, at Manchester.</p>


<p>Thirdly, A young man, delaying to procure Testimonials

<pb n="248"/>




for his Parents, who being under confinement on Suspicion of Witchcraft,
required him to do that Service for them, was quickly pursued with odd
Inconveniences. But once above the Rest, an Officer going to put his Brand on
the Horns of some Cows, belonging to these people, which tho' he had Siez'd for
some of their Debts, yet he was willing to leave in their Possession, for the
Subsistence of the poor Family; this young man help'd in holding the Cows to be
thus Branded. The three first Cows he held well enough; but when the hot Brand
was clap't upon the Fourth, he winc'd and shrunk at such a rate, as that he could
hold the Cow no longer. Being afterwards Examined about it, he Confessed, That
at that very Instant when the Brand entred the Cows Horn, exactly the like
burning Brand was clap'd upon his own Thigh; where he has Exposed the Lasting
Marks of it, unto such as asked to see them.</p>

Self-Murders committed here, have been the effects of a Cruel and Bloody
Witchcraft, letting fly D&aelig;mons upon the miserable Seneca's;<ref target="n143">[143]</ref> thus, it has
been admirable unto me to see, how a Devillish Witchcraft, sending Devils upon
them, has driven many poor people to Despair, and persecuted their minds with
such Buzzes<ref target="n144">[144]</ref> of Atheism and Blasphemy, as has made them even run Distracted
with Terrors: and some long Bow'd down under such a Spirit of Infirmity, have
been marvelously Recovered upon the Death of the Witches.</p>

direfully: presently after this was Whetford in the Night, and in her Bed, visited
by Bishop, with one Parker, who making the Room Light at their coming in,
there discoursed of several mischiefs they would inflict upon her. At last, they
pull'd her out, and carried her unto the Sea-side, there to drown her; but she
calling upon God, they left her, tho' not without Expressions of their Fury. From
that very Time, this poor Whetford was utterly spoilt, and grew a Tempted,
Froward, Crazed sort of a Woman; a vexation to her self, and all about her; and
many ways unreasonable. In this Distraction she lay, till those women were
Apprehended, by the Authority; then she began to mend; and upon their
Execution, was presently and perfectly Recovered, from the ten years madness

Blood-shot with passions, as to loose the sight of many wonderful Things,
wherein the Wisdom and Justice of God, would be Glorify'd. Some of those
Things, are the frequent Apparitions of Ghosts, whereby many Old Murders

lately Prest unto Death, because of his Refusing to Plead for his
Life.<ref target="n145">[145]</ref> I shall

Sewal, Esq.,<ref target="n146">[146]</ref> by Mr. Putman,<ref target="n147">[147]</ref> to this purpose;</p>


<p>The Last Night my Daughter Ann was grievously Tormented by Witches,
Threatning that she should be Pressed to Death, before Giles Cory. But thro' the
Goodness of a Gracious God, she had at last a little Respite. Whereupon there
appeared unto her (she said) a man in a Winding Sheet; who told her that Giles
Cory had Murdered him, by Pressing him to Death with his Feet; but that the
Devil there appeared unto him, and Covenanted with him, and promised him, He
should not be Hanged. The Apparition said, God Hardened his Heart, that he
should not hearken to the Advice of the Court, and so Dy an easy Death; because
as it said, &ldquo;It must be done to him as he has done to me.&rdquo; The
Apparition also said, That Giles Cory was carry'd to the Court for this, and that
the Jury had found the Murder, and that her Father knew the man, and the thing
was done before she was born. Now Sir, This is not a little strange to us; that no
body should Remember these things, all the while that Giles Cory was in Prison,
and so often before the Court. For all people now Remember very well, (and the
Records of the Court also mention it,) That about Seventeen Years ago, Giles
Cory kept a man in his House, that was almost a Natural Fool: which Man Dy'd
suddenly. A Jury was Impannel'd upon him, among whom was Dr. Zorobbabel
Endicot;<ref target="n148">[148]</ref> who found the man bruised to Death, and having clodders of Blood
about his Heart. The Jury, whereof several are yet alive, brought in the man
Murdered; but as if some Enchantment had hindred the Prosecution of the Matter,
the Court Proceeded not against Giles Cory, tho' it cost him a great deal of Mony
to get off.</p>

<head>FROM &ldquo;MORE WONDERS OF THE INVISIBLE
WORLD,&rdquo; BY ROBERT CALEF, 1700</head>



<pb n="291"/>

<div2 type="introduction" id="d58">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Of</hi> Robert Calef almost nothing is known
except what can be learned from his book. There has even been doubt as to
whether, of the two Robert Calefs known to us in Boston at this time, the writer
was the father or the son. In 1692, the time of the Salem witchcraft, the father's
age was 44, the son's 18.<ref target="n149">[149]</ref> It is unlikely that anybody would have thought of the
son but for a note copied into one of the memorandum-books of Dr. Jeremy
Belknap (1744-1798).<ref target="n150">[150]</ref> This note, of unknown source reads: &ldquo;Robert
Calef, author of `More Wonders of the Invisible World,' printed at London in
1700, was a native of England; a young man of good sense, and free from
superstition; a merchant in Boston. He was furnished with materials for his work
by Mr. Brattle, of Cambridge; and his brother, of Boston; and other gentlemen,
who were opposed to the Salem proceedings. &mdash; E. P.&rdquo; The writer
speaks as if with knowledge; and that so sound a historian as Dr. Belknap should
have copied the note speaks for its worth. Able scholars have by it been led to
ascribe the book to the younger Robert; but more careful study seems to show the
objections insuperable. The author never adds &ldquo;Jr.&rdquo; to his name,
as a son would have done, and as seems to have been the younger Robert's
custom.<ref target="n151">[151]</ref> He never pleads youth, even

<pb n="292"/>




when most apologetic; and, what weighs more, his indignant foes, seeking all
ways to discredit him, never hint at such a thing. His matter and style have in
them nothing of boyishness; and once, in words suggestive of a migrant and a
man of years, he speaks (p. 297, below) of &ldquo;sound Reason, which is what
I have been long seeking for in this Country in vain.&rdquo; Most serious of all,
his handwriting seems that found in documents clearly the elder Calef's, and is
that of a mature and even by 1700 that of an aging man; while that of the
younger Robert was in 1719-1722 still firm and flexible &mdash; and notably
different.<ref target="n152">[152]</ref></p>


<p>Robert Calef the elder came to America at some time before 1688. He was
a cloth-merchant, and doubtless a maker as







<pb n="293"/>




well as a seller of cloths.<ref target="n153">[153]</ref> Of his eight children the eldest was, in 1692, a
physician in Ipswich. What led to the writing of <hi rend="italic">More
Wonders</hi> he has himself told us in his book. It remains only to testify to
the care and exactness which all comparison of his work with the records seems
to show, and to remark that to a student of the literature of witchcraft it is evident
that his reading is larger than he cares to parade. Though he clearly belonged to
the popular party, this is as likely to be a result as a cause &mdash; it is probably
neither &mdash; of his feeling on the subject of the witch superstition; and that he
had else any grievance against the Mathers or their colleagues there is no reason
to think.</p>


<p>His book, though completed in 1697, was not printed till 1700, and then
in London. In June, 1698, Cotton Mather records in his diary that &ldquo;a sort
of a Sadducee in this town&rdquo; &ldquo;hath written a Volumn of invented and
notorious lies&rdquo;; &ldquo;this Volumn,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;hee is, as
I understand, sending to England, that it may bee printed there.&rdquo; Why it
found no printer in New England can be guessed; the storm it raised when it
appeared in print is well known. President Increase Mather &ldquo;ordered the
wicked book to be burnt in the college yard,&rdquo; <ref target="n154">[154]</ref> and his son's diary is
eloquent with vexation.</p>


<p>&ldquo;Some Years ago,&rdquo; runs his entry of November 15, 1700,
&ldquo;a very wicked sort of a Sadducee in this Town, raking together a crue of
Libels, which he had written at several Times,

<pb n="294"/>




(especially relating to the <hi rend="italic">Wonders of the Invisible
World</hi> which have been among us) wherein I am the cheef Butt of his
malice, (tho' many other better Servants of the Lord are also most maliciously
abused by him:) he sent this vile Volume to London to be published. Now, tho'
I had often and often cried unto the Lord, that the Cup of this Man's abominable
Bundle of Lies, written on purpose, with a Quil under a special Energy and
Management of Satan, to damnify my precious Opportunities of Glorifying my
Lord Jesus Christ, might pass from me; Yett, in this point, the Lord has denied
my Request: the Book is printed, and the Impression is this week arrived
here.&rdquo;</p>


<p>It was even felt necessary to print a reply; but the two Mathers held it
beneath them to plead in their own vindication. It fell to their parishioners.
&ldquo;My pious neighbours are so provoked,&rdquo; writes Cotton Mather
(December 4), &ldquo;at the diabolical Wickedness of the Man who has
published a Volume of Libels against my Father and myself, that they sett apart
whole Dayes of Prayer, to complain unto God against him.&rdquo; The outcome
of their communings together was a pamphlet called <hi rend="italic">Some
Few Remarks upon a Scandalous Book against the Gospel and Ministry of New
England, written by one Robert Calef</hi>. It was signed by seven, one of
them John Goodwin; but the materials were furnished by their pastors. It aimed
however at their personal exculpation, and has small interest for the public
story.<ref target="n155">[155]</ref></p>


<p>The doughty merchant survived the storm. In 1702-1704 he served his
townsmen as an overseer of the poor, in 1707

<pb n="295"/>




was chosen an assessor, in 1710 a tithingman. It was perhaps about this time that
he retired to Roxbury, where in 1707 he had bought a place and where he was
a selectman of the town when, in 1719, death found him. There, in the old burial
ground just opposite his home, a stone still testifies that &ldquo;Here lyes buried
the body of Mr. Robert Calef, aged seventy-one years, died April the Thirteenth,
1719.&rdquo; <ref target="n156">[156]</ref></p>


<p>Calef's book has been five times reprinted: in 1796, at Salem, by William
Carlton (12&deg;, pp. 318); again at Salem, in 1823, a mere reimpression, with
the addition, from the court files, of Giles Corey's examination (12&deg;, pp.
312); in Boston, 1828 (24&deg;, pp. 333), again a reimpression; at Salem, 1861,
edited by Mr. S. P. Fowler, with Cotton Mather's <hi

Witchcraft</hi> (see p. 207); and, more faithfully, in 1866 at Roxbury, as nos.

the editorship of S. G. Drake (see pp. 207-208). The present text follows the

the market (<hi rend="italic">Boston Record Commissioners' Reports</hi>,

(<hi rend="italic">id</hi>., VIII. 45), and gains permission to erect a
house (<hi rend="italic">id</hi>., XI. 68, XXIX. 187); thus, too, in that
year (see plate) he signs himself &ldquo;Ro. Calfe Jnr&rdquo;; thus in 1710
&ldquo;Robert Calfe, Jr.,&rdquo; appears on the rolls of the Artillery Company
(<hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>, XXXVIII. 341);
and it is after his father's death that (see plate) in 1719 to a receipted account, in
1721 to his will, in 1722 to the release of a mortgage, he signed &ldquo;Rob
Calfe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ro: Calfe&rdquo;, &ldquo;Robert Calfe&rdquo; (see the
last two in Drake's <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft Delusion</hi>, II. xxii,
xxiv).</p></note>

<note id="n152"><seg type="note-symbol">[152].</seg> <p>From the author of <hi rend="italic">More Wonders</hi> we have
two unquestionable autographs: (1) his marginalia of 1695 on Cotton Mather's
paper (see below, p. 306, note 1) and (2) a letter of 1700
presenting a copy of his book to the Earl of Bellomont, then governor of
Massachusetts and New York. A page of the former is to be photographed in the
Massachusetts Historical Society's <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for
1913-1914; and the latter (now in the New York Public Library) is reproduced
in full in the <hi rend="italic">Memorial History of Boston</hi> (II. 168).
Specimens of both are given in our own plate; and to these are added (1) the
signature &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; from the report of two appraisers,
October 30, 1693; (2) the signature &ldquo;Robt. Calef&rdquo; from the verdict
of a Boston coroner's jury, January 15, 1696; (3) the same signature, with a line
or two of text in the same hand, from the decision of two arbitrators (Boston,
July 29, 1697); and (4) the last lines and the signature of a paper drawn by
&ldquo;Robt. Calef&rdquo; as a selectman of Roxbury in March, 1717 (?). That
all six specimens are in the same hand, and in a hand different from the younger
Calef's, will hardly be questioned. Is not the older Robert, too, more likely than
the younger to have been an appraiser in 1693, a coroner's juror in 1696, and an
arbiter in 1697? And (though Calef and Calfe were undoubtedly pronounced alike
or nearly so) is it not less probable that the author of <hi rend="italic">More
Wonders</hi> changed the habitual spelling of his signature than that a younger
Robert, if not the author, should thus have distinguished his identity from his
father's? What arguments led the genealogist Stickney to ascribe the book to the
father cannot now be learned: the &ldquo;full statement of the reasons&rdquo;
promised by him to the <hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen.
Register</hi> (see XXX. 461) was, like his genealogy, never published. But,
from an article on &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; by Mr. W. S. Harris in the <hi
rend="italic">Granite Monthly</hi> for 1907 (XXXIX. 157-163), and from
correspondence with its author, it is learned that another student of the Calef
pedigree (Mr. W. W. Lunt, of Hingham, Mass.) has reached that result by a
comparison of handwritings. Mr. Harris, it should be added, quotes the Rev. John
Kelly as saying in a funeral sermon (1808) for Judge John Calfe (b. 1740) of
Hampstead, N. H., that the latter's ancestor (who was the elder Calef, not the
younger) was the author of the book.</p></note>

booklet turn to the works of Upham and Poole mentioned on p. 91; and in his

one Robert Calef, who presumes to call himself Merchant of Boston.&rdquo;
&ldquo;It was highly rejoicing to us,&rdquo; add the writers, &ldquo;when we
heard that our Booksellers were so well acquainted with the Integrity of our
Pastors, as that not one of them could admit of any of those Libels to be vended
in their shops.&rdquo; Pp. 34-50 of its seventy-one pages are taken up by a letter
of Cotton Mather to the authors. It was perhaps a passage in Mather's letter that
led &ldquo;E. P.&rdquo; to think Robert Calef a &ldquo;young man&rdquo;;
for those words, in italics and with capital initials, stare from a sentence so
obscure that to a hasty glance Calef, instead of Mather himself, might easily seem
to be meant.</p></note>

Harris, which has a photograph of the gravestone. From these mentions will be
learned also the name of his wife, Mary, and of the two of his eight children who
were born (1688, 1691) after his coming to Boston. It will be learned, too, that
in 1692 he was a constable, in 1694 hayward and fenceviewer, in 1697 a
surveyor of highways, in 1698 a clerk of the market. At least it is to
&ldquo;Robert Calef,&rdquo; not to &ldquo;Robert Calef, Jr.,&rdquo; that the
records award these offices. And it is perhaps to be noticed that while the name
of &ldquo;Robert Calef&rdquo; is often preceded by &ldquo;Mr.&rdquo;, that
title does not appear before that of &ldquo;Robert Calef, Jr.&rdquo;</p></note>

<salute><hi rend="italic">Gentlemen</hi>,</salute>
</opener>

<p>You that are freed from the Slavery of a corrupt Education; and that in
spite of human Precepts, Examples and Presidents,<ref target="n160">[160]</ref> can hearken to the Dictates
of Scripture and Reason:</p>


<pb n="297"/>

<p>For your sakes I am content, that these Collections of mine, as also my
Sentiments should be exposed to publick view; In hopes that having well
considered, and compared them with Scripture, you will see reason, as I do, to
question a belief so prevalent (as that here treated of) as also the practice flowing
from thence; they standing as nearly connext as cause and effect; it being found
wholly impracticable, to extirpate the latter without first curing the former.</p>


<p>And if the Buffoon or Satyrical will be exercising their Talents, or if the
Biggots wilfully and blindly reject the Testimonies of their own Reason, and more
sure word, it is no more than what I expected from them.</p>


<p>But you Gentlemen, I doubt not, are willing to Distinguish between Truth
and Error, and if this may be any furtherance to you herein, I shall not miss my
Aim.</p>


<p>But if you find the contrary, and that my belief herein is any way
Heterodox, I shall be thankful for the Information to any Learned or Reverend
Person, or others, that shall take that pains to inform me better by Scripture, or
sound Reason, which is what I have been long seeking for in this Country in
vain.</p>


<p>In a time when not only England in particular, but almost all Europe had
been labouring against the Usurpations of Tyranny and Slavery, The English
America has not been behind in a share in the Common calamities; more
especially New-England has met not only with such calamities as are common to
the rest, but with several aggravations enhansing such Afflictions, by the
Devastations and Cruelties of the Barbarous Indians in their Eastern borders,
etc.</p>


<p>But this is not all, they have been harrast (on many accounts) by a more
dreadful Enemy, as will herein appear to the considerate.</p>


<p>P. 66.<ref target="n161">[161]</ref> Were it as we are told in <hi rend="italic">Wonders of the
Invisible World</hi>, that the Devils were walking about our Streets with

<pb n="298"/>




lengthned Chains making a dreadful noise in our Ears, and Brimstone, even
without a Metaphor, was making a horrid and a hellish stench in our
Nostrils,</p>


<p>P. 49. And that the Devil exhibiting himself ordinarily as a
black-Man,<ref target="n162">[162]</ref>
had decoy'd a fearful knot of Proud, Froward, Ignorant, Envious and Malitious
Creatures, to list themselves in his horrid Service, by entring their Names in a
Book tendered unto them; and that they have had their Meetings and Sacraments,
and associated themselves to destroy the Kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ, in
these parts of the World; having each of them their Spectres, or Devils
Commissionated by them, and representing of them, to be the Engines of their
Malice, by these wicked Spectres siezing poor People about the Country with
various and bloody Torments. And of those evidently preternatural Torments
some to[o] have died. And that they have bewitched some even so far, as to make
them self destroyers, and others in many Towns here and there languish'd under
their evil hands. The People thus afflicted miserably scratch'd and bitten; and that
the same Invisible Furies did stick Pins in them, and scald them, distort and
disjoint them, with a Thousand other Plagues; and sometimes drag them out of
their Chambers, and carry them over Trees and Hills Miles together, many of
them being tempted to sign the Devils Laws.</p>


<p>P. 7[0]. These furies whereof several have killed more People perhaps than
would serve to make a Village.<ref target="n163">[163]</ref></p>


<p>If this be the true state of the Afflictions of this Country, it is very
deplorable, and beyond all other outward Calamities miserable. But if on the
other side, the Matter be as others do understand it, That the Devil has been too
hard for us by his Temptations, signs, and lying Wonders, with the help of
pernicious notions, formerly imbibed and professed; together with the Accusations
of a parcel of possessed, distracted, or lying Wenches, accusing their Innocent
Neighbours, pretending they see their Spectres (<hi rend="italic">i.
e</hi>.) Devils in their likeness Afflicting of them, and that God in righteous
Judgment (after Men

<pb n="299"/>




had ascribed his Power to Witches, of Commissionating Devils to do these things)
may have given them over to strong delusions to believe lyes, etc. And to let
loose the Devils of Envy, Hatred, Pride, Cruelty, and Malice against each other;
yet still disguised under the Mask of Zeal for God, and left them to the branding
one another with the odious Name of Witch; and upon the Accusation of those
above mentioned, Brother to Accuse and Prosecute Brother, Children their
Parents, Pastors and Teachers their immediate Flock unto death; Shepherds
becoming Wolves, Wise Men Infatuated; People hauled to Prisons, with a bloody
noise pursuing to, and insulting over, the (true) Sufferers at Execution, while
some are fleeing from that call'd Justice, Justice it self fleeing before such
Accusations, when once it did but begin to refrain further proceedings, and to
question such Practises, some making their Escape out of Prisons, rather than by
an obstinate Defence of their Innocency, to run so apparent hazard of their Lives;
Estates seized, Families of Children and others left to the Mercy of the
Wilderness (not to mention here the Numbers prescribed,<ref target="n164">[164]</ref> dead in Prisons, or
Executed, etc.)</p>


<p>All which Tragedies, tho begun in one Town, or rather by one Parish, has
Plague-like spread more than through that Country. And by its Eccho giving a
brand of Infamy to this whole Country, throughout the World,</p>


<p>If this were the Miserable case of this Country in the time thereof, and that
the Devil had so far prevailed upon us in our Sentiments and Actions, as to draw
us from so much as looking into the Scriptures for our guidance in these
pretended Intricacies, leading us to a trusting in blind guides, such as the corrupt
practices of some other Countries, or the bloody Experiments of Bodin, and such
other Authors &mdash; Then tho our Case be most miserable, yet it must be said
of New-England, Thou has destroyed thy self, and brought this greatest of
Miseries upon thee.</p>


<p>And now whether the Witches (such as have made a compact by Explicit
Covenant with the Devil, having thereby obtained a power to Commissionate him)
have been the cause of our miseries,</p>


<p>Or whether a Zeal governed by blindness and passion, and

<pb n="300"/>




led by president, has not herein precipitated us into far greater wickedness (if not
Witchcrafts) than any have been yet proved against those that suffered,</p>


<p>To be able to distinguish aright in this matter, to which of these two to
refer our Miseries is the present Work. As to the former, I know of no sober
Man, much less Reverend Christian, that being ask'd dares affirm and abide by
it, that Witches have that power; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> to
Commissionate Devils to kill and destroy. And as to the latter, it were well if
there were not too much of truth in it, which remains to be demonstrated.</p>


<p>But here it will be said, what need of Raking in the Coals that lay buried
in oblivion. We cannot recall those to Life again that have suffered, supposing it
were unjustly; it tends but to the exposing the Actors, as if they had proceeded
irregularly.</p>


<p>Truly I take this to be just as the Devil would have it, so much to fear
disobliging men, as not to endeavour to detect his Wiles, that so he may the
sooner, and with the greater Advantages set the same on foot again (either here
or else where) so dragging us through the Pond twice by the same
Cat.<ref target="n165">[165]</ref> And if
Reports do not (herein) deceive us, much the same has been acting this present
year in Scotland.<ref target="n166">[166]</ref> And what Kingdom or Country is it, that has not had their
bloody fits and turns at it. And if this is such a catching disease, and so universal,
I presume I need make no Apology for my Endeavours to prevent, as far as in
my power, any more such bloody Victims or Sacrifices; tho indeed I had rather
any other would

<pb n="301"/>




have undertaken so offensive, tho necessary a task; yet all things weighed, I had
rather thus Expose my self to Censure, than that it should be wholly omitted.
Were the notions in question innocent and harmless, respecting the Glory of God,
and well being of Men, I should not have engaged in them, but finding them in
my esteem so intollerably destructive of both, This together with my being by
Warrant called before the Justices, in my own Just Vindication, I took it to be a
call from God, to my Power,<ref target="n167">[167]</ref> to Vindicate his Truths, against the Pagan and
Popish Assertions, which are so prevalent; for tho Christians in general do own
the Scriptures to be their only Rule of Faith and Doctrine, yet these Notions will
tell us, that the Scriptures have not sufficiently, nor at all described the crime of
Witchcraft, whereby the culpable might be detected, tho it be positive in the
Command to punish it by Death; hence the World has been from time to time
perplext in the prosecution of the several Diabolical mediums of Heathenish and
Popish Invention, to detect an Imaginary Crime (not but that there are Witches,
such as the Law of God describes) which has produced a deluge of Blood; hereby
rendering the Commands of God not only void but dangerous.</p>


<p>So also they own Gods Providence and Government of the World, and that
Tempests and Storms, Afflictions and Diseases, are of his sending; yet these
Notions tell us, that the Devil has the power of all these, and can perform them
when commission'd by a Witch thereto, and that he has a power at the Witches
call to act and do, without and against the course of Nature, and all natural
causes, in afflicting and killing of Innocents; and this is that so many have died
for.</p>


<p>Also it is generally believed, that if any Man has strength, it is from God
the Almighty Being: But these notions will tell us, that the Devil can make one
Man as strong as many, which was one of the best proofs, as it was counted,
against Mr. Burroughs the Minister;<ref target="n168">[168]</ref> tho his contemporaries in the Schools
during his Minority could have testified, that his strength was then as much
superiour to theirs as ever (setting aside incredible Romances) it was discovered
to be since. Thus rendring the power of God, and his providence of none
Effect.</p>


<pb n="302"/>


<p>These are some of the destructive notions of this Age, and however the
asserters of them seem sometimes to value themselves much upon sheltring their
Neighbours from Spectral Accusations, They may deserve as much thanks as that
Tyrant, that having industriously obtained an unintelligible charge against his
Subjects, in matters wherein it was impossible they should be Guilty, having
thereby their lives in his power, yet suffers them of his meer Grace to live, and
will be call'd gracious Lord.</p>


<p>It were too Icarian<ref target="n169">[169]</ref> a task for one unfurnish'd with necessary learning, and
Library, to give any Just account, from whence so great delusions have sprung,
and so long continued. Yet as an Essay from those scraps of reading that I have
had opportunity of, it will be no great venture to say, that Signs and Lying
Wonders have been one principal cause.<ref target="n170">[170]</ref></p>


<p>It is written of Justin Martyr, who lived in the second Century, that he was
before his conversion a great Philosopher; first in the way of the Stoicks, and
after of the Peripateticks, after that of the Pythagorean, and after that of the
Platonists sects; and after all proved of Eminent use in the Church of Christ; Yet
a certain Author speaking of one Apollonius Tyaneus<ref target="n171">[171]</ref> has these words,
&ldquo;That the most Orthodox themselves began to deem him vested with power
sufficient for a Deity; which occasioned that so strange a doubt from Justin
Martyr, as cited by the learned Gregory, Fol.
37.,<ref target="n172">[172]</ref> etc. If God be the Creator
and Lord of the World, how comes it to pass that Apollonius his
Telisms,<ref target="n173">[173]</ref> have
so much over-ruled the course of things! for we see that they also have stilled the
Waves of the Sea, and the raging of the Winds, and prevailed against the
Noisome Flies, and Incursions of wild Beasts,&rdquo; etc. If so Eminent and
Early a Christian were by these false shews in such doubt, it is the less wonder
in our

<pb n="303"/>




depraved times, to meet with what is Equivalent thereto: Besides this a certain
Author informs me, that &ldquo;Julian (afterwards called the Apostate) being
instructed in the Philosophy and Disciplines of the Heathen, by
Libarius<ref target="n174">[174]</ref> his
Tutor, by this means he came to love Philosophy better than the Gospel, and so
by degrees turn'd from Christianity to Heathenism.&rdquo;</p>


<p>This same Julian did, when Apostate, forbid that Christians should be
instructed in the Discipline of the Gentiles, which (it seems) Socrates a Writer of
the Ecclesiastical History, does acknowledge to be by the singular Providence of
God; Christians having then begun to degenerate from the Gospel, and to betake
themselves to Heathenish learning. And in the <hi
rend="italic">Mercury</hi> for the Month of February, 1695, there is this
Account, &ldquo;That the Christian Doctors conversing much with the writings
of the Heathen, for the gaining of Eloquence, A Counsel<ref target="n175">[175]</ref> was held at Carthage,
which forbad the reading of the Books of the Gentiles.&rdquo;</p>


<p>From all which it may be easily perceived, that in the Primitive times of
Christianity, when not only many Heathen of the Vulgar, but also many learn'd
Men and Philosophers had imbraced the Christian Faith, they still retained a love
to their Heathen-learning, which as one observes being transplanted into a
Christian soile, soon proved productive of pernicious weeds, which over-ran the
face of the Church, hence it was so deformed as the Reformation found it.</p>


<p>Among other pernicious Weeds arising from this Root, the Doctrine of the
power of Devils and Witchcraft as it is now, and long has been understood, is not
the least; the Fables of Homer, Virgil, Horace and Ovid, etc., being for the
Elegancy of their Language retained then (and so are to this day) in the schools,
have not only introduced, but established such Doctrines to the poisoning the
Christian World. A certain Author Expresses it thus, &ldquo;that as the Christian
Schools at first brought Men from Heathenism to the Gospel, so these Schools
carry Men from the Gospel to Heathenism, as to their great perfection,&rdquo;
and Mr. I. M.<ref target="n176">[176]</ref> in his <hi rend="italic">Remarkable Providences</hi>,
gives an account that (as he calls it) an Old Counsel<ref target="n177">[177]</ref> did

<pb n="304"/>




Anathematize all those that believed such power of the Devils, accounting it a
Damnable Doctrine. But as other Evils did afterwards increase in the Church
(partly by such Education) so this insensibly grew up with them, tho not to that
degree, as that any Counsel<ref target="n178">[178]</ref> I have ever heard or Read of has to this day taken
off those Anathema's; yet after this the Church so far declined, that Witchcraft
became a Principal Ecclesiastical Engine (as also that of Heresie was) to root up
all that stood in their way; and besides the ways of Tryal that we have still in
practice, they invented some, which were peculiar to themselves; which when
ever they were minded to improve against any Orthodox believer, they could
easily make Effectual: That Deluge of Blood which that Scarlet
Whore<ref target="n179">[179]</ref> has to
answer for, shed under this notion, how amazing is it.</p>


<p>The first in England that I have read of, of any note since the Reformation,
that asserts this Doctrine, is the famous Mr. Perkins,<ref target="n180">[180]</ref> he (as also Mr. Gaul,<ref target="n181">[181]</ref> and
Mr. Bernard,<ref target="n182">[182]</ref> etc. seems all of them to have undertaken one Task, they) taking
notice of the Multiplicity of irregular ways to try them by, invented by Heathen
and Papists, made it their business and main work herein to oppose such as they
saw to be pernicious. And if they did not look more narrowly into it, but
followed the first, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Mr. Perkins whose Education
(as theirs also) had

<pb n="305"/>




forestall'd him into such belief, whom they readily followed, it cannot be
wondered at: And that they were men liable to Err, and so not to be trusted to as
perfect guides, will manifestly appear to him that shall see their several receits
laid down to detect them by their Presumptive and Positive ones. And consider
how few of either have any foundation in Scripture or Reason; and how vastly
they differ from each other in both, each having his Art by himself, which Forty
or an Hundred more may as well imitate, and give theirs, <hi
rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>, being without all manner of proof.</p>


<p>But tho this be their main design to take off People from those Evil and
bloody ways of trial which they speak so much against, Yet this does not hinder
to this day, but the same evil ways or as bad are still used to detect them by, and
that even among Protestants; and is so far Justified, that a Reverend Person has
said lately here, how else shall we detect Witches? And another being urged to
prove by Scripture such a sort of Witch as has power to send Devils to kill men,
replied, that he did as firmly believe it as any article of his Faith. And that he
(the Inquirer) did not go to the Scripture, to learn the Mysteries of his trade or
Art. What can be said more to Establish there Heathenish notions and to villifie
the Scriptures, our only Rule; and that after we have seen such dire effects
thereof, as has threatned the utter Extirpation of this whole Country.</p>


<p>And as to most of the Actors in these Tragedies, tho they are so far from
defending their Actions that they will Readily own, that undue steps have been
taken, etc., Yet it seems they choose that the same should be Acted over again
inforced by their Example, rather than that it should Remain as a Warning to
Posterity, wherein they have mist it. So far are they from giving Glory to God,
and taking the due shame to themselves.</p>


<p>And now to sum up all in a few words, we have seen a Biggotted Zeal,
stirring up a Blind and most Bloody rage, not against Enemies, or Irreligious
Proffligate Persons, But (in Judgment of Charity, and to view) against as
Vertuous and Religious as any they have left behind them in this Country, which
have suffered as Evil doers with the utmost extent of rigour (not that so high a
Charactor is due to all that Suffered)

<pb n="306"/>




and this by the Testimony of Vile Varlets as not only were known before, but
have been further apparent since by their Manifest Lives, Whordoms, Incest, etc.
The Accusations of these, from their Spectral Sight, being the chief Evidence
against those that Suffered. In which Accusations they were upheld by both
Magistrates and Ministers, so long as they Apprehended themselves in no
Danger.</p>


<p>And then tho they could defend neither the Doctrine, nor the Practice, yet

either; tho at the same time they could not but be sensible what a Stain and
lasting Infamy they have brought upon the whole Country, to the Indangering the

not, to an intailing the Guilt of all the Righteous Blood that has been by the same

have so far justified, occasioning the great Dishonour and Blasphemy of the
Name of God, Scandalizing the Heathen, hardning of Enemies; and as a Natural

are for Substance the same I sent, tho with some small Variation or Addition.
Touching the two Letters from a Gentleman, at his request I have forborn naming
him. It is great Pity the matters of Fact, and indeed the whole, had not been done
by some abler hand better Accomplished and Advantaged with both natural and
acquired Judgments, but others not Appearing, I have inforc'd my self to do what
is done, my other occasions Will not admit any further Scrutiny therein.</p>

<p>I now lay before you a very Entertaining Story, a Story which relates yet
more Wonders of the Invisible World,<ref target="n186">[186]</ref> a Story which tells the Remarkable
Afflictions and Deliverance of one that had been Prodigiously handled by the Evil
Angels. I was my self a daily Eye Witness to a large part of these Occurrences,
and there may be produced Scores of Substantial Witnesses to the most of them;
yea, I know not of any one Passage of the Story, but what may be sufficiently
Attested. I do not Write it with a design of throwing it presently into the Press,
but only to preserve the Memory of such Memorable things, the forgetting
whereof would neither be pleasing to God, nor useful to Men; as also to give
you, with some others of peculiar and obliging Friends, a sight of some
Curiosities, and I hope this Apologie will serve to Excuse me, if I mention, as
perhaps I may, when I come to a tenth Paragraph in my Writing,<ref target="n187">[187]</ref> some things
which I would have omitted in a farther Publication.</p>

rare, had perhaps never a great circulation (in 1692 Increase Mather declares it,
like Gaule's book, &ldquo;rare to be had&rdquo;); but its rules for the detection
of witches gained much vogue from their adoption by Michael Dalton into his

<head><hi rend="italic">Section I. The Afflictions of Margaret Rule.</hi></head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">Within</hi> these few years there died in the
Southern Parts a Christian Indian, who notwithstanding some of his Indian
Weakness, had something of a better Character of vertue and Goodness, than
many of our People can allow to most of their Countrey-men, that profess the
Christian Religion. He had been a Zealous Preacher of the Gospel to his
Neighbour-hood, and a sort of Overseer, or Officer, to whose Conduct was owing
very much of what good order was maintained among those Proselited Savages:
This Man returning home from the Funeral of his Son, was Complemented by an
English-Man, expressing Sorrow for his Loss; now, tho' the Indians use, upon
the Death of Relations, to be the most Passionate and Outragious Creatures in the
World, yet this Converted Indian Handsomely and Chearfully repli'd,
&ldquo;Truly I am sorry, and I am not sorry; I am sorry that I have Buried a
dear Son; but I am not sorry that the will of God is done. I know that without the
will of God my Son could not have Died, and I know that the will of God is
allways just and good, and so I am satisfied.&rdquo; Immediately upon this, even
within a few hours, he fell himself Sick of a Disease that quickly kill'd him; in
the time of which Disease he called his Folks about him, earnestly perswading
them to be Sincere in their Praying unto God, and beware of the Drunkenness,
the Idleness, the Lying, whereby so many of that Nation disgrac'd their
Profession of Christianity; adding, that he was ashamed when he thought how
little Service he had hitherto done for God; and that if God would prolong his
Life he would Labour to do better Service, but that he was fully sure he was now
going to the Lord Jesus Christ, who had bought him with his own Precious
Blood; and for his part he long'd to Die that he might be with his Glorious Lord;
and in the mid'st of such passages he gave up

<pb n="309"/>




the Ghost, but in such repute, that the English People of good Fashion did not
think much of Travelling a great way to his Interment. Lest my Reader do now
wonder why I have related this piece of a Story, I will now hasten to abate that
Wonder, by telling that whereto this was intended, but for an Introduction: Know
then that this remarkable Indian being a little before he Died at work in the Wood
making of Tarr, there appeared unto him a Black-Man, of a Terrible aspect, and
more than humane Dimensions, threatning bitterly to kill him if he would not
promise to leave off Preaching as he did to his Countrey-Men, and promise
particularly, that if he Preached any more, he would say nothing of Jesus Christ
unto them. The Indian amaz'd, yet had the courage to answer, I will in spite of
you go on to Preach Christ more than ever I did, and the God whom I serve will
keep me that you shall never hurt me. Hereupon the Apparition abating somewhat
of his fierceness, offered to the Indian a Book of a considerable thickness and a
Pen and Ink, and said, that if he would now set his hand unto that Book, he
would require nothing further of him; but the Man refused the motion with
indignation, and fell down upon his knees into a Fervent and Pious Prayer unto
God for help against the Tempter, whereupon the D&aelig;mon Vanish't.</p>


<p>This is a Story which I would never have tendered unto my Reader, if I had
not Receiv'd it from an honest and useful English Man, who is at this time a
Preacher of the Gospel to the Indians,<ref target="n189">[189]</ref>
nor would the probable<ref target="n190">[190]</ref> Truth of it have
encouraged me to have tendered it, if this also had not been a fit introduction
unto yet a further Narrative.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 2. 'Twas not much above a year or two,
after this Accident (of which no manner of Noise has been made) that there was
a Prodigious descent of Devils upon divers places near the Center of this
Province, wherein some scores of Mis

<pb n="310"/>




erable People were Troubled by horrible appearances of a Black-Man,
accompanied with Spectres, wearing these and those Humane Shapes, who offer'd
them a Book to be by them sign'd, in token of their being Listed for the Service
of the Devil, and upon their denying to do it, they were
Dragoon'd<ref target="n191">[191]</ref> with a
thousand Preternatural Torments, which gave no little terror to the beholders of
these unhappy Energuments.<ref target="n192">[192]</ref> There was one in the North part of Boston seized
by the Evil-Angels many Months after the General Storm of the late Inchantments
was over, and when the Countrey had long lain pretty quiet, both as to
Molestations and Accusations from the <hi rend="italic">Invisible
World</hi>, her Name was Margaret Rule, a Young Woman. She was born of
sober and honest Parents, yet Living, but what her own Character was before her
Visitation, I can speak with the less confidence of exactness, because I observe
that wherever the Devils have been let loose to worry any Poor Creature amongst
us, a great part of the Neighbourhood presently set themselves to inquire and
relate all the little Vanities of their Childhood, with such unequal exaggerations,
as to make them appear greater Sinners than any whom the Pilate of Hell has not
yet Preyed upon: But it is affirm'd, that for about half a year before her
Visitation, she was observably improved in the hopeful symptoms of a new
Creature; She was become seriously concern'd for the everlasting Salvation of her
Soul, and careful to avoid the snares of Evil Company. This Young Woman had
never seen the affliction of Mercy Short, whereof a Narrative has been already
given,<ref target="n193">[193]</ref> and yet about half a year after the glorious and signal deliverance of that
poor Damsel, this Margaret fell into an affliction, marvellous, resembling hers
in almost all the circumstances of it, indeed the Afflictions were so much alike,
that the relation I have given of the one, would almost serve as the full History
of the other, this was to that, little more than the second part to the same Tune,
indeed Margarets case was in several points less remarkable than Mercies, and
in some other things the Entertainment did a little vary.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 3. 'Twas upon the Lords Day the 10th
of September, in the Year 1693, that Margaret Rule, after some hours of previous
disturbance in the Publick Assembly, fell into odd

<pb n="311"/>




Fits, which caused her Friends to carry her home, where her Fits in a few hours
grew into a Figure that satisfied the Spectators of their being preternatural; some
of the Neighbours were forward enough to suspect the rise of this Mischief in an
House hard-by, where lived a Miserable Woman, who had been formerly
Imprisoned on the suspicion of Witchcraft, and who had frequently Cured very
painfull Hurts by muttering over them certain Charms, which I shall not indanger
the Poysoning of my Reader by repeating. This Woman had the Evening before
Margaret fell into her Calamities, very bitterly treated her, and threatn'd her; but
the hazard of hurting a poor Woman that might be innocent, notwithstanding
Surmizes that might have been more strongly grounded than those, caus'd the
pious People in the Vicinity to try rather whether incessant Supplication to God
alone, might not procure a quicker and safer Ease to the Afflicted, than hasty
Prosecution of any suppos'd Criminal, and accordingly that unexceptionable
course was all that was ever followed; yea, which I look't on as a token for good,
the Afflicted Family was as averse as any of us all to entertain thoughts of any
other course.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 4. The Young Woman was assaulted by
Eight cruel Spectres, whereof she imagin'd that she knew three or four, but the
rest came still with their Faces cover'd, so that she could never have a
distinguishing view of the countenance of those whom she thought she knew; she
was very careful of my reitterated charges to forbear blazing the Names, lest any
good Person should come to suffer any blast of Reputation thro' the cunning
Malice of the great Accuser; nevertheless having since privately named them to
my self, I will venture to say this of them, that they are a sort of Wretches who
for these many years have gone under as Violent Presumptions of Witchcraft, as
perhaps any creatures yet living upon Earth; altho' I am farr from thinking that
the Visions of this Young Woman were Evidence enough to prove them so. These
cursed Spectres now brought unto her a Book about a Cubet long, a Book Red
and thick, but not very broad, and they demanded of her that she would set her
Hand to that Book, or touch it at least with her Hand, as a Sign of her becoming
a Servant of the Devil; upon her peremptory refusal to do what they asked, they
did not after renew the profers of the

<pb n="312"/>




Book unto her, but instead thereof, they fell to Tormenting of her in a manner too
Hellish to be sufficiently described, in those Torments confining her to her Bed,
for just Six weeks together.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 5. Sometimes, but not always, together
with the Spectres there look't in upon the Young Woman (according to her
account) a short and a Black Man, whom they call'd their Master, a Wight
exactly of the same Dimensions and Complexion and voice, with the Divel that
has exhibited himself unto other infested People, not only in other parts of this
Country but also in other Countrys, even of the European World, as the relation
of the Enchantments there inform us, they all profest themselves Vassals of this
Devil, and in obedience unto him they address themselves unto various ways of
Torturing her; accordingly she was cruelly pinch't with Invisible hands very often
in a Day, and the black and blew marks of the pinches became immediately
visible unto the standers by. Besides this, when her attendants had left her without
so much as one pin about her, that so they might prevent some fear'd
inconveniencies; yet she would ever now and then be miserably hurt with Pins
which were found stuck into her Neck, Back and Arms, however, the Wounds
made by the Pins would in a few minutes ordinarily be cured; she would also be
strangely distorted in her Joynts, and thrown into such exorbitant Convulsions as
were astonishing unto the Spectators in General; They that could behold the
doleful condition of the poor Family without sensible compassions, might have
Intrals indeed, but I am sure they could have no true Bowels in them.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 6. It were a most Unchristian and
uncivil, yea a most unreasonable thing to imagine that the Fitt's of the Young
Woman were but meer Impostures: And I believe scarce any, but People of a
particular Dirtiness, will harbour such an Uncharitable Censure; however,
because I know not how far the Devil may drive the Imagination of poor
Creatures when he has possession of them, that at another time when they are
themselves would scorn to Dissemble any thing, I shall now confine my Narrative
unto passages, wherein there could be no room left for any Dissimulation. Of
these the first that I'll mention shall be this; From the time that Margaret Rule

<pb n="313"/>




first found herself to be formally besieged by the Spectres untill the Ninth Day
following, namely from the Tenth of September to the Eighteenth, she kept an
entire Fast, and yet she was unto all appearance as Fresh, as Lively, as Hearty,
at the Nine Days End, as before they began; in all this time, tho' she had a very
eager Hunger upon her Stomach, yet if any refreshment were brought unto her,
her Teeth would be set, and she would be thrown into many Miseries, Indeed
once or twice or so in all this time, her Tormentors permitted her to swallow a
Mouthful of somewhat that might encrease her Miseries, whereof a Spoonful of
Rum was the most considerable; but otherwise, as I said, her Fast unto the Ninth
day was very extream and rigid: However, afterwards there scarce passed a day
wherein she had not liberty to take something or other for her Sustentation, And
I must add this further, that this business of her Fast was carried so, that it was
impossible to be dissembled without a Combination of Multitudes of People
unacquainted with one another to support the Juggle, but he that can imagine such
a thing of a Neighbourhood so fill'd with Vertuous People is a base man, I cannot
call him any other.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 7. But if the Sufferings of this Young
Woman were not Imposture, yet might they not be pure Distemper? I will not
here inquire of our Saducees, what sort of Distemper 'tis shall stick the Body full
of Pins, without any Hand that could be seen to stick them; or whether all the
Pin-makers in the World would be willing to be Evaporated into certain ill habits
of Body producing a Distemper, but of the Distemper my Reader shall be Judge
when I have told him something further of those unusual Sufferings. I do believe
that the Evil Angels do often take Advantage from Natural Distempers in the
Children of Men to annoy them with such further Mischiefs as we call
preternatural. The Malignant Vapours and Humours of our Diseased Bodies may
be used by Devils thereinto insinuating as engine of the Execution of their Malice
upon those Bodies; and perhaps for this reason one Sex may suffer more Troubles
of some kinds from the Invisible World than the other, as well as for that reason
for which the Old Serpent made where he did his first Address. But I Pray what
will you say to this, Margaret Rule would sometimes have her Jaws for

<pb n="314"/>




cibly pulled open, whereupon something Invisible would be poured down her
Throat; we all saw her swallow, and yet we saw her try all she could by Spitting,
Coughing and Shriking,<ref target="n194">[194]</ref> that she might not swalow, but one time the standers by
plainly saw something of that odd Liquor it self on the outside of her Neck; She
cried out of it as of Scalding Brimstone poured into her, and the whole House
would Immediately scent so hot of Brimstone that we were scarce able to endure
it, whereof there are scores of Witnesses; but the Young Woman her self would
be so monstrously Inflam'd that it would have broke a Heart of Stone to have
seen her Agonies. This was a thing that several times happen'd and several times
when her Mouth was thus pull'd open, the standers by clapping their Hands close
thereupon the distresses that otherwise followed would be diverted. Moreover
there was a whitish powder to us Invisible somtimes cast upon the Eyes of this
Young Woman, whereby her Eyes would be extreamly incommoded, but one time
some of this Powder was fallen actually Visible upon her Cheek, from whence
the People in the Room wiped it with their Handkerchiefs, and somtimes the
Young Woman would also be so bitterly scorched with the unseen Sulphur thrown
upon her, that very sensible Blisters would be raised upon her Skin, whereto her
Friends found it necessary to apply the Oyl's proper for common Burning, but the
most of these Hurts would be cured in two or three days at farthest: I think I may
without Vanity pretend to have read not a few of the best System's of Physick
that have been yet seen in these American Regions, but I must confess that I have
never yet learned the Name of the Natural Distemper, whereto these odd
symptoms do belong: However I might suggest perhaps many a Natural Medicine,
which would be of singular use against many of them.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 8. But there fell out some other matters
far beyond the reach of Natural Distemper: This Margaret Rule once in the
middle of the Night Lamented sadly that the Spectres threatned the Drowning of
a Young Man in the Neighbourhood, whom she named unto the Company: well
it was afterwards found that at that very time this Young Man, having been prest
on Board a Man of War then in the Harbour, was

<pb n="315"/>




out of some dissatisfaction attempting to swim ashoar, and he had been Drowned
in the attempt, if a Boat had not seasonably taken him up; it was by computation
a minute or two after the Young Womans discourse of the Drowning, that the
Young Man took the Water. At another time she told us that the Spectres bragg'd
and laughed in her hearing about an exploit they had lately done, by stealing from
a Gentleman his Will soon after he had written it; and within a few hours after
she had spoken this there came to me a Gentleman with a private complaint, that
having written his Will it was unaccountably gone out of the way, how or where
he could not Imagine; and besides all this, there were wonderful Noises every
now and then made about the Room, which our People could Ascribe to no other
Authors but the Spectres, yea, the Watchers affirm that they heard those fiends
clapping of their hands together with an Audibleness, wherein they could not be
Imposed upon: And once her Tormentors pull'd her up to the Cieling of the
Chamber, and held her there before a very Numerous Company of Spectators,
who found it as much as they could all do to pull her down again. There was also
another very surprising circumstance about her, agreeable to what we have not
only Read in several Histories concerning the Imps that have been Imployed in
Witchcraft; but also known in some of our own afflicted: We once thought we
perceived something stir upon her Pillow at a little distance from her, whereupon
one present laying his hand there, he to his horror apprehended that he felt, tho'
none could see it, a living Creature, not altogether unlike a Rat, which nimbly
escap'd from him: and there were diverse other Persons who were thrown into
a great consternation by feeling, as they Judg'd, at other times the same Invisible
Animal.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 9. As it has been with a Thousand other
Inchanted People, so it was with Margaret Rule in this particular, that there were
several words which her Tormentors would not let her hear, especially the words
Pray or Prayer, and yet she could so hear the letters of those words distinctly
mentioned as to know what they ment. The standers by were forced sometimes
thus in discourse to spell a word to her, but because there were some so
ridiculous as to count it a sort of Spell or a Charm for any thus to accommodate
themselves to the

<pb n="316"/>




capacity of the Sufferer, little of this kind was done. But that which was more
singular in this matter, was that she could not use these words in those
penetrating discourses, wherewith she would sometimes address the Spectres that
were about her. She would sometimes for a long while together apply herself to
the Spectres, whom she supposed the Witches, with such Exhortations to
Repentance as would have melted an Heart of Adamant to have heard them; her
strains of Expression and Argument were truly Extraordinary; A person perhaps
of the best Education and Experience and of Attainments much beyond hers could
not have exceeded them: nevertheless when she came to these Words God, Lord,
Christ, Good, Repent, and some other such, her Mouth could not utter them,
whereupon she would somtimes in an Angry Parenthesis complain of their
Wickedness in stopping that Word, but she would then go on with some other
Terms that would serve to tell what she ment. And I believe that if the most
suspicious Person in the world had beheld all the Circumstances of this matter,
he would have said it could not have been dissembled.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 10. Not only in the Swedish, but also
in the Salem Witchcraft the Inchanted People have talked much of a White Spirit
from whence they received marvellous Assistances in their Miseries; what lately
befel Mercy Short from the Communications of such a Spirit, hath been the just
Wonder of us all, but by such a Spirit was Margaret Rule now also visited. She
says that she could never see his Face; but that she had a frequent view of his
bright, Shining and Glorious Garments; he stood by her Bed-side continually
heartning and comforting of her and counselling her to maintain her Faith and
hope in God, and never comply with the temptations of her Adversaries; she says
he told her, that God had permitted her Affictions to befall her for the everlasting
and unspeakable good of her own Soul, and for the good of many others, and for
his own Immortal Glory, and that she should therefore be of good Chear and be
assured of a speedy deliverance; And the wonderful resolution of mind wherewith
she encountered her Afflictions were but agreeable to such expectations.
Moreover a Minister<ref target="n195">[195]</ref> having one Day with some Importunity Prayed for the
deliverance of this Young Woman, and pleaded

<pb n="317"/>




that she belong'd to his Flock and charge; he had so far a right unto her as that
he was to do the part of a Minister of our Lord for the bringing of her home unto
God; only now the Devil hindred him in doing that which he had a right thus to
do, and whereas He had a better Title unto her to bring her home to God than the
Divel could have unto her to carry her away from the Lord, he therefore humbly
applied himself unto God, who alone could right this matter, with a suit that she
might be rescued out of Satans Hands; Immediatly upon this, tho' she heard
nothing of this transaction she began to call that Minister her Father, and that was
the Name whereby she every day before all sorts of People distinguished him: the
occasion of it she says was this, the white Spirit presently upon this transaction
did after this manner speak to her, &ldquo;Margaret, you now are to take notice
that&rdquo; (such a Man) &ldquo;is your Father, God has given you to him, do
you from this time look upon him as your Father, obey him, regard him as your
Father, follow his Counsels and you shall do well&rdquo;; And tho' there was
one passage more, which I do as little know what to make of as any of the Rest,
I am now going to relate it; more than three times have I seen it fulfilled in the
Deliverance of Inchanted and Possest Persons, whom the Providence of God has
cast into my way, that their Deliverance could not be obtained before the third
Fast kept for them, and the third day still obtain'd the Deliverance, altho' I have
thought of beseeching of the Lord thrice, when buffeted by Satan, yet I must
earnestly Intreat all my Readers to beware of any superstitious conceits upon the
Number Three; if our God will hear us upon once Praying and Fasting before
him 'tis well, and if he will not vouchsafe his Mercy upon our thrice doing so,
yet we must not be so discouraged as to throw by our Devotion but if the
Soveraign Grace of our God will in any particular Instances count our Patience
enough tryed when we have Solemnly waited upon him for any determinate
Number of times, who shall say to him, what doest thou, and if there shall be any
Number of Instances, wherein this Grace of our God has exactly holden the same
course, it may have a room in our humble Observations, I hope, without any
Superstition; I say then that after Margaret Rule had been more than five weeks
in her Miseries, this White Spirit said unto her, &ldquo;Well

<pb n="318"/>




this day such a Man&rdquo; (whom he named<ref target="n196">[196]</ref>) &ldquo;has kept a third day for
your deliverance, now be of good cheer you shall speedily be delivered.&rdquo;
I inquired whether what had been said of that Man were true, and I gained exact
and certain Information that it was precisely so, but I doubt lest in relating this
Passage that I have used more openness than a Friend should be treated with, and
for that cause I have concealed several of the most memorable things that have
occurred not only in this but in some former Histories, altho indeed I am not so
well satisfied about the true nature of this white Spirit, as to count that I can do
a Friend much Honour by reporting what notice this white Spirit may have thus
taken of him.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 11. On the last day of the Week her
Tormentors as she thought and said, approaching towards her, would be forced
still to recoil and retire as unaccountably unable to meddle with her, and they
would retire to the Fire side with their Poppets; but going to stick Pins into those
Poppets, they could not (according to their visions) make the Pins to enter, she
insulted over them with a very Proper derision, daring them now to do their
worst, whilst she had the satisfaction to see their Black Master strike them and
kick them, like an Overseer of so many Negro's, to make them to do their work,
and renew the marks of his vengeance on them, when they failed of doing of it.
At last being as it were tired with their ineffectual Attempts to mortifie her they
furiously said, &ldquo;Well you shant be the last.&rdquo; And after a pause they
added, &ldquo;Go, and the Devil go with you, we can do no more&rdquo;;
whereupon they flew out of the Room and she returning perfectly to her self most
affectionately gave thanks to God for her deliverance; her Tormentors left her
extream weak and faint, and overwhelmed with Vapours, which would not only
cause her sometimes to Swoon away, but also now and then for a little while
discompose the reasonableness of her Thoughts; Nevertheless her former troubles
returned not, but we are now waiting to see the good effects of those troubles
upon the Souls of all concern'd. And now I suppose that some of our Learned
witlings of the Coffee-House, for fear lest these proofs of an Invisible-world
should spoil some of their sport, will endeavour to turn them all into sport, for
which Buffoonary their only

<pb n="319"/>




pretence will be, they cant understand how such things as these could be done,
whereas indeed he that is but Philosopher enough to have read but one Little
Treatise, Published in the Year 1656 by no other Man than the Chyrurgion of an
Army,<ref target="n197">[197]</ref> or but one Chap. of
Helmont,<ref target="n198">[198]</ref> which I will not quote at this time too
particularly, may give a far more intelligible account of these Appearances than
most of these Blades can give why and how their Tobacco makes 'em Spit; or
which way the flame of their Candle becomes illuminating. As for that cavil, the
world would be undone if the Devils could have such power as they seem to have
in several of our stories, it may be Answered that as to many things the Lying
Devils have only known them to be done, and then pretended unto the doing of
those things, but the true and best Answer is, that by these things we only see
what the Devils could have powers to do, if the great God should give them those
powers, whereas now our Histories affords a Glorious Evidence for the being of
a God, the World would indeed be undone, and horribly undone, if these Devils,
who now and then get liberty to play some very mischievous pranks, were not
under a daily restraint of some Almighty Superior from doing more of such
Mischiefs. Wherefore instead of all Apish flouts and jeers at Histories, which
have such undoubted confirmation, as that no Man that has breeding enough to
regard the Common Laws of Humane Society, will offer to doubt of 'em, it
becomes us rather to adore the Goodness of God, who does not permit such
things every day to befall us all, as he sometimes did permit to befall some few
of our miserable Neighbours.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 12. And what, after all my unwearied
Cares and

<pb n="320"/>




Pains, to rescue the Miserable from the Lions and Bears of Hell, which had
siezed them, and after all my Studies to disappoint the Devils in their designs to
confound my Neighbourhood, must I be driven to the necessity of an Apologie?
Truly the hard representations wherewith some Ill Men have reviled my conduct,
and the Countenance which other Men have given to these representations, oblige
me to give Mankind some account of my Behaviour; No Christian can, I say none
but evil workers can criminate my visiting such of my poor flock as have at any
time fallen under the terrible and sensible molestations of Evil-Angels; let their
Afflictions have been what they will, I could not have answered it unto my
Glorious Lord, if I had withheld my just Counsels and Comforts from them; and
if I have also with some exactness observ'd the methods of the Invisible-World,
when they have thus become observable, I have been but a Servant of Mankind
in doing so; yea no less a Person than the Venerable Baxter has more than once
or twice in the most Publick manner invited Mankind to thank me for that
Service.<ref target="n199">[199]</ref> I have not been insensible of a greater danger attending me in this
fulfilment of my Ministry, than if I had been to take Ten Thousand steps over a
Rocky Mountain fill'd with Rattle-Snakes, but I have consider'd, he that is wise
will observe things, and the Surprizing Explication and confirmation of the
biggest part of the Bible, which I have seen given in these things, has abundantly
paid me for observing them. Now in my visiting of the Miserable, I was always
of this opinion that we were Ignorant of what Powers the Devils might have to
do their mischiefs in the shapes of some that had never been explicitly engaged
in Diabolical Confederacies, and that therefore tho' many Witchcrafts had been
fairly detected on Enquiries provoked and begun by Specteral Exhibitions, yet we
could not easily be too jealous<ref target="n200">[200]</ref> of the Snares laid for us in the devices of Satan;
the World knows how many Pages I have Composed and Published, and
particular Gentlemen in the Government know how many Letters I have written
to prevent the excessive Credit of

<pb n="321"/>




Specteral Accusations, wherefore I have still charged the Afflicted that they
should Cry out of no body for Afflicting of 'em. But that if this might be any
Advantage they might privately tell their minds to some one Person of discretion
enough to make no ill use of their communications, accordingly there has been
this effect of it, that the Name of No one good Person in the World ever came
under any blemish by means of any Afflicted Person that fell under my particular
cognisance, yea no one Man, Woman or Child ever came into any trouble for the
sake of any that were Afflicted after I had once begun to look after'em; how
often have I had this thrown into my dish, that many years ago I had an
opportunity to have brought forth such People as have in the late storm of
Witchcraft been complain'd of, but that I smother'd all, and after that storm was
rais'd at Salem, I did myself offer to provide Meat, Drink and Lodging for no
less than Six of the Afflicted, that so an Experiment might be made, whether
Prayer with Fasting upon the removal of the distressed might not put a Period to
the trouble then rising, without giving the Civil Authority the trouble of
prosecuting those things which nothing but a Conscientious regard unto the cries
of Miserable Families, could have overcome the Reluctancies of the Honourable
Judges to meddle with; In short I do humbly but freely affirm it, there is not that
Man living in this World who has been more desirous than the poor Man I to
shelter my Neighbours from the Inconveniencies of Spectral Outcries, yea I am
very jealous I have done so much that way as to Sin in what I have done, such
have been the Cowardize and Fearfulness whereunto my regard unto the
dissatisfactions of other People has precipitated me. I know a Man in the World,
who has thought he has been able to Convict some such Witches as ought to Dye,
but his respect unto the Publick Peace has caused him rather to try whether He
could not renew them by Repentance: And as I have been Studious to defeat the
Devils of their expectations to set people together by the Ears, thus, I have also
checked and quell'd those forbidden curiosities, which would have given the devil
an invitation to have tarried amongst us, when I have seen wonderful Snares laid
for Curious People, by the secret and future things discovered from the Mouths
of Damsels possest with a

<pb n="322"/>




Spirit of divination; Indeed I can recollect but one thing wherein there could be
given so much as a Shadow of Reason for Exceptions, and that is my allowing
of so many to come and see those that were Afflicted, now for that I have this to
say, that I have almost a Thousand times intreated the Friends of the Miserable,
that they would not permit the Intrusion of any Company, but such as by Prayers
or other ways might be helpful to them; Nevertheless I have not absolutely forbid
all Company from coming to your Haunted Chambers, partly because the
Calamities of the Families were such as required the Assistance of many Friends;
partly because I have been willing that there should be disinterested Witnesses of
all sorts, to confute the Calumnies of such as would say all was but Imposture;
and partly because I saw God had Sanctified the Spectacle of the Miseries on the
Afflicted unto the Souls of many that were Spectators, and it is a very Glorious
thing that I have now to mention &mdash; The Devils have with most horrendous
operations broke in upon our Neighbourhood, and God has at such a rate
over-ruled all the Fury and Malice of those Devils, that all the Afflicted have not
only been Delivered, but I hope also savingly brought home unto God, and the
Reputation of no one good Person in the World has been damaged, but instead
thereof the Souls of many, especially of the rising Generation, have been thereby
awaken'd unto some acquaintance with Religion; our young People who belonged
unto the Praying Meetings, of both Sexes, a part would ordinarily spend whole
Nights by the whole Weeks together in Prayers and Psalms upon these occasions,
in which Devotions the Devils could get nothing but like Fools a Scourge for their
own Backs, and some scores of other young People, who were strangers to real
Piety, were now struck with the lively demonstrations of Hell evidently set forth
before their Eyes, when they saw Persons cruelly Frighted, wounded and Starved
by Devils and Scalded with burning Brimstone, and yet so preserved in this
tortured estate as that at the end of one Months wretchedness they were as able
still to undergo another, so that of these also it might now be said, Behold they
Pray in the whole &mdash; The Devil got just nothing; but God got praises, Christ
got Subjects, the Holy Spirit got Temples, the Church got Addition, and the Souls
of Men got everlasting

<pb n="323"/>




Benefits; I am not so vain as to say that any Wisdome or Vertue of mine did
contribute unto this good order of things: But I am so just, as to say I did not
hinder this Good. When therefore there have been those that pickt up little
incoherent scraps and bits of my Discourses in this faithful discharge of my
Ministry, and so traversted<ref target="n201">[201]</ref> 'em in
their abusive Pamphlets,<ref target="n202">[202]</ref> as to perswade the
Town that I was their common Enemy in those very points, wherein, if in any
one thing whatsoever, I have sensibly approved my self as true a Servant unto
'em as possibly I could, tho my Life and Soul had been at Stake for it, Yea to do
like Satan himself, by sly, base, unpretending Insinuations, as if I wore not the
Modesty and Gravity which became a Minister of the Gospel, I could not but
think my self unkindly dealt withal, and the neglects of others to do me justice
in this affair has caused me to conclude this Narrative with complaints in another
hearing of such Monstrous Injuries.<ref target="n203">[203]</ref></p>

<note id="n203"><seg type="note-symbol">[203]</seg> <p>The story of Margaret Rule is told again in Mather's <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> (I. 171 ff.) and in a way that throws fresh light on
his relation to the case.</p><p>&ldquo;About a Week after the Beginning of September, being sollicitous
to do some further Service, for the Name of God, I took a Journey to Salem.
There, I not only sought a further Supply of my Furniture for my
Church-History, but also endeavoured, that the complete History of the late
Witchcrafts and Possessions might not bee lost. I judg'd that the Preservacion of
that History might in a while bee a singular Benefit unto the Church, and unto the
World, which made mee sollicitous about it. Moreover, I was willing to preach
the Word of God unto the numerous Congregation at Salem; which I did, on both
Parts of the Sabbath, not only with a most glorious Assistence of Heaven, but
also with some Assurance of Good thereby to bee done among the People. But
I had one singular Unhappiness, which befel mee, in this Journey. I had largely
written three Discourses, which I designed both to preach at Salem, and hereafter
to print. These Notes were before the Sabbath stolen from mee, with such
Circumstances, that I am somewhat satisfied, The Spectres, or Agents in the
invisible World, were the Robbers. This Diaster had like to have disturbed my
Designs for the Sabbath; but God helped mee to remember a great part of what
I had written, and to deliver also many other Things, which else I had not now
made use of. So that the Divel gott nothing!</p><p>&ldquo;Among
other things which entertained mee at Salem, one was, a
Discourse with one Mrs. Carver, who had been strangely visited with some
shining Spirits, which were good Angels, in her opinion of them.</p><p>&ldquo;She
intimated several things unto mee whereof some were to be
kept secret. Shee also told mee, That a new Storm of Witchcraft would fall upon
the Countrey, to chastise the Iniquity that was used in the wilful Smothering and
Covering of the Last; and that many fierce Opposites to the Discovery of that
Witchcraft would bee thereby convinced.</p><p>&ldquo;Unto my
Surprise, when I came home, I found one of my
Neighbours horribly arrested by evil Spirits. I then beg'd of God, that Hee would
help mee wisely to discharge my Duty upon this occasion, and avoid gratifying
of the evil Angels in any of their Expectations. I did then concern myself to use
and gett as much Prayer as I could for the afflicted young Woman; and at the
same time, to forbid, either her from accusing any of her Neighbours, or others
from enquiring any thing of her. Nevertheless, a wicked Man wrote a most lying
Libel to revile my Conduct in these matters; which drove mee to the Blessed
God, with my Supplications that Hee would wonderfully protect mee, as well
from unreasonable Men acted by the Divels, as from the Divels themselves. I did
at first, it may bee, too much resent the Injuries of that Libel; but God brought
good out of it; it occasioned the Multiplication of my Prayers before Him; it very
much promoted the Works of Humiliation and Mortification in my Soul. Indeed,
the Divel made that Libel an Occasion of those Paroxysms in the Town, that
would have exceedingly gratify'd him, if God had not helped mee to forgive and
forgett the Injuries done unto mee, and to bee deaf unto the Sollicitations of those
that would have had mee so to have resented the Injuries of some few Persons,
as to have deserted the Lecture at the Old Meeting house.</p><p>&ldquo;When the
afflicted young woman had undergone six Weeks of
pr&aelig;ternatural Calamities and when God had helped mee to keep just three
Dayes of Prayer on her behalf, I had the Pleasure of seeing the same Success,
which I used to have, on my third Fast, for such possessed People, as have been
cast into my cares. God gave her a glorious Deliverance; The remarkable
Circumstances whereof, I have more fully related, in an History of the whole
Business.</p><p>&ldquo;As for my
missing Notes, the possessed young Woman, of her own
Accord, enquir'd whether I missed them not? Shee told mee, the Spectres brag'd
in her hearing, that they had rob't mee of them; shee added, Bee n't concern'd;
for they confess, they can't keep them alwayes from you; you shall have them all
brought you again. (They were Notes on Ps. 119. 19 and Ps. 90. 12 and Hag. 1.
7, 9. I was tender of them and often pray'd unto God, that they might bee
return'd.) On the fifth of October following, every Leaf of my Notes again came
into my Hands, tho' they were in eighteen separate Quarters of Sheets. They were
found drop't here and there, about the Streets of Lyn; but how they came to bee
so drop't I cannot imagine; and I as much wonder at the Exactness of their
Pr&aelig;servation.&rdquo;</p><p>And under October 10th
he adds: &ldquo;On this Day, I also visited a
possessed young Woman in the Neighbourhood, whose Distresses were not the
least occasion of my being thus before the Lord. I wrestled with God for her: and
among other things, I pleaded, that God had made it my Office and Business to
engage my Neighbours in the Service of the Lord Jesus Christ; and that this
young Woman had expressed her Compliance with my Invitations unto that
Service; only that the evil Spirits now hindred her from doing what shee had
vowd: and therefore that I had a sort of Right to demand her Deliverance from
these invading Divels, and to demand such a Liberty for her as might make her
capable of glorifying my Glorious Lord; which I did accordingly. In the close of
this Day, a wonderful Spirit, in White and bright Raiment, with a Face unseen,
appeared unto this young woman, and bid her count mee her Father, and regard
mee and obey mee, as her Father; for hee said, the Lord had given her to mee;
and she should now within a few Dayes bee delivered. It proved,
accordingly.&rdquo;</p><p>And again
in December (p. 178): &ldquo;And one memorable Providence,
I must not forgett. A young Woman being arrested, possessed, afflicted by evil
Angels, her Tormentors made my Image or Picture to appear before her, and then
made themselves Masters of her Tongue so far, that she began in her Fits to
complain that I threatened her and molested her, tho' when shee came out of
them, shee own'd, that they could not so much as make my dead Shape do her
any Harm, and that they putt a Force upon her Tongue in her Exclamations. Her
greatest Out-cries when shee was herself, were, for my poor Prayers to be
concerned on her behalf.</p><p>&ldquo;Being
hereupon extremely sensible, how much a malicious Town
and Land would insult over mee, if such a lying Piece of a Story should fly
abroad, that the Divels in my Shape tormented the Neighbourhood, I was putt
upon some Agonies, and singular Salleys and Efforts of Soul, in the Resignation
of my Name unto the Lord; content that if Hee had no further service for my
Name, it should bee torn to pieces with all the Reproches in the world. But I
cried unto the Lord as for the Deliverance of my Name, from the Malice of Hell,
so for the Deliverance of the young Woman, whom the Powers of Hell had now
seized upon. And behold! Without any further Noise, the possessed Person, upon
my praying by her, was delivered from her Captivity, on the very same Day that
shee fell into it; and the whole Plott of the Divel, to reproach a poor Servant of
the Lord Jesus Christ, was defeated.&rdquo;</p></note>

What, do there a great many Witches sit upon you? <hi
rend="italic">Answer</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you
not know that there is a hard Master? Then she was in a Fit; He laid his hand
upon her Face and Nose, but, as he said, without perceiving Breath; then he
brush'd her on the Face with his Glove, and rubb'd her Stomach (her breast not
covered with the Bed-cloaths) and bid others do so too, and said it eased her, then
she revived. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Don't you know there is a hard
Master? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Reply</hi>; Don't serve that hard Master, you know who.
<hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you believe? Then again she was in a Fit,
and he again rub'd her Breast, etc. (about this time Margaret Perd an attendant
assisted him in rubbing of her. The Afflicted spake angerely to her saying don't
you meddle with me, and hastily put away her hand) he wrought his Fingers
before her Eyes and asked her if she saw the Witches? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Do you

<pb n="326"/>




believe? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>.
Do you believe in you know who? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Would you have other people do so too, to believe in
you know who? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Who is it that Afflicts you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. I know not, there is a great many of them (about this
time the Father question'd if she knew the Spectres? An attendant said, if she did
she would not tell; The Son proceeded) <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have
seen the Black-man, hant<ref target="n206">[206]</ref> you? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi
rend="italic">Reply</hi>; I hope you never shall. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. You have had a Book offered you, hant you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. The brushing of
you gives you ease, don't it? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. She turn'd her
selfe and a little Groan'd. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Now the Witches
Scratch you and Pinch you, and Bite you, don't they? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. Then he put his hand upon her Breast and Belly,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> on the Cloaths over her, and felt a Living thing,
as he said, which moved the Father also to feel, and some others; <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Don't you feel the Live thing in the Bed? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. <hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>, that is only
Fancie. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. the great company of People increase
your Torment, don't they? <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. The People
about were desired to withdraw. One Woman said, I am sure I am no Witch, I
will not go; so others, so none withdrew. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. Shall
we go to Prayers? Then she lay in a Fit as before. But this time to revive her,
they waved a Hat and brushed her Head and Pillow therewith. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. Shall we go to <hi rend="italic">Pray</hi>, etc.
Spelling the Word. <hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. The Father went

<pb n="327"/>




to Prayer for perhaps half an Hour, chiefly against the Power of the Devil and
Witchcraft, and that God would bring out the Afflicters: during Prayer-time, the
Son stood by, and when they thought she was in a Fit, rub'd her and brush'd her
as before, and beckned to others to do the like; after Prayer he proceeded; <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. You did not hear when we were at Prayer, did you?
<hi rend="italic">A</hi>. Yes. <hi rend="italic">Q</hi>. You dont
hear always, you dont hear sometimes past a Word or two, do you? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. No. Then turning him about said, this is just another
Mercy Short: Margaret Perd reply'd, she was not like her in her Fits. <hi
rend="italic">Q</hi>. What does she eat or drink? <hi
rend="italic">A</hi>. Not eat at all; but drink Rum. Then he admonished
the young People to take warning, etc. Saying it was a sad thing to be so
Tormented by the Devil and his Instruments: A Young-man present in the habit
of a Seaman, reply'd this is the Devil all over. Than<ref target="n207">[207]</ref> the Ministers withdrew.
Soon after they were gon the Afflicted desired the Women to be gone, saying,
that the Company of the Men was not offensive to her, and having hold of the
hand of a Young-man, said to have been her Sweet-heart formerly, who was
withdrawing; She pull'd him again into his Seat, saying he should not go to
Night.</q>

<p rend="center">September the 19th, 1693.</p>


<q>This Night I renew'd my Visit, and found her rather of a fresher
Countenance than before, about eight Persons present with her, she was in a Fit
Screeming and making a Noise: Three or four Persons rub'd and brush'd her with
their hands, they said that the brushing did put them away, if they brush'd or
rub'd in the right place; therefore they brush'd and rub'd in several places, and
said that when they did it in the right place she could fetch her Breath, and by
that they knew. She being come to her self was soon in a merry talking Fit. A
Young-man came in and ask'd her how she did? She answered very bad, but at
present a little better; he soon told her he must be gon and bid her good Night,
at which she seem'd troubled, saying, that she liked his Company, and said she
would not have him go till she was well; adding, for I shall Die when you are
gon. Then she complained they did not put her on a clean Cap, but let her ly so
like a Beast, saying, she should lose her Fellows. She said she wondered any
People should be so Wicked as to think she was not Afflicted, but to think she
Dissembled. A Young-woman answered Yes, if they were to see you in this
merry Fit, they would say you Dissembled indeed; She reply'd, Mr. M &mdash;
said this was her laughing time, she must laugh now: She said Mr. M &mdash;
had been there this Evening, and she enquired, how long he had been gon? She
said,

<pb n="328"/>




he stay'd alone with her in the room half an Hour, and said that he told her there
were some that came for Spies, and to report about Town that she was not
Afflicted. That during the said time she had no Fit, that he asked her if she knew
how many times he had Prayed for her to Day? And that she answered that she
could not tell; and that he replyed he had Prayed for her Nine times to Day; the
Attendants said that she was sometimes in a Fit that none could open her Joynts,
and that there came an Old Iron-jaw'd Woman and try'd, but could not do it; they
likewise said, that her Head could not be moved from the Pillow; I try'd to move
her head, and found no more difficulty than another Bodies (and so did others)
but was not willing to offend by lifting it up, one being reproved for
endeavouring it, they saying angrily you will break her Neck; The Attendants said
Mr. M &mdash; would not go to Prayer with her when People were in the Room,
as they did one Night, that Night he felt the Live Creature. Margaret Perd and
another said they smelt Brimstone; I and others said we did not smell any; then
they said they did not know what it was: This Margaret said, she wish'd she had
been here when Mr. M &mdash; was here, another Attendant said, if you had
been here you might not have been permitted in, for her own Mother was not
suffered to be present.</q>


<p>Sir, after the sorest Affliction and greatest blemish to Religion that ever

<p>Having expected some Weeks, your meeting me at Mr. Wilkins according
to what you intimated to Mr. J. M. &mdash; <ref target="n210">[210]</ref> and the time draw

<pb n="330"/>




ing near for our meeting elsewhere, I thought it not amiss to give you a Summary
of my thoughts in the great concern, which as you say has been agitated with so
much heat. That there are Witches is not the doubt, the Scriptures else were in
vain, which assign their Punishment to be by Death; But what this Witchcraft is,
or wherein it does consist, seems to be the whole difficulty: And as it may be
easily demonstrated, that all that bear that Name cannot be justly so accounted,
so that some things and Actions not so esteemed by the most, yet upon due
examination will be found to merit no better Character.</p>


<p>In your late Book you lay down a brief Synopsis of what has been written
on that Subject, by a Triumvirate of as Eminent Men as ever handled it (as you
are pleas'd to call them) <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Mr.
Perkins,<ref target="n211">[211]</ref> Gaule,<ref target="n212">[212]</ref>
and Bernard<ref target="n213">[213]</ref> consisting of about 30 Tokens to know them by, many of them
distinct from, if not thwarting each other: Among all of which I can find but one
decisive, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> That of Mr. Gaule, Head IV. and
runs thus; Among the most unhappy Circumstances to convict a Witch, one is a
maligning and oppugning the Word, Work, or Worship of God, and by any
extraordinary Sign seeking to seduce any from it, see Deu. 13. 1, 2. Mat. 24. 24.
Acts. 13. 8, 10. 2 Tim. 3. 8. Do but mark well the places, and for this very
property of thus opposing and perverting, they are all there concluded
<unclear></unclear> and absolute Witches.<ref target="n214">[214]</ref></p>


<p>This Head as here laid down and inserted by you, either is a Truth or not;
if not, why is it here inserted from one of the Triumvirate, if it be a Truth, as the
Scriptures quoted will abundantly testifie, whence is it that it is so little regarded,
tho it be the only Head well proved by Scripture, or that the rest of the
Triumvirate should so far forget their Work as not to mention it. It were to be
unjust to the Memory of those otherwise Wise Men, to suppose them to have any
Sinister design; But perhaps the force of a prevailing opinion, together with an
Education thereto Suited, might over

<pb n="331"/>




shadow their Judgments, as being wont to be but too prevalent in many other
cases. But if the above be Truth, then the Scripture is full and plain, What is
Witchcraft? And if so, what need of his next Head of Hanging of People without
as full and clear Evidence as in other Cases? Or what need of the rest of the
Receipts of the Triumvirate? what need of Praying that the Afflicted may be able
to discover who tis that Afflicts them? or what need of Searching for Tet's for the
Devil to Suck in his Old Age, or the Experiment of saying the Lords Prayer, etc.
Which<ref target="n215">[215]</ref> a multitude more practised in some places Superstitiously inclin'd. Other
Actions have been practised for easing the Afflicted, less justifiable, if not
strongly savouring of Witchcraft it self, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Fondly
Imagining by the Hand, etc., to drive off Spectres, or to knock off Invisible
Chains, or by striking in the Air to Wound either the Afflicted or others, etc. I
write not this to accuse any, but that all may beware believing, That the Devil's
bounds are set, which he cannot pass, That the Devils are so full of Malice, That
it cant be added to by Mankind, That where he hath Power, he neither can nor
will omit Executing it, That 'tis only the Almighty that sets bounds to his rage,
and that only can Commissionate him to hurt or destroy any.</p>


<p>These last, Sir, are such Foundations of Truth, in my esteem, that I cannot
but own it to be my duty to ascert them, when call'd tho' with the hazard of my
All: And consequently to detect such as these, That a Witch can Commissionate
Devils to Afflict Mortals, That he can at his or the Witches pleasure Assume any
Shape, That Hanging or Chaining of Witches can lessen his Power of Afflicting,
or restore those that were at a distance Tormented, with many others depending
on these; all tending, in my esteem, highly to the Dishonour of God, and the
Indangering the well-being of a People, and do further add, that as the Scriptures
are full that there is Witchcraft, (<hi rend="italic">ui sup.</hi>) so 'tis as
plain that there are Possessions, and that the Bodies of the Possest have hence
been not only Afflicted, but strangely agitated, if not their Tongues improved to
foretell futurities, etc. and why not to accuse the Innocent, as bewitching them;
having pretence to Divination to gain credence. This being reasonable to be
expected, from him who is the Father of Lies, to the end he may thereby involve
a Countrey in Blood, Mallice, and Evil, surmising which he greedily seeks after,
and so finally lead them from their fear and dependence upon God to fear him,
and a supposed Witch thereby attaining his end upon Mankind; and not only so,
but Natural Distemper, as has been frequently observed by the Judicious, have
so operated as to deceive, more than the Vulgar, as

<pb n="332"/>




is testified by many Famous Physicians, and others. And as for that proof of
Multitudes of Confessions, this Countrey may be by this time thought Competent
Judges, what credence we ought to give them, having had such numerous
Instances, as also how obtain'd.</p>


<p>And now Sir, if herein be any thing in your esteem valuable, let me intreat
you, not to account it the worse for coming from so mean a hand; which however
you may have receiv'd Prejudices, etc., Am ready to serve you to my Power; but
if you Judge otherwise hereof, you may take your own Methods for my better
Information. Who am, Sir, yours to command, in what I may,</p>

<p>In Answer to this last, Sir, you replyed to the Gentleman that presented
it, that you had nothing to Prosecute against me; and said as to your Sentiments
in your Books, you did not bind any to believe them, and then again renew'd
your promise of meeting me, as before, tho' not yet performed. Accordingly, tho'
I waited at Sessions, there was none to object ought against me, upon which I
was dismissed. This gave me some reason to believe that you intended all should
have been forgotten; But instead of that, I find the Coals are fresh blown up, I
being supposed to be represented, in a late Manuscript, <hi

yet whose infidelity was without compare less excusable, but the Author having
resolved long since, to have no more than one single Grain of Patience, with
them that deny,<ref target="n219">[219]</ref> etc., the Wonder is the less. It must needs be that offences
come, but wo to him by whom they come. To vindicate my self therefore from
such false Imputations, of Satanlike insinuations, and misrepresenting your
Actions, etc., and to vindicate your self, Sir, as much as is in my Power from
those Suggestions, said to be Insinuated, as if you wore not the Modesty and

Actions in this Affair; and do request and pray, that if I err, I may be shewed it
from Scripture, or sound Reason, and not by quotations out of Virgil, nor Spanish
Rhetorick. For I find the Witlings mentioned, are so far from answering your
profound questions, that they cannot so much as pretend to shew a distinction
between Witchcraft in the Common notion of it, and Possession; Nor so much as
to demonstrate that ever the Jews or primitive Christians did believe, that a Witch
could send a Devil to Afflict her Neighbours; but to all these, Sir, (ye being the
Salt of the Earth, etc.) I have reason to hope for a Satisfactory Answer to him,

<p>Whereas you intimate your desires, that what's not fairly, (I take it for
granted you mean truly also,) represented in a Paper you lately sent me,
containing a pretended Narrative of a Visit by my Father and self to an Afflicted
Young woman, whom we apprehended to be under a Diabolical Possession, might
be rectified: I have this to say, as I have often already said, that I do scarcely
find any one thing in the whole Paper, whether respecting my Father or self,
either fairly or truly represented. Nor can I think that any that know my Parents
Circumstances, but must think him deserving a better Character by far, than this
Narrative can be thought to give him. When the main design we managed in
Visiting the poor Afflicted Creature, was to prevent the Accusations of the
Neighbourhood, can it be fairly represented that our design was to draw out such
Accusations, which is the representation

<pb n="334"/>




of the Paper? We have Testimonies of the best Witnesses and in Number not a
few, That when we asked Rule whether she thought she knew who Tormented
her? the Question was but an Introduction to the Solemn charges which we then
largely gave, that she should rather Dye than tell the Names of any whom she
might Imagine that she knew. Your Informers have reported the Question, and
report nothing of what follows, as essential to the giving of that Question: And
can this be termed a piece of fairness? Fair it cannot be, that when Ministers
Faithfully and Carefully discharge their Duty to the Miserable in their Flock, little
bits, scraps and shreds of their Discourses should be tackt together to make them
contemtible, when there shall be no notice of all the Necessary, Seasonable, and
Profitable things that occur'd, in those Discourses; And without which, the
occasion of the lesser Passages cannot be understood; And yet I am furnished
with abundant Evidences, ready to be Sworn, that will possitively prove this part
of unfairness, by the above mention'd Narrative, to be done both to my Father
and self. Again, it seems not fair or reasonable that I should be expos'd, for
which your self (not to say some others) might have expos'd me for, if I had not
done, <hi rend="italic">Viz.
</hi> for discouraging so much Company from flocking about the Possest
Maid, and yet, as I perswade my self, you cannot but think it to be good advice,
to keep much Company from such haunted Chambers; besides the unfairness doth
more appear, in that I find nothing repeated of what I said about the advantage,
which the Devil takes from too much Observation and Curiosity.</p>


<p>In that several of the Questions in the Paper are so Worded, as to carry in
them a presupposal of the things inquired after, to say the best of it is very
unfair: But this is not all, the Narrative contains a number of Mistakes and
Falshoods; which were they willful and design'd, might justly be termed gross
Lies. The representations are far from true, when 'tis affirm'd my Father and self
being come into the Room, I began the Discourse; I hope I understand breeding
a little better than so: For proof of this, did occasion serve, sundry can depose
the contrary.</p>


<p>'Tis no less untrue, that either my Father or self put the Question, how
many Witches sit upon you? We always

<pb n="335"/>




cautiously avoided that expression; It being contrary to our inward belief: All the
standers by will (I believe) Swear they did not hear us use it (your Witnesses
excepted) and I tremble to think how hardy those woful Creatures must be, to call
the Almighty by an Oath, to so false a thing. As false a representation 'tis, that
I rub'd Rule's Stomach, her Breast not being covered. The Oath of the nearest
Spectators, giving a true account of that matter will prove this to be little less
than a gross (if not a doubled) Lie; and to be somewhat plainer, it carries the
Face of a Lie contrived on purpose (by them at least, to whom you are beholden
for the Narrative) Wickedly and Basely to expose me. For you cannot but know
how much this Representation hath contributed, to make People believe a Smutty
thing of me; I am far from thinking, but that in your own Conscience you
believe, that no indecent Action of that Nature could then be done by me before
such observers, had I been so Wicked as to have been inclin'd to what is Base.
It looks next to impossible that a reparation shoud be made me for the wrong
done to, I hope, as to any Scandal, an unblemish'd, tho' weak and small Servant
of the Church of God. Nor is what follows a less untruth, that 'twas an Attendant
and not my self who said, if Rule knows who Afflicts her, yet she wont tell. I
therefore spoke it that I might incourage her to continue in that concealment of
all Names whatsoever; to this I am able to furnish my self with the Attestation
of Sufficient Oaths. 'Tis as far from true, that my apprehension of the Imp, about
Rule, was on her Belly, for the Oaths of the Spectators, and even of those that
thought they felt it, can testify that 'twas upon the Pillow, at a distance from her
Body. As untrue a Representation is that which follows, <hi
rend="italic">Viz.</hi> That it was said unto her, that her not Apprehending
of that odd palpable, tho' not visible, Mover was from her Fancy, for I
endeavoured to perswade her that it might be but Fancy in others, that there was
any such thing at all. Witnesses every way sufficient can be produced for this
also. 'Tis falsely represented that my Father felt on the Young-woman after the
appearance mentioned, for his hand was never near her; Oath can sufficiently
vindicate him. 'Tis very untrue that my Father Prayed for perhaps half an Hour,
against the power of the Devil and Witchcraft, and that God would bring out the

<pb n="336"/>




Afflictors. Witnesses of the best Credit, can depose, that his Prayer was not a
quarter of an Hour, and that there was no more than about one clause towards the
close of the Prayer, which was of this import; And this clause also was guarded
with a singular wariness and modesty, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> If there
were any evil Instruments in this matter God would please to discover them: And
that there was more than common reason for that Petition I can satisfie any one
that will please to Inquire of me. And strange it is, that a Gentleman that from
18 to 54 hath been an Exemplary Minister of the Gospel; and that besides a
station in the Church of God, as considerable as any that his own Country can
afford, hath for divers years come off with Honour, in his Application to three
Crown'd Heads, and the chiefest Nobility of three Kingdoms, Knows not yet how
to make one short Prayer of a quarter of an hour, but in New-England he must
be Libell'd for it. There are divers other down-right mistakes, which you have
permitted your self, I would hope not knowingly, and with a Malicious design,
to be receiver or Compiler of, which I shall now forbear to Animadvert upon. As
for the Appendix of the Narrative I do find myself therein Injuriously treated, for
the utmost of your proof for what you say of me, amounts to little more than,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Some People told you, that others told them,
that such and such things did pass, but you may assure yourself, that I am not
unfurnish'd with Witnesses, that can convict the same. Whereas you would give
me to believe the bottom of these your Methods, to be some dissatisfaction about
the commonly receiv'd Power of Devils and Witches; I do not only with all
freedom offer you the use of any part of my Library, which you may see cause
to peruse on that Subject, but also if you and any else, whom you please, will
visit me at my Study, yea, or meet me at any other place, less inconvenient than
those by you propos'd; I will with all the fairness and calmness in the World
dispute the point. I beg of God that he would bestow as many Blessings on you,
as ever on myself, and out of a sincere wish, that you may be made yet more
capable of these Blessings, I take this occasion to lay before you the faults (not
few nor small ones neither) which the Paper contained, you lately sent me in
order to be Examined by me. In case you want a true and full Narrative of my

<pb n="337"/>




Visit, whereof such an indecent Traversty (to say the best) hath been made, I am
not unwilling to communicate it, in mean time must take liberty to say, 'Tis
scarcely consistent with Common Civility, much less Christian Charity, to offer

<seg type="postscript">I do Testifie that I have seen Margaret Rule in her Afflictions from the
Invisible World, lifted up from her Bed, wholly by an Invisible force, a great way
towards the top of the Room where she lay; in her being so lifted, she had no
Assistance from any use of her own Arms or Hands, or any other part of her
Body, not so much as her Heels touching her Bed, or resting on any support
whatsoever. And I have seen her thus lifted, when not only a strong Person hath
thrown his whole weight a cross her to pull her down; but several other Persons

Mather, Reverend Sir</hi>,</salute>
</opener>

<p>Yours of the 15th Instant, I receiv'd yesterday; and soon found I had
promised my self too much by it, <hi rend="italic">Viz</hi>, Either
concurrence with, or a denial of those Fundamentals mentioned in mine, of
Novem. the 24th, finding this waved by an Invitation to your Library, etc. I thank
God I have the Bible, and do Judge that sufficient to demonstrate that cited Head
of Mr. Gaule to be a Truth, as also those other Heads mentioned, as the
Foundations of Religion. And in my apprehension, if it be asked any Christian,
whether God governs the World, and whether it be he only can Commissionate
Devils, and such other Fundamentals, He ought to be as ready as in the Question,
who made him? (a little Writing certainly might be of more use, to clear up the
controverted points, than either looking over many Books in a well furnish'd
Library, or than a dispute, if I were qualified for it; the Inconveniencies of
Passion being this way best avoided) And am not without hopes that you will yet
oblige me so far, as to consider that Letter, and if I Err, to let me see it by
Scripture, etc.</p>


<p>Yours, almost the whole of it, is concerning the Narrative I sent to you,
and you seem to intimate as if I were giving

<pb n="339"/>




Characters, Reflections, and Libell's etc. concerning your self and Relations; all
which were as far from my thoughts, as ever they were in writing after either
your self, or any other Minister. In the front you declare your apprehension to
be, that the Afflicted was under a Diabolical Possession, and if so, I see not how
it should be occasion'd by any Witchcraft (unless we ascribe that Power to a
Witch, which is only the Prerogative of the Almighty, of Sending or
Commissionating the Devils to Afflict her.) But to your particular Objections
against the Narrative; and to the first my intelligence not giving me any further,
I could not insert that I knew not. And it seems improbable that a Question
should be put, whether she knew (or rather who they were) and at the same time
to charge her, and that upon her Life, not to tell, and if you had done so, I see
but little good you could promise your self or others by it, she being Possest, as
also having it inculcated so much to her of Witchcraft. And as to the next
Objection about company flocking, etc., I do profess my Ignorance, not knowing
what you mean by it. And Sir, that most of the Questions did carry with them a
presupposing the things inquired after, is evident, if there were such as those
relating to the Black-man and a Book, and about her hearing the Prayer, etc.
(related in the said Narrative, which I find no Objection against.) As to that
which is said of mentioning your self first discoursing and your hopes that your
breeding was better (I doubt it not) nor do I doubt your Father might first apply
himself to others; but my intelligence is, that you first spake to the Afflicted or
Possessed, for which you had the advantage of a nearer approach. The next two
Objections are founded upon mistakes: I find not in the Narrative any such
Question, as how many Witches sit upon you? and that her Breast was not
covered, in which those material words &ldquo;with the Bed-Cloaths&rdquo; are
wholly omitted; I am not willing to retort here your own Language upon you; but
can tell you, that your own discourse of it publickly, at Sir W.
P.'s<ref target="n221">[221]</ref> Table, has
much more contributed to, etc. As to the Reply, if she could she would not tell,
whether either or both spake it it matters not much. Neither does the Narrative
say you felt the live thing on her Belly; tho I omit now to say what further
demonstrations there are

<pb n="340"/>




of it. As to that Reply, that is only her fancy, I find the word &ldquo;her&rdquo;
added. And as to your Fathers feeling for the live Creature after you had felt it,
if it were on the Bed it was not so very far from her. And for the length of his
Prayer, possibly your Witnesses might keep a more exact account of the time than
those others, and I stand not for a few Minutes. For the rest of the Objections I
suppose them of less moment, if less can be (however shall be ready to receive
them, those matters of greatest concern I find no Objections against). These being
all that yet appear, it may be thought that if the Narrative be not fully exact, it
was as near as Memory could bear away; but should be glad to see one more
perfect (which yet is not to be expected, seeing none writ at the time). You
mention the appendix, by which I understand the Second Visit, and if you be by
the possessed belyed (as being half an hour with her alone, excluding her own
Mother, and as telling her you had Prayed for her Nine times that day, and that
now was her Laughing time, she must Laugh now) I can see no Wonder in it;
what can be expected less from the Father of Lies, by whom, you Judge, she was
possest.</p>


<p>And besides the above Letter, you were pleased to send me another Paper
containing several Testimonies of the Possessed being lifted up, and held a space
of several Minutes to the Garret floor, etc., but they omit giving the account,
whether after she was down they bound her down: or kept holding her: And
relate not how many were to pull her down, which hinders the knowledge what
number they must be to be stronger than an Invisible Force. Upon the whole, I
suppose you expect I should believe it; and if so, the only advantage gain'd, is
that which has been so long controverted between Protestants and Papists,
whether Miracles are ceast, will hereby seem to be decided for the latter; it
being, for ought I can see, if so, as true a Miracle as for Iron to swim, and that
the Devil can work such Miracles.</p>


<p>But Sir, leaving these little disputable things, I do again pray that you
would let me have the happiness of your approbation or confutation of that Letter
before referred to.</p>


<p>And now, Sir, that the God of all Grace may enable us Zealously to own
his Truths, and to follow those things that tend to Peace, and that yourself may
be as an useful Instrument

<pb n="341"/>




in his hand, effectually to ruin the remainders of Heathenish and Popish
Superstitions, is the earnest desire and prayer of yours to command, in what I
may.</p>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d77">
<head>PART V. <hi rend="italic">An Impartial Account of the most Memorable Matters
of Fact, touching the supposed Witchcraft in New England</hi>.<ref target="n223">[223]</ref></head>


<p>Mr. Parris had been some years a Minister in Salem-Village,<ref target="n224">[224]</ref> when this
sad Calamity (as a deluge) overflowed them, spreading it self far and near: He
was a Gentleman of Liberal Education, and not meeting with any great
Encouragement, or Advantage in Merchandizing, to which for some time he
apply'd himself, betook himself to the work of the Ministry; this Village being
then vacant, he met with so much Encouragement, as to settle in that Capacity
among them.</p>


<p>After he had been there about two years, he obtained a Grant from a part
of the Town, that the House and Land he Occupied, and which had been Alotted
by the whole People to the Ministry, should be and remain to him, etc. as his
own Estate in Fee Simple. This occasioned great Divisions both between the
Inhabitants themselves, and between a considerable part of them and their said
Minister, which Divisions were but as a beginning or Pr&aelig;ludium to what
immediately followed.</p>


<p>It was the latter end of February 1691,<ref target="n225">[225]</ref> when divers young Persons
belonging to Mr. Parris's Family, and one or

<pb n="342"/>

more of the Neighbourhood, began to Act, after a strange and unusual manner,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> as by getting into Holes, and creeping under
Chairs and Stools, and to use sundry odd Postures and Antick Gestures, uttering
foolish, ridiculous Speeches, which neither they themselves nor any others could
make sense of; the Physicians that were called could assign no reason for this; but
it seems one of them,<ref target="n226">[226]</ref> having recourse to the old shift, told them he was afraid
they were Bewitched; upon such suggestions, they that were concerned applied
themselves to Fasting and Prayer, which was attended not only in their own
private Families, but with calling in the help of others.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.
Mr. Parris invited several Neighbouring Ministers to join with him in keeping a
Solemn day of Prayer at his own House; the time of the exercise those Persons
were for the most part silent, but after any one Prayer was ended, they would Act
and Speak strangely and Ridiculously, yet were such as had been well Educated
and of good Behaviour, the one, a Girl of 11 or 12 years old,<ref target="n227">[227]</ref> would sometimes
seem to be in a Convulsion Fit, her Limbs being twisted several ways, and very
stiff, but presently her Fit would be over.</p>


<p>A few days before this Solemn day of Prayer, Mr. Parris's Indian Man and
Woman<ref target="n228">[228]</ref> made a Cake of Rye Meal, with the Childrens Water, and Baked it in
the Ashes, and as is said, gave it to the Dog; this was done as a means to
Discover Witchcraft;<ref target="n229">[229]</ref> soon after which those ill affected or afflicted Persons
named several that they said they saw, when in their Fits, afflicting of
them.</p>


<pb n="343"/>

<p>The first complain'd of, was the said Indian Woman, named Tituba. She
confessed that the Devil urged her to sign a Book, which he presented to her, and
also to work Mischief to the Children, etc. She was afterwards Committed to
Prison, and lay there till Sold for her Fees.<ref target="n230">[230]</ref> The account she since gives of it is,
that her Master did beat her and otherways abuse her, to make her confess and
accuse (such as he call'd) her Sister-Witches, and that whatsoever she said by
way of confessing or accusing others, was the effect of such usage; her Master
refused to pay her Fees, unless she would stand to what she had
said.<ref target="n231">[231]</ref></p>


<p>The Children complained likewise of two other Women, to be the Authors
of their Hurt, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Sarah Good, who had long been
counted a Melancholy or Distracted Woman, and one Osburn, an Old Bed-rid
Woman; which two were Persons so ill thought of, that the accusation was the
more readily believed; and after Examination before two Salem
Magistrates,<ref target="n232">[232]</ref>
were committed:</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 19<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,
Mr. Lawson (who had been formerly a Preacher at the said Village) came thither,
and hath since set fourth in Print an account of what then passed, about which
time, as he saith, they complained of Goodwife Cory, and Goodwife Nurse,
Members of the Churches at the Village and at Salem, many others being by that
time Accused.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 21<hi rend="italic">st</hi>,
Goodwife Cory was examined before the Magistrates of Salem, at the Meeting
House in the Village, a throng of Spectators being present to see the Novelty.
Mr. Noyes, one of the Ministers of Salem, began with Prayer, after which the
Prisoner being call'd, in order to answer to what should be Alledged against her,
she desired that she might go to Prayer, and was answered by the Magistrates,
that they did not come to hear her pray, but to examine her.</p>


<p>The number of the Afflicted were at that time about Ten,

<pb n="344"/>




<hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Mrs. Pope, Mrs. Putman, Goodwife Bibber,
and Goodwife Goodall, Mary Wolcott, Mercy Lewes (at Thomas Putmans) and
Dr. Griggs Maid, and three Girls, <hi rend="italic">Viz.</hi> Elizabeth
Parris, Daughter to the Minister, Abigail Williams his Neice, and Ann Putman,
which last three were not only the beginners, but were also the chief in these
Accusations. These Ten were most of them present at the Examination, and did
vehemently accuse her of Afflicting them, by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc.
And they said, they did in their Fits see her likeness coming to them, and
bringing a Book for them to Sign; Mr. Hathorn, a Magistrate of Salem, asked
her, why she Afflicted those Children? she said, she did not Afflict them; he
asked her, who did then? she said, &ldquo;I do not know, how should I
know?&rdquo; she said, they were Poor Distracted Creatures, and no heed to be
given to what they said; Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Noyes replied that it was the
Judgment of all that were there present, that they were bewitched, and only she
(the Accused) said they were Distracted: She was Accused by them, that the
Black Man Whispered to her in her Ear now (while she was upon Examination)
and that she had a Yellow Bird, that did use to Suck between her Fingers, and
that the said Bird did Suck now in the Assembly; order being given to look in
that place to see if there were any sign, the Girl that pretended to see it said, that
it was too late now, for she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head, it was
upon search found, that a Pin was there sticking upright. When the Accused had
any motion of their Body, Hands or Mouth, the Accusers would cry out, as when
she bit her Lip, they would cry out of being bitten, if she grasped one hand with
the other, they would cry out of being Pinched by her, and would produce marks,
so of the other motions of her Body, as complaining of being Prest, when she
lean'd to the seat next her, if she stirred her Feet, they would stamp and cry out
of Pain there. After the hearing the said Cory was committed to Salem Prison,
and then their crying out of her abated.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March the</hi> 24<hi rend="italic">th</hi>,
Goodwife Nurse was brought before Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin (Magistrates)
in the Meeting House. Mr. Hale, Minister of Beverly, began with Prayer, after
which she being Accus'd of much the same Crimes made the like an

<pb n="345"/>




swers, asserting her own Innocence with earnestness. The Accusers were mostly
the same, Tho. Putmans Wife, etc. complaining much. The dreadful Shreiking
from her and others, was very amazing, which was heard at a great distance; she
was also Committed to Prison.</p>


<p>A Child of Sarah Goods was likewise apprehended, being between 4 and
5 years Old. The Accusers said this Child bit them, and would shew such like
marks, as those of a small Sett of Teeth upon their Arms; as many of the
Afflicted as the Child cast its Eye upon, would complain they were in Torment;
which Child they also Committed.</p>


<p>Concerning these that had been hitherto Examined and Committed, it is
among other things observed by Mr. Lawson (in Print<ref target="n233">[233]</ref>) that they were by the
Accusers charged to belong to a Company that did muster in Arms, and were
reported by them to keep Days of Fast, Thanksgiving and Sacraments; and that
those Afflicted (or Accusers) did in the Assembly Cure each others, even with a
touch of their Hand, when strangled and otherways tortured, and would
endeavour to get to the Afflicted to relieve them thereby (for hitherto they had not
used the Experiment of bringing the Accused to touch the Afflicted, in order to
their Cure) and could foretel one anothers Fits to be coming, and would say, look
to such a one, she will have a Fit presently and so it happened, and that at the
same time when the Accused person was present, the Afflicted said they saw her
Spectre or likeness in other places of the Meeting House Suckling<ref target="n234">[234]</ref> of their
Familiars.</p>


<p>The said Mr. Lawson being to Preach at the Village, after the Psalm was
Sung, Abigail Williams said, &ldquo;Now stand up and name your Text&rdquo;;
after it was read, she said, &ldquo;It is a long Text.&rdquo; Mrs. Pope in the
beginning of Sermon said to him, &ldquo;Now there is enough of that.&rdquo;
In Sermon, he referring to his Doctrine, Abigail Williams said to him, &ldquo;I
know no Doctrine you had, if you did name one I have forgot it.&rdquo; Ann
Putman, an afflicted Girl, said, There was a Yellow Bird sate on his Hat as it
hung on the Pin in the Pulpit.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">March</hi> 31, 1692. Was set apart as a day of
Solemn Humiliation at Salem, upon the Account of this Business, on which day
Abigail Williams said, That she saw a great number

<pb n="346"/>




of Persons in the Village at the Administration of a Mock Sacrament, where they
had Bread as read as raw Flesh, and red Drink.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 1. Mercy Lewis affirmed, That she saw
a man in white, with whom she went into a Glorious Place, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> In her fits, where was no Light of the Sun, much
less of Candles, yet was full of Light and Brightness, with a great Multitude in
White Glittering Robes, who Sang the Song in 5. Rev. 9. and the 110 and 149
Psalms; And was grieved that she might tarry no longer in this place. This White
Man is said to have appeared several times to others of them, and to have given
them notice how long it should be before they should have another Fit.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April the</hi> 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>.
Being Sacrament Day at the Village, Sarah Cloys, Sister to Goodwife Nurse, a
Member to one of the Churches, was (tho' it seems with difficulty prevail'd with
to be) present; but being entred the place, and Mr. Parris naming his Text, 6
John, 70. <hi rend="italic">Have not I chosen you Twelve, and one of you
is a Devil</hi> (for what cause may rest as a doubt whether upon the account
of her Sisters being Committed, or because of the choice of that Text) she rose
up and went out, the wind shutting the Door forcibly, gave occasion to some to
suppose she went out in Anger, and might occasion a suspicion of her; however
she was soon after complain'd of, examin'd and Committed.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April the</hi> 11<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.
By this time the number of the Accused and Accusers being much encreased, was
a Publick Examination at Salem, Six of the Magistrates with several Ministers
being present;<ref target="n235">[235]</ref> there appeared several who complain'd against others with hidious
clamors and Screechings. Goodwife Proctor was brought thither, being Accused
or cryed out against; her Husband coming to attend and assist her, as there might

<pb n="347"/>




be need, the Accusers cryed out of him also, and that with so much earnestness,
that he was Committed with his Wife. About this time besides the Experiment of
the Afflicted falling at the sight, etc., they put the Accused upon saying the Lords
Prayer, which one among them performed, except in that petition, <hi
rend="italic">Deliver us from Evil</hi>, she exprest it thus, <hi
rend="italic">Deliver us from all Evil</hi>. This was lookt upon as if she
Prayed against what she was now justly under, and being put upon it again, and
repeating those words, <hi rend="italic">Hallowed be thy name</hi>, she
exprest it, <hi rend="italic">Hollowed be thy Name</hi>, this was counted
a depraving the words, as signifying to make void, and so a Curse
rather then<ref target="n236">[236]</ref>
a Prayer, upon the whole it was concluded that she also could not say it, etc.
Proceeding in this work of examination and Commitment, many were sent to
Prison. As an Instance, see the following Mittimus:</p>

thereby held himself upon the Horse, but said Bishop striking him with his stick,
the Indian soon recovered, and promised he would do so no more; to which
Bishop replied, that he doubted not, but he could cure them all, with more to the
same effect; immediately after he was parted from them, he was cried out of,

<p><hi rend="italic">May</hi> 14, 1692. Sir William Phips arrived with
Commission from Their Majesties to be Governour, pursuant to the New-Charter;
which he now brought with him; the Ancient Charter having been vacated by
King Charles, and King James (by which they had a power not only to make their
own Laws; but also to chuse their own Governour and Officers;) and the
Countrey for some years was put under an absolute Commission-Government, till
the Revolution,<ref target="n243">[243]</ref> at which time tho more than two thirds of the People were for
reassuming their ancient Government, (to which they had encouragement by His
then Royal Highness's Proclamation) yet some that might have been better
imployed (in another Station)<ref target="n244">[244]</ref> made it their business (by printing, as well as

utmost to divert them from such a settlement; and so far prevailed, that for about
seven Weeks after the Revolution, here was not so much as a face of any
Government; but some few Men upon their own Nomination would be called a
Committee of Safety; but at length the Assembly prevailed with those that had
been of the Government, to promise that they would reassume; and accordingly
a Proclamation was drawn, but before publishing it, it was underwritten, that they
would not have it understood that they did reassume Charter-Government; so that
between Government and no Government, this Countrey remained till Sir William
arrived; Agents being in this time impowered in England, which no doubt did not
all of them act according to the Minds or Interests of those that impowered them,
which is manifest by their not acting jointly in what was done; so that this place
is perhaps a single Instance (even in the best of Reigns) of a Charter not restored
after so happy a Revolution.</p>


<p>This settlement by Sir William Phips his being come Governour put an end
to all disputes of these things, and being arrived, and having read his
Commission, the first thing he exerted his Power in, was said to be his giving
Orders that Irons should be put upon those in Prison; for tho for some time after
these were Committed, the Accusers ceased to cry out of them;<ref target="n245">[245]</ref> yet now the cry
against them was renewed, which occasioned such Order; and tho there was
partiality in the executing it (some having taken them off<ref target="n246">[246]</ref> almost as soon as put
on) yet the cry of these Accusers against such ceased after this
Order.<ref target="n247">[247]</ref></p>

<q><p>I having heard some days, that my Wife was accused of Witchcraft, being much
disturbed at it, by advice, we went to Salem-Village, to see if the afflicted did
know her; we arrived there, 24 May, it happened to be a day appointed for
Examination; accordingly soon after our arrival, Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Curwin,
etc., went to the Meeting-house, which was the place appointed for that Work,
the Minister began with Prayer, and having taken care to get a convenient place,
I observed, that the afflicted were two Girls of about Ten Years
old,<ref target="n249">[249]</ref> and about
two or three other, of about eighteen, one of the Girls talked most, and could
discern more than the rest. The Prisoners were called in one by one, and as they
came in were cried out of, etc. The Prisoner was placed about 7 or 8 foot from
the Justices, and the Accusers between the Justices and them; the Prisoner was
ordered to stand right before the Justices, with an Officer appointed to hold each
hand, least they should therewith afflict them, and the Prisoners Eyes must be
constantly on the Justices; for if they look'd on the afflicted, they would either
fall into their Fits, or cry out of being hurt by them; after Examination of the
Prisoners, who it was afflicted these Girls, etc., they were put upon saying the
Lords Prayer, as a tryal of their guilt; after the afflicted seem'd to be out of their
Fits, they would look steadfastly on some one person, and frequently not speak;
and then the Justices said they were struck dumb, and after a little time would
speak again; then the Justices said to the Accusers, &ldquo;which of you will go
and touch the Prisoner at the Bar?&rdquo; then the most couragious would
adventure, but before they had made three steps would ordinarily fall down as in
a Fit; the Justices ordered that they should be taken up and carried to the
Prisoner, that she might touch them; and as soon as they were touched by the
accused, the Justices would say, they are well, before I could discern any
alteration; by which I observed that the Justices understood the manner of it.
Thus far I was only as a Spectator, my Wife also was there part of the time, but
no notice taken of her by the afflicted, except once or twice they came to her and
asked her name.</p>


<p>But I having an opportunity to Discourse<ref target="n250">[250]</ref> Mr. Hale<ref target="n251">[251]</ref> (with whom I had
formerly acquaintance) I took his advice, what I had best to do, and desired of
him that I might have an opportunity to speak with her that accused my Wife;
which he promised should be, I acquainting him that I reposed my trust in
him.</p>


<p>Accordingly he came to me after the Examination was over, and told me
I had now an opportunity to speak with the said Accuser,

<pb n="351"/>




<hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Abigail Williams, a Girl of 11 or 12 Years old;
but that we could not be in private at Mr. Parris's House, as he had promised
me; we went therefore into the Alehouse, where an Indian Man attended us, who
it seems was one of the afflicted: to him we gave some Cyder, he shewed several
Scars, that seemed as if they had been long there, and shewed them as done by
Witchcraft, and acquainted us that his Wife, who also was a Slave, was
imprison'd for Witchcraft.<ref target="n252">[252]</ref> And now instead of one Accuser, they all came in,
who began to tumble down like Swine, and then three Women were called in to
attend them. We in the Room were all at a stand, to see who they would cry out
of; but in a short time they cried out, Cary; and immediately after a Warrant was
sent from the Justices to bring my Wife before them, who were sitting in a
Chamber near by, waiting for this.</p>


<p>Being brought before the Justices, her chief accusers were two Girls; my
Wife declared to the Justices, that she never had any knowledge of them before
that day; she was forced to stand with her Arms stretched out. I did request that
I might hold one of her hands, but it was denied me; then she desired me to wipe
the Tears from her Eyes, and the Sweat from her Face, which I did; then she
desired she might lean her self on me, saying, she should faint.</p>


<p>Justice Hathorn replied, she had strength enough to torment those persons,
and she should have strength enough to stand. I speaking something against their
cruel proceedings, they commanded me to be silent, or else I should be turned out
of the Room. The Indian before mentioned, was also brought in, to be one of her
Accusers: being come in, he now (when before the Justices) fell down and
tumbled about like a Hog, but said nothing. The Justices asked the Girls, who
afflicted the Indian? they answered she (meaning my Wife) and now lay upon
him; the Justices ordered her to touch him, in order to his cure, but her head
must be turned another way, least instead of curing, she should make him worse,
by her looking on him, her hand being guided to take hold of his; but the Indian
took hold on her hand, and pulled her down on the Floor, in a barbarous manner;
then his hand was taken off, and her hand put on his, and the cure was quickly
wrought. I being extreamly troubled at their Inhumane dealings, uttered a hasty
Speech (That God would take vengeance on them, and desired that God would
deliver us out of the hands of unmerciful men.) Then her Mittimus was writ. I
did with difficulty and charge obtain the liberty of a Room, but no Beds in it; if
there had, could have taken but little rest that Night. She was committed to
Boston Prison; but I obtained a Habeas Corpus to remove her to Cambridge
Prison, which is in our County of Mid

dlesex. Having been there one Night, next Morning the Jaylor put Irons on her
legs (having received such a command) the weight of them was about eight
pounds; these Irons and her other Afflictions, soon brought her into Convulsion
Fits, so that I thought she would have died that Night. I sent to intreat that the
Irons might be taken off, but all intreaties were in vain, if it would have saved
her Life, so that in this condition she must continue. The Tryals at Salem coming
on, I went thither, to see how things were there managed; and finding that the
Spectre-Evidence was there received, together with Idle, if not malicious Stories,
against Peoples Lives, I did easily perceive which way the rest would go; for the
same Evidence that served for one, would serve for all the rest. I acquainted her
with her danger; and that if she were carried to Salem to be tried, I feared she
would never return. I did my utmost that she might have her Tryal in our own
County, I with several others Petitioning the Judge for it, and were put in hopes
of it; but I soon saw so much, that I understood thereby it was not intended,
which put me upon consulting the means of her escape; which thro the goodness
of God was effected, and she got to Road Island,<ref target="n253">[253]</ref> but soon found her self not
safe when there, by reason of the pursuit after her; from thence she went to
New-York, along with some others that had escaped their cruel hands; where we
found his Excellency Benjamin Fletcher, Esq; Governour, who was very
courteous to us. After this some of my Goods were seized in a Friends hands,
with whom I had left them, and my self imprisoned by the Sheriff, and kept in
Custody half a day, and then dismist; but to speak of their usage of the Prisoners,
and their Inhumanity shewn to them, at the time of their Execution, no sober
Christian could bear; they had also tryals of cruel mockings; which is the more,
considering what a People for Religion, I mean the profession of it, we have
been; those that suffered being many of them Church-Members, and most of them
unspotted in their Conversation, till their Adversary the Devil took up this
Method for accusing them.</p></q>

at Salem, and Committed to Boston Prison. The Prison-Keeper seeing

<pb n="353"/>




such a Man Committed, of whom he had a good esteem, was after this the more
Compassionate to those that were in Prison on the like account; and did refrain
from such hard things to the Prisoners, as before he had used. Mr. Aldin himself
has given account of his Examination, in these Words.</p>


<div3 type="essay" id="d81"><head><hi rend="italic">An Account how John Aldin, Senior, was dealt with
at Salem-Village</hi>.</head>


<p>John Aldin Senior, of Boston, in the County of Suffolk, Marriner, on the
28th Day of May, 1692, was sent for by the Magistrates of Salem, in the County
of Essex, upon the Accusation of a company of poor distracted, or possessed
Creatures or Witches; and being sent by Mr. Stoughton,<ref
target="n256">[256]</ref> arrived there the 31st
of May, and appeared at Salem-Village, before Mr. Gidney,<ref target="n257">[257]</ref> Mr. Hathorn, and
Mr. Curwin.</p>


<p>Those Wenches being present, who plaid their jugling tricks, falling down,
crying out, and staring in Peoples Faces; the Magistrates demanded of them
several times, who it was of all the People in the Room that hurt them? one of
these Accusers pointed several times at one Captain Hill, there present, but spake
nothing; the same Accuser had a Man standing at her back to hold her up; he
stooped down to her Ear, then she cried out, Aldin, Aldin afflicted her; one of
the Magistrates asked her if she had ever seen Aldin, she answered no, he asked
her how she knew it was Aldin? She said, the Man told her so.</p>


<p>Then all were ordered to go down into the Street, where a Ring was made;
and the same Accuser cried out, &ldquo;there stands Aldin, a bold fellow with
his Hat on before the Judges, he sells Powder and Shot to the Indians and French,
and lies with the Indian Squaes, and has Indian Papooses.&rdquo; Then was
Aldin committed to the Marshal's Custody, and his Sword taken from him; for
they said he afflicted them with his Sword. After some hours Aldin was sent for
to the Meeting-house in the Village before the Magistrates; who required Aldin
to stand upon a Chair, to the open view of all the People.</p>


<p>The Accusers cried out that Aldin did pinch them, then, when he stood
upon the Chair, in the sight of all the People, a good way distant from them, one
of the Magistrates bid the Marshal to hold open Aldin's hands, that he might not
pinch those Creatures. Aldin asked

<pb n="354"/>




them why they should think, that he should come to that Village to afflict those
persons that he never knew or saw before? Mr. Gidney bid Aldin confess, and
give glory to God; Aldin said he hoped he should give glory to God, and hoped
he should never gratifie the Devil; but appealed to all that ever knew him, if they
ever suspected him to be such a person, and challenged any one, that could bring
in any thing upon their own knowledge, that might give suspicion of his being
such an one. Mr. Gidney said he had known Aldin many Years, and had been at
Sea with him, and always look'd upon him to be an honest Man, but now he did
see cause to alter his judgment: Aldin answered, he was sorry for that, but he
hoped God would clear up his Innocency, that he would recall that judgment
again, and added that he hoped that he should with Job maintain his Integrity till
he died. They bid Aldin look upon the Accusers, which he did, and then they fell
down. Aldin asked Mr. Gidney, what Reason there could be given, why Aldin's
looking upon <hi rend="italic">him</hi> did not strike <hi
rend="italic">him</hi> down as well; but no reason was given that I heard.
But the Accusers were brought to Aldin to touch them, and this touch they said
made them well. Aldin began to speak of the Providence of God in suffering
these Creatures to accuse Innocent persons. Mr. Noyes asked Aldin why he
would offer to speak of the Providence of God. God by his Providence (said Mr.
Noyes) governs the World, and keeps it in peace; and so went on with Discourse,
and stopt Aldin's mouth, as to that. Aldin told Mr. Gidney, that he could assure
him that there was a lying Spirit in them, for I can assure you that there is not
a word of truth in all these say of me. But Aldin was again committed to the
Marshal, and his Mittimus written, which was as follows.</p>

most that was done this Week, was the Tryal of one Bishop, <hi

repute of a Witch, occasioned by the Accusations of one Samuel Gray: he about
20 Years since, having charged her with such Crimes, and though upon his
Death-bed he testified his sorrow and repentance for such Accustations, as being
wholly groundless; yet the report taken up by his means continued, and she being
accused by those afflicted, and upon search a Tet, as they call it, being found,
she was brought in guilty by the Jury; she received her Sentence of Death, and
was Executed, June 10, but made not the least Confession of any thing relating
to Witchcraft.<ref target="n260">[260]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">June</hi> 15. Several Ministers in and near Boston,
having been to that end consulted by his Excellency,<ref target="n261">[261]</ref> exprest their minds to this
effect, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>


<p>That they were affected with the deplorable state of the afflicted; That they
were thankful for the diligent care of the Rulers, to detect the abominable
Witchcrafts, which have been committed in the Country, praying for a perfect
discovery thereof. But advised to a cautious proceeding, least many Evils ensue,
etc. And that tenderness be used towards those accused, relating to matters
presumptive and convictive, and also to privacy in Examinations, and to consult
Mr. Perkins and Mr. Bernard,<ref target="n262">[262]</ref> what tests to make use of in the Scrutiny: That
Presumptions and Convictions ought to have better grounds, than the Accusers
affirming that they see such persons Spectres afflicting them: And that the Devil
may afflict in the shape of good Men; and that falling at the sight, and rising at
the touch of the Accused, is no infallible proof of guilt; That seeing the Devils
strength consists in such Accusations, our disbelieving them may be a means to
put a period to the dreadful Calamities; Nevertheless they humbly recommend to

<p>This is briefly the substance of what may be seen more at large in <hi

And one of them<ref target="n264">[264]</ref> since taking occasion to repeat some part of this advice, <hi

(notwithstanding the Dissatisfaction of others) that if his said Book may conduce

<p>The 30<hi rend="italic">th of June</hi>, the Court according to
Adjournment again sat; five more were tried, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.
Sarah Good and Rebecca Nurse, of Salem-Village; Susanna Martin of Amsbury;
Elizabeth How of Ipswich; and Sarah Wildes of Topsfield; these were all
condemned that Sessions, and were all Executed on the 19th of
July.<ref target="n265">[265]</ref></p>


<p>At the Tryal of Sarah Good, one of the afflicted fell in a Fit, and after
coming out of it, she cried out of the Prisoner, for stabing her in the breast with
a Knife, and that she had broken the Knife in stabbing of her, accordingly a piece
of the blade of a Knife was found about her. Immediately information being given
to the Court, a young Man was called, who produced a Haft and part of the
Blade, which the Court having viewed and compared, saw it to be the same. And
upon inquiry the young Man affirmed, that yesterday he happened to break that
Knife, and that he cast away the upper part, this afflicted person being then
present. The young Man was

<pb n="358"/>




dismist, and she was bidden by the Court not to tell lyes; and was improved (after
as she had been before) to give Evidence against the Prisoners.</p>


<p>At Execution, Mr. Noyes urged Sarah Good to Confess, and told her she
was a Witch, and she knew she was a Witch, to which she replied, &ldquo;you
are a lyer; I am no more a Witch than you are a Wizard, and if you take away
my Life, God will give you Blood to drink.&rdquo;</p>


<p>At the Tryal of Rebecka Nurse, this was remarkable that the Jury brought
in their Verdict not Guilty, immediately all the accusers in the Court, and
suddenly after all the afflicted out of Court, made an hideous out-cry, to the
amazement, not only of the Spectators, but the Court also seemed strangely
surprized; one of the Judges exprest himself not satisfied, another of them as he
was going off the Bench, said they would have her Indicted anew. The chief
Judge said he would not Impose upon the Jury; but intimated, as if they had not
well considered one Expression of the Prisoners, when she was upon Tryal, <hi
rend="italic">viz</hi>. That when one Hobbs, who had confessed her self
to be a Witch, was brought into the Court to witness against her, the Prisoner
turning her head to her, said, &ldquo;What, do you bring her? she is one of
us,&rdquo; or to that effect; this together with the Clamours of the Accusers,
induced the Jury to go out again, after their Verdict, not Guilty. But not agreeing,
they came into the Court, and she being then at the Bar, her words were repeated
to her, in order to have had her explanation of them, and she making no Reply
to them, they found the Bill, and brought her in Guilty; these words being the
Inducement to it, as the Foreman has signified in writing, as follows.</p>

<div3 type="letter" id="d85"><head><hi rend="italic">July</hi> 4, 1692.</head>

<p>I Thomas Fisk, the Subscriber hereof, being one of them that were of the Jury the last week at Salem-Court,
upon the Tryal of Rebecka Nurse, etc., being desired by some of the Relations
to give a Reason why the Jury brought her in Guilty, after her Verdict not Guilty;
I do hereby give my Reasons to be as follows, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>


<p>When the Verdict not Guilty was, the honoured Court was pleased to object
against it, saying to them, that they think they let slip the words, which the
Prisoner at the Bar spake against her self, which were spoken in reply to
Goodwife Hobbs and her Daughter, who had been faulty in setting their hands to
the Devils Book, as they have confessed formerly; the words were &ldquo;What,
do these persons

<pb n="359"/>




give in Evidence against me now, they used to come among us.&rdquo;
After the honoured Court had manifested their dissatisfaction of the Verdict,
several of the Jury declared themselves desirous to go out again, and thereupon
the honoured Court gave leave; but when we came to consider of the Case, I
could not tell how to take her words, as an Evidence against her, till she had a
further opportunity to put her Sense upon them, if she would take it; and then
going into Court, I mentioned the words aforesaid, which by one of the Court
were affirmed to have been spoken by her, she being then at the Bar, but made
no reply, nor interpretation of them; whereupon these words were to me a
principal Evidence against her.</p>

do judge them not legal Evidence against their fellow Prisoners. And I being
something hard of hearing, and full of grief, none informing me how the Court
took up my words, and therefore had not opportunity to declare what I intended,
when I said they were of our Company.</p>

<p>After her Condemnation she was by one of the Ministers of Salem
excommunicated;<ref target="n267">[267]</ref> yet the Governour saw cause to grant a Reprieve, which when
known (and some say immediately upon granting) the Accusers renewed their
dismal out-cries against her, insomuch that the Governour was by some Salem
Gentleman prevailed with to recall the Reprieve, and she was Executed with the
rest.</p>


<pb n="360"/>


<p>The Testimonials of her Christian behaviour, both in the course of her Life,
and at her Death, and her extraordinary care in educating her Children, and
setting them good Examples, etc., under the hands of so many, are so numerous,
that for brevity they are here omitted.<ref target="n268">[268]</ref></p>


<p>It was at the Tryal of these that one of the Accusers cried out publickly of
Mr. Willard Minister in Boston,<ref target="n269">[269]</ref> as afflicting of her; she was sent out of the
Court, and it was told about she was mistaken in the person.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">August</hi> 5. The Court again sitting, six more
were tried on the same Account, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> Mr. George
Burroughs, sometime minister of Wells, John Procter, and Elizabeth Procter his
Wife, with John Willard of Salem-Village, George Jacobs Senior, of Salem, and
Martha Carryer of Andover;<ref target="n270">[270]</ref> these were all brought in Guilty and Condemned;
and were all Executed Aug. 19, except Procter's Wife, who pleaded
Pregnancy.<ref target="n271">[271]</ref></p>


<p>Mr. Burroughs was carried in a Cart with the others, through the streets of
Salem to Execution; when he was upon the Ladder, he made a Speech for the
clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious Expressions, as were to
the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by repeating the
Lord's Prayer,) was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness, and
such (at least seeming) fervency of Spirit, as was very affecting, and drew Tears
from many (so that it seemed to some, that the Spectators would hinder

the Execution). The accusers said the black Man stood and dictated to him; as
soon as he was turned off, Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse,
addressed himself to the People, partly to declare, that he was no ordained
Minister, and partly to possess the People of his guilt; saying, That the Devil has
often been transformed into an Angel of Light; and this did somewhat appease the
People, and the Executions went on; when he was cut down, he was dragged by
the Halter to a Hole, or Grave, between the Rocks, about two foot deep, his Shirt
and Breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of Trousers of one Executed, put
on his lower parts, he was so put in, together with Willard and Carryer, one of
his Hands and his Chin, and a Foot of one [of] them being left
uncovered.<ref target="n272">[272]</ref></p>


<p>John Willard had been imployed to fetch in several that were accused; but
taking dissatisfaction from his being sent, to fetch up some that he had better
thoughts of, he declined the Service, and presently after he himself was accused
of the same Crime, and that with such vehemency, that they sent after him to
apprehend him; he had made his Escape as far as Nashawag,<ref target="n273">[273]</ref> about 40 Miles
from Salem; yet'tis said those Accusers did then presently tell the exact time,
saying, now Willard is taken.</p>


<p>John Procter and his Wife being in Prison, the Sheriff came to his House
and seized all the Goods, Provisions, and Cattle that he could come at, and sold
some of the Cattle at half price, and killed others, and put them up for the
West-Indies; threw out the Beer out of a Barrel, and carried away the Barrel;
emptied a Pot of Broath, and took away the Pot, and left nothing in the House for
the support of the Children: No part of the said Goods are known to be returned.
Procter earnestly requested Mr. Noyes to pray with and for him, but

it was wholly denied, because he would not own himself to be a Witch.</p>

<p>The innocency of our Case with the Enmity of our Accusers and our
Judges, and Jury, whom nothing but our Innocent Blood will serve their turn,
having Condemned us already before our Tryals, being so much incensed and
engaged against us by the Devil, makes us bold to Beg and Implore your
Favourable Assistance of this our Humble Petition to his Excellency, That if it
be possible our Innocent Blood may be spared, which undoubtedly otherwise will
be shed, if the Lord doth not mercifully step in. The Magistrates, Ministers,
Jewries,<ref target="n275">[275]</ref> and all the People in general, being so much inraged and incensed
against us by the Delusion of the Devil, which we can term no other, by reason
we know in our own Consciences, we are all Innocent Persons. Here are five
Persons who have lately

<pb n="363"/>




confessed themselves to be Witches, and do accuse some of us, of being along
with them at a Sacrament, since we were committed into close Prison, which we
know to be Lies. Two of the 5 are (Carriers Sons<ref target="n276">[276]</ref>) Young-men, who would not
confess any thing till they tyed them Neck and Heels<ref target="n277">[277]</ref> till the Blood was ready
to come out of their Noses, and 'tis credibly believed and reported this was the
occasion of making them confess that<ref target="n278">[278]</ref> they never did, by reason they said one
had been a Witch a Month, and another five Weeks, and that their Mother had
made them so, who has been confined here this nine Weeks. My son William
Procter, when he was examin'd, because he would not confess that he was Guilty,
when he was Innocent, they tyed him Neck and Heels till the Blood gushed out
at his Nose, and would have kept him so 24 Hours, if one more Merciful than the
rest, had not taken pity on him, and caused him to be unbound. These actions are
very like the Popish Cruelties. They have already undone us in our Estates, and
that will not serve their turns, without our Innocent Bloods. If it cannot be
granted that we can have our

<pb n="364"/>




Trials at Boston, we humbly beg that you would endeavour to have these
Magistrates changed, and others in their rooms, begging also and beseeching you
would be pleased to be here, if not all, some of you at our Trials, hoping thereby
you may be the means of saving the shedding our Innocent Bloods, desiring your
Prayers to the Lord in our behalf, we rest your Poor Afflicted Servants,</p>

<p>After my Humble Duty Remembred to you, hoping in the Lord of your
good Health, as Blessed be God I enjoy, tho in abundance of Affliction, being
close confined here in a loathsome Dungeon, the Lord look down in mercy upon
me, not knowing how soon I shall be put to Death, by means of the Afflicted
Persons; my Grand-Father having Suffered already, and all his Estate Seized for
the King. The reason of my Confinement is this, I having, through the
Magistrates Threatnings, and my own Vile and Wretched Heart, confessed several
things contrary to my Conscience and Knowledg, tho to the Wounding of my own
Soul, the Lord pardon me for it; but Oh! the terrors of a wounded Conscience
who can bear. But blessed be the Lord, he would not let me go on in my Sins,
but in mercy I hope so my Soul would not suffer me to keep it in any longer, but
I was forced to confess the truth of all before the Magistrates, who would not
believe me, but tis their pleasure to put me in here, and God knows how soon I
shall be put to death. Dear Father, let me beg your Prayers to the Lord on my
behalf, and send us a Joyful and Happy meeting in Heaven. My Mother poor

<p>Giles Cory pleaded not Guilty to his Indictment, but would not put himself
upon Tryal by the Jury (they having cleared none upon Tryal) and knowing there
would be the same Witnesses against him, rather chose to undergo what Death
they would put him to. In pressing his Tongue being prest out of his Mouth, the
Sheriff with his Cane forced it in again, when he was dying. He was the first in
New-England, that was ever prest to Death.<ref target="n285">[285]</ref></p>

<p>Wardwell having formerly confessed himself Guilty, and after denied it,

was all that appeared against him. At Execution while he was speaking to the

smoaking Tobacco, the smoak coming in his Face, interrupted his Discourse,

them present, as Serious, Religious, Distinct, and Affectionate as could well be
exprest, drawing Tears from the Eyes of almost all present. It seems besides the
Testimony of the Accusers and Confessors, another proof, as it was counted,
appeared against her, it having been usual to search the Accused for Tets; upon
some parts of her Body, not here to be named, was found an Excrescence, which
they called a Tet. Before her Death she put up the following Petition:</p>
<div3 type="statement" id="d93">

<p>To the Honorable Judge and Bench now sitting in Judicature in Salem and
the Reverend Ministers, humbly sheweth, That whereas your humble poor
Petitioner being Condemned to die, doth humbly beg of you, to take it into your
Judicious and Pious Consideration, that your poor and humble Petitioner knowing
my own Innocency (blessed be the Lord for it) and seeing plainly the Wiles and
Subtilty of my Accusers, by my self, cannot but judge charitably of others, that
are going the same way with my self, if the Lord step not mightily in. I was
confined a whole Month on the same account that I am now condemned for, and
then cleared by the Afflicted persons, as some of your Honours know, and in two
days time I was cried out upon by them, and have been confined, and now am
condemned to die. The Lord above knows my Innocency then, and likewise doth
now, as at the great day will be known to Men and Angels. I Petition to your
Honours not for my own Life, for I know I must die, and my appointed time is
set; but the Lord he knows it is, if it be possible, that no more Innocent Blood
be shed, which undoubtedly cannot be avoided in the way and course you go in.
I question not, but your Honours do to the utmost of your powers, in the
discovery and detecting of Witchcraft and Witches, and would not be guilty of
Innocent Blood for the World; but by my own Innocency I know you are in the
wrong way. The Lord in his infinite Mercy direct you in this great work, if it be
his blessed will, that Innocent Blood be not shed; I would humbly beg of you,
that your Honours would be pleased to Examine some of those confessing
Witches, I being confident there are several of them have belyed themselves and
others, as will appear, if not in this World, I am sure in the World to come,
whither I am going; and I question not, but your selves will see an alteration in
these things: They say, my self and others have made a league with the Devil, we
cannot confess. I know and the Lord he knows (as will shortly appear) they belye
me, and so I question not but they do others; the Lord alone, who is the searcher
of all hearts, knows that as I shall answer it at the







<pb n="369"/>




Tribunal Seat, that I know not the least thing of Witchcraft, therefore I cannot,
I durst not belye my own Soul. I beg your Honours not to deny this my humble
Petition, from a poor dying Innocent person, and I question not but the Lord will
give a blessing to your Endeavours.</p>

<p>After Execution Mr. Noyes turning him to the Bodies, said, what a sad

<p>In <hi rend="italic">October</hi> 1692, One of Wenham<ref target="n286">[286]</ref>
complained of Mrs. Hale, whose Husband, the Minister of Beverly, had been
very forward in these Prosecutions, but being fully satisfied of his Wives sincere
Christianity, caused him to alter his Judgment; for it was come to a stated

in a good Man's shape; it seems nothing else could convince him: yet when it
came so near to himself, he was soon convinc'd that the Devil might so
Afflict.<ref target="n287">[287]</ref>

<p>Mr. Philip English and his Wife having made their Escape out of Prison,
Mr. Corwin the Sheriff seiz'd his Estate, to the value of about Fifteen Hundred
Pound, which was wholly lost to him, except about Three Hundred Pound value,
(which was afterward restored.)<ref target="n292">[292]</ref></p>


<p>After Goodwife Hoar was Condemned, her Estate was seiz'd, and was also
bought again for Eight Pound.</p>


<p>George Jacobs, Son to old Jacobs,<ref target="n293">[293]</ref> being accused, he fled, then the
Officers came to his House, his Wife was a Woman Crazy in her Senses and had
been so several Years. She it seems had been also accused; there were in the
House with her only four small Children, and one of them suck'd, her Eldest
Daughter<ref target="n294">[294]</ref> being in Prison; the Officer perswaded her out of the House, to go
along with him, telling her she should speedily return, the Children ran a great
way after her crying.</p>


<p>When she came where the Afflicted were, being asked, they said they did
not know her, at length one said, don't you know Jacobs the old Witch, and then
they cry'd out of her, and fell down in their Fits; she was sent to Prison, and lay
there Ten Months, the Neighbours of pitty took care of the Children to preserve
them from perishing.</p>


<p>About this time a New Scene was begun, one Joseph Ballard of Andover,
whose Wife was ill (and after died of a Fever) sent to Salem for some of those
Accusers, to tell him who

<pb n="372"/>




afflicted his Wife; others did the like: Horse and Man were sent from several
places to fetch those Accusers who had the Spectral sight, that they might thereby
tell who afflicted those that were any ways ill.</p>


<p>When these came into any place where such were, usually they fell into a
Fit; after which being asked who it was that afflicted the person, they would, for
the most part, name one whom they said sat on the head, and another that sat on
the lower parts of the afflicted. Soon after Ballard's sending (as above) more than
Fifty of the People of Andover were complained of, for afflicting their
Neighbours. Here it was that many accused themselves, of Riding upon Poles
through the Air; Many Parents believing their Children to be Witches, and many
Husbands their Wives, etc. When these Accusers came to the House of any upon
such account, it was ordinary for other young People to be taken in Fits, and to
have the same Spectral sight.</p>


<p>Mr. Dudley Bradstreet,<ref target="n295">[295]</ref> a Justice of Peace in Andover, having granted out
Warrants against, and Committed Thirty or Forty to Prisons, for the supposed
Witchcrafts, at length saw cause to forbear granting out any more Warrants. Soon
after which he and his Wife were cried out of, himself was (by them) said to have
killed Nine persons by Witchcraft, and found it his safest course to make his
Escape.</p>


<p>A Dog being afflicted at Salem-Village, those that had the Spectral sight
being sent for, they accused Mr. John Bradstreet (Brother to the Justice) that he
afflicted the said Dog, and now rid upon him: He made his Escape into
Pescattequa-Government,<ref target="n296">[296]</ref> and the Dog was put to death, and was all of the
Afflicted that suffered death.</p>


<p>At Andover, the Afflicted complained of a Dog, as afflicting of them, and
would fall into their Fits at the Dogs looking upon them; the Dog was put to
death.</p>


<p>A worthy Gentleman of Boston, being about this time accused by those at
Andover, he sent by some particular Friends a Writ to Arrest those Accusers in
a Thousand Pound Action for Defamation, with instructions to them, to inform
themselves of the certainty of the proof, in doing which their business was

<pb n="373"/>




perceived, and from thence forward the Accusations at Andover generally
ceased.<ref target="n297">[297]</ref></p>


<p>In October some of these Accusers were sent for to Glocester, and
occasioned four Women to be sent to Prison, but Salem Prison being so full it
could receive no more, two were sent to Ipswich Prison. In November they were
sent for again by Lieutenant Stephens, who was told that a Sister of his was
bewitched; in their way passing over Ipswich-bridge, they met with an old
Woman, and instantly fell into their Fits: But by this time the validity of such
Accusations being much questioned, they found not that Encouragement they had
done elsewhere, and soon withdrew.</p>


<p>These Accusers swore that they saw three persons sitting upon Lieutenant
Stephens's Sister till she died; yet Bond was accepted for those Three.</p>


<p>And now Nineteen persons having been hang'd, and one prest to death, and
Eight more condemned, in all Twenty and Eight, of which above a third part
were Members of some of the Churches in N. England, and more than half of
them of a good Conversation in general, and not one clear'd; About Fifty having
confest themselves to be Witches, of which not one Executed; above an Hundred
and Fifty in Prison, and above Two Hundred more accused; The Special
Commission of Oyer and Terminer comes to a period,<ref target="n298">[298]</ref> which has no other
foundation than the Governours Commission,<ref target="n299">[299]</ref> and had proceeded in the manner
of swearing Witnesses, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> By holding up the hand,
(and by receiving Evidences in writing) according to the Ancient Usage of this
Countrey; as also having their Indictments in English. In the Tryals, when any
were Indicted for Afflicting, Pining, and wasting the Bodies of particular persons
by Witchcraft; it was usual to hear Evidence of matter foreign, and of perhaps
Twenty or Thirty years standing, about over-setting Carts, the death of Cattle, un

kindness to Relations, or unexpected Accidents befalling after some quarrel.
Whether this was admitted by the Law of England, or by what other Law, wants
to be determined; the Executions seemed mixt, in pressing to death for not
pleading, which most agrees with the Laws of England, and Sentencing Women
to be hanged for Witchcraft, according to the former practice of this Country, and
not by burning, as is said to have been the Law of England.<ref target="n300">[300]</ref> And though the
confessing Witches were many; yet not one of them that confessed their own
guilt, and abode by their Confession were put to Death.<ref target="n301">[301]</ref></p>


<p>Here followeth what account some of those miserable Creatures give of
their Confession under their own hands.</p>
<div3 type="decree" id="d97">

<p>We whose Names are under written, Inhabitants of Andover, when as that
horrible and tremendous Judgment beginning at Salem-Village, in the Year 1692,
(by some) call'd Witchcraft, first breaking forth at Mr. Parris's House, several
Young persons being seemingly afflicted, did accuse several persons for afflicting
them, and many there believing it so to be; we being informed that if a person
were sick, that the afflicted persons could tell, what or who was the cause of that
sickness. Joseph Ballard of Andover (his Wife being sick at the same time) he
either from himself, or by the advice of others, fetch'd two of the persons call'd
the afflicted persons, from Salem-Village to Andover. Which was the beginning
of that dreadful Calamity that befel us in Andover. And the Authority in
Andover, believing the said Accusations to be true, sent for the said persons to
come together, to the Meeting-house in Andover (the afflicted persons

<pb n="375"/>



being there.) After Mr. Bernard<ref target="n302">[302]</ref> had been at Prayer, we were blindfolded,
and our hands were laid upon the afflicted persons, they being in their Fits, and
falling into their Fits at our coming into their presence (as they said) and some
led us and laid our hands upon them, and then they said they were well, and that
we were guilty of afflicting of them; whereupon we were all seized as Prisoners,
by a Warrant from the Justice of the Peace, and forthwith carried to Salem. And
by reason of that suddain surprizal, we knowing our selves altogether Innocent
of that Crime, we were all exceedingly astonished and amazed, and consternated
and affrighted even out of our Reason; and our nearest and dearest Relations,
seeing us in that dreadful condition, and knowing our great danger, apprehending
that there was no other way to save our lives, as the case was then
circumstantiated, but by our confessing our selves to be such and such persons,
as the afflicted represented us to be, they out of tender love and pitty perswaded
us to confess what we did confess. And indeed that Confession, that is said we
made, was no other than what was suggested to us by some Gentlemen; they
telling us, that we were Witches, and they knew it, and we knew it, and they
knew that we knew it, which made us think that it was so; and our understanding,
our reason, and our faculties almost gone, we were not capable of judging our
condition; as also the hard measures they used with us, rendred us uncapable of
making our Defence; but said any thing and every thing which they desired, and
most of what we said, was but in effect a consenting to what they said. Sometime
after when we were better composed, they telling of us what we had confessed,
we did profess that we were Innocent, and Ignorant of such things. And we
hearing that Samuel Wardwell had renounced his Confession, and quickly after
Condemned and Executed, some of us were told that we were going after
Wardwell.</p>

<p>It may here be further added concerning those that did Confess, that besides
that powerful Argument, of Life (and

<pb n="376"/>
freedom from hardships and Irons not only promised, but
also performed to all that owned their guilt), There are numerous
Instances, too many to be here inserted, of the tedious Examinations
before private persons, many hours together; they all that time urging
them to Confess (and taking turns to perswade them) till the accused
were wearied out by being forced to stand so long, or for want of
Sleep, etc. and so brought to give an Assent to what they said; they
then asking them , Were you at such a Witch-meeting, or have you
signed the Devil's Book, etc. upon their replying, yes, the whole was
drawn into form as their Confession.

</p><p>But that which did mightily further such Confessions, was their
nearest and dearest Relations urging them to it. These seeing no other
way of escape for them, thought it the best advice that could be
given; hence it was that the Husbands of some, by counsel often

the most impudent, scurrilous, wicked Creatures in the World.&rdquo; In his
Account of Martha Carryer, he is pleased to call her &ldquo;a Rampant
Hag,&rdquo;<ref target="n312">[312]</ref> etc.</p>


<p>These Expressions, as they manifest that he wrote more like an Advocate
than an Historian,<ref target="n313">[313]</ref> so also that those
that were his Imployers<ref target="n314">[314]</ref> were not mistaken
in their choice of him for that work, however he may have mist it in other
things.</p>


<p>As in his owning (in the Tryal of G. B.) That the Testimony of the
bewitched and confessors was not enough against the Accused, for it is known
that not only in New-England, such Evidence has been taken for sufficient, but
also in England, as himself there owns, and will also hold true of Scotland, etc.,
they having proceeded upon such Evidence, to the taking away of the Lives of
many, to assert that this is not enough is to tell the World that such Executions
were but so many Bloody Murders; which surely was not his intent to say.</p>


<p>His telling that the Court began to think that Burroughs stept aside to put
on invisibility, is a rendring them so mean Philosophers, and such weak
Christians, as to be fit to be imposed upon by any silly pretender.</p>


<p>His calling the Evidence against How trivial, and others against Burroughs,
he accounts no part of his Conviction; and that of lifting a Gun with one Finger,
its being not made use of as Evidence, renders the whole but the more perplext.
(Not to mention the many mistakes therein contain'd.)<ref target="n315">[315]</ref></p>


<p>Yet all this (and more that might have been hinted at) does not hinder, but
that his Account of the manner of Trials of those for Witchcraft is as faithfully
related as any Tryals of that kind, that was ever yet made
publick;<ref target="n316">[316]</ref> and it may
also

<pb n="380"/>




be reasonably thought that there was as careful a Scrutiny, and as unquestion'd
Evidences improved, as had been formerly used in the Tryals of others, for such
crimes in other places. Tho indeed a second part might be very useful, to set
forth which was the Evidence Convictive in these Tryals, for it is not supposed,
that Romantick or Ridiculous stories should have any influence, such as biting a
Spectres Finger, so that the Blood flowed out, or such as Shattock's Story of 12
Years standing, which yet was presently 18 Years or more, and yet a Man of that
excellent Memory, as to be able to recall a small difference his Wife had with
another Woman, when Eighteen Years were past.<ref target="n317">[317]</ref></p>


<p>As it is not to be supposed that such as these could Influence any Judge or
Jury, so not unkindness to relations, or God's having given to one Man more
strength than to some others, the over-setting of Carts, or the death of Cattle, nor
yet Excrescencies (call'd Tets) nor little bits of Rags tied together (call'd
Poppets.) Much less any persons illness, or having their Cloaths rent when a
Spectre has been well banged, much less the burning the Mares Fart, mentioned
in the Tryal of How.<ref target="n318">[318]</ref></p>


<p>None of these being in the least capable of proving the Indictment; The
supposed Criminals were Indicted for Afflicting, etc., such and such particular
persons by Witchcraft, to which none of these Evidences have one word to say,
and the Afflicted and Confessors being declared not enough, the matter needs yet
further explaining.<ref target="n319">[319]</ref></p>


<pb n="381"/>


<p>But to proceed, the General Court having sat and enacted Laws, particularly
one against Witchcraft, assigning the Penalty of Death to any that shall feed,
reward or employ, etc., Evil Spirits, though it has not yet been explained what
is intended thereby, or what it is to feed, reward or imploy Devils, etc., yet some
of the Legislators have given this instead of an Explanation, that they had therein
but Copied the Law of another Country.<ref target="n320">[320]</ref></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 3. By vertue of an Act of the General
Court, the first Superior Court was held at Salem, for the County of Essex, the
Judges appointed were Mr. William Stoughton (the Lieutenant Governour)
Thomas Danforth, John Richards, Wait Winthorp,<ref target="n321">[321]</ref> and Samuel Sewall, Esquires,
Where Ignoramus<ref target="n322">[322]</ref> was found upon the several Bills of Indictment against Thirty,
and <hi rend="italic">Billa Vera</hi><ref target="n323">[323]</ref> against Twenty six more; of all
these Three only were found Guilty by the Jewry upon Trial, two of which were
(as appears by their Behaviour) the most senseless and Ignorant Creatures that
could be found;<ref target="n324">[324]</ref> besides which it does not appear what came in against those
more than against the rest that were acquitted.<ref target="n325">[325]</ref></p>


<p>The Third was the Wife of Wardwell, who was one of the Twenty
Executed, and it seems they had both confessed themselves Guilty; but he
retracting his said Confession, was tried and Executed;<ref target="n326">[326]</ref> it is supposed that this
Woman fearing her Husbands fate, was not so stiff in her denyals of her former
Confession, such as it was. These Three received Sentence of Death.</p>


<p>At these Tryals some of the Jewry made Inquiry of the Court, what
Account they ought to make of the Spectre Evidence? and received for Answer
&ldquo;as much as of Chips in Wort.&rdquo;<ref target="n327">[327]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">January</hi> 31, 169 2/3. The Superior Court began
at Charles-town, for the County of Middlesex, Mr. Stoughton, Mr. Danforth, Mr.
Winthorp, and Mr. Sewall Judges, where several had Ignoramus returned upon
their Bills of Indictment, and <hi rend="italic">Billa Vera</hi> upon
others.</p>


<p>In the time the Court sat, word was brought in, that a Reprieve was sent
to Salem,<ref target="n328">[328]</ref> and had prevented the Execution of Seven of those that were there
Condemned, which so moved the chief Judge,<ref target="n329">[329]</ref> that he said to this effect,
&ldquo;We were in a way to have cleared the Land of these, etc., who
it is obstructs

<pb n="383"/>




the course of Justice I know not; the Lord be merciful to the
Countrey,&rdquo; and so went off the Bench, and came no more that Court: The
most remarkable of the Tryals, was of Sarah Daston, she was a Woman of about
70 or 80 Years of Age. To usher in her Tryal, a report went before, that if there
were a Witch in the World she was one, as having been so accounted of, for 20
or 30 Years; which drew many People from Boston, etc., to hear her Tryal.
There were a multitude of Witnesses produced against her; but what Testimony
they gave in seemed wholly forreign, as of accidents, illness, etc., befalling them,
or theirs after some Quarrel; what these testified was much of it of Actions said
to be done 20 Years before that time. The Spectre-Evidence was not made use of
in these Tryals, so that the Jewry soon brought her in not Guilty; her Daughter
and Grand-daughter, and the rest that were then tried, were also acquitted. After
she was cleared Judge Danforth Admonished her in these words, &ldquo;Woman,
Woman, repent, there are shrewd things come in against you&rdquo;; she was
remanded to Prison for her Fees, and there in a short time expired. One of
Boston that had been at the Tryal of Daston, being the same Evening in company
with one of the Judges in a publick place, acquainted him that some that had been
both at the Tryals at Salem and at this at Charlestown, had asserted that there was
more Evidence against the said Daston than against any at Salem, to which the
said Judge conceeded, saying, That it was so. It was replied by that person, that
he dare give it under his hand, that there was not enough come in against her to
bear a just reproof.<ref target="n330">[330]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">April</hi> 25, 1693. The first Superiour Court was
held at Boston, for the County of Suffolk, the Judges were the Lieutenant
Governour, Mr. Danforth, Mr. Richards and Mr. Sewall, Esquires.</p>


<p>Where (besides the acquitting Mr. John Aldin by Proclamation) the most
remarkable was, what related to Mary Watkins, who had been a Servant, and
lived about Seven Miles from Boston, having formerly Accused her Mistress of
Witch

<pb n="384"/>




craft, and was supposed to be distracted, she was threatned if she persisted in
such Accusations to be punished; this with the necessary care to recover her
Health, had that good effect, that she not only had her Health restored, but also
wholly acquitted her Mistress of any such Crimes, and continued in Health till the
return of the Year, and then again falling into Melancholly humours she was
found strangling her self; her Life being hereby prolonged, she immediately
accused her self of being a Witch; was carried before a Magistrate and
committed. At this Court a Bill of Indictment was brought to the Grand Jury
against her, and her confession upon her Examination given in as Evidence, but
these not wholly satisfied herewith, sent for her, who gave such account of her
self, that they (after they had returned into the Court to ask some Questions)
Twelve of them agreed to find Ignoramus, but the Court was pleased to send
them out again, who again at coming in returned it as before.</p>


<p>She was continued for some time in Prison, etc., and at length was sold to
Virginia.<ref target="n331">[331]</ref> About this time the
Prisoners in all the Prisons were released.<ref target="n332">[332]</ref></p>


<p>To omit here the mentioning of several Wenches in Boston, etc., who
pretended to be Afflicted, and accused several, the Ministers often visiting them,
and praying with them, concerning whose Affliction Narratives are in being in
Manuscript.<ref target="n333">[333]</ref> Not only these, but the generality of those Accusers may have since
convinc'd the Ministers by their vicious courses that they might err in extending
too much Charity to them.</p>


<p>The conclusion of the whole in the Massachusetts Colony was, Sir William
Phips, Governour, being call'd home, before he went he pardon'd such as had
been condemned, for which they gave about 30 Shillings each to the Kings
Attorney.<ref target="n334">[334]</ref></p>


<pb n="385"/>



<p>In <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 1697. The Superiour Court sat at
Hartford, in the Colony of Connecticut, where one Mistress Benom was tried for
Witchcraft, she had been accused by some Children that pretended to the Spectral
sight; they searched her several times for Tets; they tried the Experiment of
casting her into the Water,<ref target="n335">[335]</ref> and after this she was Excommunicated by the
Minister of Wallinsford.<ref target="n336">[336]</ref> Upon her Tryal nothing material appearing against her,
save Spectre Evidence, she was acquitted, as also her Daughter, a Girl of Twelve
or Thirteen Years old, who had been likewise Accused; but upon renewed
Complaints against them, they both fled into New-York Government.<ref target="n337">[337]</ref></p>


<p>Before this the Government Issued forth the following
Proclamation.<ref target="n338">[338]</ref></p>

<p>Whereas the Anger of God is not yet turned away, but his Hand is still
stretched out against his People in manifold Judgments, particularly in drawing
out to such a length the troubles of Europe, by a perplexing War; and more

cannot but wonder at the Patience and Mercy moderating these Rebukes; yet we
cannot but also fear that there is something still wanting to accompany our
Supplications. And doubtless there are some particular Sins, which God is Angry
with our Israel for, that have not been duly seen and resented by us, about which
God expects to be sought, if ever he turn again our Captivity.</p>


<p>Wherefore it is Commanded and Appointed, that Thursday the Fourteenth
of January next be observed as a Day of Prayer, with Fasting throughout this
Province, strictly forbidding all Servile labour thereon; that so all Gods People
may offer up fervent Supplications unto him, for the Preservation, and Prosperity
of his Majesty's Royal Person and Government, and Success to attend his Affairs
both at home and abroad; that all iniquity may be put away which hath stirred
God's Holy jealousie against this Land; that he would shew us what we know not,
and help us wherein we have done amiss to do so no more; and especially that
whatever mistakes on either hand have been fallen into, either by the body of this
People, or any orders of men, referring to the late Tragedy, raised among us by
Satan and his Instruments, thro the awful Judgment of God, he would humble us
therefore<ref target="n340">[340]</ref>and pardon all the Errors of his Servants and People, that desire to

<p>We whose names are under written, being in the Year 1692 called to serve
as Jurors, in Court at Salem, on Tryal of many, who were by some suspected
Guilty of doing Acts of Witchcraft upon the Bodies of sundry Persons:</p>


<p>We confess that we our selves were not capable to understand, nor able to
withstand the mysterious delusions of the Powers of Darkness, and Prince of the
Air; but were for want of Knowledge in our selves, and better Information from
others, prevailed with to take up with such Evidence against the Accused, as on
further consideration, and better Information, we justly fear was insufficient for
the touching the Lives of any, Deut. 17. 6, whereby we fear we have been
instrumental with others, tho Ignorantly and unwittingly, to bring upon our
selves, and this People of the Lord, the Guilt of Innocent Blood; which Sin the
Lord saith in Scripture, he would not pardon, 2 Kings 24. 4, that is we suppose
in regard of his temporal Judgments. We do therefore hereby signifie to all in
general (and to the surviving Sufferers in especial) our deep sense of, and sorrow
for our Errors, in acting on such Evidence to the condemning of any
person.</p>


<p>And do hereby declare that we justly fear that we were sadly deluded and
mistaken, for which we are much disquieted and dis

Christ's sake for this our Error; And pray that God would not impute the guilt
of it to our selves, nor others; and we also pray that we may be considered
candidly, and aright by the living Sufferers as being then under the power of a
strong and general Delusion, utterly unacquainted with, and not experienced in
matters of that Nature.</p>


<p>We do heartily ask forgiveness of you all, whom we have justly offended,
and do declare according to our present minds, we would none of us do such
things again on such grounds for the whole World; praying you to accept of this
in way of Satisfaction for our Offence; and that you would bless the Inheritance
of the Lord, that he may be intreated for the Land.</p>

<p>Mr. C. M. having been very forward to write Books of Witchcraft, has not
been so forward either to explain or defend the Doctrinal part thereof, and his
belief (which he had a Years time to compose) he durst not venture so as to be
copied.<ref target="n343">[343]</ref>

<pb n="389"/>




Yet in this of the Life of Sir William he sufficiently testifies his retaining that
Heterodox belief, seeking by frightfull stories of the sufferings of some, and the
refined sight of others, etc., P. 69 to obtrude upon the World, and confirm it in
such a belief, as hitherto he either cannot or will not defend, as if the Blood
already shed thereby were not sufficient.</p>


<p>Mr. I. Mather, in his <hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>,
P. 25, tells of a Bewitched Eye, and that such can see more than others. They
were certainly bewitched Eyes that could see as well shut as open, and that could
see what never was, that could see the Prisoners upon the Afflicted, harming of
them, when those whose Eyes were not bewitched could have sworn that they did
not stir from the Bar. The Accusers are said to have suffered much by biting, P.
73. And the prints of just such a set of Teeth, as those they Accused, had, but
such as had not such bewitch'd Eyes have seen the Accusers bite themselves, and
then complain of the Accused. It has also been seen when the Accused, instead
of having just such a set of Teeth, has not had one in his head. They were such
bewitched Eyes that could see the Poisonous Powder (brought by Spectres P. 70.)
And that could see in the Ashes the print of the Brand, there invisibly heated to
torment the pretended Sufferers with, etc.</p>


<p>These with the rest of such Legends have this direct tendency, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> To tell the World that the Devil is more ready to
serve his Votaries, by his doing for them things above or against the course of
Nature, shewing himself to them, and making explicit contract with them, etc.,
than the Divine Being is to his faithful Servants, and that as he is willing, so also
able to perform their desires. The way whereby these People are believed to
arrive at a power to Afflict their Neighbours, is by a compact with the Devil, and
that they have a power to Commissionate him to those Evils, P. 72. However
Irrational, or Inscriptural such Assertions are, yet they seem

<pb n="390"/>




a necessary part of the Faith of such as maintain the belief of such a sort of
Witches.</p>


<p>As the Scriptures know nothing of a covenanting or commissioning Witch,
so Reason cannot conceive how Mortals should by their Wickedness arrive at a
power to Commissionate Angels, Fallen Angels, against their Innocent
Neighbours. But the Scriptures are full in it, and the Instances numerous, that the
Almighty, Divine Being has this prerogative to make use of what Instrument he
pleaseth, in Afflicting any, and consequently to commissionate Devils: And tho
this word commissioning, in the Authors former Books, might be thought to be
by inadvertency; yet now after he hath been caution'd of it, still to persist in it
seems highly Criminal. And therefore in the name of God, I here charge such
belief as guilty of Sacriledge in the highest Nature, and so much worse than
stealing Church Plate, etc., As it is a higher Offence to steal any of the glorious
Attributes of the Almighty, to bestow them upon Mortals, than it is to steal the
Utensils appropriated to his Service. And whether to ascribe such power of
commissioning Devils to the worst of Men, be not direct Blasphemy, I leave to
others better able to determine. When the Pharisees were so wicked as to ascribe
to Beelzebub, the mighty works of Christ (whereby he did manifestly shew forth
his Power and Godhead) then it was that our Saviour declar'd the Sin against the
Holy Ghost to be unpardonable.</p>


<p>When the Righteous God is contending with Apostate Sinners, for their
departures from him, by his Judgments, as Plagues, Earthquakes, Storms and
Tempests, Sicknesses and Diseases, Wars, loss of Cattle, etc. Then not only to
ascribe this to the Devil, but to charge one another with sending or
commissionating those Devils to these things, is so abominable and so wicked,
that it requires a better Judgment than mine to give it its just denomination.</p>


<p>But that Christians so called should not only charge their fellow Christians
therewith, but proceed to Tryals and Executions; crediting that Enemy to all
Goodness, and Accuser of the Brethren, rather than believe their Neighbours in
their own Defence; This is so Diabolical a Wickedness as cannot proceed, but
from a Doctrine of Devils; how far damnable it is let others discuss. Tho such
things were acting in this

<pb n="391"/>




Country in Sir Williams time, yet p. 65. there is a Discourse of a Guardian
Angel, as then over-seeing it, which notion, however it may suit the Faith of
Ethnicks,<ref target="n344">[344]</ref> or the fancies of
Trithemius,<ref target="n345">[345]</ref> it is certain that the Omnipresent Being
stands not in need as Earthly Potentates do, of governing the World by
Vicegerents. And if Sir William had such an Invisible pattern to imitate, no
wonder tho some of his Actions were unaccountable, especially those relating to
Witchcraft: For if there was in those Actions an Angel super-intending, there is
little reason to think it was Gabriel or the Spirit of Mercury, nor Hanael the
Angel or Spirit of Venus, nor yet Samuel the Angel or Spirit of Mars; Names
feigned by the said Trithemius, etc. It may rather be thought to be Apollyon, or
Abaddon.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi><ref target="n346">[346]</ref> But here it will be said, &ldquo;What,
are there no Witches? Do's not the Law of God command that they should be
extirpated? Is the Command vain and Unintelligible?&rdquo; <hi
rend="italic">Sol.</hi><ref target="n347">[347]</ref> For any to say that a Witch is one that makes a
compact with, and Commissions Devils, etc., is indeed to render the Law of God
vain and Unintelligible, as having provided no way whereby they might be
detected, and proved to be such; And how the Jews waded thro this difficulty for
so many Ages, without the Supplement of Mr. Perkins and Bernard thereto,
would be very mysterious. But to him that can read the Scriptures without
prejudice from Education, etc., it will manifestly appear that the Scripture is full
and Intelligible, both as to the Crime and means to detect the culpable. He that
shall hereafter see any person, who to confirm People in a false belief, about the
power of Witches and Devils, pretending to a sign to confirm it, such as knocking
off of invisible Chains with the hand, driving away Devils by brushing, striking
with a Sword or Stick, to wound a person at a great distance, etc., may
(according to that head of Mr. Gauls, quoted by Mr. C. M. and so often herein
before recited, and so well proved by Scripture) conclude that he has seen
Witchcraft performed.</p>


<pb n="392"/>

<p>If Baalam became a Sorcerer by Sacrifizing and Praying to the true God
against his visible people; Then he that shall pray that the afflicted (by their
Spectral Sight) may accuse some other Person (whereby their reputations and
lives may be indangered) such will justly deserve the Name of a Sorcerer. If any
Person pretends to know more then<ref target="n348">[348]</ref> can be known by humane means, and
professeth at the same time that they have it from the Black-Man, <hi
rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the Devil, and shall from hence give Testimony
against the Lives of others, they are manifestly such as have a familiar Spirit; and
if any, knowing them to have their Information from the Black-Man, shall be
inquisitive of them for their Testimony against others, they therein are dealing
with such as have a Familiar-Spirit.</p>


<p>And if these shall pretend to see the dead by their Spectral Sight, and others
shall be inquisitive of them, and receive their Answers what it is the dead say,
and who it is they accuse, both the one and the other are by Scripture Guilty of
Necromancy.</p>


<p>These are all of them crimes as easily proved as any whatsoever, and that
by such proof as the Law of God requires, so that it is no Unintelligible
Law.</p>


<p>But if the Iniquity of the times be such, that these Criminals not only
Escape Indemnified,<ref target="n349">[349]</ref> but are Incouraged in their Wickedness, and made use of
to take away the Lives of others, this is worse than a making the Law of God
Vain, it being a rendring of it dangerous, against the Lives of Innocents, and
without all hopes of better, so long as these Bloody Principles remain.</p>


<p>As long as Christians do Esteem the Law of God to be Imperfect, as not
describing that crime that it requires to be Punish'd by Death;</p>


<p>As long as men suffer themselves to be Poison'd in their Education, and be
grounded in a False Belief by the Books of the Heathen;</p>


<p>As long as the Devil shall be believed to have a Natural Power, to Act
above and against a course of Nature;</p>


<p>As long as the Witches shall be believed to have a Power to Commission
him;</p>


<p>As long as the Devils Testimony, by the pretended afflicted,

<pb n="393"/>




shall be received as more valid to Condemn, than their Plea of Not Guilty to
acquit;</p>


<p>As long as the Accused shall have their Lives and Liberties confirmed and
restored to them, upon their Confessing themselves Guilty;</p>


<p>As long as the Accused shall be forc't to undergo Hardships and Torments
for their not Confessing;</p>


<p>As long as Tets for the Devil to Suck are searched for upon the Bodies of
the accused, as a token of guilt;</p>


<p>As long as the Lords Prayer shall be profaned, by being made a Test, who
are culpable;</p>


<p>As long as Witchcraft, Sorcery, Familiar Spirits, and Necromancy, shall
be improved to discover who are Witches, etc.,</p>


<p>So long it may be expected that Innocents will suffer as Witches.</p>


<p>So long God will be Daily dishonoured, And so long his Judgments must
be expected to be continued.</p>

by a Righteous Sentence. Mr. Burrough by his Speech, Prayer, protestation of his

He alone, as the senior in age and in dignity, could with propriety be thus given
the first place; and his son, if named at all, would have been identified as
&ldquo;Mr. Cotton Mather.&rdquo; That he is not named at all needs no
explanation to those who have read his own words as to accusers and accused and
his complaints as to the blame heaped upon himself. Of Moody, Willard, Bailey,
we have perhaps seen enough in earlier pages to guess why such an appeal might
with hope be addressed to them. The Boston Tory Joshua Broadbent, writing on
June 21 from New York, reported that &ldquo;Mrs. Moody, Parson Moody's
wife, is said to be one&rdquo; of the witches. (<hi rend="italic">Calendar
of State Papers, Colonial</hi>, 1689-1692, p. 653.) Of Allen, the well-to-do
minister of the First Church, who seems to have been a man of much caution, it
may be well to remember that prior to 1678 he had owned the estate at Salem
Village since occupied, but not yet in full ownership, by the Nurses, Procter's
near neighbors, and that he was doubtless personally known to the petitioner.
Bailey, who had come to America in 1683, had at first assisted Willard at the
South Church, and, after a pastorate at Watertown, was now Allen's assistant at
the First.</p></note>

For some of the evidence extorted by it in this case see <hi
rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, p. 198. The use of torture
in cases of witchcraft had been recommended by Perkins, the Puritan oracle, and
yet more warmly by King James; and despite protesting jurists it came into use.
Even Coke, who maintains that &ldquo;there is no Law to warrant tortures in this
land, nor can they be justified by any prescription,&rdquo; has to add
&ldquo;being so lately brought in&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Institutes</hi>, III., cap. 2). As to its actual use in English
witch-trials see Notestein, <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft in England</hi>,
index, <hi rend="italic">s. v.
</hi> &ldquo;Torture.&rdquo; But Massachusetts law, from 1641 on, had
straitly forbidden it except, after conviction, to extort the names of accomplices;
and even then forbade &ldquo;such tortures as be barbarous and
inhumane&rdquo; (see <hi rend="italic">Body of Liberties</hi>, par. 45;
ed. of 1660, p. 67; ed. of 1672, p. 129). If in 1648 the highest court of the
colony, learning with admiration of the achievements of Matthew Hopkins in
England, was &ldquo;desirous that the same course which hath been taken in
England for the discovery of witches, by watchinge, may also be taken
here,&rdquo; and ordered, in the case of a witch, that &ldquo;a strict watch be
set about her every night, and that her husband be confined to a private room,
and watched also&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Records of
Massachusetts</hi>, III. 126), their phrasing betrays how little they understood
the rigor of the English method. In 1692 even Cotton Mather declared himself
&ldquo;farr from urging the un-English method of torture&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Mather Papers</hi>, p. 394), though he urged on the judges
&ldquo;whatever hath a tendency to put the witches into confusion,&rdquo; such
as &ldquo;Crosse and Swift Questions.&rdquo; But the procedure of that day,
like our own, drew a line between what might be used in the courts and what
might be permitted to extra-judicial inquiry, and we shall see yet more of methods
used at Salem to extort confession.</p></note>

whereas your poor and humble declarant being closely
confined here in Salem jail for the crime of witchcraft, which crime, thanks be
to the Lord, I am altogether ignorant of, as will appear at the great day of
judgment. May it please the honoured court, I was cried out upon by some of the
possessed persons, as afflicting of them; whereupon I was brought to my
examination, which persons at the sight of me fell down, which did very much
startle and affright me. The Lord above knows I knew nothing, in the least
measure, how or who afflicted them; they told me, without doubt I did, or else
they would not fall down at me; they told me if I would not confess, I should be
put down into the dungeon and would be hanged, but if I would confess I should
have my life; the which did so affright me, with my own vile wicked heart, to
save my life made me make the confession I did, which confession, may it please
the honoured court, is altogether false and untrue. The very first night after I had
made my confession, I was in such horror of conscience that I could not sleep,
for fear the Devil should carry me away for telling such horrid lies. I was, may
it please the honoured court, sworn to my confession, as I understand since, but
then, at that time, was ignorant of it, not knowing what an oath did mean. The
Lord, I hope, in whom I trust, out of the abundance of his mercy, will forgive
me my false forswearing myself. What I said was altogether false, against my
grandfather, and Mr. Burroughs, which I did to save my life and to have my
liberty; but the Lord, charging it to my conscience, made me in so much horror,
that I could not contain myself before I had denied my confession, which I did,
though I saw nothing but death before me, choosing rather death with a quiet
conscience, than to live in such horror, which I could not suffer. Whereupon my
denying my confession, I was committed to close prison, where I have enjoyed
more felicity in spirit a thousand times than I did before in my
enlargement.</p><p>&ldquo;And now, may it please your honours, your poor and humble
declarant having, in part, given your honours a description of my condition, do
leave it to your honours pious and judicious discretions to take pity and
compassion on my young and tender years; to act and do with me as the Lord
above and your honours shall see good, having no friend but the Lord to plead
my cause for me; not being guilty in the least measure of the crime of witchcraft,
nor any other sin that deserves death from man; and your poor and humble

published in the <hi rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>,
XXVII. 55) must have had to do with Mr. Hale's change of view:</p><p>&ldquo;An Account Received from the mouth of Mary Herrick aged about
17 yeares having been Afflicted [by] the Devill or some of his instruments, about
2 month. She saith she had oft been Afflicted and that the shape of Mrs. Hayle
had been represented to her, One amongst others, but she knew not what hand
Afflicted her then, but on the 5th of the 9th [<hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>,
November] She Appeared again with the Ghost of Gooddee Easty, and that then
Mrs. Hayle did sorely Afflict her by pinching, pricking and Choaking her. On the
12th of the 9th she Came again and Gooddee Easty with her and then Mrs. Hayle
did Afflict her as formerly. Sd Easty made as if she would speake but did not,
but on the same night they Came again and Mrs. Hayle did sorely Afflict her,
and asked her if she thought she was a Witch. The Girl answered no, You be the
Devill. Then said Easty sd and speake, She Came to tell her She had been put to
Death wrongfully and was Innocent of Witchcraft, and she Came to Vindicate her
Cause and she Cryed Vengeance, Vengeance, and bid her reveal this to Mr.
Hayle and Gerish, and then she would rise no more, nor should Mrs. Hayle
Afflict her any more. Memorand: that Just before sd Easty was Executed, She
Appeared to sd Girl, and said I am going upon the Ladder to be hanged for a
Witch, but I am innocent, and before a 12 Month be past you shall believe it. Sd
Girl sd she speake not of this before because she believed she was Guilty, Till
Mrs. Hayle appeared to her and Afflicted her, but now she believeth it is all a
Delusion of the Devil.</p><p>&ldquo;This before Mr. Hayle and Gerish 14th of the 9th
1692.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gerish&rdquo; means the Rev. Joseph Gerrish, of Wenham, who

wealth and exceptional prominence. He had come in early life from the island of
Jersey and at Salem had married, in 1675, the daughter and heiress of the
merchant William Hollingworth. His wife, now thirty-nine, a lady of education
and refinement, was arrested on April 22 (see p. 347, above) and on April 30 a

in his Boston hiding-place, he was on May 31 committed, but was allowed to give

<note id="n299"><seg type="note-symbol">[299].</seg> <p>The implication perhaps is that the governor exceeded his powers. That
question has been much and hotly debated &mdash; most learnedly by Mr. A. C.
Goodell in his <hi rend="italic">Further Notes on the History of Witchcraft
in Massachusetts</hi> (Cambridge, 1884), pp. 20 ff., and Dr. G. H. Moore in

<note id="n300"><seg type="note-symbol">[300].</seg> <p>This is an error. In England, too, witches were hanged &mdash; unless
convicted of bewitching to death their husbands, when for husband-murder,
&ldquo;petty treason,&rdquo; they were burned (see Coke, <hi
rend="italic">Institutes</hi>, pt. III., cap. 2, 6, 101, and the records of the
courts). Sir Matthew Hale indeed makes witchcraft &ldquo;at Common
Law&rdquo; still &ldquo;punished with death, as Heresie, by Writ <hi
rend="italic">De H&aelig;retico Comburendo</hi>&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Pleas of the Crown</hi>, p. 6). But this, of course, was after
trial by an ecclesiastical court; and since the Reformation ecclesiastical courts had
not had cognizance of such cases.</p></note>

<note id="n301"><seg type="note-symbol">[301].</seg> <p>This, the most striking feature of the Salem trials, is perhaps partially
explained by the closing suggestion of Cotton Mather's advice to the judges (<hi
rend="italic">Mather Papers</hi>, p. 396): &ldquo;What if some of the
lesser Criminalls be onely scourged with lesser punishments, and also put upon
some solemn, open, Publike and Explicitt renunciation of the Divil?... Or what
if the death of some of the offenders were either diverted or inflicted, according
to the successe of such their renunciation?&rdquo; If it was unique that those who
confessed escaped death, it was nothing unique that they should be reckoned
&ldquo;lesser Criminalls.&rdquo;</p></note>

<note id="n302"><seg type="note-symbol">[302].</seg> <p>The Rev. Thomas Barnard, associate minister at Andover. Dane, his
senior, seems to have been averse to the proceedings.</p></note>

<note id="n303"><seg type="note-symbol">[303].</seg> <p>This is doubtless what Brattle calls (p. 189, above) &ldquo;a petition
lately offered to the chief Judge.&rdquo; The examination and confession of
Mary Osgood may be found in Hutchinson's <hi
rend="italic">Massachusetts</hi>, II. ch. I. (or in Poole's reprint, <hi
rend="italic">N. E. Hist. and Gen. Register</hi>, XXIV. 398). She, the two
Tylers, and Abigail Barker were tried and acquitted in January at the first session
of the new Superior Court (see in vol. X. of the <hi
rend="italic">Publications</hi> of the Colonial Society of Massachusetts the
brief but valuable paper of John Noble, pp. 12-26).</p></note>


<note id="n304"><seg type="note-symbol">[304]The</seg> <p>best commentary on these words is a remarkable paper which
more than a century ago came into the hands of the Massachusetts
Historical Society and was published in its <hi rend="italic">Collections</hi>
(second series, 111. 221-225). As Dr. Belknap, who prepared it for
publication, labelled it "Remainder of the account of the Salem
Witchcraft" and seems to have meant it to be printed with Brattle's
letter (see pp. 169-190, above), it is not improbable that, with that
document, it had come from the family of Brattle and that it was
originally his. In that case it is by no means impossible that in his
hands Calef may have seen it and that from him he may have received
the recantation printed just above. The added paper runs:</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Salem</hi>,
Oct. 19, '92. The Rev. Mr. 1. Mather went to Salem
[to visit] the confessours (so called): He conferred with several of
them, and they spake as follows:" [Then are narrated the explanations
given by eleven of the women, the most suggestive being this:]
"Goodwife Tyler did say, that when she was first apprehended, she had
no fears upon her, and did think that nothing could have made her
confesse against herself; but since, she had found to her great grief,
that she had wronged the truth, and falsely accused herself: she
said, that when she was brought to Salem, her brother Bridges rode
with her, and that all along the way from Andover to Salem, her
brother kept telling her that she must needs be a witch, since the
afflicted accused her, and at her touch were raised out of their
fitts, and urging her to confess herself a witch; she as constantly
told him,that she was no witch, that she knew nothing of witchcraft, and begg'd
of him not to urge her to confesse; however when she came to Salem,
she was carried to a room, where her brother on one side and Mr. John
Emerson on the other side did tell her that she was certainly a witch,
and that she saw the devill before her eyes at that time (and
accordingly the said Emerson would attempt with his hand to beat him
away from her eyes) and they so urged her to confesse, that she wished
herself in any dungeon, rather than be so treated: Mr. Emerson told
her once and again, Well! I see you will not confesse! Well! I will
now leave you , and then you are undone, body and soul forever: Her
brother urged her to confesse, and told her that in so doing she could
not lye; to which she answered, Good brother, do not say so, for I
shall lye if I confesse, and then who shall answer unto God for my
lye? He still asserted it, and said that God would not suffer so many
good men to be in such an errour about it, and that she would
be hang'd, if she did not confesse, and continued
so long and so violently to urge and presse her to confesse, that she
thought verily her life would have gone from her, and became so
terrifyed in her mind, that she own'd at length almost any thing that
they propounded to her; but she had wronged her conscience in so
doing, she was guilty of a great sin in belying of herself, and
desired to mourn for it as long as she lived: This she said and a
great deal more of the like nature, and all of it with such affection,
sorrow, relenting, grief, and mourning as that it exceeds any pen for
to describe and expresse the same."</p><p>The "Mr. John Emerson"
of this episode was that clerical schoolmaster
whom we have already met in New Hampshire (see p. 37, note 3), but who
was now, a teacher at Charlestown. (Sibley, <hi rend="italic">Harvard
Graduates,</hi> II. 471-474.) If so personal an activity of President
Mather surprise, let it be remembered how widely the persecution was
now striking. His parishioner Lady Phips was among the accused, and
the Quaker John Whiting has a yet more startling suggestion:
commenting in 1702 on the account just printed in Cotton Mather's
<hi rend="italic">Magnalia</hi>, he mentions the "two Hundred more accused, some of
which of great Estates in Boston," and in the margin adds, "Query, Was
not the Governour's Wife, and C. M.'s Mother, some of them?"
(<hi rend="italic">Truth and Innocency Defended</hi>, p. 140.)</p><p>Yet not all
dared to retract. "More than one or two of those now in
Prison," writes Increase Mather (<hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi>,
Postscript), "have freely and credibly acknowledged their Communion
and Familiarity with the Spirits of Darkness; and have also declared
unto me the Time and Occasion, with the particular Circumstances of
their Hellish Obligations and Abominations."</p></note>

<note id="n307"><seg type="note-symbol">[307].</seg> <p>The book, with all its credulity, is in the main a vigorous and learned
argument against improper methods for detecting witches, and chiefly against
reliance on the testimony of the bewitched. Commended by the ministers,
fourteen of whom sign the preface &ldquo;to the Christian reader,&rdquo; it may
have done something to allay the panic. But, though it is dated by the author
&ldquo;October 3,&rdquo; the title-page date of 1693 suggests that, like his son's

mere transcription is concerned, will find them faithful.</p></note>

<note id="n317"><seg type="note-symbol">[317].</seg> <p>See pp. 225-227. Shattuck, testifying in 1692, placed in 1680 his child's

witch.</p></note>

<note id="n318"><seg type="note-symbol">[318].</seg> <p>See pp. 239-240.</p></note>

<note id="n319"><seg type="note-symbol">[319].</seg> <p>The offense charged, in the indictments printed by Calef, was that the
accused &ldquo;wickedly and feloniously hath used certain detestable arts, called
witchcrafts and sorceries, by which said wicked arts&rdquo; the said bewitched
&ldquo;was and is tortured, afflicted, pined, consumed, wasted and tormented
against the peace of our sovereign lord and lady, the King and Queen, and against
the form of the statute in that case made and provided.&rdquo; This was the
usual form; but four of the indictments extant (against Rebecca Eames, Samuel
Wardwell, Rebecca Jacobs, <hi rend="italic">Records of Salem
Witchcraft</hi>, II. 24, 143, 147-148, and William Barker's, preserved by
Chandler, <hi rend="italic">American Criminal Trials</hi>, I. 429) charge
instead that the accused &ldquo;wickedly and feloniously a covenant with the Evil
Spirit the Devil did make,&rdquo; and in two of these &ldquo;the statute of King
James the First&rdquo; is expressly named as contravened. That statute, indeed,
punished alike with death those who should &ldquo;consult, covenant with,
entertain, employ, feed, or reward any evil or wicked spirit,&rdquo; and the laws
of Massachusetts made it death &ldquo;if any man or woman be a witch (that is,
hath or consulteth with a familiar spirit)&rdquo; &mdash; without a mention of
harm to man or beast as element of the crime. That the indictments specify such
harm was perhaps only because the public attorney &mdash; Thomas Newton
(succeeded on July 26 by Anthony Checkley) &mdash; was fresh from English
practice; but, as Calef implies, the proof should meet the indictment. Newton
(1660-1721) had come to Boston in 1688. Mr. Goodell, who studied the originals,
says the quoted indictments mentioning the English statute &ldquo;appear to have
been drawn in blank by him, and afterwards filled in by Checkley&rdquo; (<hi
rend="italic">Further Notes</hi>, p. 37). As to Newton see the study of
Moore (<hi rend="italic">Final Notes</hi>, pp. 94-103). Edward Randolph
says of him (V. 143) that he was &ldquo;a person well known in the practice in
the Courts in England and New England,&rdquo; while Checkley he calls
&ldquo;a man ignorant in the Laws of England.&rdquo; In 1691 Newton had
been attorney general at New York.</p></note>

<note id="n320"><seg type="note-symbol">[320].</seg> <p>The laws of the colony had never ceased to be operative; and the first act
passed (June 15, 1692) by the General Court under the new charter was for the
continuance of these laws, &ldquo;being not repugnant to the laws of England nor
inconsistent with the present constitution,&rdquo; in full force till November 10.
On October 29 the Court passed a general &ldquo;act for the punishing of capital
offenders,&rdquo; in which the old Massachusetts law as to
witchcraft &mdash; &ldquo;If any man or woman be a witch, that is, hath or
consulteth with a familiar spirit, they shall be put to death&rdquo; &mdash; retains
its old place and wording. And on December 14, &ldquo;for more particular
direction in the execution of the law against witchcraft,&rdquo; the same General
Court enacted the long English statute of 1604 (1 James I., cap. 12) &mdash;
omitting only the penalty of loss of &ldquo;the privilege and benefit of clergy and
sanctuary&rdquo; and the clauses saving dower and inheritance to widow and heir
of the convicted and providing that peers shall be tried by peers, substituting as
the place of pillorying &ldquo;some shire town&rdquo; for &ldquo;some market
town upon the market day or at such time as any fair shall be kept there,&rdquo;
and adding to the penalty (for the lighter degrees of sorcery) of imprisonment,
pillory, and public confession of the offence, the clause: &ldquo;which said
offense shall be written in capital letters, and placed upon the breast of said
offender.&rdquo; The commission creating the Court of Oyer and Terminer (May
27, 1692) antedated, however, all these laws, and instructed that body &ldquo;to
enquire of, hear and determine for this time, according to the law and custom of
England and of this their Majesties' province, all and all manner of
crimes.&rdquo; (For a learned study of witchcraft laws in England and New
England see Moore's <hi rend="italic">Notes on Witchcraft</hi>, pp.

in England and his procuring of the new charter, &ldquo;are the things
principally driven at in the book,&rdquo; and &ldquo;another principal thing is
to set forth the supposed witchcrafts in New-England, and how well Mr. Mather
the Younger therein acquitted himself.&rdquo; Wherefore, after freeing his mind
as to the matter of the charter, he takes up Mather's allegations as to the Salem
episode, and, pointing out that, &ldquo;tho this Book pretends to raise a Statue
in Honour of Sir William, yet it appears it was the least part of the design of the
Author to Honour him, but rather to Honour himself, and the Ministers,&rdquo;
since by so printing the advice of the ministers (see above, p. 356) &ldquo;as to
give a full Account of the cautions given him, but designedly hiding from the
Reader the Incouragements and Exhortations to proceed,&rdquo; it really throws
the blame upon Phips, he devotes the remaining pages, here reprinted, to Cotton
Mather's real views and their influence. The <hi rend="italic">Life of

<head>A MODEST INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF
WITCHCRAFT, BY JOHN HALE, 1702</head>



<pb n="397"/>


<div2 type="introduction" id="d108">
<head>INTRODUCTION</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Rev. John Hale (1636-1700), a native
of the colony and a graduate of Harvard in its class of 1657, had since 1665 been
pastor at Beverly, the parish lying north of Salem, from which it was severed by
a narrow arm of the sea, and at the west adjoining yet more closely Salem
Village, through which lay the land route connecting Beverly with Salem and with
Boston. Many of those connected with the beginnings of the witch panic had,
prior to the erection of the Village parish, been in attendance at the Beverly
church. Some were still so; and the spreading suspicion soon invaded this parish
itself. It was not strange, then, that from the first, as we have seen already,
Hale's interest in the proceedings was close and attentive.<ref target="n350">[350]</ref> There can be no
question that, as Calef says, &ldquo;he had been very forward in these
Prosecutions,&rdquo; and, like his neighbor pastors Parris and Noyes, had held
the most credulous views as to the worth of the testimony of the
&ldquo;afflicted.&rdquo; How those views changed after the accusation of his
loved and honored wife we have also seen;<ref target="n351">[351]</ref> and of all this he himself tells us
with a touching sincerity in the pages now to follow. His little book is no
apology, but a manly attempt to make amends for what he now felt to be error
by setting forth to others what he had learned. Judge Sewall, who likewise had
repented of his error and likewise frankly owned it, records in

<pb n="398"/>

his diary on November 19, 1697, when he was on a visit to Salem: &ldquo;Mr.
Hale and I lodg'd together: He discours'd me about writing a History of the
Witchcraft; I fear lest he go into the other extream.&rdquo;</p>


<p>The Rev. John Higginson (1616-1708), the aged senior pastor of Salem,
who writes for Hale the introduction, is also no stranger to us;<ref target="n352">[352]</ref> and we have seen
what reason there is to think him hesitant all along as to the proceedings. Yet
how far he had been from incredulity as to human dealings with the Devil appears
not only from his own words here, but from the materials he furnished Increase
Mather for his <hi rend="italic">Providences</hi>.<ref target="n353">[353]</ref> Perhaps he, too,
consulted Judge Sewall as to his part in the little book; for before the words just
cited the latter writes: &ldquo;Mr. Higginson comes as far as Brother's to see
me; which I wonder'd at.&rdquo;</p>


<p>Though completed early in 1698 &mdash; since Higginson had read it before
signing his introduction on March 23 &mdash; the book, as may be seen from its
imprint, was not published till 1702, after Hale's death. Perhaps that was its
author's wish: so, Judge Sewall tells us,<ref target="n354">[354]</ref> Higginson withheld his treatise on
periwigs. The <hi rend="italic">Modest Enquiry</hi> is now one of the
rarest books in the literature of witchcraft. Its single reimpression (Boston, 1771)
is said to be yet rarer than the original. Happily, that part of the book which
narrates the story of the Salem episode was taken up by Cotton Mather into his
<hi rend="italic">Magnalia</hi> (at the end of his Book VI.); and from that
work, though it gives Hale due credit, it is often quoted as if Mather's
own.<ref target="n355">[355]</ref></p>

<head>An Epistle to the Reader.</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">It</hi> hath been said of Old, That Time is the
Mother of Truth, and Truth is the Daughter of Time. It is the Prerogative of the
God of Truth, to know all the truth in all things at once and together: It is also
his Glory to conceal a matter, Prov. 25. 2, And to bring the truth to light in that
manner and measure, and the times appointed, as it pleaseth him; it is

<pb n="400"/>

our duty in all humility, and with fear and trembling, to search after truth,
knowing that secret things belong to God, and only things revealed belong to us,
and so far as they are revealed; for in many things it may be said, what God is
doing we know not now; but we, or others that succeed us, shall know hereafter.
Omitting other Examples, I shall Instance only in the matter of Witchcraft, which
on the Humane side, is one of the most hidden Works of Darkness, managed by
the Rulers of the darkness of this World, to the doing of great spoil amongst the
Children of men: And on the Divine side, it is one of the most awful and
tremendous Judgments of God which can be inflicted on the Societies of men,
especially when the Lord shall please for his own Holy Ends to Enlarge Satans
Commission in more than an ordinary way.</p>


<p>It is known to all men, that it pleased God some few years ago, to suffer
Satan to raise much trouble amongst us in that respect, the beginning of which
was very small, and looked on at first as an ordinary case which had fallen out
before at several times in other places, and would be quickly over. Only one or
two persons belonging to Salem Village about five miles from the Town being
suspected were Examined, etc. But in the progress of the matter, a multitude of
other persons both in this and other Neighbour Towns, were Accused, Examined,
Imprisoned, and came to their Trials, at Salem, the County Town, where about
Twenty of them Suffered as Witches; and many others in danger of the same
Tragical End: and still the number of the Accused increased unto many Scores;
amongst whom were many Persons of unquestionable Credit, never under any
grounds of suspicion of that or any other Scandalous Evil. This brought a general
Consternation upon all sorts of People, doubting what would be the issue of such
a dreadful Judgment of God upon the Country; but the Lord was pleased suddenly
to put a stop to those proceedings, that there was no further trouble, as hath been
related by others. But it left in the minds of men a sad remembrance of that
sorrowful time; and a Doubt whether some Innocent Persons might not Suffer,
and some guilty Persons Escape. There is no doubt but the Judges and Juries
proceeded in their Integrity, with a zeal of God against Sin, according to their
best light, and according to Law and Evidence; but there is

<pb n="401"/>




a Question yet unresolved, Whether some of the Laws, Customs and Principles
used by the Judges and Juries in the Trials of Witches in England (which were
followed as Patterns here) were not insufficient and unsafe.</p>


<p>As for my Self, being under the Infirmities of a decrepit Old Age, I stirred
little abroad, and was much disenabled (both in body and mind) from Knowing
and judging of Occurrents and Transactions of that time: But my Reverend
Brother Mr. Hale, having for above Thirty Years been Pastor of the Church at
Beverly (but Two Miles from Salem, where the Tryals were) was frequently
present, and was a diligent Observer of all that passed, and being one of a
Singular Prudence and Sagacity, in searching into the narrows of things: He hath
(after much deliberation) in this Treatise, related the Substance of the Case as it
was, and given Reasons from Scripture against some of the Principles and
Practises then used in the Tryals of Witchcraft; and said something also in a
Positive way, and shewing the right Application that is to be made of the whole,
and all this in such a pious and modest Manner, as cannot be offensive to any,
but may be generally acceptable to all the lovers of Truth and Peace.</p>


<p>I am the more willing to accompany him to the Press, because I am
perswaded such a Treatise as this is needful and useful, upon divers accounts.
As,</p>


<p>1. That the Works of God may be known; and that God may be more
acknowledged and adored, in his Justice, and in his Mercy: in his Justice, by
letting loose Evil Angels, to make so great a spoyl amongst us as they did, for
the Punishment of a declining People: And in his Mercy, by Counter-manding of
Satans Commission, and keeping of him in Chains of restraint, that he should
proceed no further. Psal. 83, last.</p>


<p>2. That the Truth of things may be more fully known, so far as God shall
please to reveal the same in the use of lawful means; for the Judgments of God
are a great deep, and he is wont to make known truth by degrees; and Experience
teacheth us, there is need of more to be said than hath been yet, for the clearing
up of difficulties about the matter of Witchcraft. We ought to be fellow helpers
to the truth. 3 Epistle of John, 8. v.</p>


<p>3. That whatever Errors or Mistakes we fell into, in the

<pb n="402"/>




dark hour of Temptation that was upon us, may be (upon more light) so
discovered, acknowledged and disowned by us, as that it may be a matter of
Warning and Caution to those that come after us, that they may not fall into the
like. 1 Cor. 10. 11. <hi rend="italic">F&aelig;lix quem faciunt aliena
pericula cautum</hi>.<ref target="n359">[359]</ref></p>


<p>4. And that it may Occasion the most Learned and Pious men to make a
further and fuller Enquiry into the matter of Witchcraft, especially into the
positive part, How Witches may be so discovered, that innocent persons may be
preserved, and none but the guilty may suffer. Prov. 17. 15.</p>


<p>Verily whosoever shall by the Grace of God be enabled to Contribute
further light in this matter, will do good Service to God and Men in his
Generation.</p>


<p>I would also propound and leave it as an Object of Consideration to our
Honoured Magistrates and Reverend Ministers, Whether the &aelig;quity of that
Law in Leviticus, Chap. 4, for a Sin offering for the Rulers and for the
Congregation, in the case of Sins of Ignorance, when they come to be known, be
not Obliging, and for direction to us in a Gospel way.</p>


<p>Now the Father of Lights and Mercies grant unto us, that Mercy and Truth
may meet together, that righteousness and peace may kiss each other, that the
Glory of God may dwell in our Land; and that it may be said of New England,
The Lord Bless thee, O Habitation of Justice and Mountain of Holiness,</p>


<p>Finally, That the Blessing of Heaven may go along with this little Treatise
to attain the good Ends thereof, is, and shall be the Prayer of him who is daily
waiting for his Change, and looking for the Mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ unto
Eternal Life.</p>

<head>The Preface to the Christian Reader.</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">The</hi> Holy Scriptures inform us that the
Doctrine of Godliness is a great Mystery, containing the Mysteries of the

<pb n="403"/>

Kingdom of Heaven: Mysteries which require great search for the finding out:
And as the Lord hath his Mysteries to bring us to Eternal Glory; so Satan hath
his Mysteries to bring us to Eternal Ruine: Mysteries not easily understood,
whereby the depths of Satan are managed in hidden wayes. So the Whore of
Babylon makes the Inhabitants of the Earth drunk with the Wine of her
Fornication, by the Mystery of her abominations, Rev. 17. 2. And the man of Sin
hath his Mystery of iniquity whereby he deceiveth men through the working of
Satan in signes and lying wonders, 2 Thes. 2. 3, 7, 9.</p>


<p>And among Satans Mysteries of iniquity, this of Witchcraft is one of the
most difficult to be searched out by the Sons of men; as appeareth by the great
endeavours of Learned and Holy men to search it out, and the great differences
that are found among them, in the rules laid down for the bringing to light these
hidden works of darkness. So that it may seem presumption in me to undertake
so difficult a Theam, and to lay down such rules as are different from the
Sentiments of many Eminent writers, and from the Presidents and practices of
able Lawyers; yea and from the Common Law it self.</p>


<p>But my Apology for this undertaking is;</p>


<p>1. That there hath been such a dark dispensation by the Lord, letting loose
upon us the Devil, <hi rend="italic">Anno.</hi> 1691 and 1692,<ref target="n361">[361]</ref> as we
never experienced before: And thereupon apprehending and condemning persons
for Witchcraft; and nextly acquitting others no less liable to such a charge; which
evidently shew we were in the dark, and knew not what to do; but have gone too
far on the one or other side, if not on both. Hereupon I esteemed it necessary for
some person to Collect a Summary of that affair, with some animadversions upon
it, which might at least give some light to them which come after, to shun those
Rocks by which we were bruised, and narrowly escaped Shipwrack upon. And
I have waited five years for some other person to undertake it, who might doe it
better than I can, but find none; and judge it better to do what I can, than that
such a work should be left undone. Better sincerely though weakly done, then not
at all, or with such a byas of prejudice as will put false glosses upon that which
was managed

<pb n="404"/>

with uprightness of heart, though there was not so great a spirit of
discerning, as were to be wished in so weighty a Concernment.</p>


<p>2. I have been present at several Examinations and Tryals, and knew
sundry of those that Suffered upon that account in former years, and in this last
affair, and so have more advantages than a stranger, to give account of these
Proceedings.</p>


<p>3. I have been from my Youth trained up in the knowledge and belief of
most of those principles I here question as unsafe to be used. The first person that
suffered on this account in New-England, about Fifty years since, was my
Neighbour, and I heard much of what was charged upon her, and others in those
times; and the reverence I bore to aged, learned and judicious persons, caused me
to drink in their principles in these things, with a kind of Implicit Faith. <hi
rend="italic">Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit odorem, Testa
diu</hi>.<ref target="n362">[362]</ref> A Child will not easily forsake the principles he hath been trained
up in from his Cradle.</p>


<p>But observing the Events of that sad Catastrophe, <hi rend="italic">Anno
</hi> 1692, I was brought to a more strict scanning of the principles I had
imbibed, and by scanning, to question, and by questioning at length to reject
many of them, upon the reasons shewed in the ensuing Discourse. It is an
approved saying <hi rend="italic">Nihil certius, quam quod ex dubio fit
certum</hi>;<ref target="n363">[363]</ref> No truth more certain to a man, than that which he hath
formerly doubted or denied, and is recovered from his error, by the convincing
evidence of Scripture and reason. Yet I know and am sensible, that while we
know but in part, man is apt in flying from a discovered error, to run into the
contrary extream.</p>

<p rend="center"><hi rend="italic">Incidit in Scyllam qui vult vitare
Charybdim</hi>.<ref target="n364">[364]</ref></p>


<p>The middle way is commonly the way of truth. And if any can shew me a
better middle way than I have here laid down, I shall be ready to embrace it: But
the conviction must not be by vinegar or drollery, but by strength of
argument.</p>


<p>4. I have had a deep sence of the sad consequence of mis

<pb n="405"/>


takes in matters Capital; and their impossibility of recovering when compleated.
And what grief of heart it brings to a tender conscience, to have been unwittingly
encouraging of the Sufferings of the innocent. And I hope a zeal to prevent for
the future such sufferings is pardonable, although there should be much weakness,
and some errors in the pursuit thereof.</p>


<p>5. I observe the failings that have been on the one hand, have driven some
into that which is indeed an extream on the other hand, and of dangerous
consequences, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> To deny any such persons to be
under the New Testament, who by the Devils aid discover Secrets, or do work
wonders. Therefore in the latter part of this discourse, I have taken pains to prove
the Affirmative, yet with brevity, because it hath been done already by Perkins
of <hi rend="italic">Witchcraft</hi>.<ref target="n365">[365]</ref> Glanvil his
<hi rend="italic">Saducismus Triumphatus</hi>,<ref target="n366">[366]</ref> Pt. 1. p. 1 to 90 and Pt. 2.
p. 1 to 80. Yet I would not be understood to justify all his notions in those
discourses, but acknowledge he hath strongly proved the being of Witches.</p>


<p>6. I have special reasons moving me to bear my testimony about these
matters, before I go hence and be no more; the which I have here done, and I
hope with some assistance of his Spirit, to whom I commit my self and this my
labour, even that God whose I am and whom I serve: Desiring his Mercy in Jesus
Christ to Pardon all the Errors of his People in the day of darkness; and to enable
us to fight with Satan by Spiritual Weapons, putting on the whole Armour of
God.</p>


<p>And tho' Satan by his Messengers may buffet Gods Children, yet there's
a promise upon right <hi rend="italic">Resisting, he shall flee from
them</hi>, Jam. 4. 7. <hi rend="italic">And that all things shall work
together for the good of those that Love the Lord</hi>, Rom. 8. 28. So that I
believe Gods Children shall be gainers by the assaults of Satan, which occasion'd
this Discourse; which that they may, is the Prayer of, Thine in the Service of the
Gospel.</p>

<head>A MODEST ENQUIRY, INTO THE NATURE OF WITCHCRAFT Chapter I.</head>

<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 1. The Angels who kept not their First
Estate, by Sin against God, lost their primitive purity, and glorious Excellency,
as to their moral qualifications, and became unclean, wicked, envious, lyars, and
full of all wickedness, which as Spirits they are capable of. Yet I do not find in
Scripture that they lost their natural abilities of understanding or power of
Operation.</p>


<p>1. As for their Understanding, they are called <hi rend="italic">Daimon
</hi> (which we Translate Devil) because they are full of wisdom, cunning,
skill, subtilty and knowledge. He hath also the name of Serpent from his subtilty,
2 Cor. 11. 3. And his knowledge in the Scriptures, and wittiness to pervert them,
appears by his quoting Scripture to our Saviour when he tempted him. Mat.
4.</p>


<p>And as there be many Devils, and these active, quick, swift and piercing
Spirits, so they going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it, have
advantages to know all the actions of the Children of men, both open and secret,
their discourses, consultations, and much of the inward affections of men thereby;
though still its Gods prerogative immediately to know the heart. Jer. 17.
10.</p>


<p>2. As to their natural power as Spirits, its very great, if not equal to that
of the Holy Angels: For,</p>


<p>1. They are called <hi rend="italic">Principalities and Powers</hi>.
Rom. 8. 38. Eph. 6. 12. Col. 2. 14, 15, compared with Heb. 2. 14, 15. Now
these are names given to the Holy Angels. Eph. 1. 21, and 3. 10.</p>


<p>2. They are called, <hi rend="italic">Rulers of the darkness of this
world, the Prince of the power of the Air</hi>. Eph. 6. 12 and 2. 2.</p>


<p>3. Such was their power that they contended with Michael and the Angels
about the Body of Moses. 2 Pet. 2. 11. Jude 9. That is, as I conceive, about
preventing the Burial of the Body of Moses: For it's said, Deut. 34. 6, The Lord
buried him, and no man knoweth of his Sepulcher to this day.

<pb n="407"/>

That is, he did it by the Ministry of Angels (for the Lord gave the Law, Exod.
20. 1, and that it was by the Ministry of Angels, see Gal. 3. 19. so probably was
the burial of Moses's Body) and the Devils endeavour if possible, to discover
Moses's Body, or place of its burial, that they might draw Israel to commit
Idolatry in worshipping at his Tomb (as our Popish Fore-fathers did at Thomas
Beckets in Kent) from the Veneration they had to him as their Law giver.</p>


<p>4. The Devils actings against Job, Chap. 1 and 2, and what he did to the
Gadarene Swine, etc., Shew his great power. So that we may conclude, had the
Devils liberty to reveal all that they know of the affairs of mankind, or to do all
that is in their power to perform, they would bring dreadful confusions and
desolations upon the World.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 2. The way God governs Devils is by
Chains. 2 Pet. 2. 4. Jude 6 ver. Rev. 20. 1, 2, 7, 8, whereby they are kept
Prisoners. Men are governed by Laws, by convictions of Conscience. Rom. 2.
12, 13, 14, 15. By Scripture Rules, Humane Laws, and also by Gods Spirit. 1
John 2. 20. But Devils have no such Laws, or tenderness of Conscience to bridle
or restrain them. But the Lord hath his Chains, which are called Everlasting, and
are always lasting; so that they are never wholly without a Chain. This Chain is
sometimes greater and shorter, other times lesser and longer, as the Lord
pleaseth, for his own Glory, Rev. 20. 1, 2, 7, 8. For as the <hi
rend="italic">wrath of man praiseth the Lord, and the remainder of wrath he
doth restrain</hi>, Psal. 76. 10, So may we say of the Devils wrath.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 3. The Devil is full of malice against
man, and frames his designs against him, chiefly to destroy his Soul, as, 1 Pet.
5. 8, 2 Cor. 11. 3, and other Scriptures abundantly testify. Hence probably at
sometimes he doth not all the hurt to mans Body that he could, lest thereby he
should awaken man to repentance and prayer; he seeks to keep men in a false
peace. Luk. 11. 21. Yet at other times he disturbs and afflicts men in Body and
Estate; as Scripture and experience shew. Among the Devices Satan useth to ruine
man, one is to allure him into such a familiarity with him, that by Sorceries,
Inchantments, Divinations, and such like, he may lead them Captive at his
pleasure. This snare of his we are warned against, Deut. 18. 10, 11, and in other
Scriptures. This Sin

<pb n="408"/>

of men hearkening after Satan in these ways, is called Witchcraft; of which it is
my purpose to treat: But first I shall speak something Historically what hath been
done in New England, in prosecution of persons suspected of this Crime.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 4. Several persons have been Charged
with and suffered for the Crime of Witchcraft in the Governments of the
Massachusetts, New Haven, or Stratford<ref target="n367">[367]</ref> and Connecticut, from the year 1646
to the year 1692.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 5. The first was a Woman of
Charlestown, <hi rend="italic">Anno
</hi> 1647 or 48.<ref target="n368">[368]</ref> She was suspected partly because that after some angry
words passing between her and her Neighbours, some mischief befel such
Neighbours in their Creatures, or the like: partly because some things supposed
to be bewitched, or have a Charm upon them, being burned, she came to the fire
and seemed concerned.</p>


<p>The day of her Execution, I went in company of some
Neighbours,<ref target="n369">[369]</ref> who
took great pains to bring her to confession and repentance. But she constantly
professed her self innocent of that crime: Then one prayed her to consider if God
did not bring this punishment upon her for some other crime, and asked, if she
had not been guilty of Stealing many years ago; she answered, she had stolen
something, but it was long since, and she had repented of it, and there was Grace
enough in Christ to pardon that long agoe; but as for Witchcraft she was wholly
free from it, and so she said unto her Death.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 6. Another that suffered on that account
some time after, was a Dorchester Woman.<ref target="n370">[370]</ref> And upon the day of her

<pb n="409"/>

Execution Mr. Thompson Minister at Brantry,<ref target="n371">[371]</ref> and J. P.<ref target="n372">[372]</ref> her former Master
took pains with her to bring her to repentance, And she utterly denyed her guilt
of Witchcraft: yet justifyed God for bringing her to that punishment: for she had
when a single woman played the harlot, and being with Child used means to
destroy the fruit of her body to conceal her sin and shame, and although she did
not effect it, yet she was a Murderer in the sight of God for her endeavours, and
shewed great penitency for that sin; but owned nothing of the crime laid to her
charge.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect.</hi> 7. Another suffering in this kind was a
Woman of Cambridge, against whom a principal evidence was a Water-town
Nurse, who testifyed, that the said Kendal (so was the accused called) did bewitch
to Death a Child of Goodman Genings of Watertown; for the said Kendal did
make much of the Child, and then the Child was well, but quickly changed its
colour and dyed in a few hours after. The Court took this evidence among others,
the said Genings not knowing of it. But after Kendal was Executed (who also
denyed her guilt to the Death,) Mr. Rich. Brown knowing and hoping better
things of Kendal, asked said Genings if they suspected her to bewitch their Child,
they answered No. But they judged the true cause of the Childs Death to be thus,
<hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> The Nurse had the night before carryed out the
Child and kept it abroad in the Cold a long time, when the red gum was come out
upon it, and the Cold had struck in the red gum, and this they judged the cause
of the Childs death. And that said Kendal did come in that day and make much
of the Child, but they apprehended no wrong to come to the Child by her. After
this the said Nurse was put into Prison for Adultery, and there delivered of her
base Child, and Mr. Brown went to her and told her, It was just with God to
leave her to this wickedness

<pb n="410"/>

as a Punishment for her Murdering goody Kendal by her false witness bearing.
But the Nurse dyed in Prison, and so the matter was not farther inquired
into.</p>


<p>There was another Executed, of Boston <hi rend="italic">Anno</hi>
1656. for that crime.<ref target="n373">[373]</ref> And two or three of Springfield, one of which confessed;
and said the occasion of her familiarity with Satan was this: She had lost a Child
and was exceedingly discontented at it and longed; Oh that she might see her
Child again! And at last the Devil in likeness of her Child came to her bed side
and talked with her, and asked to come into the bed to her, and she received it
into the bed to her that night and several nights after, and so entred into covenant
with Satan and became a Witch.<ref target="n374">[374]</ref> This was the only confessor in these times in
that Government.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 8. Another at Hartford, <hi
rend="italic">viz</hi>. Mary Johnson, men-tioned in <hi
rend="italic">Remarkable Providences</hi>, p. 62, 63,<ref target="n375">[375]</ref> Confessed her self
a Witch. Who upon discontent and slouthfulness agreed with the Devil to do her
work for her, and fetch up the Swine. And upon her immoderate laughter at the
running of the Swine, as the Devil drove them, as she her self said, was suspected and upon examination confessed. I have also heard of a Girl at New Haven
or Stratford, that confessed her guilt.<ref target="n376">[376]</ref> But all others denyed it unto the death
unless one Greensmith, at Hartford.<ref target="n377">[377]</ref></p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 9. But it is not my purpose to give a full
relation of all that have suffered for that Sin, or of all the particulars

<pb n="411"/>

charged upon them, which probably is now impossible, many witnessing <hi
rend="italic">Viva voce</hi>, those particulars which were not fully
recorded. But that I chiefly intend is to shew the principles formerly acted upon
in Convicting of that Crime; which were such as these.</p>


<p>1. The first great principle laid down by a person Eminent for Wisdom,
Piety and Learning<ref target="n378">[378]</ref> was; That the Devil could not assume the shape of an
innocent person in doing mischief unto mankind: for if the Lord should suffer
him in this he would subvert the course of humane Justice, by bringing men to
suffer for what he did in their Shapes.</p>


<p>2. Witchcraft being an habitual Crime, one single witness to one Act of
Witchcraft, and another single witness to another such fact, made two witnesses
against the Crime and the party suspected.</p>


<p>3. There was searching of the bodies of the suspected for such like teats,
or spots (which writers speak of) called the Devils marks; and if found, these
were accounted a presump-tion at least of guilt in those that had them.</p>


<p>4. I observed that people laid great weight upon this; when things supposed
to be bewitched were burnt, and the suspected person came to the fire in the time
of it.<ref target="n379">[379]</ref> Although that Eminent person
above said<ref target="n380">[380]</ref> condemned this way of tryal,
as going to the Devil to find the Devil.</p>


<p>5. If after anger between Neighbours mischief followed, this oft bred
suspicion of Witchcraft in the matter. In fine, the presumptions and convictions
used in former times were for substance the same which we may read of in
Keeble of the

<pb n="412"/>

Common Law,<ref target="n381">[381]</ref> and in Bernard,<ref target="n382">[382]</ref> and other Authors of that subject.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 10. About 16 or 17 years since was
accused a Woman of Newbury,<ref target="n383">[383]</ref> and upon her tryal the Jury brought her in
Guilty. Yet the Governour Simon Bradstreet Esq. and some of the Magistrates
repreived her, being unsatisfyed in the Verdict upon these grounds.</p>


<p>1. They were not satisfyed that a Specter doing mischief in her likeness,
should be imputed to her person, as a ground of guilt.</p>


<p>2. They did not esteem one single witness to one fact, and another single
witness to another fact, for two witnesses, against the person in a matter Capital.
She being reprived, was carried to her own home, and her Husband (who was
esteemed a Sincere and understanding Christian by those that knew him) desired
some Neighbour Ministers, of whom I was one, to meet together and discourse
his Wife; the which we did: and her discourse was very Christian among us, and
still pleaded her innocence as to that which was laid to her charge. We did not
esteem it prudence for us to pass any definitive Sentance upon one under her
circumstances, yet we inclined to the more charitable side.</p>


<p>In her last Sickness she was in much darkness and trouble of Spirit, which
occasioned a Judicious friend to examine her strictly, Whether she had been guilty
of Witchcraft, but she said No: But the ground of her trouble was some impatient
and passionate Speeches and Actions of hers while in Prison, upon the account
of her suffering wrongfully; whereby she had provoked the Lord, by putting some
contempt upon his word. And in fine, she sought her pardon and comfort from
God in Christ, and dyed so far as I understood, praying to and resting upon God
in Christ for Salvation.</p>


<p><hi rend="italic">Sect</hi>. 11. The next that Suffered was an Irish
Woman of Boston,<ref target="n384">[384]</ref> suspected to bewitch John Goodwins Children, who upon her
Tryal did in Irish (as was testified by the Interpreters) confess her self guilty, and
was condemned out of her own

<div2 type="subsection" id="d120">
<head>Chapter II.</head>

<p>I. In the latter end of the year 1691,<ref target="n386">[386]</ref> Mr. Samuel Paris, Pastor of the
Church in Salem-Village, had a Daughter of Nine, and a Neice of about Eleven
years of Age, sadly Afflicted of they knew not what Distempers; and he made his
application to Physitians, yet still they grew worse: And at length one Physitian
gave his opinion, that they were under an Evil Hand. This the Neighbours quickly
took up, and concluded they were bewitched. He had also an Indian Man servant,
and his Wife who afterwards confessed, that without the knowledge of their
Master or Mistress, they had taken some of the Afflicted persons Urine, and
mixing it with meal had made a Cake, and baked it, to find out the Witch, as they
said. After this, the Afflicted persons cryed out of the Indian Woman, named
Tituba, that she did pinch, prick, and griev-ously torment them, and that they
saw her here and there, where no body else could. Yea they could tell where she
was, and what she did, when out of their humane sight. These Children were
bitten and pinched by invisible agents; their arms, necks, and backs turned this
way and that way, and returned back again, so as it was impossible for them to
do of themselves, and beyond the power of any Epileptick Fits, or natural Disease
to effect. Sometimes they were taken dumb, their mouths stopped, their throats
choaked, their limbs wracked and tormented so as might move an heart of stone,
to sympathize with them, with bowels of compassion for them. I will not enlarge
in the description of their cruel Sufferings, because they were in all things
afflicted as bad as John Good-wins Children at Boston, in the year 1689. So that
he that

<pb n="414"/>

will read Mr. Mathers Book of <hi rend="italic">Memorable
Providences</hi>, page 3, etc., may Read part of what these Children, and
afterwards sundry grown persons suffered by the hand of Satan, at Salem Village,
and parts adjacent, <hi rend="italic">Anno</hi> 1691, 2. Yet there was
more in these Sufferings, than in those at Boston, by pins in-visibly stuck into
their flesh, pricking with Irons, (As in part published in a Book Printed 1693,
<hi rend="italic">viz. The Wanders of the Invisible World</hi>).<ref target="n387">[387]</ref> Mr.
Paris seeing the distressed condition of his Family, desired the presence of some
Worthy Gentle-men of Salem, and some Neighbour Ministers to consult to-gether at his House; who when they came, and had enquired diligently into the
Sufferings of the Afflicted, concluded they were preternatural, and feared the
hand of Satan was in them.</p>


<p>II. The advice given to Mr. Paris by them was, that he should sit still and
wait upon the Providence of God to see what time might discover; and to be
much in prayer for the discovery of what was yet secret. They also Examined
Tituba, who confessed the making a Cake, as is above mentioned, and said her
Mistress in her own Country was a Witch, and had taught her some means to be
used for the discovery of a Witch and for the prevention of being bewitched, etc.
But said that she her self was not a Witch.</p>


<p>III. Soon after this, there were two or three private Fasts at the Ministers
House, one of which was kept by sundry Neighbour Ministers, and after this,
another in Publick at the Village, and several days afterwards of publick
Humiliation, during these molestations, not only there, but in other Con-gregations for them. And one General Fast by Order of the General Court,
observed throughout the Colony to seek the Lord that he would rebuke Satan, and
be a light unto his people in this day of darkness.<ref target="n388">[388]</ref></p>


<p>But I return to the History of these troubles. In a short time after other
persons who were of age to be witnesses, were molested by Satan, and in their
fits cryed out upon Tituba and Goody O. and S. G.<ref target="n389">[389]</ref> that they or Specters in their
Shapes did grievously torment them; hereupon some of their Village

<pb n="415"/>




Neighbours complained to the Magistrates at Salem, desiring they would come
and examine the afflicted and accused to-gether; the which they did: the effect
of which examination was, that Tituba confessed she was a Witch, and that she
with the two others accused did torment and bewitch the com-plainers, and that
these with two others whose names she knew not, had their Witch-meeting
together; relating the times when and places where they met, with many other cir-cumstances to be seen at large. Upon this the said Tituba and O. and S. G. were
committed to Prison upon suspicion of acting Witchcraft. After this the said
Tituba was again ex-amined in Prison, and owned her first confession in all
points, and then was her self afflicted and complained of her fellow Witches
tormenting of her, for her confession, and accusing them, and being searched by
a Woman, she was found to have upon her body the marks of the Devils
wounding of her.</p>


<p>IV. Here were these things rendred her confession credi-ble. (1.) That at
this examination she answered every ques-tion just as she did at the first. And
it was thought that if she had feigned her confession, she could not have
remembred her answers so exactly. A lyar we say, had need of a good memory,
but truth being always consistent with it self is the same to day as it was
yesterday. (2.) She seemed very peni-tent for her Sin in covenanting with the
Devil. (3.) She be-came a sufferer her self and as she said for her confession.
(4.) Her confession agreed exactly (which was afterwards veri-fied in the other
confessors) with the accusations of the afflicted. Soon after these afflicted persons
complained of other persons afflicting of them in their fits, and the number of the
afflicted and accused began to increase. And the success of Tituba's confession
encouraged those in Authority to examine others that were suspected, and the
event was, that more confessed themselves guilty of the Crimes they were
suspected for. And thus was this matter driven on.</p>


<p>V. I observed in the prosecution of these affairs, that there was in the
Justices, Judges and others concerned, a con-scientious endeavour to do the thing
that was right. And to that end they consulted the Presidents<ref target="n390">[390]</ref> of former times and
precepts laid down by Learned Writers about Witchcraft.

<p>VI. But that which chiefly carried on this matter to such an height, was the
increasing of confessors till they amounted to near about Fifty: and four or six
of them upon their tryals owned their guilt of this crime, and were condemned
for the same, but not Executed. And many of the confessors con-firmed their
confessions with very strong circumstances: As their exact agreement with the
accusations of the afflicted; their punctual agreement with their fellow confessors;
their relating the times when they covenanted with Satan, and the reasons that
moved them thereunto; their Witch meetings, and that they had their mock
Sacraments of Baptism and the Supper, in some of them; their signing the Devils
book: and some shewed the Scars of the wounds which they said were made to
fetch blood with, to sign the Devils book; and some

<pb n="417"/>




said they had Imps to suck them, and shewed Sores raw where they said they
were sucked by them.</p>


<p>VII. I shall give the Reader a tast of these things in a few Instances. The
Afflicted complained that the Spectres which vexed them, urged them to set their
Hands to a Book represented to them (as to them it seemed) with threatnings of
great torments, if they signed not, and promises of ease if they obeyed.</p>


<p>Among these D. H.<ref target="n396">[396]</ref> did as she said (which sundry others confessed
afterwards) being overcome by the extremity of her pains, sign the Book
presented, and had the promised ease; and immediately upon it a Spectre in her
Shape afflicted another person, and said, I have signed the Book and have ease,
now do you sign, and so shall you have ease. And one day this afflicted person
pointed at a certain place in the room, and said, there is D. H., upon which a
man with his Rapier struck at the place, though he saw no Shape; and the
Afflicted called out, saying, you have wounded her side, and soon after the
afflicted person pointed at another place, saying, there she is; whereupon a man
struck at the place, and the afflicted said, you have given her a small prick about
the eye. Soon after this, the said D. H. confessed her self to be made a Witch by
signing the Devils Book as above said; and declared that she had afflicted the
Maid that complained of her, and in doing of it had received two wounds by a
Sword or Rapier, a small one about the eye, which she shewed to the
Magistrates, and a bigger on the side of which she was searched by a discreet
woman, who reported, that D. H. had on her side the sign of a wound newly
healed.</p>


<p>This D. H. confessed that she was at a Witch Meeting at Salem Village,
where were many persons that she named, some of whom were in Prison then or
soon after upon suspicion of Witchcraft: And the said G. B.<ref target="n397">[397]</ref> preached to them,
and such a Woman was their Deacon, and there they had a Sacra-ment.</p>


<p>VIII. Several others after this confessed the same things

<pb n="418"/>




with D. H. In particular Goody F.<ref target="n398">[398]</ref> said
(<hi rend="italic">Inter alia</hi><ref target="n399">[399]</ref>)
that she with two others (one of whom acknowledged the same) Rode from
Andover to the same Village Witch meeting upon a stick above ground, and that
in the way the stick brake, and gave the said F. a fall: whereupon, said she, I got
a fall and hurt of which I am still sore. I happened to be present in Prison when
this F. owned again her former confession to the Magistrates. And then I moved
she might be further ques-tioned about some particulars: It was answered, the
Magis-trates had not time to stay longer; but I should have liberty to Examine
her farther by my self; The which thing I did; and I asked her if she rode to the
Meeting on a Stick; she said, yea. I enquired what she did for Victuals; she
answered that she carried Bread and Cheese in her pocket, and that she and the
Andover Company came to the Village before the Meeting began, and sat down
together under a tree and eat their food, and that she drank water out of a Brook
to quench her thirst. And that the Meeting was upon a plain grassy place, by
which was a Cart path, and sandy ground in the path, in which were the tracks
of Horses feet. And she also told me how long they were going and returning.
And some time after told me, she had some trouble upon her spirit, and when I
enquired what? she said, she was in fear that G. B. and M. C.<ref target="n400">[400]</ref> would kill her;
for they appeared unto her (in Spectre, for their persons were kept in other
Rooms in the Prison) and brought a sharp pointed iron like a spindle, but four
square, and threatned to stab her to death with it; because she had confessed her
Witchcraft, and told of them, that they were with her, and that M. C. above
named was the person that made her a Witch. About a month after the said F.
took occasion to tell me the same Story of her fears that G. B. and E.
C.<ref target="n401">[401]</ref> would
kill her, and that the thing was much upon her Spirits.</p>


<p>IX. It was not long before M. L.<ref target="n402">[402]</ref> Daughter of said F. confessed that she
rode with her Mother to the said Witch

<pb n="419"/>




Meeting, and confirmed the substance of her Mothers Confes-sion. At another
time, M. L. junior the Grand Daughter, aged about seventeen years, confesseth
the substance of what her Grand mother and Mother had related, and declareth,
that when they with E. C.<ref target="n403">[403]</ref> rode on a stick or pole in the Air, She the said
Grand-Daughter with R. C.<ref target="n404">[404]</ref> Rode upon another; (and she said R. C.
acknowledged the same) and that they sat their hands to the Devils Book. And
(<hi rend="italic">inter alia</hi>) said, &ldquo;O Mother, why did you
give me to the Devil?&rdquo; twice or thrice over. The Mother said, she was
sorry at the heart for it, it was through that wicked one. Her Daughter bid her
repent and call upon God. And said, &ldquo;Oh Mother, your wishes are now
come to pass! for how often have you wished that the Devil would fetch me away
alive?&rdquo; And then said, &ldquo;Oh! my heart will break within
me&rdquo;; Then she wept bitterly, crying out, &ldquo;O Lord comfort me, and
bring out all the Witches.&rdquo; And she said to her Grandmother, &ldquo;O
Grandmother, why did you give me to the Devil? Why did you perswade me, O
Grand-mother do not deny it.&rdquo; Then the Grandmother gave account of
several things about their confederates and acts of Witch-crafts too long to
rehearse.</p>

<head>Chapter III.</head>

<p>Nextly I will insert the Confession of a man about Forty years of Age, W.
B.,<ref target="n405">[405]</ref> which he wrote himself in Prison, and sent to the Magistrates, to confirm
his former Confession to them, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>.</p>


<p>God having called me to Confess my sin and Apostasy in that fall in giving
the Devil advantage over me appearing to me like a Black, in the evening to set
my hand to his Book, as I have owned to my shame. He told me that I should not
want so doing. At Salem Village, there being a little off the Meeting-House,
about an hundred five Blades,<ref target="n406">[406]</ref> some with Rapiers by their side, which was called
and might be more for ought I know by B and Bu.<ref target="n407">[407]</ref> and the

<pb n="420"/>




Trumpet sounded, and Bread and Wine which they called the Sacrament, but I
had none; being carried over all on a Stick, never being at any other Meeting. I
being at Cart a Saturday last, all the day, of Hay and English Corn, the Devil
brought my Shape to Salem, and did afflict M. S.<ref
target="n408">[408]</ref> and R. F.<ref target="n409">[409]</ref> by clitching my
Hand; and a Sabbath day my Shape afflicted A. M.<ref target="n410">[410]</ref> and at night afflicted M. S.
and A. M. E. I.<ref target="n411">[411]</ref> and A. F.<ref target="n412">[412]</ref> have been my Enticers to this great abomination,
as one have owned and charged her to her Sister with the same. And the design
was to Destroy Salem Village, and to begin at the Ministers House, and to
destroy the Church of God, and to set up Satans Kingdom, and then all will be
well. And now I hope God in some measure has made me something sensible of
my sin and apostasy, begging pardon of God, and of the Honourable Magistrates
and all Gods people, hoping and promising by the help of God, to set to my heart
and hand to do what in me lyeth to destroy such wicked worship, humbly begging
the prayers of all Gods People for me, I may walk humbly under this great
affliction and that I may procure to my self, the sure mercies of David, and the
blessing of Abraham.</p>


<p>Concerning this Confession. (1) Note it was his own free act in Prison. (2)
He saith the Devil like a Black. This he had before explained to be like a Black
man. (3) That on a certain day was heard in the Air the sound of a Trumpet at
Salem Village nigh the Meeting-House, and upon all enquiry it could not be found
that any mortal man did sound it. (4) The three persons he saith the Devil in his
Shape afflicted, had been as to the times and manner afflicted as he confesseth.
(5) That E. I. confessed as much as W. B. chargeth her with. (6) Many others
confessed a Witch Meeting, or Witch meetings at the Village as well as he.</p>


<p>Note also that these Confessors did not only witness against themselves, but
against one another; and against many if not all those that Suffered for that
Crime. As for example, when

<pb n="421"/>




G. B.<ref target="n413">[413]</ref> was Tryed, seven or eight of these Confessors severally called, said, they
knew the said B. and saw him at a Witch-Meeting at the Village, and heard him
exhort the Company to pull down the Kingdom of God, and set up the Kingdom
of the Devil. He denied all, yet said he justified the Judges and Jury in
Condemning of him; because there were so many positive witnesses against him:
But said he dyed by false Witnesses. I seriously spake to one that witnessed (of
his Exhorting at the Witch Meeting at the Village) saying to her; You are one that
bring this man to Death, if you have charged any thing upon him that is not true,
recal it before it be too late, while he is alive. She answered me, she had nothing
to charge her self with, upon that account.</p>


<p>M. C.<ref target="n414">[414]</ref> had to witness against her, two or three of her own Children, and
several of her Neighbours that said they were in confederacy with her in their
Witchcraft.</p>


<p>A. F.<ref target="n415">[415]</ref> Had three of her Children, and some of the Neighbours, her own
Sister, and a Servant, who confessed themselves Witches, and said, she was in
confederacy with them: But alas, I am weary with relating particulars; those that
would see more of this kind, let them have recourse to the Records.</p>


<p>By these things you see how this matter was carried on, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> chiefly by the complaints and accusations of the
Afflicted, Bewitched ones, as it was supposed, and then by the Confessions of the
Accused, condemning themselves, and others. Yet experience shewed that the
more there were apprehended, the more were still Afflicted by Satan, and the
number of Confessors increasing, did but increase the number of the Accused,
and the Executing some, made way for the apprehending of others; for still the
Afflicted complained of being tormented by new objects as the former were
removed. So that those that were concerned, grew amazed at the numbers and
quality of the persons accused and feared that Satan by his wiles had inwrapped
innocent persons under the imputation of that Crime.

<pb n="422"/>




And at last it was evidently seen that there must be a stop put, or the Generation
of the Children of God would fall under that condemnation.</p>


<p>Henceforth therefore the Juries generally acquitted such as were Tried,
fearing they had gone too far before. And Sir William Phips, Governour,
Reprieved all that were Condemned, even the Confessors, as well as others. And
the Confessors generally fell off from their Confessions; some saying, they
remembred nothing of what they said; others said they had belied themselves and
others. Some brake Prison and ran away, and were not strictly searched after,
some acquitted, some dismissed and one way or other all that had been accused
were set or left at liberty.</p>


<p>And although had the times been calm, the condition of the Confessors
might have called for a <hi rend="italic">melius
inquirendum</hi>,<ref target="n416">[416]</ref> yet
considering the combustion<ref target="n417">[417]</ref> and confusion this matter had brought us unto; it
was thought safer to under do than over do, especially in matters Capital, where
what is once compleated cannot be retrieved: but what is left at one time, may be
corrected at another, upon a review and clearer discovery of the state of the Case.
Thus this matter issued somewhat abruptly.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="subsection" id="d124">
<head>Chapter IV.</head>

<p>Here was generally acknowledged to be an error (at least on the one hand)
but the Querie is, Wherein?</p>


<p>[<hi rend="italic">A</hi>.] 1. I have heard it said, That the
Presidents<ref target="n418">[418]</ref> in England were not so exactly followed, because in those there had
been previous quarrels and threatnings of the Afflicted by those that were
Condemned for Witchcraft; but here, say they, not so. To which I answer.</p>


<p>1. In many of these cases there had been antecedent personal quarrels, and
so occasions of revenge; for some of those Condemned, had been suspected by
their Neighbours several years, because after quarrelling with their Neighbours,
evils had befallen those Neighbours. As may be seen in the Printed Tryals of S.
M. and B. B.<ref target="n419">[419]</ref> and others: See <hi
rend="italic">Wonders of the</hi>

<pb n="423"/>

<hi rend="italic">Invisible World</hi>, Page 105 to 137.<ref target="n420">[420]</ref> And
there were other like Cases not Printed.</p>


<p>2. Several confessors acknowledged they engaged in the quarrels of other
their confederates to afflict persons. As one Timothy Swan suffered great things
by Witchcrafts, as he supposed and testifyed. And several of the confessors said
they did so torment him for the sake of one of their partners who had some
offence offer'd her by the said Swan. And others owned they did the like in the
behalf of some of their confederates.<ref target="n421">[421]</ref></p>


<p>3. There were others that confessed their fellowship in these works of
darkness, was to destroy the Church of God (as is above in part rehearsed) which
is a greater piece of revenge then<ref target="n422">[422]</ref> to be avenged upon one particular
person.</p>


<p>[<hi rend="italic">A</hi>.] 2. It may be queried then, How doth it
appear that there was a going too far in this affair.</p>


<p>1. By the numbers of the persons accused which at length increased to
about an hundred and it cannot be imagined that in a place of so much
knowledge, so many in so small a compass of Land should so abominably leap
into the Devils lap at once.</p>


<p>2. The quality of several of the accused was such as did bespeak better
things, and things that accompany salvation. Persons whose blameless and holy
lives before did testify for them. Persons that had taken great pains to bring up
their Children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: Such as we had Charity
for, as for our own Souls: and Charity is a Christian duty commended to us. 1
Cor. 13 Chapt., Col. 3. 14, and in many other Scriptures.</p>


<p>3. The number of the afflicted by Satan dayly increased, till about Fifty
persons were thus vexed by the Devil. This gave just ground to suspect some
mistake, which gave advantage to the accuser of the Brethren<ref target="n423">[423]</ref> to make a breach
upon us.</p>


<p>4. It was considerable <ref target="n424">[424]</ref> that Nineteen were Executed, and all denyed the
Crime to the Death, and some of them were

<pb n="424"/>




knowing persons, and had before this been accounted blameless livers. And it is
not to be imagined, but that if all had been guilty, some would have had so much
tenderness as to seek Mercy for their Souls in the way of Confession and sorrow
for such a Sin. And as for the condemned confessors at the Bar (they being
reprieved) we had no experience whether they would stand to their
Self-condemning confessions, when they came to dye.</p>


<p>5. When this prosecution ceased, the Lord so chained up Satan, that the
afflicted grew presently well. The accused are generally quiet, and for five years
since, we have no such molestations by them.</p>


<p>6. It sways much with me that I have since heard and read of the like
mistakes in other places. As in Suffolk in England about the year 1645 was such
a prosecution, until they saw that unless they put a stop it would bring all into
blood and confusion.<ref target="n425">[425]</ref> The like hath
been in France, till 900 were put to Death,<ref target="n426">[426]</ref>
And in some other places the like; So that N. England is not the only place
circumvented by the wiles of the wicked and wisely Serpent in this kind.</p>


<p>Wierus <hi rend="italic">de Pr&oelig;stigiis Demonum</hi>, p.
678,<ref target="n427">[427]</ref> Relates, That an Inquisitor in the Subalpine Valleys, enquired after Women
Witches, and consumed above an hundred in the Flames, and daily made new
offerings to Vulcan of those that needed Helebore more than Fire,<ref target="n428">[428]</ref> Until the
Country peole rose and by force of Arms hindred him, and refer the matter to the
Bishop. Their Husbands, men of good Faith, affirmed that in that very time they
said of them, that they played and danced under a tree, they were in bed with
them.</p>

<pb n="425"/>


<p>R. Burton of Witches, etc. p. 158,<ref target="n429">[429]</ref> Saith, That in Chelmsford in Essex,
<hi rend="italic">Anno</hi> 1645, were Thirty tryed at once before Judge
Coniers, and Fourteen of them hanged, and an hundred more contained in several
Prisons in Suffolk and Essex.</p>


<p>If there were an Error in the proceedings in other places, and in N.
England, it must be in the principles proceeded upon in prosecuting the suspected,
or in the misapplication of the principles made use of. Now as to the case at
Salem, I conceive it proceeded from some mistaken principles made use of; for
the evincing whereof, I shall instance some principles made use of here, and in
other Countrys also, which I find defended by learned Authors writing upon that
Subject.<ref target="n430">[430]</ref></p>

<p>I shall conclude this Discourse with some Application of the whole.</p>


<p>1. We may hence see ground to fear, that there hath been a great deal of
innocent blood shed in the Christian World, by proceeding upon unsafe
principles, in condemning persons for Malefick Witchcraft.<ref target="n431">[431]</ref></p>


<p>2. That there have been great sinful neglects in sparing others, who by their
divinings about things future, or discovering things secret, as stollen Goods, etc.,
or by their informing of persons and things absent at a great distance, have
implored the assistance of a familiar spirit, yet coloured over with specious
pretences, and have drawn people to enquire of them: A sin frequently forbidden
in Scripture, as Lev. 19. 31 and 20. 6, Isa. 8. 19, 20. and yet let alone, and in
many parts of

the World, have been countenanced in their diabolical skill and profession;
because they serve the interest of those that have a vain curiosity, to pry into
things God hath forbidden, and concealed from discovery by lawful means. And
of others that by their inchantments, have raised mists, strange sights, and the
like, to beget admiration, and please Spectators, etc., When as<ref target="n432">[432]</ref> these divinations
and operations are the Witchcraft more condemned in Scripture than the
other.</p>


<p>3. But to come nigher home, we have cause to be humbled for the mistakes
and errors which have been in these Colonies, in their Proceedings against
persons for this crime, above fourty years ago and downwards, upon insufficient
presumptions and presidents<ref target="n433">[433]</ref> of our Nation, whence they came. I do not say, that
all those were innocent, that suffered in those times upon this account. But that
such grounds were then laid down to proceed upon, which were too slender to
evidence the crime they were brought to prove; and thereby a foundation laid to
lead into error those that came after. May we not say in this matter, as it is, Psal.
106. 6. <hi rend="italic">We have sinned with our fathers?</hi> And as,
Lam. 5. 7. <hi rend="italic">Our fathers have sinned and are not, and we
have born their iniquities?</hi> And whether this be not one of the sins the
Lord hath been many years contending with us for, is worthy our serious enquiry.
If the Lord punished Israel with famine three years for a sin of misguided zeal
fourty years before that, committed by the breach of a Covenant made four
hundred years before that: 2 Sam. 21. 1, 2, Why may not the Lord visit upon us
the misguided zeal of our Predecessors about Witchcraft above fourty years ago,
even when that Generation is gathered to their Fathers.</p>


<p>4. But I would come yet nearer to our own times, and bewail the errors and
mistakes that have been in the year 1692. In the apprehending too many we may
believe were innocent, and executing of some, I fear, not to have been
condemned; by following such traditions of our fathers, maxims of the Common
Law, and Presidents2 and Principles, which now we may see weighed in the
balance of the Sanctuary, are found too light. I heartily concur with that direction
for our publick prayers, emitted December 17, 1696, by our General Assembly,
in an order for a general Fast, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> &ldquo;That
God

<pb n="427"/>

would shew us what we know not, and help us wherein we have done amiss, to
do so no more: And especially that whatever mistakes on either hand, have been
fallen into, either by the body of this people, or any order of men, referring to
the late tragedy raised among us by Satan and his Instruments, through the awful
Judgment of God: He would humble us therefore, and pardon all the errors of his
Servants and People, that desire to love his Name, and be attoned to his
land.&rdquo; I am abundantly satisfyed that those who were most concerned to
act and judge in those matters, did not willingly depart from the rules of
righteousness. But such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and
lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former presidents, that we walked
in the clouds, and could not see our way. And we have most cause to be humbled
for error on that hand, which cannot be retrieved. So that we must beseech the
Lord, that if any innocent blood hath been shed, in the hour of temptation, the
Lord will not lay it to our charge, but be merciful to his people whom he hath
redeemed, Deut. 21. 8, And that in the day when he shall visit, he will not visit
this sin upon our land, but blot it out, and wash it away with the blood of Jesus
Christ.</p>


<p>5. I would humbly propose whether it be not expedient, that some what
more should be publickly done then<ref target="n434">[434]</ref> yet hath, for clearing the good name and
reputation of some that have suffered upon this account, against whom the
evidence of their guilt was more slender, and the grounds for charity for them
more convincing. And this (in order to our obtaining from the Lord farther
reconciliation to our land,) and that none of their surviving relations, may suffer
reproach upon that account. I have both read and heard of several in England,
that have been executed for Capital crimes, and afterwards upon sence of an error
in the process against them, have been restored in blood and honour by some
publick act. My Lord Cook<ref target="n435">[435]</ref> relates a story. A man going to correct a Girle his
Neice, for some offence, in an upper room, the Girle strove to save her self, till
her nose bled, and wiping it with a cloath, threw the bloody cloath out at the
window, and cryed Murder; and then ran down staires, got away and hid her self.
Her Uncle was prosecuted by her friends upon suspicion of

<pb n="428"/>

Murdering her, because she could not be found. He declared that she made her
escape, as above said. Then time was allowed him to bring her forth, but he
could not hear of her within the time, and fearing he should dy if she could not
be found, procures another Girle very like her, to appear in Court, and declare
she was his Neice that had been missing: But her relations examine this
counterfeit, until they find her out, and she confesseth she was suborned and
counterfeited the true Neice. Upon these presumptions the man was found guilty
of Murdering his Neice, and thereupon executed. And after his execution his true
Neice comes abroad and shews her self alive and well. Then all that saw it were
convinced of the Uncles innocency, and vanity of such presumptions. The
Printing and Publishing of this relation Vindicates the good name of the Uncle,
from the imputation of the crime of Murder. And this is one end of this present
discourse, to take off (so far as a discourse of this nature can) infamy from the
names and memory of such sufferers in this kind, as do not deserve the
same.</p>


<p>6. Here it may be suitable for us to enquire, What the Lord speaks to us
by such a stupendeous providence, in his letting loose Satan upon us in this
unusual way? <hi rend="italic">Ans.</hi> 1. We may say of this, as our
Saviour said of his washing his disciples feet, Joh. 13. <hi
rend="italic">What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.
The Judgments of the Lord are a great deep</hi>, Psal. 36. 6. <hi
rend="italic">How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding
out</hi>. 2. Yet somewhat of his counsel at present for our instruction may be
known, by comparing the Word and works of God together.</p>


<p>1. As when Joshua the high Priest though an holy chosen man of God,
stood before the Angel, Satan stood at his right hand to resist him, or to be his
adversary: And the advantage Satan had was by the filthy garments Joshua was
clothed with before the Angels: That is, some iniquity which yet was not passed
away, Zech. 3. 1, 3, 4. So we may say here were among Gods own Children
filthy garments. The sins of Lukewarmness, loss of our first love,
unprofitableness under the Gospel, slumbering and sleeping in the wise, as well
as foolish Virgins, worldliness, pride, carnal security, and many other sins. By
these and such like sins the accuser of the Brethren

<pb n="429"/>

got advantage to stand at our right hand (the place of an Accuser in Courts of
Justice) and there accuse us and resist us.</p>


<p>2. When the Egyptians refused to let Israel go to sacrifice and keep a feast
to the Lord in the Wilderness: The Lord cast upon [them] the fierceness of his
wrath, by sending Evil Angels among them, Psal. 78. 49. Egypts sins were (1.)
Coveteousness; they would not let Israel go, because they gained by their labours.
(2.) Contempt of God and his Instituted Worship, and Ordinances. They did not
count them of such concernment, that Israel should go into the Wilderness to
observe them. Both these sins have too much increased in our Land. (1.)
Coveteousness, an inordinate love of the World gave Satan advantage upon us.
(2.) Contempt of Gods Worship and Instituted Ordinances. The Errand of our
Fathers into this Wilderness, was to Sacrifice to the Lord; that is, to worship God
in purity of heart and life, and to wait upon the Lord, walking in the faith and
order of the Gospel in Church fellowship; that they might enjoy Christ in all his
Ordinances. But these things have been greatly neglected and despised by many
born, or bred up in the Land. We have much forgotten what our Fathers came
into the Wilderness to see. The sealing Ordinances of the Covenant of Grace in
Church-Communion have been much slighted and neglected; and the fury of this
Storm raised by Satan hath fallen very heavily upon many that lived under these
neglects. The Lord sends Evil Angels to awaken and punish our negligence: And
to my knowledge some have been hereby excited to enter into the Chamber of
Gods Ordinances, to hide themselves, until the indignation be over past.</p>


<p>3. David when he removed the Ark from Kirjathjearim, had the Ark put
into a new Cart, which should have been carried by the Kohathites. Numb. 3. 31.
And David thought this was right, until the Lord slew Uzza for touching the Ark:
But then he looked more exactly into the will of God; and confesseth that the
Lord made a breach upon them, because they sought him not after the due order,
1 Chron. 13. 5, 7, 9, 10, and 15. 11, 12, 13. Had not the Lord made that breach
upon them, they had persisted securely in their error. So I may say in this case.
In the prosecution of Witchcraft, we

<pb n="430"/>




sought not the Lord after the due order; but have proceeded after the methods
used in former times and other places, until the Lord in this tremendous way
made a breach upon us. And hereby we are made sensible that the methods
formerly used are not sufficient to prove the guilt of such a crime. And this I
conceive was one end of the Lords letting Satan loose to torment and accuse so
many; that hereby we may search out the truth more exactly. For had it not been
for this dreadful dispensation, many would have lived and dyed in that error,
which they are now convinced of.</p>


<p>4. The Lord delivered into the hand of Satan the Estate, Children, and
Body of Job, for the tryal of Jobs faith and patience, and proof of his perfection
and uprightness. So the Lord hath delivered into Satans hand mens Children and
Bodies, yea names and estates into Satans hand for the tryal of their faith and
patience, and farther manifestation of the sincerity of their professions.</p>


<p>7.<ref target="n436">[436]</ref> From that part of the discourse which shews the power of Satan to
torment the bodies, and disturb the minds of those, he is let loose upon, Chap.
6, I would infer, that Satan may be suffered so to darken the minds of some pious
Souls, as to cause them to destroy themselves by drowning, hanging, or the like.
And when he hath so far prevailed upon some, that formerly lived a Christian
life, but were under the prevalency of a distracting Melancholy at their latter end,
We may have Charity that their Souls are Saved, notwithstanding the sad
conclusion of their lives. I speak not to excuse any that having the free use of
their reason willingly destroy themselves, out of pride, discontent, impatience,
etc. Achitophel who out of height of Spirit because his Counsel was not followed,
and to prevent Davids executing of him, for his rebellion and treason, destroyed
himself, hath left his name to stink unto all generations.<ref target="n437">[437]</ref> And Judas who for his
unparalelled treachery in betraying his Master, and the Lord of life, was justly
left to hange himself; and the rope breaking or slipping he fell down head long,
or with his face down ward, so that he burst asunder in the midst, and all his
bowels gushed out, Math. 27. 5. with Act. 1. 13, left by his sin and punishment
in the last act of

<pb n="431"/>




his life the black character of a Son of perdition. But those that being out of their
right minds, and hurried by an evil Spirit, as persons under a force to be their
own executioners, are not always to be ranked with these.</p>


<p>8. Seeing we have been too fierce against supposed Malefick Witchcraft,
let us take heed we do not on the contrary become too favourable to divining
Witchcraft: And become like Saul who was too zealous against the Gibeonites,
and at last turned to seek after one that had a familiar Spirit, to his own
destruction. Let us not, if we can help it, suffer Satan to set up an ensuring office
for stolen Goods. That after he hath brought the curse of God into the house of
the thief, by tempting him to steal, he may not bring about the curse into the
houses of them from whom the goods were stolen, by alluring them to go to the
god of Ekron to enquire. That men may not give their Souls to the Devil in
exchange, for his restoring to them their goods again, in such a way of
divination. The Lord grant it may be said of New England, as is prophecyed of
Judah, Mic. 5. 12. <hi rend="italic">I will cut off Witchcrafts out of thine
hand, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers</hi>.</p>


<p>9. Another extream we must beware of, is, <hi
rend="italic">viz.</hi> Because our fathers in the beginning times of this
Land, did not see so far into these mysteries of iniquity, as hath been since
discovered, Let us not undervalue the good foundations they laid for God and his
people, and for us in Church and Civil Government. For Paul that eminent
Apostle knew but in part; no wonder then, if our Fathers were imperfect men. In
the purest times in Israel, there were some Clouds of ignorance over-shadowing
of them. Abraham, David, and the best Patriarchs were generally ignorant of the
sin of Polygamy. And although Solomon far exceeded Nehemiah in wisdom; yet
Nehemiah saw farther into the evil of Marrying Outlandish Women, than that
wisest of Kings, and meer fallen men. Neh. 13. 26. Josiah kept the Passeover
more exactly, than David, and all the Reforming Kings of Judah, 2 Chron. 35.
18.</p>


<p>All the godly Judges and Kings of Judah were unacquainted with, and so
negligent of the right observation of the feast of Tabernacles, until it came to
Nehemiahs time: And he understood and revived an ordinance of God, that lay
buried in oblivion, near about a thousand years. Now he that shall

<pb n="432"/>




reject all the good in doctrine and practice, which was maintained, professed and
practiced by so many Godly leaders, because of some few errors found among
them, will be found to fight against God. A dwarf upon a giants shoulders, can
see farther than the giant.</p>


<p>It was a glorious enterprize of the beginners of these Colonies, to leave
their native Country to propagate the Gospel: And a very high pitch of faith, zeal,
and courage that carryed them forth, to follow the Lord into this wilderness, into
a land that was not sown. Then was New England holiness to the Lord, and all
that did devour them, or attempted so to do, did offend, and evil did come upon
them. And the Lord did graciously remember this kindness of their Youth, and
love of their Espousals; In granting them many eminent tokens of his favour; by
his presence with them in his Ordinances, for the Conversion of Souls, and
edifying and comforting the hearts of his Servants: By signal answering their
prayers in times of difficulty: By protecting them from their Enemies; By guiding
of, and providing for them in a Desart. And the Lord will still remember this
their kindness unto their Posterity, unless that by their Apostasy from the Lord,
they vex his Holy Spirit, to turn to be their Enemy: And thereby cut off the
Entail of his Covenant Mercies; which God forbid. <hi rend="italic">Oh that
the Lord may be with us, as he was with our Fathers; and that he may not leave
us, nor forsake us!</hi></p>
