BY MARK TWAIN.

AN ENTERTAINING ARTICLE. 
</head> 
 
<p>I take the following paragraph from an article in the Boston 
"Advertiser":</p> 
 
<q><p>AN ENGLISH CRITIC ON MARK TWAIN.&mdash;Perhaps the most successful  
flights of the humor of 
Mark Twain have been descriptions of the persons who did not 
appreciate his humor at all.  We have become familiar with the 
Californians who were thrilled with terror by his burlesque of 
a newspaper reporter's way of telling a story, and we have heard 
of the Pennsylvania clergyman who sadly returned his 
"Innocents Abroad" to the book-agent with the remark that "the 
man who could shed tears over the tomb of Adam must be an 
idiot."  But Mark Twain may now add a much more glorious 
instance to his string of trophies.  The "Saturday Review," in its 
number of October 8, reviews his book of travels, which has 
been republished in England, and reviews it seriously.  We can 
imagine the delight of the humorist in reading this tribute to his 
power; and indeed it is so amusing in itself that he can hardly 
do better than reproduce the article in full in his next monthly 
Memoranda.</p></q> 
 
<p>[Publishing the above paragraph thus gives me a sort 
of authority for reproducing the "Saturday Review's" article in 
full in these pages.  I dearly wanted to do it, for I cannot write 
anything half so delicious myself.  If I had a cast-iron dog that 
could read this English criticism and preserve his austerity, I 
would drive him off the doorstep.</p><closer><signed>&mdash;EDITOR MEMORANDA.]</signed></closer>

REVIEWS OF NEW BOOKS. 
</head> 
 
<p>THE INNOCENTS ABROAD.  A Book of Travels.  By 
Mark Twain.  London: Hotten, publisher.  1870. 
 
</p><p>Lord Macaulay died too soon.  We never felt this so deeply as 
when we finished the last chapter of the above-named 
extravagant work.  Macaulay died too soon&mdash;for none but he 
could mete out complete and comprehensive justice to the 
insolence, the impertinence, the presumption, the mendacity, 
and, above all, the majestic ignorance of this author. 
 
</p><p>To say that the "Innocents Abroad" is a curious book, 
would be to use the faintest language&mdash;would be to speak of the 
Matterhorn as a neat elevation, or of Niagara as being "nice" or 
"pretty."  "Curious" is too tame a word wherewith the describe 
the imposing insanity of this work.  There is no word that is 
large enough or long enough.  Let us, therefore, photograph a 
passing glimpse of book and author, and trust the rest to the 
reader.  Let the cultivated English student of human nature 
picture to himself this Mark Twain as a person capable of doing 
the following-described things&mdash;and not only doing them, but 
with incredible innocence <hi rend="italic">printing them</hi> calmly and 
tranquilly in a book.  For instance: 
 
</p><p>He states that he entered a hair-dresser's in Paris to get 
shaved, and the first "rake" the barber gave with his razor it 
<hi rend="italic">loosened his "hide" and lifted him out of his chair</hi>. 
 
</p><p>This is unquestionably exaggerated.  In Florence he 
was so annoyed by beggars that he pretends to have seized and 
eaten one in a frantic spirit of revenge.  There is of course no 
truth in this.  He gives at full length a theatrical programme 
seventeen or eighteen hundred years old, which he professes to 
have found in the ruins of the Coliseum, among the dirt and 
mould and rubbish.  It is a sufficient comment upon this 
statement to remark that even a cast iron programme would not 
have lasted so long under such circumstances.  In Greece he 
plainly betrays both fright and flight upon one occasion, but 
with frozen effrontery puts the latter in this falsely tame form: 
"We <hi rend="italic">sidled</hi> toward the Piraeus."  "Sidled," indeed!  He 
does not hesitate to intimate that at Ephesus, when his mule 
strayed from the proper course, he got down, took him under 
his arm, carried him to the road again, pointed him right, 
remounted, and went to sleep contentedly till it was time to 
restore the beast to the path once more.  He states that a 
growing youth among his ship's passengers was in the constant 
habit of appeasing his hunger with soap and oakum between 
meals.  In Palestine he tells of ants that came eleven miles to 
spend the summer in the desert and brought their provisions 
with them; yet he shows by his description of the country that 
the feat was an impossibility.  He mentions, as if it were the 
most commonplace of matters, that he cut a Moslem in two in 
broad daylight in Jerusalem, with Godfrey de Bouillon's sword, 
and would have shed more blood <hi rend="italic">if he had had a graveyard 
of his own</hi>.  These statements are unworthy a moment's 
attention.  Mr. Twain or any other foreigner who did such a 
thing  
   <pb n="877"/>  
in Jerusalem would be mobbed, and would infallibly lose 
his life.  But why go on?  Why repeat more of his audacious 
and exasperating falsehoods?  Let us close fittingly with this 
one: he affirms that "in the mosque of St. Sophia at 
Constantinople I got my feet so stuck up with a complication of 
gums, slime, and general impurity, that <hi rend="italic">I wore out more 
than two thousand pair of bootjacks</hi> getting my books off 
that night, and even then some Christian hide peeled off with 
them."  It is monstrous.  Such statements are simply 
<hi rend="italic">lies</hi>&mdash;there is no other name for them.  Will the reader 
longer marvel at the brutal ignorance that pervades the 
American nation when we tell him that we are informed upon 
perfectly good authority that this extravagant compilation of 
falsehoods, this exhaustless mine of stupendous lies, this 
"Innocents Abroad," has actually been adopted by the schools 
and colleges of several of the States as a text-book! 
 
</p><p>But if his falsehoods are distressing, his innocence and 
his ignorance are enough to make one burn the book and 
despise the author.  In one place he was so appalled at the 
sudden spectacle of a murdered man, unveiled by the 
moonlight, that he jumped out of window, going through sash 
and all, and then remarks with the most childlike simplicity that 
he "was not scared, but was considerably agitated."  It puts us 
out of patience to note that the simpleton is densely 
unconscious that Lucrezia Borgia ever existed off the stage.  He 
is vulgarly ignorant of all foreign languages, but is frank 
enough to criticize the Italians' use of their own tongue.  He 
says they spell the name of their great painter "Vinci, but 
pronounce it Vinchy"&mdash;and then adds with a naivete possible 
only to helpless ignorance, <hi rend="italic">"foreigners always spell better 
than they pronounce</hi>."  In another place he commits the 
bald absurdity of putting the phrase "tare an ouns" into an 
Italian's mouth.  In Rome he unhesitatingly believes the legend 
that St. Philip Neri's heart was so inflamed with divine love that 
it burst his ribs&mdash;believes it wholly because an author with a 
learned list of university degrees strung after his name endorses 
it&mdash;"otherwise," says this gentle idiot, "I should have felt a 
curiosity to know what Philip had for dinner."  Our author 
makes a long, fatiguing journey to the Grotto del Cane on 
purpose to test its poisoning powers on a dog&mdash;got elaborately 
ready for the experiment, and then discovered that he had no 
dog.  A wiser person would have kept such a thing discreetly to 
himself, but with this harmless creature everything comes out.  
He hurts his foot in a rut two thousand years old in exhumed 
Pompeii, and presently, when staring at one of the cinder-like 
corpses unearthed in the next square, conceives the idea that 
may be it is the remains of the ancient Street Commissioner, 
and straightway his horror softens down to a sort of chirpy 
contentment with the condition of things.  In Damascus he 
visits the well of Ananias, three thousand years old, and is as 
surprised and delighted as a child to find that the water is "as 
pure and fresh as if the well had been dug yesterday."  In the 
Holy Land he gags desperately at the hard Arabic and Hebrew 
Biblical names, and finally concludes to call them 
Baldwinsville, Williamsburgh, and so on, <hi rend="italic">"for convenience 
of spelling!"</hi> 
 
</p><p>We have spoken thus freely of this man's stupefying 
simplicity and innocence, but we cannot deal similarly with his 
colossal ignorance.  We do not know where to begin.  And if 
we knew where to begin, we certainly would not know where 
to leave off.  We will give one more specimen, and one only.  
He did not know, until he got to Rome, that Michael Angelo 
was dead!  And then, instead of crawling away and hiding his 
shameful ignorance somewhere, he proceeds to express a pious, 
grateful sort of satisfaction that he is gone and out of his 
troubles! 
 
</p><p>No, the reader may seek out the author's exhibitions of 
his uncultivation for himself.  The book is absolutely 
dangerous, considering the multitude and variety of its 
misstatements, and the convincing confidence with which they 
are made.  And yet it is a text-book in the schools of America. 
 
</p><p>The poor blunderer mouses among the sublime 
creations of the Old Masters, trying to acquire the elegant 
proficiency in art-knowledge, which he has a groping sort of 
comprehension is a proper thing for the travelled man to be 
able to display.  But what is the manner of his study?  And 
what is the progress he achieves?  To what extent does he 
familiarize himself with the great pictures of Italy, and what 
degree of appreciation does he arrive at?  Read:</p> 
 
<q><p>When we see a monk going about with a lion and looking up 
into heaven, we know that that is St. Mark.  When we see a 
monk with a book and a pen, looking tranquilly up to heaven, 
trying to think of a word, we know that that is St. Matthew.  
When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to 
heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other 
baggage, we know that that is St. Jerome.  Because we know 
   <pb n="878"/>  
that he is always flying light in the matter of baggage.  When 
we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having 
no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are.  We do 
this because we humbly wish to learn.</p></q> 
 
<p>He then enumerates the thousands and thousands of 
copies of these several pictures which he has seen, and adds 
with accustomed simplicity that he feels encouraged to believe 
that when he has seen "SOME MORE" of each, and had a larger 
experience, he will eventually "begin to take an absorbing 
interest in them"&mdash;the vulgar boor. 
 
</p><p>That we have shown this to be a remarkable book, we 
think no one will deny.  That it is a pernicious book to place in 
the hands of the confiding and uninformed, we think we have 
also shown.  That the book is a deliberate and wicked creation 
of a diseased mind, is apparent upon every page.  Having 
placed our judgment thus upon record, let us close with what 
charity we can, by remarking that even in this volume there is 
some good to be found; for whenever the author talks of his 
own country and lets Europe alone, he never fails to make 
himself interesting; and not only interesting, but instructive.  
No one can read without benefit his occasional chapters and 
paragraphs, about life in the gold and silver mines of California 
and Nevada; about the Indians of the plains and deserts of the 
West, and their cannibalism; about the raising of vegetables in 
kegs of gunpowder by the aid of two or three teaspoonfuls of 
guano; about the moving of small farms from place to place at 
night in wheelbarrows to avoid taxes; and about a sort of cows 
and mules in the Humboldt mines, that climb down chimneys 
and disturb the people at night.  These matters are not only 
new, but are well worth knowing.<ref target="n1">[*]</ref> It is a pity the author did not 
put in more of the same kind.  His book is well-written and is 
exceedingly entertaining, and so it just barely escaped being 
quite valuable also.</p>
