<p> 
I am a courtier at the Palace of Kinomaru in the country of Chikuzen. You 
must know that in this place there is a famous pond called the Laurel 
Pond, where the royal ones often take their walks; so it happened that one 
day the old man who sweeps the garden here caught sight of the Princess. 
And from that time he has loved her with a love that gives his heart no 
rest. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Some one told her of this, and she said, "Love's equal realm knows no 
divisions," 
<ref target="n134.1">[1]</ref> 
 and in her pity she said, "By that pond there stands a laurel-tree, and 
on its branches there hangs a drum. Let him beat the drum, and if the 
sound is heard in the Palace, he shall see my face again." 
</p> 
 
<p> 
I must tell him of this. 
</p> 

<milestone unit="speech" n="Ayan1-2"/> 
<p> 
Listen, old Gardener! The worshipful lady has heard of your love and sends 
you this message: "Go and beat the drum that hangs on the tree by the 
pond, and if the sound is heard in the Palace, you shall see my face 
again." Go quickly now and beat the drum! 
</p>

They talk of the moon-tree, the laurel that grows in the Garden of the 
Moon. . . . But for me there is but one true tree, this laurel by the 
lake. Oh, may the drum that hangs on its branches give forth a mighty 
note, a music to bind up my bursting heart.
