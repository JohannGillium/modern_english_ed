<p>Thomas Hutchinson, then speaker of the Massachusetts House of
Representatives, was the architect of the Massachusetts currency reform adopted in 1749 and implemented
in 1750. The colony used the Parliamentary
reimbursement awarded the colony for their expenses in the Cape
Breton expedition to call in and exchange the colony's paper money for
silver, returning Massachusetts Bay to a silver standard. Hutchinson was
also the author of<hi rend="italic"> The History of the Colony and Province of
Massachusetts-Bay</hi>, the most important contemporary history of the
colony, and his account of the currency reform is one of the most
interesting and informative we have. Hutchinson refers to himself in the
third person in this passage, but the author of the account and the
speaker of the house are one and the same. In reforming the currency,
Hutchinson cooperated with Governor Shirley. Shirley's political enemies
included many hard money merchants, whose distrust and dislike of
Shirley led them, paradoxically, to oppose Hutchinson's plan. Douglass,
author of the Discourse, was a spokesman for
this faction. </p>

<p>Popular attitudes towards Hutchinson have fluctuated greatly over
time. Because he served as the last royal Governor of Massachusetts, and
thus became a symbol of royal authority, he went -in his own lifetime -from being one of the most admired men in the Bay colony to being one of
the most despised. In the 19th century, Hutchinson was rehabilitated, as
hard money historians looked upon him as a hero for his leadership in
returning Massachusetts to a specie standard, and ending inflation in
Massachusetts. Some 20th century historians have suggested that
Hutchinson was involved in a disreputable scheme to profit from the
currency reform. This innuendo has appeared in so many recent histories
that it has displaced the 19th century view of Hutchinson as the hero of
the episode. Having reviewed all the records, my opinion is that there
is absolutely no evidence to suggest Hutchinson's complicity in any such
scheme. The charge seems to have originated as a result of honest
mistakes made by 20th century historians in the interpretation of
contemporary documents. </p>

<p>Mr. Hutchinson, who was then speaker of the house of representatives,
imagined this to be a most favorable opportunity for abolishing bills of
credit, the source of so much iniquity and for establishing a stable
currency of silver and gold for the future. About two million two
hundred thousand pounds would be outstanding in bills in the year 1749.
One hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling at eleven for one which
was the lowest rate of exchange with London for a year or two before,
and perhaps the difference was really twelve for one, would redeem
nineteen hundred and eighty thousand pounds, which would leave but two
hundred and twenty thousand pounds outstanding, it was therefore
proposed that the sum granted by parliament should be shipped to the
province in Spanish milled dollars and applied for the redemption of the
bills as far it would serve for that purpose, and that the remainder of
the bills should be drawn in by a tax on the year 1749. This would
finish the bills. For the future, silver of sterling alloy at
6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> 8<hi rend="italic">d.</hi>
the ounce, if payment should be made in

<pb n="437"/>
bullion or otherwise milled
dollars at 6<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> each should be the lawful money of the province and no
person should receive or pay within the province, bills of credit of any
of the other governments of New-England. This proposal being made to the
governor he approved of it as founded in justice and tending to promote
the real interest of the province, but he knew the attachment of the
people to paper money and supposed it impracticable. The speaker,
however, laid the proposal before the house, where it was received with
a smile and generally thought to be an Utopian project and, rather out
of deference to the speaker, than from an apprehension of any effect,
the house appointed a committee to consider of it. The committee treated
it in the same manner but reported that the speaker should be desired to
bring in a bill for the consideration of the house. When this came to be
known abroad, exceptions were taken and a clamour was raised from every
quarter. The major part of the people, in number, were no sufferers by a
depreciating currency, the number of debtors is always more than the
number of creditors, and although debts on specialties had allowance
made in judgments of court for depreciation of the bills, yet on simple
contracts, of which there were ten to one specialty, no allowance was
made. Those who were for a fixed currency were divided. Some supposed
the bills might be reduced to so small a quantity as to be fixed
andstable and, therefore, were for redeeming as many by bills of
exchange as should be thought superfluous; others were for putting an
end to the bills, but in a gradual way, otherwise it was said a <hi rend="italic">fatal
shock</hi> would be given to trade. This last was the objection of many men
of good sense. Douglass, who had wrote well upon the paper currency and
had been the oracle of the anti-paper party was among them and, as his
manner was with all who differed from him, discovered as much rancor against the author and promoters of this new
project as he had done against the fraudulent contrivers of paper
money emissions. </p>

<pb n="438"/>
<p>THE bills, it was said had sunk gradually in their value from
6<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. 10<hi rend="italic">d</hi>. &frac12; to 60<hi rend="italic">s.</hi> the ounce, by this
means creditors had been defrauded, it was but reasonable they should
rise gradually that justice might be done. But the creditors and debtors
would not be the same in one instance in a thousand, and where this was
not the case the injury was the same, to oblige any one to pay more as
to receive less than was justly due. Others were for exchanging the
bills at a lower rate than the then current price of silver. The
inhabitants had given credit to the government, when silver was at
30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ounce, and ought to be paid accordingly. Two of the
representatives of Boston urged their being exchanged at 30<hi rend="italic">s</hi>.
which would have given a most unreasonable profit to the present
possessor who had taken them at 55 or 60<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. To draw over some of
this party, concessions were made and the bills were exchanged at
50<hi rend="italic">s</hi>. the ounce instead of 55 as was at first proposed. </p>

<p>SOME of the directors and principal promoters of the land bank
scheme, being at this time members of the general court, unexpectedly
joined with the party who were for finishing paper money, but the
opposition was so great, that after many weeks spent in debating and
settling the several parts of the bill and a whole day's debate at last
in a committee of the whole house upon the expediency of passing the
bill, as thus settled, it was rejected and the report of the committee
accepted. </p>

<p>THE house, although upon some occasions exceptions are taken to
motions and proceedings which come before them as not being in
parliamentary form, yet are not strict in conforming to some of the most
useful rules of parliament. A bill or motion is not only referred from
one session to another, but a bill, after rejecting upon a second or
third reading, is sometimes taken up and passed suddenly the same
session. They have an order of the house, that when any affair has been
considered, it shall

<pb n="439"/>
not be brought before the house again the same
session unless there be as full a house as when it was passed upon.
This, if observed, would still be liable to inconvenience as any
designing person might take an opportunity upon a change of faces, the
number being as great as before, suddenly to carry any point, but even
this rule, like many other of what are called standing orders, is too
frequently by votes, on particular occasions, dispensed with, which
lessens the dignity of the house. </p>

<p>IT seems to be of no consequence to the prerogative whether the
currency of a colony be silver or paper, but the royal instructions from
time to time for preventing a depreciating currency, caused meerly by a
gracious regard to the interest of the people, had generally engaged
what was called the country party in opposition to them and in favor of
paper<ref target="n1">[1]</ref>. It was the case at this time. However, the
next morning, two members of the house<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> zealous
adherers to this party and who had been strong opposers of the bill,
came early to the house to wait the coming of the speaker and, in the
lobby let him know, that although they were not satisfied with several
parts of the bill yet they were alarmed with the danger to the province
from the schemes of those persons who were for a gradual reduction of
the bills and, by that means, for raising the value of the currency
without any provision for the relief of debtors and, therefore, they had
changed their minds and, if the bill could be brought forward again,
they would give their voice for it, and others who had opposed it would
do the same. The speaker, who had looked upon any further attempt to be
to no purpose, acquainted them that he did not think it proper to desire
any of the favorers of the bill to move for a reconsideration of it,
inasmuch as it had been understood and agreed in the house the day
before, that if upon a full debate had, the

<pb n="440"/>
bill should be rejected, no
further motion should be made about it. As soon as the house met, upon a
motion by one of these members seconded by the other, the bill was again
brought under consideration and passed the house as it afterwards did
the council and had the governor's consent. </p>

<p>The provision made in this act for the exchange of the bills and for
establishing a silver currency was altogether conditional and depended
upon a grant of parliament for reimbursement of the charge of the Cape
Breton expedition. This being at a distance and not absolutely certain,
the act had no sudden effect upon the minds of the people, but when the
news of the grant arrived the discontent appeared more visible, and upon
the arrival of the money there were some beginnings of tumults, and the
authors and promoters of the measure were threatened. The government
passed an act with a severe penalty against riots, and appeared
determined to carry the other act for exchanging the bills into
execution. The apprehension of a <hi rend="italic">shock</hi> to trade proved
groundless; the bills being dispersed through every part of the
province, the silver took place instead of them, a good currency was
insensibly substituted in the room of a bad one, and every branch of
business was carried on to greater advantage than before. The other
governments, especially Connecticut and Rhode Island, who refused, upon
being invited, to conform their currency to the Massachusets, felt a
<hi rend="italic">shock</hi> in their trade which they have not yet recovered. The
latter had been the importers, for the Massachusets, of West India goods
for many years, which ceased at once. New Hampshire, after some years,
revived its business and increased their trade in English goods, which
formerly they had been supplied with from the Massachusets. Perhaps,
they have rather exceeded. . . .  </p>

<p>The aversion, in the common people, to a silver and gold currency,
had occasioned several tumultuous assemblies in and near the town of
Boston. The paper, they said, was not worth hoarding, but silver and
gold would all fall to the share of men of wealth, and would either be
exported or hoarded up, and no part of it would go to the labourer, or
the lower class of people, who must take their pay in goods, or go
without. In a short time experience taught them, that it was as

<pb n="9"/>
easy for
a frugal industrious person to obtain silver, as it had been to obtain
paper; and the prejudice in the town of Boston was so much abated, that
when a large number of people from Abingdon [Abington], and other towns
near to it, came to Boston, expecting to be joined by the like people
there, they were hooted at, and insulted by the boys and servants, and
obliged to return home disappointed. </p>

<p>The assembly being then sitting, it was thought proper to pass an act
for preventing riots, upon the plan of the act of parliament known by
the name of the Riot Act, except that the penalty is changed from death,
to other severe and infamous punishment. </p>

<p>From an aversion to a silver currency, the body of the people changed
in a few months, and took an aversion to paper, though it had silver as
a fund to secure the value of it. A sufficient quantity of small change
could not be procured in England, when the grant made by parliament was
sent to America. The assembly, therefore, ordered a deposit to remain in
the treasury, of three thousand pounds in dollars, and issued small
paper bills of different denominations, from one penny to eighteen
pence; and every person, possessed of them to the amount of one dollar
or any larger sum, might exchange the bills at the treasury for silver
upon demand. The whole sum was prepared, but a small part only was
issued, and scarcely any person would receive them in payment, choosing
rather a base coin imported from Spain, called pistorines, at 20 per
cent. more than the intrinsick value. </p>

<p>From the first introduction of paper money, it

<pb n="10"/>
had been the practice
of government to issue bills for publick charges, and to make a tax for
the payment of the sum issued, in future years, into the treasury again.
The bills being all exchanged by the silver imported from England, and
provision made by law, that no bills of credit should ever after pass as
money, there was a difficulty in providing money for the immediate
service of government, until it could be raised by a tax. Few people, at
first, inclined to lend to the province, though they were assured of
payment in a short time with interest. The treasurer, therefore, was
ordered to make payment to the creditors of government in promissory
notes, payable to the bearer in silver in two or three years, with
lawful interest. This was really better than any private security; but
the people, who had seen so much of the bad effects of their former
paper money, from its depreciation, could not consider this as without
danger, and the notes were sold for silver at discount, which continued
until it was found that the promise made by government was punctually
performed. From that time, the publick security was preferred to
private, and the treasurer's notes were more sought for than those of
any other person whomsoever. This was the era of public credit in
Massachusetts Bay. </p>
