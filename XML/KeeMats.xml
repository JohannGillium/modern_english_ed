<head>Introduction</head>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">Matsukaze</hi> is a play of the third category. The original
text was by Kan'ami, but it was considerably reworked by Zeami. In its
present form it is a masterpiece, and its popularity has never faltered.
</p>

<p>
The word <hi rend="italic">matsukaze</hi> (wind in the pines) evokes
for Japanese a feeling of exquisite solitude and melancholy. Suma Bay, the
scene of the play, has similar associations, for it was the place where
Genji was exiled. The account of Genji's exile, recounted in the "Exile at
Suma" chapter of <hi rend="italic">The Tale of Genji</hi>, was apparently inspired
by the exile of Ariwara no Yukihira (818-893), a famous poet, courtier,
and scholar. Yukihira's poem on his exile, found in the
<hi rend="italic">Kokinsh&umacr;</hi>, is quoted in the play. Another source for
the play is a story told in the <hi rend="italic">Sensh&umacr;sh&omacr;</hi>, a
thirteenth-century collection of tales: One day, when Yukihira was walking
along a beach near Suma he met some men spearing fish. He asked where they
lived, and they replied,</p>

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>"We who spend our lives</l>
<l>By the shore where the white waves break</l>
<l>Are fishermen's sons, and we have</l>
<l>No home we can call our own."</l>
</lg></q>

<p>
Yukihira was moved to tears.
</p>

<p>
Most of <hi rend="italic">Matsukaze</hi>, however, appears to have been the invention

<pb n="19"/>
of the playwright. It gives an impression of youthful vigor, but is
constructed with care. Matsukaze's "mad scene" is made almost inevitable,
and the lack of surprise only heightens the dramatic power. Only at the
conclusion of the play does the reader (or, even more so, the spectator)
realize how completely he has been gripped by the lyrical and dramatic
tension, when he is released from the dream by one of the most effective
wordplays in literature: Matsukaze and her sister Murasame (Autumn Rain)
withdraw, and suddenly the chorus restores their names to their original
meanings. The ghosts dissolve back into nature, leaving us alone,
listening only to the wind in the pines. No more beautiful awakening could
be imagined.
</p>
<p>
The play's imagery is built around the sea (salt, brine, the tide, waves,
the sea wind), the moon, and pine trees. These, with the mountains looming
in the background, compose an archetypal Japanese landscape. The moon,
moreover, is a symbol of Buddhist enlightenment. Although it shines alone
in the sky, it is reflected in many waters, just as the unified
Buddha-nature is manifested in seemingly distinct beings.
</p>
<p>
Suma, the scene of <hi rend="italic">Matsukaze</hi>, now lies within the city
limits of Kobe. The play is performed by all schools of N&omacr;.

The stage assistant places a stand with a pine sapling set into it at the

carries a rosary.

<p>
I am a priest who travels from province to province. Lately I have been in
the Capital. I visited the famous sites and ancient ruins, not missing a
one. Now I intend to make a pilgrimage to the western provinces.

<stage>
He faces forward.
</stage>

I have hurried, and here I am already at the Bay of Suma in Settsu
Province.

<stage>
His attention is caught by pine tree.
</stage>

How strange! That pine on the beach has a curious look. There must be a
story connected with it. I'll ask someone in the neighborhood.

<stage>
He faces the bridgeway.
</stage>

Do you live in Suma?
</p>
</sp>

<stage>
The Villager comes down the bridgeway to the first pine. He wears a short
sword.

<p>
Perhaps I am from Suma; but first tell me what you want.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Priest</speaker>
<p>
I am a priest and I travel through the provinces. Here on the beach I see
a solitary pine tree with a wooden tablet fixed to it, and a poem slip
hanging from the tablet. Is there a story connected with the tree? Please
tell me what you know.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Villager</speaker>
<p>
The pine is linked with the memory of two fisher girls, Matsukaze and
Murasame. Please say a prayer for them as you pass.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Priest</speaker>
<p>
Thank you. I know nothing about them, but I will stop at the tree and say
a prayer for them before I move on.
</p>
</sp>

<sp>
<speaker>Villager</speaker>
<p>
If I can be of further service, don't hesitate to ask.

Thank you for your kindness.

The Villager exits. The Priest goes to stage center and turns toward the
pine tree.

So, this pine tree is linked with the memory of two fisher girls,
Matsukaze and Murasame. It is sad! Though their bodies are buried in the

by autumn, their only memorial.
<milestone unit="speech" n="Mats3"/>
Ah! While I have been chanting sutras and
invoking Amida Buddha for their repose, the sun, as always on autumn days,
has quickly set. That village at the foot of the mountain is a long way.
Perhaps I can spend the night in this fisherman's salt shed.

assistant brings out the prop, a cart for carrying pails of brine, and
sets it by the gazing-pillar. He places a pail on the cart.<lb/>
Murasame enters and comes down the bridgeway as far as the first pine. She
wears the <hi rend="italic">tsure</hi> mask. Matsukaze follows her
and stops at the third pine. She wears the <hi rend="italic">wakaonna</hi> mask. Each carries a water pail. They face

<p>A while ago I asked someone the meaning of that solitary pine on the

and Murasame. There is no connection between them and me, but I went to
the pine anyway and said a prayer for them.
