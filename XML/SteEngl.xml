				<head>PREFACE</head>

				<p>This book is a sequel to my <hi rend="italic">History of English Thought in the
						Eighteenth Century.</hi> The title which I then ventured to use was more
					comprehensive than the work itself deserved. I felt my inability to write a
					continuation which should at all correspond to a similar title for the

					compact and energetic school of English Utilitarians I could thrown some light
					both upon them and their contemporaries. I had the advantage for this purpose of
					having been myself a disciple of the school during its last period. Many
					accidents have delayed my completion of the task; and delayed also its
					publication after it was written. Two books have been published since that time,
					which partly cover the same ground; and I must be content with referring my
					readers to them for further information. They are <hi rend="italic">The English

					<head>INTRODUCTORY</head>

					<p>The English Utilitarians of whom I am about to give some account were a group
						of men who for three generations had a conspicuous influence upon English
						thought and political action. Jeremy Bentham, James Mill and John Stuart
						Mill, were successively their leaders; and I shall speak of each in turn. It
						may be well to premise a brief introduction of the method which I have
						adopted. I have devoted a much greater proportion of my work to biography
						and to considerations of political and social conditions than would be
						appropriate to the history of philosophy. The reasons for such a course are
						very obvious in this case, inasmuch as the Utilitarian doctrines were worked
						out with a constant reference to practical applications. I think, indeed,
						that such a reference is often equally present, though not equally
						conspicuous, in other philosophical schools. But in any case I wish to show
						how I conceive the relation of my scheme to the scheme more generally
						adopted by historians of abstract speculation.</p>


					<p>I am primarily concerned with the history of a school or sect, not with the
						history of the arguments by which it justifies itself in the court of pure
						reason. I must therefore consider the creed as it was actually embodied in
						the dominant beliefs of the adherents of the school, not as it was expounded
						in lecture-rooms or treatises on first principles. I deal not with
						philosophers meditating upon Being and not-Being, but with men actively
						engaged in framing political platforms and carrying on popular agitations.
						The great majority even of intelligent partisans are either indifferent to
						the philosophic creed of their leaders or take it for granted. Its
						postulates are more or less implied in the doctrines which guide them in
						practice, but are not explicitly stated or deliberately reasoned out. Not
						the less the doctrines of a sect, political or religious, may be dependent
						upon theories which for the greater number remain latent or are recognised
						only in their concrete application. Contemporary members of any society,
						however widely they differ as to results, are employed upon the same
						problems and, to some extent, use the same methods and make the same
						assumptions in attempting solutions. There is a certain unity even in the
						general thought of any given period. Contradictory views imply some common
						ground. But within this wider unity we find a variety of sects, each of
						which may be considered as more or less representing a particular Smethod of
						treating the general problem: and therefore principles which, whether
						clearly recognised or not, are virtually implied in their party creed and
						give a certain unity to their teaching.</p>


					<p>One obvious principle of unity, or tacit bond of sympathy which holds a sect
						together depends upon the intellectual idiosyncrasy of the individuals.
						Coleridge was aiming at an important truth when he said that every man was
						born an Aristotelian or a Platonist.<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> Nominalists
						and realists, intuitionists and empiricists, idealists and materialists,
						represent different forms of a fundamental antithesis which appears to run
						through all philosophy. Each thinker is apt to take the postulates congenial
						to his own mind as the plain dictates of reason. Controversies between such
						opposites appear to be hopeless. They have been aptly compared by Dr. Venn
						to the erection of a snow-bank to dam a river. The snow melts and swells the
						torrent which it was intended to arrest. Each side reads admitted truths
						into its own dialect, and infers that its own dialect affords the only valid
						expression. To regard such antitheses as final and insoluble would be to
						admit complete scepticism. What is true for one man would not therefore be
						true -- or at least its truth would not be demonstrable -- to another. We
						must trust that reconciliation is achievable by showing that the difference
						is really less vital and corresponds to a difference of methods or of the
						spheres within which each mode of thought may be valid. To obtain the point
						of view from which such a conciliation is possible should be, I hold, one
						main end of modern philosophising.</p>


					<p>The effect of this profound intellectual difference is complicated by other
						obvious influences. There is, in the first place, the difference of
						intellectual horizon. Each man has a world of his own and sees a different
						set of facts. Whether his horizon is that which is visible from his parish
						steeple or from St. Peter's at Rome, it is still strictly limited: and the
						outside universe, known vaguely and indirectly, does not affect him like the
						facts actually present to his perception. The most candid thinkers will come
						to different conclusions when they are really provided with different sets
						of fact. In political and social problems every man's opinions are moulded
						by his social station. The artisan's view of the capitalist, and the
						capitalist's view of the artisan, are both imperfect, because each has a
						first-hand knowledge of his own class alone: and, however anxious to be
						fair, each will take a very different view of the working of political
						institutions. An apparent concord often covers the widest divergence under
						the veil of a common formula, because each man has his private mode of
						interpreting general phrases in terms of concrete fact.</p>


					<p>This, of course, implies the further difference arising from the passions
						which, however illogically, go so far to determine opinions. Here we have
						the most general source of difficulty in considering the actual history of a
						creed. We cannot limit ourselves to the purely logical factor. All thought
						has to start from postulates. Men have to act before they think: before, at
						any rate, reasoning becomes distinct from imagining or guessing. To explain
						in early periods is to fancy and to take a fancy for a perception. The world
						of the primitive man is constructed not only from vague conjectures and
						hasty analogies but from his hopes and fears, and bears the impress of his
						emotional nature. When progress takes place some of his beliefs are
						confirmed, some disappear, and others are transformed: and the whole history
						of thought is a history of this gradual process of verification. We begin,
						it is said, by assuming: we proceed by verifying, and we only end by
						demonstrating. The process is comparatively simple in that part of knowledge
						which ultimately corresponds to the physical sciences. There must be a
						certain harmony between beliefs and realities in regard to knowledge of
						ordinary matters of fact, if only because such harmony is essential to the
						life of the race. Even an ape must distinguish poisonous from wholesome
						food. Beliefs as to physical facts require to be made articulate and
						distinct; but we have only to recognise as logical principles the laws of
						nature which we have unconsciously obeyed and illustrated -- to formulate
						dynamics long after we have applied the science in throwing stones or using
						bows and arrows. But what corresponds to this in the case of the moral and
						religious beliefs? What is the process of verification? Men practically are
						satisfied with their creed so long as they are satisfied with the
						corresponding social order. The test of truth so suggested is obviously
						inadequate: for all great religions, however contradictory to each other,
						have been able to satisfy it for long periods. Particular doctrines might be
						tested by experiment. The efficacy of witchcraft might be investigated like
						the efficacy of vaccination. But faith can always make as many miracles as
						it wants: and errors which originate in the fancy cannot be at once
						extirpated by the reason. Their form may be changed but not their substance.
						To remove them requires not disproof of this or that fact, but an
						intellectual discipline which is rare even among the educated classes. A
						religious creed survives, as poetry or art survives, -- not so long as it
						contains apparently true statements of fact but -- so long as it is
						congenial to the whole social state. A philosophy indeed is a poetry stated
						in terms of logic. Considering the natural conservatism of mankind, the
						difficulty is to account for progress, not for the persistence of error.
						When the existing order ceases to be satisfactory; when conquest or commerce
						has welded nations together and brought conflicting creeds into cohesion;
						when industrial development has modified the old class relations; or when
						the governing classes have ceased to discharge their functions, new
						principles are demanded and new prophets arise. The philosopher may then
						become the mouthpiece of the new order, and innocently take himself to be
						its originator. His doctrines were fruitless so long as the soil was not
						prepared for the seed. A premature discovery if not stamped out by fire and
						sword is stifled by indifference. If Francis Bacon succeeded where Roger
						Bacon failed, the difference was due to the social conditions, not to the
						men. The cause of the great religious as well as of the great political
						revolutions must be sought mainly in the social history. New creeds spread
						when they satisfy the instincts or the passions roused to activity by other
						causes. The system has to be so far true as to be credible at the time; but
						its vitality depends upon its congeniality as a whole to the aspirations of
						the mass of mankind.</p>


					<p>The purely intellectual movement no doubt represents the decisive factor. The
						love of truth in the abstract is probably the weakest of human passions; but
						truth when attained ultimately gives the fulcrum for a reconstruction of the
						world. When a solid core of ascertained and verifiable truth has once been
						formed and applied to practical results it becomes the fixed pivot upon
						which all beliefs must ultimately turn. The influence, however, is often
						obscure and still indirect. The more cultivated recognise the necessity of
						bringing their whole doctrine into conformity with the definitely organised
						and established system; and, at the present day, even the uneducated begin
						to have an inkling of possible results. yet the desire for logical
						consistency is not one which presses forcibly upon the less cultivated
						intellects. They do not feel the necessity of unifying knowledge or bringing
						their various opinions into consistency and into harmony with facts. There
						are easy methods of avoiding any troublesome conflict of belief The
						philosopher is ready to show them the way. He, like other people, has to
						start from postulates, and to see how they will work. When he meets with a
						difficulty it is perfectly legitimate that he should try how far the old
						formula can be applied to cover the new applications. He may be led to a
						process of 'rationalising' or 'spiritualising' which is dangerous to
						intellectual honesty. The vagueness of the general conceptions with which he
						is concerned facilitates the adaptation; and his words slide into new
						meanings by imperceptible gradations. His error is in taking a legitimate
						tentative process for a conclusive test; and inferring that opinions are
						confirmed because a non-natural interpretation can be forced upon them.
						This, however, is only the vicious application of the normal process through
						which new ideas are diffused or slowly infiltrate the old systems till the
						necessity of a thoroughgoing reconstruction forces itself upon our
						attention. Nor can it be denied that an opposite fallacy is equally
						possible, especially in times of revolutionary passion. The apparent
						irreconcilability of some new doctrine with the old may lead to the summary
						rejection of the implicit truth, together with the error involved in its
						imperfect recognition. Hence arises the necessity for taking into account
						not only a man's intellectual idiosyncrasies and the special intellectual
						horizon, but all the prepossessions due to his personal character, his
						social environment, and his consequent sympathies and antipathies. The
						philosopher has his passions like other men. He does not really live in the
						thin air of abstract speculation. On the contrary, he starts generally, and
						surely is right in starting, with keen interest in the great religious,
						ethical, and social problems of the time. He wishes -- honestly and eagerly
						-- to try them by the severest tests, and to hold fast only what is clearly
						valid. The desire to apply his principles in fact justifies his pursuit, and
						redeems him from the charge that he is delighting in barren intellectual
						subtleties. But to an outsider his procedure may appear in a different
						light. His real problem comes to be: how the conclusions which are agreeable
						to his emotions can be connected with the postulates which are congenial to
						his intellect? He may be absolutely honest and quite unconscious that his
						conclusions were prearranged by his sympathies. No philosophic creed of any
						importance has ever been constructed, we may well believe, without such
						sincerity and without such plausibility as results from its correspondence
						to at least some aspects of the truth. But the result is sufficiently shown
						by the perplexed controversies which arise. Men agree in their conclusions,
						though starting from opposite premises; or from the same premises reach the
						most diverging conclusions. The same code of practical morality, it is often
						said, is accepted by thinkers who deny each other's first principles;
						dogmatism often appears to its opponents to be thorough-going scepticism in
						disguise, and men establish victoriously results which turn out in the end
						to be really a stronghold for their antagonists.</p>


					<p>Hence there is a distinction between such a history of a sect as I
						contemplate and a history of scientific inquiry or of pure philosophy. A
						history of mathematical or physical science would differ from a direct
						exposition of the science, but only in so far as it would state truths in
						the order of discovery, not in the order most convenient for displaying them
						as a system. It would show what were the processes by which they were
						originally found out, and how they have been afterwards annexed or absorbed
						in some wider generalisation. These facts might be stated without any
						reference to the history of the discoverers or of the society to which they
						belonged. They would indeed suggest very interesting topics to the general
						historian or 'sociologist.' He might be led to inquire under what conditions
						men came to inquire scientifically at all; why they ceased for centuries to
						care for science; why they took up special departments of investigation; and
						what was the effect of scientific discoveries upon social relations in
						general. But the two inquiries would be distinct for obvious reasons. If men
						study mathematics they can only come to one conclusion. They will find out
						the same propositions of geometry if they only think clearly enough and long
						enough, as certainly as Columbus would discover America if he only sailed
						far enough. America was there, and so in a sense are the propositions. We
						may therefore in this case entirely separate the two questions: what leads
						men to think? and what conclusions will they reach? The reasons which guided
						the first discoverers are just as valid now, though they can be more
						systematically stated. But in the 'moral sciences' this distinction is not
						equally possible. The intellectual and the social evolution are closely and
						intricately connected, and each reacts upon the other. In the last resort no
						doubt a definitive system of belief once elaborated would repose upon
						universally valid truths and determine, instead of being determined by, the
						corresponding social order. But in the concrete evolution which, we may
						hope, is approximating towards this result, the creeds current among mankind
						have been determined by the social conditions as well as helped to determine
						them. To give an account of that process it is necessary to specify the
						various circumstances which may lead to the survival of error, and to the
						partial views of truth taken by men of different idiosyncrasies working upon
						different data and moved by different passions and prepossessions. A history
						written upon these terms would show primarily what, as a fact, were the
						dominant beliefs during a given period, and state which survived, which
						disappeared, and which were transformed or engrafted upon other systems of
						thought. This would of course raise the question of the truth or falsehood
						of the doctrines as well as of their vitality: for the truth is at least one
						essential condition of permanent vitality. The difference would be that the
						problem would be approached from a different side. We should ask first what
						beliefs have flourished, and afterwards ask why they flourished, and how far
						their vitality was due to their partial or complete truth. To write such a
						history would perhaps require an impartiality which few people possess and
						which I do not venture to claim. I have my own opinions for which other
						people may account by prejudice, assumption, or downright incapacity. I am
						quite aware that I shall be implicitly criticising myself in criticising
						others. All that I can profess is that by taking the questions in this
						order, I shall hope to fix attention upon one set of considerations which
						are apt, as I fancy, to be unduly neglected. The result of reading some
						histories is to raise the question: how people on the other side came to be
						such unmitigated fools? Why were they imposed upon by such obvious
						fallacies? That may be answered by considering more fully the conditions
						under which the opinions were actually adopted, and one result may be to
						show that those opinions had a considerable element of truth, and were held
						by men who were the very opposite of fools. At any rate I shall do what I
						can to write an account of this phase of thought, so as to bring out what
						were its real tenets; to what intellectual type they were naturally
						congenial; what were the limitations of view which affected the
						Utilitarians' conception of the problems to be solved; and what were the
						passions and prepossessions due to the contemporary state of society and to
						their own class position, which to some degree unconsciously dictated their
						conclusions. So far as I can do this satisfactorily, I hope that I may throw
						some light upon the intrinsic value of the creed, and the place which it
						should occupy in a definitive system.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER I<lb/> POLITICAL CONDITIONS</head>
					<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d10">
						<head>1. The British Constitution</head>


						<p>The English Utilitarians represent one outcome of the speculations
							current in England during the later part of the eighteenth century. For
							the reasons just assigned I shall begin by briefly recalling some of the
							social conditions which set the problems for the coming generation and
							determined the mode of answering them. I must put the main facts in
							evidence, though they are even painfully familiar. The most obvious
							starting-point is given by the political situation. The supremacy of
							parliament had been definitively established by the revolution of 1688,
							and had been followed by the elaboration of the system of party
							government. The centre of gravity of the political world lay in the
							House of Commons. No minister could hold power unless he could command a
							majority in this house. Jealousy of the royal power, however, was still
							a ruling passion. The party line between Whig and Tory turned ostensibly
							upon this issue. The essential Whig doctrine is indicated by Dunning's
							famous resolution (6 April 1780) that 'the power of the crown had
							increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished.' The resolution
							was in one sense an anachronism. As in many other cases, politicians
							seem to be elaborately slaying the slain and guarding against the
							attacks of extinct monsters. There was scarcely more probability under
							George III than there is under Victoria that the king would try to raise
							taxes without consent of parliament. George III, however, desired to be
							more than a contrivance for fixing the great seal to official documents.
							He had good reason for thinking that the weakness of the executive was
							an evil. The king could gain power not by attacking the authority of
							parliament but by gaining influence within its walls. He might form a
							party of 'king's friends' able to hold the balance between the
							connections formed by the great families and so break up the system of
							party government. Burke's great speech (11 Feb. 1780) upon introducing
							his plan 'for the better security of the independence of parliament and
							the economical reformation of the civil and other establishments'
							explains the secret and reveals the state of things which for the next
							half century was to supply one main theme for the eloquence of
							reformers. The king had at his disposal a vast amount of patronage.
							There were relics of ancient institutions: the principality of Wales,
							the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, and the earldom of Chester; each
							with its revenue and establishment of superfluous officials. The royal
							household was a complex 'body corporate' founded in the old days of
							'purveyance.' There was the mysterious 'Board of Green Cloth' formed by
							the great officers and supposed to have judicial as well as
							administrative functions. Cumbrous medieval machinery thus remained
							which had been formed in the time when the distinction between a public
							trust and private property was not definitely drawn or which had been
							allowed to remain for the sake of patronage, when its functions had been
							transferred to officials of more modern type. Reform was foiled, as
							Burke put it, because the turnspit in the king's kitchen was a member of
							parliament. Such sinecures and the pensions on the civil list or the
							Irish establishment provided the funds by which the king could build up
							a personal influence, which was yet occult, irresponsible, and corrupt.
							The measure passed by Burke in 1782 <ref target="n1.1">[1]</ref> made a
							beginning in the removal of such abuses.</p>


						<p>Meanwhile the Whigs were conveniently blind to another side of the
							question. If the king could buy, it was because there were plenty of
							people both able and willing to sell. Bubb Dodington, a typical example
							of the old system, had five or six seats at his disposal: subject only
							to the necessity of throwing a few pounds to the 'venal wretches' who
							went through the form of voting, and by dealing in what he calls this
							'merchantable ware' he managed by lifelong efforts to wriggle into a
							peerage. The Dodingtons, that is, sold because they bought. The 'venal
							wretches' were the lucky franchise-holders in rotten boroughs. The
							'Friends of the People'<ref target="n1.2">[2]</ref> in 1793 made the
							often-repeated statement that 154 individuals returned 307 members, that
							is, a majority of the house. In Cornwall, again, 21 boroughs with 453
							electors controlled by about 15 individuals returned 42 members,<ref
								target="n1.3">[3]</ref> or, with the two county members, only one
							member less than Scotland; and the Scottish members were elected by
							close corporations in boroughs and by the great families in counties. No
							wonder if the House of Commons seemed at times to be little more than an
							exchange for the traffic between the proprietors of votes and the
							proprietors of offices and pensions.</p>


						<p>The demand for the reforms advocated by Burke and Dunning was due to the
							catastrophe of the American War. The scandal caused by the famous
							coalition of 1783 showed that a diminution of the royal influence might
							only make room for selfish bargains among the proprietors of
							parliamentary influence. The demand for reform was taken up by Pitt. His
							plan was significant. He proposed to disfranchise a few rotten boroughs;
							but to soften this measure he afterwards suggested that a million should
							be set aside to buy such boroughs as should voluntarily apply for
							disfranchisement. The seats obtained were to be mainly added to county
							representation; but the franchise was to be extended so as to add about
							99,000 voters in boroughs, and additional seats were to be given to
							London and Westminster and to Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham, and
							Sheffield. The Yorkshire reformers, who led the movement, were satisfied
							with this modest scheme. The borough proprietors were obviously too
							strong to be directly attacked, though they might be induced to sell
							some of their power.</p>


						<p>Here was a mass of anomalies, sufficient to supply topics of denunciation
							for two generations of reformers, and, in time, to excite fears of
							violent revolution. Without undertaking the easy task of denouncing
							exploded systems, we may ask what state of mind they implied. Our
							ancestors were perfectly convinced that their political system was of
							almost unrivalled excellence: they held that they were freemen entitled
							to look down upon foreigners as the slaves of despots. Nor can we say
							that their satisfaction was without solid grounds. The boasting about
							English freedom implied some misunderstanding. But it was at least the
							boast of a vigorous race. Not only were there individuals capable of
							patriotism and public spirit, but the body politic was capable of
							continuous energy. During the eighteenth century the British empire
							spread round the world. Under Chatham it had been finally decided that
							the English race should be the dominant element in the new world; if the
							political connection had been severed by the bungling of his successors,
							the unbroken spirit of the nation had still been shown in the struggle
							against France, Spain, and the revolted colonies; and whatever may be
							thought of the motives which produced the great revolutionary wars, no
							one can deny the qualities of indomitable self-reliance and high courage
							to the men who led the country through the twenty years of struggle
							against France, and for a time against France with the continent at its
							feet. If moralists or political theorists find much to condemn in the
							ends to which British policy was directed, they must admit that the
							qualities displayed were not such as can belong to a simply corrupt and
							mean-spirited government.</p>


						<p>One obvious remark is that, on the whole, the system was a very good one
							-- as systems go. It allowed free play to the effective political
							forces. Down to the revolutionary period, the nation as a whole was
							contented with its institutions. The political machinery provided a
							sufficient channel for the really efficient force of public opinion.
							There was as yet no large class which at once had political aspirations
							and was unable to gain a hearing. England was still in the main an
							agricultural country: and the agricultural labourer was fairly
							prosperous till the end of the century, while his ignorance and
							isolation made him indifferent to politics. There might be a bad squire
							or parson, as there might be a bad season; but squire and parson were as
							much parts of the natural order of things as the weather. The farmer or
							yeoman was not much less stolid; and his politics meant at most a choice
							between allegiance to one or other of the county families. If in the
							towns which were rapidly developing there was growing up a discontented
							population, its discontent was not yet directed into political channels.
							An extended franchise meant a larger expenditure on beer, not the
							readier acceptance of popular aspirations. To possess a vote was to have
							a claim to an occasional bonus rather than a right to influence
							legislation. Practically, therefore, parliament might be taken to
							represent what might be called 'public opinion,' for anything that
							deserved to be called public opinion was limited to the opinions of the
							gentry and the more intelligent part of the middle classes. There was no
							want of complaints of corruption, proposals to exclude placemen from
							parliament and the like; and in the days of Wilkes, Chatham, and Junius,
							when the first symptoms of democratic activity began to affect the
							political movement, the discontent made itself audible and alarming. But
							a main characteristic of the English reformers was the constant appeal
							to precedent, even in their most excited moods. They do not mention the
							rights of man; they invoke the 'revolution principles' of 1688; they
							insist upon the 'Bill of Rights' or Magna Charta. When keenly roused
							they recall the fate of Charles I; and their favourite toast is the
							cause for which Hampden died on the field and Sidney on the scaffold.
							They believe in the jury as the 'palladium of our liberties'; and are
							convinced that the British Constitution represents an unsurpassable
							though unfortunately an ideal order of things, which must have existed
							at some indefinite period. Chatham in one of his most famous speeches,
							appeals, for example, to the 'iron barons' who resisted King John, and
							contrasts them with the silken courtiers which now compete for place and
							pensions. The political reformers of the time, like religious reformers
							in most times, conceive of themselves only as demanding the restoration
							of the system to its original purity, not as demanding its abrogation.
							In other words, they propose to remedy abuses but do not as yet even
							contemplate a really revolutionary change. Wilkes was not a 'Wilkite,'
							nor was any of his party, if Wilkite meant anything like Jacobin.</p>

						<head>II. The Ruling Class</head>


						<p>Thus, however anomalous the constitution of parliament, there was no
							thought of any far-reaching revolution The great mass of the population
							was too ignorant, too scattered and too poor to have any real political
							opinions. So long as certain prejudices were not aroused, it was content
							to leave the management of the state to the dominant class, which alone
							was intelligent enough to take an interest in public affairs and strong
							enough to make its interest felt. This class consisted in the first
							place of the great landed interest. When Lord North opposed Pitt's
							reform in 1785 he said <ref target="n1.4">[4]</ref> that the
							Constitution was 'the work of infinite wisdom... the most beautiful
							fabric that had ever existed since the beginning of time.' He added that
							'the bulk and weight' of the house ought to be in 'the hands of the
							country-gentlemen, the best and most respectable objects of the
							confidence of the people.' The speech, though intended to please an
							audience of country-gentlemen, represented a genuine belief.<ref
								target="n1.5">[5]</ref> The country-gentlemen formed the class to
							which not only the constitutional laws but the prevailing sentiment of
							the country gave the lead in politics as in the whole social system.
							Even reformers proposed to improve the House of Commons chiefly by
							increasing the number of county-members, and a county-member was almost
							necessarily a country-gentleman of an exalted kind. Although the
							country-gentleman was very far from having all things his own way, his
							ideals and prejudices were in a great degree the mould to which the
							other politically important class conformed. There was indeed a growing
							jealousy between the landholders and the 'monied-men.' Bolingbroke had
							expressed this distrust at an earlier part of the century. But the true
							representative of the period was his successful rival, Walpole, a
							thorough country-gentleman who had learned to understand the mysteries
							of finance and acquired the confidence of the city. The great merchants
							of London and the rising manufacturers in the country were rapidly
							growing in wealth and influence. The monied-men represented the most
							active, energetic, and growing part of the body politic. Their interests
							determined the direction of the national policy. The great wars of the
							century were undertaken in the interests of British trade. The extension
							of the empire in India was carried on through a great commercial
							company. The growth of commerce supported the sea-power which was the
							main factor in the development of the empire. The new industrial
							organisation which was arising was in later years to represent a class
							distinctly opposed to the old aristocratic order. At present it was in a
							comparatively subordinate position. The squire was interested in the
							land and the church; the merchant thought more of commerce and was apt
							to be a dissenter. But the merchant, in spite of some little jealousies,
							admitted the claims of the country-gentleman to be his social superior
							and political leader. His highest ambition was to be himself admitted to
							the class or to secure the admission of his family. As he became rich he
							bought a solid mansion at Clapham or Wimbledon, and, if he made a
							fortune, might become lord of manors in the country. He could not as yet
							aspire to become himself a peer, but he might be the ancestor of peers.
							The son of Josiah Child, the great merchant of the seventeenth century,
							became Earl Tylney, and built at Wanstead one of the noblest mansions in
							England. His contemporary Sir Francis Child, Lord Mayor, and a founder
							of the Bank of England, built Osterley House, and was ancestor of the
							earls of Jersey and Westmoreland. The daughter of Sir John Barnard, the
							typical merchant of Walpole's time, married the second Lord Palmerston.
							Beckford, the famous Lord Mayor of Chatham's day, was father of the
							author of <hi rend="italic">Vathek,</hi> who married an earl's daughter
							and became the father of a duchess. The Barings, descendants of a German
							pastor, settled in England early in the century and became
							country-gentlemen, baronets, and peers. Cobbett, who saw them rise,
							reviled the stockjobbers who were buying out the old families. But the
							process had begun long before his days, and meant that the heads of the
							new industrial system were being absorbed into the class of territorial
							magnates. That class represented the framework upon which both political
							and social power was moulded.</p>


						<p>This implies an essential characteristic of the time. A familiar topic of
							the admirers of the British Constitution was the absence of the sharp
							lines of demarcation between classes and of the exclusive aristocratic
							privileges which, in France, provoked the revolution. In England the
							ruling class was not a 'survival'; it had not retained privileges
							without discharging corresponding functions. The essence of
							'self-government,' says its most learned commentator,<ref target="n1.6"
								>[6]</ref> is the organic connection 'between State and society.' On
							the Continent, that is, powers were intrusted to a centralised
							administrative and judicial hierarchy, which in England were left to the
							class independently strong by its social position. The landholder was
							powerful as a product of the whole system of industrial and agricultural
							development; and he was bound in return to perform arduous and
							complicated duties. How far he performed them well is another question.
							At least, he did whatever was done in the way of governing, and
							therefore did not sink into a mere excrescence or superfluity. I must
							try to point out certain results which had a material effect upon
							English opinion in general and, in particular, upon the
						Utilitarians.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="3" id="d12">
						<head>III. Legislation and Administration</head>

						<p>The country-gentlemen formed the bulk of the lawmaking body, and the laws
							gave the first point of assault of the Utilitarian movement. One
							explanation is suggested by a phrase attributed to Sir Josiah Child.<ref
								target="n1.7">[7]</ref> The laws, he said, were a heap of nonsense,
							compiled by a few ignorant country-gentlemen, who hardly knew how to
							make good laws for the government of their own families, much less for
							the regulation of companies and foreign commerce. He meant that the
							parliamentary legislation of the century was the work of amateurs, not
							of specialists; of an assembly of men more interested in immediate
							questions of policy or personal intrigue than in general principles, and
							not of such a centralised body as would set a value upon symmetry and
							scientific precision. The country-gentleman had strong prejudices and
							enough common sense to recognise his own ignorance. The product of a
							traditional order, he clung to traditions, and regarded the old maxims
							as sacred because no obvious reason could be assigned for them. He was
							suspicious of abstract theories, and it did not even occur to him that
							any such process as codification or radical alteration of the laws was
							conceivable. For the law itself he had the profound veneration which is
							expressed by Blackstone. It represented the 'wisdom of our ancestors';
							the system of first principles, On which the whole order of things
							reposed, and which must be regarded as an embodiment of right reason.
							The common law was a tradition, not made by express legislation, but
							somehow existing apart from any definite embodiment, and revealed to
							certain learned hierophants. Any changes, required by the growth of new
							social conditions, had to be made under pretence of applying the old
							rules supposed to be already in existence. Thus grew up the system of
							'judge-made law,' which was to become a special object of the
							denunciations of Bentham. Child had noticed the incompetence of the
							country-gentlemen to understand the regulation of commercial affairs.
							The gap was being filled up, without express legislation, by judicial
							interpretations of Mansfield and his fellows. This, indeed, marks a
							characteristic of the whole system. 'Our constitution,' says Professor
								Dicey,<ref target="n1.8">[8]</ref> 'is a judge-made constitution,
							and it bears on its face all the features, good and bad, of judge-made
							law.' The law of landed property, meanwhile, was of vital and immediate
							interest to the country-gentleman. But, feeling his own incompetence, he
							had called in the aid of the expert. The law had been developed in
							medieval times, and bore in all its details the marks of the long series
							of struggles between king and nobles and parliaments. One result had
							been the elaborate series of legal fictions worked out in the conflict
							between private interests and public policy, by which lawyers had been
							able to adapt the rules fitted for an ancient state of society to
							another in which the very fundamental conceptions were altered. A
							mysterious system had thus grown up, which deterred any but the most
							resolute students. Of Fearne's essay upon 'Contingent remainders'
							(published in 1772) it was said that no work 'in any branch of science
							could afford a more beautiful instance of analysis.' Fearne had shown
							the acuteness of 'a Newton or a Pascal.' Other critics dispute this
							proposition; but in any case the law was so perplexing that it could
							only be fully understood by one who united antiquarian knowledge to the
							subtlety of a great logician. The 'vast and intricate machine,' as
							Blackstone calls it, 'of a voluminous family settlement' required for
							its explanation the dialectical skill of an accomplished schoolman. The
							poor country-gentleman could not understand the terms on which he held
							his own estate without calling in an expert equal to such a task. The
							man who has acquired skill so essential to his employer's interests is
							not likely to undervalue it or to be over anxious to simplify the
							labyrinth in which he shone as a competent guide.</p>


						<p>The lawyers who played so important a part by their familiarity with the
							mysteries of commercial law and landed property, naturally enjoyed the
							respect of their clients, and were rewarded by adoption into the class.
							The English barrister aspired to success by himself taking part in
							politics and legislation. The only path to the highest positions really
							open to a man of ability, not connected by blood with the great
							families, was the path which led to the woolsack or to the judge's
							bench. A great merchant might be the father or father-in-law of peers; a
							successful soldier or sailor might himself become a peer, but generally
							he began life as a member of the ruling classes, and his promotion was
							affected by parliamentary influence. But a successful lawyer might fight
							his way from a humble position to the House of Lords. Thurlow, son of a
							country-gentleman; Dunning, son of a country attorney; Ellenborough, son
							of a bishop and defendant of a long line of North-country 'statesmen';
							Kenyon, son of a farmer; Eldon, son of a Newcastle coal merchant,
							represent the average career of a successful barrister. Some of them
							rose to be men of political importance, and Thurlow and Eldon had the
							advantage of keeping George III's conscience -- an unruly faculty which
							had an unfortunately strong influence upon affairs. The leaders of the
							legal profession, therefore, and those who hoped to be leaders, shared
							the prejudices, took a part in the struggles, and were rewarded by the
							honours of the dominant class.</p>


						<p>The criminal law became a main topic of reformers. There, as elsewhere,
							we have a striking example of traditional modes of thought surviving
							with singular persistence. The rough classification of crimes into
							felony and misdemeanour, and the strange technical rules about 'benefit
							of clergy' dating back to the struggles of Henry II and Becket, remained
							like ultimate categories of thought. When the growth of social
							conditions led to new temptations or the appearance of a new criminal
							class, and particular varieties of crime became conspicuous, the only
							remedy was to declare that some offence should be 'felony without
							benefit of clergy,' and therefore punishable by death. By unsystematic
							and spasmodic legislation the criminal law became so savage as to shock
							every man of common humanity. It was tempered by the growth of technical
							rules, which gave many chances of escape to the criminal; and by
							practical revolt against its excesses, which led to the remission of the
							great majority of capital sentences.<ref target="n1.9">[9]</ref> The
							legislators were clumsy, not intentionally cruel; and the laws, though
							sanguinary in reality, were more sanguinary in theory than in practice.
							Nothing, On the other hand, is more conspicuous than the spirit of fair
							play to the criminal, which struck foreign observers.<ref target="n1.10"
								>[10]</ref> It was deeply rooted in the whole system. The English
							judge was not an official agent of an inquisitorial system, but an
							impartial arbitrator between the prisoner and the prosecutor. In
							political cases especially a marked change was brought about by the
							revolution of 1688. If our ancestors talked some nOnsense about trial by
							jury, the system certainly insured that the persons accused of libel or
							sedition should have a fair trial, and very often something more. Judges
							of the Jeffreys type had become inconceivable, though impartiality might
							disappear in cases where the prejudices of juries were actively aroused.
							Englishmen might fairly boast of their immunity from the arbitrary
							methods of continental rulers; and their unhesitating confidence in the
							fairness of the system became so ingrained as to be taken as a matter of
							course, and scarcely received due credit from later critics of the
							system.</p>


						<p>The country-gentleman, again, was not only the legislator but a most
							important figure in the judicial and administrative system. As justice
							of the peace, he was the representative of law and order to his country
							neighbours. The preface of 1785 to the fifteenth edition of Burn's <hi
								rend="italic">Justice of the Peace,</hi> published originally in
							1755, mentions that in the interval between these dates, some three
							hundred statutes had been passed affecting the duties of justices, while
							half as many had been repealed or modified. The justice was of course,
							as a rule, a superficial lawyer, and had to be prompted by his clerk,
							the two representing on a small scale the general relation between the
							lawyers and the ruling class. Burn tells the justice for his comfort
							that the judges will take a lenient view of any errors into which his
							ignorance may have led him. The discharge of such duties by an
							independent gentleman was thought to be so desirable and so creditable
							to him that his want of efficiency must be regarded with consideration.
							Nor, though the justices have been a favourite butt for satirists, does
							it appear that the system worked badly. When it became necessary to
							appoint paid magistrates in London, and the pay, according to the
							prevalent system, was provided by fees, the new officials became known
							as 'trading justices,' and their salaries, as Fielding tells us, were
							some of the 'dirtiest money upon earth.' The justices might perhaps be
							hard upon a poacher (as, indeed, the game laws became one of the great
							scandals of the system), or liable to be misled by a shrewd attorney;
							but they were on the whole regarded as the natural and creditable
							representatives of legal authority in the country.</p>


						<p>The justices, again, discharged functions which would elsewhere belong to
							an administrative hierarchy. Gneist observes that the power of the
							justices of the peace represents the centre of gravity of the whole
							administrative system.<ref target="n1.11">[11]</ref> Their duties had
							become so multifarious and perplexed that Burn could only arrange them
							under alphabetical heads. Gneist works out a systematic account, filling
							many pages of elaborate detail, and showing how large a part they played
							in the whole social structure. An intense jealousy of central power was
							one correlative characteristic. Blackstone remarks in his more liberal
							humour that the number of new offices held at pleasure had greatly
							extended the influence of the crown. This refers to the custom-house
							officers, excise officers, stamp distributors and postmasters. But if
							the tax-gatherer represented the state, he represented also part of the
							patronage at the disposal of politicians. A voter was often in search of
							the place of a 'tidewaiter'; and, as we know, the greatest poet of the
							day could only be rewarded by making him an exciseman. Any extension of
							a system which multiplied public offices was regarded with suspicion.
							Walpole, the strongest minister of the century, had been forced to an
							ignominious retreat when he proposed to extend the excise. The cry arose
							that he meant to enslave the country and extend the influence of the
							crown over all the corporations in England. The country-gentleman had
							little reason to fear that government would diminish his importance by
							tampering with his functions. The justices of the peace were called upon
							to take a great and increasing share in the administration of the
							poor-law. They were concerned in all manner of financial details; they
							regulated such police as existed; they looked after the old laws by
							which the trades were still restricted; and, in theory at least, could
							fix the rate of wages. Parliament did not override, but only gave the
							necessary sanction to their activity. If we looked through the journals
							of the House of Commons during the American War, for example, we should
							get the impression that the whole business of the legislature was to
							arrange administrative details. If a waste was to be enclosed, a canal
							or a high-road to be constructed, there was no public department to be
							consulted. The gentry of the neighbourhood joined to obtain a private
							act of parliament which gave the necessary powers to the persons
							interested. No general enclosure act could be passed, though often
							suggested. It would imply a central commission, which would only, as was
							suggested, give rise to jobbery and take power out of the natural hands.
							Parliament was omnipotent; it could regulate the affairs of the empire
							or of a parish; alter the most essential laws or act as a court of
							justice; settle the crown or arrange for a divorce or for the alteration
							of a private estate. But it objected to delegate authority even to a
							subordinate body, which might tend to become independent. Thus, if it
							was the central power and source of all legal authority, it might also
							be regarded as a kind of federal league, representing the wills of a
							number of partially independent persons. The gentry could meet there and
							obtain the sanction of their allies for any measure required in their
							own little sphere of influence. But they had an instinctive aversion to
							the formation of any organised body representing the state. The
							neighbourhood which wanted a road got powers to make it, and would
							concur in giving powers to others. But if the state were to be intrusted
							to make roads, ministers would have more places to give, and roads might
							be made which they did not want. The English roads had long been
							infamous, but neither was money wasted, as in France, on roads where
							there was no traffic.<ref target="n1.12">[12]</ref> Thus we have the
							combination of an absolute centralisation of legislative power with an
							utter absence of administrative centralisation. The units meeting in
							parliament formed a supreme assembly; but they did not sink their own
							individuality. They only met to distribute the various functions among
							themselves.</p>


						<p>The English parish with its squire, its parson, its lawyer and its
							labouring population was a miniature of the British Constitution in
							general. The squire's eldest son could succeed to his position; a second
							son might become a general or an admiral; a third would take the family
							living; a fourth, perhaps, seek his fortune at the bar. This implies a
							conception of other political conditions which curiously illustrate some
							contemporary conceptions.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="4" id="d13">
						<head>IV. THE ARMY AND NAVY</head>

						<p>We are often amused by the persistency of the cry against a 'standing
							army' in England. It did not fairly die out until the revolutionary
							wars. Blackstone regards it as a singularly fortunate circumstance 'that
							any branch of the legislature might annually put an end to the legal
							existence of the army by refusing to concur in the continuance' of the
							mutiny act. A standing army was obviously necessary; but by making
							believe very hard, we could shut our eyes to the facts, and pretend that
							it was a merely temporary arrangement.<ref target="n1.13">[13]</ref> The
							doctrine had once had a very intelligible meaning. If James II had
							possessed a disciplined army of the continental pattern, with
							Marlborough at its head, Marlborough would hardly have been converted by
							the prince of Orange. But loyal as the gentry had been at the
							restoration, they had taken very good care that the Stuarts should not
							have in their hand such a weapon as had been possessed by Cromwell. When
							the Puritan army was disbanded, they had proceeded to regulate the
							militia. The officers were appointed by the lords-lieutenants of
							counties, and had to possess a property qualification; the men raised by
							ballot in their own districts; and their numbers and length of training
							regulated by Act of Parliament. The old 'train-bands' were suppressed,
							except in the city of London, and thus the recognised military force of
							the country was a body essentially dependent upon the country gentry.
							The militia was regarded with favour as the 'old constitutional force'
							which could not be used to threaten our liberties. It was remodelled
							during the Seven Years' War and embodied during that and all our later
							wars. It was, however, ineffective by its very nature. An aristocracy
							which chose to carry on wars must have a professional army in fact,
							however careful it might be to pretend that it was a provision for a
							passing necessity. The pretence had serious consequences. Since the army
							was not to have interests separate from the people, there was no reason
							for building barracks. The men might be billeted on publicans, or placed
							under canvas, while they were wanted. When the great war came upon us,
							large sums had to be spent to make up for the previous neglect. Fox, on
							22nd February 1793, protested during a lively debate upon this subject
							that sound constitutional principles condemned barracks, because to mix
							the army with the people was the 'best security against the danger of a
							standing army.'<ref target="n1.14">[14]</ref></p>


						<p>In fact a large part of the army was a mere temporary force. In 1762,
							towards the end of the Seven Years' War, we had about 100,000 men in
							pay; and after the peace, the force was reduced to under 20,000. Similar
							changes took place in every war. The ruling class took advantage of the
							position. An army might be hired from Germany for the occasion. New
							regiments were generally raised by some great man who gave commissions
							to his own relations and dependants. When the Pretender was in Scotland,
							for example, fifteen regiments were raised by patriotic nobles, who gave
							the commissions, and stipulated that although they were to be employed
							only in suppressing the rising, the officers should have permanent
								rank.<ref target="n1.15">[15]</ref> So, as was shown in Mrs Clarke's
							case, a patent for raising a regiment might be a source of profit to the
							undertaker, who again might get it by bribing the mistress of a royal
							duke. The officers had, according to the generally prevalent system, a
							modified property in their commissions; and the system of sale was not
							abolished till our own days. We may therefore say that the ruling class,
							on the one hand, objected to a standing army, and, on the other, since
							such an army was a necessity, farmed it from the country and were
							admitted to have a certain degree of private property in the concern.
							The prejudice against any permanent establishment made it necessary to
							fill the ranks on occasion by all manner of questionable expedients.
							Bounties were offered to attract the vagrants who hung loose upon
							society. Smugglers, poachers, and the like were allowed to choose
							between military service and transportation. The general effect was to
							provide an army of blackguards commanded by gentlemen. The army no doubt
							had its merits as well as its defects. The continental armies which it
							met were collected by equally demoralising methods until the French
							revolution led to a systematic conscription. The bad side is suggested
							by Napier's famous phrase, the 'cold shade of our aristocracy'; while
							Napier gives facts enough to prove both the brutality too often shown by
							the private soldier and the dogged courage which is taken to be
							characteristic even of the English blackguard. By others, -- by such men
							as the duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston, for example, types of the
							true aristocrat -- the system was defended <ref target="n1.16"
							>[16]</ref> as bringing men of good family into the army and so
							providing it, as the duke thought, with the best set of officers in
							Europe. No doubt they and the royal dukes who commanded them were apt to
							be grossly ignorant of their business; but it may be admitted by a
							historian that they often showed the qualities of which Wellington was
							himself a type. The English officer was a gentleman before he was a
							soldier, and considered the military virtues to be a part of his natural
							endowment. But it was undoubtedly a part of his traditional code of
							honour to do his duty manfully and to do it rather as a manifestation of
							his own spirit than from any desire for rewards or decorations. The same
							quality is represented more strikingly by the navy. The English admiral
							represents the most attractive and stirring type of heroism in our
							history. Nelson and the 'band of brothers' who served with him, the
							simple and high-minded sailors who summed up the whole duty of man in
							doing their best to crush the enemies of their country, are among the
							finest examples of single-souled devotion to the calls of patriotism.
							The navy, indeed, had its ugly side no less than the army. There was
							corruption at Greenwich <ref target="n1.17">[17]</ref> and in the
							dockyards, and parliamentary intrigue was a road to professional
							success. Voltaire notes the queer contrast between the English boast of
							personal liberty and the practice of filling up the crews by press
							gangs. The discipline was often barbarous, and the wrongs of the common
							sailor found sufficient expression in the mutiny at the Nore. A
							grievance, however, which pressed upon a single class was maintained
							from the necessity of the case and the inertness of the administrative
							system. The navy did not excite the same jealousy as the army; and the
							officers were more professionally skilful than their brethren. The
							national qualities come out, often in their highest form, in the race of
							great seamen upon whom the security of the island power essentially
							depended.</p>

						<head>V. THE CHURCH</head>

						<p>I turn, however, to the profession which was more directly connected with
							the intellectual development of the country. The nature of the church
							establishment gives the most obvious illustration of the connection
							between the intellectual position on the one hand and the social and
							political order on the other, though I do not presume to decide how far
							either should be regarded as effect and the other as cause.</p>


						<p>What is the church of England? Some people apparently believe that it is
							a body possessing and transmitting certain supernatural powers. This
							view was in abeyance for the time for excellent reasons, and, true or
							false, is no answer to the constitutional question. It does not enable
							us to define what was the actual body with which lawyers and politicians
							have to deal. The best answer to such questions in ordinary case would
							be given by describing the organisation of the body concerned. We could
							then say what is the authority which speaks in its name; and what is the
							legislature which makes its laws, alters its arrangements, and defines
							the terms of membership. The supreme legislature of the church of
							England might appear to be parliament. It is the Act of Uniformity which
							defines the profession of belief exacted from the clergy; and no
							alteration could be made in regard to the rights and duties of the
							clergy except by parliamentary authority. The church might therefore be
							regarded as simply the religious department of the state. Since 1688,
							however, the theory and the practice of toleration had introduced
							difficulties. Nonconformity was not by itself punishable though it
							exposed a man to certain disqualifications. The state, therefore,
							recognised that many of its members might legally belong to other
							churches, although it had, as Warburton argued, formed an 'alliance'
							with the dominant church. The spirit of toleration was spreading
							throughout the century. The old penal laws, due to the struggles of the
							seventeenth century, were becoming obsolete in practice and were
							gradually being repealed. The Gordon riots of 1780 showed that a
							fanatical spirit might still be aroused in a mob which wanted an excuse
							for plunder; but the laws were not explicitly defended by reasonable
							persons and were being gradually removed by legislation towards the end
							of the century. Although, therefore, parliament was kept free from
							papists, it could hardly regard church and state as identical, or
							consider itself as entitled to act as the representative body of the
							church. No other body, indeed, could change the laws of the church; but
							parliament recognised its own incompetence to deal with them. Towards
							the end of the century, various attempts were made to relax the terms of
							subscription. It was proposed, for example, to substitute a profession
							of belief in the Bible for a subscription to the Thirty-Nine Articles.
							But the House of Commons sensibly refused to expose itself by venturing
							upon any theological innovations. A body more ludicrously incompetent
							could hardly have been invented.</p>


						<p>Hence we must say that the church had either no supreme body which could
							speak in its name and modify its creed, its ritual, its discipline, or
							the details of its organisation; or else, that the only body which had
							in theory a right to interfere was doomed, by sufficient considerations,
							to absolute inaction. The church, from a secular point of view, was not
							so much a department of the state as an aggregate of offices, the
							functions of which were prescribed by unalterable tradition. It
							consisted of a number of bishops, deans and chapters, rectors, vicars,
							curates, and so forth, many of whom had certain proprietary rights in
							their position, and who were bound by law to discharge certain
							functions. But the church, considered as a whole, could hardly be called
							an organism at all, or, if an organism, it was an organism with its
							central organ in a permanent state of paralysis. The church, again, in
							this state was essentially dependent upon the ruling classes. A glance
							at the position of the clergy shows their professional position. At
							their head were the bishops, some of them enjoying princely revenues,
							while others were so poor as to require that their incomes should be
							eked out by deaneries or livings held <hi rend="italic">in
							commendam.</hi> The great sees, such as Canterbury, Durham, Ely, and
							Winchester, were valued at between &#163;20,000 and &#163;30,000
							a year; while the smaller, Llandaff, Bangor, Bristol, and Gloucester,
							were worth less than &#163;2000. The bishops had patronage which
							enabled them to provide for relatives or for deserving clergymen. The
							average incomes of the parochial clergy, meanwhile, were small. In 1809
							they were calculated to be worth &#163;255, while nearly four
							thousand livings were worth under &#163;150; and there were four or
							five thousand curates with very small pay. The profession, therefore,
							offered a great many blanks with a few enormous prizes. How were those
							prizes generally obtained? When the reformers published the <hi
								rend="italic">Black Book</hi> in 1820, they gave a list of the
							bishops holding sees in the last year of George III; and, as most of
							these gentlemen were on their promotion at the end of the previous
							century. I give the list in a note.<ref target="n1.18">[18]</ref></p>


						<p>There were twenty-seven bishoprics including Sodor and Man. Of these
							eleven were held by members of noble families; fourteen were held by men
							who had been tutors in, or in other ways personally connected with the
							royal family or the families of ministers and great men; and of the
							remaining two, one rested his claim upon political writing in defence of
							Pitt, while the other seems to have had the support of a great city
							company. The system of translation enabled the government to keep a hand
							upon the bishops. Their elevation to the more valuable places or leave
							to hold subsidiary preferments depended upon their votes in the House of
							Lords. So far, then, as secular motives operated, the tendency of the
							system was clear. If Providence had assigned to you a duke for a father
							or an uncle, preferment would fall to you as of right. A man of rank who
							takes orders should be rewarded for his condescension. If that
							qualification be not secured, You should aim at being tutor in a great
							family, accompany a lad on the grand tour, or write some pamphlet on a
							great man's behalf. Paley gained credit for independence at Cambridge,
							and spoke with contempt of the practice of 'rooting,' the cant phrase
							for patronage hunting. The text which he facetiously suggested for a
							sermon when Pitt visited Cambridge, 'There is a young man here who has
							six loaves and two fishes, but what are they among so many?' hit off the
							spirit in which a minister was regarded at the universities. The memoirs
							of Bishop Watson illustrate the same sentiment. He lived in his pleasant
							country house at Windermere, never visiting his diocese, and according
							to De Quincey, talking Socinianism at his table. He felt himself to be a
							deeply injured man, because ministers had never found an opportunity for
							translating him to a richer diocese, although he had written against
							Paine and Gibbon. If they would not reward their friends, he argued, why
							should he take up their cause by defending Christianity?</p>


						<p>The bishops were eminently respectable. They did not lead immoral lives,
							and if they gave a large share of preferment to their families, that at
							least was a domestic virtue. Some of them, Bishop Barrington of Durham,
							for example, took a lead in philanthropic movements; and, if considered
							simply as prosperous country gentlemen, little fault could be found with
							them. While, however, every commonplace motive pointed so directly
							towards a career of subserviency to the ruling class among the laity, it
							could not be expected that they should take a lofty view of their
							profession. The Anglican clergy were not like the Irish priesthood, in
							close sympathy with the peasantry, or like the Scottish ministers, the
							organs of strong convictions spreading through the great mass of the
							middle and lower classes. A man of energy, who took his faith seriously,
							was, like the Evangelical clergy, out of the road to preferment, or,
							like Wesley, might find no room within the church at all. His colleagues
							called him an 'enthusiast,' and disliked him as a busybody if not a
							fanatic. They were by birth and adoption themselves members of the
							ruling class; many of them were the younger sons of squires, and held
							their livings in virtue of their birth. Advowsons are the last offices
							to retain a proprietary character. The church of that day owed such a
							representative as Horne Tooke to the system which enabled his father to
							provide for him by buying a living. From the highest to the lowest ranks
							of clergy, the church was as Matthew Arnold could still call it, an
							'appendage of the barbarians.' The clergy, that is, as a whole, were an
							integral but a subsidiary part of the aristocracy or the great landed
							interest. Their admirers urged that the system planted a cultivated
							gentleman in every parish in the country. Their opponents replied, like
							John Sterling, that he was a 'black dragoon with horse meat and man's
							meat' -- part of the garrison distributed through the country to support
							the cause of property and order. In any case the instinctive
							prepossessions, the tastes and favourite pursuits of the profession were
							essentially those of the class with which it was so intimately
							connected. Arthur Young,<ref target="n1.19">[19]</ref> speaking of the
							French clergy, observes that at least they are not poachers and
							foxhunters, who divide their time between hunting, drinking, and
							preaching. You do not in France find such advertisements as he had heard
							of in England, 'Wanted a curacy in a good sporting country, where the
							duty is light and the neighbourhood convivial.' The proper exercise for
							a country clergyman, he rather quaintly observes, is agriculture. The
							ideal parson, that is, should be a squire in canonical dress. The clergy
							of the eighteenth century probably varied between the extremes
							represented by Trulliber and the Vicar of Wakefield. Many of them were
							excellent people, with a mild taste for literature, contributing to the
								<hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine,</hi> investigating the
							antiquities of their county, occasionally confuting a deist, exerting a
							sound judgment in cultivating their glebes or improving the breed of
							cattle, and respected both by squire and farmers. The 'Squarson,' in
							Sydney Smith's facetious phrase, was the ideal clergyman. The purely
							sacerdotal qualities, good or bad, were at a minimum. Crabbe, himself a
							type of the class, has left admirable portraits of his fellows. Profound
							veneration for his noble patrons and hearty dislike for intrusive
							dissenters were combined in his own case with a pure domestic life, a
							keen insight into the uglier realities of country life and a good sound
							working morality. Miss Austen, who said that she could have been
							Crabbe's wife, has given more delicate pictures of the clergyman as he
							appeared at the tea-tables of the time. He varies according to her from
							the squire's excellent younger brother, who is simply a squire in a
							white neckcloth, to the silly but still respectable sycophant, who
							firmly believes his lady patroness to be a kind of local deity. Many of
							the real memoirs of the day give pleasant examples of the quiet and
							amiable lives of the less ambitious clergy. There is the charming
							Gilbert White (1720-1793) placidly studying the ways of tortoises, and
							unconsciously composing a book which breathes an undying charm from its
							atmosphere of peaceful repose; William Gilpin (1724-1804) founding and
							endowing parish schools, teaching the catechism, and describing his
							vacation tours in narratives which helped to spread a love of natural
							scenery; and thomas Gisborne (1758-1846), squire and clergyman, a famous
							preacher among the evangelicals and a poet after the fashion of Cowper,
							who loved his native Needwood Forest as White loved Selborne and Gilpin
							loved the woods of Boldre; and Cowper himself (1731-1800) who, though
							not a clergyman, lived in a clerical atmosphere, and whose gentle and
							playful enjoyment of quiet country life relieves the painfully deep
							pathos of his disordered imagination; and the excellent W. L. Bowles
							(1762-1850), whose sonnets first woke Coleridge's imagination, who spent
							eighty-eight years in an amiable and blameless life, and was
							country-gentleman, magistrate, antiquary, clergyman, and poet.<ref
								target="n1.20">[20]</ref> Such names are enough to recall a type
							which has not quite vanished, and which has gathered a new charm in more
							stirring and fretful times. These most excellent people, however, were
							not likely to be prominent in movements destined to break up the placid
							environment of their lives nor, in truth, to be sources of any great
							intellectual stir.</p>

					<div3 type="section" n="6" id="d15">
						<head>VI. THE UNIVERSITIES</head>

						<p>The effect of these conditions is perhaps best marked in the state of the
							universities. Universities have at different periods been great centres
							of intellectual life. The English universities of the eighteenth century
							are generally noted only as embodiments of sloth and prejudice. The
							judgments of Wesley and Gibbon and Adam Smith and Bentham coincide in
							regard to Oxford; and Johnson's love of his university is an equivocal
							testimony to its intellectual merits. We generally think of it as of a
							sleepy hollow, in which portly fellows of colleges, like the convivial
							Warton, imbibed port wine and sneered at Methodists, though few indeed
							rivalled Warton's services to literature. The universities in fact had
							become, as they long continued to be, high schools chiefly for the use
							of the clergy, and if they still aimed at some wider intellectual
							training, were sinking to be institutions where the pupils of the public
							schools might, if they pleased, put a little extra polish upon their
							classical and mathematical knowledge. The colleges preserved their
							mediaeval constitution; and no serious changes of their statutes were
							made until the middle of the present century. The clergy had an almost
							exclusive part in the management, and dissenters were excluded even from
							entering Oxford as students.<ref target="n1.21">[21]</ref> But the
							clergyman did not as a rule devote himself to a life of study. He could
							not marry as a fellow, but he made no vows of celibacy. The college,
							therefore, was merely a stepping-stone on the way to the usual course of
							preferment. A fellow looked forwards to settling in a college living, or
							if he had the luck to act as tutor to a nobleman, he might soar to a
							deanery or a bishopric. The fellows who stayed in their colleges were
							probably those who had least ambition, or who had a taste for an easy
							bachelor's life. The universities, therefore, did not form bodies of
							learned men interested in intellectual pursuits; but at most, helped
							such men in their start upon a more prosperous career. The studies
							flagged in sympathy. Gray's letters sufficiently reveal the dulness
							which was felt by a man of cultivation confined within the narrow
							society of college dons of the day. The scholastic philosophy which had
							once found enthusiastic cultivators in the great universities had more
							or less held its own through the seventeenth century, though repudiated
							by all the rising thinkers. Since the days of Locke and Berkeley, it had
							fallen utterly out of credit. The bright common sense of the polished
							society of the day looked upon the old doctrine with a contempt, which,
							if not justified by familiarity, was an implicit judgment of the tree by
							its fruits. Nobody could suppose the divines of the day to be the
							depositaries of an esoteric wisdom which the vulgar were not worthy to
							criticise. They were themselves chiefly anxious to prove that their
							sacred mysteries were really not at all mysterious, but merely one way
							of expressing plain common sense. At Oxford, indeed, the lads were still
							crammed with Aldrich, and learned the technical terms of a philosophy
							which had ceased to have any real life in it. At Cambridge, ardent young
							radicals spoke with contempt of this 'horrid jargon -- fit only to be
							chattered by monkies in a wilderness.'<ref target="n1.22">[22]</ref>
							Even at Cambridge, they still had disputations On the old form, but they
							argued theses from Locke's essay, and thought that their mathematical
							studies were a check upon metaphysical 'jargon.' It is indeed
							characteristic of the respect for tradition that at Cambridge even
							mathematics long suffered from a mistaken patriotism which resented any
							improvement upon the methods of Newton. There were some signs of
							reviving activity. The fellowships were being distributed with less
							regard to private interest. The mathematical tripos founded at Cambridge
							in the middle of the century became the prototype of all competitive
							examinations; and half a century later Oxford followed the precedent by
							the Examination Statute of 1800. A certain number of professorships of
							such modern studies as anatomy, history, botany, and geology were
							founded during the eighteenth century, and show a certain sense of a
							need of broader views. The lectures upon which Blackstone founded his
							commentaries were the product of the foundation of the Vinerian
							professorship in 1751; and the most recent of the Cambridge colleges,
							Downing College, shows by its constitution that a professoriate was now
							considered to be desirable. Cambridge in the last years of the century
							might have had a body of very eminent professors. Watson, second
							wrangler of 1759, had delivered lectures upon chemistry, of which it was
							said by Davy that hardly any conceivable change in the science could
							make them obsolete.<ref target="n1.23">[23]</ref> Paley, senior wrangler
							in 1763, was an almost unrivalled master of lucid exposition, and one of
							his works is still a textbook at Cambridge. Isaac Milner, senior
							wrangler in 1774, afterwards held the professorships of mathematics and
							natural philosophy, and was famous as a sort of ecclesiastical Dr
							Johnson. Gilbert Wakefield, second wrangler in 1776, published an
							edition of Lucretius, and was a man of great ability and energy. Herbert
							Marsh, second wrangler in 1779, was divinity professor from 18O7, and
							was the first English writer to introduce some knowledge of the early
							stages of German criticism. Porson, the greatest Greek scholar of his
							time, became professor in 1790; Malthus, ninth wrangler in 1788, who was
							to make a permanent mark upon political economy, became fellow of Jesus
							College in 1793. Waring, senior wrangler in 1757, Vince, senior wrangler
							in 1775, and Wollaston, senior wrangler in 1783, were also professors
							and mathematicians of reputation. Towards the end of the century ten
							professors were lecturing.<ref target="n1.24">[24]</ref> A large number
							were not lecturing, though Milner was good enough to be 'accessible to
							students.' Paley and Watson had been led off into the path of
							ecclesiastical preferment. Marsh too became a bishop in 1816. There was
							no place for such talents as those of Malthus, who ultimately became
							professor at Haileybury. Wakefield had the misfortune of not being able
							to cover his heterodoxy with the conventional formula. Porson suffered
							from the same cause, and from less respectable weaknesses; but it seems
							that the university had no demand for services of the great scholar, and
							he did nothing for his &#163;40 a year. Milner was occupied in
							managing the university in the interests of Pitt and Protestantism, and
							in waging war against Jacobins and intruders. There was no lack of
							ability; but there was no inducement to any intellectual activity for
							its own sake; and there were abundant temptations for any man of energy
							to diverge to the career which offered more intelligible rewards.</p>


						<p>The universities in fact supplied the demand which was actually
							operative. They provided the average clergyman with a degree; they
							expected the son of the country-gentleman or successful lawyer to
							acquire the traditional culture of his class, and to spend three or four
							years pleasantly, or even, if he chose, industriously. But there was no
							such thing as a learned society, interested in the cultivation of
							knowledge for its own sake, and applauding the devotion of life to its
							extension or discussion. The men of the time who contributed to the
							progress of science owed little or nothing to the universities, and were
							rather volunteers from without, impelled by their own idiosyncrasies.
							Among the scientific leaders, for example, Joseph Black (1728-1799) was
							a Scottish professor. Priestley (1733-1804) a dissenting minister;
							Cavendish (1731-1810) an aristocratic recluse, who, though he studied at
							Cambridge, never graduated; Watt (1736-1819) a practical mechanician;
							and Dalton (1766-1844) a Quaker schoolmaster. John Hunter (1728-1793)
							was one of the energetic Scots who forced their way to fame without help
							from English universities. The cultivation of the natural sciences was
							only beginning to take root; and the soil, which it found congenial, was
							not that of the great learned institutions, which held to their old
							traditional studies.</p>


						<p>I may, then, sum up the result in a few words. The church had once
							claimed to be an entirely independent body, possessing a supernatural
							authority, with an organisation sanctioned by supernatural powers, and
							entitled to lay down the doctrines which gave the final theory of life.
							Theology was the queen of the sciences and theologians the interpreters
							of the first principles of all knowledge and conduct. The church of
							England, on the other hand, at our period had entirely ceased to be
							independent: it was bound hand and foot by acts of parliament: there was
							no ecclesiastical organ capable of shaking in its name, altering its
							laws or defining its tenets: it was an aggregate of offices the
							appointment to which was in the hands either of the political ministers
							or of the lay members of the ruling class. It was in reality simply a
							part of the ruling class told off to perform divine services: to
							maintain order and respectability and the traditional morality. It had
							no distinctive philosophy or theology, for the articles of belief
							represented simply a compromise; an attempt to retain as much of the old
							as was practicable and yet to admit as much of the new as was made
							desirable by political considerations. It was the boast of its more
							liberal members that they were not tied down to any definite dogmatic
							system; but could have a free hand so long as they did not wantonly come
							into conflict with some of the legal formulae laid down in a previous
							generation. The actual teaching showed the effects of the system. It had
							been easy to introduce a considerable leaven of the rationalism which
							suited the lay mind; to explain away the mysterious doctrines upon which
							an independent church had insisted as manifestations of its spiritual
							privileges, but which were regarded with indifference or contempt by the
							educated laity now become independent. The priest had been disarmed and
							had to suit his teaching to the taste of his patrons and congregations.
							The divines of the eighteenth century had, as they boasted, confuted the
							deists; but it was mainly by showing that they could be deists in all
							but the name. The dissenters, less hampered by legal formulae, had
							drifted towards Unitarianism. The position of such divines as Paley,
							Watson, and Hey was not so much that the Unitarians were wrong, as that
							the mysterious doctrines were mere sets of words, over which it was
							superfluous to quarrel. The doctrine was essentially traditional; for it
							was impossible to represent the doctrines of the church of England as
							deductions from any abstract philosophy. But the traditions were not
							regarded as having any mysterious authority. Abstract philosophy might
							lead to deism or infidelity. Paley and his like rejected such philosophy
							in the spirit of Locke or even Hume. But it was always possible to treat
							a tradition like any other statement of fact. It could be proved by
							appropriate evidence. The truth of Christianity was therefore merely a
							question of facts like the truth of any other passages of history. It
							was easy enough to make out a case for the Christian miracles, and then
							the mysteries, after it had been sufficiently explained that they really
							meant next to nothing, could be rested upon the authority of the
							miracles. In other words, the accepted doctrines, like the whole
							constitution of the church, could be so modified as to suit the
							prejudices and modes of thought of the laity. The church, it may be
							said, was thoroughly secularised. The priest was no longer a wielder of
							threats and an interpreter of oracles, but an entirely respectable
							gentleman, who fully sympathised with the prejudices of his patron and
							practically admitted that he had very little to reveal, beyond
							explaining that his dogmas were perfectly harmless and eminently
							convenient. He preached, however, a sound common-sense morality, and was
							not divided from his neighbours by setting up the claims characteristic
							of a sacerdotal caste. Whether he has become On the whole better or
							worse by subsequent changes is a question not to be asked here; but
							perhaps not quite so easily answered as is sometimes supposed.</p>


						<p>The condition of the English church and universities may be contrasted
							with that of their Scottish rivals. The Scottish church and universities
							had no great prizes to offer and no elaborate hierarchy. But the church
							was a national institution in a sense different from the English. The
							General Assembly was a powerful body, not overshadowed by a great
							political rival. To rise to be a minister was the great ambition of poor
							sons of farmers and tradesmen. They had to study at the universities in
							the intervals, perhaps, of agricultural labour; and if the learning was
							slight and the scholarship below the English standard, the young
							aspirant had at least to learn to preach and to acquire such philosophy
							as would enable him to argue upon grace and freewill with some
							hard-headed Davie Deans. It Was doubtless owing in part to these
							conditions that the Scottish universities produced many distinguished
							teachers throughout the century. Professors had to teach something which
							might at least pass for philosophy, though they were more or less
							restrained by the necessity of respecting orthodox prejudices. At the
							end of the century, the only schools of philosophy in the island were to
							be found in Scotland, where Reid (1710-1796) and Adam Smith (1723-1790)
							had found intelligent disciples, and where Dugald Stewart, of whom I
							shall speak presently, had become the recognised philosophical
							authority.</p>

						<head>VII. THEORY</head>

						<p>What theory corresponds to this practical order? It implies, in the first
							place, a constant reference to tradition. The system has grown up
							without any reference to abstract principles or symmetrical plan. The
							legal order supposes a traditional common law, as the ecclesiastical
							order a traditional creed, and the organisation is explicable only by
							historical causes. The system represents a series of compromises, not
							the elaboration of a theory. If the squire undertook by way of
							supererogation to justify his position he appealed to tradition and
							experience. He invoked the 'wisdom of our ancestors,' the system of
							'checks and balances' which made our Constitution an unrivalled mixture
							of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy deserving the 'dread and envy of
							the world.' The prescription for compounding that mixture could
							obviously be learned by nothing but experiment. Traditional means
							empirical. By instinct, rather than conscious reasoning, Englishmen had
							felt their way to establishing the 'palladia of our liberties': trial by
							jury, the 'Habeas Corpus' Act, and the substitution of a militia for a
							standing army. The institutions were cherished because they had been
							developed by long struggles and were often cherished when their real
							justification had disappeared. The Constitution had not been 'made' but
							had 'grown'; or, in other words, the one rule had been the rule of
							thumb. That is an excellent rule in its way, and very superior to an
							abstract rule which neglects or overrides experience. The 'logic of
							facts,' moreover, may be trusted to produce a certain harmony: and
							general principles, though not consciously invoked, tacitly govern the
							development of institutions worked out under uniform conditions. The
							simple reluctance to pay money without getting money's worth might
							generate the important principle that representation should go with
							taxation, without embodying any theory of a 'social contract' such as
							was offered by an afterthought to give a philosophical sanction.
							Englishmen, it is said, had bought their liberties step by step, because
							at each step they were in a position to bargain with their rulers. What
							they had bought they were determined to keep and considered to be their
							inalienable property. One result is conspicuous. In England the ruling
							classes did not so much consider their privileges to be something
							granted by the state, as the power of the state to be something derived
							from their concessions. Though the lord-lieutenant and the justices of
							the peace were nominated by the crown, their authority came in fact as
							an almost spontaneous consequence of their birthright or their acquired
							position in the country. They shone by their own light and were really
							the ultimate sources of authority. Seats in parliament, preferments in
							the church, commissions in the army belonged to them like their estates;
							and they seemed to be qualified by nature, rather than by appointment,
							to act in judicial and administrative capacities. The system of
							'self-government' embodies this view. The functions of government were
							assigned to men already powerful by their social position. The absence
							of the centralised hierarchy of officials gave to Englishmen the sense
							of personal liberty which compelled the admiration of Voltaire and his
							countrymen in the eighteenth century. In England were no <hi
								rend="italic">lettres de cachet,</hi> and no Bastille. A man could
							say what he thought and act without fear of arbitrary rule. There was no
							such system as that which, in France, puts the agents of the central
							power above the ordinary law of the land. This implies what has been
							called the 'rule of the law' in England. 'With us every official from
							the prime minister down to a constable or a collector of taxes' (as
							Professor Dicey explains the principle) 'is under the same
							responsibility for every act done without legal justification as any
							other citizen.'<ref target="n1.25">[25]</ref> The early centralisation
							of the English monarchy had made the law supreme, and instead of
							generating a new structure had combined and regulated the existing
							social forces. The sovereign power was thus farmed to the aristocracy
							instead of forming an organ of its own. Instead of resigning power they
							were forced to exercise it on condition of thorough responsibility to
							the central judiciary. Their privileges were not destroyed but were
							combined with the discharge of corresponding duties. Whatever their
							shortcomings, they were preserved from the decay which is the inevitable
							consequence of a divorce of duties from privileges.</p>


						<p>Another aspect of the case is equally clear. If the privilege is
							associated with a duty, the duty may also be regarded as a privilege.
							The doctrine seems to mark a natural stage in the evolution of the
							conception of duty to the state. The power which is left to a member of
							the ruling class is also part of his dignity. Thus we have an
							amalgamation between the conceptions of private property and public
							trust. 'In so far as the ideal of feudalism is perfectly realised,' it
							has been said,<ref target="n1.26">[26]</ref> 'all that we can call
							public law is merged in private law; jurisdiction is property; office is
							property; the kingship itself is property.' This feudal ideal was still
							preserved with many of the institutions descended from feudalism. The
							king's right to his throne was regarded as of the same kind as the right
							to a private estate. His rights as king were also his rights as the
							owner of the land.<ref target="n1.27">[27]</ref> Subordinate landowners
							had similar rights, and as the royal power diminished greater powers
							fell to the aggregate of constitutional kinglets who governed the
							country. Each of them was from one point of view an official, but each
							also regarded his office as part of his property. The country belonged
							to him and his class rather than he to the country. We occasionally find
							the quaint theory which deduced political rights from property in land.
							The freeholders were the owners of the soil and might give notice to
							quit to the rest of the population.<ref target="n1.28">[28]</ref> They
							had therefore a natural right to carry on government in their own
							interests. The ruling classes, however, were not marked off from others
							by any deep line of demarcation; they could sell their own share in the
							government to anybody who was rich enough to buy it, and there was a
							constant influx of new blood. Moreover, they did in fact improve their
							estate with very great energy, and discharged roughly, but in many ways
							efficiently, the duties which were also part of their property. The
							nobleman or even the squire was more than an individual; as head of a
							family he was a life tenant of estates which he desired to transmit to
							his descendants. He was a 'corporation sole' and had some of the spirit
							of a corporation. A college or a hospital is founded to discharge a
							particular function; its members continue perhaps to recognise their
							duty; but they resent any interference from outside as sacrilege or
							confiscation. It is for them alone to judge how they can best carry out,
							and whether they are actually carrying out, the aims of the corporate
							life. In the same way the great noble took his part in legislation,
							church preferment, the command of the army, and so forth, and fully
							admitted that he was bound in honour to play his part effectively; but
							he was equally convinced that he was subject to nothing outside of his
							sense of honour. His duties were also his rights. The na&iuml;f
							expression of this doctrine by a great borough proprietor, 'May I not do
							what I like with my own?' was to become proverbial.<ref target="n1.29"
								>[29]</ref></p>


						<p>This, finally, suggests that a doctrine of 'individualism' is implied
							throughout. The individual rights are the antecedent and the rights of
							the state a consequent or corollary. Every man has certain sacred rights
							accruing to him in virtue of 'prescription' or tradition, through his
							inherited position in the social organism. The 'rule of law' secures
							that he shall exercise them without infringing the privileges of his
							neighbour. He may moreover be compelled by the law to discharge them on
							due occasion. But, as there is no supreme body which can sufficiently
							superintend, stimulate, promote, or dismiss, the active impulse must
							come chiefly from his own sense of the fitness of things. The efficiency
							therefore depends upon his being in such a position that his duty may
							coincide with his personal interest. The political machinery can only
							work efficiently on the assumption of a spontaneous activity of the
							ruling classes, prompted by public spirit or a sense of personal
							dignity. Meanwhile, 'individualism' in a different sense was represented
							by the forces which made for progress rather than order, and to them I
							must now turn.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER II<lb/> THE INDUSTRIAL SPIRIT</head>

					<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d19">
						<head>I. The Manufactures</head>

						<p>The history of England during the eighteenth century shows a curious
							contrast between the political stagnancy and the great industrial
							activity. The great constitutional questions seemed to be settled; and
							the statesmen, occupied mainly in sharing power and place, took a very
							shortsighted view (not for the first time in history) of the great
							problems that were beginning to present themselves. The British empire
							in the East was not won by a towering ambition so much as forced upon a
							reluctant commercial company by the necessities of its position. The
							English race became dominant in America; but the political connection
							was broken off mainly because English statesmen could only regard it
							from the shopkeeping point of view. When a new world began to arise at
							the Antipodes, our rulers saw an opportunity not for planting new
							offshoots of European civilisation, but for ridding themselves of the
							social rubbish no longer accepted in America. With purblind energy, and
							eyes doggedly fixed upon the ground at their feet, the race had somehow
							pressed forwards to illustrate the old doctrine that a man never goes so
							far as when he does not know whither he is going. While thinking of
							earning an honest penny by extending the trade, our 'monied-men' were
							laying the foundation of vast structures to be developed by their
							descendants.</p>


						<p>Politicians, again, had little to do with the great 'industrial
							revolution' which marked the last half of the century. The main facts
							are now a familiar topic of economic historians; nor need I speak of
							them in detail. Though agriculture was still the main industry, and the
							landowners almost monopolised political power, an ever growing
							proportion of the people was being collected in towns; the artisans were
							congregating in large factories; and the great cloud of coal-smoke,
							which has never dwindled, was already beginning to darken our skies. The
							change corresponds to the difference between a fully developed organism
							possessed of a central brain, with an elaborate nervous system, and some
							lower form in which the vital processes are still carried on by a number
							of separate ganglia. The concentration of the population in the great
							industrial centres implied the improvement of the means of commerce; new
							organisation of industry provided with a corresponding apparatus of
							machinery; and the systematic exploitation of the stored-up forces of
							nature. Each set of changes was at once cause and effect, and each was
							carried on separately, although in relation to the other. Brindley,
							Arkwright, and Watt may be taken as typical representatives of the three
							operations. Canals, spinning-jennies, and steam-engines were changing
							the whole social order.</p>


						<p>The development of means of communication had been slow till the last
							half of the century. The roads had been little changed since they had
							been first laid down as part of the great network which bound the Roman
							empire together. Turnpike acts, sanctioning the construction of new
							roads, became numerous. Palmer's application of the stage-coaches to the
							carriage of the mails marked an epoch in 1784; and De Quincey's prose
							poem, 'The Mail-coach,' shows how the unprecedented speed of Palmer's
							coaches, then spreading the news of the first battles in the Peninsula,
							had caused them to tyrannise over the opium-eater's dreams. They were
							discharging at once a political and an industrial function. Meanwhile
							the Bridgewater canal, constructed between 1759 and 1761, was the first
							link in a great network which, by the time of the French revolution,
							connected the seaports and the great centres of industry. The great
							inventions of machinery were simultaneously enabling manufacturers to
							take advantage of the new means of communication. The cotton manufacture
							sprang up soon after 1780 with enormous rapidity. Aided by the
							application of steam (first applied to a cotton mill in 1785) it passed
							the woollen trade, the traditional favourite of legislators, and became
							the most important branch of British trade. The iron trade had made a
							corresponding start. While the steam-engine, on which Watt had made the
							first great improvement in 1765, was transforming the manufacturing
							system, and preparing the advent of the steamship and railroad, Great
							Britain had become the leading manufacturing and commercial country in
							the world. The agricultural interest was losing its pre-eminence; and
							huge towns with vast aggregations of artisan population were beginning
							to spring up with unprecedented rapidity. The change was an illustration
							upon a gigantic scale of the doctrines expounded in the <hi
								rend="italic">Wealth of Nations.</hi> Division of labour was being
							applied to things more important than pin-making, involving a
							redistribution of functions not as between men covered by the same roof,
							but between whole classes of society; between the makers of new means of
							communication and the manufacturers of every kind of material. The whole
							industrial community might be regarded as one great organism. Yet the
							organisation was formed by a multitude of independent agencies without
							any concerted plan. It was thus a vast illustration of the doctrine that
							each man by pursuing his own interests promoted the interests of the
							whole, and that government interference was simply a hindrance. The
							progress of improvement, says Adam Smith, depends upon 'the uniform,
							constant, and uninterrupted effort of every man to better his
							condition,' which often succeeds in spite of the errors of government,
							as nature often overcomes the blunders of doctors. It is, as he infers,
							'the highest impertinence and presumption for kings and ministers to
							pretend to watch over the economy of private people' by sumptuary laws
							and taxes upon imports.<ref target="n2.1">[1]</ref> To the English
							manufacturer or engineer government appeared as a necessary evil. It
							allowed the engineer to make roads and canals, after a troublesome and
							expensive process of application. It granted patents to the
							manufacturer, but the patents were a source of perpetual worry and
							litigation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer might look with complacency
							upon the development of a new branch of trade; but it was because he was
							lying in wait to come down upon it with a new tax or system of duties.</p>


						<p>The men who were the chief instruments of the pro. cess were 'self-made';
							they were the typical examples of Mr Smiles's virtue of self-help; they
							owed nothing to government or to the universities which passed for the
							organs of national culture. The leading engineers began as ordinary
							mechanics. John Metcalf (1717-1810), otherwise 'blind Jack of
							Knaresborough,' was a son of poor parents. He had lost his sight by
							smallpox at the age of six, and, in spite of his misfortune, became a
							daring rider, wrestler, soldier, and carrier, and made many roads in the
							north of England, executing surveys and constructing the works himself.
							James Brindley (1716-1772), son of a midland collier, barely able to
							read or write, working out plans by processes which he could not
							explain, and lying in bed till they took shape in his brain, a rough
							mechanic, labouring for trifling weekly wages, created the canals which
							mainly enabled Manchester and Liverpool to make an unprecedented leap in
							prosperity. The two great engineers, Thomas Telford (1757-1834), famous
							for the Caledonian canal and the Menai bridge; and John Rennie
							(1761-1821), drainer of Lincolnshire fens, and builder of Waterloo
							bridge and the Plymouth breakwater, rose from the ranks. Telford
							inherited and displayed in a different direction the energies of Eskdale
							borderers, whose achievements in the days of cattle-stealing were to be
							made famous by Scott: Rennie was the son of an East Lothian farmer. Both
							of them learned their trade by actual employment as mechanics. The
							inventors of machinery belonged mainly to the lower middle classes. Kay
							was a small manufacturer; Hargreaves a hand-loom weaver. Crompton the
							son of a small farmer; and Arkwright a country barber. Watt, son of a
							Greenock carpenter, came from the sturdy Scottish stock, ultimately of
							covenanting ancestry, from which so many eminent men have sprung.</p>


						<p>The new social class, in which such men were the leaders, held
							corresponding principles. They owed whatever success they won to their
							own right hands. They were sturdy workers, with eyes fixed upon success
							in life, and success generally of course measured by a money criterion.
							Many of them showed intellectual tastes, and took an honourable view of
							their social functions. Watt showed his ability in scientific inquiries
							outside of the purely industrial application; Josiah Wedgwood, in whose
							early days the Staffordshire potters had led a kind of gipsy life,
							settling down here and there to carry on their trade, had not only
							founded a great industry, but was a man of artistic taste, a patron of
							art, and a lover of science. Telford, the Eskdale shepherd, was a man of
							literary taste, and was especially friendly with the typical man of
							letters, Southey. Others, of course, were of a lower type. Arkwright
							combined the talents of an inventor with those of a man of business. He
							was a man, says Baines (the historian of the cotton trade), who was sure
							to come out of an enterprise with profit, whatever the result to his
							partners. He made a great fortune, and founded a county family. Others
							rose in the same direction. The Peels, for example, represented a line
							of yeomen. One Peel founded a cotton business; his son became a baronet
							and an influential member of parliament; and his grandson went to
							Oxford, and became the great leader of the Conservative partY, although
							like Walpole, he owed his power to a kind of knowledge in which his
							adopted class were generally deficient.</p>


						<p>The class which owed its growing importance to the achievements of such
							men was naturally imbued with their spirit. Its growth meant the
							development of a class which under the old order had been strictly
							subordinate to the ruling class, and naturally regarded it with a
							mingled feeling of respect and jealousy. The British merchant felt his
							superiority in business to the average country-gentleman; he got no
							direct share of the pensions and sinecures which so profoundly affected
							the working of the political machinery, and yet his highest ambition was
							to rise to be himself a member of the class, and to found a family which
							might flourish in the upper atmosphere. The industrial classes were
							inclined to favour political progress within limits. They were
							dissenters because the church was essentially part of the aristocracy;
							and they were readiest to denounce the abuses from which they did not
							profit. The agitators who supported Wilkes, solid aldermen and rich
							merchants, represented the view which was popular in London and other
							great cities. They were the backbone of the Whig party when it began to
							demand a serious reform. Their radicalism, however, was not thoroughly
							democratic. Many of them aspired to become members of the ruling class,
							and a shopkeeper does not quarrel too thoroughly with his customers. The
							politics of individuals were of course determined by accidents. Some of
							them might retain the sympathy of the class from which they sprang, and
							others might adopt an even extreme version of the opinions of the class
							to which they desired to rise. But, in any case, the divergence of
							interest between the capitalists and the labourers was already making
							itself felt. The self-made man, it is said, is generally the hardest
							master. He approves of the stringent system of competition, of which he
							is himself a product. It clearly enables the best man to win, for is he
							not himself the best man? The class which was the great seat of movement
							had naturally to meet all the prejudices which are roused by change. The
							farmers near London, as Adam Smith tells us,<ref target="n2.2">[2]</ref>
							petitioned against an extension of turnpike roads, which would enable
							more distant farmers to compete in their market. But the farmers were
							not the only prejudiced persons. All the great inventors of machinery,
							Kay and Arkwright and Watt, had constantly to struggle against the old
							workmen who were displaced by their inventions. Although, therefore, the
							class might be Whiggish, it did not share the strongest revolutionary
							passions. The genuine revolutionists were rather the men who destroyed
							the manufacturer's machines, and were learning to regard him as a
							natural enemy. The manufacturer had his own reasons for supporting
							government. Our foreign policy during the century Was in the long run
							chiefly determined by the interests of our trade, however much the trade
							might at times be hampered by ill-conceived regulations. It is
							remarkable that Adam Smith<ref target="n2.3">[3]</ref> argues that,
							although the capitalist is acuter that the country-gentleman, his
							acuteness is chiefly displayed by knowing his own interests better.
							Those interests, he thinks, do not coincide so much as the interests of
							the country-gentleman with the general interests of the country.
							Consequently the country-gentleman, though less intelligent, is more
							likely to favour a national and liberal policy. The merchant, in fact,
							was not a free-trader because he had read Adam Smith or consciously
							adopted Smith's principles, but because or in so far as particular
							restrictions interfered with him. Arthur Young complains bitterly of the
							manufacturers who supported the prohibition to export English wool, and
							so protected their own class at the expense of agriculturists. Wedgwood,
							though a good liberal and a supporter of Pitt's French treaty in 1786,
							joined in protesting against the proposal for free-trade with Ireland.
							The Irish, he thought, might rival his potteries. Thus, though as a
							matter of fact the growing class of manufacturers and merchants were
							inclined in the main to liberal principles, it was less from adhesion to
							any general doctrine than from the fact that the existing restrictions
							and prejudices generally conflicted with their plain interests.</p>


						<p>Another characteristic is remarkable. Though the growth of manufactures
							and commerce meant the growth of great towns, it did not mean the growth
							of municipal institutions. On the contrary, as I shall presently have to
							notice, the municipalities were sinking to their lowest ebb.
							Manufactures, in the first instance, spread along the streams into
							country districts: and to the great manufacturer, working for his own
							hand, his neighbours were competitors as much as allies. The great
							towns, however, which were growing up, showed the general tendencies of
							the class. They were centres not only of manufacturing but of
							intellectual progress. The population of Birmingham, containing the
							famous Soho works of Boulton and Watt, had increased between 1740 and
							1780 from 24,000 to 74,000 inhabitants. Watt's partner Boulton started
							the 'Lunar Society' at Birmingham.<ref target="n2.4">[4]</ref> Its most
							prominent member was Erasmus Darwin, famous then for poetry which is
							chiefly remembered by the parody in the <hi rend="italic"
							>Anti-Jacobin;</hi> and now more famous as the advocate of a theory of
							evolution eclipsed by the teaching of his more famous grandson, and, in
							any case, a man of remarkable intellectual power. Among those who joined
							in the proceedings was Edgeworth, who in 1768 was speculating upon
							moving carriages by steam, and Thomas Day, whose <hi rend="italic"
								>Sandford and Merton</hi> helped to spread in England the
							educational theories of Rousseau. Priestley, who settled at Birmingham
							in 1780, became a member, and was helped in his investigations by Watt's
							counsels and Wedgwood's pecuniary help. Among occasional visitors were
							Smeaton, Sir Joseph Banks, Solander, and Herschel of scientific
							celebrity; while the literary magnate, Dr Parr, who lived between
							Warwick and Birmingham, occasionally joined the circle. Wedgwood, though
							too far off to be a member, was intimate with Darwin and associated in
							various enterprises with Boulton. Wedgwood's congenial partner, Thomas
							Bentley (1731-1780), had been in business at Manchester and at
							Liverpool. He had taken part in founding the Warrington 'Academy,' the
							dissenting seminary (afterwards moved to Manchester) of which Priestley
							was tutor (1761-1767), and had lectured upon art at the academy founded
							at Liverpool in 1773. Another member of the academy was William Roscoe
							(1753-1831), whose literary taste was shown by his lives of Lorenzo de
							Medici and Leo X, and who distinguished himself by opposing the slave
							trade, then the infamy of his native town. Allied with him in this
							movement were William Rathbone and James Currie (1756-1805) the
							biographer of Burns, a friend of Darwin and an intelligent physician. At
							Manchester Thomas Perceval (1740-1804) founded the 'Literary and
							Philosophical Society, in 1780. He was a pupil of the Warrington
							Academy, which he afterwards joined on removing to Manchester, and he
							formed the scheme afterwards realised by Owens College. He was an early
							advocate of sanitary measures and factory legislation, and a man of
							scientific reputation. Other members of the society were: John Ferriar
							(1761-1815), best known by his <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of
								Sterne,</hi> but also a man of literary and scientific reputation;
							the great chemist, John Dalton (1766-1844), who contributed many papers
							to its transactions; and, for a short time, the Socialist Robert Owen,
							then a rising manufacturer. At Norwich, then important as a
							manufacturing centre, was a similar circle. William Taylor, an eminent
							Unitarian divine, who died at the Warrington Academy in 1761, had lived
							at Norwich. One of his daughters married David Martineau and became the
							mother of Harriet Martineau, who has described the Norwich of her early
							years. John Taylor, grandson of William, was father of Mrs Austin, wife
							of the jurist. He was a man of literary tastes, and his wife was known
							as the Madame Roland of Norwich. Mrs Opie (1765-1853) was daughter of
							James Alderson, a physician of Norwich, and passed most of her life
							there. William Taylor (1761-1836), another Norwich manufacturer, was
							among the earliest English students of German literature. Norwich had
							afterwards the unique distinction of being the home of a provincial
							school of artists. John Crome (1788-1821), son of a poor weaver, and
							John Sell Cotman (1782-1842) were its leaders; they formed a kind of
							provincial academy, and exhibited pictures which have been more
							appreciated since their death. At Bristol, towards the end of the
							century, were similar indications of intellectual activity. Coleridge
							and Southey found there a society ready to listen to their early
							lectures, and both admired Thomas Beddoes (1760-1808), a physician, a
							chemist, a student of German, an imitator of Darwin in poetry, and an
							assailant of Pitt in pamphlets. He had married one of Edgeworth's
							daughters. With the help and advice of Wedgwood and Watt, he founded the
							'Pneumatic Institute' at Clifton in 1798, and obtained the help of
							Humphry Davy, who there made some of his first discoveries. Davy was
							soon transported to the Royal Institution, founded at the suggestion of
							Count Rumford in 1799, which represented the growth of a popular
							interest in the scientific discoveries.</p>


						<p>The general tone of these little societies represents, of course, the
							tendency of the upper stratum of the industrial classes. In their own
							eyes they naturally represented the progressive element of society. They
							were Whigs -- for 'radicalism' was not yet invented -- but Whigs of the
							left wing; accepting the aristocratic precedency, but looking askance at
							the aristocratic prejudices. They were rationalists, too, in principle,
							but again within limits: openly avowing the doctrines which in the
							Established church had still to be sheltered by ostensible conformity to
							the traditional dogmas. Many of them professed the Unitarianism to which
							the old dissenting bodies inclined. 'Unitarianism,' said shrewd old
							Erasmus Darwin, 'is a feather-bed for a dying Christian.' But at present
							such men as Priestley and Price were only so far on the road to a
							thorough rationalism as to denounce the corruptions of Christianity, as
							they denounced abuses in politics, without anticipating a revolutionary
							change in church and state. Priestley, for example, combined
							'materialism' and 'determinism' with Christianity and a belief in
							miracles, and controverted Horsley upon one side and Paine on the
						other.</p>

						<head> II. THE AGRICULTURISTS</head>

						<p>The general spirit represented by such movements was by no means confined
							to the commercial or manufacturing classes; and its most characteristic
							embodiment is to be found in the writings of a leading agriculturist.</p>

						<p>Arthur Young,<ref target="n2.5">[5]</ref> born in 1741, was the son of a
							clergyman, who had also a small ancestral property at Bradfield, near
							Bury St. Edmunds. Accidents led to his becoming a farmer at an early
							age. He showed more zeal than discretion, and after trying three
							thousand experiments on his farm, he was glad to pay &#163;100 to
							another tenant to take his farm off his hands. This experience as a
							practical agriculturist, far from discouraging him, qualified him in his
							own opinion to speak with authority, and he became a devoted missionary
							of the gospel of agricultural improvement. The enthusiasm with which he
							admired more successful labourers in the cause, and the indignation with
							which he regards the sluggish and retrograde, are charming. His
							kindliness, his keen interest in the prosperity of all men, rich or
							poor, his ardent belief in progress, combined with his quickness of
							observation, give a charm to the writings which embody his experience.
							Tours in England and a temporary land-agency in Ireland supplied him
							with materials for books which made him known both in England and on the
							Continent. In 1779 he returned to Bradfield, where he soon afterwards
							came into possession of his paternal estate, which became his permanent
							home. In 1784 he tried to extend his propaganda by bringing out the <hi
								rend="italic">Annals of Agriculture</hi> -- a monthly publication,
							of which forty-five half-yearly volumes appeared. He had many able
							contributors and himself wrote many interesting articles, but the
							pecuniary results were mainly negative. In 1791 his circulation was only
							350 copies.<ref target="n2.6">[6]</ref> Meanwhile his acquaintance with
							the duc de Liancourt led to tours in France from 1788 to 1790. His <hi
								rend="italic">Travels in France,</hi> first published in 1792, has
							become a classic. In 1793 Young was made secretary to the Board of
							Agriculture, of which I shall speak presently. He became known in London
							society as well as in agricultural circles. He was a handsome and
							attractive man, a charming companion, and widely recognised as an
							agricultural authority. The empress of Russia sent him a snuff-box;
							'Farmer George' presented a merino ram; he was elected member of learned
							societies; he visited Burke at Beaconsfield, Pitt at Holmwood, and was a
							friend of Wilberforce and of Jeremy Bentham.</p>


						<p>Young had many domestic troubles. His marriage was not congenial; the
							loss of a tenderly loved daughter in 1797 permanently saddened him; he
							became blind, and in his later years sought comfort in religious
							meditation and in preaching to his poorer neighbours. He died 20th April
							1820. He left behind him a gigantic history of agriculture, filling ten
							folio volumes of manuscript, which, though reduced to six by an
							enthusiastic disciple after his death, have never found their way to
							publication.</p>


						<p><hi rend="italic">The Travels in France,</hi> Young's best book, owes one
							merit to the advice of a judicious friend, who remarked that the
							previous tours had suffered from the absence of the personal details
							which interest the common reader. The insertion of these makes Young's
							account of his French tours one of the most charming as well as most
							instructive books of the kind. It gives the vivid impression made upon a
							keen and kindly observer in all their freshness. He sensibly retained
							the expressions of opinion made at the time. 'I may remark at present,'
							he says,<ref target="n2.7">[7]</ref> 'that although I was totally
							mistaken in my prediction, yet, on a revision, I think I was right in
							it.' It was right, he means, upon the data then known to him, and he
							leaves the unfulfil led prediction as it was. The book is frequently
							cited in justification of the revolution, and it may be fairly urged
							that his authority is of the more weight, because he does not start from
							any sympathy with revolutionary principles. Young was in Paris when the
							oath was taken at the tennis-court; and makes his reflections upon the
							beauty of the British Constitution, and the folly of visionary reforms,
							in a spirit which might have satisfied Burke. He was therefore not
							altogether inconsistent when, after the outrages, he condemned the
							revolution, however much the facts which he describes may tend to
							explain the inevitableness of the catastrophe. At any rate, his views
							are worth notice by the indications which they give of the mental
							attituDe of a typical English observer.</p>


						<p>Young in his vivacious way struck out some of the phrases which became
							proverbial with later economists. 'Give a man the secure possession of a
							bleak rock and he will turn it into a garden. Give him a nine years'
							lease of a garden, and he will convert it into a desert.'<ref
								target="n2.8">[8]</ref> 'The magic of PROPERTY turns sand to
								gold.'<ref target="n2.9">[9]</ref> He is delighted with the comfort
							of the small proprietors near Pau, which reminds him of English
							districts still inhabited by small yeomen.<ref target="n2.10">[10]</ref>
							Passing to a less fortunate region, he explains that the prince de
							Souvise has a vast property there. The property of a grand 'seigneur' is
							sure to be a desert.<ref target="n2.11">[11]</ref> The signs which
							indicate such properties are 'wastes, <hi rend="italic">landes,</hi>
							deserts, fern, ling.' The neighbourhood of the great residences is well
							peopled -- 'with deer, wild boars, and wolves.' 'Oh,' he exclaims, 'if I
							was the legislator of France for a day, I would make such great lords
							skip again!' 'Why,' he asked, 'were the people miserable in lower
							Savoy?' 'Because,' was the reply, <hi rend="italic">'there are seigneurs
								everywhere.'</hi><ref target="n2.12">[12]</ref> Misery in Brittany
							was due 'to the execrable maxims of despotism or the equally detestable
							prejudices of a feudal nobility.'<ref target="n2.13">[13]</ref> There
							was nothing, he said, in the province but 'privileges and poverty,'<ref
								target="n2.14">[14]</ref> privileges of the nobles and poverty of
							the peasants.</p>


						<p>Young was profoundly convinced, moreover, that, as he says more than
								once<ref target="n2.15">[15]</ref> 'everything in this world depends
							on government.' He is astonished at the stupidity and ignorance of the
							provincial population, and ascribes it to the lethargy produced by
								despotism.<ref target="n2.16">[16]</ref> He contrasts it with 'the
							energetic and rapid circulation of wealth, animation, and intelligence
							of England,' where 'blacksmiths and carpenters' would discuss every
							political event. And yet he heartily admires some of the results of a
							centralised monarchy. He compares the miserable roads in Catalonia on
							the Spanish side of the frontier with the magnificent causeways and
							bridges on the French side. The difference is due to the 'one
							all-powerful cause that instigates mankind... government.'<ref
								target="n2.17">[17]</ref> He admires the noble public works, the
							canal of Languedoc, the harbours at Cherbourg and Havre, and the <hi
								rend="italic">&eacute;cole
							v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire</hi> where agriculture is taught upon
							scientific principles. He is struck by the curious contrast between
							France and England. In France the splendid roads are used by few
							travellers, and the inns are filthy pothouses; in England there are
							detestable roads, but a comparatively enormous traffic. When he wished
							to make the great nobles 'skip' he does not generally mean confiscation.
							He sees indeed One place where in 1790 the poor had seized a piece of
							waste land, declaring that the poor were the nation, and that the waste
							belonged to the nation. He declares<ref target="n2.18">[18]</ref> that
							he considers their action 'wise, rational, and philosophical,' and
							wishes that there were a law to make such conduct legal in England. But
							his more general desire is that the landowners should be compelled to do
							their duty. He complains that the nobles live in 'wretched holes' in the
							country in order to save the means of expenditure upon theatres,
							entertainments, and gambling in the towns.<ref target="n2.19">[19]</ref>
							'Banishment alone will force the French nobility to do what the English
							do for pleasure -- to reside upon and adorn their estates.'<ref
								target="n2.20">[20]</ref> He explains to a French friend that
							English agriculture has flourished 'in spite of the teeth of our
							ministers'; we have had many Colberts, but not one Sully;<ref
								target="n2.21">[21]</ref> and we should have done much better, he
							thinks, had agriculture received the same attention as commerce. This is
							the reverse of Adam Smith's remark upon the superior liberality of the
							English country-gentleman, who did not, like the manufacturers, invoke
							protection and interference. In truth, Young desired both advantages,
							the vigour of a centralised government and the energy of an independent
							aristocracy. His absence of any general theory enables him to do justice
							in detail at the cost of consistency in general theory. In France, as he
							saw, the nobility had become in the main an encumbrance, a mere dead
							weight upon the energies of the agriculturist. But he did not infer that
							large properties in land were bad in themselves; for in England he saw
							that the landowners were the really energetic and improving class. He
							naturally looked at the problem from the point of view of an intelligent
							land-agent. He is full of benevolent wishes for the labourer, and
							sympathises with the attempt to stimulate their industry and improve
							their dwellings, and denounces oppression whether in France or Ireland
							with the heartiest goodwill. But it is characteristic of the position
							that such a man -- an enthusiastic advocate of industrial progress --
							was a hearty admirer of the English landowner. He sets out upon his
							first tour, announcing that he does not write for farmers, of whom not
							one in five thousand reads anything, but for the country-gentlemen, who
							are the great improvers. Tull, who introduced turnips; Weston, who
							introduced clover; Lord Townshend and Allen, who introduced 'marling' in
							Norfolk, were all country-gentlemen, and it is from them that he expects
							improvement. He travels everywhere, delighting in their new houses and
							parks, their picture galleries, and their gardens laid out by Kent or
							'Capability Brown'; he admires scenery, climbs Skiddaw, and is rapturous
							over views of the Alps and Pyrenees; but he is thrown into a rage by the
							sight of wastes, wherever improvement is possible. What delights him is
							an estate with a fine country-house of Palladian architecture ('Gothic'
							is with him still a term of abuse),<ref target="n2.22">[22]</ref> with
							grounds well laid out and a good home-farm, where experiments are being
							tried, and surrounded by an estate in which the farm-buildings show the
							effects of the landlord's good example and judicious treatment of his
							tenantry. There was no want of such examples. He admires the marquis of
							Rockingham, at once the most honourable of statesmen and most judicious
							of improvers. He sings the praises of the duke of Portland, the earl of
							Darlington, and the duke of Northumberland. An incautious announcement
							of the death of the duke of Grafton, remembered chiefly as one of the
							victims of Junius, but known to Young for his careful experiments in
							sheep-breeding, produced a burst of tears, which, as he believed, cost
							him his eyesight. His friend, the fifth duke of Bedford (died 1802), was
							one of the greatest improvers for the South, and was succeeded by
							another friend, the famous Coke of Holkham, afterwards earl of
							Leicester, who is said to have spent half a million upon the improvement
							of his property. Young appeals to the class in which such men were
							leaders, and urges them, not against their wishes, we may suppose, and,
							no doubt, with much good sense, to take to their task in the true spirit
							of business. Nothing, he declares, is more out of place than the boast
							of some great landowners that they never raise their rents.<ref
								target="n2.23">[23]</ref> High rents produce industry. The man who
							doubles his rents benefits the country more than he benefits himself.
							Even in Ireland,<ref target="n2.24">[24]</ref> a rise of rents is one
							great cause of improvement, though the rent should not be excessive, and
							the system of middlemen is altogether detestable. One odd suggestion is
								characteristic.<ref target="n2.25">[25]</ref> He hears that wages
							are higher in London than elsewhere. Now, he says, in a trading country
							low wages are essential. He wonders, therefore, that the legislature
							does not limit the growth of London.</p>


						<p>This, we may guess, is one of the petulant utterances of early years
							which he would have disavowed or qualified upon maturer refection. But
							Young is essentially an apostle of the 'glorious spirit of
								improvement,'<ref target="n2.26">[26]</ref> which has converted
							Norfolk sheep-walks into arable fields, and was spreading throughout the
							country and even into Ireland. His hero is the energetic landowner, who
							makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before; who introduces new
							breeds of cattle and new courses of husbandry. He is so far in sympathy
							with the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,</hi> although he says of
							that book that, while he knows of 'no abler work,' he knows of none
							'fuller of poisonous errors.'<ref target="n2.27">[27]</ref> Young, that
							is, sympathised with the doctrine of the physiocrats that agriculture
							was the one source of real wealth, and took Smith to be too much on the
							side of commerce. Young, however, was as enthusiastic a free-trader as
							Smith. He naturally denounces the selfishness of the manufacturers who,
							in 1788, objected to the free export of English wool,<ref target="n2.28"
								>[28]</ref> but he also assails monopoly in general. The whole
							system, he says (on occasion of Pitt's French treaty), is rotten to the
							core. The 'vital spring and animating soul of commerce is LIBERTY.'<ref
								target="n2.29">[29]</ref> Though he talks of the balance of trade,
							he argues in the spirit of Smith or Cobden that we are benefited by the
							wealth of our customers. If we have to import more silk, we shall export
							more cloth. Young, indeed, was everything but a believer in any dogmatic
							or consistent system of Political Economy, or, as he still calls it,
							Political Arithmetic. His opinions were not of the kind which can be
							bound to any rigid formulae. After investigating the restrictions of
							rent and wages in different districts, he quietly accepts the conclusion
							that the difference is due to accident.<ref target="n2.30">[30]</ref> He
							has as yet no fear of Malthus before his eyes. He is roused to
							indignation by the pessimist theory then common, that population was
								decaying.<ref target="n2.31">[31]</ref> Everywhere he sees signs of
							progress; buildings, plantations, woods, and canals. Employment, he
							says, creates population, stimulates industry, and attracts labour from
							backward districts. The increase of numbers is an unqualified benefit.
							He has no dread of excess. In Ireland, he observes, no one is fool
							enough to deny that population is increasing, though people deny it in
							England, 'even in the most productive period of her industry and
								wealth.'<ref target="n2.32">[32]</ref> One cause of this blessing is
							the absence or the poor-law. The English poor-law is detestable to him
							for a reason which contrasts significantly with the later opinion. The
							laws were made 'in the very spirit of depopulation'; they are 'monuments
							of barbarity and mischief'; for they give to every parish an interest in
							keeping down the population. This tendency was in the eyes of the later
							economist a redeeming feature in the old system; though it had been then
							so modified as to stimulate what they took to be the curse, as young
							held it to be the blessing, of a rapid increase of population.</p>


						<p>With such views Young was a keen advocate of the process of enclosure
							which was going on with increasing rapidity. He found a colleague, who
							may be briefly noticed as a remarkable representative of the same
							movement. Sir John Sinclair (1754-1835)<ref target="n2.33">[33]</ref>
							was heir to an estate of sixty thousand acres in Caithness which
							produced only &#163;2300 a year, subject to many encumbrances. The
							region was still in a primitive state. There were no roads: agriculture
							was of the crudest kind; part of the rent was still paid in feudal
							services; the natives were too ignorant or lazy to fish, and there were
							no harbours. Trees were scarce enough to justify Johnson, and a list of
							all the trees in the country included currant-bushes.<ref target="n2.34"
								>[34]</ref> Sinclair was a pupil of the poet Logan: studied under
							Blair at Edinburgh and Millar at Glasgow; became known to Adam Smith,
							and, after a short time at Oxford, was called to the English bar.
							Sinclair was a man of enormous energy, though not of vivacious
							intellect. He belonged to the prosaic breed, which created the 'dismal
							science,' and seems to have been regarded as a stupendous bore. Bores,
							however, represent a social force not to be despised, and Sinclair was
							no exception.</p>


						<p>His father died when he was sixteen. When twenty years old he collected
							his tenants, and in one night made a road across a hill which had been
							pronounced impracticable. He was an enthusiastic admirer of Gaelic
							traditions; defended the authenticity of Ossian; supported Highland
							games, and brought Italian travellers to listen to the music of the
							bagpipes. When he presented himself to his tenants in the Highland
							costume, on the withdrawal of its prohibition, they expected him to lead
							them in a foray upon the lowlands in the name of Charles Edward. He
							afterwards raised a regiment of 'fencibles' which served in Ireland in
							1798, and, when disbanded, sent a large contingent to the Egyptian
							expedition. But he rendered more peaceful services to his country. He
							formed new farms; he enclosed several thousand acres; as head of the
							'British Wool Society,' he introduced the Cheviots or 'long sheep' to
							the North -- an improvement which is said to have doubled the rents of
							many estates; he introduced agricultural shows; he persuaded government
							in 1801 to devote the proceeds of the confiscated estates of Jacobites
							to the improvement of Scottish communications; he helped to introduce
							fisheries and even manufactures; and was a main agent in the change
							which made Caithness one of the most rapidly improving parts of the
							country. His son assures us that he took every means to obviate the
							incidental evils which have been the pretexts of denunciators of similar
							improvements. Sinclair gained a certain reputation by a <hi
								rend="italic">History of the Revenue</hi> (1785-90), and, like
							Malthus, travelled on the Continent to improve his knowledge. His first
							book finished, he began the great statistical work by which he is best
							remembered. He is said to have introduced into English the name of
							'statistics,' for the researches of which all economical writers were
							beginning to feel the necessity. He certainly did much to introduce the
							reality. Sinclair circulated a number of queries (upon 'natural
							history,' 'population,' 'productions,' and 'miscellaneous' informations)
							to every parish minister in Scotland. He surmounted various jealousies
							naturally excited, and the ultimate result was the <hi rend="italic"
								>Statistical Account of Scotland</hi> which appeared in twenty-one
							volumes between 1791 and 1799.<ref target="n2.35">[35]</ref> It gives an
							account of every parish in Scotland, and was of great value as
								supplying<ref target="n2.36">[36]</ref> basis for all social
							investigations. Sinclair bore the expense, and gave the profits to the
							'Sons of the Clergy.' In 1793 Sinclair, who had been in parliament since
							1780, made himself useful to Pitt in connection with the issue of
							exchequer bills to meet the commercial crisis. He begged in return for
							the foundation of a Board of Agriculture. He became the president and
							Arthur Young the secretary;<ref target="n2.37">[37]</ref> and the board
							represented their common aspirations. It was a rather anomalous body,
							something between a government office and such an institution as the
							Royal Society; and was supported by an annual grant of &#163;3000.
							The first aim of the board was to produce a statistical account of
							England on the plan of the Scottish account. The English clergy,
							however, were suspicious; they thought, it seems, that the collection of
							statistics meant an attack upon tithes; and Young's frequent
							denunciation of tithes as discouraging agricultural improvement suggests
							some excuse for the belief. The plan had to be dropped; a less
							thorough-going description of the counties was substituted; and a good
							many 'Views' of the agriculture of different counties were published in
							1794 and succeeding years. The board did its best to be active with
							narrow means. It circulated information, distributed medals, and brought
							agricultural improvers together. It encouraged the publication of
							Erasmus Darwin's <hi rend="italic">Phytologia</hi> (1799), and procured
							a series of lectures from Humphry Davy, afterwards published as <hi
								rend="italic">Elements of Agricultural Chemistry</hi> (1813).
							Sinclair also claims to have encouraged Macadam (1756-1836), the
							roadmaker, and Meikle, the inventor of the thrashing-machine. One great
							aim of the board was to promote enclosures. Young observes in the
							introductory paper to the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> that within
							forty years nine hundred bills had been passed affecting about a million
							acres. This included wastes, but the greater part was already cultivated
							under the 'constraint and imperfection of the open field system,' a
							relic of the 'barbarity of our ancestors.' Enclosures involved procuring
							acts of parliament -- a consequent expenditure, as Young estimates, of
							some &#163;2000 in each case;<ref target="n2.38">[38]</ref> and as
							they were generally obtained by the great landowners, there was a
							frequent neglect of the rights of the poor and of the smaller holders.
							The remedy proposed was a general enclosure act; and such an act passed
							the House of Commons in 1798, but was thrown out by the Lords. An act
							was not obtained till after the Reform Bill. Sinclair, however, obtained
							some modification of the procedure; which, it is said, facilitated the
							passage of private bills. They became more numerous in later years,
							though other causes obviously co-operated. Meanwhile, it is
							characteristic that Sinclair and Young regarded wastes as a backwoodsman
							regarded a forest. The incidental injury to poor commoners was not
							unnoticed, and became one of the topics of Cobbett's eloquence. But to
							the ardent agriculturist the existence of a bit of waste land was a
							simple proof of barbarism. Sinclair's favourite toast, we are told, was
							'May commons become uncommon' -- his one attempt at a joke. He prayed
							that Epping Forest and Finchley Common might pass under the yoke as well
							as our foreign enemies. Young is driven out of all patience by the sight
							of 'fern, ling and other trumpery' in spirit upon Salisbury Plain, which
							produce all the corn we import.<ref target="n2.39">[39]</ref> Enfield
							declares, is a 'real nuisance to the public.'<ref target="n2.40"
							>[40]</ref> We glad that the zeal for enclosure was not successful its
							aims; improvers is characteristic.</p>


						<p>It is said<ref target="n2.41">[41]</ref> that Young and Sinclair ruined
							of the Board of Agriculture by making it a kind of political club. It
							died in 1822. Sinclair obtained an appointment in Scotland, and
							continued to labour unremittingly. He carried on a correspondence with
							all manner of people, including Washington, Eldon, Catholic bishop in
							Ireland, financiers and agriculturists on the Continent, and the most
							active economists in England. He suggested a subject for a poem to
								Scott.<ref target="n2.42">[42]</ref> He wrote pamphlets about
							cash-payments, Catholic Emancipation, and the Reform Bill, always
							disagreeing with all parties, He projected four codes which were to
							summarise all human knowledge upon health, agriculture, political
							economy, and religion. <hi rend="italic">The Code of Health</hi> (4
							vols., 1807) went through six editions; <hi rend="italic">The Code of
								Agriculture</hi> appeared in 1829; but the world has not been
							enriched by the others. He died at Edinburgh on the 21st September 1835.</p>


						<p>I have dwelt so far upon Young because he is the best representative of
							that 'glorious spirit of improvement' which was transforming the whole
							social structure. Young's view of the French revolution indicates one
							marked characteristic of that spirit. He denounces the French seigneur
							because he is lethargic. He admires the English nobleman because he is
							energetic. The French noble may even deserve confiscation; but he has
							not the slightest intention of applying the same remedy in England,
							where squires and noblemen are the very source of all improvement. He
							holds that government is everything, and admires the great works of the
							French despotism: and yet he is a thorough admirer of the liberties
							enjoyed under the British Constitution, the essential nature of which
							makes similar works impossible. I need not ask whether Young's logic
							could be justified; though it would obviously require for justification
							a thoroughly 'empirical' view, or, in other words, the admission that
							different circumstances may require totally different institutions. The
							view, however, which was congenial to the prevalent spirit of
							improvement must be noted.</p>


						<p>It might be stated as a paradox that, whereas in France the most palpable
							evils arose from the excessive power of the central government, and in
							England the most palpable evils arose from the feebleness of the central
							government, the French reformers demanded more government and the
							English reformers demanded less government. Everything for the people,
							nothing by the people,' was, as Mr Morley remarks,<ref target="n2.43"
								>[43]</ref> the maxim of the French economists. The solution seems
							to be easy. In France, reformers such as Turgot and the economists were
							in favour of an enlightened despotism, because the state meant a
							centralised power which might be turned against the aristocracy. Once
							'enlightened' it would suppress the exclusive privileges of a class
							which, doing nothing in return, had become a mere burthen or dead weight
							encumbering all social development. But in England the privileged class
							was identical with the governing class. The political liberty of which
							Englishmen were rightfully proud, the 'rule of law' which made every
							official responsible to the ordinary course of justice, and the actual
							discharge of their duties by the governing order, saved it from being
							the objects of a jealous class hatred. While in France government was
							staggering under an ever-accumulating resentment against the
							aristocracy, the contemporary position in England was, on the whole, one
							of political apathy. The country, though it had lost its colonies, was
							making unprecedented progress in wealth; commerce, manufactures, and
							agriculture were being developed by the energy of individuals; and Pitt
							was beginning to apply Adam Smith's principles to finance. The cry for
							parliamentary reform died out: neither Whigs nor Tories really cared for
							it; and the 'glorious spirit of improvement' showed itself in an energy
							which had little political application. The nobility was not an incubus
							suppressing individual energy and confronted by the state, but was
							itself the state; and its individual members were often leaders in
							industrial improvement. Discontent, therefore, took in the main a
							different form. Some government was, of course, necessary, and the
							existing system was too much in harmony, even in its defects, with the
							social order to provoke any distinct revolutionary sentiment. Englishmen
							were not only satisfied with their main institutions, but regarded them
							with exaggerated complacency. But, though there was no organic disorder,
							there were plenty of abuses to be remedied. The ruling class, it seemed,
							did its duties in the main, but took unconscionable perquisites in
							return. If it 'farmed' them, it was right that it should have a
							beneficial interest in the concern; but that interest might be
							excessive. In many directions abuses were growing up which required
							remedy, though not a subversion of the system under which they had been
							generated. It was not desired -- unless by a very few theorists -- to
							make any sweeping redistribution of power; but it was eminently
							desirable to find some means of better regulating many evil practices.
							The attack upon such practices might ultimately suggest -- as, in fact,
							it did suggest -- the necessity of far more thorough-going reforms. For
							the present, however, the characteristic mark of English reformers was
							this limitation of their schemes, and a mark which is especially evident
							in Bentham and his followers. I will speak, therefore, of the many
							questions which were arising, partly for these reasons and partly
							because the Utilitarian theory was in great part moulded by the
							particular problems which they had to argue.</p>

						<head>I. Pauperism</head>


						<p>Perhaps the gravest of all the problems which were to occupy the coming
							generation was the problem of pauperism. The view taken by the
							Utilitarians was highly characteristic and important. I will try to
							indicate the general position of intelligent observers at the end of the
							century by referring to the remarkable book of Sir Frederick Morton
							Eden. Its purport is explained by the title: 'The State of the Poor; or,
							an History of the Labouring Classes of England from the Norman Conquest
							to the present period; in which are particularly considered their
							domestic economy, with respect to diet, dress, fuel, and habitation; and
							the various plans which have from time to time been proposed and adopted
							for the relief of the poor' (3 vols. 4to, 1797). Eden<ref target="n3.1"
								>[1]</ref> (1766-1809) was a man of good family and nephew of the
							first Lord Auckland, who negotiated Pitt's commercial treaty. He
							graduated as B.A. from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1787; married in 1792,
							and at his death (14th Nov. 1809) was chairman of the Globe Insurance
							Company. He wrote various pamphlets upon economical topics; contributed
							letters signed 'Philanglus' to Cobbett's <hi rend="italic"
							>Porcupine,</hi> the anti-jacobin paper of the day; and is described by
								Bentham<ref target="n3.2">[2]</ref> as a 'declared disciple' and a
							'highly valued friend.' He may be reckoned, therefore, as a Utilitarian,
							though politically he was a Conservative. He seems to have been a man of
							literary tastes as well as a man of business, and his book is a clear
							and able statement of the points at issue.</p>


						<p>Eden's attention had been drawn to the subject by the distress which
							followed the outbreak of the revolutionary war. He employed an agent who
							travelled through the country for a year with a set of queries drawn up
							after the model of those prepared by Sinclair for his <hi rend="italic"
								>Statistical Account of Scotland.</hi> He thus anticipated the
							remarkable investigation made in our own time by Mr Charles Booth. Eden
							made personal inquiries and studied the literature of the subject. He
							had a precursor in Richard Burn (1709-1785), whose <hi rend="italic"
								>History of the Poor-laws</hi> appeared in 1764, and a competitor in
							John Ruggles, whose <hi rend="italic">History of the Poor</hi> first
							appeared in Arthur Young's <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> and was
							published as a book in 1793 (second edition, 1797). Eden's work eclipsed
							Ruggles's. It has a permanent value as a collection of facts; and was a
							sign of the growing sense of the importance of accurate statistical
							research. The historian of the social condition of the people should be
							grateful to one who broke ground at a time when the difficulty of
							obtaining a sound base for social inquiries began to make itself
							generally felt. The value of the book for historical purposes lies
							beyond my sphere. His first volume, I may say, gives a history of
							legislation from the earliest period; and contains also a valuable
							account of the voluminous literature which had grown up during the two
							preceding centuries. The other two summarise the reports which he had
							received. I will only say enough to indicate certain critical points.
							Eden's book unfortunately was to mark, not a solution of the difficulty
							but, the emergence of a series of problems which were to increase in
							complexity and ominous significance through the next generation.</p>


						<p>The general history of the poor-law is sufficiently familiar.<ref
								target="n3.3">[3]</ref> The mediaeval statutes take us to a period
							at which the labourer was still regarded as a serf; and a man who had
							left his village was treated like a fugitive slave. A long series of
							statutes regulated the treatment of the 'vagabond.' The vagabond,
							however, had become differentiated from the pauper. The decay of the
							ancient order of society and its corresponding institutions had led to a
							new set of problems; and the famous statute of Elizabeth (1601) had laid
							down the main lines of the system which is still in operation.</p>


						<p>When the labourer was regarded as in a servile condition, he might be
							supported from the motives which lead an owner to support his slaves, or
							by the charitable energies organised by ecclesiastical institutions. He
							had now ceased to be a serf, and the institutions which helped the poor
							man or maintained the beggar were wrecked. The Elizabethan statute gave
							him, therefore, a legal claim to be supported, and, on the other hand,
							directed that he should be made to work for his living. The assumption
							is still that every man is a member of a little social circle. He
							belongs to his parish, and it is his fellow-parishioners who are bound
							to support him. So long as this corresponded to facts, the system could
							work satisfactorily. With the spread of commerce, and the growth of a
							less settled population, difficulties necessarily arose. The pauper and
							the vagabond represent a kind of social extravasation; the 'masterless
							man' who has strayed from his legitimate place or has become a
							superfluity in his own circle. The vagabond could be fogged, sent to
							prison, or if necessary hanged, but it was more difficult to settle what
							to do with a man who was not a criminal, but simply a product in excess
							of demand. All manner of solutions had been suggested by philanthropists
							and partly adopted by the legislature. One point which especially
							concerns us is the awkwardness or absence of an appropriate
							administrative machinery.</p>


						<p>The parish, the unit on which the pauper had claims, meant the persons
							upon whom the poor-rate was assessed. These were mainly farmers and
							small tradesmen who formed the rather vague body called the vestry.
							'Overseers' were appointed by the ratepayers themselves; they were not
							paid, and the disagreeable office was taken in turn for short periods.
							The most obvious motive with the average ratepayer was of course to keep
							down the rates and to get the burthen of the poor as much as possible
							out of his own parish. Each parish had at least an interest in economy.
							But the economical interest also produced flagrant evils.</p>


						<p>In the first place, there was the war between parishes. The law of
							settlement -- which was to decide to what parish a pauper belonged --
							originated in an act of 1662. Eden observes that the short clause in
							this short act had brought more profit to the lawyers than 'any other
							point in the English jurisprudence.'<ref target="n3.4">[4]</ref> It is
							said that the expense of such a litigation before the act of 1834
							averaged from &#163;300,000 to &#163;350,000 a year.<ref
								target="n3.5">[5]</ref> Each parish naturally endeavoured to shift
							the burthen upon its neighbours; and was protected by laws which enabled
							it to resist the immigration of labourers or actually to expel them when
							likely to become chargeable. This law is denounced by Adam Smith<ref
								target="n3.6">[6]</ref> as a 'violation of natural liberty and
							justice.' It was often harder, he declared, for a poor man to cross the
							artificial boundaries of his parish than to cross a mountain ridge or an
							arm of the sea. There was, he declared, hardly a poor man in England
							over forty who had not been at some time 'cruelly oppressed' by the
							working of this law. Eden thinks that Smith had exaggerated the evil:
							but a law which operated by preventing a free circulation of labour, and
							made it hard for a poor man to seek the best price for his only saleable
							commodity, was, so far, opposed to the fundamental principles common to
							Smith and Eden. The law, too, might be used oppressively by the
							niggardly and narrow minded. The overseer, as Burn complained,<ref
								target="n3.7">[7]</ref> was often a petty tyrant: his aim was to
							depopulate his parish; to prevent the poor from obtaining a settlement;
							to make the workhouse a terror by placing it under the management of a
							bully; and by all kinds of chicanery to keep down the rates at whatever
							cost to the comfort and morality of the poor. This explains the view
							taken by Arthur Young, and generally accepted at the period, that the
							poor-law meant depopulation. Workhouses had been started in the
							seventeenth century<ref target="n3.8">[8]</ref> with the amiable
							intention of providing the industrious poor with work. Children might be
							trained to industry and the pauper might be made self-supporting.
							Workhouses were expected that is, to provide not only work but wages.
							Defoe, in his <hi rend="italic">Giving Alms no Charity,</hi> pointed out
							the obvious objections to the workhouse considered as an institution
							capable of competing with the ordinary industries. Workhouses, in fact,
							soon ceased to be profitable. Their value, however, in supplying a test
							for destitution was recognised; and by an act of 1722, parishes were
							allowed to set up workhouses, separately or in combination, and to
							strike off the lists of the poor those who refused to enter them. This
							was the germ of the later 'workhouse test.'<ref target="n3.9">[9]</ref>
							When grievances arose, the invariable plan, as Nicholls observes,<ref
								target="n3.10">[10]</ref> was to increase the power of the justices.
							Their discretion was regarded 'as a certain cure for every shortcoming
							of the law and every evil arising out of it.' The great report of 1834
							traces this tendency<ref target="n3.11">[11]</ref> to a clause in an act
							passed in the reign of William III, which was intended to allow the
							justices to check the extravagance of parish officers. They were
							empowered to strike off persons improperly relieved. This incidental
							regulation, widened by subsequent interpretations, allowed the
							magistrates to order relief, and thereby introduced an incredible amount
							of demoralisation.</p>


						<p>The course was natural enough, and indeed apparently inevitable. The
							justices of the peace represented the only authority which could be
							called in to regulate abuses arising from the incapacity and narrow
							local interests of the multitudinous vestries. The schemes of
							improvement generally involved some plan for a larger area. If a hundred
							or a county were taken for the unit, the devices which depopulated a
							parish would no longer be applicable.<ref target="n3.12">[12]</ref> The
							only scheme actually carried was embodied in 'Gilbert's act' (1782),
							obtained by Thomas Gilbert (1720-1798), an agent of the duke of
							Bridgewater, and an active advocate of poor-law reform in the House of
							Commons. This scheme was intended as a temporary expedient during the
							distress caused by the American War; and a larger and more permanent
							scheme which it was to introduce failed to become law. It enabled
							parishes to combine if they chose to provide common workhouses, and to
							appoint 'guardians.' The justices, as usual, received more powers in
							order to suppress the harsh dealing of the old parochial authorities.
							The guardians, it was assumed, could always find 'work,' and they were
							to relieve the able-bodied without applying the workhouse test. The act,
							readily adopted, thus became a landmark in the growth of laxity.<ref
								target="n3.13">[13]</ref></p>


						<p>At the end of the century a rapid development of pauperism had taken
							place. The expense, as Eden had to complain, had doubled in twenty
							years. This took place simultaneously with the great development of
							manufactures. It is not perhaps surprising, though it may be melancholy,
							that increase of wealth shall be accompanied by increase of pauperism.
							Where there are many rich men, there will be a better field for thieves
							and beggars. A life of dependence becomes easier though it need not
							necessarily be adopted. Whatever may have been the relation of the two
							phenomena, the social revolution made the old social arrangements more
							inadequate. great aggregations of workmen were formed in towns, which
							were still only villages in a legal sense. Fluctuations of trade, due to
							war or speculation, brought distress to the improvident; and the old
							assumption that every man had a proper place in a small circle, where
							his neighbours knew all about him, was further than ever from being
							verified. One painful result was already beginning to show itself.
							Neglected children in great towns had already excited compassion. Thomas
							Coram (1668?-1751) had been shocked by the sight of dying children
							exposed in the streets of London, and succeeded in establishing the
							Foundling Hospital (founded in 1742). In 1762, Jonas Hanway (1712-1786)
							obtained a law for boarding out children born within the bills of
							mortality. The demand for children's labour, produced by the factories,
							seemed naturally enough to offer a better chance for extending such
							charities. Unfortunately among the people who took advantage of it were
							parish officials, eager to get children off their hands, and
							manufacturers concerned only to make money out of childish labour. Hence
							arose the shameful system for which remedies (as I shall have to notice)
							had to be sought in a later generation.</p>


						<p>Meanwhile the outbreak of the revolutionary war had made the question
							urgent. When Manchester trade suffered, as Eden tells us in his reports,
							many workmen enlisted in the army, and left their children to be
							supported by the parish. Bad seasons followed in 1794 and 1795, and
							there was great distress in the agricultural districts. The governing
							classes became alarmed. In December 1795 Whitbread introduced a bill
							providing that the justices of the peace should fix a minimum rate of
							wages. Upon a motion for the second reading, Pitt made the famous speech
							(12th December) including the often-quoted statement that when a man had
							a family, relief should be 'a matter of right and honour, instead of a
							ground of opprobrium and contempt.'<ref target="n3.14">[14]</ref> Pitt
							had in the same speech shown his reading of Adam Smith by dwelling upon
							the general objections to state interference with wages, and had argued
							that more was to be gained by removing the restrictions upon the free
							movement of labour. He undertook to produce a comprehensive measure; and
							an elaborate bill of 130 clauses was prepared in 1796.<ref
								target="n3.15">[15]</ref> The rates were to be used to supplement
							inadequate wages; 'schools of industry' were to be formed for the
							support of superabundant children; loans might be made to the poor for
							the purchase of a cow;<ref target="n3.16">[16]</ref> and the possession
							of property was not to disqualify for the receiving relief. In short,
							the bill seems to have been<ref target="n3.17">[17]</ref> model of
							misapplied benevolence. The details were keenly criticised by Bentham,
							and the bill never came to the birth. Other topics were pressing enough
							at this time to account for the failure of a measure so vast in its
							scope. Meanwhile something had to be done. On 6th May 1795 the Berkshire
							magistrates had passed certain resolutions called from their place of
							meeting, the 'Speenhamland Act of Parliament.' They provided that the
							rate of wages of a labourer should be increased in proportion to the
							price of corn and to the number of his family -- a rule which, as Eden
							observes, tended to discourage economy of food in times of scarcity.
							They also sanctioned the disastrous principle of paying part of the
							wages out of rates. An act passed in 1796 repealed the old restrictions
							upon out-door relief; and thus, during the hard times that were to
							follow, the poor-laws were adapted to produce the state of things in
							which, as Cobbett says (in 1821) 'every labourer who has children is now
							regularly and constantly a pauper.'<ref target="n3.18">[18]</ref> The
							result represents a curious compromise. The landowners, whether from
							benevolence or fear of revolution, desired to meet the terrible distress
							of the times. Unfortunately their spasmodic interference was guided by
							no fixed principles, and acted upon a class of institutions not
							organised upon any definite system. The general effect seems to have
							been that the ratepayers, no longer allowed to 'depopulate,' sought to
							turn the compulsory stream of charity partly into their own pockets. If
							they were forced to support paupers, they could contrive to save the
							payment of wages. They could use the labour of the rate-supported pauper
							instead of employing independent workmen. The evils thus produced led
							before long to most important discussions.<ref target="n3.19">[19]</ref>
							The ordinary view of the poor-law was inverted. The prominent evil was
							the reckless increase of a degraded population instead of the
							restriction of population. Eden's own view is sufficiently indicative of
							the light in which the facts showed themselves to intelligent
							economists. As a disciple of Adam Smith, he accepts the rather vague
							doctrine of his master about the 'balance' between labour and capital.
							If labour exceeds capital, he says, the labourer must starve 'in spite
							of all political regulations.'<ref target="n3.20">[20]</ref> He
							therefore looks with disfavour upon the whole poor-law system. It is too
							deeply rooted to be abolished, but he thinks that the amount to be
							raised should not be permitted to exceed the sum levied on an average of
							previous years. The only certain result of Pitt's measure would be a
							vast expenditure upon a doubtful experiment: and one main purpose of his
							publication was to point out the objections to the plan. He desires what
							seemed at that time to be almost hopeless, a national system of
							education; but his main doctrine is the wisdom of reliance upon
							individual effort. The truth of the maxim <hi rend="italic">'pas trop
								gouverner,'</hi> he says,<ref target="n3.21">[21]</ref> has never
							been better illustrated than by the contrast between friendly societies
							and the poor-laws. Friendly societies had been known, though they were
							still on a humble scale, from the beginning of the century, and had
							tended to diminish pauperism in spite of the poor-laws. Eden gives many
							accounts of them. They seem to have suggested a scheme proposed by the
							worthy Francis Maseres<ref target="n3.21">[21]</ref> (1731-1824) in 1772
							for the establishment of life annuities. A bill to give effect to this
							scheme passed the House of Commons in 1773 with the support of Burke and
							Savile, but was thrown out in the House of Lords. In 1786 John Acland
							(died 1796), a Devonshire clergyman and justice of the peace, proposed a
							scheme for uniting the whole nation into a kind of friendly society for
							the support of the poor when out of work and in old age. It was
							criticised by John Howlett (1731-1804), a clergyman who wrote much upon
							the poor-laws. He attributes the growth of pauperism to the rise of
							prices, and calculates that out of an increased expenditure of
							&#163;700,000, &#163;219,000 had been raised by the rich, and
							the remainder 'squeezed out of the flesh, blood, and bones of the poor.'
							An act for establishing Acland's crude scheme failed next year in
								parliament.<ref target="n3.22">[22]</ref> The merit of the
							societies, according to Eden, was their tendency to stimulate self-help;
							and how to preserve that merit, while making them compulsory, was a
							difficult problem. I have said enough to mark a critical and
							characteristic change of opinion. One source of evil pointed out by
							contemporaries had been the absence of any central power which could
							regulate and systematise the action of the petty local bodies. The very
							possibility of such organisation, however, seems to have been simply
							inconceivable. When the local bodies became lavish instead of
							over-frugal, the one remedy suggested was to abolish the system
							altogether.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="2" id="d24">
						<head>II. THE POLICE</head>


						<p>The system of 'self-government' showed its weak side in this direction.
							It meant that an important function was intrusted to small bodies, quite
							incompetent of acting upon general principles, and perfectly capable of
							petty jobbing, when unrestrained by any effective supervision. In
							another direction the same tendency was even more strikingly
							illustrated. Municipal institutions were almost at their lowest point of
							decay. Manchester and Birmingham were two of the largest and most
							rapidly growing towns. By the end of the century Manchester had a
							population of 90,000 and Birmingham of 70,000. Both were ruled, as far
							as they were ruled, by the remnants of old manorial institutions.
								Aikin<ref target="n3.23">[23]</ref> observes that 'Manchester (in
							1795) remains an open town; destitute (probably to its advantage) of a
							corporation, and unrepresented in parliament.' It was governed by a
							'borough-reeve' and two constables elected annually at the court-leet.
							William Hutton, the quaint historian of Birmingham, tells us in 1783
							that the town was still legally a village, with a high and low bailiff,
							a 'high and low taster,' two 'affeerers,' and two 'leather-sealers.' In
							1752 it had been provided with a 'court of requests', for the recovery
							of small debts, and in 1769 with a body of commissioners to provide for
							lighting the town. This was the system by which, with some
							modifications, Birmingham was governed till after the Reform Bill.<ref
								target="n3.24">[24]</ref> Hutton boasts(25*) that no town was better
							governed or had fewer officers. 'A town without a charter,' he says, 'is
							a town without a shackle.' Perhaps he changed his opinions when his
							warehouses were burnt in 1791, and the town was at the mercy of the mob
							till a regiment of 'light horse' could be called in. Aikin and Hutton,
							however, reflect the general opinion at a time when the town
							corporations had become close and corrupt bodies, and were chiefly
							'shackles' upon the energy of active members of the community. I must
							leave the explanation of this decay to historians. I will only observe
							that what would need explanation would seem to be rather the absence
							than the presence of corruption. The English borough was not stimulated
							by any pressure from a central government; nor was it a semi-independent
							body in which every citizen had the strongest motives for combining to
							support its independence against neighbouring towns or invading nobles.
							The lower classes were ignorant, and probably would be rather hostile
							than favourable to any such modest interference with dirt and disorder
							as would commend themselves to the officials. Naturally, power was left
							to the little cliques of prosperous tradesmen, who formed close
							corporations, and spent the revenues upon feasts or squandered them by
							corrupt practices. Here, as in the poor-law, the insufficiency of the
							administrative body suggests to contemporaries, not its reform, but its
							superfluity.</p>


						<p>The most striking account of some of the natural results is in
								Colquhoun's<ref target="n3.26">[26]</ref>
							<hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis.</hi> Patrick
							Colquhoun (1745-1820), an energetic Scot, was born at Dumbarton in 1745,
							had been in business at Glasgow, where he was provost in 1782 and 1783,
							and in 1789 settled in London. In 1792 he obtained through Dundas an
							appointment to one of the new police magistracies created by an act of
							that year. He took an active part in many schemes of social reform; and
							his book gives an account of the investigations by which his schemes
							were suggested and justified. It must be said, however, parenthetically,
							that his statistics scarcely challenge implicit confidence. Like
							Sinclair and Eden, he saw the importance of obtaining facts and figures,
							but his statements are suspiciously precise and elaborate.<ref
								target="n3.27">[27]</ref> The broad facts are clear enough.</p>


						<p>London was, he says, three miles broad and twenty-five in circumference.
							The population in 1801 was 641,000. It was the largest town, and
							apparently the most chaotic collection of dwellings in the civilised
							world. There were, as Colquhoun asserts<ref target="n3.28">[28]</ref> in
							an often-quoted passage, 20,000 people in it, who got up every morning
							without knowing how they would get through the day. There were 5000
							public-houses, and 50,000 women supported, wholly or partly, by
							prostitution. The revenues raised by crime amounted, as he calculates,
							to an annual sum of &#163;2,000,000. There were whole classes of
							professional thieves, more or less organised in gangs, which acted in
							support of each other. There were gangs on the river, who boarded ships
							at night, or lay in wait round the warehouses. The government dockyards
							were systematically plundered, and the same article often sold four
							times over to the officials. The absence of patrols gave ample chance to
							the highwaymen then peculiar to England. Their careers, commemorated in
							the <hi rend="italic">Newgate Calendar,</hi> had a certain flavour of
							Robin Hood romance, and their ranks were recruited from dissipated
							apprentices and tradesmen in difficulty. The fields round London were so
							constantly plundered that the rent was materially lowered. Half the
							hackney coachmen, he says,<ref target="n3.29">[29]</ref> were in league
							with thieves. The number of receiving houses for stolen goods had
							increased in twenty years from 300 to 3000.<ref target="n3.30"
							>[30]</ref> Coining was a flourishing trade, and according to Colquhoun
							employed several thousand persons.<ref target="n3.31">[31]</ref>
							Gambling had taken a fresh start about 1777 and 1778;<ref target="n3.32"
								>[32]</ref> and the keepers of tables had always money enough at
							command to make convictions almost impossible. French refugees at the
							revolution had introduced <hi rend="italic">rouge et noir;</hi> and
							Colquhoun estimates the sums yearly lost in gambling-houses at over
							&#163;7,000,000. The gamblers might perhaps appeal not only to the
							practices of their betters in the days of Fox, but to the public
							lotteries. Colquhoun had various correspondents, who do not venture to
							propose the abolition of a system which sanctioned the practice, but who
							hope to diminish the facility for supplementary betting on the results
							of the official drawing.</p>


						<p>The war had tended to increase the number of loose and desperate
							marauders who swarmed in the vast labyrinth of London streets. When we
							consider the nature of the police by which these evils were to be
							checked, and the criminal law which they administered, the wonder is
							less that there were sometimes desperate riots (as in 1780) than that
							London should have been ever able to resist a mob. Colquhoun, though a
							patriotic Briton, has to admit that the French despots had at last
							created an efficient police.<ref target="n3.33">[33]</ref> The emperor,
							Joseph II, he says, inquired for an Austrian criminal supposed to have
							escaped to Paris. You will find him, replied the head of the French
							police, at No. 93 of such a street in Vienna on the second-floor room
							looking upon such a church; and there he was. In England a criminal
							could hide himself in a herd of his like, occasionally disturbed by the
							inroad of a 'Bow Street runner,' the emissary of the 'trading justices,'
							formerly represented by the two Fieldings. An act of 1792 created seven
							new offices, to one of which Colquhoun had been appointed. They had one
							hundred and eighty-nine paid officers under them.<ref target="n3.34"
								>[34]</ref> There were also about one thousand constables. These
							were small tradesmen or artisans upon whom the duty was imposed without
							remuneration for a year by their parish, that is, by one of seventy
							independent bodies. A 'Tyburn ticket,' given in reward for obtaining the
							conviction of a criminal exempted a man from the discharge of such
							offices, and could be bought for from &#163;15 to &#163;25.
							There were also two thousand watchmen receiving from 8 1/2d. up to 2s. a
							night. These were the true successors of Dogberry; often infirm or aged
							persons appointed to keep them out of the workhouse. The management of
							this distracted force thus depended upon a miscellaneous set of bodies;
							the paid magistrates, the officials of the city, the justices of the
							peace for Middlesex, and the seventy independent parishes.</p>


						<p>The law was as defective as the administration. Colqulhoun represents the
							philanthropic impulse of the day, and notices<ref target="n3.35"
							>[35]</ref> that in 1787 Joseph II had abolished capital punishment. His
							chief authority for more merciful methods is Beccaria; and it is worth
							remarking, for reasons which will appear hereafter, that he does not in
							this connection refer to Bentham, although he speaks
								enthusiastically<ref target="n3.36">[36]</ref> of Bentham's model
							prison, the Panopticon. Colquhoun shows how strangely the severity of
							the law was combined with its extreme capriciousness. He quotes
								Bacon<ref target="n3.37">[37]</ref> for the statement that the law
							was a 'heterogeneous mass concocted too often on the spur of the
							moment,' and gives sufficient proofs of its truth. He desires, for
							example, a law to punish receivers of stolen goods, and says that there
							were excellent laws in existence. Unfortunately one law applied
							exclusively to the case of pewter-pots, and another exclusively to the
							precious metals; neither could be used as against receivers of horses or
							bank notes.<ref target="n3.38">[38]</ref> So a man indicted under an act
							against stealing from ships on navigable rivers escaped, because the
							barge from which he stole happened to be aground. Gangs could afford to
							corrupt witnesses or to pay knavish lawyers skilled in applying these
							vagaries of legislation. Juries also disliked convicting when the
							penalty for coining six-pence was the same as the penalty for killing a
							mother. It followed, as he shows by statistics, that half the persons
							committed for trial escaped by petty chicanery or corruption, or the
							reluctance of juries to convict for capital offences. Only about
							one-fifth of the capital sentences were executed; and many were pardoned
							on condition of enlisting to improve the morals of the army. The
							criminals, who were neither hanged nor allowed to escape, were sent to
							prisons, which were schools of vice. After the independence of the
							American colonies, the system of transportation to Australia had begun
							(in 1787); but the expense was enormous, and prisoners were huddled
							together in the hulks at Woolwich and Portsmouth, which had been used as
							a temporary expedient. Thence they were constantly discharged, to return
							to their old practices. A man, says Colquhoun,<ref target="n3.39"
							>[39]</ref> would deserve a statue who should carry out a plan for
							helping discharged prisoners. To meet these evils, Colquhoun proposes
							various remedies, such as a metropolitan police, a public prosecutor, or
							even a codification or revision of the Criminal Code, which he sees is
							likely to be delayed. He also suggested, in a pamphlet of 1799, a kind
							of charity organisation society to prevent the waste of funds. Many
							other pamphlets of similar tendencies show his active zeal in promoting
							various reforms. Colquhoun was in close correspondence with Bentham from
							the year 1798,<ref target="n3.40">[40]</ref> and Bentham helped him by
							drawing the Thames Police Act, passed in 1800, to give effect to some of
							the suggestions in the <hi rend="italic">Treatise.</hi><ref
								target="n3.41">[41]</ref></p>


						<p>Another set of abuses has a special connection with Bentham's activity.
							Bentham had been led in 1778 to attend to the prison question by reading
							Howard's book on <hi rend="italic">Prisons;</hi> and he refers to the
							'venerable friend who had lived an apostle and died a martyr.'<ref
								target="n3.42">[42]</ref> The career of John Howard (1726-1790) is
							familiar. The son of a London tradesman, he had inherited an estate in
							Bedfordshire. There he erected model cottages and village schools; and,
							on becoming sheriff of the county in 1773, was led to attend to abuses
							in the prisons. Two acts of parliament were passed in 1774 to remedy
							some of the evils exposed, and he pursued the inquiry at home and
							abroad. His results are given in his <hi rend="italic">State of the
								Prisons in England and Wales</hi> (1779, fourth edition, 1792), and
							his <hi rend="italic">Account of the Principal Lazarettos in Europe</hi>
							(1789). The prisoners, he says, had little food, sometimes a penny loaf
							a day, and sometimes nothing; no water, no fresh air, no sewers, and no
							bedding. The stench was appalling, and gaol fever killed more than died
							on the gallows. Debtors and felons, men, women and children, were
							huddled together; often with lunatics, who were shown by the gaolers for
							money. 'Garnish' was extorted; the gaolers kept drinking-taps; gambling
							flourished: and prisoners were often cruelly ironed, and kept for long
							periods before trial. At Hull the assizes had only been held once in
							seven years, and afterwards once in three. It is a comfort to find that
							the whole number of prisoners in England and Wales amounted, in 1780, to
							about 4400, 1078 of whom were debtors, 798 felons, and 917 petty
							offenders. An act passed in 1779 provided for the erection of two
							penitentiaries. Howard was to be a supervisor. The failure to carry out
							this act led, as we shall see, to one of Bentham's most characteristic
							undertakings. One peculiarity must be noted. Howard found prisons on the
							continent where the treatment was bad and torture still occasionally
							practised; but he nowhere found things so bad as in England. In Holland
							the prisons were so neat and clean as to make it difficult to believe
							that they were prisons: and they were used as models for the legislation
							of 1779. One cause of this unenviable distinction of English prisons had
							been indicated by an earlier investigation. General Oglethorpe
							(1696-1785) had been started in his philanthropic career by obtaining a
							committee of the House of Commons in 1729 to inquire into the state of
							the gaols. The foundation of the colony of Georgia as an outlet for the
							population was one result of the inquiry. It led, in the first place,
							however, to a trial of persons accused of atrocious cruelties at the
							Fleet prison.<ref target="n3.43">[43]</ref> The trial was abortive. It
							appeared in the course of the proceedings that the Fleet prison was a
							'freehold.' A patent for rebuilding it had been granted to Sir Jeremy
							Whichcot under Charles II, and had been sold to one Higgins, who resold
							it to other persons for &#163;5000. The proprietors made their
							investment pay by cruel ill-treatment of the prisoners, oppressing the
							poor and letting off parts of the prison to dealers in drink. This was
							the general plan in the prisons examined by Howard, and helps to account
							for the gross abuses. It is one more application of the general system.
							As the patron was owner of a living, and the officer of his commission,
							the keeper of a prison was owner of his establishment. The paralysis of
							administration which prevailed throughout the country made it natural to
							farm out paupers to the master of a workhouse, and prisoners to the
							proprietor of a gaol. The state of prisoners may be inferred not only
							from Howard's authentic record but from the fictions of Fielding,
							Smollett and Goldsmith; and the last echoes of the same complaints may
							be found in <hi rend="italic">Pickwick</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Little
								Dorrit.</hi> The Marshalsea described in the last was also a
							proprietary concern. We shall hereafter see how Bentham proposed to
							treat the evils revealed by Oglethorpe and Howard,</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="3" id="d25">
						<head>III. EDUCATION</head>

						<p>Another topic treated by Colquhoun marks the initial stage of
							controversies which were soon to grow warm. Colquhoun boasts of the
							number of charities for which London was already conspicuous. A growing
							facility for forming associations of all kinds, political, religious,
							scientific, and charitable, is an obvious characteristic of modern
							progress. Where in earlier times a college or a hospital had to be
							endowed by a founder and invested by charter with corporate personality,
							it is now necessary only to call a meeting, form a committee, and appeal
							for subscriptions. Societies of various kinds had sprung up during the
							century. Artists, men of science, agriculturists, and men of literary
							tastes, had founded innumerable academies and 'philosophical
							institutes.' The great London hospitals, dependent upon voluntary
							subscriptions, had been founded during the first half of the century.
							Colquhoun counts the annual revenue of various charitable institutions
							at &#163;445,000, besides which the endowments produced
							&#163;150,000, and the poor-rates &#163;255,000.<ref
								target="n3.44">[44]</ref> Among these a considerable number were
							intended to promote education. Here, as in some other cases, it seems
							that people at the end of the century were often taking up an impulse
							given a century before. So the Society for promoting Christian
							Knowledge, founded in 1699, and the Society for the Propagation of the
							Gospel, founded in 1701, were supplemented by the Church Missionary
							Society and the Religious Tract Society, both founded in 1799. The
							societies for the reformation of manners, prevalent at the end of the
							seventeenth century, were taken as a model by Wilberforce and his
							friends at the end of the eighteenth.<ref target="n3.45">[45]</ref> In
							the same way, the first attempts at providing a general education for
							the poor had been made by Archbishop Tenison, who founded a parochial
							school about 1680 in order 'to check the growth of popery.' Charity
							schools became common during the early part of the eighteenth century
							and received various endowments. They were attacked as tending to teach
							the poor too much -- a very needless alarm -- and also by free thinkers,
							such as Mandeville, as intended outworks of the established church. This
							last objection was a foretaste of the bitter religious controversies
							which were to accompany the growth of an educational system. Colquhoun
							says that there were 62 endowed schools in London, from Christ's
							Hospital downwards, educating about 5000 children; 237 parish schools
							with about 9000 children, and 3730 'private schools.' The teaching was,
							of course, very imperfect, and in a report of a committee of the House
							of Commons in 1818, it is calculated that about half the children in a
							large district were entirely uneducated. There was, of course, nothing
							in England deserving the name of a system in educational more than in
							any other matters. The grammar schools throughout the country provided
							more or less for the classes which could not aspire to the public
							schools and universities. About a third of the boys at Christ's Hospital
							were, as Coleridge tells us, sons of clergymen.<ref target="n3.46"
							>[46]</ref> The children of the poor were either not educated, or picked
							up their letters at some charity school or such a country dame's school
							as is described by Shenstone. A curious proof, however, of rising
							interest in the question is given by the Sunday Schools movement at the
							end of the century. Robert Raikes (1735-1811), a printer in Gloucester
							and proprietor of a newspaper, joined with a clergyman to set up a
							school in 1780 at a total cost of 1s. 6d. a week. Within three or four
							years the plan was taken up everywhere, and the worthy Raikes, whose
							newspaper had spread the news, found himself revered as a great pioneer
							of philanthropy. Wesley took up the scheme warmly; bishops condescended
							to approve; the king and queen were interested, and within three or four
							years the number of learners was reckoned at two or three hundred
							thousand. A Sunday School Association was formed in 1785 with well known
							men of business at its head. Queen Charlotte's friend, Mrs Trimmer
							(1741-1810), took up the work near London, and Hannah More (1745-1833)
							in Somersetshire. Hannah More gives a strange account of the utter
							absence of any civilising agencies in the district around Cheddar where
							she and her sisters laboured. She was accused of 'methodism' and a
							leaning to Jacobinism, although her views were of the most moderate
							kind. She wished the poor to be able to read their Bibles and to be
							qualified for domestic duties, but not to write or to be enabled to read
							Tom Paine or be encouraged to rise above their position. The literary
							light of the Whigs, Dr Parr (1747-1825), showed his liberality by
							arguing that the poor ought to be taught, but admitted that the
							enterprise had its limits. The 'Deity Himself had fixed a great gulph
							between them and the poor.' A scanty instruction given on Sundays alone
							was not calculated to facilitate the passage of that gulf. By the end of
							the century, however, signs of a more systematic movement were showing
							themselves. Bell and Lancaster, of whom I shall have to speak, were
							rival claimants for the honour of initiating a new departure in
							education. The controversy which afterwards raged between the supporters
							of the two systems marked a complete revolution of opinion. Meanwhile,
							although the need of schools was beginning to be felt, the appliances
							for education in England were a striking instance of the general
							inefficiency in every department which needed combined action. In
							Scotland the system of parish schools was one obvious cause of the
							success of so many of the Scotsmen which excited the jealousy of
							southern competitors. Even in Ireland there appears to have been a more
							efficient set of schools. And yet, one remark must be suggested. There
							is probably no period in English history at which a greater number of
							poor men have risen to distinction. The greatest beyond comparison of
							self-taught poets was Burns (1759-1796). The political writer who was at
							the time producing the most marked effect was Thomas Paine (1737-1809),
							son of a small tradesman. His successor in influence was William Cobbett
							(1762-1835), son of an agricultural labourer, and one of the pithiest of
							all English writers. William Gifford (1756-1826), son of a small
							tradesman in Devonshire, was already known as a satirist and was to lead
							Conservatives as editor of the <hi rend="italic">The Quarterly
							Review.</hi> John Dalton (1766-1842), son of a poor weaver, was one of
							the most distinguished men of science. Porson (1759-1808), the greatest
							Greek scholar of his time, was son of a Norfolk parish clerk, though
							sagacious patrons had sent him to Eton in his fifteenth year. The Oxford
							professor of Arabic, Joseph White (1746-1814), was Son of a poor weaver
							in the country and a man of reputation for learning, although now
							remembered only for a rather disreputable literary squabble. Robert owen
							and Joseph Lancaster, both sprung from the ranks, were leaders in social
							movements. I have already spoken of such men as Watt, Telford, and
							Rennie; and smaller names might be added in literature, science, and
							art. The individualist virtue of 'self-help' was not confined to
							successful moneymaking or to the wealthier classes. One cause of the
							literary excellence of Burns, Paine, and Cobbett may be that, when
							literature was less centralised, a writer was less tempted to desert his
							natural dialect. I mention the fact, however, merely to suggest that,
							whatever were then the difficulties of getting such schooling as is now
							common, an energetic lad even in the most neglected regions might force
							his way to the front.</p>

						<head> IV. THE SLAVE-TRADE</head>

						<p>I have thus noticed the most conspicuous of the contemporary problems
							which, as we shall see, provided the main tasks of Bentham and his
							followers. One other topic must be mentioned as in more ways than one
							characteristic of the spirit of the time. The parliamentary attack upon
							the slave-trade began just before the outbreak of the revolution. It is
							generally described as an almost sudden awakening of the national
							conscience. That it appealed to that faculty is undeniable, and,
							moreover, it is at least a remarkable instance of legislative action
							upon purely moral grounds. It is true that in this case the conscience
							was the less impeded because it was roused chiefly by the sins of men's
							neighbours. The slave-trading class was a comparative excrescence. Their
							trade could be attacked without such widespread interference with the
							social order as was implied, for example, in remedying the grievances of
							paupers or of children in factories. The conflict with morality, again,
							was so plain as to need no demonstration. It seems to be a questionable
							logic which assumes the merit of a reformer to be in proportion to the
							flagrancy of the evil assailed. The more obvious the case, surely the
							less the virtue needed in the assailant. However this may be, no one can
							deny the moral excellence of such men as Wilberforce and Clarkson, nor
							the real change in the moral standard implied by the success of their
							agitation. But another question remains, which is indicated by a later
							controversy. The followers of Wilberforce and of Clarkson were jealous
							of each other. Each party tried to claim the chief merit for its hero.
							Each was, I think, unjust to the other. The underlying motive was the
							desire to obtain credit for the 'Evangelicals' or their rivals as the
							originators of a great movement. Without touching the personal details
							it is necessary to say something of the general sentiments implied. In
							his history of the agitation,<ref target="n3.47">[47]</ref> Clarkson
							gives a quaint chart, showing how the impulse spread from various
							centres till it converged upon a single area, and his facts are
							significant.</p>


						<p>That a great change had taken place is undeniable. Protestant England had
							bargained with Catholic Spain in the middle of the century for the right
							of supplying slaves to America, while at the peace of 1814 English
							statesmen were endeavouring to secure a combination of all civilised
							powers against the trade. Smollett, in 1748, makes the fortune of his
							hero, Roderick Random, by placing him as mate of a slave-ship under the
							ideal sailor, Bowling. About the same time John Newton (1725-1807),
							afterwards the venerated teacher of Cowper and the Evangelicals, was in
							command of a slaver, and enjoying 'sweeter and more frequent hours of
							divine communion' than he had elsewhere known. He had no scruples,
							though he had the grace to pray 'to be fixed in a more humane calling.'
							In later years he gave the benefit of his experience to the
								abolitionists.<ref target="n3.48">[48]</ref> A new sentiment,
							however, was already showing itself. Clarkson collects various
							instances. Southern's Oroonoco, founded on a story by Mrs Behn, and
							Steele's story of Inkle and Yarico in an early <hi rend="italic"
								>Spectator,</hi> Pope's poor Indian in the <hi rend="italic">Essay
								on Man,</hi> and allusions by Thomson, Shenstone, and Savage, show
							that poets and novelists could occasionally turn the theme to account.
							Hutcheson, the moralist, incidentally condemns slavery; and divines such
							as bishops Hayter and Warburton took the same view in sermons before the
							Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge. Johnson, 'last of
							the Tories' though he was, had a righteous hatred for the system.<ref
								target="n3.49">[49]</ref> He toasted the next insurrection of
							negroes in the West Indies, and asked why we always heard the 'loudest
							yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes'? Thomas Day (1748-1789),
							as an ardent follower of Rousseau, wrote the <hi rend="italic">Dying
								Negro</hi> in 1773, and, in the same spirit, denounced the
							inconsistencies of slave-holding champions of American liberty.</p>


						<p>Such isolated utterances showed a spreading sentiment. The honour of the
							first victory in the practical application must be given to Granville
								Sharp<ref target="n3.50">[50]</ref> (1735-1813), one of the most
							charming and, in the best sense, 'Quixotic' of men. In 1772 his
							exertions had led to the famous decision by Lord Mansfield in the case
							of the negro Somerset.<ref target="n3.51">[51]</ref> Sharp in 1787
							became chairman of the committee formed to attack the slave-trade by
							collecting the evidence of which Wilberforce made use in parliament. The
							committee was chiefly composed of Quakers; as indeed, Quakers are pretty
							sure to be found in every philanthropic movement of the period. I must
							leave the explanation to the historian of religious movements; but the
							fact is characteristic. The Quakers had taken the lead in America. The
							Quaker was both practical and a mystic. His principles put him outside
							of the ordinary political interests, and of the military world. He
							directed his activities to helping the poor, the prisoner, and the
							oppressed. Among the Quakers of the eighteenth century were John Woolman
							(1720-1772), a writer beloved by the congenial Charles Lamb and Antoine
							Benezet (1713-1784), born in France, and son of a French refugee who
							settled in Philadelphia. When Clarkson wrote the prize essay upon the
							slave-trade (1785), which started his career, it was from Benezet's
							writings that he obtained his information. By their influence the
							Pennsylvanian Quakers were gradually led to pronounce against
								slavery;<ref target="n3.52">[52]</ref> and the first anti-slavery
							society was founded in Philadelphia in 1775, the year in which the
							skirmish at Lexington began the war of independence. That suggests
							another influence. The Rationalists of the eighteenth century were never
							tired of praising the Quakers. The Quakers were, by their essential
							principles, in favour of absolute toleration, and their attitude towards
							dogma was not dissimilar. 'Rationalisation' and 'Spiritualisation, are
							in some directions similar. The general spread of philanthropic
							sentiment, which found its formula in the <hi rend="italic">Rights of
								Man,</hi> fell in with the Quaker hatred of war and slavery.
							Voltaire heartily admires Barclay, the Quaker apologist. It is,
							therefore, not surprising to find the names of the deists, Franklin and
							Paine, associated with Quakers in this movement. Franklin was an early
							president of the new association, and Paine wrote an article to support
							the early agitation.<ref target="n3.53">[53]</ref> Paine himself was a
							Quaker by birth, who had dropped his early creed while retaining a
							respect for its adherents. When the agitation began it was in fact
							generally approved by all except the slave-traders. Sound Whig divines,
							Watson and Paley and Parr; Unitarians such as Priestley and Gilbert
							Wakefield and William Smith; and the great methodist, John Wesley, were
							united on this point. Fox and Burke and Pitt rivalled each other in
							condemning the system. The actual delay was caused partly by the
							strength of the commercial interests in parliament, and partly by the
							growth of the anti-Jacobin sentiment.</p>


						<p>The attempt to monopolise the credit of the movement by any particular
							sect is absurd. Wilberforce and his friends might fairly claim the glory
							of having been worthy representatives of a new spirit of philanthropy.
							but most certainly they did not create or originate it. The general
							growth of that spirit throughout the century must be explained, so far
							as 'explanation' is possible, by wider causes. It was, as I must venture
							to assume, a product of complex social changes which were bringing
							classes and nations into closer contact, binding them together by new
							ties, and breaking up the old institutions which had been formed under
							obsolete conditions. The true moving forces were the same whether these
							representatives announced the new gospel of the 'rights of man'; or
							appealed to the traditional rights of Englishmen; or rallied supporters
							of the old order so far as it still provided the most efficient
							machinery for the purpose. The revival of religion under Wesley and the
							Evangelicals meant the direction of the stream into one channel. The
							paralytic condition of the Church of England disqualified it for
							appropriating the new energy. The men who directed the movements were
							mainly stimulated by moral indignation at the gross abuses, and the
							indolence of the established priesthood naturally gave them an
							anti-sacerdotal turn. They simply accepted the old Protestant tradition.
							They took no interest in the intellectual questions involved.
							Rationalism, according to them, meant simply an attack upon the
							traditional sanctions of morality. and it scarcely occurred to them to
							ask for any philosophical foundation of their creed. Wilberforce's book,
								<hi rend="italic">A Practical View,</hi> attained an immense
							popularity, and is characteristic of the position. Wilberforce turns
							over the infidel to be confuted by Paley, whom he takes to be a
							conclusive reasoner. For himself he is content to show what needed
							little proof, that the so-called Christians of the day could act as if
							they had never heard of the New Testament. The Evangelical movement had
							in short no distinct relation to speculative movements. It took the old
							tradition for granted, and it need not here be further considered.</p>


						<p>One other remark is suggested by the agitation against the slave-trade.
							It set a precedent for agitation of a kind afterwards familiar. The
							committee appealed to the country, and got up petitions. Sound Tories
							complained of them in the early slave-trade debates, as attempts to
							dictate to parliament by democratic methods. Political agitators had
							formed associations, and found a convenient instrument in the 'county
							meetings,' which seems to have possessed a kind of indefinite legal
								character.<ref target="n3.54">[54]</ref> Such associations of course
							depend for the great part of their influence upon the press. The
							circulation of literature was one great object. Paine's <hi
								rend="italic">Rights of Man</hi> was distributed by the
							revolutionary party, and Hannah More wrote popular tracts to persuade
							the poor that they had no grievances. It is said that two millions of
							her little tracts, 'Village Politics by Will Chip,' the 'Shepherd of
							Salisbury Plain,' and so forth were circulated. The demand, indeed,
							showed rather the eagerness of the rich to get them read than the
							eagerness of the poor to read them. They failed to destroy Paine's
							influence, but they were successful enough to lead to the foundation of
							the Religious Tract Society. The attempt to influence the poor by cheap
							literature shows that these opinions were beginning to demand
							consideration. Cobbett and many others were soon to use the new weapon.
							Meanwhile the newspapers circulated among the higher. ranks were passing
							through a new phase, which must be noted. The great newspapers were
							gaining power. The <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle</hi> was started
							by Woodfall in 1769, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Post</hi> and <hi
								rend="italic">Morning Herald</hi> by Dudley Bate in 1772 and 1780,
							and the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> by Walter in 1788. The modern
							editor was to appear during the war. Stoddart and Barnes of the <hi
								rend="italic">Times,</hi> Perry and Black of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Morning Chronicle,</hi> were to become important politically. The
							revolutionary period marks the transition from the old-fashioned
							newspaper, carried on by a publisher and an author, to the modern
							newspaper, which represents a kind of separate organism, elaborately
							'differentiated' and worked by a whole army of co-operating editors,
							correspondents, reporters, and contributors. Finally, one remark may be
							made. The literary class in England was not generally opposed to the
							governing classes. The tone of Johnson's whole circle was conservative.
							In fact, since Harley's time, government had felt the need of support in
							the press, and politicians on both sides had their regular organs. The
							opposition might at any time become the government; and their supporters
							in the press, poor men who were only too dependent, had no motive for
							going beyond the doctrines of their principals. They might be bought by
							opponents, or they might be faithful to a patron. They did not form a
							band of outcasts, whose hand would be against every one. The libel law
							was severe enough, but there had been no licensing system since the
							early days of William and Mary. A man could publish what he chose at his
							own peril. When the current of popular feeling was anti-revolutionary,
							government might obtain a conviction, but even in the worst times there
							was a chance that juries might be restive. Editors had at times to go to
							prison, but even then the paper was not suppressed. Cobbett, for
							example, continued to publish his <hi rend="italic">Registrar</hi>
							during an imprisonment of two years (1810-12). Editors had very serious
							anxieties, but they could express with freedom any opinion which had the
							support of a party. English liberty was so far a reality that a very
							free discussion of the political problems of the day was permitted and
							practised. The English author, therefore, as such, had not the
							bitterness of a French man of letters, unless, indeed, he had the
							misfortune to be an uncompromising revolutionist.</p>

						<head> V. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION</head>


						<p>The English society which I have endeavoured to characterise was now to
							be thrown into the vortex of the revolutionary wars. The surpassing
							dramatic interest of the French Revolution has tended to obscure our
							perception of the continuity of even English history. It has been easy
							to ascribe to the contagion of French example political movements which
							were already beginning in England and which were modified rather than
							materially altered by our share in the great European convulsion. The
							impression made upon Englishmen by the French Revolution is, however, in
							the highest degree characteristic. The most vehement sympathies and
							antipathies were aroused, and showed at least what principles were
							congenial to the various English parties. To praise or blame the
							revolution, as if it could be called simply good or bad, is for the
							historian as absurd as to praise or blame an earthquake. It was simply
							inevitable under the conditions. We may, of course, take it as an
							essential stage in a social evolution, which if described as progress is
							therefore to be blessed, or if as degeneration may provoke lamentation.
							We may, if we please, ask whether superior statesmanship might have
							attained the good results without the violent catastrophes, or whether a
							wise and good man who could appreciate the real position would have
							approved or condemned the actual policy. But to answer such problems
							with any confidence would imply a claim to a quasi-omniscience.
							Partisans at the time, however, answered them without hesitation, and
							saw in the Revolution the dawn of a new era of reason and justice, or
							the outburst of the fires of hell. Their view is at any rate indicative
							of their own position. The extreme opinions need no exposition. They are
							represented by the controversy between Burke and Paine. The general
							doctrine of the 'Rights of Men' -- that all men are by nature free and
							equal -- covered at least the doctrine that the inequality and despotism
							of the existing order was hateful, and people with a taste for abstract
							principles accepted this short cut to political wisdom. The 'minor'
							premise being obviously true, they took the major for granted. To Burke,
							who idealised the traditional element in the British Constitution, and
							so attached an excessive importance to historical continuity, the new
							doctrine seemed to imply the breaking up of the very foundations of
							order and the pulverisation of society. Burke and Paine both assumed too
							easily that the dogmas which they defended expressed the real and
							ultimate beliefs, and that the belief was the cause, not the
							consequence, of the political condition. Without touching upon the logic
							of either position, I may notice how the problem presented itself to the
							average English politician whose position implied acceptance of
							traditional compromises and who yet prided himself on possessing the
							liberties which were now being claimed by Frenchmen. The Whig could
							heartily sympathise with the French Revolution so long as it appeared to
							be an attempt to assimilate British principles. When Fox hailed the fall
							of the Bastille as the greatest and best event that had ever happened,
							he was expressing a generous enthusiasm shared by all the ardent and
							enlightened youth of the time. The French, it seemed, were abolishing an
							arbitrary despotism and adopting the principles of Magna Charta and the
							'Habeas Corpus' Act. Difficulties, however, already suggested themselves
							to the true Whig. Would the French, as Young asked just after the same
							event, 'copy the constitution of England, freed from its faults, or
							attempt, from theory, to frame something absolutely speculative'?<ref
								target="n3.55">[55]</ref> On that issue depended the future of the
							country. It was soon decided in the sense opposed to young's wishes. The
							reign of terror alienated the average Whig. But though the argument from
							atrocities is the popular one, the opposition was really more
							fundamental. Burke put the case, savagely and coarsely enough, in his
							'Letter to a noble Lord.' How would the duke of Bedford like to be
							treated as the revolutionists were treating the nobility in France? The
							duke might be a sincere lover of political liberty, but he certainly
							would not be prepared to approve the confiscation of his estates. The
							aristocratic Whigs, dependent for their whole property and for every
							privilege which they prized upon ancient tradition and prescription,
							could not really be in favour of sweeping away the whole complex social
							structure, levelling Windsor Castle as Burke put it in his famous
							metaphor, and making a 'Bedford level' of the whole country. The Whigs
							had to disavow any approval of the Jacobins; Mackintosh, who had given
							his answer to Burke's diatribes, met Burke himself on friendly terms
							(9th July 1797), and in 1800 took an opportunity of public recantation.
							He only expressed the natural awakening of the genuine Whig to the
							aspects of the case which he had hitherto ignored. The effect upon the
							middle-class Whigs is, however, more to my purpose. it may be
							illustrated by the history of John Horne Tooke<ref target="n3.56"
							>[56]</ref> (1736 1812), who at this time represented what may be called
							the home-bred British radicalism. He was the son of a London tradesman,
							who had distinguished himself by establishing, and afterwards declining
							to enforce, certain legal rights against Frederick Prince of Wales. The
							prince recognised the tradesman's generosity by making his antagonist
							purveyor to his household. A debt of some thousand pounds was thus run
							up before the prince's death which was never discharged. Possibly the
							son's hostility to the royal family was edged by this circumstance. John
							Horne, forced to take orders in order to hold a living, soon showed
							himself to have been intended by nature for the law. He took up the
							cause of Wilkes in the early part of the reign; defended him
							energetically in later years; and in 1769 helped to start the 'Society
							for supporting the Bill of Rights.' He then attacked Wilkes, who, as he
							maintained, misapplied for his own private use the funds subscribed for
							public purposes to this society; and set up a rival 'Constitutional
							Society.' in 1775, as spokesman of this body, he denounced the 'king's
							troops' for 'inhumanly murdering' their fellow-subjects at Lexington for
							the sole crime of 'preferring death to slavery.' He was imprisoned for
							the libel, and thus became a martyr to the cause. When the country
							associations were formed in 1780 to protest against the abuses revealed
							by the war, Horne became a member of the 'Society for Constitutional
							Information,' of which Major Cartwright -- afterwards the revered, but
							rather tiresome, patriarch of the Radicals -- was called the 'father.'
							Horne Tooke (as he was now named), by these and other exhibitions of
							boundless pugnacity, became a leader among the middle-class Whigs, who
							found their main support among London citizens, such as Beckford,
							Troutbeck and Oliver; supported them in his later days; and after the
							American war, preferred Pitt, as an advocate of parliamentary reform, to
							Fox, the favourite of the aristocratic Whigs. He denounced the Fox
							coalition ministry, and in later years opposed Fox at Westminster. The
							'Society for Constitutional Information', was still extant in the
							revolutionary period, and Tooke, a bluff, jovial companion, who had by
							this time got rid of his clerical character, often took the chair at the
							taverns where they met to talk sound politics over their port. The
							revolution infused new spirit into politics. In March 1791<ref
								target="n3.57">[57]</ref> Tooke's society passed a vote of thanks to
							Paine for the first part of his <hi rend="italic">Rights of Man.</hi>
							Next year Thomas Hardy, a radical shoemaker, started a 'Corresponding
							Society.' Others sprang up throughout the country, especially in the
							manufacturing towns.<ref target="n3.58">[58]</ref> These societies took
							Paine for their oracle, and circulated his writings as their manifesto.
							They communicated occasionally with Horne Tooke's society, which more or
							less sympathised with them. The Whigs of the upper sphere started the
							'Friends of the People' in April 1792, in order to direct the discontent
							into safer channels. Grey, Sheridan and Erskine were members; Fox
							sympathised but declined to join; Mackintosh was secretary; and Sir
							Philip Francis drew up the opening address, citing the authority of Pitt
							and Blackstone, and declaring that the society wished 'not to change but
							to restore.'<ref target="n3.59">[59]</ref> It remonstrated cautiously
							with the other societies, and only excited their distrust. Grey, as its
							representative, made a motion for parliamentary reform which was
							rejected (May 1793) by two hundred and eighty-two to forty-one. Later
							motions in May 1797 and April 1800 showed that, for the present,
							parliamentary reform was out of the question. Meanwhile the English
							Jacobins got up a 'convention' which met at Edinburgh at the end of
							1793. The very name was alarming: the leaders were tried and
							transported; the cruelty of the sentences and the severity of the
							judges, especially Braxfield, shocked such men as Parr and Jeffrey, and
							unsuccessful appeals for mercy were made in parliament. The Habeas
							Corpus Act was suspended in 1794: Horne Tooke and Hardy were both
							arrested and tried for high treason in November. An English jury
							fortunately showed itself less subservient than the Scottish; the judge
							was scrupulously fair: and both Hardy and Horne Tooke were acquitted.
							The societies, however, though they were encouraged for a time, were
							attacked by severe measures passed by Pitt in 1795. The 'Friends of the
							People' ceased to exist. The seizure of the committee of the
							Corresponding Societies in 1798 put an end to their activity. A report
							presented to parliament in 1799<ref target="n3.60">[60]</ref> declares
							that the societies had gone to dangerous lengths: they had communicated
							with the French revolutionists and with the 'United Irishmen' (founded
							1791); and societies of 'United Englishmen' and 'United Scotsmen' had
							had some concern in the mutinies of the fleet in 1797 and in the Irish
							rebellion of 1798. Place says, probably with truth, that the danger was
							much exaggerated: but in any case, an act for the suppression of the
							Corresponding Societies was passed in 1799, and put an end to the
							movement.</p>


						<p>This summary is significant of the state of opinion, The genuine
							old-fashioned Whig dreaded revolution, and guarded himself carefully
							against any appearance of complicity. Jacobinism, on the other hand, was
							always an exotic. Such men as the leading Nonconformists Priestley and
							Price were familiar with the speculative movement on the continent, and
							sympathised with the enlightenment. Young men of genius, like Wordsworth
							and Coleridge, imbibed the same doctrines more or less thoroughly, and
							took Godwin for their English representative. The same creed was
							accepted by the artisans in the growing towns, from whom the
							Corresponding Societies drew their recruits. But the revolutionary
							sentiment was not so widely spread as its adherents hoped or its enemies
							feared. The Birmingham mob of 1791 acted, with a certain unconscious
							humour, on the side of church and king. They had perhaps an instinctive
							perception that it was an advantage to plunder on the side of the
							constable. In fact, however, the general feeling in all classes was
							anti-Jacobin. Place, an excellent witness, himself a member of the
							Corresponding Societies, declares that the repressive measures were
							generally popular even among the workmen.<ref target="n3.61">[61]</ref>
							They were certainly not penetrated with revolutionary fervour. Had it
							been otherwise, the repressive measures, severe as they were, would have
							stimulated rather than suppressed the societies, and, instead of
							silencing the revolutionists, have provoked a rising.</p>


						<p>At the early period the Jacobin and the home-bred Radical might combine
							against government. A manifesto of the Corresponding Societies begins by
							declaring that 'all men are by nature free and equal and independent of
							each other,' and argues also that these are the 'original principles of
							English government.'<ref target="n3.62">[62]</ref> Magna Charta is an
							early expression of the Declaration of Rights, and thus pure reason
							confirms British tradition. The adoption of a common platform, however,
							covered a profound difference of sentiment. Horne Tooke represents the
							old type of reformer. He was fully resolved not to be carried away by
							the enthusiasm of his allies. 'My companions in a stage,' he said to
							Cartwright, 'may be going to Windsor: I will go with them to Hounslow.
							But there I will get out: no further will I go, by God!'<ref
								target="n3.63">[63]</ref> When Sheridan supported a vote of sympathy
							for the French revolutionists, Tooke insisted upon adding a rider
							declaring the content of Englishmen with their own constitution.<ref
								target="n3.64">[64]</ref> He offended some of his allies by
							asserting that the 'main timbers' of the constitution were sound though
							the dry-rot had got into the superstructure. He maintained, according to
								Godwin,<ref target="n3.65">[65]</ref> that the best of all
							governments had been that of England under George I. Though Cartwright
							said at the trial that Horne Tooke was taken to 'have no religion
							whatever,' he was, according to Stephens, 'a great stickler for the
							church of England': and stood up for the House of Lords as well as the
							church on grounds of utility.<ref target="n3.66">[66]</ref> He always
							ridiculed Paine and the doctrine of abstract rights,<ref target="n3.67"
								>[67]</ref> and told Cartwright that though all men had an equal
							right to a share of property, they had not a right to an equal share.
							Horne Tooke's Radicalism (I use the word by anticipation) was that of
							the sturdy tradesman. He opposed the government because he hated war,
							taxation and sinecures. He argued against universal suffrage with equal
							pertinacity. A comfortable old gentleman, with a good cellar of Madeira,
							and proud of his wall-fruit in a well-tilled garden, had no desire to
							see George III at the guillotine, and still less to see a mob supreme in
							Lombard Street or banknotes superseded by assignats. He might be jealous
							of the great nobles, but he dreaded mob-rule. He could denounce abuses,
							but he could not desire anarchy. He is said to have retorted upon some
							one who had boasted that English courts of justice were open to all
							classes: 'So is the London tavern -- to all who can pay.'<ref
								target="n3.68">[68]</ref> That is in the spirit of Bentham; and yet
							Bentham complains that Horne Tooke's disciple, Burdett, believed in the
							common law, and revered the authority of Coke.<ref target="n3.69"
							>[69]</ref> In brief, the creed of Horne Tooke meant 'liberty' founded
							upon tradition. I shall presently notice the consistency of this with
							what may be called his philosophy. Meanwhile it was only natural that
							radicals of this variety should retire from active politics, having
							sufficiently burnt their fingers by flirtation with the more
							thorough-going party. How they came to life again will appear hereafter.
							Horne Tooke himself took warning from his narrow escape. He stayed
							quietly in his house at Wimbledon.<ref target="n3.70">[70]</ref> There
							he divided his time between his books and his garden, and received his
							friends to Sunday dinners. Bentham, Mackintosh, Coleridge, and Godwin
							were among his visitors. Coleridge calls him a 'keen iron man,' and
							reports that he made a butt of Godwin as he had done of Paine.<ref
								target="n3.71">[71]</ref> Porson and Boswell encountered him in
							drinking matches and were both left under the table.<ref target="n3.72"
								>[72]</ref> The house was thus a small centre of intellectual life,
							though the symposia were not altogether such as became philosophers.
							Horne Tooke was a keen and shrewd disputant, well able to impress weaker
							natures. His neighbour, Sir Francis Burdett, became his political
							disciple, and in later years was accepted as the radical leader. Tooke
							died at Wimbledon 18th March 1812.</p>

						<head> VI. INDIVIDUALISM</head>


						<p>The general tendencies which I have so far tried to indicate will have to
							be frequently noticed in the course of the following rages. One point
							may be emphasised before proceeding: a main characteristic of the whole
							social and political order is what is now called its 'individualism.'
							That phrase is generally supposed to convey some censure. It may
							connote, however, some of the most essential virtues that a race can
							possess. Energy, self-reliance, and independence, a strong conviction
							that a man's fate should depend upon his own character and conduct, are
							qualities without which no nation can be great. They are the conditions
							of its vital power. They were manifested in a high degree by the
							Englishmen of the eighteenth century. How far they were due to the
							inherited qualities of the race, to the political or social history, or
							to external circumstances, I need not ask. They were the qualities which
							had especially impressed foreign observers. The fierce, proud,
							intractable Briton was elbowing his way to a high place in the world,
							and showing a vigour not always amiable, but destined to bring him
							successfully through tremendous struggles. In the earlier part of the
							century, Voltaire and French philosophers admired English freedom of
							thought and free speech, even when it led to eccentricity and brutality
							of manners, and to barbarism in matters of taste. Englishmen, conscious
							and proud of their 'liberty,' were the models of all who desired liberty
							for themselves. Liberty, as they understood it, involved, among other
							things, an assault upon the old restrictive system, which at every turn
							hampered the rising industrial energy. This is the sense in which
							'individualism,' or the gospel according to Adam Smith <hi rend="italic"
								>laissez faire,</hi> and so forth has been specially denounced in
							recent times. Without asking at present how far such attacks are
							justifiable, I must be content to assume that the old restrictive system
							was in its actual form mischievous, guided by entirely false theories,
							and the great barrier to the development of industry. The same spirit
							appeared in purely political questions. 'Liberty,' as is often remarked,
							may be interpreted in two ways, not necessarily consistent with each
							other. it means sometimes simply the diminution of the sphere of law and
							the power of legislators, or, again, the transference to subjects of the
							power of legislating, and, therefore, not less control, but control by
							self made laws alone. The Englishman, who was in presence of no
							centralised administrative power, who regarded the Government rather as
							receiving Rower from individuals than as delegating the Rower of a
							central body, took liberty mainly in the sense of restricting law.
							Government in general was a nuisance, though a necessity; and properly
							employed only in mediating between conflicting interests, and
							restraining the violence of individuals forced into contact by outward
							circumstances. When he demanded that a greater share of influence should
							be given to the people, he always took for granted that their power
							would be used to diminish the activity of the sovereign power; that
							there would be less government and therefore less jobbery, less
							interference with free speech and free action, and smaller perquisites
							to be bestowed in return for the necessary services. The people would
							use their authority to tie the hands of the rulers, and limit them
							strictly to their proper and narrow functions.</p>


						<p>The absence, again, of the idea of a state in any other sense implies
							another tendency. The 'idea' was not required, Englishmen were concerned
							rather with details than with first principles. Satisfied, in a general
							way, with their constitution, they did not want to be bothered with
							theories. Abstract and absolute doctrines of right, when imported from
							France, fell flat upon the average Englishman. He was eager enough to
							discuss the utility of this or that part of the machinery, but without
							inquiring into first principles of mechanism. The argument from
							'utility' deals with concrete facts, and presupposes an acceptance of
							some common criterion of the useful. The constant discussion of
							political matters in parliament and the press implied a tacit acceptance
							on all hands of constitutional methods. Practical men, asking whether
							this or that policy shall be adopted in view of actual events, no more
							want to go back to right reason and 'laws of nature' than a surveyor to
							investigate the nature of geometrical demonstration. Very important
							questions were raised as to the rights of the press, for example, or the
							system of representation. But everybody agreed that the representative
							system and freedom of speech were good things; and argued the immediate
							questions of fact. The order, only established by experience and
							tradition, was accepted, subject to criticism of detail, and men turned
							impatiently from abstract argument, and left the inquiry into 'social
							contracts' to philosophers, that is, to silly people in libraries.
							Politics were properly a matter of business, to be discussed in a
							business-like spirit. In this sense, 'individualism' is congenial to
							'empiricism,' because it starts from facts and particular interests, and
							resents the intrusion of first principles. The characteristic
							individualism, again, suggests one other remark. Individual energy and
							sense of responsibility are good as even extreme socialists may admit --
							if they do not exclude a sense of duties to others. It may be a question
							how far the stimulation of individual enterprise and the vigorous spirit
							of industrial competition really led to a disregard of the interests of
							the weaker. But it would be a complete misunderstanding of the time if
							we inferred that it meant a decline of humane feeling. Undoubtedly great
							evils had grown up, and some continued to grow which were tolerated by
							the indifference, or even stimulated by the selfish aims, of the
							dominant classes. But, in the first place, many of the most active
							prophets of the individualist spirit were acting, and acting sincerely,
							in the name of humanity. They were attacking a system which they held,
							and to a great extent, I believe, held rightly, to be especially
							injurious to the weakest classes. Possibly they expected too much from
							the simple removal of restrictions; but certainly they denounced the
							restrictions as unjust to all, not simply as hindrances to the wealth of
							the rich. Adam Smith's position is intelligible: it was, he thought, a
							proof of a providential order that each man, by helping himself,
							unintentionally helped his neighbours. The moral sense based upon
							sympathy was therefore not opposed to, but justified, the economic
							principles that each man should first attend to his own interest. The
							unintentional co-operation would thus become conscious and compatible
							with the established order. And, in the next place, so far from there
							being a want of humane feeling, the most marked characteristic of the
							eighteenth century was precisely the growth of humanity. In the next
							generation, the eighteenth century came to be denounced as cold,
							heartless, faithless, and so forth. The established mode of writing
							history is partly responsible for this perversion. Men speak as though
							some great man, who first called attention to an evil, was a
							supernatural being who had suddenly dropped into the world from another
							sphere. His condemnation of evil is therefore taken to be a proof that
							the time must be evil. Any century is bad if we assume all the good men
							to he exceptions. But the great man is really also the product of his
							time. He is the mouthpiece of its prevailing sentiments, and only the
							first to see clearly what many are beginning to perceive obscurely. The
							emergence of the prophet is a proof of the growing demand of his hearers
							for sound teaching. Because he is in advance of men generally, he sees
							existing abuses more clearly, and we take his evidence against his
							contemporaries as conclusive. But the fact that they listened shows how
							widely the same sensibility to evil was already diffused. In fact, as I
							think, the humane spirit of the eighteenth century, due to the vast
							variety of causes which we call social progress or evolution not to the
							teaching of any individual -- was permeating the whole civilised world,
							and showed itself in the philosophic movement as well as in the teaching
							of the religious leaders, who took the philosophers to be their enemies.
							I have briefly noticed the various philanthropic movements which were
							characteristic of the period. Some of them may indicate the growth of
							new evils; others, that evils which had once been regarded with
							indifference were now attracting attention and exciting indignation. But
							even the growth of new evils does not show general indifference so much
							as the incapacity of the existing system to deal with new conditions. It
							may, I think, be safely said that a growing philanthropy was
							characteristic of the whole period, and in particular animated the
							Utilitarian movement, as I shall have to show in detail. Modern writers
							have often spoken of the Wesleyan propaganda and the contemporary
							'evangelical revival' as the most important movements of the time. They
							are apt to speak, in conformity with the view just described, as though
							Wesley or some of his contemporaries had originated or created the
							better spirit. Without asking what was good or bad in some aspects of
							these movements, I fully believe that Wesley was essentially a moral
							reformer, and that he deserves corresponding respect. But instead of
							holding that his contemporaries were bad people, awakened by a stimulus
							from without, I hold that the movement, so far as really indicating
							moral improvement, must be set down to the credit of the century itself.
							It was one manifestation of a general progress, of which Bentham was
							another outcome. Though Bentham might have thought Wesley a fanatic or
							perhaps a hypocrite, and Wesley would certainly have considered that
							Bentham's heart was much in need of a change, they were really allies as
							much as antagonists, and both mark a great and beneficial change.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER IV<lb/> PHILOSOPHY</head>

					<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d31">
						<head>I. John Horne Tooke</head>

						<p>I have so far dwelt upon the social and political environment of the
							early Utilitarian movement; and have tried also to point out some of the
							speculative tendencies fostered by the position. If it be asked what
							philosophical doctrines were explicitly taught, the answer must be a
							very short one. English philosophy barely existed. Parr was supposed to
							know something about metaphysics -- apparently because he could write
							good Latin. But the inference was hasty. Of one book, however, which had
							a real influence, I must say something, for though it contained little
							definite philosophy, it showed what kind of philosophy was congenial to
							the common-sense of the time. The sturdy radical, Horne Tooke, had been
							led to the study of philology by a characteristic incident. The legal
							question had arisen whether the words, <hi rend="italic">'She, knowing
								that Crooke had been indicted for forgery,'</hi> did so and so,
							contained an averment that Crooke had been indicted. Tooke argued in a
							letter to Dunning<ref target="n4.1">[1]</ref> that they did; because
							they were equivalent to the phrase, 'Crooke had been indicted for
							forgery: she, knowing that,' did so and so. This raises the question.
							What is the meaning of 'that'? Tooke took up the study, thinking, as he
							says, that it would throw light upon some philosophical questions. He
							learned some Anglo-Saxon and Gothic to test his theory and, of course,
							confirmed it.<ref target="n2.2">[2]</ref> The book shows ingenuity,
							shrewdness, and industry, and Tooke deserves credit for seeing the
							necessity of applying a really historical method to his problem, though
							his results were necessarily crude in the prescientific stage of
							philology.</p>


						<p>The book is mainly a long string of etymologies, which readers of
							different tastes have found intolerably dull or an amusing collection of
							curiosities. Tooke held, and surely with reason, that an investigation
							of language, the great instrument of thought, may help to throw light
							upon the process of thinking. He professes to be a disciple of Locke in
							philosophy as in politics. Locke, he said,<ref target="n4.3">[3]</ref>
							made a lucky mistake in calling his book an essay upon human
							understanding; for he thus attracted many who would have been repelled
							had he called it what it really was, 'a treatise upon words and
							language.' According to Tooke, in fact,<ref target="n4.4">[4]</ref> what
							we call 'operations of mind' are only 'operations of language.' The mind
							contemplates nothing but 'impressions,' that is, 'sensations or
							feelings,' which Locke called 'ideas.' Locke mistook composition of
							terms for composition of ideas. To compound ideas is impossible. We can
							only use one term as a sign of many ideas. Locke, again, supposed that
							affirming and denying were operations of the mind, whereas they are only
							artifices of language.<ref target="n4.5">[5]</ref></p>


						<p>The mind, then, can only contemplate, separately or together, aggregates
							of 'ideas,' ultimate atoms, incapable of being parted or dissolved.
							There are, therefore, only two classes of words, nouns and verbs; all
							others, prepositions, conjunctions, and so forth, being abbreviations, a
							kind of mental shorthand to save the trouble of enumerating the separate
							items. Tooke, in short, is a thorough-going nominalist. The realities,
							according to him, are sticks, stones, and material objects, or the
							'ideas' which 'represent' them. They can be stuck together or taken
							apart, but all the words which express relations, categories, and the
							like, are in themselves meaningless. The special objects of his scorn
							are 'Hermes' Harris, and Monboddo, who had tried to defend Aristotle
							against Locke. Monboddo had asserted that 'every kind of relation' is a
							pure 'idea of the intellect' not to be apprehended by sense.<ref
								target="n4.6">[6]</ref> If so, according to Tooke, it would be a
							nonentity.</p>


						<p>This doctrine gives a short cut to the abolition of metaphysics. The word
							'metaphysics,' says Tooke,<ref target="n4.7">[7]</ref> is nonsense. All
							metaphysical controversies are 'founded on the grossest ignorance of
							words and the nature of speech.' The greatest part of his second volume
							is concerned with etymologies intended to prove that an 'abstract idea'
							is a mere word. Abstract words, he says,<ref target="n4.8">[8]</ref> are
							generally 'participles without a substantive and therefore in
							construction used as substantives.' From a misunderstanding of this has
							arisen 'metaphysical jargon' and 'false morality.' In illustration he
							gives a singular list of words, including 'fate, chance, heaven, hell,
							providence, prudence, innocence, substance, fiend, angel, apostle,
							spirit, true, false, desert, merit, faith, etc., all of which are mere
							participles poetically embodied and substantiated by those who use
							them.' A couple of specific applications, often quoted by later writers,
							will sufficiently indicate his drift.</p>


						<p>Such words, he remarks,<ref target="n4.9">[9]</ref> as 'right' and 'just'
							mean simply that which is ordered or commanded. The chapter is headed
							'rights of man,' and Tooke's interlocutor naturally observes that this
							is a singular result for a democrat. Man, it would seem, has no rights
							except the rights created by the law. Tooke admits the inference to be
							correct, but replies that the democrat in disobeying human law may be
							obeying the law of God, and is obeying the law of God when he obeys the
							law of nature. The interlocutor does not inquire what Tooke could mean
							by the 'law of nature.' We can guess what Tooke would have said to Paine
							in the Wimbledon garden. In fact, however, Tooke is here, as elsewhere,
							following Hobbes, though, it seems, unconsciously. Another famous
							etymology is that of 'truth' from 'troweth.'<ref target="n4.10"
							>[10]</ref> Truth is what each man thinks. There is no such thing,
							therefore, as 'eternal, immutable, everlasting truth, unless mankind,
								<hi rend="italic">such as they are at present,</hi> be eternal,
							immutable, everlasting.' Two persons may contradict each other and yet
							each may be speaking what is true for him. Truth may be a vice as well
							as a virtue; for on many occasions it is wrong to speak the truth.</p>


						<p>These phrases may possibly be interpreted in a sense less paradoxical
							than the obvious one. Tooke's philosophy, if so it is to be called, was
							never fully expounded. He burned his papers before his death, and we do
							not know what he would have said about 'verbs,' which must have led, one
							would suppose, to some further treatment of relations, nor upon the
							subject, which as Stephens tells us, was most fully treated in his
							continuation, the value of human testimony.</p>


						<p>If Tooke was not a philosopher he was a man of remarkably shrewd cynical
							common-sense, who thought philosophy idle foppery. His book made a great
							success. Stephens tells us<ref target="n4.11">[11]</ref> that it brought
							him &#163;4000 or &#163;5000. Hazlitt in 1810 published a
							grammar professing to incorporate for the first time Horne Tooke's
							'discoveries.' The book was admired by Mackintosh,<ref target="n4.12"
								>[12]</ref> who, of course, did not accept the principles, and had a
							warm disciple in Charles Richardson (1775-1865), who wrote in its
							defence against Dugald Stewart and accepted its authority in his
							elaborate dictionary of the English language.<ref target="n4.13"
							>[13]</ref> But its chief interest for us is that it was a great
							authority with James Mill. Mill accepts the etymologies, and there is
							much in common between the two writers, though Mill had learned his main
							doctrines elsewhere, especially from Hobbes. What the agreement really
							shows is how the intellectual idiosyncrasy which is congenial to
							'nominalism' in philosophy was also congenial to Tooke's matter of fact
							radicalism and to the Utilitarian position of Bentham and his
						followers.</p>

						<head> II. DUGALD STEWART</head>

						<p>If English philosophy was a blank, there was still a leader of high
							reputation in Scotland. Dugald Stewart (1753-1828) had a considerable
							influence upon the Utilitarians. He represented, On the one hand, the
							doctrines which they thought themselves specially bound to attack, and
							it may perhaps be held that in some ways he betrayed to them the key of
							the position. Stewart<ref target="n4.14">[14]</ref> was son of a
							professor of mathematics at Edinburgh. He studied at Glasgow (1771-72)
							where he became Reid's favourite pupil and devoted friend. In 1772 he
							became the assistant, and in 1775 the colleague, of his father, and he
							appears to have had a considerable knowledge of mathematics. In 1785 he
							succeeded Adam Ferguson as professor of moral philosophy and lectured
							continuously until 1810. He then gave up his active duties to Thomas
							Brown, devoting himself to the completion and publication of the
							substance of his lectures. Upon Brown's death in 1820, he resigned a
							post to which he was no longer equal. A paralytic stroke in 1822
							weakened him, though he was still able to write. He died in 1828.</p>


						<p>If Stewart now makes no great mark in histories of philosophy, his
							personal influence was conspicuous. Cockburn describes him as of
							delicate appearance, with a massive head, bushy eyebrows, gray
							intelligent eyes, flexible mouth and expressive countenance. His voice
							was sweet and his ear exquisite. Cockburn never heard a better reader,
							and his manners, though rather formal, were graceful and dignified.
							James Mill, after hearing Pitt and Fox, declared that Stewart was their
							superior in eloquence. At Edinburgh, then at the height of its
							intellectual activity, he held his own among the ablest men and
							attracted the loyalty of the younger. Students came not only from
							Scotland but from England, the United States, France and Germany.<ref
								target="n4.15">[15]</ref> Scott won the professor's approval by an
							essay on the 'Customs of the Northern Nations.' Jeffrey, Horner,
							Cockburn and Mackintosh were among his disciples. His lectures upon
							Political Economy were attended by Sydney Smith, Jeffrey and Brougham,
							and one of his last hearers was Lord Palmerston. Parr looked up to him
							as a great philosopher, and contributed to his works an essay upon the
							etymology of the word 'sublime,' too vast to be printed whole. Stewart
							was an upholder of Whig principles, when the Scottish government was in
							the hands of the staunchest Tories. The irreverent young Edinburgh
							Reviewers treated him with respect, and to some extent applied his
							theory to politics. Stewart was the philosophical heir of Reid; and, one
							may say, was a Whig both in philosophy and in politics. He was a
							rationalist, but within the limits fixed by respectability; and he
							dreaded the revolution in politics, and believed in the surpassing
							merits of the British Constitution as interpreted by the respectable
							Whigs.</p>


						<p>Stewart represents the 'common-sense' doctrine. That name, as he
							observes, lends itself to an equivocation. Common-sense is generally
							used as nearly synonymous with 'mother wit,' the average opinion of
							fairly intelligent men; and he would prefer to speak of the 'fundamental
							laws of belief.'<ref target="n4.16">[16]</ref> There can, however, be no
							doubt that the doctrine derived much of its strength from the apparent
							confirmation of the 'average opinion' by the 'fundamental laws.' On one
							side, said Reid, are all the vulgar; on the other all the philosophers.
							'In this division, to my great humiliation, I find myself classed with
							the vulgar.'<ref target="n4.17">[17]</ref> Reid, in fact, had opposed
							the theories of Hume and Berkeley because they led to a paradoxical
							scepticism. If it be, as Reid held, a legitimate inference from Berkeley
							that a man may as well run his head against a post, there can be no
							doubt that it is shocking to common sense in every acceptation of the
							word. The reasons, however, which Reid and Stewart alleged for not
							performing that feat took a special form, which I am compelled to notice
							briefly because they set up the mark for the whole intellectual
							artillery of the Utilitarians. Reid, in fact, invented what J. S. Mill
							called 'intuitions.' To confute intuitionists and get rid of intuitions
							was one main purpose of all Mill's speculations. What, then, is an
							'intuition'? To explain that fully it would be necessary to write once
							more that history of the philosophical movement from Descartes to Hume,
							which has been summarised and elucidated by so many writers that it
							should be as plain as the road from St. Paul's to Temple Bar. I am
							forced to glance at the position taken by Reid and Stewart because it
							has a most important bearing upon the whole Utilitarian scheme. Reid's
							main service to philosophy was, in his own opinion,<ref target="n4.18"
								>[18]</ref> that he refuted the 'ideal system' of Descartes and his
							followers. That system, he says, carried in its womb the monster,
							scepticism, which came to the birth in 1739,<ref target="n4.19"
							>[19]</ref> the date of Hume's early <hi rend="italic">Treatise.</hi> To
							confute Hume, therefore, which was Reid's primary object, it was
							necessary to go back to Descartes, and to show where he deviated from
							the right track. In other words, we must trace the genealogy of 'ideas.'
							Descartes, as Reid admitted, had rendered immense services to
							philosophy. He had exploded the scholastic system, which had become a
							mere mass of logomachies and an incubus upon scientific progress. He had
							again been the first to 'draw a distinct line between the material and
							the intellectual world';<ref target="n4.20">[20]</ref> and Reid
							apparently assumes that he had drawn it correctly. One characteristic of
							the Cartesian school is obvious. Descartes, a great mathematician at the
							period when mathematical investigations were showing their enormous
							power, invented a mathematical universe. Mathematics presented the true
							type of scientific reasoning and determined his canons of inquiry. The
							'essence' of matter, he said, was space. The objective world, as we have
							learned to call it, is simply space solidified or incarnate geometry.
							Its properties therefore could be given as a system of deductions from
							first principles, and it forms a coherent and self-subsistent whole.
							Meanwhile the essence of the soul is thought. Thought and matter are
							absolutely opposed. They are contraries, having nothing in common.
							Reality, however, seems to belong to the world of space. The brain, too,
							belongs to that world, and motions in the brain must be determined as a
							part of the material mechanism. In some way or other 'ideas' correspond
							to these motions; though to define the way tried all the ingenuity of
							Descartes' successors. In any case an idea is 'subjective': it is a
							thought, not a thing. It is a shifting, ephemeral entity not to be fixed
							or grasped. Yet, somehow or other, it exists, and it 'represents'
							realities; though the divine power has to be called in to guarantee the
							accuracy of the representation. The objective world, again, does not
							reveal itself to us as simply made up of 'primary qualities'; we know of
							it only as somehow endowed with 'secondary' or sense-given qualities: as
							visible, tangible, audible, and so forth. These qualities are plainly
							'subjective'; they vary from man to man, and from moment to moment: they
							cannot be measured or fixed; and must be regarded as a product in some
							inexplicable way of the action of matter upon mind; unreal or, at any
							rate, not independent entities.</p>


						<p>In Locke's philosophy, the 'ideas,' legitimate or illegitimate
							descendants of the Cartesian theories, play a most prominent part.
							Locke's admirable common-sense made him the leader who embodied a
							growing tendency. The empirical sciences were growing; and Locke, a
							student of medicine, could note the fallacies which arise from
							neglecting observation and experiment, and attempting to penetrate to
							the absolute essences and entities. Newton's great success was due to
							neglecting impossible problems about the nature of force in itself
							'action at a distance' and so forth -- and attention to the sphere of
							visible phenomena. The excessive pretensions of the framers of
							metaphysical systems had led to hopeless puzzles and merely verbal
							solutions. Locke, therefore, insisted upon the necessity of ascertaining
							the necessary limits of human knowledge. All our knowledge of material
							facts is obviously dependent in some way upon our sensations -- however
							Meeting or unreal they may be. Therefore, the material sciences must
							depend upon sense-given data or upon observation and experiment. Hume
							gives the ultimate purpose, already implied in Locke's essay, when he
							describes his first treatise (on the title page) as an 'attempt to
							introduce the experimental mode of reasoning into moral subjects.' Now,
							as Reid thinks, the effect of this was to construct our whole knowledge
							out of the representative ideas. The empirical factor is so emphasised
							that we lose all grasp of the real world. Locke, indeed, though he
							insists upon the derivation of our whole knowledge from 'ideas,' leaves
							reality to the 'primary qualities' without clearly expounding their
							relation to the secondary. But Berkeley, alarmed by the tendency of the
							Cartesian doctrines to materialism and mechanical necessity, reduces the
							'primary' to the level of the 'secondary,' and proceeds to abolish the
							whole world of matter. We are thus left with nothing but 'ideas,' and
							the ideas are naturally 'subjective' and therefore in some sense unreal.
							Finally Hume gets rid of the soul as well as the outside world; and
							then, by his theory of 'causation,' shows that the ideas themselves are
							independent atoms, cohering but not rationally connected, and capable of
							being arbitrarily joined or separated in any way whatever. Thus the
							ideas have ousted the facts. We cannot get beyond ideas, and yet ideas
							are still purely subjective. The 'real' is separated from the
							phenomenal, and truth divorced from fact. The sense-given world is the
							whole world, and yet is a world of mere accidental conjunctions and
							separation. That is Hume's scepticism, and yet according to Reid is the
							legitimate development of Descartes' 'ideal system.' Reid, I take it,
							was right in seeing that there was a great dilemma. What was required to
							escape from it? According to Kant, nothing less than a revision of
							Descartes' mode of demarcation between object and subject. The 'primary
							qualities' do not correspond in this way to an objective world radically
							opposed to the subjective. Space is not a form of things, but a form
							imposed upon the data of experience by the mind itself. This, as Kant
							says, supposes a revolution in philosophy comparable to the revolution
							made by Copernicus in astronomy. We have completely to invert our whole
							system of conceiving the world. Whatever the value of Kant's doctrine,
							of which I need here say nothing, it was undoubtedly more prolific than
							Reid's. Reid's was far less thoroughgoing. He does not draw a new line
							between object and subject, but simply endeavours to show that the
							dilemma was due to certain assumptions about the nature of 'ideas.' The
							real had been altogether separated from the phenomenal, or truth
							divorced from fact. You can only have demonstrations by getting into a
							region beyond the sensible world; while within that world -- that is,
							the region of ordinary knowledge and conduct -- you are doomed to
							hopeless uncertainty. An escape, therefore, must be sought by some
							thorough revision of the assumed relation, but not by falling back upon
							the exploded philosophy of the schools. Reid and his successors were
							quite as much alive as Locke to the danger of falling into mere
							scholastic logomachy. They, too, will in some sense base all knowledge
							upon experience. Reid constantly appeals to the authority of Bacon, whom
							he regards as the true founder of inductive science. The great success
							of Bacon's method in the physical sciences, encouraged the hope, already
							expressed by Newton, that a similar result might be achieved in 'moral
								philosophy.'<ref target="n4.21">[21]</ref> Hume had done something
							to clear the way, but Reid was, as Stewart thinks, the first to perceive
							clearly and justly the 'analogy between these two different branches of
							human knowledge.' The mind and matter are two co-ordinate things, whose
							properties are to be investigated by similar methods. Philosophy thus
							means essentially psychology. The two inquiries are two 'branches' of
							inductive science, and the problem is to discover by a perfectly
							impartial examination what are the 'fundamental laws of mind' revealed
							by an accurate analysis of the various processes of thought. The main
							result of Reid's investigations is given most pointedly in his early <hi
								rend="italic">Inquiry,</hi> and was fully accepted by Stewart.
							Briefly it comes to this. No one can doubt that we believe, as a fact,
							in an external world. We believe that there are sun and moon, stones,
							sticks, and human bodies. This belief is accepted by the sceptic as well
							as by the dogmatist, although the sceptic reduces it to a mere blind
							custom or 'association of ideas.' Now Reid argues that the belief,
							whatever its nature, is not and cannot be derived from the sensations.
							We do not construct the visible and tangible world, for example, simply
							out of impressions made upon the senses of sight and touch. To prove
							this, he examines what are the actual data provided by these senses, and
							shows, or tries to show, that we cannot from them alone construct the
							world of space and geometry. Hence, if we consider experience
							impartially and without preconception, we find that it tells us
							something which is not given by the senses. The senses are not the
							material of our perceptions, but simply give the occasions upon which
							our belief is called into activity. The sensation is no more like the
							reality in which we believe than the pain of a wound is like the edge of
							the knife. Perception tells us directly and immediately, without the
							intervention of ideas, that there is, as we all believe, a real external
							world.</p>


						<p>Reid was a vigorous reasoner, and credit has been given to him by some
							disciples of Kant's doctrine of time and space. Schopenhauer<ref
								target="n4.22">[22]</ref> says that Reid's 'excellent work' gives a
							complete 'negative proof of the Kantian truths'; that is to say, that
							Reid proves satisfactorily that we cannot construct the world out of the
							sense-given data alone. But, whereas Kant regards the senses as
							supplying the materials moulded by the perceiving mind, Reid regards
							them as mere stimuli exciting certain inevitable beliefs. As a result of
							Reid's method, then, we have 'intuitions.' Reid's essential contention
							is that a fair examination of experience will reveal certain fundamental
							beliefs, which cannot be explained as mere manifestations of the
							sensations, and which, by the very fact that they are inexplicable, must
							be accepted as an 'inspiration.'(23*) Reid professes to discover these
							beliefs by accurately describing facts. He finds them there as a chemist
							finds an element. The 'intuition' is made by substituting for 'ideas' a
							mysterious and inexplicable connection between the mind and matter.<ref
								target="n4.24">[24]</ref> The chasm exists still, but it is somehow
							bridged by a quasi-miracle. Admitting, therefore, that Reid shows a gap
							to exist in the theory, his result remains 'negative.' The philosopher
							will say that it is not enough to assert a principle dogmatically
							without showing its place in a reasoned system of thought. The
							psychologist, On the other hand, who takes Reid's own ground, may regard
							the statement only as a useful challenge to further inquiry. The
							analysis hitherto given may be insufficient, but where Reid has failed,
							other inquirers may be more successful. As soon, in fact, as we apply
							the psychological method, and regard the 'philosophy of mind' as an
							'inductive science,' it is perilous, if not absolutely inconsistent, to
							discover 'intuitions' which will take us beyond experience. The line of
							defence against empiricism can only be provisional and temporary. In his
							main results, indeed, Reid had the advantage of being on the side of
							'common sense.' Everybody was already convinced that there were sticks
							and stones, and everybody is prepared to hear that their belief is
							approved by philosophy. But a difficulty arises when a similar method is
							applied to a doctrine sincerely disputed. To the statement, 'this is a
							necessary belief,' it is a sufficient answer to reply, 'I don't believe
							it.' In that case, an intuition merely amounts to a dogmatic assumption
							that I am infallible, and must be supported by showing its connection
							with beliefs really universal and admittedly necessary.</p>


						<p>Dugald Stewart followed Reid upon this main question, and with less force
							and originality represents the same point of view. He accepts Reid's
							view of the two co-ordinate departments of knowledge; the science of
							which mind, and the science of which body, is the object. Philosophy is
							not a 'theory of knowledge' or of the universe; but, as it was then
							called, 'a philosophy of the human mind.' 'Philosophy' is founded upon
							inductive psychology; and it only becomes philosophy in a wider sense in
							so far as we discover that as a fact we have certain fundamental
							beliefs, which are thus given by experience, though they take us in a
							sense beyond experience. Jeffrey, reviewing Stewart's life of Reid, in
							the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> of 1804, makes a significant
							inference from this. Bacon's method, he said, had succeeded in the
							physical sciences, because there we could apply experiment. But
							experiment is impossible in the science of mind; and therefore
							philosophy will never be anything but a plaything or a useful variety of
							gymnastic. Stewart replied at some length in his <hi rend="italic"
								>Essays,</hi><ref target="n4.25">[25]</ref> fully accepting the
							general conception, but arguing that the experimental method was
							applicable to the science of mind. Jeffrey observes that it was now
							admitted that the 'profoundest reasonings' had brought us back to the
							view of the vulgar, and this, too, is admitted by Stewart so far as the
							cardinal doctrine of 'the common sense' philosophy, the theory of
							perception, is admitted.</p>


						<p>From this, again, it follows that the 'notions we annex to the words
							Matter and Mind are merely relative.'<ref target="n4.26">[26]</ref> We
							know that mind exists as we know that matter exists; or, if anything, we
							know the existence of mind more certainly because more directly. The
							mind is suggested by 'the subjects of our consciousness'; the body by
							the objects 'of our perception.' But, on the other hand, we are totally
							'ignorant of the essence of either.'<ref target="n4.27">[27]</ref> We
							can discover the laws either of mental or moral phenomena; but a law, as
							he explains, means in strictness nothing but a 'general fact.'<ref
								target="n4.28">[28]</ref> It is idle, therefore, to explain the
							nature of the union between the two unknowable substances; we can only
							discover that they are united and observe the laws according to which
							one set of phenomena corresponds to the other. From a misunderstanding
							of this arise all the fallacies of scholastic ontology, 'the most idle
							and absurd speculation that ever employed the human faculties.'<ref
								target="n4.29">[29]</ref> The destruction of that pseudo-science was
							the great glory of Bacon and Locke; and Reid has now discovered the
							method by which we may advance to the establishment of a truly inductive
							'philosophy of mind.'</p>


						<p>It is not surprising that Stewart approximates in various directions to
							the doctrines of the empirical school. He leans towards them whenever he
							do es not see the results to which he is tending. Thus, for example, he
							is a thorough-going nominalist;<ref target="n4.30">[30]</ref> and on
							this point he deserts the teaching of Reid. He defends against Reid the
							attack made by Berkeley and Hume upon 'abstract ideas.' Rosmini,<ref
								target="n4.31">[31]</ref> in an elaborate criticism, complains that
							Stewart did not perceive the inevitable tendency of nominalism to
								materialism.<ref target="n4.32">[32]</ref> Stewart, in fact, accepts
							a good deal of Horne Tooke's doctrine,<ref target="n4.33">[33]</ref>
							though calling Tooke an 'ingenious grammarian, not a very profound
							philosopher,' but holds, as we shall see, that the materialistic
							tendency can be avoided. As becomes a nominalist, he attacks the
							syllogism upon grounds more fully brought out by J. S. Mill. Upon
							another essential point, he agrees with the pure empiricists. He accepts
							Hume's view of causation in all questions of physical science. In
							natural philosophy, he declares causation means only conjunction. The
							senses can never give us the 'efficient' cause of any phenomenon. In
							other words, we can never see a 'necessary connection' between any two
							events. He collects passages from earlier writers to show how Hume had
							been anticipated; and holds that Bacon's inadequate view of this truth
							was a main defect in his theories.<ref target="n4.34">[34]</ref> Hence
							we have a characteristic conclusion. He says, when discussing the proofs
							of the existence of God,<ref target="n4.35">[35]</ref> that we have an
							'irresistible conviction of the <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> of a
							cause' for every change. Hume, however, has shown that this can never be
							a logical necessity. It must then, argues Stewart, be either a
							'prejudice' or an 'intuitive judgment.' Since it is shown by 'universal
							consent' not to be a prejudice, it must be an intuitive judgment. Thus
							Hume's facts are accepted; but his inference denied. The actual causal
							nexus is inscrutable. The conviction that there must be a connection
							between events attributed by Hume to 'custom' is attributed by Stewart
							to intuitive belief. Stewart infers that Hume's doctrine is really
							favourable to theology. It implies that God gives us the conviction, and
							perhaps, as Malebranche held, that God is 'the constantly operating
							efficient Cause in the material world.'<ref target="n4.36">[36]</ref>
							Stewart's successor, Thomas Brown, took up this argument on occasion of
							the once famous 'Leslie controversy'; and Brown's teaching was endorsed
							by James Mill and by John Stuart Mill.</p>


						<p>According to J. S. Mill, James Mill and Stewart represented opposite
							poles of philosophic thought. I shall have to consider this dictum
							hereafter. On the points already noticed Stewart must be regarded as an
							ally rather than an opponent of the Locke and Hume tradition. Like them
							he appeals unhesitatingly to experience, and cannot find words strong
							enough to express his contempt for 'ontological' and scholastic methods.
							His 'intuitions' are so far very harmless things, which fall in with
							common sense, and enable him to hold without further trouble the beliefs
							which, as a matter of fact, are held by everybody. They are an excuse
							for not seeking any ultimate explanation in reason. He is, indeed,
							opposed to the school which claimed to be the legitimate successor to
							Locke, but which evaded Hume's scepticism by diverging towards
							materialism. The great representative of this doctrine in England had
							been Hartley, and in Stewart's day Hartley's lead had been followed by
							Priestley, who attacked Reid from a materialist point of view, by
							Priestley's successor, Thomas Belsham, and by Erasmus Darwin. We find
							Stewart, in language which reminds us of later controversy, denouncing
							the 'Darwinian School'<ref target="n4.37">[37]</ref> for theories about
							instinct incompatible with the doctrine of final causes. It might appear
							that a philosopher who has re-established the objective existence of
							space in opposition to Berkeley, was in danger of that materialism which
							had been Berkeley's bugbear. But Stewart escapes the danger by his
							assertion that our knowledge of matter is 'relative' or confined to
							phenomena. Materialism is for him a variety of ontology, involving the
							assumption that we know the essence of matter. To speak with Hartley of
							'vibrations,' animal spirits, and so forth, is to be led astray by a
							false analogy. We can discover the laws of correspondence of mind and
							body, but not the ultimate nature of either.<ref target="n4.38"
							>[38]</ref> Thus he regards the 'physiological metaphysics of the
							present day' as an 'idle waste of labour and ingenuity on questions to
							which the human mind is altogether incompetent.'<ref target="n4.39"
							>[39]</ref> The principles found by inductive observation are as
							independent of these speculations as Newton's theory of gravitation of
							an ultimate mechanical cause of gravitation.</p>


						<p>Hartley's followers, however, could drop the 'vibration' theory; and
							their doctrine then became one of 'association of ideas.' To this famous
							theory, which became the sheet-anchor of the empirical school, Stewart
							is not altogether opposed. We find him speaking of 'indissoluble
							association' in language which reminds us of the Mills.<ref
								target="n4.40">[40]</ref> Hume had spoken of association as
							comparable to gravitation -- the sole principle by which our 'ideas' and
							'impressions' are combined into a whole; a theory, of course,
							corresponding to his doctrine of 'belief' as a mere custom of
							associating. Stewart uses the principle rather as Locke had done, as
							explaining fallacies due to 'casual associations.' It supposes, as he
							says, the previous existence of certain principles, and cannot be an
							ultimate explanation. The only question can be at what point we have
							reached an 'original principle,' and are therefore bound to stop our
								analysis.<ref target="n4.41">[41]</ref> Over this question he glides
							rather too lightly, as is his custom; but from his point of view the
							belief, for example, in an external world, cannot be explained by
							association, inasmuch as it reveals itself as an ultimate datum.</p>


						<p>In regard to the physical sciences, then, Stewart's position approximates
							very closely to the purely 'empirical' view. When we come to a different
							application of his principles, we find him taking a curiously balanced
							position between different schools. 'Common sense' naturally wishes to
							adapt itself to generally accepted beliefs; and with so flexible a
							doctrine as that of 'intuitions' it is not difficult to discover methods
							of proving the ordinary dogmas. Stewart's theology is characteristic of
							this tendency. He describes the so-called <hi rend="italic">a
							priori</hi> proof, as formulated by Clarke. But without denying its
							force, he does not like to lay stress upon it. He dreads 'ontology' too
							much. He therefore considers that the argument at once most satisfactory
							to the philosopher and most convincing to ordinary men is the argument
							from design. The belief in God is not 'intuitive,' but follows
							immediately from two first principles: the principle that whatever
							exists has a cause, and the principle that a 'combination of means
							implies a designer.'<ref target="n4.42">[42]</ref> The belief in a cause
							arises on our perception of change as our belief in the external world
							arises upon our sensations. The belief in design must be a 'first
							principle' because it includes a belief in 'necessity' which cannot
							arise from mere observation of 'contingent truths.'<ref target="n4.43"
								>[43]</ref> Hence Stewart accepts the theory of final causes as
							stated by Paley. Though Paley's ethics offended him, he has nothing but
							praise for the work upon <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology.</hi><ref
								target="n4.44">[44]</ref> Thus, although 'common sense' does not
							enable us to lay down the central doctrine of theology as a primary
							truth, it does enable us to interpret experience in theological terms.
							In other words, his theology is of the purely empirical kind, which was,
							as we shall see, the general characteristic of the time.</p>


						<p>In Stewart's discussion of ethical problems the same doctrine of 'final
							causes' assumes a special importance. Stewart, as elsewhere, tries to
							hold an intermediate position; to maintain the independence of morality
							without committing himself to the 'ontological' or purely logical view;
							and to show that virtue conduces to happiness without allowing that its
							dictates are to be deduced from its tendency to produce happiness. His
							doctrine is to a great extent derived from the teaching of Hutcheson and
							Bishop Butler. He really approximates most closely to Hutcheson, who
							takes a similar view of Utilitarianism, but he professes the warmest
							admiration of Butler. He explicitly accepts Butler's doctrine of the
							'supremacy of the conscience' -- a doctrine which as he says, the
							bishop, 'has placed in the strongest and happiest light.'<ref
								target="n4.45">[45]</ref> He endeavours, again, to approximate to
							the 'intellectual school,' of which Richard Price (1723-1791) was the
							chief English representative at the time. Like Kant, Price deduces the
							moral law from principles of pure reason. The truth of the moral law.
							'Thou shalt do to others as you wish that they should do to you,' is as
							evident as the truth of the law in geometry, 'things which are equal to
							the same thing are equal to each other.' Stewart so far approves that he
							wishes to give to the moral law what is now called all possible
							'objectivity,' while the 'moral sense' of Hutcheson apparently
							introduced a 'subjective' element. He holds, however, that our moral
							perceptions 'involve a feeling of the heart,' as well as a 'judgment of
							the understanding,'<ref target="n4.46">[46]</ref> and ascribes the same
							view to Butler. But then, by using the word 'reason' so as to include
							the whole nature of a rational being, we may ascribe to it the 'origin
							of those simple ideas which are not excited in the mind by the operation
							of the senses, but which arise in consequence of the operation of the
							intellectual powers among the various objects.'<ref target="n4.47"
							>[47]</ref> Hutcheson, he says, made his 'moral sense' unsatisfactory by
							taking his illustrations from the 'secondary' instead of the 'primary
								qualities,'<ref target="n4.48">[48]</ref> and thus with the help of
							intuitive first principles, Stewart succeeds in believing that it would
							be as hard for a man to believe that he ought to sacrifice another man's
							happiness to his own as to believe that three angles of a triangle are
							equal to one right angle.<ref target="n4.49">[49]</ref> It is true that
							a feeling and a judgment are both involved; but the 'intellectual
							judgment' is the groundwork of the feeling, not the feeling of the
								judgment.<ref target="n4.50">[50]</ref> In spite, however, of this
							attempt to assimilate his principles to those of the intellectual
							school, the substance of Stewart's ethics is essentially psychological.
							It rests, in fact, upon his view that philosophy depends upon inductive
							psychology, and, therefore, essentially upon experience subject to the
							cropping up of convenient 'intuitions.'</p>


						<p>This appears from the nature of his argument against the Utilitarians. In
							his time, this doctrine was associated with the names of Hartley,
							Tucker, Godwin, and especially Paley. He scarcely refers to Bentham.<ref
								target="n4.51">[51]</ref> Paley is the recognised anvil for the
							opposite school. Now he agrees, as I have said, with Paley's view of
							natural theology and entirely accepts therefore the theory of 'final
							causes.' The same theory becomes prominent in his ethical teaching. We
							may perhaps say that Stewart's view is in substance an inverted
							Utilitarianism. It may be best illustrated by an argument familiar in
							another application. Paley and his opponents might agree that the
							various instincts of an animal are so constituted that in point of fact
							they contribute to his preservation and his happiness. But from one
							point of view this appears to be simply to say that the conditions of
							existence necessitate a certain harmony, and that the harmony is
							therefore to be a consequence of his self-preservation. From the
							opposite point of view, which Stewart accepts, it appears that the
							self-preservation is the consequence of a pre-established harmony, which
							has been divinely appointed in order that he may live. Stewart, in
							short, is a 'teleologist' of the Paley variety. Psychology proves the
							existence of design in the moral world, as anatomy or physiology proves
							it in the physical.</p>


						<p>Stewart therefore fully agrees that virtue generally produces happiness.
							lf it be true (a doctrine, he thinks, beyond our competence to decide)
							that 'the sole principle of action in the Deity' is benevolence, it may
							be that he has commanded us to be virtuous because he sees virtue to be
							useful. In this case utility may be the final cause of morality; and the
							fact that virtue has this tendency gives the plausibility to utilitarian
								systems.<ref target="n4.52">[52]</ref> But the key to the difficulty
							is the distinction between 'final' and 'efficient' causes; for the
							efficient cause of morality is not the desire for happiness, but a
							primitive and simple instinct, namely, the moral faculty.</p>


						<p>Thus he rejects Paley's notorious doctrine that virtue differs from
							prudence only in regarding the consequences in another world instead of
							consequences in this.<ref target="n4.53">[53]</ref> Reward and
							punishment 'presuppose the notions of right and wrong' and cannot be the
							source of those notions. The favourite doctrine of association, by which
							the Utilitarians explained unselfishness, is only admissible as
							accounting for modifications, such as are due to education and example,
							but 'presupposes the existence of certain principles which are common to
							all mankind.' The evidence of such principles is established by a long
							and discursive psychological discussion. It is enough to say that he
							admits two rational principles, 'self-love' and the 'moral faculty,' the
							coincidence of which is learned only by experience. The moral faculty
							reveals simple 'ideas' of right and wrong, which are incapable of any
							further analysis. But besides these, there is a hierarchy of other
							instincts or desires, which he calls 'implanted' because 'for aught we
							know' they may be of 'arbitrary appointment.'<ref target="n4.54"
							>[54]</ref> Resentment, for example, is an implanted instinct, of which
							the 'final cause' is to defend us against 'sudden violence.'<ref
								target="n4.55">[55]</ref> Stewart's analysis is easygoing and
							suggests more problems than it solves. The general position, however, is
							clear enough, and not, I think, without much real force as against the
							Paley form of utilitarianism.</p>


						<p>The acceptance of the doctrine of 'final causes' was the inevitable
							course for a philosopher who wishes to retain the old creeds and yet to
							appeal unequivocally to experience. It suits the amiable optimism for
							which Stewart is noticeable. To prove the existence of a perfect deity
							from the evidence afforded by the world, you must of course take a
							favourable view of the observable order. Stewart shows the same tendency
							in his Political Economy, where he is Adam Smith's disciple, and fully
							shares Smith's beliefs that the harmony between the interests of the
							individual and the interests of the society is an evidence of design in
							the Creator of mankind. In this respect Stewart differs notably from
							Butler, to whose reasonings he otherwise owed a good deal. With Butler
							the conscience implies a dread of divine wrath and justifies the
							conception of a world alienated from its maker. Stewart's 'moral
							faculty' simply recognises or reveals the moral law; but carries no
							suggestion of supernatural penalties. The doctrines by which Butler
							attracted some readers and revolted others throw no shadow over his
							writings. He is a placid enlightened professor, whose real good feeling
							and frequent shrewdness should not be overlooked in consequence of the
							rather desultory and often superficial mode of reasoning. This, however,
							suggests a final remark upon Stewart's position.</p>


						<p>In the preface<ref target="n4.56">[56]</ref> to his <hi rend="italic"
								>Active and Moral Powers</hi> (1828) Stewart apologises for the
							large space given to the treatment of Natural Religion. The lectures, he
							says, which form the substance of the book, were given at a time when
							'enlightened zeal for liberty' was associated with the 'reckless
							boldness of the uncompromising freethinker.' He wished, therefore, to
							show that a man could be a liberal without being an atheist. This gives
							the position characteristic of Stewart and his friends. The group of
							eminent men who made Edinburgh a philosophical centre was thoroughly in
							sympathy with the rationalist movement of the eighteenth century. The
							old dogmatic system of belief could be held very lightly even by the
							more educated clergy. Hume's position is significant. He could lay down
							the most unqualified scepticism in his writings; but he always regarded
							his theories as intended for the enlightened; he had no wish to disturb
							popular beliefs in theology, and was a strong Tory in politics. His
							friends were quite ready to take him upon that footing. The politeness
							with which 'Mr Hume's' speculations are noticed by men like Stewart and
							Reid is in characteristic contrast to the reception generally accorded
							to more popular sceptics. They were intellectual curiosities not meant
							for immediate application. The real opinion of such men as Adam Smith
							and Stewart was probably a rather vague and optimistic theism. In the
							professor's chair they could talk to lads intended for the ministry
							without insulting such old Scottish prejudice (there was a good deal of
							it) as survived: and could cover rationalising opinions under language
							which perhaps might have a different meaning for their hearers. The
							position was necessarily one of tacit compromise. Stewart considers
							himself to be an inductive philosopher appealing frankly to experience
							and reason; and was in practice a man of thoroughly liberal and generous
							feelings. He was heartily in favour of progress as he understood it.
							Only he will not sacrifice common sense; that is to say, the beliefs
							which are in fact prevalent and congenial to existing institutions.
							Common sense, of course, condemns extremes: and if logic seems to be
							pushing a man towards scepticism in philosophy or revolution in
							practice, he can always protest by the convenient device of intuitions.</p>


						<p>I have gone so far in order to illustrate the nature of the system which
							the Utilitarians took to be the antithesis of their own. It may be
							finally remarked that at present both sides were equally ignorant of
							contemporary developments of German thought. When Stewart became aware
							that there was such a thing as Kant's philosophy, he tried to read it in
							a Latin version. Parr, I may observe, apparently did not know of this
							version, and gave up the task of reading German. Stewart's example was
							not encouraging. He had abandoned the 'undertaking in despair' partly
							from the scholastic barbarism of the style, partly 'my utter inability
							to comprehend the author's meaning.' He recognises similarity between
							Kant and Reid, but thinks Reid's simple statement of the fact that space
							cannot be derived from the senses more philosophical than Kant's
							'superstructure of technical mystery.'<ref target="n4.57">[57]</ref></p>


						<p>I have dwelt upon the side in which Stewart's philosophy approximates to
							the empirical school, because the Utilitarians were apt to misconceive
							the position. They took Stewart to be the adequate representative of all
							who accepted one branch of an inevitable dilemma. The acceptance of
							'intuitions,' that is, was the only alternative to thorough-going
							acceptance of 'experience.' They supposed, too, that persons vaguely
							described as 'Kant and the Germans' taught simply a modification of the
							'intuitionist' view. I have noticed how emphatically Stewart claimed to
							rely upon experience and to base his philosophy upon inductive
							psychology, and was so far admitting the first principles and the
							general methods of his opponents. The Scottish philosophy, however,
							naturally presented itself as an antagonistic force to the Utilitarians.
							The 'intuitions' represented the ultimate ground taken, especially in
							religious and ethical questions, by men who wished to be at once liberal
							philosophers and yet to avoid revolutionary extremes. 'Intuitions' had
							in any case a negative value, as protests against the sufficiency of the
							empirical analysis. It might be quite true, for example, that Hume's
							analysis of certain primary mental phenomena -- of our belief in the
							external world or of the relation of cause and effect -- was radically
							insufficient. He had not given an adequate explanation of the facts. The
							recognition of the insufficiency of his reasoning was highly important
							if only as a stimulus to inquiry. It was a warning to his and to
							Hartley's followers that they had not thoroughly unravelled the
							perplexity but only cut the knot. But when the insufficiency of the
							explanation was interpreted as a demonstration that all explanation was
							impossible, and the 'intuition' an ultimate 'self-evident' truth, it
							became a refusal to inquire just where inquiry was wanted; a positive
							command to stop analysis at an arbitrary point; and a round assertion
							that the adversary could not help believing precisely the doctrine which
							he altogether declined to believe. Naturally the empiricists refused to
							bow to an authority which was simply saying, 'Don't inquire further,'
							without any ground for the prohibition except the <hi rend="italic"
								>'ipse dixitism'</hi> which declared that inquiry must be fruitless.
							Stewart, in fact, really illustrated the equivocation between the two
							meanings of 'common sense.' If by that name he understood, as he
							professed to understand, ultimate 'laws of thought,' his position was
							justifiable as soon as he could specify the laws and prove that they
							were ultimate. But so far as he virtually took for granted that the
							average beliefs of intelligent people were such laws, and on that ground
							refund to examine the evidence of their validity, he was inconsistent,
							and his position only invited assault. As a fact, I believe that his
							'intuitions' covered many most disputable propositions; and that the
							more clearly they were stated, the more they failed to justify his
							interpretations. He was not really answering the most vital and critical
							questions, but implicitly reserving them, and putting an arbitrary stop
							to investigations desirable on his own principles.</p>


						<p>The Scottish philosophy was, however, accepted in England, and made a
							considerable impression in France, as affording a tenable barrier
							against scepticism. It was, as I have said, in philosophy what Whiggism
							was in politics. Like political Whiggism it included a large element of
							enlightened and liberal rationalism; but like Whiggism it covered an
							aversion to thorough-going logic. The English politician was suspicious
							of abstract principles, but could cover his acceptance of tradition and
							rule of thumb by general phrases about liberty and toleration. The Whig
							in philosophy equally accepted the traditional creed, sufficiently
							purified from cruder elements, and sheltered his doctrine by speaking of
							'intuitions and laws of thought.' In both positions there was really, I
							take it, a great deal of sound practical wisdom; but they also implied a
							marked reluctance to push inquiry too far, and a tacit agreement to be
							content with what the Utilitarians denounced as 'vague generalities' --
							phrases, that is, which might be used either to conceal an underlying
							scepticism, or really to stop short in the path which led to scepticism.
							In philosophy as in politics, the Utilitarians boasted of being
							thorough-going Radicals, and hated compromises, which to them appeared
							to be simply obstructive. I need not elaborate a point which will meet
							us again. If I were writing a history of thought in general I should
							have to notice other writers, though there were none of much
							distinction, who followed the teaching of Stewart or of his opponents of
							the Hartley and Darwin school. It would be necessary also to insist upon
							the growing interest in the physical sciences, which were beginning not
							only to make enormous advances, but to attract popular attention. For my
							purpose, however, it is I think sufficient to mention these writers,
							each of whom had a very special relation to the Utilitarians. I turn,
							therefore, to Bentham.</p>

					<head>CHAPTER V<lb/> BENTHAM'S LIFE</head>
					<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d35">
						<head>I. Early Life</head>

						<p>Jeremy Bentham,<ref target="n5.1">[1]</ref> the patriarch of the English
							Utilitarians, sprang from the class imbued most thoroughly with the
							typical English prejudices. His first recorded ancestor, Brian Bentham,
							was a pawnbroker, who lost money by the stop of the Exchequer in 1672,
							but was neither ruined, nor, it would seem, alienated by the king's
							dishonesty. He left some thousands to his son, Jeremiah, an attorney and
							a strong Jacobite. A second Jeremiah, born 2nd December 1712, carried on
							his father's business, and though his clients were not numerous,
							increased his fortune by judicious investments in houses and lands.
							Although brought up in Jacobite principles, he transferred his
							attachment to the Hanoverian dynasty when a relation of his wife married
							a valet of George II. The wife, Alicia Grove, was daughter of a
							tradesman who had made a small competence at Andover. Jeremiah Bentham
							had fallen in love with her at first sight, and wisely gave up for her
							sake a match with a fortune of &#163;10,000. The couple were fondly
							attached to each other and to their children. The marriage took place
							towards the end of 1744, and the eldest son, Jeremy, was born in Red
							Lion Street, Houndsditch, 4th February 1747-48 (o.s.) The only other
							child who grew up was Samuel, afterwards Sir Samuel Bentham, born 11th
							January 1757. When eighty years old, Jeremy gave anecdotes of his
							infancy to his biographer, Bowring, who says that their accuracy was
							confirmed by contemporary documents, and proved his memory to be as
							wonderful as his precocity. Although the child was physically puny, his
							intellectual development was amazing. Before he was two he burst into
							tears at the sight of his mother's chagrin upon his refusal of some
							offered dainty. Before he was 'breeched,' an event which happened when
							he was three and a quarter, he ran home from a dull walk, ordered a
							footman to bring lights and place a folio Rapin upon the table, and was
							found plunged in historical studies when his parents returned to the
							house. In his fourth year he was imbibing the Latin grammar, and at the
							age of five years nine months and nineteen days, as his father notes, he
							wrote a scrap of Latin, carefully pasted among the parental memoranda.
							The child was not always immured in London. His parents spent their
							Sundays with the grandfather Bentham at Barking, and made occasional
							excursions to the house of Mrs Bentham's mother at Browning Hill, near
							Reading. Bentham remembered the last as a 'paradise,' and a love of
							flowers and gardens became one of his permanent passions.</p>


						<p>Jeremy cherished the memory of his mother's tenderness. The father,
							though less sympathetic, was proud of his son's precocity, and
							apparently injudicious in stimulating the unformed intellect. The boy
							was almost a dwarf in size. When sixteen he grew ahead,<ref
								target="n5.2">[2]</ref> and was so feeble that he could scarcely
							drag himself upstairs. Attempts to teach him dancing failed from the
							extreme weakness of his knees.<ref target="n5.3">[3]</ref> He showed a
							taste for music, and could scrape a minuet on the fiddle at six years of
							age. He read all such books as came in his way. His parents objected to
							light literature, and he was crammed with such solid works as Rapin,
							Burnet's <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Earth,</hi> and Cave's <hi
								rend="italic">Lives of the Apostles.</hi> Various accidents,
							however, furnished him with better food for the imagination. He wept for
							hours over <hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe,</hi> studied <hi
								rend="italic">Gulliver's Travels</hi> as an authentic document, and
							dipped into a variety of such books as then drifted into middle-class
							libraries. A French teacher introduced him to some remarkable books. He
							read <hi rend="italic">T&eacute;l&eacute;maque,</hi> which
							deeply impressed him, and, as he thought, implanted in his mind the
							seeds of later moralising. He attacked unsuccessfully some of Voltaire's
							historical works, and even read <hi rend="italic">Candide,</hi> with
							what emotions we are not told. The servants meanwhile filled his fancy
							with ghosts and hobgoblins. To the end of his days he was still haunted
							by the imaginary horrors in the dark,<ref target="n5.4">[4]</ref> and he
								says<ref target="n5.5">[5]</ref> that they had been among the
							torments of his life. He had few companions of his own age, and though
							he was 'not unhappy' and was never subjected to corporal punishment, he
							felt more awe than affection for his father. His mother, to whom he was
							strongly attached, died on 6th January 1759.</p>


						<p>Bentham was thus a strangely precocious, and a morbidly sensitive child,
							when it was decided in 1755 to send him to Westminster. The headmaster,
							Dr Markham, was a friend of his father's. Westminster, he says,
							represented 'hell' for him when Browning Hill stood for paradise. The
							instruction 'was wretched.' The fagging system was a 'horrid despotism.'
							The games were too much for his strength. His industry, however, enabled
							him to escape the birch, no small achievement in those days,<ref
								target="n5.6">[6]</ref> and he became distinguished in the studies
							such as they were. He learned the catechism by heart, and was good at
							Greek and Latin verses, which he manufactured for his companions as well
							as himself. He had also the rarer accomplishment, acquired from his
							early tutor, of writing more easily in French than English. Some of his
							writings were originally composed in French. He was, according to
							Bowring, elected to one of the King's scholarships when between nine and
							ten, but as 'ill-usage was apprehended' the appointment was
								declined.<ref target="n5.7">[7]</ref> He was at a boarding-house,
							and the life of the boys on the foundation was probably rougher. In June
							1760 his father took him to Oxford, and entered him as a commoner at
							Queen's College. He came into residence in the following October, when
							only twelve years old. Oxford was not more congenial than Westminster.
							He had to sign the Thirty-nine Articles in spite of scruples suppressed
							by authority. The impression made upon him by this childish compliance
							never left him to the end of his life.<ref target="n5.8">[8]</ref> His
							experience resembled that of Adam Smith and Gibbon. Laziness and vice
							were prevalent. A gentleman commoner of Queen's was president of a
							'hellfire club,' and brutal horseplay was still practised upon the
							weaker lads. Bentham, still a schoolboy in age, continued his schoolboy
							course. He wrote Latin verses, and one of his experiments, an ode upon
							the death of George II, was sent to Johnson, who called it 'a very
							pretty performance for a young man.' He also had to go through the form
							of disputation in the schools. Queen's College had some reputation at
							this time for teaching logic.<ref target="n5.9">[9]</ref> Bentham was
							set to read Watt's <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> (1725), Sanderson's
							Compendium artis Logicae, (1615), and Rowning's <hi rend="italic"
								>Compendious System of Natural Philosophy</hi> (1735-42). Some
							traces of these studies remained in his mind.</p>


						<p>In 1763 Bentham took his B.A. degree, and returned to his home. It is
							significant that when robbed of all his money at Oxford he did not
							confide in his father. He was paying by a morbid reserve for the
							attempts made to force him into premature activity. He accepted the
							career imposed by his father's wishes, and in November 1763 began to eat
							his dinners in Lincoln's Inn. He returned, however, to Oxford in
							December to hear Blackstone's lectures. These lectures were then a
							novelty at an English university. The Vinerian professorship had been
							founded in 1758 in consequence of the success of a course voluntarily
							given by Blackstone; and his lectures contained the substance of the
							famous Commentaries, first published 1765-1769. They had a great effect
							upon Bentham. He says that he 'immediately detected Blackstone's fallacy
							respecting natural rights,' thought other doctrines illogical, and was
							so much occupied by these reflections as to be unable to take notes.
							Bentham's dissatisfaction with Blackstone had not yet made him an
							opponent of the constituted order. He was present at some of the
							proceedings against Wilkes, and was perfectly bewitched by Lord
							Mansfield's <hi rend="italic">'Grimgibber'</hi> that is, taken in by his
							pompous verbiage.<ref target="n5.10">[10]</ref></p>


						<p>In 1765 his father married Mrs Abbot, the mother of Charles Abbot,
							afterwards Lord Colchester. Bentham's dislike of his step-mother
							increased the distance between him and his father. He took his M.A.
							degree in 1766 and in 1767 finally left Oxford for London to begin, as
							his father fondly hoped, a fight towards the woolsack. The lad's
							diffidence and extreme youth had indeed prevented him from forming the
							usual connections which his father anticipated as the result of a
							college life. His career as a barrister was short and grievously
							disappointing to the parental hopes. His father, like the Elder Fairford
							in <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet,</hi> had 'a cause or two at nurse' for
							the son. The son's first thought was to 'put them to death.' A brief was
							given to him in a suit, upon which &#163;50 depended. He advised
							that the suit should be dropped and the money saved. Other experiences
							only increased his repugnance to his profession.<ref target="n5.11"
							>[11]</ref> A singularly strong impression had been made upon him by the
							Memoirs of Teresa Constantia Phipps, in which there is an account of
							vexatious legal proceedings as to the heroine's marriage. He appears to
							have first read this book in 1759. Then, he says, the 'Demon of Chicane
							appeared to me in all his hideousness. I vowed war against him. My vow
							has been accomplished!'<ref target="n5.12">[12]</ref> Bentham thus went
							to the bar as a 'bear to the stake.' He diverged in more than one
							direction. He studied chemistry under Fordyce (1736-1802), and hankered
							after physical science. He was long afterwards (1788) member of a club
							to which Sir Joseph Banks, John Hunter, R.L. Edgeworth, and other men of
							scientific reputation belonged.<ref target="n5.13">[13]</ref> But he had
							drifted into a course of speculation, which, though more germane to
							legal studies, was equally fatal to professional success. The father
							despaired, and he was considered to be a 'lost child.'</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="2" id="d36">
						<head>II. FIRST WRITINGS</head>

						<p>Though lost to the bar, he had really found himself. He had taken the
							line prescribed by his idiosyncrasy. His father's injudicious forcing
							had increased his shyness at the bar, and he was like an owl in
							daylight. But no one, as we shall see, was less diffidentin speculation.
							Self-confidence in a philosopher is often the private credit which he
							opens with his imagination to compensate for his incapacity in the rough
							struggles of active life. Bentham shrank from the world in which he was
							easily browbeaten to the studdy in which he could reign supreme. He had
							not the strong passions which prompt commonplace ambition, and cared for
							little for the prizes for which most men will sacrifice their lives.
							Nor, on the other hand, can he be credited with that ardent philanthropy
							or vehement indignation which prompts toan internecine struggle with
							actual wrongdoers. He had not the ardour which led Howard to devote a
							life to destroy abuses, or that which turned Swift's blood to gall in
							the struggle against triumphant corruption. He was thoroughly amiable,
							but of kindly rather than energetic affections. He, therefore, desired
							reform. but so far from regarding the ruling classes with rancour, took
							their part against the democrats. 'I was a great reformist.' he says,
							'but never suspected that the "people in power" were against reform. I
							supposed they only wanted to know what was good in order to embrace
								it.<ref target="n5.14">[14]</ref> The most real of pleasures for him
							lay in speculating upon the general principles by which the 'people in
							power' should beguided. To construct a general chart for legislation, to
							hunt down sophistries, to explode mere noisy rhetoric, to classify and
							arrange and re-classify until his whole intellectual wealth was neatly
							arranged in proper pigeon-holes, was a delight for its own sake. He
							wished well to mankind; he detested abuses, but he hated neither the
							corrupted nor the corrupters; and it might almost seem that he rather
							valued the benevolent end, because it gave employment to his faculties,
							than valued the employment because it led to the end. This is implied in
							his remark made at the end of his life. He was, he said, as selfish as a
							man could be; but 'somehow or other' selfishness had in him taken the
							form of benevolence.<ref target="n5.15">[15]</ref> He was at any rate in
							the position of a man with the agreeable conviction that he has only to
							prove the wisdom of a given course in order to secure its adoption. Like
							many mechanical inventors, he took for granted that a process which was
							shown to be useful would therefore be at once adopted, and failed to
							anticipate the determined opposition of the great mass of 'vested
							interests' already in possession.</p>


						<p>At this period he made the discovery, or what he held to be the
							discovery, which governed his whole future career. He laid down the
							principle which was to give the clue to all his investigations; and, as
							he thought, required only to be announced to secure universal
							acceptance. When Bentham revolted against the intellectual food provided
							atschool and college, he naturally took up the philosophy which at that
							period represented the real living stream of thought. To be a man of
							enlightenment in those days was to belong to the school of Locke. Locke
							represented reason, free thought, and the abandonment of prejudice.
							besides Locke, he mentions Hume, Montesquieu, Helv&egrave;tius,
							Beccaria, and Barrington. Helv&egrave;tius especially did much to
							suggest to him his leading principle, and upon country trips which he
							took with his father and step-mother, he used to lag behind studying
							Helv&egrave;tius' <hi rend="italic">De l' Esprit.</hi><ref
								target="n5.16">[16]</ref> Locke, he says in an early note
							(1773-1774), should give the principles, Helv&egrave;tius the
							matter, of a complete digest of the law. He mentioned with especial
							interest the third volume of Hume's <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Human
								Nature</hi> for its ethical views: 'he felt as if scales fell from
							his eyes' when he read it.<ref target="n5.17">[17]</ref> Daines
							Barrington's <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Statutes</hi> (1766)
							interested him by miscellaneous suggestions. The book, he says,<ref
								target="n5.18">[18]</ref> was a 'great treasure.' 'It is everything,
								<hi rend="italic">&agrave; propos</hi> of everything; I wrote
							volumes upon this volume.' Beccaria's treatise upon crimes and
							punishments had appeared in 1764, and had excited the applause of
							Europe. The world was clearly ready for a fundamental reconstruction of
							legislative theories. Under the influence of such studies Bentham
							formulated his famous principle -- a principle which to some seemed a
							barren truism, to others a mere epigram, and to some a dangerous
							falsehood. Bentham accepted it not only as true, but as expressing a
							truth of extraordinary fecundity, capable of guiding him through the
							whole labyrinth of political and legislative speculation. His
							'fundamental axiom' is that 'the greatest happiness of the greatest
							number is the measure of right and wrong.'<ref target="n5.19">[19]</ref>
							Bentham himself<ref target="n5.20">[20]</ref> attributes the authorship
							of the phrase to Beccaria or Priestley. The general order of thought to
							which this theory belongs was of course not the property of any special
							writer or any particular period. Here I need only observe that this
							embodiment of the general doctrine of utility or morality had been
							struck out by Hutcheson in the attempt (as his title says) 'to introduce
							a mathematical calculation on subjects of morality.' This defines the
							exact reason which made it acceptable to Bentham. For the vague
							reference to utility which appears in Hume and other writers of his
							school, he substituted a formula, the terms of which suggest the
							possibility of an accurate quantitative comparison of different sums of
							happiness. In Bentham's mind the difference between this and the more
							general formula was like the difference between the statement that the
							planets gravitate towards the sun, and the more precise statement that
							the law of gravitation varies inversely as the square of the distance.
							Bentham hoped for no less an achievement than to become the Newton of
							the moral world.</p>


						<p>Bentham, after leaving Oxford, took chambers in Lincoln's Inn. His father
							on his second marriage had settled some property upon him, which brought
							in some &#163;90 a year. He had to live like a gentleman upon this,
							and to give four guineas a year to the laundress, four to his barber,
							and two to his shoeblack. In spite of Jeremy's deviation from the path
							of preferment, the two were on friendly terms, and when the hopes of the
							son's professional success grew faint, the father showed sympathy with
							his literary undertakings. Jeremy visited Paris in 1770, but made few
							acquaintances, though he was already regarded as a 'philosopher.' In
							1778 he was in correspondence with d'Alembert, the abb&eacute;
							Morellet, and other philanthropic philosophers, but it does not appear
							at what time this connection began.<ref target="n5.21">[21]</ref> He
							translated Voltaire's <hi rend="italic">Taureau Blonc</hi><ref
								target="n5.22">[22]</ref> -- a story which used to 'convulse him
							with laughter.' A reference to it will show that Bentham by this time
							took the Voltairean view of the Old Testament. Bentham, however, was
							still on the side of the Tories. His first publication was a defence of
							Lord Mansfield in 1770 against attacks arising out of the prosecution of
							Woodfall for publishing Junius's letter to the king. This defence,
							contained in two letters, signed Irenaeus, was published in the <hi
								rend="italic">Gazetteer.</hi> Bentham's next performance was
							remarkable in the same sense. Among the few friends who drifted to his
							chambers was John Lind (1737-1781), who had been a clergyman, and after
							acting as tutor to a prince in Poland, had returned to London and become
							a writer for the press. He had business relations with the elder
							Bentham, and the younger Bentham was to some extent his collaborator in
							a pamphlet<ref target="n5.23">[23]</ref> which defended the conduct of
							ministers to the American colonies. Bentham observes that he was
							prejudiced against the Americans by the badness of their arguments, and
							thought from the first, as he continued to think, that the Declaration
							of independence was a hodge-podge of confusion and absurdity, in which
							the thing to be proved is all along taken for granted.<ref
								target="n5.24">[24]</ref> Two other friendships were formed by
							Bentham about this time: one with James Trail, an unsuccessful
							barrister, who owed a seat in Parliament and some minor offices to Lord
							Hertford, and is said by Romilly to have been a man of great talent; and
							one with George Wilson, afterwards a leader of the Norfolk circuit, who
							had become known to him through a common interest in Dr Fordyce's
							lectures upon chemistry. Wilson became a bosom friend, and was one of
							Bentham's first disciples, though they were ultimately alienated.<ref
								target="n5.25">[25]</ref></p>


						<p>At this time, Bentham says, that his was 'truly a miserable life.'<ref
								target="n5.26">[26]</ref> yet he was getting to work upon his grand
							project. He tells his father on 1st October 1776 that he is writing his
								<hi rend="italic">Critical Elements of Jurisprudence,</hi> the book
							of which a part was afterwards published as the <hi rend="italic"
								>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation.</hi><ref
								target="n5.27">[27]</ref> In the same year he published his first
							important work, the <hi rend="italic">Fragment on Government.</hi> The
							year was in many ways memorable. The Declaration of Independence marked
							the opening of a new political era. Adam Smith's <hi rend="italic"
								>Wealth of Nations</hi> and Gibbon's <hi rend="italic">Decline and
								Fall</hi> formed landmarks in speculation and in history; and
							Bentham's volume, though it made no such impression, announced a serious
							attempt to apply scientific methods to problems of legislation. The
							preface contained the first declaration of his famous formula which was
							applied to the confutation of Blackstone: Bentham was apparently roused
							to this effort by recollections of the Oxford lectures. The <hi
								rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> contained a certain quantity of
							philosophical rhetoric; and as Blackstone was much greater in a literary
							than in a philosophical sense, the result was naturally unsatisfactory
							from a scientific point of view. He had vaguely appealed to the sound
							Whig doctrine of social compact, and while disavowing any strict
							historical basis had not inquired too curiously what was left of his
							supposed foundation. Bentham pounced upon the unfortunate bit of
							verbiage; insisted upon asking for a meaning when there was nothing but
							a rhetorical flourish, and tore the whole flimsy fabric to rags and
							tatters. A more bitter attack upon Blackstone, chiefly, as Bowring says,
							upon his defence of the Jewish law, was suppressed for fear of the law
							of libel.<ref target="n5.28">[28]</ref> The <hi rend="italic"
							>Fragment</hi> was published anonymously, but Bentham had confided the
							secret to his father by way of suggesting some slight set-off against
							his apparent unwillingness to emerge from obscurity. The book was at
							first attributed to Lord Mansfield, Lord Camden, and to Dunning. It was
							pirated in Dublin; and most of the five hundred copies printed appear to
							have been sold, though without profit to the author. The father's
							indiscretion let out the secret; and the sale, when the book was known
							to be written by a nobody, fell off at once, or so Bentham believed. The
							anonymous writer, however, was denounced and accused of being the author
							of much ribaldry, and among other accusations was said to be not only
							the translator but the writer of the <hi rend="italic">White
								Bull.</hi><ref target="n5.29">[29]</ref></p>


						<p>Bentham had fancied that all manner of 'torches from the highest regions'
							would come to light themselves at his 'farthing candle.' None of them
							came, and he was left for some years in obscurity, though still
							labouring at the great work which was one day to enlighten the world. At
							last, however, partial recognition came to him in a shape which greatly
							influenced his career. Lord Shelburne, afterwards marquis of Lansdowne,
							had been impressed by the <hi rend="italic">Fragment,</hi> and in 1781
							sought out Bentham at his chambers. Shelburne's career was to culminate
							in the following year with his brief tenure of the premiership (3rd July
							1782 to 24th February 1783). Rightly or wrongly his contemporaries felt
							the distrust indicated by his nickname 'Malagrida', which appears to
							have been partly suggested by a habit of overstrained compliment. He
							incurred the dislike not unfrequently excited by men who claim
							superiority of intellect without possessing the force of character which
							gives a corresponding weight in political affairs. Although his
							education had been bad, he had something of that cosmopolitan training
							which enabled many members of the aristocracy to look beyond the narrow
							middle-class prejudices and share in some degree the wider philosophical
							movements of the day. He had enjoyed the friendship of Franklin, and had
							been the patron of Priestley, who made some of his chemical discoveries
							at Bowood, and to whom he allowed an annuity. He belonged to that
							section of the Whigs which had most sympathy with the revolutionary
							movement. His chief political lieutenants were Dunning and
							Barr&eacute;, who at the time sat for his borough Calne. He now
							rapidly formed an intimacy with Bentham, who went to stay at Bowood in
							the autumn of 1781. Bentham now and then in later years made some rather
							disparaging remarks upon Shelburne, whom he apparently considered to be
							rather an amateur than a serious philosopher, and who in the House of
							Lords talked 'vague generalities' -- the sacred phrase by which the
							Utilitarians denounced all preaching but their own -- in a way to impose
							upon the thoughtless. He respected Shelburne. however, as one who
							trusted the people, and was distrusted by the Whig aristocracy. He felt,
							too, a real affection and gratitude for the patron to whom he owed so
							much. Shelburne had done him a great service.<ref target="n5.30"
							>[30]</ref> 'He raised me from the bottomless pit of humiliation. He
							made me feel I was something.' The elder Bentham was impressed by his
							son's acquaintance with a man in so eminent a position, and hoped that
							it might lead by a different path to the success which had been missed
							at the bar. At Bowood Bentham stayed over a month upon his first visit,
							and was treated in the manner appropriate to a philosopher. The men
							showed him friendliness, dashed with occasional contempt, and the ladies
							petted him. He met Lord Camden and Dunning and young William Pitt, and
							some minor adherents of the great man. Pitt was 'very good-natured and a
							little raw.' I was monstrously 'frightened at him,' but, when I came to
							talk with him, he seemed 'frightened at me.'<ref target="n5.31"
							>[31]</ref> Bentham, however, did not see what ideas they were likely to
							have in common. In fact there was the usual gulf between the speculative
							thinker and the practical man. 'All the statesmen,' so thought the
							philosopher, 'were wanting in the great elements of statesmanship': they
							were always talking about 'what <hi rend="italic">was</hi>' and seldom
							or never about 'what ought to be.'<ref target="n5.32">[32]</ref>
							Occasionally, it would seem, they descended lower, and made a little fun
							of the shy and over-sensitive intruder.<ref target="n5.33">[33]</ref>
							The ladies, however, made it up to him. Shelburne made him read his 'dry
							metaphysics' to them,<ref target="n5.34">[34]</ref> and they received it
							with feminine docility. Lord Shelburne had lately (1779) married his
							second wife, Louisa, daughter of the first earl of Upper Ossory. Her
							sister, Lady Mary Fitz-Patrick, married in 1766 to Stephen Fox,
							afterwards Lord Holland, was the mother of the Lord Holland of later
							days and of Miss Caroline Fox, who survived till 1845, and was at this
							time a pleasant girl of thirteen or fourteen. Lady Shelburne had also
							two half sisters, daughters of her mother's second marriage to Richard
							Vernon. Lady Shelburne took a fancy to Bentham, and gave him the
							'prodigious privilege' of admission to her dressing-room. Though haughty
							in manner, she was mild in reality, and after a time she and her sister
							indulged in 'innocent gambols.' In her last ill ness, Bentham was one of
							the only two men whom she would see, and upon her death in 1789, he was
							the only male friend to whom her husband turned for consolation. Miss
							Fox seems to have been the only woman who inspired Bentham with a
							sentiment approaching to passion. He wrote occasional letters to the
							ladies in the tone of elephantine pleasantry natural to one who was all
							his life both a philosopher and a child.<ref target="n5.35">[35]</ref>
							He made an offer of marriage to Miss Fox in 1805, when he was nearer
							sixty than fifty, and when they had not met for sixteen years. The
							immediate occasion was presumably the death of Lord Lansdowne. She
							replied in a friendly letter, regretting the pain which her refusal
							would inflict. In 1827 Bentham, then in his eightieth year, wrote once
							more, speaking of the flower she had given him 'in the green lane,' and
							asking for a kind answer. He was 'indescribably hurt and disappointed'
							by a cold and distant reply. The tears would come into the old man's
							eyes as he dealt upon the cherished memories of Bowood.<ref
								target="n5.36">[36]</ref> It is pleasant to know that Bentham was
							once in love; though his love seems to have been chiefly for a memory
							associated with what he called the happiest time of his life.</p>


						<p>Shelburne had a project for a marriage between Bentham and the widow of
							Lord Ashburton (Dunning), who died in 1783.<ref target="n5.37"
							>[37]</ref> He also made some overtures of patronage. 'He asked me,'
							says Bentham,<ref target="n5.38">[38]</ref> 'what he could do for me? I
							told him, nothing,' and this conduct -- so different from that of
							others, 'endeared me to him.' Bentham declined one offer in 1788; but in
							1790 he suddenly took it into his head that Lansdowne had promised him a
							seat in parliament; and immediately set forth his claims in a vast
							argumentative letter of sixty-one pages.<ref target="n5.39">[39]</ref>
							Lansdowne replied conclusively that he had not made the supposed
							promise, and had had every reason to suppose that Bentham preferred
							retirement to politics. Bentham accepted the statement frankly, though a
							short coolness apparently followed. The claim, in fact, only represented
							one of those passing moods to which Bentham was always giving way at odd
							moments.</p>


						<p>Bentham's intimacy at Bowood led to more important results. In 1788 he
							met Romilly and Dumont at Lord Lansdowne's table.<ref target="n5.40"
								>[40]</ref> He had already met Romilly in 1784 through Wilson, but
							after this the intimacy became close. Romilly had fallen in love with
							the <hi rend="italic">Fragment,</hi> and in later life he became
							Bentham's adviser in practical matters, and the chief if not the sole
							expounder of Bentham's theories in parliament.<ref target="n5.41"
							>[41]</ref> The alliance with Dumont was of even greater importance.
							Dumont, born at Geneva in 1759, had become a Protestant minister; he was
							afterwards tutor to Shelburne's son, and in 1788 visited Paris with
							Romilly and made acquaintance with Mirabeau. Romilly showed Dumont some
							of Bentham's papers written in French. Dumont offered to rewrite and to
							superintend their publication. He afterwards received other papers from
							Bentham himself, with whom he became personally acquainted after his
							return from Paris.<ref target="n5.42">[42]</ref> Dumont became Bentham's
							most devoted disciple, and laboured unweariedly upon the translation and
							condensation of his master's treatise. One result is odd enough. Dumont,
							it is said, provided materials for some of Mirabeau's 'most splendid'
							speeches; and some of these materials came from Bentham.<ref
								target="n5.43">[43]</ref> One would like to see how Bentham's prose
							was transmuted into an oratory by Mirabeau. In any case, Dumont's
							services to Bentham were invaluable. It is painful to add that according
							to Bowring the two became so much alienated in the end, that in 1827
							Bentham refused to see Dumont, and declared that his chief interpreter
							did 'not understand a word of his meaning.' Bowring attributes this
							separation to a remark made by Dumont about the shabbiness of Bentham's
							dinners as compared with those at Lansdowne House -- a comparison which
							he calls 'offensive, uncalled for, and groundless.'<ref target="n5.44"
								>[44]</ref> Bentham apparently argued that a man who did not like
							his dinners could not appreciate his theories: a fallacy excusable only
							by the pettishness of old age. Bowring, however, had a natural dulness
							which distorted many anecdotes transmitted through him; and we may hope
							that in this case there was some exaggeration.</p>


						<p>Bentham's emergence was, meanwhile, very slow. The great men whom he met
							at Lord Lansdowne's were not specially impressed by the shy philosopher.
							Wedderburn, so he heard, pronounced the fatal word 'dangerous' in regard
							to the <hi rend="italic">Fragment.</hi><ref target="n5.45">[45]</ref>
							How, thought Bentham, can utility be dangerous? Is this not
							self-contradictory? Later reflection explained the puzzle. What is
							useful to the governed need not be therefore useful to the governors.
							Mansfield, who was known to Lind, said that in some parts the author of
							the <hi rend="italic">Fragment</hi> was awake and in others was asleep.
							In what parts? Bentham wondered. Awake, he afterwards considered, in the
							parts where Blackstone, the object of Mansfield's personal
							'heart-burning,' was attacked; asleep where Mansfield's own despotism
							was threatened. Camden was contemptuous; Dunning only 'scowled' at him;
							and Barr&eacute;, after taking in his book, gave it back with the
							mysterious information that he had 'got into a scrape.'<ref
								target="n5.46">[46]</ref> The great book, therefore, though printed
							in 1781,<ref target="n5.47">[47]</ref> 'stuck for eight years,'<ref
								target="n5.48">[48]</ref> and the writer continued his obscure
							existence in Lincoln's Inn.<ref target="n5.49">[49]</ref> An opinion
							which he gave in some question as to the evidence in Warren Hastings's
							trial made, he says, an impression in his favour. Before publication was
							achieved, however, a curious episode altered Bentham's whole outlook.
							His brother Samuel (1757-1831), whose education he had partly
								superintended,<ref target="n5.50">[50]</ref> had been apprenticed to
							a shipwright at Woolwich, and in 1780 had gone to Russia in search of
							employment. Three years later he was sent by Prince Potemkin to
							superintend a great industrial establishment at Kritchev on a tributary
							of the Dnieper. There he was to be 'Jack-of-all-trades -- building
							ships, like Harlequin, of odds and ends -- a rope-maker, a sailmaker, a
							distiller, brewer, malster, tanner, glass-man, glass-grinder, potter,
							hemp-spinner, smith, and coppersmith.'<ref target="n5.51">[51]</ref> He
							was, that is, to transplant a fragment of ready-made Western
							civilisation into Russia. Bentham resolved to pay a visit to his
							brother, to whom he Was strongly attached. He left England in August
							1785, and stayed some time at Constantinople, where he met Maria James
							(1770-1836), the wife successively of W. Reveley and of John Gisborne,
							and the friend of Shelley. Thence he travelled by land to Kritchev, and
							settled with his brother at the neighbouring estate of Zadobras. Bentham
							here passed a secluded life, interested in his brother's occupations and
							mechanical inventions, and at the same time keeping up his own
							intellectual labours. The most remarkable result was the <hi
								rend="italic">Defence of Usury,</hi> written in the beginning of
							1787. Bentham appends to it a respectful letter to Adam Smith, who had
							supported the laws against usury inconsistently with his own general
							principles. The disciple was simply carrying out those principles to the
							logical application from which the master had shrunk. The manuscript was
							sent to Wilson, who wished to suppress it.<ref target="n5.52">[52]</ref>
							The elder Bentham obtained it, and sent it to the press. The book met
							Bentham was returning. It was highly praised by Thomas Reid,<ref
								target="n5.53">[53]</ref> and by the <hi rend="italic">Monthly
								Review;</hi> it was translated into various languages, and became
							one of the sacred books of the Economists. Wilson is described as 'cold
							and cautious,' and he suppressed another pamphlet upon prison
								discipline.<ref target="n5.54">[54]</ref> In a letter to Bentham,
							dated 26th February 1787, however, Wilson disavows any responsibility
							for the delay in the publication of the great book. 'The cause,' he
							says, 'lies in your constitution. With one-tenth part of your genius,
							and a common degree of steadiness, both Sam and you would long since
							have risen to great eminence. But your history, since I have known you,
							has been to be always running from a good scheme to a better. In the
							meantime life passes away and nothing is completed.' He entreated
							Bentham to return, and his entreaties were seconded by Trail, who
							pointed out various schemes of reform, especially of the poor-laws, in
							which Bentham might be useful. Wilson had mentioned already another
							inducement to publication. 'There is,' he says, on 24th September 1786,
							'a Mr Paley, a parson and archdeacon of Carlisle, who has written a book
							called <hi rend="italic">Principles of Moral and Political
							Philosophy,</hi> in quarto, and it has gone through two editions with
							prodigious applause.' He fears that Bentham will be charged with
							stealing from Paley, and exhorts him to come home and 'establish a great
							literary reputation in your own language, and in this country which you
								despise.'<ref target="n5.55">[55]</ref> Bentham at last started
							homewards. He travelled through Poland, Germany, and Holland, and
							reached London at the beginning of February 1788. He settled at a little
							farmhouse at Hendon, bought a 'superb harpsichord,' resumed his
							occupations, and saw a small circle of friends. Wilson urged him to
							publish his <hi rend="italic">Introduction</hi> without waiting to
							complete the vast scheme to which it was to be a prologue. Copies of the
							printed book were already abroad, and there was a danger of plagiarism.
							Thus urged, Bentham at last yielded, and the <hi rend="italic"
								>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</hi>
							appeared in 1789. The preface apologised for imperfections due to the
							plan of his work. The book, he explained, laid down the principles of
							all his future labours, and was to stand to him in the relation of a
							treatise upon pure mathematics to a treatise upon the applied sciences.
							He indicated ten separate departments of legislation, each of which
							would require a treatise in order to the complete execution of his
							scheme.</p>


						<p>The book gives the essence of Bentham's theories, and is the one large
							treatise published by himself. The other works were only brought to
							birth by the help of disciples. Dumont, in the discourse prefixed to the
								<hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s,</hi> explains the reason.
							Bentham, he says, would suspend a whole work and begin a new one because
							a single proposition struck him as doubtful. A problem of finance would
							send him to a study of Political Economy in general. A question of
							procedure would make him pause until he had investigated the whole
							subject of judicial organisation. While at work, he felt only the
							pleasure of composition. When his materials required form and finish, he
							felt only the fatigue. Disgust succeeded to charm; and he could scarcely
							be induced to interrupt his labours upon fresh matter in order to give
							to his interpreter the explanations necessary for the elucidation of his
							previous writings. He was without the literary vanity or the desire for
							completion which may prompt to premature publication, but may at least
							prevent the absolute waste of what has been already achieved. His method
							of writing was characteristic. He began by forming a complete logical
							scheme for the treatment of any subject, dividing and subdividing so as
							to secure an exhaustive classification of the whole matter of
							discussion. Then taking up any subdivision, he wrote his remarks upon
							sheets, which were put aside after being marked with references
							indicating their place in the final treatise. He never turned to these
							again. In time he would exhaust the whole subject, and it would then be
							the duty of his disciples simply to put together the bricks according to
							the indications placed upon each in order to construct the whole
								edifice.<ref target="n5.56">[56]</ref> As, however, the plan would
							frequently undergo a change, and as each fragment had been written
							without reference to the others, the task of ultimate combination and
							adaptation of the ultimate atoms was often very perplexing. Bentham, as
							we shall see, formed disciples ardent enough to put together these
							scattered documents as the disciples of Mahomet put together the Koran.
							Bentham's revelation was possibly less influential than Mahomet's; but
							the logical framework was far more coherent.</p>


						<p>Bentham's mind was for the present distracted. He had naturally returned
							full of information about Russia. The English ministry were involved in
							various negotiations with Russia, Sweden, and Denmark, the purpose of
							which was to thwart the designs of Russia in the East. Bentham wrote
							three letters to the <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser,</hi> signed
								Anti-Machiavel,<ref target="n5.57">[57]</ref> protesting against the
							warlike policy. Bentham himself believed that the effect was decisive,
							and that the 'war was given up' in consequence of his arguments.
							Historians <ref target="n5.58">[58]</ref> scarcely sanction this belief,
							which is only worth notice because it led to another belief, oddly
							characteristic of Bentham. A letter signed 'Partizan' in the <hi
								rend="italic">Public Advertiser</hi> replied to his first two
							letters. Who was 'Partizan'? Lord Lansdowne amused himself by informing
							Bentham that he was no less a personage than George III. Bentham, with
							even more than his usual simplicity, accepted this hoax as a serious
							statement. He derived no little comfort from the thought; for to the
							antipathy thus engendered in the 'best of kings' he attributed the
							subsequent failure of his Panopticon scheme.<ref target="n5.59"

						<head>III. THE PANOPTICON.</head>

						<p>The crash of the French revolution was now to change the whole course of
							European politics, and to bring philosophical jurists face to face with
							a long series of profoundly important problems. Bentham's attitude
							during the early stages of the revolution and the first war period is
							significant, and may help to elucidate some characteristics of the
							Utilitarian movement. Revolutions are the work of passion: the product
							of a social and political condition in which the masses are permeated
							with discontent, because the social organs have ceased to discharge
							their functions. They are not ascribable to the purely intellectual
							movement alone, though it is no doubt an essential factor. The
							revolution came in any case because the social order was out of joint,
							not simply because Voltaire or Rousseau or Diderot had preached
							destructive doctrines. The doctrines of the 'rights of man' are obvious
							enough to have presented themselves to many minds at many periods. The
							doctrines became destructive because the old traditions were shaken, and
							the traditions were shaken because the state of things to which they
							corresponded had become intolerable. The French evolution meant (among
							other things) that in the mind of the French peasant there had
							accumulated a vast deposit of bitter enmity against the noble who had
							become a mere parasite upon the labouring population, retaining, as
							Arthur Young said, privileges for himself, and leaving poverty to the
							lower classes. The peasant had not read Rousseau; he had read nothing.
							But when his discontent began to affect the educated classes, men who
							had read Rousseau found in his works the dialect most fitted to express
							the growing indignation. Rousseau's genius had devised the appropriate
							formula; for Rousseau's sensibility had made him prescient of the rising
							storm. What might be a mere commonplace for speculative students
							suddenly became the warcry in a social upheaval. In England, as I have
							tried to show, there was no such popular sentiment behind the political
							theories: and reformers were content with measures which required no
							appeal to absolute rights and general principles. Bentham was no
							Rousseau; and the last of men to raise a warcry. Passion and
							sentimentalism were to him a nuisance. His theories were neither
							suggested nor modified by the revolution. He looked on with curious
							calmness, as though the revolutionary disturbances were rather a
							transitory interruption to the progress of reform than indicative of a
							general convulsion. His own position was isolated. He had no strong
							reforming party behind him. The Whigs, his main friends, were powerless,
							discredited, and themselves really afraid to support any vigorous
							policy. They had in the main to content themselves with criticising the
							warlike policy which, for the time, represented the main current of
							national sentiment. Bentham shared many of their sympathies. He hated
							the abstract 'rights of man' theory as heartily as Burke. It was to him
							a 'hodge-podge' of fallacies. On the other hand, he was absolutely
							indifferent to the apotheosis of the British Constitution constructed by
							Burke's imagination. He cared nothing for history in general, or
							regarded it, from a Voltairean point of view, as a record of the follies
							and crimes of mankind. He wished to deal with political, and especially
							with legal, questions in a scientific spirit -- but 'scientific' would
							mean not pure mathematics but pure empiricism. He was quite as far from
							Paine's abstract methods as from Burke's romantic methods. Both of them,
							according to him, were sophists: though one might prefer logical and the
							other sentimental sophistries. Dumont, when he published (1802) his
							versions of Bentham, insisted upon this point, Nothing, he says, was
							more opposed to the trenchant dogmatism of the abstract theorists about
							'rights of man' and 'equality' than Bentham's thoroughly scientific
							procedure (<hi rend="italic">Discours Pr&eacute;liminaire</hi>).
							Bentham's intellectual position in this respect will require further
							consideration hereafter. All his prejudices and sympathies were those of
							the middle class from which he sprang. He was no democrat: he had no
							particular objection to the nobility, though he preferred Shelburne to
							the king's friends or to the Whig aristocracy. The reforms which he
							advocated were such as might be adopted by any enlightened legislator,
							not only by Shelburne but even by Blackstone. He had only, he thought,
							to convert a few members of parliament to gain the acceptance for a
							rational criminal code. It had hardly even occurred to him that there
							was anything wrong in the general political order, though he was
							beginning to find out that it was not so modifiable as he could have
							wished by the new ideas which he propounded.</p>


						<p>Bentham's activity during the first revolutionary war corresponded to
							this position. The revolution, whatever else it might do, obviously gave
							a chance to amateur legislators. There was any amount of work to be done
							in the way of codifying and reforming legislative systems. The deviser
							of Utopias had such an opening as had never occurred in the world's
							history. Lord Lansdowne, on the 3rd January 1789, expresses his pleasure
							at hearing that Bentham intends to 'take up the cause of the people in
								France.'<ref target="n5.60">[60]</ref> Bentham, as we have seen, was
							already known to some of the French leaders, and he was now taking time
							by the forelock. He sent to the Abb&eacute; Morellet a part of his
							treatise on Political Tactics, hoping to have it finished by the time of
							the meeting of the States General.<ref target="n5.61">[61]</ref> This
							treatise, civilly accepted by Morellet, and approved with some
							qualifications by Bentham's counsellors, Romilly, Wilson, and Trail, was
							an elaborate account of the organisation and procedure of a legislative
							assembly, founded chiefly on the practice of the House of Commons. It
							was published in 1816 by Dumont in company with <hi rend="italic"
								>Anarchic Fallacies,</hi> a vigorous exposure of the <hi
								rend="italic">Declaration of Rights,</hi> which Bentham had
							judiciously kept on his shelf. Had the French known of it, he remarks
							afterwards, they would have been little disposed to welcome him.<ref
								target="n5.62">[62]</ref> An elaborate scheme for the organisation
							of the French judiciary was suggested by a report to the National
							Assembly, and published in March 1790. In 1791, Bentham offered to go to
							France himself in order to establish a prison on his new scheme (to be
							mentioned directly), and become 'gratuitously the gaoler thereof,'<ref
								target="n5.63">[63]</ref> The Assembly acknowledged his 'ardent love
							of humanity,' and ordered an extract from his scheme to be printed for
							their instruction. The tactics actually adopted by the French
							revolutionists for managing assemblies and their methods of executing
							justice form a queer commentary on the philosopher who, like Voltaire's
							Mamres in the <hi rend="italic">White Bull,</hi> continued to 'meditate
							profoundly' in placid disregard of facts. He was in fact proposing that
							the lava boiling up in a volcanic eruption should arrange itself
							entirely according to his architectural designs. But his proposal to
							become a gaoler during the revolution reaches the pathetic by its
							amiable innocence. On 26th August 1792, Bentham was one of the men upon
							whom the expiring Assembly, anxious to show its desire of universal
							fraternity, conferred the title of citizen. With Bentham were joined
							Priestley, Paine, Wilberforce, Clarkson, Washington, and others. The
							September massacres followed. On 18th October the honour was
							communicated to Bentham. He replied in a polite letter, pointing out
							that he was a royalist in London for the same reason which would make
							him a republican in France. He ended by a calm argument against the
							proscription of refugees.<ref target="n5.64">[64]</ref> The Convention,
							if it read the letter, and had any sense of humour, must have been
							amused. The war and the Reign of Terror followed. Bentham turned the
							occasion to account by writing a pamphlet (not then published) exhorting
							the French to 'emancipate their colonies.' Colonies were an aimless
							burthen, and to get rid of them would do more than conquest to relieve
							their finances. British fleets and the insurrection of St. Domingo were
							emancipating by very different methods.</p>


						<p>Bentham was, of course, disgusted by the divergence of his clients from
							the lines chalked out by proper respect for law and order. On 31st
							October 1793 he writes to a friend, expressing his wish that Jacobinism
							could be extirpated; no price could be too heavy to pay for such a
							result: but he doubts whether war or peace would be the best means to
							the end, and protests against the policy of appropriating useless and
							expensive colonies instead of 'driving at the heart of the monster.'<ref
								target="n5.65">[65]</ref> Never was an adviser more at
							cross-purposes with the advised. It would be impossible to draw a more
							striking portrait of the abstract reasoner, whose calculations as to
							human motives omit all reference to passion, and who fancied that all
							prejudice can be dispelled by a few bits of logic.</p>


						<p>Meanwhile a variety of suggestions more or less important and connected
							with passing events were seething in his fertile brain. He wrote one of
							his most stinging pamphlets, <hi rend="italic">'Truth versus
							Ashhurst'</hi> in December 1792, directed against a judge who, in the
							panic suggested by the September massacres, had eulogised the English
							laws. Bentham's aversion to Jacobin measures by no means softened his
							antipathy to English superstitions; and his attack was so sharp that
							Romilly advised and obtained its suppression for the time. Projects as
							to war-taxes suggested a couple of interesting pamphlets written in
							1793, and published in 1795. In connection with this, schemes suggested
							themselves to him for improved systems of patents, for limited liability
							companies and other plans.<ref target="n5.66">[66]</ref> His great work
							still occupied him at intervals. In 1793 he offers to Dundas to employ
							himself in drafting Statutes, and remarks incidentally that he could
							legislate for Hindostan, should legislation be wanted there, as easily
							as for his own parish.<ref target="n5.67">[67]</ref> In 1794, Dumont is
							begging him to 'conquer his repugnance' to bestowing a few hints upon
							his interpreter.<ref target="n5.68">[68]</ref> In 1796, Bentham writes
							long letters suggesting that he should be sent to France with
							Wilberforce, in order to re-establish friendly relations.<ref
								target="n5.69">[69]</ref> In 1798 he is corresponding at great
							length with Patrick Colquhoun upon plans for improving the Metropolitan
								police.<ref target="n5.70">[70]</ref> In 1801 he says<ref
								target="n5.71">[71]</ref> that for two years and a half 'he has
							thought of scarce anything else' than a plan for interest-bearing notes,
							which he carefully elaborated and discussed with Nicholas Vansittart and
							Dr Beeke. In September 1800, however, he had found time to occupy
							himself with a proposed <hi rend="italic">frigidarium</hi> or ice-house
							for the preservation of fish, fruits, and vegetables; and invited Dr
							Roget, a nephew of Romilly, to come to his house and carry out the
							necessary experiments.<ref target="n5.72">[72]</ref> In January 1802 he
							writes to Dumont<ref target="n5.73">[73]</ref> proposing to send him a
							trifling specimen of the Panopticon, a set of hollow fire-irons invented
							by his brother, which may attract the attention of Buonaparte and
							Talleyrand. He proceeds to expound the merits of Samuel's invention for
							making wheels by machinery. Dumont replies, that fire-irons are
							'superfluities' -- (fire-arms might have been more to Buonaparte's
							taste) and that the Panopticon itself was coldly received.</p>


						<p>This Panopticon was to be Bentham's masterpiece. It occupied his chief
							attention from his return to England until the peace of Amiens. His
							brother had returned from Russia in 1791. Their father died 28th March
							1792, dividing his property equally between his sons. Jeremy's share
							consisted of the estate at Queen's Square Place, Westminster, and of
							landed property producing &#163; 500 or &#163;600 a year. The
							father, spite of the distance between them, had treated his son with
							substantial kindness, and had learned to take a pride in achievements
							very unlike those which he had at first desired.<ref target="n5.74"
							>[74]</ref> Bentham's position, however, was improved by the father's
							death. The Westminster estate included the house in which he lived for
							the rest of his life. There was a garden in which he took great delight,
							though London smoke gradually destroyed the plants: and in the garden
							was the small house where Milton had once lived.<ref target="n5.75"
							>[75]</ref> Here, with the co-operation of his brother and his increased
							income, he had all the means necessary for launching his grand scheme.</p>


						<p>The Panopticon, as defined by its inventor to Brissot, was a 'mill for
							grinding rogues honest, and idle men industrious.'<ref target="n5.76"
								>[76]</ref> It was suggested by a plan designed by his brother in
							Russia for a large house to be occupied by workmen, and to be so
							arranged that they could be under constant inspection. Bentham was
							working on the old lines of philanthropic reform. He had long been
							interested in the schemes of prison reform, to which Howard's labours
							had given the impetus. Blackstone, with the help of William Eden,
							afterwards Lord Auckland, had prepared the 'Hard Labour Bill,' which
							Bentham had carefully criticised in 1778. The measure was passed in
							1779, and provided for the management of convicts, who were becoming
							troublesome, as transportation to America had ceased to be possible.
							Howard, whose relation to Bentham I have already noticed, was appointed
							as one of the commissioners to carry out the provisions of the Act. The
							commissioners disagreed; Howard resigned; and though at last an
							architect (William Blackburn) was appointed who possessed Howard's
							confidence, and who constructed various prisons in the country, the
							scheme was allowed to drop. Bentham now hoped to solve the problem with
							his Panopticon. He printed an account of it in 1791. He wrote to his old
							antagonist, George III, describing it, together with another invention
							of Samuel's for enabling armies to cross rivers, which might be more to
							his Majesty's taste.<ref target="n5.77">[77]</ref> In March 1792 he made
							a proposal to the government offering to undertake the charge of a
							thousand convicts upon the Panopticon system.<ref target="n5.78"
							>[78]</ref> After delays suspicious in the eyes of Bentham, but hardly
							surprising at such a period, an act of parliament was obtained in 1794
							to adopt his schemes. Bentham had already been making preparations. He
								says<ref target="n5.79">[79]</ref> (14th September 1794) that he has
							already spent &#163;6000, and is spending at the rate of
							&#163;2000 a year, while his income was under &#163;600 a year.
							He obtained, however, &#163;2000 from the government. He had made
							models and architectural plans, in which he was helped by Reveley,
							already known to him at Constantinople. This sum, it appears, was
							required in order to keep together the men whom he employed. The nature
							of their employment is remarkable.<ref target="n5.80">[80]</ref> Samuel,
							a man of singular mechanical skill, which was of great use to the navy
							during the war, had devised machinery for work in wood and metal.
							Bentham had joined his brother, and they were looking out for a
							steam-engine. It had now occurred to them to employ convicts instead of
							steam, and thus to combine philanthropy with business. Difficulties of
							the usual kind arose as to the procurement of a suitable site. The site
							secured under the provisions of the 'Hard Labour Bill' was for some
							reason rejected; and Bentham was almost in despair. It was not until
							1799 that he at last acquired for &#163;12,000 an estate at
							Millbank, which seemed to be suitable. Meanwhile Bentham had found
							another application for his principle. The growth of pauperism was
							alarming statesmen. Whitbread proposed in February 1796 to fix a minimum
							rate of wages. The wisest thing that government could do, he said, was
							to 'offer a liberal premium for the encouragement of large families.'
							Pitt proceeded to prepare the abortive Poor-law Bill,<ref target="n5.81"
								>[81]</ref> upon which Bentham (in February 1797) sent in some very
							shrewd criticisms. They were not published, but are said to have
							'powerfully contributed to the abandonment of the measure.'<ref
								target="n5.82">[82]</ref> They show Bentham's power of incisive
							criticism, though they scarcely deal with the general principle. In the
							following autumn Bentham contributed to Arthur Young's <hi rend="italic"
								>Annals of Agriculture</hi> upon the same topic. It had struck him
							that an application of his Panopticon would give the required panacea.
							He worked out details with his usual zeal, and the scheme attracted
							notice among the philanthropists of the time. It was to be a
							'succedaneum' to Pitt's proposal. Meanwhile the finance committee,
							appointed in 1797, heard evidence from Bentham's friend, Patrick
							Colquhoun, upon the Panopticon, and a report recommending it was
							proposed by R. Pole Carew, a friend of Samuel Bentham. Although this
							report was suppressed, the scheme apparently received an impetus. The
							Millbank estate was bought in consequence of these proceedings, and a
							sum of only &#163;1000 was wanted to buy out the tenant of one piece
							of land. Bentham was constantly in attendance at a public office,
							expecting a final warrant for the money. It never came, and, as Bentham
							believed, the delay was due to the malice of George III. Had any other
							king been on the throne, Panopticon in both 'the prisoner branch and the
							pauper branch' would have been set at work.<ref target="n5.83"
							>[83]</ref> Such are the consequences of newspaper controversies with
							monarchs! After this, in any case, the poor Panopticon, as the old
							lawyers said, 'languishing did live,' and at last 'languishing did die.'
							Poor Bentham seems to have struggled vainly for a time. He appealed to
							Pitt's friend, Wilberforce; he appealed to his step-brother Abbot; he
							wrote to members of parliament, but all was in vain.</p>


						<p>Romilly induced him in 1802 to suppress a statement of his grievances
							which could only have rendered ministers implacable.<ref target="n5.84"
								>[84]</ref> But he found out what would hardly have been a discovery
							to most people, that officials can be dilatory and evasive; and certain
							discoveries about the treatment of convicts in New South Wales convinced
							him that they could even defy the laws and the Constitution when they
							were beyond inspection. He published (1803) a <hi rend="italic">Plea for
								the Constitution,</hi> showing the enormities committed in the
							colony, 'in breach of Magna Charta, the Petition of Right, the Habeas
							Corpus Act, and the Bill of Rights.' Romilly in vain told him that the
							attorney-general could not recommend the author of such an effusion to
							be keeper of a Panopticon.<ref target="n5.85">[85]</ref> The actual end
							did not come till 1811. A committee then reported against the scheme.
							They noticed one essential and very characteristic weakness. The whole
							system turned upon the profit to be made from the criminals' labour by
							Bentham and his brother. The committee observed that, however
							unimpeachable might be the characters of the founders, the scheme might
							lead to abuses in the hands of their successors. The adoption of this
							principle of 'farming' had in fact led to gross abuses both in gaols and
							in workhouses; but it was, as I have said, in harmony with the whole
							'individualist' theory. The committee recommended a different plan; and
							the result was the foundation of Millbank penitentiary, opened in
								1816.<ref target="n5.86">[86]</ref> Bentham ultimately received
							&#163;23,000 by way of compensation in 1813.<ref target="n5.87"
							>[87]</ref> The objections of the committee would now be a commonplace,
							but Bentham saw in them another proof of the desire to increase
							government patronage. He was well out of the plan. There were probably
							few men in England less capable of managing a thousand convicts, in
							spite of his theories about 'springs of action.' If anything else had
							been required to ensure failure, it would have been association with a
							sanguine inventor of brilliant abilities.</p>


						<p>Bentham's agitation had not been altogether fruitless. His plan had been
							partly adopted at Edinburgh by one of the Adams,<ref target="n5.88"
							>[88]</ref> and his work formed an important stage in the development of
							the penal system.</p>


						<p>Bentham, though he could not see that his failure was a blessing in
							disguise, had learned one lesson worth learning. He was ill-treated,
							according to impartial observers. 'Never,' says Wilberforce,<ref
								target="n5.89">[89]</ref> 'was any one worse used. I have seen the
							tears run down the cheeks of that strong-minded man through vexation at
							the pressing importunity of his creditors, and the indolence of official
							underlings when day after day he was begging at the Treasury for what
							was indeed a mere matter of right.' Wilberforce adds that Bentham was
							'quite soured,' and attributes his later opinions to this cause. When
							the Quarterly Review long afterwards taunted him as a disappointed man,
							Bentham declared himself to be in 'a state of perpetual and unruffled
							gaiety,' and the 'mainspring' of the gaiety of his own circle.<ref
								target="n5.90">[90]</ref> No one, indeed, could be less 'soured' so
							far as his habitual temper was concerned. But Wilberforce's remark
							contained a serious truth. Bentham had made a discovery. He had vowed
							war in his youth against the 'demon of chicane.' He had now learned that
							the name of the demon was 'Legion.' To cast him out, it would be
							necessary to cast out the demon of officialism; and we shall see what
							this bit of knowledge presently implied.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="4" id="d38">
						<head>IV. THE UTILITARIAN PROPAGANDA.</head>

						<p>Bentham in 1802 had reached the respectable age of fifty-four. He had
							published his first work twenty-six years, and his most elaborate
							treatise thirteen years, previously. He had been brought into contact
							with many of the eminent politicians and philanthropists of the day.
							Lansdowne had been a friendly patron: his advice had been treated with
							respect by Pitt, Dundas, and even by Blackstone; he was on friendly
							terms with Colquhoun, Sir F. Eden, Arthur Young, Wilberforce, and others
							interested in philanthropic movements, and his name at least was known
							to some French politicians. But his reputation was still obscure; and
							his connections did not develop into intimacies. He lived as a recluse
							and avoided society. His introduction to great people at Bowood had
							apparently rather increased than softened his shyness. The little circle
							of intimates, Romilly and Wilson and his own brother, must have
							satisfied his needs for social intercourse. It required an elaborate
							negotiation to bring about a meeting between him and Dr Parr, the great
							Whig prophet, although they had been previously acquainted, and Parr
							was, as Romilly said by way of introduction, a profound admirer and
							universal panegyrist.<ref target="n5.91">[91]</ref> He refused to be
							introduced by Parr to Fox, because he had 'nothing particular to say' to
							the statesman, and considered that to be 'always a sufficient reason for
							declining acquaintance.'<ref target="n5.92">[92]</ref></p>


						<p>But, at last, Bentham's fame was to take a start. Bentham, I said, had
							long before found himself. Dumont had now found Bentham. After long and
							tedious labours and multiplied communications between the master and the
							disciple, Dumont in the spring of 1802 brought out his <hi rend="italic"
								>Trait&eacute;s de L&eacute;gislation de M.
								J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Bentham.</hi> The book was partly a
							translation from Bentham's published and unpublished works,<ref
								target="n5.93">[93]</ref> and partly a statement of the pith of the
							new doctrine in Dumont's own language. It had the great merit of putting
							Bentham's meaning vigorously and compactly, and free from many of the
							digressions, minute discussions of minor points and arguments requiring
							a special knowledge of English law, which had impeded the popularity of
							Bentham's previous works.</p>


						<p>The Jacobin controversies were passing into the background: and Bentham
							began to attain a hearing as a reformer upon different lines. In 1803
							Dumont visited St. Petersburg, and sent home glowing reports of
							Bentham's rising fame. As many copies of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Trait&eacute;s</hi> had been sold there as in London. Codes
							were wanted; laws were being digested; and Bentham's work would supply
							the principles and the classification. A magnificent translation was
							ordered, and Russian officials wrote glowing letters in which Bentham
							was placed in a line with Bacon, Newton, and Adam Smith -- each the
							founder of a new science.<ref target="n5.94">[94]</ref> At home the new
							book was one of the objects of what Dumont calls the 'scandalous
							irreverence, of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi><ref
								target="n5.95">[95]</ref> This refers to a review of the <hi
								rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
								>Edinburgh Review</hi> of April 1804. Although patronising in tone,
							and ridiculing some of Bentham's doctrines as commonplace and condemning
							others as criminal, it paid some high compliments to his ability. The
							irreverence meant at least that Bentham had become one of the persons
							worth talking about, and that he was henceforth to influence the rising
							generation. In January 1807 the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> itself
							(probably Jeffrey) suggested that Bentham should be employed in a
							proposed reform of the Scottish judicial system. His old friend,
							Lansdowne, died on 7th May 1805, and in one of his last letters
							expresses a hope that Bentham's principles are at last beginning to
								spread.<ref target="n5.96">[96]</ref> The hope was fulfilled.</p>


						<p>During the eighteenth century Benthamism had gone through its period of
							incubation. It was now to become an active agency, to gather proselytes,
							and to have a marked influence not only upon legislative but upon
							political movements. The immediate effect upon Bentham of the decline of
							the Panopticon, and his consequent emancipation from immediately
							practical work, was apparently his return to his more legitimate
							employment of speculative labour. He sent to Dumont at St.
								Petersburg<ref target="n5.97">[97]</ref> part of the treatise upon
							Political Economy, which had been naturally suggested by his later work:
							and he applied himself to the Scottish judiciary question, to which many
							of his speculations had a close application. He published a work upon
							this subject in 1808. To the period between 1802 and 1812 belongs also
							the book, or rather the collection of papers, afterwards transformed
							into the book, Upon Evidence, which is one of his most valuable
							performances.</p>


						<p>A letter, dated 1st November 1810, gives a characteristic account of his
							position. He refers to hopes of the acceptance of some of his principles
							in South America. In Spain Spaniards are prepared to receive his laws
							'as oracles.' 'Now at length, when I am just ready to drop into the
							grave' (he had still twenty years of energetic work before him), 'my
							fame has spread itself all over the civilised world.' Dumont's
							publication of 1802 is considered to have superseded all previous
							writings on legislation. In Germany and France codes have been prepared
							by authorised lawyers, who have 'sought to do themselves credit by
							references to that work.'<ref target="n5.98">[98]</ref> It has been
							translated into Russian. Even in England he is often mentioned in books
							and in parliament. 'Meantime I am here scribbling on in my hermitage,
							never seeing anybody but for some special reason, always bearing
							relation to the service of mankind.'<ref target="n5.99">[99]</ref>
							Making all due allowance for the deceptive views of the outer world
							which haunt every 'hermitage,' it remains true that Bentham's fame was
							emerging from obscurity.</p>


						<p>The end of this period, moreover, was bringing him into closer contact
							with English political life. Bentham, as we have seen, rejected the
							whole Jacobin doctrine of abstract rights. So long as English politics
							meant either the acceptance of a theory which, for whatever reason,
							gathered round it no solid body of support, or, on the other hand, the
							acceptance of an obstructive and purely conservative principle, to which
							all reform was radically opposed, Bentham was necessarily in an isolated
							position. He had 'nothing particular to say' to Fox. He was neither a
							Tory nor a Jacobin, and cared little for the paralysed Whigs. He allied
							himself therefore, so far as he was allied with any one, with the
							philanthropic agitators who stood, like him, outside the lines of party.
							The improvement of prisons was not a party question. A marked change --
							not always, I think, sufficiently emphasised by historians -- had
							followed the second war. The party-divisions began to take the form
							which was to become more marked as time went on. The old issues between
							Jacobin and Anti-Jacobin no longer existed. Napoleon had become the heir
							of the revolution. The great struggle was beginning in which England
							commanded the ocean, while the Continent was at the feet of the empire.
							For a time the question was whether England, too, should be invaded.
							After Trafalgar invasion became hopeless. The Napoleonic victories
							threatened to exclude English trade from the Continent: while England
							retorted by declaring that the Continent should trade with nobody else.
							Upon one side the war was now appealing to higher feelings. It was no
							longer a crusade against theories, but a struggle for national existence
							and for the existence of other nations threatened by a gigantic
							despotism. Men like Wordsworth and Coleridge, who could not be
							Anti-Jacobins, had been first shocked by the Jacobin treatment of
							Switzerland, and now threw themselves enthusiastically into the cause
							which meant the rescue of Spain and Germany from foreign oppression. The
							generous feeling which had resented the attempt to forbid Frenchmen to
							break their own bonds, now resented the attempts of Frenchmen to impose
							bonds upon others. The patriotism which prompted to a crusade had seemed
							unworthy, but the patriotism which was now allied with the patriotism of
							Spain and Germany involved no sacrifice of other sentiment. Many men had
							sympathised with the early revolution, not so much from any strong
							sentiment of evils at home as from a belief that the French movement was
							but a fuller development of the very principles which were partially
							embodied in the British Constitution. They had no longer to choose
							between sympathising with the enemies of England and sympathising with
							the suppressors of the old English liberties.</p>


						<p>But, on the other hand, an opposite change took place. The disappearance
							of the Jacobin movement allowed the Radicalism of home growth to display
							itself more fully. English Whigs of all shades had opposed the war with
							certain misgivings. They had been nervously anxious not to identify
							themselves with the sentiments of the Jacobins. They desired peace with
							the French, but had to protest that it was not for love of French
							principles. That difficulty was removed. There was no longer a vision --
							such as Gillray had embodied in his caricatures -- of a guillotine in
							St. James's Street: or of a Committee of Public Safety formed by Fox,
							Paine, and Horne Tooke. Meanwhile Whig prophecies of the failure of the
							war were not disproved by its results. Though the English navy had been
							victorious, English interference on the Continent had been futile.
							Millions of money had been wasted: and millions were flowing freely.
							Even now we stand astonished at the reckless profusion of the financiers
							of the time. And what was there to show for it? The French empire, so
							far from being destroyed, had been consolidated. If we escaped for the
							time, could we permanently resist the whole power of Europe? When the
							Peninsular War began we had been fighting, except for the short truce of
							Amiens, for sixteen years; and there seemed no reason to believe that
							the expedition to Portugal in 1808 would succeed better than previous
							efforts. The Walcheren expedition of 1809 was a fresh proof of our
							capacity for blundering. Pauperism was still increasing rapidly, and
							forebodings of a war with America beginning to trouble men interested in
							commerce. The English Opposition had ample texts for discourses; and a
							demand for change began to spring up which was no longer a refection of
							foreign sympathies. An article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>
							of January 1808, which professed to demonstrate the hopelessness of the
							Peninsular War, roused the wrath of the Tories. <hi rend="italic">The
								Quarterly Review</hi> was started by Canning and Scott, and the <hi
								rend="italic">Edinburgh,</hi> in return, took a more decidedly Whig
							colour. The Radicals now showed themselves behind the Whigs. Cobbett,
							who had been the most vigorous of John Bull Anti-Jacobins, was driven by
							his hatred of the tax-gatherer and the misery of the agricultural
							labourers into the opposite camp, and his <hi rend="italic"
							>Register</hi> became the most effective organ of Radicalism. demands
							for reform began again to make themselves heard in parliament. Sir
							Francis Burdett, who had sat at the feet of Horne Tooke, and whose
							return with Cochrane for Westminster in 1807 was the first parliamentary
							triumph of the reformers, proposed a motion on 15th June 1809, which
							was, of course, rejected, but which was the first of a series, and
							marked the revival of a serious agitation not to cease till the triumph
							of 1832.</p>


						<p>Meanwhile Bentham, meditating profoundly upon the Panopticoin, had at
							last found out that he had begun at the wrong end. His reasoning had
							been thrown away upon the huge dead weight of official indifference, or
							worse than indifference. Why did they not accept the means for producing
							the greatest happiness of the greatest number? Because statesmen did not
							desire the end. And why not? To answer that question, and to show how a
							government could be constructed which should desire it, became a main
							occupation of Bentham's life. Henceforward, therefore, instead of merely
							treating of penal codes and other special reforms, his attention is
							directed to the previous question of political organisation; while at
							times he diverges to illustrate incidentally the abuses of what he
							ironically calls the 'matchless constitution.' Bentham's principal
							occupation, in a word, was to provide political philosophy for radical
								reformers.<ref target="n5.100">[100]</ref></p>


						<p>Bentham remained as much a recluse as ever. He seldom left Queen's Square
							Place except for certain summer outings. In 1807 he took a house at
							Barrow Green, near Oxted, in Surrey, lying in a picturesque hollow at
							the foot of the chalk hills.<ref target="n5.101">[101]</ref> It was an
							old-fashioned house, standing in what had been a park, with a lake and a
							comfortable kitchen garden. Bentham pottered about in the grounds and
							under the old chestnut-trees, codifying, gardening, and talking to
							occasional disciples. He returned thither in following years; but in
							1814, probably in consequence of his compensation for the Panopticon,
							took a larger place, Ford Abbey, near Chard in Somersetshire. It was a
							superb residence,<ref target="n5.102">[102]</ref> with chapel,
							cloisters, and corridors, a hall eighty feet long by thirty high, and a
							great dining parlour. Parts of the building dated from the twelfth
							century or the time of the Commonwealth, or had undergone alterations
							attributed to Inigo Jones. No Squire Western could have cared less for
							antiquarian associations, but Bentham made a very fair monk. The place,
							for which he paid &#163;315 a year, was congenial. He rode his
							favourite hobby of gardening, and took his regular 'ante-jentacular, and
							'post-prandial' walks, and played battledore and shuttlecock in the
							intervals of codification. He liked it so well that he would have taken
							it for life, but for the loss of &#163;8000 or &#163;10,000 in a
							Devonshire marble-quarry.<ref target="n5.103">[103]</ref> In 1818 he
							gave it up, and thenceforward rarely quitted Queen's Square Place. His
							life was varied by few incidents, although his influence upon public
							affairs was for the first time becoming important. The busier
							journalists and platform orators did not trouble themselves much about
							philosophy. But they were in communication with men of a higher stamp,
							Romilly, James Mill, and others, who formed Bentham's innermost council.
							Thus the movements in the outside world set up an agitation in Bentham's
							study; and the recluse was prompted to set himself to work upon
							elaborating his own theories in various directions, in order to supply
							the necessary substratum of philosophical doctrine. If he had not the
							power of gaining the public ear, his oracles were transmitted through
							the disciples who also converted some of his raw materials into coherent
							books.</p>


						<p>The most important of Bentham's disciples for many years was James Mill,
							and I shall have to say what more is necessary in regard to the active
							agitation when I speak of Mill himself. For the present, it is enough to
							say that Mill first became Bentham's proselyte about 1808. Mill stayed
							with Bentham at Barrow Green and at Ford Abbey. Though some differences
							caused superficial disturbances of their harmony, no prophet could have
							had a more zealous, uncompromising, and vigorous disciple. Mill's force
							of character qualified him to become the leader of the school; but his
							doctrine was always essentially the doctrine of Bentham, and for the
							present he was content to be the transmitter of his master's message to
							mankind. He was at this period a contributor to the <hi rend="italic"
								>Edinburgh Review</hi>; and in October 1809 he inserted some praises
							of Bentham in a review of a book upon legislation by S. Scipion Bexon.
							The article was cruelly mangled by Jeffrey, according to his custom, and
							Jeffrey's most powerful vassal, Brougham, thought that the praises which
							remained were excessive.<ref target="n5.104">[104]</ref></p>


						<p>Obviously the orthodox Whigs were not prepared to swear allegiance to
							Bentham. He was drawing into closer connection with the Radicals. In
							1809 Cobbett was denouncing the duke of York in consequence of the Mrs
							Clarke scandal. Bentham wrote to him, but anonymously and cautiously, to
							obtain documents in regard to a previous libel case,<ref target="n5.105"
								>[105]</ref> and proceeded to write a pamphlet on the <hi
								rend="italic">Elements of the Art of Packing (as applied to Special
								Juries)</hi>, so sharp that his faithful adviser, Romilly, procured
							its suppression for the time.<ref target="n5.106">[106]</ref> Copies,
							however, were printed and privately given to a few who could be trusted.
							Bentham next wrote (1809) a 'Catechism of Parliamentary Reform,' which
							he communicated to Cobbett (16th November 1810), with a request for its
							publication in the <hi rend="italic">Register.</hi><ref target="n5.107"
								>[107]</ref> Cobbett was at this time in prison for his attack upon
							flogging militia men; and, though still more hostile to government, was
							bound to be more cautious in his line of assault. The plan was not
							published, whether because too daring or too dull; but it was apparently
							printed. Bentham's opinion of Cobbett was anything but flattering.
							Cobbett, he thought in 1812, was a 'vile rascal,' and was afterwards
							pronounced to be 'filled with the <hi rend="italic">odium humani
							generis</hi> -- his malevolence and lying beyond everything.'<ref
								target="n5.108">[108]</ref> Cobbett's radicalism, in fact, was of
							the type most hostile to the Utilitarians. John Hunt, in the <hi
								rend="italic">Examiner</hi> was 'trumpeting' Bentham and Romilly in
							1812, and was praised accordingly.<ref target="n5.109">[109]</ref>
							Bentham formed an alliance with another leading Radical. He had made
							acquaintance by 1811 with Sir F. Burdett, to whom he then appealed for
							help in an attack upon the delays of Chancery.<ref target="n5.110"
							>[110]</ref> Burdett, indeed, appeared to him to be far inferior to
							Romilly and Brougham, but he thought that so powerful a 'hero of the
							mob' ought to be turned to account in the good cause.<ref
								target="n5.111">[111]</ref> Burdett seems to have courted the old
							philosopher; and a few years later a closer alliance was brought about.
							The peace of 1815 was succeeded by a period of distress, the more
							acutely felt from the disappointment of natural hopes of prosperity; and
							a period of agitation, met by harsh repression, followed. Applications
							were made to Bentham for permission to use his 'Catechism,' which was
							ultimately published (1818) in a cheap form by Wooler, well known as the
							editor of the democratic <hi rend="italic">Black Dwarf.</hi><ref
								target="n5.112">[112]</ref> Burdett applied for a plan of
							parliamentary reform. Henry Bickersteth (1783-1851), afterwards Lord
							Langdale and Master of the Rolls, at this time a rising barrister of
							high character, wrote an appeal to Bentham and Burdett to combine in
							setting forth a scheme which, with such authority, must command general
							acceptance.</p>


						<p>The result was a series of resolutions moved by Burdett in the House of
							Commons on 2nd June 1818,<ref target="n5.113">[113]</ref> demanding
							universal suffrage, annual parliaments, and vote by ballot. Bentham had
							thus accepted the conclusions reached in a different way by the
							believers in that 'hodge-podge' of absurdities, the declaration of the
							rights of man. Curiously enough, his assault upon that document appeared
							in Dumont's French version in the year 1816, at the very time when he
							was accepting its practical conclusions.</p>


						<p>The schemes in which Mill was interested at this time drew Bentham's
							attention in other directions. In 1813 the Quaker, William Allen, who
							had been a close ally of Mill, induced Bentham to invest money in the
							New Lanark establishment. Owen, whose benevolent schemes had been
							hampered by his partners, bought them out, the new capital being partly
							provided by Allen, Bentham, and others. Bentham afterwards spoke
							contemptuously of Owen, who, as he said, 'began in vapour and ended in
								smoke,'<ref target="n5.114">[114]</ref> and whose disciples came in
							after years into sharp conflict with the Utilitarians. Bentham, however,
							took pleasure, it seems, in Owen's benevolent schemes for infant
							education, and made money by his investment, for once combining business
							with philanthropy successfully.(115*) Probably he regarded New Lanark as
							a kind of Panopticon. Owen had not as yet become a prophet of Socialism.</p>


						<p>Another set of controversies in which Mill and his friends took an active
							part, started Bentham in a whole series of speculations. A plan (which I
							shall have to mention in connection with Mill), was devised in 1815 for
							a 'Chrestomathic school,' which was to give a sound education of proper
							Utilitarian tendencies to the upper and middle classes. Brougham,
							Mackintosh, Ricardo, William Allen, and Place were all interested in
							this undertaking.<ref target="n5.116">[116]</ref> Bentham offered a site
							at Queen's Square Place, and though the scheme never came to the birth,
							it set him actively at work. He wrote a series of papers during his
							first year at Ford Abbey<ref target="n5.117">[117]</ref> upon the theory
							of education, published in 1816 as <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathia</hi>;
							and to this was apparently due a further excursion beyond the limits of
							jurisprudence. Educational controversy in that ignorant day was
							complicated by religious animosity; the National Society and the
							'British and Foreign' Society were fighting under the banners of Bell
							and Lancaster, and the war roused excessive bitterness. Bentham finding
							the church in his way, had little difficulty in discovering that the
							whole ecclesiastical system was part of the general complex of abuse
							against which he was warring. He fell foul of the Catechism; he exposed
							the abuses of non-residence and episcopal wealth; he discovered that the
							Thirty-nine Articles contained gross fallacies; he went on to make an
							onslaught upon the Apostle St Paul, whose evidence as to his conversion
							was exposed to a severe cross-examination; and, finally, he wrote, or
							supplied the materials for, a remarkable <hi rend="italic">Analysis of
								Natural Religion,</hi> which was ultimately published by Grote under
							the pseudonym 'Philip Beauchamp,' in 1822. This procedure from the
							particular case of the Catechism in schools up to the general problem of
							the utility of religion in general, is curiously characteristic of
							Bentham.</p>


						<p>Bentham's mind was attracted to various other schemes by the disciples
							who came to sit at his feet, and professed, with more or less sincerity,
							to regard him as a Solon. Foreigners had been resorting to him from all
							parts of the world, and gave him hopes of new fields for codifying. As
							early as 1808 he had been visited at Barrow Green by the strange
							adventurer, politician, lawyer, and filibuster, Aaron Burr, famous for
							the duel in which he killed Alexander Hamilton, and now framing wild
							schemes for an empire in Mexico. Unscrupulous, restlessly active and
							cynical, he was a singular contrast to the placid philosopher, upon whom
							his confidences seem to have made an impression of not unpleasing
							horror. Burr's conversation suggested to Bentham a singular scheme for
							emigrating to Mexico. He applied seriously for introductions to Lord
							Holland, who had passed some time in Spain, and to Holland's friend,
							Jovellanos (1749-1812), a member of the Spanish Junta, who had written
							treatises upon legislation (1785), of which Bentham approved.<ref
								target="n5.118">[118]</ref> The dream of Mexico was succeeded by a
							dream of Venezuela. General Miranda spent some years in England, and had
							become well known to James Mill. He was now about to start upon an
							unfortunate expedition to Venezuela, his native country. He took with
							him a draft of a law for the freedom of the press, which Bentham drew
							up, and he proposed that when his new state was founded, Bentham should
							be its legislator.<ref target="n5.119">[119]</ref> Miranda was betrayed
							to the Spanish government in 1812, and died (1816) in the hands of the
							Inquisition. Bolivar, who was also in London in 1810 and took some
							notice of Joseph Lancaster, applied in flattering terms to Bentham. Long
							afterwards, when dictator of Columbia, he forbade the use of Bentham's
							works in the schools, to which, however, the privilege of reading him
							was restored, and, let us hope, duly valued, in 1835.<ref
								target="n5.120">[120]</ref> Santander, another South American hero,
							was also a disciple, and encouraged the study of Bentham. Bentham says
							in 1830 that forty thousand copies of Dumont's <hi rend="italic"
								>Trait&eacute;s</hi> had been sold in Paris for the South
							American trade.<ref target="n5.121">[121]</ref> What share Bentham may
							have had in modifying South American ideas is unknown to me. In the
							United States he had many disciples of a more creditable kind than Burr.
							He appealed in 1811 to Madison, then President, for permission to
							construct a 'Pannomion' or complete body of law, for the use of the
							United States; and urged his claims both upon Madison and the Governor
							of Pennsylvania in 1817, when peace had been restored. He had many
							conversations upon this project with John Quincy Adams, who was then
							American minister in England.<ref target="n5.122">[122]</ref> This, of
							course, came to nothing, but an eminent American disciple, Edward
							Livingston (1764-1836), between 1820 and 1830 prepared codes for the
							State of Louisiana, and warmly acknowledged his obligations to
								Bentham.<ref target="n5.123">[123]</ref> In 1830 Bentham also
							acknowledges a notice of his labours, probably resulting from this,
							which had been made in one of General Jackson's presidential
							messages.(124*) In his later years the United States became his ideal,
							and he never tired of comparing its cheap and honest enactment with the
							corruption and extravagance at home.</p>

						<head> V. CODIFICATION.</head>

						<p>The unsettled conditions which followed the peace in various European
							countries found Bentham other employment. In 1809 Dumont did some
							codifying for the Emperor of Russia, and in 1817 was engaged to do the
							same service for Geneva. He was employed for some years, and is said to
							have introduced a Benthamite Penal Code and Panopticon, and an
							application of the Tactics.<ref target="n5.125">[125]</ref> In 1820 and
							1821 Bentham was consulted by the Constitutional party in Spain and
							Portugal, and wrote elaborate tracts for their enlightenment. He made an
							impression upon at least one Spaniard. Borrow, when travelling in Spain
							some ten years after Bentham's death, was welcomed by an Alcalde on Cape
							Finisterre, who had upon his shelves all the works of the 'grand
							Baintham,' and compared him to Solon, Plato, and even Lope de Vega.<ref
								target="n5.126">[126]</ref> The last comparison appeared to Borrow
							to be overstrained. Bentham even endeavoured in 1822-23 to administer
							some sound advice to the government of Tripoli, but his suggestions for
							'remedies against misrule' seem never to have been communicated.<ref
								target="n5.127">[127]</ref> In 1823 and 1824 he was a member of the
							Greek Committee; he corresponded with Mavrocordato and other leaders;
							and he begged Parr to turn some of his admonitions into 'Parrian' Greek
							for the benefit of the moderns.<ref target="n5.128">[128]</ref>
							Blaqui&egrave;re and Stanhope, two ardent members of the committee,
							were disciples; and Stanhope carried with him to Greece Bentham's <hi
								rend="italic">Table of the Springs of Action,</hi> with which he
							tried to indoctrinate Byron. The poet, however, thought with some
							plausibility that he was a better judge of human passions than the
							philosopher. Parry, the engineer, who joined Byron at the same time,
							gives a queer account of the old philosopher trotting about London in
							the service of the Greeks.<ref target="n5.129">[129]</ref> The coarse
							and thoughtless might laugh, and perhaps some neither coarse nor
							thoughtless might smile. But Bowring tells us that these were days of
							boundless happiness for Bentham.<ref target="n5.130">[130]</ref>
							Tributes of admiration were pouring in from all sides, and the true
							Gospel was spreading across the Atlantic and along the shores of the
							Mediterranean.</p>


						<p>At home the Utilitarian party was consolidating itself; and the struggle
							which resulted in the Reform Bill was slowly beginning. The veteran
							Cartwright, Bentham's senior by eight years, tried in 1821 to persuade
							him to come out as one of a committee of 'Guardians of Constitutional
							Reform,' elected at a public meeting.<ref target="n5.131">[131]</ref>
							Bentham wisely refused to be drawn from his privacy. He left it to his
							friends to agitate, while he returned to labour in his study. The demand
							for legislation which had sprung up in so many parts of the world
							encouraged Bentham to undertake the last of his great labours. The
							Portuguese Cortes voted in December 1821 that he should be invited to
							prepare an 'all-comprehensive code'; and in 1822 he put out a curious
							'Codification proposal,' offering to do the work for any nation in need
							of a legislator, and appending testimonials to his competence for the
							work. He set to work upon a 'Constitutional Code,' which occupied him at
							interval during the remainder of his life, and embodied the final
							outcome of his speculations. He diverged from this main purpose to write
							various pamphlets upon topics of immediate interest; and was keenly
							interested in the various activities of his disciples. The Utilitarians
							now thought themselves entitled to enter the field of politics as a
							distinct body. An organ to defend their cause was desirable, and Bentham
							supplied the funds for the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review,</hi> of
							which the first number appeared in April 1824.</p>


						<p>The editorship fell chiefly into the hands of Bowring (1792-1872).
							Bowring had travelled much upon the Continent for a commercial house,
							and his knowledge of Spanish politics had brought him into connection
							with Bentham, to whom Blaqui&egrave;re recommended him in 1820.<ref
								target="n5.132">[132]</ref> A strong attachment sprang up between
							the two. Bentham confided all his thoughts and feelings to the young
							man, and Bowring looked up to his teacher with affectionate reverence.
							In 1828 Bentham says that Bowring is 'the most intimate friend he
								has.'<ref target="n5.133">[133]</ref> Bowring complains of
							calumnies, by which he was assailed, though they failed to alienate
							Bentham. What they may have been matters little; but it is clear that a
							certain jealousy arose between this last disciple and his older rivals.
							James Mill's stern and rigid character had evidently produced some
							irritation at intervals; and to him it would naturally appear that
							Bowring was the object of a senile favouritism. In any case it is to be
							regretted that Bentham thus became partly alienated from his older
								friends.<ref target="n5.134">[134]</ref> Mill was too proud to
							complain; and never wavered in his allegiance to the master's
							principles. But one result, and to us the most important, was that the
							new attachment led to the composition of one of the worst biographies in
							the language, out of materials which might have served for a
							masterpiece. Bowring was a great linguist, and an energetic man of
							business. He wrote hymns, and one of them, 'In the cross of Christ I
							glory,' is said to have 'universal fame.' A Benthamite capable of so
							singular an eccentricity judiciously agreed to avoid discussions upon
							religious topics with his master. To Bowring we also owe the <hi
								rend="italic">Deontology,</hi> which professes to represent
							Bentham's dictation. The Mills repudiated this version, certainly a very
							poor one, of their teacher's morality, and held that it represented less
							Bentham than such an impression of Bentham as could be stamped upon a
							muddle-headed disciple.<ref target="n5.135">[135]</ref></p>


						<p>The last years of his life brought Bentham into closer connection with
							more remarkable men. The Radicals had despised the Whigs as trimmers and
							half-hearted reformers, and James Mill expressed this feeling very
							frankly in the first numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Westminster
								Review.</hi> Reform, however, was now becoming respectable, and the
							Whigs were gaining the courage to take it up seriously. Foremost among
							the Edinburgh Reviewers was the great Henry Brougham, whose fame was at
							this time almost as great as his ambition could desire, and who
							considered himself to be the natural leader of all reform. He had shown
							eagerness to distinguish himself in lines fully approved by Bentham. His
							admirers regarded him as a giant; and his opponents, if they saw in him
							a dash of the charlatan, could not deny his amazing energy and his
							capacity as an orator. The insatiable vanity which afterwards ruined his
							career already made it doubtful whether he fought for the cause or the
							glory. But he was at least an instrument worth having. He was a kind of
							half-disciple. If in 1809 he had checked Mill's praise of Bentham, he
							was soon afterwards in frequent communication with the master. In July
							1812 Bentham announces that Brougham is at last to be admitted to a
							dinner, for which he had been 'intriguing any time this six months,' and
							expects that his proselyte will soon be the first man in the House of
							Commons, and eclipse even Romilly.<ref target="n5.136">[136]</ref> In
							later years they had frequent communications; and when in 1827 Brougham
							was known to be preparing an utterance upon law reform, Bentham's hopes
							rose high. He offered to his disciple 'some nice little sweet pap of my
							own making,' sound teaching that is, upon evidence, judicial
							establishments and codification. Brougham thanks his 'dear grandpapa,'
							and Bentham offers further supplies to his 'dear, sweet little
								poppet.'<ref target="n5.137">[137]</ref> But when the orator had
							spoken Bentham declares (9th February 1828) that the mountain has been
							delivered of a mouse. Brougham was 'not the man to set up' simple and
							rational principles. He was the sham adversary but the real accomplice
							of Peel, pulling up lies by the root to plant others equally
								noxious.<ref target="n5.138">[138]</ref> In 1830 Bentham had even to
							hold up 'Master Peel' as a 'model good boy' to the self-styled reformer.
							Brougham needs a dose of jalap instead of pap, for he cannot even spell
							the 'greatest happiness principle' properly.<ref target="n5.139"
							>[139]</ref> Bentham went so far as to write what he fondly took to be
							an epigram upon Brougham:</p>


						<p>'So foolish and so wise, so great, so small,<lb/> Everything now,
							to-morrow nought at all.'<ref target="n5.140">[140]</ref></p>


						<p>In September 1831 Brougham as Chancellor announced a scheme for certain
							changes in the constitution of the courts. The proposal called forth
							Bentham's last pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">Lord Brougham
								displayed.</hi><ref target="n5.141">[141]</ref> Bentham laments that
							his disciple has 'stretched out the right hand of fellowship to jobbers
							of all sorts.'<ref target="n5.142">[142]</ref> In vain had Brougham in
							his speech called Bentham 'one of the great sages of the law.' Bentham
							acknowledges his amiability and his genius; but laments over the
							untrustworthy character of a man who could only adopt principles so far
							as they were subservient to his own vanity.</p>


						<p>Another light of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> who at this
							time took Brougham at his own valuation, did an incidental service to
							Bentham. Upon the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Book of
							Fallacies</hi> in 1825, Sydney Smith reviewed or rather condensed it in
							the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> and gave the pith of the
							whole in his famous <hi rend="italic">Noodle's Oration.</hi> The noodle
							utters all the commonplaces by which the stupid conservatives, with
							Eldon at their head, met the demands of reformers. Nothing could be
							wittier than Smith's brilliant summary. Whigs and Radicals for the time
							agreed in ridiculing blind prejudice. The day was to come when the Whigs
							at least would see that some principles might be worse than prejudice.
							All the fools, said Lord Melbourne, 'were against Catholic Emancipation,
							and the worst of it is, the fools were in the right.' Sydney Smith was
							glad to be Bentham's mouthpiece for the moment: though, when Benthamism
							was applied to church reform, Smith began to perceive that Noodle was
							not so silly as he seemed.</p>


						<p>One other ally of Bentham deserves notice. O'Connell had in 1828, in
							speaking of legal abuses, called himself 'an humble disciple of the
							immortal Bentham.'<ref target="n5.143">[143]</ref> Bentham wrote to
							acknowledge the compliment. He invited O'Connell to become an inmate of
							his hermitage at Queen's Square Place, and O'Connell responded warmly to
							the letters of his 'revered master.' Bentham's aversion to Catholicism
							was as strong as his objection to Catholic disqualifications, and he
							took some trouble to smooth down the difficulties which threatened an
							alliance between ardent believers and thorough-going sceptics. O'Connell
							had attacked some who were politically upon his side. 'Dan, dear child,'
							says Bentham, 'whom in imagination I am at this moment pressing to my
							fond bosom, put off, if it be possible, your intolerance.'<ref
								target="n5.144">[144]</ref> Their friendship, however, did not
							suffer from this discord, and their correspondence is in the same tone
							till the end. In one of Bentham's letters he speaks of a contemporary
							correspondence with another great man, whom he does not appear to have
							met personally. He was writing long letters, entreating the duke of
							Wellington to eclipse Cromwell by successfully attacking the lawyers.
							The duke wrote 'immediate answers in his own hand,' and took
							good-humouredly a remonstrance from Bentham upon the duel with Lord
							Winchilsea in 1829.<ref target="n5.145">[145]</ref> Bentham was ready to
							the end to seek allies in any quarter. When Lord Sidmouth took office in
							1812, Bentham had an interview with him, and had some hopes of being
							employed to prepare a penal code.<ref target="n5.146">[146]</ref>
							Although experience had convinced him of the futility of expectations
							from the Sidmouths and Eldons, he was always on the look out for
							sympathy; and the venerable old man was naturally treated with respect
							by people who had little enough of real interest in his doctrines.</p>


						<p>During the last ten years of his life, Bentham was cheered by symptoms of
							the triumph of his creed. The approach of the millennium seemed to be
							indicated by the gathering of the various forces which carried Roman
							Catholic Emancipation and the Reform Bill. Bentham still received
							testimonies of his fame abroad. In 1825 he visited Paris to consult some
							physicians. He was received with the respect which the French can always
							pay to intellectual eminence.<ref target="n5.147">[147]</ref> All the
							lawyers in a court of justice rose to receive him, and he was placed at
							the president's right hand. On the revolution of 1830, he addressed some
							good advice to the country of which he had been made a citizen nearly
							forty years before. In 1832, Talleyrand, to whom he had talked about the
							Panopticon in 1792, dined with him alone in his hermitage.<ref
								target="n5.148">[148]</ref> When Bowring observed to the prince that
							Bentham's works had been plundered, the polite diplomatist replied, <hi
								rend="italic">et pill&eacute; de tout le monde, il est toujours
								riche.</hi> Bentham was by this time failing. At eighty-two he was
							still, as he put it, 'codifying like any dragon.'<ref target="n5.149"
								>[149]</ref> On 18th May 1832 he did his last bit of his life-long
							labour, upon the 'Constitutional Code.' The great reform agitation was
							reaching the land of promise, but Bentham was to die in the wilderness.
							He sank without a struggle on 6th June 1832, his head resting on
							Bowring's bosom. He left the characteristic direction that his body
							should be dissected for the benefit of science. An incision was formally
							made; and the old gentleman, in his clothes as he lived, his face
							covered by a wax mask, is still to be seen at University College in
							Gower Street.</p>


						<p>Bentham, as we are told, had a strong personal resemblance to Benjamin
							Franklin. Sagacity, benevolence, and playfulness were expressed in both
							physiognomies. Bentham, however, differed from the man whose intellect
							presents many points of likeness, in that he was not a man of the
							market-place or the office. Bentham was in many respects a child through
								life:<ref target="n5.150">[150]</ref> a child in simplicity, good
							humour, and vivacity; his health was unbroken; he knew no great sorrow;
							and after emerging from the discouragement of his youth, he was placidly
							contemplating a continuous growth of fame and influence. He is said to
							have expressed the wis that he could awake once in a century to
							contemplate th prospect of a world gradually adopting his principles and
							so making steady progress in happiness and wisdom.</p>


						<p>No man could lead a simpler life. His chief luxuries at table were fruit,
							bread, and tea. He had a 'sacred teapot' called Dick, with associations
							of its own, and carefully regulated its functions. He refrained from
							wine during the greatest part of his life, and was never guilty of a
							single act of intemperance. In later life he took a daily half-glass of
							Madeira. He was scrupulously neat in person, and wore a Quaker-like
							brown coat, brown cassimere breeches, white worsted stockings and a
							straw hat. He walked or 'rather trotted' with his stick Dapple, and took
							his 'ante-prandial' and other 'circumgyrations' with absolute
							punctuality. He loved pets; he had a series of attached cats; and
							cherished the memory of a 'beautiful pig' at Hendon, and of a donkey at
							Ford Abbey. He encouraged mice to play in his study -- a taste which
							involved some trouble with his cats, and suggests problems as to the
							greatest happiness of the greatest number. Kindness to animals was an
							essential point of his moral creed. 'I love everything,' he said, 'that
							has four legs.' He had a passion for flowers, and tried to introduce
							useful plants. He loved music -- especially Handel -- and had an organ
							in his house. He cared nothing for poetry: 'Prose,' he said,<ref
								target="n5.151">[151]</ref> 'is when all the lines except the last
							go on to the margin. Poetry is when some of them fall short of it.' He
							was courteous and attentive to his guests, though occasionally irritable
							when his favourite crotchets were transgressed, or especially if his
							fixed hours of work were deranged.</p>


						<p>His regularity in literary work was absolute. He lived by a time-table,
							working in the morning and turning out from ten to fifteen folio pages
							daily. He read the newspapers regularly, but few books, and cared
							nothing for criticisms on his own writings. His only substantial meal
							was a dinner at six or half-past, to which he occasionally admitted a
							few friends as a high privilege. He liked to discuss the topics of which
							his mind was full, and made notes beforehand of particular points to be
							introduced in conversation. He was invariably inaccessible to visitors,
							even famous ones, likely to distract his thoughts. 'Tell Mr Bentham that
							Mr Richard Lovell Edgeworth desires to see him.' 'Tell Mr Richard Lovell
							Edgeworth that Mr Bentham does not desire to see him' was the reply.
							When Mme. de Stael came to England, she said to Dumont: 'Tell Bentham I
							shall see nobody till I have seen him.' 'I am sorry for it,' said
							Bentham, 'for then she will never see anybody.' And he summed up his
							opinion of the famous author of Corinne by calling her 'a trumpery
								magpie.'<ref target="n5.152">[152]</ref> There is a simplicity and
							vivacity about some of the sayings reported by Bowring, which prove that
							Bentham could talk well, and increase our regret for the absence of a
							more efficient Boswell. At ten Bentham had his tea, at eleven his
							nightcap, and by twelve all his guests were ignominiously expelled. He
							was left to sleep on a hard bed. His sleep was light, and much disturbed
							by dreams.</p>


						<p>Bentham was certainly amiable. The 'surest way to gain men,' he said, 'is
							to appear to love them, and the surest way to appear to love them is to
							love them in reality.' The least pleasing part of his character,
							however, is the apparent levity of his attachments. He was, as we have
							seen, partly alienated from Dumont, though some friendly communications
							are recorded in later years, and Dumont spoke warmly of Bentham only a
							few days before his death in 1829.<ref target="n5.153">[153]</ref> He
							not only cooled towards James Mill, but, if Bowring is to be trusted,
							spoke of him with great harshness.<ref target="n5.154">[154]</ref>
							Bowring was not a judicious reporter, indeed, and capable of taking
							hasty phrases too seriously. What Bentham's remarks upon these and other
							friends suggest is not malice or resentment, but the flippant utterance
							of a man whose feelings are wanting in depth rather than kindliness. It
							is noticeable that, after his early visit at Bowood, no woman seems to
							have counted for anything in Bentham's life. He was not only never in
							love, but it looks as if he never even talked to any woman except his
							cook or housemaid.</p>


						<p>The one conclusion that I need draw concerns a question not, I think,
							hard to be solved. It would be easy to make a paradox by calling Bentham
							at once the most practical and most unpractical of men. This is to point
							out the one-sided nature of Bentham's development. Bentham's habits
							remind us in some ways of Kant; and the thought may be suggested that he
							would have been more in his element as a German professor of
							philosophies. In such a position he might have devoted himself to the
							delight of classifying and co-ordinating theories, and have found
							sufficient enjoyment in purely intellectual activity. After a fashion
							that was the actual result. How far, indeed, Bentham could have achieved
							much in the sphere of pure philosophy, and what kind of philosophy he
							would have turned out, must be left to conjecture. The circumstances of
							his time and country, and possibly his own temperament generally, turned
							his thoughts to problems of legislation and politics, that is to say, of
							direct practical interest. He was therefore always dealing with concrete
							facts, and a great part of his writings may be considered as raw
							material for acts of parliament. Bentham remained, however, unpractical,
							in the sense that he had not that knowledge which we ascribe either to
							the Poet or to the man of the world. He had neither the passion nor the
							sympathetic imagination. The springs of active conduct which Byron knew
							from experience were to Bentham nothing more than names in a careful
							classification. Any shrewd attorney or Bow Street runner would have been
							a better judge of the management of convicts; and here were dozens of
							party politicians, such as Rigby and Barr&eacute;, who could have
							explained to him beforehand those mysteries in the working of the
							political machinery, which it took him half a lifetime to discover. In
							this sense Bentham was unpractical in the highest degree, for at eighty
							he had not found out of what men are really made. And yet by his
							extraordinary intellectual activity and the concentration of all his
							faculties upon certain problems, he succeeded in preserving an example,
							and though not a unique yet an almost unsurpassable example, of the
							power which belongs to the man of one idea.</p>

								relating to that state must be finally determined.&quot; So Le
								Mercier de la Rivi&egrave;re says, in 1767, that the ultimate

								(Daire's <hi rend="italic">Economistes,</hi> p. 470). Hutcheson's
									<hi rend="italic">Enquiry concerning Moral Good and Evil,</hi>

								suggested it to Dumont in 1802 as the proper name of the party,
								instead of 'Benhamite' (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> x, 92, 390).
								He afterwards thought it a bad name, because it gave a 'vague idea'
									(<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> x, 582), and substituted

					<div3 type="section" n="1" id="d42">
						<head>I. FIRST PRINCIPLES</head>

						<p>Bentham's position is in one respect unique. There have been many greater
							thinkers; but there has been hardly any one whose abstract theory has
							become in the same degree the platform of an active political party. To
							accept the philosophy was to be also pledged to practical applications
							of Utilitarianism. What, then, was the revelation made to the
							Benthamites, and to what did it owe its influence? The central doctrine
							is expressed in Bentham's famous formula: the test of right and wrong is
							the 'greatest happiness of the greatest number.' There was nothing new
							in this assertion. It only expresses the fact that Bentham accepted one
							of the two alternatives which have commended themselves to conflicting
							schools ever since ethical speculation was erected into a separate
							department of thought. Moreover, the side which Bentham took was, we may
							say, the winning side. The ordinary morality of the time was Utilitarian
							in substance. Hutcheson had invented the sacred phrase: and Hume had
							based his moral system upon 'utility.'<ref target="n6.1">[1]</ref>
							Bentham had learned much from Helv&eacute;tius the French
							freethinker, and had been anticipated by Paley the English divine. The
							writings in which Bentham deals explicitly with the general principles
							of Ethics would hardly entitle him to a higher position than that of a
							disciple of Hume without Hume's subtlety; or of Paley without Paley's
							singular gift of exposition. Why, then, did Bentham's message come upon
							his disciples with the force and freshness of a new revelation? Our
							answer must be in general terms that Bentham founded not a doctrine but
							a method: and that the doctrine which came to him simply as a general
							principle was in his hands a potent instrument applied with most
							fruitful results to questions of immediate practical interest.</p>


						<p>Beyond the general principle of utility, therefore, we have to consider
							the organon, constructed by him to give effect to a general principle
							too vague to be applied in detail. The fullest account of this is
							contained in the <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Principles of
								Morals and Legislation.</hi> This work unfortunately is a fragment,
							but it gives his doctrine vigorously and decisively, without losing
							itself in the minute details which become wearisome in his later
							writings. Bentham intended it as an introduction to a penal code; and
							his investigation sent him back to more general problems. He found it
							necessary to settle the relations of the penal code to the whole body of
							law; and to settle these he had to consider the principles which
							underlie legislation in general. He had thus, he says, to 'create a new
							science,' and then to elaborate one department of the science. The
							'introduction' would contain prolegomena not only for the penal code but
							for the other departments of inquiry which he intended to exhaust.<ref
								target="n6.2">[2]</ref> He had to lay down primary truths which
							should be to this science what the axioms are to mathematical
								sciences.<ref target="n6.3">[3]</ref> These truths therefore belong
							to the sphere of conduct in general, and include his ethical theory.</p>


						<p>'Nature has placed mankind' (that is his opening phrase) 'under the
							governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them
							alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we
							shall do.' there is the unassailable basis. It had been laid down as
							unequivocally by Locke,<ref target="n6.4">[4]</ref> and had been
							embodied in the brilliant couplets of Pope's <hi rend="italic">Essay on
								Man.</hi><ref target="n6.5">[5]</ref> At the head of the curious
							table of universal knowledge, given in the <hi rend="italic"
								>Chrestomathia,</hi> we have Eudaemonics as an all-comprehensive
							name of which every art is a branch.<ref target="n6.6">[6]</ref>
							Eudaemonics, as an art, corresponds to the science 'ontology.' It covers
							the whole sphere of human thought. It means knowledge in general as
							related to conduct. Its first principle, again, requires no more proof
							than the primary axioms of arithmetic or geometry. Once understood, it
							is by the same act of the mind seen to be true. Some people, indeed, do
							not see it. Bentham rather ignores than answers some of their arguments.
							But his mode of treating opponents indicates his own position.
							'Happiness,' it is often said, is too vague a word to be the keystone of
							an ethical system; it varies from man to man: or it is 'subjective,' and
							therefore gives no absolute or independent ground for morality. A
							morality of 'eudaemonism' must be an 'empirical' morality, and we can
							never extort from it that 'categorical imperative,' without which we
							have instead of a true morality a simple system of 'expediency.' From
							Bentham's point of view the criticism must be retorted. He regards
							'happiness' as precisely the least equivocal of words; and 'happiness'
							itself as therefore affording the one safe clue to all the intricate
							problems of human conduct. The authors of the <hi rend="italic"
								>Federalist,</hi> for example, had said that justice was the 'end of
							government.' 'Why not happiness?' asks Bentham. 'What happiness is every
							man knows, because what pleasure is, every man knows, and what pain is,
							every man knows. But what justice is -- this is what on every occasion
							is the subject-matter of dispute.'<ref target="n6.7">[7]</ref> that
							phrase gives his view in a nutshell. Justice is the means, not the end.
							That is just which produces a maximum of happiness. Omit all reference
							to Happiness, and Justice becomes a meaningless word prescribing
							equality, but not telling us equality of what. Happiness, on the other
							hand, has a substantial and independent meaning from which the meaning
							of justice can be deduced. It has therefore a logical priority: and to
							attempt to ignore this is the way to all the labyrinths of hopeless
							confusion by which legislation has been made a chaos. Bentham's position
							is indicated by his early conflict with Blackstone, not a very powerful
							representative of the opposite principle. Blackstone, in fact, had tried
							to base his defence of that eminently empirical product, the British
							Constitution, upon some show of a philosophical groundwork. He had used
							the vague conception of a 'social contract,' frequently invoked for the
							same purpose at the revolution of 1688, and to eke out his arguments
							applied the ancient commonplaces about monarchy, aristocracy, and
							democracy. He thus tried to invest the constitution with the sanctity
							derived from this mysterious 'contract,' while appealing also to
							tradition or the incarnate 'wisdom of our ancestors,' as shown by their
							judicious mixture of the three forms. Bentham had an easy task, though
							he performed it with remarkable vigour, in exposing the weakness of this
							heterogeneous aggregate. Look closely, and this fictitious contract can
							impose no new obligation: for the obligation itself rests upon Utility.
							Why not appeal to Utility at once? I am bound to obey, not because my
							great-grandfather may be regarded as having made a bargain, which he did
							not really make, with the great-grandfather of George III; but simply
							because rebellion does more harm than good. The forms of government are
							abstractions, not names of realities, and their 'mixture' is a pure
							figment. King, Lords, and Commons are not really incarnations of power,
							wisdom, and goodness. Their combination forms a system the merits of
							which must in the last resort be judged by its working. 'It is the
							principle of utility, accurately apprehended and steadily applied, that
							affords the only clew to guide a man through these streights.'<ref
								target="n6.8">[8]</ref> So much in fact Bentham might learn from
							Hume; and to defend upon any other ground the congeries of traditional
							arrangements which passed for the British Constitution was obviously
							absurd. lt was in this warfare against the shifting and ambiguous
							doctrines of Blackstone that Bentham first showed the superiority of his
							own method: for, as between the two, Bentham's position is at least the
							most coherent and intelligible.</p>


						<p>Blackstone, however, represents little more than a bit of rhetoric
							embodying fragments of inconsistent theories. The <hi rend="italic"
								>Morals and Legislation</hi> opens by briefly and contemptuously
							setting aside more philosophical opponents of Utilitarianism. The
							'ascetic' principle, for example, is the formal contradiction of the
							principle of Utility, for it professedly declares pleasure to be evil.
							Could it be consistently carried out it would turn earth into hell. But
							in fact it is at bottom an illegitimate corollary from the very
							principle which it ostensibly denies. It professes to condemn pleasure
							in general; it really means that certain pleasures can only be bought at
							an excessive cost of pain. Other theories are contrivances for avoiding
							the appeal 'to any external standard'; and in substance, therefore, they
							make the opinion of the individual theorist an ultimate and sufficient
							reason. Adam Smith by his doctrine of 'sympathy' makes the sentiment of
							approval itself the ultimate standard. My feeling echoes yours, and
							reciprocally; each cannot derive authority from the other. Another man
							(Hutcheson) invents a thing made on purpose to tell him what is right
							and what is wrong and calls it a 'moral sense.' Beattie substitutes
							'common' for 'moral' sense, and his doctrine is attractive because every
							man supposes himself to possess common-sense. Others, like Price, appeal
							to the Understanding, or, like Clarke, to the 'Fitness of things,' or
							they invent such phrases as 'Law of Nature,' or 'Right Reason' or
							'Natural Justice,' or what you please. Each really means that whatever
							he says is infallibly true and self-evident. Wollaston discovers that
							the only wrong thing is telling a lie; or that when you kill your
							father, it is a way of saying that he is not your father, and the same
							method is applicable to any conduct which he happens to dislike. The
							'fairest and openest of them all' is the man who says, 'I am of the
							number of the Elect'; God tells the Elect what is right: therefore if
							you want to know what is right, you have only to come to me.<ref
								target="n6.9">[9]</ref> Bentham is writing here in his pithiest
							style. His criticism is of course of the rough and ready order; but I
							think that in a fashion he manages to hit the nail pretty well on the
							head.</p>


						<p>His main point, at any rate, is clear. He argues briefly that the
							alternative systems are illusory because they refer to no 'external
							standard.' His opponents, not he, really make morality arbitrary. This,
							whatever the ultimate truth, is in fact the essential core of all the
							Utilitarian doctrine descended from or related to Benthamism. Benthamism
							aims at converting morality into a science. Science, according to him,
							must rest upon facts. It must apply to real things, and to things which
							have definite relations and a common measure. Now, if anything be real,
							pains and pleasures are real. The expectation of pain or pleasure
							determines conduct; and, if so, it must be the sole determinant of
							conduct. The attempt to conceal or evade this truth is the fatal source
							of all equivocation and confusion. Try the experiment. Introduce a
							'moral sense.' What is its relation to the desire for happiness? If the
							dictates of the moral sense be treated as ultimate, an absolutely
							arbitrary element is introduced; and we have One of the 'innate ideas'
							exploded by Locke, a belief summarily intruded into the system without
							definite relations to any other beliefs: a dogmatic assertion which
							refuses to be tested or to be correlated with other dogmas; a reduction
							therefore of the whole system to chaos. It is at best an instinctive
							belief which requires to be justified and corrected by reference to some
							other criterion. Or resolve morality into 'reason,' that is, into some
							purely logical truth, and it then remains in the air -- a mere nonentity
							until experience has supplied some material upon which it can work. Deny
							the principle of utility, in short, as he says in a vigorous
								passage,<ref target="n6.10">[10]</ref> and you are involved in a
							hopeless circle. Sooner or later you appeal to an arbitrary and despotic
							principle and find that you have substituted words for thoughts.</p>


						<p>The only escape from this circle is the frank admission that happiness
							is, in fact, the sole aim of man. There are, of course, different kinds
							of happiness as there are different kinds of physical forces. But the
							motives to action are, like the physical forces, commensurable. Two
							courses of conduct can always be compared in respect of the happiness
							produced, as two motions of a body can be compared in respect of the
							energy expended. If, then, we take the moral judgment to be simply a
							judgment of amounts of happiness, the whole theory can be systematised,
							and its various theorems ranged under a single axiom or consistent set
							of axioms. Pain and pleasure give the real value of actions; they are
							the currency with a definite standard into which every general rule may
							be translated. There is always a common measure applicable in every
							formula for the estimation of conduct. If you admit your Moral Sense,
							you profess to settle values by some standard which has no definite
							relation to the standard which in fact governs the normal transactions.
							But any such double standard, in which the two measures are absolutely
							incommensurable, leads straight to chaos. Or, if again you appeal to
							reason in the abstract, you are attempting to settle an account by pure
							arithmetic without reference to the units upon which your operation is
							performed. Two pounds and two pounds will make four pounds whatever a
							pound may be; but till I know what it is, the result is nugatory.
							Somewhere I must come upon a basis of fact, if my whole construction is
							to stand.</p>


						<p>This is the fundamental position implied in Bentham's doctrine. The moral
							judgment is simply one case of the judgment of happiness. Bentham is so
							much convinced of this that to him there appeared to be in reality no
							other theory. What passed for theories were mere combinations of words.
							Having said this, we know where to lay the foundations of the new
							science. It deals with a vast complicity of facts: it requires
							'investigations as severe as mathematical ones, but beyond all
							comparison more intricate and extensive.'<ref target="n6.11">[11]</ref>
							Still it deals with facts, and with facts which have a common measure,
							and can, therefore, be presented as a coherent system. To present this
							system, or so much of it as is required for purposes of legislation, is
							therefore his next task. The partial execution is the chief substance of
							the <hi rend="italic">Introduction.</hi> Right and wrong conduct, we may
							now take for granted, mean simply those classes of conduct which are
							conducive to or opposed to happiness; or, in the sacred formula, to act
							rightly means to promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number.
							The legislator, like every one else, acts rightly in so far is he is
							guided by the principle (to use one of the phrases joined by Bentham) of
							'maximising' happiness. He seeks to affect conduct; and conduct can be
							affected only by annexing pains or pleasures to given classes of
							actions. Hence we have a vitally important part of his doctrine -- the
							theory of 'sanctions.' Pains and pleasures as annexed to action are
							called 'sanctions.' There are 'physical or natural,' 'political,' 'moral
							or popular,' and 'religious' sanctions. The 'physical' sanctions are
							such pleasures and pains as follow a given course of conduct
							independently of the interference of any other human or supernatural
							being; the 'political' those which are annexed by the action of the
							legislator. The 'moral or popular' those which are annexed by other
							individuals not acting in a corporate capacity; and the 'religious'
							those which are annexed by a 'superior invisible being,' or, as he says
								elsewhere,<ref target="n6.12">[12]</ref> 'such as are capable of
							being expected at the lands of an invisible Ruler of the Universe.' the
							three last sanctions, he remarks, 'operate through the first.' The
							'magistrate' or 'men at large' can only operate, and God is supposed
							only to operate, 'through the powers of nature,' that is, by applying
							some of the pains and pleasures which may also be natural sanctions. A
							man is burnt: if by his own imprudence, that is a 'physical' sanction;
							if by the magistrate, it is a 'political' sanction; if by some neglect
							of his neighbours, due to their dislike of his 'moral character,' a
							'moral' sanction; if by the immediate act of God or by distraction
							caused by dread of God's displeasure, it is a 'religious' sanction. Of
							these, as Bentham characteristically observes<ref target="n6.13"
							>[13]</ref> in later writing the political is much stronger than the
							'moral' or 'religious.' Many men fear the loss of character or the
							'wrath of Heaven,' but all men fear the scourge and the gallows.<ref
								target="n6.14">[14]</ref> He admits, however, that the religious
							sanction and the additional sanction of 'benevolence' have the advantage
							of not requiring that the offender should be found out.<ref
								target="n6.15">[15]</ref> But in any case, the 'natural' and
							religious sanctions are beyond the legislator's power. His problem,
							therefore, is simply this: what sanctions ought he to annex to conduct,
							or remembering that 'ought' means simply 'conducive to happiness,' what
							political sanctions will increase happiness?</p>


						<p>To answer this fully will be to give a complete system of legislation;
							but in order to answer it we require a whole logical and psychological
							apparatus. Bentham shows this apparatus at work, but does not expound
							its origin in any separate treatise. Enough information, however, is
							given as to his method in the curious collection of the fragments
							connected with the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathia.</hi> A logical
							method upon which he constantly insisted is that of 'bipartition,'<ref
								target="n6.16">[16]</ref> called also the 'dichotomous' or
							'bifurcate' method, and exemplified by the stalled 'Porphyrian Tree.'
							The principle is, of course, simple. Take any genus: divide it into two
							classes, one of which has and the other has not a certain mark. The two
							classes must be mutually exclusive and together exhaustive. Repeat the
							operation upon each of the classes and continue the process as long as
								desired.<ref target="n6.17">[17]</ref> At every step you thus have a
							complete enumeration of all the species, varieties, and so on, each of
							which excludes all the others. No mere logic, indeed, can secure the
							accuracy and still less the utility of the procedure. The differences
							may be in themselves ambiguous or irrelevant. If I classify plants as
							'trees' and 'not trees,' the logical form is satisfied: but I have still
							to ask whether 'tree' conveys a determinate meaning, and whether the
							distinction corresponds to a difference of any importance. A perfect
							classification, however, could always be stated in this form. Each
							species, that is, can be marked by the presence or absence of a given
							difference, whether we are dealing with classes of plants or actions:
							and Bentham aims at that consummation though he admits that centuries
							may be required for the construction of an accurate classification in
							ethical speculations.<ref target="n6.18">[18]</ref> He exaggerates the
							efficiency of his method, and overlooks the tendency of tacit
							assumptions to smuggle themselves into what affects to be a mere
							enumeration of classes. But in any case, no one could labour more
							industriously to get every object of his thought arranged and labelled
							and put into the right pigeon-hole of his mental museum. To codify<ref
								target="n6.19">[19]</ref> is to classify, and Bentham might be
							defined as a codifying animal.</p>


						<p>Things thus present themselves to Bentham's mind as already prepared to
							fit into pigeon-holes. This is a characteristic point, and it appears in
							what we must call his metaphysical system. 'Metaphysics,' indeed,
							according to him, is simply 'a sprig,' and that a small one, of the
							'branch termed Logic.'<ref target="n6.20">[20]</ref> It is merely the
							explanation of certain general terms such as 'existence,' 'necessity,'
							and so forth.<ref target="n6.21">[21]</ref> Under this would apparently
							fall the explanation of 'reality' which leads to a doctrine upon which
							he often insists, and which is most implicitly given in the fragment
							called <hi rend="italic">Ontology.</hi> He there distinguishes 'real'
							from 'fictitious entities,' a distinction which, as he tells us,<ref
								target="n6.22">[22]</ref> he first learned from d'Alembert's phrase
								<hi rend="italic">&Ecirc;tres fictifs,</hi> and which he applies
							in his <hi rend="italic">Morals and Legislation.</hi> 'Real entities,'
							according to him,<ref target="n6.23">[23]</ref> are 'individual
							perceptions,' 'impressions,' and 'ideas.' In this, of course, he is
							following Hume, though he applies the Johnsonian argument to Berkeley's
								immaterialism.<ref target="n6.24">[24]</ref> A 'fictitious entity'
							is a name which does not 'raise up in the mind any correspondent
								images.'<ref target="n6.25">[25]</ref> Such names owe their
							existence to the necessities of language. Without employing such
							fictions, however, 'the language of man could not have risen above the
							language of brutes';<ref target="n6.26">[26]</ref> and he emphatically
							distinguishes them from 'unreal' or 'fabulous entities.' A 'fictitious
							entity' is not a 'nonentity.'<ref target="n6.27">[27]</ref> He includes
							among such entities all Aristotle's 'predicaments' except the first:
								'substance.'<ref target="n6.28">[28]</ref> Quantity, quality,
							relation, time, place are all 'physical fictitious entities.' This is
							apparently equivalent to saying that the only 'physical entities' are
							concrete things -- sticks, stones, bodies, and so forth -- the 'reality'
							of which he takes for granted in the ordinary common-sense meaning. It
							is also perfectly true that things are really related, have quantity and
							quality, and are in time and space. But we cannot really conceive the
							quality or relation apart from the concrete things so qualified and
							related. We are forced by language to use substantives which in their
							nature have only the sense of adjectives. He does not suppose that a
							body is not really square or round; but he thinks it a fiction to speak
							of squareness or roundness or space in general as something existing
							apart from matter and, in some sense, alongside of matter.</p>


						<p>This doctrine, which brings us within sight of metaphysical problems
							beyond our immediate purpose, becomes important to his moral
							speculation. His special example of a 'fictitious entity' in politics is
								'obligation.'<ref target="n6.29">[29]</ref> Obligations, rights, and
							similar words are 'fictitious entities.' Obligation in particular
							implies a metaphor. The statement that a man is 'obliged' to perform an
							act means simply that he will suffer pain if he does not perform it. The
							use of the word obligation, as a noun substantive, introduces the
							'fictitious entity' which represents nothing really separable from the
							pain or pleasure. Here, therefore, we have the ground of the doctrine
							already noticed. 'Pains and pleasures' are real.<ref target="n6.30"
							>[30]</ref> 'Their existence,' he says,<ref target="n6.31">[31]</ref>
							'is matter of universal and constant experience.' But other various
							names referring to these: emotion, inclination, vice, virtue, etc., are
							only 'psychological entities.' 'Take away pleasures and pains, not only
							happiness but justice and duty and obligation and virtue -- all of which
							have been so elaborately held up to view as independent of them -- are
							so many empty sounds.'<ref target="n6.32">[32]</ref> The ultimate facts,
							then, are pains and pleasures. They are the substantives of which these
							other words are properly the adjectives. A pain or a pleasure may exist
							by itself, that is without being virtuous or vicious: but virtue and
							vice can only exist in so far as pain and pleasure exists.</p>


						<p>This analysis of 'obligation' is a characteristic doctrine of the
							Utilitarian school. We are under an 'obligation' so far as we are
							affected by a 'sanction.' It appeared to Bentham so obvious as to need
							no demonstration, only an exposition of the emptiness of any verbal
							contradiction. Such metaphysical basis as he needed is simply the
							attempt to express the corresponding conception of reality which, in his
							opinion, only requires to be expressed to carry conviction.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="2" id="d43">
						<head>II. SPRINGS OF ACTION</head>

						<p>Our path is now clear. Pains and pleasures give us what mathematicians
							call the 'independent variable.' Our units are (in Bentham's phrase)
							'lots' of pain or pleasure. We have to interpret all the facts in terms
							of pain or pleasure, and we shall have the materials for what has since
							been called a 'felicific calculus.' To construct this with a view to
							legislation is his immediate purpose. The theory will fall into two
							parts: the 'pathological,' or an account of all the pains and pleasures
							which are the primary data; and the 'dynamical,' or an account of the
							various modes of conduct determined by expectations of pain and
							pleasure. This gives the theory of 'springs of action,' considered in
							themselves, and of 'motives,' that is, of the springs as influencing
								conduct.<ref target="n6.33">[33]</ref> The 'pathology' contains, in
							the first place, a discussion of the measure of pain and pleasure in
							general; secondly, a discussion of the various species of pain and
							pleasure; and thirdly, a discussion of the varying sensibilities of
							different individuals to pain and pleasure.<ref target="n6.34"
							>[34]</ref> Thus under the first head, we are told that the value of a
							pleasure, considered by itself, depends upon its intensity, duration,
							certainty, and propinquity; and, considered with regard to modes of
							obtaining it, upon its fecundity (or tendency to produce other pains and
							pleasures) and its purity (or freedom from admixture of other pains and
							pleasures). The pain or pleasure is thus regarded as an entity which is
							capable of being in some sense weighed and measured.<ref target="n6.35"
								>[35]</ref> The next step is to classify pains and pleasures, which
							though commensurable as psychological forces, have obviously very
							different qualities. Bentham gives the result of his classification
							without the analysis upon which it depends. He assures us that he has
							obtained an 'exhaustive' list of 'simple pleasures.' It must be
							confessed that the list does not commend itself either as exhaustive or
							as composed of 'simple pleasures.' He does not explain the principle of
							his analysis because he says, it was of 'too metaphysical a cast,'<ref
								target="n6.36">[36]</ref> but he thought it so important that he
							published it, edited with considerable modifications by James Mill, in
							1817, as a <hi rend="italic">Table of the Springs of Action.</hi><ref
								target="n6.37">[37]</ref></p>


						<p>J. S. Mill remarks that this table should be studied by any one who would
							understand Bentham's philosophy. Such a study would suggest some
							unfavourable conclusions. Bentham seems to have made out his table
							without the slightest reference to any previous psychologist. It is
							simply constructed to meet the requirements of his legislative theories.
							As psychology it would be clearly absurd, especially if taken as giving
							the elementary or 'simple' feelings. No one can suppose, for example,
							that the pleasures of 'wealth' or 'power' are 'simple' pleasures. The
							classes therefore are not really distinct, and they are as far from
							being exhaustive. All that can be said for the list is that it gives a
							sufficiently long enumeration to call attention from his own point of
							view to most of the ordinary pleasures and pains; and contains. as much
							psychology as he could really turn to account for his purpose.</p>


						<p>The omissions with which his greatest disciple charges him are certainly
							significant. We find, says Mill, no reference to 'Conscience,'
							'Principle,' 'Moral Rectitude,' or 'Moral Duty' among the 'springs of
							action,' unless among the synonyms of a 'love of reputation,' or in so
							far as 'Conscience' and 'Principle' are sometimes synonymous with the
							'religious' motive or the motive of 'sympathy.' So the sense of
							'honour,' the love of beauty, and of order, of power (except in the
							narrow sense of power over our fellows) and of action in general are all
							omitted. We may conjecture what reply Bentham would have made to this
							criticism. The omission of the love of beauty and aesthetic pleasures
							may surprise us when we remember that Bentham loved music, if he cared
							nothing for poetry. But he apparently regarded these as 'complex
								pleasures,'<ref target="n6.38">[38]</ref> and therefore not
							admissible into his table, if it be understood as an analysis into the
							simple pleasures alone. The pleasures of action are deliberately
							omitted, for Bentham pointedly gives the 'pains' of labour as a class
							without corresponding pleasure; and this, though indicative, I think, of
							a very serious error, is characteristic rather of his method of analysis
							than of his real estimate of pleasure. Nobody could have found more
							pleasure than Bentham in intellectual labour, but he separated the
							pleasure from the labour. He therefore thought 'labour,' as such, a pure
							evil, and classified the pleasure as a pleasure of 'curiosity.' But the
							main criticism is more remarkable. Mill certainly held himself to be a
							sound Utilitarian; and yet he seems to be condemning Bentham for
							consistent Utilitarianism. Bentham, by admitting the 'conscience' into
							his simple springs of action, would have fallen into the very circle
							from which he was struggling to emerge. If, in fact, the pleasures of
							conscience are simple pleasures, we have the objectionable 'moral sense'
							intruded as an ultimate factor of human nature. To get rid of that
							'fictitious entity' is precisely Bentham's aim. The moral judgment is to
							be precisely equivalent to the judgment: 'this or that kind of conduct
							increases or diminishes the sum of human pains or pleasures.' Once allow
							that among the pains and pleasures themselves is an ultimate conscience
							-- a faculty not constructed out of independent pains and pleasures --
							and the system becomes a vicious circle. Conscience on any really
							Utilitarian scheme must be a derivative, not an ultimate, faculty. If,
							as Mill seems to say, the omission is a blunder, Bentham's
							Utilitarianism at least must be an erroneous system.</p>

						<p>We have now our list both of pains and pleasures and of the general modes
							of variation by which their value is to be measured. We must also allow
							for the varying sensibilities of different persons. Bentham accordingly
							gives a list of thirty-two 'circumstances influencing sensibility.'<ref
								target="n6.39">[39]</ref> Human beings differ in constitution,
							character, education, sex, race, and so forth, and in their degrees of
							sensibility to all the various classes of pains and pleasures; the
							consideration of these varieties is of the highest utility for the
							purposes of the judge and the legislator.<ref target="n6.40">[40]</ref>
							The 'sanctions' will operate differently in different cases. A blow will
							have different effects upon the sick and upon the healthy; the same fine
							imposed upon the rich and the poor will cause very different pains; and
							a law which is beneficent in Europe may be a scourge in America.</p>


						<p>We have thus our 'pathology' or theory of the passive sensibilities of
							man. We know what are the 'springs of action,' how they vary in general,
							and how they vary from one man to another. We can therefore pass to the
								dynamics.<ref target="n6.41">[41]</ref> We have described the
							machinery in rest, and can now consider it in motion. We proceed as
							before by first considering action in general: which leads to
							consideration of the 'intention' and the 'motive' implied by any
							conscious action: and hence of the relation of these to the 'springs of
							action' as already described. The discussion is minute and elaborate;
							and Bentham improves as he comes nearer to the actual problems of
							legislation and further from the ostensible bases of psychology. The
							analysis of conduct, and of the sanctions by which conduct is modified,
							involves a view of morals and of the relations between the spheres of
							morality and legislation which is of critical importance for the whole
							Utilitarian creed. 'Moral laws' and a 'Positive law' both affect human
							action. How do they differ? Bentham's treatment of the problem shows, I
							think, a clearer appreciation of some difficulties than might be
							inferred from his later utterances. In any case, it brings into clear
							relief a moral doctrine which deeply affected his successors.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="3" id="d44">
						<head>III. THE SANCTIONS</head>

						<p>Let us first take his definitions of the fundamental conceptions. All
							action of reasonable beings implies the expectation of consequences. The
							agent's 'intention' is defined by the consequences actually
							contemplated. The cause of action is the hope of the consequent
							pleasures or the dread of the consequent pains. This anticipated
							pleasure or pain constitutes the 'internal motive' (a phrase used by
							Bentham to exclude the 'external motive' or event which causes the
								anticipation).<ref target="n6.42">[42]</ref> The motive, or
							'internal motive,' is the anticipation of pain to be avoided or pleasure
							to be gained. Actions are good or bad simply and solely as they are on
							the whole 'productive of a balance of pleasure or pain.' The problem of
							the legislator is how to regulate actions so as to incline the balance
							to the right side. His weapons are 'sanctions' which modify 'motives.'
							What motives, then, should be strengthened or checked? Here we must be
							guided by a principle which is, in fact, the logical result of the
							doctrines already laid down. We are bound to apply our 'felicific
							calculus' with absolute impartiality. We must therefore assign equal
							value to all motives. 'No motives,' he says,<ref target="n6.43"
							>[43]</ref> are 'constantly good or constantly bad.' Pleasure is itself
							a good; pain itself an evil: nay, they are 'the only good and the only
							evil.' This is true of every sort of pain and pleasure, even of the
							pains and pleasures of illwill. The pleasures of 'malevolence' are
							placed in his 'table' by the side of pleasures of 'benevolence.' Hence
							it 'follows immediately and incontestably, that there is no such thing
							as any sort of motive that is in itself a bad one.' The doctrine is no
							doubt a logical deduction from Bentham's assumptions, and he proceeds to
							illustrate its meaning. A 'motive' corresponds to one of his 'springs of
							action.' He shows how every one of the motives included in his table may
							lead either to good or to bad consequences. The desire of wealth may
							lead me to kill a man's enemy or to plough his field for him; the fear
							of God may prompt to fanaticism or to charity; illwill may lead to
							malicious conduct or may take the form of proper 'resentment,' as, for
							example, when I secure the punishment of my father's murderer. Though
							one act, he says, is approved and the other condemned, they spring from
							the same motive, namely, illwill.<ref target="n6.44">[44]</ref> He
							admits, however, that some motives are more likely than others to lead
							to 'useful' conduct; and thus arranges them in a certain 'order of
								pre-eminence.'<ref target="n6.45">[45]</ref> It is obvious that
							'goodwill,' 'love of reputation,' and the 'desire of amity' are more
							likely than others to promote general happiness. 'The dictates of
							utility,' as he observes, are simply the 'dictates of the most extensive
							and enlightened (that is, <hi rend="italic">well advised</hi>)
							benevolence.' It would, therefore, seem more appropriate to call the
							'motive' good; though no one doubts that when directed by an erroneous
							judgment it may incidentally be mischievous.</p>


						<p>The doctrine that morality depends upon 'consequences' and not upon
							'motives' became a characteristic Utilitarian dogma, and I shall have to
							return to the question. Meanwhile, it was both a natural and, I think,
							in some senses, a correct view, when strictly confined to the province
							of legislation. For reasons too obvious to expand, the legislator must
							often be indifferent to the question of motives. He cannot know with
							certainty what are a man's motives. He must enforce the law whatever may
							be the motives for breaking it; and punish rebellion, for example, even
							if he attributes it to misguided philanthropy. He can, in any case,
							punish only such crimes as are found out; and must define crimes by
							palpable 'external' marks. He must punish by such coarse means as the
							gallows and the gaol: for his threats must appeal to the good and the
							bad alike. He depends, therefore, upon 'external' sanctions, sanctions,
							that is, which work mainly upon the fears of physical pain; and even if
							his punishments affect the wicked alone, they clearly cannot reach the
							wicked as wicked, nor in proportion to their wickedness. That is quite
							enough to show why in positive law motives are noticed indirectly or not
							at all. It shows also that the analogy between the positive and the
							moral law is treacherous. The exclusion of motive justifiable in law may
							take all meaning out of morality. The Utilitarians, as we shall see,
							were too much disposed to overlook the difference, and attempt to apply
							purely legal doctrine in the totally uncongenial sphere of ethical
							speculation. To accept the legal classification of actions by their
							external characteristics is, in fact, to beg the question in advance Any
							outward criterion must group together actions springing from different
							'motives' and therefore, as other moralists would say, ethically
							different.</p>


						<p>There is, however, another meaning in this doctrine which is more to the
							purpose here. Bentham was aiming at a principle which, true or false, is
							implied in all ethical systems based upon experience instead of pure
							logic or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> 'intuitions.' Such systems must
							accept human nature as a fact, and as the basis of a scientific theory.
							They do not aim at creating angels but at developing the existing
							constitution of mankind. So far as an action springs from one of the
							primitive or essential instincts of mankind, it simply proves the agent
							to be human, not to be vicious or virtuous, and therefore is no ground
							for any moral judgment. If Bentham's analysis could be accepted, this
							would be true of his 'springs of action.' The natural appetites have not
							in themselves a moral quality: they are simply necessary and original
							data in the problem. The perplexity is introduced by Bentham's
							assumption that conduct can be analysed so that the 'motive' is a
							separate entity which can be regarded as the sole cause of a
							corresponding action. That involves an irrelevant abstraction. There is
							no such thing as a single 'motive.' One of his cases is a mother who
							lets her child die for love of 'ease.' We do not condemn her because she
							loves ease, which is a motive common to all men and therefore unmoral,
							not immoral. But neither do we condemn her merely for the bad
							consequences of a particular action. We condemn her because she loves
							ease better than she loves her child: that is, because her whole
							character is 'unnatural' or ill-balanced, not on account of a particular
							element taken by itself. Morality is concerned with concrete human
							beings, and not with 'motives' running about by themselves. Bentham's
							meaning, if we make the necessary correction, would thus be expressed by
							saying that we don't blame a man because he has the 'natural' passions,
							but because they are somehow wrongly proportioned or the man himself
							wrongly constituted. Passions which may make a man vicious may also be
							essential to the highest virtue. That is quite true; but the passion is
							not a separate agent, only one constituent of the character.</p>


						<p>Bentham admits this in his own fashion. If 'motives' cannot be properly
							called good or bad, is there, he asks, nothing good or bad in the man
							who on a given occasion obeys a certain motive? 'Yes, certainly,' he
							replies, 'his disposition.'<ref target="n6.46">[46]</ref> The
							disposition, he adds, is a 'fictitious entity, and designed for the
							convenience of discourse in order to express what there is supposed to
							be permanent in a man's frame of mind.' By 'fictitious,' as we have
							seen, he means not 'unreal' but simply not tangible, weighable, or
							measurable-like sticks and stones, or like pains and pleasures.
							'Fictitious' as they may be, therefore, the fiction enables us to
							express real truths, and to state facts which are of the highest
							importance to the moralist and the legislator. Bentham discusses some
							cases of casuistry in order to show the relation between the tendency of
							an action and the intention and motives of the agent. Ravaillac murders
							a good king; Ravaillac's son enables his father to escape punishment, or
							conveys poison to his father to enable him to avoid torture by
								suicide.<ref target="n6.47">[47]</ref> What is the inference as to
							the son's disposition in either case? The solution (as he substantially
							and, I think, rightly suggests) will have to be reached by considering
							whether the facts indicate that the son's disposition was mischievous or
							otherwise; whether it indicates political disloyalty or filial
							affection, and so forth, and in what proportions. The most interesting
							case perhaps is that of religious persecution, where the religious
							motive is taken to be good, and the action to which it leads is yet
							admitted to be mischievous. The problem is often puzzling, but we are
							virtually making an inference as to the goodness or badness of the
							'disposition' implied by the given action under all the supposed
							circumstances. This gives what Bentham calls the 'meritoriousness'<ref
								target="n6.48">[48]</ref> of the disposition. The 'intention' is
							caused by the 'motive.' The 'disposition' is the 'sum of the
							intentions'; that is to say, it expresses the agent's sensibility to
							various classes of motives; and the merit therefore will be in
							proportion to the total goodness or badness of the disposition thus
							indicated. The question of merit leads to interesting moral problems.
							Bentham, however, observes that he is not here speaking from the point
							of view of the moralist but of the legislator. Still, as a legislator he
							has to consider what is the 'depravity' of disposition indicated by
							different kinds of conduct. This consideration is of great importance.
							The 'disposition' includes sensibility to what he calls 'tutelary
							motives' motives, that is, which deter a man from such conduct as
							generally produces mischievous consequences. No motive can be
							invariably, though some, especially the motive of goodwill, and in a
							minor degree those of 'amity' and a 'love of reputation,' are generally,
							on the right side. The legislator has to reinforce these 'tutelary
							motives' by 'artificial tutelary motives,' and mainly by appealing to
							the 'love of ease,' that is, by making mischievous conduct more
							difficult, and to 'self-preservation,' that is, by making it more
								dangerous.<ref target="n6.49">[49]</ref> He has therefore to measure
							the force by which these motives will be opposed; or, in other words,
							the 'strength of the temptation.' Now the more depraved a man's
							disposition, the weaker the temptation which will seduce him to crime.
							Consequently if an act shows depravity, it will require a stronger
							counter-motive or a more severe punishment, as the disposition indicated
							is more mischievous. An act, for example, which implies deliberation
							proves a greater insensibility to these social motives which, as Bentham
								remarks,<ref target="n6.50">[50]</ref> determine the 'general tenor
							of a man's life,' however depraved he may be. The legislator is guided
							solely by 'utility,' or aims at maximising happiness without reference
							to its quality. Still, so far as action implies disposition, he has to
							consider the depravity as a source of mischief. The legislator who looks
							solely at the moral quality implied is wrong; and, if guided solely by
							his sympathies, has no measure for the amount of punishment to be
							inflicted. These considerations will enable us to see what is the proper
							measure of resentment.<ref target="n6.51">[51]</ref></p>


						<p>The doctrine of the neutrality or 'unmorality' of motive is thus
							sufficiently clear. Bentham's whole aim is to urge that the criterion of
							morality is given by the consequences of actions. To say the conduct is
							good or bad is to say in other words that it produces a balance of
							pleasure or pain. To make the criterion independent, or escape the
							vicious circle, we must admit the pleasures and pains to be in
							themselves neutral; to have, that is, the same value, if equally strong,
							whatever their source. In our final balance-sheet we must set down pains
							of illwill and of goodwill, of sense and of intellect with absolute
							impartiality, and compare them simply in respect of intensity. We must
							not admit a 'conscience' or 'moral sense' which would be autocratic;
							nor, indeed, allow moral to have any meaning as applied to the separate
							passions. But it is quite consistent with this to admit that some
							motives, goodwill in particular, generally tend to bring out the
							desirable result, that is, a balance of pleasure for the greatest
							number. The pains and pleasures are the ultimate facts, and the
							'disposition' is a 'fictitious entity' or a name for the sum of
							sensibilities. It represents the fact that some men are more inclined
							than others to increase the total of good or bad.</p>
					</div3>

					<div3 type="section" n="4" id="d45">
						<head>IV. CRIMINAL LAW</head>

						<p>We have now, after a long analysis, reached the point at which the
							principles can be applied to penal law. The legislator has to discourage
							certain classes of conduct by annexing 'tutelary motives.' The classes
							to be suppressed are of course those which diminish happiness. Pursuing
							the same method, and applying results already reached, we must in the
							first place consider how the 'mischief of an act' is to be measured.<ref
								target="n6.52">[52]</ref> Acts are mischievous as their
							'consequences' are mischievous; and the consequences may be 'primary' or
							'secondary.' Robbery causes pain to the loser of the money. That is a
							primary evil. It alarms the holders of money; it suggests the facility
							of robbery to others; and it weakens the 'tutelary motive' of respect
							for property. These are secondary evils. The 'secondary' evil may be at
							times the most important. The non-payment of a tax may do no appreciable
							harm in a particular case. But its secondary effects in injuring the
							whole political fabric may be disastrous and fruitful beyond
							calculation. Bentham proceeds to show carefully how the 'intentions' and
							'motives' of the evil-doer are of the greatest importance, especially in
							determining these secondary consequences, and must therefore be taken
							into account by the legislator. A homicide may cause the same primary
							evil, whether accidental or malignant; but accidental homicide may cause
							no alarm, whereas the intentional and malignant homicide may cause any
							quantity of alarm and shock to the general sense of security. In this
							way, therefore, the legislator has again indirectly to take into account
							the moral quality which is itself dependent upon utility.</p>


						<p>I must, however, pass lightly over a very clear and interesting
							discussion to reach a further point of primary importance to the
							Utilitarian theory, as to the distinction between the moral and legal
								spheres.<ref target="n6.53">[53]</ref> Bentham has now 'made an
							analysis of evil.' He has, that is, classified the mischiefs produced by
							conduct, measured simply by their effect upon pleasures or pains,
							independently of any consideration as to virtue and vice. The next
							problem is: what conduct should be criminal? -- a subject which is
							virtually discussed in two chapters (xv and xix) 'on cases unmeet for
							punishment' and on 'the limits between Private Ethics and the act of
							legislation.' We must, of course, follow the one clue to the labyrinth.
							We must count all the 'lots' of pain and pleasure indifferently. It is
							clear, on the one hand, that the pains suffered by criminals are far
							less than the pains which would be suffered were no such sanctions
							applied. On the other hand, all punishment is an evil, because
							punishment means pain, and it is therefore only to be inflicted when it
							excludes greater pain. It must, therefore, not be inflicted when it is
							'groundless,' 'inefficacious,' 'unprofitable,' or 'needless.' 'Needless'
							includes all the cases in which the end may be attained 'as effectually
							at a cheaper rate.'<ref target="n6.54">[54]</ref> This applies to all
							'dissemination of pernicious principles'; for in this case reason and
							not force is the appropriate remedy. The sword inflicts more pain, and
							is less efficient than the pen. The argument raises the wider question,
							What are the true limits of legislative interference? Bentham, in his
							last chapter, endeavours to answer this problem. 'Private ethics,' he
							says, and 'legislation' aim at the same end, namely, happiness, and the
							'acts with which they are conversant are <hi rend="italic">in great
								measure</hi> the same.' Why, then, should they have different
							spheres? Simply because the acts 'are not <hi rend="italic">perfectly
								and throughout</hi> the same.'<ref target="n6.55">[55]</ref> How,
							then, are we to draw the line? By following the invariable clue of
							'utility.' We simply have to apply an analysis to determine the cases in
							which punishment does more harm than good. He insists especially upon
							the cases in which punishment is 'unprofitable'; upon such offences as
							drunkenness and sexual immorality, where the law could only be enforced
							by a mischievous or impossible system of minute supervision, and such
							offences as ingratitude or rudeness, where the definition is so vague
							that the judge could not safely be entrusted with the power to
								punish.'<ref target="n6.56">[56]</ref> He endeavours to give a
							rather more precise distinction by sub-dividing 'ethics in general' into
							three classes. Duty may be to oneself, that is 'prudence'; or to one's
							neighbour negatively, that is 'probity'; or to one's neighbour
							positively, that is 'benevolence.'<ref target="n6.57">[57]</ref> Duties
							of the first class must be left chiefly to the individual, because he is
							the best judge of his own interest. Duties of the third class again are
							generally too vague to be enforced by the legislator, though a man ought
							perhaps to be punished for failing to help as well as for actually
							injuring. The second department of ethics, that of 'probity,' is the
							main field for legislative activity.<ref target="n6.58">[58]</ref> As a
							general principle, 'private ethics' teach a man how to pursue his own
							happiness, and the art of legislation how to pursue the greatest
							happiness of the community. It must be noticed, for the point is one of
							importance, that Bentham's purely empirical method draws no definite
							line. It implies that no definite line can be drawn. It does not suggest
							that any kind of conduct whatever is outside the proper province of
							legislator except in so far as the legislative machinery may happen to
							be inadequate or inappropriate.</p>


						<p>Our analysis has now been carried so far that we can proceed to consider
							the principles by which we should be guided in punishing. What are the
							desirable properties of a 'lot of punishment'? This occupies two
							interesting chapters. Chapter xvi, 'on the proportion between
							punishments and offences,' gives twelve rules. The punishment, he urges,
							must outweigh the profit of the offence; it must be such as to make a
							man prefer a less offence to a greater-simple theft, for example, to
							violent robbery; it must be such that the punishment must be adaptable
							to the varying sensibility of the offender; it must be greater in
							'value' as it falls short of certainty; and, when the offence indicates
							a habit, it must outweigh not only the profit of the particular offence,
							but of the undetected offences. In chapter xvii Bentham considers the
							properties which fit a punishment to fulfil these conditions. Eleven
							properties are given. The punishment must be (1) 'variable,' that is,
							capable of adjustment to particular cases; and (2) equable, or
							inflicting equal pain by equal sentences. Thus the 'proportion' between
							punishment and crimes of a given class can be secured. In order that the
							punishments of different classes of crime may be proportional, the
							punishments should (3) be commensurable. To make punishments efficacious
							they should be (4) 'characteristical' or impressive to the imagination;
							and that they may not be excessive they should be (5) exemplary or
							likely to impress others, and (6) frugal. To secure minor ends they
							should be (7) reformatory; (8) disabling, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
							from future offences; and (9) compensatory to the sufferer. Finally, to
							avoid collateral disadvantages they should be (10) popular, and (11)
							remittable. A twelfth property, simplicity, was added in Dumont's
							redaction. Dumont calls attention here to the value of Bentham's
								method.<ref target="n6.59">[59]</ref> Montesquieu and Beccaria had
							spoken in general terms of the desirable qualities of punishment. They
							had spoken of 'proportionality,' for example, but without that precise
							or definite meaning which appears in Bentham's Calculus. In fact,
							Bentham's statement, compared to the vaguer utterances of his
							predecessors, but still more when compared to the haphazard brutalities
							and inconsistencies of English criminal law, gives the best impression
							of the value of his method.</p>


						<p>Bentham's next step is an elaborate classification of offences, worked
							out by a further application of his bifurcatory method.<ref
								target="n6.60">[60]</ref> This would form the groundwork of the
							projected code. I cannot, however, speak of this classification, or of
							many interesting remarks contained in the <hi rend="italic">Principles
								of Penal Law,</hi> where some further details are considered. An
							analysis scarcely does justice to Bentham, for it has to omit his
							illustrations and his flashes of real vivacity. The mere dry logical
							framework is not appetising. I have gone so far in order to illustrate
							the characteristic of Bentham's teaching. It was not the bare appeal to
							utility, but the attempt to follow the clue of utility systematically
							and unflinchingly into every part of the subject. This one doctrine
							gives the touchstone by which every proposed measure is to be tested;
							and which will give to his system not such unity as arises from the
							development of an abstract logical principle, but such as is introduced
							into the physical sciences when we are able to range all the
							indefinitely complex phenomena which arise under some simple law of
							force. If Bentham's aim could have been achieved, 'utility' would have
							been in legislative theories what gravitation is in astronomical
							theories. All human conduct being ruled by pain and pleasure, we could
							compare all motives and actions, and trace out the consequences of any
							given law. I shall have hereafter to consider how this conception worked
							in different minds and was applied to different problems: what were the
							tenable results to which it led, and what were the errors caused by the
							implied overnight of some essential considerations.</p>


						<p>Certain weaknesses are almost too obvious to be specified. He claimed to
							be constructing a science, comparable to the physical sciences. The
							attempt was obviously chimerical if we are to take it seriously. The
							makeshift doctrine which he substitutes for psychology would be a
							sufficient proof of the incapacity for his task. He had probably not
							read such writers as Hartley or Condillac, who might have suggested some
							ostensibly systematic theory. If he had little psychology he had not
							even a conception of 'sociology.' The 'felicific calculus' is enough to
							show the inadequacy of his method. The purpose is to enable us to
							calculate the effects of a proposed law. You propose to send robbers to
							the gallows or the gaol. You must, says Bentham, reckon up all the evils
							prevented: the suffering to the robbed, and to those who expect to be
							robbed, on the one hand; and, on the other, the evils caused, the
							suffering to the robber, and to the tax-payer who keeps the constable;
							then strike your balance and make your law if the evils prevented exceed
							the evils caused. Some such calculation is demanded by plain common
							sense. It points to the line of inquiry desirable. But can it be
							adequate? To estimate the utility of a law we must take into account all
							its 'effects.' What are the 'effects' of a law against robbery? They are
							all that is implied in the security of property. They correspond to the
							difference between England in the eighteenth century and England in the
							time of Hengist and Horsa; between a country where the supremacy of law
							is established, and a country still under the rule of the strong hand.
							Bentham's method may be applicable at a given moment, when the social
							structure is already consolidated and uniform. It would represent the
							practical arguments for establishing the police-force demanded by
							Colquhoun, and show the disadvantages of the old constables and
							watchmen. Bentham, that is, gives an admirable method for settling
							details of administrative and legislative machinery, and dealing with
							particular cases when once the main principles of law and order are
							established. Those principles, too, may depend upon 'utility.' but
							utility must be taken in a wider sense when we have to deal with the
							fundamental questions. We must consider the 'utility' of the whole
							organisation, not the fitness of separate details. Finally, if Bentham
							is weak in psychology and in sociology, he is clearly not satisfactory
							in ethics. Morality is, according to him, on the same plane with law.
							The difference is not in the sphere to which they apply, or in the end
							to which they are directed; but solely in the 'sanction.' The legislator
							uses threats of physical suffering; the moralist threats of 'popular'
							disapproval. Either 'sanction' may be most applicable to a given case;
							but the question is merely between different means to the same end under
							varying conditions. This implies the 'external' character of Bentham's
							morality, and explains his insistence upon the neutrality of motives. He
							takes the average man to be a compound of certain instincts, and merely
							seeks to regulate their action by supplying 'artificial tutelary
							motives.' The 'man' is given; the play of his instincts, separately
							neutral, makes his conduct more or less favourable to general happiness;
							and the moralist and the legislator have both to correct his deviations
							by supplying appropriate 'sanctions.' Bentham, therefore, is inclined to
							ignore the intrinsic character of morality, or the dependence of a man's
							morality upon the essential structure of his nature. He thinks of the
							superficial play of forces, not of their intimate constitution. The man
							is not to be changed in either case; only his circumstances. Such
							defects no doubt diminish the value of Bentham's work. Yet, after all,
							in his own sphere they are trifles. He did very well without philosophy.
							However imperfect his system might be considered as a science or an
							ultimate explanation of society and human nature, it was very much to
							the point as an expression of downright common-sense. Dumont's eulogy
							seems to be fully deserved, when we contrast Bentham's theory of
							punishment with the theories (if they deserve the name) of contemporary
							legislators. His method involved a thoroughgoing examination of the
							whole body of laws, and a resolution to apply a searching test to every
							law. If that test was not so unequivocal or ultimate as he fancied, it
							yet implied the constant application of such considerations as must
							always carry weight, and, perhaps, be always the dominant
							considerations, with the actual legislator or jurist. What is the use of
							you? is a question which may fairly be put to every institution and to
							every law; and it concerns legislators to find some answer, even though
							the meaning of the word 'use' is not so clear as we could wish.</p>

						<head>V. ENGLISH LAW</head>

						<p>The practical value of Bentham's method is perhaps best illustrated by
							his <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Evidence.</hi> The composition of the
							papers ultimately put together by J. S. Mill had occupied Bentham from
							1802 to 1812. The changed style is significant. Nobody could write more
							pointedly, or with happier illustrations, than Bentham in his earlier
							years. He afterwards came to think that a didactic treatise should
							sacrifice every other virtue to fulness and precision. To make a
							sentence precise, every qualifying clause must be somehow forced into
							the original formula. Still more characteristic is his application of
							what he calls the 'substantive-preferring principle.'<ref target="n6.61"
								>[61]</ref> He would rather say, 'I give extension to an object,'
							than 'I extend an object.' Where a substantive is employed, the idea is
							'stationed upon a rock'; if only a verb, the idea is 'like a leaf
							floating on a stream.' A verb, he said,<ref target="n6.62">[62]</ref>
							'slips through your fingers like an eel.' The principle corresponds to
							his 'metaphysics.' The universe of thought is made up of a number of
							separate 'entities' corresponding to nouns-substantive, and when these
							bundles are distinctly isolated by appropriate nouns, the process of
							arranging and codifying according to the simple relations indicated by
							the copula is greatly facilitated. The ideal language would resemble
							algebra, in which symbols, each representing a given numerical value,
							are connected by the smallest possible number of symbols of operation,
							+, -, =, and so forth. To set two such statements side by side, or to
							modify them by inserting different constants, is then a comparatively
							easy process, capable of being regulated by simple general rules.
							Bentham's style becomes tiresome, and was often improperly called
							obscure. It requires attention, but the meaning is never doubtful -- and
							to the end we have frequent flashes of the old vivacity.</p>


						<p>The <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Evidence,</hi> as Mill remarks,<ref
								target="n6.63">[63]</ref> is 'one of the richest in matter of all
							Bentham's productions.' It contains, too, many passages in Bentham's
							earlier style, judiciously preserved by his young editor; indeed, so
							many that I am tempted even to call the book amusing. In spite of the
							wearisome effort to say everything, and to force language into the mould
							presented by his theory, Bentham attracts us by his obvious sincerity.
							The arguments may be unsatisfactory, but they are genuine arguments.
							They represent cOnviction; they are given because they have convinced;
							and no reader can deny that they really tend to convince. We may
							complain that there are too many words, and that the sentences are
							cumbrous; but the substance is always to the point. The main purpose may
							be very briefly indicated. Bentham begins by general considerations upon
							evidence, in which he and his youthful editor indicate their general
							adherence to the doctrines of Hume.<ref target="n6.64">[64]</ref> This
							leads to an application of the methods expounded in the 'Introduction,'
							in order to show how the various motives or 'springs of action' and the
							'sanctions' based upon them may affect the trustworthiness of evidence.
							Any motive whatever may incidentally cause 'mendacity.' The second book,
							therefore, considers what securities may be taken for 'securing
							trustworthiness.' We have, for example, a discussion of the value of
							oaths (he thinks them valueless), of the advantages and disadvantages of
							reducing evidence to writing, of interrogating witnesses, and of the
							publicity or privacy of evidence. Book III deals with the 'extraction of
							evidence.' We have to compare the relative advantages of oral and
							written evidence, the rules for cross-examining witnesses and for taking
							evidence as to their character. Book IV deals with 'pre-appointed
							evidence,' the cases, that is, in which events are recorded at the time
							of occurrenCe with a view to their subsequent use as evidence. We have
							under this head to consider the formalities which should be required in
							regard to contracts and wills; and the mode of recording judicial and
							other official decisions and registering births, deaths, and marriages.
							In Books V and VI we consider two kinds of evidence which is in one way
							or other of inferior cogency, namely, 'circumstantial evidence,' in
							which the evidence if accepted still leaves room for a process of more
							or less doubtful inference; and 'makeshift evidence,' such evidence as
							must sometimes be accepted for want of the best, of which the most
							conspicuous instance is 'hearsay evidence.' Book VII deals with the
							'authentication' of evidence. Book viii is a consideration of the
							'technical' system, that namely which was accepted by English lawyers;
							and finally Book IX deals with a special point, namely, the exclusion of
							evidence. Bentham announces at starting<ref target="n6.65">[65]</ref>
							that he shall establish 'one theorem' and consider two problems. The
							problems are: 'what securities can be taken for the truth of evidence?'
							and 'what rules can be given for estimating the value of evidence?' The
							'theorem' is that no evidence should be excluded with the professed
							intention of obtaining a right decision; though some must be excluded to
							avoid expense, vexation, and delay. This, therefore, as his most
							distinct moral, is fully treated in the last book.</p>


						<p>Had Bentham confined himself to a pithy statement of his leading
							doctrines, and confirmed them by a few typical cases, he would have been
							more effective in a literary sense. His passion for 'codification,' for
							tabulating and arranging facts in all their complexity, and for applying
							his doctrine at full length to every case that he can imagine, makes him
							terribly prolix. On the other hand, this process no doubt strengthened
							his own conviction and the conviction of his disciples as to the value
							of his process. Follow this clue of utility throughout the whole
							labyrinth, see what a clear answer it offers at every point, and you
							cannot doubt that you are in possession of the true compass for such a
							navigation. Indeed, it seems to be indisputable that Bentham's arguments
							are the really relevant and important arguments. How can we decide any
							of the points which come up for discussion? Should a witness be cross
							examined? Should his evidence be recorded? Should a wife be allowed to
							give evidence against her husband? or the defendant to give evidence
							about his own case? These and innumerable other points can only be
							decided by reference to what Bentham understood by 'utility.' This or
							that arrangement is 'useful' because it enables us to get quickly and
							easily at the evidence, to take effective securities for its
							truthfulness, to estimate its relevance and importance, to leave the
							decision to the most qualified persons, and so forth. These points,
							again, can only be decided by a careful appeal to experience, and by
							endeavouring to understand the ordinary play of 'motives' and
							'sanctions.' What generally makes a man lie, and how is lying to be made
							unpleasant? By rigorously fixing our minds at every point on such
							issues, we find that many questions admit of very plain answers, and are
							surprised to discover what a mass of obscurity has been dispelled. It
							is, however, true that although the value of the method can hardly be
							denied unless we deny the value of all experience and common sense, we
							may dispute the degree in which it confirms the general principle. Every
							step seems to Bentham to reflect additional light upon his primary
							axiom. Yet it is possible to hold that witnesses should be encouraged to
							speak the truth, and that experience may help us to discover the best
							means to that end without, therefore, admitting the unique validity of
							the 'greatest happiness' principle. That principle, so far as true, may
							be itself a deduction from some higher principle; and no philosopher of
							any school would deny that 'utility' should be in some way consulted by
							the legislator.</p>


						<p>The book illustrates the next critical point in Bentham's system -- the
							transition from law to politics. He was writing the book at the period
							when the failure of the Panopticon was calling his attention to the
							wickedness of George III and Lord Eldon, and when the English demand for
							parliamentary reform was reviving and supplying him with a sympathetic
							audience. Now, in examining the theory of evidence upon the plan
							described, Bentham found himself at every stage in conflict with the
							existing system, or rather the existing chaos of unintelligible rules.
							English lawyers, he discovered, had worked out a system of rules for
							excluding evidence. Sometimes the cause was pure indolence. 'This man,
							were I to hear him,' says the English judge, 'would come out with a
							parcel of lies. It would be a plague to hear him: I have heard enough
							already; shut the door in his face.'<ref target="n6.66">[66]</ref> But,
							as Bentham shows with elaborate detail, a reason for suspecting evidence
							is not a reason for excluding it. A convicted perjurer gives evidence,
							and has a pecuniary interest in the result. That is excellent ground for
							caution; but the fact that the man makes a certain statement may still
							be a help to the ascertainment of truth. Why should that help be
							rejected? Bentham scarcely admits of any exception to the general rule
							of taking any evidence you can get -- one exception being the rather
							curious one of confession to a Catholic priest; secrecy in such cases is
							on the whole, he thinks, useful. He exposes the confusion implied in an
							exclusion of evidence because it is not fully trustworthy, which is
							equivalent to working in the dark because a partial light may deceive.
							But this is only a part of a whole system of arbitrary, inconsistent,
							and technical rules worked out by the ingenuity of lawyers. Besides the
							direct injury they gave endless opportunity for skilful manoeuvring to
							exclude or admit evidence by adopting different forms of procedure.
							Rules had been made by judges as they were wanted and precedents
							established of contradictory tendency and uncertain application. Bentham
							contrasts the simplicity of the rules deducible from 'utility' with the
							amazing complexity of the traditional code of technical rules. Under the
							'natural' system, that of utility, you have to deal with a quarrel
							between your servants or children. You send at once for the disputants,
							confront them, take any relevant evidence, and make up your mind as to
							the rights of the dispute. In certain cases this 'natural' procedure has
							been retained, as, for example, in courts martial, where rapid decision
							was necessary. Had the technical system prevailed, the country would
							have been ruined in six weeks.<ref target="n6.67">[67]</ref> But the
							exposure of the technical system requires an elaborate display of
							intricate methods involving at every step vexation, delay, and
							injustice. Bentham reckons up nineteen separate devices employed by the
							courts. He describes the elaborate processes which had to be gone
							through before a hearing could be obtained; the distance of courts from
							the litigants; the bandying of cases from court to court; the
							chicaneries about giving notice; the frequent nullification of all that
							had been done on account of some technical flaw; the unintelligible
							jargon of Latin and Law-French which veiled the proceedings from the
							public; the elaborate mysteries of 'special pleading'; the conflict of
							jurisdictions, and the manufacture of new 'pleas' and new technical
							rules; the 'entanglement of jurisdictions,' and especially the
							distinction between law and equity, which had made confusion doubly
							confounded. English law had become a mere jungle of unintelligible
							distinctions, contradictions, and cumbrous methods through which no man
							could find his way without the guidance of the initiated, and in which a
							long purse and unscrupulous trickery gave the advantage over the poor to
							the rich, and to the knave over the honest man. One fruitful source of
							all these evils was the 'judge-made' law, which Bentham henceforth never
							ceased to denounce. His ideal was a distinct code which, when change was
							required, should be changed by an avowed and intelligible process. The
							chaos which had grown up was the natural result of the gradual
							development of a traditional body of law, in which new cases were met
							under cover of applying precedents from previous decisions, with the
							help of reference to the vague body of unwritten or 'common law,' and of
							legal fictions permitting some non-natural interpretation of the old
							formulae. It is the judges, he had already said in 1792,<ref
								target="n6.68">[68]</ref> 'that make the common law.' Do you know
							how they make it? Just as a man makes laws for his dog. When your dog
							does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it and
							then beat him. This is the way you make laws for your dog, and this is
							the Way the judges make laws for you and me.' The 'tyranny of judge-made
							law, is 'the most all-comprehensive, most grinding, and most crying of
							all grievances,'<ref target="n6.69">[69]</ref> and is scarcely less bad
							than 'priest-made religion.'<ref target="n6.70">[70]</ref> Legal
							fictions, according to him, are simply lies. The permission to use them
							is a 'mendacity licence.' In 'Rome-bred law... fiction' is a 'wart which
							here and there disfigures the face of justice. In English law fiction is
							a syphilis which runs into every vein and carries into every part of the
							system the principle of rottenness.'<ref target="n6.71">[71]</ref> The
							evils denounced by Bentham were monstrous.</p>


						<p>The completeness of the exposure was his great merit; and his reputation
							has suffered, as we are told on competent authority, by the very
							efficiency of his attack. The worst evils are so much things of the
							past, that we forget the extent of the evil and the merits of its
							assailant. Bentham's diagnosis of the evil explains his later attitude.
							He attributes all the abuses to consciously corrupt motives even where a
							sufficient explanation can be found in the human stupidity and honest
							incapacity to look outside of traditional ways of thought. He admits,
							indeed, the personal purity of English judges. No English judge had ever
							received a bribe within living memory.<ref target="n6.72">[72]</ref> But
							this, he urges, is only because the judges find it more profitable as
							well as safer to carry out a radically corrupt system. A synonym for
							'technical' is 'fee-gathering.' Lawyers of all classes had a common
							interest in multiplying suits and complicating procedure: and thus a
							tacit partnership had grown up which he describes as 'judge and Co.' He
							gives statistics showing that in the year 1797 five hundred and
							forty-three out of five hundred and fifty 'writs of error' were 'shams,'
							or simply vexatious contrivances for delay, and brought a profit to the
							Chief justice of over &#163;1400.<ref target="n6.73">[73]</ref> Lord
							Eldon was always before him as the typical representative of obstruction
							and obscurantism. In his <hi rend="italic">Indications respecting Lord
								Eldon</hi> (1825) he goes into details which it must have required
							some courage to publish. Under Eldon, he says, 'equity has become an
							instrument of fraud and extortion.'<ref target="n6.74">[74]</ref> He
							details the proceedings by which Eldon obtained the sanction of
							parliament for a system of fee-taking, which he had admitted to be
							illegal, and which had been denounced by an eminent solicitor as leading
							to gross corruption. Bentham intimates that the Masters in Chancery were
								'swindlers,'<ref target="n6.75">[75]</ref> and that Eldon was
							knowingly the protector and sharer of their profits. Romilly, who had
							called the Court of Chancery 'a disgrace to a civilised nation,' had
							said that Eldon was the cause of many of the abuses, and could have
							reformed most of the others. Erskine had declared that if there was a
							hell, the Court of Chancery was hell.<ref target="n6.76">[76]</ref>
							Eldon, as Bentham himself thought, was worse than Jeffreys. Eldon's
							victims had died a lingering death, and the persecutor had made money
							out of their sufferings. Jeffreys was openly brutal; while Eldon covered
							his tyranny under the 'most accomplished indifference.'<ref
								target="n6.77">[77]</ref></p>


						<p>Yet Eldon was but the head of a band. judges, barristers, and solicitors
							were alike. The most hopeless of reforms would be to raise a
							'thorough-paced English lawyer' to the moral level of an average
								man.<ref target="n6.78">[78]</ref> To attack legal abuses was to
							attack a class combined under its chiefs, capable of hoodwinking
							parliament and suppressing open criticism. The slave-traders whom
							Wilberforce attacked were comparatively a powerless excrescence. The
							legal profession was in the closest relations to the monarchy, the
							aristocracy, and the whole privileged and wealthy class. They were
							welded into a solid 'ring.' The king, and his ministers who distributed
							places and pensions; the borough-mongers who sold votes for power; the
							clergy who looked for bishoprics; the monied men who aspired to rank and
							power, were all parts of a league. It was easy enough to talk of law
							reform. Romilly had proposed and even carried a 'reformatiuncle' or
								two;<ref target="n6.79">[79]</ref> but to achieve a serious success
							required not victory in a skirmish or two, not the exposure of some
							abuse too palpable to be openly defended even by an Eldon, but a
							prolonged war against an organised army fortified and entrenched in the
							very heart of the country.</p>

						<head>VI. RADICALISM</head>

						<p>Thus Bentham, as his eyes were opened, became a Radical. The political
							purpose became dominant, although we always see that the legal abuses
							are uppermost in his mind; and that what he really seeks is a fulcrum
							for the machinery which is to overthrow Lord Eldon. Some of the
							pamphlets deal directly with the special instruments of corruption. The
								<hi rend="italic">Elements of the Art of Packing</hi> shows how the
							crown managed to have a permanent body of special 'jurors' at its
							disposal. The 'grand and paramount use'<ref target="n6.80">[80]</ref> of
							this system was to crush the liberty of the press. The obscure law of
							libel, worked by judges in the interest of the government, enabled them
							to punish any rash Radical for 'hurting the feelings' of the ruling
							classes, and to evade responsibility by help of a 'covertly pensioned'
							and servile jury. The pamphlet, though tiresomely minute and
							long-winded, contained too much pointed truth to be published at the
							time. The <hi rend="italic">Official Aptitude minimised</hi> contains a
							series of attacks upon the system of patronage and pensions by which the
							machinery of government was practically worked. In the <hi rend="italic"
								>Catechism</hi> of reformers, written in 1809, Bentham began the
							direct application of his theories to the constitution; and the final
							and most elaborate exposition of these forms the Constitutional Code,
							which was the main work of his later years. This book excited the
							warmest admiration of Bentham's disciples.<ref target="n6.81">[81]</ref>
							J. S. Mill speaks of its 'extraordinary power... of at once seizing
							comprehensive principles and scheming out minute details,' and of its
							'surpassing intellectual vigour.' Nor, indeed, will any one be disposed
							to deny that it is a singular proof of intellectual activity, when we
							remember that it was begun when the author was over seventy, and that he
							was still working at eighty-four.<ref target="n6.82">[82]</ref> In this
							book Bentham's peculiarities of style reach their highest development,
							and it cannot be recommended as light reading. Had Bentham been a
							mystical philosopher, he would, we may conjecture, have achieved a
							masterpiece of unintelligibility which all his followers would have
							extolled as containing the very essence of his teaching. His method
							condemned him to be always intelligible, however crabbed and elaborate.
							Perhaps, however, the point which strikes one most is the amazing
							simple-mindedness of the whole proceeding. Bentham's light-hearted
							indifference to the distinction between paper constitutions and
							operative rules of conduct becomes almost pathetic.</p>


						<p>Bentham was clearly the victim of a common delusion. If a system will
							work, the minutest details can be exhibited. Therefore, it is inferred,
							an exhibition of minute detail proves that it will work. Unfortunately,
							the philosophers of Laputa would have had no more difficulty in filling
							up details than the legislators of England or the United States. When
							Bentham had settled in his 'Radical Reform Bill'<ref target="n6.83"
							>[83]</ref> that the 'voting-box' was to be a double cube of cast-iron,
							with a slit in the lid, into which cards two inches by one, white on one
							side and black on the other, could be inserted, he must have felt that
							he had got very near to actual application: he can picture the whole
							operation and nobody can say that the scheme is impracticable for want
							of working plans of the machinery. There will, doubtless, be no
							difficulty in settling the shape of the boxes, when we have once agreed
							to have the ballot. But a discussion of such remote details of Utopia is
							of incomparably less real interest than the discussion in the <hi
								rend="italic">Rationale of Evidence</hi> of points, which, however
							minute, were occurring every day, and which were really in urgent need
							of the light of common-sense.</p>


						<p>Bentham's general principles may be very simply stated. They are, in
							fact, such as were suggested by his view of legal grievances. Why, when
							he had demonstrated that certain measures would contribute to the
							'greatest happiness of the greatest number,' were they not at once
							adopted? Because the rulers did not desire the greatest happiness of the
							greatest number. This, in Bentham's language, is to say that they were
							governed by a 'sinister interest.' Their interest was that of their
							class, not that of the nation; they aimed at the greatest happiness of
							some, not at the greatest happiness of all. A generalisation of this
							remark gives us the first axioms of all government. There are two
							primary principles: the 'self-preference' principle, in virtue of which
							every man always desires his own greatest happiness; and the 'greatest
							happiness' principle, in virtue of which 'the right and proper end' of
							government is the 'greatest happiness of the greatest number.' <ref
								target="n6.84">[84]</ref> The 'actual end' of every government,
							again, is the greatest happiness of the governors. Hence the whole
							problem is to produce a coincidence of the two ends, by securing an
							identity of interest between governors and governed. To secure that we
							have only to identify the two classes or to put the government in the
							hands of all.<ref target="n6.85">[85]</ref> In a monarchy, the ruler
							aims at the interest of one himself; in a 'limited monarchy' the aim is
							at the happiness of the king and the small privileged class; in a
							democracy, the end is the right one the greatest happiness of the
							greatest number. This is a short cut to all constitutional questions.
							Probably it has occurred in substance to most youthful members of
							debating societies. Bentham's confidence in his logic lifts him above
							any appeal to experience; and he occasionally reminds us of the proof
							given in <hi rend="italic">Martin Chuzzlewit</hi> that the queen must
							live in the Tower of London. The 'monarch,' as he observes,<ref
								target="n6.86">[86]</ref> 'is naturally the very worst -- the most
							maleficent member of the whole community.' Wherever an aristocracy
							differs from the democracy, their judgment will be erroneous.<ref
								target="n6.87">[87]</ref> The people will naturally choose 'morally
							apt agents,' and men who wish to be chosen will desire truly to become
							'morally apt,' for they can only recommend themselves by showing their
							desire to serve the general interest.<ref target="n6.88">[88]</ref> 'All
							experience testifies to this theory,' though the evidence is 'too bulky'
							to be given. Other proofs, however, may at once be rendered superfluous
							by appealing to 'the uninterrupted and most notorious experience of the
							United States.'<ref target="n6.89">[89]</ref> To that happy country he
							often appeals indeed<ref target="n6.90">[90]</ref> as a model
							government. In it, there is no corruption, no useless expenditure, none
							of the evils illustrated by our 'matchless constitution.'</p>


						<p>The constitution deduced from these principles has at least the merit of
							simplicity. We are to have universal suffrage, annual parliaments, and
							vote by ballot. He inclines to give a vote to women.<ref target="n6.91"
								>[91]</ref> There is to be no king, no house of peers, no
							established church. Members of parliament are not to be re-eligible,
							till after an interval. Elaborate rules provide for their regular
							attendance and exclusive devotion to their masters' business. They are
							to be simply 'deputies,' not 'representatives.' They elect a prime
							minister who holds office for four years. Officials are to be appointed
							by a complex plan of competitive examination; and they are to be invited
							to send in tenders for doing the work at diminished salary. When once in
							office, every care is taken for their continual inspection by the public
							and the verification of their accounts. They are never for an instant to
							forget that they are servants, not the masters, of the public.</p>


						<p>Bentham, of course, is especially minute and careful in regard to the
							judicial organisation a subject upon which he wrote much, and much to
							the purpose. The functions and fees of advocates are to be narrowly
							restricted, and advocates to be provided gratuitously for the poor. They
							are not to become judges: to make a barrister a judge is as sensible as
							it would be to select a procuress for mistress of a girls' school.<ref
								target="n6.92">[92]</ref> Judges should be everywhere accessible:
							always on duty, too busy to have time for corruption, and always under
							public supervision. One characteristic device is his quasi-jury. The
							English system of requiring unanimity was equivalent to enforcing
							perjury by torture. Its utility as a means of resisting tyranny would
							disappear when tyranny had become impossible. But public opinion might
							be usefully represented by a 'quasi-jury' of three or five, who should
							not pronounce a verdict, but watch the judge, interrogate, if necessary,
							and in case of need demand a rehearing. Judges, of course, were no
							longer to make law, but to propose amendments in the 'Pannomion' or
							universal code, when new cases arose.</p>


						<p>His leading principle may be described in one word as 'responsibility,'
							or expressed in his leading rule, 'Minimise Confidence.'<ref
								target="n6.93">[93]</ref> 'All government is in itself one vast
								evil.'<ref target="n6.94">[94]</ref> It consists in applying evil to
							exclude worse evil. Even 'to reward is to punish,'<ref target="n6.95"
								>[95]</ref> when reward is given by government. The less government,
							then, the better; but as governors are a necessary evil, they must be
							limited by every possible device to the sole legitimate aim, and watched
							at every turn by the all-seeing eye of public opinion. Every one must
							admit that this is an application of a sound principle, and that one
							condition of good government is the diffusion of universal
							responsibility. It must be admitted, too, that Bentham's theory
							represents a vigorous embodiment and unflinching application of
							doctrines which since his time have spread and gained more general
							authority. Mill says that granting one assumption, the Constitutional
							Code is 'admirable.'<ref target="n6.96">[96]</ref> That assumption is
							that it is for the good of mankind to be under the absolute authority of
							a majority. In other words, it would justify what Mill calls the
							'despotism of public opinion.' To protest against that despotism was one
							of the main purposes of Mill's political writings. How was it that the
							disciple came to be in such direct opposition to his master? That
							question cannot be answered till we have considered Mill's own position.
							But I have now followed Bentham far enough to consider the more general
							characteristics of his doctrine.</p>


						<p>I have tried, in the first place, to show what was the course of
							Bentham's own development; how his observation of certain legal abuses
							led him to attempt the foundation of a science of jurisprudence; how the
							difficulty of obtaining a hearing for his arguments led him to discover
							the power of 'Judge and Co.'; how he found out that behind 'Judge and
							Co.' were George III and the base Sidmouth, and the whole band of
							obstructors entrenched within the 'matchless constitution'; and how thus
							his attack upon the abuses of the penal law led him to attack the whole
							political framework of the country. I have also tried to show how
							Bentham's development coincided with that of the English reformers
							generally. They too began with attacking specific abuses. They were for
							'reform, not revolution.' The constitution satisfied them in the main:
							they boasted of the palladia of their liberties, 'trial by jury' and the
							'Habeas Corpus' Act, and held Frenchmen to be frog-eating slaves in
							danger of lettres de cachet and the Bastille. English public opinion in
							spite of many trammels had a potent influence. Their first impulse,
							therefore, was simply to get rid of the trammels -- the abuses which had
							grown up from want of a thorough application of the ancient principles
							in their original purity. The English Whig, even of the more radical
							persuasion, was profoundly convinced that the foundations were sound,
							however unsatisfactory might be the superstructure. Thus, both Bentham
							and the reformers generally started -- not from abstract principles, but
							from the assault upon particular abuses. This is the characteristic of
							the whole English movement, and gives the meaning of their claim to be
							'practical.' The Utilitarians were the reformers on the old lines; and
							their philosophy meant simply a desire to systematise the ordinary
							common-sense arguments. The philosophy congenial to this vein is the
							philosophy which appeals to experience. Locke had exploded 'innate
							ideas.' They denounced 'intuitions,' or beliefs which might override
							experience as 'innate ideas' in a new dress; and the attempt to carry
							out this view systematically became the distinctive mark of the whole
							school. Bentham accepted, though he did little to elaborate, this
							doctrine. That task remained for his disciples. But the tendency is
							shown by his view of a rival version of Radicalism.</p>


						<p>Bentham, as we have seen, regarded the American Declaration of
							independence as so much 'jargon.' He was entirely opposed to the theory
							of the 'rights of man,' and therefore to the 'ideas of 1789.' From that
							theory the revolutionary party professed to deduce their demands for
							universal suffrage, the levelling of all privileges, and the absolute
							supremacy of the people. Yet Bentham, repudiating the premises, came to
							accept the conclusion. His Constitutional Code scarcely differs from the
							ideal of the Jacobins', except in pushing the logic further. The
							machinery by which he proposed to secure that the so-called rulers
							should become really the servants of the people was more thoroughgoing
							and minutely worked out than that of any democratic constitution that
							has ever been adopted. How was it that two antagonist theories led to
							identical results; and that the 'rights of man,' absurd in philosophy,
							represented the ideal state of things in practice?</p>


						<p>The general answer may be that political theories are not really based
							upon philosophy. The actual method is to take your politics for granted
							on the one side and your philosophy for granted on the other, and then
							to prove their necessary connection. But it is, at any rate, important
							to see what was the nature of the philosophical assumptions implicitly
							taken for granted by Bentham.</p>


						<p>The 'rights of man' doctrine confounds a primary logical canOn with a
							statement of fact. Every political theory must be based upon facts as
							well as upon logic. Any reasonable theory about politics must no doubt
							give a reason for inequality and a reason, too, for equality. The maxim
							that all men were, or ought to be, 'equal' asserts correctly that there
							must not be arbitrary differences. Every inequality should have its
							justification in a reasonable system. But when this undeniable logical
							canon is taken to prove that men actually are equal, there is an obvious
							begging of the question. In point of fact, the theorists immediately
							proceeded to disfranchise half the race on account of sex, and a third
							of the remainder on account of infancy. They could only amend the
							argument by saying that all men were equal in so far as they possessed
							certain attributes. But those attributes could only be determined by
							experience, or, as Bentham would have put it, by an appeal to 'utility.'
							It is illogical, said the anti-slavery advocate, to treat men
							differently On account of the colour of their skins. No doubt it is
							illogical if, in fact, the difference of colour does not imply a
							difference of the powers which fit a man for the enjoyment of certain
							rights. We may at least grant that the burden of proof should be upon
							those who would disfranchise all red-haired men. But this is because
							experience shows that the difference of colour does not mark a relevant
							difference. We cannot say, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> whether the
							difference between a negro and a white man may not be so great as to
							imply incapacity for enjoyment of equal rights. The black skin might --
							for anything a mere logician can say -- indicate the mind of a
							chimpanzee. The case against slavery does not rest on the bare fact that
							negroes and whites both belong to the class 'man,' but on the fact that
							the negro has powers and sensibilities which fit him to hold property,
							to form marriages, to learn his letters, and so forth. But that fact is
							undeniably to be proved, not from the bare logic, but from observation
							of the particular case.</p>


						<p>Bentham saw with perfect clearness that sound political theory requires a
							basis of solid fact. The main purpose of his whole system was to carry
							out that doctrine thoroughly. His view is given vigorously in the
							'Anarchical Fallacies' -- a minute examination of the French Declaration
							of Rights in 1791. His argument is of merciless length, and occasionally
							so minute as to sound like quibbling. The pith, however, is clear
							enough. 'All men are born and remain free and equal in respect of
							rights' are the first words of the Declaration. Nobody is 'born free,'
							retorts Bentham. Everybody is born, and long remains, a helpless child.
							All men born free! Absurd and miserable nonsense! Why, you are
							complaining in the same breath that nearly everybody is a slave.<ref
								target="n6.97">[97]</ref> To meet this objection, the words might be
							amended by substituting 'ought to be' for 'is.' This, however, on
							Bentham's showing, at once introduces the conception of utility, and
							therefore leads to empirical considerations. The proposition, when laid
							down as a logical necessity, claims to be absolute. Therefore it implies
							that all authority is bad; the authority, for example, of parent over
							child, or of husband over wife; and moreover, that all laws to the
							contrary are ipso facto void. That is why it is 'anarchical.' It
							supposes a 'natural right,' not only as suggesting reasons for proposed
							alterations of the legal right, but as actually annihilating the right
							and therefore destroying all government. '<hi rend="italic">Natural
								rights,</hi>' says Bentham,<ref target="n6.98">[98]</ref> is simple
							nonsense; natural and imprescriptible rights 'rhetorical nonsense --
							nonsense upon stilts.' For 'natural right' substitute utility, and you
							have, of course, a reasonable principle, because an appeal to
							experience. But lay down 'liberty' as an absolute right and you
							annihilate law, for every law supposes coercion. One man gets liberty
							simply by restricting the liberty of others.<ref target="n6.99"
							>[99]</ref> What Bentham substantially says, therefore, is that on this
							version absolute rights of individuals could mean nothing but anarchy;
							or that no law can be defended except by a reference to facts, and
							therefore to 'utility.'</p>


						<p>One answer might be that the demand is not for absolute liberty, but for
							as much liberty as is compatible with equal liberty for all. The fourth
							article of the Declaration says: 'Liberty consists in being able to do
							that which is not hurtful to another, and therefore the exercise of the
							natural rights of each man has no other bounds than those which ensure
							to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights.'
							This formula corresponds to a theory held by Mr Herbert Spencer; and, as
							he observes,<ref target="n6.100">[100]</ref> held on different grounds
							by Kant. Bentham's view, indicated by his criticism of this article in
							the 'Anarchical Fallacies,' is therefore worth a moment's notice. The
							formula does not demand the absolute freedom which would condemn all
							coercion and all government; but it still seems to suggest that liberty,
							not utility, is the ultimate end. Bentham's formula, therefore,
							diverges. All government, he holds, is an evil, because coercion implies
							pain. We must therefore minimise, though we cannot annihilate,
							government; but we must keep to utility as the sole test. Government
							should, of course, give to the individual all such rights as are
							'useful'; but it does not follow, without a reference to utility, that
							men should not be restrained even in 'self-regarding' conduct. Some men,
							women, and children require to be protected against the consequences of
							their own 'weakness, ignorance, or imprudence.'<ref target="n6.101"
								>[101]</ref> Bentham adheres, that is, to the strictly empirical
							ground. The absolute doctrine requires to be qualified by a reference to
							actual circumstances: and, among those circumstances, as Bentham
							intimates, we must include the capacity of the persons concerned to
							govern themselves. Carried out as an absolute principle, it would imply
							the independence of infants; and must therefore require some reference
							to 'utility.'</p>


						<p>Bentham, then, objects to the Jacobin theory as too absolute and too
							'individualist.' The doctrine begs the question; it takes for granted
							what can only be proved by experience; and therefore lays down as
							absolute theories which are only true under certain conditions or with
							reference to the special circumstances to which they are applied. That
							is inconsistent with Bentham's thoroughgoing empiricism. But he had
							antagonists to meet upon the other side: and, in meeting them, he was
							led to a doctrine which has been generally condemned for the very same
							faults -- as absolute and individualist. We have only to ask in what
							sense Bentham appealed to 'experience' to see how he actually reached
							his conclusions. The adherents of the old tradition appealed to
							experience in their own way. The English people, they said, is the
							freest, richest, happiest in the world; it has grown up under the
							British Constitution: therefore the British Constitution is the best in
							the world, as Burke tells you, and the British common law, as Blackstone
							tells you, is the 'perfection of wisdom.' Bentham's reply was virtually
							that although he, like Burke, appealed to experience, he appealed to
							experience scientifically organised, whereas Burke appealed to mere
							blind tradition. Bentham is to be the founder of a new science, founded
							like chemistry on experiment, and his methods are to be as superior to
							those of Burke as those of modern chemists to those of the alchemists
							who also invoked experience. The true plan was not to throw experience
							aside because it was alleged by the ignorant and the prejudiced, but to
							interrogate experience systematically, and so to become the Bacon or the
							Newton of legislation, instead of wandering off into the <hi
								rend="italic">a priori</hi> constructions of a Descartes or a
							Leibniz.</p>


						<p>Bentham thus professes to use an 'inductive' instead of the deductive
							method of the Jacobins; but reaches the same practical conclusions from
							the other end. The process is instructive. He objected to the existing
							inequalities, not as inequalities simply, but as mischievous
							inequalities. He, as well as the Jacobins, would admit that inequality
							required justification; and he agreed with them that, in this case,
							there was no justification. The existing privileges did not promote the
							'greatest happiness of the greatest number.' The attack upon the
							'Anarchical Fallacies' must be taken with the <hi rend="italic">Book of
								Fallacies,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Book of Fallacies</hi> is
							a sustained and vigorous, though a curiously cumbrous, assault upon the
							Conservative arguments. Its pith may be found in Sydney Smith's <hi
								rend="italic">Noodle's Oration</hi>; but it is itself well worth
							reading by any one who can recognise really admirable dialectical power,
							and forgive a little crabbedness of style in consideration of genuine
							intellectual vigour. I only notice Bentham's assault upon the 'wisdom of
							our ancestors.' After pointing out how much better we are entitled to
							judge now that we have got rid of so many superstitions, and have
							learned to read and write, he replies to the question, 'Would you have
							us speak and act as if we never had any ancestors?' 'By no means,' he
							replies; 'though their opinions were of little value, their practice is
							worth attending to; but chiefly because it shows the bad consequences of
							their opinions.' 'From foolish opinion comes foolish conduct; from
							foolish conduct the severest disaster; and from the severest disaster
							the most useful warning. It is from the folly, not from the wisdom, of
							our ancestors that we have so much to learn.'<ref target="n6.102"
							>[102]</ref> Bentham has become an 'ancestor,' and may teach us by his
							errors. Pointed and vigorous as is his exposure of many of the
							sophistries by which Conservatives defended gross abuses and twisted the
							existence of any institution into an argument for its value, we get some
							measure from this of Bentham's view of history. In attacking an abuse,
							he says, we have a right to inquire into the utility of any and every
							arrangement. The purpose of a court of justice is to decide litigation;
							it has to ascertain facts and apply rules: does it then ascertain facts
							by the methods most conducive to the discovery of truth? Are the rules
							needlessly complex, ambiguous, calculated to give a chance to knaves, or
							to the longest purse? If so, undoubtedly they are mischievous. Bentham
							had done inestimable service in stripping away all the disguises and
							technical phrases which had evaded the plain issue, and therefore made
							of the laws an unintelligible labyrinth. He proceeded to treat in the
							same way of government generally. Does it work efficiently for its
							professed ends? Is it worked in the interests of the nation, or of a
							special class, whose interests conflict with those of the nation? He
							treated, that is, of government as a man of business might investigate a
							commercial undertaking. If he found that clerks were lazy, ignorant,
							making money for themselves, or bullying and cheating the customers, he
							would condemn the management. Bentham found the 'matchless constitution'
							precisely in this state. He condemned political institutions worked for
							the benefit of a class, and leading, especially in legal matters, to
							endless abuses and chicanery. The abuses everywhere imply 'inequality'
							in some sense; for they arise from monopoly. The man who holds a
							sinecure, or enjoys a privilege, uses it for his own private interest.
							The 'matter of corruption,' as Bentham called it, was provided by the
							privilege and the sinecure. The Jacobin might denounce privileges simply
							as privileges, and Bentham denounce them because they were used by the
							privileged class for corrupt purposes. So far, Bentham and the Jacobins
							were quite at one. It mattered little to the result which argument they
							preferred to use, and without doubt they had a very strong case, and did
							in fact express a demand for justice and for a redress of palpable
							evils. The difference seems to be that in one case the appeal is made in
							the name of justice and equality; in the other case, in the name of
							benevolence and utility.</p>


						<p>The important point here, however, is to understand Bentham's implicit
							assumptions. J. S. Mill, in criticising his master, points out very
							forcibly the defects arising from Bentham's attitude to history. He
							simply continued, as Mill thinks, the hostility with which the critical
							or destructive school of the eighteenth century regarded their
							ancestors. To the revolutionary party history was a record of crimes and
							follies and of little else. The question will meet us again; and here it
							is enough to ask what is the reason of his tacit implication of
							Bentham's position. Bentham.s whole aim, as I have tried to show, was to
							be described as the construction of a science of legislation. The
							science, again, was to be purely empirical. It was to rest throughout
							upon the observation of facts. That aim -- an admirable aim -- runs
							through his whole work and that of his successors. I have noticed,
							indeed, how easily Bentham took for granted that his makeshift
							classification of common motives amounted to a scientific psychology. A
							similar assumption that a rough sketch of a science is the same thing as
							its definite constitution is characteristic of the Utilitarians in
							general. A scientific spirit is most desirable; but the Utilitarians
							took a very short cut to scientific certainty. Though appealing to
							experience, they reach formula as absolute as any 'intuitionist' could
							desire. What is the logical process implied? To constitute an empirical
							science is to show that the difference between different phenomena is
							due simply to 'circumstances.' The explanation of the facts becomes
							sufficient when the 'law' can be stated, as that of a unit of constant
							properties placed in varying positions. This corresponds to the
							procedure in the physical sciences, where the Ultimate aim is to
							represent all laws as corresponding to the changes of position of
							uniform atoms. In social and political changes the goal is the same. J.
							S. Mill states in the end of his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi>
							<ref target="n6.103">[103]</ref> that one main purpose of his writing
							was to show that 'differences between individuals, races, or sexes' are
							due to 'differences in circumstances.' In fact, this is an aim so
							characteristic from the beginning of the whole school, that it may be
							put down almost as a primary postulate. It was not, indeed, definitely
							formulated; but to 'explain' a social theorem was taken to be the same
							thing as to show how differences of character or conduct could be
							explained by 'circumstance' -- meaning by 'circumstance' something not
							given in the agent himself. We have, however, no more right as good
							empiricists to assert than to deny that all difference comes from
							'circumstance.' If we take 'man' as a constant quantity in our
							speculations, it requires at least a great many precautions before we
							can assume that our abstract entity corresponds to a real concrete unit.
							Otherwise we have a short cut to a doctrine of 'equality.' The theory of
							'the rights of man' lays down the formula, and assumes that the facts
							will correspond. The Utilitarian assumes the equality of fact, and of
							course brings out an equally absolute formula. 'Equality,' in some
							sense, is introduced by a side wind, though not explicitly laid down as
							an axiom.<ref target="n6.104">[104]</ref> This underlying tendency may
							partly explain the coincidence of results -- though it would require a
							good many qualifications in detail; but here I need only take Bentham's
							more or less unconscious application.</p>


						<p>Bentham's tacit assumption, in fact, is that there is an average 'man.'
							Different specimens of the race, indeed, may vary widely according to
							age, sex, and so forth; but, for purposes of legislation, he may serve
							as a unit. We can assume that he has on the average certain qualities
							from which his actions in the mass can be determined with sufficient
							accuracy, and we are tempted to assume that they are mainly the
							qualities obvious to an inhabitant of Queen's Square Place about the
							year 1800. Mill defends Bentham against the charge that he assumed his
							codes to be good for all men everywhere. To that, says Mill,<ref
								target="n6.105">[105]</ref> the essay upon the 'Influence of Time
							and Place in Matters of Legislation' is a complete answer. Yet Mill <ref
								target="n6.106">[106]</ref> admits in the same breath that Bentham
							omitted all reference to 'national character.' In fact, as we have seen,
							Bentham was ready to legislate for Hindoostan as well as for his own
							parish; and to make codes not only for England, Spain, and Russia, but
							for Morocco. The Essay mentioned really explains the point. Bentham not
							only admitted but asserted as energetically as became an empiricist,
							that we must allow for 'circumstances'; and circumstances include not
							only climate and so forth, but the varying beliefs and customs of the
							people under consideration. The real assumption is that all such
							circumstances are superficial, and can be controlled and altered
							indefinitely by the 'legislator.' The Moor, the Hindoo, and the
							Englishman are all radically identical; and the differences which must
							be taken into account for the moment can be removed by judicious means.
							Without pausing to illustrate this from the Essay, I may remark that for
							many purposes such an assumption is justifiable and guides ordinary
							common sense. If we ask what would be the best constitution for a
							commercial company, or the best platform for a political party, we can
							form a fair guess by arguing from the average of Bentham and his
							contemporaries -- especially if we are shrewd attorneys or political
							wirepullers. Only we are not therefore in a position to talk about the
							'science of human nature' or to deal with problems of 'sociology.' This,
							however, gives Bentham's 'individualism' in a sense of the phrase
							already explained. He starts from the 'ready-made man,' and deduces all
							institutions or legal arrangements from his properties. I have tried to
							show how naturally this view fell in with the ordinary political
							conceptions of the time. It shows, again, why Bentham disregards
							history. When we have such a science, empirical or a <hi rend="italic"
								>priori,</hi> history is at most of secondary importance. We can
							deduce all our maxims of conduct from the man himself as he is before
							us. History only shows how terribly he blundered in the pre-scientific
							period. The blunders may give us a hint here and there. Man was
							essentially the same in the first and the eighteenth century, and the
							differences are due to the clumsy devices which he made by rule of
							thumb. We do not want to refer to them now, except as illustrations of
							errors. We may remark how difficult it was to count before the present
							notation was invented; but when it has once been invented, we may learn
							to use it without troubling our heads about our ancestors' clumsy
							contrivances for doing without it. This leads to the real shortcoming.
							There is a point at which the historical view becomes important -- the
							point, namely, where it is essential to remember that man is not a
							ready-made article, but the product of a long and still continuing
							'evolution.' Bentham's attack (in the <hi rend="italic">Fragment</hi>)
							upon the 'social contract' is significant. He was, no doubt, perfectly
							right in saying that an imaginary contract could add no force to the
							ultimate grounds for the social union. Nobody would now accept the
							fiction in that stage. And yet the 'social contract' may be taken to
							recognise a fact; namely, that the underlying instincts upon which
							society alternately rests correspond to an order of reasons from those
							which determine more superficial relations. Society is undoubtedly
							useful, and its utility may be regarded as its ground. But the utility
							of society means much more than the utility of a railway company or a
							club, which postulates as existing a whole series of already established
							institutions. To Bentham an 'utility' appeared to be a kind of permanent
							and ultimate entity which is the same at all periods -- it corresponds
							to a psychological currency of constant value. To show, therefore, that
							the social contract recognises 'utility' is to show that the whole
							organism is constructed just as any particular part is constructed. Man
							comes first and 'society' afterwards. I have already noticed how this
							applies to his statements about the utility of a law; how his argument
							assumes an already constituted society, and seems to overlook the
							difference between the organic law upon which all order essentially
							depends, and some particular modification or corollary which may be
							superinduced. We now have to notice the political version of the same
							method. The 'law,' according to Bentham, is a rule enforced by a
							'sanction.' The imposer of the rule in the phrase which Hobbes had made
							famous is the 'sovereign.' Hobbes was a favourite author, indeed, of the
							later Utilitarians, though Bentham does not appear to have studied him.
							The relation is one of natural affinity. When in the <hi rend="italic"
								>Constitutional Code</hi> Bentham transfers the 'sovereignty' from
							the king to the 'people,' <ref target="n6.107">[107]</ref> he shows the
							exact difference between his doctrine and that of the Leviathan. Both
							thinkers are absolutists in principle, though Hobbes gives to a monarch
							the power which Bentham gives to a democracy. The attributes remain
							though their subject is altered. The 'sovereign,' in fact, is the
							keystone of the whole Utilitarian system. He represents the ultimate
							source of all authority, and supplies the motive for all obedience. As
							Hobbes put it, he is a kind of mortal God.</p>


						<p>Mill's criticism of Bentham suggests the consequences. There are, he
								says,<ref target="n6.108">[108]</ref> three great questions: What
							government is for the good of the people? How are they to be induced to
							obey it? How is it to be made responsible? The third question, he says,
							is the only one seriously considered. by Bentham; and Bentham's answer,
							we have seen, leads to that 'tyranny of the majority' which was Mill's
							great stumbling-block. Why, then, does Bentham omit the other questions?
							or rather, how would he answer them? for he certainly assumes an answer.
							People, in the first place, are 'induced to obey' by the sanctions. They
							don't rob that they may not go to prison. That is a sufficient answer at
							a given moment. It assumes, indeed, that the law will be obeyed. The
							policeman, the gaoler, and the judge will do what the sovereign --
							whether despot or legislature -- orders them to do. The jurist may
							naturally take this for granted. He does not go 'behind the law.' That
							is the law which the sovereign has declared to be the law. In that
							sense, the sovereign is omnipotent. He can, as a fact, threaten
							evildoers with the gallows; and the jurist simply takes the fact for
							granted, and assumes that the coercion is an ultimate fact. No doubt it
							is ultimate for the individual subject. The immediate restraint is the
							policeman, and we need not ask upon what does the policeman depend. If,
							however, we persist in asking, we come to the historical problems which
							Bentham simply omits. The law itself, in fact, ultimately rests upon
							'custom,' -- upon the whole system of instincts, beliefs, and passions
							which induce people to obey government, and are, so to speak, the
							substance out of which loyalty and respect for the law is framed. These,
							again, are the product of an indefinitely long elaboration, which
							Bentham takes for granted. He assumes as perfectly natural and obvious
							that a number of men should meet, as the Americans or frenchmen met, and
							create a constitution. That the possibility of such a proceeding
							involves centuries of previous training does not occur to him. It is
							assumed that the constitution can be made out of hand, and this
							assumption is of the highest importance, not only historically but for
							immediate practice. Mill assumes too easily that Bentham has secured
							responsibility. Bentham assumes that an institution will work as it is
							intended to work -- perhaps the commonest error of constitution-mongers.
							If the people use the instruments which he provides, they have a legal
							method for enforcing obedience. To infer that they will do so is to
							infer that all the organic instincts will operate precisely as he
							intends; that each individual, for example, will form an independent
							opinion upon legislative questions, vote for men who will apply his
							opinions, and see that his representatives perform his bidding honestly.
							That they should do so is essential to his scheme; but that they will do
							so is what he takes for granted. He assumes, that is, that there is no
							need for inquiring into the social instincts which lie beneath all
							political action. You can make your machine and assume the moving force.
							That is the natural result of considering political and legislative
							problems without taking into account the whole character of the human
							materials employed in the construction. Bentham's sovereign is thus
							absolute. He rules by coercion, as a foreign power may rule by the sword
							in a conquered province. Thus, force is the essence of government, and
							it is needless to go further. To secure the right application of the
							force, we have simply to distribute it among the subjects. Government
							still means coercion, and ultimately nothing else; but then, as the
							subjects are simply moved by their own interests, that is, by utility,
							they will apply the power to secure those interests. Therefore, all that
							is wanted is this distribution, and Mill's first problem, What
							government is for the good of the people? is summarily answered. The
							question, how obedience is to be secured, is evaded by confining the
							answer to the 'sanctions,' and taking for granted that the process of
							distributing power is perfectly simple, or that a new order can be
							introduced as easily as parliament can pass an act for establishing a
							new police in London. The 'social contract' is abolished; but it is
							taken for granted that the whole power of the sovereign can be
							distributed, and rules made for its application by the common sense of
							the various persons interested. Finally, the one bond outside of the
							individual is the sovereign. He represents all that holds society
							together; his 'sanctions,' as I have said, are taken to be on the same
							plane with the 'moral sanctions' -- not dependent upon them, but other
							modes of applying similar motives. As the sovereign, again, is in a
							sense omnipotent, and yet can be manufactured, so to speak, by voluntary
							arrangements among the individual members of society, there is no limit
							to the influence which he may exercise. I note, indeed, that I am
							speaking rather of the tendencies of the theory than of definitely
							formulated conclusions. Most of the Utilitarians were exceedingly
							shrewd, practical people, whose regard for hard facts imposed limits
							upon their speculations. They should have been the last people to
							believe too implicitly in the magical efficacy of political
							contrivances, for they were fully aware that many men are knaves and
							most men fools. They probably put little faith in Bentham's Utopia,
							except as a remote ideal, and an ideal of unimaginative minds. The
							Utopia was constructed on 'individualist' principles, because
							common-sense naturally approves individualism. The whole social and
							political order is clearly the sum of the individuals, who combine to
							form an aggregate; and theories about social bonds take one to the
							mystical and sentimental. The absolute tendency is common to Bentham and
							the Jacobins. Whether the individual be taken as a unit of constant
							properties, or as the subject of absolute rights, we reach equally
							absolute conclusions. When all the social and political regulations are
							regarded as indefinitely modifiable, the ultimate laws come to depend
							upon the absolute framework of unalterable fact. This, again, is often
							the right point of view for immediate questions in which we may take for
							granted that the average individual is in fact constant; and, as I have
							said in regard to Bentham's legislative process, leads to very relevant
							and important, though not ultimate, questions. But there are certain
							other results which require to be noticed. 'Individualism,' like other
							words that have become watchwords of controversy, has various shades of
							meaning, and requires a little more definition.</p>

						<head>VII. INDIVIDUALISM</head>


						<p>'Individualism' in the first place is generally mentioned in a different
							connection. The 'ready-made' man of whom I have spoken becomes the
							'economic man.' Bentham himself contributed little to economic theory.
							His most important writing was the <hi rend="italic">Defence of
							Usury,</hi> and in this, as we have seen, he was simply adding a
							corollary to the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations.</hi> The <hi
								rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi> itself represented the spirit
							of business; the revolt of men who were building up a vast industrial
							system against the fetters imposed by traditional legislation and by
							rulers who regarded industry in general, as Telford is said to have
							regarded rivers. Rivers were meant to supply canals, and trade to supply
							tax-gatherers. With this revolt, of course, Bentham was in full
							sympathy, but here I shall only speak of one doctrine of great interest,
							which occurs both in his political treatises and his few economical
							remarks. Bentham objected, as we have seen, to the abstract theory of
							equality. Yet it was to the mode of deduction rather than to the
							doctrine itself which he objected. He gave, in fact, his own defence;
							and it is one worth notice.<ref target="n6.109">[109]</ref> The
							principle of equality is derivative, not ultimate. Equality is good
							because equality increases the sum of happiness. Thus, as he says,<ref
								target="n6.110">[110]</ref> if two men have &#163;1000, and you
							transfer &#163;500 from one to the other, you increase the
							recipient's wealth by one-third, and diminish the loser's wealth by
							one-half. You therefore add less pleasure than you subtract. The
							principle is given less mathematically(111*) by the more significant
							argument that 'felicity' depends not simply on the 'matter of felicity'
							or the stimulus, but also on the sensibility to felicity which is
							necessarily limited. Therefore by adding wealth -- taking, for example,
							from a thousand labourers to give to one king -- you are supersaturating
							a sensibility already glutted by taking away from others a great amount
							of real happiness. With this argument, which has of late years become
							conspicuous in economics, he connects another of primary importance. The
							first condition of happiness, he says, is not 'equality' but 'security.'
							Now you can only equalise at the expense of security. If I am to have my
							property taken away whenever it is greater than my neighbour's, I can
							have no security.<ref target="n6.112">[112]</ref> Hence, if the two
							principles conflict, equality should give way. Security is the primary,
							which must override the secondary, aim. Must the two principles, then,
							always conflict? No; but 'time is the only mediator.'<ref
								target="n6.113">[113]</ref> The law may help to accumulate
							inequalities; but in a prosperous state there is a 'continual progress
							towards equality.' The law has to stand aside; not to maintain
							monopolies; not to restrain trade; not to permit entails; and then
							property will diffuse itself by a natural process, already exemplified
							in the growth of Europe. The 'pyramids' heaped up in feudal times have
							been lowered, and their '<hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi> spread
							abroad' among the industrious. Here again we see how Bentham virtually
							diverges from the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> school. Their absolute
							tendencies would introduce 'equality' by force; he would leave it to the
							spontaneous progress of security. Hence Bentham is in the main an
							adherent of what he calls <ref target="n6.114">[114]</ref> the '<hi
								rend="italic">laissez-nous faire</hi>' principle. He advocates it
							most explicitly in the so-called <hi rend="italic">Manual of Political
								Economy</hi> -- a short essay first printed in 1798.<ref
								target="n6.115">[115]</ref> The tract, however, such as it is, is
							less upon political economy proper than upon economic legislation; and
							its chief conclusion is that almost all legislation is improper. His
							main principle is 'Be quiet' (the equivalent of the French phrase, which
							surely should have been excluded from so English a theory). Security and
							freedom are all that industry requires; and industry should say to
							government only what Diogenes said to Alexander, 'Stand out of my
								sunshine.'<ref target="n6.116">[116]</ref></p>


						<p>Once more, however, Bentham will not lay down the 'let alone' principle
							absolutely. His adherence to the empirical method is too decided. The
							doctrine 'be quiet,' though generally true, rests upon utility, and may,
							therefore, always be qualified by proving that in a particular case the
							balance of utility is the other way. In fact, some of Bentham's
							favourite projects would be condemned by an absolute adherent of the
							doctrine. The Panopticon, for example, though a 'mill to grind rogues
							honest' could be applied to others than rogues, and Bentham hoped to
							make his machinery equally effective in the case of pauperism. A system
							of national education is also included in his ideal constitution. It is,
							in fact, important to remember that the 'individualism' of Benthamism
							does not necessarily coincide with an absolute restriction of government
							interference. The general tendency was in that direction; and in purely
							economical questions, scarcely any exception was admitted to the rule.
							Men are the best judges, it was said, of their own interest; and the
							interference of rulers in a commercial transaction is the interference
							of people inferior in knowledge of the facts, and whose interests are
							'sinister' or inconsistent with those of the persons really concerned.
							Utility, therefore, will, as a rule, forbid the action of government:
							but, as utility is always the ultimate principle, and there may be cases
							in which it does not coincide with the 'let alone' principle, we must
							always admit the possibility that in special cases government can
							interfere usefully, and, in that case, approve the interference.</p>


						<p>Hence we have the ethical application of these theories. The
							individualist position naturally tends to take the form of egoism. The
							moral sentiments, whatever they may be, are clearly an intrinsic part of
							the organic social instincts. They are intimately involved in the whole
							process of social evolution. But this view corresponds precisely to the
							conditions which Bentham overlooks. The individual is already there. The
							moral and the legal sanctions are 'external'; something imposed by the
							action of others; corresponding to 'coercion,' whether by physical force
							or the dread of public opinion; and, in any case, an accretion or
							addition, not a profound modification of his whole nature. The
							Utilitarian 'man' therefore inclines to consider other people as merely
							parts of the necessary machinery. Their feelings are relevant only as
							influencing their outward conduct. If a man gives me a certain 'lot' of
							pain or pleasure, it does not matter what may be his motives. The
							'motive' for all conduct corresponds in all cases to the pain or
							pleasure accruing to the agent. It is true that his happiness will be
							more or less affected by his relations to others. But as conduct is
							ruled by a calculation of the balance of pains or pleasures dependent
							upon any course of action, it simplifies matters materially, if each man
							regards his neighbour's feelings simply as instrumental, not
							intrinsically interesting. And thus the coincidence between that conduct
							which maximises my happiness and that conduct which maximises happiness
							in general, must be regarded as more or less accidental or liable in
							special cases to disappear. If I am made happier by action which makes
							others miserable, the rule of utility will lead to my preference of
							myself.</p>


						<p>Here we have the question whether the Utilitarian system be essentially a
							selfish system. Bentham, with his vague psychology, does not lay down
							the doctrine absolutely. After giving this list of self-regarding
							'springs of action,' he proceeds to add the pleasures and pains of
							'sympathy' and 'antipathy' which, he says, are not self-regarding.
							Moreover, as we have seen, he has some difficulty in denying that
							'benevolence' is a necessarily moral motive: it is only capable of
							prompting to bad conduct in so far as it is insufficiently enlightened;
							and it is clear that a moralist who makes the 'greatest happiness of the
							greatest number' his universal test, has some reason for admitting as an
							elementary pleasure the desire for the greatest happiness. This comes
							out curiously in the <hi rend="italic">Constitutional Code</hi>. He
							there lays down the 'self-preference principle' -- the principle,
							namely, that 'every human being' is determined in every action by his
							judgment of what will produce the greatest happiness to himself,
							'whatsoever be the effect... in relation to the happiness of other
							similar beings, any or all of them taken together.'<ref target="n6.117"
								>[117]</ref> Afterwards, however, he observes that it is 'the
							constant and arduous task or every moralist' and of every legislator who
							deserves the name to 'increase the influence of sympathy at the expense
							of that of self-regard and of sympathy for the greater number at the
							expense of sympathy for the lesser number.'<ref target="n6.118"
							>[118]</ref> He tries to reconcile these views by the remark 'that even
							sympathy has its root in self-regard,' and he argues, as Mr Herbert
							Spencer has done more fully, that if Adam cared only for Eve and Eve
							only for Adam -- neither caring at all for himself or herself -- both
							would perish in less than a year. Self-regard, that is, is essential,
							and sympathy supposes its existence. Hence Bentham puts himself through
							a catechism.<ref target="n6.119">[119]</ref> What is the 'best'
							government? That which causes the greatest happiness of the given
							community. What community? 'Any community, which is as much as to say,
							every community.' But <hi rend="italic">why</hi> do you desire this
							happiness? Because the establishment of that happiness would contribute
							to <hi rend="italic">my</hi> greatest happiness. And <hi rend="italic"
								>how</hi> do you prove that you desire this result? By my labours to
							obtain it, replies Bentham. This oddly omits the more obvious question,
							how can you be sure that your happiness will be promoted by the greatest
							happiness of all? What if the two criteria differ? I desire the general
							happiness, he might have replied, because my benevolence is an original
							or elementary instinct which can override my self-love; or I desire it,
							he would perhaps have said, because I know as a fact that the happiness
							of others will incidentally contribute to my own. The first answer would
							fall in with some of his statements; but the second is, as I think must
							be admitted, more in harmony with his system. Perhaps, indeed, the most
							characteristic thing is Bentham's failure to discuss explicitly the
							question whether human action is or is not necessarily 'selfish.' He
							tells us in regard to the 'springs of action' that all human action is
							always 'interested,' but explains that the word properly includes
							actions in which the motive is not 'self-regarding.'<ref target="n6.120"
								>[120]</ref> It merely means, in fact, that all conduct has motives.
							The statement which I have quoted about the 'self-preference' principle
							may only mean a doctrine which is perfectly compatible with a belief in
							'altruism' -- the doctrine, namely, that as a fact most people are
							chiefly interested by their own affairs. The legislator, he tells us,
							should try to increase sympathy, but the less he takes sympathy for the
							'basis of his arrangements' -- that is, the less call he makes upon
							purely unselfish motives -- the greater will be his success.<ref
								target="n6.121">[121]</ref> This is a shrewd and, I should say, a
							very sound remark, but it implies -- not that all motives are selfish in
							the last analysis, but -- that the legislation should not assume too
							exalted a level of ordinary morality. The utterances in the very
							unsatisfactory <hi rend="italic">Deontology</hi> are of little value,
							and seem to imply a moral sentiment corresponding to a petty form of
							commonplace prudence.<ref target="n6.122">[122]</ref></p>


						<p>Leaving this point, however, the problem necessarily presented itself to
							Bentham in a form in which selfishness is the predominating force, and
							any recognition of independent benevolence rather an incumbrance than a
							help. If we take the 'self-preference principle' absolutely, the
							question becomes how a multitude of individuals, each separately
							pursuing his own happiness, can so arrange matters that their joint
							action may secure the happiness of all. Clearly a man, however selfish,
							has an interest generally in putting down theft and murder. He is
							already provided with a number of interests to which security, at least,
							and therefore a regular administration of justice, is essential. His
							shop could not be carried on without the police; and he may agree to pay
							the expenses, even if others reap the benefit in greater proportion. A
							theory of legislation, therefore, which supposes ready formed all the
							instincts which make a decent commercial society possible can do without
							much reference to sympathy or altruism. Bentham's man is not the
							colourless unit of <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> writing, nor the
							noble savage of Rousseau, but the respectable citizen with a policeman
							round the corner. Such a man may well hold that honesty is the best
							policy; he has enough sympathy to be kind to his old mother, and help a
							friend in distress; but the need of romantic and elevated conduct rarely
							occurs to him; and the heroic, if he meets it, appears to him as an
							exception, not far removed from the silly. He does not reflect --
							especially if he cares nothing for history -- how even the society in
							which he is a contented unit has been built up, and how much loyalty and
							heroism has been needed for the work; nor even, to do him justice, what
							unsuspected capacities may lurk in his own commonplace character. The
							really characteristic point is, however, that Bentham does not clearly
							face the problem. He is content to take for granted as an ultimate fact
							that the self-interest principle in the long run coincides with the
							greatest 'happiness' principle, and leaves the problem to his
							successors. There we shall meet it again.</p>


						<p>Finally, Bentham's view of religion requires a word. The short reply,
							however, would be sufficient, that he did not believe in any theology,
							and was in the main indifferent to the whole question till it
							encountered him in political matters. His first interest apparently was
							roused by the educational questions which I have noticed, and the
							proposal to teach the catechism Bentham, remembering the early bullying
							at Oxford, examines the catechism; and argues in his usual style that to
							enforce it is to compel children to tell lies. But this leads him to
							assail the church generally; and he regards the church simply as a part
							of the huge corrupt machinery which elsewhere had created Judge and Co.
							He states many facts about non-residence and bloated bishoprics which
							had a very serious importance; and he then asks how the work might be
							done more cheaply. As a clergyman's only duty is to read weekly services
							and preach sermons, he suggests (whether seriously may be doubted) that
							this might be done as well by teaching a parish boy to read properly,
							and provide him with the prayer-book and the homilies.<ref
								target="n6.123">[123]</ref> A great deal of expense would be saved.
							This, again, seems to have led him to attack St. Paul, whom he took to
							be responsible for dogmatic theology, and therefore for the catechism;
							and he cross-examines the apostle, and confronts his various accounts of
							the conversion with a keenness worthy of a professional lawyer. In one
							of the MSS. at University College the same method is applied to the
							gospels. Bentham was clearly not capable of anticipating Renan. From
							these studies he was led to the far more interesting book, published
							under the name of <hi rend="italic">Philip Beauchamp.</hi> Bentham
							supplied the argument in part; but to me it seems clear that it owes so
							much to the editor, Grote, that it may more fitly be discussed
							hereafter.</p>


						<p>The limitations and defects of Bentham's doctrine have been made
							abundantly evident by later criticism. They were due partly to his
							personal character, and partly to the intellectual and special
							atmosphere in which he was brought up. But it is more important to
							recognise the immense real value of his doctrine. Briefly, I should say,
							that there is hardy an argument in Bentham's voluminous writings which
							is not to the purpose so far as it goes. Given his point of view, he is
							invariably cogent and relevant. And, moreover, that is a point of view
							which has to be taken. No ethical or political doctrine can, as I hold,
							be satisfactory which does not find a place for Bentham, though he was
							far, indeed, from giving a complete theory of his subject. And the main
							reason of this is that which I have already indicated. Bentham's whole
							life was spent in the attempt to create a science of legislation. Even
							where he is most tiresome, there is a certain interest in his unflagging
							working out of every argument, and its application to all conceivable
							cases. It is all genuine reasoning; and throughout it is dominated by a
							respect for good solid facts. His hatred of 'vague generalities'<ref
								target="n6.124">[124]</ref> means that he will be content with no
							formula which cannot be interpreted in terms of definite facts. The
							resolution to insist upon this should really be characteristic of every
							writer upon similar subjects, and no one ever surpassed Bentham in
							attention to it. Classify and reclassify, to make sure that at every
							point your classes correspond to realities. In the effort to carry out
							these principles, Bentham at least brought innumerable questions to a
							sound test, and exploded many pestilent fallacies. If he did not succeed
							further, if whole spheres of thought remained outside of his vision, it
							was because in his day there was not only no science of 'sociology' or
							psychology -- there are no such sciences now -- but no adequate
							perception of the vast variety of investigation which would be necessary
							to lay a basis for them. But the effort to frame a science is itself
							valuable, indeed of surpassing value, so far as it is combined with a
							genuine respect for facts. It is common enough to attempt to create a
							science by inventing technical terminology. Bentham tried the far wider
							and far more fruitful method of a minute investigation of particular
							facts. His work, therefore, will stand, however different some of the
							results may appear when fitted into a different framework. And,
							therefore, however crudely and imperfectly, Bentham did, as I believe,
							help to turn speculation into a true and profitable channel. Of that,
							more will appear hereafter; but, if any one doubts Bentham's services, I
							will only suggest to him to compare Bentham with any of his British
							contemporaries, and to ask where he can find anything at all comparable
							to his resolute attempt to bring light and order into a chaotic infusion
							of compromise and prejudice.</p>

							<p>It is not worth while to consider this at length; but I give the
								following conjectural account of the list as it appears in the <hi
									rend="italic">Morals and Legislation</hi> above. In classifying
								pain or pleasure, Bentham is, I think, following the clue suggested
								by his 'sanctions'. He is realy classifying according to their
								causes or the way in which they are 'annexed'. Thus pleasure may or
								may not be dependent upon other persons, or if upon other persons,
								may be indirectly or directly caused by their pleasures or pains.
								Pleasures not caused by persons correspond to the 'physical
								sanction', and are those (1) of the 'senses', (2) of wealth, i.e.,
								caused by the possession of things, and (3) of 'skill', i.e., caused
								by our ability to use things. Pleasures caused by persons indirectly
								correspond first to the 'popular or moral sanction,' and are
								pleasures (4) of 'amity', caused by the goodwill of individuals, and
								(5) of a 'good name', caused by the goodwill of people in general;
								secondly, to 'political sanction,' namely (6) pleasures of 'power';
								and thirdly, to the 'religious sanction,' or (7) pleasures of
								'piety'. All these are 'self-regarding pleasures.' The pleasures
								caused directly by the pleasures of others are those (8) of
								'benevolence', and (9) of malevolence. We then have what is really a
								cross division of classes of 'deriviative' pleasures; these being
								due to (10) memory, (11) imagination, (12) expectation, (13)
								association. To each class of pleasures corresponds a class of
								pains, except that there are no pains corresponding to the pleasures
								of wealth or power. We have, however, a general class of pains of
								'privation', which might include pairs of poverty or weakness: and
								to these are opposed (14) pleasures of 'relief', i.e., of the
								privation of pains. In the Table, as separately published, Bentham
								modified this by dividing pleasures of 'curiosity' for pleasures of
								'skill', by suppressing pleasures of relief and pains of privation;
								and by adding, as a class of 'pains' without corresponding
								pleasures, pains (1) of labour, (2) of 'death, and bodily pains in
								general.' These changes seem to have been introduced in the course
								of writing his Introduction, where they are partly assumed. Another
								class is added to include all classes of 'self-regarding pleasures
								or pains.' He is trying to give a list of all 'synomyms' for various
								pains and pleasures, and has therefore to admit classes
								corresponding to general names which include other classes.</p>

							<p>Here Bentham lays down the rule that punishment should rise with the
								strength of the temptation, a theory which leads to some curious
								casuistical problems. He does not fully discuss, and I cannot here
								consider, them. I will only note that it may conceivably be
								necessary to increase the severity of punishment, instead of
								removing the temptation or strengthening the preventive action. If
								so, the law becomes immoral in the sense of punishing more severly
								as the crime has more moral excuse. This was often true of the old
								criminal law, which punished offences cruelly because it had no
								effective system of police. Bentham would of course have agreed that
								the principle in this case was a bad one.</p>

								ends at Botany Bay (i, 118), giving the lowest kind of prudential
								morality. The manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Deontology,</hi>
								now in University College, London, seems to prove that Bentham was
								substantially the author, though the Mills seem to have suspected
								Bowring of adulterating the true doctrine. He appears to have been
								an honest if not very intelligent editor; though the rewriting,
								necessary in all Bentham's works, was damaging in this case; and he
								is probably responsible for some rhetorical amplification,
								especially in the later part.</p>

				<head>NOTE ON BENTHAM'S WRITINGS</head>

				<p>The following account of Bentham's writings may be of some use. The arrangement
					is intended to show what were the topics which attracted his attention at
					successive periods.</p>


				<p>The Collected <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> edited by Bowring, appeared from 1838
					to 1843 in eleven volumes, the last two containing the life and an elaborate
					index. The first nine volumes consist partly of the works already published;
					partly of works published for the first time from Bentham's MSS.; and partly of
					versions of Dumont's redactions of Bentham. Dumont's publications were <hi
						rend="italic">(1) Trait&eacute;s de Legislation civile et
						p&eacute;nale (1802; second edition, revised, 1820): [vol. i, contains
						Principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de Legislation and Principes du
						Code civil; vol. ii, Principes du Code p&eacute;nal; and vol. iii,
						M&eacute;moire sur le Panoptique, De la Promulgation des Lais, De
						l'Influence du Temps et des Lieux, and Vue g&eacute;n&eacute;rale
						d'un Corps complet des Lois]; (2) Tactiques des Assembl&eacute;es
						d&eacute;liberantes et Trait&eacute; des Sophismes politiques, 1816;
						(4) Trait&eacute; des Preuves judiciares, 1823; and (5) De
						l'Organisation judicaire et de la Codification, 1823.</hi></p>


				<p>In the following I give reference to the place of each work in Bowring's edition.</p>


				<p>Bentham's first book was the <hi rend="italic">Fragment on Government,</hi> 1776
					(i. 221-295). An interesting 'historical preface', intended for a second edition
					(i. 240-259), was first printed in 1828. The Fragment, edited by Mr F.C.
					Montague, was republished in 1891.</p>


				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Principles of Morals and
					Legislation</hi> was published in 1789, in one vol. 4to. (i. 1-154). It had been
					printed in 1780. A second edition, in two vols, 8vo, appeared in 1823. It was
					intended as an introduction to the plan of a penal code. Bentham says in his
					preface that his scheme would be completed by a series of works applying his
					principles to (1) civil law; (2) penal law; (3) procedure; (4) reward; (5)
					constitutional law; (6) political tactics; (7) international law; (8) finance;
					and (9) political economy,and by a tenth treatise giving a plan fo a body of law
					'considered in respect of its form,' that is, upon 'nomography.' He wrote more
					or less in the course of his life upon all these topics. Dumont's
					Trait&eacute;s of 1802 were based partly upon the Introduction and partly
					upon Bentham's MSS. corresponding to unfinished parts of this general scheme.</p>


				<p>The two first section of this scheme are represented in the <hi rend="italic"
						>Works</hi> by <hi rend="italic">Principles of the Civil Code</hi> (i,
					297-364) and <hi rend="italic">Principles of Penal Law</hi> (i, 365-580). The
						<hi rend="italic">Principles of the Civil Code</hi> is translated from
					Dumont's <hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s,</hi> where it follows a condensed
					statement of 'general principles' taken from the opening chapters of the <hi
						rend="italic">Introduction.</hi> An appendix 'on the levelling system' is
					added in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> from Bentham's MSS. The <hi
						rend="italic">Principles of Penal Law</hi> consists of three parts: the
					first and third (on 'political remedies for the evil of offences' and on
					'indirect means of preventing crimes') are translated from parts 2 and 4 of
					Dumont's <hi rend="italic">Principes du Code p&eacute;nal</hi> (parts 1 and
					3 of Dumont being adaptations from the <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Morals
						and Legislation</hi>). The second part of the <hi rend="italic">Penal
					Law,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Rationale of Punishment</hi> is from Dumont's
						<hi rend="italic">Th&eacute;orie des Peines et des
						R&eacute;compenses.</hi> Dumont took it from a MS. written by Bentham in
					1775. (See Bentham's <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> i, 388). An appendix on
					'Death Punishment', addressed by Bentham to the French people in 1830, is added
					to Part II in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (i. 525-532). No. 4 of Bentham's
					general scheme corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">Rationale of Reward,</hi>
					founded upon two MSS., one in French and one in English, used by Dumont in the
						<hi rend="italic">Th&eacute;orie des Peines et des
						R&eacute;compensees.</hi> The English version in the <hi rend="italic"
						>Works,</hi> chiefly translated from Dumont and compared with the original
					manuscript, was first published in 1825 (ii, 189-266). Richard Smith 'of the
					Stamps and Taxes' was the editor of this and of an edition of the <hi
						rend="italic">Rationale of Punishment</hi> in 1831, and of various minor
					treatises. (Bentham's <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> x, 548n.)</p>


				<p>The <hi rend="italic">Table of the Springs of Action</hi> (i, 195-220), written
					at an early period, was printed in 1815,and published, with modifications, in
					817. The <hi rend="italic">Vue g&eacute;n&eacute;rale</hi> included in
					the <hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s</hi> of 1802 was intended by Bentham as
					a sketch for his own guidance,and is translated as <hi rend="italic">View of a
						Complete Code of Laws</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (iii,
					154-210). The two essays in the 1802 <hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s</hi>
					on 'the promulgation of laws' and the 'influence of time and place in matters of
					legislation' are translated in Works (i. 157-194). A fragment on <hi
						rend="italic">International Law</hi> -- a phrase invented by Bentham --
					written between 1786 and 1789, first appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
					>Works</hi> (ii, 535-571), with <hi rend="italic">Junctiana proposal</hi> -- a
					plan for a canal between the Atlantic and the Pacific -- written in 1822, as an
					appendix.</p>


				<p>Besides the above, all written before 1789, in pursuance of his schem, Bentham
					had published in 1778 his <hi rend="italic">View of the Hard Labour Bill</hi>
					(iv, 1-36); and in 1787 his <hi rend="italic">Defence of Usury</hi> (iii, 1-19).
					A third edition of the last (with the 'protest against law taxes') was published
					in 1816.</p>

				<p>During the following period (1789-1802) Bentham wrote various books, more or less
					suggested by the French revolution. The <hi rend="italic">Essay on Political
						Tactics</hi> (ii, 299-373), (corresponding to No. 6 of the scheme), was sent
					to Morellet in 1789, but first published by Dumont in 1816. With it Dumont also
					published the substance of the <hi rend="italic">Anarchical Fallacies</hi> (ii,
					489-534), written about 1791. A <hi rend="italic">Draught of a Code for the
						Organization of the Judicial Establishment of France,</hi> dated March 1790,
					is reprinted in <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> iv, 285-406. <hi rend="italic"
						>Truth v. Ashhurst,</hi> written in 1792 (v, 231-237), was first published
					in 1823. A <hi rend="italic">Manual of Political Economy,</hi> written by 1793(
					see <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> iii, 73n.), corresponds to No. 9 of his
					scheme. A chapter appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Biblioth&egrave;que
						Britannique</hi> in 1798. It was partly used in Dumont's <hi rend="italic"
						>Th&eacute;orie des R&eacute;compenses,</hi> and first published in
					English in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (iii, 31-84). <hi rend="italic"
						>Emancipate your Colonies</hi> (iv, 407-481) was privately printed in 1793,
					and first published for sale in 1830. A <hi rend="italic">Protest against Law
						Taxes,</hi> printed in 1793, was published in 1795 together with <hi
						rend="italic">Supply without Burthen, or Escheat vice Taxation,</hi> written
					in 1794. To them is appended a short paper called <hi rend="italic">Tax with
						Monopoly</hi> (ii, 573-600). <hi rend="italic">A Plan for saving all Trouble
						and Expense in the Transfer of Stock,</hi> written and partly printed in
					1800, was first published in <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (iii, 105-153).</p>


				<p>During this period Bentham was also occupied with the Panopticon, and some
					writings refer to it. <hi rend="italic">The Panopticon, or the Inspection
					House</hi> (iv, 37-172), written in 1787, was published in 1791. <hi
						rend="italic">The Panopticon versus New South Wales</hi> (iv, 173-248)
					appeared in 1802; and <hi rend="italic">A Plea for the Constitution</hi> (on
					transportation to New South Wales) (iv, 249-284) in 1803. Closely connected with
					these are <hi rend="italic">Poor-Laws and Pauper Managment</hi> (viii, 358-461),
					reprinted from Arthur Young's <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of September 1797
					and following months; and <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Poor Bill</hi>
					(viii, 440-459), written in February 1797, privately printed in 1838, and first
					published in the <hi rend="italic">Works.</hi></p>

				<p>About 1802 Bentham returned to jurisprudence. James Mill prepared from the papers
					then written an <hi rend="italic">Introductory View on the Rationale of
						Evidence,</hi> finished and partly printed in 1812 (see <hi rend="italic"
						>Works,</hi> x, 468n, and Bain's <hi rend="italic">James Mill,</hi> 105,
					120). Dumont's <hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute; des Preuves judiciares</hi>
					(1823) was a redaction of the original papers, and an English translation of
					this appeared in 1825. The parts referring to English Law were omitted. <hi
						rend="italic">The Rationale of Evidence</hi> (5 vols, 8vo, 1827), edited by
					J.S. Mill, represented a different and fuller redaction of the same papers. It
					is reprinted in vols. vi, and vii, of the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> with the
						<hi rend="italic">Introductory View</hi> (now first published) prefixed. To
					the same period belongs <hi rend="italic">Scotch Reform,</hi> with a <hi
						rend="italic">Summary View of a Plan for a Judicatory,</hi> 1808 (second
					edition 1811, v, 1-60).</p>


				<p>After 1808 Bentham's attention was especially drawn to political questions. His
						<hi rend="italic">Catechism of Parliamentary Reform</hi> (iii, 433-557),
					written in 1809, was first published with a long 'introduction' in the <hi
						rend="italic">Pamphleteer</hi> for January 1817. Bentham's <hi rend="italic"
						>Radical Reform Bill, with explanations</hi> (iii, 558-597) followed in
					December 1819. <hi rend="italic">Radicalism not dangerous</hi> (iii, 598-622),
					written at the same time, first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>
					(iii, 398-622). <hi rend="italic">Elements of the Art of Packing as applied to
						Special Juries, especially in Cases of Libel Law</hi> (v, 61-186), written
					in 1809, was published in 1821. <hi rend="italic">Swear not at all</hi> (v,
					188-229) (referring chiefly to Oxford tests), written in 1813, was published in
					1817. <hi rend="italic">The King against Edmonds</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
						King against Wolsely</hi> (v, 239-261) were published in 1820. <hi
						rend="italic">Official Aptitude minimised; Official Expense limited</hi> (v,
					263-286), is a series of papers, first collected in 1831. It contains a <hi
						rend="italic">Defence of Economy against Burke,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
						>Defence of Economy against George Rose,</hi> both written in 1810, and
					published in the <hi rend="italic">Pamphleteer</hi> in 1817, with <hi
						rend="italic">Observations</hi> on a speech by Peel in 1825, and <hi
						rend="italic">Indication respecting Lord Eldon.</hi> The two last appeared
					in 1825. Connected with these political writings is the <hi rend="italic">Book
						of Fallacies</hi> (ii, 375-488), edited by Bingham in 1824, from the 'most
					unfinished of all Bentham's writings.' Allusions seem to show that the original
					MSS. were written from 1810 to 1819. It was partly published by Dumont with the
						<hi rend="italic">Tactique, etc.</hi></p>


				<p>Bentham, during this period (1808-1820), was also led into various outlying
					questions. The <hi rend="italic">Pannomial Fragments, Nomography, and Appendix
						on Logical Arrangement employed by Jeremy Bentham</hi> (iii, 211-295) were
					first published in the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> from MSS. written from 1813
					to 1831. With the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathia</hi> (viii, 1-192), first
					published in 1816, are connected fragments upon 'Ontology', 'Language', and
					'Universal Grammar' (viii, 193-358), first published in <hi rend="italic"
					>Works</hi> from fragments of MSS. of 1813 and later. George Bentham's <hi
						rend="italic">Outline of a New System of Logic</hi> was partly founded upon
					his uncle's papers. Bentham at the Ford Abbey time (1814-1818) was also writing
					his <hi rend="italic">Church of Englandism and its Catechism examined,</hi>
					1818. The <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion upon
						the Temporal Happiness of Mankind,</hi> by Philip Beauchamp, edited by
					George Grote, appeared in 1822; and <hi rend="italic">Not Paul but Jesus,</hi>
					by Gamaliel Smith in 1823. Francis Place helped in preparing this at Ford Abbey
					in 1817 (Mr Wallas' <hi rend="italic">Life of Place,</hi> p. 83). <hi
						rend="italic">Mother Church of England relieved by Bleeding</hi> (1823) and
					the <hi rend="italic">Book of Church Reform</hi> (131) are extracted from <hi
						rend="italic">Church of Englandism,</hi> Bowring did not admit these works
					to his collection.</p>


				<p>In his later years (1820-1832) Bentham began to be specially occupied wit
					codification. <hi rend="italic">Papers upon Codification and Public
					Instruction</hi> (iv, 451-534) consist chiefly of letters, written from 1811 to
					1815, offering himself for employment in codification in America and Russia, and
					first published in 1817. In 1821 appeared <hi rend="italic">Three Tracts
						relating to Spanish and Portuguese Affairs, with a Continual Eye to English
						ones;</hi> and in 1822 <hi rend="italic">Three Letters to Count Toreno on
						the proposed Penal Code</hi> (in Spain) (viii, 460-554). A short tract on
						<hi rend="italic">Liberty of the Press</hi> was addressed to the Spanish
					people in 1821 (ii, 275-299). <hi rend="italic">Codification Proposals</hi> (iv,
					535-594) appeared in 1823, offering to prepare an 'all-comprehensive code of
					law' for 'any nation professing liberal opinions.' <hi rend="italic">Securities
						against Misrule addressed to a Mahommedan State, and prepared with a special
						Reference to Tripoli,</hi> written in 1822-23, was first published in the
						<hi rend="italic">Works</hi> (viii, 551-600). A tract on the <hi
						rend="italic">Leading Principles of a Constitutional Code</hi> (ii, 267-274)
					appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Pamphleteer</hi> in 1823. The first volume of
					the <hi rend="italic">Constitutional Code,</hi> printed in 1827, was published
					with the first chapter of the second volume in 1830. The whole book, edited by
					R. Doane from papers written between 1818 and 1832, was published in 1841, and
					forms volume ix of the <hi rend="italic">Works.</hi> Doane also edited <hi
						rend="italic">Principles of Judicial Procedure</hi> (ii, 1-188) from papers
					written chiefly from 1820 to 1827, though part had been written in 1802. Several
					thousand pages upon the subject -- the third part of the original scheme -- were
					left by Bentham at his death.</p>


				<p>During his last years Bentham also wrote a <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Mr
						Humphrey's Real Property Code</hi>, published in the Westminster Review for
					October 1826 (v, 387-416); <hi rend="italic">Justice and Codification
					Petitions</hi> (v, 437-548), printed in 1829; <hi rend="italic">Jeremy Bentham
						to his Fellow-Citizens in France on Houses of Peers and Senates</hi> (iv,
					419-450), dated 15th October 1820; <hi rend="italic">Equity Dispatch Court
						Proposals</hi> (iii, 297-432), first published in <hi rend="italic"
					>Works</hi> and written from 1829 to 1821; <hi rend="italic">Outline of a Plan
						of a General Register of Real Property</hi> (v, 417-435), published in the
					Report of the Real Property Commission in 1832; and <hi rend="italic">Lord
						Brougham Displayed</hi> (v, 549-612), 1832.</p>


				<p><hi rend="italic">The Deontology or Science of Morality</hi> was published by
					Bowring in two vols, 8vo in 1834, but omitted from the <hi rend="italic"
					>Works,</hi> as the original edition was not exhausted. The MS. preserved at
					University College, London, shows that a substantial beginning had been made in
					1814; most of the remainder about 1820. The second volume, made, as Bowring
					says, from a nubmer of scraps, is probably more 'Bowringised' than the first.</p>


				<p>Dumont's <hi rend="italic">Trait&eacute;s</hi> were translated into Spanish
					in 1821, and the <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in 1841-43. There are also Russian
					and Italian translations. In 1830 a translation from Dumont, edited by F.E.
					Beneke, as <hi rend="italic">Grunds&auml;tze der Civil- und
						Criminal-Gesetzgebung</hi>, etc., was published at Berlin. Beneke observes
					that Bentham had hitherto received little attention in Germany, though well
					known in other countries. He reports a saying attributed to Mme de
					Sta&euml;l that the age was that of Bentham, not of Byron or Buonaparte. The
					neglect of Bentham in Germany was due, as Beneke says, to the prevalence of the
					Kantian philosophy. Bentham, however, had been favourable noticed in the <hi
						rend="italic">Hermes</hi> for 1822, and his merits since acknowledged by
					Mittermaier and Warnk&ouml;nig in the <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift
						f&uuml;r Rechtwissenschaft</hi>. Beneke (1898-1854) was opposed to the
					Hegelian tendencies of his time, and much influence by Herbart. See Ueberweg's
						<hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy</hi> (English translation, 1874, ii,
					281, etc.) and the account of Bentham in Robert von Mohl's <hi rend="italic"
						>Staatswissenshcaften</hi>, etc. (1833), iii, 595-635.</p>


				<p>A great mass of Bentham MSS. belongs to University College, London. They are
					contained in 148 boxes, which were examined and catalogued by Mr T. Whittaker in
					1892. A few of these contain correspondence, part of which was printed by
					Bowring. Others are the manuscripts of published works. Some are upon the same
					subjects as the published works, and other refer to topics not included in his
					publications. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Deontology</hi> manuscripts and a
					fragment upon 'Political Deontology', there is a discussion of the means of
					suppressing duels, an argument against the legal punishment of certain offences
					against decency, and a criticism of the gospel narrative similar to <hi
						rend="italic">Not Paul,</hi> etc. I have not thought it necessary to examine
					these fragments after reading Mr Whittaker's report. Bentham's principles are
					sufficiently stated in his published works; and the papers which have been
					reposing in the cellars of University College can have had no influence upon the
					world. There is another large collection of MSS. in the British Museum from the
					papers of Bentham and his brother, Sir Samuel. Ten folio volumes contain
					correspondence, much of it referring only to Sir Samuel. A long correspondence
					upon the acquisition of the 'Panopticon' land is included. Another volume
					contains many of Bentham's school and college exercises. There are also the
					manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Nomography, Logical Arrangements,</hi> etc.
					This collection was used by Bowring and by Lady Bentham in the life of her
					husband.</p>
