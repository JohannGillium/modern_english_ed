<p>There are a hundred faults in this Thing, and a hundred things
might be said to prove them beauties.  But it is needless.  A book may
be amusing with numerous errors, or it may be very dull without a
single absurdity.  The hero of this piece unites in himself the three
greatest characters upon earth; he is a priest, a husbandman, and the
father of a family.  He is drawn as ready to teach and ready to obey; as
simple in affluence, and majestic in adversity.  In this age of opulence
and refinement, whom can such a character please? Such as are fond of
high life will turn with disdain from the simplicity of his country
fireside.  Such as mistake ribaldry for humor will find no wit in his
harmless conversation; and such as have been taught to deride religion
will laugh at one whose chief stores of comfort are drawn from
futurity.</p>

<head>The Description of the Family of Wakefield, in Which a
Kindred Likeness Prevails, as Well of Minds as of Persons.</head>

<p>I WAS ever of opinion, that the honest man who married and
brought up a large family, did more service than he who continued single
and only talked of population.  From this motive I had scarcely taken
orders a year, before I began to think seriously of matrimony, and
choose my wife, as she did her wedding gown, not for a fine glossy surf
ace, but such qualities as would wear well, To do her justice, she was a
good-natured, notable woman; and as for breeding, there were few
country ladies who could show more.  She could read any English book
without much spelling; but for pickling, preserving, and cookery none
could excel her.  She prided herself also upon being an excellent
contriver in housekeeping, though I never could find that we grew richer
with all her contrivances.</p>
<p>However, we loved each other tenderly, and our fondness
increased as we grew old.  There was, in fact, nothing that could make
us angry with the world

<pb n="4"/> or each other.  We had an elegant house, situated in a fine
country, and a good neighborhood.  The year was spent in moral or rural
amusements, in visiting our rich neighbors, and relieving such as were
poor.  We had no revolutions to fear, nor fatigues to undergo; all our
adventures were by the fireside, and all our migrations from the blue bed
to the brown.</p>
<p>As we lived near the road, we often had the traveller or stranger
visit us to taste our gooseberry wine, for which we had great reputation;
and I profess, with the veracity of an historian, that I never knew one of
them to find fault with it.  Our cousins, too, even to the fortieth remove,
all remembered their affinity, without any help from the Herald's Office,
and came very frequently to see us.  Some of them did us no great honor
by these claims of kindred; as we had the blind, the maimed, and the
halt amongst the number.  However, my wife always insisted that as they
were the same flesh and blood, they should sit with us at the same table.
So that if we had not very rich, we generally had very happy friends
about us; for this remark will hold good through life, that the poorer the
guest, the better pleased be ever is with being treated; and as some men
gaze with admiration at the colors of a tulip, or the wing of a butterfly,
so I was by nature an admirer of happy human faces.  However, when
any one of our relations was found to be a person of very bad character,
a troublesome guest, or

<pb n="5"/>


<pb n="6"/>  one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house I
ever took care to lend him a riding-coat or a pair of -boots, or
sometimes a horse of small value, and I always had the satisfaction of
finding he never came back to return them.  By this the house was
cleared of such as we did not like; but never was the family of
Wakefield known to turn the traveller or the poor dependent out of
doors.</p>
<p>Thus we lived several years in a state of much happiness, not but
that we sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends to
enhance the value of its favors.  My orchard was often robbed by
schoolboys, and my wife's custards plundered by the cats or the
children.  The 'Squire would sometimes fall asleep in the most pathetic
parts of my sermon, or his lady return my wife's civilities at church with
a mutilated courtesy.  But we soon got over the uneasiness caused by
such accidents, and usually in three or four days began to wonder how
they vexed us.</p>
<p>My children, the offspring of temperance, as they were educated
without softness, so they were at once well formed and healthy; my sons
hardy and active, my daughters beautiful and blooming.  When I stood in
the midst of the little circle, which promised to be the support of my
declining age, I could not avoid repeating the famous story of Count
Abensberg, who, in Henry the Second's progress through Germany,
while other courtiers came with their treasures,

<pb n="7"/>   brought his thirty-two children, and presented them to
his sovereign as the most valuable offering he had to bestow.  In this
manner, though I had but six, I considered them as a very valuable
present made to my country, and consequently looked upon it as my
debtor.  Our oldest son was named George, after his uncle, who left us
ten thousand pounds.  Our second child, a girl, I intended to call after
her aunt Grissel; but my wife, who during her pregnancy had been
reading romances, insisted upon her being called Olivia.  In less than
another year we had another daughter, and now I was determined that
Grissel should be her name; but a rich relation taking a fancy to stand
god-mother, the girl was, by her directions, called Sophia, so that we
had two romantic names in the family; but I solemnly protest I had no
hand in it.  Moses was our next, and after an interval of twelve years we
had two sons more.</p>
<p>It would be fruitless to deny my exultation when I saw my little
ones about me; but the vanity and the satisfaction of my wife were even
greater than mine.  When our visitors would say: "Well, upon my word,
Mrs. Primrose, you have the finest children in the whole country," "Ay,
neighbor," she would answer, "they are as Heaven made them,
handsome enough, if they be good enough; for handsome is that
handsome does." And then she would bid the girls hold up their heads,
who, to conceal nothing, were certainly

<pb n="8"/>   very handsome.  Mere outside is so very trifling a
circumstance with me, that I should scarcely have remembered to
mention it had it not been a general topic of conversation in the country.
Olivia, now about eighteen, had that luxuriance of beauty with which
painters generally draw Hebe-open, sprightly, and commanding.
Sophia's features were not so striking at first, but often did more certain
execution; for they were soft, modest and alluring.  The one vanquished
by a single blow, the other by efforts successfully repeated.</p>
<p>The temper of a woman is generally formed from the turn of her
features; at least it was so with my daughters.  Olivia wished for many
lovers, Sophia to secure one.  Olivia was often affected with too great a
desire to please.  Sophia even repressed excellence from her fears to
offend.  The one entertained me with her vivacity when I was gay, the
other with her sense when I was serious.  But these qualities were never
carried to excess in either, and I have often seen them exchange
characters for a whole day together.  A suit of mourning has transformed
my coquette into a prude, and a new set of ribands has given her
younger sister more than natural vivacity.  My eldest son George was
bred at Oxford, as I intended him for one of the learned professions.
My second boy Moses, whom I designed for business, received a sort of
miscellaneous education at home.  But it is needless to attempt

<pb n="9"/>   describing the particular characters of  young people that
had seen but very little of the world.  In short, a family likeness
prevailed through all; and, properly speaking, they had but one
character, that of being all equally generous, credulous, simple, and
inoffensive.</p>

<head>Family Misfortunes-The Loss of Fortune Only Serves to
Increase  the Pride of the Worthy. </head>
<p>THE temporal concerns of our family were chiefly committed to
my wife's management; as to the spiritual, I took them entirely under my
own direction.  The profits of my living, which amounted to but thirty
five pounds a year, I made over to the orphans and widows of the clergy
of our diocese; for having a fortune of my own, I was careless of
temporalities, and felt a secret pleasure in doing my duty without
reward.  I also set a resolution of keeping no curate, and of being
acquainted with every man in the parish, exhorting the married men to
temperance, and the bachelors to matrimony; so that in a few years it
was a common saying, that there were three strange wants at Wakefield
a parson wanting pride, young men wanting wives and ale-houses
wanting customers.  Matrimony was always one of my favorite topics,
and I wrote several sermons to prove its happiness; but there was a
peculiar tenet which I made a point of supporting: for I maintained with
Whiston, that it was unlawful

<pb n="11"/> for a priest of the Church of England, after the death of
his first wife, to take a second, or to express it in one word, I valued
myself upon being a strict monogamist.</p>
<p>I was early initiated into this important dispute, on which so many
laborious volumes have been written.  I published some tracts upon the
subject myself, which, as they never sold, I have the consolation of
thinking were read only by the happy few.  Some of my friends called
this my weak side; but alas! they had not, like me, made it the subject of
long contemplation.  The more I reflected upon it, the more important it
appeared.  I even went a step beyond Whiston in displaying my
principles; as he had engraven upon his wife's tomb that she was the
only wife of William Whiston, so I wrote a similar epitaph for my wife
though still living, in which I extolled her prudence, economy, and
obedience, till death; and having got it copied f air, with an elegant
frame, it was placed over the chimney-piece, where it answered several
very useful purposes.  It admonished my wife of her duty to me, and my
fidelity to her; it inspired her with a passion for fame, and constantly put
her in mind of her end.</p>
<p>It was thus, perhaps, f rom hearing marriage so of ten
recommended, that my eldest son, just upon leaving college, fixed his
affections upon the daughter of a neighboring clergyman, who was a
dignitary in the

<pb n="12"/>   Church, and in circumstances to give her a large
fortune: but fortune was her smallest accomplishment.  Miss Arabella
Wilmot was allowed by all except my two daughters, to be completely
pretty.  Her youth, health, and innocence, were still heightened by a
complexion so transparent, and such a happy sensibility of look, as even
age could not gaze on with indifference.  As Mr. Wilmot knew that I
could make a very handsome settlement on my son, he was not averse to
the match; so both families lived together in all that harmony which
generally precedes an expected alliance.  Being convinced by experience
that the days of courtship are the most happy of our lives, I was willing
enough to lengthen the period; and the various amusements which the
young couple every day shared in each other's company seemed to
increase their passion.  We were generally awakened in the morning by
music, and on fine days rode a-hunting.  The hours between breakfast
and dinner the ladies devoted to dress and study: they usually read a
page, and then gazed at themselves in the glass, which even philosophers
might own of ten presented the page of greatest beauty.  At dinner my
wife took the lead; for as she always insisted upon carving every thing
herself, it being her mother's way, she gave us upon these occasions the
history of every dish.  When we had dined, to prevent the ladies leaving
us, I generally ordered the table to be removed; and sometimes, with the
music-master's assistance, the

<pb n="13"/>   girls would give us a very agreeable concert.  Walking
out, drinking tea, country dances and forfeits, shortened the rest of the
day, without the assistance of cards, as I hated all manner of gaming,
except back-gammon, at which my old friend and I sometimes took a
two-penny hit.  Nor can I here pass over an ominous circumstance that
happened the last time we played together: I only wanted to fling a
quatre, and yet I threw deuce-ace five times running.</p>
<p>Some months were elapsed in this manner, till at last it was
thought convenient to fix a day for the nuptials of the young couple, who
seemed earnestly to desire it. During the preparations for the wedding, I
need not describe the busy importance of my wife, nor the sly looks of
my daughters; in fact, my attention was fixed on another object, the
completing a tract which I intended shortly to publish in defence of my
favorite principle.  As I looked upon this as a master-piece, both for
argument and style, I could not in the pride of my heart avoid showing it
to my old friend Mr. Wilmot, as I made no doubt of receiving his
approbation, but not till too late I discovered that he was most violently
attached to the contrary opinion, and with good reason, for he was at
that time actually courting a fourth wife.  This, as may be expected,
produced a dispute attended with some acrimony, which threatened to
interrupt our intended alliance; but on the day

<pb n="14"/>   before that appointed for the ceremony, we agreed to
discuss the subject at large.</p>
<p>It was managed with proper spirit on both sides; he asserted that I
was heterodox, I retorted the charge; he replied, and I rejoined.  In the
meantime, while the controversy was hottest, I was called out by one of
my relations, who, with a face of concern, advised me to give up the
dispute, at least till my son's wedding was over.  "How!" cried I,
"relinquish the cause of truth, and let him be a husband, already driven
to the very verge of absurdity! You might as well advise me to give up
my fortune, as my argument." "Your fortune," returned my friend, "I
am now sorry to inform you, is almost nothing.  The merchant in town,
in whose hands your money was lodged, has gone off, to avoid a statute
of bankruptcy, and is thought not to have left a shilling in the pound.  I
was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the
wedding; but now it may serve to moderate your warmth in the
argument, for I suppose your own prudence will enforce the necessity of
dissembling, at least till your son has the young lady's fortune secure."
"Well," returned I, "if what you tell me be true and if I am to be a
beggar, it shall never make me a rascal, or induce me to disavow my
principles.  I'll go this moment and inform the company of my
circumstances: and as for the argument, I even here retract my former
concessions in the old gentleman's favor, nor will

<pb n="15"/>   I allow him now to be a husband in any sense of the
expression."</p>
<p>It would be endless to describe the different sensations of both
families when I divulged the news of our misfortune, but what others felt
was slight to what the lovers appeared to endure.  Mr. Wilmot, who
seemed before sufficiently inclined to break off the match, was by this
blow soon determined: one virtue he had in perfection, which was
prudence, too often the only one that is left us at seventy-two.</p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d8"><pb n="16"/>
<head>A Migration-The Fortunate Circumstances of our Lives are
Generally Found at Last to Be of our Own Procuring. </head>
<p>THE only hope of our family now was that the report of our
misfortunes might be malicious or premature, but a letter from my agent
in town soon came with a confirmation of every particular.  The loss of
fortune to myself alone would have been trifling; the only uneasiness I
felt was for my family, who were to be humble without an education to
render them callous to contempt.</p>
<p>Near a fortnight had passed before I attempted to restrain their
affliction, for premature consolation is but the remembrancer of sorrow.
During this interval my thoughts were employed on some future means
of supporting them, and at last  a small cure of fifteen pounds a year was
offered me in a distant neighborhood, where I could still enjoymy
principles without molestation.  With this proposal I joyfully closed,
having determined to increase my salary by managing a little
farm.</p>
<p>Having taken this resolution, my next care was to

<pb n="17"/>   get together the wrecks of my fortune; and, all debts
collected and paid, out of fourteen thousand pounds we had but four
hundred remaining.  My chief attention, therefore, was now to bring
down the pride of my family to their circumstances, for I well knew that
aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself.  "You cannot be ignorant, my
children," cried I, "that no prudence of ours could have prevented our
late misfortune, but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects.
We are now poor, my fondlings, and wisdom bids us conform to our
humble situation.  Let us, then, without repining, give up those
splendors with which numbers are wretched, and seek in humbler
circumstances that peace with which all may be happy.  The poor live
pleasantly without our help; why, then, should we not learn to live
without theirs? No, my children, let us from this moment give up all
pretensions to gentility; we have still enough left for happiness if we are
wise, and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of
fortune."</p>
<p>As my eldest son was bred a scholar, I determined to send him to
town, where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own.
The separation of friends and families is, perhaps, one of the most
distressful circumstances attendant on penury.  The day soon arrived on
which we were to disperse for the first time.  My son, after taking leave
of his mother and the rest, who mingled their tears with their kisses,

<pb n="18"/>   came to ask a blessing from me.  This I gave him from
my heart, and which, added to five guineas, was all the patrimony I had
now to bestow.  "You are going, my boy," cried I, "to London on foot,
in the manner Hooker, your great ancestor, travelled there before you.
Take f rom me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop
jewel, this staff ; and take this book too, it will be your comfort on the
way: these two lines in it are worth a million: 'I have been young, and
now am old; yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken, or his seed
begging their bread.' Let this be your consolation as you travel on.  Go,
my boy; whatever be thy fortune, let me see thee once a year; still keep
a good heart, and farewell." As he was possessed of integrity and honor,
I was under no apprehensions f rom throwing him naked into the
amphitheatre of life; f or I knew he would act a good part, whether van
quished or victorious.</p>
<p>His departure only prepared the way for our own, which arrived a
few days afterwards.  The leaving a neighborhood in which we had
enjoyed so many hours of tranquillity was not without a tear, which
scarcely fortitude itself could suppress.  Besides, a journey of seventy
miles, to a family that had hitherto never been above ten miles from
home, filled us with apprehension; and the cries of the poor, who
followed us for some miles, contributed to increase it.  The first day's
journey brought us in safety within thirty miles

<pb n="19"/>

of our future retreat, and we put up for the night at an
obscure inn in a village by the way.  When we were
shown a room, I desired the landlord, in my usual way, to let us have
his company, with which he complied, as what he drank would increase
the bill the next morning.  He knew, however, the whole neighborhood

<pb n="20"/> to which I was removing, particularly 'Squire Thorn
hill, who was to be my landlord, and who lived within a few miles of the
place.  This gentleman he described as one who desired to know little
more of the world than its pleasures, being particularly remarkable for
his attachment to the fair sex.  He observed that no virtue was able to
resist his arts and assiduity, and that scarcely a farmer's daughters within
ten miles round, but what had found him successful and faithless.
Though this account gave me some pain, it had a very different effect
upon my daughters, whose features seemed to brighten with the
expectation of an approaching triumph; nor was my wife less pleased and
confident of their allurements and virtue.  While our thoughts were thus
employed, the hostess entered the room to inform her husband that the
strange gentleman, who had been two days in the house, wanted
money, and could not satisfy them for his reckoning.  "Want money!"
replied the host, "that must be impossible; for it was no later than
yesterday he paid three guineas to our beadle to  spare an old broken
soldier that was to be whippedthrough the town for dogstealing." The
hostess, however, still persisting in her first assertion, he was preparing
to leave the room, swearing that he would be satisfied one way or an
other, when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so
much charity as he described.  With this he complied, showing in a
gentleman who

<pb n="21"/> seemed to be about thirty, dressed in clothes that once
were laced.  His person was well formed, and his face marked with the
lines of thinking.  He had something short and dry in his address, and
seemed not to understand ceremony, or to despise it.  Upon the
landlord's leaving the room, I could not avoid expressing my concern
to the stranger at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances, and offered
him my purse to satisfy the present demand.  "I take it with all my heart,
sir," replied he, "and am glad that a late oversight in giving what
money I had about me, has shown me that there are still some men like
you.  I must, however, previously entreat being informed of the name
and residence of my benefactor, in order to repay him as soon as possi
ble." In this I satisfied him fully, not only mentioning my name and late
misfortunes, but the place to which I was going to remove.  "This,"
cried he, "happens still more luckily than I hoped for, as I am going the
same way myself, having been detained here two days by the floods,
which I hope by tomorrow will be found passable."' I testified the
pleasure I should have in his company, and my wife and daughters
joining in entreaty, he was prevailed upon to stay to supper.  The
stranger's conversation, which was at once pleasing and instructive,
induced me to wish for a continuance of it; but it was now high time to
retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of the following
day.</p>
<p>The next morning we all set forward together; my

<pb n="22"/> family on horseback, while Mr. Burchell, our new
companion, walked along the footpath by the roadside, observing with
a smile, that as we were illmounted, he would be too generous to
attempt to leave us behind.  As the floods were not yet subsided, we
were obliged to hire a guide, who trotted on before, Mr. Burchell and I
bringing up the rear.  We lightened the fatigues of the road with
philosophical disputes, which he seemed to understand perfectly.  But
what surprised me most was, that though he was a moneyborrower, he
defended his opinions with as much obstinacy as if he had been my
patron.  He now and then also informed me to whom the different seats
belonged that lay in our view as we travelled the road.  "That," cried he,
pointing to a very magnificent house which stood at some distance,
"belongs to Mr. Thornhill, a young gentleman who enjoys a large
fortune, though entirely dependent on the will of his uncle, Sir William
Thornhill, a gentleman who, content with a little himself, permits his
nephew to enjoy the rest, and chiefly resides in town." "What!" cried I,
"is my young landlord, then, the nephew of a man whose virtues,
generosity, and singularities are so universally known? I have heard Sir
William Thornhill represented as one of the most generous, yet
whimsical men in the kingdom; a man of consummate benevolence."
"Something, perhaps, too much so," replied Mr. Burchell, "at least he
carried benevolence to an excess

<pb n="23"/> when young; for his passions were then  strong, and as
they were all upon the side of virtue, they led it up to a romantic
extreme.  He early began to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and
scholar; was soon distinguished in the army, and had some reputation
among men of learning.  Adulation ever follows the ambitious; for such
alone receive most pleasure from flattery.  He was surrounded with
crowds, who showed him only one side of their character; so that he
began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy.  He
loved all mankind; for fortune prevented him from knowing that there
were rascals.  Physicians tell us of a disorder, in which the whole body
is so exquisitely sensible, that the slightest touch gives pain: what some
have thus suffered in their persons, this gentleman felt in his mind.
The slightest distress, whether real or fictitious, touched him to the
quick, and his soul labored under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of
others.  Thus disposed to relieve, it will be easily conjectured,  he
found numbers disposed to solicit; his profusions began to impair his
fortune, but not his good-nature, that indeed, was seen to increase as the
other seemed to decay; he grew improvident as he grew poor; and
though he talked like a man of sense his actions were those of a fool.
Still, however, being surrounded with importunity, and no longer able
to satisfy every request that was made him, instead of money he gave
promises.  They were all he had to bestow, and

<pb n="24"/> he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a
denial.  By this he drew round him crowds of dependents whom he was
sure to disappoint, yet wished to relieve.  These hung upon him for a
time, and left him with merited reproaches and contempt.  But in
proportion as he became contemptible to others, he became despicable to
himself.His mind had leaned upon their adulation, and that  support
taken away, he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart, which
he had never learnt to reverence.  The world now began to wear a
different aspect; the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple
approbation.  Approbation soon took the more friendly form of advice,
and advice when rejected produced their reproaches.  He now therefore
found that such friends as benefits had gathered round him, were little
estimable; he now found that a man's own heart must be ever given to
gain that of another.  I now found, thatthat-I forget what I was going to
observe; in short, sir, he resolved to respect himself, and laid down a
plan of restoring his fallen fortune.  For this purpose, in his own
whimsical manner, he travelled through Europe on foot, and now,
though he has scarcely attained the age of thirty, his circumstances are
more affluent than ever.  At present his bounties are more rational and
moderate than before; but still he preserves the character of a humorist,
and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues." </p>

<pb n="25"/>
<p>My attention was so taken up by Mr.  Burchell's account, that I
scarcely looked forward as we went along, till we were alarmed by the
cries of my family; when turning, I perceived my youngest daughter in
the midst of a rapid stream, thrown from her horse, and struggling with
the torrent.  She had sunk twice, nor was it in my power to disengage
myself in time to bring her relief.  My sensations were even too violent
to permit my attempting her rescue; she must have certainly perished had
not my companion, perceiving her danger, instantly plunged in to her
relief, and, with some difficulty, brought her in safety to the opposite
shore.  By taking the current a little farther up, the rest of the family got
safely over, where we had an opportunity of joining our
acknowledgments to hers.  Her gratitude may be more readily imagined
than described; she thanked her deliverer more with looks than words,
and continued to lean upon his arm, as if still willing to receive
assistance.  My wife also hoped one day to have the pleasure of
returning his kindness at her own house.  Thus, after we were refreshed
at the next inn, and had dined together, as Mr. Burchell was going to a
different part of the country, he took leave; and we pursued our
journey, my wife observing, as we went, that she liked him extremely,
and protesting, that if he had birth and fortune to entitle him to match
in such a family as ours, she knew no man she would sooner fix upon.  I
could

<pb n="26"/>   not but smile to hear her talk in this lofty strain; but I
was never much displeased with those harmless delusions that tend to
make us more happy.</p>

<head>A Proof That Even the Humblest Fortune May Grant
Happiness,  Which Depends not on Circumstances but
Constitution.</head>
<p>THE place of our retreat was in a little neighborhood, consisting
of farmers, who tilled their own grounds, and were equal strangers to
opulence and poverty.  As they had almost all the conveniences of life
within themselves, they seldom visited towns or cities in search of
superfluities.  Remote from the polite, they still retained the primeval
simplicity of manners; and frugal by habit, they scarcely knew that
temperance was a virtue.  They wrought with cheerfulness on days of
labor; but observed festivals as intervals of idleness and pleasure.  They
kept up the Christmas carol, sent true-love knots on Valentine morning,
ate pancakes on Shrove-tide, showed their wit on the first of April, and
religiously cracked nuts on Michaelmas-eve.  Being apprized of our
approach, the whole neighborhood came out to meet their minister,
dressed in their finest clothes, and preceded by a pipe and tabor; a feast
was also provided for our reception, at which we sat cheerfully down;
and what the conversation wanted in wit was made up in laughter.
</p>

<pb n="27"/>
<p>Our little habitation was situated at the foot of a sloping hill,
sheltered with a beautiful underwood behind, and a prattling river
before; on one side a meadow, on the other a green.  My farm consisted
of about twenty acres of excellent land, I having given a hundred pounds
for my predecessor's good-will.  Nothing could exceed the neatness of
my little enclosures; the elms and hedge-rows appearing with inex
pressible beauty.  My house consisted of but one  story, and was covered
with thatch, which gave it an  air of great snugness; the walls on the
inside were  nicely whitewashed, and my daughters undertook to  adorn
them with pictures of their own designing.  Though the same room
served us for parlor and kitchen, that only made it the warmer.  Besides,
as it was kept with the utmost neatness, the dishes, plates, and coppers,
being well scoured, and all disposed in bright rows on the shelves, the
eve was agreeably relieved, and did not want richer furniture.  There
were three other apartments, one for my wife and me, another for our
two daughters within our own, and the third, with two beds, for the rest
of the children.</p>
<p>The little republic to which I gave laws, was regulated in the
following manner: by sunrise we all assembled in our own common
apartment; the fire being previously kindled by the servant.  After we
had saluted each other with proper ceremony, for I always thought fit to
keep up some mechanical forms of good-breeding,

<pb n="29"/>


<pb n="30"/> without which freedom ever destroys friendship, we all
bent in gratitude to that Being who gave us another day.  This duty being
performed, my son and I went to pursue our usual industry abroad,
while my wife and daughters employed themselves in providing
breakfast, which was always ready at a certain time.  I allowed half an
hour for this meal, and an hour for dinner; which time was taken up in
innocent mirth between my wife and daughters, and in philosophical
arguments between my son and me.</p>
<p>As we rose with the sun, so we never pursued our labors after it
was gone down, but returned home to the expecting family; where
smiling looks, a neat hearth, and pleasant fire were prepared for our
reception.  Nor were we without guests; sometimes farmer
Flamborough, our talkative neighbor, and often the blind piper, would
pay us a visit, and taste our gooseberry wine; for the making of which
we had lost neither the receipt nor the reputation.  These harmless people
had several ways of being good company; while one played, the other
would sing some soothing ballad, -Johnny Armstrong's Last Good-night,
or The Cruelty of Barbara Allen.  The night was concluded in the
manner we began the morning, my youngest boys being appointed to
read the lessons of the day, and he that read loudest, distinctest, and
best, was to have a halfpenny on Sunday to put into the poor's
box.</p>
<p>When Sunday came, it was indeed a day of finery,

<pb n="31"/> which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain.  How
well soever I fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity
of my daughters, yet I found them still secretly attached to all their
former finery; they still loved laces, ribands, bugles, and catgut; my
wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy, because I
formerly happened to say it became her.</p>
<p>The first Sunday, in particular, their behavior served to mortify
me: I had desired my girls the preceding night to be dressed early the
next day; for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest
of the congregation.  They punctually obeyed my directions; but when
we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast, down came my wife
and daughters dressed out in all their former splendor: their hair
plastered up with pomatum, their faces patched to taste, their trains
bundled up in a heap behind, and rustling at every motion.  I could not
help smiling at their vanity, particularly that of my wife, from whom I
expected more discretion.  In this exigence, therefore, my only resource
was to order our son, with an important air, to call our coach.  The
girls were amazed at the command; but I repeated it with more solemnity
than before.-"Surely, my dear, you jest," cried my wife; "we can walk it
perfectly well: we want no coach to carry us now."-"You mistake,
child," returned I, "we do want a coach; for if we walk to church in this
trim, the very children in the parish will hoot

<pb n="32"/>   after us.-"Indeed," replied my wife, "I always imag
ined that my Charles was fond of seeing his children neat and handsome
about him."-" You may be as neat as you please," interrupted I, "and I
shall love you the better for it; but all this is not neatness, but frippery.
These rufflings, and pinkings, and patchings will only make us hated by
the wives of all our neighbors.  No, my children," continued I, more
gravely, "those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut;
for finery is very unbecoming in us who want the means of decency.  I
do not know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in
the rich, if we consider, upon a moderate calculation, that the naked
ness of the indigent world may be clothed from the trimmings of the
vain."</p>
<p>This remonstrance had the proper effect; they went with great
composure that very instant to change their dress, and the next day I had
the satisfaction of finding my daughters, at their own request, employed
in cutting up their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill, the
two little ones, and, what was still more satisfactory, the gowns seemed
improved by this curtailing.</p>

<head>A New and Great Acquaintance Introduced-What we Place
Most  Hopes upon Generally Proves Most Fatal. </head>
<p>AT a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a
seat overshaded by a hedge of hawthorn and honeysuckle.  Here, when
the weather was fine and our labor soon finished, we usually sat
together, to enjoy an extensive landscape in the calm of the evening.
Here, too, we drank tea, which now was become an occasional banquet,
and as we had it but seldom, it diffused a new joy, the preparations for it
being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony.  On these
occasions our two little ones always read to us, and they were regularly
served after we had done.  Sometimes, to give a variety to our
amusements, the girls sang to the guitar, and while they thus formed a
little concert, my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field, that was
embellished with bluebells and centaury, talk of our children with
rapture, and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and
harmony.</p>
<p>In this manner we began to find that every situation in life might
bring its own peculiar pleasures: every

<pb n="34"/> morning waked us to a repetition of toil; but the eve
ning repaid it with vacant hilarity.</p>
<p>It was about the beginning of autumn, on a holiday, for I kept such
as intervals of relaxation from labor, that I had drawn out my family to
our usual place of amusement, and our young musicians began their
usual concert.  As we were thus engaged we saw a stag bound nimbly
by, within about twenty paces of where we were sitting, and by its
panting it seemed pressed by the hunters.  We had not much time to
reflect upon the poor animal's distress, when we perceived the dogs
and horsemen come sweeping along at some distance behind, and making
the very path it had taken.  I was instantly for returning in with my
family; but either curiosity or surprise, or some more hidden motive,
held my wife and daughters to their seats.  The huntsman who rode
foremost passed us with great swiftness, followed by four or five persons
more, who seemed in great haste.  At last a young gentleman of a
more genteel appearance than the rest came forward, and for a while
regarding us, instead of pursuing the chase, stopped short, and giving
his horse to a servant who attended, approached us with a careless,
superior air.  He seemed to want no introduction, but was going to salute
my daughters as one certain of a kind reception; but they had early
learned the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance.  Upon
which he let us know his name was Thornhill, and that

<pb n="35"/>   he was owner of the estate that lay f or some extent
around us.  He again, therefore, offered to salute the female part of the
family; and such was the power of fortune and fine clothes that he found
no second repulse.  As his address, though confident, was easy,
we  soon became more familiar, and perceiving musical
instruments lying near, he begged to be favored with a song.  As I did
not approve of such disproportioned acquaintances, I winked upon my
daughters, in order to prevent their compliance; but my hint was
counteracted by one from their mother, so that with a cheerful

<pb n="36"/>   air they gave us a favorite song of Dryden's.  Mr.
Thornhill seemed highly delighted with their performance and choice,
and then took up the guitar himself.  He played but very indifferently;
however, my eldest daughter repaid his former applause with interest and
assured him that those tones were louder than even those of her master.
At this compliment he bowed, which she returned with a courtesy.  He
praised her taste, and she commended his understanding: an age could
not have made them better acquainted; while the fond mother, too,
equally happy, insisted upon her landlord's stepping in and tasting a
glass of her gooseberry.  The whole family seemed earnest to please
him; my girls attempted to entertain him with topics they thought most
modern, while Moses, on the contrary, gave him a question or two from
the ancients, for which he had the satisfaction of being laughed at.  My
little ones were no less busy, and fondly stuck close to the stranger.  All
my endeavors could scarcely keep their dirty fingers from handling and
tarnishing the lace on his clothes, and lifting up the flaps of his pocket
holes to see what was there.  At the approach of evening he took leave;
but not until he had requested permission to renew his visit, which, as he
was our landlord, we most readily agreed to.</p>
<p>As soon as he was gone, my wife called a council on the conduct
of the day.  She was of opinion, that it was a most fortunate hit; for she
had known even

<pb n="37"/>   stranger things at last brought to bear.  She hoped
again to see the day in which we might hold up our heads with the best
of them; and concluded, she protested she could see no reason why the
two Miss Wrinkles should marry great fortunes and her children get
none.  As this last argument was directed to me, I protested I could see
no reason for it either, nor why Mr. Simkins got the ten thousand pound
prize in the lottery, and we sat down with a blank.  "I protest Charles,"
cried my wife, "this is the way you always damp my girls and me when
we are in spirits.  Tell me, Sophy, my dear, what do you think of our
new visitor? Don't you think he seemed to be good-natured?"
"Immensely so, indeed, mamma," replied she.  "I think he has a great
deal to say upon every thing, and is never at a loss; and the more trifling
the subject, the more he has to say,"-"Yes," cried Olivia, "he is well
enough for a man; but for my part, I don't much like him, he is so
extremely impudent and familiar; but on the guitar he is shocking."
These two last speeches I interpreted by contraries.  I found by this that
Sophia internally despised as much as Olivia secretly admired him.
"Whatever may be your opinion of him, my children," cried I, "to
confess the truth, he has not prepossessed me in his favor.
Disproportioned friendships ever terminate in disgust, and I thought,
notwithstanding all his ease, that he seemed perfectly sensible of the
distance between us.  Let us keep to companions of our

<pb n="38"/> own rank.  There is no character more contemptible than
a man that is a fortune-hunter; and I can see no reason why
fortune-hunting women should not be contemptible too.  Thus, at best,
we shall be contemptible if his views be honorable; but if they be
otherwise! I should shudder but to think of that! It is true I have no
apprehensions f rom the conduct of my children; but I think there are
some from his character." I would have proceeded, but f or the
interruption of a servant f rom the 'Squire, who, with his compliments,
sent a side of venison, and a promise to dine with us some days after.
This well-timed present pleaded more powerfully in his favor than any
thing I had to say could obviate.  I therefore continued silent, satisfied
with just having pointed out danger, and leaving it to their own
discretion to avoid it.  That virtue which requires to be ever guarded, is
scarcely worth the sentinel.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="6" id="d11"><pb n="39"/>
<head>The Happiness of a Country Fireside. </head>
<p>As we carried on the former dispute with some degree of warmth,
in order to accommodate matters, it was universally agreed that we
should have a part of the venison for supper, and the girls undertook the
task with alacrity.  "I am sorry," cried I, "that we have no neighbor or
stranger to take a part in this good cheer: feasts of this kind acquire a
double relish from hospitality."-"Bless me," cried my wife, "here comes
our good friend, Mr. Burchell, that saved our Sophia, and that ran you
down fairly in the argument.""Confute me in argument, child!" cried
I. "You mistake there, my dear.  I believe there are but few that can do
that.  I never dispute your abilities at making a goose-pie, and I beg
you'll leave argument to me." As I spoke, poor Mr. Burchell entered the
house, and was welcomed by the family, who shook him heartily by the
hand, while little Dick officiously reached him a chair.</p>
<p>I was pleased with the poor man's friendship for two reasons:
because I knew that he wanted mine, and

<pb n="40"/> I knew him to be friendly as far as he was able.  He was
known in our neighborhood by the character of the poor gentleman that
would do no good when he was young, though he was not yet thirty.  He
would at intervals talk with great good-sense; but in general he was
fondest of the company of children, whom he used to call harmless little
men.  He was famous, I     found, for singing them
ballads and telling them stories, and seldom went out without something
in his pockets for them; a piece of gingerbread or a halfpenny whistle.
He generally came for a few days into our neighborhood once a year and
lived upon the neighbors' hospitality.  He sat down to supper among us,
and my wife was not sparing of her gooseberry wine.  The tale went
round; he sang us old songs, and gave the children the story of The Buck
of Beverland,

<pb n="41"/> with the history of Patient Grissel, the
adventures of Catskin, and then Fair Rosamond's Bower.  Our cock,
which always crew at eleven, now told us it was time to repose; but an
unforeseen difficulty started about lodging the stranger: all our beds were
already taken up, and it was too late to send him to the next ale-house.
In this dilemma, little Dick offered him his part of the bed, if his brother
Moses would let him lie with him.  "And I," cried Bill, "will give Mr.
Burchell my part, if my sisters will take me to theirs."-"Well done, my
good children," cried I; "hospitality is one of the first Christian duties.
The beast retires to its shelter, and the bird flies to its nest, but helpless
man can only find refuge from his fellow creature.  The greatest stranger
in the world, was He that came to save it.  He never had a house, as if
willing to see what hospitality was left remaining amongst us.  Deb
orah, my dear," cried I to my wife, "give those boys a lump of sugar
each; and let Dick's be the largest because he spoke first."</p>
<p>In the morning early I called out my whole family to help at saving an
after-growth of hay, and our guest offering his assistance, he was
accepted among the number.  Our labors went on lightly; we turned the
swath to the wind.  I went foremost, and the rest followed in due
succession.  I could not avoid, however, observing the assiduity of Mr.
Burchell in assisting my daughter Sophia in her part of the task.  When

<pb n="42"/> he had finished his own, he would join in hers, and enter
into a close conversation; but I had too good an opinion of Sophia's
understanding, and was too well convinced of her ambition, to be under
uneasiness from a man of broken fortune.  When we were finished for
the day, Mr. Burchell was invited as on the night before; but he refused,
as he was to lie that night at a neighbor's, to whose child he was
carrying a whistle.  When gone, our conversation at supper turned upon
our late unfortunate guest.  "What a strong instance," said I, "is that
poor man of the miseries attending a youth of levity and extravagance!
He by no means wants sense, which only serves to aggravate his former
folly. Poor forlorn creature, where are now the revellers, the flatterers,
that he could once inspire and command! Gone, perhaps, to attend the
bagnio pander, grown rich by his extravagance.  They once praised him,
and now they applaud the pander; their former raptures at his wit are
now converted into sarcasms at his folly: he is poor, and perhaps
deserves poverty: for he has neither the ambition to be independent, nor
the skill to be useful."  Prompted perhaps by some secret reasons, I
delivered this observation with too much acrimony, which my Sophia
gently reproved.  "Whatsoever his former conduct may have been,
papa, his circumstances should exempt him from censure now.  His
present indigence is a sufficient punishment for former folly; and I have
heard my papa himself say, that we

<pb n="43"/> should never strike one unnecessary blow at a victim
over whom Providence holds the scourge of its resentment."-"You are
right, Sophy," cried my son Moses, "and one of the ancients finely
represents so malicious a conduct, by the attempts of a rustic to flay
Marsyas, whose skin, the fable tells us, had been wholly stripped off by
another.  Besides, I don't know if this poor man's situation be so bad as
my father would represent it. We are not to judge of the feelings of
others, by what we might feel if in their place.  However dark the
habitation of the mole to our eyes, yet the animal itself finds the
apartment sufficiently lightsome; and, to confess a truth, this man's
mind seems fitted to his station; for I never heard any one more sprightly
than he was to-day when he conversed with you." This was said without
the least design; however, it excited a blush, which she strove to cover
by an affected laugh, assuring him that she scarcely took any notice of
what he said to her; but that she believed he might once have been a
very fine gentleman.  The readiness with which she undertook to
vindicate herself, and her blushing, were symptoms I did not internally
approve; but I repressed my suspicions.</p>
<p>As we expected our landlord the next day, my wife went to make
the venison pasty.  Moses sat reading, while I taught the little ones; my
daughters seemed equally busy with the rest; and I observed them for a
good while cooking something over the fire.  I at first

<pb n="44"/>   supposed they were assisting their mother; but little
Dick informed me in a whisper, that they were making a wash for the
face.  Washes of all kinds I had a natural antipathy to; for I knew that
instead of mending the complexion they spoiled it.  I therefore
approached my chair by sly degrees to the fire, and grasping the poker,
as if it wanted mending, seemingly by accident, overturned the whole
composition, and it was too late to begin another.</p>

<head>A Town Wit Described-The Dullest Fellows may Learn to be
Comical for a Night or Two. </head>
<p>WHEN the morning arrived on which we were to entertain our
young landlord, it may be easily supposed what provisions were
exhausted to make an appearance.  It may also be conjectured that my
wife and daughters expanded their gayest plumage upon this occasion.
Mr. Thornhill came with a couple of friends, his chaplain and feeder.
The servants, who were numerous, he politely ordered to the next
ale-house; but my wife, in the triumph of her heart, insisted on
entertaining them all; for which, by the by, our family was pinched for
three weeks after.  As Mr. Burchell had hinted to us the day before that
he was making proposals of marriage to Miss Wilmot, my son
George's former mistress, this a good deal damped the heartiness of his
reception; but accident, in some measure, relieved our embarrassment,
for one of the company happening to mention her name, Mr. Thornhill
observed with an oath that he never knew anything more absurd than
calling such a fright a beauty, "For,

<pb n="46"/> strike me ugly!" continued he, "if I should not find as
much pleasure in choosing my mistress by the information of a lamp
under the clock at St. Dunstan's." At this he laughed, and so did we:-the
jests of the rich are ever successful.  Olivia, too, could not avoid
whispering loud enough to be heard, that he had an infinite fund of
humor.</p>
<p>After dinner I began with my usual toast, the Church.  For this I
was thanked by the chaplain, as he said the Church was the only mistress
of his affections.  "Come, tell us honestly, Frank," said the 'Squire,
with his usual archness, "suppose the Church, your present mistress,
dressed in lawn sleeves, on one hand, and Miss Sophia, with no lawn
about her, on the other, which would you be for?"-"For both, to be
sure," cried the chaplain.-"Right, Frank," cried the 'Squire; "for may
this glass suffocate me, but a fine girl is worth all the priestcraft in the
creation.  For what are tithes and tricks but an imposition, all a
confounded imposture, and I can prove it!"-"I wish you would," cried
my son Moses; "and I think," continued he, "that I should be able to
answer you."-"Very well, sir," cried the 'Squire, who immediately
smoked him, and winking on the rest of the company, to prepare us for
the sport, "if you are for a cool argument upon that subject, I am ready
to accept the challenge.  And first, whether are you for managing it
analogically, or dialogically?"-"I am for managing it rationally," cried

<pb n="47"/>   Moses, quite happy at being permitted to dispute.
"Good again," cried the 'Squire; "and firstly, of the first.  I hope you'll
not deny that whatever is, is.  If you don't grant me that, I can go no
further.""Why," returned Moses, "I think I may grant that, and make
the best of it."-"I hope too," returned the other, "you'll grant that a part
is less than the whole." -"I grant that too," cried Moses; "it is but just
and reasonable."-"I hope," cried the 'Squire, "you will not deny that the
three angles of a triangle are equal to two right ones."-"Nothing can be
plainer," returned t'other, and looked round with his usual im
portance.-"Very well," cried the 'Squire, speaking very quickly; "the
premises being thus settled, I proceed to observe that the concatenation
of self-existence, proceeding in a reciprocal duplicate ratio, naturally
produces a problematical dialogism, which in some measure proves that
the essence of spirituality may be referred to the second
predicable."-"Hold, hold!" cried the other, "I deny that.  Do you think I
can thus tamely submit to such heterodox doctrines?""What!" replied
the 'Squire, as if in a passion, "not submit! Answer me one plain
question: Do you think Aristotle right when he says that relatives are re
lated?"-"Undoubtedly," replied the other.-"If so, then," cried the
'Squire, "answer me directly to what I propose: Whether do you judge
the analytical investigation of the first part of my enthymem deficient
secundum

<pb n="48"/> quoad, or quoad minus, and give me your reasons: give
me your reasons, I say, directly."-"I protest!" cried Moses.  "I don't
rightly comprehend the force of your reasoning; but if it be reduced to
one simple proposition, I fancy it may then have an answer."-"O sir!"
cried the 'Squire, "I am your most humble servant; I find you want me
to furnish you with argument and intellects too.  No, sir, there I protest
you are too hard for me." This effectually raised the laugh against poor
Moses, who sat the only dismal figure in a group of merry faces; nor did
he offer a single syllable more during the whole entertainment.</p>
<p>But though all this gave me no pleasure, it had a very different
effect upon Olivia, who mistook it for humor, though but a mere act of
the memory.  She thought him, therefore, a very fine gentleman, and
such as consider what powerful ingredients a good figure, fine clothes,
and fortune are in that character, will easily forgive her.  Mr. Thornhill,
notwithstanding his real ignorance, talked with ease, and could ex
patiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency.  It is not
surprising, then, that such talents should win the affections of a girl who
by education was taught to value an appearance in herself, and con
sequently to set a value upon it in another.</p>
<p>Upon his departure, we again entered into a debate upon the merits
of our young landlord.  As he directed his looks and conversation to
Olivia, it was no longer

<pb n="49"/> doubted but that she was the object that induced him to
be our visitor.  Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent
raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion.  Even Deborah
herself seemed to share the glory of the day, and exulted in her daugh
ter's victory as if it were her own.  "And now, my dear," cried she to
me, "I'll fairly own that it was I that instructed my girls to encourage
our landlord's addresses.  I had always some ambition, and you now see
that I was right; f or who knows how this may end?"-"Ay, who knows
that indeed!" answered I, with a groan.  "For my part, I don't like it,
and I could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest,
than this fine gentleman with his fine fortune and infidelity; for depend
on 't, if he be what I suspect him, no freethinker shall ever have a child
of mine.  "</p>
<p>"Sure, father," cried Moses, "you are too severe in this: for
Heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks, but for what he does.
Every man has a thousand vicious thoughts, which arise without his
power to suppress.  Thinking freely of religion may be involuntary
with this gentleman; so that allowing his sentiments to be wrong, yet as
he is purely passive in his assent, he is no more to be blamed for his
errors, than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is
obliged to afford an invading enemy."</p>
<p>"True, my son," cried I; "but if the governor invites

<pb n="50"/> the enemy there, he is justly culpable.  And such is
always the case with those who embrace error.  The vice does not lie in
assenting to the proof s they see, but in being blind to many of the proof
s that offer.  So that though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when
formed, yet as we have been wilfully corrupt, or very negligent in
forming them, we deserve punishment for our vice, or contempt for our
folly."</p>
<p>My wife now kept up the conversation, though not the argument.
She observed that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were
freethinkers and made very good husbands; and she knew some sensible
girls that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses.  "And who
knows, my dear," continued she, "what Olivia may be able to do? The
girl has a great deal to say -upon every subject, and to my knowledge is
very skilled in controversy."</p>
<p>"Why, my dear, what controversy can she have read?" cried I. "It
does not occur to me that I ever put such books into her hands; you
certainly overrate her merit."</p>
<p>"Indeed, papa," replied Olivia, "she does not.  I have read a great
deal of controversy.  I have read the disputes between Thwackum and
Square, the controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday the
savage, and I am now employed in reading the controversy in 'Re
ligious Courtship.'"</p>

<pb n="51"/>
<p>"Very well," cried I, "that's a good girl; I find you are perfectly
qualified for making converts, and so go help your mother to make the
gooseberry-pie."</p>

<head>An Amour Which Promises Little Good Fortune; yet May Be
Productive of Much. </head>
<p>THE next morning we were again visited by Mr. Burchell, though
I began, for certain reasons, to be displeased with the frequency of his
return; but I could not refuse him my company and fireside.  It is true
his labor more than requited his entertainment, for he wrought among us
with vigor, and either in the meadow or at the hay-rick put himself
foremost.  Besides, he had always something amusing to say that
lessened our toil, and was at once so out of the way, and yet so sensible,
that I loved, laughed at, and pitied him.  My only dislike arose from an
attachment he discovered to my daughter.  He would, in a jesting man
ner, call her his little mistress, and when he bought each of the girls a
set of ribands, hers was the finest.  I knew not how, but he every day
seemed to become more amiable, his wit to improve, and his simplicity
to assume the superior airs of wisdom.</p>
<p>Our family dined in the field, and we sat, or rather reclined, round
a temperate repast, our cloth spread

<pb n="53"/> upon the hay, while Mr. Burchell gave  cheerfulness to
the feast.  To heighten our satisfaction, two blackbirds answered each
other from opposite hedges, the familiar redbreast came and pecked the
crumbs from our hands, and every sound seemed but the echo of
tranquillity.  "I never sit thus," said Sophia, "but I think of the two
lovers so sweetly described by Mr. Gray, who were struck dead in each
other's arms.  There is something so pathetic in the description, that I
have read it a hundred times with new rapture.""In my opinion," cried
my son, "the finest strokes in that description are much below those in
the 'Acis and Galatea' of Ovid.  The Roman poet understands the use of
contrast better, and upon that figure artfully managed, all strength in the
pathetic depends." @@ "It is remarkable," cried Mr. Burchell, "that both
the poets you mention have equally contributed to introduce a false taste
into their respective countries, by loading all their lines with epithet.
Men of little genius found them most easily imitated in their defects, and
English poetry, like that in the later empire of Rome, is nothing at
present but a combination of luxuriant images, without plot or
connection; a string of epithets that improve the sound, without carrying
on the sense.  But perhaps, madam, while I thus reprehend others, you'll
think it just that I should give them an opportunity to retaliate, and
indeed I have made this remark only to have an opportunity of
introducing to the company

<pb n="54"/> a ballad, which, whatever be its other defects, is, I think,
at least free from those I have mentioned." </p>

<lg type="verse">

<head>A BALLAD</head>
<l n="1">  "Turn, gentle Hermit of the Dale,</l>
<l n="2">And guide my lonely way,</l>
<l n="3">  To where yon taper cheers the vale</l>
<l n="4">With hospitable ray. </l>
<l n="5">  "For here forlorn and lost I tread,</l>

<l n="9">  "Forbear, my son," the Hermit cries,</l>
<l n="10">"To tempt the dangerous gloom;</l>
<l n="11">  For yonder faithless phantom flies</l>
<l n="12">To lure thee to thy doom. </l>
<l n="13">  "Here to the houseless child of want</l>
<l n="14">My door is open still;</l>
<l n="15">  And though my portion is but scant,</l>
<l n="16">I give it with good-will. </l>
<l n="17">  "Then turn to-night and freely share</l>
<l n="18">Whate'er my cell bestows;</l>
<l n="19">  My rushy couch and frugal fare,</l>
<l n="20">My blessing and repose. </l>
<l n="21">  "No flocks that range the valley free,</l>
<l n="22">To slaughter I condemn;</l>
<l n="23">  Taught by that Power that pities me,</l>
<l n="24">I learn to pity them: </l>
<l n="25">  "But from the mountain's grassy side,</l>
<l n="26">A guiltless feast I bring;</l>
<l n="27">  A scrip with herbs and fruit supplied,</l>
<l n="28">And water from the spring.</l>

<pb n="55"/>
<l n="29">  "Then, pilgrim, turn, thy cares forego;</l>

<l n="37">  Far in a wilderness obscure,</l>
<l n="38">The lonely mansion lay;</l>
<l n="39">  A refuge to the neighboring poor,</l>
<l n="40">And strangers led astray.</l>

<pb n="56"/>
<l n="41">  No stores beneath its humble thatch</l>
<l n="42">Requir'd a master's care;</l>
<l n="43">  The wicket, opening with a latch,</l>

<l n="45">  And now, when busy crowds retire</l>
<l n="46">To take their ev'ning rest;</l>
<l n="47">  The Hermit trimm'd his little fire,</l>

<l n="56">The crackling faggot flies. </l>
<l n="57">  But nothing could a charm impart</l>
<l n="58">To soothe the stranger's woe;</l>
<l n="59">  For grief was heavy at his heart,</l>
<l n="60">And tears began to flow. </l>
<l n="61">  His rising cares the Hermit spied,</l>
<l n="62">With answ'ring care opprest:</l>
<l n="63">  "And whence, unhappy youth," he cried,</l>
<l n="64">"The sorrows of thy breast? </l>
<l n="65">  "From better habitations spurn'd,</l>
<l n="66">Reluctant dost thou rove?</l>
<l n="67">  Or grieve for friendship unreturn'd,</l>
<l n="68">Or unregarded love? </l>
<l n="69">  "Alas! the joys that fortune brings</l>
<l n="70">Are trifling, and decay;</l>
<l n="71">  And those who prize the paltry things,</l>
<l n="72">More trifling still than they.</l>

<pb n="57"/>
<l n="73">  "And what is friendship but a name,</l>
<l n="74">A charm that lulls to sleep;</l>
<l n="75">  A shade that follows wealth or fame,</l>
<l n="76">But leaves the wretch to weep? </l>
<l n="77">  "And love is still an emptier sound,</l>
<l n="78">The modern fair one's jest:</l>
<l n="79">  On earth unseen, or only found</l>
<l n="80">To warm the turtle's nest. </l>
<l n="81">  "For shame, fond youth, thy sorrows hush,</l>
<l n="82">And spurn the sex," he said:</l>
<l n="83">  But while he spoke, a rising blush</l>
<l n="84">His lovelorn guest betray'd. </l>
<l n="85">  Surprised he sees new beauties rise,</l>
<l n="86">Swift mantling to the view;</l>
<l n="87">  Like colors o'er the morning skies,</l>

<l n="89">  The bashful look, the rising breast,</l>

<l n="101">  "My father liv'd beside the Tyne,</l>

<l n="105">  "To win me from his tender arms,</l>

<l n="133">  "Till quite dejected with my scorn,</l>

</lg>
<p>While this ballad was reading, Sophia seemed to mix an air of
tenderness with her approbation.  But our tranquillity was soon disturbed
by the report of a gun just by us, and immediately after a man was seen
bursting through the hedge, to take up the game he had killed.  This
sportsman was the 'Squire's chaplain, who had shot one of the blackbirds
that so agreeably

<pb n="60"/>   entertained us.  So loud a report, and so near, startled
my daughters; and I could perceive that Sophia, in the fright, had thrown
herself into Mr. Burchell's arms for protection.  The gentleman came
up, and asked pardon for having disturbed us, affirming that he was
ignorant of our being so near.  He therefore sat down by my youngest
daughter, and, sportsman-like, offered her what he had killed that
morning.  She was going to refuse; but a private look from her mother
soon induced her to correct the mistake, and accept his present, though
with some reluctance.  My wife, as usual, discovered her pride in a
whisper, observing, that Sophy had made a conquest of the chaplain, as
well as her sister had of the 'Squire.  I suspected, however, with more
probability, that her affections were placed upon a different object.  The
chaplain's errand was to inform us that Mr. Thornhill had provided
music and refreshments, and intended that night giving the young ladies
a ball by moonlight, on the grass-plot before our door.  "Nor can I
deny," continued he, "but I have an interest in being first to deliver this
message, as I expect for my reward to be honored with Miss Sophy's
hand as a partner." To this my girl replied, that she should have no
objection, if she could do it with honor.  "But here," continued she, "is
a gentleman," looking at Mr. Burchell, "who has been my companion in
the task of the day, and it is fit he should share in its amusements." Mr.
Burchell returned her a compliment

<pb n="61"/> for her intentions; but resigned her up to the chaplain,
adding that he was to go that night five miles, being invited to a harvest
supper.  His refusal appeared to be a little extraordinary, nor could I
conceive how so sensible a girl as my youngest could thus prefer a man
of broken fortunes to one whose expectations were much
greater.</p>
<p>But as men are most capable of distinguishing merit in women, so
the ladies often form the truest judgments of us.  The two sexes seem
placed as spies upon each other, and are furnished with different
abilities, adapted for mutual inspection.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="d14"><pb n="62"/>
<head>Two Ladies of Great Distinction Introduced-Superior Finery
Ever Seems to Confer Superior Breeding. </head>
<p>MR. BURCHELL had scarcely taken leave, and Sophia consented
to dance with the chaplain, when my little ones came running out to tell
us that the 'Squire was come with a crowd of company.  Upon our
return, we found our landlord, with a couple of under-gentlemen and two
young ladies richly dressed, whom he introduced as women of very
great distinction and fashion from town.  We happened not to have
chairs enough for the whole company; but Mr. Thornhill immediately
proposed that every gentleman should sit in a lady's lap.  This I
positively objected to, notwithstanding a look of disapprobation from my
wife.  Moses was therefore sent to borrow a couple of chairs; and as we
were in want of ladies to make up a set at countrydances, the two
gentlemen went with him in quest of a couple of partners.  Chairs and
partners were soon provided.  The gentlemen returned with my neighbor
Flamborough's rosy daughters, flaunting with red topknots, But an
unlucky circumstance was not

<pb n="63"/>   adverted to; though the Miss Flamboroughs were reck
oned the very best dancers in the parish, and understood the jig and the
round-about to perfection, yet they were totally unacquainted with
country-dances.  This at first discomposed us; however, after a little
shoving and dragging, they at last went merrily on.  Our music consisted
of two fiddles, with a pipe and tabor.  The moon shone bright.  Mr.
Thornhill and my eldest daughter led up the ball, to the great delight of
the spectators; for the neighbors hearing what was going forward, came
flocking about us.  My girl moved with so much grace and vivacity, that
my wife could not avoid discovering the pride of her heart, by assuring
me that though the little chit did it so cleverly, all the steps were stolen
from herself.  The ladies of the town strove hard to be equally easy, but
without success.  They swam, sprawled, languished, and frisked; but
all would not do; the gazers indeed owned that it was fine; but neighbor
Flamborough observed that Miss Livy's feet seemed as pat to the music
as its echo.  After the dance had continued about an hour, the two ladies,
who were apprehensive of catching cold, moved to break up the ball.
One of them, I thought, expressed her sentiments upon this occasion in a
very coarse manner, when she observed that by the "living jingo, she
was all of a muck of sweat." Upon our return to the house, we found a
very elegant cold supper, which Mr. Thornhill had ordered to be brought
with

<pb n="64"/> him.  The conversation at this time was more reserved
than before.  The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade; for they
would talk of nothing but high life, and high-lived company; with other
fashionable topics, such as pictures, taste, Shakespeare, and the musical
glasses.  'Tis true, they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping
out an oath; but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their
distinction (though I am since informed that swearing is perfectly
unfashionable).  Their finery, however, threw a veil over any grossness
in their conversation.  My daughters seemed to regard their superior
accomplishments with envy; and what appeared amiss was ascribed to
tip-top quality breeding.  But the condescension of the ladies was still
superior to their other accomplishments.  One of them observed that
were Miss Olivia to see a little more of the world, it would greatly
improve her: to which the other added that a single winter in town would
make little Sophia quite another thing.  My wife warmly assented to
both; adding that there was nothing she more ardently wished than to
give her girls a single winter's polishing.  To this I could not help
replying that their breeding was already superior to their fortune; and
that greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridic
ulous, and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess.
"And what pleasures," cried Mr. Thornhill, "do they not deserve to
possess, who have

<pb n="65"/> so much in their power to bestow? As for my part,"
continued he, "my fortune is pretty large; love, liberty, and pleasure, are
my maxims; but curse me, if a settlement of half my estate could give
my charming Olivia pleasure, it should be hers; and the only favor I
would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit." I was not
such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the
fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the basest proposal; but I
made an effort to suppress my resentment.  "Sir," cried I, "the family
which you now condescend to favor with your company has been bred
with as nice a sense of honor as you.  Any attempts to injure that may be
attended with very dangerous consequences.  Honor, sir, is our only
possession at present, and of that last treasure we must be particularly
careful." I was soon sorry for the warmth in which I had spoken this,
when the young gentleman, grasping my hand, swore he commended my
spirit, though he disapproved my suspicions.  "As to your present
hint," continued he, "I protest nothing was farther from my heart than
such a thought.  No, by all that's tempting, the virtue that will stand a
regular siege was never to my taste; for all my amours are carried by a
coup de main,"</p>
<p>The two ladies, who affected to be ignorant of the rest, seemed
highly displeased with this last stroke of freedom, and began a very
discreet and serious dialogue upon virtue: in this my wife, the chaplain,
and

<pb n="66"/> I soon joined; and the 'Squire himself was at last brought
to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses.  We talked of the
pleasures of temperance, and of the sunshine in the mind unpolluted with
guilt.  I was so well pleased, that my little ones were kept up beyond the
usual time to be edified by so much good conversation.  Mr. Thornhill
even went beyond me, and demanded if I had any objection to giving
prayers.  I joyfully embraced the proposal, and in this manner the night
was passed in a most comfortable way, till at last the company began to
think of returning.  The ladies seemed very unwilling to part with my
daughters, for whom they had conceived a particular affection, and
joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home.  The
'Squire seconded the proposal, and my wife added her entreaties; the
girls, too, looked upon me as if they wished to go.  In this perplexity I
made two or three excuses which my daughters as readily removed, so
that at last I was obliged to give a peremptory refusal, for which we had
nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing.</p>

<p>I Now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon
temperance, simplicity, and contentment were entirely disregarded.  The
distinctions lately paid us by our betters awakened that pride which I had
laid asleep, but not removed.  Our windows again, as formerly, were
filled with washes for the neck and face.  The sun was dreaded as an
enemy to the skin without doors, and the fire as a spoiler of the
complexion within. My wife observed that rising too early would hurt
her daughters' eyes, that working after dinner would redden their noses,
and she convinced me that the hands never looked so white as when they
did nothing.  Instead, therefore, of finishing George's shirts, we now
had them new-modeling their old gauzes, or flourishing upon catgut.
The poor Miss Flamboroughs, their former gay companions, were cast
off as mean acquaintance, and the whole conversation ran upon high
life and high-lived company, with pictures, taste, Shakespeare, and the
musical glasses.</p>

<pb n="68"/>
<p>But we could have borne all this, had not a fortunetelling gypsy
come to raise us into perfect sublimity.  The tawny sibyl no sooner
appeared than my girls came running to me for a shilling apiece, to cross
her hand with silver.  To say the truth, I was tired of being always wise,
and could not help gratifying their request, because I loved to see them
happy.  I gave each of them a shilling, though, for the honor of the fam
ily, it must be observed that they never went without money themselves,
as my wife always generously let them have a guinea each to keep in
their pockets, but with strict injunctions never to change it.  After they
had been closeted up with the fortune-teller for some time, I knew by
their looks, upon their returning, that they had been promised something
great.  "Well, my girls, how have you sped? Tell me, Livy, has the for
tune-teller given thee a pennyworth?"-"I protest papa," says the girl, "I
believe she deals with somebody that is not right, for she positively
declared that I am to be married to a 'squire in less than a twelve
month!"-"Well, now, Sophy, my child," said I, "and what sort of a
husband are you to have?"Sir," replied she, "I am to have a lord soon
after my sister 'has married the 'squire."-"How," cried I, "is that all you
are to have for your two shillings! Only a lord and a 'squire for two
shillings! You fools, I could have promised you a prince and a nabob for
half the money!"</p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p>This curiosity of theirs, however, was attended with very serious
effects; we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars to
something exalted, and already anticipated our future grandeur.</p>
<p>It has been a thousand times observed, and I must observe it once
more, that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more
pleasing than those crowned with fruition.  In the first case, we cook the
dish to our own appetite; in the latter, nature cooks it for us.  It is
impossible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we called up for our
entertainment.  We looked upon our fortunes as once more rising; and as
the whole parish asserted that the 'Squire was in love with my daughter,
she was actually so with him, for they persuaded her into the passion.
In this agreeable interval my wife had the most lucky dreams in the
world, which she took care to tell us every morning with great solemnity
and exactness.  It was one night a coffin and crossbones, the sign of an
approaching wedding; at another time she imagined her daughters'
pockets filled with farthings, a certain sign of their being shortly stuffed
with gold.  The girls themselves had their omens.  They felt strange
kisses on their lips; they saw rings in the candle; purses bounced from
the fire, and true-love knots lurked in the bottom of every tea-cup.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town
ladies, in which, with their compliments, they hoped to see all our
family at church the Sunday

<pb n="70"/> following.  All Saturday morning, I could perceive, in
consequence of this, my wife and daughters in close conference together,
and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot.
To be sincere, I had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was
preparing for appearing with splendor the next day.  In the evening they
began their operations in a very regular manner, and my wife undertook
to conduct the siege.  After tea, when I seemed in spirits, she began
thus: "I fancy, Charles, my dear, we shall have a great deal of good
company at our church to-morrow." -"Perhaps we may, my dear,"
returned I; "though you need be under no uneasiness about that, you
shall have a sermon whether there be or not.""That is what I expect,"
returned she; "but I think, my dear, we ought to appear there as decently
as possible, for who knows what may happen?"-"Your precautions,"
replied I, "are highly commendable.  A decent behavior and appearance
in church is what charms me.  We should be devout and humble,
cheerful and serene.""Yes," cried she, "I know that; but I mean we
should go there in as proper a manner as possible; not altogether like
the scrubs about us."-"You are quite right, my dear," returned I, "and I
was going to make the very same proposal.  The proper manner of going
is to go there as early as possible, to have time for meditation before the
service begins."-"Phoo, Charles!" interrupted she; "all that is very true,
but

<pb n="71"/> not what I would be at.  I mean we should go there
genteelly.  You know the church is two miles off, and I protest I don't
like to see my daughters trudging up to their pew all blowzed and red
with walking, and looking for all the world as if they had been winners
at a smock race.  Now, my dear, my proposal is this: there are our two
plough horses, the colt that has been in our family these nine years, and
his companion Blackberry, that has scarcely done an earthly thing for
this month past.  They are both grown fat and lazy.  Why should not
they do something as well as we? And let me tell you, when Moses has
trimmed them a little, they will cut a very tolerable figure."</p>
<p>To this proposal I objected that walking would be twenty times
more genteel than such a paltry conveyance, as Blackberry was
wall-eyed and the colt wanted a tail; that they had never been broke to
the rein, but had a hundred vicious tricks; and that we had but one
saddle and pillion in the whole house.  All these objections, however,
were overruled; so that I was obliged to comply.  The next morning I
perceived them not a little busy in collecting such materials as might be
necessary for the expedition, but as I found it would be a business of
time, I walked on to the church before, and they promised speedily to
follow.  I waited near an hour in the reading-desk for their arrival, but
not finding them come as I expected, I was obliged to begin, and went
through the service, not without

<pb n="72"/>   some uneasiness at finding them absent.  This was in
creased when all was finished, and no appearance of the family.  I
therefore walked back by the horse-way, which was five miles round,
though the foot-way was but two, and when I got about half-way home,
perceived the procession marching slowly forward towards the church;
my son, my wife and the two little ones exalted upon one horse, and my
two daughters upon the other.  I demanded the cause of their delay; but I
soon found by their looks they had met with a thousand misfortunes on
the road.  The horses had at first refused to move from the door, till Mr.
Burchell was kind enough to beat them forward for about two hundred
yards with his cudgel.  Next, the straps of my wife's pillion broke down,
and they were obliged to stop to repair them before they could proceed.
After that, one of the horses took it into his bead to stand still, and
neither blows nor entreaties could prevail with him to proceed.  They
were just recovering from this dismal situation when I found them; but
perceiving every thing safe, I own their present mortification did not
much displease me, as it would give me many opportunities of future
triumph, and teach my daughters more humility.</p>

<head>The Family Still Resolve to Hold Up Their Heads. </head>
<p>MICHAELMAS-EVE, happening on the next day, we were invited
to burn nuts and play tricks at neighbor Flamborough's.  Our late
mortifications had humbled us a little, or it is probable we might have
rejected such an invitation with contempt; however, we suffered
ourselves to be happy.  Our honest neighbor's goose and dumplings were
fine, and the lamb's-wool, even in the opinion of my wife, who was a
connoisseur, was excellent.  It is true his manner of telling stories was
not quite so well; they were very long and very dull, and all about
himself, and we had laughed at them ten times before; however, we
were kind enough to laugh at them once more.</p>
<p>Mr. Burchell, who was of the party, was always fond of seeing
some innocent amusement going forward, and set the boys and girls to
blind-man's-buff.  My wife, too, was persuaded to join in the diversion,
and it gave me pleasure to think she was not yet too old.  In the
meantime my neighbor and I looked on,

<pb n="74"/>   laughed at every feat, and praised our own dexterity
when we were young.  Hot cockles succeeded next, questions and
commands followed that, and, last of all, they sat down to hunt the
slipper.  As every person may not be acquainted with this primeval
pastime, it may be necessary to observe that the company at this play
planted themselves in a ring upon the ground, all except one, who stands
in the middle, whose business it is to catch a shoe which the company
shove about under their hams from one to another, something like a
weaver's shuttle.  As it is impossible in this case for the lady who is up
to face all the company at once, the great beauty of the play lies in
hitting her a thump with the heel of the shoe on that side least capable of
making a defence.  It was in this manner that my eldest daughter was
hemmed in and thumped about, all blowzed in spirits, and bawling for
fair play, with a voice that might deafen a ballad-singer, when, con
fusion on confusion, who should enter the room but our two great
acquaintances from town, Lady Blarney and Miss Carolina Wilhelmina
Amelia Skeggs! Description would but beggar, therefore it is
unnecessary to describe this new mortification.  Death! To be seen by
ladies of such high breeding in such vulgar attitudes! Nothing better
could ensue from such a vulgar play of Mr. Flamborough's proposing.
We seemed stuck to the ground for some time, as if actually petrified
with amazement.</p>

<pb n="75"/>

<pb n="76"/>
<p>The two ladies had been at our house to see us, and finding us f
rom home, came after us hither, as they were uneasy to know what
accident could have kept us from the church the day before.  Olivia
undertook to be our prolocutor, and delivered the whole in a summary
way, only saying: "We were thrown from our horses." At which account
the ladies were greatly concerned; but being told the family received no
hurt, they were extremely glad; but being informed that we were almost
killed by the fright, they were vastly sorry; but hearing that we had a
very good night, they were extremely glad again.  Nothing could
exceed their complaisance to my daughters; their professions the last
evening were warm, but now they were ardent.  They protested a desire
of having a more lasting acquaintance; Lady Blarney was particularly
attached to Olivia; Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs (I love to
give the whole name) took a greater fancy to her sister.  They supported
the conversation between themselves, while my daughters sat silent,
admiring their exalted breeding.  But as every reader, however beggarly
himself, is fond of high-lived dialogues, with anecdotes of Lords,
Ladies, and Knights of the Garter, I must beg leave to give him the
concluding part of the present conversation.</p>
<p>"All that I know of the matter," cried Miss Skeggs, "is this, that it
may be true, or it may not be true; but this I can assure your Ladyship,
that the whole rout

<pb n="77"/> was in amaze; his Lordship turned all manner of col
ors, my Lady fell into a swoon, but Sir Tomkyn, drawing his sword,
swore he was hers to the last drop of his blood."</p>
<p>"Well," replied our Peeress, "this I can say, that the Duchess
never told me a syllable of the matter, and I believe her Grace would
keep nothing a secret from me.  This you may depend upon as fact, that
the next morning my Lord Duke cried out three times to his valet
de-chambre: 'Jernigan, Jernigan, Jernigan, bring me my garters!'
"</p>
<p>But previously I should have mentioned the very impolite behavior
of Mr. Burchell, who, during this discourse, sat with his face turned to
the fire, and at the conclusion of every sentence would cry out
"Fudge!"-an expression which displeased us all, and in some measure
damped the rising spirit of the conversation.</p>
<p>"Besides, my dear Skeggs," continued our Peeress, "there is
nothing of this in the copy of verses that Doctor Burdock made upon the
occasion." Fudge!</p>
<p>"I am surprised at that," cried Miss Skeggs; "for he seldom leaves
anything out, as he writes only for his own amusement.  But can your
Ladyship favor me with a sight of them?" Fudge!</p>
<p>"My dear creature," replied our Peeress, "do you think I carry
such things about me? Though they are very fine to be sure, and I think
myself something of a

<pb n="78"/>   judge; at least, I know what pleases myself.  Indeed, I
was ever an admirer of all Doctor Burdock's little pieces; for except
what he does, and our dear Countess at Hanover Square, there's nothing
comes out but the most lowest stuff in nature; not a bit of high life
among them." Fudge!</p>
<p>"Your Ladyship should except," says t'other, "your own things in
the Lady's Magazine.  I hope you'll say there's nothing low-lived there?
But I suppose we are to have no more from that quarter?" Fudge!</p>
<p>"Why, my dear," says the lady, "you know my reader and
companion has left me to be married to Captain Roach, and as my poor
eyes won't suffer me to write myself, I have been for some time looking
out for another.  A proper person is no easy matter to find, and to be
sure thirty pounds a year is a small stipend for a well-bred girt of
character, that can read, write, and behave in company; as for the chits
about town, there is no bearing them about one." Fudge!</p>
<p>"That I know," cried Miss Skeggs, "by experience.  For of the
three companions I had this last half-year, one of them ref used to do
plain-work an hour in the day, another thought twenty-five guineas a
year too small a salary, and I was obliged to send away the third,
because I suspected an intrigue with the chaplain.  Virtue, my dear
Lady Blarney, virtue is worth any price; but where is that to be found?"
Fudge!</p>
<p>My wife had been for a long time all attention to

<pb n="79"/> this discourse; but was particularly struck with the latter
part of it.  Thirty pounds and twenty-five guineas a year made fifty-six
pounds five shilling English money, all which was in a manner going
a-begging, and might easily be secured in the family.  She for a moment
studied my looks f or approbation; and, to own a truth, I was of opinion
that two such places would fit our two daughters exactly.  Besides, if the
'Squire had any real affection for my eldest daughter, this would be the
way to make her every way qualified for her fortune.  My wife,
therefore, was resolved that we should not be deprived of such
advantages for want of assurance, and undertook to harangue for the
family.  "I hope," cried she, "your Ladyships will pardon my present
presumption.  It is true, we have no right to pretend to such favors; but
yet it is natural for me to wish putting my children forward in the world.
And I will be bold to say my two girls have had a pretty good education
and capacity; at least the country can't show better.  They can read,
write, and cast accounts; they understand their needle, broad-stitch, cross
and change, and all manner of plain-work; they can pink, point, and
frill; and know something of music; they can do up small-clothes, work
upon catgut; my eldest can cut paper, and my youngest has a very pretty
manner of telling fortunes upon the cards." Fudge!</p>
<p>When she had delivered this pretty piece of eloquence, the two
ladies looked at each other a few minutes

<pb n="80"/> in silence, with an air of doubt and importance.  At last,
Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs condescended to observe that
the young ladies, from the opinion she could form of them from so slight
an acquaintance, seemed very fit for such employments.  "But a thing of
this kind, madam," cried she, addressing my spouse, "requires a
thorough examination into characters, and a more perfect knowledge of
each other.  Not, madam," continued she, "that I in the least suspect the
young ladies' virtue, prudence, and discretion; but there is a form in
these things, madam, there is a form."</p>
<p>My wife approved her suspicions very much, observing that she
was very apt to be suspicious herself; but referred her to all the
neighbors for a character; but this our Peeress declined as unnecessary,
alleging that her cousin Thornhill's recommendation would be suffi
cient, and upon this we rested our petition.</p>

</head>
<p>WHEN we returned home, the night was dedicated to schemes of
future conquest.  Deborah exerted much sagacity in conjecturing which
of the two girls was likely to have the best place, and most opportunities
of seeing good company.  The only obstacle to our preferment was in
obtaining the 'Squire's recommendation; but he had already shown us
too many instances of his friendship to doubt of it now.  Even in bed
my wife kept up the usual theme: "Well, faith, my dear Charles,
between ourselves, I think we have made an excellent day's work of
it."-"Pretty well," cried I, not knowing what to say.-"What, only pretty
well!" returned she; "I think it is very well.  Suppose the girls should
come to make acquaintances of taste in town! This I am assured of, that
London is the only place in the world for all manner of husbands.
Besides, my dear, stranger things happen every day: and as ladies of
quality are so taken with my daughters, what will not men of quality
be! Entre nous, I

<pb n="82"/>   protest I like my Lady Blarney vastly; so very oblig
ing.  However, Miss Carolina Wilhelmina Amelia Skeggs has my warm
heart.  But yet, when they came to talk of places in town, you saw at
once how I nailed them.  Tell me, my dear, don't you think I did for my
children there?"-"Ay," returned I, not knowing well what to think of the
matter; "Heaven grant that they may be both the better for it this day
three months!" This was one of those observations I usually made to
impress my wife with an opinion of my sagacity; for if the girls
succeeded, then it was a pious wish fulfilled; but if any thing
unfortunate ensued, then it might be looked upon as a prophecy.  All this
conversation, however, was only preparatory to another scheme, and
indeed I dreaded as much.  This was nothing less than, that as we were
now to hold up our heads a little higher in the world, it would be proper
to sell the colt, which was grown old, at a neighboring fair, and buy us a
horse that would carry single or double upon an occasion, and make a
pretty appearance at church or upon a visit.  This at first I opposed
stoutly; but it was as stoutly defended.  However, as I weakened, my
antagonist gained strength, till at last it was resolved to part with
him.</p>
<p>As the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of
going myself; but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and
nothing could prevail upon her to permit me from home.  "No, my
dear," said she,

<pb n="83"/>   "our son Moses is a discreet boy, and can buy and sell
to very good advantage; you know all our great bargains are of his
purchasing.  He always stands out and haggles, and actually tires them
till he gets a bargain.      </p>
<p>As I had some opinion of my son's prudence, I was willing enough
to entrust him with this commission; and the next morning I perceived
his sisters mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair; trimming his
hair, brushing his buckles, and cocking his hat with

<pb n="84"/> pins.  The business of the toilet being over, we had at
last the satisfaction of seeing him mounted upon the colt, with a deal box
before him to bring home groceries in.  He had on a coat made of that
cloth they call thunder-and-lightning, which, though grown too short,
was much too good to be thrown away.  His waistcoat was of gosling
green, and his sisters had tied his hair with a broad black riband.  We all
followed him several paces from the door, bawling after him, "Good
luck! good luck!" till we could see him no longer.</p>
<p>He was scarcely gone when Mr. Thornhill's butler came to
congratulate us upon our good fortune, saying that he overheard his
young master mention our names with great commendation.</p>
<p>Good fortune seems resolved not to come alone.  Another
footman from the same family followed, with a card for my two
daughters, importing that the two ladies had received such pleasing
accounts from Mr. Thornhill of us all, that, after a few previous
inquiries, they hoped to be perfectly satisfied.  "Ay," cried my wife, "I
now see it is no easy matter to get into the families of the great; but
when one once gets in, then, as Moses says, one may go to sleep." To
this piece of humor, for she intended it for wit, my daughters assented
with a loud laugh of pleasure.  In short, such was her satisfaction at this
message, that she actually put her hand in her pocket, and gave the
messenger sevenpence half penny.</p>

<pb n="85"/>
<p>This was to be our visiting day.  The next that came was Mr.
Burchell, who had been at the fair.  He brought my little ones a
pennyworth of gingerbread each, which my wife undertook to keep for
them, and give them by letters at a time.  He brought my daughters
also a couple of boxes, in which they might keep wafers, snuff, patches,
or even money, when they got it. My wife was unusually fond of a
weasel-skin purse, as being the most lucky; but this by the by.  We had
still a regard for Mr. Burchell, though his late rude behavior was in
some measure displeasing; nor could we now avoid communicating our
happiness to him, and asking his advice; although we seldom followed
advice, we were all ready enough to ask it.  When he read the note f
rom the two ladies, he shook his head, and observed that an affair of this
sort demanded the utmost circumspection.  This air of diffidence highly
displeased my wife.  "I never doubted, sir," cried she, "your readiness
to be against my daughters and me.  You have more circumspection than
is wanted.  However, I fancy when we come to ask advice, we shall
apply to those who seem to have made use of it them
selves."-"Whatever my own conduct may have been, madam," replied
he, "is not the present question; though as I have made no use of advice
myself, I should in conscience give it to those that will." As I was
apprehensive this answer might draw on a repartee, making up by
abuse what it wanted in wit, I

<pb n="86"/> changed the subject, by seeming to wonder what could
keep our son so long at the fair, as it was now almost nightfall.  "Never
mind our son," cried my wife; "depend upon it he knows what he is
about.  I'll warrant we'll never see him sell his hen on a rainy day.  I
have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one.  I'll tell you a
good story about that that will make you split your sides with laughing.
But as I live, yonder comes Moses, without a horse, and the box at his
back."</p>
<p>As she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweating under
the deal box which he had strapped round his shoulders like a peddler.
"Welcome, welcome, Moses; well, my boy, what have you brought us
from the fair ?"-"I have brought you myself," cried Moses, with a sly
look, and resting the box on the dresser."Ay, Moses," cried my wife,
"that we know, but where is the horse?"-"I have sold him," cried Moses,
"for three pounds five shillings and twopence."-"Well done, my good
boy," returned she, "I knew you would touch them off.  Between
ourselves, three pounds five shillings and twopence is no bad day's
work.  Come, let us have it, then."-"I have brought back no money,"
cried Moses again.  "I have laid it all out in a bargain, and here it is,"
pulling out a bundle f rom his breast; "here they are, a gross of green
spectacles, with silver rims and shagreen cases."-"A gross of green spec
tacles!" repeated my wife in a faint voice.  "And you have parted with
the colt, and brought us back nothing

<pb n="87"/> but a gross of green paltry spectacles!"-"Dear mother,"
cried the boy, "why won't you listen to reason? I had them a dead
bargain, or I should not have bought them.  The silver rims alone will
sell for double the money."-"A fig for the silver rims!" cried my wife, in
a passion; "I dare swear they won't sell for above half the money at the
rate of broken silver, five shillings an ounce."-"You need be under no
uneasiness," cried I, "about selling the rims, for they are not worth
sixpence, for I perceive they are only copper varnished over."-"What!"
cried my wife, "not silver, the rims not silver!"-"No," cried I, "no more
silver than your saucepan."-"And so," returned she, "we have parted
with the colt, and have only got a gross of green spectacles with copper
rims and shagreen cases! A murrain take such trumpery! The blockhead
has been imposed upon, and should have known his company
better."-"There, my dear," cried I, "you are wrong, he should not have
known them at all.""Marry, hang the idiot!" returned she, "to bring me
such stuff; if I had them I would throw them into the fire!"-"There again
you are wrong, my dear," cried I, "for though they be copper, we will
keep them by us, as copper spectacles, you know, are better than
nothing.  "</p>
<p>By this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived.  He now saw
that he had indeed been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who,
observing his figure, had

<pb n="88"/> marked him for an easy prey.  I therefore asked the
circumstances of his deception.  He sold the horse, it seems, and walked
the fair in search of another.  A reverend-looking man brought him to a
tent, under pretence of having one to sell.  "Here," continued Moses,
"we met another man, very well dressed, who desired to borrow twenty
pounds upon these, saying that he wanted money, and would dispose of
them for a third of the value.  The first gentleman, who pretended to
be my friend, whispered to me, to buy them, and cautioned me not to let
so good an offer pass.  I sent for Mr. Flamborough, and they talked him
up as finely as they did me, and so at last we were persuaded to buy the
two gross between us."</p>

<head>Mr. Burchell is Found to Be an Enemy: for He Has the

<p>OUR family had now made several attempts to be fine; but some
unforeseen disaster demolished each as soon as projected.  I endeavored
to take the advantage of every disappointment, to improve their
good-sense in proportion as they were frustrated in ambition.  "You see,
my children," cried I, "how little is to be got by attempts to impose upon
the world in coping with our betters.  Such as are poor and will associate
with none but the rich, are hated by those they avoid, and despised by
those they follow.  Unequal combinations are always disadvantageous
to the weaker side: the rich having the pleasure, and the poor the
inconveniences that result from them.  But come, Dick, my boy, and
repeat the fable that you were reading today, for the good of the
company."</p>
<p>"Once upon a time," cried the child, "a Giant and a Dwarf were
friends, and kept together.  They made a bargain that they would never
forsake each other, but go seek adventures.  The first battle they fought
was

<pb n="90"/> with two Saracens, and the Dwarf, who was very
courageous, dealt one of the champions a most angry blow.  It did the
Saracen very little injury, who, lifting up his sword, fairly struck off the
poor Dwarf's arm.  He was now in a woeful plight, but the Giant
coming to his assistance, in a short time left the two Saracens dead on
the plain, and the Dwarf cut off the dead man's head out of spite.  They
then travelled on to another adventure.This was against three
bloody-minded Satyrs, who were carrying away a damsel in distress.
The Dwarf was not quite so fierce now as before, but for all that struck
the first blow, which was returned by another that knocked out his eye;
but the Giant was soon up with them, and had they not fled, would
,certainly have killed them every one.  They were all very joyful for this
victory, and the damsel who was relieved fell in love with the Giant, and
married him.  They now travelled far, and farther than I can tell, till
they met with a company of robbers.  The Giant, for the first time, was
foremost now; but the Dwarf was not far behind.  The battle was stout
and long.  Wherever the Giant came, all fell before him; but the Dwarf
had like to have been killed more than once.  At last the victory declared
for the two adventurers; but the Dwarf lost his leg.  The Dwarf was now
with an arm, a leg, and an eye, while the Giant was without a single
wound.  Upon which he cried out to his little companion: 'My little
hero, this is glorious sport; let

<pb n="91"/>   us get one victory more, and then we shall have honor
forever.'-'No,' cries the Dwarf, who was by this time grown wiser, 'no,
I declare off.  I'll fight no more; for I find in every battle that you get
all the honor and rewards, but all the blows fall upon me.' "</p>
<p>I was going to moralize this fable, when our attention was called
off to a warm dispute between my wife and Mr. Burchell, upon my
daughters' intended expedition to town.  My wife very strenuously
insisted upon the advantages that would result from it.  Mr. Burchell, on
the contrary, dissuaded her with great ardor, and I stood neuter.  His
present dissuasions seemed but the second part of those which were re
ceived with so ill a grace in the morning.  The dispute grew high, while
poor Deborah, instead of reasoning stronger, talked louder, and at last
was obliged to take shelter from a defeat in clamor.  The conclusion of
her harangue, however, was highly displeasing to us all.  She knew, she
said, of some who had their own secret reasons for what they advised;
but, for her part, she wished such to stay away from her house for the
future.  "Madam," cried Burchell, with looks of great composure, which
tended to inflame her the more, "as for secret reasons, you are right.  I
have secret reasons, which I forbear to mention, because you are not
able to answer those of which I make no secret; but I find my visits here
are become troublesome.  I'll take my leave, therefore, now, and
perhaps come once more

<pb n="92"/> to take a final farewell when I am quitting the coun
try." Thus saying, he took up his hat, nor could the attempts of Sophia,
whose looks seemed to upbraid his precipitancy, prevent his
going.</p>
<p>When gone, we all regarded each other for some minutes with
confusion.  My wife, who knew herself to be the cause, strove hard to
hide her concern with a forced smile and an air of assurance, which I
was willing to reprove.</p>
<p>"How, woman!" cried I to her, "is it thus we treat strangers? Is it
thus we return their kindness? Be assured, my dear, that these were the
harshest words, and to me the most unpleasing, that ever escaped your
lips!"-"Why would he provoke me then?" replied she; "but I know the
motives of his advice perfectly well.  He would prevent my girls from
going to town, that he may have the pleasure of my youngest daugh
ter's company here at home.  But whatever happens, she shall choose
better company than such low-lived fellows as he."-"Low-lived, my
dear, do you call him?" cried I; "it is very possible we may mistake this
man's character; for he seems upon some occasions the most finished
gentleman I ever knew.  Tell me, Sophia, my girl, has he ever given you
any secret instances of his attachment?"-"His conversation with me,
sir," replied my daughter, "has ever been sensible, modest and pleasing.
As to aught else, no, never.  Once indeed, I remember to have heard
him say he never

<pb n="93"/>   knew a woman who could find merit in a man that
seemed poor."-"Such, my dear," cried I, "is the common cant of all
the unfortunate or idle.  But I hope you have been taught to judge
properly of such men, and that it would be even madness to expect
happiness from one who has been so very bad an economist of his own.
Your mother and I have now better prospects for you.  The next
winter, which you will probably spend in town, will give you
opportunities of making a more prudent choice."</p>
<p>What Sophia's reflections were upon this occasion I can't pretend
to determine; but I was not displeased at the bottom that we were rid of
a guest f rom whom I had much to fear.  Our breach of hospitality went
to my conscience a little; but I quickly silenced that monitor by two or
three specious reasons, which served to satisfy and reconcile me to
myself.  The pain which conscience gives the man who has already done
wrong, is soon got over.  Conscience is a coward, and those faults it has
not strength enough to prevent, it seldom has justice enough to
accuse.</p>

<head>Fresh Mortifications, or a Demonstration that Seeming
Calamities May Be Real Blessings. </head>
<p>THE journey of my daughters to town was now resolved upon,
Mr. Thornhill having kindly promised to inspect their conduct himself,
and inform us by letter of their behavior.  But it was thought
indispensably necessary that their appearance should equal the greatness
of their expectations, which could not be done without expense.  We
debated, therefore, in full council what were the easiest methods of
raising money; or, more properly speaking, what we could most con
veniently sell.  The deliberation was soon finished.  It was found that
our remaining horse was utterly useless for the plough, without his
companion, and equally unfit for the road, as wanting an eye; it was
therefore determined that we should dispose of him for the purpose
above mentioned, at the neighboring fair, and, to prevent imposition,
that I should go with him myself.  Though this was one of the first
mercantile transactions of my life, yet I had no doubt about acquitting
myself with reputation.  The opinion a man forms of

<pb n="95"/> his own prudence is measured by that of the company he
keeps; and as mine was mostly in the family way, I had conceived no
unfavorable sentiments of my worldly wisdom.  My wife, however,
next morning at parting, after I had got some paces from the door,
called me back to advise me, in a whisper, to have all my eyes about
me.</p>
<p>I had, in the usual forms, when I came to the fair, put my horse
through all his paces, but for some time had no bidders.  At last a
chapman approached, and, after he had a good while examined the horse
round finding him blind of one eye, he would have nothing to say to
him.  A second came up, but observing he had a spavin, declared he
would not take him for the driving home.  A third perceived he had a
windgall, and would bid no money; a fourth knew by his eye that he had
the botts; a fifth wondered what a plague I could do at the fair with a
blind, spavined, galled hack, that was only fit to be cut up for a
dog-kennel.  By this time I began to have a most hearty contempt for the
poor animal myself, and was almost ashamed at the approach of every
customer; for although I did not entirely believe all the fellows told me,
yet I reflected that the number of witnesses was a strong presumption
that they were right; and St. Gregory, upon good works, professes
himself to be of the same opinion.</p>
<p>I was in this mortifying situation, when a brotherclergyman, an
old acquaintance, who had also business

<pb n="96"/> at the fair, came up, and shaking me by the hand, pro
posed adjourning to a public-house and taking a glass
    of whatever we could get.  I readily closed with the
offer, and entering an ale-house, we were shown into a

<pb n="97"/>   little back room, where there was only a  venerable old
man, who sat wholly intent over a large book which he was reading.  I
never in my life saw a figure that prepossessed me more favorably.
His locks of silver gray venerably shaded his temples, and his green old
age seemed to be the result of health and benevolence.  However, his
presence did not interrupt our conversation; my friend and I discoursed
on the various turns of fortune we had met, the Whistonian controversy,
my last pamphlet, the archdeacon's reply, and the hard measure that was
dealt me.  But our attention was in a short time taken off by the
appearance of a youth who, entering the room, respectfully said
something softly to the old stranger.  "Make no apologies, my child,"
said the old man; "to do good is a duty we owe to all our
fellow-creatures; take this; I wish it were more; but five pounds will
relieve your distress, and you are welcome." The modest youth shed
tears of gratitude; and yet his gratitude was scarcely equal to mine.  I
could have hugged the good old man in my arms, his benevolence
pleased me so.  He continued to read, and we resumed our conversation,
until my companion, after some time, recollecting that he had busi
ness to transact in the fair, promised to be soon back, adding, that he
always desired to have as much of Dr. Primrose's company as possible.
The old gentleman, hearing my name mentioned, seemed to look at me
with attention for some time, and when my friend was gone

<pb n="98"/> most respectfully demanded if I was any way related to
the great Primrose, that courageous monogamist, who had been the
bulwark of the Church.  Never did my heart feel sincerer rapture than at
that moment.  "Sir," cried I, "the applause of so good a man, as I am
sure you are, adds to that happiness in my breast which your
benevolence has already excited.  You behold before you, sir, that Dr.
Primrose, the monogamist, whom you have been pleased to call great.
You here see that unfortunate divine, who has so long, and it would ill
become me to say, successfully fought against the deuterogamy of the
age.""Sir," cried the stranger, struck with awe, "I fear I have been too
familiar, but you'll forgive my curiosity, sir: I beg pardon."-"Sir," cried
I grasping his hand, "you are so far from displeasing me by your
familiarity, that I must beg you'll accept my friendship, as you already
have my esteem."-"Then with gratitude I accept the offer," cried he,
squeezing me by the hand, "thou glorious pillar of unshaken orthodoxy;
and do I behold-" I here interrupted what he was going to say; for
though, as an author, I could digest no small share of flattery, yet now
my modesty would permit no more.  However, no lovers in romance
ever cemented a more instantaneous friendship.  We talked upon several
subjects: at first I thought he seemed rather devout than learned, and
began to think he despised all human doctrines as dross.  Yet this no
way lessened him in my

<pb n="99"/> esteem; for I had for some time begun privately to
harbor such an opinion myself.  I therefore took occasion to observe
that the world in general began to be blamably indifferent as to doctrinal
matters, and followed human speculations too much.  "Ay, sir," re
plied he,-as if he had reserved all his learning to that moment,-"Ay, sir,
the world is in its dotage; and yet the cosmogony or creation of the
world has puzzled philosophers of all ages.  What a medley of opinions
have they not broached upon the creation of the world! Sanchoniathon,
Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus have all attempted it in vain.
The latter has these words, [Greek quotation], which imply that all things
have neither beginning nor end.  Manetho also, who lived about the time
of Nebuchadon-Asser,-Asser being a Syriac word, usually applied as a
surname to the kings of that country, as Teglat Phael-Asser,
Nabon-Asser,-he, I say, formed a conjecture equally absurd: for, as we
usually say, [Greek quotation], which implies that books will never teach
the world; so he attempted to investigate.But, sir, I ask pardon, I am
straying from the question." That he actually was; nor could I for my
life see how the creation of the world had any thing to do with the
business I was talking of; but it was sufficient to show me that he was a
man of letters, and now I reverenced him the more.  I was resolved
therefore to bring him to the touch-stone; but he was

<pb n="100"/>   too mild and too gentle to contend for victory.  When
ever I made any observation that looked like a challenge to
controversy, he would smile, shake his head, and say nothing; by which
I understood he could say much, if he thought proper.  The subject
therefore insensibly changed from the business of antiquity to that
which brought us both to the fair; mine I told him was to sell a horse,
and very luckily indeed his was to buy one f or one of his tenants.  My
horse was soon produced, and in fine we struck a bargain.  Nothing
now remained but to pay me, and he accordingly pulled out a
thirty-pound note, and bid me change it.  Not being in a capacity of
complying with his demand, he ordered his footman to be called up, who
made his appearance in a very genteel livery.  "Here, Abraham," cried
he, "go and get gold for this; you'll do it at neighbor Jackson's or
anywhere." While the fellow was gone, he entertained me with a pathetic
harangue on the great scarcity of silver, which I undertook to improve,
by deploring also the great scarcity of gold; so that by the time Abraham
returned we had both agreed that money was never so hard to be come at
as now.  Abraham returned to inform us that he had been over the
whole f air and could not get change, though he had offered half a crown
for doing it.  This was a very great disappointment to us all; but the old
gentleman having paused a little, asked me if I knew one Solomon
Flamborough in my part of the country; upon replying

<pb n="101"/> that he was my next-door neighbor: "If that be the case,
then," returned he, "I believe we shall deal.  You shall have a draft upon
him payable at sight; and, let me tell you, he is as warm a man as any
within five miles round him.  Honest Solomon and I have been ac
quainted for many years together.  I remember I always beat him at
three jumps; but he could hop on one leg farther than I." A draft upon
my neighbor was to me the same as money; for I was sufficiently
convinced of his ability.  The draft was signed and put into my hands,
and Mr. Jenkinson (the old gentleman), his man Abraham, and my
horse, old Blackberry, trotted off very well pleased with each
other.</p>
<p>After a short interval, being left to reflection, I began to recollect
that I had done wrong in taking a draft from a stranger, and so prudently
resolved upon following the purchaser, and having back my horse.  But
this was now too late: I therefore made directly homewards, resolving to
get the draft changed into money at my friend's as fast as possible.  I
found my honest neighbor smoking his pipe at his own door, and
informing him that I had a small bill upon him, he read it twice over:
"You can read the name, I suppose," cried I, "Ephraim
Jenkinson."-"Yes," returned he, "the name is written plain enough, and I
know the gentleman too,-the greatest rascal under the canopy of heaven.
This is the very same rogue who sold us the spectacles.  Was he not a
venerable looking man

<pb n="102"/> with gray hair, and no flaps to his pocket-holes? And
did he not talk a long string of learning, about Greek and cosmogony
and the world?" To this I replied with a groan.  "Ay," continued he, "he
has but that one piece of learning in the world, and he always talks it
away whenever he finds a scholar in company; but I know the rogue,
and will catch him yet."</p>
<p>Although I was already sufficiently mortified, my greatest struggle
was to come, in facing my wife and daughters.  No truant was ever
more afraid of returning to school, there to behold the master's visage,
than I was of going home.  I was determined, however, to anticipate
their fury by first falling into a passion myself.</p>
<p>But, alas! upon entering, I found the family no way disposed for
battle.  My wife and girls were all in tears, Mr. Thornhill having been
there that day to inform them that their journey to town was entirely
over.  The two ladies having heard reports of us from some malicious
person about us, were that day set out for London.  He could neither
discover the tendency nor the author of these; but whatever they might
be, or whoever might have broached them, he continued to assure our
family of his friendship and protection.  I found, therefore, that they
bore my disappointment with great resignation, as it was eclipsed in the
greatness of their own.  But what perplexed us most was to think who

<pb n="103"/>  could be so base as to asperse the character of a family
so harmless as ours, too humble to excite envy, and too inoffensive to
create disgust.</p>

<head>All Mr. Burchell's Villainy at Once Detected-The Folly of
Being Over-Wise. </head>
<p>THAT evening and a part of the following day was employed in
fruitless attempts to discover our enemies; scarcely a family in the
neighborhood but incurred our suspicions, and each of us had reasons
for our opinion best known to ourselves.  As we were in this perplexity,
one of our little boys, who had been playing abroad, brought in a
letter-case, which he found on the green.  It was quickly known to
belong to Mr. Burchell, with whom it had been seen, and, upon
examination, contained some hints upon different subjects; but what
particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note, superscribed "The
copy of a letter to be sent to the two ladies at Thornhill Castle." It in
stantly occurred that he was the base informer, and we deliberated
whether the note should not be broken open.  I was against it; but
Sophia, who said she was sure that of all men he would be the last to be
guilty of so much baseness, insisted upon its being read.  In this she was
seconded by the rest of the family, and,

<pb n="105"/> at their joint solicitation, I read as follows:
"LADIES:</p>
<p>"The bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from
whom this comes: one at least the friend of innocence, and ready to
prevent its being seduced.  I am informed for a truth, that you have
some intention of bringing two young ladies to town, whom I have
some knowledge of, under the character of companions.  As I would
neither have simplicity imposed upon, nor virtue contaminated, I must
offer it as my opinion, that the impropriety of such a step will be
attended with dangerous consequences.  It has never been my way to
treat the infamous or the lewd with severity; nor should I now have
taken this method of explaining myself, or reproving folly, did it not aim
at guilt.  Take, therefore, the admonition of a friend, and seriously
reflect on the consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats
where peace and innocence have hitherto resided." </p>
<p>Our doubts were now at an end.  There seemed, indeed,
something applicable to both sides in this letter, and its censures might as
well be referred to those to whom it was written, as to us; but the
malicious meaning was obvious, and we went no farther.  My wife had
scarcely patience to hear me to the end, but railed at the writer with
unrestrained resentment.  Olivia was equally severe, and Sophia seemed
perfectly amazed at

<pb n="106"/> his baseness.  As for my part, it appeared to me one of
the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude I had met with.  Nor could
I account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his desire of
detaining my youngest daughter in the country, to have the more
frequent opportunities of an interview.  In this manner we all sat
ruminating upon schemes of vengeance, when our other little boy came
running in to tell us that Mr. Burchell was approaching at the other end
of the field.  It is easier to conceive than describe the complicated
sensations which are felt from a pain of a recent injury, and the pleasure
of approaching vengeance.  Though our intentions were only to upbraid
him with his ingratitude, yet it was resolved to do it in a manner that
would be perfectly cutting.  For this purpose we agreed to meet him with
our usual smiles, to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kind
ness, to amuse him a little; and then in the midst of the flattering calm to
burst upon him like an earthquake, and overwhelm him with the sense
of his own baseness.  This being resolved upon, my wife undertook to
manage the business herself, as she really had some talents for such an
undertaking.  We saw him approach; he entered, drew a chair, and sat
down.  "A fine day, Mr. Burchell."-"A very fine day, Doctor; though I
fancy we shall have some rain by the shooting of my corns."-"The
shooting of your horns!" cried my wife, in a loud fit of laughter, and
then asked pardon

<pb n="107"/> for being fond of a joke.-"Dear madam," replied he,
"I pardon you with all my heart; for I protest I should not have thought
it a joke had you not told me."-"Perhaps not, sir," cried my wife,
winking at us, "and yet I dare say you can tell us how many jokes go to
an ounce."-"I fancy, madam," returned Burchell, "you have been reading
a jest-book this morning, that ounce of jokes is so very good a conceit;
and yet, madam, I had rather see half an ounce of understanding."-"I
believe you might," cried my wife, still smiling at us, though the laugh
was against her; "and yet I have seen some men pretend to understand
ing that have very little."-"And no doubt," replied her antagonist, "you
have known ladies set up for wit that had none." I quickly began to find
that my wife was likely to gain but little at this business; so I resolved
to treat him in a style of more severity myself.  "Both wit and
understanding," cried I, "are trifles without integrity; it is that which
gives value to every character.  The ignorant peasant, without fault, is
greater than the philosopher with many; for what is genius or courage
without a heart? 'An honest man is the noblest work of God.'"</p>
<p>"I always held that hackneyed maxim of Pope," returned Mr.
Burchell, "as very unworthy of a man of genius, and a base desertion of
his own superiority.  As the reputation of books is raised not by their
freedom from defect, but the greatness of their beauties,

<pb n="108"/> so should that of men be prized not for their exemp
tion from fault, but the size of those virtues they are possessed of.  The
scholar may want prudence, the statesman may have pride, and the
champion ferocity; but shall we prefer to these the low mechanic, who
laboriously plods on through life, without censure or applause? We might
as well prefer the tame, correct paintings of the Flemish school to the
erroneous, but sublime animations of the Roman pencil."</p>
<p>"Sir," replied I, "your present observation is just, when there are
shining virtues and minute defects; but when it appears that great vices
are opposed in the same mind to as extraordinary virtues, such a char
acter deserves contempt."</p>
<p>"Perhaps," cried he, "there may be some such monsters as you
describe, of great vices joined to great virtues; yet in my progress
through 'life I never yet found one instance of their existence; on the
contrary, I have ever perceived that where the mind was capacious the
affections were good.  And, indeed, Providence seems kindly our
friend in this particular, thus to debilitate the understanding where the
heart is corrupt, and diminish the power where there is the will to do
mischief.  This rule seems to extend even to other animals: the little
vermin race are ever treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, while those
endowed with strength and power are generous, brave, and
gentle."</p>
<p>"These observations sound well," returned I, "and

<pb n="109"/> yet it would be easy this moment to point out a man,"
and I fixed my eye steadfastly upon him, "whose head and heart form a
most detestable contrast.  Ay, sir," continued I, raising my voice, "and I
am glad to have this opportunity of detecting him in the midst of his
fancied security.  Do you know this, sir, this pocketbook?"-"Yes, sir,"
returned he, with a face of impenetrable assurance, "that pocket-book
is mine, and I am glad you have found it."-"And do you know," cried I,
"this letter? Nay, never falter, man, but look me full in the face; I say,
do you know this letter?""That letter," returned he, "yes, it was I that
wrote that letter."-"And how could you," said I, "so basely, so
ungratefully presume to write this letter?"-"And how came you," replied
he, with looks of unparalleled effrontery, "so basely to presume to break
open this letter? Don't you know, now, I could hang you all for this ?
All that I have to do is to swear at the next justice's that you have been
guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket-book, and so hang you all
up at this door." This piece of unexpected insolence raised me to such a
pitch that I could scarcely govern my passion.  "Ungrateful wretch,
begone! and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness; begone,
and never let me see thee again! go from my doors, and the only punish
ment I wish thee is an alarmed conscience, which will be a sufficient
tormentor!" So saying, I threw him his pocket-book, which he took up
with a smile, and, shutting

<pb n="110"/> the clasp with the utmost composure, left us, quite
astonished at the serenity of his assurance.  My wife was particularly
enraged that nothing could make him angry, or make him seem ashamed
of his villainies. "My dear," cried I, willing to calm those passions that
had been raised too high among us, "we are not to be surprised that bad
men want shame; they only blush at being detected in doing good, but
glory in their vices."</p>
<p>"Guilt and Shame," says the allegory, "were at first companions,
and in the beginning of their journey inseparably kept together.  But
their union was soon found to be disagreeable and inconvenient to both;
Guilt gave Shame frequent uneasiness, and Shame often betrayed the
secret conspiracies of Guilt.  After long disagreement, therefore, they at
length consented to part for ever.  Guilt boldly walked forward alone to
overtake Fate, that went before in the shape of an executioner; but
Shame being naturally timorous, returned back to keep company with
Virtue, which, in the beginning of their journey, they had left behind.
Thus, my children, after men have travelled through a few stages of
vice, Shame forsakes them, and returns back to wait upon the few
virtues they have still remaining."</p>

<head>The Family Use Art; Which is Opposed with Still Greater.
</head>
<p>WHATEVER might have been Sophia's sensations, the rest of the
family was easily consoled for Mr. Burchell's absence by the company
of our landlord, whose visits now became more frequent and longer.
Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the
amusements of the town as he designed, he took every opportunity of
supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would
admit of.  He usually came in the morning, and while my son and I
followed our occupations abroad, he sat with the family at home, and
amused them by describing the town, with every part of which he was
particularly acquainted.  He could repeat all the observations that were
retailed in the atmosphere of the play-houses, and had all the good things
of the high wits by rote long before they made their way into the
jest-books.  The intervals between conversation were employed in teach
ing my daughters piquet, or sometimes in setting my two little ones to
box, to make them sharp, as he called

<pb n="112"/> it: but the hopes of having him for a son-in-law in some
measure blinded us to all his imperfections.  It must be owned that my
wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him; or, to speak it more
tenderly, used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter.  If the
cakes at tea ate short and crisp, they were made by Olivia; if the
gooseberry wine was well knit, the gooseberries were of her gathering; it
was her fingers which gave the pickles their peculiar green; and in the
composition of a pudding, it was her judgment that mixed the in
gredients.  Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the 'Squire that
she thought him and Olivia extremely of a size, and would bid both stand
up to see which was the tallest.  These instances of cunning, which she
thought impenetrable, yet which everybody saw through, were very
pleasing to our benefactor, who gave every day some new proofs of his
passion, which, though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage, yet
we thought fell but little short of it, and his slowness we attributed
sometimes to native bashfulness, and sometimes to his fear of offending
his uncle.  An occurrence, however, which happened soon after, put it
beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of our family; my wife
even regarded it as an absolute promise.</p>
<p>My wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbor
Flamborough's, found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by
a limner, who travelled

<pb n="113"/> the country and took likenesses for fifteen shillings a
head.  As this family and ours had long a sort      of
rivalry in point of taste, our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march
upon us, and notwithstanding all

<pb n="114"/> I could say, and I said much, it was resolved that we
should have our pictures done too.  Having, therefore, engaged the
limner-for what could I do?-our next deliberation was to show the
superiority of our taste in the attitudes.  As for our neighbor's family,
there were seven of them, and they were drawn with seven oranges-a
thing quite out of taste, no variety in life, no composition in the world.
We desired to have something in a brighter style, and, after many
debates, at length came to a unanimous resolution of being drawn
together in one large historical family piece.  This would be cheaper,
since one frame would serve for all, and it would be infinitely more
genteel; for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same
manner.  As we did not immediately recollect a historical subject to hit
us, we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical
figures.  My wife desired to be represented as Venus, and the painter
was desired not to be too frugal of his diamonds in her stomacher and
hair.  Her two little ones were to be as Cupids by her side, while I, in
my gown and band, was to present her with my books on the Whistonian
controversy.  Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon, sitting upon a
bank of flowers, dressed in a green Joseph, richly laced with gold, and a
whip in her hand.  Sophia was to be a shepherdess, with as many sheep
as the painter could put in for nothing; and Moses was to be dressed out
with a hat and white feather, Our taste

<pb n="115"/> so much pleased the 'Squire that he insisted on being
put in as one of the family in the character of Alexander the Great at
Olivia's feet.  This was considered by us all as an indication of his
desire to be introduced into the family, nor could we refuse his request.
The painter was therefore set to work, and, as he wrought with assiduity
and expedition, in less than four days the whole was completed.  The
piece was large, and it must be owned he did not spare his colors; for
which my wife gave him great encomiums.  We were all perfectly
satisfied with his performance; but an unfortunate circumstance had not
occurred till the picture was finished, which now struck us with dismay.
It was so very large that we had no place in the house to fix it! How we
all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable; but certain it
is, we had been all greatly remiss.  The picture, therefore, instead of
gratifying our vanity, as we hoped, leaned in a most mortifying manner
against the kitchen wall, where the canvas was stretched and painted,
much too large to be got through any of the doors, and the jest of all our
neighbors.  One compared it to Robinson Crusoe's long-boat, too large
to be removed; another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle;
some wondered how it could be got out, but still more were amazed how
it ever got in.</p>
<p>But though it excited the ridicule of some, it effectually raised
more malicious suggestions in many, The 'Squire's portrait being found
united with ours, was an

<pb n="116"/> honor too great to escape envy.  Scandalous whispers
began to circulate at our expense, and our tranquillity was continually
disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us
by enemies.  These reports we always resented with becoming spirit; but
scandal ever improves by opposition.</p>
<p>We once again, therefore, entered into a consultation upon
obviating the malice of our enemies, and at last came to a resolution
which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction.It was this: as
our principal object was to discover the honor of Mr. Thornhill's
addresses, my wife undertook to sound him, by pretending to ask his
advice in the choice of a husband for her eldest daughter.  If this was not
found sufficient to induce him to a declaration, it was then resolved to
terrify him with a rival.  To this last step, however, I would by no
means give my consent, till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances
that she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this
occasion, if he did not prevent it by taking her himself.  Such was the
scheme laid, which, though I did not strenuously oppose, I did not
entirely approve.</p>
<p>The next time, therefore that Mr. Thornhill came to see us, my
girls took care to be out of the way, in order to give their mamma an
opportunity of putting her scheme in execution; but they only retired to
the next room, whence they could overhear the whole conversation.
My wife artfully introduced it, by observing

<pb n="117"/> that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a
good match of it in Mr. Spanker.  To this the 'Squire assenting, she
proceeded to remark that they who had warm fortunes were always sure
of getting good husbands.  "But Heaven help," continued she, "the
girls that have none! What signifies beauty, Mr. Thornhill? or what
signifies all the virtue, and all the qualifications in the world, in this
age of self-interest? It is not, what is she? but what has she? is all the
cry."</p>
<p>"Madam," returned he, "I highly approve the justice, as well as
the novelty of your remarks, and if I were a king it should be otherwise.
It should then indeed, be fine times with the girls without fortunes: our
two young ladies should be the first for whom I would provide."</p>
<p>"Ah, sir," returned my wife, "you are pleased to be facetious; but
I wish I were a queen, and then I know where my eldest daughter should
look for a husband.  But now, that you have put it into my head,
seriously, Mr. Thornhill, can't you recommend me a proper husband
for her? She is now nineteen years old, well grown and well educated,
and, in my humble opinion, does not want for parts."</p>
<p>"Madam," replied he, "if I were to choose, I would find out a
person possessed of every accomplishment that can make an angel
happy.  One with prudence, fortune, taste, and sincerity; such, madam,
would be, in my opinion, the proper husband."-"Ay, sir," said she,

<pb n="118"/> "but do you know of any such person?"-"No, madam,"
returned he, "it is impossible to know any person that deserves to be her
husband: she's too great a treasure for one man's possession: she's a
goddess.  Upon my soul, I speak what I think, she's an angel!""Ah,
Mr. Thornhill, you only flatter my poor girl; but we have been thinking
of marrying her to one of your tenants, whose mother is lately dead, and
who wants a manager; you know whom I mean, farmer Williams; a
warm man, Mr. Thornhill, able to give her good bread; and who has
several times made her proposals (which was actually the case) : but
sir," concluded she, "I should be glad to have your approbation of our
choice."-"How! madam," replied he, "my approbation! My approbation
of such a choice! Never! What! sacrifice so much beauty, and sense, and
goodness to a creature insensible of the blessing! Excuse me, I can never
approve of such a piece of injustice! And I have my reasons!"-"Indeed,
sir," cried Deborah, "if you have your reasons, that's another affair; but
I should be glad to know those reasons!"-"Excuse me, madam," returned
he, "they lie too deep for discovery" (laying his hand upon his bosom);
"they remain buried, riveted here."</p>
<p>After he was gone, upon general consultation, we could not tell
what to make of these fine sentiments.  Olivia considered them as
instances of the most exalted passion; but I was not quite so sanguine.  It
seemed to

<pb n="119"/> me pretty plain, that they had more of love than matri
mony in them; yet, whatever they might portend, it was resolved to
prosecute the scheme of Farmer Williams, who, from my daughter's
first appearance in the country, had paid her his addresses.</p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d22"><pb n="120"/>
<head>Scarcely Any Virtue Found to Resist the Power of Long and
Pleasing Temptation </head>
<p>As I only studied my child's real happiness, the assiduity of Mr.
Williams pleased me, as he was in easy circumstance, prudent, and
sincere.  It required but very little encouragement to revive his former
passion; so that in an evening or two he and Mr. Thornhill met at our
house and surveyed each other for some time with looks of anger; but
Williams owed his landlord no rent, and little regarded his indignation.
Olivia, on her side, acted the coquette to perfection, if that might be
called acting which was her real character, pretending to lavish all her
tenderness on her new lover.  Mr. Thornhill appeared quite dejected at
this preference, and with a pensive air took leave; though I own it
puzzled me to find him in so much pain as he appeared to be, when he
had it in his power so easily to remove the cause by declaring an honor
able passion.  But whatever uneasiness he seemed to endure, it could
easily be perceived that Olivia's anguish was still greater.  After any of
these interviews between

<pb n="121"/> her lovers, of which there were several, she usually
retired to solitude, and there indulged her grief.  It was in such a
situation I found her one evening, after she had been for some time
supporting a fictitious gayety.  "You now see, my child," said I, "that
your confidence in Mr. Thornhill's passion was all a dream; he permits
the rivalry of another, every way his inferior, though he knows it lies
in his power to secure you to himself by a candid declaration."-"Yes,
papa," returned she "but he has his 'reasons for  this delay: I know he
has.  The sincerity of his looks and words convinces me of his real
esteem.  A short time, I hope, will discover the generosity of his
sentiments, and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just
than yours."-"Olivia, my darling," returned I, "every scheme that has
been hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration, has been proposed
and planned by yourself; nor can you in the least say that I have con
strained you.  But you must not suppose, my dear, that I will ever be
instrumental in suffering his honest rival to be the dupe of your ill-placed
passion.  Whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an
explanation shall be granted; but at the expiration of that term, if he is
still regardless, I must absolutely insist that honest Mr. Williams shall be
rewarded for his fidelity.  The character which I have hitherto sup
ported in life demands this from me, and my tenderness as a parent shall
never influence my integrity as a man.

<pb n="122"/> Name, then, your day; let it be as distant as you think
proper, and in the meantime take care to let Mr. Thornhill know the
exact time on which I design delivering you up to another.  If he really
loves you, his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one
method alone to prevent his losing you forever." This proposal, which
she could not avoid considering as perfectly just, was readily agreed to.
She again renewed her most positive promise of marrying Mr.
Williams in case of the other's insensibility; and at the next opportunity,
in Mr. Thornhill's presence, that day month was fixed upon for her
nuptials with his rival.</p>
<p>Such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble Mr. Thornhill's
anxiety; but what Olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness.  In this
struggle between prudence and passion, her vivacity quite forsook her,
and every opportunity of solitude was sought, and spent in tears.  One
week passed away; but Mr. Thornhill made no efforts to restrain her
nuptials.  The succeeding week he was still assiduous; but not more
open.  On the third he discontinued his visits entirely; and instead of my
daughter testifying any impatience, as I expected, she seemed to retain a
pensive tranquillity, which I looked upon as resignation.  For my own
part, I was now sincerely pleased with thinking that my child was going
to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace, and frequently
applauded her resolution, in preferring happiness to ostentation.</p>

<pb n="123"/>
<p>It was within about four days of her intended nuptials, that my
little family at night were gathered round a charming fire, telling stories
of the past, and laying schemes for the future.  Busied in forming a
thousand projects, and laughing at whatever folly came uppermost,
"Well, Moses," cried I, "we shall soon, my boy, have a wedding in the
family; what is your opinion of matters and things in general?"-"My
opinion, father, is that all things go on very well; and I was just now
thinking, that when sister Livy is married to Farmer Williams, we shall
then have the loan of his cider-press and brewing tubs for nothing."
"That we shall, Moses," cried I, "and he will sing us 'Death and the
Lady' to raise our spirits, into the bargain."-"He has taught that song to
our Dick," cried Moses; "and I think he goes through it very
prettily."-"Does he so?" cried I; "then let us have it: where is little
Dick? let him up with it boldly."-"My brother Dick," cried Bill, my
youngest, "is just gone out with sister Livy; but Mr. Williams has taught
me two songs, and I'll sing them for you, papa.  Which song do you
choose, 'The Dying Swan' or 'The Elegy on the Death of a Mad
Dog'?"-"The elegy, child, by all means," said I; "I never heard that yet;
and Deborah, my life, grief you know is dry, let us have a bottle of the
best gooseberry-wine, to keep up our spirits.  I have wept so much at all
sorts of elegies of late, that without an enlivening glass I am sure this
will

<pb n="124"/> overcome me: and Sophy, love, take your guitar, and
trum in with the boy a little." </p>

<p>"A very good boy, Bill, upon my word; and an elegy that may

may he one day be a bishop!"</p>
<p>"With all my heart," cried my wife; "and if he but preaches as
well as he sings, I make no doubt of him.  The most of his family, by
the mother's side, could sing a good song; it was a common saying in
our country that the family of the Blenkinsops could never

<pb n="126"/> look straight before them, nor the Hugginsons blow out
a candle; that there were none of the Grograms but could sing a song, or
of the Marjorams but could tell a story."-"However that be," cried I,
"the most vulgar ballad of them all generally pleases me better than the
fine modern odes, and things that petrify us in a single stanza;
productions that we at once detest and praise.  Put the glass to your
brother, Moses.  The great fault of these elegiasts is, that they are in
despair for griefs that give the sensible part of mankind very little pain.
A lady loses her muff, her fan, her lapdog, and so the silly poet runs
home to versify the disaster."</p>
<p>"That may be the mode," cried Moses, "in sublimer compositions;
but the Ranelagh songs that come down to us are perfectly familiar, and
all cast in the same mould: Colin meets Dolly, and they hold a dialogue
together; he gives her a fairing to put in her hair, and she presents him
with a nosegay; and then they go together to church, where they give
good advice to young nymphs and swains to get married as fast as they
can."</p>
<p>"And very good advice, too," cried I; "and I am told there is not a
place in the world where advice can be given with so much propriety as
there; for, as it persuades us to marry, it also furnishes us with a wife;
and surely that must be an excellent market, my boy, where we are told
what we want, and supplied with it when wanting." "Yes, sir," returned
Moses, "and I know but of

<pb n="127"/> two such markets for wives in Europe Ranelagh in
England, and Fontarabia in Spain.  The Spanish market is open once a
year, but our English wives are salable every night."</p>
<p>"You are right, my boy," cried his mother.  "Old England is the
only place in the world for husbands to get wives."-"And for wives to
manage their husbands," interrupted I. "It is a proverb abroad, that if a
bridge were built across the sea, all the ladies of the Continent would
come over and take pattern from ours; for there are no such wives in
Europe as our own.  But let us have one bottle more, Deborah, my life,
and Moses, give us a good song.  What thanks do we not owe to Heaven
for thus bestowing tranquillity, health, and competence.  I think myself
happier now than the greatest monarch upon earth.  He has no such
fireside, nor such pleasant faces about it.  Yes, Debborah, we are now
growing old; but the evening of our life is likely to be happy.  We are
descended from ancestors that knew no stain, and we shall leave a good
and virtuous race of children behind us.  While we live they will be our
support and our pleasure here, and when we die they will transmit our
honor untainted to posterity.  Come, my son, we wait for a song; let us
have a chorus.  But where is my darling Olivia? That little cherub's
voice is always sweetest in the concert."</p>
<p>Just as I spoke Dick came running in: "O papa,

<pb n="128"/> papa, she is gone from us, she is gone from us! my
sister Livy is gone from us for ever!"-"Gone, child!" -"Yes, she is gone
off with two gentlemen in a postchaise, and one of them kissed her,
and said he would die for her; and she cried very much, and was for
coming back; but he persuaded her again, and she went into the chaise,
and said: 'O what will my poor papa do when he knows I am undone!'
"-"Now, then," cried I, "my children, go and be miserable; for we shall
never enjoy one hour more.  And 0 may Heaven's everlasting fury light
upon him and his! Thus to rob me of my child! And sure it will, for
taking back my sweet innocent that I was leading up to Heaven.  Such
sincerity as my child was possessed of! But all our earthly happiness is
now over! Go, my children, go and be miserable and infamous; for my
heart is broken within me!"-"Father," cried my son, "is this your
fortitude?"-"Fortitude, child! Yes, he shall see I have fortitude! Bring me
my pistols.  I'll pursue the traitor.  While he is on earth, I'll pursue him.
Old as I am, he shall find I can sting him yet.  The villain! the
perfidious villain!" I had by this time reached down my pistols, when my
poor wife, whose passions were not so strong as mine, caught me in her
arms.  "My dearest, dearest husband," cried she, "the Bible is the only
weapon that is fit for your old hands now.  Open that, my love, and read
our anguish into patience, for she has vilely deceived us."-"Indeed, sir,"
resumed

<pb n="129"/> my son, after a pause, "your rage is too violent and
unbecoming.  You should be my mother's comforter; and you increase
her pain.  It ill-suited you and your reverend character, thus to curse
your greatest enemy; you should not have cursed him, villain as he
is."-"I did not curse him, child, did I?"-"Indeed, sir, you did; you cursed
him twice."-"Then may Heaven forgive me and him if I did.  And
now, my son, I see it was more than human benevolence that first taught
us to bless our enemies, Blessed be His holy name for all the good He
hath given, and for all that He hath taken away.  But it is not, it is not a
small distress that can wring tears from these old eyes, that have not
wept for so many years.  My child! To undo my darling!-May confusion
seize Heaven forgive me, what I am about to say! You may remember,
my love, how good she was, and how charming; till this vile moment all
her care was to make us happy.  Had she but died! But she is gone, the
honor of our family contaminated, and I must look out for happiness in
other worlds than here. -But, my child, you saw them go off; perhaps he
forced her away? If he forced her, she may yet be innocent."-"Ah, no,
sir," cried the child; "he only kissed her and called her his angel; and
she wept very much, and leaned upon his arm, and they drove off very
fast."-"She's an ungrateful creature," cried my wife, who could scarcely
speak for weeping, "to use us thus; she never had the least constraint put
upon her affections.

<pb n="130"/> The vile strumpet has basely deserted her parents
without any provocation, thus to bring your gray hairs to the grave, and
I must shortly follow."</p>
<p>In this manner that night, the first of our real misfortunes, was
spent in the bitterness of complaint, and ill-supported sallies of
enthusiasm.  I determined, however, to find out her betrayer, wherever
he was, and reproach his baseness.  The next morning we missed our
wretched child at breakfast, where she used to give life and cheerfulness
to us all.  My wife, as before attempted to ease her heart by
reproaches.  "Never," cried she, "shall that vilest stain of our family
again darken these harmless doors.  I will never call her daughter more.
No, let the strumpet live with her vile seducer; she may bring us to
shame, but she shall never more deceive us."</p>
<p>"Wife," said I, "do not talk thus hardly; my detestation of her
guilt is as great as yours; but ever shall this house and this heart be open
to a poor returning repentant sinner.  The sooner she returns from her
transgression, the more welcome shall she be to me.  For the first time
the very best may err; art may persuade, and novelty spread out its
charm.  The first fault is the child of simplicity; but every other the
offspring of guilt.  Yes, the wretched creature shall be welcome to this
heart and this house, though stained with ten thousand vices.  I will
again hearken to the music of her voice, again will I hang fondly on her
bosom, if I

<pb n="131"/> find but repentance there.  My son, bring hither my
Bible and my staff; I will pursue her wherever she is; and though I
cannot save her from shame, I may prevent the continuance of
iniquity."</p>

<head>The Pursuit of a Father to Reclaim a Lost Child to Virtue.
</head>
<p>THOUGH the child could not describe the gentleman's person who
handed his sister into the post-chaise, yet my suspicions fell entirely
upon our young landlord, whose character for such intrigues was but too
well known.  I therefore directed my steps towards Thornhill Castle,
resolving to upbraid him, and, if possible, to bring back my daughter;
but before I had reached his seat, I was met by one of my parishioners,
who said he saw a young lady resembling my daughter in a postchaise
with a gentleman, whom, by the description, I could only guess to be
Mr. Burchell, and that they drove very fast.  This information, however,
did by no means satisfy me.  I therefore went to the young 'Squire's,
and though it was yet early, insisted upon seeing him immediately; he
soon appeared with the most open, familiar air, and seemed perfectly
amazed at my daughter's elopement, protesting upon his honor that he
was quite a stranger to it.  I now therefore condemned

<pb n="133"/> my former suspicions, and could turn them only on Mr.
Burchell, who I recollected had of late several private conferences with
her; but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt his
villainy, who averred that he and my daughter had actually gone towards
the Wells, about thirty miles off, where there was a great deal of
company.</p>
<p>Being driven to that state of mind in which we are more ready to
act precipitately than to reason right, I never debated with myself
whether these accounts might not have been given by persons purposely
placed in my way to mislead me, but resolved to pursue my daughter
and her fancied deluder thither.  I walked along with earnestness, and
inquired of several by the way; but received no accounts, till entering the
town, I was met by a person on horseback, whom I remembered to
have seen at the 'Squire's, and he assured me that if I followed them to
the races, which were but thirty miles farther, I might depend upon
overtaking them; for he had seen them dance there the night before,
and the whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughter's
performance.  Early the next day I walked forward to the races, and
about four in the afternoon I came upon the course.  The company made
a very brilliant appearance, all earnestly employed in one pursuit, that of
pleasure; how different from mine, that of reclaiming a lost child to
virtue! I thought I perceived Mr. Burchell at some distance from me;
but, as

<pb n="134"/> if he dreaded an interview, upon my approaching him
he mixed among a crowd, and I saw him no more.</p>
<p>I now reflected that it would be to no purpose to continue my
pursuit farther, and resolved to return home to an innocent family, who
wanted my assistance.  But the agitations of my mind, and the fatigues I
had undergone, threw me into a fever, the symptoms of which I
perceived before I came off the course.  This was another unexpected
stroke, as I was more than seventy miles distant from home: however, I
retired to a little ale-house by the roadside, and in this place, the usual
retreat of indigence and frugality, I laid me down patiently to wait the
issue of my disorder.  I languished here for nearly three weeks; but at
last my constitution prevailed, though I was unprovided with money to
defray the expenses of my entertainment.  It is possible the anxiety from
this last circumstance alone might have brought on a relapse, had I not
been supplied by a traveller, who stopped to take a cursory refreshment.
This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St. Paul's
Churchyard, who has written so many little books for children: he called
himself their friend; but he was the friend of all mankind.  He was no
sooner alighted, but he was in haste to be gone; for he was ever on
business of the utmost importance, and was at that time actually
compiling materials for the history of one Mr. Thomas Trip.  I
immediately recollected this good-natured man's red

<pb n="135"/> pimpled face; for he had published for me against the
Deuterogamists of the age, and from him I borrowed a few pieces, to be
paid at my return.  Leaving the inn, therefore, as I was yet but weak, I
resolved to return home by easy journeys of ten miles a day.</p>
<p>My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored, and I now
condemned that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of
correction.  Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to
bear till he tries them; as in ascending the heights of ambition which
look bright from below, every step we rise shows us some new and
gloomy prospect of hidden disappointment; so in our descent from the
summits of pleasure, though the vale of misery below may appear at first
dark and gloomy, yet the busy mind, still attentive to its own
amusement, finds as we descend something to flatter and to please.
Still as we approach, the darkest objects appear to brighten, and the
mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation.</p>
<p>I now proceeded forward, and had walked about two hours, when I
perceived what appeared at a distance like a wagon, which I was
resolved to overtake; but when I came up with it found it to be a
strolling company's cart, that was carrying their scenes and other
theatrical furniture to the next village, where they were to exhibit.</p>
<p>The cart was attended only by the person who drove it and one of
the company, as the rest of the players

<pb n="136"/> were to follow the ensuing day.  "Good company upon
the road," says the proverb, "is the shortest cut;" I therefore entered into
conversation with the poor player; and as I once had some theatrical
powers myself, I disserted on such topics with my usual freedom; but
as I was pretty much unacquainted with the present state of the stage, I
demanded who were the present theatrical writers in vogue, who the
Drydens and Otways of the day.  "I fancy, sir," cried the player, "few
of our modern dramatists would think themselves much honored by being
compared to the writers you mention.  Dryden's and Rowe's manner,
sir, are quite out of fashion: our taste has gone back a whole century;
Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and all the plays of Shakespeare are the only
things that go down."-"How!" cried I, "is it possible that the present age
can be pleased with that antiquated dialect, that obsolete humor, those
overcharged characters which abound in the works you
mention?"-"Sir," returned my companion, "the public think nothing
about dialect, or humor, or character, for that is none of their business;
they only go to be amused, and find themselves happy when they can
enjoy a pantomime under  the sanction of Jonson's or Shakespeare's
name.""So then, I suppose," cried I, "that our modern  dramatists are
rather imitators of Shakespeare than of nature?"-"To say the truth,"
returned my companion, "I don't know that they imitate any thing at
all; nor indeed does the public require

<pb n="137"/> it of them: it is not the composition of the piece, but the
number of starts and attitudes that may be introduced into it, that elicits
applause.  I have known a piece, with not one jest in the whole,
shrugged into popularity, and another saved by the poet's throwing in a
fit of the gripes.  No, sir, the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too
much wit in them for the present taste; our modern dialect is much more
natural."</p>
<p>By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at
the village, which, it seems, had been apprized of our approach, and was
come out to gaze at us; for my companion observed, that strollers have
more spectators without doors than within.  I did not consider the
impropriety of my being in such company till I saw a mob gather about
me.  I therefore took shelter, as fast as possible, in the first ale-house
that offered; and being shown into the common room, was accosted by a
very well-dressed gentleman, who demanded whether I was the real
chaplain of the company, or whether it was only to be my masquerade
character in the play.  Upon my informing him of the truth, and that I
did not belong in any sort to the company, he was condescending enough
to desire me and the player to partake in a bowl of punch, over which he
discussed modern politics with great earnestness and interest.  I set him
down in my own mind for nothing less than a parliament-man at least:
but was almost confirmed in my conjectures, when upon

<pb n="138"/>   asking what there was in the house for supper, he in
sisted that the player and I should sup with him at his house; with which
request, after some entreaties, we were prevailed upon to comply.</p>

<head> The Description of a Person Discontented with the Present

<p>THE house where we were to be entertained lying at a small
distance from the village, our inviter observed that as the coach was not
ready, he would conduct us on foot, and we soon arrived at one of the
most magnificent mansions I had seen in that part of the country.  The
apartment into which we were shown was perfectly elegant and
modern; he went to give orders for supper, while the player, with a
wink, observed that we were perfectly in luck.  Our entertainer soon re
turned, an elegant supper was brought in, two or three ladies in easy
dishabille were introduced, and the conversation began with some
sprightliness.  Politics, however, were the subject on which our
entertainer chiefly expatiated; for he asserted that liberty was at once his
boast and his terror.  After the cloth was removed, he asked me if I had
seen the last Monitor, to which replying in the negative, "What! nor the
Auditor, I suppose?" cried he.-"Neither, sir," returned I."That's
strange, very strange," replied my entertainer.

Whitehall Evening, the seventeen magazines, and the two reviews; and
though they hate each other, I love them all.  Liberty, sir, liberty is the
Briton's boast, and by all my coal-mines in Cornwall, I reverence its
guardians."-"Then it is to be hoped," cried I, "you reverence the
king."-"Yes," returned my entertainer, "when he does what we would
have him; but if he goes on, as he has done of late, I'll never trouble
myself more with his matters.  I say nothing.  I think only.  I could have
directed some things better.  I don't think there has been a sufficient
number of advisers: he should advise with every person willing to give
him advice, and then we should have things done in another guess
manner."</p>
<p>"I wish," cried I, "that such intruding advisers were fixed in the
pillory.  It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of
our constitution, that sacred power that has for some years been every
day declining, and losing its due share of influence in the state.  But
these ignorants still continue the same cry of liberty, and if they had any
weight, basely throw it into the subsiding scale."</p>
<p>"How," cried one of the ladies, "do I live to see one so base, so
sordid, as to be an enemy to liberty, and a defender of tyrants? Liberty,
that sacred gift of Heaven, that glorious privilege of Britons!"</p>

<pb n="141"/>
<p>"Can it be possible," cried our entertainer, "that there should be
any found at present advocates for slavery? Any who are for meanly
giving up the privileges of Britons? Can any, sir, be so abject?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," replied I, "I am for liberty, that attribute of God!
Glorious liberty! that theme of modern declamation.  I would have all
men kings.  I would be a king myself.  We have all naturally an equal
right to the throne; we are all originally equal.  This is my opinion, and
was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called Levellers.
They tried to erect themselves into a community, where all should be
equally free.  But, alas! it would never answer; for there were some
among them stronger, and some more cunning than others, and these
became masters of the rest; for as sure as your groom rides your horses,
because he is a cunninger animal than they, so surely will the animal
that is cunninger or stronger than he, sit upon his shoulders in turn.
Since, then, it is entailed upon humanity to submit, and some are born to
command and others to obey, the question is, as there must be tyrants,
whether it is better to have them in the same house with us, or in the
same village, or still farther off, in the metropolis.  Now, sir, for my
own part, as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant, the farther off he is
removed from me, the better pleased am I. The generality of mankind
are also of my way of thinking, and have unanimously created one king,
whose election

<pb n="142"/> at once diminishes the number of tyrants, and puts
tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people.
Now, the great who were tyrants themselves before the election of one
tyrant, are naturally averse to a power raised over them, and whose
weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate orders.  It is the
interest of the great, therefore, to diminish kingly power as much as
possible; because whatever they take from that is naturally restored to
themselves; and all they have to do in the state is to undermine the single
tyrant, by which they resume their primeval authority.  Now the state
may be so circumstanced, or its laws may be so disposed, or its men of
opulence so minded, as all to conspire in carrying on this business of
undermining monarchy.  For, in the first place, if the circumstances of
our state be such as to favor the accumulation of wealth, and make the
opulent still more rich, this will increase their ambition.  An
accumulation of wealth, however, must necessarily be the consequence
when, as at present, more riches flow in from external commerce than
arise from internal industry; for external commerce can only be managed
to advantage by the rich, and they have also at the same time all the
emoluments arising from internal industry; so that the rich, with us, have
two sources of wealth, whereas the poor have but one.  For this reason,
wealth in all commercial states is

<pb n="143"/> found to accumulate, and all such have hitherto in time
become aristocratical.</p>
<p>"Again, the very laws also of this country may contribute to the
accumulation of wealth, as when by their means the natural ties that bind
the rich and poor together are broken, and it is ordained that the rich
shall only marry with the rich; or when the learned are held unqualified
to serve their country as counsellors merely from a defect of opulence,
and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man's ambition; by these
means, I say, and such means as these, riches will accumulate.  Now the
possessor of accumulated wealth, when furnished with the necessaries
and pleasures of life, has no other method to employ the superfluity of
his fortune but in purchasing power.  That is, differently speaking, in
making dependents, by purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal,
of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous tyranny
for bread.  Thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a
circle of the poorest of the people: and the polity, abounding in accumu
lated wealth, may be compared to a Cartesian system, each orb with a
vortex of its own.  Those, however, who are willing to move in a great
man's vortex are only such as must be slaves-the rabble of mankind,
whose souls and whose education are adapted to servitude, and who
know nothing of liberty except the name.</p>
<p>"But there must still be a large number of people

<pb n="144"/> without the sphere of the opulent man's influence;
namely, that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the
very rabble; those men who are possessed of too large fortunes to submit
to the neighboring man in power, and yet are too poor to set up for
tyranny themselves.  In this middle order of mankind are generally to
be found all the arts, wisdom, and virtues of society.  This order alone is
known to be the true preserver of freedom, and may be called THE
PEOPLE. Now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may
lose all its influence in a state and its voice be in a manner drowned in
that of the rabble; for if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a person at
present to give his voice in state affairs, be ten times less than was
judged sufficient upon forming the constitution, it is evident that great
numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system,
and they ever moving in the vortex of the great, will follow where
greatness shall direct.  In such a state, therefore, all that the middle
order has left, is to preserve the prerogative and privileges of the one
principal governor with the most sacred circumspection.  For he
divides the power of the rich, and calls off the great from falling with
tenfold weight on the middle order placed beneath them.  The middle
order may be compared to a town of which the opulent are forming the
siege, and to which the governor from without is hastening the relief.
While the besiegers are in dread

<pb n="145"/>   of an enemy over them, it is but natural to offer the
townsmen the most specious terms; to flatter them with sounds, and
amuse them with privileges; but if they once defeat the governor from
behind, the walls of the town will be but a small defence to its
inhabitants.  What they may then expect, may be seen by turning our
eyes to Holland, Genoa, or Venice, where the laws govern the poor, and
the rich govern the laws.  I am, then, for, and would die for, monarchy,
sacred monarchy; for if there be any thing sacred amongst men, it must
be the anointed sovereign of his people, and every diminution of his
power, in war or in peace, is an infringement upon the real liberties of
the subject.  The sounds of liberty, patriotism, and Britons, have already
done much; it is to be hoped that the true sons of freedom will prevent
their ever doing more.  I have known many of those pretended
champions for liberty in my time, yet I do not remember one that was
not in his heart and in his family a tyrant."</p>
<p>My warmth I found had lengthened this harangue beyond the rules
of good breeding; but the impatience of my entertainer, who often strove
to interrupt it, could be restrained no longer.  "What!" cried he, "then I
have been all this while entertaining a Jesuit in parson's clothes; but by
all the coal-mines of Cornwall, out he shall pack, if my name be
Wilkinson." I now found I had gone too far, and asked pardon for the
warmth with which I had spoken.  "Pardon!" returned

<pb n="146"/>  he in a fury; "I think such principles demand ten thou
sand pardons.  What, give up liberty, property, and, as the Gazetteer
says, lie down to be saddled with wooden shoes! Sir, I insist upon your
marching out of this house immediately, to prevent worse conse
quences.  Sir, I insist upon it." I was going to repeat my remonstrances,
but just then we heard a footman's rap at the door, and the two ladies
cried out: "As sure as death there is our master and mistress come
home." It seems my entertainer was all this while only the butler, who,
in his master's absence, had a mind to cut a figure, and be for a while
the gentleman himself; and, to say the truth, he talked politics as well as
most country-gentlemen do.  But nothing could now exceed my
confusion upon seeing the gentleman and his lady enter; nor was their
surprise at finding such company and good cheer less than ours.
"Gentlemen," cried the real master of the house to me and my
companion, "my wife and I are your most humble servants; but I pro
test this is so unexpected a favor that we almost sink under the
obligation." However unexpected our company might be to them,
theirs, I am sure was still more so to us, and I was struck dumb with the
apprehensions of my own absurdity, when whom should I next see enter
the room but my dear Miss Arabella Wilmot, who was formerly
designed to be married to my son George; but whose match was broken
off as already related.  As soon as she saw me, she flew to my arms

<pb n="147"/> with the utmost joy.  "My dear, sir," cried she, "to
what happy accident is it that we owe so unexpected a visit? I am sure
my uncle and aunt will be in raptures when they find they have the good
Doctor Primrose for their guest." Upon hearing my name, the old
gentleman and lady very politely stepped up, and welcomed me with
most cordial hospitality.  Nor could they forbear smiling upon being
informed of the nature of my present visit; but the unfortunate butler,
whom they at first seemed disposed to turn away, was at my intercession
forgiven.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold and his lady, to whom the house belonged, now
insisted upon having the pleasure of my stay for some days, and as their
niece, my charming pupil, whose mind in some measure had been
formed under my own instructions, joined in their entreaties, I complied.
That night I was shown to a magnificent chamber, and the next morning
early Miss Wilmot desired to walk with me in the garden, which was
decorated in the modern manner.  After some time spent in pointing out
the beauties of the place, she inquired with seeming unconcern when last
I had heard from my son George.  "Alas! madam," cried I, "he has now
been nearly three years absent, without ever writing to his friends or
me.  Where he is I know not: perhaps I shall never see him or happiness
more.  No, my dear madam, we shall never more see such pleasing
hours as were once spent by our fireside at Wakefield.

<pb n="148"/> My little family are now dispersing very fast, and
poverty has brought not only want but infamy upon us." The
good-natured girl let fall a tear at this account; but as I saw her
possessed of too much sensibility, I forbore a more minute detail of our
sufferings.  It was, however, some consolation to me to find that time
had made no alteration in her affections, and that she had rejected
several offers that had been made her since our leaving her part of the
country.  She led me round all the extensive improvements of the place,
pointing to the several walks and arbors, and at the same time catching
from every object a hint for some new question relative to my
son.</p>
<p>In this manner we spent the forenoon, till the bell summoned us to
dinner, where we found the manager of the strolling company that I
mentioned before, who was come to dispose of tickets for "The Fair
Penitent," which was to be acted that evening, the part of Horatio by a
young gentleman who had never appeared on any stage.  He seemed to
be very warm in -the praise of the new performer, and averred that he
never saw any who bid so fair for excellence.  Acting, he observed,
was not learned in a day; "but this gentleman." continued he, "seems
born to tread the stage.  His voice, his figure, and attitudes are all
admirable.  We caught him up accidentally in our journey down." This
account, in some measure, excited our curiosity, and, at the entreaty of
the ladies, I was prevailed upon to accompany

<pb n="149"/>   them to the playhouse, which was no other than a
barn.  As the company with which I went was incontestably the chief of
the place, we were received with the greatest respect, and placed in the
front seat of the theatre, where we sat for some time with no small
impatience to see Horatia make his appearance.  The new performer
advanced at last; and let parents think of my sensations by their own,
when I found it was my unfortunate son.  He was going to begin, when,
turning his eyes upon the audience, he perceived Miss Wilmot and me,
and stood at once speechless and immovable.</p>
<p>The actors behind the scene, who ascribed this pause to his natural
timidity, attempted to encourage him; but instead of going on, he burst
into a flood of tears, and retired off the stage.  I don't know what were
my feelings on this occasion, for they succeeded with too much rapidity
for description; but I was soon awakened from this disagreeable revery
by Miss Wilmot, who, pale and with a trembling voice, desired me to
conduct her back to her uncle's.  When we got home, Mr. Arnold, who
was as yet a stranger to our extraordinary behavior, being informed
that the new performer was my son, sent his coach and an invitation
for him; and as he persisted in his refusal to appear again upon the
stage, the players put another in his place, and we soon had him with us.
Mr. Arnold gave him the kindest reception, and I received him with my

<pb n="150"/> usual transport; for I could never counterfeit false
resentment.  Miss Wilmot's reception was mixed with seeming neglect,
and yet I could perceive she acted a studied part.  The tumult in her
mind seemed not yet abated; she said twenty giddy things that looked
like joy, and then laughed loud at her own want of meaning.  At
intervals she would take a sly peep at the glass, as if happy in the
consciousness of irresistible beauty, and often would ask questions
without giving any manner of attention to the answers.  </p>

<p>AFTER we had supped, Mrs. Arnold politely offered to send a
couple of her footmen for my son's baggage; which he at first seemed to
decline; but upon her pressing the request, he was obliged to inform
her, that a stick and a wallet were all the movable things upon this earth
that he could boast of.  "Why, ay, my son," cried I, "you left me but
poor, and poor I find you are come back; and yet I make no doubt you
have seen a great deal of the world."-"Yes, sir," replied my son; "but
travelling after fortune is not the way to secure her; and indeed, of late I
have desisted from the pursuit."-"I fancy, sir," cried Mrs. Arnold,
"that the account of your adventures would be amusing: the first part of
them I have often heard from my niece; but could the company prevail
for the rest, it would be an additional obligation."</p>
<p>"Madam," replied my son, "I promise you the pleasure you have
in hearing, will not be half so great as my vanity in repeating them; and
yet in the whole narrative

<pb n="152"/>   I can scarcely promise you one adventure, as my
account is rather of what I saw than what I did.  The first misfortune of
my life, which you all know, was great; but, though it distressed, it
could not sink me. No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I.
The less kind I found fortune at one time, the more I expected from her
another, and being now at the bottom of her wheel, every new revolution
might lift, but could not depress me.  I proceeded, therefore, toward
London in a fine morning, no way uneasy about to-morrow; but cheerful
as the birds that carolled by the road, and comforted myself with
reflecting that London was the mart where abilities of every kind were
sure of meeting distinction and reward.</p>
<p>"Upon my arrival in town, sir, my first care was to deliver your
letter of recommendation to our cousin, who was himself in little better
circumstances than I. My first scheme, you know, sir, was to be an
usher in an academy, and I asked his advice on the affair.  Our cousin
received the proposal with a true sardonic grin.  'Ay,' cried he, 'this is
indeed a very pretty career that has been chalked out for you.  I have
been an usher at a boarding-school myself; and may I die by an anodyne
necklace, but I had rather be an under-turnkey in Newgate.  I was up
early and late: I was browbeat by the master, hated for my ugly face
by the mistress, worried by the boys within, and never permitted to stir
out to meet civility abroad.  But are you

<pb n="153"/>  sure you are fit for a school? Let me examine you a
little.  Have you been bred apprentice to the business?' -'No.'-'Then you
won't do for a school.  Can you dress the boys' hair?'-'No.'-'Then you
won't do for a school.  Have you had the small-pox?'-'No.'-'Then you
won't do for a school.  Can you lie three in a bed?' -'No.'-'Then you
will never do for a school.  Have you got a good stomach?'-'Yes.'-'Then
you will by no means do for a school.  No, sir, if you are for a genteel,
easy profession, bind yourself seven years as an apprentice to turn a
cutler's wheel, but avoid a school by any means.  'Yet come,' continued
he, 'I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning; what do you think of
commencing author, like me? You have read in books, no doubt, of men
of genius starving at the trade.  At present I'll show you forty very dull
fellows about town that live by it in opulence;-all honest jogtrot men,
who go on smoothly and dully, and write history and politics, and are
praised; men, sir, who, had they been bred cobblers, would all their
lives have only mended shoes, but never made them.'</p>
<p>"Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the
character of an usher, I resolved to accept his proposal; and having the
highest respect for literature, hailed the antiqua mater of Grub Street
with reverence.  I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden
and Otway trod before me; I considered the goddess of this region as the
parent of

<pb n="154"/> excellence; and however an intercourse with the world
might give us good sense, the poverty she entailed I supposed to be the
true nurse of genius.  Big with these reflections, I sat down, and finding
that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side, I resolved to
write a book that should be wholly new.  I therefore dressed up three
paradoxes with some ingenuity.  They were false, indeed, but they were
new.  The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others, that
nothing was left for me to import, but some splendid things that, at a
distance, looked every bit as well.  Witness, you powers, what fancied
importance sat perched upon my quill while I was writing! The whole
learned world, I made no doubt, would rise to oppose my systems; but
then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world.  Like the
porcupine, I sat selfcollected, with a quill pointed against every
opposer."</p>
<p>"Well said, my boy," cried I; "and what subject did you treat
upon?  I hope you did not pass over the importance of monogamy.  But
I interrupt, go on: you published your paradoxes; well, and what did the
learned world say to your paradoxes?"</p>
<p>"Sir," replied my son, "the learned world said nothing to my
paradoxes; nothing at all, sir.  Every man of them was employed in
praising his friends and himself, or condemning his enemies, and
unfortunately, as I had neither, I suffered the cruellest mortification
neglect.</p>

<pb n="155"/>
<p>"As I was meditating one day in a coffee-house on the fate of my
paradoxes, a little man happening to enter the room, placed himself in
the box before me, and after some preliminary discourse, finding me to
be a scholar, drew out a bundle of proposals, begging me to subscribe to
a new edition he was going to give to the world of Propertius, with
notes.  This demand necessarily produced a reply that I had no money;
and that concession led him to inquire into the nature of my expectations.
Finding that my expectations were just as great as my purse, 'I see,'
cried he, 'you are unacquainted with the town; I'll teach you a part of it.
Look at these proposals; upon these very proposals I have subsisted very
comfortably for twelve years.  The moment a nobleman returns from his
travels, a Creolian arrives from Jamaica, or a dowager from a coun
try-seat, I strike for a subscription.  I first besiege their hearts with
flattery, and then pour in my proposals at the breach.  If they subscribe
readily the first time, I renew my request to beg a dedication fee.  If
they let me have that, I smite them once more for engraving their
coat-of-arms at the top.  Thus,' continued he, 'I live by vanity, and
laugh at it.  But, between ourselves, I am too well-known; I should be
glad to borrow your face a bit: a nobleman of distinction has just
returned from Italy; my face is familiar to his porter; but if you bring
this copy of verses, my life for it you succeed, and we divide the
spoil."</p>

<pb n="156"/>
<p>"Bless us, George," cried I, "and is this the employment of poets
now? Do men of their exalted talents thus stoop to beggary? Can they so
far disgrace their calling as to make a vile traffic of praise for
bread?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, sir," returned he, "a true poet can never be so base; for
wherever there is genius there is pride.  The creatures I now describe are
only beggars in rhyme.  The real poet, as he braves every hardship for
fame, so he is equally a coward to contempt; and none but those who are
unworthy protection condescend to solicit it.</p>
<p>"Having a mind too proud to stoop to such indignities, and yet a
fortune too humble to hazard a second attempt for fame, I was now
obliged to take a middle course, and write for bread.  But I was
unqualified for a profession where mere industry alone was to ensure
success.  I could not suppress my lurking passion for applause; but
usually consumed that time in efforts after excellence which takes up but
little room, when it should have been more advantageously employed in
the diffusive productions of fruitful mediocrity.  My little piece would
therefore come forth in the midst of periodical publications, unnoticed
and unknown.  The public were more importantly employed than to
observe the easy simplicity of my style, or the harmony of my periods.
Sheet after sheet was thrown off to oblivion.  My essays were buried
among the essays upon liberty, Eastern tales, and cures for the bite of a
mad dog;

<pb n="157"/> while Philautos, Philalethes, Philelutheros, and Philan
thropos, all wrote better, because they wrote faster, than I.</p>
<p>"Now, therefore, I began to associate with none but disappointed
authors like myself, who praised, deplored, and despised each other.
The satisfaction we found in every celebrated writer's attempt was in
versely as their merits.  I found that no genius in another could please
me.  My unfortunate paradoxes had entirely dried up that source of
comfort.  I could neither read nor write with satisfaction; for excellence
in any other was my aversion, and writing was my trade.</p>
<p>"In the midst of these gloomy reflections, as I was one day sitting
on a bench in St. James' Park, a young gentleman of distinction, who
had been my intimate acquaintance at the university, approached me.
We saluted each other with some hesitation; he almost ashamed of being
known to one who made so shabby an appearance, and I afraid of a
repulse.  But my suspicions soon vanished; for Ned Thornhill was at
the bottom a very good-natured fellow."</p>
<p>"What did you say, George?" interrupted I, "Thornhill, was not
that his name? It can certainly be no other than my landlord."-"Bless
me," cried Mrs. Arnold, "is Mr. Thornhill so near a neighbor of yours?
He has long been a friend in our family, and we expect a visit from him
shortly."</p>

<pb n="158"/>
<p>"My friend's first care," continued my son, "was to alter my
appearance by a fine suit of his own clothes, and then I was admitted to
his table, upon the footing of half friend, half underling.  My business
was to attend him at auctions, to put him in spirits when he sat for his
picture, to take the left hand in his chariot when not filled by another,
and to assist at tattering a kip, as the phrase was, when he had a mind
for a frolic.  Besides this, I had twenty other little employments in the
family.  I was to do many small things without bidding; to carry the
corkscrew; to stand godfather to all the butler's children; to sing when
I was bid; to be never out of humor; always to be humble, and, if I
could, to be very happy.</p>
<p>"In this honorable post, however, I was not without a rival.  A
captain of marines, who was formed for the place by nature, opposed me
in my patron's affections.  His mother had been laundress to a man of
quality, and thus he early acquired a taste for pimping and pedigree.  As
this gentleman made it a study of his life to be acquainted with lords,
though he was dismissed from several for his stupidity, yet he found
many of them who were as dull as himself, that permitted his
assiduities.  As flattery was his trade, he practiced it with the easiest
address imaginable; but it came awkward and stiff from me; and as
every day my patron's desire of flattery increased, so every hour being
better acquainted with his defects, I became

<pb n="159"/>


<pb n="160"/> more unwilling to give it.  Thus I was once more fairly
going to give up the field to the captain, when my friend found occasion
for my assistance.  This was nothing less than to fight a duel for him,
with a gentleman whose sister it was pretended he had used ill.  I
readily complied with his request; and though I see you are displeased
with my conduct, yet as it was a debt indispensably due to friendship, I
could not refuse.  I undertook the affair, disarmed my antagonist, and
soon after had the pleasure of finding that the lady was only a woman of
the town, and the fellow her bully and a sharper.  This piece of service
was repaid with the warmest professions of gratitude; but as my friend
was to leave town in a few days, he knew no other method of serving
me, but by recommending me to his uncle, Sir William Thornhill, and
another nobleman of great distinction, who enjoyed a post under the
government.  When he was gone, my first care was to carry his
recommendatory letter to his uncle, a man whose character for every
virtue was universal, yet just.  I was received by his servants with the
most hospitable smiles; for the looks of the domestics ever transmit their
master's benevolence.  Being shown into a grand apartment, where Sir
William soon came to me, I delivered my message and letter, which he
read, and after pausing some minutes,-'Pray, sir,' cried he, 'inform me
what you have done for my kinsman, to deserve this warm
recommendation! But I suppose,

<pb n="161"/> sir, I guess your merits, you have fought for him; and
so you would expect a reward from me for being the instrument of his
vices.  I wish, sincerely wish, that my present refusal may be some
punishment f or your guilt; but still more, that it may be some
inducement to your repentance.'-The severity of this rebuke I bore
patiently, because I knew it was just.  My whole expectations now,
therefore, lay in my letter to the great man.  As the doors of the nobility
are almost ever beset with beggars, all ready to thrust in some sly
petition, I found it no easy matter to gain admittance.  However, after
bribing the servants with half my worldly fortune, I was at last shown
into a spacious apartment, my letter being previously sent up for his
lordship's inspection.  During this anxious interval I had full time to look
round me.  Every thing was grand and of happy contrivance; the
paintings, the furniture, the gildings, petrified me with awe, and raised
my idea of the owner.  Ah, thought I to myself, how very great must the
possessor of all these things be, who carries in his head the business of
the state, and whose house displays half the wealth of a kingdom; sure
his genius must be unfathomable! During these awful reflections I heard
a step come heavily forward.  Ah, this is the great man himself! No, it
was only a chamber-maid.  Another foot was heard soon after.  This
must be he! No, it was only the great man's valet de chambre, At last
his lordship actually

<pb n="162"/> made his appearance.  'Are you,' cried he, 'the bearer
of this here letter?' I answered with a bow.  'I learn by this,' continued
he, 'as how that'-But just at that instant a servant delivered him a card,
and without taking further notice, he went out of the room, and left me
to digest my own happiness at leisure.  I saw no more of him, till told
by a footman that his lordship was going to his coach at the door.  Down
I immediately followed, and joined my voice to that of three or four
more, who came, like me, to petition for favors.  His lordship, however,
went too fast for us, and was gaining his chariot door with large strides,
when I hallooed out to know if I was to have any reply.  He was by this
time got in, and muttered an answer, half of which only I heard, the
other half was lost in the rattling of his chariot wheels.  I stood for some
time with my neck stretched out, in the posture of one that was listening
to catch the glorious sounds, till, looking round me, I found myself alone
at his lordship's gate.</p>
<p>"My patience," continued my son, "was now quite exhausted;
stung with the thousand indignities I had met with, I was willing to cast
myself away, and only wanted the gulf to receive me.  I regarded myself
as one of those vile things that nature designed should be thrown by into
her lumber-room, there to perish in obscurity.  I had still, however, half
a guinea left, and of that I thought Fortune herself should not

<pb n="163"/> deprive me; but in order to be sure of this, I was
resolved to go instantly and spend it while I had it, and then trust to
occurrence for the rest.  As I was going with this resolution, it happened
that Mr. Crispe's office seemed invitingly open to give me a welcome
reception.  In this office Mr. Crispe kindly offers all his Majesty's
subjects a generous promise of thirty pounds a year; for which promise
all they give in return is their liberty for life, and permission to let him
transport them to America as slaves.  I was happy at finding a place
where I could lose my fears in desperation, and entered this cell, for it
had the appearance of one, with the devotion of a monastic.  Here I
found a number of poor creatures, all in circumstances like myself,
expecting the arrival of Mr. Crispe, presenting a true epitome of English
impatience.  Each untractable soul, at variance with Fortune, wreaked
her injuries on their own hearts; but Mr. Crispe at last came down, and
all our murmurs were hushed.  He deigned to regard me with an air of
peculiar approbation, and indeed he was the first man who for a month
past had talked to me with smiles.  After a few questions, he found I
was fit for every thing in the world.  He paused a while upon the
properest means of providing for me, and slapping his forehead as if he
had found it, assured me that there was at that time an embassy talked of
from the synod of Pennsylvania to the Chickasaw Indians, and that he
would use his interest to get me

<pb n="164"/> made secretary.  I knew in my own heart that the
fellow lied, and yet his promise gave me pleasure; there was something
so magnificent in the sound.  I fairly, therefore, divided my half guinea,
one-half of which went to be added to his thirty thousand pound, and
with the other half I resolved to go to the next tavern to be there more
happy than he.</p>
<p>"As I was going out with that resolution, I was met at the door by
the captain of a ship, with whom I had formerly some little acquaintance,
and he agreed to be my companion over a bowl of punch.  As I never
chose to make a secret of my circumstances, he assured me that I was
upon the very point of ruin in listening to the office-keeper's promises;
for that he only designed to sell me to the plantations.  'But,' continued
he, 'I fancy you might, by a much shorter voyage, be very easily put
into a genteel way of bread.  Take my advice.  My ship sails to-morrow
for Amsterdam; what if you go in her as a passenger? The moment you
land, all you have to do is to teach the Dutchmen English, and I'll
warrant you'll get pupils and money enough.  I suppose you understand
English,' added he, 'by this time, or the deuce is in it.' I confidently
assured him of that but expressed a doubt whether the Dutch would be
willing to learn English.  He affirmed, with an oath, that they were fond
of it to distraction; and upon that affirmation I agreed with his proposal,
and embarked the next day to teach the Dutch English in Holland.

<pb n="165"/>  The wind was fair, our voyage short, and after having
paid my passage with half my movables, I found myself, as fallen from
the skies, a stranger in one of the principal streets of Amsterdam.  In
this situation I was unwilling to let any time pass unemployed in
teaching.  I addressed myself, therefore, to two or three of those I met,
whose appearance seemed most promising; but it was impossible to make
ourselves mutually understood.  It was not till this very moment I
recollected that, in order to teach the Dutchmen English, it was
necessary that they should first teach me Dutch.  How I came to
overlook so obvious an objection is to me amazing; but certain it is I
overlooked it.</p>
<p>"This scheme thus blown up, I had some thoughts of fairly
shipping back to England again; but falling into company with an Irish
student who was returning from Louvain, our conversation turning upon
topics of literature (for, by the way, it may be observed that I always
forgot the meanness of my circumstances when I could converse upon
such subjects), from him I learned that there were not two men in his
whole university who understood Greek.  This amazed me.  I instantly
resolved to travel to Louvain, and there live by teaching Greek; and in
this design I was heartened by my brother student, who threw out some
hints that a fortune might be got by it.</p>
<p>"I set boldly forward the next morning.  Every day lessened the
burden of my movables, like AEsop and his

<pb n="166"/> basket of bread; for I paid them for my lodgings to the
Dutch as I travelled on.  When I came to Louvain, I was resolved not to
go sneaking to the lower professors; but openly tendered my talents to
the principal himself.  I went, had admittance, and offered him my
service as a master of the Greek language, which I had been told was a
desideratum in this university.  The principal seemed at first to doubt my
abilities; but of these I offered to convince him, by turning a part of any
Greek author he should fix upon into Latin.  Finding me perfectly
earnest in my proposals, he addressed me thus: 'You see me, young
man,' continued he, 'I never learned Greek, and I don't find that I have
ever missed it.  I have had a doctor's cap and gown without Greek! I
have ten thousand florins a year without Greek; I eat heartily without
Greek; and, in short,' continued he, 'as I don't know Greek, I do not
believe there is any good in it.'</p>
<p>"I was now too far from home to think of returning; so I resolved
to go forward.  I had some knowledge of music, with a tolerable voice,
and now turned what was once my amusement into a present means of
subsistence.  I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders, and
among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry; for I
ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants.  Whenever I
approached a peasant's house toward night-fall, I played one of my most
merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging.

<pb n="167"/>


<pb n="168"/> but subsistence for the next day.  I once or twice
attempted to play for people of fashion; but they always thought my
performance odious, and never rewarded me even with a trifle.  This
was to me the more extraordinary, as whenever I used in better days to
play for company, when playing was my amusement, my music never
failed to throw them into raptures, and the ladies especially; but as it was
now my only means, it was received with contempt; a proof how ready
the world is to underrate those talents by which a man is
supported.</p>
<p>"In this manner I proceeded to Paris, with no design but just to
look about me, and then to go forward.  The people of Paris are much
fender of strangers that have money than of those that have wit.  As I
could not boast much of either, I was no great favorite.  After walking
about the town four or five days, and seeing the outside of the best
houses, I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal hospitality, when
passing through one of the principal streets, whom should I meet but our
cousin to whom you first recommended me.  This meeting was very
agreeable to me, and I believe not displeasing to him.  He inquired into
the nature of my journey to Paris, and informed me of his own business
there, which was to collect pictures, medals, intaglios, and antiques of
all kinds, for a gentleman in London, who had just stepped into taste and
a large fortune.  I was the more surprised at seeing our cousin

<pb n="169"/> pitched upon for this office, as he himself had often
assured me he knew nothing of the matter.  Upon asking how he had
been taught the art of a cognoscento so very suddenly, he assured me
that nothing was more easy.  The whole secret consisted in a strict
adherence to two rules: the one, always to observe the picture might
have been better if the painter had taken more pains; and the other, to
praise the works of Pietro Perugino.  'But,' says he, 'as I once taught
you how to be an author in London, I'll now undertake to instruct you in
the art of picture-buying at Paris.'</p>
<p>"With this proposal I very readily closed, as it was living, and now
all my ambition was to live.  I went, therefore, to his lodgings,
improved my dress by his assistance, and after some time accompanied
him to auctions of pictures, where the English gentry were expected to
be purchasers.  I was not a little surprised at his intimacy with people of
the best fashion, who referred themselves to his judgment upon every
picture or medal, as to an unerring standard of taste.  He made very
good use of my assistance upon these occasions; for when asked his
opinion, he would gravely take me aside and ask mine, shrug, look wise,
return, and assure the company that he could give no opinion upon an
affair of so much importance.  Yet there was sometimes an occasion for
a more supported assurance.  I remember to have seen him, after
giving his opinion that the coloring of a picture was not mellow enough,
very

<pb n="170"/> deliberately take a brush with brown varnish, that was
accidentally lying by, and rub it over the piece with great composure
before all the company, and then ask if he had not improved the
tints.</p>
<p>"When he had finished his commission in Paris, he left me
strongly recommended to several men of distinction, as a person very
proper for a travelling tutor; and after some time I was employed in that
capacity by a gentleman who brought his ward to Paris, in order to set
him forward on his tour through Europe.  I was to be the young
gentleman's governor; but with a proviso, that he should always be
permitted to govern himself.  My pupil, in fact, understood the art of
guiding in money concerns much better than I. He was heir to a
fortune of about two hundred thousand pounds, left him by an uncle in
the West Indies, and his guardians, to qualify him for the management of
it, had bound him apprentice to an attorney.  Thus avarice was his
prevailing passion; all his questions on the road were how money might
be saved; which was the least expensive course of travel; whether any
thing could be bought that would turn to account when disposed of again
in London.  Such curiosities on the way as could be seen for nothing he
was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them was to be paid for
he usually asserted that he had been told they were not worth seeing.  He
never paid a bill that be would not observe how amazingly expensive
travelling was, and

<pb n="171"/> all this though he was not yet twenty-one.  When
arrived at Leghorn, as we took a walk to look at the port and shipping,
he inquired the expense of the passage by sea home to England.  This
he was informed was but a trifle compared to his returning by land; he
was therefore unable to withstand the temptation; so paying me the small
part of my salary that was due, he took leave, and embarked with only
one attendant for London.</p>
<p>"I now, therefore, was left once more upon the world at large; but
then it was a thing I was used to.  However, my skill in music could
avail me nothing in a country where every peasant was a better musi
cian than I; but by this time I had acquired another talent, which
answered my purpose as well, and this was a skill in disputation.  In all
the foreign universities and convents there are upon certain days philo
sophical theses maintained against every adventitious disputant; for
which, if the champion opposes with any dexterity, he can claim a
gratuity in money, a dinner, and a bed for one night.  In this manner,
therefore, I fought my way towards England, walking along from city
to city, examined mankind more nearly, and, if I may so express it, saw
both sides of the picture.  My remarks, however, are but few; I found
that monarchy was the best government for the poor to live in, and
commonwealths for the rich.  I found that riches in general were in
every country another name

<pb n="172"/>   for freedom; and that no man is so fond of liberty
himself, as not to be desirous of subjecting the will of some individuals
in society to his own.</p>
<p>"Upon my arrival in England I resolved to pay my respects first to
you, and then to enlist as a volunteer in the first expedition that was
going forward; but on my journey down my resolutions were changed by
meeting an old acquaintance, who, I found, belonged to a company of
comedians that were going to make a summer campaign in the country.
The company seemed not much to disapprove of me for an associate.
They all however apprized me of the importance of the task at which I
aimed; that the public was a many-headed monster; and that only such as
had very good heads could please it: that acting was not to be learned in
a day; and that without some traditional shrugs, which had been on the
stage, and only on the stage, these three hundred years, I could never
pretend to please.  The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts, as
almost every character was in keeping.  I was driven for some time from
one character to another, till at last Horatio was fixed upon, which the
presence of the present company has happily hindered me from
acting."</p>

<head>The Short Continuance of Friendship among the Vicious,
Which is  Coeval only with Mutual Satisfaction. </head>
<p>My son's account was too long to be delivered at once; the first
part of it was begun that night, and he was concluding the rest after
dinner the next day, when the appearance of Mr. Thornhill's equipage at
the door seemed to make a pause in the general satisfaction.  The butler,
who was now become my friend in the family, informed me with a
whisper that the 'Squire had already made some overtures to Miss
Wilmot, and that her aunt and uncle seemed highly to approve the
match.  Upon Mr. Thornhill's entering, he seemed at seeing my son and
me to start back; but I readily imputed that to surprise and not
displeasure.  However, upon our advancing to salute him, he returned
our greeting with the most apparent candor; and after a short time his
presence served only to increase the general good-humor,</p>
<p>After tea he called me aside to inquire after my daughter; but upon
my informing him that my inquiry was unsuccessful, he seemed greatly
surprised; adding

<pb n="174"/> that he had been since frequently at my house in order
to comfort the rest of my family, whom he left perfectly well.  He then
asked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot or my
son; and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet, he greatly
approved my prudence and precaution, desiring me by all means to keep
it a secret.  "For at best,' 'cried he, "it is but divulging one's own
infamy; and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine."
We were here interrupted by a servant, who came to ask the 'Squire in
to stand up at country dances; so that he left me quite pleased with the
interest he seemed to take in my concerns.  His addresses, however, to
Miss Wilmot were too obvious to be mistaken; and yet she seemed not
perfectly pleased, but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her
aunt than from real inclination.  I had even the satisfaction to see her
lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son, which the other could
neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity.  Mr. Thornhill's seeming
composure, however, not a little surprised me.  We had now continued
here a week, at the pressing instance of Mr. Arnold; but each day the
more tenderness Miss Wilmot showed my son, Mr. Thornhill's
friendship seemed proportionably to increase for him.</p>
<p>He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his
interest to serve the family; but now his generosity was not confined to
promises alone.  The

<pb n="175"/> morning I designed for my departure, Mr. Thornhill
came to me, with looks of real pleasure, to inform me of a piece of
service he had done for his friend George.  This was nothing less than
his having procured him an ensign's commission in one of the regiments
that was going to the West Indies, for which he had promised but one
hundred pounds, his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement
of the other two.  "As for this trifling piece of service," continued the
young gentleman, "I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having
served my friend; and as for the hundred pounds to be paid, if you are
unable to raise it yourselves, I will advance it, and you shall repay me
at your leisure." This was a favor we wanted words to express our sense
of; I readily therefore gave my bond for the money, and testified as
much gratitude as if I never intended to pay.</p>
<p>George was to depart for town the next day to secure his
commission, in pursuance of his generous patron's directions, who
judged it highly expedient to use despatch, lest, in the meantime, another
should step in with more advantageous proposals.  The next morning,
therefore, our young soldier was early prepared for his departure, and
seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it.  Neither
the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter, nor the friends and
mistress (for Miss Wilmot actually loved him) he was leaving behind,
any way damped his spirits.  After he

<pb n="176"/> had taken leave of the rest of the company, I gave him
all I had, my blessing.  "And now, my boy," cried I, "thou art going to
fight for thy country; remember how thy brave grandfather fought for his
sacred king, when loyalty among Britons was a virtue.  Go, my boy, and
imitate him in all but his misfortunes, if it was a misfortune to die with
Lord Falkland.  Go, my boy, and if you fall, though distant, exposed,
and unwept by those that love you, the most precious tears are those
with which Heaven bedews the unburied head of a soldier."</p>
<p>The next morning I took leave of the good family that had been
kind enough to entertain me so long, not without several expressions of
gratitude to Mr. Thornhill for his late bounty.  I left them in the enjoy
ment of all that happiness which affluence and good breeding procure,
and returned towards home, despairing of ever finding my daughter
more, but sending a sigh to Heaven to spare and forgive her.  I was now
come within about twenty miles of home, having hired a horse to carry
me, as I was yet but weak, and comforted myself with the hopes of
soon seeing all I held dearest upon earth.  But the night coming on, I put
up at a little public house by the roadside, and asked for the landlord's
company over a pint of wine.  We sat beside his kitchen fire, which was
the best room in the house, and chatted on politics and the news of the
country.  We happened, among other topics, to talk of

<pb n="177"/> young 'Squire Thornhill, who, the host assured me was
hated as much as his uncle, Sir William, who sometimes came down to
the country, was loved.  He went on to observe, that he made it his
whole study to betray the daughters of such as received him into their
houses, and after a fortnight or three weeks' possession, turned them out
unrewarded and abandoned to the world.</p>
<p>As we continued our discourse in this manner, his wife, who had
been out to get change, returned, and perceiving that her husband was
enjoying a pleasure in which she was not a sharer, she asked him, in an
angry tone, what he did there; to which he only replied in an ironical
way, by drinking her health.  "Mr.  Symonds," cried she, "you use me
very ill, and I'll bear it no longer.  Here three parts of the business is
left for me to do, and the fourth left unfinished; while you do nothing
but soak with the guests all day long; whereas if a spoonful of liquor
were to cure me of a fever, I never touch a drop." I now found what she
would be at, and immediately poured her out a glass, which she received
with a courtesy, and drinking towards my good health.  "Sir," resumed
she, "it is not so much for the value of the liquor I am angry, but one
cannot help it when the house is going out of the windows.  If the
customers or guests are to be dunned, all the burden lies upon my back;
he'd as lief eat that glass as budge after them himself.  There

<pb n="178"/> now, above-stairs, we have a young woman who has
come to take up her lodgings here, and I don't believe she has got any
money, by her over-civility.  I am certain she is very slow of payment,
and I wish she were put in mind of it." "What signifies minding her?"
cried the host; "if she be slow she is sure."-"I don't know that," replied
the wife: "but I know that I am sure she has been here a fortnight, and
we have not yet seen the cross of her money."-"I suppose, my dear,"
cried he, "we shall have it all in a lump."-"In a lump!" cried the other.
"I hope we may get it in any way; and that I am resolved we will this
very night, or out she tramps, bag and baggage."-"Consider, my dear,"
cried the husband, "she is a gentlewoman, and deserves more
respect."-"As for the matter of that," returned the hostess, "gentle or
simple, out she shall pack with a sussarara.  Gentry may be good things
where they take; but for my part I never saw much good of them at the
sign of the Harrow."</p>
<p>Thus saying, she ran up a narrow flight of stairs that went from
the kitchen to a room overhead, and I soon perceived, by the loudness of
her voice, and the bitterness of her reproaches, that no money was to be
had from her lodger.  I could hear her remonstrances very distinctly:
"Out, I say; pack out this moment; tramp, thou infamous strumpet! or
I'll give thee a mark you won't be the better for this three months.
What! you trumpery, to come and take up an honest house without

<pb n="179"/> cross or coin to bless yourself with; come along, I
say!"-"O dear madam," cried the stranger, "pity me, pity a poor
abandoned creature for one night, and death will soon do the rest!" I
instantly knew the voice of my poor, ruined child Olivia.  I flew to her
rescue, while the woman was dragging her along by the hair, and I
caught the dear forlorn wretch in my arms.  "Welcome, any way
welcome, my dearest lost one, my treasure, to your poor old father's
bosom! Though the vicious forsake thee, there is yet one in the world
that will never forsake thee; though thou hadst ten thousand crimes to
answer for, he will forget them all."-"O my own dear-" for minutes she
could say no more-"my own dearest, good papa! Could angels be kinder?
How do I deserve so much! The villain! I hate him and myself, to be a
reproach to such goodness.  You can't forgive me.  I know you
cannot."-"Yes, my child, from my heart I do forgive thee! only repent,
and we both shall yet be happy.  We shall see many pleasant days yet!
my Olivia!"-"Ah! never, sir, never.  The rest of my wretched life must
be infamy abroad and shame at home.  But alas! papa, you look much
paler than you used to do.  Could such a thing as I am give you so much
uneasiness ? Surely you have too much wisdom to take the miseries of
my guilt upon yourself.""Our wisdom, young woman," replied I-"Ah,
why so cold a name, papa?" cried she.  "This is the first time you ever
called me by so cold a name." "I ask pardon,

<pb n="180"/> my darling," returned I; "but I was going to observe
that wisdom makes but a slow defence against trouble, though at last a
sure one."</p>
<p>The landlady now returned to know if we did not choose a more
genteel apartment; to which assenting, we were shown a room where we
could converse more freely.  After we had talked ourselves into some
degree of tranquillity, I could not avoid desiring some account of the
gradations that led to her present wretched situation.  "That villain, sir,"
said she, "from the first day of our meeting made me honorable though
private proposals."</p>
<p>"Villain, indeed," cried I; "and yet it in some measure surprises
me bow a person of Mr. Burchell's good-sense and seeming honor could
be guilty of such deliberate baseness, and thus step into a family to undo
it."</p>
<p>"My dear papa," returned my daughter, "you labor under a strange
mistake.  Mr. Burchell never attempted to deceive me; instead of that,
he took every opportunity of privately admonishing me against the arti
fices of Mr. Thornhill, who I now find was even worse than he
represented him."-"Mr. Thornhill!" interrupted I, "can it be?"-"Yes,
sir," returned she, "it was Mr. Thornhill who seduced me, who
employed the two ladies as he called them, but who in fact were aban
doned women of the town without breeding or pity, to decoy us up to
London.  Their artifices, you may remember, would have certainly
succeeded, but for Mr.

<pb n="181"/> Burchell's letter, who directed those reproaches at
them, which we all applied to ourselves.  How he came to have so much
influence as to defeat their intentions still remains a secret to me; but I
am convinced he was ever our warmest, sincerest friend."</p>
<p>"You amaze me, my dear," cried I; "but now I find my first
suspicions of Mr. Thornhill's baseness were too well grounded; but he
can triumph in security, for he is rich and we are poor.  But tell me, my
child, sure it was no small temptation that could thus obliterate all the
impressions of such an education and so virtuous a disposition as
thine?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "he owes all his triumph to the desire I
had of making him, and not myself, happy.  I knew that the ceremony of
our marriage, which was privately performed by a Popish priest, was no
way binding, and that I had nothing to trust to but his honor."-"What!"
interrupted I, "and were you indeed married by a priest, and in
orders?"-"Indeed, sir, we were," replied she, "though we were both
sworn to conceal his name."-"Why then, my child, come to my arms
again; and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before; for
you are now his wife to all intents and purposes; nor can all the laws of
man, though written upon the tablets of adamant lessen the force of that
sacred connection."</p>
<p>"Alas! papa," replied she," you are but little acquainted with his
villainies; he has been married already

<pb n="182"/> by the same priest to six or eight wives more, whom,
like me, he has deceived and abandoned."</p>
<p>"Has he so?" cried I, "then we must hang the priest, and you shall
inform against him to-morrow."-"But, sir," returned she, "will that be
right, when I am sworn to secrecy?"-"My dear," I replied, "if you have
made such a promise I cannot, nor will I tempt you to break it. Even
though it may benefit the public, you must not inform against him.  In
all human institutions a smaller evil is allowed, to procure a greater
good; as in politics, a province may be given away to secure a king
dom; in medicine a limb may be lopped off to preserve the body.  But in
religion, the law is written and inflexible, never to do evil.  And this
law, my child, is right; for otherwise, if we commit a smaller evil to
procure a greater good, certain guilt would be thus incurred, in
expectation of contingent advantages.  And though the advantage should
certainly follow, yet the interval between commission and advantage,
which is allowed to be guilty, may be that in which we are called away
to answer for the things we have done, and the volume of human actions
is closed forever.  But I interrupt you, my dear; go on."</p>
<p>"The next morning," continued she, "I found what little
expectation I was to have from his sincerity.  That very morning he
introduced me to two more unhappy women, whom, like me, he had
deceived, but who lived in contented prostitution.  I loved him too
tenderly to

<pb n="183"/> bear such rivals in his affections, and strove to forget
my infamy in a tumult of pleasure.  With this view, I danced, dressed,
and talked; but still was unhappy.  The gentlemen who visited there told
me every moment of the power of my charms, and this only contributed
to increase my melancholy, as I had thrown all their power quite away.
Thus each day I grew more pensive, and he more insolent; till at last the
monster had the assurance to offer me to a young baronet of his
acquaintance.  Need I describe, sir, how his ingratitude stung me! My
answer to his proposal was almost madness.  I desired to part.  As I was
going, he offered me a purse; but I flung it at him with indignation, and
burst from him in a rage that for a while kept me insensible of the
miseries of my situation.  But I soon looked round me, and saw myself a
vile, abject, guilty thing, without one friend in the world to apply to.</p>
<p>"Just in that interval a stage-coach happening to pass by, I took a
place; it being my only aim to be driven at a distance from a wretch I
despised and detested.  I was set down here, where, since my arrival,
my own anxiety and this woman's unkindness have been my own
companions.  The hours of pleasure that I have passed with my mother
and sister now grow painful to me.  Their sorrows are much; but mine
are greater than theirs; for mine are mixed with guilt and
infamy."</p>
<p>"Have patience, my child," cried I, "and I hope

<pb n="184"/> things will yet be better.  Take some repose to-night,
and to-morrow I'll carry you home to your mother and the rest of the
family, from whom you will receive a kind reception.  Poor woman! this
has gone to her heart, but she loves you still, Olivia, and will forget
it."</p>

<head>Offences are Easily Pardoned Where There is Love at Bottom.
</head>
<p>THE next morning I took my daughter behind me, and set out on
my return home.  As we travelled along, I strove by every persuasion to
calm her sorrows and fears, and to arm her with resolution to bear the
presence of her offended mother.  I took every opportunity, from the
prospect of a fine country, through which we passed, to observe how
much kinder Heaven was to us, than we to each other, and that the
misfortunes of nature's making were very few.  I assured her that she
should never perceive any change in my affections, and that during my
life, which yet might be long, she might depend upon a guardian and an
instructor.  I armed her against the censures of the world; showed her
that books were sweet, unreproaching companions to the miserable, and
that if they could not bring us to enjoy life, they would at least teach us
to endure it.</p>
<p>The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn
by the way, within about five

<pb n="186"/> miles from my house; and as I was willing to prepare
my family for my daughter's reception, I determined to leave her that
night at the inn, and I to return for her, accompanied by my daughter
Sophia, early the next morning.  It was night before we reached our
appointed stage; however, after seeing her provided with a decent
apartment, and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper
refreshments, I kissed her, and proceeded towards home.  And now my
heart caught new sensations of pleasure the nearer I approached that
peaceful mansion.  As a bird that had been frightened f rom its nest, my
affections outwent my haste, and hovered round my little fireside with all
the rapture of expectation.  I called up the many fond things I had to
say, and anticipated the welcome I was to receive.  I already felt my
wife's tender embrace, and smiled at the joy of my little ones.  As I
walked but slowly, the night waned apace.  The laborers of the day were
all retired to rest; the lights were out in every cottage; no sounds were
heard but of the shrilling cock, and the deep-mouthed watch-dog at
hollow distance.  I approached my little abode of pleasure, and before I
was within a furlong of the place, our honest mastiff came running to
welcome me.</p>
<p>It was now near midnight that I came to knock at my door; all was
still and silent; my heart dilated with unutterable happiness; when, to my
amazement, I saw the house bursting out in a blaze of fire, and every

<pb n="187"/> aperture red with conflagration! I gave a loud con
vulsive outcry, and fell upon the pavement insensible.  This alarmed my
son, who had till this been asleep, and he perceiving the flames instantly
waked my wife and daughter, and all running out naked and wild with
apprehension, recalled me to life with their anguish.  But it was only to
objects of new terror; for the flames had by this time caught the roof of
our dwelling, part after part continuing to fall in, while the family stood
with silent agony looking on as if they enjoyed the blaze.  I gazed upon
them and upon it by turns, and then looked round me for my two little
ones; but they were not to be seen. 0 misery! "Where," cried I, "where
are my little ones?"-"They are burnt to death in the flames," says my
wife, calmly, "and I will die with them." That moment I heard the cry of
the babes within, who were just awaked by the fire, and nothing could
have stopped me.  "Where, where are my children?" cried I, rushing
through the flames, and bursting the door of the chamber in which they
were confined.  "Where are my little ones?"-"Here, dear papa, here we
are," cried they, together, while the flames were just catching the bed
where they lay.  I caught them both in my arms. and snatching them ran
through the fire as fast as possible, while just as I was got out, the roof
sunk in.  "-Now," cried I, holding up my children, "now let the flames
burn on, and all my possessions perish.  Here they are; I have saved
my treasure.

<pb n="188"/>


Here, my dearest, here are our treasures, and we shall
yet be happy." We kissed our little darlings a thousand
times, they clasped us round the neck, and seemed
to share our transports, while their mother laughed and wept by
turns.</p>

<pb n="189"/>
<p>I now stood a calm spectator of the flames, and after some time
began to perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible
manner.  It was, therefore, out of my power to give my son any
assistance, either in attempting to save our goods, or preventing the
flames spreading to our corn.  By this time the neighbors were
alarmed, and came running to our assistance; but all they could do was
to stand, like us, spectators of the calamity.  My goods, among which
were the notes I had reserved for my daughters' fortunes, were entirely
consumed, except a box with some papers that stood in the kitchen, and
two or three things more of little consequence, which my son brought
away in the beginning.  The neighbors contributed, however, what they
could to lighten our distress.  They brought us clothes, and furnished one
of our outhouses with kitchen utensils; so that by daylight we had
another, though a wretched dwelling, to retire to.  My honest next
neighbor and his children were not the least assiduous in providing us
with everything necessary, and offering whatever consolation untutored
benevolence could suggest.</p>
<p>When the fears of my family had subsided, curiosity to know the
cause of my long stay began to take place; having, therefore, informed
them of every particular, I proceeded to prepare them for the reception
of our lost one, and though we had nothing but wretchedness now to
impart, I was willing to procure her a welcome

<pb n="190"/> to what we had.  This task would have been more diffi
cult but for our recent calamity, which had humbled my wife's pride and
blunted it by more poignant afflictions.  Being unable to go for my
poor child myself, as my arm grew very painful, I sent my son and
daughter, who soon returned, supporting the wretched delinquent, who
had not the courage to look up at her mother, whom no instructions of
mine could persuade to a perfect reconciliation; for women have a much
stronger sense of female error than men.  "Ah, madam," cried her
mother, "this is but a poor place you have come to after so much finery.
My daughter Sophy and I can afford but little entertainment to persons
who have kept company only with people of distinction.  Yes, Miss
Livy, your poor father and I have suffered very much of late; but I hope
Heaven will forgive you." During this reception the unhappy victim
stood pale and trembling, unable to weep or to reply; but I could not
continue a silent spectator of her distress; wherefore assuming a degree
of severity in my voice and manner, which was ever followed with
instant submission: "I entreat, woman, that my words may be now
marked once for all; I have here brought you back a poor deluded
wanderer: her return to duty demands the revival of our tenderness.
The real hardships of life are now coming fast upon us; let us not,
therefore, increase them by dissension among each other.  If we live
harmoniously together, we may yet

<pb n="191"/> be contented, as there are enough of us to shut out the
censuring world and keep each other in countenance.  The kindness of
Heaven is promised to the penitent, and let ours be directed by the
example.  Heaven, we are assured, is much more pleased to view a
repentant sinner, than ninety-nine persons who have supported a course
of undeviating rectitude.  And this is right; for that single effort by
which we stop short in the downhill path to perdition, is itself a greater
exertion of virtue than a hundred acts of justice."</p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="23" id="d28"><pb n="192"/>
<head>None but the Guilty can be Long and Completely Miserable.
</head>
<p>SOME assiduity was now required to make our present abode as
convenient as possible, and we were soon again qualified to enjoy our
former serenity.  Being disabled myself from assisting my son in our
usual occupations, I read to my family from the few books that were
saved, and particularly from such as, by amusing the imagination,
contributed to ease the heart.  Our good neighbors, too, came every day
with the kindest condolence, and fixed a time in which they were all to
assist at repairing my former dwelling.  Honest Farmer Williams was not
last among these visitors: but heartily offered his friendship.  He would
even have renewed his addresses to my daughter; but she rejected them
in such a manner as totally repressed his future solicitations.  Her grief
seemed formed for continuing, and she was the only person of our little
society that a week did not restore to cheerfulness.  She now lost that
unblushing innocence which once taught her to respect herself, and to
seek pleasure by pleasing.

<pb n="193"/> Anxiety now had taken strong possession of her mind,
her beauty began to be impaired with her constitution, and neglect still
more contributed to diminish it.  Every tender epithet bestowed on her
sister brought a pang to her heart and a tear to her eye; and as one vice,
though cured, ever plants others where it has been, so her former guilt,
though driven out by repentance, left jealousy and envy behind.  I strove
a thousand ways to lessen her care, and even forgot my own pain in a
concern for hers, collecting such amusing passages of history as a
strong memory and some reading could suggest.  "Our happiness, my
dear," I would say, "is in the power of One who can bring it about a
thousand unforeseen ways that mock our foresight.  If example be
necessary to prove this, I'll give you a story, my child, told us by a
grave, though sometimes a romancing, historian.</p>
<p>"Matilda was married to a very young Neapolitan nobleman of the
first quality, and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of
fifteen.  As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open
window of an apartment, which hung over the river Volturna, the child
with a sudden spring leaped from her arms into the flood below, and
disappeared in a moment.  The mother, struck with instant surprise, and
making an effort to save him, plunged in after; but far from being able
to assist the infant, she herself with great difficulty escaped to the
opposite shore.

<pb n="194"/> just when some French soldiers were plundering the
country on that side, who immediately made her their prisoner.</p>
<p>"As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians
with the utmost inhumanity, they were going at once to perpetrate those
two extremes suggested by appetite and cruelty.  This base resolution,
however, was opposed by a young officer, who, though their retreat
required the utmost expedition, placed her behind him and brought her in
safety to his native city.  Her beauty at first caught his eye, her merit
soon after his heart.  They were married; he rose to the highest posts;
they lived long together and were happy.  But the felicity of a soldier
can never be called permanent; after an interval of several years, the
troops which he commanded having met with a repulse, he was obliged
to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife.  Here they
suffered a siege, and the city at length was taken.  Few histories can
produce more various instances of cruelty than those which the French
and Italians at that time exercised upon each other.  It was resolved by
the victors upon this occasion to put all the French prisoners to death,
but particularly the husband of the unfortunate Matilda, as he was
principally instrumental in protracting the siege.  Their determinations
were in general executed almost as soon as resolved upon.  The captive
soldier was led forth, and the executioner with his sword stood ready,

<pb n="195"/> while the spectators in gloomy silence awaited the fatal
blow, which was only suspended till the general, who presided as judge,
should give the signal.  It was in this interval of anguish and expectation
that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and de
liverer, deploring her wretched situation and the cruelty of fate that had
saved her from perishing by a premature death in the river Volturna, to
be the spectator of still greater calamities.  The general, who was a
young man, was struck with surprise at her beauty, and pity at her
distress; but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her
former danger.  He was her son, the infant for whom she had
encountered so much danger.  He acknowledged her at once as his
mother, and fell at her feet.  The rest may be easily supposed; the
captive was set free, and all the happiness that love, friendship, and duty
could confer on earth were united."</p>
<p>In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter; but she
listened with divided attention, for her own misfortunes engrossed all the
pity she once had for those of another, and nothing gave her ease.  In
company she dreaded contempt, and in solitude she only found anxiety.
Such was the color of her wretchedness, when we received certain
information that Mr. Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot,
for whom I always suspected be had a real passion, though he took every
opportunity before me to express

<pb n="196"/> his contempt both of her person and fortune.  This news
only served to increase poor Olivia's affliction; such a flagrant breach of
fidelity was more than her courage could support.  I was resolved,
however, to get more certain information, and to defeat, if possible, the
completion of his designs, by sending my son to old Mr. Wilmot's with
instructions to know the truth of the report, and to deliver Miss Wilmot
a letter intimating Mr. Thornhill's conduct in my family.  My son went
in pursuance of my directions, and in three days returned, assuring us of
the truth of the account; but that he had found it impossible to deliver the
letter, which he was therefore obliged to leave, as Mr. Thornhill and
Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country.  They were to be married,
he said, in a few days, having appeared together at church the Sunday
before he was there, in great splendor, the bride attended by six young
ladies, and he by as many gentlemen.  Their approaching nuptials filled
the whole country with rejoicing, and they usually rode out together in
the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many years.
All the friends of both families, he said, were there, particularly the
'Squire's uncle, Sir William Thornhill, who bore so good a character.
He added that nothing but mirth and feasting were going forward; that
all the country praised the young bride's beauty and the bridegroom's
fine person, and that they were immensely fond of each other;
concluding that he

<pb n="197"/>


<pb n="198"/> could not help thinking Mr. Thornhill one of the most
happy men in the world.</p>
<p>"Why, let him if he can," returned I; "but, my son, observe this
bed of straw and unsheltering roof; those mouldering walls and humid
floor; my wretched body thus disabled by fire, and my children weeping
round me for bread.  You have come home, my child, to all this; yet
here, even here, you see a man that would not for a thousand worlds
exchange situations. 0 my children, if you could but learn to commune
with your own hearts, and know what noble company you can make
them, you would little regard the elegance and splendor of the worthless.
Almost all men have been taught to call life a passage, and themselves
the travellers.  The similitude still may be improved, when we observe
that the good are joyful and serene, like travellers that are going
towards home; the wicked but by intervals happy, like travellers that are
going into exile."</p>
<p>My compassion for my poor daughter, overpowered by this new
disaster, interrupted what I had further to observe.  I bade her mother
support her, and after a short time she recovered.  She appeared from
that time more calm, and, I imagined, had gained a new degree of
resolution: but appearances deceived me; for her tranquillity was the
languor of overwrought resentment.</p>
<p>A supply of provisions charitably sent us by my

<pb n="199"/> kind parishioners, seemed to diffuse new cheerfulness
among the rest of the family; nor was I displeased at seeing them once
more sprightly and at ease.  It would have been unjust to damp their
satisfactions, merely to condole with resolute melancholy, or to burden
them with a sadness they did not feel.  Thus once more the tale went
round, and the song was demanded, and cheerfulness condescended to
hover round our little habitation.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="24" id="d29"><pb n="200"/>
<head>Fresh Calamities. </head>
<p>THE next morning the sun arose with peculiar warmth for the
season; so that we agreed to breakfast together on the honeysuckle bank;
where, while we sat, my youngest daughter, at my request, joined her
voice to the concert on the trees about us.  It was in this place my poor
Olivia first met her seducer, and every object served to recall her
sadness.  But that melancholy which is excited by objects of pleasure, or
inspired by sounds of harmony, soothes the heart instead of corroding
it.  Her mother, too, upon this occasion, felt a pleasing distress, and
wept, and loved her daughter as before.  "Do, my pretty Olivia," cried
she, "let us have that little melancholy air your papa was so fond of;
your sister Sophy has already obliged us.  Do, child; it will please your
old father." She complied in a manner so exquisitely pathetic as moved
me. </p>

</lg>
<p>As she was concluding the last stanza, to which an interruption in
her voice from sorrow gave peculiar softness, the appearance of Mr.
Thornhill's equipage at a distance alarmed us all, but particularly
increased the uneasiness of my eldest daughter, who, desirous of
shunning her betrayer, returned to the house with her sister.  In a few
minutes he was alighted from his chariot, and making up to the place
where I was still sitting, inquired after my health with his usual air of
familiarity.  "Sir," replied I, "your present assurance only serves to
aggravate the baseness of your character; and there was a time when I
would have chastised your insolence for presuming thus to appear before
me. But now you are safe; for age has cooled my passions, and my
calling restrains me."</p>
<p>"I vow, my dear sir," returned he, "I am amazed at all this; nor
can I understand what it means; I hope you don't think your daughter's
late excursion with me had anything criminal in it."</p>
<p>"Go," cried I, "thou art a wretch, a poor, pitiful wretch, and every
way a liar; but your meanness secures you from my anger.  Yet, sir, I
am descended from a family that would not have borne this! And so,
thou vile thing! to gratify a momentary passion,

<pb n="202"/> thou hast made one poor creature wretched for life, and
polluted a family that had nothing but honor for their portion."</p>
<p>"If she or you," returned he, "are resolved to be miserable, I
cannot help it.  But you may still be happy; and whatever opinion you
may have formed of me, you shall ever find me ready to contribute to it.
We can marry her to another in a short time, and what is more, she may
keep her lover beside; for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true
regard for her."</p>
<p>I found all my passions alarmed at this new degrading proposal;
for although the mind may often be calm under great injuries, little
villainy can at any time get within the soul and sting it into rage.
"Avoid my sight, thou reptile," cried I, "nor continue to insult me with
thy presence.  Were my brave son at home he would not suffer this; but
I am old and disabled, and every way undone."</p>
<p>"I find," cried he, "you are bent upon obliging me to talk in a
harsher manner than I intended.  But as I have shown you what may be
hoped from my friendship, it may not be improper to represent what
may be the consequences of my resentment.  My attorney, to whom your
late bond has been transferred, threatens hard, nor do I know how to
prevent the course of justice, except by paying the money myself,
which, as I have been at some expenses lately, previous to my intended
marriage, is not so easy to be done, And then

<pb n="203"/> my steward talks of driving for the rent: it is certain he
knows his duty, for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature.
Yet still I could wish to serve you, and even to have you and your
daughter present at my marriage, which is shortly to be solemnized with
Miss Wilmot; it is even the request of my charming Arabella herself,
whom I hope you will not refuse."</p>
<p>"Mr.  Thornhill," replied I, "hear me once for all; as to your
marriage with any but my daughter, that I never will consent to; and
though your friendship could raise me to a throne, or your resentment
sink me to the grave, yet would I despise both.  Thou hast once
woefully, irreparably deceived me.  I reposed my heart upon thine
honor, and have found its baseness.  Never more, therefore, expect
friendship from me.  Go, and possess what fortune has given
thee-beauty, riches, health, and pleasure.  Go and leave me to want,
infamy, disease, and sorrow.  Yet humbled as I am, shall my heart still
vindicate its dignity, and though thou hast my forgiveness, thou shalt
ever have my contempt."</p>
<p>"If so," returned he, "depend upon it you shall feel the effects of
this insolence, and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of
scorn, you or me." Upon which he departed abruptly.</p>
<p>My wife and son, who were present at this interview, seemed
terrified with apprehension. My daughters also, finding that he was
gone, came out to be informed of the result of our conference, which,
when known,

<pb n="204"/> alarmed them not less than the rest.  But as to myself I
disregarded the utmost stretch of his malevolence: he had already struck
the blow, and now I stood prepared to repel every new effort; like one
of those instruments used in the art of war which, however thrown,
still presents a point to receive the enemy.</p>
<p>We soon, however, found that he had not threatened in vain; for
the very next morning his steward came to demand my annual rent,
which, by the train of accidents already related, I was unable to pay.
The consequence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that
evening, and their being appraised and sold the next day for less than
half their value.  My wife and children now, therefore, entreated me to
comply upon any terms rather than incur certain destruction.  They even
begged of me to admit his visits once more, and used all their little
eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure: the terrors of a
prison in so rigorous a season as the present, with the danger that threat
ened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire.  But I
continued inflexible.  "Why, my treasures," cried I, "why will you thus
attempt to persuade me to the thing that is not right! My duty has
taught me to forgive him; but my conscience will not permit me to
approve.  Would you have me applaud to the world what my heart must
internally condemn? Would you have me tamely sit down and flatter our
infamous betrayer; and, to avoid a prison, continually

<pb n="205"/> suffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement?
No, never! If we are to be taken from this abode, only let us hold to the
right; and wherever we are thrown, we can still retire to a charming
apartment, when we can look round our own hearts with intrepidity and
with pleasure!"</p>
<p>In this manner we spent that evening.  Early the next morning, as
the snow had fallen in great abundance in the night, my son was
employed in clearing it away, and opening a passage before the door.
He had not been thus engaged long when he came running in, with looks
all pale, to tell us that two strangers, whom he knew to be officers of
justice, were making towards the house.</p>
<p>just as he spoke they came in, and approaching the bed where I
lay, after previously informing me of their employment and business,
made me their prisoner, bidding me prepare to go with them to the
county gaol, which was eleven miles off.</p>
<p>"My friends," said I, "this is severe weather on which you have
come to take me to a prison; and it is particularly unfortunate at this
time, as one of my arms has lately been burned in a terrible manner, and
it has thrown me into a slight fever, and I want clothes to cover me, and
I am now too weak and old to walk far in such deep snow; but if it must
be so-"</p>
<p>I then turned to my wife and children, and directed them to get
together what few things were left us.,

<pb n="206"/> and to prepare immediately for leaving this place.  I
entreated them to be expeditious, and desired my son to assist his eldest
sister, who, from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our
calamities, was fallen, and had lost anguish in insensibility.  I
encouraged my wife, who, pale and trembling, clasped our affrighted
little ones in her arms, that clung to her bosom in silence, dreading to
look round at the strangers.  In the meantime my youngest daughter
prepared for our departure, and as she received several hints to use dis
patch, in about an hour we were ready to depart. </p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="25" id="d30"><pb n="207"/>
<head>No Situation, However Wretched It Seems, but Has Some Sort
of Comfort Attending It. </head>
<p>WE set forward from this peaceful neighborhood, and walked on
slowly.  My eldest daughter being enfeebled by a slow fever, which
had begun for some days to undermine her constitution, one of the
officers, who had a horse, kindly took her behind him; for even these
men cannot entirely divest themselves of humanity.  My son led one of
the little ones by the hand, and my wife the other, while I leaned upon
my youngest girl, whose tears fell not for her own but my dis
tresses.</p>
<p>We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles, when
we saw a crowd running and shouting behind us, consisting of about
fifty of my poorest parishioners.  These, with dreadful imprecations,
soon seized upon the two officers of justice, and swearing that they
would never see their minister go to gaol while they had a drop of blood
to shed in his defence, were going to use them with great severity.  The
consequence might have been fatal, had I not immediately

<pb n="208"/> interposed, and with some difficulty rescued the offi
cers from the hands of the enraged multitude.  My children, who looked
upon my delivery now as certain, appeared transported with joy, and
were incapable of containing their raptures.  But they were soon unde
ceived, upon hearing me address the poor deluded people, who came,
as they imagined, to do me service.</p>
<p>"What! my friends," cried I, "and is this the way you love me? Is
this the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the
pulpit? Thus to fly in the face of justice, and bring down ruin on your
selves and me! Which is your ringleader? Show me the man that has thus
seduced you.  As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment.  Alas! my
dear deluded flock, return back to the duty you owe to God, to your
country, and to me.  I shall  yet, perhaps, one day see you in greater
felicity here,  and contribute to make your lives more happy.  But  let it
at least be my comfort when I pen my fold for  immortality, that not one
here shall be wanting."</p>
<p>They now seemed all repentance, and, melting into tears, came one
after the other to bid me farewell.  I shook each tenderly by the hand,
and leaving them my blessings, proceeded forward without meeting any
further interruption.  Some hours before night we reached the town, or
rather village; for it consisted but of a few mean houses, having lost all
its former opulence, and

<pb n="209"/> retaining no marks of its ancient superiority but the
gaol.</p>
<p>Upon entering we put up at the inn, where we had such
refreshments as could most readily be procured, and I supped with my
family with my usual cheerfulness.  After seeing them properly
accommodated for that night, I next attended the sheriff's officers to the
prison, which had formerly been built for the purposes of war, and
consisted of one large apartment strongly grated and paved with stone,
common to both felons and debtors at certain hours in the
four-and-twenty.  Besides this, every prisoner had a separate cell, where
he was locked in for the night.</p>
<p>I expected upon my entrance to find nothing but lamentations and
various sounds of misery; but it was very different.  The prisoners
seemed all employed in one common design, that of forgetting thought in
merriment or clamor.  I was apprized of the usual perquisite required
upon these occasions, and immediately complied with the demand,
though the little money I had was very near being all exhausted.  This
was immediately sent away for liquor, and the whole prison soon was
filled with riot, laughter, and profaneness.</p>
<p>"How,"  cried I to myself, "shall men so very wicked be cheerful,
and shall I be melancholy! I feel only the same confinement with them,
and I think I have more reason to be happy."</p>
<p>With such reflections I labored to become cheerful;

<pb n="210"/> but cheerfulness was never yet produced by effort,
which is itself painful.  As I was sitting therefore in the corner of the
gaol in a pensive posture, one of my fellow-prisoners came up, and
sitting by me entered into conversation.  It was my constant rule in life
never      to avoid the conversation of any man who
seemed to desire it; for if good, I might profit by his instruction; if bad,
he might be assisted by mine.  I found this to be a knowing man, of
strong unlettered sense, but a thorough knowledge of the world as it is
called, or, more properly speaking, of human nature on the wrong side.

<pb n="211"/> He asked me if I had taken care to provide myself with
a bed, which was a circumstance I had never once attended to.</p>
<p>"That's unfortunate," cried he, "as you are allowed here nothing
but straw, and your apartment is very large and cold.  However, you
seem to be something of a gentleman, and as I have been one myself in
my time, part of my bedclothes are heartily at your service."</p>
<p>I thanked him, expressing my surprise at finding such humanity in
a gaol in misfortunes; adding, to let him see that I was a scholar, "that
the ancient sage seemed to understand the value of company in afflic
tion, when he said, [Greek quotation]; and in fact," continued I, "what is
the world if it affords only solitude?"</p>
<p>"You talk of the world, sir," returned my fellowprisoner, "the
world is in its dotage; and yet the cosmogony or creation of the world
has puzzled the philosophers of every age.  What a medley of opinions
have they not broached upon the creation of the world! Sanchoniathon,
Manetho, Berosus, and Ocellus Lucanus have all attempted it in vain.
The latter has these words: "[Greek quotation], which imply-" "I ask
pardon, sir," cried I, "for interrupting so much learning; but I think I
have heard all this before.  Have I not had the pleasure of once seeing
you at Welbridge fair, and is not your

<pb n="212"/> name Ephraim Jenkinson?" At this demand he only
sighed.  "I suppose you must recollect," resumed I, "one Dr. Primrose,
from whom you bought a horse?"</p>
<p>He now at once recollected me; for the gloominess of the place
and the approaching night had prevented his distinguishing my features
before.  "Yes, sir," returned Mr. Jenkinson, "I remember you perfectly
well; I bought a horse, but forgot to pay for him.  Your neighbor
Flamborough is the only prosecutor I am any way afraid of at the next
assizes; for he intends to swear positively against me as a coiner.  I am
heartily sorry, sir, I ever deceived you, or indeed any man; for you
see," continued he, showing his shackles, "what my tricks have brought
me to."</p>
<p>"Well, sir," replied I, "your kindness in offering me assistance
when you could expect no return, shall be repaid with my endeavors to
soften or totally suppress Mr. Flamborough's evidence, and I will send
my son to him for that purpose the first opportunity; nor do I in the least
doubt but he will comply with my request, and as to my own evidence,
you need be under no uneasiness about that."</p>
<p>"Well, sir," cried he, "all the return I can make shall be yours.
You shall have more than half my bedclothes to-night, and I'll take care
to stand your friend in the prison, where I think I have some influ
ence."</p>
<p>I thanked him, and could not avoid being surprised

<pb n="213"/> at the present youthful change in his aspect; for at the
time I had seen him before, he appeared at least sixty.  "Sir," answered
he, "you are little acquainted with the world; I had at that time false
hair, and have learnt the art of counterfeiting every age from seventeen
to seventy.  Ah! sir, had I but bestowed half the pains in learning a trade
that I have in learning to be a scoundrel, I might have been a rich man at
this  day. But rogue as I am, still I may  be  your  friend,  and that,
perhaps, when you least expect it."</p>
<p>We were now prevented from further conversation by the arrival
of the gaoler's servants, who came to call over the prisoners' names, and
lock tip for the night.  A fellow also with a bundle of straw for my bed
attended, who led me along a dark narrow passage into a room paved
like the common prison, and in one corner of this I spread my bed, and
the clothes given me by my fellow-prisoner; which done, my con
ductor, who was civil enough, bade me a good night.  After my usual
meditations, and having praised my Heavenly Corrector, I laid myself
down, and slept with the utmost tranquillity till morning.</p>

<head>A Reformation in the Gaol-To Make Laws Complete They
Should Reward as well as Punish. </head>
<p>THE next morning early I was awakened by my family, whom I
found in tears at my bedside.  The gloomy strength of every thing about
us, it seems, had daunted them.  I gently rebuked their sorrow, assuring
them I had never slept with greater tranquillity, and next inquired after
my eldest daughter, who was not among them.  They informed me that
yesterday's uneasiness and fatigue had increased her fever, and it was
judged proper to leave her behind.  My next care was to send my son to
procure a room or two for to lodge the family in, as near the prison as
conveniently could be found.  He obeyed; but could find only one
apartment, which was hired at a small expense for his mother and
sisters, the gaoler, with humanity, consenting to let him and his two
little brothers lie in the prison with me.  A bed was therefore prepared
for them in a corner of the room, which I thought answered very
conveniently.  I was willing, however, previously to know whether my
little children chose to

<pb n="215"/> lie in a place which seemed to fright them upon en
trance.</p>
<p>"Well," cried I, "my good boys, how do you like your new bed? I
hope you are not afraid to lie in this room, dark as it appears?"</p>
<p>"No, papa," says Dick, "I am not afraid to lie anywhere where
you are."</p>
<p>"And I," says Bill, who was yet but four years old, "love every
place that my papa is in."</p>
<p>After this, I allotted to each of the family what they were to do.
My daughter was particularly directed to watch her sister's declining
health; my wife was to attend me; my little boys were to read to me:
"And as for you, my son," continued I, "it is by the labor of your hands,
we must all hope to be supported.  Your wages as a day laborer will be
fully sufficient, with proper frugality, to maintain us all, and
comfortably, too.  Thou art now sixteen years old, and hast strength, and
it was given thee, my son, for very useful purposes; for it must save
from famine your helpless parents and family.  Prepare, then, this
evening to look out for work against to-morrow, and bring home every
night what money you earn, for our support."</p>
<p>Having thus instructed him and settled the rest, I walked down to
the common prison, where I could enjoy more air and room.  But I was
not long there, when the execrations, lewdness and brutality that in
vaded me on every side, drove me back to my apartment

<pb n="216"/> again.  Here I sat for some time, pondering upon the
strange infatuation of wretches, who, finding all mankind in open arms
against them, were laboring to make themselves a future and a
tremendous-enemy.</p>
<p>Their insensibility excited my highest compassion, and blotted my
own uneasiness from my mind.  It even appeared a duty incumbent upon
me to attempt to reclaim them.  I resolved, therefore, once more to
return, and, in spite of their contempt, to give them my advice, and
conquer them by perseverance.  Going, therefore, among them again, I
informed Mr. Jenkinson of my design, at which he laughed heartily,
but communicated it to the rest.  The proposal was received with the
greatest good-humor, as it promised to afford a new fund of
entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth but
what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery.</p>
<p>I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud,
unaffected voice, and found my audience perfectly merry upon the
occasion.  Lewd whispers, groans of contrition burlesqued, winking and
coughing, alternately excited laughter.  However, I continued with
my natural solemnity to read on, sensible that what I did might mend
some, but could itself receive no contamination from any.</p>
<p>After reading, I entered upon my exhortation, which was rather
calculated at first to amuse them than to reprove.  I previously observed
that no other motive

<pb n="217"/> but their welfare could induce me to this; that I was
their fellow-prisoner, and now got nothing by preaching.I was sorry, I
said, to hear them so very profane; because they got nothing by it, but
might lose a great deal: "For be assured, my friends," cried I,"for you
are my friends, however the world may disclaim your
friendship,-though you swore twelve thousand oaths in a day, it would
not put one penny in your purse.  Then what signifies calling every mo
ment upon the Devil and courting his friendship, since you find how
scurvily he uses you.  He has given you nothing here, you find, but a
mouthful of oaths and an empty belly; and by the best accounts I have of
him, he will give you nothing that's good hereafter.</p>
<p>"If used ill in our dealings with one man, we naturally go
elsewhere.  Were it not worth your while, then, just to try how you may
like the usage of another Master, who gives you fair promises at least to
come to Him.  Surely, my friends, of all stupidity in the world, his must
be the greatest who, after robbing a house, runs to the thief-takers for
protection.  And yet how are you more wise? You are all seeking com
fort from one that has already betrayed you, applying to a more
malicious being than any thief-taker of them all; for they only decoy and
then hang you; but he decoys and hangs, and, what is worst of all, will
not let you loose after the hangman has done."</p>
<p>When I had concluded, I received the compliments

<pb n="218"/> of my audience, some of whom came and shook me by
the hand, swearing that I was a very honest fellow, and that they desired
my further acquaintance.  I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next
day, and actually conceived some hopes of making a reformation here;
for it had ever been my opinion, that no man was past the hour of
amendment, every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof, if the archer
could but take a proper aim.  When I had thus satisfied my mind, I went
back to my apartment, where my wife prepared a frugal meal, while Mr.
Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours, and partake of the
pleasure, as he was kind enough to express it, of my conversation.  He
had not yet seen my family; for as they came to my apartment by a door
in the narrow passage already described, by this means they avoided the
common prison.  Jenkinson, at the first interview, therefore, seemed not
a little struck with the beauty of my youngest daughter, which her
pensive air contributed to heighten, and my little ones did not pass
unnoticed.</p>
<p>"Alas! doctor," cried he, "these children are too handsome and too
good for such a place as this!"</p>
<p>"Why, Mr. Jenkinson," replied I, "thank Heaven my children are
pretty tolerable in morals; and if they be good, it matters little for the
rest."</p>
<p>"I fancy, sir," returned my fellow-prisoner, "that

<pb n="219"/> it must give you great comfort to have all this little
family about you."</p>
<p>"A comfort, Mr. Jenkinson," replied I; "yes, it is indeed a
comfort, and I would not be without them for all the world; for they can
make a dungeon seem a palace.  There is but one way in this life of
wounding my happiness, and that is by injuring them."</p>
<p>"I am afraid then, sir," cried he, "that I am in some measure
culpable; for I think I see here," looking at my son Moses, "one that I
have injured, and by whom I wish to be forgiven."</p>
<p>My son immediately recollected his voice and features, though he
had before seen him in disguise, and taking him by the hand, with a
smile forgave him.  "Yet," continued he, "I can't help wondering at
what you could see in my face to think me a proper mark for
deception."</p>
<p>"My dear sir," returned the other, "it was not your face, but your
white stockings and the black riband in your hair that allured me.  But
no disparagement to your parts, I have deceived wiser men than you in
my time; and yet, with all my tricks, the blockheads have been too many
for me at last."</p>
<p>"I suppose," cried my son, "that the narrative of such a life as
yours must be extremely instructive and amusing!"</p>
<p>"Not much of either," returned Mr. Jenkinson. "Those relations
which describe the tricks and vices

<pb n="220"/> only of mankind, by increasing our suspicion in life
retard our success.  The traveller that distrusts every person that he
meets, and turns back upon the appearance of every man that looks like
a robber, seldom arrives in time at his journey's end.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I think from my own experience, that the knowing one is
the silliest fellow under the sun.  I was thought cunning from my very
childhood; when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a
perfect little man; at fourteen I knew the world, cocked my hat, and
loved the ladies; at twenty, though I was perfectly honest, yet every one
thought me so cunning that no one would trust me.  Thus I was at last
obliged to turn sharper in my own defence, and have lived ever since,
my head throbbing with schemes to deceive, and my heart palpitating
with fears of detection.  I used often to laugh at your honest, simple
neighbor Flamborough, and one way or another generally cheated him
once a year.  Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion,
and grew rich, while I still continued tricksy and cunning, and was poor,
without the consolation of being honest.  However," continued he, "let
me know your case, and what has brought you here; perhaps, though I
have not skill to avoid a gaol myself, I may extricate my friends."</p>
<p>In compliance with this curiosity, I informed him of the whole
train of accidents and follies that had

<pb n="221"/> plunged me into my present troubles, and my utter in
ability to get free.</p>
<p>After hearing my story and pausing some minutes, he slapped his
forehead, as if he had hit upon something material, and took his leave,
saying he would try what could be done.</p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="27" id="d32"><pb n="222"/>
<head>The Same Subject Continued. </head>
<p>THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the
scheme I had planned of reforming the prisoners, which they received
with universal disapprobation, alleging the impossibility and
impropriety of it; adding, that my endeavors would no way contribute
to their amendment, but might probably disgrace my calling.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," returned I, "these people, however fallen, are still
men, and that is a very good title to my affections.  Good counsel
rejected returns to enrich the giver's bosom; and though the instruction
I communicate may not mend them, yet it will assuredly mend myself.
If these wretches, my children, were princes, there would be thousands
ready to offer their ministry; but in my opinion the heart that is buried in
a dungeon is as precious as that seated upon a throne.  Yes, my
treasures, if I can mend them I will; perhaps they will not all despise
me.  Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulf, and that will be
great gain;

<pb n="223"/> for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human
soul ?"</p>
<p>Thus saying, I left them and descended to the common prison,
where I found the prisoners very merry, expecting my arrival; and each
prepared with some gaol trick to play upon the doctor.  Thus, as I was
going to begin, one turned my wig awry, as if by accident, and then
asked my pardon.  A second, who stood at some distance, had a knack
of spitting through his teeth, which fell in showers upon my book.  A
third would cry "amen" in such an affected tone as gave the rest great
delight.  A fourth had slily picked my pocket of my spectacles.  But
there was one whose trick gave more universal pleasure than all the rest;
for, observing the manner in which I had disposed of my books on the
table before me, he very dexterously displaced one of them, and put an
obscene jest-book of his own in the place.  However, I took no notice of
all that this mischievous group of little beings could do, but went on,
perfectly sensible that what was ridiculous in my attempt would excite
mirth only the first or second time, while what was serious would be
permanent.  My design succeeded, and in less than six days some were
patient and all attentive.</p>
<p>It was now that I applauded my perseverance and address, at thus
giving sensibility to wretches divested of every moral feeling, and now
began to think of doing them temporal services also, by rendering their

<pb n="224"/> situation somewhat more comfortable.  Their time had
hitherto been divided between famine and excess, tumultuous riot and
bitter repining.  Their only employment was quarrelling -among each
other, playing at cribbage, and cutting tobacco-stoppers.  From this last
mode of idle industry I took the hint of setting such as chose to work at
cutting pegs for tobacconists and shoemakers, the proper wood being
bought by a general subscription, and when manufactured, sold by my
appointment; so that each earned something every day-a trifle, indeed,
but sufficient to maintain him.  I did not stop here, but instituted fines
for the punishment of immorality, and rewards for peculiar industry.
Thus, in less than a fortnight, I had formed them into something social
and humane, and had the pleasure of regarding myself as a legislator,
who had brought men from their native ferocity into friendship and
obedience.</p>
<p>And it were highly to be wished, that the legislative power would
thus direct the law rather to reformation than severity.  That it would
seem convinced that the work of eradicating crimes is not by making
punishment familiar, but formidable.  Then, instead of our present
prisons, which find or make men guilty, which enclose wretches for the
commission of one crime, and return them, if returned alive, fitted for
the perpetration of thousands; we should see, as in other parts of
Europe, places of penitence and solitude, where the

<pb n="225"/> accused might be attended by such as could  give them
repentance if guilty, or new motives to virtue if innocent.  And this,
but not the increasing punishments, is the way to mend a state; nor can I
avoid even questioning the validity of that right which social combi
nations have assumed of capitally punishing offences of a slight nature.
In cases of murder their right is obvious, as it is the duty of us all, from
the law of selfdefence, to cut off that man who has shown a disregard
for the life of another.  Against such all nature rises in arms; but it is not
so against him who steals my property.  Natural law gives me no right to
take away his life, as by that the horse he steals is as much his property
as mine.  If, then, I have any right, it must be from a compact made
between us, that he who deprives the other of his horse shall die.  But
this is a false compact, because no man has a right to barter his life any
more than to take it away, as it is not his own.  And besides, the
compact is inadequate, and would be set aside even in a court of modern
equity, as there is a great penalty for a very trifling convenience, since it
is far better that two men should live than that one man should ride.  But
a compact that is false between two men is equally so between a hundred
or a hundred thousand; for as ten millions of circles can never make a
square, so the united voice of myriads cannot lend the smallest
foundation to falsehood.  It is thus that reason speaks, and untutored
nature says the same

<pb n="226"/>
thing.  Savages that are directed by natural law alone are
very tender of the lives of each other; they seldom shed blood but to
retaliate former cruelty.</p>
<p>Our Saxon ancestors, fierce as they were in war, had but few
executions in times of peace; and in all commencing governments that
have the print of nature still strong upon them, scarcely any crime is
held capital.</p>
<p>It is among the citizens of a refined community that penal laws,
which are in the hands of the rich, are laid upon the poor.  Government,
while it grows older, seems to acquire the moroseness of age; and as if
our property were become dearer in proportion as it increased; as if the
more enormous our wealth, the more extensive our fears, all our
possessions are paled up with new edicts every day, and hung. round
with gibbets to scare every invader.</p>
<p>I cannot tell whether it is from the number of our penal laws, or
the licentiousness of our people, that this country should show more
convicts in a year than half the dominions of Europe united.  Perhaps it
is owing to both, for they mutually produce each other.  When, by
indiscriminate penal laws, a nation beholds the same punishment affixed
to dissimilar degrees of guilt, from perceiving no distinction in the
penalty, the people are led to lose all sense of distinction in the crime,
and this distinction is the bulwark of all morality:

<pb n="227"/>
thus the multitude of laws produce new vices, and new
vices call for fresh restraints.</p>
<p>It were to be wished, then, that power, instead of contriving new
laws to punish vice, instead of drawing hard the cords of society till a
convulsion come to burst them, instead of cutting away wretches as
useless before we have tried their utility, instead of converting correction
into vengeance, it were to be wished that we tried the restrictive arts of
government, and made law the protector, but not the tyrant of the
people.  We should then find that creatures, whose souls are held as
dross, only wanted the hand of a refiner; we should then find that
creatures now stuck up for long tortures, lest luxury should feel a mo
mentary pang, might, if properly treated, serve to sinew the state in
times of danger; that as their faces are like ours, their hearts are so too;
that few minds are so base as that perseverance cannot amend; that a
man may see his last crime without dying for it; and that very little
blood will serve to cement our security.</p>

<p>I HAD now been confined more than a fortnight, but had not,
since my arrival, been visited by my dear Olivia, and I greatly longed to
see her.  Having communicated my wishes to my wife, the next
morning, the poor girl entered my apartment, leaning on her sister's
arm.  The change which I saw in her countenance struck me.  The
numberless graces that once resided there were now fled, and the hand
of death seemed to have moulded every feature to alarm me.  Her
temples were sunk, her forehead was tense, and a fatal paleness sat upon
her cheek.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see thee, my dear," cried I, "but why this dejection,
Livy? I hope, my love, you have too great a regard for me to permit
disappointment thus to undermine a life which I prize as my own.  Be
cheerful, child, and we may yet see happier days."</p>
<p>"You have ever, sir," replied she, "been kind to me, and it adds to
my pain that I shall never have an opportunity

<pb n="229"/> of sharing that happiness you promise.  Happiness, I
fear, is no longer reserved for me here, and I long to be rid of a place
where I have only found distress.  Indeed, sir, I wish you would make
a proper submission to Mr. Thornhill; it may, in some measure, induce
him to pity you, and it will give me relief in dying."</p>
<p>"Never, child," replied I, "never will I be brought to acknowledge
my daughter a prostitute; for though the world may look upon your
offence with scorn, let it be mine to regard it as a mark of credulity, not
of guilt.  My dear, I am no way miserable in this place, however dismal
it may seem; and be assured that while you continue to bless me by
living, he shall never have my consent to make you more wretched by
marrying another,"</p>
<p>After the departure of my daughter, my fellowprisoner, who was
by at this interview, sensibly enough expostulated upon my obstinacy, in
refusing a submission which promised to give me freedom.  He
observed that the rest of my family was not to be sacrificed to the
peace of one child alone, and she the only one who had offended me.
"Besides," added he, "I don't know if it be just thus to obstruct the
union of man and wife, which you do at present, by refusing to consent
to a match you cannot hinder, but may render unhappy."</p>
<p>"Sir," replied I, "you are unacquainted with the

<pb n="230"/> man that oppresses us.  I am very sensible that no
submission I can make could procure me liberty even for an hour.  I am
told that even in this very room a debtor of his, no later than last year,
died for want.  But though my submission and approbation could transfer
me from hence to the most beautiful apartment he is possessed of, yet I
would grant neither; as something whispers me that it would be giving a
sanction to adultery.  While my daughter lives, no other marriage of
his shall ever be legal in my eye.  Were she removed, indeed, I should
be the basest of men, from any resentment of my own, to attempt putting
asunder those who wish for a union.  No, villain as he is, I should then
wish him married, to prevent the consequences of his future
debaucheries.  But now should I not be the most cruel of all fathers to
sign an instrument which must send my child to the grave, merely to
avoid a prison myself: and thus, to escape one pang, break my child's
heart with a thousand?"</p>
<p>He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but could not avoid
observing that he feared my daughter's life was already too much
wasted to keep me long a prisoner.  "However," continued he, "though
you refuse to submit to the nephew, I hope you have no objections to
laying your case before the uncle, who has the first character in the
kingdom for every thing that is just and good.  I would advise you to
send him a letter by the post, intimating all his nephew's ill-usage,

<pb n="231"/> and my life for it, in three days you shall have an
answer." I thanked him for the hint, and instantly set about complying;
but I wanted paper, and unluckily all our money had been laid out that
morning in provisions; however, he supplied me.</p>
<p>For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety to know
what reception my letter might meet with; but in the meantime was
frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than
remain here, and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of
my daughter's health.  The third day and the fourth arrived, but I
received no answer to my letter -the complaints of a stranger against a
favorite nephew were no way likely to succeed; so that these hopes soon
vanished like all my former.  My mind, however, still supported itself,
though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my
health, and my arm that had suffered in the fire grew worse.  My
children, however, sat by me, and while I was stretched on my straw
read to me by turns, or listened and wept at my instructions.  But my
daughter's health declined faster than mine.  Every message from her
contributed to increase my apprehensions and pain.  The fifth morning
after I had written the letter which was sent to Sir William Thornhill, I
was alarmed with an account that she was speechless.  Now it was that
confinement was truly painful to me.  My soul was bursting from its
prison to be near the pillow of my

<pb n="232"/> child to comfort, to strengthen her, to receive her last
wishes, and teach her soul the way to Heaven! Another account came.
She was expiring, and yet I was      debarred the small
comfort of weeping by her.  My fellow-prisoner some time after came
with the last account.  He bade me be patient.  She was dead!-The next
morning he returned, and found me with my two

<pb n="233"/> little ones, now my only companions, who were using
all their innocent efforts to comfort me.  They entreated to read to me,
and bade me not cry, for I was now too old to weep.  "And is not my
sister an angel now, papa?" cried the eldest, "and why, then, are you
sorry for her? I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place, if my
papa were with me."-"Yes," added my youngest darling, "Heaven,
where my sister is, is a finer place than this, and there are none but good
people there, and the people here are very bad."</p>
<p>Mr. Jenkinson interrupted their harmless prattle by observing that,
now my daughter was no more, I should seriously think of the rest of my
family, and attempt to save my own life, which was every day declining
for want of necessaries and wholesome air.  He added that it was not
incumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own to the
welfare of those who depended on me for support; and that I was now,
both by reason and justice, obliged to try to reconcile my
landlord.</p>
<p>"Heaven be praised," replied I, "there is no pride left me now.  I
should detest my own heart, if I saw either pride or resentment lurking
there.  On the contrary, as my oppressor has been once my
parishioner, I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the
eternal tribunal.  No, sir, I have no resentment now, and though he has
taken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures, though he has
wrung my heart,

<pb n="234"/> for I am sick almost to fainting, very sick, my fellow
prisoner, yet that shall never inspire me with vengeance.  I am now
willing to approve his marriage, and if this submission can do him any
pleasure, let him know that if I have done him any injury I am sorry for
it."</p>
<p>Mr. Jenkinson took pen and ink, and wrote down my submission
nearly as I have expressed it, to which I signed my name.  My son was
employed to carry the letter to Mr. Thornhill, who was then at his seat
in the country.  He went, and in about six hours returned with a verbal
answer.  He had some difficulty, he said, to get a sight of his landlord,
as the servants were insolent and suspicious; but he accidentally saw
him as he was going out upon business, preparing for his marriage,
which was to be in three days.  He continued to inform us, that he
stepped up in the humblest manner and delivered the letter, which, when
Mr. Thornhill had read, he said that all submission was now too late and
unnecessary; that he had heard of our application to his uncle, which met
with the contempt it deserved; and as for the rest, that all future
applications should be directed to his attorney, not to him.  He observed,
however, that as he had a very good opinion of the discretion of the two
young ladies, they might have been the most agreeable
intercessors.</p>
<p>"Well, sir," said I to my fellow-prisoner, "you now discover the
temper of the man that oppresses me.  He can at once be facetious and
cruel; but let him use

<pb n="235"/> me as he will, I shall soon be free, in spite of all his
bolts to restrain me.  I am now drawing towards an abode that looks
brighter as I approach it; this expectation cheers my afflictions, and
though I leave a helpless family of orphans behind me, yet they will
not be utterly forsaken; some friends, perhaps, will be found to assist
them for the sake of their poor father, and some may charitably relieve
them for the sake of their Heavenly Father."</p>
<p>just as I spoke, my wife, whom I had not seen that day before,
appeared with looks of terror, and making efforts, but unable to speak.
"Why, my love," cried I, it why will you thus increase my afflictions by
your own! What though no submission can turn our severe master,
though he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedness, and
though we have lost a darling child, yet still you will find comfort in
your other children when I shall be no more."-"We have, indeed, lost,"
returned she, "a darling child.  My Sophia, my dearest, is gone,
snatched from us, carried off by ruffians!"</p>
<p>"How, madam!" cried my fellow-prisoner, "Miss Sophia carried
off by villains! Sure it cannot be!"</p>
<p>She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears.  But
one of the prisoners' wives, who was present and came in with her, gave
us a more distinct account.  She informed us that as my wife, my daugh
ter, and herself, were taking a walk together on the

<pb n="236"/> great road a little way out of the village, a post-chaise
and pair drove up to them and instantly stopped.  Upon which, a
well-dressed man, but not Mr. Thornhill, stepping out, clasped my
daughter round the waist, and forcing her in, bid the postilion drive on,
so that they were out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>"Now," cried I, "the sum of my miseries is made up; nor is it in
the power of any thing on earth to give me another pang.  What! not one
left! not to leave me one! the monster! the child that was next my heart!
she had the beauty of an angel, and almost the wisdom of an angel! But
support that woman, nor let her fall.  Not to leave me one!"</p>
<p>"Alas! my husband," said my wife, "you seem to want comfort
even more than I. Our distresses are great; but I could bear this and
more, if I saw you but easy.  They may take away my children, and all
the world, if they leave me but you."</p>
<p>My son, who was present, endeavored to moderate our grief; he
bade us take comfort, for he hoped that we might still have reason to be
thankful.-"My child," cried I, "look round the world, and see if there be
any happiness left me now.  Is not every ray of comfort shut out; while
all our bright prospects only lie beyond the grave?-"My dear father,"
returned he, "I hope there is still something that will give you an interval
of satisfaction; for I have a letter from my brother George."-"What of
him, child?" interrupted I. "Does

<pb n="237"/> he know of our misery? I hope my boy is exempt from
any part of what his wretched family suffers!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," returned he, "he is perfectly gay, cheerful and happy.
His letter brings nothing but good news; he is the favorite of his colonel,
who promises to procure him the very next lieutenancy that becomes
vacant!"</p>
<p>"And are you sure of all this?" cried my wife; "are you sure that
nothing ill has befallen my boy?""Nothing, indeed, madam," returned
my son; "you shall see the letter, which will give you the highest
pleasure; and if any thing can procure you comfort, I am sure that
will."-"But are you sure," still repeated she, "that the letter is from
himself, and that he is really so happy?"-"Yes, madam," replied he, "it
is certainly his, and he will one day be the credit and support of our
family!"-"Then I thank Providence," cried she, "that my last letter to
him has miscarried.  Yes, my dear," continued she, turning to me, "I
will now confess that, though the hand of Heaven is sore upon us in
other instances, it has been favorable here.  By the last letter I wrote my
son, which was in the bitterest of anger, I desired him, upon his
mother's blessing, and if he had the heart of a man, to see justice done
to his father and sister, and avenge our cause.  But thanks be to Him that
directs all things, it has miscarried, and I am at rest!" -"Woman," cried
I, "thou hast done very ill, and at another time my

<pb n="238"/> reproaches might have been more severe.  Oh! what a
tremendous gulf hast thou escaped, that would have buried both thee and
him in endless ruin.  Providence, indeed, has here been kinder to us than
we to ourselves! It has reserved that son to be the father and protector
of my children when I shall be away.  How unjustly did I complain of
being stripped of every comfort, when still I hear that he is happy, and
insensible of our afflictions; still kept in reserve to support his
widowed mother, and to protect his brothers and sisters! But what sisters
has he left? He has no sisters now, they are all gone, robbed from me,
and I am undone!"-"Father," interrupted my son, "I beg you will give
me leave to read his letter; I know it will please you." Upon which, with
my permission, he read as follows: </p>
<p>"HONORED SIR:-I have called off my imagination a few
moments from the pleasures that surround me, to fix it upon objects that
are still more pleasing, the dear little fireside at home.  My fancy draws
that harmless group as listening to every line of this with great com
posure.  I view those faces with delight which never felt the deforming
hand of ambition or distress! But whatever your happiness may be at
home, I am sure it will be some addition to it to hear that I am perfectly
pleased with my situation, and every way happy here.</p>
<p>"Our regiment is countermanded, and is not to leave

<pb n="239"/> the kingdom; the colonel, who professes himself my
friend, takes me with him to all companies where he is acquainted, and
after my first visit I generally find myself received with increased respect
upon repeating it. I danced last night with Lady G-, and could I forget
you know whom, I might be, perhaps, successful.  But it is my fate still
to remember others, while I am myself forgotten by most of my absent
friends, and in this number I fear, sir, that I must consider you; for I
have long expected the pleasure of a letter from home to no purpose.
Olivia and Sophia, too, promised to write, but seem to have forgotten
me.  Tell them they are two arrant little baggages, and that I am this
moment in a most violent passion with them; yet still, I know not how,
though I want to bluster a little, my heart is respondent only to softer
emotions.  Then, tell them, sir, that, after all, I love them affection
ately, and be assured of my ever remaining</p>
<p>"Your dutiful son." </p>
<p>"In all our miseries," cried I, "what thanks have we not to return
that one at least of our family is exempted from what we suffer! Heaven
be his guard and keep my boy thus happy to be the supporter of his
widowed mother, and the father of these two babes, which is all the
patrimony I can now bequeath him.  May he keep their innocence from
the temptations of want, and be their conductor in the paths of honor!" I
had

<pb n="240"/> scarcely said these words when a noise like that of
tumult seemed to proceed from the prison below; it died away soon
after; and a clanking of fetters was heard along the passage that led to
my apartment.  The keeper of the prison entered, holding a man all
bloody, wounded, and fettered with the heaviest irons.  I looked with
compassion on the wretch as he approached me, but with horror when I
found it was my own son.  "My George! my George! and do I behold
thee thus? Wounded! fettered! Is this thy happiness? Is this the manner
you return to me? Oh that this sight could break my heart at once, and
let me die!"</p>
<p>"Where, sir, is your fortitude?" returned my son, with intrepid
voice.  "I must suffer; my life is forfeited, and let them take it."</p>
<p>I tried to restrain my passions for a few minutes in silence, but I
thought I should have died with the effort.  "Oh, my boy, my heart
weeps to behold thee thus, and I cannot, cannot help it! In the moment
that I thought thee blessed, and prayed for thy safety, to behold thee thus
again!-chained, wounded! And yet the death of the youthful is happy.
But I am old, a very old man, and have lived to see this day.  To see my
children all untimely falling about me, while I continue a wretched
survivor in the midst of ruin! May all the curses that ever sunk a soul
fall heavy upon the murderer of my children! May he live, like me, to
see-"</p>

<pb n="241"/>
<p>"Hold, sir!" replied my son, "or I shall blush for thee.  How, sir!
forgetful of your age, your holy calling, thus to arrogate the justice of
Heaven, and fling those curses upward that must soon descend to crush
thy own grey head with destruction! No, sir, let it be your care now to
fit me for that vile death I must shortly suffer, to arm me with hope and
resolution, to give me courage to drink of that bitterness which must
shortly be my portion!"</p>
<p>"My child, you must not die! I am sure no offence of thine can
deserve so vile a punishment.  My George could never be guilty of a
crime to make his ancestors ashamed of him."</p>
<p>"Mine, sir," returned my son, "is, I fear, an unpardonable one.
When I received my mother's letter from home, I immediately came
down, determined to punish the betrayer of our honor, and sent him an
order to meet me, which he answered not in person, but by dispatching
four of his domestics to seize me.  I wounded one who first assaulted
me, and I fear desperately; but the rest made me their prisoner.  The
coward is determined to put the law in execution against me; the proofs
are undeniable; I have sent a challenge; and as I am the first transgressor
upon the statute, I see no hopes of pardon.  But you have often charmed
me with your lessons of fortitude; let me now, sir, find them in your
example."</p>
<p>"And, my son, you shall find them.  I am now

<pb n="242"/> raised above this world and all the pleasures it can
produce.  From this moment I break from my heart all the ties that held
it down to earth, and will prepare to fit us both for eternity.  Yes, my
son, I will point out the way, and my soul shall guide yours in the
ascent, for we will take our flight together.  I now see and am convinced
you can expect no pardon here, and I can only exhort you to seek it at
that greatest tribunal where we both shall shortly answer.  But let us not
be niggardly in our exhortation, but let all our fellow-prisoners have a
share.  Good gaoler, let them be permitted to stand here while I attempt
to improve them." Thus saying, I made an effort to rise from my straw,
but wanted strength, and was able only to recline against the wall.  The
prisoners assembled themselves according to my directions, for they
loved to hear my counsel; my son and his mother supported me on either
side; I looked and saw that none were wanting, and then addressed them
with the following exhortation.</p>

</div1>
<div1 type="chapter" n="29" id="d34"><pb n="243"/>
<head>The Equal Dealings of Providence Demonstrated with Regard
to the Happy and the Miserable Here Below-That from the Nature of
Pleasure and Pain, the Wretched Must Be Repaid the Balance of Their
Sufferings in the Life Hereafter, </head>
<p>"My friends, my children, and fellow-sufferers, when I reflect on
the distribution of good and evil here below, I find that much has been
given man to enjoy, yet still more to suffer.  Though we should examine
the whole world, we shall not find one man so happy as to have nothing
left to wish for; but we daily see thousands who by suicide show us they
have nothing left to hope.  In this life, then, it appears that we cannot be
entirely blessed; but yet we may be completely 'miserable.</p>
<p>"Why man should thus feel pain, why our wretchedness should
be requisite in the formation of universal felicity; why, when all other
systems are made perfect by the perfection of their subordinate parts, the
great system should require for its perfection parts that are not only
subordinate to others, but imperfect in themselves; these are questions
that never can be explained, and might be useless if known.  On this
subject

<pb n="244"/> Providence has thought fit to elude our curiosity, satis
fied with granting us motives to consolation.</p>
<p>"In this situation, man has called in the friendly assistance of
philosophy; and Heaven, seeing the incapacity of that to console him,
has given him the aid of religion.  The consolations of philosophy are
very amusing, but often fallacious.  It tells us that life is filled with
comforts if we will but enjoy them; and, on the other hand, though we
unavoidably have miseries here, life is short, and they will soon be over.
Thus do these consolations destroy each other; for if life is a place of
comfort, its shortness must be misery; and if it be long, our griefs are
protracted.  Thus philosophy is weak; but religion comforts in a higher
strain.  Man is here, it tells us, fitting up his mind and preparing it for
another abode.  When the good man leaves the body, and is all a
glorious mind, he will find he has been making himself a heaven of
happiness here; while the wretch that has been maimed and contaminated
by his vices, shrinks from his body with terror, and finds that he has
anticipated the vengeance of Heaven.  To religion, then, we must hold,
in every circumstance of life, for our truest comfort; for if already we
are happy, it is a pleasure to think we can make that happiness
unending; and if we are miserable, it is very consoling to think that there
is a place of rest.  Thus to the fortunate, religion holds out a continuance
of bliss; to the wretched, a change from pain.</p>

<pb n="245"/>
<p>"But though religion is very kind to all men, it has promised
peculiar rewards to the unhappy; the sick, the naked, the houseless, the
heavy-laden, and the prisoner, have ever most frequent promises in our
sacred law.  The Author of our religion everywhere professes himself
the wretch's friend, and, unlike the false ones of this world, bestows all
his caresses upon the forlorn.  The unthinking have censured this as
partiality, as a preference without merit to deserve it.  But they never
reflect that it is not in the power even of Heaven itself to make the offer
of unceasing felicity as great a gift to the happy as to the miserable.  To
the first, eternity is but a single blessing, since, at most, it but increases
what they already possess.  To the latter, it is a double advantage; for it
diminishes their pain here, and rewards them with heavenly bliss
hereafter.</p>
<p>"But Providence is in another respect kinder to the poor than the
rich; for as it thus makes the life after death more desirable, so it
smooths the passage there.  The wretched have had a long familiarity
with every face of terror.  The man of sorrows lays himself quietly
down, without possessions to regret, and but few ties to stop his
departure; he feels only nature's pang in the final separation, and this in
no way greater than he has often fainted under before; for, after a certain
degree of pain, every new breach that death

<pb n="246"/> opens in the constitution, nature kindly covers with
insensibility.</p>
<p>"Thus Providence has given the wretched two advantages over
the happy in this life: greater felicity in dying, and in Heaven all that
superiority of pleasure which arises from contrasted enjoyment.  And
this superiority, my friends, is no small advantage, and seems to be one
of the pleasures of the poor man in the parable; for though he was
already in heaven, and felt all the raptures it could give, yet it was
mentioned as an addition to his happiness, that he once had been
wretched, and now was comforted; that he had known what it was to be
miserable, and now felt what it was to be happy.</p>
<p>"Thus, my friends, you see religion does what philosophy could
never do; it shows the equal dealings of Heaven to the happy and the
unhappy, and levels all human enjoyments to nearly the same standard.
It gives to both rich and poor the same happiness hereafter, and equal
hopes to aspire after it; but if the rich have the advantage of enjoying
pleasure here, the poor have the endless satisfaction of knowing what it
was once to be miserable, when crowned with endless felicity
hereafter; and even though this should be called a small advantage, yet
being an eternal one, it must make up by duration what the temporal
happiness of the great may have exceeded by intenseness.</p>
<p>"These are, therefore, the consolations which the

<pb n="247"/> wretched have peculiar to themselves, and in which
they are above the rest of mankind; in other respects they are below
them.  They who would know the miseries of the poor, must see life and
endure it.  To declaim on the temporal advantages they enjoy, is only
repeating what none other either believe or practice.  The men who have
the necessaries of living are not poor, and they who want them must be
miserable.  Yes, my friends, we must be miserable.  No vain efforts of a
refined imagination can soothe the wants of nature, can give elastic
sweetness to the dank vapor of a dungeon, or ease to the throbbings of a
broken heart! Let the philosopher from his couch of softness tell us that
we can resist all these.  Alas! the effort by which we resist them is still
the greatest pain.</p>
<p>"Death is slight, and any man may sustain it; but torments are
dreadful, and these no man can endure.</p>
<p>"To us, then, my friends, the promises of happiness in Heaven
should be particularly dear; for if our reward be in this life alone, we
are then indeed, of all men the most miserable.  When I look round
these gloomy walls, made to terrify, as well as to confine us; this light
that only serves to show the horrors of the place, those shackles that
tyranny has imposed, or crime made necessary; when I survey these
emaciated looks, and hear those groans, oh, my friends, what a glorious
exchange would heaven be for these! To fly through regions unconfined
as air, to bask in the sunshine of

<pb n="248"/> eternal bliss, to carol over endless hymns of praise, to
have no master to threaten or insult us, but the form of Goodness
himself forever in our eyes; when I think of these things, Death becomes
the messenger of very glad tidings; when I think of these things, his
sharpest arrows become the staff of my support; when I think of these
things, what is there in life worth having? when I think of these things,
what is there that should not be spurned away? Kings in their palaces
should groan for such advantages; but we, humbled as we are, should
yearn for them.</p>
<p>"And shall these things be ours? Ours they will certainly be if we
but try for them; and, what is a comfort, we are shut out from many
temptations that would retard our pursuit.  Only let us try for them and
they will certainly be ours, and, what is still a comfort, shortly too; for
if we look back on a past life it appears but a very short span, and
whatever we may think of the rest of life, it will yet be found of less
duration; as we grow older the days seem to grow shorter, and our
intimacy with Time ever lessens the perception of his stay.  Then let us
take comfort now, for we shall soon be at our journey's end; we shall
soon lay down the heavy burthen laid by Heaven upon us; and though
Death, the only friend of the wretched, for a little while mocks the
weary traveller with the view, and like his horizon still flies before him,
yet the time will certainly and shortly come when

<pb n="249"/> we shall cease from our toil; when the luxuriant  great
ones of the world shall no more tread us to the earth; when we shall
think with pleasure of our sufferings below; when we shall be
surrounded with all our friends, or such as deserved our friendship;
when our bliss shall be unutterable, and still, to crown all,
unending."</p>

<head>Happier Prospects Begin to Appear-Let Us Be Inflexible and
Fortune Will at Last Change in Our Favor </head>
<p>WHEN I had thus finished, and my audience was retired the
gaoler, who was one of the most humane of his profession. hoped I
would not be displeased, as what he did was but his duty, observing that
he must be obliged to remove my son into a stronger cell, but that he
should be permitted to revisit me every morning.  I thanked him for his
clemency, and grasping my boy's hand bade him farewell, and be
mindful of the great duty that was before him.</p>
<p>I again, therefore, laid me down, and one of my little ones sat by
my bedside reading, when Mr. Jenkinson entering, informed me that
there was news of my daughter; for that she was seen by a person about
two hours before in a strange gentleman's company, and that they had
stopped at a neighboring village for refreshments, and seemed as if
returning to town.  He had scarcely delivered this news when the gaoler
came with looks of haste and pleasure to inform me that my daughter
was found.  Moses came running in

<pb n="251"/> a moment after, crying out that his sister was below,
and coming up with our old friend Mr. Burchell.</p>
<p>Just as he delivered this news my dearest girl entered, and with
looks almost wild with pleasure, ran to kiss me in a transport of
affection.  Her mother's tears and silence also showed her pleasure.
"Here, papa," cried the charming girl, "Here is the brave man to whom
I owe my delivery; to this gentleman's intrepidity I am indebted for my
happiness and safety." A kiss from Mr. Burchell, whose pleasure seemed
even greater than hers, interrupted what she was going to add.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Burchell," cried I, "this is but a wretched habitation you
now find us in; and we are now very different from what you last saw
us.  You were ever our friend; we have long discovered our errors with
regard to you, and repented of our ingratitude.  After the vile usage you
then received at my hands, I am almost ashamed to behold your face; yet
I hope you'll forgive me, as I was deceived by a base, ungenerous
wretch, who, under the mask of friendship, has undone me.  "</p>
<p>"It is impossible," replied Mr. Burchell, "that I should forgive
you, as you never deserved my resentment.  I partly saw your delusion
then, and as it was out of my power to restrain, I could only pity
it."</p>
<p>"It was ever my conjecture," cried I, "that your mind was noble;
but now I find it so.  But tell me,

<pb n="252"/> my dear child, how hast thou been relieved, or who the
ruffians were who carried thee away?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "as to the villain who carried me off I
am yet ignorant.  For as my mamma and I were walking out, he came
behind us and almost before I could call for help, forced me into the
postchaise, and in an instant the horses drove away.  I met several on
the road, to whom I cried out for assistance, but they disregarded my
entreaties.  In the meantime, the ruffian himself used every art to hinder
me from crying out: he flattered and threatened by turns, and swore that
if I continued but silent he intended no harm.  In the meantime, I had
broken the canvas that he had drawn up, and whom should I perceive at
some distance but your old friend Mr. Burchell, walking along with his
usual swiftness, with the great stick for which we used so much to
ridicule him.  As soon as we came within hearing, I called out to him by
name and entreated his help.  I repeated my exclamation several times,
upon which, with a very loud voice, he bid the postilion stop; but the
boy took no notice, but drove on with still greater speed.  I now thought
he could never overtake us, when in less than a minute I saw Mr.
Burchell come running up by the side of the horses, and with one blow
knock the postilion to the ground.  The horses, when he was fallen, soon
stopped of themselves and the ruffian stepping out with oaths and
menaces drew his sword and ordered him at his

<pb n="253"/> peril to retire; but Mr. Burchell, running up, shivered
his sword to pieces, and then pursued him for near a quarter of a mile;
but he made his escape.  I was at this time come out myself, willing to
assist my deliverer; but he soon returned to me in triumph.  The
postilion, who was recovered, was going to make his escape too; but
Mr. Burchell ordered him at his peril to mount again and drive back to
town.  Finding it impossible to resist, he reluctantly complied, though
the wound he had received seemed to me at least to be dangerous.  He
continued to complain of the pain as we drove along, so that he at last
excited Mr. Burchell's compassion, who at my request exchanged him
for another at an inn where we called on our return."</p>
<p>"Welcome, then," cried I, "my child, and thou, her gallant
deliverer, a thousand welcomes! Though our cheer is but wretched, yet
our hearts are ready to receive you.  And now, Mr. Burchell, as you
have delivered my girl, if you think her a recompense she is yours; if
you can stoop to an alliance with a family so poor as mine, take her,
obtain her consent, as I know you have her heart, and you have mine.
And let me tell you, sir, that I give you no small treasure; she has been
celebrated for beauty, it is true, but that is not my meaning: I give you
up a treasure in her mind."</p>
<p>"But I suppose, sir," cried Mr. Burchell, "that you are apprized of
my circumstances, and of my incapacity to support her as she
deserves?"</p>

<pb n="254"/>
<p>"If your present objection," replied I, "be meant as an evasion of
my offer, I desist; but I know no man so worthy to deserve her as you;
and if I could give her thousands, and thousands sought her from me, yet
my honest, brave Burchell should be my dearest choice.  "</p>
<p>To all this his silence alone seemed to give a mortifying refusal,
and, without the least reply to my offer, he demanded if we could not be
furnished with refreshments from the next inn; to which being
answered in the affirmative, he ordered them to send in the best dinner
that could be provided upon such short notice.  He bespoke also a dozen
of their best wine, and some cordials for me; adding, with a smile, that
he would stretch a little for once, and though in a prison, asserted he
was never better disposed to be merry.  The waiter soon made his
appearance with preparations for dinner, a table was lent us by the
gaoler, who seemed remarkably assiduous, the wine was disposed in
order, and two very well-dressed dishes were brought in.</p>
<p>My daughter had not yet heard of her poor brother's melancholy
situation, and we all seemed unwilling to damp her cheerfulness by the
relation.  But it was in vain that I attempted to appear cheerful; the cir
cumstances of my unfortunate son broke through all efforts to dissemble;
so that I was at last obliged to damp our mirth by relating his
misfortunes, and wishing that he might be permitted to share with us in

<pb n="255"/> this little interval of satisfaction.  After my guests were
recovered from the consternation my account had produced, I requested
also that Mr. Jenkinson, a fellowprisoner, might be admitted, and the
gaoler granted my request with an air of unusual submission.  The
clanking of my son's irons was no sooner heard along the passage, than
his sister ran impatiently to meet him; while Mr. Burchell, in the
meantime, asked me if my son's name were George; to which replying
in the affirmative, he still continued silent.  As soon as my boy entered
the room, I could perceive he regarded Mr. Burchell with a look of
astonishment and reverence.</p>
<p>"Come on," cried I, "my son, though we are fallen very low, yet
Providence has been pleased to grant us some small relaxation from
pain.  Thy sister is restored to us, and there is her deliverer; to that
brave man it is that I am indebted for yet having a daughter; give him,
my boy, the hand of friendship; he deserves our warmest
gratitude."</p>
<p>My son seemed all this while regardless of what I said, and still
continued fixed at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>"My dear brother," cried his sister, "why don't you thank my good
deliverer? The brave should ever love each other."</p>
<p>He still continued his silence and astonishment, till our guest at last
perceived himself to be known, and assuming all his native dignity,
desired my son to come forward.  Never before bad I seen any thing so
truly

<pb n="256"/> majestic as the air he assumed upon this occasion.  The
greatest object in the universe, says a certain philoso
    pher, is a good man struggling with adversity; yet
there is still a greater, which is the good man that comes to relieve it.
After he had regarded my son for

<pb n="257"/> some time with a superior air, "I again find," said he,
"unthinking boy, that the same crime"  But here he was interrupted by
one of the gaoler's servants, who came to inform us that a person of
distinction, who had driven into town with a chariot and several
attendants, sent his respects to the gentleman that was with us, and
begged to know when he should think proper to be waited upon.-"Bid the
fellow wait," cried our guest, "till I shall have leisure to receive him;"
and then turning to my son, "I again find, sir," proceeded he, "that you
are guilty of the same offence for which you once had my reproof, and
for which the law is now preparing its justest punishments.  You
imagine, perhaps, that a contempt for your own life gives you a right to
take that of another; but where, sir, is the difference between a duellist
who hazards a life of no value, and the murderer who acts with greater
security? Is it any diminution of the gamester's fraud when he alleges
that he has staked a counter?"</p>
<p>"Alas, sir," cried I, "whoever you are, pity the poor misguided
creature; for what he has done was in obedience to a deluded mother,
who in the bitterness of her resentment required him upon her blessing to
avenge her quarrel! Here, sir, is the letter, which will serve to convince
you of her imprudence and diminish his guilt."</p>
<p>He took the letter and hastily read it over.  "This,"

<pb n="258"/> says he, "though not a perfect excuse, is such a pallia
tion of his fault, as induces me to forgive him.  And now, sir,"
continued he, kindly taking my son by the hand, "I see you are surprised
at finding me here; but I have often visited prisons upon occasions less
interesting.  I am now come to see justice done a worthy man, for whom
I have the most sincere esteem.  I have long been a disguised spectator
of thy father's benevolence.  I have at his little dwelling enjoyed
respect uncontaminated by flattery, and have received that happiness
that courts could not give, from the amusing simplicity round his
fireside.  My nephew has been apprized of my intentions of coming
here, and I find is arrived; it would be wronging him and you to
condemn him without examination.  If there be injury there shall be
redress; and this I may say without boasting, that none have ever taxed
the injustice of Sir William Thornhill."</p>
<p>We now found the personage whom we had so long entertained as
a harmless, amusing companion, was no other than the celebrated Sir
William Thornhill, to whose virtues and singularities scarcely any were
strangers.  The poor Mr. Burchell was in reality a man of a large fortune
and great interest, to whom senates listened with applause, and whom
party heard with conviction; who was the friend of his country, but loyal
to his king.  My poor wife, recollecting her former familiarity, seemed
to shrink with apprehension; but

<pb n="259"/> Sophia, who a few moments before thought him her
own, now perceiving the immense distance to which he was removed by
fortune, was unable to conceal her tears.</p>
<p>"Ah, sir," cried my wife, with a piteous aspect, "how is it possible
that I can ever have your forgiveness! The slights you received from
me the last time I had the honor of seeing you at our house, and the
jokes which I audaciously threw out, these jokes, sir, I fear can never be
forgiven."</p>
<p>"My dear good lady," returned he with a smile, "if you had your
joke, I had my answer; I'll leave it to all the company if mine were not
as good as yours.  To say the truth, I know nobody whom I am disposed
to be angry with at present, but the fellow who so frightened my little
girl here.  I had not even time to examine the rascal's person so as to
describe him in an advertisement.  Can you tell me, Sophia, my dear,
whether you should know him again?"</p>
<p>"Indeed, sir," replied she, "I can't be positive; yet now I recollect
he had a large mark over one of his eyebrows."-"I ask pardon, madam,"
interrupted Jenkinson, who was by, "but be so good as to inform me if
the fellow wore his own red hair!"-"Yes, I think so," cried Sophia.-"And
did your honor," continued he, turning to Sir William, "observe the
length of his legs?"-"I can't be sure of their length," cried the baronet,
"but I am convinced of their swiftness;

<pb n="260"/> for he outran me, which is what I thought few men in
the kingdom could have done."-"Please your honor," cried Jenkinson, "I
know the man; it is certainly the same; the best runner in England: he
has beaten Pinwire, of Newcastle; Timothy Baxter is his name.  I know
him perfectly, and the very place of his retreat this moment.  If your
honor will bid Mr. Gaoler let two of his men go with me, I'll engage to
produce him to you in an hour at the farthest." Upon this the gaoler was
called, who instantly appearing, Sir William demanded if he knew him.
"Yes, please your honor," replied the gaoler, "I know Sir William
Thornhill well, and everybody that knows any thing of him will desire to
know more of him."-"Well, then," said the baronet, "my request is, that
you will permit this man and two of your servants to go upon a message
by my authority, and as I am in the commission of the peace I
undertake to secure you.""Your promise is sufficient," replied the
other, "and you may at a minute's warning send them over England
whenever your honor thinks fit."</p>
<p>In pursuance of the gaoler's compliance, Jenkinson was despatched
in search of Timothy Baxter, while we were amused at the assiduity of
our youngest boy, Bill, who had just come in and climbed up Sir
William's neck in order to kiss him.  His mother was immediately going
to chastise his familiarity, but the worthy man prevented her; and taking
the child, all ragged as he

<pb n="261"/> was, upon his knee, "What, Bill, you chubby rogue,"
cried he, "do you remember your old friend Burchell? and Dick, too, my
honest veteran, are you here? you shall find I have not forgot you." So
saying, he gave each a large piece of gingerbread, which the poor fel
lows ate very heartily, as they had got that morning but a very scanty
breakfast.</p>
<p>We now sat down to dinner, which was almost cold; but
previously, my arm continuing painful, Sir William wrote a prescription,
for he had made the study of physic his amusement, and was more than
moderately skilled in the profession; this being sent to an apothecary
who lived in the place, my arm was dressed, and I found almost
instantaneous relief.  We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler
himself, who was willing to do our guest all the honor in his power.  But
before we had well dined, another message was brought from his
nephew, desiring permission to appear, in order to vindicate his
innocence and honor; with which request the baronet complied, and
desired Mr. Thornhill to be introduced.</p>

<head>Former Benevolence Now Repaid with Unexpected Interest.
</head>
<p>MR. THORNHILL made his appearance with a smile, which he
seldom wanted, and was going to embrace his uncle, which the other
repulsed with an air of disdain.  "No fawning, sir, at present," cried
the baronet, with a look of severity; "the only way to my heart is by the
road of honor; but here I only see complicated instances of falsehood,
cowardice, and oppression.  How is it, sir, that this poor man, for whom
I know you professed a friendship, is used thus hardly? His daughter
vilely seduced as a recompense for his hospitality, and he himself thrown
into prison, perhaps but for resenting the insult? His son, too, whom you
feared to face as a man-"</p>
<p>"Is it possible, sir," interrupted his nephew, "that my uncle could
object to that as a crime, which his repeated instructions alone have
persuaded me to avoid?"</p>
<p>"Your rebuke," cried Sir William, "is just; you have acted in this
instance prudently and well, though not quite as your father would have
done.  My brother,

<pb n="263"/> indeed, was the soul of honor; but thou-yes, you have
acted in this instance perfectly right, and it has my warmest
approbation."</p>
<p>"And I hope," said his nephew, "that the rest of my conduct will
not be found to deserve censure.  I appeared, sir, with this gentleman's
daughter at some places of public amusement; thus what was levity,
scandal called by a harsher name, and it was reported that I had
debauched her.  I waited on her father in person, willing to clear the
thing to his satisfaction, and he received me only with insult and abuse.
As for the rest, with regard to his being here, my attorney and steward
can best inform you, as I commit the management of business entirely
to them.  If he has contracted debts, and is unwilling or even unable to
pay them, it is their business to proceed in this manner; and I see no
hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress."</p>
<p>"If this," cried Sir William, "be as you have stated, there is
nothing unpardonable in your offence; and though your conduct might
have been more generous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed
by subordinate tyranny, yet it has been at least equitable."</p>
<p>"He cannot contradict a single particular," replied the 'Squire; "I
defy him to do so; and several of my servants are ready to attest what I
say.  Thus, sir," continued he, finding that I was silent, for in fact I
could not contradict him; "thus, sir, my own innocence

<pb n="264"/> is vindicated; but though at your entreaty I am ready to
forgive this gentleman every other offence, yet his attempts to lessen me
in your esteem excite a resentment that I cannot govern.  And this, too,
at a time when his son was actually preparing to take away my life; this,
I say, was such guilt, that I am determined to let the law take its course.
I have here the challenge that was sent me, and two witnesses to prove
it; one of my servants has been wounded dangerously; and even though
my uncle himself should dissuade me, which I know he will not, yet I
will see public justice done, and he shall suffer for it."</p>
<p>"Thou monster!" cried my wife, "hast thou not had vengeance
enough already, but must my poor boy feel thy cruelty? I hope that good
Sir William will protect us, for my son is as innocent as a child; I am
sure he is, and never did harm to man."</p>
<p>"Madam," replied the good man, "your wishes for his safety are
not greater than mine; but I am sorry to find his guilt too plain; and if
my nephew persists-" But the appearance of Jenkinson and the gaoler's
two servants now called off our attention, who entered, hauling in a tall
man very genteelly dressed, and answering the description already given
of the ruffian who had carried off my daughter.  "Here," cried
Jenkinson, pulling him in, "here we have him; and if ever there was a
candidate for Tyburn this is one!"</p>
<p>The moment Mr. Thornhill perceived the prisoner,

<pb n="265"/> and Jenkinson who had him in custody, he seemed to
shrink back with terror.  His face became pale with conscious guilt, and
he would have withdrawn; but Jenkinson, who perceived his design,
stopped him.  "What, 'Squire," cried he, "are you ashamed of your two
old acquaintances, Jenkinson and Baxter? But this is the way that all
great men forget their friends, though I am resolved we will not forget
you.  Our prisoner, please your honor," continued he, turning to Sir
William, "has already confessed all.  This is the gentleman reported to
be so dangerously wounded; he declares that it was Mr. Thornhill who
first put him upon this affair; that he gave him the clothes he now wears,
to appear like a gentleman, and furnished him with the post-chaise.
The plan was laid between them, that he should carry off the young lady
to a place of safety, and that there he should threaten and terrify her; but
Mr. Thornhill was to come in the meantime, as if by accident, to her
rescue, and that they should fight awhile, and then he was to run off, by
which means Mr. Thornhill would have the better opportunity of gaining
her affections himself under the character of her defender."</p>
<p>Sir William remembered the coat to have been worn by his
nephew, and all the rest the prisoner himself confirmed by a more
circumstantial account, concluding that Mr. Thornhill had often declared
to him that he was in love with both sisters at the same time.</p>

<pb n="266"/>
<p>"Heavens!" cried Sir William, "what a viper have I been fostering
in my bosom! And so fond of public justice, too, as he seemed to be!
But he shall have it.  Secure him, Mr. Gaoler-yet hold, I fear there is
not legal evidence to detain him."</p>
<p>Upon this, Mr. Thornhill, with the utmost humility, entreated that
two such abandoned wretches might not be admitted as evidence against
him, but that his servants should be examined.-"Your servants!" replied
Sir William; "call them yours no longer; but, come, let us hear what
those fellows have to say; let his butler be called."</p>
<p>When the butler was introduced, he soon perceived by his former
master's looks that all his power was now over.  "Tell me," cried Sir
William, sternly, "have you ever seen your master and that fellow
dressed up in his clothes in company together?"-"Yes, please your
honor," cried the butler, "a thousand times; he was the man that always
brought him his ladies.""How," interrupted young Mr. Thornhill, "this
to my face!"-"Yes," replied the butler, "or to any man's face.  To tell
you a truth, Master Thornhill, I never either loved you or liked you, and
I don't care if I tell you now a piece of my mind."-Now, then," cried
Jenkinson, "tell his honor whether you know any thing of me."-"I can't
say," replied the butler, "that I know much good of you.  The night that
gentleman's daughter was deluded to our house you were one of them."

<pb n="267"/> -"So, then," cried Sir William, "I find you have
brought a very fine witness to prove your innocence; thou stain to
humanity! to associate with such wretches! But" (continuing his
examination) "you tell me, Mr. Butler, that this was the person who
brought him this old gentleman's daughter."-"No, please your honor,"
replied the butler, "he did not bring her, for the 'Squire himself
undertook that business; but he brought the priest that pretended to
marry them.""It is but too true," cried Jenkinson, "I can't deny it; that
was the employment assigned me, and I confess it to my
confusion."</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed the baronet, "how every new
discovery of his villainy alarms me! All his guilt is now too plain, and I
find his prosecution was dictated by tyranny, cowardice, and revenge.
At my request, Mr. Gaoler, set this young officer, now your prisoner,
free, and trust to me for the consequences.  I'll make it my business to
set the affair in a proper light to my friend the magistrate who has
committed him.  But where is the unfortunate lady herself? Let her
appear to confront this wretch! I long to know by what arts he has
seduced her.  Entreat her to come in.  Where is she?"</p>
<p>"Ah, sir," said I, "that question stings me to the heart; I was once,
indeed, happy in a daughter, but her miseries-" Another interruption here
prevented me: for who should make her appearance but Miss

<pb n="268"/> Arabella Wilmot, who was next day to have been
married to Mr. Thornhill.  Nothing could equal her
surprise at seeing Sir William and his nephew here before her; for her
arrival was quite accidental.  It happened that she and the old
gentleman, her father, were passing through the town on their way to her
aunt's,

<pb n="269"/> who had insisted that her nuptials with Mr. Thornhill
should be consummated at her house; but stopping for refreshment, they
put up at an inn at the other end of the town.  It was there f rom the
window that the young lady happened to observe one of my little boys
playing in the street, and instantly sending a footman to bring the child
to her, she learned f rom him some account of our misfortunes; but was
still kept ignorant of young Mr. Thornhill's being the cause.  Though her
father made several remonstrances on the impropriety of her going to a
prison to visit us, yet they were ineffectual.  She desired the child to
conduct her, which he did, and it was thus that she surprised us at a
junction so unexpected.</p>
<p>Nor can I go on, without a reflection upon those accidental
meetings, which, though they happen every day, seldom excite our
surprise but upon some extraordinary occasion.  To what a fortuitous
occurrence do we not owe every pleasure and convenience of our lives.
How many seeming accidents must unite before we can be clothed or
fed.  The peasant must be disposed to labor, the shower must fall, the
wind fill the merchant's sail, or numbers must want the usual
supply.</p>
<p>We all continued silent for some moments, while my charming
pupil, which was the name I generally gave this young lady, united in
her looks compassion and astonishment, which gave new finishings to
her beauty.  "Indeed, my dear Mr. Thornhill," cried she

<pb n="270"/> to the 'Squire, who, she supposed, was come here to
succor and not to oppress us, "I take it a little unkindly that you should
come here without me, or never inform me of the situation of a family
so dear to us both.  You know I should take as much pleasure in
contributing to the relief of my reverend old master here, whom I shall
ever esteem, as you can.  But I find that, like your uncle, you take a
pleasure in doing good in secret."</p>
<p>"He find pleasure in doing good!" cried Sir William, interrupting
her.  "No, my dear, his pleasures are as base as he is.  You see in him,
madam, as complete a villain as ever disgraced humanity.  A wretch
who after having deluded this poor man's daughter, after plotting against
the innocence of her sister, has thrown the father into prison, and the
eldest son into fetters, because he had the courage to face her betrayer.
And give me leave, madam, now to congratulate you upon an escape
from the embraces of such a monster."</p>
<p>"O goodness!" cried the lovely girl, "how have I been deceived!
Mr. Thornhill informed me for certain that this gentleman's eldest son
Captain Primrose, had gone off to America with his new-married
lady."</p>
<p>"My sweetest miss," cried my wife, "he has told you nothing but
falsehoods.  My son George never left the kingdom, nor ever was
married.  Though you have forsaken him, he has always loved you too
well to think of anybody else; and I have heard him say

<pb n="271"/> he would die a bachelor for your sake." She then
proceeded to expatiate upon the sincerity of her son's passion; she set his
duel with Mr. Thornhill in its proper light; from thence she made a rapid
digression to the 'Squire's debaucheries, his pretended marriages, and
ended with a most insulting picture of his cowardice.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" cried Miss Wilmot, "how very near have I been
to the brink of ruin! But how great is my pleasure to have escaped it!
Ten thousand falsehoods has this gentleman told me! He had at last art
enough to persuade me that my promise to the only man I esteemed was
no longer binding, since he had been unfaithful.  By his falsehood I was
taught to detest one equally brave and generous!"</p>
<p>But by this time my son was freed from the incumbrances of
justice, as the person supposed to be wounded was detected to be an
impostor.  Mr. Jenkinson also, who had acted as his valet de chambre,
had dressed up his hair and furnished him with whatever was necessary
to make a genteel appearance.  He now, therefore, entered, handsomely
dressed in his regimentals; and without vanity (for I am above it), he
appeared as handsome a fellow as ever wore a military dress.  As he
entered, he made Miss Wilmot a modest and distant bow, f or he was
not as yet acquainted with the change which the eloquence of his mother
had wrought in his favor.  But no decorums could

<pb n="272"/> restrain the impatience of his blushing mistress to be
forgiven.  Her tears, her looks, all contributed to discover the real
sensations of her heart, for having forgotten her former promise, and
having suffered herself to be deluded by an impostor.  My son appeared
amazed at her condescension, and could scarcely believe it real.  "Sure,
madam," cried he, "this is but delusion! I can never have merited this!
To be blessed thus is to be too happy.""No, sir," replied she, "I have
been deceived, basely deceived, else nothing could ever have made me
unjust to my promise.  You know my friendship, you have long known
it; but forget what I have done, and as you once had my warmest vows
of constancy, you shall now have them repeated; and be assured that if
Arabella cannot be yours, she shall never be another's."-"And no other's
you shall be," cried Sir William, "if I have any influence with your
father."</p>
<p>This hint was sufficient for my son Moses, who immediately flew
to the inn where the old gentleman was, to inform him of every
circumstance that had happened.  But, in the meantime, the 'Squire, per
ceiving that he was on every side undone, now finding that no hopes
were left from flattery or dissimulation, concluded that his wisest way
would be to turn and face his pursuers.  Thus, laying aside all shame, he
appeared the open,  hardy villain.  "I find, then," cried he, "that I am to
expect no justice here; but I am

<pb n="273"/> resolved that it shall be done me.  You shall know,
sir," turning to Sir William, "I am no longer a poor dependent upon
your favors.  I scorn them.  Nothing can keep Miss Wilmot's fortune
from me, which, I thank her father's assiduity, is pretty large.  The arti
cles and a bond for her fortune are signed, and safe in my possession.  It
was her fortune, not her person that induced me to wish for this match;
and possessed of the one, let who will take the other."</p>
<p>This was an alarming blow; Sir William was sensible of the
justice of his claims, for he had been instrumental in drawing up the
marriage articles himself.  Miss Wilmot, therefore, perceiving her
fortune was irretrievably lost, turning to my son, asked if the loss of
fortune could lessen her value to him.  "Though fortune," said she, "is
out of my power, at, least I have my hand to give."</p>
<p>"And that, madam," cried her real lover, "was, indeed, all that
you ever had to give; at least all that I ever thought worth the
acceptance.  And I now protest, my Arabella, by all that's happy, your
want of fortune this moment increases my pleasure, as it serves to
convince my sweet girl of my sincerity."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilmot now entering, he seemed not a little pleased at the
danger his daughter had just escaped, and readily consented to a
dissolution of the match.  But finding that her fortune, which was
secured to Mr. Thornhill by bond, would not be given up, nothing

<pb n="274"/> could exceed his disappointment.  He now saw that his
money must all go to enrich one who had no fortune of his own.  He
could bear his being a rascal; but to want an equivalent to his daughter's
fortune was wormwood.  He sat, therefore, for some minutes, employed
in the most mortifying speculations, till Sir William attempted to lessen
his anxiety.  "I must confess, sir," cried he, "that your present
disappointment does not entirely displease me.  Your immoderate pas
sion for wealth is now justly punished.  But though the young lady
cannot be rich, she has still a sufficient competence to give content.
Here you see an honest young soldier; who is willing to take her without
fortune; they have long loved each other; and for the friendship I bear
his father, my interest shall not be wanting in his promotion.  Leave,
then, that ambition which disappoints you, and for once admit that happi
ness which courts your acceptance."</p>
<p>"Sir William," replied the old gentleman, "be assured I never yet
forced her inclinations, nor will I now.  If she still continues to love this
young gentleman, let her have him with all my heart.  There is still,
thank Heaven! some fortune left, and your promise will make it
something more.  Only let my old friend here (meaning me) give me a
promise of settling six thousand pounds upon my girl, if ever he should
come to his fortune, and I am ready this night to be the first to join them
together."</p>

<pb n="275"/>
<p>As it now remained with me to make the young couple happy, I
readily gave a promise of making the settlement he required, which, to
one who had such little expectations as I, was no great favor.  We had
now, therefore, the satisfaction of seeing them fly into each other's arms
in a transport.  "After all my misfortunes," cried my son George, "to be
thus rewarded! Sure this is more than I could ever have presumed to
hope for.  To be possessed of all that's good, and after such an interval
of pain! My warmest 'wishes could never rise so high!"</p>
<p>"Yes, my George," returned his lovely bride, "now let the wretch
take my fortune; since you are happy without it, so am I. Oh what an
exchange have I made, from the basest of men to the dearest, the best!
Let him enjoy our fortune, I now can be happy even in indigence."-"And
I promise you," cried the 'Squire, with a malicious grin, "that I shall be
very happy with what you despise."-"Hold, hold, sir!" cried Jenkinson,
"there are two words to that bargain.  As f or that lady's fortune, sir,
you shall never touch a single stiver of it.  Pray, your honor," continued
he to Sir William, "can the 'Squire have this lady's fortune if he be
married to another?"-"How can you make such a simple demand?"
replied the baronet; "undoubtedly he cannot." -"I am sorry for that,"
cried Jenkinson; "for as this gentleman and I have been old
fellow-sporters, I have a friendship for him.  But I must declare, well as
I

<pb n="276"/> love him, that his contract is not worth a tobacco
stopper, for he is married already."-"You lie, like a rascal," returned the
'Squire, who seemed roused by this insult; "I never was legally married
to any woman."</p>
<p>"Indeed, begging your honor's pardon," replied the other, "you
were; and I hope you will show a proper return of friendship to your
own honest Jenkinson, who brings you a wife, and if the company
restrain their curiosity a few minutes, they shall see her." So saying, he
went off with his usual celerity, and left us all unable to form any
probable conjecture as to his designs.  "Ay, let him go," cried the
'Squire; "whatever else I may have done, I defy him there.  I am too
old now to be frightened with squibs."</p>
<p>"I am surprised," said the baronet; "what can the fellow intend by
this? Some low piece of humor, I suppose!" "Perhaps, sir," replied I,
"he may have a more serious meaning.  For when we reflect on the
various schemes this gentleman has laid to seduce innocence, perhaps
some one more artful than the rest has been found able to deceive him.
When we consider what numbers he has ruined, how many parents now
feel with anguish the infamy and the contamination which he has
brought into their families, it would not surprise me if some one of
them-Amazement! Do I see my lost daughter? Do I hold her? It is, it
is, my life, my happiness! I thought thee lost, my

<pb n="277"/> Olivia, yet still I hold thee, and still thou shalt live to
bless me." The warmest transports of the fondest lover were not greater
than mine when I saw him introduce my child, and held my daughter in
my arms, whose silence only spoke her raptures.</p>
<p>"And art thou returned to me, my darling," cried I, "to be my
comfort in age?" "That she is," cried Jenkinson, "and make much of
her, for she is your own honorable child, and as honest a woman as any
in the whole room, let the other be who she will.  And as for you,
'Squire, as sure as you stand there, this young lady is your lawful
wedded wife.  And to convince you that I speak nothing but truth, here
is the license by which you were married together." So saying, he put
the license into the baronet's hand, who read it, and found it perfect in
every respect.  "And now, gentlemen," continued he, "I find you are
surprised at all this; but a few words will explain the difficulty.  That
there 'Squire of renown, for whom I have a great friendship, but that's
between ourselves, has often employed me in doing odd little things for
him.  Among the rest, he commissioned me to procure him a false
license and a false priest, in order to deceive this young lady.  But, as I
was very much his friend, what did I do but went and got a true license
and a true priest, and married them both as fast as the cloth could make
them.  Perhaps, you'll think it was generosity that made me do all this.
But no.  To my

<pb n="278"/> shame I confess it, my only design was to keep the
license and let the 'Squire know that I could prove it upon him whenever
I thought proper, and so make him come down whenever I wanted
money." A burst of pleasure now seemed to fill the whole apartment;
our joy reached even to the common room, where the prisoners
themselves sympathized, </p>
<p>  And shook their chains</p>
<p>  In transport and rude harmony. </p>
<p>Happiness was expanded upon every face, and even Olivia's cheek
seemed flushed with pleasure.  To be thus restored to reputation, to
friends and fortune at once, was a rupture sufficient to stop the progress
of decay and restore former health and vivacity.  But, perhaps, among
all there was not one who felt sincerer pleasure than I. Still holding the
dear-loved child in my arms, I asked my heart if these transports were
not delusion.  "How could you," cried I, turning to Mr. Jenkinson, "how
could you add to my miseries by the story of her death? But it matters
not; my pleasure at finding her again is more than a recompense for the
pain."</p>
<p>"As to your question," replied Jenkinson, "that is easily answered.
I thought the only probable means of freeing you from prison was by
submitting to the 'Squire, and consenting to his marriage with the other
young lady.  But these you had vowed never to grant

<pb n="279"/> while your daughter was living; there was therefore no
other method to bring things to bear but by persuading you that she
was dead.  I prevailed on your wife to join in the deceit, and we have
not had a fit opportunity of undeceiving you till now."</p>
<p>In the whole assembly now there only appeared two faces that did
not glow with transport.  Mr. Thornhill's assurance had entirely
forsaken him: he now saw the gulf of infamy and want before him, and
trembled to take the plunge.  He therefore fell on his knees before his
uncle, and in a voice of piercing misery implored compassion.  Sir
William was going to spurn him away, but at my request he raised him,
and, after pausing a few moments, "Thy vices, crimes and ingratitude,"
cried he, "deserve no tenderness; yet thou shalt not be entirely forsaken,
a bare competence shall be supplied to support the wants of life, but
not its follies.  This young lady, thy wife, shall be put in possession of a
third part of that fortune which once was thine, and from her tenderness
alone thou art to expect any extraordinary supplies for the future." He
was going to express his gratitude for such kindness in a set speech; but
the baronet prevented him by bidding him not aggravate his meanness,
which was already but too apparent.  He ordered him at the same time to
be gone, and from all his former domestics to choose one, such as he
should think proper, which was all that should be granted to attend
him.</p>

<pb n="280"/>
<p>As soon as he left us, Sir William very politely stepped up to his
new niece with a smile, and wished her joy.  His example was followed
by Miss Wilmot and her father; my wife, too, kissed her daughter with
much affection, as, to use her own expression, she was now made an
honest woman of.  Sophia and Moses followed in turn, and even our
benefactor, Jenkinson, desired to be admitted to that honor.  Our
satisfaction seemed scarcely capable of increase.  Sir William, whose
greatest pleasure was in doing good, now looked round with a
countenance open as the sun, and saw nothing but joy in the looks of all
except that of my daughter Sophia, who, for some reasons we could not
comprehend, did not seem perfectly satisfied.  "I think now," cried he,
with a smile, "that all the company except one or two seem perfectly
happy.  There only remains an act of justice for me to do.  You are
sensible, sir," continued he, turning to me, "of the obligations we both
owe Mr. Jenkinson; and it is but just we should both reward him for it.
Miss Sophia will, I am sure, make him very happy, and he shall have
from me five hundred pounds as her fortune, and upon this I am sure
they can live very comfortably together.  Come, Miss Sophia, what say
you to this match of my making? Will you have him?" My poor girl
seemed almost sinking into her mother's arms at the hideous proposal.
"'Have him, sir!" cried she, faintly.  "No, sir, never!"-"What!" cried he
again, "not have

<pb n="281"/> Mr. Jenkinson, your benefactor, a handsome  young
fellow with five hundred pounds and good expectations!"-"I beg, sir,"
returned she, scarcely able to speak, "that you'll desist, and not make me
so very wretched."-"Was ever such obstinacy known," cried he again,
"to refuse a man whom the family has such infinite obligations to, who
has preserved your sister, and who has five hundred pounds! What, not
have him!"-"No, sir, never," replied she, angrily; "I'd sooner die
first!"-"If that be the case then," cried he, "if you will not have him, I
think I must have you myself." And so saying he caught her to his
breast with ardor.  "My loveliest, my most sensible of girls," cried he,
"how could you ever think your own Burchell could deceive you, or that
Sir William Thornhill could ever cease to admire a mistress that loved
him for himself alone? I have for some years sought for a woman, who,
a stranger to my fortune, could think that I had merit as a man.  After
having tried in vain, even amongst the pert and the ugly, how great at
last must be my rapture to have made a conquest over such sense and
heavenly beauty!" Then turning to Jenkinson, "As I cannot, sir, part
with this young lady myself, for she has taken a fancy to the cut of my
face, all the recompense I can make is to give you her fortune, and you
may call upon my steward to-morrow for five hundred pounds." Thus we
had all our compliments to repeat, and Lady Thornhill underwent the
same

<pb n="282"/> round of ceremony that her sister had done before.  In
the meantime Sir William's gentleman appeared to tell us that the
equipages were ready to carry us to the inn, where everything was ready
for our reception.  My wife and I led the van, and left those gloomy
mansions of sorrow.  The generous baronet ordered forty pounds to be
distributed among the prisoners, and Mr. Wilmot, induced by his
example, gave half that sum.  We were received below by the shouts of
the villagers; and I saw and shook by the hand two or three of my honest
parishioners who were among the number.  They attended us to our inn,
where a sumptuous entertainment was provided, and coarser provisions
were distributed in great quantities among the populace.</p>
<p>After supper, as my spirits were exhausted by the alternation of
pleasure and pain which they had sustained during the day, I asked
permission to withdraw; and leaving the company in the midst of their
mirth, as soon as I found myself alone, I poured out my heart in
gratitude to the Giver of joy as well as of sorrow, and then slept
undisturbed till morning.</p>

<head>The Conclusion. </head>
<p>THE next morning as soon as I awoke I found my eldest son
sitting by my bedside, who came to increase my joy with another turn of
fortune in my favor.  First having released me from the settlement that I
had made the day before in his favor, he let me know that my merchant
who had failed in town was arrested at Antwerp, and there had given up
effects to a much greater amount than what was due to his creditors.
My boy's generosity pleased me almost as much as this unlooked-for
good fortune.  But I had some doubts whether I ought in justice to accept
his offer.  While I was pondering upon this, Sir William entered the
room, to whom I communicated my doubts.  His opinion was that as my
son was already possessed of a very affluent fortune by his marriage, I
might accept his offer without any hesitation.  His business, however,
was to inform me that, as he had the night before sent for the licenses,
and expected them every hour, he hoped that I would not refuse my
assistance in making

<pb n="284"/> all the company happy that morning.  A footman
entered while we were speaking, to tell us that the messenger was
returned, and as I was by this time ready I went down, where I found
the whole company as merry as affluence and innocence could make
them.  However, as they were now preparing for a very solemn
ceremony, their laughter entirely displeased me.  I told them of the
grave, becoming and sublime deportment they should assume upon this
mystical occasion, and read them two homilies and a thesis of my own
composing, in order to prepare them.  Yet they still seemed perfectly
refractory and ungovernable.  Even as we were going along to church, to
which I led the way, all gravity had quite forsaken them, and I was often
tempted to turn back in indignation.  In church a new dilemma arose,
which promised no easy solution.  This was, which couple should be
married first.  My son's bride warmly insisted that Lady Thornhill (that
was to be) should take the lead; but this the other refused with equal
ardor, protesting she would not be guilty of such rudeness for the world.
The argument was supported for some time between both with equal
obstinacy and good-breeding.  But as I stood all this time with my book
ready, I was at last quite tired of the contest, and shutting it, "I
perceive," cried I, "that none of you have a mind to be married, and I
think we had as good go back again; for I suppose there will be no
business done here today." This at once reduced

<pb n="285"/> them to reason.  The baronet and his lady were first
married, and then my son and his lovely partner.
</p>
<p>I had previously that morning given orders that a coach should be
sent for my honest neighbor Flamborough and his family, by which
means, upon our return to the inn, we had the pleasure of finding the
two Miss Flamboroughs alighted before us.  Mr. Jenkinson

<pb n="286"/> gave his hand to the eldest, and my son Moses led up
the other (and I have since found that he has taken a real liking to the
girl, and my consent and bounty he shall have, whenever he thinks
proper to demand them).  We were no sooner returned to the inn, but
numbers of my parishioners, hearing of my success, came to
congratulate me, but among the rest were those who rose to rescue me,
and whom I formerly rebuked with such sharpness.  I told the story to
Sir William, my son-in-law, who went out and reproved them with great
severity; but finding them quite disheartened by his harsh reproof, he
gave them half-a-guinea a-piece to drink his health and raise their
dejected spirits.</p>
<p>Soon after this we were called to a very genteel entertainment,
which was dressed by Mr. Thornhill's cook.  And it may not be
improper to observe with respect to that gentleman, that he now resides
in quality of companion at a relation's house, being very well liked, and
seldom sitting at the side-table except when there is no room at the
other; for they make no stranger of him.  His time is pretty much taken
up in keeping his relation, who is a little melancholy, in spirits, and in
learning to blow the French horn.  My eldest daughter, however, still
remembers him with regret; and she has even told me, though I make a
great secret of it, that when he reforms she may be brought to
relent.</p>

<pb n="287"/>
<p>But to return, for I am not apt to digress thus, when we were to sit
down to dinner, our ceremonies were going to be renewed.  The
question was, whether my eldest daughter, as being a matron, should not
sit above the two young brides; but the debate was cut short by my son
George, who proposed that the company should sit indiscriminately,
every gentleman by his lady.  This was received with great approbation
by all, excepting my wife, who, I could perceive, was not perfectly
satisfied, as she expected to have had the pleasure of sitting at the head
of the table and carving all the meat for all the company.  But
notwithstanding this, it is impossible to describe our good humor.  I
can't say whether we had more wit among us than usual; but I am
certain we had more laughing, which answered the end as well.  One jest
I particularly remember: old Mr. Wilmot drinking to Moses, whose head
was turned another way, my son replied: "Madam, I thank you." Upon
which the old gentleman, winking upon the rest of the company,
observed that he was thinking of his mistress.  At which jest I thought
the two Miss Flamboroughs would have died with laughing.  As soon as
dinner was over, according to my old custom, I requested that the table
might be taken away, to have the pleasure of seeing all my family
assembled once more by a cheerful fireside.  My two little ones sat upon
each knee, the company by their partners.  I had nothing, now on this
side of the grave to wish for; all my cares were

<pb n="288"/>
over; my pleasure was unspeakable.  It now only
remained that my gratitude in good fortune should exceed my former
submission in adversity. </p>
