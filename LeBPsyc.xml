<lb/> 
INTRODUCTION 
<lb/> 
THE REVISION OF HISTORY</head> 
 
<p>THE present age is not merely an epoch of discovery; it is 
also a period of revision of the various elements of knowledge. 
Having recognised that there are no phenomena of which the first 
cause is still accessible, science has resumed the examination of 
her ancient certitudes, and has proved their fragility.  To-day 
she sees her ancient principles vanishing one by one.  Mechanics 
is losing its axioms, and matter, formerly the eternal substratum 
of the worlds, becomes a simple aggregate of ephemeral forces in 
transitory condensation. 
</p><p>Despite its conjectural side, by virtue of which it to 
some extent escapes the severest form of criticism, history has 
not been free from this universal revision.  There is no longer a 
single one of its phases of which we can say that it is certainly 
known.  What appeared to be definitely acquired is now once more 
put in question. 
</p><p>Among the events whose study seemed completed was the 
French Revolution.  Analysed by several generations of writers, 
one might suppose it to be 
 
 
<pb n="12"/>  
perfectly elucidated.  What new thing can be said of it, except 
in modification of some of its details? 
</p><p>And yet its most positive defenders are beginning to 
hesitate in their judgments.  Ancient evidence proves to be far 
from impeccable.  The faith in dogmas once held sacred is shaken. 
The latest literature of the Revolution betrays these 
uncertainties.  Having related, men are more and more chary of 
drawing conclusions. 
</p><p>Not only are the heroes of this great drama discussed 
without indulgence, but thinkers are asking whether the new 
dispensation which followed the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> would 
not have established itself naturally, without violence, in the 
course of progressive civilisation.  The results obtained no 
longer seem in correspondence either with their immediate cost or 
with the remoter consequences which the Revolution evoked from 
the possibilities of history. 
</p><p>Several causes have led to the revision of this tragic 
period.  Time has calmed passions, numerous documents have 
gradually emerged from the archives, and the historian is 
learning to interpret them independently. 
</p><p>But it is perhaps modern psychology that has most 
effectually influenced our ideas, by enabling us more surely to 
read men and the motives of their conduct. 
</p><p>Among those of its discoveries which are henceforth 
applicable to history we must mention, above all, a more profound 
understanding of ancestral influences, the laws which rule the 
actions of the crowd, data relating to the disaggregation of 
personality, mental contagion, the unconscious formation of 
beliefs, and the distinction between the various forms of logic. 
 
 
<pb n="13"/>  
</p><p>To tell the truth, these applications of science, which 
are utilised in this book, have not been so utilised hitherto. 
Historians have generally stopped short at the study of 
documents, and even that study is sufficient to excite the doubts 
of which I have spoken. 
 
</p><p>The great events which shape the destinies of peoples&mdash; 
revolutions, for example, and the outbreak of religious beliefs&mdash; 
are sometimes so difficult to explain that one must limit oneself 
to a mere statement. 
</p><p>From the time of my first historical researches I have 
been struck by the impenetrable aspect of certain essential 
phenomena, those relating to the genesis of beliefs especially; I 
felt convinced that something fundamental was lacking that was 
essential to their interpretation.  Reason having said all it 
could say, nothing more could be expected of it, and other means 
must be sought of comprehending what had not been elucidated. 
</p><p>For a long time these important questions remained obscure

to me.  Extended travel, devoted to the study of the remnants of 
vanished civilisations, had not done much to throw light upon 
them. 
</p><p>Reflecting upon it continually, I was forced to recognise 
that the problem was composed of a series of other problems, 
which I should have to study separately.  This I did for a period

of twenty years, presenting the results of my researches in a 
succession of volumes. 
</p><p>One of the first was devoted to the study of the 
psychological laws of the evolution of peoples.  Having 
 
<pb n="14"/>  
 
shown that the historic races&mdash;that is, the races formed by the 
hazards of history&mdash;finally acquired psychological 
characteristics as stable as their anatomical characteristics, I 
attempted to explain how a people transforms its institutions, 
its languages, and its arts.  I explained in the same work why it

was that individual personalities, under the influence of sudden 
variations of environment, might be entirely disaggregated. 
</p><p>But besides the fixed collectivities formed by the 
peoples, there are mobile and transitory collectivities known as 
crowds.  Now these crowds or mobs, by the aid of which the great 
movements of history are accomplished, have characteristics 
absolutely different from those of the individuals who compose 
them.  What are these characteristics, and how are they evolved? 
This new problem was examined in <hi rend="italic">The Psychology of the 
Crowd</hi>. 
</p><p>Only after these studies did I begin to perceive certain 
influences which had escaped me. 
</p><p>But this was not all.  Among the most important factors of

history one was preponderant&mdash;the factor of beliefs.  How are 
these beliefs born, and are they really rational and voluntary, 
as was long taught?  Are they not rather unconscious and 
independent of all reason?  A difficult question, which I dealt 
with in my last book, <hi rend="italic">Opinions and Beliefs</hi>. 
</p><p>So long as psychology regards beliefs as voluntary and 
rational they will remain inexplicable.  Having proved that they 
are usually irrational and always involuntary, I was able to 
propound the solution of this important problem; how it was that 
beliefs which no reason could justify were admitted with 
 
 
<pb n="15"/>  
out difficulty by the most enlightened spirits of all 
 ages. 
</p><p>The solution of the historical difficulties which had so 
long been sought was thenceforth obvious.  I arrived at the 
conclusion that beside the rational logic which conditions 
thought, and was formerly regarded as our sole guide, there exist

very different forms of logic: affective logic, collective logic,

and mystic logic, which usually overrule the reason and engender 
the generative impulses of our conduct. 
</p><p>This fact well established, it seemed to me evident that 
if a great number of historical events are often uncomprehended, 
it is because we seek to interpret them in the light of a logic 
which in reality has very little influence upon their genesis. 
 
</p><p>All these researches, which are here summed up in a few 
lines, demanded long years for their accomplishment.  Despairing 
of completing them, I abandoned them more than once to return to 
those labours of the laboratory in which one is always sure of 
skirting the truth and of acquiring fragments at least of 
certitude. 
</p><p>But while it is very interesting to explore the world of 
material phenomena, it is still more so to decipher men, for 
which reason I have always been led back to psychology. 
</p><p>Certain principles deduced from my researches appearing 
likely to prove fruitful, I resolved to apply them to the study 
of concrete instances, and was thus led to deal with the 
Psychology of Revolutions&mdash;notably that of the French Revolution.

</p><p>Proceeding in the analysis of our great Revolution, 
 
 
<pb n="16"/>  
the greater part of the opinions determined by the reading of 
books deserted me one by one, although I had considered them 
unshakable. 
</p><p>To explain this period we must consider it as a whole, as 
many historians have done.  It is composed of phenomena 
simultaneous but independent of one another. 
</p><p>Each of its phases reveals events engendered by 
psychological laws working with the regularity of clockwork.  The

actors in this great drama seem to move like the characters of a 
previously determined drama.  Each says what he must say, acts as

he is bound to act. 
</p><p>To be sure, the actors in the revolutionary drama differed

from those of a written drama in that they had not studied their 
parts, but these were dictated by invisible forces. 
</p><p>Precisely because they were subjected to the inevitable 
progression of logics incomprehensible to them we see them as 
greatly astonished by the events of which they were the heroes as

are we ourselves.  Never did they suspect the invisible powers 
which forced them to act.  They were the masters neither of their

fury nor their weakness.  They spoke in the name of reason, 
pretending to be guided by reason, but in reality it was by no 
means reason that impelled them. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The decisions for which we are so greatly 
reproached,&rdquo; wrote Billaud-Varenne, &ldquo;were more often than

otherwise not intended or desired by us two days or even one day 
beforehand: the crisis alone evoked them.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Not that we must consider the events of the 
 
 
<pb n="17"/>  
Revolution as dominated by an imperious fatality.  The readers of

our works will know that we recognise in the man of superior 
qualities the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of averting fatalities.  But he 
can dissociate himself only from a few of such, and is often 
powerless before the sequence of events which even at their 
origin could scarcely be ruled.  The scientist knows how to 
destroy the microbe before it has time to act, but he knows 
himself powerless to prevent the evolution of the resulting 
malady. 
 
</p><p>When any question gives rise to violently contradictory 
opinions we may be sure that it belongs to the province of 
beliefs and not to that of knowledge. 
</p><p>We have shown in a preceding work that belief, of 
unconscious origin and independent of all reason, can never be 
influenced by reason. 
</p><p>The Revolution, the work of believers, has seldom been 
judged by any but believers.  Execrated by some and praised by 
others, it has remained one of those dogmas which are accepted or

rejected as a whole, without the intervention of rational logic. 
</p><p>Although in its beginnings a religious or political 
revolution may very well be supported by rational elements, it is

developed only by the aid of mystic and affective elements which 
are absolutely foreign to reason. 
</p><p>The historians who have judged the events of the French 
Revolution in the name of rational logic could not comprehend 
them, since this form of logic did not dictate them.  As the 
actors of these events themselves understood them but ill, we 
shall not be far from the truth in saying that our Revolution 
 
 
<pb n="18"/>  
was a phenomenon equally misunderstood by those who caused it and

by those who have described it.  At no period of history did men 
so little grasp the present, so greatly ignore the past, and so 
poorly divine the future. 
 
</p><p>. . . The power of the Revolution did not reside in the 
principles&mdash;which for that matter were anything but novel&mdash;which 
it sought to propagate, nor in the institutions which it sought 
to found.  The people cares very little for institutions and even

less for doctrines.  That the Revolution was potent indeed, that 
it made France accept the violence, the murders, the ruin and the

horror of a frightful civil war, that finally it defended itself 
victoriously against a Europe in arms, was due to the fact that 
it had founded not a new system of government but a new religion.

Now history shows us how irresistible is the might of a strong 
belief.  Invincible Rome herself had to bow before the armies of 
nomad shepherds illuminated by the faith of Mahommed.  For the 
same reason the kings of Europe could not resist the 
tatterdemalion soldiers of the Convention.  Like all apostles, 
they were ready to immolate themselves in the sole end of 
propagating their beliefs, which according to their dream were to

renew the world. 
</p><p>The religion thus founded had the force of other 
religions, if not their duration.  Yet it did not perish without 
leaving indelible traces, and its influence is active still. 
 
</p><p>We shall not consider the Revolution as a clean 
 
 
<pb n="19"/>  
sweep in history, as its apostles believed it.  We know that to 
demonstrate their intention of creating a world distinct from the

old they initiated a new era and professed to break entirely with

all vestiges of the past. 
</p><p>But the past never dies.  It is even more truly within us 
than without us.  Against their will the reformers of the 
Revolution remained saturated with the past, and could only 
continue, under other names, the traditions of the monarchy, even

exaggerating the autocracy and centralisation of the old system. 
Tocqueville had no difficulty in proving that the Revolution did 
little but overturn that which was about to fall. 
</p><p>If in reality the Revolution destroyed but little it 
favoured the fruition of certain ideas which continued 
thenceforth to develop.  The fraternity and liberty which it 
proclaimed never greatly seduced the peoples, but equality became

their gospel: the pivot of socialism and of the entire evolution 
of modern democratic ideas.  We may therefore say that the 
Revolution did not end with the advent of the Empire, nor with 
the successive restorations which followed it.  Secretly or in 
the light of day it has slowly unrolled itself and still affects 
men's minds. 
 
</p><p>The study of the French Revolution to which a great part 
of this book is devoted will perhaps deprive the reader of more 
than one illusion, by proving to him that the books which recount

the history of the Revolution contain in reality a mass of 
legends very remote from reality. 
</p><p>These legends will doubtless retain more life than 
 
 
<pb n="20"/>  
history itself.  Do not regret this too greatly.  It may interest

a few philosophers to know the truth, but the peoples will always

prefer dreams.  Synthetising their ideal, such dreams will always

constitute powerful motives of action.  One would lose courage 
were it not sustained by false ideas, said Fontenelle.  Joan of 
Arc, the Giants of the Convention, the Imperial epic&mdash;all these 
dazzling images of the past will always remain sources of hope in

the gloomy hours that follow defeat.  They form part of that 
patrimony of illusions left us by our fathers, whose power is 
often greater than that of reality.  The dream, the ideal, the 
legend&mdash;in a word, the unreal&mdash;it is that which shapes history.

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d16"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Classification of Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WE generally apply the term <hi rend="italic">revolution</hi> to sudden 
political changes, but the expression may be employed to denote 
all sudden transformations, or transformations apparently sudden,

whether of beliefs, ideas, or doctrines. 
</p><p>We have considered elsewhere the part played by the 
rational, affective, and mystic factors in the genesis of the 
opinions and beliefs which determine conduct.  We need not 
therefore return to the subject here. 
</p><p>A revolution may finally become a belief, but it often 
commences under the action of perfectly rational motives: the 
suppression of crying abuses, of a detested despotic government, 
or an unpopular sovereign, &amp;c. 
</p><p>Although the origin of a revolution may be perfectly 
rational, we must not forget that the reasons invoked in 
preparing for it do not influence the crowd 
 
 
 
<pb n="24"/>  
until they have been transformed into sentiments.  Rational logic

can point to the abuses to be destroyed, but to move the 
multitude its hopes must be awakened.  This can only be effected 
by the action of the affective and mystic elements which give man

the power to act.  At the time of the French Revolution, for 
example, rational logic, in the hands of the philosophers, 
demonstrated the inconveniences of the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi>, and excited the desire to change it.  Mystic 
logic inspired belief in the virtues of a society created in all 
its members according to certain principles.  Affective logic 
unchained the passions confined by the bonds of ages and led to 
the worst excesses.  Collective logic ruled the clubs and the 
Assemblies and impelled their members to actions which neither 
rational nor affective nor mystic logic would ever have caused 
them to commit. 
</p><p>Whatever its origin, a revolution is not productive of 
results until it has sunk into the soul of the multitude.  Then 
events acquire special forms resulting from the peculiar 
psychology of crowds.  Popular movements for this reason have 
characteristics so pronounced that the description of one will 
enable us to comprehend the others. 
</p><p>The multitude is, therefore, the agent of a revolution; 
but not its point of departure.  The crowd represents an 
amorphous being which can do nothing, and will nothing, without a

head to lead it.  It will quickly exceed the impulse once 
received, but it never creates it. 
</p><p>The sudden political revolutions which strike the 
historian most forcibly are often the least important.  The great

revolutions are those of manners and 
 
 
<pb n="25"/>  
thought.  Changing the name of a government does not transform 
the mentality of a people.  To overthrow the institutions of a 
people is not to re-shape its soul. 
</p><p>The true revolutions, those which transform the destinies 
of the peoples, are most frequently accomplished so slowly that 
the historians can hardly point to their beginnings.  The term 
evolution is, therefore, far more appropriate than revolution. 
</p><p>The various elements we have enumerated as entering into 
the genesis of the majority of revolutions will not suffice to 
classify them.  Considering only the designed object, we will 
divide them into scientific revolutions, political revolutions, 
and religious revolutions. 
</p> 
</div4> 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d17"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Scientific Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Scientific revolutions are by far the most important. 
Although they attract but little attention, they are often 
fraught with remote consequences, such as are not engendered by 
political revolutions.  We will therefore put them first, 
although we cannot study them here. 
</p><p>For instance, if our conceptions of the universe have 
profoundly changed since the time of the Revolution, it is 
because astronomical discoveries and the application of 
experimental methods have revolutionised them, by demonstrating 
that phenomena, instead of being conditioned by the caprices of 
the gods, are ruled by invariable laws. 
</p><p>Such revolutions are fittingly spoken of as evolution, on 
account of their slowness.  But there are others which, although 
of the same order, deserve the name of revolution by reason of 
their rapidity: we 
 
 
<pb n="26"/>  
 
his instance the theories of Darwin, overthrowing the whole 
science of biology in a few years; the discoveries of Pasteur, 
which revolutionised medicine during the lifetime of their 
author; and the theory of the dissociation of matter, proving 
that the atom, formerly supposed to be eternal, is not immune 
from the laws which condemn all the elements of the universe to 
decline and perish. 
</p><p>These scientific revolutions in the domain of ideas are 
purely intellectual.  Our sentiments and beliefs do not affect 
them.  Men submit to them without discussing them.  Their results

being controllable by experience, they escape all criticism. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d18"> 
<head><hi rend="italic">3.  Political Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Beneath and very remote from these scientific revolutions, 
which generate the progress of civilisations, are the religious 
and political revolutions, which have no kinship with them. 
While scientific revolutions derive solely from rational 
elements, political and religious beliefs are sustained almost 
exclusively by affective and mystic factors.  Reason plays only a

feeble part in their genesis. 
</p><p>I insisted at some length in my book <hi rend="italic">Opinions and 
Beliefs</hi> on the affective and mystic origin of beliefs, 
showing that a political or religious belief constitutes an act 
of faith elaborated in unconsciousness, over which, in spite of 
all appearances, reason has no hold.  I also showed that belief 
often reaches such a degree of intensity that nothing can be 
opposed to it.  The man hypnotised by his faith becomes an 
Apostle, ready to sacrifice his interests, his happiness, and 
even his life for the triumph of his faith.  The absurdity of 
 
 
<pb n="27"/>  
his belief matters little; for him it is a burning reality. 
Certitudes of mystic origin possess the marvellous power of 
entire domination over thought, and can only be affected by time.

</p><p>By the very fact that it is regarded as an absolute truth 
a belief necessarily becomes intolerant.  This explains the 
violence, hatred, and persecution which were the habitual 
accompaniments of the great political and religious revolutions, 
notably of the Reformation and the French Revolution. 
</p><p>Certain periods of French history remain incomprehensible 
if we forget the affective and mystic origin of beliefs, their 
necessary intolerance, the impossibility of reconciling them when

they come into mutual contact, and, finally, the power conferred 
by mystic beliefs upon the sentiments which place themselves at 
their service. 
</p><p>The foregoing conceptions are too novel as yet to have 
modified the mentality of the historians.  They will continue to 
attempt to explain, by means of rational logic, a host of 
phenomena which are foreign to it. 
</p><p>Events such as the Reformation, which overwhelmed France 
for a period of fifty years, were in no wise determined by 
rational influences.  Yet rational influences are always invoked 
in explanation, even in the most recent works.  Thus, in the 
<hi rend="italic">General History</hi> of Messrs.  Lavisse and Rambaud, we read 
the following explanation of the Reformation:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It was a spontaneous movement, born here and there 
amidst the people, from the reading of the Gospels and the free 
individual reflections which were suggested to simple persons by 
an extremely pious conscience and a very bold reasoning 
power.&rdquo; 
 
 
<pb n="28"/>  
 
</p><p>Contrary to the assertion of these historians, we may say 
with certainty, in the first place, that such movements are never

spontaneous, and secondly, that reason takes no part in their 
elaboration. 
</p><p>The force of the political and religious beliefs which 
have moved the world resides precisely in the fact that, being 
born of affective and mystic elements, they are neither created 
nor directed by reason. 
</p><p>Political or religious beliefs have a common origin and 
obey the same laws.  They are formed not with the aid of reason, 
but more often contrary to all reason.  Buddhism, Islamism, the 
Reformation, Jacobinism, Socialism, &amp;c., seem very different 
forms of thought.  Yet they have identical affective and mystic 
bases, and obey a logic that has no affinity with rational logic.

</p><p>Political revolutions may result from beliefs established 
in the minds of men, but many other causes produce them.  The 
word discontent sums them up.  As soon as discontent is 
generalised a party is formed which often becomes strong enough 
to struggle against the Government. 
</p><p>Discontent must generally have been accumulating for a 
long time in order to produce its effects.  For this reason a 
revolution does not always represent a phenomenon in process of 
termination followed by another which is commencing but rather a 
continuous phenomenon, having somewhat accelerated its evolution.

All the modern revolutions, however, have been abrupt movements, 
entailing the instantaneous overthrow of governments.  Such, for 
example, were the Brazilian, Portuguese, Turkish, and Chinese 
revolutions. 
</p><p>To the contrary of what might be supposed, the 
 
 
<pb n="29"/>  
very conservative peoples are addicted to the most violent 
revolutions.  Being conservative, they are not able to evolve 
slowly, or to adapt themselves to variations of environment, so 
that when the discrepancy 
becomes too extreme they are bound to adapt themselves suddenly. 
This sudden evolution constitutes a revolution. 
</p><p>Peoples able to adapt themselves progressively do not 
always escape revolution.  It was only by means of a revolution 
that the English, in 1688, were able to terminate the struggle 
which had dragged on for a century between the monarchy, which 
sought to make itself absolute, and the nation, which claimed the

right to govern itself through the medium of its representatives.

</p><p>The great revolutions have usually commenced from the top,

not from the bottom; but once the people is unchained it is to 
the people that revolution owes its might. 
</p><p>It is obvious that revolutions have never taken place, and

will never take place, save with the aid of an important fraction

of the army.  Royalty did not disappear in France on the day when

Louis XVI. was guillotined, but at the precise moment when his 
mutinous troops refused to defend him. 
</p><p>It is more particularly by mental contagion that armies 
become disaffected, being indifferent enough at heart to the 
established order of things.  As soon as the coalition of a few 
officers had succeeded in overthrowing the Turkish Government the

Greek officers thought to imitate them and to change their 
government, although there was no analogy between the two 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gimes</hi>, 
 
 
<pb n="30"/>  
</p><p>A military movement may overthrow a government&mdash;and in the

Spanish republics the Government is hardly ever destroyed by any 
other means&mdash;but if the revolution is to be productive of great 
results it must always be based upon general discontent and 
general hopes. 
</p><p>Unless it is universal and excessive, discontent alone is 
not sufficient to bring about a revolution.  It is easy to lead a

handful of men to pillage, destroy, and massacre, but to raise a 
whole people, or any great portion of that people, calls for the 
continuous or repeated action of leaders.  These exaggerate the 
discontent; they persuade the discontented that the government is

the sole cause of all the trouble, especially of the prevailing 
dearth, and assure men that the new system proposed by them will 
engender an age of felicity.  These ideas germinate, propagating 
themselves by suggestion and contagion, and the moment arrives 
when the revolution is ripe. 
</p><p>In this fashion the Christian Revolution and the French 
Revolution were prepared.  That the latter was effected in a few 
years, while the first required many, was due to the fact that 
the French Revolution promptly had an armed force at its 
disposal, while Christianity was long in winning material power. 
In the beginning its only adepts were the lowly, the poor, and 
the slaves, filled with enthusiasm by the prospect of seeing 
their miserable life transformed into an eternity of delight.  By

a phenomenon of contagion from below, of which history affords us

more than one example, the doctrine finally invaded the upper 
strata of the nation, but it was a long time before an 
 
 
<pb n="31"/>  
emperor considered the new faith sufficiently widespread to be 
adopted as the official religion. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d19"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">The Results of Political Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>When a political party is triumphant it naturally seeks to 
organise society in accordance with its interests.  The 
organisation will differ accordingly as the revolution has been 
effected by the soldiers, the Radicals, or the Conservatives, &amp;c.

The new laws and institutions will depend on the interests of the

triumphant party and of the classes which have assisted it&mdash;the 
clergy for instance. 
</p><p>If the revolution has triumphed only after a violent 
struggle, as was the case with the French Revolution, the victors

will reject at one sweep the whole arsenal of the old law.  The 
supporters of the fallen <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> will be persecuted,

exiled, or exterminated. 
</p><p>The maximum of violence in these persecutions is attained 
when the triumphant party is defending a belief in addition to 
its material interests.  Then the conquered need hope for no 
pity.  Thus may be explained the expulsion of the Moors from 
Spain, the autodaf&eacute;s of the Inquisition, the executions of

the Convention, and the recent laws against the religious 
congregations in France. 
</p><p>The absolute power which is assumed by the victors leads 
them sometimes to extreme measures, such as the Convention's 
decree that gold was to be replaced by paper, that goods were to 
be sold at determined prices, &amp;c.  Very soon it runs up against a

wall of unavoidable necessities, which turn opinion against its 
tyranny, and finally leave it defenceless before attack, as 
befell at the end of the French Revolution.  The 
 
 
<pb n="32"/>  
same thing happened recently to a Socialist Australian ministry 
composed almost exclusively of working-men.  It enacted laws so 
absurd, and accorded such privileges to the trade unions, that 
public opinion rebelled against it so unanimously that in three 
months it was overthrown. 
</p><p>But the cases we have considered are exceptional.  The 
majority of revolutions have been accomplished in order to place 
a new sovereign in power.  Now this sovereign knows very well 
that the first condition of maintaining his power consists in not

too exclusively favouring a single class, but in seeking to 
conciliate all.  To do this he will establish a sort of 
equilibrium between them, so as not to be dominated by any one of

these classes.  To allow one class to become predominant is to 
condemn himself presently to accept that class as his master. 
This law is one of the most certain of political psychology.  The

kings of France understood it very well when they struggled so 
energetically against the encroachments first of the nobility and

then of the clergy.  If they had not done so their fate would 
have been that of the German Emperors of the Middle Ages, who, 
excommunicated by the Pope, were reduced, like Henry IV. at 
Canossa, to make a pilgrimage and humbly to sue for the Pope's 
forgiveness. 
</p><p>This same law has continually been verified during the 
course of history.  When at the end of the Roman Empire the 
military caste became preponderant, the emperors depended 
entirely upon their soldiers, who appointed and deposed them at 
will. 
</p><p>It was therefore a great advantage for France that she was

so long governed by a monarch almost 
 
 
<pb n="33"/>  
absolute, supposed to hold his power by divine right, and 
surrounded therefore by a considerable prestige.  Without such an

authority he could have controlled neither the feudal nobility, 
nor the clergy, nor the parliaments.  If Poland, towards the end 
of the sixteenth century, had also possessed an absolute and 
respected monarchy, she would not have descended the path of 
decadence which led to her disappearance from the map of Europe. 
</p><p>We have shewn in this chapter that political revolutions 
may be accompanied by important social transformations.  We shall

soon see how slight are these transformations compared to those 
produced by religious revolutions.

<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The importance of the study of Religious Revolutions

in respect of the comprehension of the great Political 
Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
 
<p>A PORTION of this work will be devoted to the French 
Revolution.  It was full of acts of violence which naturally had 
their psychological causes. 
</p><p>These exceptional events will always fill us with 
astonishment, and we even feel them to be inexplicable.  They 
become comprehensible, however, if we consider that the French 
Revolution, constituting a new religion, was bound to obey the 
laws which condition the propagation of all beliefs.  Its fury 
and its hecatombs will then become intelligible. 
</p><p>In studying the history of a great religious revolution, 
that of the Reformation, we shall see that a number of 
psychological elements which figured therein were equally active 
during the French Revolution.  In both we observe the 
insignificant bearing of the rational value of a belief upon its 
propagation, the inefficacy of persecution, the impossibility of 
tolerance between contrary beliefs, and the violence and the 
desperate struggles resulting from the conflict of different 
faiths.  We also observe the exploitation of a belief by 
interests quite independent 
 
 
<pb n="35"/>  
of that belief.  Finally we see that it is impossible to modify 
the convictions of men without also modifying their existence. 
</p><p>These phenomena verified, we shall see plainly why the 
gospel of the Revolution was propagated by the same methods as 
all the religious gospels, notably that of Calvin.  It could not 
have been propagated otherwise. 
</p><p>But although there are close analogies between the genesis

of a religious revolution, such as the Reformation, and that of a

great political revolution like our own, their remote 
consequences are very different, which explains the difference of

duration which they display.  In religious revolutions no 
experience can reveal to the faithful that they are deceived, 
since they would have to go to heaven to make the discovery.  In 
political revolutions experience quickly demonstrates the error 
of a false doctrine and forces men to abandon it. 
</p><p>Thus at the end of the Directory the application of 
Jacobin beliefs had led France to such a degree of ruin, poverty,

and despair that the wildest Jacobins themselves had to renounce 
their system.  Nothing survived of their theories except a few 
principles which cannot be verified by experience, such as the 
universal happiness which equality should bestow upon humanity. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d22"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The beginnings of the Reformation and its first 
disciples</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The Reformation was finally to exercise a profound influence 
upon the sentiments and moral ideas of a great proportion of 
mankind.  Modest in its beginnings, 
 
 
<pb n="36"/>  
it was at first a simple struggle against the abuses of the 
clergy, and, from a practical point of view, a return to the 
prescriptions of the Gospel.  It never constituted, as has been 
claimed, an aspiration towards freedom of thought.  Calvin was as

intolerant as Robespierre, and all the theorists of the age 
considered that the religion of subjects must be that of the 
prince who governed them.  Indeed in every country where the 
Reformation was established the sovereign replaced the Pope of 
Rome, with the same rights and the same powers. 
</p><p>In France, in default of publicity and means of 
communication, the new faith spread slowly enough at first.  It 
was about 1520 that Luther recruited a few adepts, and only 
towards 1535 was the new belief sufficiently widespread for men 
to consider it necessary to burn its disciples. 
</p><p>In conformity with a well-known psychological law, these 
executions merely favoured the propagation of the Reformation. 
Its first followers included priests and magistrates, but were 
principally obscure artisans.  Their conversion was effected 
almost exclusively by mental contagion and suggestion. 
</p><p>As soon as a new belief extends itself, we see grouped 
round it many persons who are indifferent to the belief, but who 
find in it a pretext or opportunity for gratifying their passions

or their greed.  This phenomenon was observed at the time of the 
Reformation in many countries, notably in Germany and in England.

Luther having taught that the clergy had no need of wealth, the 
German lords found many merits in a faith which enabled them to 
seize upon the goods of the Church.  Henry VIII. enriched himself

 
 
<pb n="37"/>  
by a similar operation.  Sovereigns who were often molested by 
the Pope could as a rule only look favourably upon a doctrine 
which added religious powers to their political powers and made 
each of them a Pope.  Far from diminishing the absolutism of 
rulers, the Reformation only exaggerated it. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d23"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Rational value of the doctrines of the 
Reformation</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The Reformation overturned all Europe, and came near to 
ruining France, of which it made a battle-field for a period of 
fifty years.  Never did a cause so insignificant from the 
rational point of view produce such great results. 
</p><p>Here is one of the innumerable proofs of the fact that 
beliefs are propagated independently of all reason.  The 
theological doctrines which aroused men's passions so violently, 
and notably those of Calvin, are not even worthy of examination 
in the light of rational logic. 
</p><p>Greatly concerned about his salvation, having an excessive

fear of the devil, which his confessor was unable to allay, 
Luther sought the surest means of pleasing God that he might 
avoid Hell.  Having commenced by denying the Pope the right to 
sell indulgences, he presently entirely denied his authority, and

that of the Church, condemned religious ceremonies, confession, 
and the worship of the saints, and declared that Christians 
should have no rules of conduct other than the Bible.  He also 
considered that no one could be saved without the grace of God. 
</p><p>This last theory, known as that of predestination, was in 
Luther rather uncertain, but was stated precisely by Calvin, who 
made it the very foundation of a doctrine to which the majority 
of Protestants are 
 
 
<pb n="38"/>  
still subservient.  According to him: &ldquo;From all eternity God 
has predestined certain men to be burned and others to be 
saved.&rdquo;  Why this monstrous iniquity?  Simply because &ldquo;it

is the will of God.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Thus according to Calvin, who for that matter merely 
developed certain assertions of St. Augustine, an all-powerful 
God would amuse Himself by creating living beings simply in order

to burn them during all eternity, without paying any heed to 
their acts or merits.  It is marvellous that such revolting 
insanity could for such a length of time subjugate so many 
minds&mdash;marvellous that it does so still.<ref target="n1">1</ref>
 
 
<pb n="39"/>  
 
</p><p>The psychology of Calvin is not without affinity with that 
of Robespierre.  Like the latter, the master of the pure truth, 
he sent to death those who would not accept his doctrines.  God, 
he stated, wishes &ldquo;that one should put aside all humanity 
when it is a question of striving for his glory.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The case of Calvin and his disciples shows that matters 
which rationally are the most contradictory become perfectly 
reconciled in minds which are hypnotised by a belief.  In the 
eyes of rational logic, it seems impossible to base a morality 
upon the theory of predestination, since whatever they do men are

sure of being either saved or damned.  However, Calvin had no 
difficulty in erecting a most severe morality upon this totally 
illogical basis.  Considering themselves the elect of God, his 
disciples were so swollen by pride and the sense of their own 
dignity that they felt obliged to serve as models in their 
conduct. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d24"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">Propagation of the Reformation</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The new faith was propagated not by speech, still less by 
process of reasoning, but by the mechanism described in our 
preceding work: that is, by the influence of affirmation, 
repetition, mental contagion, and prestige.  At a much later date

revolutionary ideas were spread over France in the same fashion. 
</p><p>Persecution, as we have already remarked, only favoured 
this propagation.  Each execution led to fresh conversions, as 
was seen in the early years of the Christian Church.  Anne 
Dubourg, Parliamentary councillor, condemned to be burned alive, 
marched to the stake exhorting the crowd to be converted. 
&ldquo;His 
 
 
<pb n="40"/>  
constancy,&rdquo; says a witness, &ldquo;made more Protestants among 
the young men of the colleges than the books of Calvin.&rdquo; 
</p><p>To prevent the condemned from speaking to the people their

tongues were cut out before they were burned.  The horror of 
their sufferings was increased by attaching the victims to an 
iron chain, which enabled the executioners to plunge them into 
the fire and withdraw them several times in succession. 
</p><p>But nothing induced the Protestants to retract, even the 
offer of an amnesty after they had felt the fire. 
</p><p>In 1535 Francis I., forsaking his previous tolerance, 
ordered six fires to be lighted simultaneously in Paris.  The 
Convention, as we know, limited itself to a single guillotine in 
the same city.  It is probable that the sufferings of the victims

were not very excruciating; the insensibility of the Christian 
martyrs had already been remarked.  Believers are hypnotised by 
their faith, and we know to-day that certain forms of hypnotism 
engender complete insensibility. 
</p><p>The new faith progressed rapidly.  In 1560 there were two 
thousand reformed churches in France, and many great lords, at 
first indifferent enough, adhered to the new doctrine. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="5" id="d25"> 
<head>5.  <hi rend="italic">Conflict between different religious beliefs&mdash; 
Impossibility of Tolerance</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>I have already stated that intolerance is always an 
accompaniment of powerful religious beliefs.  Political and 
religious revolutions furnish us with numerous proofs of this 
fact, and show us also that the mutual intolerance of sectaries 
of the same religion is 
 
 
<pb n="41"/>  
always much greater than that of the defenders of remote and 
alien faiths, such as Islamism and Christianity.  In fact, if we 
consider the faiths for whose sake France was so long rent 
asunder, we shall find that they did not differ on any but 
accessory points.  Catholics and Protestants adored exactly the 
same God, and only differed in their manner of adoring Him.  If 
reason had played the smallest part in the elaboration of their 
belief, it could easily have proved to them that it must be quite

indifferent to God whether He sees men adore Him in this fashion 
or in that. 
</p><p>Reason being powerless to affect the brain of the 
convinced, Protestants and Catholics continued their ferocious 
conflicts.  All the efforts of their sovereigns to reconcile them

were in vain.  Catherine de Medicis, seeing the party of the 
Reformed Church increasing day by day in spite of persecution, 
and attracting a considerable number of nobles and magistrates, 
thought to disarm them by convoking at Poissy, in 1561, an 
assembly of bishops and pastors with the object of fusing the two

doctrines.  Such an enterprise indicated that the queen, despite 
her subtlety, knew nothing of the laws of mystic logic.  Not in 
all history can one cite an example of a belief destroyed or 
reduced by means of refutation.  Catherine did not even know that

although toleration is with difficulty possible between 
individuals, it is impossible between collectivities.  Her 
attempt failed completely.  The assembled theologians hurled 
texts and insults at one another's heads, but no one was moved. 
Catherine thought to succeed better in 1562 by promulgating an 
edict according Protestants the 
 
 
<pb n="42"/>  
right to unite in the public celebration of their cult. 
</p><p>This tolerance, very admirable from a philosophical point 
of view, but not at all wise from the political standpoint, had 
no other result beyond exasperating both parties.  In the Midi, 
where the Protestants were strongest, they persecuted the 
Catholics, sought to convert them by violence, cut their throats 
if they did not succeed, and sacked their cathedrals.  In the 
regions where the Catholics were more numerous the Reformers 
suffered like persecutions. 
</p><p>Such hostilities as these inevitably engendered civil war.

Thus arose the so-called religious wars, which so long spilled 
the blood of France.  The cities were ravaged, the inhabitants 
massacred, and the struggle rapidly assumed that special quality 
of ferocity peculiar to religious or political conflicts, which, 
at a later date, was to reappear in the wars of La Vend&eacute;e.

</p><p>Old men, women, and children, all were exterminated.  A 
certain Baron d'Oppede, first president of the Parliament of Aix,

had already set an example by killing 3,000 persons in the space 
of ten days, with refinements of cruelty, and destroying three 
cities and twenty-two villages.  Montluc, a worthy forerunner of 
Carrier, had the Calvinists thrown living into the wells until 
these were full.  The Protestants were no more humane.  They did 
not spare even the Catholic churches, and treated the tombs and 
statues just as the delegates of the Convention were to treat the

royal tombs of Saint Denis. 
</p><p>Under the influence of these conflicts France was 
progressively disintegrated, and at the end of the reign of Henri

III. was parcelled out into veritable 
 
 
<pb n="43"/>  
little confederated municipal republics, forming so many 
sovereign states.  The royal power was vanishing.  The States of 
Blois claimed to dictate their wishes to Henri III., who had fled

from his capital.  In 1577 the traveller Lippomano, who traversed

France, saw important cities&mdash;Orleans, Tours, Blois, Poitiers&mdash; 
entirely devastated, the cathedrals and churches in ruins, and 
the tombs shattered.  This was almost the state of France at the 
end of the Directory. 
</p><p>Among the events of this epoch, that which has left the 
darkest memory, although it was not perhaps the most murderous, 
was the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572, ordered, according 
to the historians, by Catherine de Medicis and Charles IX. 
</p><p>One does not require a very profound knowledge of 
psychology to realise that no sovereign could have ordered such 
an event.  St. Bartholomew's Day was not a royal but a popular 
crime.  Catherine de Medicis, believing her existence and that of

the king threatened by a plot directed by four or five Protestant

leaders then in Paris, sent men to kill them in their houses, 
according to the summary fashion of the time.  The massacre which

followed is very well explained by M. Battifol in the following 
terms:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;At the report of what was afoot the rumour 
immediately ran through Paris that the Huguenots were being 
massacred; Catholic gentlemen, soldiers of the guard, archers, 
men of the people, in short all Paris, rushed into the streets, 
arms in hand, in order to participate in the execution, and the 
general massacre commenced, to the sound of ferocious 
 
 
<pb n="44"/>  
cries of `The Huguenots! Kill, kill!'  They were struck down, 
they were drowned, they were hanged.  All that were known as 
heretics were so served.  Two thousand persons were killed in 
Paris.&rdquo; 
</p><p>By contagion, the people of the provinces imitated those 
of Paris, and six to eight thousand Protestants were slain. 
</p><p>When time had somewhat cooled religious passions, all the 
historians, even the Catholics, spoke of St. Bartholomew's Day 
with indignation.  They thus showed how difficult it is for the 
mentality of one epoch to understand that of another. 
</p><p>Far from being criticised, St. Bartholomew's Day provoked 
an indescribable enthusiasm throughout the whole of Catholic 
Europe.  Philip II. was delirious with joy when he heard the 
news, and the King of France received more congratulations than 
if he had won a great battle. 
</p><p>But it was Pope Gregory XIII. above all who manifested the

keenest satisfaction.  He had a medal struck to commemorate the 
happy event,<ref target="n2">2</ref> ordered joy-fires to be lit and 
cannon fired, celebrated several masses, and sent for the 
painter Vasari to depict on the walls of the Vatican the 
principal 
 

<pb n="45"/>  
scenes of carnage.  Further, he sent to the King of France an 
ambassador instructed to felicitate that monarch upon his fine 
action.  It is historical details of this kind that enable us to 
comprehend the mind of the believer.  The Jacobins of the Terror 
had a mentality very like that of Gregory XIII. 
</p><p>Naturally the Protestants were not indifferent to such a 
hecatomb, and they made such progress that in 1576 Henri III. was 
reduced to granting them, by the Edict of Beaulieu, entire 
liberty of worship, eight strong places, and, in the Parliaments, 
Chambers composed half of Catholics and half of Huguenots. 
</p><p>These forced concessions did not lead to peace.  A 
Catholic League was created, having the Duke of Guise at its 
head, and the conflict continued.  But it could not last for 
ever.  We know how Henri IV. put an end to it, at least for a 
time, by his abjuration in 1593, and by the Edict of Nantes. 
</p><p>The struggle was quieted but not terminated.  Under Louis 
XIII. the Protestants were still restless, and in 1627 Richelieu 
was obliged to besiege La Rochelle, where 15,000 Protestants 
perished.  Afterwards, possessing more political than religious 
feeling, the famous Cardinal proved extremely tolerant toward the

Reformers. 
</p><p>This tolerance could not last.  Contrary beliefs cannot 
come into contact without seeking to annihilate each other, as 
soon as one feels capable of dominating the other.  Under Louis 
XIV. the Protestants had become by far the weaker, and were 
forced to renounce the struggle and live at peace.  Their number 
was then about 1,200,000, and they possessed more than 600 
churches, served by about 700 pastors. 
 
 
<pb n="46"/>  
The presence of these heretics on French soil was intolerable to 
the Catholic clergy, who endeavoured to persecute them in various

ways.  As these persecutions had little result, Louis XIV. 
resorted to dragonnading them in 1685, when many individuals 
perished, but without further result.  Under the pressure of the 
clergy, notably of Bossuett, the Edict of Nantes was revoked, and

the Protestants were forced to accept conversion or to leave 
France.  This disastrous emigration lasted a long time, and is 
said to have cost France 400,000 inhabitants, men of notable 
energy, since they had the courage to listen to their conscience 
rather than their interests. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="6" id="d26"> 
<head>6.  <hi rend="italic">The results of Religious Revolutions</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>If religious revolutions were judged only by the gloomy story 
of the Reformation, we should be forced to regard them as highly 
disastrous.  But all have not played a like part, the civilising 
influence of certain among them being considerable. 
</p><p>By giving a people moral unity they greatly increase its 
material power.  We see this notably when a new faith, brought by

Mohammed, transforms the petty and impotent tribes of Arabia into

a formidable nation. 
</p><p>Such a new religious belief does not merely render a 
people homogeneous.  It attains a result that no philosophy, no 
code ever attained: it sensibly transforms what is almost 
unchangeable, the sentiments of a race. 
</p><p>We see this at the period when the most powerful religious

revolution recorded by history overthrew paganism to substitute a

God who came from the plains of Galilee.  The new ideal demanded 
the 
 
 
<pb n="47"/>  
renunciation of all the joys of existence in order to acquire the

eternal happiness of heaven.  No doubt such an ideal was readily 
accepted by the poor, the enslaved, the disinherited who were 
deprived of all the joys of life here below, to whom an 
enchanting future was offered in exchange for a life without 
hope.  But the austere existence so easily embraced by the poor 
was also embraced by the rich.  In this above all was the power 
of the new faith manifested. 
</p><p>Not only did the Christian revolution transform manners: 
it also exercised, for a space of two thousand years, a 
preponderating influence over civilisation.  Directly a religious

faith triumphs all the elements of civilisation naturally adapt 
themselves to it, so that civilisation is rapidly transformed. 
Writers, artists and philosophers merely symbolise, in their 
works, the ideas of the new faith. 
</p><p>When any religious or political faith whatsoever has 
triumphed, not only is reason powerless to affect it, but it even

finds motives which impel it to interpret and so justify the 
faith in question, and to strive to impose it upon others.  There

were probably as many theologians and orators in the time of 
Moloch, to prove the utility of human sacrifices, as there were 
at other periods to glorify the Inquisition, the massacre of St. 
Bartholomew, and the hecatombs of the Terror. 
</p><p>We must not hope to see peoples possessed by strong 
beliefs readily achieve tolerance.  The only people who attained 
to toleration in the ancient world were the polytheists.  The 
nations which practise toleration at the present time are those 
that might well be termed polytheistical, since, as in England 
and America, they are divided into innumerable sects. 
 
 
<pb n="48"/>  
Under identical names they really adore very different deities. 
</p><p>The multiplicity of beliefs which results in such 
toleration finally results also in weakness.  We therefore come 
to a psychological problem not hitherto resolved: how to possess 
a faith at once powerful and tolerant. 
</p><p>The foregoing brief explanation reveals the large part 
played by religious revolutions and the power of beliefs. 
Despite their slight rational value they shape history, and 
prevent the peoples from remaining a mass of individuals without 
cohesion or strength.  Man has needed them at all times to 
orientate his thought and guide his conduct.  No philosophy has 
as yet succeeded in replacing them.

THE ACTION OF GOVERNMENTS IN REVOLUTIONS 
</head> 
 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d28"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The feeble resistance of Governments in time of 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>MANY modern nations&mdash;France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Poland, 
Japan, Turkey, Portugal, &amp;c.&mdash;have known revolutions within the 
last century.  These were usually characterised by their 
instantaneous quality and the facility with which the governments

attacked were overthrown. 
</p><p>The instantaneous nature of these revolutions is explained

by the rapidity of mental contagion due to modern methods of 
publicity.  The slight resistance of the governments attacked is 
more surprising.  It implies a total inability to comprehend and 
foresee created by a blind confidence in their own strength. 
</p><p>The facility with which governments fall is not however a 
new phenomenon.  It has been proved more than once, not only in 
autocratic systems, which are always overturned by palace 
conspiracies, but also in governments perfectly instructed in the

state of public opinion by the press and their own agents. 
</p><p>Among these instantaneous downfalls one of the most 
striking was that which followed the Ordinances of Charles X. 
This monarch was, as we know, over 
 
 
<pb n="50"/>  
thrown in four days.  His minister Polignac had taken no measures

of defence, and the king was so confident of the tranquillity of 
Paris that he had gone hunting.  The army was not in the least 
hostile, as in the reign of Louis XVI., but the troops, badly 
officered, disbanded before the attacks of a few insurgents. 
</p><p>The overthrow of Louis-Philippe was still more typical, 
since it did not result from any arbitrary action on the part of 
the sovereign.  This monarch was not surrounded by the hatred 
which finally surrounded Charles X., and his fall was the result 
of an insignificant riot which could easily have been repressed. 
</p><p>Historians, who can hardly comprehend how a solidly 
constituted government, supported by an imposing army, can be 
overthrown by a few rioters, naturally attributed the fall of 
Louis-Philippe to deep-seated causes.  In reality the incapacity 
of the generals entrusted with his defence was the real cause of 
his fall. 
</p><p>This case is one of the most instructive that could be 
cited, and is worthy of a moment's consideration.  It has been 
perfectly investigated by General Bonnal, in the light of the 
notes of an eye-witness, General Elchingen.  Thirty-six thousand 
troops were then in Paris, but the weakness and incapacity of 
their officers made it impossible to use them.  Contradictory 
orders were given, and finally the troops were forbidden to fire 
on the people, who, moreover&mdash;and nothing could have been more 
dangerous&mdash;were permitted to mingle with the troops.  The riot 
succeeded without fighting and forced the king to abdicate. 
</p><p>Applying to the preceding case our knowledge of 
 
 
<pb n="51"/>  
the psychology of crowds, General Bonnal shows how easily the 
riot which overthrew Louis-Philippe could have been controlled. 
He proves, notably, that if the commanding officers had not 
completely lost their heads quite a small body of troops could 
have prevented the insurgents from invading the Chamber of 
Deputies.  This last, composed of monarchists, would certainly 
have proclaimed the Count of Paris under the regency of his 
mother. 
</p><p>Similar phenomena were observable in the revolutions of 
Spain and Portugal. 
</p><p>These facts show the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of petty accessory 
circumstances in great events, and prove that one must not speak 
too readily of the general laws of history.  Without the riot 
which overthrew Louis-Philippe, we should probably have seen 
neither the Republic of 1848, nor the Second Empire, nor Sedan, 
nor the invasion, nor the loss of Alsace. 
</p><p>In the revolutions of which I have just been speaking the 
army was of no assistance to the government, but did not turn 
against it.  It sometimes happens otherwise.  It is often the 
army which effects the revolution, as in Turkey and Portugal. 
The innumerable revolutions of the Latin republics of America are

effected by the army. 
</p><p>When a revolution is effected by an army the new rulers 
naturally fall under its domination.  I have already recalled the

fact that this was the case at the end of the Roman Empire, when 
the emperors were made and unmade by the soldiery. 
</p><p>The same thing has sometimes been witnessed in modern 
times.  The following extract from a news 
 
 
<pb n="52"/>  
paper, with reference to the Greek revolution, shows what becomes

of a government dominated by its army:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;One day it was announced that eighty officers of the 
navy would send in their resignations if the government did not 
dismiss the leaders of whom they complained.  Another time it was

the agricultural labourers on a farm (<hi rend="italic">metairie</hi>) belonging 
to the Crown Prince who demanded the partition of the soil among 
them.  The navy protested against the promotion promised to 
Colonel Zorbas.  Colonel Zorbas, after a week of discussion with 
Lieutenant Typaldos, treated with the President of the Council as

one power with another.  During this time the Federation of the 
corporations abused the officers of the navy.  A deputy demanded 
that these officers and their families should be treated as 
brigands.  When Commander Miaoulis fired on the rebels, the 
sailors, who first of all had obeyed Typaldos, returned to duty. 
This is no longer the harmonious Greece of Pericles and 
Themistocles.  It is a hideous camp of Agramant.&rdquo; 
</p><p>A revolution cannot be effected without the assistance or 
at least the neutrality of the army, but it often happens that 
the movement commences without it.  This was the case with the 
revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and that of 1870, which overthrew 
the Empire after the humiliation of France by the surrender of 
Sedan. 
</p><p>The majority of revolutions take place in the capitals, 
and by means of contagion spread through the country; but this is

not a constant rule.  We know that during the French Revolution 
La Vend&eacute;e, 

 
 
<pb n="53"/>  

Brittany, and the Midi revolted spontaneously against Paris.

Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>In the greater number of the revolutions enumerated above, we 
have seen governments perish by their weakness.  As soon as they 
were touched they fell. 
</p><p>The Russian Revolution proved that a government which 
defends itself energetically may finally triumph. 
</p><p>Never was revolution more menacing to the government. 
After the disasters suffered in the Orient, and the severities of

a too oppressive autocratic <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, all classes of 
society, including a portion of the army and the fleet, had 
revolted.  The railways, posts, and telegraph services had 
struck, so that communications between the various portions of 
the vast empire were interrupted. 
</p><p>The rural class itself, forming the majority of the 
nation, began to feel the influence of the revolutionary 
propaganda.  The lot of the peasants was wretched.  They were 
obliged, by the system of the <hi rend="italic">mir</hi>, to cultivate soil which

they could not acquire.  The government resolved immediately to 
conciliate this large class of peasants by turning them into 
proprietors.  Special laws forced the landlords to sell the 
peasants a portion of their lands, and banks intended to lend the

buyers the necessary purchase-money were created.  The sums lent 
were to be repaid by small annuities deducted from the product of

the sale of the crops. 
</p><p>Assured of the neutrality of the peasants, the government 
could contend with the fanatics who 
 
 
<pb n="54"/>  
were burning the towns, throwing bombs among the crowds, and 
waging a merciless warfare.  All those who could be taken were 
killed.  Such extermination is the only method discovered since 
the beginning of the world by which a society can be protected 
against the rebels who wish to destroy it. 
</p><p>The victorious government understood moreover the 
necessity of satisfying the legitimate claims of the enlightened 
portion of the nation.  It created a parliament instructed to 
prepare laws and control expenditure. 
</p><p>The history of the Russian Revolution shows us how a 
government, all of whose natural supports have crumbled in 
succession, can, with wisdom and firmness, triumph over the most 
formidable obstacles.  It has been very justly said that 
governments are not overthrown, but that they commit suicide.

<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Revolutions effected by Governments.&mdash;Examples: 
China, Turkey, &amp;c</hi>. </head> 
 
<p>Governments almost invariably fight revolutions; they hardly 
ever create them.  Representing the needs of the moment and 
general opinion, they follow the reformers timidly; they do not 
precede them.  Sometimes, however, certain governments have 
attempted those sudden reforms which we know as revolutions.  The

stability or instability of the national mind decrees the success

or failure of such attempts. 
</p><p>They succeed when the people on whom the government seeks 
to impose new institutions is composed of semi-barbarous tribes, 
without fixed laws, without solid traditions; that is to say, 
without a settled 
 
 
<pb n="55"/>  
national mind.  Such was the condition of Russia in the days of 
Peter the Great.  We know how he sought to Europeanise the semi-Asiatic populations by means of force. 
</p><p>Japan is another example of a revolution effected by a 
government, but it was her machinery, not her mind that was 
reformed. 
</p><p>It needs a very powerful autocrat, seconded by a man of 
genius, to succeed, even partially, in such a task.  More often 
than not the reformer finds that the whole people rises up 
against him.  Then, to the contrary of what befalls in an 
ordinary revolution, the autocrat is revolutionary and the people

is conservative.  But an attentive study will soon show you that 
the peoples are always extremely conservative. 
</p><p>Failure is the rule with these attempts.  Whether effected

by the upper classes or the lower, revolutions do not change the 
souls of peoples that have been a long time established.  They 
only change those things that are worn by time and ready to fall.

</p><p>China is at the present time making a very interesting but

impossible experiment, in seeking, by means of the government, 
suddenly to renew the institutions of the country.  The 
revolution which overturned the dynasty of her ancient sovereigns

was the indirect consequence of the discontent provoked by 
reforms which the government had sought to impose with a view to 
ameliorating the condition of China.  The suppression of opium 
and gaming, the reform of the army, and the creation of schools, 
involved an increase of taxation which, as well as the reforms 
themselves, greatly indisposed the general opinion. 
 
 
<pb n="56"/>  </p><p> 
 
A few cultured Chinese educated in the schools of Europe profited

by this discontent to raise the people and proclaim a republic, 
an institution of which the Chinese could have had no conception.

</p><p>It surely cannot long survive, for the impulse which has 
given birth to it is not a movement of progress, but of reaction.

The word republic, to the Chinaman intellectualised by his 
European education, is simply synonymous with the rejection of 
the yoke of laws, rules, and long-established restraints. 
Cutting off his pigtail, covering his head with a cap, and 
calling himself a Republican, the young Chinaman thinks to give 
the rein to all his instincts.  This is more or less the idea of 
a republic that a large part of the French people entertained at 
the time of the great Revolution. 
</p><p>China will soon discover the fate that awaits a society 
deprived of the armour slowly wrought by the past.  After a few 
years of bloody anarchy it will be necessary to establish a power

whose tyranny will inevitably be far severer than that which was 
overthrown.  Science has not yet discovered the magic ring 
capable of saving a society without discipline.  There is no need

to impose discipline when it has become hereditary, but when the 
primitive instincts have been allowed to destroy the barriers 
painfully erected by slow ancestral labours, they cannot be 
reconstituted save by an energetic tyranny. 
</p><p>As a proof of these assertions we may instance an 
experiment analogous to that undertaken by China; that recently 
attempted by Turkey.  A few years ago young men instructed in 
European schools and full of good intentions succeeded, with the 
aid of a 
 
 
<pb n="57"/>  
number of officers, in overthrowing a Sultan whose tyranny seemed

insupportable.  Having acquired our robust Latin faith in the 
magic power of formul&aelig;, they thought they could establish 
the representative system in a country half-civilised, profoundly

divided by religious hatred, and peopled by divers races. 
</p><p>The attempt has not prospered hitherto.  The authors of 
the reformation had to learn that despite their liberalism they 
were forced to govern by methods very like those employed by the 
government overthrown.  They could neither prevent summary 
executions nor wholesale massacres of Christians, nor could they 
remedy a single abuse. 
</p><p>It would be unjust to reproach them.  What in truth could 
they have done to change a people whose traditions have been 
fixed so long, whose religious passions are so intense, and whose

Mohammedans, although in the minority, legitimately claim to 
govern the sacred city of their faith according to their code? 
How prevent Islam from remaining the State religion in a country 
where civil law and religious law are not yet plainly separated, 
and where faith in the Koran is the only tie by which the idea of

nationality can be maintained? 
</p><p>It was difficult to destroy such a state of affairs, so 
that we were bound to see the re-establishment of an autocratic 
organisation with an appearance of constitutionalism&mdash;that is to 
say, practically the old system once again.  Such attempts afford

a good example of the fact that a people cannot choose its 
institutions until it has transformed its mind. 
 
 
<pb n="58"/>  
 
 
 
4.  <hi rend="italic">Social elements which survive the changes of 
Government after Revolution</hi>. 
 
</p><p>What we shall say later on as to the stable foundation of 
the national soul will enable us to appreciate the force of 
systems of government that have been long established, such as 
ancient monarchies.  A monarch may easily be overthrown by 
conspirators, but these latter are powerless against the 
principles which the monarch represents.  Napoleon at his fall 
was replaced not by his natural heir, but by the heir of kings. 
The latter incarnated an ancient principle, while the son of the 
Emperor personified ideas that were as yet imperfectly 
established in men's minds. 
</p><p>For the same reason a minister, however able, however 
great the services he has rendered to his country, can very 
rarely overthrow his Sovereign.  Bismarck himself could not have 
done so.  This great minister had single-handed created the unity

of Germany, yet his master had only to touch him with his finger 
and he vanished.  A man is as nothing before a principle 
supported by opinion. 
</p><p>But even when, for various reasons, the principle 
incarnated by a government is annihilated with that government, 
as happened at the time of the French Revolution, all the 
elements of social organisation do not perish at the same time. 
</p><p>If we knew nothing of France but the disturbances of the 
last hundred years and more we might suppose the country to live 
in a state of profound anarchy.  Now her economic, industrial, 
and even her political life manifests, on the contrary, a 
continuity that seems to be independent of all revolutions and 
governments. 
 
 
<pb n="59"/> </p><p> 
 
The fact is that beside the great events of which history treats 
are the little facts of daily life which the books neglect to 
tell.  They are ruled by imperious necessities which halt for no 
man.  Their total mass forms the real framework of the life of 
the people. 
</p><p>While the study of great events shows us that the nominal 
government of France has been frequently changed in the space of 
a century, an examination of the little daily events will prove, 
on the contrary, that her real government has been little 
altered. 
</p><p>Who in truth are the real rulers of a people?  Kings and 
ministers, no doubt, in the great crises of national life, but 
they play no part whatever in the little realities which make up 
the life of every day.  The real directing forces of a country 
are the administrations, composed of impersonal elements which 
are never affected by the changes of government.  Conservative of

traditions, they are anonymous and lasting, and constitute an 
occult power before which all others must eventually bow.  Their 
action has even increased to such a degree that, as we shall 
presently show, there is a danger that they may form an anonymous

State more powerful than the official State.  France has thus 
come to be governed by heads of departments and government 
clerks.  The more we study the history of revolutions the more we

discover that they change practically nothing but the label.  To 
create a revolution is easy, but to change the soul of a people 
is difficult indeed.

THE PART PLAYED BY THE PEOPLE IN 
REVOLUTIONS 
</head> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d32"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The stability and malleability of the national 
mind</hi>.</head> 
 
 
<p>THE knowledge of a people at any given moment of its history 
involves an understanding of its environment and above all of its

past.  Theoretically one may deny that past, as did the men of 
the Revolution, as many men of the present day have done, but its

influence remains indestructible. 
</p><p>In the past, built up by slow accumulations of centuries, 
was formed the aggregation of thoughts, sentiments, traditions, 
and prejudices constituting the national mind which makes the 
strength of a race.  Without it no progress is possible.  Each 
generation would necessitate a fresh beginning. 
</p><p>The aggregate composing the soul of a people is solidly 
established only if it possesses a certain rigidity, but this 
rigidity must not pass a certain limit, or there would be no such

thing as malleability. 
</p><p>Without rigidity the ancestral soul would have no fixity, 
and without malleability it could not adapt itself to the changes

of environment resulting from the progress of civilization. 
</p><p>Excessive malleability of the national mind impels a 
people to incessant revolutions.  Excess of rigidity 
 
 
<pb n="61"/>  
leads it to decadence.  Living species, like the races of 
humanity, disappear when, too fixedly established by a long past,

they become incapable of adapting themselves to new conditions of

existence. 
</p><p>Few peoples have succeeded in effecting a just equilibrium

between these two contrary qualities of stability and 
malleability.  The Romans in antiquity and the English in modern 
times may be cited among those who have best attained it. 
</p><p>The peoples whose mind is most fixed and established often

effect the most violent revolutions.  Not having succeeded in 
evolving progressively, in adapting themselves to changes of 
environment, they are forced to adapt themselves violently when 
such adaptation becomes indispensable. 
</p><p>Stability is only acquired very slowly.  The history of a 
race is above all the story of its long efforts to establish its 
mind.  So long as it has not succeeded it forms a horde of 
barbarians without cohesion and strength.  After the invasions of

the end of the Roman Empire France took several centuries to form

a national soul. 
</p><p>She finally achieved one; but in the course of centuries 
this soul finally became too rigid.  With a little more 
malleability, the ancient monarchy would have been slowly 
transformed as it was elsewhere, and we should have avoided, 
together with the Revolution and its consequences, the heavy task

of remaking a national soul. 
</p><p>The preceding considerations show us the part of race in 
the genesis of revolutions, and explain why the same revolutions 
will produce such different effects in different countries; why, 
for example, the ideas of the 
 
 
<pb n="62"/>  
French Revolution, welcomed with such enthusiasm by some peoples,

were rejected by others. 
</p><p>Certainly England, although a very stable country, has 
suffered two revolutions and slain a king; but the mould of her 
mental armour was at once stable enough to retain the 
acquisitions of the past and malleable enough to modify them only

within the necessary limits.  Never did England dream, as did the

men of the French Revolution, of destroying the ancestral 
heritage in order to erect a new society in the name of reason. 
</p><p>&ldquo;While the Frenchman,&rdquo; writes M. A. Sorel, 
&ldquo;despised his government, detested his clergy, hated the 
nobility, and revolted against the laws, the Englishman was proud

of his religion, his constitution, his aristocracy, his House of 
Lords.  These were like so many towers of the formidable Bastille

in which he entrenched himself, under the British standard, to 
judge Europe and cover her with contempt.  He admitted that the 
command was disputed inside the fort, but no stranger must 
approach.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The influence of race in the destiny of the peoples 
appears plainly in the history of the perpetual revolutions of 
the Spanish republics of South America.  Composed of half-castes,

that is to say, of individuals whose diverse heredities have 
dissociated their ancestral characteristics, these populations 
have no national soul and therefore no stability.  A people of 
half-castes is always ungovernable. 
</p><p>If we would learn more of the differences of political 
capacity which the racial factor creates we must examine the same

nation as governed by two races successively. 
 
 
<pb n="63"/> </p><p> 
 
</p><p>The event is not rare in history.  It has been manifested 
in a striking manner of late in Cuba and the Phillipines, which 
passed suddenly from the rule of Spain to that of the United 
States. 
</p><p>We know in what anarchy and poverty Cuba existed under 
Spanish rule; we know, too, to what a degree of prosperity the 
island was brought in a few years when it fell into the hands of 
the United States. 
</p><p>The same experience was repeated in the Phillipines, which

for centuries had been governed by Spain.  Finally the country 
was no more than a vast jungle, the home of epidemics of every 
kind, where a miserable population vegetated without commerce or 
industry.  After a few years of American rule the country was 
entirely transformed: malaria, yellow fever, plague and cholera 
had entirely disappeared.  The swamps were drained; the country 
was covered with railways, factories and schools.  In thirteen 
years the mortality was reduced by two-thirds. 
</p><p>It is to such examples that we must refer the theorist who

has not yet grasped the profound significance of the word race, 
and how far the ancestral soul of a people rules over its 
destiny. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d33"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">How the people regards Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The part of the people has been the same in all revolutions. 
It is never the people that conceives them nor directs them.  Its

activity is released by means of leaders. 
</p><p>Only when the direct interests of the people are involved 
do we see, as recently in Champagne, any fraction of the people 
rising spontaneously.  A movement thus localised constitutes a 
mere riot. 
 
 
<pb n="64"/> </p><p> 
 
</p><p>Revolution is easy when the leaders are very influential. 
Of this Portugal and Brazil have recently furnished proofs.  But 
new ideas penetrate the people very slowly indeed.  Generally it 
accepts a revolution without knowing why, and when by chance it 
does succeed in understanding why, the revolution is over long 
ago. 
</p><p>The people will create a revolution because it is 
persuaded to do so, but it does not understand very much of the 
ideas of its leaders; it interprets them in its own fashion, and 
this fashion is by no means that of the true authors of the 
revolution.  The French Revolution furnished a striking example 
of this fact. 
</p><p>The Revolution of 1789 had as its real object the 
substitution of the power of the nobility by that of the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie;</hi> that is, an old <hi rend="italic">&eacute;lite</hi> which had

become incapable was to be replaced by a new <hi rend="italic">&eacute;lite</hi> 
which did possess capacity. 
</p><p>There was little question of the people in this first 
phase of the Revolution.  The sovereignty of the people was 
proclaimed, but it amounted only to the right of electing its 
representatives. 
</p><p>Extremely illiterate, not hoping, like the middle classes,

to ascend the social scale, not in any way feeling itself the 
equal of the nobles, and not aspiring ever to become their equal,

the people had views and interests very different to those of the

upper classes of society. 
</p><p>The struggles of the assembly with the royal power led it 
to call for the intervention of the people in these struggles. 
It intervened more and more, and the bourgeois revolution rapidly

became a popular revolution. 
 
 
<pb n="65"/>  
 
</p><p>An idea having no force of its own, and acting only by 
virtue of possessing an affective and mystic substratum which 
supports it, the theoretical ideas of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, 
before they could act on the people, had to be transformed into a

new and very definite faith, springing from obvious practical 
interests. 
</p><p>This transformation was rapidly effected when the people 
heard the men envisaged by it as the Government assuring it that 
it was the equal of its former masters.  It began to regard 
itself as a victim, and proceeded to pillage, burn, and massacre,

imagining that in so doing it was exercising a right. 
</p><p>The great strength of the revolutionary principles was 
that they gave a free course to the instincts of primitive 
barbarity which had been restrained by the secular and inhibitory

action of environment, tradition, and law. 
</p><p>All the social bonds that formerly contained the multitude

were day by day dissolving, so that it conceived a notion of 
unlimited power, and the joy of seeing its ancient masters 
ferreted out and despoiled.  Having become the sovereign people, 
were not all things permissible to it? 
</p><p>The motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, a true 
manifestation of hope and faith at the beginning of the 
Revolution, soon merely served to cover a legal justification of 
the sentiments of jealousy, cupidity, and hatred of superiors, 
the true motives of crowds unrestrained by discipline.  This is 
why the Revolution so soon ended in disorder, violence, and 
anarchy. 
</p><p>From the moment when the Revolution descended from the 
middle to the lower classes of society, it ceased to be a 
domination of the instinctive by the 
 
 
<pb n="66"/>  
rational, and became, on the contrary, the effort of the 
instinctive to overpower the rational. 
</p><p>This legal triumph of the atavistic instincts was 
terrible.  The whole effort of societies an effort indispensable 
to their continued existence&mdash;had always been to restrain, thanks

to the power of tradition, customs, and codes, certain natural 
instincts which man has inherited from his primitive animality. 
It is possible to dominate them&mdash;and the more a people does 
overcome them the more civilised it is&mdash;but they cannot be 
destroyed.  The influence of various exciting causes will readily

result in their reappearance. 
</p><p>This is why the liberation of popular passions is so 
dangerous.  The torrent, once escaped from its bed, does not 
return until it has spread devastation far and wide.  &ldquo;Woe to

him who stirs up the dregs of a nation,&rdquo; said Rivarol at the 
beginning of the Revolution.  &ldquo;There is no age of 
enlightenment for the populace.&rdquo; 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d34"> 
<head><hi rend="italic">The supposed Part of the People during 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The laws of the psychology of crowds show us that the people 
never acts without leaders, and that although it plays a 
considerable part in revolutions by following and exaggerating 
the impulses received, it never directs its own movements. 
</p><p>In all political revolutions we discover the action of 
leaders.  They do not create the ideas which serve as the basis 
of revolutions, but they utilise them as a means of action. 
Ideas, leaders, armies, and crowds constitute four elements which

all have their part to play in revolutions. 
 
 
<pb n="67"/>  
 
The crowd, roused by the leaders, acts especially by means of its

mass.  Its action is comparable to that of the shell which 
perforates an armour-plate by the momentum of a force it did not 
create.  Rarely does the crowd understand anything of the 
revolutions accomplished with its assistance.  It obediently 
follows its leaders without even trying to find out what they 
want.  It overthrew Charles X. because of his Ordinances without 
having any idea of the contents of the latter, and would have 
been greatly embarrassed had it been asked at a later date why it

overthrew Louis-Philippe. 
</p><p>Deceived by appearances, many authors, from Michelet to 
Aulard, have supposed that the people effected our great 
Revolution. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The principal actor,&rdquo; said Michelet, &ldquo;is the 
people.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It is an error to say,&rdquo; writes M. Aulard, 
&ldquo;that the French Revolution was effected by a few 
distinguished people or a few heroes. . . .  I believe that in 
the whole history of the period included between 1789 and 1799 
not a single person stands out who led or shaped events: 
neither Louis XVI. nor Mirabeau nor Danton nor Robespierre. 
Must we say that it was the French people that was the real 
hero of the French Revolution?  Yes&mdash;provided we see the 
French people not as a multitude but as a number of 
organised groups.&rdquo; 
</p><p>And in a recent work M. A. Cochin insists on this 
conception of popular action. 
</p><p>&ldquo;And here is the wonder:  Michelet is right.  In 
proportion as we know them better the facts seem to consecrate 
the fiction: this crowd, without chiefs and without laws, the 
very image of chaos, did for five years govern and command, speak

and act, with a precision, 
 
 
<pb n="68"/>  
a consistency, and an entirety that were marvellous.  Anarchy 
gave lessons in order and discipline to the defeated party of 
order . . . twenty-five millions of men, spread over an area of 
30,000 square leagues, acted as one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Certainly if this simultaneous conduct of the people had 
been spontaneous, as the author supposes, it would have been 
marvellous.  M. Aulard himself understands very well the 
impossibilities of such a phenomenon, for he is careful, in 
speaking of the people, to say that he is speaking of groups, and

that these groups may have been guided by leaders:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;And what, then, cemented the national unity?  Who 
saved this nation, attacked by the king and rent by civil war? 
Was it Danton?  Was it Robespierre?  Was it Carnot?  Certainly 
these individual men were of service: but unity was in fact 
maintained and independence assured by the grouping of the French

into communes and popular societies&mdash;people's clubs.  It was the 
municipal and Jacobin organisation of France that forced the 
coalition of Europe to retreat.  But in each group, if we look 
more closely, there were two or three individuals more capable 
than the rest, who, whether leaders or led, executed decisions 
and had the appearance of leaders, but who (if, for instance, we 
read the proceedings of the people's clubs) seem to us to have 
drawn their strength far more from their group than from 
themselves. 
</p><p>M. Aulard's mistake consists in supposing that all these 
groups were derived &ldquo;from a spontaneous movement of 
fraternity and reason.&rdquo;  France at that time was covered with

thousands of little clubs, 
 
 
<pb n="69"/>  
receiving a single impulsion from the great Jacobin Club of 
Paris, and obeying it with perfect docility.  This is what 
reality teaches us, though the illusions of the Jacobins do not 
permit them to accept the fact.<ref target="n3">3</ref>

<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d35"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">The Popular Entity and its Constituent 
Elements</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>In order to answer to certain theoretical conceptions the 
people was erected into a mystic entity, endowed with all the 
powers and all the virtues, incessantly praised by the 
politicians, and overwhelmed with flattery.  We shall see what we

are to make of this conception of the part played by the people 
in the French Revolution. 
</p><p>To the Jacobins of this epoch, as to those of our own 
days, this popular entity constitutes a superior personality 
possessing the attributes, peculiar to divinities, of never 
having to answer for its actions and never making a mistake.  Its

wishes must be 
 
 
<pb n="70"/>  
humbly acceded.  The people may kill, burn, ravage, commit the 
most frightful cruelties, glorify its hero to-day and throw him 
into the gutter to-morrow; it is all one; the politicians will 
not cease to vaunt its virtues, its high wisdom, and to bow to 
its every decision.<ref target="n4">4</ref> 
</p><p>Now in what does this entity really consist, this 
mysterious fetich which revolutionists have revered for more than

a century? 
</p><p>It may be decomposed into two distinct categories.  The 
first includes the peasants, traders, and workers of all sorts 
who need tranquillity and order that they may exercise their 
calling.  This people forms the majority, but a majority which 
never caused a revolution.  Living in laborious silence, it is 
ignored by the historians. 
</p><p>The second category, which plays a capital part in all 
national disturbances, consists of a subversive social residue 
dominated by a criminal mentality.  Degenerates of alcoholism and

poverty, thieves, beggars, destitute &ldquo;casuals,&rdquo; 
indifferent workers without employment&mdash;these constitute the 
dangerous bulk of the 
armies of insurrection. 
</p><p>The fear of punishment prevents many of them from becoming

criminals at ordinary times, but they do become criminals as soon

as they can exercise their evil instincts without danger. 
 
 
<pb n="71"/>  
 
</p><p>To this sinister substratum are due the massacres which 
stain all revolutions. 
</p><p>It was this class which, guided by its leaders, 
continually invaded the great revolutionary Assemblies.  These 
regiments of disorder had no other ideal than that of massacre, 
pillage, and incendiarism.  Their indifference to theories and 
principles was complete. 
</p><p>To the elements recruited from the lowest dregs of the 
populace are added, by way of contagion, a host of idle and 
indifferent persons who are simply drawn into the movement.  They

shout because there are men shouting, and revolt because there is

a revolt, without having the vaguest idea of the cause of 
shouting or revolution.  The suggestive power of their 
environment absolutely hypnotises them, and impels them to 
action. 
</p><p>These noisy and maleficent crowds, the kernel of all 
insurrections, from antiquity to our own times, are the only 
crowds known to the orator.  To the orator they are the sovereign

people.  As a matter of fact this sovereign people is principally

composed of the lower populace of whom Thiers said:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Since the time when Tacitus saw it applaud the crimes

of the emperors the vile populace has not changed.  These 
barbarians who swarm at the bottom of societies are always ready 
to stain the people with every crime, at the beck of every power,

and to the dishonour of every cause.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At no period of history was the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of the 
lowest elements of the population exercised in such a lasting 
fashion as in the French Revolution. 
</p><p>The massacres began as soon as the beast was unchained&mdash; 
that is, from 1789, long before the 
 
 
<pb n="72"/>  
Convention.  They were carried out with all possible refinements 
of cruelty.  During the killing of September the prisoners were 
slowly chopped to bits by sabre-cuts in order to prolong their 
agonies and amuse the spectators, who experienced the greatest 
delight before the spectacle of the convulsions of the victims 
and their shrieks of agony. 
</p><p>Similar scenes were observed all over France, even in the 
early days of the Revolution, although the foreign war did not 
excuse them then, nor any other pretext. 
</p><p>From March to September a whole series of burnings, 
killings, and pillagings drenched all France in blood.  Taine 
cites one hundred and twenty such cases.  Rouen, Lyons, 
Strasbourg, &amp;c., fell into the power of the populace. 
</p><p>The Mayor of Troyes, his eyes destroyed by blows of 
scissors, was murdered after hours of suffering.  The Colonel of 
Dragoons Belzuce was cut to pieces while living.  In many places 
the hearts of the victims were torn out and carried about the 
cities on the point of a pike. 
</p><p>Such is the behaviour of the base populace so soon as 
imprudent hands have broken the network of constraints which 
binds its ancestral savagery.  It meets with every indulgence 
because it is in the interests of the politicians to flatter it. 
But let us for a moment suppose the thousands of beings who 
constitute it condensed into one single being.  The personality 
thus formed would appear as a cruel and narrow and abominable 
monster, more horrible than the bloodiest tyrants of history. 
</p><p>This impulsive and ferocious people has always 
 
 
<pb n="73"/>  
been easily dominated so soon as a strong power has opposed it. 
If its violence is unlimited, so is its servility.  All the 
despotisms have had it for their servant.  The C&aelig;sars are 
certain of being acclaimed by it, whether they are named 
Caligula, Nero, Marat, Robespierre, or Boulanger. 
</p><p>Beside these destructive hordes whose action during 
revolution is capital, there exists, as we have already remarked,

the mass of the true people, which asks only the right to labour.

It sometimes benefits by revolutions, but never causes them.  The

revolutionary theorists know little of it and distrust it, aware 
of its traditional and conservative basis.  The resistant nucleus

of a country, it makes the strength and continuity of the latter.

Extremely docile through fear, easily influenced by its leaders, 
it will momentarily commit every excess while under their 
influence, but the ancestral inertia of the race will soon take 
charge again, which is the reason why it so quickly tires of 
revolution.  Its traditional soul quickly incites it to oppose 
itself to anarchy when the latter goes too far.  At such times it

seeks the leader who will restore order. 
</p><p>This people, resigned and peaceable, has evidently no very

lofty nor complicated political conceptions.  Its governmental 
ideal is always very simple, is something very like dictatorship.

This is why, from the times of the Greeks to our own, 
dictatorship has always followed anarchy.  It followed it after 
the first Revolution, when Bonaparte was acclaimed, and again 
when, despite opposition, four successive plebiscites raised 
Louis Napoleon to the head of the republic, ratified his <hi rend="italic">coup 
d &Eacute;tat</hi>, re-established the Empire, and in 1870, before

the war, approved of his rule. 
 
 
<pb n="74"/> </p><p> 
 
 </p><p>Doubtless in these last instances the people was 
deceived.  But without the revolutionary conspiracies which led 
to disorder, it would not have been impelled to seek the means of

escape therefrom. 
</p><p>The facts recalled in this chapter must not be forgotten 
if we wish fully to comprehend the various <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;les</hi> of 
the people during revolution.  Its action is considerable, but 
very unlike that imagined by the legends whose repetition alone 
constitutes their vitality.

INDIVIDUAL VARIATIONS OF CHARACTER IN 
TIME OF REVOLUTION 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d38"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Transformations of Personality</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>I HAVE dwelt at length elsewhere upon a certain theory of 
character, without which it is absolutely impossible to 
understand divers transformations or inconsistencies of conduct 
which occur at certain moments, notably in time of revolution. 
Here are the principal points of this theory: 
</p><p>Every individual possesses, besides his habitual 
mentality, which, when the environment does not alter, is almost 
constant, various possibilities of character which may be evoked 
by passing events. 
</p><p>The people who surround us are the creatures of certain 
circumstances, but not of all circumstances.  Our ego consists of

the association of innumerable cellular egos, the residues of 
ancestral personalities.  By their combination they form an 
equilibrium which is fairly permanent when the social environment

does not vary.  As soon as this environment is considerably 
 
 
<pb n="76"/>  
modified, as in time of insurrection, this equilibrium is broken,

and the dissociated elements constitute, by a fresh aggregation, 
a new personality, which is manifested by ideas, feelings, and 
actions very different from those formerly observed in the same 
individual.  Thus it is that during the Terror we see honest 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> and peaceful magistrates who were noted for 
their kindness turned into bloodthirsty fanatics. 
</p><p>Under the influence of environment the old personality may

therefore give place to one entirely new.  For this reason the 
actors in great religious and political crises often seem of a 
different essence to ourselves; yet they do not differ from us; 
the repetition of the same events would bring back the same men. 
</p><p>Napoleon perfectly understood these possibilities of 
character when he said, in Saint Helena:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It is because I know just how great a part chance 
plays in our political decisions, that I have always been without

prejudices, and very indulgent as to the part men have taken 
during our disturbances. . . .  In time of revolution one can 
only say what one has done; it would not be wise to say that one 
could not have done otherwise. . . .  Men are difficult to 
understand if we want to be just. . . .  Do they know themselves?

Do they account for themselves very clearly?  There are virtues 
and vices of circumstance.&rdquo; 
</p><p>When the normal personality has been disaggregated under 
the influence of certain events, how does the new personality 
form itself?  By several means, the most active of which is the 
acquisition of a strong belief.  This orientates all the elements

of the understanding, 
 
 
<pb n="77"/>  
as the magnet collects into regular curves the filings of a 
magnetic metal. 
</p><p>Thus were formed the personalities observed in times of 
great crises: the Crusades, the Reformation, the Revolution 
notably. 
</p><p>At normal times the environment varies little, so that as 
a rule we see only a single personality in the individuals that 
surround us.  Sometimes, however, it happens that we observe 
several, which in certain circumstances may replace one another. 
</p><p>These personalities may be contradictory and even 
inimical.  This phenomenon, exceptional under normal conditions, 
is considerably accentuated in certain pathological conditions. 
Morbid psychology has recorded several examples of multiple 
personality in a single subject, such as the cases cited by 
Morton Prince and Pierre Janet. 
</p><p>In all these variations of personality it is not the 
intelligence which is modified, but the feelings, whose 
association forms the character. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d39"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Elements of Character Predominant in Time of 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>During revolution we see several sentiments developed which 
are commonly repressed, but to which the destruction of social 
constraints gives a free vent. 
</p><p>These constraints, consisting of the law, morality, and 
tradition, are not always completely broken.  Some survive the 
upheaval and serve to some extent to damp the explosion of 
dangerous sentiments. 
</p><p>The most powerful of these restraints is the soul of the 
race.  This determines a manner of seeing, feeling, 
 
 
<pb n="78"/>  
and willing common to the majority of the individuals of the same

people; it constitutes a hereditary custom, and nothing is more 
powerful than the ties of custom. 
</p><p>This racial influence limits the variations of a people 
and determines its destiny within certain limits in spite of all 
superficial changes. 
</p><p>For example, to take only the instances of history, it 
would seem that the mentality of France must have varied 
enormously during a single century.  In a few years it passed 
from the Revolution to C&aelig;sarism, returned to the monarchy, 
effected another Revolution, and then summoned a new C&aelig;sar.

In reality only the outsides of things had changed. 
</p><p>We cannot insist further here on the limits of national 
variability, but must now consider the influence of certain 
affective elements, whose development during revolution 
contributes to modify individual or collective personalities.  In

particular I will mention hatred, fear, ambition, jealousy or 
envy, vanity, and enthusiasm.  We observe their influence during 
several of the upheavals of history, notably during the course of

the French Revolution, which will furnish us with most of our 
examples. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hatred</hi>.&mdash;The hatred of persons, institutions, and 
things which animated the men of the Revolution is one of these 
affective phenomena which are the more striking the more one 
studies their psychology.  They detested, not only their enemies,

but the members of their own party.  &ldquo;If one were to accept 
unreservedly,&rdquo; said a recent writer, &ldquo;the judgments which

they expressed of one another, we should have to conclude that 
they were all traitors and boasters, all 
 
 
<pb n="79"/>  
incapable and corrupt, all assassins or tyrants.&rdquo;  We know 
with what hatred, scarcely appeased by the death of their 
enemies, men persecuted the Girondists, Dantonists, 
H&eacute;bertists, Robespierrists, &amp;c. 
</p><p>One of the chief causes of this feeling resided in the 
fact that these furious sectaries, being apostles in possession 
of the absolute verity, were unable, like all believers, to 
tolerate the sight of infidels.  A mystic or sentimental 
certitude is always accompanied by the need of forcing itself on 
others, is never convinced, and does not shrink from wholesale 
slaughter when it has the power to commit it. 
</p><p>If the hatreds that divided the men of the Revolution had 
been of rational origin they would not have lasted long, but, 
arising from affective and mystic factors, men could neither 
forget nor forgive.  Their sources being identical in the 
different parties, they manifested themselves on every hand with 
identical violence.  It has been proved, by means of documents, 
that the Girondists were no less sanguinary than the Montagnards.

They were the first to declare, with P&eacute;tion, that the 
vanquished parties should perish.  They also, according to M. 
Aulard, attempted to justify the massacres of September.  The 
Terror must not be considered simply as a means of defence, but 
as the general process of destruction to which triumphant 
believers have always treated their detested enemies.  Men who 
can put up with the greatest divergence of ideas cannot tolerate 
differences of belief. 
</p><p>In religious or political warfare the vanquished can hope 
for no quarter.  From Sulla, who cut the throats of two hundred 
senators and five or six thousand Romans, to the men who 
suppressed the Commune, 
 
 
<pb n="80"/>  
and shot down more than twenty thousand after their victory, this

bloody law has never failed.  Proved over and over again in the 
past, it will doubtless be so in the future. 
</p><p>The hatreds of the Revolution did not arise entirely from 
divergence of belief.  Other sentiments&mdash;envy, ambition, and 
self-love&mdash;also engendered them.  The rivalry of individuals 
aspiring to power led the chiefs of the various groups in 
succession to the scaffold. 
</p><p>We must remember, moreover, that the need of division and 
the hatred resulting therefrom seem to be constituent elements of

the Latin mind.  They cost our Gaulish ancestors their 
independence, and had already struck C&aelig;sar. 
</p><p>&ldquo;No city,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but was divided into two 
factions; no canton, no village, no house in which the spirit of 
party did not breathe.  It was very rarely that a year went by 
without a city taking up arms to attack or repulse its 
neighbours.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As man has only recently entered upon the age of 
knowledge, and has always hitherto been guided by sentiments and 
beliefs, we may conceive the vast importance of hatred as a 
factor of his history. 
</p><p>Commandant Colin, professor at the College of War, remarks

in the following terms on the importance of this feeling during 
certain wars:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;In war more than at any other time there is no better

inspiring force than hatred; it was hatred that made Bl&uuml;cher

victorious over Napoleon.  Analyse the most wonderful 
man&oelig;uvres, the most decisive operations, and if they are 
not the work of an exceptional man, a Frederick or a Napoleon, 
you will find they are inspired by passion more than by 
calculation. 
 
 
<pb n="81"/>  
What would the war of 1870 have been without the hatred which we 
bore the Germans?&rdquo; 
</p><p>The writer might have added that the intense hatred of the

Japanese for the Russians, who had so humiliated them, might be 
classed among the causes of their success.  The Russian soldiers,

ignorant of the very existence of the Japanese, had no animosity 
against them, which was one of the reasons of their failure. 
</p><p>There was assuredly a good deal of talk of fraternity at 
the time of the Revolution, and there is even more to-day. 
Pacificism, humanitarianism, and solidarity have become 
catchwords of the advanced parties, but we know how profound are 
the hatreds concealed beneath these terms, and what dangers 
overhang our modern society. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fear</hi>.&mdash;Fear plays almost as large a part in 
revolutions as hatred.  During the French Revolution there were 
many examples of great individual courage and many exhibitions of

collective cowardice. 
</p><p>Facing the scaffold, the men of the Convention were always

brave in the extreme; but before the threats of the rioters who 
invaded the Assembly they constantly exhibited an excessive 
pusillanimity, obeying the most absurd injunctions, as we shall 
see if we re-read the history of the revolutionary Assemblies. 
</p><p>All the forms of fear were observed at this period.  One 
of the most widespread was the fear of appearing moderate. 
Members of the Assemblies, public prosecutors, representatives 
&ldquo;on mission,&rdquo; judges of the revolutionary tribunals, &amp;c.,

all sought to appear more advanced than their rivals.  Fear was 
one of the principal elements of the crimes committed at this 
 
 
<pb n="82"/>  
period.  If by some miracle it could have been eliminated from 
the revolutionary Assemblies, their conduct would have been quite

other than it was, and the Revolution itself would have taken a 
very different direction. 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ambition, Envy, Vanity</hi>, &amp;c.&mdash;In normal times the 
influence of these various affective elements is forcibly 
contained by social necessities.  Ambition, for instance, is 
necessarily limited in a hierarchical form of society.  Although 
the soldier does sometimes become a general, it is only after a 
long term of service.  In time of revolution, on the other hand, 
there is no need to wait.  Every one may reach the upper ranks 
almost immediately, so that all ambitions are violently aroused. 
The humblest man believes himself fitted for the highest 
employments, and by this very fact his vanity grows out of all 
measure. 
</p><p>All the passions being more or less aroused, including 
ambition and vanity, we see the development of jealousy and envy 
of those who have succeeded more quickly than others. 
</p><p>The effect of jealousy, always important in times of 
revolution, was especially so during the great French Revolution.

Jealousy of the nobility constituted one of its most important 
factors.  The middle classes had increased in capacity and 
wealth, to the point of surpassing the nobility.  Although they 
mingled with the nobles more and more, they felt, none the less, 
that they were held at a distance, and this they keenly resented.

This frame of mind had unconsciously made the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> 
keen supporters of the philosophic doctrine of equality. 
</p><p>Wounded self-love and jealousy were thus the 
 
 
<pb n="83"/>  
causes of hatreds that we can scarcely conceive today, when the 
social influence of the nobility is so small.  Many members of 
the Convention&mdash;Carrier, Marat, and others&mdash;remembered with anger

that they had once occupied subordinate positions in the 
establishments of great nobles.  Mme. Roland was never able 
to forget that, when she and her mother were invited to the 
house of a great lady under the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>, 
they had been sent to dine in the servants' quarters. 
</p><p>The philosopher Rivarol has very well described in the 
following passage, already cited by Taine, the influence of 
wounded self-love and jealousy upon the revolutionary hatreds:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;the taxes, nor the 
<hi rend="italic">lettres de cachet</hi>, nor any of the other abuses of 
authority; it is not the sins of the intendants, nor the long and

ruinous delays of justice, that has most angered the nation; it 
is the prejudices of the nobility for which it has exhibited the 
greatest hatred.  What proves this clearly is the fact that it is

the <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi>, the men of letters, the men of money, in 
fact all those who are jealous of the nobility, who have raised 
the poorer inhabitants of the cities against them, and the 
peasants in the country districts.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This very true statement partly justifies the saying of 
Napoleon:  &ldquo;Vanity made the Revolution; liberty was only the 
pretext.&rdquo; 
</p><p><hi rend="italic">Enthusiasm</hi>.&mdash;The enthusiasm of the founders of the 
Revolution equalled that of the apostles of the faith of 
Mohammed.  And it was really a religion that the <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi>

of the first Assembly thought to found.  They thought to have 
destroyed an old world, 
 
 
<pb n="84"/>  
and to have built a new one upon its ruins.  Never did illusion 
more seductive fire the hearts of men.  Equality and fraternity, 
proclaimed by the new dogmas, were to bring the reign of eternal 
happiness to all the peoples.  Man had broken for ever with a 
past of barbarity and darkness.  The regenerated world would in 
future be illuminated by the lucid radiance of pure reason.  On 
all hands the most brilliant oratorical formul&aelig; saluted the

expected dawn. 
</p><p>That this enthusiasm was so soon replaced by violence was 
due to the fact that the awakening was speedy and terrible.  One 
can readily conceive the indignant fury with which the apostles 
of the Revolution attacked the daily obstacles opposed to the 
realisation of their dreams.  They had sought to reject the past,

to forget tradition, to make man over again.  But the past 
reappeared incessantly, and men refused to change.  The 
reformers, checked in their onward march, would not give in. 
They sought to impose by force a dictatorship which speedily made

men regret the system abolished, and finally led to its return. 
</p><p>It is to be remarked that although the enthusiasm of the 
first days did not last in the revolutionary Assemblies, it 
survived very much longer in the armies, and constituted their 
chief strength.  To tell the truth, the armies of the Revolution 
were republican long before France became so, and remained 
republican long after France had ceased to be so. 
</p><p>The variations of character considered in this chapter, 
being conditioned by certain common aspirations and identical 
changes of environment, finally 
 
 
<pb n="85"/>  
became concrete in a small number of fairly homogeneous 
mentalities.  Speaking only of the more characteristic, we may 
refer them to four types: the Jacobin, mystic, revolutionary, and

criminal mentalities.

<p>THE classifications without which the study of the sciences is

impossible must necessarily establish the discontinuous in the 
continuous, and for that reason are to a certain extent 
artificial.  But they are necessary, since the continuous is only

accessible in the form of the discontinuous. 
</p><p>To create broad distinctions between the various 
mentalities observable in time of revolution, as we are about to 
do, is obviously to separate elements which encroach upon one 
another, which are fused or superimposed.  We must resign 
ourselves to losing a little in exactitude in order to gain in 
lucidity.  The fundamental types enumerated at the end of the 
preceding chapter, and which we are about to describe, synthetise

groups which would escape analysis were we to attempt to study 
them in all their complexity. 
</p><p>We have shown that man is influenced by different logics, 
which under normal conditions exist in juxtaposition, without 
mutually influencing one another.  Under the action of various 
events they enter into mutual conflict, and the irreducible 
differences 
 
 
<pb n="87"/>  
which divide them are visibly manifested, involving considerable 
individual and social upheavals. 
</p><p>Mystic logic, which we shall presently consider as it 
appears in the Jacobin mind, plays a very important part.  But it

is not alone in its action.  The other forms of logic&mdash;affective 
logic, collective logic, and rational logic&mdash;may predominate 
according to circumstances. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d42"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Mystic Mentality</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the influence of affective, 
rational, and collective logic, we will occupy ourselves solely 
with the considerable part played by the mystic elements which 
have prevailed in so many revolutions, and notably in the French 
Revolution. 
</p><p>The chief characteristic of the mystic temperament 
consists in the attribution of a mysterious power to superior 
beings or forces, which are incarnated in the form of idols, 
fetiches, words, or formul&aelig;. 
</p><p>The mystic spirit is at the bottom of all the religious 
and most political beliefs.  These latter would often vanish 
could we deprive them of the mystic elements which are their 
chief support. 
</p><p>Grafted on the sentiments and passionate impulses which it

directs, mystic logic constitutes the might of the great popular 
movements.  Men who would be by no means ready to allow 
themselves to be killed for the best of reasons will readily 
sacrifice their lives to a mystic ideal which has become an 
object of adoration. 
</p><p>The principles of the Revolution speedily inspired a wave 
of mystic enthusiasm analogous to those provoked by the various 
religious beliefs which had preceded it.  All they did was to 
change the 
 
 
<pb n="88"/>  
orientation of a mental ancestry which the centuries had 
solidified. 
</p><p>So there is nothing astonishing in the savage zeal of the 
men of the Convention.  Their mystic mentality was the same as 
that of the Protestants at the time of the Reformation.  The 
principal heroes of the Terror&mdash;Couthon, Saint-Just, Robespierre,

&amp;c.&mdash;were Apostles.  Like Polyeuctes, destroying the altars of 
the false gods to propagate his faith, they dreamed of converting

the globe.  Their enthusiasm spilled itself over the earth. 
Persuaded that their magnificent formul&aelig; were sufficient to

overturn thrones, they did not hesitate to declare war upon 
kings.  And as a strong faith is always superior to a doubtful 
faith, they victoriously faced all Europe. 
</p><p>The mystic spirit of the leaders of the Revolution was 
betrayed in the least details of their public life.  Robespierre,

convinced that he was supported by the Almighty, assured his 
hearers in a speech that the Supreme Being had &ldquo;decreed the 
Republic since the beginning of time.&rdquo;  In his quality of 
High Pontiff of a State religion he made the Convention vote a 
decree declaring that &ldquo;the French People recognises the 
existence of the Supreme Being and the immortality of the 
soul.&rdquo;  At the festival of this Supreme Being, seated on a 
kind of throne, he preached a lengthy sermon. 
</p><p>The Jacobin Club, directed by Robespierre, finally assumed

all the functions of a council.  There Maximilien proclaimed 
&ldquo;the idea of a Great Being who watches over oppressed 
innocence and who punishes triumphant crime.&rdquo; 
</p><p>All the heretics who criticised the Jacobin orthodoxy 
 
 
<pb n="89"/>  
were excommunicated&mdash;that is, were sent to the Revolutionary 
Tribunal, which they left only for the scaffold. 
</p><p>The mystic mentality of which Robespierre was the most 
celebrated representative did not die with him.  Men of identical

mentality are to be found among the French politicians of to-day.

The old religious beliefs no longer rule their minds, but they 
are the creatures of political creeds which they would very soon 
force on others, as did Robespierre, if they had the chance of so

doing.  Always ready to kill if killing would spread their faith,

the mystics of all ages have employed the same means of 
persuasion as soon as they have become the masters. 
</p><p>It is therefore quite natural that Robespierre should 
still have many admirers.  Minds moulded like his are to be met 
with in their thousands.  His conceptions were not guillotined 
with him.  Old as humanity, they will only disappear with the 
last believer. 
</p><p>This mystic aspect of all revolutions has escaped the 
majority of the historians.  They will persist for a long time 
yet in trying to explain by means of rational logic a host of 
phenomena which have nothing to do with reason.  I have already 
cited a passage from the history of MM. Lavisse and Rambaud, in 
which the Reformation is explained as &ldquo;the result of the free

individual reflections suggested to simple folk by an extremely 
pious conscience, and a bold and courageous reason.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Such movements are never comprehended by those who imagine

that their origin is rational.  Political or religious, the 
beliefs which have moved the world 
 
 
<pb n="90"/>  
possess a common origin and follow the same laws.  They are 
formed, not by the reason, but more often contrary to reason. 
Buddhism, Christianity, Islamism, the Reformation, sorcery, 
Jacobinism, socialism, spiritualism, &amp;c., seem very different 
forms of belief, but they have, I repeat, identical mystic and 
affective bases, and obey forms of logic which have no affinity 
with rational logic.  Their might resides precisely in the fact 
that reason has as little power to create them as to transform 
them. 
</p><p>The mystic mentality of our modern political apostles is 
strongly marked in an article dealing with one of our recent 
ministers, which I cite from a leading journal: 
</p><p>&ldquo;One may ask into what category does M. A&mdash;fall? 
Could we say, for instance, that he belongs to the group of 
unbelievers?  Far from it!  Certainly M. A&mdash; has not adopted 
any positive faith; certainly he curses Rome and Geneva, 
rejecting all the traditional dogmas and all the known Churches. 
But if he makes a clean sweep it is in order to found his own 
Church on the ground so cleared, a Church more dogmatic than all 
the rest; and his own inquisition, whose brutal intolerance would

have no reason to envy the most notorious of Torquemadas. 
</p><p>&ldquo; `We cannot,' he says, `allow such a thing as 
scholastic neutrality.  We demand lay instruction in all its 
plenitude, and are consequently the enemies of educational 
liberty.'  If he does not suggest erecting the stake and the 
pyre, it is only on account of the evolution of manners, which he

is forced to take into account to a certain extent, whether he 
will or no.  But, not being able to commit men to the torture, he

 
 
<pb n="91"/>  
invokes the secular arm to condemn their doctrines to death. 
This is exactly the point of view of the great inquisitors.  It 
is the same attack upon thought.  This freethinker has so free a 
spirit that every philosophy he does not accept appears to him, 
not only ridiculous and grotesque, but criminal.  He flatters 
himself that he alone is in possession of the absolute truth.  Of

this he is so entirely sure that everyone who contradicts him 
seems to him an execrable monster and a public enemy.  He does 
not suspect for a moment that after all his personal views are 
only hypotheses, and that he is all the more laughable for 
claiming a Divine right for them precisely because they deny 
divinity.  Or, at least, they profess to do so; but they 
re-establish it in another shape, which immediately makes 
one regret the old.  M. A&mdash; is a sectary of the goddess 
Reason, of whom he has made a Moloch, an oppressive deity 
hungry for sacrifice.  No more liberty of thought for any 
one except for himself and his friends; such is the free 
thought of M. A&mdash;.  The outlook is truly attractive. 
But perhaps too many idols have been cast down 
during the last few centuries for men to bow before this 
one.&rdquo; 
</p><p>We must hope for the sake of liberty that these gloomy 
fanatics will never finally become our masters. 
</p><p>Given the silent power of reason over mystic beliefs, it 
is quite useless to seek to discuss, as is so often done, the 
rational value of revolutionary or political ideas.  Only their 
influence can interest us.  It matters little that the theories 
of the supposed equality of men, the original goodness of 
mankind, the possibility of re-making society by means of laws, 
have 
 
 
<pb n="92"/>  
been given the lie by observation and experience.  These empty 
illusions must be counted among the most potent motives of action

that humanity has known.

<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Jacobin Mentality</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Although the term &ldquo;Jacobin mentality&rdquo; does not really 
belong to any true classification, I employ it here because it 
sums up a clearly defined combination which constitutes a 
veritable psychological species. 
</p><p>This mentality dominates the men of the French Revolution,

but is not peculiar to them, as it still represents one of the 
most active elements in our politics. 
</p><p>The mystic mentality which we have already considered is 
an essential factor of the Jacobin mind, but it is not in itself 
enough to constitute that mind.  Other elements, which we shall 
now examine, must be added. 
</p><p>The Jacobins do not in the least suspect their mysticism. 
On the contrary, they profess to be guided solely by pure reason.

During the Revolution they invoked reason incessantly, and 
considered it as their only guide to conduct. 
</p><p>The majority of historians have adopted this rationalist 
conception of the Jacobin mind, and Taine fell into the same 
error.  It is in the abuse of rationalism that he seeks the 
origin of a great proportion of the acts of the Jacobins.  The 
pages in which he has dealt with the subject contain many truths,

however, and as they are in other ways very remarkable, I 
reproduce the most important passages here:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Neither exaggerated self-love nor dogmatic 
 
 
<pb n="93"/>  
reasoning is rare in the human species.  In all countries these 
two roots of the Jacobin spirit subsist, secret and 
indestructible. . . .  At twenty years of age, when a young man 
is entering into the world, his reason is stimulated 
simultaneously with his pride. In the first place, whatever 
society he may move in, it is contemptible to pure reason, for it

has not been constructed by a philosophic legislator according to

a principle, but successive generations have arranged it 
according to their multiple and ever-changing needs.  It is not 
the work of logic, but of history, and the young reasoner shrugs 
his shoulders at the sight of this old building, whose site is 
arbitrary, whose architecture is incoherent, and whose 
inconveniences are obvious. . . .  The majority of young people, 
above all those who have their way to make, are more or less 
Jacobin on leaving college. . . .  Jacobinism is born of social 
decomposition just as mushrooms are born of a fermenting soil. 
Consider the authentic monuments of its thought&mdash;the speeches of 
Robespierre and Saint-Just, the debates of the Legislative 
Assembly and the Convention, the harangues, addresses, and 
reports of Girondists and Montagnards.  Never did men speak so 
much to say so little; the empty verbiage and swollen emphasis 
swamp any truth there may be beneath their monotony and their 
turgidity.  The Jacobin is full of respect for the phantoms of 
his reasoning brain; in his eyes they are more real than living 
men, and their suffrage is the only suffrage he recognises&mdash;he 
will march onward in all sincerity at the head of a procession of

imaginary followers.  The millions of metaphysical wills which he

has created in the image of his own will sustain 
 
 
<pb n="94"/>  
him by their unanimous assent, and he will project outwards, like

a chorus of triumph and acclamation, the inward echo of his own 
voice.&rdquo; 
</p><p>While admiring Taine's description, I think he has not 
exactly grasped the psychology of the Jacobin. 
</p><p>The mind of the true Jacobin, at the time of the 
Revolution as now, was composed of elements which we must analyse

if we are to understand its function. 
</p><p>This analysis will show in the first place that the 
Jacobin is not a rationalist, but a believer.  Far from building 
his belief on reason, he moulds reason to his belief, and 
although his speeches are steeped in rationalism he employs it 
very little in his thoughts and his conduct. 
</p><p>A Jacobin who reasoned as much as he is accused of 
reasoning would be sometimes accessible to the voice of reason. 
Now, observation proves, from the time of the Revolution to our 
own days, that the Jacobin is never influenced by reasoning, 
however just, and it is precisely here that his strength resides.

</p><p>And why is he not accessible to reason?  Simply because 
his vision of things, always extremely limited, does not permit 
of his resisting the powerful and passionate impulses which guide

him. 
</p><p>These two elements, feeble reason and strong passions, 
would not of themselves constitute the Jacobin mind.  There is 
another. 
</p><p>Passion supports convictions, but hardly ever creates 
them.  Now, the true Jacobin has forcible convictions.  What is 
to sustain them?  Here the mystic elements whose action we have 
already studied come into play.  The Jacobin is a mystic who has 
 
 
<pb n="95"/>  
replaced the old divinities by new gods.  Imbued with the power 
of words and formul&aelig;, he attributes to these a mysterious 
power.  To serve these exigent divinities he does not shrink from

the most violent measures.  The laws voted by our modern Jacobins

furnish a proof of this fact. 
</p><p>The Jacobin mentality is found especially in narrow and 
passionate characters.  It implies, in fact, a narrow and rigid 
mind, inaccessible to all criticism and to all considerations but

those of faith. 
</p><p>The mystic and affective elements which dominate the mind 
of the Jacobin condemn him to an extreme simplicity.  Grasping 
only the superficial relations of things, nothing prevents him 
from taking for realities the chimerical images which are born of

his imagination.  The sequence of phenomena and their results 
escape him.  He never raises his eyes from his dream. 
</p><p>As we may see, it is not by the development of his logical

reason that the Jacobin exceeds.  He possesses very little logic 
of this kind, and therefore he often becomes dangerous.  Where a 
superior man would hesitate or halt the Jacobin, who has placed 
his feeble reason at the service of his impulses, goes forward 
with certainty. 
</p><p>So that although the Jacobin is a great reasoner, this 
does not mean that he is in the least guided by reason.  When he 
imagines he is being led by reason it is really his passions and 
his mysticism that lead him.  Like all those who are convinced 
and hemmed in by the walls of faith, he can never escape there-from. 
</p><p>A true aggressive theologian, he is astonishingly 
 
 
<pb n="96"/>  
like the disciples of Calvin described in a previous chapter. 
Hypnotised by their faith, nothing could deter them from their 
object.  All those who contradicted their articles of faith were 
considered worthy of death.  They too seemed to be powerful 
reasoners.  Ignorant, like the Jacobins, of the secret forces 
that led them, they believed that reason was their sole guide, 
while in reality they were the slaves of mysticism and passion. 
</p><p>The truly rationalistic Jacobin would be incomprehensible,

and would merely make reason despair.  The passionate and 
mystical Jacobin is, on the contrary, easily intelligible. 
</p><p>With these three elements&mdash;a very weak reasoning power, 
very strong passions, and an intense mysticism&mdash;we have the true 
psychological components of the mind of the Jacobin.

THE REVOLUTIONARY AND CRIMINAL 
MENTALITIES 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d45"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Revolutionary Mentality</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WE have just seen that the mystic elements are one of the 
components of the Jacobin mentality.  We shall now see that they 
enter into another form of mentality which is also clearly 
defined, the revolutionary mentality. 
</p><p>In all ages societies have contained a certain number of 
restless spirits, unstable and discontented, ready to rebel 
against any established order of affairs.  They are actuated by 
the mere love of revolt, and if some magic power could realise 
all their desires they would simply revolt again. 
</p><p>This special mentality often results from a faulty 
adaptation of the individual to his surroundings, or from an 
excess of mysticism, but it may also be merely a question of 
temperament or arise from pathological disturbances. 
</p><p>The need of revolt presents very different degrees of 
intensity, from simple discontent expressed in words directed 
against men and things to the need of destroying them.  Sometimes

the individual turns upon himself the revolutionary frenzy that 
he cannot otherwise exercise.  Russia is full of these madmen, 
 
 
<pb n="98"/>  
who, not content with committing arson or throwing bombs at 
hazard into the crowd, finally mutilate themselves, like the 
Skopzis and other analogous sects. 
</p><p>These perpetual rebels are generally highly suggestible 
beings, whose mystic mentality is obsessed by fixed ideas. 
Despite the apparent energy indicated by their actions they are 
really weak characters, and are incapable of mastering themselves

sufficiently to resist the impulses that rule them.  The mystic 
spirit which animates them furnishes pretexts for their violence,

and enables them to regard themselves as great reformers. 
</p><p>In normal times the rebels which every society contains 
are restrained by the laws, by their environment&mdash;in short, by 
all the usual social constraints, and therefore remain 
undetected.  But as soon as a time of disturbance begins these 
constraints grow weaker, and the rebel can give a free reign to 
his instincts.  He then becomes the accredited leader of a 
movement.  The motive of the revolution matters little to him; he

will give his life indifferently for the red flag or the white, 
or for the liberation of a country which he has heard vaguely 
mentioned. 
</p><p>The revolutionary spirit is not always pushed to the 
extremes which render it dangerous.  When, instead of deriving 
from affective or mystic impulses, it has an intellectual origin,

it may become a source of progress.  It is thanks to those 
spirits who are sufficiently independent to be intellectually 
revolutionary that a civilisation is able to escape from the yoke

of tradition and habit when this becomes too heavy.  The 
sciences, arts, and industries especially have progressed 
 
 
<pb n="99"/>  
by the aid of such men.  Galileo, Lavoisier, Darwin, and Pasteur 
were such revolutionaries. 
</p><p>Although it is not necessary that a nation should possess 
any large number of such spirits, it is very necessary that it 
should possess some.  Without them men would still be living in 
caves. 
</p><p>The revolutionary audacity which results in discoveries 
implies very rare faculties.  It necessitates notably an 
independence of mind sufficient to escape from the influence of 
current opinions, and a judgement that can grasp, under 
superficial analogies, the hidden realities.  This form of 
revolutionary spirit is creative, while that examined above is 
destructive. 
</p><p>The revolutionary mentality may, therefore, be compared to

certain physiological states in the life of the individual which 
are normally useful, but which, when exaggerated, take a 
pathological form which is always hurtful. 
 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d46"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Criminal Mentality</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>All the civilised societies inevitably drag behind them a 
residue of degenerates, of the unadapted, of persons affected by 
various taints.  Vagabonds, beggars, fugitives from justice, 
thieves, assassins, and starving creatures that live from day to 
day, may constitute the criminal population of the great cities. 
In ordinary times these waste products of civilisation are more 
or less restrained by the police.  During revolution nothing 
restrains them, and they can easily gratify their instincts to 
murder and plunder.  In the dregs of society the revolutionaries 
of all times are sure of finding recruits.  Eager only to kill 
and to plunder, little matters to them the cause they are 
 
 
<pb n="100"/>  
sworn to defend.  If the chances of murder and pillage are better

in the party attacked, they will promptly change their colours. 
</p><p>To these criminals, properly so called, the incurable 
plague of all societies, we must add the class of semi-criminals.

Wrongdoers on occasion, they never rebel so long as the fear of 
the established order restrains them, but as soon as it weakens 
they enrol themselves in the army of revolution. 
</p><p>These two categories&mdash;habitual and occasional criminals&mdash; 
form an army of disorder which is fit for nothing but the 
creation of disorder.  All the revolutionaries, all the founders 
of religious or political leagues, have constantly counted on 
their support. 
</p><p>We have already stated that this population, with its 
criminal mentality, exercised a considerable influence during the

French Revolution.  It always figured in the front rank of the 
riots which occurred almost daily.  Certain historians have 
spoken with respect and emotion of the way in which the sovereign

people enforced its will upon the Convention, invading the hall 
armed with pikes, the points of which were sometimes decorated 
with newly severed heads.  If we analyse the elements composing 
the pretended delegations of the sovereign people, we shall find 
that, apart from a small number of simple souls who submitted to 
the impulses of the leaders, the mass was almost entirely formed 
of the bandits of whom I have been speaking.  To them were due 
the innumerable murders of which the massacres of September and 
the killing of the Princesse de Lamballe were merely typical. 
 
 
<pb n="101"/> </p><p> 
 
They terrorised all the great Assemblies, from the Constituent 
Assembly to the Convention, and for ten years they helped to 
ravage France.  If by some miracle this army of criminals could 
have been eliminated, the progress of the Revolution would have 
been very different.  They stained it with blood from its dawn to

its decline.  Reason could do nothing with them but they could do

much against reason.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF REVOLUTIONARY CROWDS 
</head> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d48"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">General Characteristics of the Crowd</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WHATEVER their origin, revolutions do not produce their full 
effects until they have penetrated the soul of the multitude. 
They therefore represent a consequence of the psychology of 
crowds. 
</p><p>Although I have studied collective psychology at length in

another volume, I must here recall its principal laws. 
</p><p>Man, as part of a multitude, is a very different being 
from the same man as an isolated individual.  His conscious 
individuality vanishes in the unconscious personality of the 
crowd. 
</p><p>Material contact is not absolutely necessary to produce in

the individual the mentality of the crowd.  Common passions and 
sentiments, provoked by certain events, are often sufficient to 
create it. 
</p><p>The collective mind, momentarily formed, represents a very

special kind of aggregate.  Its chief peculiarity is that it is 
entirely dominated by unconscious elements, and is subject to a 
peculiar collective logic. 
</p><p>Among the other characteristics of crowds, we must note 
their infinite credulity and exaggerated sensibility, their 
short-sightedness, and their incapacity 
 
 
<pb n="103"/>  
to respond to the influences of reason.  Affirmation, contagion, 
repetition, and prestige constitute almost the only means of 
persuading them.  Reality and experience have no effect upon 
them.  The multitude will admit anything; nothing is impossible 
in the eyes of the crowd. 
</p><p>By reason of the extreme sensibility of crowds, their 
sentiments, good or bad, are always exaggerated.  This 
exaggeration increases still further in times of revolution.  The

least excitement will then lead the multitude to act with the 
utmost fury.  Their credulity, so great even in the normal state,

is still further increased; the most improbable statements are 
accepted.  Arthur Young relates that when he visited the springs 
near Clermont, at the time of the French Revolution, his guide 
was stopped by the people, who were persuaded that he had come by

order of the Queen to mine and blow up the town.  The most 
horrible tales concerning the Royal Family were circulated, 
depicting it as a nest of ghouls and vampires. 
</p><p>These various characteristics show that man in the crowd 
descends to a very low degree in the scale of civilisation.  He 
becomes a savage, with all a savage's faults and qualities, with 
all his momentary violence, enthusiasm, and heroism.  In the 
intellectual domain a crowd is always inferior to the isolated 
unit.  In the moral and sentimental domain it may be his 
superior.  A crowd will commit a crime as readily as an act of 
abnegation. 
</p><p>Personal characteristics vanish in the crowd, which exerts

an extraordinary influence upon the individuals which form it. 
The miser becomes generous, the 
 
 
<pb n="104"/>  
sceptic a believer, the honest man a criminal, the coward a hero.

Examples of such transformations abounded during the great 
Revolution. 
</p><p>As part of a jury or a parliament, the collective man 
renders verdicts or passes laws of which he would never have 
dreamed in his isolated condition. 
</p><p>One of the most notable consequences of the influence of a

collectivity upon the individuals who compose it is the 
unification of their sentiments and wills.  This psychological 
unity confers a remarkable force upon crowds. 
</p><p>The formation of such a mental unity results chiefly from 
the fact that in a crowd gestures and actions are extremely 
contagious.  Acclamations of hatred, fury, or love are 
immediately approved and repeated. 
</p><p>What is the origin of these common sentiments, this common

will?  They are propagated by contagion, but a point of departure

is necessary before this contagion can take effect.  Without a 
leader the crowd is an amorphous entity incapable of action. 
</p><p>A knowledge of the laws relating to the psychology of 
crowds is indispensable to the interpretation of the elements of 
our Revolution, and to a comprehension of the conduct of 
revolutionary assemblies, and the singular transformations of the

individuals who form part of them.  Pushed by the unconscious 
forces of the collective soul, they more often than not say what 
they did not intend, and vote what they would not have wished to 
vote. 
</p><p>Although the laws of collective psychology have sometimes 
been divined instinctively by superior statesmen, the majority of

Governments have not 
 
 
<pb n="105"/>  
understood and do not understand them.  It is because they do not

understand them that so many of them have fallen so easily.  When

we see the facility with which certain Governments were over-thrown by an insignificant riot&mdash;as happened in the case of the 
monarchy of Louis-Philippe&mdash;the dangers of an ignorance of 
collective psychology are evident.  The marshal in command of the

troops in 1848, which were more than sufficient to defend the 
king, certainly did not understand that the moment he allowed the

crowd to mingle with the troops the latter, paralysed by 
suggestion and contagion, would cease to do their duty.  Neither 
did he know that as the multitude is extremely sensible to 
prestige it needs a great display of force to impress it, and 
that such a display will at once suppress hostile demonstrations.

He was equally ignorant of the fact that all gatherings should be

dispersed immediately.  All these things have been taught by 
experience, but in 1848 these lessons had not been grasped.  At 
the time of the great Revolution the psychology of crowds was 
even less understood.

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d49"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">How the Stability of the Racial Mind limits the 
Oscillations of the Mind of the Crowd</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>A people can in a sense be likened to a crowd.  It possesses 
certain characteristics, but the oscillations of these 
characteristics are limited by the soul or mind of the race.  The

mind of the race has a fixity unknown to the transitory mind of 
the crowd. 
</p><p>When a people possesses an ancestral soul established by a

long past the soul of the crowd is always dominated thereby. 
 
 
<pb n="106"/>  
 
</p><p>A people differs from a crowd also in that it is composed 
of a collection of groups, each having different interests and 
passions.  In a crowd properly so-called&mdash;a popular assembly, for

example&mdash;there are unities which may belong to very different 
social categories. 
</p><p>A people sometimes seems as mobile as a crowd, but we must

not forget that behind its mobility, its enthusiasms, its 
violence and destructiveness, the extremely tenacious and 
conservative instincts of the racial mind persist.  The history 
of the Revolution and the century which has followed shows how 
the conservative spirit finally overcomes the spirit of 
destruction.  More than one system of government which the people

has shattered has been restored by the people. 
</p><p>It is not as easy to work upon the mind of the people&mdash; 
that is, the mind of the race&mdash;as on the mind of a crowd.  The 
means of action are indirect and slower (journals, conferences, 
speeches, books, &amp;c.).  The elements of persuasion always come 
under the headings already given: affirmation, repetition, 
prestige, and contagion. 
</p><p>Mental contagion may affect a whole people 
instantaneously, but more often it operates slowly, creeping from

group to group.  Thus was the Reformation propagated in France. 
</p><p>A people is far less excitable than a crowd; but certain 
events&mdash;national insults, threats of invasion, &amp;c.&mdash;may arouse it

instantly.  Such a phenomenon was observed on several occasions 
during the Revolution, notably at the time of the insolent 
manifesto issued by the Duke of Brunswick.  The Duke knew little 
indeed of the psychology of the French race 
 
 
<pb n="107"/>  
when he proffered his threats.  Not only did he considerably 
prejudice the cause of Louis XVI.; but he also damaged his own, 
since his intervention raised from the soil an army eager to 
fight him. 
</p><p>This sudden explosion of feeling throughout a whole race 
has been observed in all nations.  Napoleon did not understand 
the power of such explosions when he invaded Spain and Russia. 
One may easily disaggregate the facile mind of a crowd, but one 
can do nothing before the permanent soul of a race.  Certainly 
the Russian peasant is a very indifferent being, gross and narrow

by nature, yet at the first news of invasion he was transformed. 
One may judge of this fact on reading a letter written by 
Elizabeth, wife of the Emperor Alexander I. 
</p><p>&ldquo;From the moment when Napoleon had crossed our 
frontiers it was as though an electric spark had spread through 
all Russia; and if the immensity of its area had made it possible

for the news to penetrate simultaneously to every corner of the 
Empire a cry of indignation would have arisen so terrible that I 
believe it would have resounded to the ends of the earth.  As 
Napoleon advances this feeling is growing yet stronger.  Old men 
who have lost all or nearly all their goods are saying:  `We 
shall find a way of living.  Anything is preferable to a shameful

peace.'  Women all of whose kin are in the army regard the 
dangers they are running as secondary, and fear nothing but 
peace.  Happily this peace, which would be the death-warrant of 
Russia, will not be negotiated; the Emperor does not conceive of 
such an idea, and even if he would he could not.  This is the 
heroic side of our position.&rdquo; 
 
 
<pb n="108"/>  
</p><p>The Empress describes to her mother the two following 
traits, which give some idea of the degree of resistance of 
which the soul of the Russian is capable:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Frenchmen had caught some unhappy peasants in 
Moscow, whom they thought to force to serve in their ranks, and 
in order that they should not be able to escape they branded 
their hands as one brands horses in the stud.  One of them asked 
what this mark meant; he was told it signified that he was a 
French soldier.  `What!  I am a soldier of the Emperor of the 
French!' he said.  And immediately he took his hatchet, cut off 
his hand, and threw it at the feet of those present, saying, 
`Take it&mdash;there's your mark!' 
</p><p>&ldquo;At Moscow, too, the French had taken a score of 
peasants of whom they wished to make an example in order to 
frighten the villagers, who were picking off the French foraging 
parties and were making war as well as the detachments of regular

troops.  They ranged them against a wall and read their sentence 
in Russian.  They waited for them to beg for mercy: instead of 
that they took farewell of one another and made their sign of the

cross.  The French fired on the first of them; they waited for 
the rest to beg for pardon in their terror, and to promise to 
change their conduct.  They fired on the second, and on the 
third, and so on all the twenty, without a single one having 
attempted to implore the <hi rend="italic">clemency</hi> of the enemy.  Napoleon 
has not once had the pleasure of profaning this word in 
Russia.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Among the characteristics of the popular mind we must 
mention that in all peoples and all ages it has 
 
 
<pb n="109"/>  
been saturated with mysticism.  The people will always be 
convinced that superior beings&mdash;divinities, Governments, or great

men&mdash;have the power to change things at will.  This mystic side 
produces an intense need of adoration.  The people must have a 
fetich, either a man or a doctrine.  This is why, when threatened

with anarchy, it calls for a Messiah to save it. 
</p><p>Like the crowd, but more slowly, the people readily passes

from adoration to hatred.  A man may be the hero of the people at

one period, and finally earn its curses.  These variations of 
popular opinion concerning political personalities may be 
observed in all times.  The history of Cromwell furnishes us with

a very curious example.<ref target="n5">5</ref>

<p>All the varieties of crowds&mdash;homogeneous and 
heterogeneous, assemblies, peoples, clubs, &amp;c.&mdash;are, as we have 
often repeated, aggregates incapable of unity and action so long 
as they find no master to lead them. 
</p><p>I have shown elsewhere, making use of certain 
physiological experiments, that the unconscious collective mind 
of the crowd seems bound up with the mind of the leader.  The 
latter gives it a single will and imposes absolute obedience.

</p><p>The leader acts especially through suggestion.  His 
success depends on his fashion of provoking this suggestion. 
Many experiments have shown to what point a collectivity may be 
subjected to suggestion.<ref target="n6">6</ref> 
</p><p>According to the suggestions of the leaders, the multitude

will be calm, furious, criminal, or heroic.  These various 
suggestions may sometimes appear to present a rational aspect, 
but they will only appear to be reasonable.  A crowd is in 
reality inaccessible to reason; the only ideas capable of 
influencing it will always be sentiments evoked in the form of 
images. 
</p><p>The history of the Revolution shows on every page how 
easily the multitude follows the most 
 
 
<pb n="111"/>  
contradictory impulses given by its different leaders.  We see it

applaud just as vigorously at the triumph of the Girondists, the 
H&eacute;bertists, the Dantonists, and the Terrorists as at their

successive downfalls.  One may be quite sure, also, that the 
crowd understood nothing of these events. 
</p><p>At a distance one can only confusedly perceive the part 
played by the leaders, for they commonly work in the shade.  To 
grasp this clearly we must study them in contemporary events.  We

shall then see how readily the leader can provoke the most 
violent popular movements.  We are not thinking here of the 
strikes of the postmen or railway men, in which the discontent of

the employees might intervene, but of events in which the crowd 
was not in the least interested.  Such, for example, was the 
popular rising provoked by a few Socialist leaders amidst the 
Parisian populace on the morrow of the execution of Ferrer, in 
Spain.  The French crowd had never heard of Ferrer.  In Spain his

execution was almost unnoticed.  In Paris the incitements of a 
few leaders sufficed to hurl a regular popular army upon the 
Spanish Embassy, with the intention of burning it.  Part of the 
garrison had to be employed to protect it.  Energetically 
repulsed, the assailants contented themselves with sacking a few 
shops and building some barricades. 
</p><p>At the same time, the leaders gave another proof of their 
influence.  Finally understanding that the burning of a foreign 
embassy might be extremely dangerous, they ordered a pacific 
demonstration for the following day, and were as faithfully 
obeyed as if they had ordered the most violent riot.  No 
 
 
<pb n="112"/>  
example could better show the importance of leaders and the 
submission of the crowd 
</p><p>The historians who, from Michelet to M. Aulard, have 
represented the revolutionary crowd as having acted on its own 
initiative, without leaders, do not comprehend its psychology.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY 
ASSEMBLIES 
</head> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d52"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Psychological Characteristics of the great 
Revolutionary Assemblies.</hi> 
</head> 
 
<p>A GREAT political assembly, a parliament for example, is a 
crowd, but a crowd which sometimes fails in effectual action on 
account of the contrary sentiments of the hostile groups 
composing it. 
</p><p>The presence of these groups, actuated by different 
interests, must make us consider an assembly as formed of 
superimposed and heterogeneous crowds, each obeying its 
particular leaders.  The law of the mental unity of crowds is 
manifested only in each group, and it is only as a result of 
exceptional circumstances that the different groups act with a 
single intention. 
</p><p>Each group in an assembly represents a single being.  The 
individuals contributing to the formation of this being are no 
longer themselves, and will unhesitatingly vote against their 
convictions and their wishes.  On the eve of the day when Louis 
XVI. was to be condemned Vergniaud protested with indignation 
against the suggestion that he should vote for his death; but he 
did so vote on the following day. 
 
 
<pb n="114"/>  </p><p> 
 
The action of a group consists chiefly in fortifying hesitating 
opinions.  All feeble individual convictions become confirmed 
upon becoming collective. 
</p><p>Leaders of great repute or unusual violence can sometimes,

by acting on all the groups of an assembly, make them a single 
crowd.  The majority of the members of the Convention enacted 
measures entirely contrary to their opinions under the influence 
of a very small number of such leaders. 
</p><p>Collectivities have always given way before active 
sectaries.  The history of the revolutionary Assemblies shows how

pusillanimous they were, despite the boldness of their language 
respecting kings, before the leaders of the popular riots.  The 
invasion of a band of energumens commanded by an imperious leader

was enough to make them vote then and there the most absurd and 
contradictory measures. 
</p><p>An assembly, having the characteristics of a crowd, will, 
like a crowd, be extreme in its sentiments.  Excessive in its 
violence, it will be excessive in its cowardice.  In general it 
will be insolent to the weak and servile before the strong. 
</p><p>We remember the fearful humility of the Parliament when 
the youthful Louis XIV. entered, whip in hand, to pronounce his 
brief speech.  We know with what increasing impertinence the 
Constituent Assembly treated Louis XVI. as it felt that he was 
becoming defenceless.  Finally, we recall the terror of the 
Convention under the reign of Robespierre. 
</p><p>This characteristic of assemblies being a general law, the

convocation of an assembly by a sovereign when his power is 
failing must be regarded as a gross error in psychology.  The 
assembling of the States 
 
 
<pb n="115"/>  
General cost the life of Louis XVI.  It all but lost Henry III. 
his throne, when, obliged to leave Paris, he had the unhappy idea

of assembling the Estates at Blois.  Conscious of the weakness of

the king, the Estates at once spoke as masters of the situation, 
modifying taxes, dismissing officials, and claiming that their 
decisions should have the force of law. 
</p><p>This progressive exaggeration of sentiments was plainly 
demonstrated in all the assemblies of the Revolution.  The 
Constituent Assembly, at first extremely respectful toward the 
royal authority and its prerogatives, finally proclaimed itself a

sovereign Assembly, and treated Louis XVI as a mere official. 
The Convention, after relatively moderate beginnings, ended with 
a preliminary form of the Terror, when judgments were still 
surrounded by certain legal guarantees: then, quickly increasing 
its powers, it enacted a law depriving all accused persons of the

right of defence, permitting their condemnation upon the mere 
suspicion of being suspect.  Yielding more and more to its 
sanguinary frenzy, it finally decimated itself.  Girondists, 
H&eacute;bertists, Dantonists, and Robespierrists successively 
ended their careers at the hands of the executioner. 
</p><p>This exaggeration of the sentiments of assemblies explains

why they were always so little able to control their own 
destinies and why they so often arrived at conclusions exactly 
contrary to the ends proposed.  Catholic and royalist, the 
Constituent Assembly, instead of the constitutional monarchy it 
wished to establish and the religion it wished to defend, rapidly

led France to a violent republic and the persecution of the 
clergy. 
 
 
<pb n="116"/>  
 
</p><p>Political assemblies are composed, as we have seen, of 
heterogeneous groups, but they have sometimes been formed of 
homogeneous groups, as, for instance, certain of the clubs, which

played so enormous a part during the Revolution, and whose 
psychology deserves a special examination. 
 
 
2.  <hi rend="italic">The Psychology of the Revolutionary Clubs</hi>. 
 
</p><p>Small assemblies of men possessing the same opinions, the 
same beliefs, and the same interests, which eliminate all 
dissentient voices, differ from the great assemblies by the unity

of their sentiments and therefore their wills.  Such were the 
communes, the religious congregations, the corporations, and the 
clubs during the Revolution, the secret societies during the 
first half of the nineteenth century, and the Freemasons and 
syndicalists of to-day. 
</p><p>The points of difference between a heterogeneous assembly 
and a homogeneous club must be thoroughly grasped if we are to 
comprehend the progress of the French Revolution.  Until the 
Directory and especially during the Convention the Revolution was

directed by the clubs. 
</p><p>Despite the unity of will due to the absence of dissident 
parties the clubs obey the laws of the psychology of crowds. 
They are consequently subjugated by leaders.  This we see 
especially in the Jacobin Club, which was dominated by 
Robespierre. 
</p><p>The function of the leader of a club, a homogeneous crowd,

is far more difficult than that of a leader of a heterogeneous 
crowd.  The latter may easily be led by harping on a small number

of strings, but in a homogeneous group like a club, whose 
sentiments 
 
 
<pb n="117"/>  
and interests are identical, the leader must know how to humour 
them and is often himself led. 
</p><p>Part of the strength of homogeneous agglomerations resides

in their anonymity.  We know that during the Commune of 1871 a 
few anonymous orders sufficed to effect the burning of the finest

monuments of Paris: the H&ocirc;tel de Ville, the Tuileries, the 
Cour des Comptes, the buildings of the Legion of Honour, &amp;c.  A 
brief order from the anonymous committees, &ldquo;Burn Finances, 
burn Tuileries,&rdquo; &amp;c., was immediately executed.  An unlooked-
for chance only saved the Louvre and its collections.  We know 
too what religious attention is in our days accorded to the most 
absurd injunctions of the anonymous leaders of the trades unions.

The clubs of Paris and the insurrectionary Commune were not less 
scrupulously obeyed at the time of the Revolution.  An order 
emanating from these was sufficient to hurl upon the Assembly a 
popular army which dictated its wishes. 
</p><p>Summing up the history of the Convention in another 
chapter, we shall see how frequent were these irruptions, and 
with what servility the Assembly, which according to the legends 
was so powerful bowed itself before the most imperative 
injunctions of a handful of rioters.  Instructed by experience, 
the Directory closed the clubs and put an end to the invasion of 
the populace by energetically shooting them down. 
</p><p>The Convention had early grasped the superiority of 
homogeneous groups over heterogeneous assemblies in matters of 
government, which is why it subdivided itself into committees 
composed each of a limited number of individuals.  These 
committees&mdash; 
 
 
<pb n="118"/>  
of Public Safety, of Finance, &amp;c.&mdash;formed small sovereign 
assemblies in the midst of the larger Assembly.  Their power was 
held in check only by that of the clubs. 
</p><p>The preceding considerations show the power of groups over

the wills of the members composing them.  If the group is 
homogeneous, this action is considerable; if it is heterogeneous,

it is less considerable but may still become important, either 
because the more powerful groups of an assembly will dominate 
those whose cohesion is weaker or because certain contagious 
sentiments will often extend themselves to all the members of an 
assembly. 
</p><p>A memorable example of this influence of groups occurred 
at the time of the Revolution, when, on the night of the 4th of 
August, the nobles voted, on the proposition of one of their 
members, the abandonment of feudal privileges.  Yet we know that 
the Revolution resulted in part from the refusal of the clergy 
and the nobles to renounce their privileges.  Why did they refuse

to renounce them at first?  Simply because men in a crowd do not 
act as the same men singly.  Individually no member of the 
nobility would ever have abandoned his rights. 
</p><p>Of this influence of assemblies upon their members 
Napoleon at St. Helena cited some curious examples:  &ldquo;Nothing

was more common than to meet with men at this period quite unlike

the reputation that their acts and words would seem to justify. 
For instance, one might have supposed Monge to be a terrible 
fellow; when war was decided upon he mounted the tribune of the 
Jacobins and declared that he would give his two daughters to the

two first soldiers to be 
 
 
<pb n="119"/>  
wounded by the enemy.  He wanted the nobles to be killed, &amp;c. 
Now, Monge was the most gentle and feeble of men, and wouldn't 
have had a chicken killed if he had had to do it with his own 
hands, or even to have it done in his presence.&rdquo; 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d53"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">A Suggested Explanation of the Progressive 
Exaggeration of Sentiments in Assemblies</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>If collective sentiments were susceptible of exact 
quantitative measurement, we might translate them by a curve 
which, after a first gradual ascent, runs upward with extreme 
rapidity and then falls almost vertically.  The equation of this 
curve might be called the equation of the variations of 
collective sentiments subjected to a constant excitation. 
</p><p>It is not always easy to explain the acceleration of 
certain sentiments under the influence of a constant exciting 
cause.  Perhaps, however, one may say that if the laws of 
psychology are comparable to those of mechanics, a cause of 
invariable dimensions acting in a continuous fashion will rapidly

increase the intensity of a sentiment.  We know, for example, 
that a force which is constant in dimension and direction, such 
as gravity acting upon a mass, will cause an accelerated 
movement.  The speed of a free object falling in space under the 
influence of gravity will be about 32 feet during the first 
second, 64 feet during the next, 96 feet during the next, &amp;c.  It

would be easy, were the moving body allowed to fall from a 
sufficient height, to give it a velocity sufficient to perforate 
a plate of steel. 
</p><p>But although this explanation is applicable to the 
acceleration of a sentiment subjected to a constant 
 
 
<pb n="120"/>  
exciting cause, it does not tell us why the effects of 
acceleration finally and suddenly cease.  Such a fall is only 
comprehensible if we bring in physiological factors&mdash;that is, if 
we remember that pleasure, like pain, cannot exceed certain 
limits, and that all sensations, when too violent, result in the 
paralysis of sensation.  Our organism can only support a certain 
maximum of joy, pain, or effort, and it cannot support that 
maximum for long together.  The hand which grasps a dynamometer 
soon exhausts its effort, and is obliged suddenly to let go. 
</p><p>The study of the causes of the rapid disappearance of 
certain groups of sentiments in assemblies will remind us of the 
fact that beside the party which is predominant by means of its 
strength or prestige there are others whose sentiments, 
restrained by this force or prestige, have not reached their full

development.  Some chance circumstance may somewhat weaken the 
prevailing party, when immediately the suppressed sentiments of 
the adverse parties may become preponderant.  The Mountain 
learned this lesson after Thermidor. 
</p><p>All analogies that we may seek to establish between the 
laws of material phenomena and those which condition the 
evolution of affective and mystic factors are evidently extremely

rough.  They must be so until the mechanism of the cerebral 
functions is better understood than it is to-day.

THE OPINIONS OF HISTORIANS CONCERNING THE 
FRENCH REVOLUTION 
</head> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d57"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Historians of the Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>THE most contradictory opinions have been expressed respecting

the French Revolution, and although only a century separates us 
from the period in question it seems impossible as yet to judge 
it calmly.  For de Maistre it was &ldquo;a satanic piece of 
work,&rdquo; and &ldquo;never was the action of the spirit of 
darkness so evidently manifested.&rdquo;  For the modern Jacobins 
it has regenerated the human race. 
</p><p>Foreigners who live in France still regard it as a subject

to be avoided in conversation. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Everywhere,&rdquo; writes Barrett Wendell, &ldquo;this 
memory and these traditions are still endowed with such vitality 
that few persons are capable of considering them dispassionately.

They still excite both enthusiasm and resentment; they are still 
regarded with a loyal and ardent spirit of partisanship.  The 
better you come to understand France the more clearly you see 
that even to-day no study of the 
 
 
<pb n="124"/>  
Revolution strikes any Frenchman as having been impartial.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This observation is perfectly correct.  To be 
interpretable with equity, the events of the past must no 
longer be productive of results and must not touch the 
religious or political beliefs whose inevitable intolerance 
I have denoted. 
</p><p>We must not therefore be surprised that historians express

very different ideas respecting the Revolution.  For a long time 
to come some will still see in it one of the most sinister events

of history, while to others it will remain one of the most 
glorious.  All writers on the subject have believed that they 
have related its course with impartiality, but in general they 
have merely supported contradictory theories of peculiar 
simplicity.  The documents being innumerable and contradictory, 
their conscious or unconscious choice has readily enabled them to

justify their respective theories. 
</p><p>The older historians of the Revolution&mdash;Thiers, Quinet, 
and, despite his talent, Michelet himself, are somewhat eclipsed 
to-day.  Their doctrines were by no means complicated; a historic

fatalism prevails generally in their work.  Thiers regarded the 
Revolution as the result of several centuries of absolute 
monarchy, and the Terror as the necessary consequence of foreign 
invasion.  Quinet described the excesses of 1793 as the result of

a long-continued despotism, but declared that the tyranny of the 
Convention was unnecessary, and hampered the work of the 
Revolution.  Michelet saw in this last merely the work of the 
people, whom he blindly admired, and commenced the glorification 
continued by other historians. 
</p><p>The former reputation of all these historians has 
 
 
<pb n="125"/>  
been to a great extent effaced by that of Taine.  Although 
equally impassioned, he threw a brilliant light upon the 
revolutionary period, and it will doubtless be long before his 
work is superseded. 
</p><p>Work so important is bound to show faults.  Taine is 
admirable in the representation of facts and persons, but he 
attempts to judge by the standard of rational logic events which 
were not dictated by reason, and which, therefore, he cannot 
interpret.  His psychology, excellent when it is merely 
descriptive, is very weak as soon as it becomes explanatory.  To 
affirm that Robespierre was a pedantic &ldquo;swotter&rdquo; is not 
to reveal the causes of his absolute power over the Convention, 
at a time when he had spent several months in decimating it with 
perfect impunity.  It has very justly been said of Taine that he 
saw well and understood little. 
</p><p>Despite these restrictions his work is highly remarkable 
and has not been equalled.  We may judge of his immense influence

by the exasperation which he causes among the faithful defenders 
of Jacobin orthodoxy, of which M. Aulard, professor at the 
Sorbonne, is to-day the high priest.  The latter has devoted two 
years to writing a pamphlet against Taine, every line of which is

steeped in passion.  All this time spent in rectifying a few 
material errors which are not really significant has only 
resulted in the perpetration of the very same errors. 
</p><p>Reviewing his work, M. A. Cochin shows that M. Aulard has 
at least on every other occasion been deceived by his quotations,

whereas Taine erred far more rarely.  The same historian shows 
also that we must not trust M. Aulard's sources. 
</p><p>&ldquo;These sources&mdash;proceedings, pamphlets, journals, 
 
 
<pb n="126"/>  
and the speeches and writings of patriots&mdash;are precisely the 
authentic publications of patriotism, edited by patriots, and 
edited, as a rule, for the benefit of the public.  He ought to 
have seen in all this simply the special pleading of the 
defendant: he had, before his eyes, a ready-made history of the 
Revolution, which presents, side by side with each of the acts of

the `People,' from the massacres of September to the law of 
Prairial, a ready-made explanation according to the republican 
system of defence.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Perhaps the fairest criticism that one can make of the 
work of Taine is that it was left incomplete.  He studied more 
especially the <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of the populace and its leaders 
during the revolutionary period.  This inspired him with pages 
vibrating with an indignation which we can still admire, but 
several important aspects of the Revolution escaped him. 
</p><p>Whatever one may think of the Revolution, an irreducible 
difference will always exist between historians of the school of 
Taine and those of the school of M. Aulard.  The latter regards 
the sovereign people as admirable, while the former shows us that

when abandoned to its instincts and liberated from all social 
restraint it relapses into primitive savagery.  The conception of

M. Aulard, entirely contrary to the lessons of the psychology of 
crowds, is none the less a religious dogma in the eyes of modern 
Jacobins.  They write of the Revolution according to the methods 
of believers, and take for learned works the arguments of virtual

theologians. 
 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d58"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Theory of Fatalism in respect of the 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Advocates and detractors of the Revolution often 
 
 
<pb n="127"/>  
admit the fatality of revolutionary events.  This theory is well 
synthetised in the following passage from the <hi rend="italic">History of the 
Revolution</hi>, by Emile Olivier:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;No man could oppose it.  The blame belongs neither to

those who perished nor to those who survived; there was no 
individual force capable of changing the elements and of 
foreseeing the events which were born of the nature of things and

circumstances.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Taine himself inclines to this idea:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;At the moment when the States General were opened the

course of ideas and events was not only determined but even 
visible.  Each generation unwittingly bears within itself its 
future and its past; from the latter its destinies might have 
been foretold long before the issue.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Other modern authors, who profess no more indulgence for 
the violence of the revolutionaries than did Taine, are equally 
convinced of this fatality.  M. Sorel, after recalling the saying

of Bossuet concerning the revolutions of antiquity: 
&ldquo;Everything is surprising if we only consider particular 
causes, and yet everything goes forward in regular sequence,&rdquo;

expresses an intention which he very imperfectly realises: 
&ldquo;to show in the Revolution, which seems to some the 
subversion and to others the regeneration of the old European 
world, the natural and necessary result of the history of Europe,

and to show, moreover, that this revolution had no result&mdash;not 
even the most unexpected&mdash;that did not ensue from this history, 
and was not explained by the precedents of the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Guizot also had formerly attempted to prove that our 
Revolution, which he quite wrongly compared to that of England, 
was perfectly natural and effected no innovations:&mdash; 
 
 
<pb n="128"/>  
 
</p><p>&ldquo;Far from having broken with the natural course of 
events in Europe, neither the English revolution nor our own did,

intended, or said anything that had not been said, intended, and 
done a hundred years before its outbreak. 
</p><p>&ldquo; . . . Whether we regard the general doctrines of the

two revolutions or the application made of them&mdash;whether we deal 
with the government of the State or with the civil legislation, 
with property or with persons, with liberty or with power, we 
shall find nothing of which the invention can be attributed to 
them, nothing that will not be encountered elsewhere, or that was

not at least originated in times which we qualify as normal.&rdquo;

</p><p>All these assertions merely recall the banal law that a 
phenomenon is simply the consequence of previous phenomena.  Such

very general propositions do not teach us much. 
</p><p>We must not try to explain too many events by the 
principle of fatality adopted by so many historians.  I have 
elsewhere discussed the significance of such fatalities, and have

shown that the whole effort of civilisation consists in trying to

escape therefrom.  Certainly history is full of necessities, but 
it is also full of contingent facts which were, and might not 
have been.  Napoleon himself, on St. Helena, enumerated six 
circumstances which might have checked his prodigious career.  He

related, notably, that on taking a bath at Auxonne, in 1786, he 
only escaped death by the fortuitous presence of a sandbank.  If 
Bonaparte had died, then we may admit that another general would 
have arisen, and might have become dictator.  But what would have

become of the Imperial epic and its consequences 
 
 
<pb n="129"/>  
without the man of genius who led our victorious armies into all 
the capitals of Europe? 
</p><p>It is permissible to consider the Revolution as being 
partly a necessity, but it was above all&mdash;which is what the 
fatalistic writers already cited do not show us&mdash;a permanent 
struggle between theorists who were imbued with a new ideal, and 
the economic, social, and political laws which ruled mankind, and

which they did not understand.  Not understanding them, they 
sought in vain to direct the course of events, were exasperated 
at their failure, and finally committed every species of 
violence.  They decreed that the paper money known as 
<hi rend="italic">assignats</hi> should be accepted as the equivalent of gold, 
and all their threats could not prevent the fictitious value of 
such money falling almost to nothing.  They decreed the law of 
the maximum, and it merely increased the evils it was intended to

remedy.  Robespierre declared before the Convention &ldquo;that all

the <hi rend="italic">sans-culottes</hi> will be paid at the expense of the 
public treasury, which will be fed by the rich,&rdquo; and in spite

of requisitions and the guillotine the treasury remained empty. 
</p><p>Having broken all human restraints, the men of the 
Revolution finally discovered that a society cannot live without 
them; but when they sought to create them anew they saw that even

the strongest society, though supported by the fear of the 
guillotine, could not replace the discipline which the past had 
slowly built up in the minds of men.  As for understanding the 
evolution of society, or judging men's hearts and minds, or 
foreseeing the consequences of the laws they enacted, they 
scarcely attempted to do so. 
</p><p>The events of the Revolution did not ensue from 
 
 
<pb n="130"/>  
irreducible necessities.  They were far more the consequence of 
Jacobin principles than of circumstances, and might have been 
quite other than they were.  Would the Revolution have followed 
the same path if Louis XVI. had been better advised, or if the 
Constituent Assembly had been less cowardly in times of popular 
insurrection?  The theory of revolutionary fatality is only 
useful to justify violence by presenting it as inevitable. 
</p><p>Whether we are dealing with science or with history we 
must beware of the ignorance which takes shelter under the 
shibboleth of fatalism Nature was formerly full of a host of 
fatalities which science is slowly contriving to avoid.  The 
function of the superior man is, as I have shown elsewhere, to 
avert such fatalities.

<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d59"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Hesitations of recent Historians of the 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The historians whose ideas we have examined in the preceding 
chapter were extremely positive in their special pleading. 
Confined within the limits of belief, they did not attempt to 
penetrate the domain of knowledge.  A monarchical writer was 
violently hostile to the Revolution, and a liberal writer was its

violent apologist. 
</p><p>At the present time we can see the commencement of a 
movement which will surely lead to the study of the Revolution as

one of those scientific phenomena into which the opinions and 
beliefs of a writer enter so little that the reader does not even

suspect them. 
</p><p>This period has not yet come into being; we are still in 
the period of doubt.  The liberal writers who used to be so 
positive are now so no longer.  One 
 
 
<pb n="131"/>  
may judge of this new state of mind by the following extracts 
from recent authors:&mdash; 
</p><p>M. Hanotaux, having vaunted the utility of the Revolution,

asks whether its results were not bought too dearly, and adds:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;History hesitates, and will, for a long time yet, 
hesitate to answer.&rdquo; 
</p><p>M. Madelin is equally dubious in the book he has recently 
published:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I have never felt sufficient authority to form, even 
in my inmost conscience, a categorical judgment on so complex a 
phenomenon as the French Revolution.  To-day I find it even more 
difficult to form a brief judgement.  Causes, facts, and 
consequences seem to me to be still extremely debatable 
subjects.&rdquo; 
</p><p>One may obtain a still better idea of the transformation 
of the old ideas concerning the Revolution by perusing the latest

writings of its official defenders.  While they professed 
formerly to justify every act of violence by representing it as a

simple act of defence, they now confine themselves to pleading 
extenuating circumstances.  I find a striking proof of this new 
frame of mind in the history of France for the use of schools, 
published by MM. Aulard and Debidour.  Concerning the Terror we 
read the following lines:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Blood flowed in waves; there were acts of injustice 
and crimes which were useless from the point of view of national 
defence, and odious.  But men had lost their heads in the 
tempest, and, harassed by a thousand dangers, the patriots struck

out in their rage.&rdquo; 
</p><p>We shall see in another part of this work that the first 
of the two authors whom I have cited is, in spite 
 
 
<pb n="132"/>  
of his uncompromising Jacobinism, by no means indulgent toward 
the men formerly qualified as the &ldquo;Giants of the 
Convention.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The judgments of foreigners upon our Revolution are 
usually distinctly severe, and we cannot be surprised when we 
remember how Europe suffered during the twenty years of upheaval 
in France. 
</p><p>The Germans in particular have been most severe.  Their 
opinion is summed up in the following lines by M. Faguet:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Let us say it courageously and patriotically, for 
patriotism consists above all in telling the truth to one's own 
country:  Germany sees in France, with regard to the past, a 
people who, with the great words `liberty' and `fraternity' in 
its mouth, oppressed, trampled, murdered, pillaged, and fleeced 
her for fifteen years; and with regard to the present, a people 
who, with the same words on its banners, is organising a 
despotic, oppressive, mischievous, and ruinous democracy, which 
none would seek to imitate.  This is what Germany may well see in

France; and this, according to her books and journals, is, we may

assure ourselves, what she does see.&rdquo; 
</p><p>For the rest, whatever the worth of the verdicts 
pronounced upon the French Revolution, we may be certain that the

writers of the future will consider it as an event as 
passionately interesting as it is instructive. 
</p><p>A Government bloodthirsty enough to guillotine old men of 
eighty years, young girls, and little children: which covered 
France with ruins, and yet succeeded in repulsing Europe in arms;

an archduchess of Austria, Queen of France, dying on the 
scaffold, 
 
 
 
<pb n="133"/>  
and a few years later another archduchess, her relative, 
replacing her on the same throne and marrying a sub-lieutenant, 
turned Emperor&mdash;here are tragedies unique in human history.  The 
psychologists, above all, will derive lessons from a history 
hitherto so little studied by them.  No doubt they will finally 
discover that psychology can make no progress until it renounces 
chimerical theories and laboratory experiments in order to study 
the events and the men who surround us.<ref target="n7">7</ref>

<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d60"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">Impartiality in History</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Impartiality has always been considered as the most essential 
quality of the historian.  All historians since Tacitus have 
assured us that they are impartial. 
 
 
<pb n="134"/>  
 
</p><p>In reality the writer sees events as the painter sees a 
landscape&mdash;that is, through his own temperament; through his 
character and the mind of the race. 
</p><p>A number of artists, placed before the same landscape, 
would necessarily interpret it in as many different fashions. 
Some would lay stress upon details neglected by others.  Each 
reproduction would thus be a personal work&mdash;that is to say, would

be interpreted by a certain form of sensibility. 
</p><p>It is the same with the writer.  We can no more speak of 
the impartiality of the historian than we can speak of the 
impartiality of the painter. 
</p><p>Certainly the historian may confine himself to the 
reproduction of documents, and this is the present tendency.  But

these documents, for periods as near us as the Revolution, are so

abundant that a man's whole life would not suffice to go through 
them.  Therefore the historian must make a choice. 
</p><p>Consciously sometimes, but more often unconsciously, the 
author will select the material which best corresponds with his 
political, moral, and social opinions. 
</p><p>It is therefore impossible, unless he contents himself 
with simple chronologies summing up each event with a few words 
and a date, to produce a truly impartial volume of history.  No 
author could be impartial; and it is not to be regretted.  The 
claim to impartiality, so common to-day, results in those flat, 
gloomy, and prodigiously wearisome works which render the 
comprehension of a period completely impossible. 
</p><p>Should the historian, under a pretext of impartiality, 
abstain from judging men&mdash;that is, from speaking in tones of 
admiration or reprobation? 
 
 
<pb n="135"/>  
 
</p><p>This question, I admit, allows of two very different 
solutions, each of which is perfectly correct, according to the 
point of view assumed&mdash;that of the moralist or that of the 
psychologist. 
</p><p>The moralist must think exclusively of the interest of 
society, and must judge men only according to that interest.  By 
the very fact that it exists and wishes to continue to exist a 
society is obliged to admit a certain number of rules, to have an

indestructible standard of good and evil, and consequently to 
create very definite distinctions between vice and virtue.  It 
thus finally creates average types, to which the man of the 
period approaches more or less closely, and from which he cannot 
depart very widely without peril to society. 
</p><p>It is by such similar types and the rules derived from 
social necessities that the moralist must judge the men of the 
past.  Praising those which were useful and blaming the rest, he 
thus helps to form the moral types which are indispensable to the

progress of civilisation and which may serve others as models. 
Poets such as Corneille, for example, create heroes superior to 
the majority of men, and possibly inimitable; but they thereby 
help greatly to stimulate our efforts.  The example of heroes 
must always be set before a people in order to ennoble its mind. 
</p><p>Such is the moralist's point of view.  That of the 
psychologist would be quite different.  While a society has no 
right to be tolerant, because its first duty is to live, the 
psychologist may remain indifferent.  Considering things as a 
scientist, he no longer asks their utilitarian value, but seeks 
merely to explain them. 
 
 
<pb n="136"/>  
 
</p><p>His situation is that of the observer before any 
phenomenon.  It is obviously difficult to read in cold blood that

Carrier ordered his victims to be buried up to the neck so that 
they might then be blinded and subjected to horrible torments. 
Yet if we wish to comprehend such acts we must be no more 
indignant than the naturalist before the spider slowly devouring 
a fly.  As soon as the reason is moved it is no longer reason, 
and can explain nothing. 
</p><p>The functions of the historian and the psychologist are 
not, as we see, identical, but of both we may demand the 
endeavour, by a wise interpretation of the facts, to discover, 
under the visible evidences, the invisible forces which determine

them.

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d62"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Absolute Monarchy and the Bases of the Ancien

R&eacute;gime</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>MANY historians assure us that the Revolution was directed 
against the autocracy of the monarchy.  In reality the kings of 
France had ceased to be absolute monarchs long before its 
outbreak. 
</p><p>Only very late in history&mdash;not until the reign of Louis 
XIV.&mdash;did they finally obtain incontestable power.  All the 
preceding sovereigns, even the most powerful, such as Francis I.,

for example, had to sustain a constant struggle either against 
the seigneurs, or the clergy, or the parliaments, and they did 
not always win.  Francis himself had not sufficient power to 
protect his most intimate friends against the Sorbonne and the 
Parliament.  His friend and councillor Berquin, having offended 
the Sorbonne, was arrested upon the order of the latter body. 
The king ordered his release, which was refused.  He was obliged 
to send archers to remove him from the Conciergerie, and could 
find no other means of protecting him than that of keeping him 
beside him in the Louvre.  The Sorbonne by no means considered 
itself beaten.  Profiting by the king's absence, it arrested 
 
 
<pb n="138"/>  
Berquin again and had him tried by Parliament.  Condemned at ten 
in the morning, he was burned alive at noon. 
</p><p>Built up very gradually, the power of the kings of France 
was not absolute until the time of Louis XIV.  It then rapidly 
declined, and it would be truly difficult to speak of the 
absolutism of Louis XVI. 
</p><p>This pretended master was the slave of his court, his 
ministers, the clergy, and the nobles.  He did what they forced 
him to do and rarely what he wished.  Perhaps no Frenchman was so

little free as the king. 
</p><p>The great power of the monarchy resided originally in the 
Divine origin which was attributed to it, and in the traditions 
which had accumulated during the ages.  These formed the real 
social framework of the country. 
</p><p>The true cause of the disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi> was simply the weakening of the traditions 
which served as its foundations.  When after repeated criticism 
it could find no more defenders, the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> 
crumbled like a building whose foundations have been destroyed. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d63"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Inconveniences of the Ancien 
R&eacute;gime</hi></head> 
 
<p>A long-established system of government will always finally 
seem acceptable to the people governed.  Habit masks its 
inconveniences, which appear only when men begin to think.  Then 
they ask how they could ever have supported them.  The truly 
unhappy man is the man who believes himself miserable. 
</p><p>It was precisely this belief which was gaining ground at 
the time of the Revolution, under the influence of the writers 
whose work we shall presently study. 
 
 
 
<pb n="139"/>  
 
Then the imperfections of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> stared 
all men in the face.  They were numerous; it is enough to mention

a few. 
</p><p>Despite the apparent authority of the central power, the 
kingdom, formed by the successive conquest of independent 
provinces, was divided into territories each of which had its own

laws and customs, and each of which paid different imposts. 
Internal customs-houses separated them.  The unity of France was 
thus somewhat artificial.  It represented an aggregate of various

countries which the repeated efforts of the kings, including 
Louis XIV., had not succeeded in wholly unifying.  The most 
useful effect of the Revolution was this very unification. 
</p><p>To such material divisions were added social divisions 
constituted by different classes&mdash;nobles, clergy, and the Third 
Estate, whose rigid barriers could only with the utmost 
difficulty be crossed. 
</p><p>Regarding the division of the classes as one of its 
sources of power, the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> had rigorously 
maintained that division.  This became the principal cause of the

hatreds which the system inspired.  Much of the violence of the 
triumphant <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> represented vengeance for a long 
past of disdain and oppression.  The wounds of self-love are the 
most difficult of all to forget.  The Third Estate had suffered 
many such wounds.  At a meeting of the States General in 1614, at

which its representatives were obliged to remain bareheaded on 
their knees, one member of the Third Estate having dared to say 
that the three orders were like three brothers, the spokesman of 
the nobles replied &ldquo;that there was no fraternity between it 
and the Third; that the nobles did not 
 
 
<pb n="140"/>  
wish the children of cobblers and tanners to call them their 
brothers.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Despite the march of enlightenment the nobles and the 
clergy obstinately preserved their privileges and their demands, 
no longer justifiable now that these classes had ceased to render

services. 
</p><p>Kept from the exercise of public functions by the royal 
power, which distrusted them, and progressively replaced by a 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> which was more and more learned and capable, 
the social <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of nobility and clergy was only an 
empty show.  This point has been luminously expounded by Taine:&mdash;

</p><p>&ldquo;Since the nobility, having lost its special capacity,

and the Third Estate, having acquired general capacity, were now 
on a level in respect of education and aptitudes, the inequality 
which divided them had become hurtful and useless.  Instituted by

custom, it was no longer ratified by the consciousness, and the 
Third Estate was with reason angered by privileges which nothing 
justified, neither the capacity of the nobles nor the incapacity 
of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p><p>By reason of the rigidity of castes established by a long 
past we cannot see what could have persuaded the nobles and the 
clergy to renounce their privileges.  Certainly they did finally 
abandon them one memorable evening, when events forced them to do

so; but then it was too late, and the Revolution, unchained, was 
pursuing its course. 
</p><p>It is certain that modern progress would successively have

established all that the Revolution effected&mdash;the equality of 
citizens before the law, the suppression of the privileges of 
birth, &amp;c.  Despite the conservative spirit of the Latins, these 
things would have 
 
 
<pb n="141"/>  
been won, as they were by the majority of the peoples.  We might 
in this manner have been saved twenty years of warfare and 
devastation; but we must have had a different mental 
constitution, and, above all, different statesmen. 
</p><p>The profound hostility of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> against 
the classes maintained above it by tradition was one of the great

factors of the Revolution, and perfectly explains why, after its 
triumph, the first class despoiled the vanquished of their 
wealth.  They behaved as conquerors&mdash;like William the Conqueror, 
who, after the conquest of England, distributed the soil among 
his soldiers. 
</p><p>But although the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> detested the nobility 
they had no hatred for royalty, and did not regard it as 
revocable.  The maladdress of the king and his appeals to foreign

powers only very gradually made him unpopular. 
</p><p>The first Assembly never dreamed of founding a republic. 
Extremely royalist, in fact, it thought simply to substitute a 
constitutional for an absolute monarchy.  Only the consciousness 
of its increasing power exasperated it against the resistance of 
the king; but it dared not overthrow him. 
 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d64"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Life under the Ancien R&eacute;gime</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>It is difficult to form a very clear idea of life under the 
<hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>, and, above all, of the real 
situation of the peasants. 
</p><p>The writers who defend the Revolution as theologians 
defend religious dogmas draw such gloomy pictures of the 
existence of the peasants under the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> 
that we ask ourselves how it was that 
 
 
<pb n="142"/>  
all these unhappy creatures had not died of hunger long before. 
A good example of this style of writing may be found in a book by

M. A. Rambaud, formerly professor at the Sorbonne, published 
under the title <hi rend="italic">History of the French Revolution</hi>.  One 
notices especially an engraving bearing the legend, <hi rend="italic">Poverty of

Peasants under Louis XIV</hi>.  In the foreground a man is 
fighting some dogs for some bones, which for that matter are 
already quite fleshless.  Beside him a wretched fellow is 
twisting himself and compressing his stomach.  Farther back a 
woman lying on the ground is eating grass.  At the back of the 
landscape figures of which one cannot say whether they are 
corpses or persons starving are also stretched on the soil.  As 
an example of the administration of the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi> the same author assures us that &ldquo;a place in

the police cost 300 livres and brought in 400,000.&rdquo;  Such 
figures surely indicate a great disinterestedness on the part of 
those who sold such productive employment!  He also informs us 
&ldquo;that it cost only 120 livres to get people arrested,&rdquo; 
and that &ldquo;under Louis XV. more than 150,000 <hi rend="italic">lettres de 
cachet</hi> were distributed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The majority of books dealing with the Revolution are 
conceived with as little impartiality and critical spirit, which 
is one reason why this period is really so little known to us. 
</p><p>Certainly there is no lack of documents, but they are 
absolutely contradictory.  To the celebrated description of La 
Bruy&eacute;re we may oppose the enthusiastic picture drawn by 
the English traveller Young of the prosperous condition of the 
peasants of some of the French provinces. 
 
 
<pb n="143"/>  
 
</p><p>Were they really crushed by taxation, and did they, as has

been stated, pay four-fifths of their revenue instead of a fifth 
as to-day?  Impossible to say with certainty.  One capital fact, 
however, seems to prove that under the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi> the situation of the inhabitants of the rural 
districts could not have been so very wretched, since it seems 
established that more than a third of the soil had been bought by

peasants. 
</p><p>We are better informed as to the financial system.  It was

very oppressive and extremely complicated.  The budgets usually 
showed deficits, and the imposts of all kinds were raised by 
tyrannical farmers-general.  At the very moment of the Revolution

this condition of the finances became the cause of universal 
discontent, which is expressed in the <hi rend="italic">cahiers</hi> of the 
States General.  Let us remark that these <hi rend="italic">cahiers</hi> did not 
represent a previous state of affairs, but an actual condition 
due to a crisis of poverty produced by the bad harvest of 1788 
and the hard winter of 1789.  What would these <hi rend="italic">cahiers</hi> 
have told us had they been written ten years earlier? 
</p><p>Despite these unfavourable circumstances the 
<hi rend="italic">cahiers</hi> contained no revolutionary ideas.  The most 
advanced merely asked that taxes should be imposed only with the 
consent of the States General and paid by all alike.  The same 
<hi rend="italic">cahiers</hi> sometimes expressed a wish that the power of the 
king should be limited by a Constitution defining his rights and 
those of the nation.  If these wishes had been granted a 
constitutional monarchy could very easily have been 
substituted for the absolute monarchy, and the Revolution 
would probably have been avoided. 
 
 
<pb n="144"/>  
 
</p><p>Unhappily, the nobility and the clergy were too strong and

Louis XVI. too weak for such a solution to be possible. 
</p><p>Moreover, it would have been rendered extremely difficult 
by the demands of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, who claimed to 
substitute themselves for the nobles, and were the real authors 
of the Revolution.  The movement started by the middle classes 
rapidly exceeded their hopes, needs, and aspirations.  They had 
claimed equality for their own profit, but the people also 
demanded equality.  The Revolution thus finally became the 
popular government which it was not and had no intention of 
becoming at the outset. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d65"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">Evolution of Monarchical Feeling during the 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Despite the slow evolution of the affective elements, it is 
certain that during the Revolution the sentiments, not of the 
people only, but also of the revolutionary Assemblies with regard

to the monarchy, underwent a very rapid change.  Between the 
moment when the legislators of the first Assembly surrounded 
Louis XVI. with respect and the moment when his head was cut off 
a very few years had elapsed. 
</p><p>These changes, superficial rather than profound, were in 
reality a mere transposition of sentiments of the same order. 
The love which the men of this period professed for the king was 
transferred to the new Government which had inherited his power. 
The mechanism of such a transfer may easily be demonstrated. 
</p><p>Under the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>, the sovereign, 
holding his power by Divine right, was for this reason 
 
 
<pb n="145"/>  
invested with a kind of supernatural power.  His people looked up

to him from every corner of the country. 
</p><p>This mystic belief in the absolute power of royalty was 
shattered only when repeated experience proved that the power 
attributed to the adored being was fictitious.  He then lost his 
prestige.  Now, when prestige is lost the crowd will not forgive 
the fallen idol for deluding them, and seek anew the idol without

which they cannot exist. 
</p><p>From the outset of the Revolution numerous facts, which 
were daily repeated, revealed to the most fervent believers the 
fact that royalty no longer possessed any power, and that there 
were other powers capable, not only of contending with royalty, 
but possessed of superior force. 
</p><p>What, for instance, was thought of the royal power by the 
multitudes who saw the king held in check by the Assembly, and 
incapable, in the heart of Paris, of defending his strongest 
fortress against the attacks of armed bands? 
</p><p>The royal weakness thus being obvious, the power of the 
Assembly was increasing.  Now, in the eyes of the crowd weakness 
has no prestige; it turns always to force. 
</p><p>In the Assemblies feeling was very fluid, but did not 
evolve very rapidly, for which reason the monarchical faith 
survived the taking of the Bastille the flight of the king, and 
his understanding with foreign sovereigns. 
</p><p>The royalist faith was still so powerful that the Parisian

riots and the events which led to the execution of Louis XVI. 
were not enough finally 
 
 
<pb n="146"/>  
to destroy, in the provinces, the species of secular piety which 
enveloped the old monarchy.<ref target="n8">8</ref> 
</p><p>It persisted in a great part of France during the whole of

the Revolution, and was the origin of the royalist conspiracies 
and insurrections in various departments which the Convention had

such trouble to suppress.  The royalist faith had disappeared in 
Paris, where the weakness of the king was too plainly visible; 
but in the provinces the royal power, representing God on earth, 
still retained its prestige. 
</p><p>The royalist sentiments of the people must have been 
deeply rooted to survive the guillotine.  The royalist movements 
persisted, indeed, during the whole of the Revolution, and were 
accentuated under the Directory, when forty-nine departments sent

royalist deputies to Paris, which provoked the Directory to the 
<hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi> of Fructidor. 
</p><p>This monarchical-feeling, with difficulty repressed by the

Revolution, contributed to the success of Bonaparte when he came 
to occupy the throne of the ancient kings, and in great measure 
to re-establish the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>.

MENTAL ANARCHY AT THE TIME OF THE REVOLUTION

</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d67"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Origin and Propagation of Revolutionary 
Ideas</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>THE outward life of men in every age is moulded upon an inward

life consisting of a framework of traditions, sentiments, and 
moral influences which direct their conduct and maintain certain 
fundamental notions which they accept without discussion. 
</p><p>Let the resistance of this social framework weaken, and 
ideas which could have had no force before will germinate and 
develop.  Certain theories whose success was enormous at the time

of the Revolution would have encountered an impregnable wall two 
centuries earlier. 
</p><p>The aim of these considerations is to recall to the reader

the fact that the outward events of revolutions are always a 
consequence of invisible transformations which have slowly gone 
forward in men's minds.  Any profound study of a revolution 
necessitates a study of the mental soil upon which the ideas that

direct its course have to germinate. 
</p><p>Generally slow in the extreme, the evolution of ideas is 
often invisible for a whole generation.  Its extent can only be 
grasped by comparing the mental condition 
 
 
<pb n="148"/>  
of the same social classes at the two extremities of the curve 
which the mind has followed.  To realise the different 
conceptions of royalty entertained by educated men under Louis 
XIV. and Louis XVI., we must compare the political theories of 
Bossuet and Turgot. 
</p><p>Bossuet expressed the general conceptions of his time 
concerning the absolute monarchy when he based the authority of a

Government upon the will of God, &ldquo;sole judge of the actions 
of kings, always irresponsible before men.&rdquo;  Religious faith 
was then as strong as the monarchical faith from which it seemed 
inseparable, and no philosopher could have shaken it. 
</p><p>The writings of the reforming ministers of Louis XVI., 
those of Turgot, for instance, are animated by quite another 
spirit.  Of the Divine right of kings there is hardly a word, and

the rights of the peoples begin to be clearly defined. 
</p><p>Many events had contributed to prepare for such an 
evolution&mdash;unfortunate wars, famines, imposts, general poverty at

the end of the reign of Louis XV., &amp;c.  Slowly destroyed, respect

for monarchical authority was replaced by a mental revolt which 
was ready to manifest itself as soon as occasion should arise. 
</p><p>When once the mental framework commences to crumble the 
end comes rapidly.  This is why at the time of the Revolution 
ideas were so quickly propagated which were by no means new, but 
which until then had exerted no influence, as they had not fallen

on fruitful ground. 
</p><p>Yet the ideas which were then so attractive and effectual 
had often been expressed.  For a long time they had inspired the 
politics of England.  Two thousand years earlier the Greek and 
Latin authors 
 
 
<pb n="149"/>  
had written in defence of liberty, had cursed tyrants, and 
proclaimed the rights of popular sovereignty. 
</p><p>The middle classes who effected the Revolution, although, 
like their fathers, they had learned all these things in text-books, were not in any degree moved by them, because the moment 
when such ideas could move them had not arrived.  How should the 
people have been impressed by them at a time when all men were 
accustomed to regard all hierarchies as natural necessities? 
</p><p>The actual influence of the philosophers in the genesis of

the Revolution was not that which was attributed to them.  They 
revealed nothing new, but they developed the critical spirit 
which no dogma can resist once the way is prepared for its 
downfall. 
</p><p>Under the influence of this developing critical spirit 
things which were no longer very greatly respected came to be 
respected less and less.  When tradition and prestige had 
disappeared the social edifice suddenly fell. 
</p><p>This progressive disaggregation finally descended to the 
people, but was not commenced by the people.  The people follows 
examples, but never sets them. 
</p><p>The philosophers, who could not have exerted any influence

over the people, did exert a great influence over the enlightened

portion of the nation.  The unemployed nobility, who had long 
been ousted from their old functions, and who were consequently 
inclined to be censorious, followed their leadership.  Incapable 
of foresight, the nobles were the first to break with the 
traditions that were their only <hi rend="italic">raison d'&ecirc;tre</hi>.  As 
steeped in humanitarianism and rationalism as the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> of to-day, they continually sapped their 
 
 
<pb n="150"/>  
own privileges by their criticisms.  As to-day, the most ardent 
reformers were found among the favourites of fortune.  The 
aristocracy encouraged dissertations on the social contract, the 
rights of man, and the equality of citizens.  At the theatre it 
applauded plays which criticised privileges, the arbitrariness 
and the incapacity of men in high places, and abuses of all 
kinds. 
</p><p>As soon as men lose confidence in the foundations of the 
mental framework which guides their conduct they feel at first 
uneasy and then discontented.  All classes felt their old motives

of action gradually disappearing.  Things that had seemed sacred 
for centuries were now sacred no longer. 
</p><p>The censorious spirit of the nobility and of the writers 
of the day would not have sufficed to move the heavy load of 
tradition, but that its action was added to that of other 
powerful influences.  We have already stated, in citing Bossuet, 
that under the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> the religious and 
civil governments, widely separated in our days, were intimately 
connected.  To injure one was inevitably to injure the other. 
Now, even before the monarchical idea was shaken the force of 
religious tradition was greatly diminished among cultivated men. 
The constant progress of knowledge had sent an increasing number 
of minds from theology to science by opposing the truth observed 
to the truth revealed. 
</p><p>This mental evolution, although as yet very vague, was 
sufficient to show that the traditions which for so many 
centuries had guided men had not the value which had been 
attributed to them, and that it would soon be necessary to 
replace them. 
 
 
<pb n="151"/>  
 
</p><p>But where discover the new elements which might; take the 
place of tradition?  Where seek the magic ring which would raise 
a new social edifice on the remains of that which no longer 
contented men? 
</p><p>Men were agreed in attributing to reason the power that 
tradition and the gods seemed to have lost.  How could its force 
be doubted?  Its discoveries having been innumerable, was it not 
legitimate to suppose that by applying it to the construction of 
societies it would entirely transform them?  Its possible 
function increased very rapidly in the thoughts of the more 
enlightened, in proportion as tradition seemed more and more to 
be distrusted. 
</p><p>The sovereign power attributed to reason must be regarded 
as the culminating idea which not only engendered the Revolution 
but governed it throughout.  During the whole Revolution men gave

themselves up to the most persevering efforts to break with the 
past, and to erect society upon a new plan dictated by logic. 
</p><p>Slowly filtering downward, the rationalistic theories of 
the philosophers meant to the people simply that all the things 
which had been regarded as worthy of respect were now no longer 
worthy.  Men being declared equal, the old masters need no longer

be obeyed. 
</p><p>The multitude easily succeeded in ceasing to respect what 
the upper classes themselves no longer respected.  When the 
barrier of respect was down the Revolution was accomplished. 
</p><p>The first result of this new mentality was a general 
insubordination.  Mme. Vig&eacute;e Lebrun relates that on the 
promenade at Longchamps men of the people 
 
 
<pb n="152"/>  
leaped on the footboards of the carriages, saying, &ldquo;Next year

you will be behind and we shall be inside.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The populace was not alone in manifesting insubordination 
and discontent.  These sentiments were general on the eve of the 
Revolution.  &ldquo;The lesser clergy,&rdquo; says Taine, &ldquo;are 
hostile to the prelates; the provincial gentry to the nobility of

the court; the vassals to the seigneurs; the peasants to the 
townsmen,&rdquo; &amp;c. 
</p><p>This state of mind, which had been communicated from the 
nobles and clergy to the people, also invaded the army.  At the 
moment the States General were opened Necker said:  &ldquo;We are 
not sure of the troops.&rdquo;  The officers were becoming 
humanitarian and philosophical.  The soldiers, recruited from the

lowest class of the population, did not philosophise, but they no

longer obeyed. 
</p><p>In their feeble minds the ideas of equality meant simply 
the suppression of all leaders and masters, and therefore of all 
obedience.  In 1790 more than twenty r&eacute;giments threatened 
their officers, and sometimes, as at Nancy, threw them into 
prison. 
</p><p>The mental anarchy which, after spreading through all the 
classes of society, finally invaded the army was the principal 
cause of the disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>. 
&ldquo;It was the defection of the army affected by the ideas of 
the Third Estate,&rdquo; wrote Rivarol, &ldquo;that destroyed 
royalty.&rdquo;

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The supposed Influence of the Philosophers of the 
Eighteenth Century upon the Genesis of the Revolution&mdash;Their 
dislike of Democracy</hi>. 
</head> 
 
<p>Although the philosophers who have been supposed the inspirers

of the French Revolution did attack 
 
 
<pb n="153"/>  
certain privileges and abuses, we must not for that reason regard

them as partisans of popular government.  Democracy, whose 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> in Greek history was familiar to them, was 
generally highly antipathetic to them.  They were not ignorant of

the destruction and violence which are its invariable 
accompaniments, and knew that in the time of Aristotle it was 
already defined as &ldquo;a State in which everything, even the 
law, depends on the multitude set up as a tyrant and governed by 
a few declamatory speakers.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Pierre Bayle, the true forerunner of Voltaire, recalled in

the following terms the consequences of popular government in 
Athens:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;If one considers this history, which displays at 
great length the tumult of the assemblies, the factions dividing 
the city, the seditious disturbing it, the most illustrious 
subjects persecuted, exiled, and punished by death at the will of

a violent windbag, one would conclude that this people, which so 
prided itself on its liberty, was really the slave of a small 
number of caballers, whom they called demagogues, and who made it

turn now in this direction, now in that, as their passions 
changed, almost as the sea heaps the waves now one way, now 
another, according to the winds which trouble it.  You will seek 
in vain in Macedonia, which was a monarchy, for as many examples 
of tyranny as Athenian history will afford.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Montesquieu had no greater admiration for the democracy. 
Having described the three forms of government&mdash;republican, 
monarchical, and despotic&mdash;he shows very clearly what popular 
government may lead to:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Men were free with laws; men would fain be free 
 
 
<pb n="154"/>  
without them; what was a maxim is called severity; what was order

is called hindrance.  Formerly the welfare of individuals 
constituted the public wealth, but now the public wealth becomes 
the patrimony of individuals.  The republic is spoil, and its 
strength is merely the power of a few citizens and the licence of

all.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;. . . Little petty tyrants spring up who have all the

vices of a single tyrant.  Very soon what is left of liberty 
becomes untenable; a single tyrant arises, and the people loses 
all, even the advantages of corruption. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Democracy has therefore two extremes to avoid; the 
extreme of the spirit of equality leads to the despotism of a 
single person, as the despotism of a single person leads to 
conquest.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The ideal of Montesquieu was the English constitutional 
government, which prevented the monarchy from degenerating into 
despotism.  Otherwise the influence of this philosopher at the 
moment of the Revolution was very slight. 
</p><p>As for the Encyclop&aelig;dists, to whom such a 
considerable <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> is attributed, they hardly dealt
with 
politics, excepting d'Holbach, a liberal monarchist like Voltaire

and Diderot.  They wrote chiefly in defence of individual 
liberty, opposing the encroachments of the Church, at that time 
extremely intolerant and inimical to philosophers.  Being neither

Socialists nor democrats, the Revolution could not utilise any of

their principles. 
</p><p>Voltaire himself was by no means a partisan of democracy. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Democracy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;seems only to suit a 
very small country, and even then it must be fortunately 
 
 
<pb n="155"/>  
situated.  Little as it may be, it will make many mistakes, 
because it will be composed of men.  Discord will prevail there 
as in a convent full of monks; but there will be no St. 
Bartholomew's day, no Irish massacres, no Sicilian Vespers, no 
Inquisition, no condemnation to the galleys for having taken 
water from the sea without paying for it; unless we suppose this 
republic to be composed of devils in a corner of hell.&rdquo; 
</p><p>All these men who are supposed to have inspired the 
Revolution had opinions which were far from subversive, and it is

really difficult to see that they had any real influence on the 
development of the revolutionary movement.  Rousseau was one of 
the very few democratic philosophers of his age, which is why his

<hi rend="italic">Contrat Social</hi> became the Bible of the men of the Terror. 
It seemed to furnish the rational justification necessary to 
excuse the acts deriving from unconscious mystic and affective 
impulses which no philosophy had inspired. 
</p><p>To be quite truthful, the democratic instincts of Rousseau

were by no means above suspicion.  He himself considered that his

projects for social reorganisation, based upon popular 
sovereignty, could be applied only to a very small State; and 
when the Poles asked him for a draft democratic Constitution he 
advised them to choose a hereditary monarch. 
</p><p>Among the theories of Rousseau that relating to the 
perfection of the primitive social state had a great success.  He

asserted, together with various writers of his time, that 
primitive mankind was perfect; it was corrupted only by society. 
By modifying society by means of good laws one might bring back 
the 
 
 
<pb n="156"/>  
happiness of the early world.  Ignorant of all psychology, he 
believed that men were the same throughout time and space and 
that they could all be ruled by the same laws and institutions. 
This was then the general belief.  &ldquo;The vices and virtues of 
the people,&rdquo; wrote Helvetius, &ldquo;are always a necessary 
effect of its legislation. . . .  How can we doubt that virtue is

in the case of all peoples the result of the wisdom, more or less

perfect, of the administration?&rdquo; 
</p><p>There could be no greater mistake.

<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Philosophical Ideas of the Bourgeoisie at the 
Time of the Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>It is by no means easy to say just what were the social and 
political conceptions of a Frenchman of the middle classes at the

moment of the Revolution.  They might be reduced to a few 
formul&aelig; concerning fraternity, equality, and popular 
government, summed up in the celebrated Declaration of the Rights

of Man, of which we shall have occasion to quote a few passages. 
</p><p>The philosophers of the eighteenth century do not seem to 
have been very highly rated by the men of the Revolution.  Rarely

are they quoted in the speeches of the time.  Hypnotised by their

classical memories of Greece and Rome, the new legislators re-read their Plato and their Plutarch.  They wished to revive the 
constitution of Sparta, with its manners, its frugal habits, and 
its laws. 
</p><p>Lycurgus, Solon, Miltiades, Manlius Torquatus, Brutus, 
Mucius Sc&aelig;vola, even the fabulous Minos himself, became as 
familiar in the tribune as in the theatre, and the public went 
crazy over them.  The 
 
 
<pb n="157"/>  
shades of the heroes of antiquity hovered over the revolutionary 
assemblies.  Posterity alone has replaced them by the shades of 
the philosophers of the eighteenth century. 
</p><p>We shall see that in reality the men of this period, 
generally represented as bold innovators guided by subtle 
philosophers, professed to effect no innovations whatever, but to

return to a past long buried in the mists of history, and which, 
moreover, they scarcely ever in the least understood. 
</p><p>The more reasonable, who did not go so far back for their 
models, aimed merely at adopting the English constitutional 
system, of which Montesquieu and Voltaire had sung the praises, 
and which all nations were finally to imitate without violent 
crises. 
</p><p>Their ambitions were confined to a desire to perfect the 
existing monarchy, not to overthrow it.  But in time of 
revolution men often take a very different path from that they 
propose to take.  At the time of the convocation of the States 
General no one would ever have supposed that a revolution of 
peaceful <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> and men of letters would rapidly be 
transformed into one of the most sanguinary dictatorships of 
history.

PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLUSIONS RESPECTING THE 
FRENCH REVOLUTION 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d71"> 
<head>1. <hi rend="italic">Illusions respecting Primitive Man, the Return to a 
State of Nature, and the Psychology of the People</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WE have already repeated, and shall again repeat, that the 
errors of a doctrine do not hinder its propagation, so that all 
we have to consider here is its influence upon men's minds. 
</p><p>But although the criticism of erroneous doctrines is 
seldom of practical utility, it is extremely interesting from a 
psychological point of view.  The philosopher who wishes to 
understand the working of men's minds should always carefully 
consider the illusions which they live with.  Never, perhaps, in 
the course of history have these illusions appeared so profound 
and so numerous as during the Revolution. 
</p><p>One of the most prominent was the singular conception of 
the nature of our first ancestors and primitive societies. 
Anthropology not having as yet revealed the conditions of our 
remoter forbears, men supposed, being influenced by the legends 
of the Bible, that man had issued perfect from the hands of the 
Creator.  The first societies were models which were afterwards 
ruined by civilisation, but to which mankind must 
 
 
<pb n="159"/>  
return.  The return to the state of nature was very soon the 
general cry.  &ldquo;The fundamental principle of all morality, of 
which I have treated in my writings,&rdquo; said Rousseau, &ldquo;is 
that man is a being naturally good, loving justice and 
order.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Modern science, by determining, from the surviving 
remnants, the conditions of life of our first ancestors, has long

ago shown the error of this doctrine.  Primitive man has become 
an ignorant and ferocious brute, as ignorant as the modern savage

of goodness, morality, and pity.  Governed only by his 
instinctive impulses, he throws himself on his prey when hunger 
drives him from his cave, and falls upon his enemy the moment he 
is aroused by hatred.  Reason, not being born, could have no hold

over his instincts. 
</p><p>The aim of civilisation, contrary to all revolutionary 
beliefs, has been not to return to the state of nature but to 
escape from it.  It was precisely because the Jacobins led 
mankind back to the primitive condition by destroying all the 
social restraints without which no civilisation can exist that 
they transformed a political society into a barbarian horde. 
</p><p>The ideas of these theorists concerning the nature of man 
were about as valuable as those of a Roman general concerning the

power of omens.  Yet their influence as motives of action was 
considerable.  The Convention was always inspired by such ideas. 
</p><p>The errors concerning our primitive ancestors were 
excusable enough, since before modern discoveries had shown us 
the real conditions of their existence these were absolutely 
unknown.  But the absolute ignorance of human psychology 
displayed by the men of the Revolution is far less easy to 
understand. 
 
 
<pb n="160"/>  
 
</p><p>It would really seem as though the philosophers and 
writers of the eighteenth century must have been totally 
deficient in the smallest faculty of observation.  They lived 
amidst their contemporaries without seeing them and without 
understanding them.  Above all, they had not a suspicion of the 
true nature of the popular mind.  The man of the people always 
appeared to them in the likeness of the chimerical model created 
by their dreams.  As ignorant of psychology as of the teachings 
of history, they considered the plebeian man as naturally good, 
affectionate, grateful, and always ready to listen to reason. 
</p><p>The speeches delivered by members of the Assembly show how

profound were these illusions.  When the peasants began to burn 
the <hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi> they were greatly astonished, and 
addressed them in sentimental harangues, praying them to cease, 
in order not to &ldquo;give pain to their good king,&rdquo; and 
adjured them &ldquo;to surprise him by their virtues.&rdquo;

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Illusions respecting the Possibility of separating 
Man from his Past and the Power of Transformation attributed to 
the Law</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>One of the principles which served as a foundation for the 
revolutionary institutions was that man may readily be cut off 
from his past, and that a society may be re-made in all its parts

by means of institutions.  Persuaded in the light of reason that,

except for the primitive ages which were to serve as models, the 
past represented an inheritance of errors and superstitions, the 
legislators of the day resolved to break entirely with that past.

The better to 
 
 
<pb n="161"/>  
emphasise their intention, they founded a new era, transformed 
the calendar, and changed the names of the months and seasons. 
</p><p>Supposing all men to be alike, they thought they could 
legislate for the human race.  Condorcet imagined that he was 
expressing an evident truth when he said:  &ldquo;A good law must 
be good for all men, just as a geometrical proposition is true 
for all.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The theorists of the Revolution never perceived, behind 
the world of visible things, the secret springs which moved them.

A century of biological progress was needed to show how grievous 
were their mistakes, and how wholly a being of whatever species 
depends on its past. 
</p><p>With the influence of the past, the reformers of the 
Revolution were always clashing, without ever understanding it. 
They wanted to annihilate it, but were annihilated by it instead.

</p><p>The faith of law-makers in the absolute power of laws and 
institutions, rudely shaken by the end of the Revolution, was 
absolute at its outbreak.  Gr&eacute;goire said from the tribune 
of the Constituent Assembly, without provoking the least 
astonishment:  &ldquo;We could if we would change religion, but we 
do not want to.&rdquo;  We know that they did want to later, and we

know how miserably their attempt failed. 
</p><p>Yet the Jacobins had in their hands all the elements of 
success.  Thanks to the completest of tyrannies, all obstacles 
were removed, and the laws which it pleased them to impose were 
always accepted.  After ten years of violence, of destruction and

burning and 
 
 
<pb n="162"/>  
pillage and massacre and general upheaval, their impotence was 
revealed so startlingly that they fell into universal 
reprobation.  The dictator then invoked by the whole of France 
was obliged to re-establish the greater part of that which had 
been destroyed. 
</p><p>The attempt of the Jacobins to re-fashion society in the 
name of pure reason constitutes an experiment of the highest 
interest.  Probably mankind will never have occasion to repeat it

on so vast a scale. 
</p><p>Although the lesson was a terrible one, it does not seem 
to have been sufficient for a considerable class of minds, since 
even in our days we hear Socialists propose to rebuild society 
from top to bottom according to their chimerical plans. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d73"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Illusions respecting the Theoretical Value of the 
great Revolutionary Principles</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The fundamental principles on which the Revolution was based 
in order to create a new dispensation are contained in the 
Declarations of Rights which were formulated successively in 
1789, 1793, and 1795.  All three Declarations agree in 
proclaiming that &ldquo;the principle of sovereignty resides in the

nation.&rdquo; 
</p><p>For the rest, the three Declarations differ on several 
points, notably in the matter of equality.  That of 1789 simply 
states (Article 1):  &ldquo;Men are born and remain free and having

equal rights.&rdquo;  That of 1793 goes farther, and assures us 
(Article 3):  &ldquo;All men are equal by nature.&rdquo;  That of 
1795 is more modest and says (Article 3):  &ldquo;Equality consists

in the law being the same for all.&rdquo;  Besides this, having 
mentioned rights, the third Declaration 
 
 
<pb n="163"/>  
considers it useful to speak of duties.  Its morality is simply 
that of the Gospel.  Article 2 says:  &ldquo;All the duties of a 
man and a citizen derive from these two principles engraved on 
all hearts by nature: do not do unto others that which you would 
not they should do unto you; do constantly unto others the good 
you would wish to receive from them.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The essential portions of these proclamations, the only 
portions which have really survived, were those relating to 
equality and popular sovereignty. 
</p><p>Despite the weakness of its rational meaning, the part 
played by the Republican device, <hi rend="italic">Liberty, Equality, 
Fraternity</hi>, was considerable. 
</p><p>This magic formula, which is still left engraven on many 
of our walls until it shall be engraven on our hearts, has really

possessed the supernatural power attributed to certain words by 
the old sorcerers. 
</p><p>Thanks to the new hopes excited by its promises, its power

of expansion was considerable.  Thousands of men lost their lives

for it.  Even in our days, when a revolution breaks out in any 
part of the world, the same formula is always invoked. 
</p><p>Its choice was happy in the extreme.  It belongs to the 
category of indefinite dream-evoking sentences, which every one 
is free to interpret according to his own desires, hatreds, and 
hopes.  In matters of faith the real sense of words matters very 
little; it is the meaning attached to them that makes their 
importance. 
</p><p>Of the three principles of the revolutionary device, 
equality was most fruitful of consequences.  We shall see in 
another part of this book that it is almost the 
 
 
<pb n="164"/>  
only one which still survives, and is still productive of 
effects. 
</p><p>It was certainly not the Revolution that introduced the 
idea of equality into the world.  Without going back even to the 
Greek republics, we may remark that the theory of equality was 
taught in the clearest fashion by Christianity and Islamism.  All

men, subjects of the one God, were equal before Him, and judged 
solely according to their merits.  The dogma of the equality of 
souls before God was an essential dogma with Mohammedans as well 
as with Christians. 
</p><p>But to proclaim a principle is not enough to secure its 
observation.  The Christian Church soon renounced its theoretical

equality, and the men of the Revolution only remembered it in 
their speeches. 
</p><p>The sense of the term &ldquo;equality&rdquo; varies according 
to the persons using it.  It often conceals sentiments very 
contrary to its real sense, and then represents the imperious 
need of having no one above one, joined to the no less lively 
desire to feel above others.  With the Jacobins of the 
Revolution, as with those of our days, the word 
&ldquo;equality&rdquo; simply involves a jealous hatred of all 
superiority.  To efface superiority, such men pretend to unify 
manners, customs, and situations.  All despotisms but that 
exercised by themselves seem odious. 
</p><p>Not being able to avoid the natural inequalities, they 
deny them.  The second Declaration of Rights, that of 1793, 
affirms, contrary to the evidence, that &ldquo;all men are equal by

nature.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It would seem that in many of the men of the 
 
 
<pb n="165"/>  
Revolution the ardent desire for equality merely concealed an 
intense need of inequalities.  Napoleon was obliged to re-establish titles of nobility and decorations for their benefit. 
Having shown that it was among the most rabid revolutionists that

he found the most docile instruments of domination, Taine 
continues:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Suddenly, through all their preaching of liberty and 
equality, appeared their authoritative instincts, their need of 
commanding, even as subordinates, and also, in most cases, an 
appetite for money or for pleasure.  Between the delegate of the 
Committee of Public Safety and the minister, prefect, or sub-prefect of the Empire the difference is small: it is the same man

under the two costumes, first <hi rend="italic">en carmagnole</hi>, then in the 
braided coat.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The dogma of equality had as its first consequence the 
proclamation of popular sovereignty by the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>. 
This sovereignty remained otherwise highly theoretical during the

whole Revolution. 
</p><p>The principle of authority was the lasting legacy of the 
Revolution.  The two terms &ldquo;liberty&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;fraternity&rdquo; which accompany it in the republican device 
had never much influence.  We may even say that they had none 
during the Revolution and the Empire, but merely served to 
decorate men's speeches. 
</p><p>Their influence was hardly more considerable later. 
Fraternity was never practised and the peoples have never cared 
much for liberty.  To-day our working-men have completely 
surrendered it to their unions. 
</p><p>To sum up: although the Republican motto has 
 
 
<pb n="166"/>  
been little applied it has exerted a very great influence.  Of 
the French Revolution practically nothing has remained in the 
popular mind but the three celebrated words which sum up its 
gospel, and which its armies spread over Europe.

Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>THE genesis of the French Revolution, as well as its duration,

was conditioned by elements of a rational, affective, mystic, and

collective nature, each category of which was ruled by a 
different logic.  It is, as I have said, because they have not 
been able to dissociate the respective influences of these 
factors that so many historians have interpreted this period so 
indifferently 
</p><p>The rational element usually invoked as an explanation 
exerted in reality but a very slight influence.  It prepared the 
way for the Revolution, but maintained it only at the outset, 
while it was still exclusively middle-class.  Its action was 
manifested by many measures of the time, such as the proposals to

reform the taxes, the suppression of the privileges of a useless 
nobility, &amp;c. 
</p><p>As soon as the Revolution reached the people, the 
 
 
<pb n="168"/>  
influence of the rational elements speedily vanished before that 
of the affective and collective elements.  As for the mystic 
elements, the foundation of the revolutionary faith, they made 
the army fanatical and propagated the new belief throughout the 
world. 
</p><p>We shall see these various elements as they appeared in 
events and in the psychology of individuals.  Perhaps the most 
important was the mystic element.  The Revolution cannot be 
clearly comprehended&mdash;we cannot repeat it too often&mdash;unless it is

considered as the formation of a religious belief.  What I have 
said elsewhere of all beliefs applies equally to the Revolution. 
Referring, for instance, to the chapter on the Reformation, the 
reader will see that it presents more than one analogy with the 
Revolution. 
</p><p>Having wasted so much time in demonstrating the slight 
rational value of beliefs, the philosophers are to-day beginning 
to understand their function better.  They have been forced to 
admit that these are the only factors which possess an influence 
sufficient to transform all the elements of a civilisation. 
</p><p>They impose themselves on men apart from reason and have 
the power to polarise men's thoughts and feelings in one 
direction.  Pure reason had never such a power, for men were 
never impassioned by reason. 
</p><p>The religious form rapidly assumed by the Revolution 
explains its power of expansion and the prestige which it 
possessed and has retained. 
</p><p>Few historians have understood that this great monument 
ought to be regarded as the foundation of a new religion.  The 
penetrating mind of Tocqueville, I believe, was the first to 
perceive as much. 
 
 
<pb n="169"/>  
 
</p><p>&ldquo;The French Revolution,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;was a 
political revolution which operated in the manner of and assumed 
something of the aspect of a religious revolution.  See by what 
regular and characteristic traits it finally resembled the 
latter: not only did it spread itself far and wide like a 
religious revolution, but, like the latter, it spread itself by 
means of preaching and propaganda.  A political revolution which 
inspires proselytes, which is preached as passionately to 
foreigners as it is accomplished at home: consider what a novel 
spectacle was this.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The religious side of the Revolution being granted, the 
accompanying fury and devastation are easily explained.  History 
shows us that such are always the accompaniments of the birth of 
religions.  The Revolution was therefore certain to provoke the 
violence and intolerance the triumphant deities demand from their

adepts.  It overturned all Europe for twenty years, ruined 
France, caused the death of millions of men, and cost the country

several invasions: but it is as a rule only at the cost of such 
catastrophes that a people can change its beliefs. 
</p><p>Although the mystic element is always the foundation of 
beliefs, certain affective and rational elements are quickly 
added thereto.  A belief thus serves to group sentiments and 
passions and interests which belong to the affective domain. 
Reason then envelops the whole, seeking to justify events in 
which, however, it played no part whatever. 
</p><p>At the moment of the Revolution every one, according to 
his aspirations, dressed the new belief in a different rational 
vesture.  The peoples saw in it only the suppression of the 
religious and political despotisms 
 
 
<pb n="170"/>  
and hierarchies under which they had so often suffered.  Writers 
like Goethe and thinkers like Kant imagined that they saw in it 
the triumph of reason.  Foreigners like Humboldt came to France 
&ldquo;to breathe the air of liberty and to assist at the obsequies

of despotism.&rdquo; 
</p><p>These intellectual illusions did not last long.  The 
evolution of the drama soon revealed the true foundations of the 
dream.

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Dissolution of the Ancien R&eacute;gime.  The 
assembling of the States General</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Before they are realised in action, revolutions are sketched 
out in men's thoughts.  Prepared by the causes already studied, 
the French Revolution commenced in reality with the reign of 
Louis XVI.  More discontented and censorious every day, the 
middle classes added claim to claim.  Everybody was calling for 
reform. 
</p><p>Louis XVI. thoroughly understood the utility of reform, 
but he was too weak to impose it on the clergy and the nobility. 
He could not even retain his reforming ministers, Malesherbes and

Turgot.  What with famines and increased taxation, the poverty of

all classes increased, and the huge pensions drawn by the Court 
formed a shocking contrast to the general distress. 
</p><p>The notables convoked to attempt to remedy the financial 
situation refused a system of equal taxation, and granted only 
insignificant reforms which the Parliament did not even consent 
to register.  It had to be dissolved.  The provincial Parliaments

made common cause with that of Paris, and were also dissolved. 
But they led 
 
 
<pb n="171"/>  
opinion, and in all parts of France promoted the demand for a 
meeting of the States General, which had not been convoked for 
nearly two hundred years. 
</p><p>The decision was taken:  5,000,000 Frenchmen, of whom 
100,000 were ecclesiastics and 150,000 nobles, sent their 
representatives.  There were in all 1,200 deputies, of whom 578 
were of the Third Estate, consisting chiefly of magistrates, 
advocates, and physicians.  Of the 300 deputies of the clergy, 
200, of plebeian origin, threw in their lot with the Third Estate

against the nobility and clergy. 
</p><p>From the first sessions a psychological conflict broke out

between the deputies of different social conditions and 
(therefore) different mentalities.  The magnificent costumes of 
the privileged deputies contrasted in a humiliating fashion with 
the sombre fashions of the Third Estate. 
</p><p>At the first session the members of the nobility and the 
clergy were covered, according to the prerogatives of their 
class, before the king.  Those of the Third Estate wished to 
imitate them, but the privileged members protested.  On the 
following day more protests of wounded self-love were heard.  The

deputies of the Third Estate invited those of the nobility and 
the clergy who were sitting in separate halls to join them for 
the verification of their powers.  The nobles refused.  The 
negotiations lasted more than a month.  Finally, the deputies of 
the Third Estate, on the proposition of the Abb&eacute; 
Si&eacute;y&egrave;s, considering that they represented 95 per 
cent. of the nation, declared themselves constituted as a 
National Assembly.  From that moment the Revolution pursued its 
course.

<pb n="172"/>  
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d78"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Constituent Assembly</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The power of a political assembly resides, above all, in the 
weakness of its adversaries.  Astonished by the slight resistance

encountered, and carried away by the ascendancy of a handful of 
orators, the Constituent Assembly, from its earliest sessions, 
spoke and acted as a sovereign body.  Notably it arrogated to 
itself the power of decreeing imposts, a serious encroachment 
upon the prerogatives of the royal power. 
</p><p>The resistance of Louis XVI. was feeble enough.  He simply

had the hall in which the States assembled closed.  The deputies 
then met in the hall of the tennis-court, and took the oath that 
they would not separate until the Constitution of the kingdom was

an established fact. 
</p><p>The majority of the deputies of the clergy went with them.

The king revoked the decision of the Assembly, and ordered the 
deputies to retire.  The Marquis de Dreux-Br&eacute;z&eacute;, 
the Grand Master of Ceremonies, having invited them to obey the 
order of the sovereign, the President of the Assembly declared 
&ldquo;that the nation assembled cannot receive orders,&rdquo; and 
Mirabeau replied to the envoy of the sovereign that, being united

by the will of the people, the Assembly would only withdraw at 
the point of the bayonet.  Again the king gave way. 
</p><p>On the 9th of June the meeting of deputies took the title 
of the Constituent Assembly.  For the first time in centuries the

king was forced to recognise the existence of a new power, 
formerly ignored&mdash;that of the people, represented by its elected 
representatives.  The absolute monarchy was no more. 
 
 
<pb n="173"/>  
 
</p><p>Feeling himself more and more seriously threatened, Louis 
XVI. summoned to Versailles a number of regiments composed of 
foreign mercenaries.  The Assembly demanded the withdrawal of the

troops.  The king refused, and dismissed Necker, replacing him by

the Marshal de Broglie, reputed to be an extremely authoritative 
person. 
</p><p>But the Assembly had able supporters.  Camille Desmoulins 
and others harangued the crowd in all directions, calling it to 
the defence of liberty.  They sounded the tocsin, organised a 
militia of 12,000 men, took muskets and cannon from the 
Invalides, and on the 14th of July the armed bands marched upon 
the Bastille.  The fortress, barely defended, capitulated in a 
few hours.  Seven prisoners were found within it, of whom one was

an idiot and four were accused of forgery. 
</p><p>The Bastille, the prison of many victims of arbitrary 
power, symbolised the royal power to many minds; but the people 
who demolished it had not suffered by it.  Scarcely any but 
members of the nobility were imprisoned there. 
</p><p>The influence exercised by the taking of this fortress has

continued to our days.  Serious historians like M. Rambaud assure

us that &ldquo;the taking of the Bastille is a culminating fact in 
the history, not of France only but of all Europe, and 
inaugurates a new epoch in the history of the world.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Such credulity is a little excessive.  The importance of 
the event lay simply in the psychological fact that for the first

time the people received an obvious proof of the weakness of an 
authority which had lately been formidable. 
 
 
<pb n="174"/>  
 
</p><p>When the principle of authority is injured in the public 
mind it dissolves very rapidly.  What might not one demand of a 
king who could not defend his principal fortress against popular 
attacks?  The master regarded as all-powerful had ceased to be 
so. 
</p><p>The taking of the Bastille was the beginning of one of 
those phenomena of mental contagion which abound in the history 
of the Revolution.  The foreign mercenary troops, although they 
could scarcely be interested in the movement, began to show 
symptoms of mutiny.  Louis XVI. was reduced to accepting their 
disbandment.  He recalled Necker, went to the H&ocirc;tel de 
Ville, sanctioned by his presence the accomplished facts, and 
accepted from La Fayette, commandant of the National Guard, the 
new cockade of red, white, and blue which allied the colours of 
Paris to those of the king. 
</p><p>Although the riot which ended in the taking of the 
Bastille can by no means be regarded as &ldquo;a culminating fact 
in history,&rdquo; it does mark the precise moment of the 
commencement of popular government.  The armed people thenceforth

intervened daily in the deliberations of the revolutionary 
Assemblies, and seriously influenced their conduct. 
</p><p>This intervention of the people in conformity with the 
dogma of its sovereignty has provoked the respectful admiration 
of many historians of the Revolution.  Even a superficial study 
of the psychology of crowds would speedily have shown them that 
the mystic entity which they call the people was merely 
translating the will of a few leaders.  It is not correct to say 
that the people took the Bastille, attacked the Tuileries, 
invaded the Convention, &amp;c., but that 
 
 
<pb n="175"/>  
certain leaders&mdash;generally by means of the clubs&mdash;united armed 
bands of the populace, which they led against the Bastille, the 
Tuileries, &amp;c.  During the Revolution the same crowds attacked or

defended the most contrary parties, according to the leaders who 
happened to be at their heads.  A crowd never has any opinion but

that of its leaders. 
</p><p>Example constituting one of the most potent forms of 
suggestion, the taking of the Bastille was inevitably followed by

the destruction of other fortresses.  Many <hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi> 
were regarded as so many little Bastilles, and in order to 
imitate the Parisians who had destroyed theirs the peasants began

to burn them.  They did so with the greater fury because the 
seigneurial homes contained the titles of feudal dues.  It was a 
species of Jacquerie. 
</p><p>The Constituent Assembly, so proud and haughty towards the

king, was, like all the revolutionary assemblies which followed 
it, extremely pusillanimous before the people. 
</p><p>Hoping to put an end to the disorders of the night of 
August 4th, it voted, on the proposition of a member of the 
nobility, the Comte de Noailles, the abolition of seigneurial 
rights.  Although this measure suppressed at one stroke the 
privileges of the nobles, it was voted with tears and embracings.

Such accesses of sentimental enthusiasm are readily explained 
when we recall how contagious emotion is in a crowd, above all in

an assembly oppressed by fear. 
</p><p>If the renunciation of their rights had been effected by 
the nobility a few years earlier, the Revolution would doubtless 
have been avoided, but it was now too late.  To give way only 
when one is forced to do 
 
 
<pb n="176"/>  
so merely increases the demands of those to whom one yields.  In 
politics one should always look ahead and give way long before 
one is forced to do so. 
</p><p>Louis XVI. hesitated for two months to ratify the 
decisions voted by the Assembly on the night of the 4th of 
August.  He had retired to Versailles.  The leaders sent thither 
a band of 7,000 or 8,000 men and women of the people, assuring 
them that the royal residence contained great stores of bread. 
The railings of the palace were forced, some of the bodyguard 
were killed, and the king and all his family were led back to 
Paris in the midst of a shrieking crowd, many of whom bore on the

ends of their pikes the heads of the soldiers massacred.  The 
dreadful journey lasted six hours.  These events constituted what

are known as the &ldquo;days&rdquo; of October. 
</p><p>The popular power increased, and in reality the king, like

the whole assembly, was henceforth in the hands of the people&mdash; 
that is, at the mercy of the clubs and their leaders.  This 
popular power was to prevail for nearly ten years, and the 
Revolution was to be almost entirely its work. 
</p><p>While proclaiming that the people constituted the only 
sovereign, the Assembly was greatly embarrassed by riots which 
went far beyond its theoretical expectations.  It had supposed 
that order would be restored while it fabricated a Constitution 
destined to assure the eternal happiness of mankind. 
</p><p>We know that during the whole duration of the Revolution 
one of the chief occupations of the assemblies was to make, 
unmake, and remake Constitutions.  The theorists attributed to 
them then, as they do to-day, the power of transforming society; 
the 
 
 
<pb n="177"/>  
Assembly, therefore, could not neglect its task.  In the meantime

it published a solemn Declaration of the Rights of Man which 
summarised its principles. 
</p><p>The Constitution, proclamations, declarations, and 
speeches had not the slightest effect on the popular movements, 
nor on the dissentients who daily increased in number in the 
heart of the Assembly.  The latter became more and more subjected

to the ascendancy of the advanced party, which was supported by 
the clubs.  Danton, Camille Desmoulins, and later Marat and 
H&eacute;bert, violently excited the populace by their harangues 
and their journals.  The Assembly was rapidly going down the 
slope that leads to extremes. 
</p><p>During all these disorders the finances of the country 
were not improving.  Finally convinced that philanthropic 
speeches would not alter their lamentable condition, and seeing 
that bankruptcy threatened, the Assembly decreed, on the 2nd of 
November, 1789, the confiscation of the goods of the Church. 
Their revenues, consisting of the tithes collected from the 
faithful, amounted to some &pound;8,000,000, and their value was 
estimated at about &pound;120,000,000.  They were divided among 
some hundreds of prelates, Court abb&eacute;s, &amp;c., who owned a 
quarter of all France.  These goods, henceforth entitled is 
&ldquo;national domains,&rdquo; formed the guarantee of the 
<hi rend="italic">assignats</hi>, the first issue of which was for 400,000,000 
francs (&pound;16,000,000 sterling).  The public accepted them at

the outset, but they multiplied so under the Directory and the 
Convention, which issued 45,000,000,000 francs in this form 
(&pound;1,800,000,000 sterling), that an assignat of 100 livres 
was finally worth only a few halfpence. 
</p><p>Stimulated by his advisers, the feeble Louis 
 
 
<pb n="178"/>  
attempted in vain to struggle against the decrees of the Assembly

by refusing to sanction them. 
</p><p>Under the influence of the daily suggestions of the 
leaders and the power of mental contagion the revolutionary 
movement was spreading everywhere independently of the Assembly 
and often even against it. 
</p><p>In the towns and villages revolutionary municipalities 
were instituted, protected by the local National Guards.  Those 
of neighbouring towns commenced to make mutual arrangements to 
defend themselves should need arise.  Thus federations were 
formed, which were soon rolled into one; this sent 14,000 
National Guards to Paris, who assembled on the Champ-de-Mars on 
the 14th of July, 1790.  There the king swore to maintain the 
Constitution decreed by the National Assembly. 
</p><p>Despite this vain oath it became more evident every day 
that no agreement was possible between the hereditary principles 
of the monarchy and those proclaimed by the Assembly. 
</p><p>Feeling himself completely powerless, the king thought 
only of flight.  Arrested at Varennes and brought back a prisoner

to Paris, he was shut up in the Tuileries.  The Assembly, 
although still extremely royalist, suspended him from power, and 
decided to assume the sole charge of the government. 
</p><p>Never did sovereign find himself in a position so 
difficult as that of Louis at the time of his flight.  The genius

of a Richelieu would hardly have extricated him.  The only 
element of defence on which he could have relied had from the 
beginning absolutely failed him. 
</p><p>During the whole duration of the Constituent 
 
 
<pb n="179"/>  
Assembly the immense majority of Frenchmen and of the Assembly 
remained royalist, so that had the sovereign accepted a liberal 
monarchy he could perhaps have remained in power.  It would seem 
that Louis had little to promise in order to come to an agreement

with the Assembly. 
</p><p>Little, perhaps, but with his structure of mind that 
little was strictly impossible.  All the shades of his forbears 
would have risen up in front of him had he consented to modify 
the mechanism of the monarchy inherited from so many ancestors. 
And even had he attempted to do so, the opposition of his family,

the clergy, the nobles, and the Court could never have been 
surmounted.  The ancient castes on which the monarchy rested, the

nobility and the clergy, were then almost as powerful as the 
monarch himself.  Every time it seemed as though he might yield 
to the injunctions of the Assembly it was because he was 
constrained to do so by force, and to attempt to gain time.  His 
appeals to alien Powers represented the resolution of a desperate

man who had seen all his natural defences fail him. 
</p><p>He, and especially the queen, entertained the strangest 
illusions as to the possible assistance of Austria, for centuries

the rival of France.  If Austria indolently consented to come to 
his aid, it was only in the hope of receiving a great reward. 
Mercy gave him to understand that the payment expected consisted 
of Alsace, the Alps, and Navarre. 
</p><p>The leaders of the clubs, finding the Assembly too 
royalist, sent the people against it.  A petition was signed, 
inviting the Assembly to convoke a new constituent power to 
proceed to the trial of Louis XVI. 
 
 
<pb n="180"/>  
 
</p><p>Monarchical in spite of all, and finding that the 
Revolution was assuming a character far too demagogic, the 
Assembly resolved to defend itself against the actions of the 
people.  A battalion of the National Guard, commanded by La 
Fayette, was sent to the Champ-de-Mars, where the crowd was 
assembled, to disperse it.  Fifty of those present were killed. 
</p><p>The Assembly did not long persist in its feeble 
resistance.  Extremely fearful of the people, it increased its 
arrogance towards the king, depriving him every day of some part 
of his prerogatives and authority.  He was now scarcely more than

a mere official obliged to execute the wishes of others. 
</p><p>The Assembly had imagined that it would be able to 
exercise the authority of which it had deprived the king, but 
such a task was infinitely above its resources.  A power so 
divided is always weak.  &ldquo;I know nothing more terrible,&rdquo; 
said Mirabeau, &ldquo;than the sovereign authority of six hundred 
persons.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Having flattered itself that it could combine in itself 
all the powers of the State, and exercise them as Louis XVI. had 
done, the Assembly very soon exercised none whatever. 
</p><p>As its authority failed anarchy increased.  The popular 
leaders continually stirred up the people.  Riot and insurrection

became the sole power.  Every day the Assembly was invaded by 
rowdy and imperious delegations which operated by means of 
threats and demands. 
</p><p>All these popular movements, which the Assembly, under the

stress of fear, invariably obeyed, had nothing spontaneous about 
them.  They simply represented the manifestations of new powers&mdash;

the clubs and the 
 
 
<pb n="181"/>  
Commune&mdash;which had been set up beside the Assembly. 
</p><p>The most powerful of these clubs was the Jacobin, which 
had quickly created more than five hundred branches in the 
country, all of which were under the orders of the central body. 
Its influence remained preponderant during the whole duration of 
the Revolution.  It was the master of the Assembly, and then of 
France, its only rival the insurrectionary Commune, whose power 
was exercised only in Paris. 
</p><p>The weakness of the national Assembly and all its failures

had made it extremely unpopular.  It became conscious of this, 
and, feeling that it was every day more powerless, decided to 
hasten the creation of the new Constitution in order that it 
might dissolve.  Its last action, which was tactless enough, was 
to decree that no member of the Constituent Assembly should be 
elected to the Legislative Assembly.  The members of the latter 
were thus deprived of the experience acquired by their 
predecessors. 
</p><p>The Constitution was completed on the 3rd of September, 
1791, and accepted on the 13th by the king, to whom the Assembly 
had restored his powers. 
</p><p>This Constitution organised a representative Government, 
delegating the legislative power to deputies elected by the 
people, and the executive power to the king, whose right of veto 
over the decrees of the Assembly was recognised.  New 
departmental divisions were substituted for the old provinces. 
The imposts were abolished, and replaced by direct and indirect 
taxes, which are still in force. 
</p><p>The Assembly, which had just altered the territorial 
divisions and overthrown all the old social organisation, 
 
 
<pb n="182"/>  
thought itself powerful enough to transform the religious 
organisation of the country also.  It claimed notably that the 
members of the clergy should be elected by the people, and should

be thus withdrawn from the influence of their supreme head, the 
Pope. 
</p><p>This civil constitution of the clergy was the origin of 
religious struggles and persecutions which lasted until the days 
of the Consulate.  Two-thirds of the priests refused the oath 
demanded of them. 
</p><p>During the three years which represented the life of the 
Constituent Assembly the Revolution had produced considerable 
results.  The principal result was perhaps the beginning of the 
transference to the Third Estate of the riches of the privileged 
classes.  In this way while interests were created to be defended

fervent adherents were raised up to the new <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>.

A Revolution supported by the gratification of acquired appetites

is bound to be powerful.  The Third Estate, which had supplanted 
the nobles, and the peasants, who had bought the national 
domains, would readily understand that the restoration of the 
<hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> would despoil them of all their 
advantages.  The energetic defence of the Revolution was merely 
the defence of their own fortunes. 
</p><p>This is why we see, during part of the Revolution, nearly 
half the departments vainly rising against the despotism that 
crushed them.  The Republicans triumphed over all opposition. 
They were extremely powerful in that they had to defend, not only

a new ideal, but new material interests.  We shall see that the 
influence of these two factors lasted during the whole of the 
Revolution, and contributed powerfully to the establishment of 
the Empire.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d80"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Political Events during the Life of the Legislative 
Assembly</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>BEFORE examining the mental characteristics of the Legislative

Assembly let us briefly sum up the considerable political events 
which marked its short year's life.  They naturally played an 
important part in respect of its psychological manifestations. 
</p><p>Extremely monarchical, the Legislative Assembly had no 
more idea than its predecessor of destroying the monarchy.  The 
king appeared to it to be slightly suspect, but it still hoped to

be able to retain him on the throne. 
</p><p>Unhappily for him, Louis was incessantly begging for 
intervention from abroad.  Shut up in the Tuileries, defended 
only by his Swiss Guards, the timid sovereign was drifting among 
contrary influences.  He subsidised journals intended to modify 
public opinion, but the obscure &ldquo;penny-a-liners&rdquo; who 
edited them knew nothing of acting on the mind of the crowd. 
Their only means of persuasion was to menace with the gallows all

the partisans of the Revolution, and to predict the invasion of 
France by an army which would rescue the king. 
</p><p>Royalty no longer counted on anything but the 
 
 
<pb n="184"/>  
foreign Courts.  The nobles were emigrating.  Prussia, Austria, 
and Russia were threatening France with a war of invasion.  The 
Court favoured their lead.  To the coalition of the three kings 
against France the Jacobin Club proposed to oppose a league of 
peoples.  The Girondists were then, with the Jacobins, at the 
head of the revolutionary movement.  They incited the masses to 
arm themselves&mdash;600,000 volunteers were equipped.  The Court 
accepted a Girondist minister.  Dominated by him, Louis XVI. was 
obliged to propose to the Assembly a war against Austria.  It was

immediately agreed to. 
</p><p>In declaring war the king was not sincere.  The queen 
revealed the French plans of campaign and the secret 
deliberations of the Council to the Austrians. 
</p><p>The beginnings of the struggle were disastrous.  Several 
columns of troops, attacked by panic, disbanded.  Stimulated by 
the clubs, and persuaded&mdash;justly, for that matter&mdash;that the king 
was conspiring with the enemies of France, the population of the 
<hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi> rose in insurrection.  Its leaders, the 
Jacobins, and above all Danton, sent to the Tuileries on the 20th

of June a petition threatening the king with revocation.  It then

invaded the Tuileries, heaping invectives on the sovereign. 
</p><p>Fatality impelled Louis toward his tragic destiny.  While 
the threats of the Jacobins against royalty had roused many of 
the departments to indignation, it was learned that a Prussian 
army had arrived on the frontiers of Lorraine. 
</p><p>The hope of the king and queen respecting the help to be 
obtained from abroad was highly chimerical. 
 
 
<pb n="185"/>  
Marie-Antoinette suffered from an absolute illusion as to the 
psychology of the Austrian and the French peoples.  Seeing France

terrorised by a few energumens, she supposed that it would be 
equally easy to terrify the Parisians, and by means of threats to

lead them back under the king's authority.  Inspired by her, 
Fersen undertook to publish the manifesto of the Duke of 
Brunswick, threatening Paris with &ldquo;total subversion if the 
royal family were molested.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The effect produced was diametrically opposite to that 
intended.  The manifesto aroused indignation against the monarch,

who was regarded as an accomplice, and increased his 
unpopularity.  From that day he was marked for the scaffold. 
</p><p>Carried away by Danton, the delegates of the sections 
installed themselves at the H&ocirc;tel de Ville as an 
insurrectionary Commune, which arrested the commandant of the 
National Guard, who was devoted to the king, sounded the tocsin, 
equipped the National Guard, and on the 10th of August hurled 
them, with the populace, against the Tuileries.  The regiments 
called in by Louis disbanded themselves.  Soon none were left to 
defend him but his Swiss and a few gentlemen.  Nearly all were 
killed.  Left alone, the king took refuge with the Assembly.  The

crowds demanded his denouncement.  The Legislative Assembly 
decreed his suspension and left a future Assembly, the 
Convention, to decide upon his fate. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d81"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Mental Characteristics of the Legislative 
Assembly</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The Legislative Assembly, formed of new men, presented quite a

special interest from the psychological 
 
 
<pb n="186"/>  
point of view.  Few assemblies have offered in such a degree the 
characteristics of the political collectivity. 
</p><p>It comprised seven hundred and fifty deputies, divided 
into pure royalists, constitutional royalists, republicans, 
Girondists, and Montagnards.  Advocates and men of letters formed

the majority.  It also contained, but in smaller numbers, 
superior officers, priests, and a very few scientists. 
</p><p>The philosophical conceptions of the members of this 
Assembly seem rudimentary enough.  Many were imbued with 
Rousseau's idea of a return to a state of nature.  But all, like 
their predecessors, were dominated more especially by 
recollections of Greek and Latin antiquity.  Cato, Brutus, 
Gracchus, Plutarch, Marcus Aurelius, and Plato, continually 
evoked, furnished the images of their speech.  When the orator 
wished to insult Louis XVI. he called him Caligula. 
</p><p>In hoping to destroy tradition they were revolutionaries, 
but in claiming to return to a remote past they showed themselves

extremely reactionary. 
</p><p>For the rest, all these theories had very little influence

on their conduct.  Reason was continually figuring in their 
speeches, but never in their actions.  These were always 
dominated by those affective and mystic elements whose potency we

have so often demonstrated. 
</p><p>The psychological characteristics of the Legislative 
Assembly were those of the Constituent Assembly, but were greatly

accentuated.  They may be summed up in four words: 
impressionability, mobility, timidity, and weakness. 
 
 
<pb n="187"/>  
 
</p><p>This mobility and impressionability are revealed in the 
constant variability of their conduct.  One day they exchange 
noisy invective and blows.  On the following day we see them 
&ldquo;throwing themselves into one another's arms with torrents of

tears.&rdquo;  They eagerly applaud an address demanding the 
punishment of those who have petitioned for the king's 
dethronement, and the same day accord the honours of the 
session to a delegation which has come to demand his downfall. 
</p><p>The pusillanimity and weakness of the Assembly in the face

of threats was extreme.  Although royalist it voted the 
suspension of the king, and on the demand of the Commune 
delivered him, with his family, to be imprisoned in the Temple, 
</p><p>Thanks to its weakness, it was as incapable as the 
Constituent Assembly of exercising any power, and allowed itself 
to be dominated by the Commune and the clubs, which were directed

by such influential leaders as H&eacute;bert, Tallien, Rossignol,

Marat, Robespierre, &amp;c. 
</p><p>Until Thermidor, 1794, the insurrectionary Commune 
constituted the chief power in the State, and behaved precisely 
as if it had been charged with the government of Paris. 
</p><p>It was the Commune that demanded the imprisonment of Louis

XVI.  in the tower of the Temple, when the Assembly wished to 
imprison him in the palace of the Luxembourg.  It was the Commune

again that filled the prisons with suspects, and then ordered 
them to be killed. 
</p><p>We know with what refinements of cruelty a handful of some

150 bandits, paid at the rate of 24 livres a day, 
 
 
<pb n="188"/>  
 
and directed by a few members of the Commune, exterminated some 
1,200 persons in four days.  This crime was known as the massacre

of September.  The mayor of Paris, P&eacute;tion, received the 
band of assassins with respect, and gave them drink.  A few 
Girondists protested somewhat, but the Jacobins were silent. 
</p><p>The terrorised Assembly affected at first to ignore the 
massacres, which were encouraged by several of its more 
influential deputies, notably Couthon and Billaud-Varenne.  When 
at last it decided to condemn them it was without attempting to 
prevent their continuation. 
</p><p>Conscious of its impotence, the Legislative Assembly 
dissolved itself a fortnight later in order to give way to the 
Convention. 
</p><p>Its work was obviously disastrous, not in intention but in

fact.  Royalist, it abandoned the monarchy; humanitarian, it 
allowed the massacres of September; pacific, it pushed France 
into a formidable war, thus showing that a weak Government always

ends by bringing ruin upon its country. 
</p><p>The history of the two previous revolutionary Assemblies 
proves once more to what point events carry within them their 
inevitable consequences.  They constitute a train of necessities 
of which we can sometimes choose the first, but which then evolve

without consulting us.  We are free to make a decision, but 
powerless to avert its consequences. 
</p><p>The first measures of the Constituent Assembly were 
rational and voluntary, but the results which followed were 
beyond all will or reason or foresight. 
</p><p>Which of the men of 1789 would have ventured to desire or 
predict the death of Louis XVI., the wars 
 
 
<pb n="189"/>  
of La Vend&eacute;e, the Terror, the permanent guillotine and the

final anarchy, or the ensuing return to 
tradition and order, guided by the iron hand of a soldier? 
</p><p>In the development of events which ensued from the early 
actions of the revolutionary Assemblies the most striking, 
perhaps, was the rise and development of the government of the 
crowd&mdash;of mob rule. 
</p><p>Behind the facts which we have been considering&mdash;the 
taking of the Bastille, the invasion of Versailles, the massacres

of September, the attack on the Tuileries, the murder of the 
Swiss Guards, and the downfall and imprisonment of the king&mdash;we 
can readily perceive the laws affecting the psychology of crowds 
and their leaders. 
</p><p>We shall now see that the power of the multitude will 
progressively increase, overcome all other powers, and finally 
replace them.

THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THE CONVENTION 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d83"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Legend of the Convention</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>THE history of the Convention is not merely fertile in 
psychological documents.  It also shows how powerless the 
witnesses of any period and even their immediate successors are 
to form an exact idea of the events which they have witnessed, 
and the men who have surrounded them. 
</p><p>More than a century has elapsed since the Revolution, and 
men are only just beginning to form judgments concerning this 
period which, if still often doubtful enough, are slightly more 
accurate than of old. 
</p><p>This happens, not only because new documents are being 
drawn from the archives, but because the legends which enveloped 
that sanguinary period in a magical cloud are gradually vanishing

with the passage of time. 
</p><p>Perhaps the most tenacious legend of all was that which 
until formerly used to surround the personages to whom our 
fathers applied the glorious epithet, &ldquo;the Giants of the 
Convention.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The struggles of the Convention against France in 
insurrection and Europe in arms produced such an impression that 
the heroes of this formidable struggle seemed to belong to a race

of supermen or Titans. 
 
 
<pb n="191"/>  
 
</p><p>The epithet &ldquo;giant&rdquo; seemed justified so long as 
the events of the period were confused and massed together. 
Regarded as connected when it was simply simultaneous, the work 
of the armies was confounded with that of the Convention.  The 
glory of the first recoiled upon the second, and served as an 
excuse for the hecatombs of the Terror, the ferocity of the civil

war, and the devastation of France. 
</p><p>Under the penetrating scrutiny of modern criticism, the 
heterogeneous mass of events has been slowly disentangled.  The 
armies of the Republic have retained their old prestige, but we 
have been forced to recognise that the men of the Convention, 
absorbed entirely by their intestine conflicts, had very little 
to do with their victories.  At the most two or three members of 
the committees of the Assembly were concerned with the armies, 
and the fact that they were victorious was due, apart from their 
numbers and the talents of their young generals, to the 
enthusiasm with which a new faith had inspired them. 
</p><p>In a later chapter, devoted to the revolutionary armies, 
we shall see how they conquered Europe in arms.  They set out 
inspired by the ideas of liberty and equality which constituted 
the new gospel, and once on the frontiers, which were to keep 
them so long, they retained a special mentality, very different 
from that of the Government, which they first knew nothing of and

afterwards despised. 
</p><p>Having no part whatever in their victories, the men of the

Convention contented themselves with legislating at hazard 
according to the injunctions of the leaders who directed them, 
and who claimed to be regenerating France by means of the 
guillotine. 
 
 
<pb n="192"/>  
 
</p><p>But it was thanks to these valiant armies that the history

of the Convention was transformed into an apotheosis which 
affected several generations with a religious respect which even 
to-day is hardly extinct. 
</p><p>Studying in detail the psychology of the &ldquo;Giants&rdquo; 
of the Convention, we find their magnitude shrink very rapidly. 
They were in general extremely mediocre.  Their most fervent 
defenders, such as M. Aulard, are obliged to admit as much. 
</p><p>This is how M. Aulard puts it in his <hi rend="italic">History of the 
French Revolution</hi>:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;It has been said that the generation which from 1789 
to 1799 did such great and terrible things was a generation of 
giants, or, to put it more plainly, that it was a generation more

distinguished than that which preceded it or that which followed.

This is a retrospective illusion.  The citizens who formed the 
municipal and Jacobin or nationalist groups by which the 
Revolution was effected do not seem to have been superior, either

in enlightenment or in talents, to the Frenchmen of the time of 
Louis XV. or of Louis Philippe.  Were those exceptionally gifted 
whose names history has retained because they appeared on the 
stage of Paris, or because they were the most brilliant orators 
of the various revolutionary Assemblies?  Mirabeau, up to a 
certain point, deserved the title of genius; but as to the rest&mdash;

Robespierre, Danton, Vergniaud&mdash;had they truly more talent, for 
example, than our modern orators?  In 1793, in the time of the 
supposed `giants,' Mme. Roland wrote in her memoirs:  `France was

as though drained of men; their dearth during this 
 
 
<pb n="193"/>  
revolution is truly surprising; there have scarcely been any but 
pigmies.' &rdquo; 
</p><p>If after considering the men of the Convention 
individually we consider them in a body, we may say that they did

not shine either by intelligence or by virtue or by courage. 
Never did a body of men manifest such pusillanimity.  They had no

courage save in their speeches or in respect of remote dangers. 
This Assembly, so proud and threatening in its speech when 
addressing royalty, was perhaps the most timid and docile 
political collectivity that the world has ever known.  We see it 
slavishly obedient to the orders of the clubs and the Commune, 
trembling before the popular delegations which invaded it daily, 
and obeying the injunctions of the rioters to the point of 
handing over to them its most brilliant members.  The Convention 
affords the world a melancholy spectacle, voting, at the popular 
behest, laws so absurd that it is obliged to annul them as soon 
as the rioters have quitted the hall. 
</p><p>Few Assemblies have given proof of such weakness.  When we

wish to show how low a popular Government can fall we have only 
to point to the Convention. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d84"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Results of the Triumph of the Jacobin 
Religion</hi></head> 
 
<p>Among the causes that gave the Convention its special 
physiognomy, one of the most important was the definite 
establishment of a revolutionary religion.  A dogma which was at 
first in process of formation was at last finally erected. 
</p><p>This dogma was composed of an aggregate of somewhat 
inconsistent elements.  Nature, the rights 
 
 
<pb n="194"/>  
of man, liberty, equality, the social contract, hatred of 
tyrants, and popular sovereignty formed the articles of a gospel 
which, to its disciples, was above discussion.  The new truths 
had found apostles who were certain of their power, and who 
finally, like believers all the world over, sought to impose them

by force.  No heed should be taken of the opinion of unbelievers;

they all deserved to be exterminated. 
</p><p>The hatred of heretics having been always, as we have 
seen, in respect of the Reformation, an irreducible 
characteristic of great beliefs, we can readily comprehend the 
intolerance of the Jacobin religion. 
</p><p>The history of the Reformation proves also that the 
conflict between two allied beliefs is very bitter.  We must not,

therefore, be astonished that in the Convention the Jacobins 
fought furiously against the other republicans, whose faith 
hardly differed from their own. 
</p><p>The propaganda of the new apostles was very energetic.  To

convert the provinces they sent thither zealous disciples 
escorted by guillotines.  The inquisitors of the new faith would 
have no paltering with error.  As Robespierre said, &ldquo;The 
republic is the destruction of everything that is opposed to 
it.&rdquo;  What matter that the country refused to be regenerated?

It should be regenerated despite itself.  &ldquo;We will make a 
cemetery of France,&rdquo; said Carrier, &ldquo;rather than fail to 
regenerate it in our own way.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The Jacobin policy derived from the new faith was very 
simple.  It consisted in a sort of equalitarian Socialism, 
directed by a dictatorship which would brook no opposition. 
</p><p>Of practical ideas consistent with the economic 
 
 
<pb n="195"/>  
necessities and the true nature of man, the theorists who ruled 
France would have nothing to say.  Speech and the guillotine 
sufficed them.  Their speeches were childish.  &ldquo;Never a 
fact,&rdquo; says Taine, &ldquo;nothing but abstractions, strings of 
sentences about Nature, reason, the people, tyrants, liberty: 
like so many puffed-out balloons uselessly jostling in space.  If

we did not know that it all ended in practical and dreadful 
results, we should think they were games of logic, school 
exercises, academical demonstrations, ideological 
combinations.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The theories of the Jacobins amounted practically to an 
absolute tyranny.  To them it seemed evident that a sovereign 
State must be obeyed without discussion by citizens rendered 
equal as to conditions and fortune. 
</p><p>The power with which they invested themselves was far 
greater than that of the monarchs who had preceded them.  They 
fixed the prices of merchandise and arrogated the right to 
dispose of the life and property of citizens. 
</p><p>Their confidence in the regenerative virtues of the 
revolutionary faith was such that after having declared war upon 
kings they declared war upon the gods.  A calendar was 
established from which the saints were banished.  They created a 
new divinity, Reason, whose worship was celebrated in Notre-Dame,

with ceremonies which were in many ways identical with those of 
the Catholic faith, upon the altar of the &ldquo;late Holy 
Virgin.&rdquo;  This cult lasted until Robespierre substituted a 
personal religion of which he constituted himself the high 
priest. 
</p><p>The sole masters of France, the Jacobins and their 
 
 
<pb n="196"/>  
disciples were able to plunder the country with impunity, 
although they were never in the majority anywhere. 
</p><p>Their numbers are not easy to determine exactly.  We know 
only that they were very small.  Taine valued them at 5,000 in 
Paris, among 700,000 inhabitants; in Besan&ccedil;on 300 among 
300,000; and in all France about 300,000. 
</p><p>&ldquo;A small feudality of brigands, set over a conquered 
France,&rdquo; according to the words of the same author, they were

able, in spite of their small numbers, to dominate the country, 
and this for several reasons.  In the first place, their faith 
gave them a considerable strength.  Then, because they 
represented the Government, and for centuries the French 
had obeyed those who were in command.  Finally, because 
it was believed that to overthrow them would be to bring 
back the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>, which was greatly 
dreaded by the numerous purchasers of the national domains. 
Their tyranny must have grown frightful indeed to force 
so many departments to rise against them. 
</p><p>The first factor of their power was very important.  In 
the conflict between powerful faiths and weak faiths victory 
never falls to the latter.  A powerful faith creates strong 
wills, which will always overpower weak wills.  That the Jacobins

themselves did finally perish was because their accumulated 
violence had bound together thousands of weak wills whose united 
weight overbalanced their own strong wills. 
</p><p>It is true that the Girondists, whom the Jacobins 
persecuted with so much hatred, had also well-established 
beliefs, but in the struggle which ensued their 
 
 
<pb n="197"/>  
education told against them, together with their respect for 
certain traditions and the rights of others, scruples which did 
not in the least trouble their adversaries. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The majority of the sentiments of the 
Girondists,&rdquo; writes Emile Ollivier, &ldquo;were delicate and 
generous; those of the Jacobin mob were low, gross, and brutal. 
The name of Vergniaud, compared with that of the `divine' Marat, 
measures a gulf which nothing could span.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Dominating the Convention at the outset by the superiority

of their talents and their eloquence, the Girondists soon fell 
under the domination of the Montagnards&mdash;worthless energumens, 
who carried little weight, but were always active, and who knew 
how to excite the passions of the populace.  It was violence and 
not talent that impressed the Assemblies. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d85"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Mental Characteristics of the Convention</hi>.</head>

 
<p>Beside the characteristics common to all assemblies there are 
some created by influences of environment and circumstances, 
which give any particular assembly of men a special physiognomy. 
Most of the characteristics observable in the Constituent and 
Legislative Assemblies reappeared, in an exaggerated form, in the

Convention. 
</p><p>This Assembly comprised about seven hundred and fifty 
deputies, of whom rather more than a third had sat in the 
Constituent or the Legislative Assembly.  By terrorising the 
population the Jacobins contrived to triumph at the elections. 
The majority of the electors, six millions out of seven, 
preferred to abstain from voting. 
 
 
<pb n="198"/>  
 
</p><p>As to the professions, the Assembly contained a large 
number of lawyers, advocates, notaries, bailiffs, ex-magistrates,

and a few literary men. 
</p><p>The mentality of the Convention was not homogeneous.  Now,

an assembly composed of individuals of widely different 
characters soon splits up into a number of groups.  The 
Convention very early contained three&mdash;the Gironde, the Mountain,

and the Plain.  The constitutional monarchists had almost 
disappeared. 
</p><p>The Gironde and the Mountain, extreme parties, consisted 
of about a hundred members apiece, who successively became 
leaders.  In the Mountain were the most advanced members: 
Couthon, H&eacute;rault de S&eacute;chelles, Danton, Camille 
Desmoulins, Marat, Collot d'Herbois, Billaud-Varennes, Barras, 
Saint-Just, Fouch&eacute;, Tallien, Carrier, Robespierre, &amp;c.  In

the Gironde were Brissot, P&eacute;tion, Condorcet, Vergniaud, 
&amp;c. 
</p><p>The five hundred other members of the Assembly&mdash;that is, 
the great majority&mdash;constituted what was known as the Plain. 
</p><p>This latter formed a floating mass, silent, undecided, and

timid; ready to follow every impulse and to be carried away by 
the excitement of the moment.  It gave ear indifferently to the 
stronger of the two preceding groups.  After obeying the Gironde 
for some time it allowed itself to be led away by the Mountain, 
when the latter triumphed over its enemy.  This was a natural 
consequence of the law already stated, by which the weak 
invariably fall under the dominion of the stronger wills. 
</p><p>The influence of great manipulators of men was 
 
 
<pb n="199"/>  
displayed in a high degree during the Convention.  It was 
constantly led by a violent minority of narrow minds, whose 
intense convictions lent them great strength. 
</p><p>A brutal and audacious minority will always lead a fearful

and irresolute majority.  This explains the constant tendency 
toward extremes to be observed in all revolutionary assemblies. 
The history of the Convention verifies once more the law of 
acceleration studied in another chapter. 
</p><p>The men of the Convention were thus bound to pass from 
moderation to greater and greater violence.  Finally they 
decimated themselves.  Of the 180 Girondists who at the outset 
led the Convention 140 were killed or fled, and finally the most 
fanatical of the Terrorists, Robespierre, reigned alone over a 
terrified crowd of servile representatives. 
</p><p>Yet it was among the five hundred members of the majority,

uncertain and floating as it was, that the intelligence and 
experience were to be found.  The technical committees to whom 
the useful work of the Convention was due were recruited from the

Plain. 
</p><p>More or less indifferent to politics, the members of the 
Plain were chiefly anxious that no one should pay particular 
attention to them.  Shut up in their committees, they showed 
themselves as little as possible in the Assembly, which explains 
why the sessions of the Convention contained barely a third of 
the deputies. 
</p><p>Unhappily, as often happens, these intelligent and honest 
men were completely devoid of character, and the fear which 
always dominated them made them 
 
 
<pb n="200"/>  
vote for the worst of the measures introduced by their dreaded 
masters. 
</p><p>The men of the Plain voted for everything they were 
ordered to vote for&mdash;the creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal, 
the Terror, &amp;c.  It was with their assistance that the Mountain 
crushed the Gironde, and Robespierre destroyed the 
H&eacute;bertists and Dantonists.  Like all weak people, they 
followed the strong.  The gentle philanthropists who composed the

Plain, and constituted the majority of the Assembly, contributed,

by their pusillanimity, to bring about the frightful excesses of 
the Convention. 
</p><p>The psychological note always prevailing in the Convention

was a horrible fear.  It was more especially through fear that 
men cut off one another's heads, in the doubtful hope of keeping 
their own on their shoulders. 
</p><p>Such a fear was, of course, very comprehensible.  The 
unhappy deputies deliberated amid the hootings and vociferations 
of the tribunes.  At every moment veritable savages, armed with 
pikes, invaded the Assembly, and the majority of the members no 
longer dared to attend the sessions.  When by chance they did go 
it was only to vote in silence according to the orders of the 
Mountain, which was only a third as numerous. 
</p><p>The fear which dominated the latter, although less 
visible, was just as profound.  Men destroyed their enemies, not 
only because they were shallow fanatics, but because they were 
convinced that their own existence was threatened.  The judges of

the revolutionary Tribunals trembled no less.  They would have 
willingly acquitted Danton, and the widow 
 
 
<pb n="201"/>  
of Camille Desmoulins, and many others.  They dared not. 
</p><p>But it was above all when Robespierre became the sole 
master that the phantom of fear oppressed the Assembly.  It has 
truly been said that a glance from the master made his colleagues

shrink with fear.  On their faces one read &ldquo;the pallor of 
fear and the abandon of despair.&rdquo; 
</p><p>All feared Robespierre and Robespierre feared all.  It was

because he feared conspiracies against him that he cut off men's 
heads, and it was also through fear that others allowed him to do

so. 
</p><p>The memoirs of members of the Convention show plainly what

a horrible memory they retained of this gloomy period. 
Questioned twenty years later, says Taine, on the true aim and 
the intimate thoughts of the Committee of Public Safety, 
Barr&egrave;re replied:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;We had only one feeling, that of self-preservation; 
only one desire, that of preserving our lives, which each of us 
believed to be threatened.  You had your neighbour's head cut off

so that your neighbour should not have you yourself 
guillotined.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The history of the Convention constitutes one of the most 
striking examples that could be given of the influence of leaders

and of fear upon an assembly.

THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CONVENTION 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d87"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The activity of the Clubs and the Commune during the

Convention</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>DURING the whole of its existence the Convention was governed 
by the leaders of the clubs and of the Commune. 
</p><p>We have already seen what was their influence on the 
preceding Assemblies.  It became overwhelming during the 
Convention.  The history of this latter is in reality that of the

clubs and the Commune which dominated it.  They enslaved, not 
only the Convention, but also all France.  Numerous little 
provincial clubs, directed by that of the capital, supervised 
magistrates, denounced suspects, and undertook the execution of 
all the revolutionary orders. 
</p><p>When the clubs or the Commune had decided upon certain 
measures they had them voted by the Assembly then and there.  If 
the Assembly resisted, they sent their armed delegations 
thither&mdash;that is, armed bands recruited from the scum of the 
populace.  They conveyed injunctions which were always slavishly 
obeyed.  The Commune was so sure of its strength that it even 
demanded of the Convention the immediate expulsion of deputies 
who displeased it. 
</p><p>While the Convention was composed generally of 
 
 
<pb n="203"/>  
educated men, the members of the Commune and the clubs comprised 
a majority of small shopkeepers, labourers, and artisans, 
incapable of personal opinions, and always guided by their 
leaders&mdash;Danton, Camille Desmoulins, Robespierre, &amp;c. 
</p><p>Of the two powers, clubs and insurrectionary Commune, the 
latter exercised the greater influence in Paris, because it had 
made for itself a revolutionary army.  It held under its orders 
forty-eight committees of National Guards, who asked nothing more

than to kill, sack, and, above all, plunder. 
</p><p>The tyranny with which the Commune crushed Paris was 
frightful.  For example, it delegated to a certain cobbler, 
Chalandon by name, the right of surveillance over a portion of 
the capital&mdash;a right implying the power to send to the 
Revolutionary Tribunal, and therefore to the guillotine, all 
those whom he suspected.  Certain streets were thus almost 
depopulated by him. 
</p><p>The Convention struggled feebly against the Commune at the

outset, but did not prolong its resistance.  The culminating 
point of the conflict occurred when the Convention wished to 
arrest H&eacute;bert, the friend of the Commune, and the latter 
sent armed bands who threatened the Assembly and demanded the 
expulsion of the Girondists who had provoked the measure.  Upon 
the Convention refusing the Commune besieged it on June 2, 1798, 
by means of its revolutionary army, which was under the orders of

Hanriot.  Terrified, the Assembly gave up twenty-seven of its 
members.  The Commune immediately sent a delegation ironically to

felicitate it upon its obedience. 
 
 
<pb n="204"/>  
 
</p><p>After the fall of the Girondists the Convention submitted 
itself completely to the injunctions of the omnipotent Commune. 
The latter decreed the levy of a revolutionary army, to be 
accompanied by a tribunal and a guillotine, which was to traverse

the whole of France in order to execute suspects. 
</p><p>Only towards the end of its existence, after the fall of 
Robespierre, did the Convention contrive to escape from the yoke 
of the Jacobins and the Commune.  It closed the Jacobin club and 
guillotined its leading members. 
</p><p>Despite such sanctions the leaders still continued to 
excite the populace and hurl it against the Convention.  In 
Germinal and Prairial it underwent regular sieges.  Armed 
delegations even succeeded in forcing the Convention to vote the 
re-establishment of the Commune and the convocation of a new 
Assembly, a measure which the Convention hastened to annul the 
moment the insurgents had withdrawn.  Ashamed of its fear, it 
sent for regiments which disarmed the <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi> and made 
nearly ten thousand arrests.  Twenty-six leaders of the movement 
were put to death, and six deputies who were concerned in the 
riot were guillotined. 
</p><p>But the Convention did not resist to any purpose.  When it

was no longer led by the clubs and the Commune it obeyed the 
Committee of Public Safety and voted its decrees without 
discussion. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Convention,&rdquo; writes H.  Williams, &ldquo;which 
spoke of nothing less than having all the princes and kings of 
Europe brought to its feet loaded with chains, was made prisoner 
in its own sanctuary by a handful of mercenaries.&rdquo;

<p>As soon as it assembled in 1792 the Convention began by 
decreeing the abolition of royalty, and in spite of the 
hesitation of a great number of its members, who knew that the 
provinces were royalist, it proclaimed the Republic. 
</p><p>Intimately persuaded that such a proclamation would 
transform the civilised world, it instituted a new era and a new 
calendar.  The year I. of this era marked the dawn of a world in 
which reason alone was to reign.  It was inaugurated by the trial

of Louis XVI., a measure which was ordered by the Commune, but 
which the majority of the Convention did not desire. 
</p><p>At its outset, in fact, the Convention was governed by its

relatively moderate elements, the Girondists.  The president and 
the secretaries had been chosen among the best known of this 
party.  Robespierre, who was later to become the absolute master 
of the Convention, possessed so little influence at this time 
that he obtained only six votes for the presidency, while 
P&eacute;tion received two hundred and thirty-five. 
</p><p>The Montagnards had at first only a very slight influence.

Their power was of later growth.  When they were in power there 
was no longer room in the Convention for moderate members. 
</p><p>Despite their minority the Montagnards found a way to 
force the Assembly to bring Louis to trial.  This was at once a 
victory over the Girondists, the condemnation of all kings, and a

final divorce between the old order and the new. 
 
 
<pb n="206"/>  
 
</p><p>To bring about the trial they man&oelig;uvred very 
skilfully, bombarding the Convention with petitions from the 
provinces, and sending a deputation from the insurrectional 
Commune of Paris, which demanded a trial. 
</p><p>According to a characteristic common to the Assemblies of 
the Revolution, that of yielding to threats and always doing the 
contrary of what they wished, the men of the Convention dared not

resist.  The trial was decided upon. 
</p><p>The Girondists, who individually would not have wished for

the death of the king, voted for it out of fear once they were 
assembled.  Hoping to save his own head, the Duc d'Orleans, 
Louis' cousin, voted with them.  If, on mounting the scaffold on 
January 21, 1793, Louis had had that vision of the future which 
we attribute to the gods, he would have seen following him, one 
by one, the greater number of the Girondists whose weakness had 
been unable to defend him. 
</p><p>Regarded only from the purely utilitarian point of view, 
the execution of the king was one of the mistakes of the 
Revolution.  It engendered civil war and armed Europe against 
France.  In the Convention itself his death gave rise to 
intestine struggles, which finally led to the triumph of the 
Montagnards and the expulsion of the Girondists. 
</p><p>The measures passed under the influence of the Montagnards

finally became so despotic that sixty departments, comprising the

West and the South, revolted.  The insurrection, which was headed

by many of the expelled deputies, would perhaps have succeeded 
had not the compromising assistance of the royalists caused men 
to fear the return of the <hi rend="italic">ancien</hi> 
 
 
<pb n="207"/>  
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>.  At Toulon, in fact, the insurgents 
acclaimed Louis XVII. 
</p><p>The civil war thus begun lasted during the greater part of

the life of the Revolution.  It was fought with the utmost 
savagery.  Old men, women, children, all were massacred, and 
villages and crops were burned.  In the Vend&eacute;e alone the 
number of the killed was reckoned at something between half a 
million and a million. 
</p><p>Civil war was soon followed by foreign war.  The Jacobins 
thought to remedy all these ills by creating a new Constitution. 
It was always a tradition with all the revolutionary assemblies 
to believe in the magic virtues of formula.  In France this 
conviction has never been affected by the failure of experiments.

</p><p>&ldquo;A robust faith,&rdquo; writes one of the great admirers

of the Revolution, M. Rambaud, &ldquo;sustained the Convention in 
this labour; it believed firmly that when it had formulated in a 
law the principles of the Revolution its enemies would be 
confounded, or, still better, converted, and that the advent of 
justice would disarm the insurgents.&rdquo; 
</p><p>During its lifetime the Convention drafted two 
Constitutions&mdash;that of 1793, or the year I., and that of 1795, or

the year III.  The first was never applied, an absolute 
dictatorship very soon replacing it; the second created the 
Directory. 
</p><p>The Convention contained a large number of lawyers and men

of affairs, who promptly comprehended the impossibility of 
government by means of a large Assembly.  They soon divided the 
Convention into small committees, each of which had an 
independent existence&mdash;business committees, 
 
 
<pb n="208"/>  
committees of legislation, finance, agriculture, arts, &amp;c.  These

committees prepared the laws which the Assembly usually voted 
with its eyes closed. 
</p><p>Thanks to them, the work of the Convention was not purely 
destructive.  They drafted many very useful measures, creating 
important colleges, establishing the metric system, &amp;c.  The 
majority of the members of the Assembly, as we have already seen,

took refuge in these committees in order to evade the political 
conflict which would have endangered their heads. 
</p><p>Above the business committees, which had nothing to do 
with politics, was the Committee of Public Safety, instituted in 
April, 1793, and composed of nine members.  Directed at first by 
Danton, and in the July of the same year by Robespierre, it 
gradually absorbed all the powers of government, including that 
of giving orders to ministers and generals.  Carnot directed the 
operations of the war, Cambon the finances, and Saint-Just and 
Collot-d'Herbois the general policy. 
</p><p>Although the laws voted by the technical committees were 
often very wise, and constituted the lasting work of the 
Convention, those which the Assembly voted in a body under the 
threats of the delegations which invaded it were manifestly 
ridiculous. 
</p><p>Among these laws, which were not greatly in the interests 
of the public or of the Convention itself, were the law of the 
maximum, voted in September, 1793, which pretended to fix the 
price of provisions, and which merely established a continual 
dearth; the destruction of the royal tombs at Saint-Denis; the 
 
 
<pb n="209"/>  
trial of the queen, the systematic devastation of the 
Vend&eacute;e by fire, the establishment of the Revolutionary 
Tribunal, &amp;c. 
</p><p>The Terror was the chief means of government during the 
Convention.  Commencing in September, 1793, it reigned for six 
months&mdash;that is, until the death of Robespierre.  Vainly did 
certain Jacobins&mdash; Danton, Camille Desmoulins, H&eacute;rault de 
S&eacute;chelles, &amp;c.&mdash;propose that clemency should be given a 
trial.  The only result of this proposition was that its authors 
were sent to the scaffold.  It was merely the lassitude of the 
public that finally put an end to this shameful period. 
</p><p>The successive struggles of the various parties in the 
Convention and its tendency towards extremes eliminated one by 
one the men of importance who had once played their part therein.

Finally it fell under the exclusive domination of Robespierre. 
While the Convention was disorganising and ravaging France, the 
armies were winning brilliant victories.  They had seized the 
left bank of the Rhine, Belgium, and Holland.  The treaty of 
Basle ratified these conquests. 
</p><p>We have already mentioned, and we shall return to the 
matter again, that the work of the armies must be considered 
absolutely apart from that of the Convention.  Contemporaries 
understood this perfectly, but to-day it is often forgotten. 
</p><p>When the Convention was dissolved, in 1795, after lasting 
for three years, it was regarded with universal distrust.  The 
perpetual plaything of popular caprice, it had not succeeded in 
pacifying France, but had plunged her into anarchy.  The 
 
 
<pb n="210"/>  
general opinion respecting the Convention is well summed up in a 
letter written in July, 1799, by the Swedish <hi rend="italic">charg&eacute; 
d'affaires</hi>, Baron Drinkmann:  &ldquo;I venture to hope that no 
people will ever be governed by the will of more cruel and 
imbecile scoundrels than those that have ruled France since the 
beginning of her new liberty.&rdquo; 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d89"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The End of the Convention.  The Beginnings of the 
Directory</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>At the end of its existence, the Convention, always trusting 
to the power of formul&aelig;, drafted a new Constitution, that 
of the year III., intended to replace that of 1793, which had 
never been put into execution.  The legislative power was to be 
shared by a so-called Council of Ancients composed of 150 
members, and a council of deputies numbering 500.  The executive 
power was confided to a Directory of five members, who were 
appointed by the Ancients upon nomination by the Five Hundred, 
and renewed every year by the election of one of their number. 
It was specified that two-thirds of the members of the new 
Assembly should be chosen from among the deputies of the 
Convention.  This prudent measure was not very efficacious, as 
only ten departments remained faithful to the Jacobins. 
</p><p>To avoid the election of royalists, the Convention had 
decided to banish all <hi rend="italic">emigr&eacute;s</hi> in perpetuity. 
</p><p>The announcement of this Constitution did not produce the 
anticipated effect upon the public.  It had no effect upon the 
popular riots, which continued.  One of the most important was 
that which threatened the Convention on the 5th of October, 1795.

The 
 
 
<pb n="211"/>  
leaders hurled a veritable army upon the Assembly.  Before such 
provocation, the Convention finally decided to defend itself, and

sent for troops, entrusting the command to Barras. 
</p><p>Bonaparte, who was then beginning to emerge from 
obscurity, was entrusted with the task of repression.  With such 
a leader action was swift and energetic.  Vigorously pounded with

ball near the church at St. Roch, the insurgents fled, leaving 
some hundreds of dead on the spot. 
</p><p>This action, which displayed a firmness to which the 
Convention was little habituated, was only due to the celerity of

the military operations, for while these were being carried out 
the insurgents had sent delegates to the Assembly, which, as 
usual, showed itself quite ready to yield to them. 
</p><p>The repression of this riot constituted the last important

act of the Convention.  On the 26th of October, 1795, it declared

its mission terminated, and gave way to the Directory. 
</p><p>We have already laid stress upon some of the psychological

lessons furnished by the government of the Convention.  One of 
the most striking of these is the impotence of violence to 
dominate men's minds in permanence. 
</p><p>Never did any Government possess such formidable means of 
action, yet in spite of the permanent guillotine, despite the 
delegates sent with the guillotine into the provinces, despite 
its Draconian laws, the Convention had to struggle perpetually 
against riots, insurrections, and conspiracies.  The cities, the 
departments, and the <hi rend="italic">faubourgs</hi> of Paris were continually 
rising in revolt, although heads were falling by the thousand. 
 
 
<pb n="212"/> </p><p> 
 
This Assembly, which thought itself sovereign, fought against the

invincible forces which were fixed in men's minds, and which 
material constraint was powerless to overcome.  Of these hidden 
motive forces it never understood the power, and it struggled 
against them in vain.  In the end the invisible forces triumphed.

INSTANCES OF REVOLUTIONARY VIOLENCE 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d91"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Psychological Causes of Revolutionary 
Violence</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WE have shown in the course of the preceding chapters that the

revolutionary theories constituted a new faith. 
</p><p>Humanitarian and sentimental, they exalted liberty and 
fraternity.  But, as in many religions, we can observe a complete

contradiction between doctrine and action.  In practice no 
liberty was tolerated, and fraternity was quickly replaced by 
frenzied massacres. 
</p><p>This opposition between principles and conduct results 
from the intolerance which accompanies all beliefs.  A religion 
may be steeped in humanitarianism and forbearance, but its 
sectaries will always want to impose it on others by force, so 
that violence is the inevitable result. 
</p><p>The cruelties of the Revolution were thus the inherent 
results of the propagation of the new dogmas.  The Inquisition, 
the religious wars of France, St. Bartholomew's Day, the 
revocation of the Edict of Nantes, the &ldquo;Dragonnades,&rdquo; the

persecution of the Jansenists, &amp;c., belonged to the same family 
as the Terror and derived from the same psychological sources. 
</p><p>Louis XIV. was not a cruel king, yet under the 
 
 
<pb n="214"/>  
impulse of his faith he drove hundreds of thousands of 
Protestants out of France, after first shooting down a 
considerable number and sending others to the galleys. 
</p><p>The methods of persuasion adopted by all believers are by 
no means a consequence of their fear of the dissentient 
opposition.  Protestants and Jansenists were anything but 
dangerous under Louis XIV.  Intolerance arises above all from the

indignation experienced by a mind which is convinced that it 
possesses the most dazzling verities against the men who deny 
those truths, and who are surely not acting in good faith.  How 
can one support error when one has the necessary strength to wipe

it out? 
</p><p>Thus have reasoned the believers of all ages.  Thus 
reasoned Louis XIV. and the men of the Terror.  These latter also

were convinced that they were in possession of absolute truths, 
which they believed to be obvious, and whose triumph was certain 
to regenerate humanity.  Could they be more tolerant toward their

adversaries than the Church and the kings of France had been 
toward heretics? 
</p><p>We are forced to believe that terror is a method which all

believers regard as a necessity, since from the beginning of the 
ages religious codes have always been based upon terror.  To 
force men to observe their prescriptions, believers have sought 
to terrify them with threats of an eternal hell of torments. 
</p><p>The apostles of the Jacobin belief behaved as their 
fathers had done, and employed the same methods.  If similar 
events occurred again we should see identical actions repeated. 
If a new belief&mdash;Socialism, for example&mdash;were to triumph 
tomorrow, it would be led 
 
 
<pb n="215"/>  
to employ methods of propaganda like those of the Inquisition and

the Terror. 
</p><p>But were we to regard the Jacobin Terror solely as the 
result of a religious movement, we should not completely 
apprehend it.  Around a triumphant religious belief, as we saw in

the case of the Reformation, gather a host of individual 
interests which are dependent on that belief.  The Terror was 
directed by a few fanatical apostles, but beside this small 
number of ardent proselytes, whose narrow minds dreamed of 
regenerating the world, were great numbers of men who lived only 
to enrich themselves.  They rallied readily around the first 
victorious leader who promised to enable them to enjoy the 
results of their pillage. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Terrorists of the Revolution,&rdquo; writes Albert 
Sorel, &ldquo;resorted to the Terror because they wished to remain 
in power, and were incapable of doing so by other means.  They 
employed it for their own salvation, and after the event they 
stated that their motive was the salvation of the State.  Before 
it became a system it was a means of government, and the system 
was only invented to justify the means.&rdquo; 
</p><p>We may thus fully agree with the following verdict on the 
Terror, written by Emile Ollivier in his work on the Revolution: 
&ldquo;The Terror was above all a Jacquerie, a regularised pillage,

the vastest enterprise of theft that any association of criminals

has ever organised.&rdquo; 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d92"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Revolutionary Tribunals</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The Revolutionary Tribunals constituted the principal means of

action of the Terror.  Besides that of Paris, created at the 
instigation of Danton, and which 
 
 
<pb n="216"/>  
a year afterwards sent its founder to the guillotine, France was 
covered with such tribunals. 
</p><p>&ldquo;One hundred and seventy-eight tribunals,&rdquo; says 
Taine, &ldquo;of which 40 were perambulant, pronounced death 
sentences in all parts of the country, which were carried out 
instantly on the spot.  Between the 16th of April, 1793, and the 
9th of Thermidor in the year II. that of Paris guillotined 2,625 
persons, and the provincial judges worked as hard as those of 
Paris.  In the little town of Orange alone 331 persons were 
guillotined.  In the city of Arras 299 men and 93 women were 
guillotined. . . .  In the city of Lyons alone the revolutionary 
commissioner admitted to 1,684 executions. . . .  The total 
number of these murders has been put at 17,000, among whom were 
1,200 women, of whom a number were octogenarians.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Although the Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris claimed only 
2,625 victims, it must not be forgotten that all the suspects had

already been summarily massacred during the &ldquo;days&rdquo; of 
September. 
</p><p>The Revolutionary Tribunal of Paris, a mere instrument of 
the Committee of Public Safety, limited itself in reality, as 
Fouquier-Tinville justly remarked during his trial, to executing 
its orders.  It surrounded itself at first with a few legal forms

which did not long survive.  Interrogatory, defence, witnesses&mdash; 
all were finally suppressed.  Moral proof&mdash;that is, mere 
suspicion&mdash;sufficed to procure condemnation.  The president 
usually contented himself with putting a vague question to the 
accused.  To work more rapidly still, Fouquier-Tinville proposed 
to have the guillotine installed on the same premises as the 
Tribunal. 
</p><p>This Tribunal sent indiscriminately to the scaffold 
 
 
<pb n="217"/>  
all the accused persons arrested by reason of party hatred.  and 
very soon, in the hands of Robespierre, it constituted an 
instrument of the bloodiest tyranny.  When Danton, one of its 
founders, became its victim, he justly asked pardon of God and 
men, before mounting the scaffold for having assisted to create 
such a Tribunal. 
</p><p>Nothing found mercy before it: neither the genius of 
Lavoisier, nor the gentleness of Lucile Desmoulins, nor the merit

of Malesherbes.  &ldquo;So much talent,&rdquo; said Benjamin 
Constant, &ldquo;massacred by the most cowardly and brutish of 
men!&rdquo; 
</p><p>To find any excuse for the Revolutionary Tribunal, we must

return to our conception of the religious mentality of the 
Jacobins, who founded and directed it.  It was a piece of work 
comparable in its spirit and its aim to the Inquisition.  The men

who furnished its victims&mdash;Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Couthon&mdash;

believed themselves the benefactors of the human race in 
suppressing all infidels, the enemies of the faith that was to 
regenerate the earth. 
</p><p>The executions during the Terror did not affect the 
members of the aristocracy only, since 4,000 peasants and 3,000 
working-men were guillotined. 
</p><p>Given the emotion produced in Paris in our days by a 
capital execution, one might suppose that the execution of so 
many persons at one time would produce a very great emotion.  But

habit had so dulled sensibility that people paid but little 
attention to the matter at last.  Mothers would take their 
children to see people guillotined as to-day they take them to 
the marionette theatre. 
</p><p>The daily spectacle of executions made the men of 
 
 
<pb n="218"/>  
the time very indifferent to death.  All mounted the scaffold 
with perfect tranquillity, the Girondists singing the 
Marseillaise as they climbed the steps. 
</p><p>This resignation resulted from the law of habitude, which 
very rapidly dulls emotion.  To judge by the fact that royalist 
risings were taking place daily, the prospect of the guillotine 
no longer terrified men.  Things happened as though the Terror 
terrorised no one.  Terror is an efficacious psychological 
process so long as it does not last.  The real terror resides far

more in threats than in their realisation. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d93"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Terror in the Provinces</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The executions of the Revolutionary Tribunals in the provinces

represented only a portion of the massacres effected in the 
departments during the Terror.  The revolutionary army, composed 
of vagabonds and brigands, marched through France killing and 
pillaging.  Its method of procedure is well indicated by the 
following passage from Taine:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;At Bedouin, a town of 2,000 inhabitants, where 
unknown hands had cut down the tree of liberty, 433 houses were 
demolished or fired, 16 persons were guillotined, and 47 shot 
down; all the other inhabitants were expelled and reduced to 
living as vagabonds in the mountains, and to taking shelter in 
caverns which they hollowed out of the earth.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The fate of the wretches sent before the Revolutionary 
Tribunals was no better.  The first mockery of trial was quickly 
suppressed.  At Nantes, Carrier drowned and shot down according 
to his fancy nearly 5,000 persons&mdash;men, women, and children. 
</p><p>The details of these massacres figured in the 
 
 
<pb n="219"/>  
<hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> after the reaction of Thermidor.  I cite a few 
lines:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;I saw,&rdquo; says Thomas, &ldquo;after the taking of 
Noirmoutier, men and women and old people burned alive . 
. . women violated, girls of fourteen and fifteen, and massacred 
afterward, and tender babes thrown from bayonet to bayonet; 
children who were taken from beside their mothers stretched out 
on the ground.&rdquo; 
</p><p>In the same number we read a deposition by one Julien, 
relating how Carrier forced his victims to dig their graves and 
to allow themselves to be buried alive.  The issue of October 15,

1794, contained a report by Merlin de Thionville proving that the

captain of the vessel <hi rend="italic">le Destin</hi> had received orders to 
embark forty-one victims to be drowned&mdash;&ldquo;among them a blind 
man of 78, twelve women, twelve girls, and fourteen children, of 
whom ten were from 10 to 6 and five at the breast.&rdquo; 
</p><p>In the course of Carrier's trial (<hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, 
December 30, 1794) it was proved that he &ldquo;had given orders to

drown and shoot women and children, and had ordered General Haxo 
to exterminate all the inhabitants of La Vend&eacute;e and to 
burn down their dwellings.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Carrier, like all wholesale murderers, took an intense joy

in seeing his victims suffer.  &ldquo;In the department in which I 
hunted the priests,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have never laughed so 
much or experienced such pleasure as in watching their dying 
grimaces&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, December 22, 1794). 
</p><p>Carrier was tried to satisfy the reaction of Thermidor. 
But the massacres of Nantes were 
 
 
<pb n="220"/>  
repeated in many other towns.  Fouch&eacute; slew more than 2,000

persons at Lyons, and so many were killed at Toulon that the 
population fell from 29,000 to 7,000 in a few months. 
</p><p>We must say in defence of Carrier, Fr&eacute;ron, 
Fouch&eacute; and all these sinister persons, that they were 
incessantly stimulated by the Committee of Public Safety. 
Carrier gave proof of this during his trial. 
</p><p>&ldquo;I admit,&rdquo; said he (<hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi>, December 24, 
1794), &ldquo;that 150 or 200 prisoners were shot every day, but it

was by order of the commission.  I informed the Convention that 
the brigands were being shot down by hundreds, and it applauded 
this letter, and ordered its insertion in the <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi>. 
What were these deputies doing then who are so furious against me

now?  They were applauding.  Why did they still keep me `on 
mission'?  Because I was then the saviour of the country, and now

I am a bloodthirsty man.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Unhappily for him, Carrier did not know, as he remarked in

the same speech, that only seven or eight persons led the 
Convention.  But the terrorised Assembly approved of all that 
these seven or eight ordered, so that they could say nothing in 
reply to Carrier's argument.  He certainly deserved to be 
guillotined, but the whole Convention deserved to be guillotined 
with him, since it had approved of the massacres. 
</p><p>The defence of Carrier, justified by the letters of the 
Committee, by which the representatives &ldquo;on mission&rdquo; were

incessantly stimulated, shows that the violence of the Terror 
resulted from a system, and not, as has sometimes been claimed, 
from the initiative of a few individuals. 
 
 
<pb n="221"/>  
 
</p><p>The thirst for destruction during the Terror was by no 
means assuaged by the destruction of human beings only; there was

an even greater destruction of inanimate things.  The true 
believer is always an iconoclast.  Once in power, he destroys 
with equal zeal the enemies of his faith and the images, temples,

and symbols which recall the faith attacked. 
</p><p>We know that the first action of the Emperor Theodosius 
when converted to the Christian religion was to break down the 
majority of the temples which for six thousand years had been 
built beside the Nile.  We must not, therefore, be surprised to 
see the leaders of the Revolution attacking the monuments and 
works of art which for them were the vestiges of an abhorred 
past. 
</p><p>Statues, manuscripts, stained glass windows, and plate 
were frenziedly broken.  When Fouch&eacute;, the future Duke of 
Otranto under Napoleon, and minister under Louis XVIII., was sent

as commissary of the Convention to the Nievre, he ordered the 
demolition of all the towers of the <hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi> and the

belfries of the churches &ldquo;because they wounded equality.&rdquo;

</p><p>Revolutionary vandalism expended itself even on the tomb. 
Following a report read by Barr&egrave;re to the Convention, the 
magnificent royal tombs at Saint-Denis, among which was the 
admirable mausoleum of Henri II., by Germain Pilon, were smashed 
to pieces, the coffins emptied, and the body of Turenne sent to 
the Museum as a curiosity, after one of the keepers had extracted

the teeth in order to sell them as curiosities.  The moustache 
and beard of Henri IV. were also torn out. 
</p><p>It is impossible to witness such comparatively 
 
 
<pb n="222"/>  
enlightened men consenting to the destruction of the artistic 
patriotism of France without a feeling of sadness.  To excuse 
them, we must remember that intense beliefs give rise to the 
worst excesses, and also that the Convention, almost daily 
invaded by rioters, always yielded to the popular will. 
</p><p>This glowing record of devastation proves, not only the 
power of fanaticism: it shows us what becomes of men who are 
liberated from all social restraints, and of the country which 
falls into their hands.

<p>IF nothing were known of the revolutionary Assemblies, and 
notably of the Convention, beyond their internal dissensions, 
their weakness, and their acts of violence, their memory would 
indeed be a gloomy one. 
</p><p>But even for its enemies this bloodstained epoch must 
always retain an undeniable glory, thanks to the success of its 
armies.  When the Convention dissolved France was already the 
greater by Belgium and the territories on the left bank of the 
Rhine. 
</p><p>Regarding the Convention as a whole, it seems equitable to

credit it with the victories of the armies of France, but if we 
analyse this whole in order to study each of its elements 
separately their independence will at once be obvious.  It is at 
once apparent that the Convention had a very small share in the 
military events of the time.  The armies on the frontier and the 
revolutionary Assemblies in Paris formed two separate worlds, 
which had very little influence over one another, and which 
regarded matters in a very different light. 
</p><p>We have seen that the Convention was a weak Government, 
which changed its ideas daily, according to popular impulse; it 
was really an example of the 
 
 
<pb n="224"/>  
profoundest anarchy.  It directed nothing, but was itself 
continually directed; how, then, could it have commanded armies? 
</p><p>Completely absorbed in its intestine quarrels, the 
Assembly had abandoned all military questions to a special 
committee, which was directed almost single-handed by Carnot, and

whose real function was to furnish the troops with provisions and

ammunition.  The merit of Carnot consisted in the fact that 
besides directing over 752,000 men at the disposal of France, 
upon points which were strategically valuable, he also advised 
the generals of the armies to take the offensive, and to preserve

a strict discipline. 
</p><p>The sole share of the Assembly in the defence of the 
country was the decree of the general levy.  In the face of the 
numerous enemies then threatening France, no Government could 
have avoided such a measure.  For some little time, too, the 
Assembly had sent representatives to the armies instructed to 
decapitate certain generals, but this policy was soon abandoned. 
</p><p>As a matter of fact the military activities of the 
Assembly were always extremely slight.  The armies, thanks to 
their numbers, their enthusiasm, and the tactics devised by their

youthful generals, achieved their victories unaided.  They fought

and conquered independently of the Convention.

Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Before enumerating the various psychological factors which 
contributed to the successes of the revolutionary armies, it will

be useful briefly to recall the origin and the development of the

war against Europe. 
 
 
<pb n="225"/>  
 
</p><p>At the commencement of the Revolution the foreign 
sovereigns regarded with satisfaction the difficulties of the 
French monarchy, which they had long regarded as a rival power. 
The King of Prussia, believing France to be greatly enfeebled, 
thought to enrich himself at her expense, so he proposed to the 
Emperor of Austria to help Louis on condition of receiving 
Flanders and Alsace as an indemnity.  The two sovereigns signed 
an alliance against France in February, 1792.  The French 
anticipated attack by declaring war upon Austria, under the 
influence of the Girondists.  The French army was at the outset 
subjected to several checks.  The allies penetrated into 
Champagne, and came within 130 miles of Paris.  Dumouriez' 
victory at Valmy forced them to retire. 
</p><p>Although 300 French and 200 Prussians only were killed in 
this battle, it had very significant results.  The fact that an 
army reputed invincible had been forced to retreat gave boldness 
to the young revolutionary troops, and everywhere they took the 
offensive.  In a few weeks the soldiers of Valmy had chased the 
Austrians out of Belgium, where they were welcomed as liberators.

</p><p>But it was under the Convention that the war assumed such 
importance.  At the beginning of 1793 the Assembly declared that 
Belgium was united to France.  From this resulted a conflict with

England which lasted for twenty-two years. 
</p><p>Assembled at Antwerp in April, 1793, the representatives 
of England, Prussia, and Austria resolved to dismember France. 
The Prussians were to seize Alsace and Lorraine; the Austrians, 
Flanders and Artois; the English, Dunkirk.  The Austrian 
ambassador 
 
 
<pb n="226"/>  
proposed to crush the Revolution by terror, &ldquo;by exterminating

practically the whole of the party directing the nation.&rdquo;  In

the face of such declarations France had perforce to conquer or 
to perish. 
</p><p>During this first coalition, between 1793 and 1797, France

had to fight on all her frontiers, from the Pyrenees to the 
north. 
</p><p>At the outset she lost her former conquests, and suffered 
several reverses.  The Spaniards took Perpignan and Bayonne; the 
English, Toulon; and the Austrians, Valenciennes.  It was then 
that the Convention, towards the end of 1793, ordered a general 
levy of all Frenchmen between the ages of eighteen and forty, and

succeeded in sending to the frontiers a total of some 750,000 
men.  The old regiments of the royal army were combined with 
battalions of volunteers and conscripts. 
</p><p>The allies were repulsed, and Maubeuge was relieved after 
the victory of Wattigny, which was gained by Jourdan.  Hoche 
rescued Lorraine.  France took the offensive, reconquering 
Belgium and the left bank of the Rhine.  Jourdan defeated the 
Austrians at Fleurus, drove them back upon the Rhine, and 
occupied Cologne and Coblentz.  Holland was invaded.  The allied 
sovereigns resigned themselves to suing for peace, and recognised

the French conquests. 
</p><p>The successes of the French were favoured by the fact that

the enemy never put their whole heart into the affair, as they 
were preoccupied by the partition of Poland, which they effected 
in 1793-5.  Each Power wished to be on the spot in order to 
obtain more territory.  This motive had already caused the 
 
 
<pb n="227"/>  
King of Prussia to retire after the battle of Valmy in 1792. 
</p><p>The hesitations of the allies and their mutual distrust 
were extremely advantageous to the French.  Had the Austrians 
marched upon Paris in the summer of 1793, &ldquo;we should,&rdquo; 
said General Thi&eacute;bault, &ldquo;have lost a hundred times for

one.  They alone saved us, by giving us time to make soldiers, 
officers, and generals.&rdquo; 
</p><p>After the treaty of Basle, France had no important 
adversaries on the Continent, save the Austrians.  It was then 
that the Directory attacked Austria in Italy.  Bonaparte was 
entrusted with the charge of this campaign.  After a year of 
fighting, from April, 1796, to April, 1797, he forced the last 
enemies of France to demand peace. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d97"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Psychological and Military Factors which determined 
the Success of the Revolutionary Armies</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>To realise the causes of the success of the revolutionary 
armies we must remember the prodigious enthusiasm, endurance, and

abnegation of these ragged and often barefoot troops.  Thoroughly

steeped in revolutionary principles, they felt that they were the

apostles of a new religion, which was destined to regenerate the 
world. 
</p><p>The history of the armies of the Revolution recalls that 
of the nomads of Arabia, who, excited to fanaticism by the ideals

of Mohammed, were transformed into formidable armies which 
rapidly conquered a portion of the old Roman world.  An analogous

faith endowed the Republican soldiers with a heroism and 
intrepidity which never failed 
 
 
<pb n="228"/>  
them, and which no reverse could shake When the Convention gave 
place to the Directory they had liberated the country, and had 
carried a war of invasion into the enemy's territory.  At this 
period the soldiers were the only true Republicans left in 
France. 
</p><p>Faith is contagious, and the Revolution was regarded as a 
new era, so that several of the nations invaded, oppressed by the

absolutism of their monarchs, welcomed the invaders as 
liberators.  The inhabitants of Savoy ran out to meet the troops.

At Mayence the crowd welcomed them with enthusiasm planted trees 
of liberty, and formed a Convention in imitation of that of 
Paris. 
</p><p>So long as the armies of the Revolution had to deal with 
peoples bent under the yoke of absolute monarchy, and having no 
personal ideal to defend, their success was relatively easy.  But

when they entered into conflict with peoples who had an ideal as 
strong as their own victory became far more difficult. 
</p><p>The new ideal of liberty and equality was capable of 
seducing peoples who had no precise convictions, and were 
suffering from the despotism of their masters, but it was 
naturally powerless against those who possessed a potent ideal of

their own which had been long established in their minds.  For 
this reason Bretons and Vend&eacute;eans, whose religious and 
monarchical sentiments were extremely powerful, successfully 
struggled for years against the armies of the Republic. 
</p><p>In March, 1793, the insurrections of the Vend&eacute;e and

Brittany had spread to ten departments.  The 
 
 
<pb n="229"/>  
Vend&eacute;eans in Poitou and the Chouans in Brittany put 80,000

men in the field. 
</p><p>The conflicts between contrary ideals&mdash;that is, between 
beliefs in which reason can play no part&mdash;are always pitiless, 
and the struggle with the Vend&eacute;e immediately assumed the 
ferocious savagery always observable in religious wars.  It 
lasted until the end of 1795, when Hoche finally 
&ldquo;pacified&rdquo; the country.  This pacification was the simple

result of the practical extermination of its defenders. 
</p><p>&ldquo;After two years of civil war,&rdquo; writes Molinari, 
&ldquo;the Vend&eacute;e was no more than a hideous heap of ruins. 
About 900,000 individuals&mdash;men, women, children, and aged 
people&mdash;had perished, and the small number of those who had 
escaped massacre could scarcely find food or shelter.  The fields

were devastated, the hedges and walls destroyed, and the houses 
burned.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Besides their faith, which so often rendered them 
invincible, the soldiers of the Revolution had usually the 
advantage of being led by remarkable generals, full of ardour and

formed on the battle-field. 
</p><p>The majority of the former leaders of the army, being 
nobles, had emigrated so that a new body of officers had to be 
organised.  The result was that those gifted with innate military

aptitudes had a chance of showing them, and passed through all 
the grades of rank in a few months.  Hoche, for instance, a 
corporal in 1789, was a general of division and commander of an 
army at the age of twenty-five.  The extreme youth of these 
leaders resulted in a spirit of aggression to which the armies 
opposed to them were not accustomed.  Selected only according 
 
 
<pb n="230"/>  
to merit, and hampered by no traditions, no routine, they quickly

succeeded in working out a tactics suited to the new necessities.

</p><p>Of soldiers without experience opposed to seasoned 
professional troops, drilled and trained according to the methods

in use everywhere since the Seven Years' War, one could not 
expect complicated man&oelig;uvres. 
</p><p>Attacks were delivered simply by great masses of troops. 
Thanks to the numbers of the men at the disposal of their 
generals, the considerable gaps provoked by this efficacious but 
barbarous procedure could be rapidly filled. 
</p><p>Deep masses of men attacked the enemy with the bayonet, 
and quickly routed men accustomed to methods which were more 
careful of the lives of soldiers.  The slow rate of fire in those

days rendered the French tactics relatively easy of employment. 
It triumphed, but at the cost of enormous losses.  It has been 
calculated that between 1792 and 1800 the French army left more 
than a third of its effective force on the battle-field (700,000 
men out of 2,000,000). 
</p><p>Examining events from a psychological point of view, we 
shall continue to elicit the consequences from the facts on which

they are consequent. 
</p><p>A study of the revolutionary crowds in Paris and in the 
armies presents very different but readily interpreted pictures. 
</p><p>We have proved that crowds, unable to reason, obey simply 
their impulses, which are always changing, but we have also seen 
that they are readily capable of heroism, that their altruism is 
often highly 
 
 
<pb n="231"/>  
developed, and that it is easy to find thousands of men ready to 
give their lives for a belief. 
</p><p>Psychological characteristics so diverse must naturally, 
according to the circumstances, lead to dissimilar and even 
absolutely contradictory actions.  The history of the Convention 
and its armies proves as much.  It shows us crowds composed of 
similar elements acting so differently in Paris and on the 
frontiers that one can hardly believe the same people can be in 
question. 
</p><p>In Paris the crowds were disorderly, violent, murderous, 
and so changeable in their demands as to make all government 
impossible. 
</p><p>In the armies the picture was entirely different.  The 
same multitudes of unaccustomed men, restrained by the orderly 
elements of a laborious peasant population, standardised by 
military discipline, and inspired by contagious enthusiasm, 
heroically supported privations, disdained perils, and 
contributed to form that fabulous strain which triumphed over the

most redoubtable troops in Europe. 
</p><p>These facts are among those which should always be invoked

to show the force of discipline.  It transforms men.  Liberated 
from its influence, peoples and armies become barbarian hordes. 
</p><p>This truth is daily and increasingly forgotten.  Ignoring 
the fundamental laws of collective logic, we give way more and 
more to shifting popular impulses, instead of learning to direct 
them.  The multitude must be shown the road to follow; it is not 
for them to choose it.

PSYCHOLOGY OF THE LEADERS OF THE

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d99"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Mentality of the Men of the Revolution.  The 
respective Influence of Violent and Feeble Characters</hi>.</head>

 
<p>MEN judge with their intelligence, and are guided by their 
characters.  To understand a man fully one must separate these 
two elements. 
</p><p>During the great periods of activity&mdash;and the 
revolutionary movements naturally belong to such periods&mdash; 
character always takes the first rank. 
</p><p>Having in several chapters described the various 
mentalities which predominate in times of disturbance, we need 
not return to the subject now.  They constitute general types 
which are naturally modified by each man's inherited and acquired

personality. 
</p><p>We have seen what an important part was played by the 
mystic element in the Jacobin mentality, and the ferocious 
fanaticism to which it led the sectaries of the new faith. 
</p><p>We have also seen that all the members of the Assemblies 
were not fanatics.  These latter were even in the minority, since

in the most sanguinary of the revolutionary assemblies the great 
majority was composed of timid and moderate men of neutral 
character.  Before Thermidor the members of this 
 
 
<pb n="233"/>  
group voted from fear with the violent and after Thermidor with 
the moderate deputies. 
</p><p>In time of revolution, as at other times, these neutral 
characters, obeying the most contrary impulses, are always the 
most numerous.  They are also as dangerous in reality as the 
violent characters.  The force of the latter is supported by the 
weakness of the former. 
</p><p>In all revolutions, and in particularly in the French 
Revolution, we observe a small minority of narrow but decided 
minds which imperiously dominate an immense majority of men who 
are often very intelligent but are lacking in character 
</p><p>Besides the fanatical apostles and the feeble characters, 
a revolution always produces individuals who merely think how to 
profit thereby.  These were numerous during the French 
Revolution.  Their aim was simply to utilise circumstances so as 
to enrich themselves.  Such were Barras, Tallien, Fouch&eacute;, 
Barr&egrave;re, and many more.  Their politics consisted simply 
in serving the strong against the weak. 
</p><p>From the outset of the Revolution these 
&ldquo;arrivists,&rdquo; as one would call them to-day, were 
numerous.  Camille Desmoulins wrote in 1792:  &ldquo;Our Revolution

has its roots only in the egotism and self-love of each 
individual, of the combination of which the general interest is 
composed.&rdquo; 
</p><p>If we add to these indications the observations contained 
in another chapter concerning the various forms of mentality to 
be observed in times of political upheaval, we shall obtain a 
general idea of the character of the men of the Revolution.  We 
shall now apply the principles already expounded to the 
 
 
<pb n="234"/>  
most remarkable personages of the revolutionary period. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d100"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Psychology of the Commissaries or Representatives 
&ldquo;on Mission.&rdquo;</hi></head> 
 
<p>In Paris the conduct of the members of the Convention was 
always directed, restrained, or excited by the action of their 
colleagues, and that of their environment. 
</p><p>To judge them properly we should observe them when left to

themselves and uncontrolled, when they possessed full liberty. 
Such were the representatives who were sent &ldquo;on mission&rdquo; 
into the departments by the Convention. 
</p><p>The power of these delegates was absolute.  No censure 
embarrassed them.  Functionaries and magistrates had perforce to 
obey them. 
</p><p>A representative &ldquo;on mission&rdquo; 
&ldquo;requisitions,&rdquo; sequestrates, or confiscates as seems 
good to him; taxes, imprisons, deports, or decapitates as he 
thinks fit, and in his own district he is a pasha.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Regarding themselves as &ldquo;pashas,&rdquo; they displayed 
themselves &ldquo;drawn in carriages with six horses, surrounded by

guards; sitting at sumptuous tables with thirty covers, eating to

the sound of music, with a following of players, courtezans, and 
mercenaries. . . .&rdquo;  At Lyons &ldquo;the solemn appearance of 
Collot d'Herbois is like that of the Grand Turk.  No one can come

into his presence without three repeated requests; a string of 
apartments precedes his reception-room, and no one approaches 
nearer than fifteen paces.&rdquo; 
</p><p>One can picture the immense vanity of these 
 
 
<pb n="235"/>  
dictators as they solemly entered the towns, surrounded by 
guards, men whose gesture was enough to cause heads to fall. 
</p><p>Petty lawyers without clients, doctors without patients, 
unfrocked clergymen, obscure attorneys, who had formerly known 
the most colourless of lives, were suddenly made the equals of 
the most powerful tyrants of history.  Guillotining, drowning, 
shooting without mercy, at the hazard of their fancy, they were 
raised from their former humble condition to the level of the 
most celebrated potentates. 
</p><p>Never did Nero or Heliogabalus surpass in tyranny the 
representatives of the Convention.  Laws and customs always 
restrained the former to a certain extent.  Nothing restrained 
the commissaries. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Fouch&eacute;,&rdquo; writes Taine, &ldquo;lorgnette in 
hand, watched the butchery of 210 inhabitants of Lyons from his 
window.  Collot, Laporte, and Fouch&eacute; feasted on days of 
execution (<hi rend="italic">fusillades</hi>), and at the sound of each discharge

sprang up with cries of joy, waving their hats.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Among the representatives &ldquo;on mission&rdquo; who exhibit

this murderous mentality we may cite as a type the ex-cur&eacute;

Lebon, who, having become possessed of supreme power, ravaged 
Arras and Cambrai .  His example, with that of Carrier, 
contributes to show what man can become when he escapes from the 
yoke of law and tradition.  The cruelty of the ferocious 
commissary was complicated by Sadism; the scaffold was raised 
under his windows, so that he, his wife, and his helpers could 
rejoice in the carnage.  At the foot of the guillotine a 
drinking-booth was established where the <hi rend="italic">sans-culottes</hi> 
could 
 
 
<pb n="236"/>  
come to drink.  To amuse them the executioner would group on the 
pavement, in ridiculous attitudes, the naked bodies of the 
decapitated. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The reading of the two volumes of his trial, printed 
at Amiens in 1795, may be counted as a nightmare.  During twenty 
sessions the survivors of the hecatombs of Arras and Cambrai 
passed through the ancient hall of the bailiwick at Amiens, where

the ex-member of the Convention was tried.  What these phantoms 
in mourning related is unheard of.  Entire streets dispeopled; 
nonagenarians and girls of sixteen decapitated after a mockery of

a trial; death buffeted, insulted, adorned, rejoiced in; 
executions to music; battalions of children recruited to 
guard the scaffold; the debauchery, the cynicism, the 
refinements of an insane satrap; a romance by Sade turned epic; 
it seems, as we watch the unpacking of these horrors, that 
a whole country, long terrorised, is at last disgorging 
its terror and revenging itself for its cowardice by 
overwhelming the wretch there, the scapegoat of an abhorred 
and vanished system.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The only defence of the ex-clergyman was that he had 
obeyed orders.  The facts with which he was reproached had long 
been known, and the Convention had in no wise blamed him for 
them. 
</p><p>I have already spoken of the vanity of the deputies 
&ldquo;on mission,&rdquo; who were suddenly endowed with a power 
greater than that of the most powerful despots; but this vanity 
is not enough to explain their ferocity. 
</p><p>That arose from other sources.  Apostles of a severe 
faith, the delegates of the Convention, like the inquisitors of 
the Holy Office, could feel, can have felt, no pity for their 
victims.  Freed, moreover, 
 
 
<pb n="237"/>  
from all the bonds of tradition and law, they could give rein to 
the most savage instincts that primitive animality has left in 
us. 
</p><p>Civilisation restrains these instincts, but they never 
die.  The need to kill which makes the hunter is a permanent 
proof of this.  M. Cunisset-Carnot has expressed in the following

lines the grip of this hereditary tendency, which, in the pursuit

of the most harmless game, re-awakens the barbarian in every 
hunter:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The pleasure of killing for killing's sake is, one 
may say, universal; it is the basis of the hunting instinct, for 
it must be admitted that at present, in civilised countries, the 
need to live no longer counts for anything in its propagation. 
In reality we are continuing an action which was imperiously 
imposed upon our savage ancestors by the harsh necessities of 
existence, during which they had either to kill or die of hunger,

while to-day there is no longer any legitimate excuse for it. 
But so it is, and we can do nothing; probably we shall never 
break the chains of a slavery which has bound us for so long.  We

cannot prevent ourselves from feeling an intense, often 
passionate, pleasure in shedding the blood of animals towards 
whom, when the love of the chase possesses us, we lose all 
feeling of pity.  The gentlest and prettiest creatures, the song-
birds, the charm of our springtime, fall to our guns or are 
choked in our snares, and not a shudder of pity troubles our 
pleasure at seeing them terrified, bleeding, writhing in the 
horrible suffering we inflict on them, seeking to flee on their 
poor broken paws or desperately beating their wings, which can no

longer support them. . . .  The 
 
 
<pb n="238"/>  
excuse is the impulse of that imperious atavism which the best of

us have not the strength to resist.&rdquo; 
</p><p>At ordinary times this singular atavism, restrained by 
fear of the laws, can only be exercised on animals.  When codes 
are no longer operative it immediately applies itself to man, 
which is why so many terrorists took an intense pleasure in 
killing.  Carrier's remark concerning the joy he felt in 
contemplating the faces of his victims during their torment is 
very typical.  In many civilised men ferocity is a restrained 
instinct, but it is by no means eliminated. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d101"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Danton and Robespierre</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Danton and Robespierre represented the two principal 
personages of the Revolution I shall say little of the former: 
his psychology, besides being simple, is familiar.  A club orator

firstly, impulsive and violent, he showed himself always ready to

excite the people.  Cruel only in his speeches, he often 
regretted their effects.  From the outset he shone in the first 
rank, while his future rival, Robespierre, was vegetating almost 
in the lowest. 
</p><p>At one given moment Danton became the soul of the 
Revolution, but he was deficient in tenacity and fixity of 
conduct.  Moreover, he was needy, while Robespierre was not.  The

continuous fanaticism of the latter defeated the intermittent 
efforts of the former.  Nevertheless, it was an amazing spectacle

to see so powerful a tribune sent to the scaffold by his pale, 
venemous enemy and mediocre rival. 
</p><p>Robespierre, the most influential man of the Revolution 
and the most frequently studied, is yet the least explicable.  It

is difficult to understand the 
 
 
<pb n="239"/>  
prodigious influence which gave him the power of life and death, 
not only over the enemies of the Revolution but also over 
colleagues who could not have been considered as enemies of the 
existing Government. 
</p><p>We certainly cannot explain the matter by saying with 
Taine that Robespierre was a pedant lost in abstractions, nor by 
asserting with the Michelet that he succeeded on account of his 
principles, nor by repeating with his contemporary Williams that 
&ldquo;one of the secrets of his government was to take men marked 
by opprobrium or soiled with crime as stepping-stones to his 
ambition.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It is impossible to regard his eloquence as the cause of 
his success.  His eyes protected by goggles, he painfully read 
his speeches, which were composed of cold and indefinite 
abstractions.  The Assembly contained orators who possessed an 
immensely superior talent, such as Danton and the Girondists; yet

it was Robespierre who destroyed them. 
</p><p>We have really no acceptable explanation of the ascendancy

which the dictator finally obtained.  Without influence in the 
National Assembly, he gradually became the master of the 
Convention and of the Jacobins.  &ldquo;When he reached the 
Committee of Public Safety he was already,&rdquo; said Billaud&mdash; 
Varennes, &ldquo;the most important person in France.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;His history,&rdquo; writes Michelet, &ldquo;is 
prodigious, far more marvellous than that of Bonaparte.  The 
threads, the wheels, the preparation of forces, are far less 
visible.  It is an honest man, an austere but pious figure, of 
middling talents, that shoots up one morning, borne upward by I 
know not what cataclysm.  There is nothing like it in the 
<hi rend="italic">Arabian</hi> 
 
 
<pb n="240"/>  
<hi rend="italic">Nights</hi>.  And in a moment he goes higher than the throne. 
He is set upon the altar.  Astonishing story!&rdquo; 
</p><p>Certainly circumstances helped him considerably.  People 
turned to him as to the master of whom all felt the need.  But 
then he was already there, and what we wish to discover is the 
cause of his rapid ascent.  I would willingly suppose in him the 
existence of a species of personal fascination which escapes us 
to-day.  His successes with women might be quoted in support of 
this theory.  On the days when he speaks &ldquo;the passages are 
choked with women . . . there are seven or eight hundred in the 
tribunes, and with what transports they applaud!  At the 
Jacobins, when he speaks there are sobs and cries of emotion, and

men stamp as though they would bring the hall down.&rdquo;  A young

widow, Mme. de Chalabre, possessed of sixteen hundred pounds a 
year, sends him burning love-letters and is eager to marry him. 
</p><p>We cannot seek in his character for the causes of his 
popularity.  A hypochondriac by temperament, of mediocre 
intelligence, incapable of grasping realities, confined to 
abstractions, crafty and dissimulating, his prevailing note was 
an excessive pride which increased until his last day.  High 
priest of a new faith, he believed himself sent on earth by God 
to establish the reign of virtue.  He received writings stating 
&ldquo;that he was the Messiah whom the Eternal Being had promised 
to reform the world.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Full of literary pretensions, he laboriously polished his 
speeches.  His profound jealousy of other orators or men of 
letters, such as Camille Desmoulins, caused their death. 
 
 
<pb n="241"/>  
 
</p><p>&ldquo;Those who were particularly the objects of the 
tyrant's rage,&rdquo; writes the author already cited, &ldquo;were 
the men of letters.  With regard to them the jealousy of a 
colleague was mingled with the fury of the oppressor; for the 
hatred with which he persecuted them was caused less by their 
resistance to his despotism than by their talents, which eclipsed

his.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The contempt of the dictator for his colleagues was 
immense and almost unconcealed.  Giving audience to Barras at the

hour of his toilet, he finished shaving, spitting in the 
direction of his colleague as though he did not exist, and 
disdaining to reply to his questions. 
</p><p>He regarded the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> and the deputies with 
the same hateful disdain.  Only the multitude found grace in his 
eyes.  &ldquo;When the sovereign people exercises its power,&rdquo; 
he said, &ldquo;we can only bow before it.  In all it does all is 
virtue and truth, and no excess, error, or crime is 
possible.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Robespierre suffered from the persecution mania.  That he 
had others' heads cut off was not only because he had a mission 
as an apostle, but because he believed himself hemmed in by 
enemies and conspirators.  &ldquo;Great as was the cowardice of his

colleagues where he was concerned,&rdquo; writes M. Sorel, &ldquo;the

fear he had of them was still greater.&rdquo; 
</p><p>His dictatorship, absolute during five months, is a 
striking example of the power of certain leaders.  We can 
understand that a tyrant backed by an army can easily destroy 
whom he pleases, but that a single man should succeed in sending 
to death a large number of his equals is a thing that is not 
easily explained. 
 
 
<pb n="242"/>  
 
</p><p>The power of Robespierre was so absolute that he was able 
to send to the Tribunal, and therefore to the scaffold, the most 
eminent deputies: Desmoulins, H&eacute;bert, Danton, and many 
another.  The brilliant Girondists melted away before him.  He 
attacked even the terrible Commune, guillotined its leaders, and 
replaced it by a new Commune obedient to his orders. 
</p><p>In order to rid himself more quickly of the men who 
displeased him he induced the Convention to enact the law of 
Prairial, which permitted the execution of mere suspects, and by 
means of which he had 1,373 heads cut off in Paris in forty-nine 
days.  His colleagues, the victims of an insane terror, no longer

slept at home; scarcely a hundred deputies were present at 
sessions.  David said:  &ldquo;I do not believe twenty of us 
members of the Mountain will be left.&rdquo; 
</p><p>It was his very excess of confidence in his own powers and

in the cowardice of the Convention that lost Robespierre his 
life.  Having attempted to make them vote a measure which would 
permit deputies to be sent before the Revolutionary Tribunal, 
which meant the scaffold, without the authorisation of the 
Assembly, on an order from the governing Committee, several 
Montagnards conspired with some members of the Plain to overthrow

him.  Tallien, knowing himself marked down for early execution, 
and having therefore nothing to lose, accused him loudly of 
tyranny.  Robespierre wished to defend himself by reading a 
speech which he had long had in hand, but he learned to his cost 
that although it is possible to destroy men in the name of logic 
it is not possible to 
 
 
<pb n="243"/>  
lead an assembly by means of logic.  The shouts of the 
conspirators drowned his voice; the cry &ldquo;Down with the 
tyrant!&rdquo; quickly repeated, thanks to mental contagion, by 
many of the members present, was enough to complete his downfall.

Without losing a moment the Assembly decreed his accusation. 
</p><p>The Commune having wished to save him, the Assembly 
outlawed him.  Struck by this magic formula, he was definitely 
lost. 
</p><p>&ldquo;This cry of outlawry,&rdquo; writes Williams, &ldquo;at 
this period produced the same effect on a Frenchman as the cry of

pestilence; the outlaw became civilly excommunicated, and it was 
as though men believed that they would be contaminated passing 
through the air which he had breathed.  Such was the effect it 
produced upon the gunners who had trained their cannon against 
the Convention.  Without receiving further orders, merely on 
hearing that the Commune was `outside the law,' they immediately 
turned their batteries about.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Robespierre and all his band&mdash;Saint-Just, the president of

the Revolutionary Tribunal, the mayor of the Commune, &amp;c.,&mdash;were 
guillotined on the 10th of Thermidor to the number of twenty-one.

Their execution was followed on the morrow by a fresh batch of 
seventy Jacobins, and on the next day by thirteen.  The Terror, 
which had lasted ten months, was at an end. 
</p><p>The downfall of the Jacobin edifice in Thermidor is one of

the most curious psychological events of the revolutionary 
period.  None of the Montagnards who had worked for the downfall 
of Robespierre had for a moment dreamed that it would mark the 
end of the Terror. 
 
 
<pb n="244"/>  
 
</p><p>Tallien, Barras, Fouch&eacute;, &amp;c., overthrew Robespierre

as he had overthrown H&eacute;bert, Danton, the Girondists, and 
many others.  But when the acclamations of the crowd told them 
that the death of Robespierre was regarded as having put an end 
to the Terror they acted as though such had been their intention.

They were the more obliged to do so in that the Plain&mdash;that is, 
the great majority of the Assembly&mdash;which had allowed itself to 
be decimated by Robespierre, now rebelled furiously against the 
system it had so long acclaimed even while it abhorred it. 
Nothing is more terrible than a body of men who have been afraid 
and are afraid no longer.  The Plain revenged itself for being 
terrorised by the Mountain, and terrorised that body in turn. 
</p><p>The servility of the colleagues of Robespierre in the 
Convention was by no means based upon any feeling of sympathy for

him.  The dictator filled them with an unspeakable alarm, but 
beneath the marks of admiration and enthusiasm which they 
lavished on him out of fear was concealed an intense hatred.  We 
can gather as much by reading the reports of various deputies 
inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> of August 11, 15, and 29, 1794, 
and notably that on &ldquo;the conspiracy of the triumvirs, 
Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just.&rdquo;  Never did slaves heap

such invectives on a fallen master. 
</p><p>We learn that &ldquo;these monsters had for some time been 
renewing the most horrible prescriptions of Marius and 
Sulla.&rdquo;  Robespierre is represented as a most frightful 
scoundrel; we are assured that &ldquo;like Caligula, he would soon 
have asked the French people to worship his horse . . .  He 
sought security 
 
 
<pb n="245"/>  
in the execution of all who aroused his slightest suspicion. 
</p><p>These reports forget to add that the power of Robespierre 
obtained no support, as did that of the Marius and Sulla to whom 
they allude, from a powerful army, but merely from the repeated 
adhesion of the members of the Convention.  Without their extreme

timidity the power of the dictator could not have lasted a single

day. 
</p><p>Robespierre was one of the most odious tyrants of history,

but he is distinguished from all others in that he made himself a

tyrant without soldiers. 
</p><p>We may sum up his doctrines by saying that he was the most

perfect incarnation, save perhaps Saint-Just, of the Jacobin 
faith, in all its narrow logic, its intense mysticism, and its 
inflexible rigidity.  He has admirers even to-day.  M. Hamel 
describes him as &ldquo;the martyr of Thermidor.&rdquo;  There has 
been some talk of erecting a monument to him.  I would willingly 
subscribe to such a purpose, feeling that it is useful to 
preserve proofs of the blindness of the crowd, and of the 
extraordinary docility of which an assembly is capable when the 
leader knows how to handle it.  His statue would recall the 
passionate cries of admiration and enthusiasm with which the 
Convention acclaimed the most threatening measures of the 
dictator, on the very eve of the day when it was about to cast 
him down.

<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">Fouquier-Tinville, Marat, Billaud-Varenne, 
&amp;c</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>I shall devote a paragraph to certain revolutionists who were 
famous for the development of their most sanguinary instincts. 
Their ferocity was complicated 
 
 
<pb n="246"/>  
by other sentiments, by fear and hatred, which could but fortify 
it. 
</p><p>Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor of the 
Revolutionary Tribunal, was one of those who have left the most 
sinister memories.  This magistrate, formerly reputed for his 
kindness, and who became the bloodthirsty creature whose memory 
evokes such repulsion, has already served me as an example in 
other works, when I have wished to show the transformation of 
certain natures in time of revolution. 
</p><p>Needy in the extreme at the moment of the fall of the 
monarchy, he had everything to hope from a social upheaval and 
nothing to lose.  He was one of those men whom a period of 
disorder will always find ready to sustain it. 
</p><p>The Convention abandoned its powers to him.  He had to 
pronounce upon the fate of nearly two thousand accused, among 
whom were Marie-Antoinette, the Girondists, Danton, 
H&eacute;bert, &amp;c.  He had all the suspects brought before him 
executed, and did not scruple to betray his former protectors. 
As soon as one of them fell into his power&mdash;Camille Desmoulins, 
Danton, or another&mdash;he would plead against him. 
</p><p>Fouquier-Tinville had a very inferior mind, which the 
Revolution brought to the top.  Under normal conditions, hedged 
about by professional rules, his destiny would have been that of 
a peaceable and obscure magistrate.  This was precisely the lot 
of his deputy, or substitute, at the Tribunal, Gilbert-Liendon. 
&ldquo;He should,&rdquo; writes M. Durel, &ldquo;have inspired the same

horror as his colleague, yet he completed his career in the upper

ranks of the Imperial magistracy.&rdquo; 
 
 
<pb n="247"/>  
 
</p><p>One of the great benefits of an organised society is that 
it does restrain these dangerous characters, whom nothing but 
social restraints can hold. 
</p><p>Fouquier-Tinville died without understanding why he was 
condemned, and from the revolutionary point of view his 
condemnation was not justifiable.  Had he not merely zealously 
executed the orders of his superiors?  It is impossible to class 
him with the representatives who were sent into the provinces, 
who could not be supervised.  The delegates of the Convention 
examined all his sentences and approved of them up to the last. 
If his cruelty and his summary fashion of trying the prisoners 
before him had not been encouraged by his chiefs, he could not 
have remained in power.  In condemning Fouquier-Tinville, the 
Convention condemned its own frightful system of government.  It 
understood this fact, and sent to the scaffold a number of 
Terrorists whom Fouquier-Tinville had merely served as a faithful

agent. 
</p><p>Beside Fouquier-Tinville we may set Dumas, who presided 
over the Revolutionary Tribunal, and who also displayed an 
excessive cruelty, which was whetted by an intense fear.  He 
never went out without two loaded pistols, barricaded himself in 
his house, and only spoke to visitors through a wicket.  His 
distrust of everybody, including his own wife, was absolute.  He 
even imprisoned the latter, and was about to have her executed 
when Thermidor arrived. 
</p><p>Among the men whom the Convention brought to light, 
Billaud-Varenne was one of the wildest and, most brutal.  He may 
be regarded as a perfect type of bestial ferocity. 
</p><p>&ldquo;In these hours of fruitful anger and heroic anguish 
 
 
<pb n="248"/>  
he remained calm, acquitting himself methodically of his task&mdash; 
and it was a frightful task: he appeared officially at the 
massacres of the Abbaye, congratulated the assassins, and 
promised them money; upon which he went home as if he had merely 
been taking a walk.  We see him as president of the Jacobin Club,

president of the Convention, and member of the Committee of 
Public Safety; he drags the Girondists to the scaffold: he drags 
the queen thither, and his former patron, Danton, said of him, 
`Billaud has a dagger under his tongue.'  He approves of the 
cannonades at Lyons, the drownings at Nantes, the massacres at 
Arras; he organises the pitiless commission of Orange; he is 
concerned in the laws of Prairial; he eggs on Fouquier-Tinville; 
on all decrees of death is his name, often the first; he signs 
before his colleagues; he is without pity, without emotion, 
without enthusiasm; when others are frightened, hesitate, and 
draw back, he goes his way, speaking in turgid sentences, 
`shaking his lion's mane'&mdash;for to make his cold and impassive 
face more in harmony with the exuberance that surrounds him he 
now decks himself in a yellow wig which would make one laugh were

it on any but the sinister head of Billaud-Varenne.  When 
Robespierre, Saint-Just, and Couthon are threatened in turn, he 
deserts them and goes over to the enemy, and pushes them under 
the knife. . . .  Why?  What is his aim?  No one knows; he is not

in any way ambitious; he desires neither power nor money.&rdquo; 
</p><p>I do not think it would be difficult to answer why.  The 
thirst for blood, of which we have already spoken, and which is 
very common among certain criminals, 
 
 
<pb n="249"/>  
perfectly explains the conduct of Billaud-Varennes.  Bandits of 
this type kill for the sake of killing, as sportsmen shoot game&mdash;

for the very pleasure of exercising their taste for destruction. 
In ordinary times men endowed with these homicidal tendencies 
refrain, generally from fear of the policeman and the scaffold. 
When they are able to give them free vent nothing can stop them. 
Such was the case with Billaud-Varenne and many others. 
</p><p>The psychology of Marat is rather more complicated, not 
only because his craving for murder was combined with other 
elements&mdash;wounded self-love, ambition, mystic beliefs, &amp;c.&mdash;but 
also because we must regard him as a semi-lunatic, affected by 
megalomania, and haunted by fixed ideas. 
</p><p>Before the Revolution he had advanced great scientific 
pretensions, but no one attached much importance to his 
maunderings.  Dreaming of place and honour, he had only obtained 
a very subordinate situation in the household of a great noble. 
The Revolution opened up an unhoped-for future.  Swollen with 
hatred of the old social system which had not recognised his 
merits, he put himself at the head of the most violent section of

the people.  Having publicly glorified the massacres of 
September, he founded a journal which denounced everybody and 
clamoured incessantly for executions. 
</p><p>Speaking continually of the interests of the people, Marat

became their idol.  The majority of his colleagues heartily 
despised him.  Had he escaped the knife of Charlotte Corday, he 
certainly would not have escaped that of the guillotine. 
 
 
<pb n="250"/>  
 
 
 
5.  <hi rend="italic">The Destiny of those Members of the Convention who 
survived the Revolution</hi>. 
 
</p><p>Beside the members of the Convention whose psychology 
presents particular characteristics there were others&mdash;Barras, 
Fouch&eacute;, Tallien, Merlin de Thionville, &amp;c.&mdash;completely 
devoid of principles or belief, who only sought to enrich 
themselves. 
</p><p>They sought to build up enormous fortunes out of the 
public misery.  In ordinary times they would have been qualified 
as simple scoundrels, but in perods of revolution all 
standards of vice and virtue seem to disappear. 
</p><p>Although a few Jacobins remained fanatics, the majority 
renounced their convictions as soon as they had obtained riches, 
and became the faithful courtiers of Napoleon. 
Cambac&eacute;r&egrave;s, who, on addressing Louis XVI. in 
prison, called him Louis Capet, under the Empire required his 
friends to call him &ldquo;Highness&rdquo; in public and 
&ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo; in private, thus displaying the envious 
feeling which accompanied the craving for equality in many of the

Jacobins. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The majority of the Jacobins,&rdquo; writes M. Madelin 
&ldquo;were greatly enriched, and like Chabot, Bazire, Merlin, 
Barras, Boursault, Tallien, Barr&egrave;re, &amp;c., possessed 
<hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi> and estates.  Those who were not wealthy as

yet were soon to become so. . .  In the Committee of the year 
III. alone the staff of the Thermidorian party comprised a future

prince, 13 future counts, 5 future barons, 7 future senators of 
the Empire, and 6 future Councillors of State, and beside them in

the Convention there were, between the future Duke of Otranto to 
the future Count Regnault, no less than 
 
 
<pb n="251"/>  
50 democrats who fifteen years later possessed titles, coats of 
arms, plumes, carriages, endowments, entailed estates, hotels, 
and <hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi>.  Fouch&eacute; died worth 
&pound;600,000.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The privileges of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> which 
had been so bitterly decried were thus very soon re-established 
for the benefit of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.  To arrive at this 
result it was necessary to ruin France, to burn entire provinces,

to multiply suffering, to plunge innumerable families into 
despair, to overturn Europe, and to destroy men by the hundred 
thousand on the field of battle. 
</p><p>In closing this chapter we will recall what we have 
already said concerning the possibility of judging the men of 
this period. 
</p><p>Although the moralist is forced to deal severely with 
certain individuals, because he judges them by the types which 
society must respect if it is to succeed in maintaining itself, 
the psychologist is not in the same case.  His aim is to 
understand, and criticism vanishes before a complete 
comprehension. 
</p><p>The human mind is a very fragile mechanism, and the 
marionettes which dance upon the stage of history are rarely able

to resist the imperious forces which impel them.  Heredity, 
environment, and circumstances are imperious masters.  No one can

say with certainty what would have been his conduct in the place 
of the men whose actions he endeavours to interpret.

<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Psychology of the Directory</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>AS the various revolutionary assemblies were composed in part 
of the same men, one might suppose that their psychology would be

very similar. 
</p><p>At ordinary periods this would have been so, for a 
constant environment means constancy of character.  But when 
circumstances change as rapidly as they did under the Revolution,

character must perforce transform itself to adapt itself thereto.

Such was the case with the Directory. 
</p><p>The Directory comprised several distinct assemblies: two 
large chambers, consisting of different categories of deputies, 
and one very small chamber, which consisted of the five 
Directors. 
</p><p>The two larger Assemblies remind one strongly of the 
Convention by their weakness.  They were no longer forced to obey

popular riots, as these were energetically prevented by the 
Directors, but 
 
 
<pb n="253"/>  
they yielded without discussion to the dictatorial injunctions of

the latter. 
</p><p>The first deputies to be elected were mostly moderates. 
Everyone was weary of the Jacobin tyranny.  The new Assembly 
dreamed of rebuilding the ruins with which France was covered, 
and establishing a liberal government without violence. 
</p><p>But by one of those fatalities which were a law of the 
Revolution, and which prove that the course of events is often 
superior to men's wills, these deputies, like their predecessors,

may be said always to have done the contrary of what they wished 
to do.  They hoped to be moderate, and they were violent; they 
wanted to eliminate the influence of the Jacobins, and they 
allowed themselves to be led by them; they thought to repair the 
ruins of the country and they succeeded only in adding others to 
them; they aspired to religious peace, and they finally 
persecuted and massacred the priests with greater rigour than 
during the Terror. 
</p><p>The psychology of the little assembly formed by the five 
Directors was very different from that of the Chamber of 
Deputies.  Encountering fresh difficulties daily, the directors 
were forced to resolve them, while the large Assemblies, without 
contact with realities, had only their aspirations. 
</p><p>The prevailing thought of the Directors was very simple. 
Highly indifferent to principles, they wished above all to remain

the masters of France.  To attain that result they did not shrink

from resorting to the most illegitimate measures, even annulling 
the elections of a great number of the departments when these 
embarrassed them. 
 
 
<pb n="254"/>  
 
</p><p>Feeling themselves incapable of reorganising France, they 
left her to herself.  By their despotism they contrived to 
dominate her, but they never governed her.  Now, what France 
needed more than anything at this juncture was to be governed. 
</p><p>The convention has left behind it the reputation of a 
strong Government, and the Directory that of a weak Government. 
The contrary is true: it was the Directory that was the strong 
Government. 
</p><p>Psychologically we may readily explain the difference 
between the Government of the Directory and that of the preceding

Assemblies by recalling the fact that a gathering of six hundred 
to seven hundred persons may well suffer from waves of contagious

enthusiasm, as on the night of the 4th of August, or even 
impulses of energetic will-power, such as that which launched 
defiance against the kings of Europe.  But such impulses are too 
ephemeral to possess any great force.  A committee of five 
members, easily dominated by the will of one, is far more 
susceptible of continuous resolution&mdash;that is, of perseverance in

a settled line of conduct. 
</p><p>The Government of the Directory proved to be always 
incapable of governing, but it never lacked a strong will. 
Nothing restraining it, neither respect for law nor consideration

for the citizens, nor love of the public welfare, it was able to 
impose upon France a despotism more crushing than that of any 
Government since the beginning of the Revolution, not excepting 
the Terror. 
</p><p>Although it utilised methods analogous to those of the 
Convention, and ruled France in the most tyrannical manner, the 
Directory, no more than the Convention, was never the master of 
France. 
 
 
<pb n="255"/>  
 
</p><p>This fact, which I have already noted, proves once more 
the impotence of material constraint to dominate moral forces. 
It cannot be too often repeated that the true guide of mankind is

the moral scaffolding erected by his ancestors. 
</p><p>Accustomed to live in an organised society, supported by 
codes and respected traditions, we can with difficulty represent 
to ourselves the condition of a nation deprived of such a basis. 
As a general thing we only see the irksome side of our 
environment, too readily forgetting that society can exist only 
on condition of imposing certain restraints, and that laws, 
manners, and custom constitute a check upon the natural instincts

of barbarism which never entirely perishes. 
</p><p>The history of the Convention and the Directory which 
followed it shows plainly to what degree disorder may overcome a 
nation deprived of its ancient structure, and having for guide 
only the artificial combinations of an insufficient reason.

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Despotic Government of the Directory.  Recrudescence

of the Terror</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>With the object of diverting attention, occupying the army, 
and obtaining resources by the pillage of neighbouring countries,

the Directors decided to resume the wars of conquest which had 
succeeded under the Convention. 
</p><p>These continued during the life time of the Directory. 
The armies won a rich booty, especially in Italy. 
</p><p>Some of the invaded populations were so simple as to 
suppose that these invasions were undertaken in their interest. 
They were not long in discovering 
 
 
<pb n="256"/>  
that all military operations were accompanied by crushing taxes 
and the pillage of churches, public treasuries, &amp;c. 
</p><p>The final consequence of this policy of conquest was the 
formation of a new coalition against France, which lasted until 
1801. 
</p><p>Indifferent to the state of the country and incapable of 
reorganising it, the Directors were principally concerned in 
struggling against an incessant series of conspiracies in order 
to keep in power. 
</p><p>This task was enough to occupy their leisure, for the 
political parties had not disarmed.  Anarchy had reached such a 
point that all were calling for a hand powerful enough to restore

order.  Everyone felt, the Directors included, that the 
republican system could not last much longer. 
</p><p>Some dreamed of re-establishing royalty, others the 
Terrorist system, while others waited for a general.  Only the 
purchasers of the national property feared a change of 
Government. 
</p><p>The unpopularity of the Directory increased daily, and 
when in May, 1797, the third part of the Assembly had to be 
renewed, the majority of those elected were hostile to the 
system. 
</p><p>The Directors were not embarrassed by a little thing like 
that.  They annulled the elections in 49 departments; 154 of the 
new deputies were invalidated and expelled, 53 condemned to 
deportation.  Among these latter figured the most illustrious 
names of the Revolution:  Portalis, Carnot, Tronson du Coudray, 
&amp;c. 
</p><p>To intimidate the electors, military commissions condemned

to death, rather at random, 160 persons, and sent to Guiana 330, 
of whom half speedily died. 
 
 
<pb n="257"/>  
The <hi rend="italic">emigr&eacute;s</hi> and priests who had returned to France 
were violently expelled.  This was known as the <hi rend="italic">coup 
d'&Eacute;tat</hi> of Fructidor. 
</p><p>This <hi rend="italic">coup</hi>, which struck more especially at the 
moderates, was not the only one of its kind; another quickly 
followed.  The Directors, finding the Jacobin deputies too 
numerous, annulled the elections of sixty of them. 
</p><p>The preceding facts displayed the tyrannical temper of the

Directors, but this appeared even more plainly in the details of 
their measures.  The new masters of France also proved to be as 
bloodthirsty as the most ferocious deputies of the Terror. 
</p><p>The guillotine was not re-established as a permanency, but

replaced by deportation under conditions which left the victims 
little chance of survival.  Sent to Rochefort in cages of iron 
bars, exposed to all the severities of the weather, they were 
then packed into boats. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Between the decks of the <hi rend="italic">D&eacute;cade</hi> and the

<hi rend="italic">Bayonnaise</hi>,&rdquo; says Taine, &ldquo;the miserable prisoners,

suffocated by the lack of air and the torrid heat, bullied and 
fleeced, died of hunger or asphyxia, and Guiana completed the 
work of the voyage: of 193 taken thither by the 
<hi rend="italic">D&eacute;cade</hi> 39 were left alive at the end of twenty-two 
months; of 120 taken by the <hi rend="italic">Bayonnaise</hi> 1 remained. 
</p><p>Observing everywhere a Catholic renascence, and imagining 
that the clergy were conspiring against them, the Directors 
deported or sent to the galleys in one year 1,448 priests, to say

nothing of a large number who were summarily executed.  The 
Terror was in reality completely re-established. 
 
 
<pb n="258"/>  
 
</p><p>The autocratic despotism of the Directory was exercised in

all the branches of the administration, notably the finances. 
Thus, having need of six hundred million francs, it forced the 
deputies, always docile, to vote a progressive impost, which 
yielded, however, only twelve millions.  Being presently in the 
same condition, it decreed a forced loan of a hundred millions, 
which resulted in the closing of workshops, the stoppage of 
business, and the dismissal of domestics.  It was only at the 
price of absolute ruin that forty millions could be obtained. 
</p><p>To assure itself of domination in the provinces the 
Directory caused a so-called law of hostages to be passed, 
according to which a list of hostages, responsible for all 
offences, was drawn up in each commune. 
</p><p>It is easy to understand what hatred such a system 
provoked.  At the end of 1799 fourteen departments were in revolt

and forty-six were ready to rise.  If the Directory had lasted 
the dissolution of society would have been complete. 
</p><p>For that matter, this dissolution was far advanced. 
Finances, administration, everything was crumbling.  The receipts

of the Treasury, consisting of depreciated <hi rend="italic">assignats</hi> 
fallen to a hundredth part of their original value, were 
negligible.  Holders of Government stock and officers could no 
longer obtain payment. 
</p><p>France at this time gave travellers the impression of a 
country ravaged by war and abandoned by its inhabitants.  The 
broken bridges and dykes and ruined buildings made all traffic 
impossible.  The roads, long deserted, were infested by brigands.

Certain departments could only be crossed at the price of buying 
a safe-conduct from the leaders of 
 
 
<pb n="259"/>  
these bands.  Industry and commerce were annihilated.  In Lyons 
13,000 workshops and mills out of 15,000 had been forced to 
close.  Lille, Havre, Bordeaux, Lyons, Marseilles, &amp;c., were like

dead cities.  Poverty and famine were general. 
</p><p>The moral disorganisation was no less terrible.  Luxury 
and the craving for pleasure, costly dinners, jewels, and 
extravagant households were the appanage of a new society 
composed entirely of stock-jobbers, army contractors, and shady 
financiers enriched by pillage.  They gave Paris that superficial

aspect of luxury and gaiety which has deluded so many historians 
of this period, because the insolent prodigality displayed 
covered the general misery. 
</p><p>The chronicles of the Directory as told in books help to 
show us of what lies the web of history is woven.  The theatre 
has lately got hold of this period, of which the fashions are 
still imitated.  It has left the memory of a joyous period of 
rebirth after the gloomy drama of the Terror.  In reality the 
drama of the Directory was hardly an improvement on the Terror 
and was quite as sanguinary.  Finally, it inspired such loathing 
that the Directors, feeling that it could not last, sought 
themselves for the dictator capable of replacing it and also of 
protecting them.

<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Advent of Bonaparte</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>We have seen that at the end of the Directory the anarchy and 
disorganisation were such that every one was desperately calling 
for the man of energy capable of re-establishing order.  As early

as 1795 a number of deputies had thought for a moment of re-establishing royalty.  Louis XVIII., having been tactless 
 
 
<pb n="260"/>  
enough to declare that he would restore the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi> in its entirety, return all property to its 
original owners, and punish the men of the Revolution, was 
immediately thrown over.  The senseless expedition of Quiberon 
finally alienated the supporters of the future sovereign.  The 
royalists gave a proof during the whole of the Revolution of an 
incapacity and a narrowness of mind which justified most of the 
measures taken against them. 
</p><p>The monarchy being impossible, it was necessary to find a 
general.  Only one existed whose name carried weight&mdash;Bonaparte. 
The campaign in Italy had just made him famous.  Having crossed 
the Alps, he had marched from victory to victory, penetrated to 
Milan and Venice, and everywhere obtained important war 
contributions.  He then made towards Vienna, and was only twenty-
five leagues from its gates when the Emperor of Austria decided 
to sue for peace. 
</p><p>But great as was his renown, the young general did not 
consider it sufficient.  To increase it he persuaded the 
Directory that the power of England could be shaken by an 
invasion of Egypt, and in May, 1798, he embarked at Toulon. 
</p><p>This need of increasing his prestige arose from a very 
sound psychological conception which he clearly expounded at St. 
Helena:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The most influential and enlightened generals had 
long been pressing the general of Italy to take steps to place 
himself at the head of the Republic.  He refused; he was not yet 
strong enough to walk quite alone.  He had ideas upon the art of 
governing and upon what was necessary to a great nation which 
 
 
<pb n="261"/>  
were so different from those of the men of the Revolution and the

assemblies that, not being able to act alone, he feared to 
compromise his character.  He determined to set out for Egypt, 
but resolved to reappear if circumstances should arise to render 
his presence useful or necessary.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Bonaparte did not stay long in Egypt.  Recalled by his 
friends, he landed at Frejus, and the announcement of his return 
provoked universal enthusiasm.  There were illuminations 
everywhere.  France collaborated in advance in the <hi rend="italic">coup 
d'&Eacute;tat</hi> prepared by two Directors and the principal 
ministers.  The plot was organised in three weeks.  Its execution

on the 18th of Brumaire was accomplished with the greatest ease. 
</p><p>All parties experienced the greatest delight at being rid 
of the sinister gangs who had so long oppressed and exploited the

country.  The French were doubtless about to enter upon a 
despotic system of government, but it could not be so intolerable

as that which had been endured for so many years. 
</p><p>The history of the <hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi> of Brumaire 
justifies all that we have already said of the impossibility of 
forming exact judgments of events which apparently are fully 
understood and attested by no matter how many witnesses. 
</p><p>We know what ideas people had thirty years ago concerning 
the <hi rend="italic">coup</hi> of Brumaire.  It was regarded as a crime 
committed by the ambition of a man who was supported by his army.

As a matter of fact the army played no part whatever in the 
affair.  The little body of men who expelled the few recalcitrant

deputies were not soldiers even, but the gendarmes of the 
Assembly itself.  The true author of the <hi rend="italic">coup 
d'&Eacute;tat</hi> 
 
 
 
<pb n="262"/>  
was the Government itself, with the complicity of all France. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d108"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">Causes of the Duration of the Revolution</hi>.</head>

 
<p>If we limit the Revolution to the time necessary for the 
conquest of its fundamental principles&mdash;equality before the law, 
free access to public functions, popular sovereignty, control of 
expenditures, &amp;c.&mdash;we may say that it lasted only a few months. 
Towards the middle of 1789 all this was accomplished, and during 
the years that followed nothing was added to it, yet the 
Revolution lasted much longer. 
</p><p>Confining the duration to the dates admitted by the 
official historians, we see it persisting until the advent of 
Bonaparte, a space of some ten years. 
</p><p>Why did this period of disorganisation and violence follow

the establishment of the new principles?  We need not seek the 
cause in the foreign war, which might on several occasions have 
been terminated, thanks to the divisions of the allies and the 
constant victories of the French; neither must we look for it in 
the sympathy of Frenchmen for the revolutionary Government. 
Never was rule more cordially hated and despised than that of the

Assemblies.  By its revolts as well as by its repeated votes a 
great part of the nation displayed the horror with which it 
regarded the system. 
</p><p>This last point, the aversion of France for the 
revolutionary <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, so long misunderstood, has 
been well displayed by recent historians.  The author of the last

book published on the Revolution, M. Madelin, has well summarised

their opinion in the following words:&mdash; 
 
 
<pb n="263"/>  
 
</p><p>&ldquo;As early as 1793 a party by no means numerous had 
seized upon France, the Revolution, and the Republic.  Now, 
three-quarters of France longed for the Revolution to be checked,

or rather delivered from its odious exploiters; but these held 
the unhappy country by a thousand means. . . .  As the Terror was

essential to them if they were to rule, they struck at whomsoever

seemed at any given moment to be opposed to the Terror, were they

the best servants of the Revolution.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Up to the end of the Directory the government was 
exercised by Jacobins, who merely desired to retain, along with 
the supreme power, the riches they had accumulated by murder and 
pillage, and were ready to surrender France to any one who would 
guarantee them free possession of these.  That they negotiated 
the <hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi> of Brumaire with Napoleon was 
simply to the fact that they had not been able to realise their 
wishes with regard to Louis XVIII. 
</p><p>But how explain the fact that a Government so tyrannical 
and so dishonoured was able to survive for so many years? 
</p><p>It was not merely because the revolutionary religion still

survived in men's minds, nor because it was forced on them by 
means of persecution and bloodshed, but especially, as I have 
already stated, on account of the great interest which a large 
portion of the population had in maintaining it. 
</p><p>This point is fundamental.  If the Revolution had remained

a theoretical religion, it would probably have been of short 
duration.  But the belief which had just been founded very 
quickly emerged from the domain of pure theory. 
 
 
<pb n="264"/>  
 
</p><p>The Revolution did not confine itself to despoiling the 
monarchy, the nobility, and the clergy of their powers of 
government.  In throwing into the hands of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>

and the large numbers of peasantry the wealth and the employments

of the old privileged classes it had at the same stroke turned 
them into obstinate supporters of the revolutionary system.  All 
those who had acquired the property of which the nobles and 
clergy had been despoiled had obtained lands and 
<hi rend="italic">ch&acirc;teaux</hi> at low prices, and were terrified lest the 
restoration of the monarchy should force them to make general 
restitution. 
</p><p>It was largely for these reasons that a Government which, 
at any normal period, would never have been endured, was able to 
survive until a master should re-establish order, while promising

to maintain not only the moral but also the material conquests of

the Revolution.  Bonaparte realised these anxieties, and was 
promptly and enthusiastically welcomed.  Material conquests which

were still contestable and theoretical principles which were 
still fragile were by him incorporated in institutions and the 
laws.  It is an error to say that the Revolution terminated with 
his advent.  Far from destroying it, he ratified and consolidated

it.

THE RESTORATION OF ORDER.  THE CONSULAR REPUBLIC 
</head> 
 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d110"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">How the Work of the Revolution was Confirmed by the 
Consulate</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>THE history of the Consulate is as rich as the preceding 
period in psychological material.  In the first place it shows us

that the work of a powerful individual is superior to that of a 
collectivity.  Bonaparte immediately replaced the bloody anarchy 
in which the Republic had for ten years been writhing by a period

of order.  That which none of the four Assemblies of the 
Revolution had been able to realise, despite the most violent 
oppression, a single man accomplished in a very short space of 
time. 
</p><p>His authority immediately put an end to all the Parisian 
insurrections and the attempts at monarchical resistance, and re-
established the moral unity of France, so profoundly divided by 
intense hatreds.  Bonaparte replaced an unorganised collective 
despotism by a perfectly organised individual despotism. 
Everyone gained thereby, for his tyranny was infinitely less 
heavy than that which had been endured for ten long years.  We 
must suppose, moreover, that it was unwelcome to very few, as it 
was very soon accepted with immense enthusiasm. 
 
 
<pb n="266"/>  
 
</p><p>We know better to-day than to repeat with the old 
historians that Bonaparte overthrew the Republic.  On the 
contrary, he retained of it all that could be retained, and never

would have been retained without him, by establishing all the 
practicable work of the Revolution&mdash;the abolition of privileges, 
equality before the law, &amp;c.&mdash;in institutions and codes of law. 
The Consular Government continued, moreover, to call itself the 
Republic. 
</p><p>It is infinitely probable that without the Consulate a 
monarchical restoration would have terminated the Directory, and 
would have wiped out the greater part of the work of the 
Revolution.  Let us suppose Bonaparte erased from history.  No 
one, I think, will imagine that the Directory could have survived

the universal weariness of its rule.  It would certainly have 
been overturned by the royalist conspiracies which were breaking 
out daily, and Louis XVIII. would probably have ascended the 
throne.  Certainly he was to mount it sixteen years later, but 
during this interval Bonaparte gave such force to the principles 
of the Revolution, by establishing them in laws and customs, that

the restored sovereign dared not touch them, nor restore the 
property of the returned <hi rend="italic">emigr&eacute;s</hi>. 
</p><p>Matters would have been very different had Louis XVIII. 
immediately followed the Directory.  He would have brought with 
him all the absolutism of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>, and 
fresh revolutions would have been necessary to abolish it.  We 
know that a mere attempt to return to the past overthrew Charles 
X. 
</p><p>It would be a little ingenuous to complain of the 
 
 
<pb n="267"/>  
tyranny of Bonaparte.  Under the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> 
Frenchmen had supported every species of tyranny, and the 
Republic had created a despotism even heavier than that of the 
monarchy.  Despotism was then a normal condition, which aroused 
no protest save when it was accompanied by disorder. 
</p><p>A constant law of the psychology of crowds shows them as 
creating anarchy, and then seeking the master who will enable 
them to emerge therefrom.  Bonaparte was this master. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d111"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Reorganisation of France by the 
Consulate</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Upon assuming power Bonaparte undertook a colossal task.  All 
was in ruins; all was to be rebuilt.  On the morrow of the 
<hi rend="italic">coup</hi> of Brumaire he drafted, almost single-handed, the 
Constitution destined to give him the absolute power which was to

enable him to reorganise the country and to prevail over the 
factions.  In a month it was completed. 
</p><p>This Constitution, known as that of the year VIII., 
survived, with slight modifications, until the end of his reign. 
The executive power was the attribute of three Consuls, two of 
whom possessed a consultative voice only.  The first Consul, 
Bonaparte, was therefore sole master of France.  He appointed 
ministers, councillors of state, ambassadors, magistrates, and 
other officials, and decided upon peace or war.  The legislative 
power was his also, since only he could initiate the laws, which 
were subsequently submitted to three Assemblies&mdash;the Council of 
State, the Tribunate, and the Legislative Corps.  A fourth 
Assembly, 
 
 
<pb n="268"/>  
the Senate, acted effectually as the guardian of the 
Constitution. 
</p><p>Despotic as he was and became, Bonaparte always called the

other Consuls about him before proceeding with the most trivial 
measure.  The Legislative Corps did not exercise much influence 
during his reign, but he signed no decrees of any kind without 
first discussing them with the Council of State.  This Council, 
composed of the most enlightened and learned men of France, 
prepared laws, which were then presented to the Legislative 
Corps, which could criticise them very freely, since voting was 
secret.  Presided over by Bonaparte, the Council of State was a 
kind of sovereign tribunal, judging even the actions of 
ministers.<ref target="n9">9</ref> 
</p><p>The new master had great confidence in this Council, as it

was composed more particularly of 
 
 
<pb n="269"/>  
eminent jurists, each of whom dealt with his own speciality.  He 
was too good a psychologist not to entertain the greatest 
suspicion of large and incompetent assemblies of popular origin, 
whose disastrous results had been obvious to him during the whole

of the Revolution. 
</p><p>Wishing to govern for the people, but never with its 
assistance, Bonaparte accorded it no part in the government, 
reserving to it only the right of voting, once for all, for or 
against the adoption of the new Constitution.  He only in rare 
instances had recourse to universal suffrage.  The members of the

Legislative Corps recruited themselves, and were not elected by 
the people. 
</p><p>In creating a Constitution intended solely to fortify his 
own power, the First Consul had no illusion that it would serve 
to restore the country.  Consequently, while he was drafting it 
he also undertook the enormous task of the administrative, 
judicial, and financial reorganisation of France.  The various 
powers were centralised in Paris.  Each department was directed 
by a prefect, assisted by a consul-general; the 
<hi rend="italic">arrondissement</hi> by a sub-prefect, assisted by a council; 
the commune by a mayor, assisted by a municipal council.  All
were 
appointed by the ministers, and not by election, as under the 
Republic. 
</p><p>This system, which created the omnipotent State and a 
powerful centralisation, was retained by all subsequent 
Governments and is preserved to-day.  Centralisation being, in 
spite of its drawbacks, the only means of avoiding local 
tyrannies in a country profoundly divided within itself, has 
always been maintained. 
 
 
<pb n="270"/>  
 
</p><p>This organisation, based on a profound knowledge of the 
soul of the French people, immediately restored that tranquillity

and order which had for so long been unknown. 
</p><p>To complete the mental pacification of the country, the 
political exiles were recalled and the churches restored to the 
faithful. 
</p><p>Continuing to rebuild the social edifice, Bonaparte busied

himself also with the drafting of a code, the greater part of 
which consisted of customs borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi>.  It was, as has been said, a sort of 
transition or compromise between the old law and the new. 
</p><p>Considering the enormous task accomplished by the First 
Consul in so short a time, we realise that he had need, before 
all, of a Constitution according him absolute power.  If all the 
measures by which he restored France had been submitted to 
assemblies of attorneys, he could never have extricated the 
country from the disorder into which it had fallen. 
</p><p>The Constitution of the year VIII. obviously transformed 
the Republic into a monarchy at least as absolute as the 
&ldquo;Divine right&rdquo; monarchy of Louis XIV.  Being the only 
Constitution adapted to the needs of the moment, it represented a

psychological necessity. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d112"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Psychological Elements which determined the Success 
of the Work of the Consulate</hi></head> 
 
<p>All the external forces which act upon men&mdash;economic, 
historical, geographical, &amp;c.&mdash;may be finally translated into 
psychological forces.  These psychological forces a ruler must 
understand in order 
 
 
<pb n="271"/>  
to govern.  The Revolutionary Assemblies were completely ignorant

of them; Bonaparte knew how to employ them. 
</p><p>The various Assemblies, the Convention notably, were 
composed of conflicting parties.  Napoleon understood that to 
dominate them he must not belong to any one of these parties. 
Very well aware that the value of a country is disseminated among

the superior intelligences of the various parties, he tried to 
utilise them all.  His agents of government&mdash;ministers, priests, 
magistrates, &amp;c.&mdash;were taken indifferently from among the 
Liberals, Royalists, Jacobites, &amp;c., having regard only to their 
capacities. 
</p><p>While accepting the assistance of men of the <hi rend="italic">ancien 
r&eacute;gime</hi>, Bonaparte took care to make it understood that

he intended to maintain the fundamental principles of the 
Revolution.  Nevertheless many Royalists rallied round the new 
Government. 
</p><p>One of the most remarkable feats of the Consulate, from 
the psychological point of view, was the restoration of religious

peace.  France was far more divided by religious disagreement 
than by political differences.  The systematic destruction of a 
portion of the Vend&eacute;e had almost completely terminated the

struggle by force of arms, but without pacifying men's minds.  As

only one man, and he the head of Christianity, could assist in 
this pacification, Bonaparte did not hesitate to treat with him. 
His concordat was the work of a real psychologist, who knew that 
moral forces do not use violence, and the great danger of 
persecuting such.  While conciliating the clergy he contrived to 
place them under his own domination.  The bishops 
 
 
<pb n="272"/>  
were to be appointed and remunerated by the State, so that he 
would still be master. 
</p><p>The religious policy of Napoleon had a bearing which 
escapes our modern Jacobins.  Blinded by their narrow fanaticism,

they do not understand that to detach the Church from the 
Government is to create a state within the State, so that they 
are liable to find themselves opposed by a formidable caste, 
directed by a master outside France, and necessarily hostile to 
France.  To give one's enemies a liberty they did not possess is 
extremely dangerous.  Never would Napoleon, nor any of the 
sovereigns who preceded him, have consented to make the clergy 
independent of the State, as they have become to-day. 
</p><p>The difficulties of Bonaparte the First Consul were far 
greater than those he had to surmount after his coronation.  Only

a profound knowledge of men enabled him to triumph over them. 
The future master was far from being the master as yet.  Many 
departments were still in insurrection.  Brigandage persisted, 
and the Midi was ravaged by the struggles of partisans. 
Bonaparte, as Consul, had to conciliate and handle Talleyrand, 
Fouch&eacute;, and a number of generals who thought themselves 
his equal.  Even his brothers conspired against his power. 
Napoleon, as Emperor, had no hostile party to face, but as Consul

he had to combat all the parties and to hold the balance equal 
among them.  This must indeed have been a difficult task, since 
during the last century very few Governments have succeeded in 
accomplishing it. 
</p><p>The success of such an undertaking demanded an extremely 
subtle mixture of finesse, firmness, and 
 
 
<pb n="273"/>  
diplomacy.  Not feeling himself powerful enough as yet, Bonaparte

the Consul made a rule, according to his own expression, &ldquo;of 
governing men as the greater number wish to be governed.&rdquo;  As

Emperor he often managed to govern them according to his own 
ideal. 
</p><p>We have travelled a long way since the time when 
historians, in their singular blindness, and great poets, who 
possessed more talent than psychology, would hold forth in 
indignant accents against the <hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi> of 
Brumaire.  What profound illusions underlay the assertion that 
&ldquo;France lay fair in Messidor's great sun&rdquo;!  And other 
illusions no less profound underlay such verdicts as that of 
Victor Hugo concerning this period.  We have seen that the 
&ldquo;Crime of Brumaire&rdquo; had as an enthusiastic accomplice, 
not only the Government itself but the whole of France, which it 
delivered from anarchy. 
</p><p>One may wonder how intelligent men could so misjudge a 
period of history which is nevertheless so clear.  It was 
doubtless because they saw events through their own convictions, 
and we know what transformations the truth may suffer for the man

who is imprisoned in the valleys of belief.  The most luminous 
facts are obscured, and the history of events is the history of 
his dreams. 
</p><p>The psychologist who desires to understand the period 
which we have so briefly sketched can only do so if, being 
attached to no party, he stands clear of the passions which are 
the soul of parties.  He will never dream of recriminating a past

which was dictated by such imperious necessities.  Certainly 
Napoleon has cost France dear: his epic was terminated by two 
invasions, and there was yet to 
 
 
<pb n="275"/>  
be a third, whose consequences are felt even to-day, when the 
prestige which he exerted even from the tomb set upon the throne 
the inheritor of his name. 
</p><p>All these events are narrowly connected in their origin. 
They represent the price of that capital phenomenon in the 
evolution of a people, a change of ideal.  Man can never make the

attempt to break suddenly with his ancestors without profoundly 
affecting the course of his own history.

POLITICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THE CONFLICT

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d114"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Psychological Causes of the continued 
Revolutionary Movements to which France has been subject</hi>. 
</head> 
 
<p>IN examining, in a subsequent chapter, the evolution of 
revolutionary ideas during the last century, we shall see that 
during more than fifty years they very slowly spread through the 
various strata of society. 
</p><p>During the whole of this period the great majority of the 
people and the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> rejected them, and their 
diffusion was effected only by a very limited number of apostles.

But their influence, thanks principally to the faults of 
Governments, was sufficient to provoke several revolutions.  We 
shall examine these briefly when we have examined the 
psychological influences which gave them birth. 
</p><p>The history of our political upheavals during the last 
century is enough to prove, even if we did not yet realise the 
fact, that men are governed by their mentalities far more than by

the institutions which their rulers endeavour to force upon them.

</p><p>The successive revolutions which France has suffered have 
been the consequences of struggles 
 
 
<pb n="276"/>  
between two portions of the nation whose mentalities are 
different.  One is religious and monarchical and is dominated by 
long ancestral influences; the other is subjected to the same 
influences, but gives them a revolutionary form. 
</p><p>From the commencement of the Revolution the struggle 
between contrary mentalities was plainly manifested.  We have 
seen that in spite of the most frightful repression insurrections

and conspiracies lasted until the end of the Directory.  They 
proved that the traditions of the past had left profound roots in

the popular soul.  At a certain moment sixty departments were in 
revolt against the new Government, and were only repressed by 
repeated massacres on a vast scale. 
</p><p>To establish some sort of compromise between the <hi rend="italic">ancien

r&eacute;gime</hi> and the new ideals was the most difficult of 
the problems which Bonaparte had to resolve.  He had to discover 
institutions which would suit the two mentalities into which 
France was divided.  He succeeded, as we have seen, by 
conciliatory measures, and also by dressing very ancient things
in new names. 
</p><p>His reign was one of those rare periods of French history 
during which the mental unity of France was complete. 
</p><p>This unity could not outlive him.  On the morrow of his 
fall all the old parties reappeared, and have survived until the 
present day.  Some attach themselves to traditional influences; 
others violently reject them. 
</p><p>If this long conflict had been between believers and the 
indifferent, it could not have lasted, for indifference 
 
 
<pb n="277"/>  
is always tolerant; but the struggle was really between two 
different beliefs.  The lay Church very soon assumed a religious 
aspect, and its pretended rationalism has become, especially in 
recent years, a barely attenuated form of the narrowest clerical 
spirit.  Now, we have shown that no conciliation is possible 
between dissimilar religious beliefs.  The clericals when in 
power could not therefore show themselves more tolerant towards 
freethinkers than these latter are to-day toward the clericals. 
</p><p>These divisions, determined by differences of belief, were

complicated by the addition of the political conceptions derived 
from those beliefs. 
</p><p>Many simple souls have for long believed that the real 
history of France began with the year I. of the Republic.  This 
rudimentary conception is at last dying out.  Even the most rigid

revolutionaries renounce it,<ref target="n10">10</ref> and are quite
willing to 
recognise that the past was something better than an epoch of 
black barbarism dominated by low superstitions. 
</p><p>The religious origin of most of the political beliefs held

in France inspires their adepts with an inextinguishable hatred 
which always strikes foreigners with amazement. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing is more obvious, nothing is more 
certain,&rdquo; writes Mr. Barret-Wendell, in his book on France, 
&ldquo;than this fact: that not only have the 
 
 
<pb n="278"/>  
royalists, revolutionaries, and Bonapartists always been mortally

opposed to one another, but that, owing to the passionate ardour 
of the French character, they have always entertained a profound 
intellectual horror for one another.  Men who believe themselves 
in possession of the truth cannot refrain from affirming that 
those who do not think with them are instruments of error. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Each party will gravely inform you that the advocates

of the adverse cause are afflicted by a dense stupidity or are 
consciously dishonest.  Yet when you meet these latter, who will 
say exactly the same things as their detractors, you cannot but 
recognise, in all good faith, that they are neither stupid nor 
dishonest.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This reciprocal execration of the believers of each party 
has always facilitated the overthrow of Governments and ministers

in France.  The parties in the minority will never refuse to ally

themselves against the triumphant party.  We know that a great 
number of revolutionary Socialists have been elected to the 
present Chamber only by the aid of the monarchists, who are still

as unintelligent as they were at the time of the Revolution. 
</p><p>Our religious and political differences do not constitute 
the only cause of dissension in France.  They are held by men 
possessing that particular mentality which I have already 
described under the name of the revolutionary mentality.  We have

seen that each period always presents a certain number of 
individuals ready to revolt against the established order of 
things, whatever that may be, even though it may realise all 
their desires. 
 
 
<pb n="279"/>  
 
</p><p>The intolerance of the parties in France, and their desire

to seize upon power, are further favoured by the conviction, so 
prevalent under the Revolution, that societies can be remade by 
means of laws.  The modern State, whatever its leader, has 
inherited in the eyes of the multitudes and their leaders the 
mystic power attributed to the ancient kings, when these latter 
were regarded as an incarnation of the Divine will.  Not only the

people is inspired by this confidence in the power of Government;

all our legislators entertain it also.<ref target="n11">11</ref> 
</p><p>Legislating always, politicians never realise that as 
institutions are effects, and not causes, they have no virtue in 
themselves.  Heirs to the great revolutionary illusion, they do 
not see that man is created by a past whose foundations we are 
powerless to reshape. 
</p><p>The conflict between the principles dividing France, which

has lasted more than a century, will doubtless continue for a 
long time yet, and no one can foresee what fresh upheavals it may

engender.  No doubt if before our era the Athenians could have 
divined that their social dissensions would have led to the 
enslavement of Greece, they would have renounced them; but how 
could they have foreseen as much?  M. Guiraud justly writes: 
&ldquo;A generation of men 
 
 
<pb n="280"/>  
very rarely realises the task which it is accomplishing.  It is 
preparing for the future; but this future is often the contrary 
of what it wishes.&rdquo;

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Summary of a Century's Revolutionary Movement in 
France</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The psychological causes of the revolutionary movements which 
France has seen during the past century having been explained, it

will now suffice to present a summary picture of these successive

revolutions. 
</p><p>The sovereigns in coalition having defeated Napoleon, they

reduced France to her former limits, and placed Louis XVIII., the

only possible sovereign, on the throne. 
</p><p>By a special charter the new king accepted the position of

a constitutional monarch under a representative system of 
government.  He recognised all the conquests of the Revolution: 
the civil Code, equality before the law, liberty of worship, 
irrevocability of the sale of national property, &amp;c.  The right 
of suffrage, however, was limited to those paying a certain 
amount in taxes. 
</p><p>This liberal Constitution was opposed by the ultra-royalists.  Returned <hi rend="italic">emigr&eacute;s</hi>, they wanted the 
restitution of the national property, and the re-establishment of

their ancient privileges. 
</p><p>Fearing that such a reaction might cause a new revolution,

Louis XVIII. was reduced to dissolving the Chamber.  The election

having returned moderate deputies, he was able to continue to 
govern with the same principles, understanding very well that any

attempt to govern the French by the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi> 
would be enough to provoke a general rebellion. 
 
 
<pb n="281"/>  
 
</p><p>Unfortunately, his death, in I 824, placed Charles X., 
formerly Comte d'Artois, on the throne.  Extremely narrow, 
incapable of understanding the new world which surrounded him, 
and boasting that he had not modified his ideas since 1789, he 
prepared a series of reactionary laws&mdash;a law by which an 
indemnity of forty millions sterling was to be paid to 
<hi rend="italic">emigr&eacute;s</hi>; a law of sacrilege; and laws establishing 
the rights of primogeniture, the preponderance of the clergy, &amp;c.

</p><p>The majority of the deputies showing themselves daily more

opposed to his projects, in 1830 he enacted Ordinances dissolving

the Chamber, suppressing the liberty of the Press, and preparing 
for the restoration of the <hi rend="italic">ancien r&eacute;gime</hi>. 
</p><p>The effect was immediate.  This autocratic action provoked

a coalition of the leaders of all parties.  Republicans, 
Bonapartists, Liberals, Royalists&mdash;all united in order to raise 
the Parisian populace.  Four days after the publication of the 
Ordinances the insurgents were masters of the capital, and 
Charles X. fled to England. 
</p><p>The leaders of the movement&mdash;Thiers, Casimir-Perier, La 
Fayette, &amp;c.&mdash;summoned to Paris Louis-Philippe, of whose 
existence the people were scarcely aware, and declared him king 
of the French. 
</p><p>Between the indifference of the people and the hostility 
of the nobles, who had remained faithful to the legitimate 
dynasty, the new king relied chiefly upon the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.

An electoral law having reduced the electors to less than 
200,000, this class played an exclusive part in the government. 
</p><p>The situation of the sovereign was not easy.  He had to 
struggle simultaneously against the legitimist 
 
 
<pb n="282"/>  
supporters of Henry V. the grandson of Charles X., and the 
Bonapartists, who recognised as their head Louis-Napoleon, the 
Emperor's nephew, and finally against the republicans. 
</p><p>By means of their secret societies, analogous to the dubs 
of the Revolution, the latter provoked numerous riots at various 
intervals between 1830 and 1840, but these were easily repressed.

</p><p>The clericals and legitimists, on their side, did not 
cease their intrigues.  The Duchess de Berry, the mother of Henry

V., tried in vain to raise the Vend&eacute;e.  As to the clergy, 
their demands finally made them so intolerable that an 
insurrection broke out, in the course of which the palace of the 
archbishop of Paris was sacked. 
</p><p>The republicans as a party were not very dangerous, as the

Chamber sided with the king in the struggle against them.  The 
minister Guizot, who advocated a strong central power, declared 
that two things were indispensable to government&mdash;&ldquo;reason and

cannon.&rdquo;  The famous statesman was surely somewhat deluded as

to the necessity or efficacy of reason. 
</p><p>Despite this strong central power, which in reality was 
not strong, the republicans, and above all the Socialists, 
continued to agitate.  One of the most influential, Louis Blanc, 
claimed that it was the duty of the Government to procure work 
for every citizen.  The Catholic party, led by Lacordaire and 
Montalembert, united with the Socialists&mdash;as to-day in Belgium&mdash; 
to oppose the Government. 
</p><p>A campaign in favour of electoral reform ended in 1848 in 
a fresh riot, which unexpectedly overthrew Louis-Philippe. 
 
 
<pb n="283"/>  
 
</p><p>His fall was far less justifiable than that of Charles X. 
There was little with which he could be reproached.  Doubtless he

was suspicious of universal suffrage, but the French Revolution 
had more than once been quite suspicious of it.  Louis-Philippe 
not being, like the Directory, an absolute ruler, could not, as 
the latter had done, annul unfavourable elections. 
</p><p>A provisional Government was installed in the H&ocirc;tel 
de Ville, to replace the fallen monarchy.  It proclaimed the 
Republic, established universal suffrage, and decreed that the 
people should proceed to the election of a National Assembly of 
nine hundred members. 
</p><p>From the first days of its existence the new Government 
found itself the victim of socialistic man&oelig;uvres and riots.

</p><p>The psychological phenomena observed during the first 
Revolution were now to be witnessed again.  Clubs were formed, 
whose leaders sent the people from time to time against the 
Assembly, for reasons which were generally quite devoid of common

sense&mdash;for example, to force the Government to support an 
insurrection in Poland, &amp;c. 
</p><p>In the hope of satisfying the Socialists, every day more 
noisy and exigent, the Assembly organised national workshops, in 
which the workers were occupied in various forms of labour.  In 
these 100,000 men cost the State more than &pound;40,000 weekly. 
Their claim to receive pay without working for it forced the 
Assembly to close the workshops. 
</p><p>This measure was the origin of a formidable insurrection, 
50,000 workers revolting.  The Assembly, 
 
 
<pb n="284"/>  
terrified, confided all the executive powers to General 
Cavaignac.  There was a four-days battle with the insurgents, 
during which three generals and the Archbishop of Paris were 
killed; 3,000 prisoners were deported by the Assembly to Algeria,

and revolutionary Socialism was annihilated for a space of fifty 
years. 
</p><p>These events brought Government stock down from 116 to 50 
francs.  Business was at a standstill.  The peasants, who thought

themselves threatened by the Socialists, and the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi>, whose taxes the Assembly had increased by half,

turned against 
the Republic, and when Louis-Napoleon promised to re-establish 
order he found himself welcomed with enthusiasm.  A candidate for

the position of President of the Republic, who according to the 
new Constitution must be elected by the whole body of citizens, 
he was chosen by 5,500,000 votes. 
</p><p>Very soon at odds with the Chamber, the prince decided on 
a <hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi>.  The Assembly was dissolved; 30,000 
persons were arrested, 10,000 deported, and a hundred deputies 
were exiled. 
</p><p>This <hi rend="italic">coup d'&Eacute;tat</hi>, although summary, was very

favourably received, for when submitted to a plebiscite it 
received 7,500,000 votes out of 8,000,000. 
</p><p>On the 2nd of November, 1852, Napoleon had himself named 
Emperor by an even greater majority:  The horror which the 
generality of Frenchmen felt for demagogues and Socialists had 
restored the Empire. 
</p><p>In the first part of its existence it constituted an 
absolute Government, and during the latter half a liberal 
Government.  After eighteen years of rule the Emperor was 
overthrown by the revolution of the 
 
 
<pb n="285"/>  
4th of September, 1870, after the capitulation of Sedan. 
</p><p>Since that time revolutionary movements have been rare; 
the only one of importance was the revolution of March, 1871, 
which resulted in the burning of many of the monuments of Paris 
and the execution of about 20,000 insurgents. 
</p><p>After the war of 1870 the electors, who, amid so many 
disasters, did not know which way to turn, sent a great number of

Orleanist and legitimist deputies to the Constituent Assembly. 
Unable to agree upon the establishment of a monarchy, they 
appointed M. Thiers President of the Republic, later replacing 
him by Marshal Mac-Mahon.  In 1876 the new elections, like all 
those that have followed, sent a majority of republicans to the 
Chamber. 
</p><p>The various assemblies which have succeeded to this have 
always been divided into numerous parties, which have provoked 
innumerable changes of ministry. 
</p><p>However, thanks to the equilibrium resulting from this 
division of parties, we have for forty years enjoyed comparative 
quiet.  Four Presidents of the Republic have been overthrown 
without revolution, and the riots that have occurred, such as 
those of Champagne and the Midi, have not had serious 
consequences. 
</p><p>A great popular movement, in 1888, did nearly overthrow 
the Republic for the benefit of General Boulanger, but it has 
survived and triumphed over the attacks of all parties. 
</p><p>Various reasons contribute to the maintenance of the 
present Republic.  In the first place, of the 
 
 
 
<pb n="286"/>  
 
conflicting factions none is strong enough to crush the rest.  In

the second place, the head of the State being purely decorative, 
and possessing no power, it is impossible to attribute to him the

evils from which the country may suffer, and to feel sure that 
matters would be different were he overthrown.  Finally, as the 
supreme power is distributed among thousands of hands, 
responsibilities are so disseminated that it would be difficult 
to know where to begin.  A tyrant can be overthrown, but what can

be done against a host of little anonymous tyrannies? 
</p><p>If we wished to sum up in a word the great transformations

which have been effected in France by a century of riots and 
revolutions, we might say that individual tyranny, which was weak

and therefore easily overthrown, has been replaced by collective 
tyrannies, which are very strong and difficult to destroy.  To a 
people avid of equality and habituated to hold its Governments 
responsible for every event individual tyranny seemed 
insupportable, while a collective tyranny is readily endured, 
although generally much more severe. 
</p><p>The extension of the tyranny of the State has therefore 
been the final result of all our revolutions, and the common 
characteristic of all systems of government which we have known 
in France.  This form of tyranny may be regarded as a racial 
ideal, since successive upheavals of France have only fortified 
it.  Statism is the real political system of the Latin peoples, 
and the only system that receives all suffrages.  The other forms

of government&mdash;republic, monarchy, empire&mdash;represent empty 
labels, powerless shadows.

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d119"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">Gradual Propagation of Democratic Ideas after the 
Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>IDEAS which are firmly established, incrusted, as it were, in 
men's minds, continue to act for several generations.  Those 
which resulted from the French Revolution were, like others, 
subject to this law. 
</p><p>Although the life of the Revolution as a Government was 
short, the influence of its principles was, on the contrary, very

long-lived.  Becoming a form of religious belief, they profoundly

modified the orientation of the sentiments and ideas of several 
generations. 
</p><p>Despite a few intervals, the French Revolution has 
continued up to the present, and still survives.  The 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of Napoleon was not confined to overturning the

world, changing the map of Europe, and remaking the exploits of 
Alexander.  The new rights of the people, created by the 
Revolution and established by its institutions, have exercised a 
profound influence.  The military work of the conqueror was soon 
dissolved, but the revolutionary principles which he contributed 
to propagate have survived him. 
 
 
<pb n="290"/>  
 
</p><p>The various restorations which followed the Empire caused 
men at first to become somewhat forgetful of the principles of 
the Revolution.  For fifty years this propagation was far from 
rapid.  One might almost have supposed that the people had 
forgotten them.  Only a small number of theorists maintained 
their influence.  Heirs to the &ldquo;simplicist&rdquo; spirit of the

Jacobins, believing, like them, that societies can be remade from

top to bottom by the laws, and persuaded that the Empire had only

interrupted the task of revolution, they wished to resume it. 
</p><p>While waiting until they could recommence, they attempted 
to spread the principles of the Revolution by means of their 
writings.  Faithful imitators of the men of the Revolution, they 
never stopped to ask if their schemes for reform were in 
conformity with human nature.  They too were erecting a 
chimerical society for an ideal man, and were persuaded that the 
application of their dreams would regenerate the human species. 
</p><p>Deprived of all constructive power, the theorists of all 
the ages have always been very ready to destroy.  Napoleon at St.

Helena stated that &ldquo;if there existed a monarchy of granite 
the idealists and theorists would manage to reduce it to 
powder.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Among the galaxy of dreamers such as Saint-Simon, Fourier,

Pierre Leroux, Louis Blanc, Quinet, &amp;c., we find that only 
Auguste Comte understood that a transformation of manners and 
ideas must precede political reorganisation. 
</p><p>Far from favouring the diffusion of democratic ideas, the 
projects of reform of the theorists of this period merely impeded

their progress.  Communistic 
 
 
<pb n="291"/>  
Socialism, which several of them professed would restore the 
Revolution, finally alarmed the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> and even the 
working-classes.  We have already seen that the fear of their 
ideas was one of the principal causes of the restoration of the 
Empire. 
</p><p>If none of the chimerical lucubrations of the writers of 
the first half of the nineteenth century deserve to be discussed,

it is none the less interesting to examine them in order to 
observe the part played by religious and moral ideas which to-day

are regarded with contempt.  Persuaded that a new society could 
not, any more than the societies of old, be built up without 
religious and moral beliefs, the reformers were always 
endeavouring to found such beliefs. 
</p><p>But on what could they be based?  Evidently on reason.  By

means of reason men create complicated machines: why not 
therefore a religion and a morality, things which are apparently 
so simple?  Not one of them suspected the fact that no religious 
or moral belief ever had rational logic as its basis.  Auguste 
Comte saw no more clearly.  We know that he founded a so-called 
positivist religion, which still has a few followers.  Scientists

were to form a clergy directed by a new Pope, who was to replace 
the Catholic Pope. 
</p><p>All these conceptions&mdash;political, religious, or moral&mdash; 
had, I repeat, no other results for a long time than to turn the 
multitude away from democratic principles. 
</p><p>If these principles did finally become widespread, it was 
not on account of the theorists, but because new conditions of 
life had arisen.  Thanks to the discoveries of science, industry 
developed and led to the 
 
 
<pb n="292"/>  
erection of immense factories.  Economic necessities increasingly

dominated the wills of Governments and the people and finally 
created a favourable soil for the extension of Socialism, and 
above all of Syndicalism, the modern forms of democratic ideas. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d120"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Unequal Influence of the Three Fundamental 
Principles of the Revolution</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The heritage of the Revolution is summed up in its entirety in

the one phrase&mdash;<hi rend="italic">Liberty, equality, and Fraternity</hi>.  The 
principle of equality, as we have seen, has exerted a powerful 
influence, but the two others did not share its lot. 
</p><p>Although the sense of these terms seems clear enough, they

were comprehended in very different fashions according to men and

times.  We know that the various interpretation of the same words

by persons of different mentality has been one of the most 
frequent causes of the conflicts of history. 
</p><p>To the member of the Convention liberty signified merely 
the exercise of its unlimited despotism.  To a young modern 
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; the same word means a general release from

everything irksome: tradition, law, superiority, &amp;c.  To the 
modern Jacobin liberty consists especially in the right to 
persecute his adversaries. 
</p><p>Although political orators still occasionally mention 
liberty in their speeches, they have generally ceased to evoke 
fraternity.  It is the conflict of the different classes and not 
their alliance that they teach to-day.  Never did a more profound

hatred divide the various strata of society and the political 
parties which lead them. 
 
 
<pb n="293"/>  
 
</p><p>But while liberty has become very doubtful and fraternity 
has completely vanished, the principle of equality has grown 
unchecked.  It has been supreme in all the political upheavals of

which France has been the stage during the last century, and has 
reached such a development that our political and social life, 
our laws, manners, and customs are at least in theory based on 
this principle.  It constitutes the real legacy of the 
Revolution.  The craving for equality, not only before the law, 
but in position and fortune, is the very pivot of the last 
product of democracy:  Socialism.  This craving is so powerful 
that it is spreading in all directions, although in contradiction

with all biological and economic laws.  It is a new phase of the 
interrupted struggle of the sentiments against reason, in which 
reason so rarely triumphs. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d121"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">The Democracy of the &ldquo;Intellectuals&rdquo; and 
Popular Democracy</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>All ideas that have hitherto caused an upheaval of the world 
of men have been subject to two laws: they evolve slowly, and 
they completely change their sense according to the mentalities 
in which they find reception. 
</p><p>A doctrine may be compared to a living being.  It subsists

only by process of transformation.  The books are necessarily 
silent upon these variations, so that the phase of things which 
they establish belongs only to the past.  They do not reflect the

image of the living, but of the dead.  The written statement of a

doctrine often represents the most negligible side of that 
doctrine. 
 
 
<pb n="294"/>  
 
</p><p>I have shown in another work how institutions, arts, and 
languages are modified in passing from one people to another, and

how the laws of these transformations differ from the truth as 
stated in books.  I allude to this matter now merely to show why,

in examining the subject of democratic ideas, we occupy ourselves

so little with the text of doctrines, and seek only for the 
psychological elements of which they constitute the vestment, and

the reactions which they provoke in the various categories of men

who have accepted them. 
</p><p>Modified rapidly by men of different mentalities, the 
original theory is soon no more than a label which denotes 
something quite unlike itself. 
</p><p>Applicable to religious beliefs, these principles are 
equally so to political beliefs.  When a man speaks of democracy,

for example, must we inquire what this word means to various 
peoples, and also whether in the same people there is not a great

difference between the democracy of the &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; 
and popular democracy. 
</p><p>In confining ourselves now to the consideration of this 
latter point we shall readily perceive that the democratic ideas 
to be found in books and journals are purely the theories of 
literary people, of which the people know nothing, and by the 
application of which they would have nothing to gain.  Although 
the working-man possesses the theoretical right of passing the 
barriers which separate him from the upper classes by a whole 
series of competitions and examinations, his chance of reaching 
them is in reality extremely slight. 
</p><p>The democracy of the lettered classes has no other 
 
 
<pb n="295"/>  
 
object than to set up a selection which shall recruit the 
directing classes exclusively from themselves.  I should have 
nothing to say against this if the selection were real.  It would

then constitute the application of the maxim of Napoleon: 
&ldquo;The true method of government is to employ the aristocracy, 
but under the forms of democracy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Unhappily the democracy of the &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; 
would simply lead to the substitution of the Divine right of 
kings by the Divine right of a petty oligarchy, which is too 
often narrow and tyrannical.  Liberty cannot be created by 
replacing a tyranny. 
</p><p>Popular democracy by no means aims at manufacturing 
rulers.  Dominated entirely by the spirit of equality and the 
desire to ameliorate the lot of the workers, it rejects the idea 
of fraternity, and exhibits no anxiety in respect of liberty.  No

government is conceivable to popular democracy except in the form

of an autocracy.  We see this, not only in history, which shows 
us that since the Revolution all despotic Governments have been 
vigorously acclaimed, but also in the autocratic fashion in which

the workers' trades unions are conducted. 
</p><p>This profound distinction between the democracy of the 
lettered classes and popular democracy is far more obvious to the

workers than to the intellectuals.  In their mentalities there is

nothing in common; the two classes do not speak the same 
language.  The syndicalists emphatically assert to-day that no 
alliance could possibly exist between them and the politicians of

the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.  This assertion is strictly true. 
</p><p>It was always so, and this, no doubt, is why popular 
 
 
<pb n="296"/>  
democracy, from Plato's to our own times, has never been defended

by the great thinkers. 
</p><p>This fact has greatly struck Emile Faguet.  &ldquo;Almost 
all the thinkers of the nineteenth century,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;were not democrats.  When I was writing <hi rend="italic">my Politiques et 
moralistes du XIX<hi rend="sub">e</hi> si&egrave;cle</hi> this was my 
despair.  I could not find one who had been a democrat; yet I was

extremely anxious to find one so that I could give the democratic

doctrine as formulated by him.&rdquo; 
</p><p>The eminent writer might certainly have found plenty of 
professional politicians, but these latter rarely belong to the 
category of thinkers. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d122"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">Natural Inequalities and Democratic 
Equalisation</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The difficulty of reconciling democratic equalisation with 
natural inequalities constitutes one of the most difficult 
problems of the present hour.  We know what are the desires of 
democracy.  Let us see what Nature replies to these demands. 
</p><p>The democratic ideas which have so often shaken the world 
from the heroic ages of Greece to modern times are always 
clashing with natural inequalities.  Some observers have held, 
with Helvetius, that the inequality between men is created by 
education. 
</p><p>As a matter of fact, Nature does not know such a thing as 
equality.  She distributes unevenly genius, beauty, health, 
vigour, intelligence, and all the qualities which confer on their

possessors a superiority over their fellows. 
</p><p>No theory can alter these discrepancies, so that 
democratic doctrines will remain confined to words 
 
 
<pb n="297"/>  
until the laws of heredity consent to unify the capacities of 
men. 
</p><p>Can we suppose that societies will ever succeed in 
establishing artificially the equality refused by Nature? 
</p><p>A few theorists have believed for a long time that 
education might effect a general levelling.  Many years of 
experience have shown the depth of this illusion. 
</p><p>It would not, however, be impossible for a triumphant 
Socialism to establish equality for a time by rigorously 
eliminating all superior individuals.  One can easily foresee 
what would become of a people that had suppressed its best 
individuals while surrounded by other nations progressing by 
means of their best individuals. 
</p><p>Not only does Nature not know equality, but since the 
beginning of the ages she has always realised progress by means 
of successive differentiations&mdash;that is to say, by increasing 
inequalities.  These alone could raise the obscure cell of the 
early geological periods to the superior beings whose inventions 
were to change the face of the earth. 
</p><p>The same phenomenon is to be observed in societies.  The 
forms of democracy which select the better elements of the 
popular classes finally result in the creation of an intellectual

aristocracy, a result the contrary of the dream of the pure 
theorists, to beat down the superior elements of society to the 
level of the inferior elements. 
</p><p>On the side of natural law, which is hostile to theories 
of equality, are the conditions of modern progress.  Science and 
industry demand more and 
 
 
<pb n="298"/>  
more considerable intellectual efforts, so that mental 
inequalities and the differences of social condition which spring

from them cannot but become accentuated. 
</p><p>We therefore observe this striking phenomenon: as laws and

institutions seek to level individuals the progress of 
civilisation tends still further to differentiate them.  From the

peasant to the feudal baron the intellectual difference was not 
great, but from the working-man to the engineer it is immense and

is increasing daily. 
</p><p>Capacity being the principal factor of progress, the 
capable of each class rise while the mediocre remain stationary 
or sink.  What could laws do in the face of such inevitable 
necessities? 
</p><p>In vain do the incapable pretend that, representing 
number, they also represent force.  Deprived of the superior 
brains by whose researches all workers profit, they would 
speedily sink into poverty and anarchy. 
</p><p>The capital <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of the elect in modern 
civilisation seems too obvious to need pointing out.  In the case

of civilised nations and barbarian peoples, which contain similar

averages of mediocrities, the superiority of the former arises 
solely from the superior minds which they contain.  The United 
States have understood this so thoroughly that they forbid the 
immigration of Chinese workers, whose capacity is identical with 
that of American workers, and who, working for lower wages, tend 
to create a formidable competition with the latter.  Despite 
these evidences we see the antagonism between the multitude and 
the elect increasing day by day.  At no period were the elect 
more necessary, yet never were they supported with such 
difficulty. 
 
 
<pb n="299"/>  
 
</p><p>One of the most solid foundations of Socialism is an 
intense hatred of the elect.  Its adepts always forget that 
scientific, artistic, and industrial progress, which creates the 
strength of a country and the prosperity of millions of workers, 
is due solely to a small number of superior brains. 
</p><p>If the worker makes three times as much to-day as he did a

hundred years ago, and enjoys commodities then unknown to great 
nobles, he owes it entirely to the elect. 
</p><p>Suppose that by some miracle Socialism had been 
universally accepted a century ago.  Risk, speculation, 
initiative&mdash;in a word, all the stimulants of human activity&mdash; 
being suppressed, no progress would have been possible, and the 
worker would have remained as poor as he was.  Men would merely 
have established that equality in poverty desired by the jealousy

and envy of a host of mediocre minds.  Humanity will never 
renounce the progress of civilisation to satisfy so low an ideal.

THE RESULTS OF DEMOCRATIC EVOLUTION 
</head> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d124"> 
<head><hi rend="italic">1.  The Influence upon Social Evolution of Theories of 
no Rational Value</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WE have seen that natural laws do not agree with the 
aspirations of democracy.  We know, also, that such a statement 
has never affected doctrines already in men's minds.  The man led

by a belief never troubles about its real value 
</p><p>The philosopher who studies a belief must obviously 
discuss its rational content, but he is more concerned with its 
influences upon the general mind. 
</p><p>Applied to the interpretation of all the great beliefs of 
history, the importance of this distinction is at once evident. 
Jupiter, Moloch, Vishnu, Allah, and so many other divinities, 
were, no doubt, from the rational point of view, mere illusions, 
yet their effect upon the life of the peoples has been 
considerable. 
</p><p>The same distinction is applicable to the beliefs which 
prevailed during the Middle Ages.  Equally illusory, they 
nevertheless exercised as profound an influence as if they had 
corresponded with realities. 
</p><p>If any one doubts this, let him compare the domination of 
the Roman Empire and that of the Church of Rome.  The first was 
perfectly real and 
 
 
<pb n="301"/>  
tangible, and implied no illusion.  The second, while its 
foundations were entirely chimerical, was fully as powerful. 
Thanks to it, during the long night of the Middle Ages, semi-barbarous peoples acquired those social bonds and restraints and 
that national soul without which there is no civilisation. 
</p><p>The power possessed by the Church proves, again, that the 
power of certain illusions is sufficiently great to create, at 
least momentarily, sentiments as contrary to the interests of the

individual as they are to that of society&mdash;such as the love of 
the monastic life, the desire for martyrdom, the crusades, the 
religious wars, &amp;c. 
</p><p>The application to democratic and socialistic ideas of the

preceding considerations shows that it matters little that these 
ideas have no defensible basis.  They impress and influence men's

minds, and that is sufficient.  Their results may be disastrous 
in the extreme, but we cannot prevent them. 
</p><p>The apostles of the new doctrines are quite wrong in 
taking so much trouble to find a rational basis for their 
aspirations.  They would be far more convincing were they to 
confine themselves to making affirmations and awakening hopes. 
Their real strength resides in the religious mentality which is 
inherent in the heart of man, and which during the ages has only 
changed its object. 
</p><p>Later on we shall consider from a philosophical point of 
view various consequences of the democratic evolution whose 
course we see accelerating.  We may say in respect of the Church 
in the Middle Ages that it had the power of profoundly 
influencing the mentality of men.  Examining certain results of 
the 
 
 
<pb n="302"/>  
democratic doctrines, we shall see that the power of these is no 
less than that of the Church. 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="2" id="d125"> 
<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Jacobin Spirit and the Mentality created by 
Democratic Beliefs</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Existing generations have inherited, not only the 
revolutionary principles but also the special mentality which 
achieves their success. 
</p><p>Describing this mentality when we were examining the 
Jacobin spirit, we saw that it always endeavours to impose by 
force illusions which it regards as the truth.  The Jacobin 
spirit has finally become so general in France and in other Latin

countries that it has affected all political parties, even the 
most conservative.  The <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> is strongly affected 
by it, and the people still more so. 
</p><p>This increase of the Jacobin spirit has resulted in the 
fact that political conceptions, institutions, and laws tend to 
impose themselves by force.  Syndicalism, peaceful enough in 
other countries, immediately assumed in France an uncompromising 
and anarchical aspect, which betrayed itself in the shape of 
riots, <hi rend="italic">sabotage</hi>, and incendiarism. 
</p><p>Not to be repressed by timid Governments, the Jacobin 
spirit produces melancholy ravages in minds of mediocre capacity.

At a recent congress of railway men a third of the delegates 
voted approval of <hi rend="italic">sabotage</hi>, and one of the secretaries of 
the Congress began his speech by saying:  &ldquo;I send all 
<hi rend="italic">saboteurs</hi> my fraternal greeting and all my 
admiration.&rdquo; 
</p><p>This general mentality engenders an increasing anarchy. 
That France is not in a permanent state of anarchy is, as I have 
already remarked, due to 
 
 
<pb n="303"/>  
the fact that the parties by which she is divided produce 
something like equilibrium.  They are animated by a mortal hatred

for one another, but none of them is strong enough to enslave its

rivals. 
</p><p>This Jacobin intolerance is spreading to such an extent 
that the rulers themselves employ without scruple the most 
revolutionary tactics with regard to their enemies, violently 
persecuting any party that offers the least resistance, and even 
despoiling it of its property.  Our rulers to-day behave as the 
ancient conquerors used; the vanquished have nothing to hope from

the victors. 
</p><p>Far from being peculiar to the lower orders, intolerance 
is equally prominent among the ruling classes.  Michelet remarked

long ago that the violence of the cultivated classes is often 
greater than that of the people.  It is true that they do not 
break the street lamps, but they are ready enough to cause heads 
to be broken.  The worst violence of the revolution was the work 
of cultivated <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>&mdash;professors, lawyers, &amp;c., 
possessors of that classical education which is supposed to 
soften the manners.  It has not done so in these days, any more 
than it did of old.  One can make sure of this by reading the 
advanced journals, whose contributors and editors are recruited 
chiefly from among the professors of the University. 
</p><p>Their books are as violent as their articles, and one 
wonders how such favourites of fortune can have secreted such 
stores of hatred. 
</p><p>One would find it hard to credit them did they assure us 
that they were consumed by an intense passion for altruism.  One 
might more readily 
 
 
<pb n="304"/>  
admit that apart from a narrow religious mentality the hope of 
being remarked by the mighty ones of the day, or of creating a 
profitable popularity, is the only possible explanation of the 
violence recommended in their written propaganda. 
</p><p>I have already, in one of my preceding works, cited some 
passages from a book written by a professor at the College of 
France, in which the author incites the people to seize upon the 
riches of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, whom he furiously abuses, and 
have arrived at the conclusion that a new revolution would 
readily find among the authors of such books the Marats, Robes-pierres, and Carriers whom it might require. 
</p><p>The Jacobin religion&mdash;above all in its Socialist form&mdash;has

all the power of the ancient faiths over feeble minds Blinded by 
their faith, they believe that reason is their guide, but are 
really actuated solely by their passions and their dreams. 
</p><p>The evolution of democratic ideas has thus produced not 
only the political results already mentioned, but also a 
considerable effect upon the mentality of modern men. 
</p><p>If the ancient dogmas have long ago exhausted their power,

the theories of democracy are far from having lost theirs, and we

see their consequences increasing daily.  One of the chief 
results has been the general hatred of superiority. 
</p><p>This hatred of whatever passes the average in social 
fortune or intelligence is to-day general in all classes, from 
the working-classes to the upper strata of the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.  The results are envy, detraction, and a love

of attack, of raillery, of persecution, and a habit of 
attributing all actions to low motives, of refusing to believe in

probity, disinterestedness, and intelligence. 
 
 
<pb n="305"/>  
 
</p><p>Conversation, among the people as among the most 
cultivated Frenchmen, is stamped with the craze for abasing and 
abusing everything and everyone.  Even the greatest of the dead 
do not escape this tendency.  Never were so many books written to

depreciate the merit of famous men, men who were formerly 
regarded as the most precious patrimony of their country. 
</p><p>Envy and hatred seem from all time to have been 
inseparable from democratic theories, but the spread of these 
sentiments has never been so great as to-day.  It strikes all 
observers. 
</p><p>&ldquo;There is a low demagogic instinct,&rdquo; writes M. 
Bourdeau, &ldquo;without any moral inspiration, which dreams of 
pulling humanity down to the lowest level, and for which any 
superiority, even of culture, is an offence to society. . . it is

the sentiment of ignoble equality which animated the Jacobin 
butchers when they struck off the head of a Lavoisier or a 
Ch&eacute;nier. 
</p><p>This hatred of superiority, the most prominent element in 
the modern progress of Socialism, is not the only characteristic 
of the new spirit created by democratic ideas. 
</p><p>Other consequences, although indirect, are not less 
profound.  Such, for example, are the progress of 
&ldquo;statism,&rdquo; the diminution of the power of the 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, the increasing activity of financiers, the 
conflict of the classes, the vanishing of the old social 
constraints, and the degradation of morality. 
</p><p>All these effects are displayed in a general 
insubordination and anarchy.  The son revolts against the 
father, the employee against his patron, the soldier 
against his officers.  Discontent, hatred, and envy reign 
throughout. 
 
 
<pb n="306"/>  
 
</p><p>A social movement which continues is necessarily like a 
machine in movement which accelerates its motion.  We shall 
therefore find that the results of this mentality will become yet

more important.  It is betrayed from time to time by incidents 
whose gravity is daily increasing&mdash;railway strikes, postmen's 
strikes, explosions on board ironclads, &amp;c.  <hi rend="italic">A propos</hi> of 
the destruction of the <hi rend="italic">Libert&eacute;</hi>, which cost more 
than two million pounds and slew two hundred men in the space of 
a minute, an ex-Minister of Marine, M. de Lanessan, expresses 
himself as follows:&mdash; 
</p><p>The evil that is gnawing at our fleet is the same as that 
which is devouring our army, our public administrations, our 
parliamentary system, our governmental system, and the whole 
fabric of our society.  This evil is anarchy&mdash;that is to say, 
such a disorder of minds and things that nothing is done as 
reason would dictate, and no one behaves as his professional or 
moral duty should require him to behave.&rdquo; 
</p><p>On the subject of the catastrophe of the 
<hi rend="italic">Libert&eacute;</hi>, which followed that of the 
<hi rend="italic">I&eacute;na</hi>, M. Felix Roussel said, in a speech delivered 
as president of the municipal council of Paris:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The causes of the evil are not peculiar to our day. 
The evil is more general, and bears a triple name: 
irresponsibility, indiscipline, and anarchy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>These quotations, which state facts with which everyone is

familiar, show that the staunchest upholders of the republican 
system themselves recognise the progress of social 
disorganisation.<ref target="n12">12</ref>  Everyone 
 
 
<pb n="307"/>  
sees it, while he is conscious of his own impotence to change 
anything.  It results, in fact, from mental influences whose 
power is greater than that of our wills. 
 </p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d126"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Universal Suffrage and its 
Representatives</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Among the dogmas of democracy perhaps the most fundamental of 
all and the most attractive is that of universal suffrage.  It 
gives the masses the idea of equality, since for a moment at 
least rich and poor, learned and ignorant, are equal before the 
electoral urn.  The minister elbows the least of his servants, 
and during this brief moment the power of one is as great as the 
others. 
</p><p>All Governments, including that of the Revolution, have 
feared universal suffrage.  At a first glance, indeed, the 
objections which suggests themselves are numerous.  The idea that

the multitude could usefully choose the men capable of governing,

that individuals of indifferent morality, feeble knowledge, and 
narrow 
 
 
<pb n="308"/>  
 
minds should possess, by the sole fact of number, a certain 
talent for judging the candidate proposed for its selection is 
surely a shocking one. 
</p><p>From a rational point of view the suffrage of numbers is 
to a certain extent justified if we think with Pascal. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Plurality is the best way, because it is visible and 
has strength to make itself obeyed; it is, however, the advice of

the less able.&rdquo; 
</p><p>As universal suffrage cannot in our times be replaced by 
any other institution, we must accept it and try to adapt it.  It

is accordingly useless to protest against it or to repeat with 
the queen Marie Caroline, at the time of her struggle with 
Napoleon:  &ldquo;Nothing is more dreadful than to govern men in 
this enlightened century, when every cobbler reasons and 
criticises the Government.&rdquo; 
</p><p>To tell the truth, the objections are not always as great 
as they appear.  The laws of the psychology of crowds being 
admitted, it is very doubtful whether a limited suffrage would 
give a much better choice of men than that obtained by universal 
suffrage. 
</p><p>These same psychological laws also show us that so-called 
universal suffrage is in reality a pure fiction.  The crowd, save

in very rare cases, has no opinion but that of its leaders. 
Universal suffrage really represents the most limited of 
suffrages. 
</p><p>There justly resides its real danger.  Universal suffrage 
is made dangerous by the fact that the leaders who are its 
masters are the creatures of little local committees analogous to

the clubs of the Revolution.  The leader who canvasses for a 
mandate is chosen by them. 
 
 
<pb n="309"/>  
 
</p><p>Once nominated, he exercises an absolute local power, on 
condition of satisfying the interests of his committees.  Before 
this necessity the general interest of the country disappears 
almost totally from the mind of the elected representative. 
</p><p>Naturally the committees, having need of docile servants, 
do not choose for this task individuals gifted with a lofty 
intelligence nor, above all, with a very high morality.  They 
must have men without character, without social position, and 
always docile. 
</p><p>By reason of these necessities the servility of the deputy

in respect of these little groups which patronise him, and 
without which he would be no one, is absolute.  He will speak and

vote just as his committee tells him.  His political ideal may be

expressed in a few words: it is to obey, that he may retain his 
post. 
</p><p>Sometimes, rarely indeed, and only when by name or 
position or wealth he has a great prestige, a superior character 
may impose himself upon the popular vote by overcoming the 
tyranny of the impudent minorities which constitute the local 
committees. 
</p><p>Democratic countries like France are only apparently 
governed by universal suffrage.  For this reason is it that so 
many measures are passed which do not interest the people and 
which the people never demanded.  Such were the purchase of the 
Western railways, the laws respecting congregations, &amp;c.  These 
absurd manifestations merely translated the demands of fanatical 
local committees, and were imposed upon deputies whom they had 
chosen. 
</p><p>We may judge of the influence of these committees when we 
see moderate deputies forced to 
 
 
<pb n="310"/>  
patronise the anarchical destroyers of arsenals, to ally 
themselves with anti-militarists, and, in a word, to obey the 
most atrocious demands in order to ensure re-election.  The will 
of the lowest elements of democracy has thus created among the 
elected representatives manners and a morality which we can but 
recognise are of the lowest.  The politician is the man in public

employment, and as Nietzsche says:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;Where public employment begins there begins also the 
clamour of the great comedians and the buzzing of venomous 
flies. . . .  The comedian always believes in that which makes 
him obtain his best effects, in that which impels the people to 
believe in him.  To-morrow he will have a new faith, and the day 
after to-morrow yet another. . . .  All that is great has its 
being far from public employment and glory.&rdquo; 
</p> 
</div4> 
 
<div4 type="section" n="4" id="d127"> 
<head>4.  <hi rend="italic">The Craving for Reforms</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The craze for reforms imposed suddenly by means of decrees is 
one of the most disastrous conceptions of the Jacobin spirit, one

of the formidable legacies left by the Revolution.  It is among 
the principal factors of all the incessant political upheavals of

the last century in France. 
</p><p>One of the psychological causes of this intense thirst for

reforms arises from the difficulty of determining the real causes

of the evils complained of.  The need of explanation creates 
fictitious causes of the simplest nature.  Therefore the remedies

also appear simple. 
</p><p>For forty years we have incessantly been passing reforms, 
each of which is a little revolution in itself.  In spite of all 
these, or rather because of them, the 
 
 
<pb n="311"/>  
French have evolved almost as little as any race in Europe. 
</p><p>The slowness of our actual evolution may be seen if we 
compare the principal elements of our social life&mdash;commerce, 
industry, &amp;c.&mdash;with those of other nations.  The progress of 
other nations&mdash;of the Germans especially&mdash;then appears enormous, 
while our own has been very slow. 
</p><p>Our administrative, industrial, and commercial 
organisation is considerably out of date, and is no longer equal 
to our new needs.  Our industry is not prospering; our marine is 
declining.  Even in our own colonies we cannot compete with 
foreign countries, despite the enormous pecuniary subventions 
accorded by the State.  M. Cruppi, an ex-Minister of Commerce, 
has insisted on this melancholy decline in a recent book. 
Falling into the usual errors, he believed it easy to remedy this

inferiority by new laws. 
</p><p>All politicians share the same opinion, which is why we 
progress so slowly.  Each party is persuaded that by means of 
reforms all evils could be remedied.  This conviction results in 
struggles such as have made France the most divided country in 
the world and the most subject to anarchy. 
</p><p>No one yet seems to understand that individuals and their 
methods, not regulations, make the value of a people.  The 
efficacious reforms are not the revolutionary reforms but the 
trifling ameliorations of every day accumulated in course of 
time.  The great social changes, like the great geological 
changes, are effected by the daily addition of minute causes. 
The economic history of Germany 
 
 
<pb n="312"/>  
during the last forty years proves in a striking manner the truth

of this law. 
</p><p>Many important events which seem to depend more or less on

hazard&mdash;as battles, for example&mdash;are themselves subject to this 
law of the accumulation of small causes.  No doubt the decisive 
struggle is sometimes terminated in a day or less, but many 
minute efforts, slowly accumulated, are essential to victory.  We

had a painful experience of this in 1870, and the Russians have 
learned it more recently.  Barely half an hour did Admiral Togo 
need to annihilate the Russian fleet, at the battle of Tsushima, 
which finally decided the fate of Japan, but thousands of little 
factors, small and remote, determined that success.  Causes not 
less numerous engendered the defeat of the Russians&mdash;a 
bureaucracy as complicated as ours, and as irresponsible; 
lamentable material, although paid for by its weight in gold; a 
system of graft at every degree of the social hierarchy, and 
general indifference to the interests of the country. 
</p><p>Unhappily the progress in little things which by their 
total make up the greatness of a nation is rarely apparent, 
produces no impression on the public, and cannot serve the 
interests of politicians at elections.  These latter care nothing

for such matters, and permit the accumulation, in the countries 
subject to their influence, of the little successive 
disorganisations which finally result in great downfalls. 
</p>

<div4 type="section" n="5" id="d128"> 
<head>5.  <hi rend="italic">Social Distinctions in Democracies and Democratic 
Ideas in Various Countries</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>When men were divided into castes and differentiated chiefly 
by birth, social distinctions were 
 
 
<pb n="313"/>  
generally accepted as the consequences of an unavoidable natural 
law. 
</p><p>As soon as the old social divisions were destroyed the 
distinctions of the classes appeared artificial, and for that 
reason ceased to be tolerated. 
</p><p>The necessity of equality being theoretical, we have seen 
among democratic peoples the rapid development of artificial 
inequalities, permitting their possessors to make for themselves 
a plainly visible supremacy.  Never was the thirst for titles and

decorations so general as to-day. 
</p><p>In really democratic countries, such as the United States,

titles and decorations do not exert much influence, and fortune 
alone creates distinctions.  It is only by exception that we see 
wealthy young American girls allying themselves to the old names 
of the European aristocracy.  They are then instinctively 
employing the only means which will permit a young race to 
acquire a past that will establish its moral framework. 
</p><p>But in a general fashion the aristocracy that we see 
springing up in America is by no means founded on titles and 
decorations.  Purely financial, it does not provoke much 
jealousy, because every one hopes one day to form part of it. 
</p><p>When, in his book on democracy in America, Toqueville 
spoke of the general aspiration towards equality he did not 
realise that the prophesied equality would end in the 
classification of men founded exclusively on the number of 
dollars possessed by them.  No other exists in the United States,

and it will doubtless one day be the same in Europe. 
 
 
<pb n="314"/>  
 
</p><p>At present we cannot possibly regard France as a 
democratic country save on paper, and here we feel the necessity,

already referred to, of examining the various ideas which in 
different countries are expressed by the word 
&ldquo;democracy.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Of truly democratic nations we can practically mention 
only England and the United States.  There, democracy occurs in 
different forms, but the same principles are observed&mdash;notably, a

perfect toleration of all opinions.  Religious persecutions are 
unknown.  Real superiority easily reveals itself in the various 
professions which any one can enter at any age if he possesses 
the necessary capacity.  There is no barrier to individual 
effort. 
</p><p>In such countries men believe themselves equal because all

have the idea that they are free to attain the same position. 
The workman knows he can become foreman, and then engineer. 
Forced to begin on the lower rungs of the ladder instead of high 
up the scale, as in France, the engineer does not regard himself 
as made of different stuff to the rest of mankind.  It is the 
same in all professions.  This is why the class hatred, so 
intense in Europe, is so little developed in England and America.

</p><p>In France the democracy is practically non-existent save 
in speeches.  A system of competitions and examinations, which 
must be worked through in youth, firmly closes the door upon the 
liberal professions, and creates inimical and separate classes. 
</p><p>The Latin democracies are therefore purely theoretical. 
The absolutism of the State has replaced monarchical absolutism, 
but it is no less severe.  The 
 
 
<pb n="315"/>  
aristocracy of fortune has replaced that of birth, and its 
privileges are no less considerable. 
</p><p>Monarchies and democracies differ far more in form than in

substance.  It is only the variable mentality of men that varies 
their effects.  All the discussions as to various systems of 
government are really of no interest, for these have no special 
virtue of themselves.  Their value will always depend on that of 
the people governed.  A people effects great and rapid progress 
when it discovers that it is the sum of the personal efforts of 
each individual and not the system of government that determines 
the rank of a nation in the world.

THE NEW FORMS OF DEMOCRATIC BELIEF

<div4 type="section" n="1" id="d130"> 
<head>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Conflict between Capital and Labour</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>WHILE our legislators are reforming and legislating at hazard,

the natural evolution of the world is slowly pursuing its course.

New interests arise, the economic competition between nation and 
nation increases in severity, the working-classes are bestirring 
themselves, and on all sides we see the birth of formidable 
problems which the harangues of the politicians will never 
resolve. 
</p><p>Among these new problems one of the most complicated will 
be the problem of the conflict between labour and capital.  It is

becoming acute even in such a country of tradition as England. 
Workingmen are ceasing to respect the collective contracts which 
formerly constituted their charter, strikes are declared for 
insignificant motives, and unemployment and pauperism are 
attaining disquieting proportions. 
</p><p>In America these strikes would finally have affected all 
industries but that the very excess of the evil created a remedy.

During the last ten years the industrial leaders have organised 
great employers' federations, which have become powerful enough 
to force the workers to submit to arbitration. 
</p><p>The labour question is complicated in France by 
 
 
<pb n="317"/>  
the intervention of numerous foreign workers, which the 
stagnation of our population has rendered 
necessary.<ref target="n13">13</ref>  This 
stagnation will also make it difficult for France to contend with 
her rivals, whose soil will soon no longer be able to nourish its 
inhabitants, who, following one of the oldest laws of history, 
will necessarily invade the less densely peopled countries. 
</p><p>These conflicts between the workers and employers of the 
same nation will be rendered still more acute by the increasing 
economic struggle between the Asiatics, whose needs are small, 
and who can therefore produce manufactured articles at very low 
prices, and the Europeans, whose needs are many.  For twenty-five

years I have laid stress upon this point.  General Hamilton, ex-military attach&eacute; to the Japanese army, who foresaw the 
Japanese victories long before the outbreak of hostilities, 
writes as follows in an essay translated by General Langlois:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Chinaman, such as I have seen him in Manchuria, 
is capable of destroying the present type of worker of the white 
races.  He will drive him off the face of the earth.  The 
Socialists, who preach equality to the labourer, are far from 
thinking what would be the practical result of carrying out their

theories.  Is it, then, the destiny of the white races to 
disappear in the long run?  In my humble opinion 
 
 
<pb n="318"/>  
this destiny depends upon one single factor:  Shall we or shall 
we not have the good sense to close our ears to speeches which 
present war and preparation for war as a useless evil? 
</p><p>&ldquo;I believe the workers must choose.  Given the present

constitution of the world, they must cultivate in their children 
the military ideal, and accept gracefully the cost and trouble 
which militarism entails, or they will be let in for a cruel 
struggle for life with a rival worker of whose success there is 
not the slightest doubt.  There is only one means of refusing 
Asiatics the right to emigrate, to lower wages by competition, 
and to live in our midst, and that is the sword.  If Americans 
and Europeans forget that their privileged position is held only 
by force of arms, Asia will soon have taken her revenge.&rdquo; 
</p><p>We know that in America the invasion of Chinese and 
Japanese, owing to the competition between them and the workers 
of white race, has become a national calamity.  In Europe the 
invasion is commencing, but has not as yet gone far.  But already

Chinese emigrants have formed important colonies in certain 
centres&mdash;London, Cardiff, Liverpool, &amp;c.  They have provoked 
several riots by working for low wages.  Their appearance has 
always lowered salaries. 
</p><p>But these problems belong to the future, and those of the 
present are so disquieting that it is useless at the moment to 
occupy ourselves with others.

<head>2.  <hi rend="italic">The Evolution of the Working-Classes and the 
Syndicalist Movement</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>The most important democratic problem of the day will perhaps 
result from the recent development of the 
 
 
<pb n="319"/>  
working-class engendered by the Syndicalist or Trades Union 
movement. 
</p><p>The aggregation of similar interests known as Syndicalism 
has rapidly assumed such enormous developments in all countries 
that it may be called world-wide.  Certain corporations have 
budgets comparable to those of small States.  Some German leagues

have been cited as having saved over three millions sterling in 
subscriptions. 
</p><p>The extension of the labour movement in all countries 
shows that it is not, like Socialism, a dream of Utopian 
theorists, but the result of economic necessities.  In its aim, 
its means of action, and its tendencies, Syndicalism presents no 
kinship with Socialism.  Having sufficiently explained it in my 
<hi rend="italic">Political Psychology</hi>, it will suffice here to recall in a 
few words the difference between the two doctrines. 
</p><p>Socialism would obtain possession of all industries, and 
have them managed by the State, which would distribute the 
products equally between the citizens.  Syndicalism, on the other

hand, would entirely eliminate the action of the State, and 
divide society into small professional groups which would be 
self-governing. 
</p><p>Although despised by the Syndicalists and violently 
attacked by them, the Socialists are trying to ignore the 
conflict, but it is rapidly becoming too obvious to be concealed.

The political influence which the Socialists still possess will 
soon escape them. 
</p><p>If Syndicalism is everywhere increasing at the expense of 
Socialism, it is, I repeat, because this corporative movement, 
although a renewal of the past, 
 
 
<pb n="320"/>  
synthetises certain needs born of the specialisation of modern 
industry. 
</p><p>We see its manifestations under a great variety of 
circumstances.  In France its success has not as yet been as 
great as elsewhere.  Having taken the revolutionary form already 
mentioned, it has fallen, at least for the time being, into the 
hands of the anarchists, who care as little for Syndicalism as 
for any sort of organisation, and are simply using the new 
doctrine in an attempt to destroy modern society.  Socialists, 
Syndicalists, and anarchists, although directed by entirely 
different conceptions, are thus collaborating in the same 
eventual aim&mdash;the violent suppression of the ruling classes and 
the pillage of their wealth. 
</p><p>The Syndicalist doctrine does not in any way derive from 
the principles of Revolution.  On many points it is entirely in 
contradiction with the Revolution.  Syndicalism represents rather

a return to certain forms of collective organisation similar to 
the guilds or corporations proscribed by the Revolution.  It thus

constitutes one of those federations which the Revolution 
condemned.  It entirely rejects the State centralisation which 
the Revolution established. 
</p><p>Syndicalism cares nothing for the democratic principles of

liberty, equality, and fraternity.  The Syndicalists demand of 
their members an absolute discipline which eliminates all 
liberty. 
</p><p>Not being as yet strong enough to exercise mutual tyranny,

the syndicates so far profess sentiments in respect of one 
another which might by a stretch be called fraternal.  But as 
soon as they are sufficiently powerful, when their contrary 
interests will necessarily 
 
 
<pb n="321"/>  
enter into conflict, as during the Syndicalist period of the old 
Italian republics&mdash;Florence and Siena, for example&mdash;the present 
fraternity will speedily be forgotten, and equality will be 
replaced by the despotism of the most powerful. 
</p><p>Such a future seems near at hand.  The new power is 
increasing very rapidly, and finds the Governments powerless 
before it, able to defend themselves only by yielding to every 
demand&mdash;an odious policy, which may serve for the moment, but 
which heavily compromises the future. 
</p><p>It was, however, to this poor recourse that the English 
Government recently resorted in its struggle against the Miners' 
Union, which threatened to suspend the industrial life of 
England.  The Union demanded a minimum wage for its members, but 
they were not bound to furnish a minimum of work. 
</p><p>Although such a demand was inadmissible, the Government 
agreed to propose to Parliament a law to sanction such a measure.

We may profitably read the weighty words pronounced by Mr. 
Balfour before the House of Commons:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The country has never in its so long and varied 
history had to face a danger of this nature and this importance. 
</p><p>&ldquo;We are confronted with the strange and sinister 
spectacle of a mere organisation threatening to paralyse&mdash;and 
paralysing in a large measure&mdash;the commerce and manufactures of a

community which lives by commerce and manufacture. 
</p><p>&ldquo;The power possessed by the miners is in the present 
state of the law almost unlimited.  Have we ever seen the like of

it?  Did ever feudal baron exert 
 
 
<pb n="322"/>  
a comparable tyranny?  Was there ever an American trust which 
served the rights which it holds from the law with such contempt 
of the general interest?  The very degree of perfection to which 
we have brought our laws, our social organisation, the mutual 
relation between the various professions and industries, exposes 
us more than our predecessors in ruder ages to the grave peril 
which at present threatens society. . . .  We are witnesses at 
the present moment of the first manifestation of the power of 
elements which, if we are not heedful, will submerge the whole of

society. . . .  The attitude of the Government in yielding to the

injunction of the miners gives some appearance of reality to the 
victory of those who are pitting themselves against society.&rdquo;

<div4 type="section" n="3" id="d132"> 
<head>3.  <hi rend="italic">Why certain modern Democratic Governments are 
gradually being transformed into Governments by Administrative 
Castes</hi>.</head> 
 
<p>Anarchy and the social conflicts resulting from democratic 
ideas are to-day impelling some Governments towards an unforeseen

course of evolution which will end by leaving them only a nominal

power.  This development, of which I shall briefly denote the 
effects, is effected spontaneously under the stress of those 
imperious necessities which are still the chief controlling power

of events. 
</p><p>The Governments of democratic countries to-day consist of 
the representatives elected by universal suffrage.  They vote 
laws, and appoint and dismiss ministers chosen from themselves, 
and provisionally entrusted with the executive power.  These 
ministers are naturally often replaced, since a vote will do it. 
 
 
<pb n="323"/>  
Those who follow them, belonging to a different party, will 
govern according to different principles. 
</p><p>It might at first seem that a country thus pulled to and 
fro by various influences could have no continuity or stability. 
But in spite of all these conditions of instability a democratic 
Government like that of France works with fair regularity.  How 
explain such a phenomenon? 
</p><p>Its interpretation, which is very simple, results from the

fact that the ministers who have the appearance of governing 
really govern the country only to a very limited extent. 
Strictly limited and circumscribed, their power is exercised 
principally in speeches which are hardly noticed and in a few 
inorganic measures. 
</p><p>But behind the superficial authority of ministers, without

force or duration, the playthings of every demand of the 
politician, an anonymous power is secretly at work whose might is

continually increasing the administrations.  Possessing 
traditions, a hierarchy, and continuity, they are a power against

which, as the ministers quickly realise, they are incapable of 
struggling.<ref target="n14">14</ref>  Responsibility is so divided in
the administrative machine that a minister may never find himself

opposed by any person of importance.  His momentary impulses are 
checked by a network of regulations, customs, and decrees, which 
are continually quoted to him, and which he knows so little that 
he dare not infringe them. 
</p><p>This diminution of the power of democratic Governments 
 
 
<pb n="324"/>  
can only develop.  One of the most constant laws of history is 
that of which I have already spoken:  Immediately any one class 
becomes preponderant&mdash;nobles, clergy, army, or the people&mdash;it 
speedily tends to enslave others.  Such were the Roman armies, 
which finally appointed and overthrew the emperors; such were the

clergy, against whom the kings of old could hardly struggle; such

were the States General, which at the moment of Revolution 
speedily absorbed all the powers of government, and supplanted 
the monarchy. 
</p><p>The caste of functionaries is destined to furnish a fresh 
proof of the truth of this law.  Preponderant already, they are 
beginning to speak loudly, to make threats, and even to indulge 
in strikes, such as that of the postmen, which was quickly 
followed by that of the Government railway employees.  The 
administrative power thus forms a little State within the State, 
and if its present rate of revolution continues it will soon 
constitute the only power in the State.  Under a Socialist 
Government there would be no other power.  All our revolutions 
would then have resulted in stripping the king of his powers and 
his throne in order to bestow them upon the irresponsible, 
anonymous and despotic class of Government clerks. 
</p><p>To foresee the issue of all the conflicts which threaten 
to cloud the future is impossible.  We must steer clear of 
pessimism as of optimism; all we can say is that necessity will 
always finally bring things to an equilibrium.  The world pursues

its way without bothering itself with our speeches, and sooner or

later we manage to adapt ourselves to the variations of our 
environment.  The difficulty is to do so without too 
 
 
<pb n="325"/>  
much friction, and above all to resist the chimerical conceptions

of dreamers.  Always powerless to re-organise the world, they 
have often contrived to upset it. 
</p><p>Athens, Rome, Florence, and many other cities which 
formerly shone in history, were victims of these terrible 
theorists.  The results of their influence has always been the 
same&mdash;anarchy, dictatorship, and decadence. 
</p><p>But such lessons will not affect the numerous Catilines of

the present day.  They do not yet see that the movements 
unchained by their ambitions threaten to submerge them.  All 
these Utopians have awakened impossible hopes in the mind of the 
crowd, excited their appetites, and sapped the dykes which have 
been slowly erected during the centuries to restrain them. 
</p><p>The struggle of the blind multitudes against the elect is 
one of the continuous facts of history, and the triumph of 
popular sovereignties without counterpoise has already marked the

end of more than one civilisation.  The elect create, the plebs 
destroys.  As soon as the first lose their hold the latter begins

its precious work. 
</p><p>The great civilisations have only prospered by dominating 
their lower elements.  It is not only in Greece that anarchy, 
dictatorship, invasion, and, finally, the loss of independence 
has resulted from the despotism of a democracy.  Individual 
tyranny is always born of collective tyranny.  It ended the first

cycle of the greatness of Rome; the Barbarians achieved the 
second.

<head>CONCLUSIONS</head> 
 
<p>THE principal revolutions of history have been studied in this

volume.  But we have dealt more especially with the most 
important of all&mdash;that which for more than twenty years 
overwhelmed all Europe, and whose echoes are still to be heard. 
</p><p>The French Revolution is an inexhaustible mine of 
psychological documents.  No period of the life of humanity has 
presented such a mass of experience, accumulated in so short a 
time. 
</p><p>On each page of this great drama we have found numerous 
applications of the principles expounded in my various works, 
concerning the transitory mentality of crowds and the permanent 
soul of the peoples, the action of beliefs, the influence of 
mystic, affective, and collective elements, and the conflict 
between the various forms of logic. 
</p><p>The Revolutionary Assemblies illustrate all the known laws

of the psychology of crowds.  Impulsive and timid, they are 
dominated by a small number of leaders, and usually act in a 
sense contrary to the wishes of their individual members. 
</p><p>The Royalist Constituent Assembly destroyed an ancient 
monarchy; the humanitarian Legislative Assembly allowed the 
massacres of September.  The same pacific body led France into 
the most formidable campaigns. 
 
 
<pb n="327"/>  
 
</p><p>There were similar contradictions during the Convention. 
The immense majority of its members abhorred violence. 
Sentimental philosophers, they exalted equality, fraternity, and 
liberty, yet ended by exerting the most terrible despotism. 
</p><p>The same contradictions were visible during the Directory.

Extremely moderate in their intentions at the outset, the 
Assemblies were continually effecting bloodthirsty <hi rend="italic">coups 
d'&eacute;tat</hi>.  They wished to re-establish religious peace, 
and finally sent thousands of priests into imprisonment.  They 
wished to repair the ruins which covered France, and only 
succeeded in adding to them. 
</p><p>Thus there was always a complete contradiction between the

individual wills of the men of the revolutionary period and the 
deeds of the Assemblies of which they were units. 
</p><p>The truth is that they obeyed invisible forces of which 
they were not the masters.  Believing that they acted in the name

of pure reason, they were really subject to mystic, affective, 
and collective influences, incomprehensible to them, and which we

are only to-day beginning to understand. 
 
</p><p>Intelligence has progressed in the course of the ages, and

has opened a marvellous outlook to man, although his character, 
the real foundation of his mind, and the sure motive of his 
actions, has scarcely changed.  Overthrown one moment, it re-appears the next.  Human nature must be accepted as it is. 
</p><p>The founders of the Revolution did not resign themselves 
to the facts of human nature.  For the 
 
 
<pb n="328"/>  
first time in the history of humanity they attempted to transform

men and society in the name of reason. 
</p><p>Never was any undertaking commenced with such chances of 
success.  The theorists, who claimed to effect it, had a power in

their hands greater than that of any despot. 
</p><p>Yet, despite this power, despite the success of the 
armies, despite Draconian laws and repeated <hi rend="italic">coups 
d'&eacute;tat</hi>, the Revolution merely heaped ruin upon ruin, 
and ended in a dictatorship. 
</p><p>Such an attempt was not useless, since experience is 
necessary to the education of the peoples.  Without the 
Revolution it would have been difficult to prove that pure reason

does not enable us to change human nature, and, consequently, 
that no society can be rebuilt by the will of legislators, 
however absolute their power. 
</p><p>Commenced by the middle classes for their own profit, the 
Revolution speedily became a popular movement, and at the same 
time a struggle of the instinctive against the rational, a revolt

against all the constraints which make civilisation out of 
barbarism.  It was by relying on the principle of popular 
sovereignty that the reformers attempted to impose their 
doctrines.  Guided by leaders, the people intervened incessantly 
in the deliberations of the Assemblies, and committed the most 
sanguinary acts of violence. 
</p><p>The history of the multitudes during the Revolution is 
eminently instructive.  It shows the error of the politicians who

attribute all the virtues to the popular soul. 
 
 
<pb n="329"/>  
 
</p><p>The facts of the Revolution teach us, on the contrary, 
that a people freed from social constraints, the foundations of 
civilisation, and abandoned to its instinctive impulses, speedily

relapses into its ancestral savagery.  Every popular revolution 
which succeeds in triumphing is a temporary return to barbarism. 
If the Commune of 1871 had lasted, it would have repeated the 
Terror.  Not having the power to kill so many people, it had to 
confine itself to burning the principal monuments of the capital.

</p><p>The Revolution represents the conflict of psychological 
forces liberated from the bonds whose function it is to restrain 
them.  Popular instincts, Jacobin beliefs, ancestral influences, 
appetites, and passions unloosed, all these various influences 
engaged in a furious mutual conflict for the space of ten years, 
during which time they soaked France in blood and covered the 
land with ruins. 
</p><p>Seen from a distance, this seems to be the whole upshot of

the Revolution.  There was nothing homogeneous about it.  One 
must resort to analysis before one can understand and grasp the 
great drama and display the impulses which continually actuated 
its heroes.  In normal times we are guided by the various forms 
of logic&mdash;rational, affective, collective, and mystic&mdash;which more

or less perfectly balance one another.  During seasons of 
upheaval they enter into conflict, and man is no longer himself. 
 
</p><p>We have by no means undervalued in this work the 
importance of certain acquisitions of the Revolution in respect 
of the rights of the people.  But with many 
 
 
<pb n="330"/>  
other historians, we are forced to admit that the prize gained at

the cost of such ruin and bloodshed would have been obtained at a

later date without effort, by the mere progress of civilisation. 
For a few years gained, what a load of material disaster, what 
moral disintegration!  We are still suffering as a result of the 
latter.  These brutal pages in the book of history will take long

to efface: they are not effaced as yet. 
</p><p>Our young men of to-day seem to prefer action to thought. 
Disdaining the sterile dissertations of the philosophers, they 
take no interest in vain speculation concerning matters whose 
essential nature remains unknown. 
</p><p>Action is certainly an excellent thing, and all real 
progress is a result of action, but it is only useful when 
properly directed.  The men of the Revolution were assuredly men 
of action, yet the illusions which they accepted as guides led 
them to disaster. 
</p><p>Action is always hurtful when, despising realities, it 
professes violently to change the course of events.  One cannot 
experiment with society as with apparatus in a laboratory.  Our 
political upheavals show us what such social errors may cost. 
</p><p>Although the lesson of the Revolution was extremely 
categorical, many unpractical spirits, hallucinated by their 
dreams, are hoping to recommence it.  Socialism, the modern 
synthesis of this hope, would be a regression to lower forms of 
evolution, for it would paralyse the greatest sources of our 
activity.  By replacing individual initiative and responsibility 
by collective initiative and responsibility mankind would descend

several steps on the scale of human values. 
 
 
<pb n="331"/>  
 
</p><p>The present time is hardly favourable to such experiments.

While dreamers are pursuing their dreams, exciting appetites and 
the passions of the multitude, the peoples are every day arming 
themselves more powerfully.  All feel that amid the universal 
competition of the present time there is no room for weak 
nations. 
</p><p>In the centre of Europe a formidable military Power is 
increasing in strength, and aspiring to dominate the world, in 
order to find outlets for its goods, and for an increasing 
population, which it will soon be unable to nourish. 
</p><p>If we continue to shatter our cohesion by intestine 
struggles, party rivalries, base religious persecutions, and laws

which fetter industrial development, our part in the world will 
soon be over.  We shall have to make room for peoples more 
solidly knit, who have been able to adapt themselves to natural 
necessities instead of pretending to turn back upon their course.

The present does not repeat the past, and the details of history 
are full of unforeseen consequences; but in their main lines 
events are conditioned by eternal laws.

<note place="foot" id="n1"><seg type="note-symbol">The</seg> <p>doctrine of predestination is 
still taught in Protestant 
catechisms, as is proved by the following passage

which I sent to Edinburgh: 
</p><p>&ldquo;By the decree of God, for the manifestation of His 
glory, some men and angels are predestinated unto everlasting 
life, and others foreordained to everlasting death. 
</p><p>&ldquo;These angels and men, thus predestinated and 
foreordained, are particularly and unchangeably designed; and 
their number is so certain and definite that it cannot be either 
increased or diminished. 
</p><p>&ldquo;Those of mankind that are predestinated unto life, 
God, before the foundation of the world was laid, according to 
His eternal and immutable purpose, and the secret counsel and 
good pleasure of His will, hath chosen in Christ unto everlasting 
glory, out of His mere free grace and love, without any foresight 
of faith or good works, or perseverance in either of them, or any 
other thing in the creature, as conditions, or causes moving him 
thereunto; and all to the praise of his glorious grace. 
</p><p>&ldquo;As God hath appointed the elect unto glory, so hath 
He, by the eternal and most free purpose of His will, 
foreordained all the means thereunto.  Wherefore they who are 
elected being fallen in Adam, are redeemed by Christ; are 
effectually called unto faith in Christ by His spirit working in 
due season; are justified, adopted, sanctified, and kept by His 
power through faith unto salvation.  Neither are any other 
redeemed by Christ, effectually called, justified, adopted,

Professor Glosson and published in the <hi rend="italic">Revue Scientifique</hi>

</p><p>&ldquo;I prepared a bottle filled with distilled water 
carefully wrapped in cotton and packed in a box.  After several

asked those present to raise their hands the moment they 
perceived the odour. . . .  I took out the bottle and poured the 
water on the cotton, turning my head away during the operation, 
then took up a stop-watch and awaited the result. . . .  I 
explained that I was absolutely sure that no one present had ever

smelt the odour of the chemical composition I had spilt. . . . 
At the end of fifteen seconds the majority of those in front had 
held up their hands, and in forty seconds the odour had reached 
the back of the hall by fairly regular waves.  About three&mdash; 
quarters of those present declared that they perceived the odour.

A larger number would doubtless have succumbed to suggestion, if 
at the end of a minute I had not been forced to stop the

ill at Metz, it was night.  People got up and ran tumultuously 
hither and thither without knowing where they were going; the 
churches were opened in the middle of the night . . . people 
assembled at every cross-road, jostling and questioning one 
another without knowing what they were after.  In several 
churches the priest who was reciting the prayer for the king's 
health was stopped by his tears, and the people replied by sobs 
and cries. . . .  The courier who brought the news of his 
convalescence was embraced and almost stifled; people kissed his 
horse, and led him in triumph. . . .  Every street resounded with

a cry of joy:  `The king is healed.' &rdquo;</p></note> 
 
<note place="foot" id="n9"><seg type="note-symbol">Napoleon</seg> <p>naturally often overruled the Council of 
State, but by no means always did so.  In one instance, reported 
in the <hi rend="italic">M&eacute;morial de Sainte-H&eacute;lene</hi>, he was the

only one of his own opinion, and accepted that of the majority in

the following terms:  &ldquo;Gentlemen, matters are decided here by

majority, and being alone, I must give way; but I declare that in

my conscience I yield only to form.  You have reduced me to 
silence, but in no way convinced me.&rdquo; 
</p><p>Another day the Emperor, interrupted three times in the 
expression of his opinion, addressed himself to the speaker who 
had just interrupted him:  &ldquo;Sir, I have not yet finished; I 
beg you to allow me to continue.  After all, it seems to me that 
every one has a perfect right to express his opinion here.&rdquo; 
</p><p>&ldquo;The Emperor, contrary to the accepted opinion, was so

far from absolute, and so easy with his Council of State, that he

often resumed a discussion, or even annulled a decision, because 
one of the members of the Council had since, in private, given 
him fresh reasons, or had urged that the Emperor's personal 
opinion had influenced the majority.&rdquo;</p></note> 
 
<note place="foot" id="n10"><seg type="note-symbol">We</seg> <p>may judge of the recent evolution of ideas upon 
this point by the following passage from a speech by M. 
Jaur&eacute;s, delivered in the Chamber of Deputies:  &ldquo;The 
greatness of to-day is built of the efforts of past centuries. 
France is not contained in a day nor in an epoch, but in the 
succession of all days, all periods, all her twilights and all 
her dawns.&rdquo;</p></note> 
 
<note place="foot" id="n11"><seg type="note-symbol">After</seg> <p>the publication of an article of mine 
concerning legislative illusions, I received from one of our most 
eminent politicians, M. Boudenot the senator, a letter from which 
I extract the following passage:  &ldquo;Twenty years passed in the 
Chamber and the Senate have shown me how right you are.  How many 
times I have heard my colleagues say:  `The Government ought to 
prevent this, order that,' &amp;c.  What would you have? there are 
fourteen centuries of monarchical atavism in our blood.&rdquo; 
</p></note> 
 
<note place="foot" id="n12"><seg type="note-symbol">This</seg> <p>disorder is the same in all the Government 
departments Interesting examples will be found in a report of M. 
Dausset to the Municipal Council:&mdash; 

</p><p>&ldquo;The service of the public highways, which ought above 
all to be noted for its rapid execution, is, on the contrary, the 
very type of red-tape, bureaucratic, and ink-slinging 
administration, possessing men and money and wasting both in 
tasks which are often useless, for lack of order, initiative, and 
method&mdash;in a word, of organisation. 
</p><p>Speaking then of the directors of departments, each of 
whom works as he pleases, and after his own fashion, he adds:&mdash; 
</p><p>&ldquo;These important persons completely ignore one 
another; they prepare and execute their plans without knowing 
anything of what their neighbours are doing; there is no one 
above them to group and co-ordinate their work.&rdquo;  This is why 
a road is often torn up, repaired, and then torn up again a few 
days later, because the departments dealing with the supply of 
water, gas, electricity, and the sewers are mutually jealous, and 
never attempt to work together.  This anarchy and indiscipline 
naturally cost enormous sums of money, and a private firm which 
operated in this manner would soon find itself bankrupt.

<p>A discussion by a scholar of authority of 
those events which had a distinct formative 
influence upon the development of European 
States during the latter part of the nineteenth 
century, a period remarkable because of the 
great progress made by the people of Europe 
in their efforts to secure a larger measure of 
political freedom for the individual, and the 
legitimate development of the nation. 
</p><p>In his introductory chapter, Mr. Rose 
sketches briefly the main events leading up 
to 1870, and then in his later chapters considers 
the causes which led to the wonderful 
development of the last thirty years of the

<p>In this volume the author brings into light 
the ruling forces in all political life, ancient and 
modern alike.  The book serves to expound 
views of history which still require championing 
and to challenge the validity of formulas which 
are too complacently maintained. In the course 
of his survey the author presents the following 
topics:  &ldquo;Political Forces in Ancient History,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Economic Forces in Ancient History,&rdquo; &ldquo;Culture 
Forces in Antiquity,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Case of the 
Italian Republics,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Fortunes of the Lesser 
European States,&rdquo; &ldquo;English History till the

<p>Of books on the French Revolution there 
have been many, but Mr. Henderson's Symbol 
and Satire covers a field almost untouched.  It 
draws art into the service of history in a 
wholly original way.  Incidentally it gives a 
very full series, beautifully reproduced, of the 
extant broadsides, allegories, caricatures, and 
cartoons.  But the work is much more than a 
mere collection of illustrations.  Based mainly 
on original material and written with a keen 
eye for the dramatic, the book is likely to 
prove the most popular succinct history of the 
Revolution that has appeared since Carlyle. 
The results of modern research are embodied 
in it and it will prove as interesting to the 
student as to the general reader.
