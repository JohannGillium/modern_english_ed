<opener>Washington, <date value="1861-10-24">Oct. 24, 1861</date></opener>    
<p>Sir: The command of the Department of the West having devolved upon you,     
I propose to offer you a few <hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi>, knowing how hazzardous     
it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations,     
as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities &amp; passing events. It is     
intended therefore, to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment     
&amp; discretion.</p>    
<p>The main rebel army (Prices)<ref target="n5-1-2">2</ref> west of the Mississippi,     
is believed to have passed Dade county, in full retreat upon North-Western Arkansas,     
leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the South-East of the State.     
Assuming this basis of fact, it seems desireable, as you are not likely to overtake Price,     
and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements,     
that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army, divide it into two corps of    
observation, one occupying Sedalia, and the other Rolla, the present <hi rend="italic">termini</hi> of     
Railroads; then recruit the condition of both corps, by re-establishing, and improving,     
their discipline and instruction; perfecting their clothing and equipments, and providing     
less uncomfortable quarters. Of course both Railroads must be guarded, and kept open,     
judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this. From these two     
points, Sedalia and Rolla, and especially in judicious co-operation with     
Lane on the Kansas border, it would be so easy to concentrate,     
and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri from the South-West, that it is not     
probable any such attempt to return will be made before, or during, the approaching     
cold weather. Before spring the people of Missouri will be in no favorable mood to renew,     
for next year, the troubles which have so much afflicted, and impoverished them during this.</p>    
<p>If you adopt this line of policy, and if, as I anticipate, you will    
<pb n="2"/>    
    
see no enemy in great force approaching, you will have a surplus of force, which     
you can withdraw from these points and direct to others, as may be needed, the     
railroads furnishing ready means of re-inforcing these main points, if occasion     
requires. Doubtless local uprisings, for a time, will continue to occur; but     
these can be met by detachments, and local forces of our own, and will, ere     
long, tire out of themselves.</p>    
<p>While, as stated at the beginning of this letter, a large discretion must     
be, and is, left with yourself, I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price,     
or an attempt, by this long and circuitous route, to reach Memphis, will be     
exhaustive beyond endurance, and will end in the loss of the whole force     
engaged in it. Your Obt. Servt.</p>

DLC-RTL. The fragment in the Lincoln Papers is a portion of Lincoln's first     
draft beginning "on the Kansas border"and ending with the last words     
("tire out of themselves") in the next to last paragraph. Although     
Lincoln's letter to Curtis (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>) indicates that this letter     
to Hunter, as well as <hi rend="italic">General Orders No. 18</hi>, was to be enclosed,     
it seems evident that Lincoln decided to withhold it a few days, and in     
fact enclosed it in another letter to Curtis on October 28 (q.v. <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>). Lincoln's    
suggestions to Hunter originated in the War Department. A preliminary draft (DNA WR RG 94,    
Adjutant General, Letters Received, P 943) bearing Winfield Scott's endorsement ("It is hoped    
the President will modify freely the within. W.S.") is as follows:</p><p>"To Major Genl.    
Hunter, U.S. Volunteers. Washington, Oct. 24, 1861.</p>    
<p>"Sir: The command of the Department of the West, having, for a time,     
devolved upon you, I propose to offer you a few <hi rend="italic">suggestions</hi>, knowing     
how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific     
lines &amp; operations, as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities     
&amp; of passing events. It is intended, therefore, to leave a considerable     
margin for the exercise of your judgement &amp; discretion.</p>    
<p>"The main rebel army (Price's) west of the Mississippi, is believed to have     
passed Cedar county, in full retreat upon Southern Kansas &amp; the Indian country,     
leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy, excepting in the South-East of the State.     
Assuming this basis, it seems desirable, as you are not likely to overtake Price,     
that you should give up the pursuit, halt your main army; divide it into two     
corps of observation, one occupying Sedalia &amp; the other Rolla, the termini     
of rail roads; then recruit both corps, &amp; re-establish their discipline &amp;     
instruction. As you will probably, have a surplus of force after guarding those     
important points, that surplus would be disposable for other points---say     
the South Eastern part of the State &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>    
<p>"It is particularly expected of you to look into the many reported extravagancies &amp;     
abuses, in public money &amp; property, in your Department, to arrest any officer on evidence     
of probable guilt, &amp; to dismiss other faulty agents."</p></note>

<p>The within letter of the Secretary of the Navy, is written concerning the proposed

that I would submit it to the Secretary of the Interior, asking him, if he could spare

<note id="n5-2-1"><p>1 AES, DNA FI RG 56, General Records,     
Treasury Department, Series AB, 1861,     
Letters from Executive Officers, II, 5a. Lincoln's endorsement is written on the back     
of a letter from Gideon Welles, August 29, 1861, in which the secretary states he has not     
"the time necessary     
to investigate the subject of the proposed Chiriqui contract. . . . if any     
contract is to be made,     
it should be by some other officer than myself. . . ."The presence of     
this letter among the records of the Treasury     
Department arises from the fact of its later referral there. Chase wrote Lincoln on November 12,    
"I have given the Chiriqui     
business all the consideration I could today; and am much impressed by the prospects     
it offers. . . . At present I am not prepared for a conclusion;     
but as soon as I return from New York I will give it special attention. . . ."(DLC-RTL).     
Francis P. Blair, Sr., seems also to have been called upon for an opinion, for in a     
lengthy and favorable report Blair recommended that Henry T. Blow, U.S. minister to Venezuela,     
be sent to Chiriqui to examine the premises for the government (F. P. Blair, Sr., to Lincoln,    
November 16, 1861, <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.).     
Although the Blairs went so far as to prepare an order     
assigning Captain Ambrose Thompson (son of Ambrose W. Thompson, who headed the Chiriqui    
Improvement Company) as     
military escort for Henry T. Blow and an order detaching a vessel from the fleet for the purpose    
of conveying him     
(Francis P. Blair, Jr., to Montgomery Blair [December, 1861?] <hi rend="italic">ibid</hi>.), Lincoln seems not     
to have followed their recommendations. The Chiriqui project was held in abeyance until April,    
1862.</p></note>

<p>Abraham Lincoln,</p>    
<p>President of the United States of America</p>    
<p>To all whom these presents may concern</p>    
<p>Greeting:</p>    
<p>Know Ye, that, whereas, by the first section of the Act of Congress     
approved the 5th. of August last, entitled "An Act supplementary, to an Act     
entitled `An act to protect the commerce of the United States, and     
Punish the Crime of Piracy,"' it is enacted "That any vessel or boat     
which shall be built, purchased, fitted out in whole or in part, or     
held for the purpose of being employed in the commission of any     
piratical aggression, search, restraint, depredation, or seizure,     
or in the commission of any other act of piracy, as defined by     
the law of nations, shall be liable to be captured and brought into any     
port of the United States if found upon the high seas, or to be seized     
if found in any port or place within the United States, whether the same     
shall have actually sailed upon any piratical expedition or not, and     
whether any act of piracy shall have been committed or attempted upon or     
from such vessel or boat or not; and any such vessel or boat may be adjudged     
and condemned, if captured by a vessel authorized as herein after mentioned,     
to the use of the United States and to that of the captors, and if seized     
by a collector, surveyor, or marshal, then to the use of the United States,     
after due process and trial, in like manner    
<pb n="6"/>    
    
as is provided in section four of the act to which this act is supplementary,     
which section is hereby made in all respects applicable to cases arising under this act."</p>    
<p>And whereas by the second section of the same Act, the President of the     
United States is authorized to instruct the commander of any suitable     
vessel to subdue, seize, take, and, if on the high seas, to send into any port     
of the United States any vessel or boat, built, purchased, fitted out or held     
as in the said first section mentioned:</p>    
<p>Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States,     
in pursuance of the authority thus in me vested, do hereby authorize the     
propeller Pembroke, owned by R. B. Forbes of Boston and commanded by to     
take any vessel or boat, built, purchased or fitted out as aforesaid, and for so doing,     
this shall be his warrant.</p>

November 1, 1861. General Scott's retirement had been delayed since August 9, by the president's    
request. Although Scott's physical infirmity was the reason given the public for his retirement,    
McClellan had long been in disagreement with his superior, and on August 8 wrote him a letter    
which Scott deemed an insult. Scott's letter to Cameron of August 9, indicated the nub of    
dissension as follows: "McClellan has propagated, in high quarters, the idea expressed in the    
letter before me, that Washington was not only `insecure,' but in `imminent danger' . . . . I am    
confident in the opposite opinion. . . . Accordingly I must beg the President. . . to allow me to    
be placed on the <hi rend="italic">officers' retired list</hi>. . . ."(DLC-RTL). On August 10, Lincoln asked    
McClellan to withdraw his critical letter and requested Scott to withdraw his resignation. Scott    
wrote to Cameron, August 12, that he still wished to resign because of his conviction that    
McClellan intended to maintain an attitude of insubordination: "The original offence given to me    
by. . . McClellan. . . seems to have been the result of deliberation between him &amp; some of    
the members of the cabinet, by whom all the greater war questions are to be settled---without    
report to, or consultation with, me. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

under direction of resolutions passed by a Missouri convention on October 31, 1861, went to    
Washington to present his plan of co-operation between state and federal authority in Missouri.    
Although    
<pb n="16"/>    
</p><p>dated at the Executive Mansion, November 5, presumably the draft of Gamble's     
plan had been previously prepared. The text of the plan approved is as follows:</p>    
<p>"Executive Mansion, Washington, November 5, 1861.</p>    
<p>"The Governor of the State of Missouri, acting under the direction of the     
Convention of that State, proposes to the Government of the United States that     
he will raise a military force, to serve within the State as State militia     
during the war there, to co-operate with the troops in the service of the     
United States in repelling the invasion of the State and suppressing     
rebellion therein; the said State Militia to be embodied and to be held in the     
camp and in the field, drilled, disciplined, and governed according to the Army     
Regulations and subject to the Articles of War; the said State militia not to be     
ordered out of the State except for the immediate defense of the State of Missouri,     
but to co-operate with the troops in the service of the United States in military     
operations within the State or necessary to its defense, and when officers of     
the State Militia act with officers in the service of the United States of     
the same grade, the officers of the United States service shall command     
the combined force; the State Militia to be armed, equipped, clothed, subsisted,     
transported, and paid by the United States during such time as they shall be     
actually engaged as an embodied military force in service in accordance with     
Regulations of the United States Army or general orders as issued from time to time.</p>    
<p>"In order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened     
with the pay of unnecessary officers, the Governor proposes that, although the     
State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant-general,     
a commissary-general, an inspector-general, a quarter-master-general, a paymaster-general,     
and a surgeon-general, each with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes     
that the Government of the United States pay only the adjutant-general,     
the quarter-master general, and inspector-general, their services being necessary     
in the relations which would exist between the State Militia and the United States.     
The Governor further proposes that, while he is allowed by the State law to appoint     
aides-de-camp to the Governor at his discretion, with the rank of colonel, three     
only shall be reported to the United States for payment. He also proposes that     
the State Militia shall be commanded by a single major-general and by such     
number of brigadier-generals as shall allow one for a brigade of not less than four     
regiments, and that no greater number of staff officers shall be appointed for     
regimental, brigade, and division duties than is provided for in the act of     
Congress of the 22d July, 1861, and that whatever be the rank of such officers     
as fixed by the law of the State the compensation that they shall receive     
from the United States shall only be that which belongs to the rank given by     
said act of Congress to officers in the United States service performing the same duties.</p>    
<p>"The field officers of a regiment in the State militia are 1 colonel, 1 lieutenant-colonel,     
and 1 major, and the company officers are a captain, a first lieutenant,     
and a second lieutenant.</p>    
<p>"The Governor proposes that, as the money to be disbursed is the money     
of the United States, such staff officers in the service of the United States     
as may be necessary to act as disbursing officers for the State Militia shall     
be assigned by the War Department for that duty; or, if such cannot be spared     
from their present duty, he will appoint such persons disbursing officers for     
the State Militia as the President of the United States may designate. Such     
regulations as may be required, in the judgment of the President, to insure regularity     
of returns and to protect the United States from any fraudulent practices, shall be     
observed and obeyed by all in office in the State Militia.</p>    
<p>"The above propositions are accepted on the part of the United States, and     
the Secretary of War is directed to make the necessary orders upon the Ordnance,     
Quartermaster, Commissary, Pay, and Medical Departments to carry this    
<pb n="17"/>    
    
agreement into effect. He will cause the necessary staff officers in the United States     
service to be detailed for duty in connection with the Missouri State Militia, and will     
order them to make the necessary provision in their respective offices for     
fulfilling this agreement. All requisitions upon the different officers of     
the United States under this agreement to be made in substance in the     
same mode for the Missouri State Militia as similar requisitions are     
made for troops in the service of the United States, and the Secretary     
of War will cause any additional regulations that may be necessary to     
insure regularity and economy in carrying this agreement into effect     
to be adopted and communicated to the Governor of Missouri for the     
government of the Missouri State Militia."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., pp. 454-56).</p></note>

by the information which preceded your

arrival here, that his Majesty, your sovereign, had selected you to fill the mission

most glorious era in your country's noble history, and your own eminent social and     
political standing in Sweden.</p>    
<p>This country, Sir, maintains, and means to maintain, the rights of human nature     
and the capacity of man for self-government. The history of Sweden proves that     
this is the faith of the people of Sweden, as we know that it is the faith and     
practice of their respected Sovereign. Rest assured, therefore, that we shall be     
found always just and fraternal in our transactions with your Government, and     
that nothing will be omitted on my part to make your residence in this capital     
agreeable to yourself and satisfactory to your Government.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir This is not an official but a social letter. You have had a battle,     
and without being able to judge as to the precise measure of its value, I think it     
is safe to say that you, and all with you have done honor to yourselves and the     
flag and service to the country. Most gratefully do I thank you and them. In my     
present position, I must care for the whole nation; but I hope it will be no injustice     
to any other state, for me to indulge a little home pride, that Illinois does not     
disappoint us.</p>    
<p>I have just closed a long interview with Mr. Washburne in which he has detailed     
the many difficulties you, and those with you labor under. Be assured, we do not     
forget or neglect you. Much, very much, goes undone: but it is because we have not     
the power to do it faster than we do. Some of your forces are without arms, but the     
same is true here, and at every other place where we have considerable bodies of     
troops. The plain matter-of-fact is, our good people have rushed to the rescue of     
the Government, faster than the government can find arms to put into their hands.</p>    
<p>It would be agreeable to each division of the army to know its own precise     
destination: but the Government cannot immediately, nor inflexibly at any time,     
determine as to all; nor if determined, can it tell its <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> without     
at the same time telling its <hi rend="italic">enemies</hi>.</p>

<p>GENTLEMEN: I thank you for the address you have presented to me in behalf of the people     
of Baltimore. I have deplored the calamities which the sympathies of some misguided citizens     
of Maryland had brought down upon that patriotic and heretofore flourishing State. The     
prosperity of Baltimore up to the 19th of April last, was one of the wonders produced     
by the American Union. He who strangles himself, for whatever motive, is not more unreasonable     
than were those citizens of Baltimore who, in a single night, destroyed the Baltimore     
and Ohio Railroad, the Northern Pennsylvania Railroad, and the railroad from Baltimore     
to Philadelphia. From the day when that mad transaction occurred, the Government of     
the United States has been diligently engaged in endeavoring to restore those great     
avenues to their former usefulness, and, at the same time, to save Baltimore and Maryland     
from the danger of complete ruin through an unnecessary and unnatural rebellion.</p>    
<p>I congratulate you upon the declaration which the people of Baltimore and Maryland     
have made in the recent election, of their recent approbation of the Federal Government,     
and of their enduring loyalty to the Union. I regard the results of these elections as     
auspicious of returning loyalty throughout all the insurrectionary States.</p>    
<p>Your wishes for a fair participation by the mechanics and laboring men of Baltimore     
in the benefits of supplying the Government with materials and provisions are reasonable     
and just. They have deserved that participation. Loyalty has involved them in some danger,     
and has demanded of them some sacrifices. Their wishes, as you have communicated them,     
shall be referred to the proper Departments, and I am sure that every member of the     
Administration will cheerfully lend his aid to carry them out so far as it can be done     
consistently with the prudence and economy which ought always to regulate the public     
service.</p>

Winter; but amid all their sufferings the patriotism of the industrial classes has been proof

dollars, in thirty one<ref target="n5-30-1">1</ref>    
 equal annual instalments,     
there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, at any time after     
the first day of January in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred     
and ninety three,<ref target="n5-30-2">2</ref>    
 within the said State of     
Delaware, except in the punishment of crime, whereof the party shall have     
been duly convicted; nor, except in the punishment of crime as aforesaid,     
shall any person who shall be born after the passage of this act, nor any     
person above the age of thirty five years, be held in slavery, or to involuntary     
servitude, within said State of Delaware, at any time after the passage of this act.</p>    
<p>And be it further enacted that said State shall, in good faith prevent,     
so far as possible, the carrying of any person out of said state, into involuntary     
servitude, beyond the limits of said State, at any time after the passage of this act.</p>    
<p>And be it further enacted that said State may make provision of apprenticeship,     
not to extend beyond the age of twentyone years for males, nor eighteen for females,     
for all minors whose mothers were not free at the respective births of such minors.</p>    
<p>On reflection, I like No. 2 the better. By it the Nation would pay the State     
$ 23,200 per annum for thirtyone years--- and</p>    
<p>All born after the passage of the act would be born free--- and</p>    
<p>All slaves above the age of 35 years would become free on the passage of the act--- and</p>    
<p>All others would become free on arriving at the age of 35 years, until January 1893---    
when</p>    
<p>All remaining of all ages would become free, subject to apprenticeship     
for minors born of slave mothers, up to the respective ages of 21 and 18.</p>    
<p>If the State would desire to have the money sooner, let the bill be altered     
only in fixing the time of final emancipation earlier, and making the annual     
instalments correspondingly fewer in number, by which they would also be correspondingly     
larger in amount. For instance, strike out "1893,"and insert "1872"; and strike     
out "thirtyone"annual instalments, and insert "ten"annual instalments. The     
instalments would then be $ 71,920 instead of $ 23,200 as now. In all other particulars     
let the bill stand precisely as it is.</p>

endorsed by Speed November 26, giving information on construction and gauge of the     
Nashville Railroad and on Middle Tennessee. Guthrie's letter expressed fear that     
". . . the directing spirits at Washington still think of an invasion of East     
Tennessee. . . and are disposed to allow [Leonidas] Polk Johnson [Albert S. Johnston]

(DLC-RTL). Although Lincoln's endorsement is one day earlier than that to McClellan     
on another of Guthrie's letters to Speed bearing the same date, November 22, it is     
obvious that the matter covered in Guthrie's letter bearing Lincoln's endorsement of     
the 27th was written prior to this one. See Lincoln to McClellan, November 27,

<p>I expect the United States will overcome the attempt to confiscate property,

act her pleasure in the premises.</p>

<opener>December 3, 1861</opener>    
<p>Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>    
<p>In the midst of unprecedented political troubles, we have cause of great gratitude     
to God for unusual good health, and most abundant harvests.</p>    
<p>You will not be surprised to learn that, in the peculiar exigencies of the times,     
our intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solicitude,     
chiefly turning upon our own domestic affairs.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="36"/>    
A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged     
in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious     
domestic division, is exposed to disrespect abroad; and one party, if not both,     
is sure, sooner or later, to invoke foreign intervention.</p>    
<p>Nations, thus tempted to interfere, are not always able to resist the counsels     
of seeming expediency, and ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such     
influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them.</p>    
<p>The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our country,     
in return for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received     
less patronage and encouragement than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose,     
as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case,     
discarding all moral, social, and treaty obligations, would act solely, and selfishly,     
for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including, especially, the acquisition of     
cotton, those nations appear, as yet, not to have seen their way to their object more     
directly, or clearly, through the destruction, than through the preservation, of the     
Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher     
principle than this, I am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show them that     
they can reach their aim more readily, and easily, by aiding to crush this rebellion,     
than by giving encouragement to it.</p>    
<p>The principal lever relied on by the insurgents for exciting foreign nations to hostility     
against us, as already intimated, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however,     
not improbably, saw from the first, that it was the Union which made as well our foreign, as     
our domestic, commerce. They can scarcely have failed to perceive that the effort for     
disunion produces the existing difficulty; and that one strong nation promises more     
durable peace, and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce, than can the same     
nation broken into hostile fragments.</p>    
<p>It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states, because     
whatever might be their wishes, or dispositions, the integrity of our country, and     
the stability of our government, mainly depend, not upon them, but on the loyalty,     
virtue, patriotism, and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence     
itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted<ref target="n5-36-1">1</ref>

<p>I venture to hope it will appear that we have practiced prudence, and liberality     
towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation;    
<pb n="37"/>    
    
and, with firmness, maintaining our own rights and honor.</p>    
<p>Since, however, it is apparent that here, as in every other state, foreign     
dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and     
ample measures be adopted for maintaining the public defences on every side. While,     
under this general recommendation, provision for defending our sea-coast line readily     
occurs to the mind, I also, in the same connexion, ask the attention of Congress to     
our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of     
arms and munitions, with harbor and navigation improvements, all at well selected points     
upon these, would be of great importance to the national defence and preservation.     
I ask attention to the views of the Secretary of War, expressed in his report,    
<ref target="n5-37-1">1</ref>    
 upon the same general subject.</p>    
<p>I deem it of Importance that the loyal regions of East Tennessee and western     
North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky, and other faithful parts of the     
Union, by railroad. I therefore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide     
for the construction of such road, as speedily as possible. Kentucky, no doubt, will     
co-operate, and, through her legislature, make the most judicious selection of a line.     
The northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad; and whether the route     
shall be from Lexington, or Nicholasville, to the Cumberland Gap; or from Lebanon to     
the Tennessee line, in the direction of Knoxville; or on some still different line,     
can easily be determined. Kentucky and the general government co-operating, the work     
can be completed in a very short time; and when done, it will be not only of vast present     
usefulness, but also a valuable permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future.</p>    
<p>Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave     
political importance, have been negotiated, and will be submitted to the Senate for     
their consideration.</p>    
<p>Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable     
melioration of the rigor of maritime war, we have removed all obstructions from the     
way of this humane reform, except such as are merely of temporary and accidental occurrence.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="38"/>    
I invite your attention to the correspondence between her Britannic Majesty's     
minister accredited to this government, and the Secretary of State, relative     
to the detention of the British ship Perthshire in June last, by the United States    
steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade.<ref target="n5-38-1">1</ref>    
     
As this detention was occasioned by an obvious misapprehension of the facts, and     
as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict     
right, as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropriation be made to     
satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention.</p>    
<p>I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his annual message to Congress     
in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus which will probably     
remain after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China, pursuant     
to the awards of the commissioners under the act of the 3rd of March, 1859.    
<ref target="n5-38-2">2</ref>    
 If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to carry     
that recommendation into effect, I would suggest that authority be given for investing     
the principal, over the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities,     
with a view to the satisfaction of such other just claims of our citizens against     
China as are not unlikely to arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade     
with that Empire.</p>    
<p>By the act of the 5th of August last, Congress authorized the President to     
instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against, and     
to capture pirates. This authority has been exercised in a single instance     
only.<ref target="n5-38-3">3</ref>    
 For the more effectual protection of our extensive     
and valuable commerce, in the eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would     
also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to re-capture any     
prizes which pirates might make of United States vessels and their cargoes, and the     
consular courts, now established by law in eastern countries, to adjudicate the     
cases, in the event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="39"/>    
If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition     
of the independence and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it.     
Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation     
of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an appropriation for     
maintaining a Charge d'affaires near each of those new states. It is [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]     
does not admit of doubt that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable     
commercial treaties with them.<ref target="n5-39-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>The operations of the treasury during the period which has elapsed since your     
adjournment have been conducted with signal success. The patriotism of the people     
has placed at the disposal of the government the large means demanded by the public     
exigencies. Much of the national loan has been taken by citizens of the industrial     
classes, whose confidence in their country's faith, and zeal for their country's     
deliverance from present peril, have induced them to contribute to the support of     
the government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar     
obligations to economy in disbursement and energy in action.</p>    
<p>The revenue from all sources, including loans, for the financial year ending on     
the 30th June, 1861, was eighty six million, eight hundred and thirty five thousand,     
nine hundred dollars, and twenty seven cents, ($86,835,900.27,) and the expenditures     
for the same period, including payments on account of the public debt, were eighty     
four million, five hundred and seventy eight thousand, eight hundred and thirty four     
dollars and forty seven cents, ($84,578,834.47;) leaving a balance in the treasury,     
on the 1st July, of two million, two hundred and fifty seven thousand, sixty five     
dollars and eighty cents, ($2,257,065.80.) For the first quarter of the financial year,     
ending on the 30th September, 1861, the receipts from all sources, including the balance     
of first of July, were<ref target="n5-39-2">2</ref>    
 $102,532,509.27, and the expenses     
$98,239,733.09; leaving a balance on the 1st of October, 1861, of $4,292,776.18.</p>    
<p>Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year, and for the financial year     
1863, together with his views of ways and means for meeting the demands contemplated     
by them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is     
gratifying to know that the expenditures made necessary by the rebellion are not     
beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that    
<pb n="40"/>    
    
the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the government will continue to     
sustain it till Peace and Union shall again bless the land.</p>    
<p>I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information     
respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in     
view an increase of its efficiency and the well being of the various branches of     
the service intrusted to his care.<ref target="n5-40-1">1</ref>    
 It is gratifying to     
know that the patriotism of the people has proved equal to the occasion, and that     
the number of troops tendered greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized    
me to call into the field.</p>    
<p>I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to     
the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the     
excellent sanitary condition of the entire army.</p>    
<p>The recommendation of the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon     
a uniform basis, is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of the     
country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress.</p>    
<p>The large addition to the regular army, in connexion with the defection that     
has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance     
to his recommendation for increasing the corps of cadets to the greatest capacity     
of the Military Academy.</p>    
<p>By mere omission, I presume, Congress has failed to provide chaplains     
for hospitals occupied by volunteers. This subject was brought to my notice,     
and I was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which, properly     
addressed, has been delivered to each of the persons, and at the dates     
respectively named and stated, in a schedule, containing also the form of the letter,     
marked A, and herewith transmitted.<ref target="n5-40-2">2</ref>    
</p>    
<p>These gentlemen, I understand, entered upon the duties designated, at the times     
respectively stated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since.     
I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the     
army. I further suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at     
hospitals, as well as with regiments.</p>    
<p>The report of the Secretary of the Navy<ref target="n5-40-3">3</ref>    
 presents in detail     
the operations of that branch of the service, the activity and energy which have     
characterized its administration, and the results of measures to increase its efficiency     
and power. Such have been the    
<pb n="41"/>    
    
additions, by construction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been     
created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced.</p>    
<p>Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than ever before assembled     
under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our     
naval renown.</p>    
<p>I would invite special attention to the recommendation of the Secretary for a     
more perfect organization of the navy by introducing additional grades in the service.</p>    
<p>The present organization is defective and unsatisfactory, and the suggestions     
submitted by the department will, it is believed, if adopted, obviate the difficulties     
alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the efficiency of the navy.</p>    
<p>There are three vacancies on the bench of the Supreme Court---two by the decease     
of Justices Daniel and McLean, and one by the resignation of Justice Campbell. I have     
so far forborne making nominations to fill these vacancies for reasons which I will     
now state. Two of the outgoing judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt;     
so that if successors were appointed in the same localities, they could not now serve     
upon their circuits; and many of the most competent men there, probably would not take     
the personal hazard of accepting to serve, even here, upon the supreme bench. I have     
been unwilling to throw all the appointments northward, thus disabling myself from     
doing justice to the south on the return of peace; although I may remark that to transfer     
to the north one which has heretofore been in the south, would not, with reference to     
territory and population, be unjust.</p>    
<p>During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean his circuit grew into     
an empire---altogether too large for any one judge to give the courts therein more than     
a nominal attendance---rising in population from one million four hundred and     
seventy-thousand and eighteen, in 1830, to six million one hundred and fifty-one     
thousand four hundred and five, in 1860.</p>    
<p>Besides this, the country generally has outgrown our present judicial system.     
If uniformity was<ref target="n5-41-1">1</ref>    
 at all intended, the system requires     
that all the States shall be accommodated with circuit courts, attended by supreme     
judges, while, in fact, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas, Florida, Texas, California,     
and Oregon, have never had any such courts. Nor can this well be remedied without a     
change of the system; because the adding of judges to the Supreme Court, enough     
for the accommodation of all parts of the country, with circuit courts, would create     
a court altogether too numerous    
<pb n="42"/>    
    
for a judicial body of any sort. And the evil, if it be one, will increase as new     
States come into the Union. Circuit courts are useful, or they are not useful. If     
useful, no State should be denied them; if not useful, no State should have them. Let     
them be provided for all, or abolished as to all.</p>    
<p>Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement     
upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event.     
Then, first, let the whole country be divided into circuits of convenient size, the     
supreme judges to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own number, and     
independent circuit judges be provided for all the rest. Or, secondly, let the supreme     
judges be relieved from circuit duties, and circuit judges provided for all the     
circuits. Or, thirdly, dispense with circuit courts altogether, leaving the judicial     
functions wholly to the district courts and an independent Supreme Court.    
<ref target="n5-42-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>I respectfully recommend to the consideration of Congress the present condition     
of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy     
for many of the inconveniences and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged     
in the practical administration of them. Since the organization of the government,     
Congress has enacted some five thousand acts and joint resolutions, which fill more     
than six thousand closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes. Many     
of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their     
provisions are often obscure in themselves, or in conflict with each other, or at least     
so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best informed persons to     
ascertain precisely what the statute law really is.</p>    
<p>It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain     
and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist     
with the fullness and precision of the will of the legislature and the perspicuity     
of its language. This, well done, would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those     
whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting     
benefit to the people, by placing before them, in a more accessible and intelligible     
form, the laws which so deeply concern their interests and their duties.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="43"/>    
I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in     
force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be revised and re-written, so as     
to be embraced in one volume (or at most, two volumes) of ordinary and convenient size.     
And I respectfully recommend to Congress to consider of the subject, and, if my suggestion     
be approved, to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall seem most proper for the     
attainment of the end proposed.<ref target="n5-43-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>One of the unavoidable consequences of the present insurrection is the entire     
suppression, in many places, of all the ordinary means of administering civil justice     
by the officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the case, in whole or in part,     
in all the insurgent States; and as our armies advance upon and take possession of parts     
of those States, the practical evil becomes more apparent. There are no courts nor officers     
to whom the citizens of other States may apply for the enforcement of their lawful claims     
against citizens of the insurgent States; and there is a vast amount of debt constituting     
such claims. Some have estimated it as high as two hundred million dollars, due, in large     
part, from insurgents, in open rebellion, to loyal citizens who are, even now, making     
great sacrifices in the discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government.</p>    
<p>Under these circumstances, I have been urgently solicited to establish, by military     
power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far declined to     
do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed---the collection of the     
debts---was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to go beyond     
the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of power. But the powers of Congress     
I suppose are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter     
to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice     
in all such parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under the control of     
this government, whether by a voluntary return to allegiance and order or by the power     
of our arms. This, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute,    
<pb n="44"/>    
    
and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace.</p>    
<p>It is important that some more convenient means should be provided, if possible,     
for the adjustment of claims against the government, especially in view of their     
increased number by reason of the war. It is as much the duty of government to render     
prompt justice against itself, in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same,     
between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims, in their     
nature belong to the judicial<ref target="n5-44-1">1</ref>    
 department; besides it is     
apparent that the attention of Congress, will be more than usually engaged, for some     
time to come, with great national questions. It was intended, by the organization of     
the court of claims, mainly to remove this branch of business from the halls of Congress;     
but while the court has proved to be an effective, and valuable means of investigation,     
it in great degree fails to effect the object of its creation, for want of power to make     
its judgments final.</p>    
<p>Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend     
to your careful consideration whether this power of making judgments final, may not     
properly be given to the court, reserving the right of appeal on questions of law     
to the Supreme Court, with such other provisions as experience may have shown to     
be necessary.<ref target="n5-44-2">2</ref>    
</p>    
<p>I ask attention to the report of the Postmaster General, the following being a     
summary statement of the condition of the department:</p>    
<p>The<ref target="n5-44-3">3</ref>    
 revenue from all sources during the fiscal year     
ending June 30. 1861, including the annual permanent appropriation of seven hundred     
thousand dollars ($700,000) for the transportation of "free mail matter,"was nine     
million, forty nine thousand, two hundred and nin[e]ty six dollars and forty cents     
($9,049,296.40) being about two per cent. less than the revenue for 1860.</p>    
<p>The expenditures were thirteen million, six hundred and six thousand, seven     
hundred and fifty nine dollars and eleven cents. ($13,606,759.11) showing a decrease     
of more than eight per cent. as compared with those of the previous year, and leaving     
an excess of expenditure over the revenue for the last fiscal year of four million,     
five hundred and fifty seven thousand, four hundred    
<pb n="45"/>    
    
and sixty two dollars and seventy one cents ($4,557,462.71.)</p>    
<p>The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1863, is estimated at an increase     
of four per cent. on that of 1861, making eight million, six hundred and eighty     
three thousand dollars ($8,683,000) to which should be added the earnings of the     
department in carrying free matter, viz: seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000.)     
making nine million, three hundred and eighty three thousand dollars, ($9,383,000.)</p>    
<p>The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $12,528,000, leaving an estimated     
deficiency of $3,145,000, to be supplied from the treasury, in addition to the permanent     
appropriation.</p>    
<p>The present insurrection shows, I think, that the extension of this District across     
the Potomac river, at the time of establishing the capital here, was eminently wise,     
and consequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the     
State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I submit for your consideration the expediency     
of regaining that part of the District, and the restoration of the original boundaries     
thereof, through negotiations with the State of Virginia.<ref target="n5-45-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>The report of the Secretary of the Interior,<ref target="n5-45-2">2</ref>    
 with the     
accompanying documents, exhibits the condition of the several branches of the public     
business pertaining to that department. The depressing influences of the insurrection     
have been especially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The     
cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses     
of our land system only about $200,000. The sales have been entirely suspended in the     
southern States, while the interruptions to the business of the country, and the     
diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service, have obstructed settlements     
in the new States and Territories of the northwest.</p>    
<p>The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about $100,000, rendering a    
large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self sustaining.</p>    
<p>The demands upon the Pension Office will be largely increased by the insurrection. Numerous    
applications for pensions, based upon the casualties of the existing war, have already been made.    
There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension rolls and in receipt of the    
bounty of the government, are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or giving them aid and comfort.    
The</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="46"/>    
Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payment of the pensions of such    
persons upon proof of their disloyalty. I recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause    
the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls.</p>    
<p>The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been greatly disturbed by the    
insurrection, especially in the southern superintendency and in that of New Mexico. The Indian    
country south of Kansas is in the possession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. The agents of    
the United States appointed since the 4th. of March for this superintendency have been unable to    
reach their posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the    
insurrectionary cause, and assume to exercise the powers of agents by virtue of commissions from    
the insurrectionists. It has been stated in the public press that a portion of those Indians have    
been organized as a military force, and are attached to the army of the insurgents. Although the    
government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to the    
Commissioner of Indian Affairs by several prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to    
the United States, and expressing a wish for the presence of federal troops to protect them. It    
is believed that upon the repossession of the country by the federal forces the Indians will    
readily cease all hostile demonstrations, and resume their former relations to the    
government.</p>    
<p>Agriculture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has, not a department, nor a    
bureau, but a clerkship only, assigned to it in the government. While it is fortunate that this    
great interest is so independent in its nature as to not have demanded and extorted more from the    
government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given    
voluntarily with general advantage.<ref target="n5-46-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures would    
present a fund of information of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion    
as to details, I venture the opinion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably    
be organized.</p>    
<p>The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade, has been confided to    
the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the efforts which have been    
made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic, have been recently attended with unusual    
success. Five vessels being fitted out for the    
<pb n="47"/>    
    
slave trade have been seized and condemned.<ref target="n5-47-1">1</ref>    
 Two mates of vessels    
engaged in the trade, and one person in equipping a vessel as a slaver, have been convicted and    
subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment, and one captain, taken with a cargo of    
Africans on board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of offence under our laws,    
the punishment of which is death.<ref target="n5-47-2">2</ref>    
</p>    
<p>The Territories of Colorado, Dakotah and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been    
organized, and civil administration has been inaugurated therein under auspices especially    
gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven of treason was found existing in some of these    
new countries when the federal officers arrived there.</p>    
<p>The abundant natural resources of these Territories, with the security and protection afforded    
by organized government, will doubtless invite to them a large immigration when peace shall    
restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the    
legislature of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So    
far the authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it    
will be in the future. I commend their interests and defence to the enlightened and generous care    
of Congress.</p>    
<p>I recommend to the favorable consideration of Congress the interests of the District of    
Columbia. The insurrection has been the cause of much suffering and sacrifice to its inhabitants,    
and as they have no representative in Congress, that body should not overlook their just claims    
upon the government.</p>    
<p>At your late session a joint resolution was adopted authorizing the President to take measures    
for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United States at the    
exhibition of the industry of all nations to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret to    
say I have been unable to give personal attention to this subject,---a subject at once so    
interesting in itself, and so extensively and intimately connected with the material prosperity    
of the world. Through the Secretaries of State and of the Interior a plan, or system, has been    
devised, and partly matured, and which will be laid before you.<ref target="n5-47-3">3</ref>

Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled "An act to confiscate property used for    
insurrectionary purposes,"approved August, 6, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the    
labor and service of certain other persons have become forfeited; and numbers of the latter, thus    
liberated, are already dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way.    
Besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their    
own benefit respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon    
them for disposal. In such case I recommend that Congress provide for accepting such persons from    
such States, according to some mode of valuation, in lieu, <hi rend="italic">pro tanto</hi>, of direct taxes,    
or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such States respectively; that such persons, on such    
acceptance by the general government, be at once deemed free; and that, in any event, steps be    
taken for colonizing both classes, (or the one first mentioned, if the other shall not be brought    
into existence,) at some place, or places, in a climate congenial to them. It might be well to    
consider, too,---whether the free colored people already in the United States could not, so far    
as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization.<ref target="n5-48-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the    
appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. Having    
practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly sixty years, the question of constitutional    
power to do so is no longer an open one with us. The power was questioned at first by Mr.    
Jefferson, who, however, in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great    
expediency. If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring territory is to furnish    
homes for white men, this measure effects that object; for the emigration of colored men leaves    
additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the    
importance of procuring Louisiana more on political and commercial grounds than on providing room    
for population.</p>    
<p>On this whole proposition,---including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of    
territory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity---that, without which the    
government itself cannot be perpetuated? The war continues. In considering the policy to be    
adopted for suppressing the insurrection, I have been    
<pb n="49"/>    
    
anxious and careful that the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into a    
violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. I have, therefore, in every case, thought it    
proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of the contest on our    
part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate    
action of the legislature.</p>    
<p>In the exercise of my best discretion I have adhered to the blockade of the ports held by the    
insurgents, instead of putting in force, by proclamation, the law of Congress enacted at the late    
session, for closing those ports.<ref target="n5-49-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>So, also, obeying the dictates of prudence, as well as the obligations of law, instead of    
transcending, I have adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for    
insurrectionary purposes. If a new law upon the same subject shall be proposed, its propriety    
will be duly considered.</p>    
<p>The Union must be preserved, and hence, all indispensable means must be employed. We should    
not be in haste to determine that radical and extreme measures, which may reach the loyal as well    
as the disloyal, are indispensable.</p>    
<p>The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration, and the message to Congress at    
the late special session, were both mainly devoted to the domestic controversy out of which the    
insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add or subtract, to or from,    
the principles or general purposes stated and expressed in those documents.</p>    
<p>The last ray of hope for preserving the Union peaceably, expired at the assault upon Fort    
Sumter; and a general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was    
painfully uncertain then, is much better defined and more distinct now; and the progress of    
events is plainly in the right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support    
from north of Mason and Dixon's line; and the friends of the Union were not free from    
apprehension on the point. This, however, was soon settled definitely and on the right side.    
South of the line, noble little Delaware led off right from the first. Maryland was made to    
<hi rend="italic">seem</hi> against the Union. Our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned, and railroads    
torn up, within her limits; and we were many days, at one time, without the ability to bring a    
single regiment over her soil to the capital. Now, her bridges and railroads    
<pb n="50"/>    
    
are repaired and open to the government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the    
Union and none to the enemy; and her people, at a regular election, have sustained the Union, by    
a larger majority, and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate, or    
any question. Kentucky, too, for some time in doubt, is now decidedly, and, I think,    
unchangeably, ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet; and I believe    
cannot again be overrun by the insurrectionists. These three States of Maryland, Kentucky, and    
Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not    
less than forty thousand in the field, for the Union; while, of their citizens, certainly not    
more than a third of that number, and they of doubtful whereabouts, and doubtful existence, are    
in arms against it. After a somewhat bloody struggle of months, winter closes on the Union people    
of western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country.</p>    
<p>An insurgent force of about fifteen hundred, for months dominating the narrow peninsular    
region, constituting the counties of Accomac and Northampton, and known as eastern shore of    
Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms; and the    
people there have renewed their allegiance to, and accepted the protection of, the old flag. This    
leaves no armed insurrectionist north of the Potomac, or east of the Chesapeake.</p>    
<p>Also we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points, on the southern coast, of    
Hatteras, Port Royal, Tybee Island, near Savannah, and Ship Island; and we likewise have some    
general accounts of popular movements, in behalf of the Union, in North Carolina and    
Tennessee.</p>    
<p>These things demonstrate that the cause of the Union is advancing steadily and certainly    
southward.</p>    
<p>Since your last adjournment, Lieutenant General Scott has retired from the head of the army.    
During his long life, the nation has not been unmindful of his merit; yet, on calling to mind how    
faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country, from a time far back in our history,    
when few of the now living had been born, and thenceforward continually, I cannot but think we    
are still his debtors. I submit, therefore, for your consideration, what further mark of    
recognition is due to him, and to ourselves, as a grateful people.</p>    
<p>With the retirement of General Scott came the executive duty of appointing, in his stead, a    
general-in-chief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council nor country    
was    
<pb n="51"/>    
    
there, so far as I know, any difference of opinion as to the proper person to be selected. The    
retiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in favor of General McClellan for the position;    
and in this the nation seemed to give a unanimous concurrence. The designation of General    
McClellan is therefore in considerable degree, the selection of the Country as well as of the    
Executive; and hence there is better reason to hope there will be given him, the confidence, and    
cordial support thus, by fair implication, promised, and without which, he cannot, with so full    
efficiency, serve the country.</p>    
<p>It has been said that one bad general is better than two good ones; and the saying is true, if    
taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior,    
than by two superior ones, at variance, and cross-purposes with each other.</p>    
<p>And the same is true, in all joint operations wherein those engaged, <hi rend="italic">can</hi> have none    
but a common end in view, and <hi rend="italic">can</hi> differ only as to the choice of means. In a storm at    
sea, no one on board <hi rend="italic">can</hi> wish the ship to sink; and yet, not unfrequently, all go down    
together, because too many will direct, and no single mind can be allowed to control.</p>    
<p>It continues to develop that the insurrection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the    
first principle of popular government---the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is    
found in the most grave and maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general tone    
of the insurgents. In those documents we find the abridgement of the existing right of suffrage    
and the denial to the people of all right to participate in the selection of public officers,    
except the legislative boldly advocated, with labored arguments to prove that large control of    
the people in government, is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes    
hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of the people.</p>    
<p>In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice    
against this approach of returning despotism.</p>    
<p>It is not needed, nor fitting here, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular    
institutions; but there is one point, with its connexions, not so hackneyed as most others, to    
which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to place <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> on an equal footing    
with, if not above <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>, in the structure of government. It is assumed that labor is    
available only in connexion with capital; that nobody labors unless somebody else, owning    
capital, somehow by the use of it, induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered    
<pb n="52"/>    
    
whether it is best that capital shall <hi rend="italic">hire</hi> laborers, and thus induce them to work by    
their own consent, or <hi rend="italic">buy</hi> them, and drive them to it without their consent. Having    
proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> laborers,    
or what we call slaves. And further it is assumed that whoever is once a hired laborer, is fixed    
in that condition for life.</p>    
<p>Now, there is no such relation between capital and labor as assumed; nor is there any such    
thing as a free man being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both these    
assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless.</p>    
<p>Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could    
never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves    
much the higher consideration. Capital has its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any    
other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between    
labor and capital, producing mutual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of    
community exists within that relation. A few men own capital, and that few avoid labor    
themselves, and, with their capital, hire or buy another few to labor for them. A large majority    
belong to neither class---neither work for others, nor have others working for them. In most of    
the southern States, a majority of the whole people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters;    
while in the northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families---    
wives, sons, and daughters---work for themselves, on their farms, in their houses, and in their    
shops, taking the whole product to themselves, and asking no favors of capital on the one hand,    
nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of    
persons mingle their own labor with capital---that is, they labor with their own hands, and also    
buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed, and not a distinct class. No    
principle stated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class.</p>    
<p>Again: as has already been said, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as the free hired    
laborer being fixed to that condition for life. Many independent men everywhere in these States,    
a few years back in their lives, were hired laborers. The prudent, penniless beginner in the    
world, labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself; then    
labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.    
This is the just, and generous, and prosperous system, which opens the way to all---gives hope to    
all, and consequent energy, and progress, and improvement of condition to all. No    
<pb n="53"/>    
    
men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up from poverty---none less inclined    
to take, or touch, aught which they have not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrendering a    
political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to    
close the door of advancement against such as they, and to fix new disabilities and burdens upon    
them, till all of liberty shall be lost.</p>    
<p>From the first taking of our national census to the last are seventy years; and we find our    
population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the beginning. The increase    
of those other things which men deem desirable has been even greater. We thus have at one view,    
what the popular principle applied to government, through the machinery of the States and the    
Union, has produced in a given time; and also what, if firmly maintained, it promises for the    
future. There are already among us those, who, if the Union be preserved, will live to see it    
contain two hundred and fifty millions. The struggle of today, is not altogether for today---it    
is for a vast future also. With a reliance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us    
proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon us.</p>

identical endorsements of this date on two letters from Samuel P. Carter to Horace Maynard,    
November 21, and 25, 1861. Carter, as acting brigadier general of the East Tennessee Brigade at    
Camp Calvert near London, Kentucky, requested Representative Maynard of East Tennessee to get    
action in moving troops (his brigade in particular) to the defense of East Tennessee and    
Kentucky. McClellan forwarded the letters to General Buell, December 3, 1861, ordering him to    
"send. . . with the least possible delay, troops enough to protect these men. . . . You may    
fully rely on my full support in. . . the liberation of Eastern Tennessee. . . ."

<lb/>    
[December 10? 1861]</opener>    
<p>The despatch of Her Majesty's Secretary for Foreign Affairs, dated the 30th. of November 1861,    
and, of which your Lordship kindly furnished me a copy, has been carefully considered by the    
President; and he directs me to say that if there existed no fact, or facts pe[r]tinent to the    
case, beyond those stated in said despatch, the reparation sought by Great Brittain from the    
United States, would be justly due, and should be promptly made. The</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="63"/>    
President is unwilling to believe that Her Majesty's Government will press for a categorical    
answer upon what appears to him to be only a partial record, in the making up of which, he has    
been allowed no part. He is reluctant to volunteer his view of the case, with no assurance that    
Her Majesty's Government will consent to hear him; yet this much he directs me to say, that this    
government has intended no affront to the British flag, or to the British nation; nor has it    
intended to force into discussion, an embarrassing question, all which is evident by the fact,    
hereby asserted, that the act complained of was done by the officer, without orders from, or    
expectation of, the government. But being done, it was no longer left to us to consider whether    
we might not, to avoid a controversy, waive an unimportant, though a strict right; because we    
too, as well as Great Brittain, have a people justly jealous of their rights, and in whose    
presence our government could undo the act complained of, only upon a fair showing that it was    
wrong, or, at least, very questionable. The United States government and people, are still    
willing to make reparation upon such showing.</p>    
<p>Accordingly I am instructed by the President to inquire whether Her Majesty's government will    
hear the United States upon the matter in question. The President desires, among other things, to    
bring into view, and have considered, the existing rebellion in the United States-the position    
Great Brittain has assumed, including Her Majesty's proclamation, in relation thereto-the    
relation the persons, whose seizure is the subject of complaint, bore to the United States, and    
the object of their voyage at the time they were seized-the knowledge which the master of the    
<hi rend="italic">Trent</hi> had of their relation to the United States, and of the object of their voyage, at    
the time he received them on board for the voyage-the place of the seizure-and the precedents,    
and respective positions assumed, in analagous cases, between Great Brittain and the United    
States.</p>    
<p>Upon a Submission, containing the foregoing facts, with those set forth in the before    
mentioned despatch to your Lordship, together with all other facts which either party may deem    
material, I am instructed to say the government of the United States will, if agreed to by Her    
Majesty's government, go to such friendly arbitration as is usual among nations, and will abide    
the award.</p>    
<p>Or, in the alternative, Her Majesty's government may, upon the same record, determine whether    
any, and if any, what reparation is due from the United States; <hi rend="italic">provided</hi>, no such    
reparation shall be different in character from, nor transcend, that proposed by your Lordship,    
as instructed in and by the despatch aforesaid; and, <hi rend="italic">provided further</hi>, that the    
determination thus made shall be the    
<pb n="64"/>    
    
law for all future analagous cases, between Great Brittain and the United States.</p>

<note id="n5-69-2"><p>2 AES, DLC-RTL. Lincoln's endorsement is    
written on a letter from Assistant Adjutant General Alfred B. Ely, counsel for Brigadier General    
Henry W. Benham, December 13, 1861, setting forth that some twenty days had elapsed since    
Benham's arrest, November 24, on orders of General William S. Rosecrans, and that since no    
charges had been preferred, law required General Benham's release. Judge Advocate General Lee    
replied, December 19, in an endorsement immediately following Lincoln's, that there was just    
cause for delaying the trial, but recommending Benham's release and return to duty. Below Lee's    
endorsement, General McClellan wrote "Since the charges preferred. . . involve the question of    
his fitness to command troops in presence of the enemy I beg to reserve my opinion in the matter    
until I see the specifications. The charges are so serious that Genl Benham should cause an    
investigation."Rosecrans to Lorenzo Thomas, November 29, 1861, reported as follows: "On the    
26th [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] instant I found it necessary to arrest Brig. Gen. H. W. Benham for unofficer-    
like neglect of duty.    
<pb n="70"/>    
</p><p>He applied for a leave of absence on a medical certificate, with permission to visit a    
city, and has gone to New York. . . ."(OR, I, V, 66g). The arrest had been ordered because    
Benham failed to cut off the retreat of General John B. Floyd in West Virginia. The case dragged    
out (see New York <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, March 22, 1862), but Benham was finally ordered to report for    
duty on March 17 and was later assigned to Major General David Hunter's command at Port Royal,

Senate resolution of December 9 had directed Marshall Lamon "to inform the Senate by what    
authority he receives slaves into the jail of the District at the request of their masters and    
holds them in confinement until discharged by their masters."Bills introduced in the Senate to    
appoint a warden of the District jail (February 12, 1862) and to abolish the office of marshal    
and create the office of sheriff (May 8, 1862) were obviously aimed at Lamon. The first of these    
contained an amendment (February 14) as follows: "That whenever the marshal or other officer. .

Major General Hunter. Dec. 31, 1861.</opener>    
<p>Dear Sir: Yours of the 23rd. is received; and I am constrained to say it is difficult to    
answer so ugly a letter in good temper. I am, as you intimate, losing much of the great    
confidence I placed in you, not from any act or omission of yours touching the public service, up    
to the time you were sent to Leavenworth, but from the flood of grumbling despatches and letters    
I have seen from you since. I knew you were being ordered to Leavenworth at the time it was done;    
and I aver that with as tender a regard for your honor and your sensibilities as I had for my    
own, it never occurred to me that you were being "humiliated, insulted and disgraced"; nor have    
I, up to this day, heard an intimation that you have been wronged, coming from any one but    
yourself. No one has blamed you for the retrograde movement from Springfield, nor for the    
information you gave Gen. Cameron; and this you could readily understand, if it were not for your    
unwarranted assumption that the ordering you to Leavenworth must necessarily have been done as a    
<hi rend="italic">punishment</hi> for some <hi rend="italic">fault</hi>. I thought then, and think yet, the position assigned    
to you is as respo[n]sible, and as honorable, as that assigned to Buell. I know that Gen.    
McClellan expected more important results from it. My impression is that at the time you were    
assigned to the new Western Department, it had not been determined to re-place Gen. Sherman in    
Kentucky; but of this I am not certain, because the idea that a command in Kentucky was very    
desireable, and one in the farther West, very    
<pb n="85"/>    
    
undesireable, had never occurred to me. You constantly speak of being placed in command of only    
3000. Now tell me, is not this mere impatience? Have you not known all the while that you are to    
command four or five times that many?</p>    
<p>I have been, and am sincerely your friend; and if, as such, I dare to make a suggestion, I    
would say you are adopting the best possible way to ruin yourself. "Act well your part, there    
all the honor lies."He who does <hi rend="italic">something</hi> at the head of one Regiment, will eclipse

humiliated, insulted and disgraced. . . . I am sent here [Fort Leavenworth] into banishment, with    
not three thousand effective men under my command, while one of the Brigadiers, General Buell, is    
in command of near one hundred thousand men in Kentucky. The only sin I have committed is my    
carrying out your views in relation to the retrograde movement from Springfield. . . . So it    
appears that I have been deprived of a command, suitable to my rank, for presuming to answer. . .    
official questions put to me by the Secretary of War. . . for in no other way was I connected    
with the Fremont troubles. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>My dear General Halleck: General McClellan is not dangerously ill, as I hope, but would better    
not to be disturbed with business. I am very anxious that, in case of General Buell's moving    
toward Nashville, the enemy shall not be greatly re-enforced, and I think there is danger he will    
be from Columbus. It seems to me that a real or feigned attack upon Columbus from up-river at the    
same time would either prevent this or compensate for it by throwing Columbus into our hands. I    
wrote General Buell a letter similar to this, meaning that he and you shall communicate and act    
in concert, unless it be your judgment and his that there is no necessity for it. You and he will    
understand much better than I how to do it. Please do not lose time in this matter. Yours, very    
truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

me. I have shown it to Gen. McClellan, who says he will write you to-day. I am not competent to    
criticise your views; and therefore what I offer is merely in justification of myself. Of the    
two, I would rather have a point on the Railroad south of Cumberland Gap, than Nashville, first,    
because it cuts a great artery of the enemies' communication, which Nashville does not, and    
secondly because it is in the midst of loyal people, who would rally around it, while Nashville    
is not. Again, I cannot see why the movement on East Tennessee would not be a diversion in your    
favor, rather than a disadvantage, assuming that a movement towards Nashville is the main    
object.</p>    
<p>But my distress is that our friends in East Tennessee are being hanged and driven to despair,    
and even now I fear, are thinking of taking rebel arms for the sake of personal protection. In    
this we lose the most valuable stake we have in the South. My despatch, to which yours is an    
answer, was sent with the knowledge of Senator Johnson and Representative Maynard of East    
Tennessee, and they will be upon me to know the answer, which I cannot safely show them. They    
would despair---possibly resign to go and save their families somehow, or die with them.</p>    
<p>I do not intend this to be an order in any sense, but merely, as intimated before, to show you    
the grounds of my anxiety. Yours very Truly A. LINCOLN</p>

Cabinet, as soon as my duty to my country would allow me to do so. In your letter of this day's    
date, so illustrative of your just and upright character, you revive the fact that I sometime    
ago, expressed the same purpose to you, and in reminding me of this you proffer for my acceptance    
one of the highest diplomatic positions in your gift, as an additional mark of your confidence    
and esteem.</p>    
<p>"In retiring from the War Department, I feel that the mighty Army of the United States, is    
ready to do battle for the Constitution---that it is marshalled by gallant and experienced    
leaders---that it is fired with the greatest enthusiasm for the good cause; and also, that my    
successor, in this department, is my personal friend, who unites to wonderful intellect and    
vigor, the grand essential of being in earnest in the present struggle, and of being resolved    
upon a speedy and over-whelming triumph of our arms. I therefore gratefully accept the new    
distinction you have conferred upon me, and as soon as important and long neglected private    
business has been arranged, I will enter upon the important duties of the mission to which you    
have called me."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<opener>COPY --- one also sent to Gen. Halleck.<lb/>    
Brig. Genl. Buell. Executive Mansion,<lb/>    
My dear Sir: Washington, Jan. 13, 1862.</opener>    
<p>Your despatch of yesterday is received, in which you say "I have received your letter and    
Gen. McClellan's; and will, at once devote all my efforts to your views, and his."In the midst    
of my many cares, I have not seen, or asked to see, Gen. McClellan's letter to you. For my own    
views, I have not offered, and do not now offer them as orders; and while I am glad to have them    
respectfully considered, I would blame you to follow them contrary to your own clear judgment---    
unless I should put them in the form of orders. As to Gen. McClellan's views, you understand your    
duty in regard to them better than I do. With this preliminary, I state my general idea of this    
war to be that we have the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> numbers, and the enemy has the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi>    
facility of concentrating forces upon points of collision; that we must fail, unless we can find    
some way of making <hi rend="italic">our</hi> advantage an over-match for <hi rend="italic">his</hi>; and that this can only    
be done by menacing him with superior forces at <hi rend="italic">different</hi> points, at the <hi rend="italic">same</hi>    
time; so that we can safely attack, one, or both, if he makes no change; and if he    
<hi rend="italic">weakens</hi> one to <hi rend="italic">strengthen</hi> the other, forbear to attack the strengthened one,    
but seize, and hold the weakened one, gaining so much. To illustrate, suppose last summer, when    
Winchester ran away to re-inforce Mannassas, we had forborne to attack Mannassas, but had seized    
and held Winchester. I mention this to illustrate, and not to criticise. I did not lose    
confidence in McDowell, and I think less harshly of Patterson than some others seem to. In    
application of the general rule I am suggesting, every particular case will have its modifying    
circumstances, among which the most constantly present, and most difficult to meet, will be the    
want of perfect knowledge of the enemies' movements. This had it's part in the Bull-Run case; but    
worse, in that case, was the expiration of the terms of the three months men. Applying the    
principle to your case, my idea is that Halleck shall menace Columbus, and "down river"    
generally; while you menace Bowling-Green, and East Tennessee. If the enemy shall concentrate at    
Bowling-Green, do not retire    
<pb n="99"/>    
    
from his front; yet do not fight him there, either, but seize Columbus and East Tennessee, one or    
both, left exposed by the concentration at Bowling Green. It is matter of no small anxiety to me    
and one which I am sure you will not over-look, that the East Tennessee line, is so long, and    
over so bad a road. Yours very truly</p>    
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>Major-General Halleck: Washington, January 15, 1862.</p>    
<p>My dear Sir: The Germans are true and patriotic, and so far as they have got cross in Missouri    
it is upon mistake and misunderstanding. Without a knowledge of its contents Governor Koerner, of    
Illinois, will hand you this letter. He is an educated and talented German gentleman, as true a    
man as lives. With his assistance you can set everything right with the Germans. I write this    
without his knowledge, asking him at the same time, by letter, to deliver it. My clear judgment    
is that, with reference to the German element in your command, you should have Governor Koerner    
with you; and if agreeable to you and him, I will make him a brigadier-general, so that he can    
afford to so give his time. He does not wish to command in the field, though he has more military    
knowledge than many who do. If he goes into the place he will simply be an efficient, zealous,    
and unselfish assistant to you. I say all this upon intimate personal acquaintance with Governor    
Koerner. Yours, very truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>On reflection I think it will not do as a rule for the Adjutant General to attend me wherever    
I go; not that I have any objection to his presence, but that it would be an uncompensating    
incumbrance both to him and me. When it shall occur to me to go anywhere, I wish to be free to go    
at once, and not to have to notify the Adjutant General, and wait till he can get ready. It is    
better too, for the public service, that he shall give his time to the business of his office,    
and not to personal attendance on me. While I thank you for the kindness of the suggestion, my

of you is not given to General Lane, but he is to operate. . . under your supervision and    
control, and if you deem proper you may yourself command the expedition. . . ."(OR, I, VIII,

written on a letter from Jackson Grimshaw, January 31, 1862, asking the president to order a    
court of inquiry into the official conduct of Captain Reuben B. Hatch, quartermaster at Cairo,    
Illinois. Lee's reply, written below Lincoln's endorsement, recommended that Lincoln not    
interpose, since ". . . Genl. Grant has authority to appoint a court. He can do so more    
conveniently than higher authority, because on the spot. . . ."Lee forwarded to Lincoln a    
communication from Montgomery C. Meigs, February 3, 1862, which explained that Hatch's trial on a    
charge of fraud and speculation had been delayed by Grant because "there are other matters    
alleged which he [Grant] thinks should be investigated. . . . He thinks. . . great frauds will be    
developed. . . I fear that such a court would be long employed and that the services of the    
officers upon it could be ill spared. . . ."Hatch was released from arrest in April, and the    
War Claim Commission, investigating Hatch's claims in July, allowed them, "the investigation not    
having established anything of fraud or corruption in them."(Washington <hi rend="italic">Evening Star,</hi>

<p>President of the United States of America.</p>    
<p>To Her Majesty Victoria,</p>

<p>of Great Britain and Ireland,</p>    
<p>&amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., Sendeth Greeting!</p>    
<p>Great and Good Friend: By a letter from your son, His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales,    
which has just been received, I am informed of the overwhelming affliction which has fallen upon    
Your Majesty, by the untimely death of His Royal Highness the late Prince Consort, Prince Albert,    
of Saxe Coburg.</p>    
<p>The offer of condolence in such cases is a customary ceremony, which has its good uses, though    
it is conventional, and may sometimes be even insincere. But I would fain have Your Majesty    
apprehend, on this occasion, that real sympathy can exist, as real truthfulness can be practised,    
in the intercourse of Nations. The People of the United States are kindred of the People of Great    
Britain. With all our distinct national interests, objects, and aspirations, we are conscious    
that our moral strength is largely derived from that relationship, and we think we do not deceive    
ourselves when we suppose that, by constantly cherishing cordial friendship and sympathy with the    
other branches of the family to which we belong, we impart to them not less strength than we    
derive from the same connection. Accidents, however, incidental to all States, and passions,    
common to all nations, often tend to disturb the harmony so necessary and so proper between the    
two countries, and to convert them into enemies. It was reserved for Your Majesty in sending your    
son, the Heir Apparent of the British Throne, on a visit among us, to inaugurate a policy    
destined    
<pb n="118"/>    
    
to counteract these injurious tendencies, as it has been Your Majesty's manifest endeavor,    
through a reign already of considerable length and of distinguished success, to cultivate the    
friendship on our part so earnestly desired. It is for this reason that you are honored on this    
side of the Atlantic as a friend of the American People. The late Prince Consort was with    
sufficient evidence regarded as your counsellor in the same friendly relation. The American    
People, therefore, deplore his death and sympathize in Your Majesty's irreparable bereavement    
with an unaffected sorrow. This condolence may not be altogether ineffectual, since we are sure    
it emanates from only virtuous motives and natural affection. I do not dwell upon it, however,    
because I know that the Divine hand that has wounded, is the only one that can heal: And so,    
commending Your Majesty and the Prince Royal, the Heir Apparent, and all your afflicted family to    
the tender mercies of God, I remain Your Good Friend, ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

South West of Manassas.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="119"/>    
If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following questions, I shall gladly yield my plan    
to yours.</p>    
<p>1st. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>, and    
<hi rend="italic">money</hi> than mine?</p>    
<p>2nd. Wherein is a victory <hi rend="italic">more certain</hi> by your plan than mine?</p>

mine? Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

this, might it not be safest for us to cross the Ocoquan at Colchester rather than at the village    
of Ocoquan? This would cost the enemy two miles more of travel to meet us, but would, on the    
contrary, leave us two miles further from our ultimate destination.</p>

<note id="n5-118-2"><p>2 ALS and AD (enclosure?), DLC-Stanton    
Papers. The supposition that the memorandum was enclosed with this letter is based upon the fact    
that the memorandum is so described in the <hi rend="italic">Official Records</hi>. The undated memorandum is    
not, however, with the letter in the Stanton Papers, and the particular references in it to    
crossing the Occoquan suggest that it may have antedated the letter, as a memo of questions which    
Lincoln intended to put to McClellan verbally during a conference later than the memorandum of c.    
December 1, 1861 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>), but prior to the issuing of his Special War Order of January    
31, 1862 (<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>). The memorandum may have been jotted down as early as January 13, on    
which day Lincoln held a council of war with McClellan and several other generals, as well as    
cabinet members, but could scarcely have been written on February 3, since by that date Lincoln    
was already aware that McClellan would not favor his plan.</p><p>Upon receipt of Lincoln's    
Special War Order, McClellan wrote Stanton a twenty-two page letter under the same date, January    
31. Although there is no mistaking the date as McClellan wrote it on the letter, the containing    
envelope is endorsed by Lincoln "From Gen. McClellan Jan. 30. 1862."Lincoln's endorsement is    
certainly dated one day too soon, unless both the Special Order and McClellan's letter were    
prepared in advance of the dates which they bear. Beyond    
<pb n="120"/>    
    
reasonable doubt, however, the date under which McClellan incorporated his letter in his official    
"report of the operations of Army of the Potomac while under my charge,"is wrong. McClellan's    
report, dated at New York, August 4, 1863, prints the letter with numerous details at variance    
with the original letter in the Lincoln Papers, and in dating his letter February 3, instead of    
January 31, McClellan either deliberately falsified the record in an effort to support his own    
case or inadvertently committed an error which had the same effect.</p>    
<p>McClellan's report (OR, I, V, 41 ff.) stated that, after receiving Lincoln's Special Order,    
"I asked his excellency whether this order was to be regarded as final, or whether I could be    
permitted to submit in writing my objections to his plan and my reasons for preferring my own.    
Permission was accorded, and I therefore prepared the letter to the Secretary of War which is    
given below [under date of February 3 in McClellan's report, but dated January 31 in the original    
in the Lincoln Papers].</p>    
<p>"Before this had been submitted to the President he addressed me the following note:    
[Lincoln's letter of February 3, but without the enclosure, is here given by McClellan.]</p>    
<p>"These questions were substantially answered by the following letter of the same date to the    
Secretary of War:"</p>    
<p>Immediately following, under date of February 3, is the letter of January 31, altered somewhat    
in minor details in the early paragraphs and marked by the significant omission of important    
passages toward the end. The letter is too long for reproduction here in its entirety, but    
because the original contains important passages not in the <hi rend="italic">Official Records</hi>, and    
because of the strange circumstances surrounding the question of date, the heart of McClellan's    
statement is reproduced below. Portions in italic type are the passages which McClellan omitted    
in his official report:</p>    
<p>"Two bases of operations seem to present themselves for the advance of the Army of the    
Potomac.---</p>    
<p>I. That of Washington---its present position---involving a direct attack upon the enemy's    
entrenched positions at Centreville, Manassas etc, or else a movement to turn one or both flanks    
of those positions, or a combination of the two plans.</p>    
<p>"The relative force of the two armies will not justify an attack on both flanks.</p>    
<p>"An attack on his left flank alone involves a long line of wagon communication &amp; cannot    
prevent him from collecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his extreme right    
&amp; left.</p>    
<p>"Should we attack his right by the line of the Occoquan &amp; a crossing of the Potomac below    
the Occoquan &amp; near his batteries, we could perhaps prevent the junction of the enemy's    
extreme right with his centre (we <hi rend="italic">might</hi> destroy the former), we would remove the    
obstructions to the navigation of the Potomac, reduce the length of wagon transportation by    
establishing new depots at the nearest points of the Potomac, &amp; strike more directly his main    
railway communication.</p>    
<p>"The fords of the Occoquan below the mouth of Bull Run are watched by the rebels, batteries    
are said to be placed on the heights in rear (concealed by the woods), &amp; the arrangement of    
his troops is such that he can oppose some considerable resistance to a passage of the stream.    
Information has just been received to the effect that the enemy are entrenching a line of heights    
extending from the vicinity of Sangster's (Union Mills?) towards Evansport. Early in Jany.    
Sprigg's ford was occupied by Genl Rhodes with 3600 men &amp; 8 guns; there are strong reasons    
for believing that Davis' Ford is occupied.</p>    
<p>"These circumstances indicate, or prove, that the enemy anticipate the movement in question    
&amp; are prepared to resist it. Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon,    
it may be well to examine briefly its probable progress.</p>    
<p>"In the present state of affairs our columns (for the movement of so large a    
<pb n="121"/>    
    
force must be made in several columns, at least 5 or 6) can reach the Accotinck without danger;    
during the march thence to the Occoquan our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from Fairfax    
Station, Sangster's &amp; Union Mills;---this danger must be met by occupying in some force    
either the two first named places, or, better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence    
to the village of Occoquan---this occupation must be continued so long as we continue to draw    
supplies by the roads from this city, or until a battle is won.</p>    
<p>"The crossing of the Occoquan should be made at all the fords from Wolf's Run to the mouth,    
the points of crossing not being necessarily confined to the fords themselves. Should the enemy    
occupy this line in force we must, with what assistance the flotilla can afford, endeavor to    
force the passage near the mouth, thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line or be taken in    
flank himself.</p>    
<p>"Having gained the line of the Occoquan, it would be necessary to throw a column by the    
shortest route to Dumfries, partly to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the Potomac,    
partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction of Acquia, &amp; lastly to    
establish our communication with the river by the best roads, &amp; thus give us new depots.</p>    
<p>"The enemy would by this time have occupied the line of the Occoquan above Bulls Run, holding    
Brentsville in force &amp; perhaps extending his lines somewhat farther to the S.W.</p>    
<p>"Our next step would be to prevent the enemy from crossing the Occoquan between Bull Run    
&amp; Broad Run, to fall upon our right flank while moving on Brentsville; this might be effected    
by occupying Bacon [?] Church &amp; the cross roads near the mouth of Bull Run, or still more    
effectually by moving to the fords themselves &amp; preventing him from debouching on our side.    
These operations would probably be resisted, &amp; would require some time to effect them. As    
nearly at the same time as possible we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above    
Broad Run.</p>    
<p>"Having secured our right flank it would become necessary to carry Brentsville at any cost,    
for we could not leave it between our right flank &amp; main body. The final movement on the    
Railroad must be determined by circumstances existing at the time.</p>    
<p>"This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advantage possessed by the enemy in    
the strong central position he occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, &amp; a strong    
line of defence enabling him to remain on the defensive with a small force on one flank, while he    
concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action.</p>    
<p>"Should we place a portion of our force in front of Centreville while the rest crosses the    
Occoquan we commit the error of dividing our Army by a very difficult obstacle &amp; by a    
distance too great to enable the two portions to support each other, should either be attacked by    
the masses of the enemy while the other is held in check.</p>    
<p>"I should perhaps have dwelled more decidedly on the fact that the force left near Sangster's    
must be allowed to remain somewhere on that side of the Occoquan, until the decisive battle is    
over, to cover our retreat in the event of disaster, unless it should be decided to select &amp;    
entrench a new base somewhere near Dumfries---a proceeding involving much time.</p>    
<p>"After the passage of the Occoquan by the main army, this covering force could be drawn in to    
a more central &amp; less exposed position, say Brimstone Hill or nearer the Occoquan. In this    
latitude the weather will for a considerable period be very uncertain, &amp; a movement commenced    
in force on roads in tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much delayed    
by rains &amp; snow. It will therefore be next to impossible to surprise the enemy, or take him    
at a disadvantage by rapid manoeuvres;---our slow progress will enable him to divine our purposes    
&amp; take his measures accordingly. The probability is, from the best information we possess,    
that he has improved the roads leading to his lines of defense, while we must work as we    
advance.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="122"/>    
"Bearing in mind what has been said, &amp; the present unprecedented, &amp; impassable condition    
of the roads, it will be evident that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on    
this line, nor can its duration be closely calculated; it seems certain that many weeks    
<hi rend="italic">may</hi> elapse it is possible to commence the march.</p>    
<p>"Assuming the success of this operation &amp; the defeat of the enemy as certain, the    
question at once arises as to the importance of the results gained.</p>    
<p>"I think these results would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the    
evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, &amp; the moral effect of the victory--    
-important results it is true, but not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the    
enemy's main army; for he could fall back upon other positions, &amp; fight us again &amp; again,    
should the condition of his troops permit.</p>    
<p>"If he is in no condition to fight us again out of range of the entrenchments at Richmond we    
would find it a very difficult &amp; tedious matter to follow him up there---for he would destroy    
the railroad bridges &amp; otherwise impede our progress through a region where the roads are as    
bad as they well can be; &amp; we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change the    
entire theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to Richmond with a smaller available force    
&amp; at an expenditure of much more time than were we to adopt the short line at once.</p>    
<p>"We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces &amp; perfect his defensive    
measures at the very points where it is desirable to strike him where least prepared.</p>    
<p>"II. The second base of operations available for the Army of the Potomac is that of the lower    
Chesapeake Bay, which affords the shortest possible land routes to Richmond, &amp; strikes    
directly at the heart of the enemy's power in the East.</p>    
<p>"The roads in that region are passable at all seasons of the year.</p>    
<p>"The country now alluded to is much more favorable for offensive operations than that in    
front of Washington (which is <hi rend="italic">very</hi> unfavorable)---much more level---more cleared land---    
the woods less dense---soil more sandy---the spring some two or three weeks earlier.</p>    
<p>"A movement in force on that line obliges the enemy to abandon his entrenched position at    
Manassas, in order to hasten to cover Richmond &amp; Norfolk.</p>    
<p>"He <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do this, for should he permit us to occupy Richmond his destruction can be    
averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle in which he must be the assailant.</p>    
<p>"This movement if successful gives us the capital, the communications, the supplies of the    
rebels; Norfolk would fall; all the waters of the Chesapeake would be ours; all Virginia would be    
in our power; &amp; the enemy forced to abandon Tennessee &amp; North Carolina</p>    
<p>"The alternatives presented to the enemy would be to beat us in a position selected by    
ourselves; disperse; or pass beneath the Caudine Forks. [McClellan referred to a well-known    
episode in military history when the Samnites hemmed in the Romans at the "Caudine Forks"in    
southern Italy, in 321 B.C.] Should we be beaten in a battle, we have a perfectly secure retreat    
down the Peninsula upon Fort Monroe, with our flanks perfectly secured by the fleet. During the    
whole movement our left flank is covered by the water, our right is secure for the reason that    
the enemy is too distant to reach us in time---he can only oppose us in front; we bring our fleet    
into full play.</p>    
<p>"After a successful battle our position would be---Burnside forming our left, Norfolk held    
securely, our centre connecting Burnside with Buell, both by Raleigh &amp; Lynchburg, Buell in    
Eastern Tennessee &amp; Northern Alabama, Halleck at Nashville &amp; Memphis. The next movement    
would be to connect with Sherman on the left, by reducing Wilmington &amp; Charleston; to advance    
our centre into South Carolina &amp; Georgia; to push Buell either towards Montgomery, or to    
unite with the main army in Georgia; to throw Halleck southward to meet the Naval Expedition from    
New Orleans.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="123"/>    
"We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all the southern seaports; to occupy    
all the avenues of communication; to use the great outlet of the Mississip[p]i; to reestablish    
our Govt &amp; arms in Arkansas, Louisiana &amp; Texas; to force the slaves to labor for our    
subsistence instead of that of the rebels;---to bid defiance to all foreign interference. Such is    
the object I have ever had in view: this is the general plan which I have hoped to accomplish.    
For many long months I have labored to prepare the Army of the Potomac to play its part in the    
programme; from the day when I was placed in command of all our armies, I have exerted myself to    
place all the other armies in such a condition that they too could perform their allotted duties.    
Should it be determined to operate from the lower Chesapeake, the point of landing which promises    
the most brilliant results is Urbana on the lower Rappahanock. This point is easily reached by    
vessels of heavy draught, it is neither occupied nor observed by the enemy; it is but one long    
march from West Point, the Key of that region, &amp; thence but two marches to Richmond.</p>    
<p>"A rapid movement from Urbana would probably cut off Magruder in the <hi rend="italic">Peninsula</hi>,    
&amp; enable us to occupy Richmond before it could be strongly reinforced. Should we fail in that    
we could, with the cooperation of the Navy, cross the James &amp; throw ourselves in rear of    
Richmond, thus forcing the enemy to come out &amp; attack us---for his position would be    
untenable, with us on the southern bank of the river.</p>    
<p>"Should circumstances render it not advisable to land at Urbana we can use Mob Jack Bay,---    
or---the worst coming to the worst---we can take Fort Monroe as a base, &amp; operate with    
complete security, altho' with less celerity &amp; brilliancy of results, up the Peninsula. To    
reach whatever point may be selected as the base, a large amount of cheap water transportation    
must be collected---consisting mainly of canal boats, barges, wood boats, schooners etc towed by    
small steamers---all of a very different character from those required for all previous    
expeditions. This can certainly be accomplished within 30 days from the time the order is    
given.</p>    
<p>"I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judgment, be adopted, to select Urbana    
as the landing place of the first detachments. To transport by water four (4) Divisions of    
Infantry, with their batteries, the Regular Infty, a few wagons, one bridge train &amp; a few    
squadrons of cavalry---making the vicinity of Hooker's position the place of embarkation for as    
many as possible. To move the Regular Cavalry, &amp; Reserve Artillery, the remaining bridge    
trains, &amp; wagons to a point somewhere near Cape Lookout, then ferry them over the river by    
means of North River ferry boats, march them over to the Rappahannock (covering the movement by    
an Infantry force placed near Heathsville), cross the Rappahannock in a similar way. The expense    
&amp; difficulty of the movement will thus be much diminished (a saving of transportation of    
about 10,000 horses!), &amp; the result none the less certain.</p>    
<p>"The concentration of the cavalry etc in the lower counties of Maryland can be effected    
without exciting suspicion, &amp; the movement made without delay from that cause. This movement,    
if adopted, will not at all expose the city of Washington to danger. The total force to be thrown    
upon the new line would be (according to circumstances) from 110,000 to 140,000. I hope to use    
the latter number, by bringing fresh troops into Washington, &amp; still leaving it quite    
safe.</p>    
<p>"I fully realize that, in all projects offered, time is probably the most valuable    
consideration---it is my decided opinion that in that point of view the 2nd plan should be    
adopted. It is possible, nay highly probable, that the weather &amp; state of the roads may be    
such as to delay the direct movement from Washington, with its unsatisfactory results &amp; great    
risks, far beyond the time required to complete the second plan.</p>    
<p>"IN THE FIRST CASE, we can fix no definite time for an advance---the roads have gone from bad    
to worse---nothing like their present condition has ever been known here before---they are    
impassable at present, <hi rend="italic">we are entirely at the mercy</hi>    
<pb n="124"/>    
    
<hi rend="italic">of the weather. In the second plan, we can calculate almost to a day, &amp; with but little    
regard to the season.</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"If at the expense of 30 days delay we can gain a decisive victory which will probably end    
the war, it is far cheaper than to gain a battle tomorrow that produces no final results, &amp;    
may require years of warfare &amp; expenditure to follow up.</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"Such, I think, is precisely the difference between the two plans discussed in this long    
letter. A battle gained at Manassas will result merely in the possession of the field of combat--    
-at best we can follow it up but slowly, unless we do what I now propose, viz:---change the line    
of operations.</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"On the Mannassas line the rebels can, if well enough disciplined (&amp; we have every    
reason to suppose that to be the case) dispute our advance, over bad roads, from position to    
position.</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"When we have gained the battle, if we do gain it, the question will at once arise---`What    
are we to do next</hi>?'---</p><p>"It is by no means certain that we can beat them at    
Manassas.</p>    
<p>"On the other line I regard success as certain by all the chances of war.</p>    
<p>"We demoralize the enemy, by forcing him to abandon his prepared position for one which we    
have chosen, in which all is in our favor, &amp; where success must produce immense results. My    
judgement as a General is clearly in favor of this project.</p>    
<p>"Nothing is CERTAIN in war---but all the chances are in favor of this movement.</p>    
<p>"So much am I in favor of the southern line of operations, that I would prefer the move from    
Fort Monroe as a base, as a certain, tho' less brilliant movement than that from Urbana, to an    
attack upon Manassas.</p>    
<p>"I know that his Excellency the President, you &amp; I all agree in our wishes---&amp; that    
our desire is to bring this war to as prompt a close as the means in our possession will permit.    
I believe that the mass of the people have entire confidence in us---I am sure of it---let us    
then look only to the great result to be accomplished, &amp; disregard everything else.</p>    
<p><hi rend="italic">"In conclusion I would respectfully, but firmly, advise that I may be authorized to    
undertake at once the movement by Urbana</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"I believe that it can be carried into execution so nearly simultaneously with the final    
advance of Buell &amp; Halleck that the columns will support each other</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"I will stake my life, my reputation on the result---more than that, I will stake upon it    
the success of our cause.</hi>    
<hi rend="italic">"I hope but little from the attack on Manassas;---my judgment is against it. Foreign    
complications may entirely change the state of affairs, &amp; render very different plans    
necessary. In that event I will be ready to submit them."</hi> (DLC-RTL).</p><p>McClellan's    
report (<hi rend="italic">loc. cit.</hi>, p. 45) continued as follows:</p>    
<p>"This letter must have produced some effect upon the mind of the President, since the    
execution of his order was not required, although it was not revoked as formally as it had been    
issued. . . ."</p>    
<p>As a possible solution to the apparent contradictions in dates, it may be concluded that    
McClellan composed his letter of January 31 following a prior conference with Lincoln at which    
the two plans were discussed, that Stanton failed to forward McClellan's letter to the president    
until after Lincoln had written McClellan on February 3, and that McClellan changed the date of    
his letter from January 31 to February 3 when he drew up his report in 1863, in order to avoid    
the apparent contradiction in dates. If this conclusion is correct, the error of one day    
appearing in Lincoln's endorsement on the envelope containing McClellan's letter becomes more    
understandable, in that Lincoln probably so endorsed it upon receiving it from Stanton sometime    
after February 3. In this event McClellan never did specifically reply to Lincoln's questions of    
February 3, but on January 31 had anticipated them in some degree and in part answered    
<pb n="125"/>    
    
them before Lincoln put them in writing. In conclusion it may be noted that the questions posed    
in Lincoln's undated memorandum, which the <hi rend="italic">Official Records</hi> describe as an enclosure    
with Lincoln's letter, are more adequately disposed of by McClellan than are the questions posed    
by Lincoln in the letter itself. This fact tends to confirm the supposition that the memorandum    
was written prior to both Lincoln's letter of February 3 and McClellan's letter of January    
31.</p></note>

<p>King of Siam,</p>

<p>Great and Good Friend: I have received Your Majesty's two letters of the date of February    
14th., 1861.</p>    
<p>I have also received in good condition the royal gifts which accompanied those letters,---    
namely, a sword of costly materials and exquisite workmanship; a photographic likeness of Your    
Majesty and of Your Majesty's beloved daughter; and also two elephants' tusks of length and    
magnitude such as indicate that they could have belonged only to an animal which was a native of    
Siam.</p>    
<p>Your Majesty's letters show an understanding that our laws forbid the President from receiving    
these rich presents as personal    
<pb n="126"/>    
    
treasures. They are therefore accepted in accordance with Your Majesty's desire as tokens of your    
good will and friendship for the American People. Congress being now in session at this capital,    
I have had great pleasure in making known to them this manifestation of Your Majesty's    
munificence and kind consideration.</p>    
<p>Under their directions the gifts will be placed among the archives of the Government, where    
they will remain perpetually as tokens of mutual esteem and pacific dispositions more honorable    
to both nations than any trophies of conquest could be.</p>    
<p>I appreciate most highly Your Majesty's tender of good offices in forwarding to this    
Government a stock from which a supply of elephants might be raised on our own soil. This    
Government would not hesitate to avail itself of so generous an offer if the object were one    
which could be made practically useful in the present condition of the United States.</p>    
<p>Our political jurisdiction, however, does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the    
multiplication of the elephant, and steam on land, as well as on water, has been our best and    
most efficient agent of transportation in internal commerce.</p>    
<p>I shall have occasion at no distant day to transmit to Your Majesty some token of indication    
of the high sense which this Government entertains of Your Majesty's friendship.</p>    
<p>Meantime, wishing for Your Majesty a long and happy life, and for the generous and emulous    
People of Siam the highest possible prosperity, I commend both to the blessing of Almighty God.

<p>Abraham Lincoln,</p>    
<p>President of the United States of America,</p>    
<p>To all to whom these Presents shall come Greeting:</p>    
<p>Whereas, it appears that at a Term of the Circuit Court of the United States of America for    
the Southern District of New York held in the month of November A.D. 1861, Nathaniel Gordon was    
indicted and convicted for being engaged in the Slave Trade, and was by the said Court sentenced    
to be put to death by hanging by the neck, on Friday the 7th. day of February, A.D. 1862;</p>    
<p>And whereas, a large number of respectable citizens have earnestly besought me to commute the    
said sentence of the said Nathaniel Gordon to a term of imprisonment for life, which application    
I have felt it to be my duty to refuse;</p>    
<p>And whereas, it has seemed to me probable that the unsuccessful application made for the    
commutation of his sentence may have prevented the said Nathaniel Gordon from making the    
necessary preparation for the awful change which awaits him:</p>    
<p>Now, therefore, be it known, that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of    
America, have granted and do hereby grant unto him, the said Nathaniel Gordon, a respite of the    
above recited sentence, until Friday the twenty-first day of February, A.D. 1862, between the    
hours of twelve o'clock at noon and three o'clock in the afternoon of the said day, when the said    
sentence shall be executed.</p>    
<p>In granting this respite, it becomes my painful duty to admonish the prisoner that,    
relinquishing all expectation of pardon by Human Authority, he refer himself alone to the mercy    
of the common God and Father of all men.</p>    
<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto signed my name and caused the Seal of the United States    
to be affixed.</p>

<note id="n5-128-1"><p>1 DS, ORB. Attorney General Bates replied    
on February 4, 1862, to a note, presumably not extant, from Lincoln on the same date requesting    
an opinion as    
<pb n="129"/>    
</p><p>to whether the executive could lawfully grant to a convict a "respite of his sentence,    
without relieving him altogether of the death penalty."Bates gave his opinion that "I have no    
doubt that you can. . . . A reprieve does not annul the sentence. . . . It only prolongs the    
time."(DLC-RTL). Although many previous seizures of slave ships had been made, Captain    
Nathaniel Gordon of Maine was the only slave-trader ever convicted and hanged in accordance with    
federal law. So numerous were the failures of juries to convict, that many believed Gordon    
entitled to executive clemency as a victim of unprecedented juridical rigor. The language of    
Lincoln's reprieve leaves no doubt of his concurrence in the justice of the sentence, but    
indicates his awareness that public sympathy had encouraged Gordon to believe a pardon would be    
granted.</p></note>

on the ground that "The French minister at Washington presents. . . to his excellency [the

quality, social position, or profession."Seward's reply of February 3 advised Dayton, "Let the

<p>Lieutenant---General Scott has advised me that, while he would cheerfully accept a commission    
as additional minister to Mexico, with a view to promote the interests of the United States and    
of peace, yet his infirmities are such that he could not be able to reach the capital of that    
country by any existing mode of travel, and he therefore deems it his duty to decline the    
important mission I had proposed for him. For this reason I withdraw the nomination in this

made without any knowledge of it on his part. ABRAHAM LINCOLN.</p>

<opener>March 6, 1862</opener>    
<p>Fellow-citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives,</p>    
<p>I recommend the adoption of a Joint Resolution by your honorable bodies which shall be    
substantially as follows:</p>    
<p>"Resolved that the United States ought to co-operate with any state which may adopt gradual    
abolishment of slavery, giving to    
<pb n="145"/>    
    
such state pecuniary aid, to be used by such state in it's discretion, to compensate for the    
inconveniences<ref target="n5-145-1">1</ref>    
 public and private, produced by such change of    
system"</p>    
<p>If the proposition contained in the resolution does not meet the approval of Congress and the    
country, there is the end; but if it does command such approval, I deem it of importance that the    
states and people immediately interested, should be at once distinctly notified of the fact, so    
that they may begin to consider whether to accept or reject it. The federal government would find    
it's highest interest in such a measure, as one of the most efficient means of self-    
preservation.<ref target="n5-145-2">2</ref>    
 The leaders of the existing insurrection entertain the    
hope that this government will ultimately be forced to acknowledge the independence of some part    
of the disaffected region, and that all the slave states North of such part will then say "the    
Union, for which we have struggled, being already gone, we now choose to go with the Southern    
section."To deprive them of this hope, substantially ends the rebellion; and the initiation of    
emancipation completely deprives them of it, as to all the states initiating it. The point is not    
that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the states tolerating slavery would very soon, if at all, initiate    
emancipation; but that, while the offer is equally made to all, the more Northern shall, by such    
initiation, make it certain<ref target="n5-145-3">3</ref>    
 to the more Southern, that in no event,    
will the former ever join the latter, in their proposed confederacy. I say "initiation"    
because, in my judgment, gradual, and not sudden emancipation, is better for all. In the mere    
financial, or pecuniary view, any member of Congress,<ref target="n5-145-4">4</ref>    
 with the    
census-tables and Treasury-reports before him, can readily see for himself how very soon the    
current expenditures of this war would purchase, at fair valuation, all the slaves in any named    
State. Such a proposition, on the part of the general government, sets up no claim of a right, by    
federal authority, to interfere with slavery within state limits, referring, as it does, the    
absolute<ref target="n5-145-5">5</ref>    
 control of the subject, in each case, to the state and it's    
people, immediately interested. It is proposed as a matter of perfectly free choice with    
them.<ref target="n5-145-6">6</ref>    
</p>    
<p>In the annual message last December, I thought fit to say "The Union must be preserved; and    
hence all indispensable means must be employed."I said this, not hastily, but deliberately. War    
has been made, and continues to be, an indispensable means to this end. A practical re-    
acknowledgement of the national authority would render the war unnecessary, and it would at once    
cease. If, however, resistance continues, the war must also continue; and it is impossible to    
foresee all the incidents, which may attend<ref target="n5-145-7">7</ref>    
    
<pb n="146"/>    
    
and all the ruin which may follow<ref target="n5-146-1">1</ref>    
 it. Such as may seem indispensable,    
or may obviously promise great efficiency towards ending the struggle, must and will come.</p>    
<p>The proposition now made, though an offer only, I hope it may be esteemed no offence to ask    
whether the pecuniary consideration tendered would not be of more value to the States and private    
persons concerned,<ref target="n5-146-2">2</ref>    
 than are the institution, and property in it, in    
the present aspect of affairs.<ref target="n5-146-3">3</ref>    
</p>    
<p>While it is true that the adoption of the proposed resolution would be merely initiatory, and    
not within itself a practical measure, it is recommended in the hope that it would soon lead to    
important practical results. In full view of my great responsibility to my God, and to my<ref target="n5-146-4">4</ref>    
 country, I earnestly<ref target="n5-146-5">5</ref>    
 beg the attention of    
Congress and the people to the subject. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>My dear Sir: Mr. James F. B. Marshall, of Mass. is now with me on the question of the Honolulu

fierce, now the Col. is no longer alive to defend him. I presume, however, we shall have no rest    
from it. Mr. Marshall appears to be a very intelligent gentleman, and well acquainted with the    
affairs of the Sandwich Islands. The California delegation also expect the place for some one of    
their citizens. In self-defence I am disposed to say "Make a selection and send it to me."

this letter March 7, 1863. Seward had requested in a note on March 5, 1862, that Lincoln "see Mr    
Marshall, at some time, a little at leisure"on the subject of the Hawaiian Islands. James F. B.    
Marshall of Boston had resided in Hawaii since 1838 and had established a business there.    
Presumably he represented strong opposition to Thomas J. Dryer, whom Lincoln had appointed

present instance. I must therefore decline to suspend them."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.).</p>    
<p>At 1 A.M. on March 10, McClellan replied, "You have entirely misunderstood me, and the idea I    
intended to convey was simply that I could not, under the pressure of the new aspect of affairs,    
immediately carry out the President's orders as to the formation of army corps. . . . I regard it    
as a military necessity that the divisions should move to the front at once, without waiting for    
the formation of army corps. . . . If the leave to suspend the order be granted, there will be no    
unreasonable delay in the formation of army corps. I await your reply. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.,    
p. 740).</p>    
<p>Stanton replied immediately, ". . . if you think the terms of the order as it stands would. .    
. retard or. . . restrain movements that circumstances require to be made before the army corps    
are formed, I will assume the responsibility of suspending the order for that purpose. . . ."    
(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p. 741).</p>    
<p>McClellan replied at 2:50 A.M., "Your reply received. The troops are in motion. I thank you    
for your dispatch. It relieves me much, and you will be convinced that I have not asked too much    
of you."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.).</p>    
<p>The corps assignments were issued in McClellan's <hi rend="italic">General Orders No</hi>. 151, March 13,    
1862. McClellan's General Report, August 4, 1863, made the following comment on <hi rend="italic">Lincoln's    
General War Order No</hi>2: ". . . I had always been in favor of the principle of. . . army    
corps, but preferred deferring its practical execution until some little experience in. . .    
battle should show what general officers were most competent. . . . These views had frequently    
been expressed by me to the President and. . . Cabinet. It was therefore with as much regret as    
surprise that I learned the existence of this order. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p. 50).</p></note>

late special Message to Congress. Your paper, however, intimates that the proposition, though    
well-intentioned, must fail on the score of expense. I do hope you will reconsider this. Have you    
noticed the facts that less than one half-day's cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in    
Delaware, at four hundred dollars per head?---that eighty-seven days cost of this war would pay    
for all in Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri at the same price?    
Were those states to take the step, do you doubt that it would shorten the war more than eighty    
seven days, and thus be an actual saving of expense. Please look at these things, and consider    
whether there should not be another article in the Times? Yours very truly, A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>I thank you, Mr. TRAIN, for your kindness in presenting me with this truly elegant and highly    
creditable specimen of the handiwork of the mechanics of your State of Massachusetts, and I beg    
of you to express my hearty thanks to the donors. It displays a perfection of workmanship which I    
really wish I had time to acknowledge in more fitting words, and I might then follow your idea    
that it is suggestive, for it is evidently expected that a good deal of whipping is to be done.    
But, as we meet here socially, let us not think only of whipping rebels, or of those who seem to    
think only of whipping negroes, but of those who seem to think only of whipping negroes, but of    
those pleasant days which it is to be hoped are in store for us, when, seated behind a good pair    
of horses, we can crack our whips and drive through a peaceful, happy and prosperous land. With    
this idea, gentlemen, I must leave you for my business duties.</p>

<p>My dear Sir: As to the expensiveness of the plan of gradual emancipation with compensation,    
proposed in the late Message, please allow me one or two brief suggestions.</p>    
<p>Less than one half-day's cost of this war would pay for all the slaves in Delaware at four    
hundred dollars per head:</p>    
<p>Thus, all the slaves in Delaware, by the Census of 1860, are 	1798</p>    
<p>	400</p>    
<p>	---------</p>    
<p>Cost of the slaves, 	$ 719,200.</p>    
<p>One day's cost of the war 	"2,000,000.</p>    
<p>Again, less than eighty seven days cost of this war would, at the same price, pay for all in    
Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Kentucky, and Missouri.</p>    
<p>Thus, slaves in Delaware 	1798</p>    
<p>""Maryland 	87,188</p>    
<p>""Dis. of Col. 	3,181</p>    
<p>""Kentucky 	225,490</p>    
<p>""Missouri 	114,965</p>    
<p>	-----------</p>    
<p>	432,622</p>    
<p>	400</p>    
<p>	-----------</p>    
<p>Cost of the slaves 	$173,048,800</p>    
<p>Eightyseven days' cost of the war 	"174,000,000.</p>    
<p>Do you doubt that taking the initiatory steps on the part of those states and this District,    
would shorten the war more than eighty-seven days, and thus be an actual saving of expense?</p>    
<p>A word as to the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of incurring the expence. Suppose, for    
instance, a State devises and adopts a system by which the institution absolutely ceases therein    
by a named day---say January 1st. 1882. Then, let the sum to be paid to such state by the United    
States, be ascertained by taking from the Census of 1860, the number of slaves within the state,    
and multiplying that number by four hundred---the United States to pay such sum to the state in    
twenty equal annual instalments, in six per cent. bonds of the United States.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="161"/>    
The sum thus given, as to <hi rend="italic">time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manner</hi>, I think would not be half as    
onerous, as would be an equal sum, raised <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, for the indefinite prossecution of the    
war; but of this you can judge as well as I.</p>

presence of this document, which is probably a memorandum even though written on a telegraph    
blank, in General Ethan A. Hitchcock's papers may be accounted for by reason of the fact that on    
April 2 Stanton submitted to Adjutant General Thomas and General Hitchcock the papers concerned    
with McClellan's operations in order that an examination and report might be made on the question    
of whether McClellan had followed Lincoln's orders, particularly with reference to the defenses    
of Washington (OR, I, XI, III, 57). On March 18, McClellan wrote Stanton, "In order to carry out    
the object of this army it has now become necessary that its commander should have the entire    
control of affairs around Fort Monroe. I would. . . suggest that the. . . method. . . would be to    
merge the Dept of Virginia into that of the Potomac. . . . I. . . request. . . the present Comdr    
of the Dept Virginia be assigned to some other command. . . ."(DLC-RTL). This suggestion was    
not followed, but on March 26 McClellan was given command over Fort Monroe and all Wool's forces,    
Wool agreeing to co-operate to the full. On April 3, however, when it became apparent that    
McClellan was unable to command all that he was taking over, and perhaps because of growing    
uneasiness on the part of both Lincoln and Stanton at McClellan's overweening dispatches, Wool    
was ordered to "continue in command of Fort Monroe and the troops heretofore assigned to the    
Department of Virginia, and General McClellan will command the troops constituting the Army of    
the Potomac."(OR, I, XI, III, 65). Wool was promoted to major general for gallant conduct in    
taking the city of Norfolk on May 10, rather than for the reason indicated in Lincoln's    
memorandum to Stanton on March 18.</p></note>

not been located, but his reply to Lincoln, presumably incorrectly dated by Greeley "Mar. 24,"    
and certainly incorrectly cataloged in the Lincoln Papers as "Nov. 24, 1862,"reads as    
follows:</p><p>"I thank you for your kind letter of yesterday.</p>    
<p>"I am sure you will find great patience in the country as well as in Congress with regard to    
all action respecting slavery if it can only be felt that <hi rend="italic">things are going ahead</hi>. The    
stagnation of the grand Army has given life to all manner of projects which would be quiet if the    
War had been going vigorously on. If you think it best that the bill for Emancipation in the    
district shall embody a clause of submission to the people of the district, it can easily be so    
amended. I will advocate it in the Tribune if you desire it. If such vote be deemed requisite, I    
hope it may be taken on the 4th of July next.</p>    
<p>"I hear with regret that there is danger of difference between the Secretary of War and Gen.    
Fremont. I pray you to see that this be obviated. I do not know that F. is a great general; but I    
<hi rend="italic">do</hi> know that our loyal people, with scarcely an exception, are anxious that he should be    
permitted to <hi rend="italic">show</hi> what he is. Now if he is left without a decent force---Army    
<hi rend="italic">corps</hi>---or not allowed to select his own staff, it will be generally thought that he has    
been crippled, and the government will be blamed for whatever ill [?] fortune [?] may befall.    
Pray look to this."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>Sir: I really wish Jesse W. Fell, of Illinois, to be appointed a Paymaster in the Regular    
Army, at farthest, as early as the 1st. of July 1862. I wish nothing to interfere with this; and    
I have so written as much as two months ago, I think. Yours truly</p>

<p>Your note to Mr. Edwards, together with that from the War Department to yourself, has been    
handed to me by your brother John.<ref target="n5-175-3">3</ref>    
 For me to appoint "Joe"<ref target="n5-175-4">4</ref>    
 to the Army, and then let him resign his present position is what is    
objectionable, because it is a substantial transfer. The objection is the setting of examples by    
which every body in all arms of the service, are set to studying whether they can not squirm    
round into a position more satisfactory to themselves. A rule, to cut off this, is a necessity.

<opener>Major General McClellan. Washington,<lb/>    
My dear Sir. April 9. 1862</opener>    
<p>Your despatches complaining that you are not properly sustained, while they do not offend me,    
do pain me very much.</p>    
<p>Blencker's Division was withdrawn from you before you left here; and you knew the pressure    
under which I did it, and, as I thought, acquiesced in it---certainly not without reluctance.</p>    
<p>After you left, I ascertained that less than twenty thousand unorganized men, without a    
single field battery, were all you designed to be left for the defence of Washington, and    
Manassas Junction; and part of this even, was to go to Gen. Hooker's old position. Gen. Banks'    
corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was diverted, and tied up on the line of Winchester    
and Strausburg, and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac, and the    
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented, (or would present, when McDowell and Sumner should    
be gone) a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahanock, and sack Washington.    
My explicit order that Washington should, by the judgment of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the commanders of Army    
corps, be left entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that drove me to detain    
McDowell.</p>    
<p>I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Mannassas    
Junction; but when that arrangement was broken up, and <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi> was substituted for it,    
of course I was not satisfied. I was constrained to substitute something for it myself. And now    
allow me to ask "Do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond, <hi rend="italic">via</hi>    
Mannassas Junction, to this city to be entirely open, except what resistance could be presented    
by less than twenty thousand unorganized troops?"This is a question which the country will not    
allow me to evade.</p>    
<p>There is a curious mystery about the <hi rend="italic">number</hi> of the troops now with you. When I    
telegraphed you on the 6th. saying you had over a hundred thousand with you, I had just obtained    
from the Secretary of War, a statement, taken as he said, from your own returns, making 108,000    
then with you, and <hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to you. You now say you will have but 85,000, when all    
<hi rend="italic">en route</hi> to you shall have reached you. How can the discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted    
for?</p>    
<p>As to Gen. Wool's command, I understand it is doing for you    
<pb n="185"/>    
    
precisely what a like number of your own would have to do, if that command was away.</p>    
<p>I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for you, is with you by this time; and if so,    
I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain    
upon you---that is, he will gain faster, by <hi rend="italic">fortifications</hi> and <hi rend="italic">re-inforcements</hi>,    
than you can by re-inforcements alone.</p>    
<p>And, once more let me tell you, it is indispensable to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> that you strike a blow.    
<hi rend="italic">I</hi> am powerless to help this. You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted,    
that going down the Bay in search of a field, instead of fighting at or near Mannassas, was only    
shifting, and not surmounting, a difficulty---that we would find the same enemy, and the same, or    
equal, intrenchments, at either place. The country will not fail to note---is now noting---that    
the present hesitation to move upon an intrenched enemy, is but the story of Manassas    
repeated.</p>    
<p>I beg to assure you that I have never written you, or spoken to you, in greater kindness of    
feeling than now, nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you, so far as in my most anxious    
judgment, I consistently can. <hi rend="italic">But you must act</hi>. Yours very truly</p>

<p>On the 26th. June 1860, the Senate approved of the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce between    
the United States and Nic aragua signed on the 16th. March, 1859, with certain amendments.</p>    
<p>On the next day, namely, 27th. June, 1860, the Senate adopted a resolution extending the    
period for the exchange of the ratifications of the Treaty, for six months from that day, that    
is, until the 27th. December, 1860.</p>    
<p>Altho' the amendments of the Senate were immediately transmitted to our Minister in Nicaragua    
for submission to the Government of that Republic, he failed, notwithstanding earnest efforts, to    
induce that government to call an extra session of Congress, to take into consideration the    
amendments of the Senate of the United States, within the supplementary time named in the    
Resolution of 27th. June, 1860, for the exchange of ratifications.</p>    
<p>It was not until the 25th. March, 1861---nearly three months after the expiration of the six    
months extended by the Senate Resolution, that the Congress of Nicaragua acted favorably upon the    
amendments of the Senate of the United States.</p>    
<p>A translation of the decree of the Nicaraguan Government approving the Treaty as amended, with    
an additional amendment is herewith enclosed.</p>    
<p>It will be perceived that while the ratification of Nicaragua recites literally the    
<hi rend="italic">second</hi> amendment of the Senate, and accepts it with an additional clause, it does not,    
in explicit terms, accept the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> amendment of the Senate, striking out the last    
clause of the 16th. Article.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="191"/>    
That amendment is of so much importance, that the adoption or rejection of it by the Government    
of Nicaragua should not be left to construction or inference.</p>    
<p>The final amendment of that government properly extended the time of exchanging ratifications    
for an additional twelve months. That time has expired. For obvious reasons connected with our    
internal affairs, the subject has not sooner been submitted to the Senate, but the Treaty is now    
laid before that Body, with this brief historical sketch and the decree of the Nicaraguan    
Government, for such further advice as may be deemed necessary and proper in regard to the    
acceptance or rejection of the amendments of Nicaragua. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>Fellow citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives.</p>    
<p>The Act entitled "An Act for the release of certain persons held to service, or labor in the    
District of Columbia"has this day been approved, and signed.</p>    
<p>I have never doubted the constitutional authority of congress to abolish slavery in this    
District; and I have ever desired to see the national capital freed from the institution in some    
satisfactory way. Hence there has never been, in my mind, any question upon the subject, except    
the one of expediency, arising in view of all the circumstances. If there be matters within and    
about this act, which might have taken a course or shape, more satisfactory to my jud[g]ment, I    
do not attempt to specify them. I am gratified that the two principles of compensation, and    
colonization, are both recognized, and practically applied in the act.</p>    
<p>In the matter of compensation, it is provided that claims may be presented within ninety days    
from the passage of the act "but not thereafter"; and there is no saving for minors, femes-    
covert, insane, or absent persons. I presume this is an omission by mere over-sight, and I    
recommened that it be supplied by an amendatory or supplemental act. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

hand but signed by Lincoln, is written on a letter from Henry F. Meyer to Lincoln, April 8, 1862.    
The date in indistinct but appears to be April 18. The petition and documents attached show that    
the case had already gone to Stanton, and that no action had been taken. Meyer, an architect and    
civil engineer, was a member of the Engineer Corps of the Fifth New York Militia, who at the end    
of a three months' enlistment in the spring of 1861, had been briefly employed by the Coastal    
Survey and had then returned to New York City to organize as captain a company in a new regiment.    
Being attacked and seriously wounded one night by unidentified assailants in Central Park, Meyer    
was confined to a hospital for a long time. Upon his release, he found himself mustered out of    
service. His petition was for back pay and expenses for recruiting his company.</p></note>

heretofore, you are entirely right. So far, however, as it assumes that, in my judgment, your    
imprisonment mentioned, was wholly undeserved, an explanatory word from me is due. I think you    
made a mistake which justified men having less evidence to the contrary than I had, to suspect    
your loyalty, and to act accordingly. The arrest, though made by my general authority, was in    
fact made without my knowledge at the time; but being done, the question of undoing it was a    
little different from that of the original making; and required a little time to solve it

<p>This order was prepared with reference to <hi rend="italic">a definite number</hi> of arms expected to be

precisely the same quality appraised at different prices at another time. I expected that when    
under the clause the price of a particular quality of gun was fixed it would stand throughout the

Halleck replied from Pittsburg Landing on April 26, "Troops cannot be detached from here on the

<p>Sir; In answer to the Resolution of the Senate in relation to General Charles Stone, I    
respectfully state that he was arrested and imprisoned under my authority and with my sanction,    
upon evidence which, whether he be guilty or innocent, required in my judgment such proceedings    
to be had against him for the safety and welfare of the Country. He has not been tried because in    
the state of Military operations at the time of his arrest, and ever since, the Officers to    
constitute a Court, and for Witnesses, could not be withdrawn from duty, without serious injury    
to the service. He will be tried without any unnecessary delay, the Charges and Specifications    
will be furnished him in due season, and every facility for his defence will be afforded by the    
War Department. Respectfully Yours, ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<opener>Major General McClellan. Fort Monroe, Va.<lb/>    
My dear Sir: May 9, 1862.</opener>    
<p>I have just assisted the Secretary of War in framing the part of a despatch to you, relating    
to Army Corps, which despatch of course will have reached you long before this will. I wish to    
say a few words to you privately on this subject. I ordered the Army Corps organization not only    
on the unanimous opinion of the twelve Generals whom you had selected and assigned as Generals of    
Division, but also on the unanimous opinion of every <hi rend="italic">military man</hi> I could get an opinion    
from, and every modern military book, yourself only expected. Of course, I did not, on my own    
judgment, pretend to understand the subject. I now think it indispensable for you to know how    
your struggle against it is received in quarters which we cannot entirely disregard. It is looked    
upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets, and to persecute and degrade their supposed    
rivals. I have had no word from Sumner, Heintzelman, or Keyes.<ref target="n5-208-2">2</ref>    
The commanders of these Corps are of course the three highest officers with    
you, but I am constantly told that you consult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz John    
Porter, and perhaps General Franklin.<ref target="n5-208-3">3</ref>    
I do not say these complaints are true or just; but at all events it is proper you should know of their    
existence. Do the Commanders of Corps disobey your orders in any thing?</p>    
<p>When you relieved General Hamilton<ref target="n5-208-4">4</ref>    
of his command the other day, you thereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in    
the Senate. And here let me say, not as applicable to you personally, that Senators and    
Representatives speak of me in their places as they please, without question; and that officers    
of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to them for taking no greater liberty with    
them.</p>    
<p>But, to return, are you strong enough-are you strong enough, even with my help-to set your    
foot upon the necks of Sumner,</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="209"/>    
Heintzelman, and Keyes all at once? This is a practical and very serious question for you.</p>    
<p>The success of your army and the cause of the country are the same; and of course I only    
desire the good of the cause. Yours truly. A. LINCOLN.</p>

reorganize the army corps. I am not willing to be held responsible for the present arrangement,    
experience having proved it to be very bad, and it having very nearly resulted in a most    
disastrous defeat. I wish either to return to the organization by division or else be authorized    
to relieve incompetent commanders of army corps. Had I been one-half hour later on the field on    
the 5th we would have been routed. . . . Notwithstanding my positive orders I was informed of    
nothing that had occurred. . . . At least a thousand lives were really sacrificed by the    
organization into corps.</p><p>"I have too much regard for the lives of my comrades and too deep    
an interest in the success of our cause to hesitate for a moment. I learn that you are equally in

Royal, and New Orleans, shall so far cease and determine from and after the first day of June,    
next, that commercial intercourse with those ports, except as to persons, things, and    
information, contraband of war, may, from that time, be carried on, subject to the laws of the    
United States and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations which are prescribed by    
the Secretary of the Treasury in his order of this date, which is appended to this

knows the forces and resources the public agents have brought into employment to sustain a    
Government against which there has been brought not one complaint of real injury committed    
against society, at home or abroad. You all may recollect that in taking up the sword thus forced    
into our hands this Government appealed to the prayers of the pious and the good, and declared    
that it placed its whole dependence upon the favor of God. I now humbly and reverently, in your    
presence, reiterate the acknowledgment of that dependence, not doubting

<p>Soldiers of the Twelfth Indiana Regiment!</p>    
<p>It has not been customary heretofore, nor will it be hereafter, for me to say something to    
every regiment passing in review. It occurs too frequently for me to have speeches ready on all    
occasions. As you have paid such a mark of respect to the Chief Magistrate, it appears proper    
that I should say a word or two in reply.</p>    
<p>Your Colonel<ref target="n5-213-2">2</ref>    
 has thought fit, on his own account and in your name,    
to say that you are satisfied with the manner in which I have performed my part in the    
difficulties which have surrounded the nation. For your kind expressions I am extremely grateful,    
but, on the other hand, I assure you that the nation is more indebted to you, and such as you,    
than to me. It is upon the brave hearts and strong arms of the people of the country that our    
reliance has been placed in support of free government and free institutions.</p>    
<p>For the part that you and the brave army of which you are a part have, under Providence,    
performed in this great struggle, I tender more thanks---greatest thanks that can be possibly    
due---and especially to this regiment, which has been the subject of good report. The thanks of    
the nation will follow you, and may God's blessing rest upon you now and forever. I hope that    
upon your return to your homes you will find your friends and loved ones well and happy. I bid    
you farewell.</p>

<p>To the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>    
<p>The third section of the "Act further to provide the efficiency of the navy,"approved 21st    
December, 1861, provides: "That the President of the United States, by and with the advice and    
consent of the Senate, shall have the authority to detail from the retired list of the navy for    
the command of squadrons and single ships such officers as he may believe that the good of the    
service requires to be thus placed in command; and such officers may, if upon the recommendation    
of the President of the United States they shall receive a vote of thanks of Congress for their    
services and gallantry in action against an enemy, be restored to the active list and not    
otherwise."</p>    
<p>In conformity with this law, Captain David G. Farragut was nominated to the Senate for    
continuance as the flag-officer in command of the squadron which recently rendered such important    
service to the Union, by his successful operations on the lower Mississippi and capture of New    
Orleans.</p>    
<p>Believing that no occasion could arise which would more fully correspond with the intention of    
the law, or be more pregnant with happy influence as an example, I cordially recommend that    
Captain D. G. Farragut receive a vote of thanks of Congress for his services and gallantry    
displayed in the capture, since the 21st December, 1861, of Forts Jackson and St. Philip, city of    
New Orleans, and the destruction of various rebel gunboats, rams, &amp; c.</p>

McClellan herewith he thought made this addition unnecessary. Respy. MCM.</p>    
<p>"To the Secretary of War"</p>    
<p>The order prepared by Meigs "on consultation of the President, Generals Totten, Meigs and    
Ripley, and Colonel [Joseph P.?] Taylor"and issued to McDowell on May 17, by Secretary Stanton    
is as follows:</p>    
<p>"General: Upon being joined by General Shields' division, you will move upon Richmond by the    
general route of the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, cooperating with forces under General    
McClellan now threatening Richmond from the line of the Pamunkey and York Rivers.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="220"/>    
"While seeking to establish as soon as possible a communication between your left wing and the    
right wing of General McClellan, you will hold yourself always in such position as to cover the    
capital of the nation against a sudden dash of any large body of the rebel forces.</p>    
<p>"General McClellan will be furnished with a copy of these instructions, and will be directed    
to hold himself in readiness to establish communication with your left wing and to prevent the    
main body of the enemy's army from leaving Richmond and throwing itself upon your column before a    
junction of the two armies is effected.</p>    
<p>"A copy of his instructions in regard to the employment of your force is annexed."(OR, I,    
XI, I, 28).</p>    
<p>The order which Stanton issued to McClellan, as indicated by Meigs' note accompanying    
Lincoln's autograph addition to the instructions to McDowell, was prepared at the same    
consolation, but may have been issued a day later. In the <hi rend="italic">Official Records</hi> it is dated    
as follows:</p>    
<p>"Washington, May 18 [17]---2 P.M.</p>    
<p>"General: Your dispatch to the President asking re-enforcements has been received and    
carefully considered.</p>    
<p>"The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely, and it is believed that even    
if this were prudent, it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that    
of the Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march. In order,    
therefore, to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment General    
McDowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route. He is ordered---keeping    
himself always in position to save the capital from all possible attack---so to operate as to put    
his left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are instructed to co-operate, so as    
to establish this communication as soon as possible, by extending your right wing to the north of    
Richmond. It is believed that this communication can be safely established either north or south    
of the Pamunkey River. In any event you will be able to prevent the main body of the enemy's    
forces from leaving Richmond and falling in overwhelming force upon General McDowell. He will    
move with between 35,000 and 40,000 men.</p>    
<p>"A copy of the instructions to General McDowell are with this. The specific task assigned to    
his command has been to provide against any danger to the capital of the nation.</p>    
<p>"At your earnest call for re-enforcements he is sent forward to co-operated in the reduction    
of Richmond, but charged, in attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington; and you will    
give no order, either before or after your junction, which can put him out of position to cover    
this city. You and he will communicate with each other by telegraph or otherwise as frequently as    
may be necessary for efficient co-operation. When General McDowell is in position on your right    
his supplies must be drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff officers to be    
prepared to supply him by that route.</p>    
<p>"The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the    
Rappahannock and of the forces with which he moves forward."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p. 27).</p></note>

<p>Whereas there appears in the public prints, what purports to be a proclamation, of Major    
General Hunter, in the words and figures following, towit:<ref target="n5-222-2">2</ref>    
</p>    
<p><hi rend="italic">Headquarters Department of the South</hi>,}</p>

<p>General Orders No. 11.---The three States of Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, comprising    
the military department of the south, having deliberately declared themselves no longer under the    
protection of the United States of America, and having taken up arms against the said United    
States, it becomes a military necessity to declare them under martial law. This was accordingly    
done on the 25th day of April, 1862. Slavery and martial law in a free country are altogether    
incompatible; the persons in these three States---Georgia, Florida and South Carolina---    
heretofore held as slaves, are therefore declared forever free. DAVID HUNTER,</p>    
<p>(Official) Major General Commanding.</p>    
<p>ED. W. SMITH, Acting Assistant Adjutant General.</p>    
<p>And whereas the same is producing some excitement, and misunderstanding: therefore</p>    
<p>I, Abraham Lincoln, president of the United States, proclaim and declare, that the government    
of the United States, had no knowledge, information, or belief, of an intention on the part of    
General Hunter to issue such a proclamation; nor has it yet, any authentic information that the    
document is genuine. And further, that neither General Hunter, nor any other commander, or    
person, has been<ref target="n5-222-3">3</ref>    
 authorized by the Government of the United States,    
to make proclamations declaring the slaves of any State free; and that the supposed proclamation,    
now in question, whether genuine or false, is altogether void, so far as respects such    
declaration.</p>    
<p>I further make known that whether it be competent for me, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army    
and Navy, to declare the Slaves of any state or states, free, and whether at any time, in any    
case, it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the maintainance of the government, to    
exercise such supposed power, are questions which, under my responsibility, I reserve to myself,    
and which I can not feel justified in leaving to the decision of<ref target="n5-222-4">4</ref>    
    
commanders in    
<pb n="223"/>    
    
the field. These are totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies and    
camps.</p>    
<p>On the sixth day of March last, by a special message, I recommended to Congress the adoption    
of a joint resolution to be substantially as follows:<ref target="n5-223-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p><hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That the United States ought to co-operate with any State which may adopt a    
gradual abolishment of slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in    
its discretion to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private, produced by such change    
of system.</p>    
<p>The resolution, in the language above quoted, was adopted by large majorities in both branches    
of Congress, and now stands an authentic, definite, and solemn proposal of the nation to the    
States and people most immediately interested in the subject matter. To the people of those    
states I now earnestly appeal. I do not argue. I beseech you to make the arguments for    
yourselves. You<ref target="n5-223-2">2</ref>    
 can not if you would, be blind to the signs of the    
times. I beg of you a calm and enlarged consideration of them, ranging, if it may be, far above    
personal and partizan politics. This proposal makes common cause for a common object, casting no    
reproaches upon any. It acts<ref target="n5-223-3">3</ref>    
 not the pharisee. The change it    
contemplates would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you    
not embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the    
providence of God, it is now your high previlege to do. May the vast future not have to lament    
that you have neglected it.<ref target="n5-223-4">4</ref>

and scolding in a style more ridiculous than imposing. We do not think Stanton will go. Much as    
he may admire Hunter's proclamation, he will not risk his office by opposing the President's    
wishes. . . ."Bennett replied to Lincoln's letter on June 6, 1862, that he had availed himself

confusion about the date of this telegram. Nicolay and Hay printed it under date of May 22 (VII,    
174-75). The received copy in the McClellan papers is dated May 24. Lincoln's autograph is    
clearly May 21, and the received copy of McClellan's "long despatch of yesterday"in the    
Lincoln Papers supports the correctness of Lincoln's date by being dated May 21, 1862, received 5    
A.M. McClellan's ten-page telegram reads in part as follows: "Your despatch of yesterday    
respecting our situation &amp; the batteries at Fort Darling was recd while I was absent with the    
advance where I have also been all this day. I have communicated. . . with Goldsborough. . . The    
vessels can do nothing without cooperation on land which I will not be in position to afford for    
several days. Circumstances must determine the propriety of a land attack. . . . roads incredibly    
bad. . . . Keyes corps is on the new Kent road. . . . He [i]ntzelman is on the same road. . . .    
Sumner is on the road connecting right with left. Stoneman with advanced guard is within one mile    
of New Bridge. Franklin. . . two miles this side of Stonemans. Porters division. . . is within    
supporting distance. . . . The enemy are in force on every road leading to Richmond . . . . their    
numbers. . . greatly exceeding our own. . . . I shall advance steadily &amp; carefully to attack.    
. . . I regret the state of things as to Genl McDowells command. . . . I would still most    
respectfully suggest the policy of our concentrating here by movements of water. . . . I regret    
also the configuration of the department of the Rappahannock it includes a portion even of the    
city of Richmond. I think that my own department should embrace the entire field of active    
military operations designed for the capture. . . of that city. Again I agree with your    
Excellency that one bad Genl is better than two good ones. I am not sure that I fully    
<pb n="227"/>    
</p><p>comprehend your orders of the 17th inst addressed to myself &amp; Genl McDowell. If a    
junction is effected before we occupy Richmond it must necessarily be east of the RR to    
Fredericksburg &amp; within my department. . . . my superior rank &amp; the. . . sixty second    
(62d) article of war will place his command under my orders unless it is otherwise specially    
directed by your Excellency &amp; I consider that he will be under my command except that I am    
not to detach any portion of his forces or give any orders which can put him out of position to    
cover Washington. . . . I believe that there is a great struggle before this army but I am    
neither dismayed nor discouraged. . . . I trust that the result may either obtain for me the    
permanent confidence of my government or that it may close my career."</p></note>

Monday morning the (26th.) twenty sixth. We have so thinned our line to get troops for other    
places that it was broken yesterday at Front-Royal with a probable loss to us of a Regiment    
infantry, two companies of cavalry, putting Banks in some peril. The enemies forces under Gen.    
Anderson<ref target="n5-232-1">1</ref>    
 now opposing Gen. McDowell's advance have, as their line of    
supply and retreat, the Road to Richmond. If in conjunction with McDowell's movement against    
Anderson you could send a force from your right to cut off the enemies supplies from Richmond,    
preserve the Rail Road bridges across the two forks of the Pamunkey and intercept the enemies    
retreat you will prevent the army now opposed to you from receiving an accession of numbers of    
nearly fifteen thousand men---and if you succeed in saving the bridges you will [se]cure a line    
of Rail Road for supplies in addition to the one you now have. Can you not do this almost as well    
as not, while you are building the Chicahomany bridges? McDowell and Shields both say they can,

<p>Gen Fremont has been ordered by Telegraph to move from Franklin on Harrisonburg to relieve Gen    
Banks and capture or destroy Jackson &amp; Ewell's force.</p>    
<p>You are instructed laying aside for the present the movement    
<pb n="233"/>    
    
on Richmond to put twenty thousand men (20000) in motion at once for the Shenandoah moving on the    
line or in advance of the line of the Manassas Gap R Road. Your object will be to capture the    
forces of Jackson &amp; Ewell, either in cooperation with Gen Fremont or in case want of supplies    
or of transportation interferes with his movement, it is believed that the force with which you    
move will be sufficient to accomplish the object alone.</p>    
<p>The information thus far received here makes it probable that if the enemy operates actively    
against Gen Banks you will not be able to count upon much assistance from him but may even have    
to release him.</p>    
<p>Reports received this moment are that Banks is fighting with Ewell (8) Eight miles from    
Winchester.</p>

telegraphed McDowell, "In view of the operations of the enemy on the line of General Banks the    
President thinks the whole force you designed to move from Fredericksburg should not be taken    
away, and he therefore directs that one brigade in addition to what you designed to leave at    
Fredericksburg should be left there; this brigade to be the least effective of your command."    
(OR, I, XII, III, 219). McDowell replied: "Your order to leave an additional brigade at    
Fredericksburg has been received. Shield's ammunition has been landed and will be up this    
afternoon or evening. The enemy, attracted by the movement of our troops yesterday, drew in his

<p>Your despatch received. Banks was at Strausburg with about six-thousand men, Shields having    
been taken from him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at Richmond, and the rest of his    
force scattered at various places. On the 23rd. a rebel force of seven to ten thousand fell upon    
one regiment and two companies guarding the bridge at Front-Royal, destroying it entirely,    
crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th. (yesterday) pushed to get North of Banks on the Road to    
Winchester. Banks ran a race with them, beating them into Winchester yesterday evening. This    
morning a battle ensued between the two forces in which Banks was beaten back into full retreat    
towards Martinsburg, and probably is broken up into a total route. Geary, on the Manassas Gap    
R.R. just now reports that Jackson is now near Front-Royal with ten thousand following up &amp;    
supporting as I understand, the force now pursuing Banks. Also that another force of ten thousand    
is near Orleans following on in the same direction. Stripped bare, as we are here, it will be all    
we can do to prevent them crossing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, or above. We have about twenty    
thousand of McDowell's force moving back to the vicinity of Front Royal; and Gen. Fremont, who    
was at Franklin, is moving to Harrisonburg, both these movements intended to get in the enemies    
near. One more of McDowells Brigades is ordered through here to Harper's Ferry. The rest of his    
force remains, for the present, at Fredericksburg.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="237"/>    
We are sending such regiments and dribs from here and Baltimore, as we can spare, to Harper's    
Ferry, supplying their places, in some sort, by calling in Militia from the adjacent States. We    
also have eighteen cannon on the road to Harper's Ferry of which arm, there is not a single one    
yet at that point. This is now our situation. If McDowell's force was now beyond our reach, we    
should be utterly helpless. Apprehension of something like this, and no unwillingness to sustain    
you, has always been my reason for withholding McDowells force from you. Please understand this,    
and do the best you can with the force you have.</p>

<p>To the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>    
<p>The insurrection which is yet existing in the United States, and aims at the overthrow of the    
federal Constitution and the Union,    
<pb n="241"/>    
    
was clandestinely prepared during the winter of 1860 and 1861, and assumed an open organization    
in the form of a treasonable provisional government at Montgomery, in Alabama, on the 18th day of    
February, 1861. On the 12th day of April, 1861, the insurgents committed the flagrant act of    
civil war by the bombardment and capture of Fort Sumter, which cut off the hope of immediate    
conciliation. Immediately afterwards all the roads and avenues to this city were obstructed, and    
the capital was put into the condition of a siege. The mails in every direction were stopped, and    
the lines of telegraph cut off by the insurgents, and military and naval forces, which had been    
called out by the government for the defence of Washington, were prevented from reaching the city    
by organized and combined treasonable resistance in the State of Maryland. There was no adequate    
and effective organization for the public defence. Congress had indefinitely adjourned. There was    
no time to convene them. It became necessary for me to choose whether, using only the existing    
means, agencies, and processes which Congress had provided, I should let the government fall at    
once into ruin, or whether, availing myself of the broader powers conferred by the Constitution    
in cases of insurrection, I would make an effort to save it with all its blessings for the    
present age and for posterity.</p>    
<p>I thereupon summoned my constitutional advisers, the heads of all the departments, to meet on    
Sunday, the 20th [21st] day of April, 1861, at the office of the Navy Department, and then and    
there, with their unanimous concurrence, I directed that an armed revenue cutter should proceed    
to sea, to afford protection to the commercial marine, and especially the California treasure    
ships then on their way to this coast. I also directed the commandant of the navy yard at Boston    
to purchase or charter, and arm as quickly as possible, five steamships, for purposes of public    
defence. I directed the commandant of the navy yard at Philadelphia to purchase, or charter and    
arm, an equal number for the same purpose. I directed the commandant at New York to purchase, or    
charter and arm, an equal number. I directed Commander Gillis<ref target="n5-241-1">1</ref>    
 to    
purchase, or charter and arm, and put to sea two other vessels. Similar directions were given to    
Commodore DuPont,<ref target="n5-241-2">2</ref>    
 with a view to the opening of passages by water to    
and from the capital. I directed the several officers to take the advice and obtain the aid and    
efficient services in the matter of his excellency Edwin D. Morgan, the governor of New York, or,    
in his absence, George D. Morgan, William M. Evarts, R. M. Blatchford, and Moses H. Grinnell, who    
<pb n="242"/>    
    
were, by my directions, especially empowered by the Secretary of the Navy to act for his    
department in that crisis, in matters pertaining to the forwarding of troops and supplies for the    
public defence.</p>    
<p>On the same occasion I directed that Governor Morgan and Alexander Cummings, of the city of    
New York, should be authorized by the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron, to make all necessary    
arrangements for the transportation of troops and munitions of war, in aid and assistance of the    
officers of the army of the United States, until communication by mails and telegraph should be    
completely re-established between the cities of Washington and New York. No security was required    
to be given by them, and either of them was authorized to act in case of inability to consult    
with the other.</p>    
<p>On the same occasion I authorized and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to advance,    
without requiring security, two millions of dollars of public money to John A. Dix, George    
Opdyke, and Richard M. Blatchford, of New York, to be used by them in meeting such requisitions    
as should be directly consequent upon the military and naval measures necessary for the defence    
and support of the government, requiring them only to act without compensation, and to report    
their transactions when duly called upon.</p>    
<p>The several departments of the government at that time contained so large a number of disloyal    
persons that it would have been impossible to provide safely, through official agents only, for    
the performance of the duties thus confided to citizens favorably known for their ability,    
loyalty, and patriotism.</p>    
<p>The several orders issued upon these occurrences were transmitted by private messengers, who    
pursued a circuitous way to the seaboard cities, inland, across the States of Pennsylvania and    
Ohio and the northern lakes. I believe that by these and other similar measures taken in that    
crisis, some of which were without any authority of law, the government was saved from overthrow.    
I am not aware that a dollar of the public funds thus confided without authority of law to    
unofficial persons was either lost or wasted, although apprehensions of such misdirection    
occurred to me as objections to those extraordinary proceedings, and were necessarily    
overruled.</p>    
<p>I recall these transactions now because my attention has been directed to a resolution which    
was passed by the House of Representatives on the 30th day of last month, which is in these    
words:</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">Resolved</hi>, That Simon Cameron, late Secretary of War, by investing</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="243"/>    
Alexander Cummings with the control of large sums of the public money, and authority to purchase    
military supplies without restriction, without requiring from him any guarantee for the faithful    
performance of his duties, when the services of competent public officers were available, and by    
involving the government in a vast number of contracts with persons not legitimately engaged in    
the business pertaining to the subject-matter of such contracts, especially in the purchase of    
arms for future delivery, has adopted a policy highly injurious to the public service, and    
deserves the censure of the House."</p>    
<p>Congress will see that I should be wanting equally in candor and in justice if I should leave    
the censure expressed in this resolution to rest exclusively or chiefly upon Mr. Cameron. The    
same sentiment is unanimously entertained by the heads of departments, who participated in the    
proceedings which the House of Representatives has censured. It is due to Mr. Cameron to say    
that, although he fully approved the proceedings, they were not moved nor suggested by himself,    
and that not only the President but all the other heads of departments were at least equally    
responsible with him for whatever error, wrong, or fault was committed in the premises. ABRAHAM

Fitz-John Porter's action of the previous day. McClellan's report dated May 28, 2 P.M., is as    
follows: "Porter's action of yesterday was truly a glorious victory. Too much credit cannot be    
given to his magnificent division and its accomplished leader. The route of rebels was complete--    
-not a defeat, but a complete rout. Prisoners are constantly coming in; two companies have this

available. I am confident that Washington is in no danger. Engines and cars in large numbers have    
been sent up to bring down Jackson's command. I may not be able to cut them off, but will try. We    
have cut all but the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad. The real issue is in the battle about    
to be fought in front of Richmond. All our available troops should be collected here---not raw    
regiments, but the well-drilled troops. It cannot be ignored that a desperate battle is before    
us. If any regiments of good troops remain unemployed it will be an irreparable fault    
committed."(OR, I, XI, I, 35).</p>

directing operations in front I have the honor to state. . . that the troops under Gen F J Porter    
marched more than twenty (20) miles yesterday through rain and mud fought six hours and were at    
the close of the action encumbered with some six hundred (600) killed and wounded including those

<p>Your despatch of to-day received, and is satisfactory. Fremont has nominally twenty-two    
thousand, really about seventeen thousand. Blencker's Division is part of it. I have a despatch    
from Fremont this morning, not telling me where he is, but he says "Scouts and men from    
Winchester represent Jacksons force variously at thirty to sixty thousand. With him Gen. Ewell    
and Longstreet."The high figures erroneous of course. Do you not know where Longstreet is?</p>

<p>I transmit to the Senate, for its consideration with a view to ratification, a Treaty of    
Amity, Commerce, Consular privileges and Extradition between the United States and the Republic    
of Salvador, signed in this City on the 29th. instant. It is believed that, though this    
instrument contains no stipulation which may not be found in some subsisting Treaty between the    
United States and Foreign Powers, it will prove to be mutually advantageous. Several of the    
Republics of this hemisphere, among which is Salvador, are alarmed at a supposed sentiment    
tending to reactionary movements against Republican institutions on this continent. It seems    
therefore to be proper that we should show to any of them who may apply for that purpose, that,    
compatibly with our cardinal policy and with an enlightened view of our own interests, we are    
willing to encourage them by strengthening our ties of good will and good neighborhood with them.

<p>A circle whose circumference shall pass through Harper's Ferry, Front-Royal, and Strasburg,    
and whose center shall be a little North East of Winchester, almost certainly has within it this    
morning, the forces of Jackson, Ewell, and Edward Johnson. Quite certainly they were within it    
two days ago. Some part of these forces attacked Harper's Ferry at dark last evening, and are    
still in sight this morning. Shields---with McDowell's advance. re-took Front Royal at 11 A.M.    
yesterday, with a dozen of our own prisoners taken there a week ago, one hundred and fifty of the    
enemy, two locomotives and eleven cars, some other property and stores, and saved the bridge.    
Fremont, from the direction of Moorefield, promises to be at or near Strasburg at 5 P.M. to-day.    
Banks, at Williamsport, with his old force, and his new force at Harpers Ferry, is directed to    
co-operate. Shields, at Front-Royal, reports a rumor of still an additional force of the enemy,    
supposed to be Anderson's, having entered the valley of Virginia. This last may or may not be    
true. Corinth is certainly in the hands of Gen. Halleck. A. LINCOLN</p>

My dear Sir June 5. 1862</opener>    
<p>Herewith I return you the papers in relation to the proposed reappointment of William Kellogg,    
Jr. to a Cadetship. Upon Gen. Totten's statement of the case I think it is natural that he should    
feel as he expresses himself. And yet the case comes upon me in the very strongest way to be    
painful to me. Hon. William Kellogg, the father, is not only a member of Congress from my state,    
but he is my personal friend of more than twenty years' standing, and of whom I had many personal    
kindnesses. This matter touches him very deeply---the feelings of a father for a child---as he    
thinks, all the future of his child. I can not be the instrument to crush his heart. According to    
strict rule he has the right to make the re-nomination. Let the appointment be made. It needs not    
to become a precedent. Hereafter let no resignation be accepted under demerit amounting to cause    
for dismissal, unless upon express stipulation in writing that the cadet resigning shall not be    
re-nominated. In this I mean no censure upon Gen. Totten; and although I have marked this note    
"<hi rend="italic">private</hi>"I am quite willing for him to see it. Yours truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

<p>We can not afford to keep your force, and Banks', and McDowell's, engaged in keeping Jackson    
South of Strasburg and Front-Royal. You fought Jackson alone, and worsted him. He can have no    
substantial reinforcement, so long as a battle is pending at Richmond. Surely you and Banks in    
supporting distance are capable of keeping him from returning to Winchester. But if Sigel be sent    
forward to you, and McDowell (as he must) be put to other work, Jackson will break through at    
Front Royal again. He is already on the right side of the Shenandoah to do it, and on the wrong    
side of it to attack you. The orders already sent you and Banks place you and him in the proper    
positions for the work assigned you. Jackson can not move his whole force on either of you,    
before the other can learn of it, and go to his assistance. He can not divide his force, sending    
part against each of you because he will be too weak for either. Please do as I directed in the    
order of the 8th. and my despatch of yesterday, the 12th. and neither you nor Banks will be    
overwhelmed by Jackson. By proper scouts-look-outs, and beacons of smokes by day, and fires by    
night, you can always have timely notice of the enemies approach. I know not as to you, but by

<opener>War Department,<lb/>

Major-General Fremont: June 15, 1862.</opener>    
<p>My Dear Sir: Your letter of the 12th, by Colonel Zagonyi, is just received. In answer to the    
principal part of it I repeat the    
<pb n="271"/>    
    
substance of an order of the 8th and one or two telegraphic despatches sent you since.</p>    
<p>We have no indefinite power of sending re-enforcements; so that we are compelled rather to    
consider the proper disposal of the forces we have than of those we could wish to have. We may be    
able to send you some dribs by degrees, but I do not believe we can do more. As you alone beat    
Jackson last Sunday I argue that you are stronger than he is to-day, unless he has been re-    
enforced; and that he cannot have been materially re-enforced, because such re-enforcement could    
only have come from Richmond, and he is much more likely to go to Richmond than Richmond is to    
come to him. Neither is very likely. I think Jackson's game---his assigned work---now is to    
magnify the accounts of his numbers and reports of his movements, and thus by constant alarms    
keep three or four times as many of our troops away from Richmond as his own force amounts to.    
Thus he helps his friends at Richmond three or four times as much as if he were there. Our game    
is not to allow this. Accordingly, by the order of the 8th, I directed you to halt at    
Harrisonburg, rest your force, and get it well in hand, the objects being to guard against    
Jackson's returning by the same route to the Upper Potomac, over which you have just driven him    
out, and at the same time give some protection against a raid into West Virginia. Already I have    
given you discretion to occupy Mount Jackson instead, if, on full consideration, you think best.    
I do not believe Jackson will attack you, but certainly he cannot attack you by surprise; and if    
he comes upon you in superior force you have but to notify us, fall back cautiously, and Banks    
will join you in due time. But while we know not whether Jackson will move at all, or by what    
route, we cannot safely put you and Banks both on the Strasburg line, and leave no force on the    
Front Royal line, the very line upon which he prosecuted his late raid. The true policy is to    
place one of you on one line and the other on the other, in such positions that you can unite on    
either once you actually find Jackson moving upon it. And this is precisely what we are doing.    
This protects that part of our frontier, so to speak, and liberates McDowell to go to the    
assistance of McClellan. I have arranged this, and am very unwilling to have it deranged. While    
you have only asked for Sigel I have spoken only of Banks, and this because Sigel's force is now    
the principal part of Banks's force.</p>    
<p>About transferring General Schenck's command, the purchase of supplies, and the promotion and    
appointment of officers<ref target="n5-271-1">1</ref>    
 mentioned in your letter, I will consult with

delivered by his aide-de-camp Colonel Charles Zagonyi, read as follows: "The situation here    
gives me some anxiety and I wish therefore to trouble you with a few lines. We have been    
operating against the enemy with a force greatly inferior to his. He has been still farther re-    
enforced and my men have been exhausted by the demand made upon them. . . . I have asked you by    
telegraph which I send forward this afternoon to direct General Sigel with his force immediately    
to report to me here. . . . In the battle at Cross Keys I do not think I had 10,000 men, the    
enemy according to all acounts. . . not less than 20,000. . . . I ought to have a moveable corps    
of not less than 30000 men. . . . I should also have the power. . . to order the proper officer    
to procure immediately and as they are required such supplies as are necessary. . . . I hope that    
you will find it agreeable to your views to give me what I ask &amp; that you will be good enough    
to give me a reply as soon as you have considered the subject. . . . I have to ask that you will    
have the appointment of Col. Anselm Albert as Brig. Genl. confirmed as well as that of Brig Genl.    
Stahel. . . . I still continue to desire. . . that you will permit me to raise a cavalry regiment    
to be commanded by Col. Zagonyi whom I send to you with this letter. . . . The Secretary of War    
informed me that if there should be officers in this command with whom it was not agreeable to me    
to act they could be transferred. . . . I avail myself of this assurance to ask that Brig.    
General Schenck be transferred from my Dept. And it is just to him to say that this request is

Major General McClellan June 15, 1862</opener>    
<p>My dear Sir: The night between your two late battles of Saturday and Sunday, I went earnestly    
to work to find a way of putting Gen. Wool's force under your control without wounding any one's    
feelings.<ref target="n5-272-2">2</ref>    
 But after all, Gen. Dix was a little hurt at being taken    
from an independent command and put in a dependent one.<ref target="n5-272-3">3</ref>    
 I could not    
help this without giving up the principal object of the move. So soon as you can, (which I do not    
expect is yet,) I wish you to give me the benefit of your suggestions as to how an independent    
command can be given him without detriment.</p>    
<p>The Secretary of War has turned over to me your despatch about sending McDowell to you by    
water, instead of by land.<ref target="n5-272-4">4</ref>    
 I now fear he can not get to you either    
way in time. Shields' Division has got so terribly out of shape, out at elbows, and out at toes,    
that it will require a long time to get it in again. I expect to see McDowell within a day or    
two, when I will again talk with him about the mode of moving.</p>    
<p>McCall's Division has nearly or quite reached you by now. This,    
<pb n="273"/>    
    
with what you get from Gen. Wool's old command, and the new regiments sent you, must give you an    
increase since the late battles of over twenty thousand. Doubtless the battles and other causes    
have decreased you half as much in the same time; but then the enemy have lost as many in the    
same way.</p>    
<p>I believe I would come and see you, were it not that I fear my presence might divert you and    
the army from more important matters. Yours truly A. LINCOLN</p>

Major General Fremont Washington City, D.C.<lb/>    
Mount Jackson, Va. June 16, 1862</opener>    
<p>Your despatch of yesterday reminding me of a supposed understanding that I would furnish you a    
corps of thirty five thousand men, and asking of me "the fulfillment of this understanding"is    
received. I am ready to come to a fair settlement of accounts with you on the fulfillment of    
understandings.</p>    
<p>Early in March last, when I assigned you to the command of the Mountain Department, I did tell    
you I would give you all the force I could, and that I hoped to make it reach thirty five    
thousand. You, at the same time told me that, within a reasonable time, you would seize the    
Railroad at, or East of, Knoxville, Tenn. if you could. There was then in the Department a force    
supposed to be twentyfive thousand---the exact number as well known to you as to me. After    
looking about two or three days you called and distinctly told me that if I would add the Blecker    
[Blenker] Division to the force already in the Department, you would undertake the job. The    
Blecker [Blenker] division contained ten thousand; and at the expense of great dissatisfaction to    
Gen. McClellan, I took it from his army, and gave it to you. My promise was litterally fulfilled.    
I had given you all I could, and I had given you very nearly if not quite thirtyfive    
thousand.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="274"/>    
Now for yours. On the 23rd. of May, largely over two months afterwards, you were at Franklin Va,    
not within three hundred miles of Knoxville, nor within eighty miles of any part of the Railroad    
East of it---and not moving forward, but telegraphing here that you could not move for lack of    
everything. Now, do not misunderstand me. I do not say you have not done all you could. I presume    
you met unexpected difficulties; and I beg you to believe that as surely as you have done your    
best, so have I. I have not the power now to fill up your corps to thirtyfive thousand. I am not    
demanding of you to do the work of thirtyfive thousand. I am only asking of you to stand    
cautiously on the defensive, get your force in order, and give such protection as you can to the    
valley of the Shenandoah, and to Western Virginia. Have you received the orders? and will you act    
upon them?<ref target="n5-274-1">1</ref>

<p>Your long letter is received. The information you give is valuable. You say it is fortunate    
that Fremont did not intercept Jackson---that Jackson had the superior force, and would have    
over-whelmed him. If this is so, how happened it that Fremont fairly fought and worsted him on    
the 8th.? Or, is the account that he did fight and worst him, false, and fabricated?</p>    
<p>Both Gen. Fremont and you speak of Jackson having beaten Shields. By our accounts, he did not    
beat Shields. He had no engagement with Shields. He did meet, and drive back with disaster, about    
two thousand of Shields' advance, till they were met by an additional Brigade of Shields, when    
Jackson himself turned and retreated. Shields himself, and more than half his force, were not

absolutely impossible to carry out the order. The army was in a starving condition and literally    
unable to fight. . . . it is undoubtedly a very fortunate circumstance that Gen. Fremont did not    
succeed in placing himself across Jacksons line of retreat; for Jacksons force was so much    
superior (all the Generals. . . put at 25,000 as the very lowest) that he would in all

<p>Yours of last night just received, and for which I thank you. If large re-inforcements are    
going from Richmond to Jackson, it proves one of two things, either that they are very strong at    
Richmond, or do not mean to defend the place desperately.</p>    
<p>On reflection, I do not see how re-inforcements from Richmond to Jackson could be in

<p>The President said that, as he had not been furnished with a copy of the memorial in advance,    
he could not be expected to make any extended remarks. It was a relief to be assured that the    
deputation were not applicants for office, for his chief trouble was from that class of persons.    
The next most troublesome subject was Slavery. He agreed with the memorialists, that Slavery was    
wrong, but in regard to the ways and means of its removal, his views probably differed from    
theirs. The quotation in the memorial, from his Springfield speech, was incomplete. It should    
have embraced another sentence, in which he indicated his views as to the effect upon Slavery    
itself of the resistance to its extension.</p>    
<p>The sentiments contained in that passage were deliberately uttered, and he held them now. If a    
decree of emancipation could abolish Slavery, John Brown would have done the work effectually.    
Such a decree surely could not be more binding upon the South than the Constitution, and that    
cannot be enforced in that part of the country now. Would a proclamation of freedom be any more    
effective?</p>    
<p>Mr. Johnson replied as follows:</p>    
<p>"True, Mr. President, the Constitution cannot now be enforced at the South, but you do not on    
that account intermit the effort to enforce it, and the memorialists are solemnly convinced that    
the abolition of Slavery is indispensable to your success."</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="279"/>    
The President further said that he felt the magnitude of the task before him, and hoped to be    
rightly directed in the very trying circumstances by which he was surrounded.</p>    
<p>Wm. Barnard addressed the President in a few words, expressing sympathy for him in all his    
embarrassments, and an earnest desire that he might, under divine guidance, be led to free the    
slaves and thus save the nation from destruction. In that case, nations yet unborn would rise up    
to call him blessed and, better still, he would secure the blessing of God.</p>    
<p>The President responded very impressively, saying that he was deeply sensible of his need of    
Divine assistance. He had sometime thought that perhaps he might be an instrument in God's hands    
of accomplishing a great work and he certainly was not unwilling to be. Perhaps, however, God's    
way of accomplishing the end which the memorialists have in view may be different from theirs. It    
would be his earnest endeavor, with a firm reliance upon the Divine arm, and seeking light from    
above, to do his duty in the place to which he had been called.</p>

<opener>To the Senate of the United States. June 23, 1862</opener>    
<p>On the 7th. day of December, 1861, I submitted to the Senate the project of a Treaty between    
the United States and Mexico, which had been proposed to me by Mr Corwin, our Minister to Mexico,    
and respectfully requested the advice of the Senate there-upon.</p>    
<p>On the 25th. day of February, last, a resolution was adopted by the Senate to the effect,    
"That it is not advisable to negotiate a Treaty that will require the United States to assume    
any portion of the principal or interest of the debt of Mexico, or that will require the    
concurrence of European Powers."</p>    
<p>This resolution having been duly communicated to me, notice thereof was immediately given by    
the Secretary of State to Mr. Corwin, and he was informed that he was to consider his    
instructions, upon the subject referred to, modified by this resolution, and would gove[r]n his    
course accordingly. That despatch failed to reach Mr Corwin, by reason of the disturbed condition    
of Mexico, until a very recent date, Mr Corwin being without instructions or thus practically    
left without instructions to negotiate further with Mexico.</p>    
<p>In view of the very important events occurring there, he has thought that the interests of the    
United States would be promoted by the conclusion of two treaties which should provide for a loan    
to that Republic. He has therefore signed such treaties, and they having been duly ratified by    
the Government of Mexico, he has transmitted them to me for my consideration. The action of the    
Senate of course is conclusive against an acceptance of the treaties on my part. I have    
nevertheless thought it just to our excellent Minister in Mexico, and respectful to the    
Government of that Republic, to lay the treaties before the Senate,---together with the    
correspondence which has occurred in relation to them. In performing this duty, I have only to    
add that the importance of the subject thus submitted to the Senate cannot be over estimated, and    
I shall cheerfully receive and consider with the highest respect any further advice the Senate    
may think proper to give upon the subject. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<opener>To the Senate of the United States: June 23, 1862</opener>    
<p>The bill which has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, entitled "An act to    
repeal that part of an act of Congress which prohibits the circulation of bank notes of a less    
denomination than five dollars in the District of Columbia,"<ref target="n5-282-2">2</ref>    
has received my attentive consideration; and I now return it to the Senate, in    
which it originated, with the following objections:</p>    
<p>1. The bill proposes to repeal the existing legislation, prohibiting the circulation of bank    
notes of a less denomination than five dollars within the District of Columbia, without    
permitting the issuing of such bills by banks not now legally authorized to issue them. In my    
judgment, it will be found impracticable, in the present condition of the currency, to make such    
a discrimination. The banks have generally suspended specie payments; and a legal sanction given    
to the circulation of the irredeemable notes of one class of them will almost certainly be so    
extended, in practical operation, as to include those of all classes, whether authorized or    
unauthorized. If this view be correct, the currency of the District, should this act become a    
law, will certainly and greatly deteriorate, to the serious injury of honest trade and honest    
labor.</p>    
<p>2. This bill seems to contemplate no end which cannot be otherwise more certainly and    
beneficially attained. During the existing war it is peculiarly the duty of the national    
government to secure to the people a sound circulating medium. This duty has been, under existing    
circumstances, satisfactorily performed, in part at least, by authorizing the issue of United    
States notes, receivable for all government dues except customs, and made a legal tender for all    
debts, public and private, except interest on public debt. The object of the bill submitted to    
me, namely, that of providing a small note currency during the present suspension, can be fully    
accomplished by authorizing the issue, as part of any new emission of United States notes made    
necessary by the circumstances of the country, of notes of a similar character, but of less    
denomination than five dollars. Such an issue would answer all the beneficial purposes of the    
bill; would save a considerable amount to the treasury in interest; would greatly facilitate    
payments, to soldiers and other creditors, of small sums; and would furnish to the people a    
currency as safe as their own government.<ref target="n5-282-3">3</ref>    
    
<pb n="283"/>    
    
Entertaining these objections to the bill, I feel myself constrained to withhold from it my    
approval, and return it for the further consideration and action of Congress.</p>

<p>When birds and animals are looked at through a fog they are seen to disadvantage, and so it    
might be with you if I were to attempt to tell you why I went to see Gen. SCOTT. I can only say    
that my visit to West Point did not have the importance which has been attached to it; but it    
conceived [concerned] matters that you understand quite as well as if I were to tell you all    
about them. Now, I can only remark that it had nothing whatever to do with making or unmaking any    
General in the country. [Laughter and applause.] The Secretary of War, you know, holds a pretty    
tight rein on the Press, so that they shall not tell more than they ought to, and I'm afraid that    
if I blab too much he might draw a tight rein on me.</p>

<note id="n5-284-1"><p>1 New York <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, June 26, 1862.    
On Monday, June 23, Lincoln had left Washington on an unannounced trip to West Point for    
consultation with General Winfield Scott. Returning late at night, he was met at the Jersey City    
station by a small crowd who called for a speech. The substance of Lincoln's conference with    
Scott is indicated in Scott's memorandum in the Lincoln Papers:</p><p>"The President having    
stated to me, orally, the present numbers &amp; positions of our forces in front of the rebel    
armies, south &amp; South west of the Potomack, has done me honor to ask my views, in writing, as    
to the further dispositions now to be made, of the former, &amp; particularly of the army under    
McDowell, towards the suppression of the rebellion.</p>    
<p>"Premising that, altho' the statements of the President were quite full &amp; most distinct    
&amp; lucid---yet from my distance from the scenes of operation, &amp; not having, recently,    
followed them up, with closeness---many details are still wanted to give professional value to my    
suggestions---I shall, nevertheless, with great deference, proceed to offer such as most readily    
occur to me---each of which has been anticipated by the President.</p>    
<p>"I consider the numbers &amp; positions of Fremont &amp; Banks, adequate to the protection of    
Washington against any force the enemy can bring by the way of the Upper Potomack, &amp; the    
troops, at Manassas junction, with the garrisons of the forts on the Potomack &amp; of    
Washington, equally adequate to its protection on the South.</p>    
<p>"The force at Fredericksburg seems entirely out of position, &amp; it cannot be called up,    
directly &amp; in time, by McClellan, from the want of rail-road transportation, or an adequate    
supply train, moved by animals. If, however, there be a sufficient number of vessels, at hand,    
that force might reach the head of York river, by water, in time to aid in the operations against    
Richmond, or in the very improbable case of disaster, there, to serve as a valuable reinforcement    
to McClellan.</p>    
<p>"The defeat of the rebels, at Richmond, or their forced retreat, thence, combined with our    
previous victories, would be a virtual end of the rebellion, &amp; soon restore entire Virginia    
to the Union.</p>    
<p>"The remaining important points to be occupied, by us, are---Mobile, Charleston, Chattanooga.    
These must soon come into our hands.</p>    
<p>"McDowell's force, at Manassas, might be ordered to Richmond, by the Potomack &amp; York    
rivers, &amp; be replaced, at Manassas, by King's brigade, if there be adequate transports at, or    
near Alexandria. Most respectfully Submitted</p>    
<p>"WINFIELD SCOTT."</p></note>

Hon. John W. Crisfield. Washington, June 26. 1862.</opener>    
<p>My dear Sir: I have been considering the appeal made by yourself, and Senator Pearce in behalf    
of Judge Carmichael. His charge to the Grand-Jury, was left with me by the Senator, and, on    
reading it, I must confess I was not very favorably impressed towards the Judge. The object of    
the charge, I understand, was to procure prossecutions, and punishment of some men for arresting,    
or doing violence to some secessionists---that is, the Judge was trying to help a little, by    
giving the protection of law to those who were endevoring to overthrow the Supreme law---trying    
if he could find a safe place for certain men to stand on the constitution, whilst they should    
stab it in another place.</p>    
<p>But possibly I am mistaken.</p>    
<p>The Secretary of War and I have agreed that if the Judge will take the oath of allegiance,    
usually taken in such cases, he may be discharged. Please ascertain, and inform me whether he    
will do it. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<note id="n5-285-2"><p>2 ADfS, DLC-RTL. The circumstances of the    
arrest of Judge Richard B. Carmichael, whose release was requested by Representative Crisfield    
and Senator James A. Pearce of Maryland, are recounted in the report of General John A. Dix to    
Secretary Stanton, June 25, 1862, which reads in part as follows: "In October [October 3, 1861]    
last I was authorized by the Secretary of State to arrest Judge R. B. Carmichael of [Talbot    
County] the Eastern Shore of Maryland, if I should deem it expedient . . . and if necessary in    
his own Court. In the communication . . . was enclosed a printed memorial . . . to the    
Legislature of Maryland, signed by him and expressing the most disloyal sentiments. . . . I did    
not . . . deem it advisable to make the arrest at that time. Soon afterwards a Military arrest    
was made on the Eastern Shore . . . in a county in Judge Carmichael's    
<pb n="286"/>    
</p><p>District, by Officer of the Second Regiment of Delaware Volunteers. At the next term of    
the Court, the Judge charged the Grand jury that it was their duty to present all persons    
concerned in such arrest. . . . His charges in . . . other Counties as well as this, were of a    
most disloyal and offensive character. . . . Under the charge referred to the Hon. Henry H.    
Goldsborough, President of the Senate of Maryland and several officers of the 2nd. Delaware . . .    
I was informed that bills of indictment had been found against them. The trial of the Hon. Mr.    
Goldsborough was expected to take place in . . . May last, and four Officers of the Delaware    
Regiment were summoned as witnesses in his behalf. They came to me and expressed a great    
unwillingness to obey . . . as they had been presented by the Grand jury . . . and would be    
arrested if they made their appearance in the county. . . . I dispatched Mr. [Daniel H.] McPhail,    
Deputy Provost Marshal of the Baltimore Military Police with four police-men to Easton . . .    
where the Court was in session [May 23-27], to accompany the four officers . . . with    
instructions to arrest Judge Carmichael, if on consultation with . . . Mr. Goldsborough, it    
should be thought expedient. . . . It was, on full consideration, deemed expedient that the    
arrest should be made in Court in order that the proceeding might be the more marked. . . . When    
Mr. McPhail accompanied by two . . . policemen ascended the bench and respectfully announced to    
the Judge the order to take him into custody by the authority of the United States, he denied the    
authority of the Government and made a violent attack on one of the policemen. Mr. McPhail was    
thus compelled to use force to secure him, and he unluckily received a superficial wound on the    
head. . . ."(DLC-RTL). Judge Carmichael was released on Stanton's order, December 2,    
1862.</p></note>

<p>Major-General McClellan: Your three dispatches of yesterday in relation to the affair, ending    
with the statement that you completely succeeded in making your point, are very gratifying. The    
later one of 6:15 p.m., suggesting the probability of your being overwhelmed by 200,000, and    
talking of where the responsibility will belong, pains me very much. I give you all I can, and    
act on the presumption that you will do the best you can with what you have, while you continue,

that this was the decisive point, and that all the available means of the Government should be    
concentrated here. I will do all that a general can do with the splendid army I have the honor to    
command, and if it is destroyed by overwhelming numbers, can at least die with it and share its    
fate. But if the result of the action, which will probably occur to-morrow, or within a short    
time, is a disaster, the responsibility cannot be thrown on my shoulders; it must rest where it

general who feels in his heart the loss of every brave man who has been needlessly sacrificed to-    
day. I still hope to retrieve our fortunes, but to do this the Government must view the matter in    
the same earnest light that I do. You must send me very large re-enforcements, and send them at    
once. I shall draw back to this side of Chickahominy, and think I can withdraw all our material.    
Please understand that in this battle we have lost nothing but men, and those the best we    
have.</p>    
<p>"In addition to what I have already said, I only wish to say to the President that I think he    
is wrong in regarding me as ungenerous when I said that my force was too weak. I merely intimated    
a truth which to-day has been too plainly proved. If, at this instant, I could dispose of 10,000    
fresh men, I could gain a victory to-morrow. I know that a few thousand more men would have    
changed this battle from a defeat to a victory. As it is, the Government must not and cannot hold    
me responsible for the result.</p>    
<p>"I feel too earnestly to-night. I have seen too many dead and wounded comrades to feel    
otherwise than that the Government has not sustained this army. If you do not do so now the game    
is lost.</p>    
<p>"If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you or to any other    
persons in Washington.</p>

My dear Sir June 28. 1862.</opener>    
<p>My view of the present condition of the War is about as follows:</p>    
<p>The evacuation of Corinth, and our delay by the flood in the Chicahominy, has enabled the    
enemy to concentrate too much    
<pb n="292"/>    
    
force in Richmond for McClellan to successfully attack. In fact there soon will be no substantial    
rebel force any where else. But if we send all the force from here to McClellan, the enemy will,    
before we can know of it, send a force from Richmond and take Washington. Or, if a large part of    
the Western Army be brought here to McClellan, they will let us have Richmond, and retake    
Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri &amp;c. What should be done is to hold what we have in the West,    
open the Mississippi, and, take Chatanooga &amp; East Tennessee, without more---a reasonable    
force should, in every event, be kept about Washington for it's protection. Then let the country    
give us a hundred thousand new troops in the shortest possible time, which added to McClellan,    
directly or indirectly, will take Richmond, without endangering any other place which we now    
hold---and will substantially end the war. I expect to maintain this contest until successful, or    
till I die, or am conquered, or my term expires, or Congress or the country forsakes me; and I    
would publicly appeal to the country for this new force, were it not that I fear a general panic    
and stampede would follow---so hard is it to have a thing understood as it really is. I think the    
new force should be all, or nearly all infantry, principally because such can be raised most    
cheaply and quickly. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>To the Governors of the several States: The capture of New Orleans, Norfolk, and Corinth by    
the national forces has enabled the insurgents to concentrate a large force at and about    
Richmond, which place we must take with the least possible delay; in fact, there will soon be no    
formidable insurgent force except at Richmond. With so large an army there, the enemy can    
threaten us on the Potomac and elsewhere. Until we have re-established the national authority,    
all these places must be held, and we must keep    
<pb n="294"/>    
    
a respectable force in front of Washington. But this, from the diminished strength of our Army by    
sickness and casualties, renders an addition to it necessary in order to close the struggle which    
has been prosecuted for the last three months with energy and success. Rather than hazard the    
misapprehension of our military condition and of groundless alarm by a call for troops by    
proclamation, I have deemed it best to address you in this form. To accomplish the object stated    
we require without delay 150,000 men, including those recently called for by the Secretary of    
War. Thus re-enforced, our gallant Army will be enabled to realize the hopes and expectations of    
the Government and the people.</p>

the governors' communication of June 28 is as follows:</p><p>"The undersigned, Governors of    
States of the Union, impressed with the belief that the citizens of the States which they    
respectively represent are of one accord in the hearty desire that the recent successes of the    
Federal arms may be followed up by measures which must insure the speedy restoration of the    
Union; and believing that in view of the present state of the important military movements now in    
progress and the reduced condition of our effective forces in the field, resulting from the usual    
and unavoidable casualties of the service, that the time has arrived for prompt and vigorous    
measures to be adopted by the people in support of the great interests committed to your charge,    
we respectfully request, if it meets with your entire approval, that you at once call upon the    
several States for such number of men as may be required to fill up all military organizations    
now in the field, and add to the armies heretofore organized such additional number of men as may    
in your judgment be necessary to garrison and hold all of the numerous cities and military    
positions that have been captured by our armies, and to speedily crush the rebellion that still    
exists in several of the Southern States, thus practically restoring to the civilized world our    
great and good Government. All believe that the decisive moment is near at hand, and to that end    
the people of the United States are desirous to aid promptly in furnishing all re-enforcements    
that you may deem needful to sustain our Government."(OR, III, II, 180).</p></note>

<p>A Proclamation.</p>    
<p>Whereas, in and by the second section of an Act of Congress passed on the 7th. day of June    
A.D. 1862, entitled "An Act for the collection of direct taxes in insurrectionary districts    
within the United States and for other purposes"it is made the duty of the President to    
declare, on or before the first day of July, then next following, by his proclamation, in what    
States and parts of States insurrection exists:</p>    
<p>Now, therefore, be it known that I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States of    
America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the States of South Carolina, Florida, Georgia,    
Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina; and the State of    
Virginia, except the following counties:--- Hancock, Brooke, Ohio, Marshall, Wetzel, Marion,

now in insurrection and rebellion and,    
<pb n="299"/>    
    
by reason thereof, the civil authority of the United States is obstructed so that the provisions    
of the "Act to provide increased revenue from imports to pay the interest on the public debt,    
and for other purposes,"approved August fifth, eighteen hundred and sixty-one, cannot be    
peaceably executed, and that the taxes legally chargeable upon Real Estate under the Act last    
aforesaid, lying within the States and parts of States as aforesaid, together with a penalty of    
fifty per centum of said taxes shall be a lien upon the Tracts or Lots of the same, severally    
charged till paid.</p>

<p>Your despatch of Tuesday morning induces me to hope your Army is having some rest. In this    
hope, allow me to reason with you a moment. When you ask for fifty thousand men to be promptly    
sent you, you surely labor under some gross mistake of fact. Recently you sent papers showing    
your disposal of forces, made last spring, for the defence of Washington, and advising a return    
to that plan.<ref target="n5-301-2">2</ref>    
 I find it included in, and about Washington seventyfive    
thousand men. Now please be assured, I have not men enough to fill that very plan by fifteen    
thousand. All of Fremont in the valley, all of Banks, all of McDowell, not with you, and all in    
Washington, taken together do not exceed, if they reach sixty thousand. With Wool and Dix added    
to those mentioned, I have not, outside of your Army, seventyfive thousand men East of the    
mountains. Thus, the idea of sending you fifty thousand, or any other considerable force    
promptly, is simply absurd. If in your frequent mention of responsibility, you have the    
impression that I blame you for not doing more than you can, please be relieved of such    
impression. I only beg that in like manner, you will not ask impossibilities of me. If you think    
you are not strong enough to take Richmond just now, I do not ask you to try just now. Save the    
Army, material and personal; and I will strengthen it for the offensive again, as fast as I can.

accept.</p>

<note id="n5-303-1"><p>1 ALS, IHi. McClellan's dispatch of 5:30    
P.M., July 2, sent from Berkeley, Harrison's Bar, via Fort Monroe, reads in part as follows: "I    
have succeeded in getting this army to this place on the banks of the James. . . . I have lost    
but one gun. . . . An hour and a half ago the rear of the wagon train was within a mile of camp,    
and only one wagon abandoned. As usual, we had a severe battle yesterday and beat the enemy    
badly, the men fighting even better than before. We fell back to this position during the night    
and morning. Officers and men thoroughly worn-out by fighting every day and working every night    
for a week. They are in good spirits, and after a little rest will fight better than ever. If not    
attacked during this day I will have the men ready to repulse the enemy to-morrow. . . . Our    
losses have been very heavy, for we have fought every day since last Tuesday. I have not yielded    
an inch of ground unnecessarily, but have retired to prevent the superior force of the enemy from    
cutting me off and to take a different base of operations.</p><p>"I thank you for the re-

<p>I should not want the half of three hundred thousand new troops, if I could have them

against me. The quicker you send, the fewer you will have to send. <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> is everything.    
Please act in view of this. The enemy having given up Corinth, it is not wonderful that he is

<p>I understand your position as stated in your letter, and by Gen. Marcy. To reinforce you so as    
to enable you to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is impossible. In    
addition to that arrived, and now arriving from the Potomac, (about ten thousand, I suppose) and    
about ten thousand I hope you will have from Burnside very soon, and about five thousand from    
Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another man within a month. Under these

where you are, if

to which you will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as opinion, that with    
the aid of the Gun-Boats, and the re-inforcements mentioned above, you can hold your present    
position, provided, and so long as, you can keep the James River open below you. If you are not    
tolerably confident you can keep the James River open, you had better remove as soon as possible.    
I do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as to the danger of having your    
communication cut on the river below you; yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your    
attention. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

<note id="n5-313-2"><p>2 ALS, RPB. On the afternoon of July 10,    
Johnson telegraphed as follows: "Last night I received dispatches from Genl Boyle . . . in    
Kentucky stating that a raid by a cavalry force of 2000 has been made into Ky &amp; asking me to    
send one or two Regts to his relief. . . . Capt O D Greene Asst Adjt Genl of Buell's staff who    
exercises command over the troops here so far as to order them wherever he wishes refuses to take    
notice . . . &amp; afford the necessary relief for Kentucky &amp; Tennessee. This attack is aimed    
at the . . . Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. . . . This Captain Green has not only refused to    
cooperate    
<pb n="314"/>    
</p><p>with me but has used his position . . . in locating the troops here directly in opposition    
to my views. . . . My opinion is that he is at this time in complicity with the traitors here    
&amp; shall therefor have him arrested &amp; sent beyond the Influence of rebels and traitors if    
he is not immediately removed. . . . Mr. President since I reached this place there has been a    
struggle . . . going on between the provost marshalls Brigadier Generals &amp; Staff officers of    
Genl Buell which has retarded the . . . development of Union sentiment. . . . All I ask is to be    
sustained by the President &amp; I will sustain the President. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p>    
<p>On the evening of July 10, Johnson sent a second telegram: "Capt Greene. . . . has since my    
dispatch to you of this afternoon put Lewis D. Campbell, 69th Ohio Vols. &amp; provost marshal    
under arrest because he obeyed an order I issued to him . . . I desire an order from you at once    
reinstating Col Campbell &amp; a transfer of Capt Greene to some post beyond the limits of this    
State. . . . The commission I hold as I conceive gives me full &amp; ample power to appoint a    
Prov. Marshal yet I prefer the order from you. I must have the means to execute my orders or    
abandon the undertaking. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p>    
<p>On July 12, at Lincoln's direction, Stanton ordered Captain Oliver D. Greene to release    
Colonel Lewis D. Campbell and to "turn over your command to the officer next in rank, and leave    
. . . Nashville and report yourself in person to General Buell."(OR, I, XVI, II, 135). Stanton    
notified Johnson of this order and expressed the president's hope that the action would meet    
approval, and that Johnson would "use effots to prevent . . . collision of authority between    
your subordinates and those of General Buell."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.).</p></note>

<p>Whereas, in the judgment of the President, the public safety does require that the Railroad    
line, called and known as the South West Branch of the Pacific Railroad in the State of Missouri,    
be repaired, extended and completed, from Rolla to Lebanon, in the direction to Springfield, in    
the said State, the same being necessary to the successful and economical conduct of the war, and    
to the maintenance of the authority of the government, in the South West. Therefore, under and in    
virtue of the act of Congress entitled "An act to authorise the President of the United States,    
in certain cases, to take possession of Railroad and Telegraph lines, and for other purposes"    
Approved January 31, 1862, it is---</p>    
<p>Ordered that the portion of the said Railroad line which reaches from Rolla to Lebanon, be    
repaired, extended and completed, so as to be made available for the military uses of the    
Government, as speedily as may be. And in as much as, upon the part of the said line from Rolla    
to the stream called Little Piney, a considerable portion of the necessary work has already been    
done, by the Railroad Company, and the road, to this extent, may be completed at comparatively    
small cost, it is ordered that the said line, from</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="315"/>    
Rolla to and across Little Piney, be first completed, and as soon as possible.</p>    
<p>The Secretary is charged with the execution of this order. And, to facilitate the speedy    
execution of the work, he is directed, at his discretion, to take possession and control of the    
whole or such part of the said Railroad line, and the whole or each part of the rolling stock,    
offices, shops, buildings and all their appendages and appertenances, as he may judge necessary    
or convenient for the early completion of the road, from Rolla to Lebanon.</p>

<p>Gentlemen. After the adjournment of Congress, now very near, I shall have no opportunity of    
seeing you for several months. Believing that you of the border-states hold more power for good    
than any other equal number of members, I feel it a duty which I can not justifiably waive, to    
make this appeal to you. I intend no reproach or complaint when I assure you that in my opinion,    
if you all had voted for the resolution in the gradual emancipation message of last March, the    
war would now be substantially ended. And the plan therein proposed is yet one of the most    
potent, and swift means of ending it. Let the states which are in rebellion see, definitely and    
certainly, that, in no event, will the states you represent ever join their proposed Confederacy,    
and they can not, much longer maintain the contest. But you can not divest them of their hope to    
ultimately have you with them so long as you show a determination to perpetuate the institution    
within your own states. Beat them at elections, as you have overwhelmingly done, and, nothing    
daunted, they still claim you as their own. You and I know what the lever of their power is.    
Break that lever before their faces, and they can shake you no more forever.</p>    
<p>Most of you have treated me with kindness and consideration; and I trust you will not now    
think I improperly touch what is exclusively    
<pb n="318"/>    
    
your own, when, for the sake of the whole country I ask "Can you, for your states, do better    
than to take the course I urge? ["] Discarding <hi rend="italic">punctillio</hi> and maxims adapted to more    
manageable times, and looking only to the unprecedentedly stern facts of our case, can you do    
better in any possible even? You prefer that the constitutional relation of the states to the    
nation shall be practically restored, without disturbance of the institution; and if this were    
done, my whole duty, in this respect, under the constitution, and my oath of office, would be    
performed. But it is not done, and we are trying to accomplish it by war. The incidents of the    
war can not be avoided. If the war continue long, as it must, if the object be not sooner    
attained, the institution in your states will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion---by    
the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have nothing valuable in lieu of it.    
Much of it's value is gone already. How much better for you, and for your people, to take the    
step which, at once, shortens the war, and secures substantial compensation for that which is    
sure to be wholly lost in any other event. How much better to thus save the money which else we    
sink forever in the war. How much better to do it while we can, lest the war ere long render us    
pecuniarily unable to do it. How much better for you, as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell    
out, and buy out, that without which the war could never have been, than to sink both the thing    
to be sold, and the price of it, in cutting one another's throats.</p>    
<p>I do not speak of emancipation <hi rend="italic">at once</hi>, but of a <hi rend="italic">decision</hi> at once to    
emancipate <hi rend="italic">gradually</hi>. Room in South America for colonization, can be obtained cheaply,    
and in abundance; and when numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one    
another, the freed people will not be so reluctant to go.</p>    
<p>I am pressed with a difficulty not yet mentioned---one which threatens division among those    
who, united are none too strong. An instance of it is known to you. Gen. Hunter is an honest man.    
He was, and I hope, still is, my friend. I valued him none the less for his agreeing with me in    
the general wish that all men everywhere, could be free. He proclaimed all men free within    
certain states, and I repudiated the proclamation. He expected more good, and less harm from the    
measure, than I could believe would follow. Yet in repudiating it, I gave dissatisfaction, if not    
offence, to many whose support the country can not afford to lose. And this is not the end of it.    
The pressure, in this direction, is still upon me, and is increasing. By conceding what I now    
ask, you can relieve me, and much more, can relieve the country, in this important point. Upon    
these considerations I have again begged your attention to    
<pb n="319"/>    
    
the message of March last. Before leaving the Capital, consider and discuss it among yourselves.    
You are patriots and statesmen; and, as such, I pray you, consider this proposition; and, at the    
least, commend it to the consideration of your states and people. As you would perpetuate popular    
government for the best people in the world, I beseech you that you do in no wise omit this. Our    
common country is in great peril, demanding the loftiest views, and boldest action to bring it    
speedy relief. Once relieved, it's form of government is saved to the world; it's beloved    
history, and cherished memories, are vindicated; and it's happy future fully assured, and    
rendered inconceivably grand. To you, more than to any others, the previlege is given, to assure    
that happiness, and swell that grandeur, and to link your own names therewith forever.</p>

<note id="n5-317-2"><p>2 AD and ADf, DLC-RTL. Lincoln invited the    
representatives and senators of the Border States to the White House and read his address to    
them. On July 14, a majority reply argued against compensated emancipation on the ground that the    
federal government could not stand the expense, that emancipation in any form would further    
consolidate the spirit of rebellion in the seceded states and fan the spirit of secession among    
loyal slaveholders in the Border States, and that emancipation in the Border States would not, as    
the president supposed, lessen the pressure for "unconstitutional"emancipation by proclamation    
of the remaining three million slaves in the seceded states, which the majority were unwilling to    
approve. The majority reply was signed by twenty representatives and senators. On July 15, a    
minority reply in approval of Lincoln's appeal was signed by John W. Noell of Missouri, Samuel L.    
Casey of Kentucky, George P. Fisher of Delaware, Andrew J. Clements of Tennessee, William G.    
Brown, Jacob B. Blair, and Waitman T. Willey of West Virginia. Horace Maynard of Tennessee    
replied individually on July 16, in support of the appeal. The several replies were published in    
full by the New York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> (July 19) as well as other papers.</p></note>

<p>I am told that over 160-000 men have gone into your Army on the Peninsula. When I was with you    
the other day we made out 86,500 remaining, leaving 73,500 to be accounted for. I believe 23,500,    
will cover all the killed, wounded and missing in all your battles and skirmishes, leaving 50-000    
who have left otherwise. Not more than 5000 of these have died, leaving 45,000 of your Army still    
alive, and not with it. I believe half, or two thirds of them are fit for duty to-day. Have you    
any more perfect knowledge of this than I have? If I am right, and you had these men with you,    
you could go into Richmond in the next three days. How can they be got to you? and how can they

<note id="n5-322-2"><p>2 ALS, IHi. McClellan's telegram received    
at 8 P.M. on July 15, reads in part as follows: ". . . The difference between the effective    
force of troops and that expressed in returns is considerable in every Army. All commanders find    
the actual strength less than the strength represented on paper. I have not my own returns for    
the tri-monthly period since arriving at Fort Monroe at hand at this moment but even on paper I    
will not . . . be found to have received one hundred and sixty thousand officers and men present    
although present and absent my returns will be accountable for that number. . . . I find from    
official reports that I have present for duty---Officers three thousand two hundred fifteen.    
Enlisted men Eighty Eight thousand four hundred fifty. In all present for duty Eighty Eight    
thousand six hundred sixty-five. Absent by authority thirty four thousand four hundred seventy    
two---without authority three thousand seven hundred seventy eight. Present and absent, One    
hundred forty four thousand four hundred and seven. The number . . . present sick is sixteen    
thousand six hundred nineteen. . . . Thus the number . . . really absent is thirty eight thousand    
two hundred fifty. Unquestionably of the number present some one absent, say forty thousand will    
cover the absentees. I quite agree with you that more than one half these men are probably fit    
for duty to-day. I have frequently called the attention lately of the War Dept to the evil of    
absenteeism. . . . It is to be remembered that many of those absent by authority are those who    
have got off either sick or wounded . . . and    
<pb n="323"/>    
</p><p>. . . are still reported absent by authority. If I could receive back the absentees and    
could get my sick men up I would need but small reinforcements to enable me to take Richmond. . .    
. I can now control people getting away better for the natural opportunities are better. Leakages    
by desertion occur in every Army and will occur here of course, but I do not at all . . .    
anticipate anything like a recurrence of what has taken place."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>Fellow citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives</p>    
<p>Herewith is the draft of a Bill to compensate any State which may abolish slavery within it's    
limits, the passage of which, substantially as presented, I respectfully, and earnestly    
recommend.</p>    
<p>July 14. 1862. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>    
<p>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in    
Congress assembled, That whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that any    
State shall have lawfully abolished slavery within and throughout such State, either immediately,    
or gradually, it shall be the duty of the President, assisted by the Secretary of the Treasury,    
to prepare and deliver to such State, an amount of six per cent interest bearing bonds, of the    
United States, equal to the aggregate value, at --- dollars per head, of all the slaves within    
such State, as reported by the census of the year One thousand, eight hundred and sixty---the    
whole amount for any one State, to be delivered at once, if the abolishment be immediate, or, in    
equal annual instalments, if it be gradual---interest to begin running on each bond at the time    
of it's delivery, and not before.</p>    
<p>And be it further enacted, That if any State, having so received any such bonds, shall at any    
time afterwards, by law, reintroduce, or tolerate slavery within it's limits, contrary to the act    
of abolishment, upon which such bonds shall have been received, said bonds, so received by said    
State, shall at once be null and void in whosesoever hands they may be, and such State shall    
refund to the United States, all interest which may have been paid on such bonds.</p>

part as follows: "Upon leaving for New York we called to pay our respects and to say one word    
more upon the all engrossing subjects of the hour. . . . You put the question to us then, `Who    
should I appoint if I displace McClellan?' We made no definite reply. . . . But we will say now    
that it appears to us clear that one of the older generals who have been distinguished---Sumner,    
or Heintzelman, should be appointed. We have heard it intimated that Halleck was to be appointed.    
Permit us to say that this would be in our judgment a deplorable mistake. . . ."(DLC-

<p>Mr. Lincoln then replied. As to the moral character of the institution of Slavery, and as to    
its political bearing on the institutions of this or any other Nation, he said there was, between    
him and the committee, no difference of sentiment. He went on to say:</p>    
<p>"Had Slavery no existence among us, and were the question asked shall we adopt such an    
institution? we should agree as to the reply which should be made. If there be any diversity in    
our views it is not as to whether we should receive Slavery when free from it, but as to how we    
may best get rid of it already amongst us. Were an individual asked whether he would wish to have    
a wen on his neck, he could not hesitate as to the reply; but were it asked whether a man who has    
such a wen should at once be relieved of it by the application of the surgeon's knife, there    
might be diversity of opinion, perhaps the man might bleed to death, as the result of such an

<p>Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and House of Representatives,</p>    
<p>Considering the bill for "An act to suppress insurrection, to punish treason, and rebellion,    
to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and for other purposes"and the Joint Resolution    
[explanatory of said act,]<ref target="n5-328-2">2</ref>    
 as being substantially one, I have    
apporved and signed both.</p>    
<p>Before I was informed of the passage of the Resolution, I had prepared the draft of a Message,    
stating objections to the bill becoming a law, a copy of which draft is herewith transmitted.</p>    
<p>[ABRAHAM LINCOLN]</p>    
<p>[July 17, 1862.]</p>    
<p>Fellow citizens of the House of Representatives</p>    
<p>I herewith return to your honorable body, in which it originated, the bill for an act entitled    
"An act to suppress treason and rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of rebels, and    
for other purposes"together with my objections to it's becoming a law.</p>    
<p>There is much in the bill to which I perceive no objection. It is wholly prospective; and it    
touches neither person or property, of any loyal citizen; in which particulars, it is just and    
proper. The first and second sections provide for the conviction and punishment of persons who    
shall be guilty of treason, and persons who shall "incite, set on foot, assist, or engage in any    
rebellion, or insurrection, against the authority of the United States, or the laws thereof, or    
shall give aid or comfort thereto, or shall engage in, or give aid and comfort to any such    
existing rebellion, or insurrection"By fair construction, persons within these sections are not    
to be punished without regular trials, in duly constituted courts,    
<pb n="329"/>    
    
under the forms, and all the substantial provisions of law, and of the constitution, applicable    
to their several cases. To this I perceive no objection; especially as such persons would be    
within the general pardoning power, and also the special provision for pardon and amnesty,    
contained in this act. It is also provided, that the slaves of persons convicted under these    
sections shall be free. I think there is an unfortunate form of expression, rather than a    
substantial objection, in this. It is startling to say that congress can free a slave within a    
state; and yet if it were said the ownership of the slave had first been transferred to the    
nation, and that congress had then liberated, him, the difficulty would at once vanish. And this    
is the real case. The traitor against the general government forfets his slave, at least as    
justly as he does any other property; and he forfeits both to the government against which he    
offends. The government, so far as there can be ownership, thus owns the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>]    
forfeited slaves; and the question for Congress, in regard to them is, "Shall they be made free,    
or be sold to new masters?"I perceive no objection to Congress deciding in advance that they    
shall be free. To the high honor of Kentucky, as I am informed, she has been the owner of some    
slaves by <hi rend="italic">escheat</hi>, and that she sold none, but liberated all. I hope the same is true of    
some other states. Indeed, I do not believe it would be physically possible, for the General    
government, to return persons, so circumstanced, to actual slavery. I believe there would be    
physical resistance to it, which could neither be turned aside by argument, nor driven away by    
force. In this view I have no objection to this feature of the bill. Another matter involved in    
these two sections, and running through other parts of the act, will be noticed hereafter.</p>    
<p>I perceive no objection to the third and fourth sections.</p>    
<p>So far as I wish to notice the fifth, and sixth sections, they may be considered together.<ref target="n5-329-1">1</ref>    
 That the enforcement of these sections would do no injustice to the    
persons embraced within them, is clear. That those who make a causeless war should be compelled    
to pay the cost of it, is too obviously just, to be called in question.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="330"/>    
To give governmental protection to the property of persons who have abandoned it, and gone on a    
crusade to overthrow that same government, is absurd, if considered in the mere light of justice.    
The severest justice may not always be the best policy. The principle of seizing, and    
appropriating the property of the persons embraced within these sections is certainly not very    
objectionable; but a justly discriminating application of it, would be very difficult, and, to a    
great extent, impossible. And would it not be wise to place a power of remission somewhere, so    
that these persons may know they have something to lose by persisting, and something to save by    
desisting?<ref target="n5-330-1">1</ref>    
 I am not sure whether such power of remission is or is not    
within section Thirteen.</p>    
<p>Without any special act of congress, I think our military commanders, when, in military    
phrase, "they are within the enemies country"should in an orderly manner, seize and use    
whatever of real or personal property may be necessary or convenient for their commands; at the    
same time, preserving, in some way, the evidence of what they do.</p>    
<p>What I have said in regard to slaves, while commenting on the first and second sections, is    
applicable to the ninth, with the difference, that no provision is made in the whole act for    
determining whether a particular individual slave does or does not fall within the classes    
defined in that section. He is to be free upon certain conditions; but whether those conditions    
do, or do not pertain to him, no mode of ascertaining is provided. This could be easily    
supplied.</p>    
<p>To the tenth section, I make no objection. The oath therein required seems to be proper; and    
the remainder of the section is substantially identical with an already existing law.</p>    
<p>The eleventh section simply assumes to confer discretionary powers upon the executive. Without    
this law I have no hesitation to go as far in the direction indicated, as I may at any time deem    
expedient. And I am ready to say now I think it is proper for our military commanders to employ,    
as laborers, as many persons of African de[s]cent, as can be used to advantage.</p>    
<p>The twelfth and thirteenth sections are something better than objectionable; and the    
fourteenth is entirely proper if all other parts of the act shall stand.</p>    
<p>That to which I chiefly object, pervades most parts of the act, but more distinctly appears in    
the first, second, seventh and eighth    
<pb n="331"/>    
    
sections. It is the sum of those provisions which results in the divesting of title forever. For    
the causes of treason, and the ingredients of treason, not amounting to the full crime, it    
declares forfeiture, extending beyond the lives of the guilty parties; whereas the Constitution    
of the United States declares that "no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or    
forfeiture, except during the life of the person attainted."True, there is to be no formal    
attainder in this case; still I think the greater punishment can not be constitutionally    
inflicted, in a different form, for the same offence. With great respect, I am constrained to say    
I think this feature of the act is unconstitutional. It would not be difficult to modify it.</p>    
<p>I may remark that this provision of the constitution, put in language borrowed from Great    
Brittain, applies only in this country, as I understand, to real, or landed estate.</p>    
<p>Again, this act, by proceedings <hi rend="italic">in rem</hi> forfeits property, for the ingredients of    
treason, without a conviction of the supposed criminal, or a personal hearing given him in any    
proceeding. That we may not touch property lying within our reach, because we can not give    
personal notice to an owner who is absent endeavoring to destroy the govern[ment,] is certainly    
not very satisfactory; still the owner may not be thus engaged, and I think a reasonable time    
should be provided for such parties to appear and have personal hearings. Similar provisions are    
not uncommon in connection with proceedings <hi rend="italic">in rem</hi>.</p>    
<p>For the reasons stated I return the bill to the House in which it originated.</p>

resolution is as follows: "Resolved. . . . That the provisions of the third clause of the fifth    
section . . . shall be so construed as not to apply to any act or acts done prior to the passage    
thereof; nor to include any member of a State legislature, or judge of any State court, who has    
not in accepting or entering upon his office, taken an oath to support the constitution of the

<note id="n5-336-2"><p>2 ADf, DLC-RTL. The first paragraph of this    
draft was issued as the proclamation of July 25, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>. According to Lincoln's    
recollection as quoted by Francis B. Carpenter in <hi rend="italic">Six Months at the White House</hi> (pp. 20-    
22), Montgomery Blair opposed the proclamation of emancipation on the ground that it would cost    
the administration the fall election, and Seward approved it but proposed that issuance be    
postponed until military success gave the administration a more favorable position. Bates' Diary    
is silent on this discussion, but Nicolay and Hay in <hi rend="italic">Abraham Lincoln: A History</hi> (VI,    
127) record that Bates gave "unreserved concurrence."On the day following the meeting    
Postmaster General Blair wrote Lincoln a lengthy opinion objecting to the proclamation on    
political grounds. "There is therefore no public sentiment at the North, even among extreme men    
which now demands the proposed measure,"he wrote. It would "endanger our power in Congress,    
and put the power in the next House of Representatives in the hands of those opposed to the war,    
or to our mode of carrying it on,"but "if adopted to meet foreign intervention and to make    
issue between the Governments of Europe and the people there,"the measure might be favorably    
received (D, DLC-Chase Papers). Chase's Diary records the cabinet discussion as follows: "The    
question of arming slaves was then brought up and I advocated it warmly. The President was    
unwilling to adopt this measure, but proposed to issue a proclamation, on the basis of the    
Confiscation Bill, calling upon the States to return to their allegiance . . . adding, on his own    
part, a declaration of his intention to renew, at the next session of Congress, his    
recommendation of compensation to States adopting the gradual abolishment of slavery---and    
proclaiming the emancipation of all slaves within States remaining in insurrection on the first    
of January, 1863.</p><p>"I said that I should give to such a measure my cordial support; but I    
should prefer that no new expression on the subject of compensation should be made, and I thought    
that the measure of Emancipation could be much better and more quietly accomplished by allowing    
Generals to organize and arm the slaves . . . and by directing the Commanders of Departments to    
proclaim emancipation within their Districts as soon as practicable; but I regarded this as so    
much better than inaction on the subject, that I should give it my entire support. . . ."    
(<hi rend="italic">Diary and Correspondence of Salmon P. Chase</hi>, pp. 48-49).</p></note>    
<note id="n5-336-3"><p>3 The sixth section provided that property    
of persons in States in rebellion, who did not cease to give aid to the rebellion within sixty    
days after proclamation by the president, would be liable to seizure. At Lincoln's direction    
Stanton prepared on July 22 the Executive Order authorizing seizure of property "which may be    
necessary or convenient"and the employment of "so many persons of African descent as can be    
advantageously used for military or naval purposes."This order was issued by the Adjutant    
General's Office on August

<p>Sir---I think it will be better to do nothing now which can be construed into a demand for    
troops in addition to the three hundred thousand for which we have recently called. We do not    
need more, nor, indeed, so many, if we could have the smaller number very soon. It is a very    
important consideration, too, that one recruit into an old regiment is nearly or quite equal in    
value to two in a new one. We can scarcely afford to forego any plan within our power, which may    
facilitate the filling of the old regiments with recruits. If, on consideration, you are of    
opinion that this object can be advanced, by causing the Militia of the several states to be    
enrolled, and by drafts therefrom, you are at liberty to take the proper steps, and do so,    
provided that any number of recruits so obtained from any state within the next three months,    
shall, if practicable, be an abatement, of the quota of volunteers from such state under the    
recent call. Yours truly A. LINCOLN.</p>

Lincoln to direct Stanton's order of August 4, 1862, calling for a draft of three hundred

<p>My Dear Sir. Yours of the 16th. by the hand of Governor Shepley is received. It seems the    
Union feeling in Louisiana is being crushed out by the course of General Phelps. Please pardon me    
for believing that is a false pretense. The people of Louisiana---all intelligent people every    
where---know full well, that I never    
<pb n="343"/>    
    
had a wish to touch the foundations of their society, or any right of theirs. With perfect    
knowledge of this, they forced a necessity upon me to send armies among them, and it is their own    
fault, not mine, that they are annoyed by the presence of General Phelps. They also know the    
remedy---know how to be cured of General Phelps. Remove the necessity of his presence. And might    
it not be well for them to consider whether they have not already had <hi rend="italic">time</hi> enough to do    
this? If they can conceive of anything worse than General Phelps, within my power, would they not    
better be looking out for it? They very well know the way to avert all this is simply to take    
their place in the Union upon the old terms. If they will not do this, should they not receive    
harder blows rather than lighter ones?</p>    
<p>You are ready to say I apply to <hi rend="italic">friends</hi> what is due only to <hi rend="italic">enemies</hi>. I    
distrust the <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> if not the <hi rend="italic">sincerity</hi> of friends, who would hold my hands    
while my enemies stab me. This appeal of professed friends has paralyzed me more in this struggle    
than any other one thing. You remember telling me the day after the Baltimore mob in April 1861,    
that it would crush all Union feeling in Maryland for me to attempt bringing troops over Maryland    
soil to Washington. I brought the troops notwithstanding, and yet there was Union feeling enough    
left to elect a Legislature the next autumn which in turn elected a very excellent Union U. S.    
Senator!</p>    
<p>I am a patient man---always willing to forgive on the Christian terms of repentance; and also    
to give ample <hi rend="italic">time</hi> for repentance. Still I must save this government if possible. What I    
<hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> do, of course I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> not do; but it may as well be understood, once for    
all, that I shall not surrender this game leaving any available card unplayed. Yours truly A

<p>Sir: The copy of a letter addressed to yourself by Mr. Thomas J. Durant, has been shown to me.    
The writer appears to be an able, a dispassionate, and an entirely sincere man. The first part of    
the letter is devoted to an effort to show that the Secession Ordinance of Louisiana was adopted    
against the will of a majority of the people. This is probably true; and in that fact may be    
found some instruction. Why did they allow the Ordinance to go into effect? Why did they not    
assert themselves? Why stand passive and allow themselves to be trodden down by a minority? Why    
did they not hold popular meetings, and have a convention of their own, to express and enforce    
the true sentiment of the state? If preorganization was against them <hi rend="italic">then</hi>, why not do    
this <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, that the United States Army is present to protect them? The paralysis</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="345"/>    
---the dead palsy---of the government in this whole struggle is, that this class of men will do    
nothing for the government, nothing for themselves, except demanding that the government shall    
not strike its open enemies, lest they be struck by accident!</p>    
<p>Mr. Durant complains that in various ways the relation of master and slave is disturbed by the    
presence of our Army; and he considers it particularly vexatious that this, in part, is done    
under cover of an act of Congress, while constitutional guaranties are suspended on the plea of    
military necessity. The truth is, that what is done, and omitted, about slaves, is done and    
omitted on the same military necessity. It is a military necessity to have men and money; and we    
can get neither, in sufficient numbers, or amounts, if we keep from, or drive from, our lines,    
slaves coming to them. Mr. Durant cannot be ignorant of the pressure in this direction; nor of my    
efforts to hold it within bounds till he, and such as he shall have time to help themselves.</p>    
<p>I am not posted to speak understandingly on all the police regulations of which Mr. Durant    
complains. If experience shows any one of them to be wrong, let them be set right. I think I can    
perceive, in the freedom of trade, which Mr. Durant urges, that he would relieve both friends and    
enemies from the pressure of the blockade. By this he would serve the enemy more effectively than    
the enemy is able to serve himself. I do not say or believe that to serve the enemy is the    
purpose of Mr. Durant; or that he is conscious of any purpose, other than national and patriotic    
ones. Still, if there were a class of men who, having no choice of sides in the contest, were    
anxious only to have quiet and comfort for themselves while it rages, and to fall in with the    
victorious side at the end of it, without loss to themselves, their advice as to the mode of    
conducting the contest would be precisely such as his is. He speaks of no duty---apparently    
thinks of none---resting upon Union men. He even thinks it injurious to the Union cause that they    
should be restrained in trade and passage without taking sides. They are to touch neither a sail    
nor a pump, but to be merely passengers,---dead-heads at that---to be carried snug and dry,    
throughout the storm, and safely landed right side up. Nay, more; even a mutineer is to go    
untouched lest these sacred passengers receive an accidental wound.</p>    
<p>Of course the rebellion will never be suppressed in Louisiana, if the professed Union men    
there will neither help to do it, nor permit the government to do it without their help.</p>    
<p>Now, I think the true remedy is very different from what is suggested by Mr. Durant. It does    
not lie in rounding the rough angles    
<pb n="346"/>    
    
of the war, but in removing the necessity for the war. The people of Louisiana who wish    
protection to person and property, have but to reach forth their hands and take it. Let them, in    
good faith, reinaugurate the national authority, and set up a State Government conforming thereto    
under the constitution. They know how to do it, and can have the protection of the Army while    
doing it. The Army will be withdrawn so soon as such State government can dispense with its    
presence; and the people of the State can then upon the old Constitutional terms, govern    
themselves to their own liking. This is very simple and easy.</p>    
<p>If they will not do this, if they prefer to hazard all for the sake of destroying the    
government, it is for them to consider whether it is probable I will surrender the government to    
save them from losing all. If they decline what I suggest, you scarcely need to ask what I will    
do. What would you do in my position? Would you drop the war where it is? Or, would you prosecute    
it in future, with elder-stalk squirts, charged with rose water? Would you deal lighter blows    
rather than heavier<ref target="n5-346-1">1</ref>    
 ones? Would you give up the contest, leaving any    
available means unapplied.</p>    
<p>I am in no boastful mood. I shall not do <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than I can, and I shall do <hi rend="italic">all</hi>    
I can to save the government, which is my sworn duty as well as my personal inclination. I shall    
do nothing in malice. What I deal with is too vast for malicious dealing. Yours truly</p>

Hay's handwriting signed by Lincoln, was returned to John G. Nicolay by General Nathaniel P.    
Banks, on March 13, 1865, with a request that the president "consent that his letter will be

<p>Dear Sir: You send to Mr. W[eed] an extract from a letter written at New Orleans the 9th    
instant, which is shown to me. You do not give the writer's name; but plainly he is a man of    
ability, and probably of some note. He says: "The time has arrived when Mr. Lincoln must take a    
decisive course. Trying to please everybody, he will satisfy nobody. A vacillating policy in    
matters of importance is the very worst. Now is the time, if ever, for honest men who love their    
country to rally to its support. Why will not the North say officially that it wishes for the    
restoration of the Union as it was?"</p>    
<p>And so, it seems, this is the point on which the writer thinks I have no policy. Why will he    
not read and understand what I have said?</p>    
<p>The substance of the very declaration he desires is in the inaugural, in each of the two    
regular messages to Congress, and in many, if not all, the minor documents issued by the    
Executive since the inauguration.</p>    
<p>Broken eggs cannot be mended; but Louisiana has nothing to do now but to take her place in the    
Union as it was, barring the already broken eggs. The sooner she does so, the smaller will be the    
amount of that which will be past mending. This government cannot much longer play a game in    
which it stakes all, and its enemies stake nothing. Those enemies must understand that they    
cannot experiment for ten years trying to destroy the government, and if they fail still come    
back into the Union unhurt. If they expect in any contingency to ever have the Union as it was, I    
join with the writer in saying, "Now is the time."</p>    
<p>How much better it would have been for the writer to have gone    
<pb n="351"/>    
    
at this, under the protection of the army at New Orleans, than to have sat down in a closet    
writing complaining letters northward! Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

not publish them because I know they would exercise a most serious influence upon the public    
mind."The enclosed letter of July 28, reads in part as follows: "Can you enlighten the people    
in regard to the real object. . . . of the Administration . . . in relation to the rebellion? The    
people are uneasy, anxious and suspicious. They begin to fear . . . that we are trifled with,    
that there is not &amp; never has been any serious determination to put down the rebels. . . .    
Appearances seem conclusive as to the correctness of this view. . . . the great army of the    
Potomac, so full of strategy, is hid away under the protection of gun boats &amp; cannot, or dare    
not or will not move &amp; . . . the President with full power to act . . . hangs back,    
hesitates, &amp; leaves the country to drift. . . . Does this mean that he does not care what    
becomes of the country---that he is ready to play conservative to the ruin of the Nation? We fear    
it. . . . If you know any cause for hope &amp; patience give it to us. Let us once more breathe

<opener>Executive Mansion Washington August 4. 1862</opener>    
<p>Dear Sir: Your very acceptable letter dated Orbe Canton de Vaud, Switzerland 18th of July 1862    
is received. The moral effect was the worst of the affair before Richmond; and that has run its    
course downward; we are now at a stand, and shall soon be rising again, as we hope. I believe it    
is true that in men and material, the enemy suffered more than we, in that series of conflicts;    
while it is certain he is less able to bear it.</p>    
<p>With us every soldier is a man of character and must be treated with more consideration than    
is customary in Europe. Hence our great army for slighter causes than could have prevailed there    
has dwindled rapidly, bringing the necessity for a new call, earlier than was anticipated. We    
shall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have    
resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems strange, even to me, but it is true, that the    
Government is now pressed to this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to    
personally enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes, provided they    
can have assurance that unwilling persons similarly situated will be compelled to do like wise.    
Besides this, volunteers mostly choose to enter newly forming regiments, while drafted men can be    
sent to fill up the old ones, wherein, man for man, they are quite doubly as valuable.</p>    
<p>You ask "why is it that the North with her great armies, so often is found, with inferiority    
of numbers, face to face with the armies of the South?"While I painfully know the fact, a    
military man, which I am not, would better answer the question. The fact I know, has not been    
overlooked; and I suppose the cause of its continuance lies mainly in the other facts that the    
enemy holds the interior, and we the exterior lines; and that we operate where the people convey    
information to the enemy, while he operates where they convey none to us.</p>    
<p>I have received the volume and letter which you did me the honor of addressing to me, and for    
which please accept my sincere thanks. You are much admired in America for the ability of your    
writings, and much loved for your generosity to us, and your devotion to liberal principles    
generally.</p>    
<p>You are quite right, as to the importance to us, for its bearing upon Europe, that we should    
achieve military successes; and the same is true for us at home as well as abroad. Yet it seems    
unreasonable that a series of successes, extending through half-a-year.    
<pb n="356"/>    
    
and clearing more than a hundred thousand square miles of country, should help us so little,    
while a single half-defeat should hurt us so much. But let us be patient.</p>    
<p>I am very happy to know that my course has not conflicted with your judgement, of propriety    
and policy.</p>    
<p>I can only say that I have acted upon my best convictions without selfishness or malice, and    
that by the help of God, I shall continue to do so.</p>    
<p>Please be assured of my highest respect and esteem.</p>

<note id="n5-355-1"><p>1 Copy, DLC-RTL. The unsigned copy in John    
Hay's handwriting has "Dear Sir"added in Lincoln's hand. A translation of Count Gasparin's    
letter of July 18, furnished to Lincoln by Secretary Seward on August 1, reads as    
follows:</p><p>"It is in moments of difficulty that friends should show themselves.</p>    
<p>"The check sustained by the federal army before Richmond was certainly a situation of    
difficulty for the United States. Learn that your friends in Europe do not lose courage, and that    
they pray for you.</p>    
<p>"This, besides, is not a Bull Run. There is nothing in it like defeat. The mischief, please    
God, will soon be repaired.</p>    
<p>"Why is it that the north with her great armies, so often is found, with inferiority in    
numbers, face to face with the armies of the South? You know that battles are won by the feet!    
and that the great principle of war is to concentrate forces in place of scattering them. It is    
necessary that at important points the national troops should always outnumber those of the rebel    
forces. It seems that the contrary has too often taken place.</p>    
<p>"Have you received, recently, the volume and the letter I had the honor to address to you? I    
have attempted to sustain in Europe a struggle which is not always easy. There, assuredly, the    
greatest peril of America is to be found; without Europe; without the chances of European    
intervention, or mediation, the revolt . . . would have been at an end long since.</p>    
<p>"That ideas of intervention may be counteracted in our old world, there is need not only of    
military successes achieved by you, but more than that, a continuation of your wise policy;    
avoid, I entreat you, the complications you may find in Mexico---avoid also, revolutionary    
me[a]sures---confiscations---capital punishments---appeals to the negroes---precipitate    
emancipation.</p>    
<p>"You have traced a programme which every upright mind must applaud. Whilst developing it in    
the spirit of liberty, it tends to the preservation of fundamental principles. On the day when it    
can be said in Europe that your Government is, either indifferent to abolition, or carried away    
by the extreme abolitionists, the partizans of intervention, in favor of the South, will succeed    
in effecting it.</p>    
<p>"Pardon me for writing these things to you, my excuse lies in the interest which I take in    
the cause of which you are the worthy representative.</p>    
<p>"Accept Sir the assurance of my devotion and of my respect."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>A deputation of Western gentlemen waited upon the President this morning to offer two colored    
regiments from the State of Indiana. Two members of Congress were of the party. The President    
<pb n="357"/>    
    
received them courteously, but stated to them that he was not prepared to go the length of    
enlisting negroes as soldiers. He would employ all colored men offered as laborers, but would not    
promise to make soldiers of them.</p>    
<p>The deputation came away satisfied that it is the determination of the Government not to arm    
negroes unless some new and more pressing emergency arises. The President argued that the nation    
could not afford to lose Kentucky at this crisis, and gave it as his opinion that to arm the    
negroes would turn 50,000 bayonets from the loyal Border States against us that were for us.</p>    
<p>Upon the policy of using negroes as laborers, the confiscation of Rebel property, and the    
feeding the National troops upon the granaries of the enemy, the President said there was no    
division of sentiment. He did not explain, however, why it is that the Army of the Potomac and    
the Army of Virginia carry out this policy so differently. The President promised that the war    
should be prosecuted with all the rigor he could command, but he could not promise to arm slaves    
or to attempt slave insurrections in the Rebel States. The recent enactments of Congress on    
emancipation and confiscation he expects to carry out.</p>

<p>FELLOW-CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion,    
[applause] but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves,    
[applause and laughter;] and I offer, in justification of myself and of you, that, upon    
examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution against. [Renewed applause.] I, however,    
have an impression that there are younger gentlemen who will entertain you better, [voices---    
"No, no; none can do better than yourself. Go on!"] and better address your understanding, than    
I will or could, and therefore, I propose but to detain you a moment longer. [Cries---"Go on!    
Tar and feather the rebels!"]</p>    
<p>I am very little inclined on any occasion to say anything unless I hope to produce some good    
by it. [A voice---"You do that; go on.] The only thing I think of just now not likely to be    
better said by some one else, is <hi rend="italic">a matter in which we have heard some other persons blamed    
for what I did myself</hi>. [Voices---"What is it?] There has been a very wide-spread attempt to    
have a quarrel between</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="359"/>    
Gen. McClellan and the Secretary of War. <hi rend="italic">Now, I occupy a position that enables me to observe,    
at least, these two gentlemen are not nearly so deep in the quarrel as some pretending to be    
their friends</hi>. [Cries of "Good."] Gen. McClellan's attitude is such that, in the very    
selfishness of his nature, he cannot but wish to be successful, and I hope he will---and the    
Secretary of War is in precisely the same situation. If the military commanders in the field    
cannot be successful, not only the Secretary of War, but myself for the time being the master of    
them both, cannot be but failures. [Laughter and applause.] I know Gen. McClellan wishes to be    
successful, and I know he does not wish it any more than the Secretary of War for him, and both    
of them together no more than I wish it. [Applause and cries of "Good."] Sometimes we have a    
dispute about how many men Gen. McClellan has had, and those who would disparage him say that he    
has had a very large number, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War insist that Gen.    
McClellan has had a very small number. The basis for this is, <hi rend="italic">there is always a wide    
difference, and on this occasion, perhaps, a wider one between the grand total on McClellan's    
rolls and the men actually fit for duty</hi>; and those who would disparage him talk of the grand    
total on paper, and those who would disparage the Secretary of War talk of those at present fit    
for duty. Gen. McClellan <hi rend="italic">has sometimes asked for things that the Secretary of War did not    
give him</hi>. Gen. McClellan is not to blame for asking what he wanted and needed, and the    
Secretary of War <hi rend="italic">is not to blame for not giving when he had none to give</hi>. [Applause,    
laughter, and cries of "Good, good."] And I say here, as far as I know, <hi rend="italic">the Secretary of    
War has withheld no one thing at any time in my power to give him</hi>. [Wild applause, and a    
voice---"Give him enough now!"] I have no accusation against him. <hi rend="italic">I believe he is a brave    
and able man</hi>, [applause,] and I stand here, as justice requires me to do, <hi rend="italic">to take upon    
myself what has been charged on the Secretary of War, as withholding from him</hi>.</p>    
<p>I have talked longer than I expected to do, [cries of "No, no---go on,"] and now I avail    
myself of my privilege of saying no more.</p>

<p>I have examined and seen tried the "Rafael Repeater"and consider it a decided improvement    
upon what was called the "Coffee Mill Gun"in these particulars that it dispenses with the    
great cost and liability to loss of the Steel cartridges and that it is better arranged to    
prevent the escape of gas. Other advantages are claimed for it upon which I cannot so well speak.    
While I do not order it into the service I think it well worthy of the attention of the Ordnance    
Bureau and should be rather pleased if it should be decided to put it into the service Yours

two, have been cashiered by Court Martial for misconduct at the battle of June 27th. The records    
in the cases of the two named are now before me. I suppose that the law and the nature of the

<p>This afternoon the President of the United States gave audience to a Committee of colored men    
at the White House. They were introduced    
<pb n="371"/>    
    
by the Rev. J. Mitchell, Commissioner of Emigration. E. M. Thomas, the Chairman, remarked that    
they were there by invitation to hear what the Executive had to say to them. Having all been    
seated, the President, after a few preliminary observations, informed them that a sum of money    
had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at his disposition for the purpose of aiding the    
colonization in some country of the people, or a portion of them, of African descent, thereby    
making it his duty, as it had for a long time been his inclination, to favor that cause; and why,    
he asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and where? Why should they leave this    
country? This is, perhaps, the first question for proper consideration. You and we are different    
races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.    
Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great    
disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffer very greatly, many of them by living among    
us, while ours suffer from your presence. In a word we suffer on each side. If this is admitted,    
it affords a reason at least why we should be separated. You here are freemen I suppose.</p>    
<p>A VOICE: Yes, sir.</p>    
<p>The President---Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are suffering,    
in my judgment, the greatest wrong    
<pb n="372"/>    
    
inflicted on any people. But even when you cease to be slaves, you are yet far removed from being    
placed on an equality with the white race. You are cut off from many of the advantages which the    
other race enjoy. The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free, but on this    
broad continent, not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours. Go    
where you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you.</p>    
<p>I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact with which we have to deal. I    
cannot alter it if I would. It is a fact, about which we all think and feel alike, I and you. We    
look to our condition, owing to the existence of the two races on this continent. I need not    
recount to you the effects upon white men, growing out of the institution of Slavery. I believe    
in its general evil effects on the white race. See our present condition---the country engaged in    
war!---our white men cutting one another's throats, none knowing how far it will extend; and then    
consider what we know to be the truth. But for your race among us there could not be war,    
although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other. Nevertheless,    
I repeat, without the institution of Slavery and the colored race as a basis, the war could not    
have an existence.</p>    
<p>It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated. I know that there are free men among    
you, who even if they could better their condition are not as much inclined to go out of the    
country as those, who being slaves could obtain their freedom on this condition. I suppose one of    
the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see    
that his comfort would be advanced by it. You may believe you can live in Washington or elsewhere    
in the United States the remainder of your life [as easily], perhaps more so than you can in any    
foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the    
idea of going to a foreign country. This is (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish    
view of the case.</p>    
<p>But you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves. There is    
an unwillingness on the part of our people, harsh as it may be, for you free colored people to    
remain with us. Now, if you could give a start to white people, you would open a wide door for    
many to be made free. If we deal with those who are not free at the beginning, and whose    
intellects are clouded by Slavery, we have very poor materials to start with. If intelligent    
colored men, such as are before me, would move in this matter, much might be accomplished. It is    
exceedingly important that    
<pb n="373"/>    
    
we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men, and not those who have been    
systematically oppressed.</p>    
<p>There is much to encourage you. For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of    
your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the white people. It is    
a cheering thought throughout life that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of    
those who have been subject to the hard usage of the world. It is difficult to make a man    
miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself, and claims kindred to the great God who made    
him. In the American Revolutionary war sacrifices were made by men engaged in it; but they were    
cheered by the future. Gen. Washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had    
remained a British subject. Yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting his    
race---something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own.</p>    
<p>The colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time. In a certain sense it is a success.    
The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me---the first time I ever saw him. He    
says they have within the bounds of that colony between 300,000 and 400,000 people, or more than    
in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and    
less than in some of our larger ones. They are not all American colonists, or their descendants.    
Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this country. Many of the original    
settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere, their offspring outnumber those deceased.</p>    
<p>The question is if the colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there? One reason    
for an unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country    
of your nativity. I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race. It does not    
strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them. But still you are attached to them at    
all events.</p>    
<p>The place I am thinking about having for a colony is in Central America. It is nearer to us    
than Liberia---not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by    
steamers. Unlike Liberia it is on a great line of travel---it is a highway. The country is a very    
excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially    
because of the similarity of climate with your native land---thus being suited to your physical    
condition.</p>    
<p>The particular place I have in view is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean    
Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this    
<pb n="374"/>    
    
particular place has all the advantages for a colony. On both sides there are harbors among the    
finest in the world. Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines. A certain amount of coal    
is valuable in any country, and there may be more than enough for the wants of the country. Why I    
attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for    
immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes.</p>    
<p>If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so where there    
is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make a farm. But if something is started so that you can    
get your daily bread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage. Coal land is the best    
thing I know of with which to commence an enterprise.</p>    
<p>To return, you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended    
by gentlemen, who have an interest in the country, including the coal mines. We have been    
mistaken all our lives if we do not know whites as well as blacks look to their self-interest.    
Unless among those deficient of intellect everybody you trade with makes something. You meet with    
these things here as elsewhere.</p>    
<p>If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is whether it cannot be    
made of advantage to you. You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on    
external help as on self-reliance. Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves. As to the coal    
mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance.</p>    
<p>I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provisions made that you shall not    
be wronged. If you will engage in the enterprise I will spend some of the money intrusted to me.    
I am not sure you will succeed. The Government may lose the money, but we cannot succeed unless    
we try; but we think, with care, we can succeed.</p>    
<p>The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory condition as I wish.    
There are contending factions in that quarter; but it is true all the factions are agreed alike    
on the subject of colonization, and want it, and are more generous than we are here. To your    
colored race they have no objection. Besides, I would endeavor to have you made equals, and have    
the best assurance that you should be the equals of the best.</p>    
<p>The practical thing I want to ascertain is whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with    
their wives and children, who are willing to go, when I present evidence of encouragement and    
<pb n="375"/>    
    
protection. Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, to    
"cut their own fodder,"so to speak? Can I have fifty? If I could find twenty-five able-bodied    
men, with a mixture of women and children, good things in the family relation, I think I could    
make a successful commencement.</p>    
<p>I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not. This is the practical part of my    
wish to see you. These are subjects of very great importance, worthy of a month's study,    
[instead] of a speech delivered in an hour. I ask you then to consider seriously not pertaining    
to yourselves merely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of the    
things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind---not confined to the present    
generation, but as</p>    
<p>"From age to age descends the lay,</p>    
<p>To millions yet to be,</p>    
<p>Till far its echoes roll away,</p>    
<p>Into eternity."</p>    
<p>The above is merely given as the substance of the President's remarks.</p>    
<p>The Chairman of the delegation briefly replied that "they would hold a consultation and in a    
short time give an answer."The President said: "Take your full time---no hurry at all."</p>    
<p>The delegation then withdrew.</p>

<note id="n5-370-2"><p>2 New York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, August 15,    
1862. An act "releasing certain persons held to labor in the District of Columbia"and    
providing $100,000 for colonization, became law on April 16, 1862, and an act approved on July    
16, freed slaves in the hands of the army and granted $500,000 for colonization. Since October,    
1861, the Chiriqui Project for colonization had been under cabinet consideration (see Lincoln to    
Smith October 23 and 24, 1861, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>). The appointment of Reverend James Mitchell of    
Indiana as agent of emigration is not listed in the <hi rend="italic">Official Register</hi>, but contemporary    
records indicate that he operated in the Department of Interior as early as May 28, 1862, when he    
sent Lincoln his long letter on colonization printed by the Government Printing Office. His    
activity in July and August brought the matter of colonization to a head with the arrangement for    
an interview between Lincoln and the committee of Negroes headed by Edward M. Thomas on August    
14. Thomas was president of the Anglo-African Institute for the Encouragement of Industry and    
Art. The committee's reception of Lincoln's views is indicated by a letter from Thomas written on    
August 16:</p><p>"We would respectfully suggest that it is necessary that we should confer with    
leading colored men in Phila New York and Boston upon the movement of emigration to the point    
recommended in your address.</p>    
<p>"We were entirely hostile to the movement until all the advantages were so ably brought to    
our view by you and we believe that our friends and colaborers for our race in those cities will    
when the subject is explained by us to them join heartily in sustaining such a movement. . . ."    
(DLC-RTL).</p>    
<p>Subsequent developments, however, indicated that Negroes in the District of Columbia received    
the colonization proposal with hostility. A Negro meeting held at Union Bethel Church was    
reported in the Baltimore <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> on August 23 as protesting against the plan: "Such    
dissatisfaction had been manifested in regard to the course of the committee who lately waited on    
the president . . . that they did not attend. It was hinted that they had exceeded their    
instructions."</p>    
<p>Plans were fully matured in August, however, to send Senator Samuel C. Pomeroy with "500    
able-bodied negroes as the first colony"to be settled on a site on the Isthmus of Chiriqui to    
be selected by Pomeroy (New York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>, September 15, 1862). A letter of authority    
from Lincoln to Pomeroy was prepared for Lincoln's signature, probably by the State Department,    
under date of September 10, 1862, but remains unsigned in duplicate copies in the Lincoln Papers.    
The project was abandoned when first Honduras and later Nicaragua and Costa Rica protested the    
scheme and hinted that force might be used to prevent the settlement.</p></note>

<opener>Hon. Geo. P. Fisher Executive Mansion<lb/>    
My dear Sir. Washington, Aug. 16. 1862</opener>    
<p>I was painfully surprised by your letter, handed me by the P.M.G.; because the Secretary of    
War, who saw you after I did, had assured me, that you and accompanying friends, were fully    
satisfied with what he had undertaken to do. Since receiving your letter, I have seen him again,    
and he again assures me that such was his understanding. I went over your eight points with him    
to see which he accepted, and which he rejected.</p>    
<p>He rejects that about postponing drafting till the 15th. of September.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about the 3rd. Delaware Regiment.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about Col. Grimshaw's Regiment.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about the battery of Artillery, if it be the battery heretofore    
authorized.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about the Battalion of Cavalry.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about forces remaining in the State.</p>    
<p>He rejects that about drafting being made under the Marshal of the District. He thinks he    
could not be justified to thus snub the Governor who is apparently doing right, but he will at    
once check anything which may be apparently wrong.</p>    
<p>He accepts that about appointing officers by the War Department---unless some serious, and now    
unforeseen obstacle shall be presented.</p>    
<p>I do hope you will be able to get along upon this. The Secretary feels very sure that Judge    
Gilpin<ref target="n5-378-2">2</ref>    
 thinks you can. I mean this as a private letter, but I am    
quite willing for you to show it to Judge Gilpin.</p>    
<p>I do hope you will not indulge a thought which will admit of your saying the administration    
turns you over to the fury of your enemies.</p>    
<p>You certainly know I wish your success as much as you can wish it yourself. Your friend, as    
ever A. LINCOLN</p>

<note id="n5-378-1"><p>1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. On August 13 the Delaware    
delegation interviewed Lincoln in regard to drafting in that state. Fisher's letter of August 14    
reads as follows:</p><p>"You requested our delegation from Delaware, that before leaving this    
city, they would submit to you in writing the desires of our friends in that state    
<pb n="379"/>    
    
respecting the calls for troops. All of them except myself have left, but before leaving they    
desired me to express to you our views, which are as follows.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">1st</hi> That the time for drafting may be extended till the 15th day of September.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">2d</hi> That the 3d Delaware Regiment (now in the field) which was over and above the    
quota which we were called upon to furnish, prior to the recent calls may be set down to the    
credit of the state, as part of the quota required of her under the call for 300,000 additional    
Volunteers.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">3d</hi> That Col. [Arthur H.] Grimshaw may have till the 15th day of September to fill    
up the 4th Delaware Regiment and that it also be credited as above.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">4th</hi> That the battery of Artillery now just made up by Capt Ben. Nields [Shields?]    
also be so credited.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">5th</hi> That the Battallion of Cavalry, for the raising of which an order was yesterday    
issued to N. B. Knight Esq, when raised may be credited as above if necessary to make up the    
quota of additional volunteers; or if not so necessary there [then?] that it be set off against    
an equal number of militia called for under the recent orders.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">6th</hi> That none of the troops now being organized or hereafter to be raised shall be    
removed from the State of Delaware until after the election to be held on the 4th day of Novr.    
next. Let them be placed in a camp of instruction under Genl. Lockwood . . . ; or if the new    
levies shall be removed from the state that they and the three Regts. now in the field may be    
allowed to return home to vote.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">7th</hi> That the drafting be made under the Marshall of the district &amp; not by    
Comrs. &amp;c. appointed by the Governor.</p>    
<p>"<hi rend="italic">8th</hi> That the officers of the Vols. &amp; militia will be appointed by the War Dept.    
&amp; not by the Governor.</p>    
<p>"I deem it my duty to say that. . . . We have but 16,000 voters in the state all told; and of    
them we have sent already 2,000 men into the field. . . . The present arrangement will diminish    
our strength from 500 to 1000 votes. Two years ago I had only a <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi> of 247 votes.

August 6, 1880, along with a copy of a letter from Attorney General Bates, August 20,    
1862:</p><p>"I have now to thank you for your able and patriotic address of the 5th instant to

interview with the president had written him on August 14 a very long letter reading in part as    
follows:</p>    
<p>"I am just informed, that at a public dinner . . . in a Washington Hotel, a gentleman . . .    
stated, that the President had said `a lady demanded fifty thousand dollars, for writing a    
document,' &amp;c; meaning myself. . . . I saw . . . that you did not comprehend me . . . at the    
time of my interview. . . . It is due to myself . . . that I make this statement plain.</p>    
<p>"I had a verbal agreement, with Hon Thos. A. Scott . . . to write in defense of the War    
Policy. . . .</p>    
<p>"For the writing and circulating of the copies, accepted, under this agreement, there was no    
question; as I knew the Government was legally bound, to pay me, its just value.</p>    
<p>"But for the circulation of all my documents, that I had written under this agreement, and    
for what I might write . . . I was advised . . . to bring the matter before you. . . .</p>    
<p>"I was also advised . . . that the Government should circulate . . . the `Reply to    
Breckinridge' `The War Powers of the Government.' `The Relations of the Government to the    
Revolted Citizens' &amp;c, &amp;c,. . . .</p>    
<p>"They all understood, that the amount suggested, was to be used in the circulation of my    
documents . . . and to write and publish in Europe . . . and they deemed it a very reasonable    
sum. . . .</p>    
<p>"When you said to me, that my proposition, [`] was the most outrageous one, ever made to any    
government, upon earth,' I remarked, that, the difference between us, was in our views, upon the    
value of intellectual laber. . . . If the estimate placed upon my writings, be too high, the    
error is not mine. . . ."(DLC-RTL). See also Sydney Greenbie and Marjorie Barstow Greenbie,

Surgeon Joshua Bradford of Ky is offered the Command of a Regt. of 3 years Infy. His great    
popularity &amp; worth; his tried courage and his devotion to the Cause impels me to ask in his    
favor a modification of general orders."Robinson, speaker of the Kentucky House of

1862. No reply by Stanton to this telegram has been found, and there is no record of Joshua T.    
Bradford's appointment as brigadier general. Bradford had fought a desperate battle with his

Dear Sir Washington, August 22, 1862.</opener>    
<p>I have just read yours of the 19th. addressed to myself through the New-York Tribune. If there    
be in it any statements, or assumptions of fact, which I may know to be erroneous, I do not, now    
and here, controvert them. If there be in it any inferences which I may believe to be falsely

dictatorial tone, I waive it in deference to an old friend, whose heart I have always supposed to    
be right.</p>    
<p>As to the policy I "seem to be pursuing"as you say, I have not meant to leave any one in    
doubt.</p>    
<p>I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner    
the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be "the Union as it was."<ref target="n5-388-2">2</ref>    
 If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the    
same time <hi rend="italic">save</hi> slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save    
the Union unless they could at the same time <hi rend="italic">destroy</hi> slavery, I do not agree with them.    
My paramount object in this struggle <hi rend="italic">is</hi> to save the Union, and is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> either to    
save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing <hi rend="italic">any</hi> slave I would    
do it, and if I could save it by freeing <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the slaves I would do it; and if I could    
save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery,    
and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I    
forbear because I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do    
<hi rend="italic">less</hi> whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do    
<hi rend="italic">more</hi> whenever</p>    
<p>

I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be    
errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.</p>

preposterous and futile. . . . IX. I close as I began with the statement that what an immense

Illinois may be behind in getting her troops into the field because you have sent your paymasters

<p>Yours denying that you have rejected the service of an officer sent you by us, is received. Of    
course I do not question your word; and yet what I said was based upon direct evidence; and I the

to Illinois and the State government there. I certainly can not conceive what it was I said which    
can be construed as injustice to Illinois. I knew by your despatches that Ills. had raised an    
unexpectedly large number of troops, and my impatience was that <hi rend="italic">none</hi> of them could be

sent two identical telegrams, since there are three telegrams which may be considered as replies.    
The first is dated at 11 A.M., "Firing this morning is heard in direction of Centreville. I have    
sent out four trains. . . . The intelligence last evening was that Hooker and Pope were pushing    
the enemy toward the gap in the mountains through which they had advanced, and that McDowell and    
Sigel were heading    
<pb n="401"/>

impossible that the enemy's forces may be changing direction and trying to escape toward    
Fredericksburg. . . . I await intelligence . . . and will communicate anything of importance that    
I hear."(OR, I, XII, III, 762). The second is dated as sent at 11:30 A.M., received at 11:35    
A.M., "Our opr. has reached Manassas. Hears no firing of importance. I have directed part of the    
200 Riflemen to go out as Scouts make observations &amp; report constantly. 2 of [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] 3    
flashes just seen from Manassas in direction of Centreville. Our Expedition this A M appears to    
have [been] completely successful We have re-established teleg communication with Manassas &amp;    
if protected will even have cars running but the Military authorities heretofore have never    
extended to us the protection that was necessary &amp; we have assumed the responsibility of    
going ahead without it. Our telegraph operators &amp; Railway Employees are entitled to great    
credit. They have been advance "pioneers"occupying the posts of danger &amp; the Exploit of    
penetrating to Fairfax &amp; Bringing off the wounded when they supposed twenty thousand Rebels    
were in their front &amp; flank was one of the boldest performances I have heard of."(DLC-RTL).    
The third is dated as received at 11:50 A.M., "One of our men who is just in left Bristoe    
yesterday noon says our men had nearly finished repairing Kettle-Run Bridge A large number of    
cars with four Engines were the other side of Kettle-Run Bridge ready to come over as soon as    
possible One of the Engines, the one in advance had 12 cars of ammunition &amp; more behind After    
the completion of Kettle Run the Trains can advance to Bristoe They are probably there now This    
intelligence is extremely gratifying I learn too that Broad Run Bridge has been attempted to be    
destroyed by cutting off the legs of all the trestles They could not have done mischief in a way    
that would render it more easy &amp; Expeditious for us to repair Very few hours should make    
Broad Run passable &amp; then Bull Run will remain the only obstacle."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

"Nelson has been badly beaten, I fear, in an encounter with the enemy near Richmond, Ky.; his    
force being, as he says, hopelessly broken and scattered. He is in Lexington, Ky., wounded, and I    
leave for that place in a couple of hours to see what can be done. He gives me no particulars. My    
orders were to make the Kentucky River the line of defense, and his orders in pursuance seem to    
have been disregarded. At any rate his force has been routed."(OR, I, XVI, II, 464). To    
Lincoln's telegram Boyle answered: "I am not accurately informed of the force Gen Nelson had in    
the Engagement but believe that he had seven or eight thousand men all of them new lev[i]es    
except eighteenth Ky. His force may have been greater. The Enemys force estimated at fifteen to    
twenty thousand Morgan has moved from Glasgow in direction of Lebanon. Col Bruce, at Bowling

[30?], 1862, is given to the meditation by Nicolay and Hay in the <hi rend="italic">Complete Works</hi> (VIII,    
52). According to their account, however, the fragment was written "in September, 1862, while    
his mind was burdened with the weightiest question of his life. . . . It was not written to be    
seen of men. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Abraham Lincoln: A History</hi>, VI, 341-42). If this comment means    
anything, September 30 is too late for the meditation. The "weightiest question"must be    
understood to refer to the issuing of the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22,    
and it is evident that Lincoln's mind was made up on this question some time before the    
proclamation was actually issued. Quite possibly the meditation was written as early as September    
2, at which time, following the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lincoln seems to have plumbed his    
lowest depths, and was reported by Attorney General Bates to have "seemed wrung by the bitterest    
anguish---said he felt almost ready to hang himself."(See note to Lincoln's order to Halleck    
dismissing McClellan, November 5, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>). In choosing an approximate date of September    
2, rather than September 30, the editors have been prompted by these considerations of    
milieu.</p></note>

the other Side. We shall know the truth of this rumor soon. Pleasanton is watching all the fords    
as high as Conrad's ferry &amp; has pickets out to the mouth of the Monocacy He has sent out this    
morning to occupy Sugar Loaf Mountain from which a large extent of country can be seen in all

miles of New Market. No Enemy seen with the exception of a few pickets. They were told that    
Stuart's Cavalry 5000 in number occupied New Market &amp; that the main Rebel force under Jackson    
was still at Frederick. Burnside has sent a strong reconnaissance today to the mountain pass at    
Ridgeville I propose if the information I have rec'd proves reliable regarding the natural    
strength of this position to occupy it with a sufficient force to resist an advance of the Enemy

of the Enemy's troops have crossed the Potomac within the last 24 hours below the mouth of the    
Monocacy. I was informed last night by Genl Pleasanton that his information rendered it probable    
that Jackson's forces had advanced to New Market with Stuart's Cavalry at Urbana. In view of this    
I ordered the army forward this morning to the line along the high ridge from Ridgeville through    
Damascus[,] Clarksburg &amp;c but the information subsequently obtained from Genl Burnside's    
Scouts that the mass of the Enemy was still at Frederick induced me to suspend the movement of    
the right wing until I could verify the truth of the reports by means of Burnside's    
reconnaissance in force today. My extreme left advances to Poolesville this morning. The work of    
reorganization &amp; re-fitting is progressing very satisfactorily with the new heads of staff    
Dept's. Dispatch this instant rec'd from Genl Pleasanton dated Barnesville 10.30 a.m. says `My    
Scouts occupy the ferry at the mouth of the Monocacy They found no Enemy except a few pickets on    
the other side of the Monocacy at Licksville. About 3 miles from that Stream it was reported    
there was a force of 6,000 men."' (DLC-RTL).</p></note>

Governor of Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.,<lb/>    
Harrisburg, Pa.: September 11, 1862.</opener>    
<p>Sir: The application made to me by your adjutant-general for authority to call out the militia    
of the State of Pennsylvania has received careful consideration. It is my anxious desire to    
afford, as far as possible, the means and powers of the Federal Government to protect the State    
of Pennsylvania from invasion by the rebel forces, and since, in your judgment, the militia of    
the State are required, and have been called upon by you, to organize for home defense and    
protection, I sanction the call that you have made, and will receive them into the service and    
pay of the United States to the extent that they can be armed, equipped, and usefully employed.    
The arms and equipments now belonging to the General Government will be needed for the troops    
called out for the national armies, so that arms can only be furnished for the quota of militia    
furnished by the draft of nine-months' men, heretofore ordered. But as arms may be supplied by    
the militia under your call, these, with the 30,000 in your arsenal, will probably be sufficient    
for the purpose contemplated by your call. You will be authorized to provide such equipments as    
may be required, according to the regulations of the United States service, which, upon being    
turned over to the United States Quartermaster's Department, will be paid    
<pb n="415"/>    
    
for at regulation prices, or the rates allowed by the department for such articles. Railroad    
transportation will also be paid for, as in other cases. Such general officers will be supplied    
as the exigencies of the service will permit. Yours, truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

thought mine to be but I can know facts as well as the ablest military man. There are many    
reports Deserters from Buckner report him with ten thousand 10000 men near Tompkinsville. Bragg    
reported at Burkesville and Columbia advancing into the centre of the State. I do not believe any

<pb n="420"/>    
    
by religious men, who are equally certain that they represent the Divine will. I am sure that    
either the one or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps in some respects both.    
I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that if it is probable that God would reveal his    
will to others, on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed he would reveal it    
directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest desire    
to know the will of Providence in this matter. <hi rend="italic">And if I can learn what it is I will do    
it!</hi> These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am    
not to expect a direct revelation. I must study the plain physical facts of the case, ascertain    
what is possible and learn what appears to be wise and right. The subject is difficult, and good    
men do not agree. For instance, the other day four gentlemen of standing and intelligence (naming    
one or two of the number) from New York called, as a delegation, on business connected with the    
war; but, before leaving, two of them earnestly beset me to proclaim general emancipation, upon    
which the other two at once attacked them! You know, also, that the last session of Congress had    
a decided majority of anti-slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy. And the same is    
true of the religious people. Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more    
earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting God to favor their side; for one of our    
soldiers, who had been taken prisoner, told Senator Wilson, a few days since, that he met with    
nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers. But we    
will talk over the merits of the case.</p>    
<p>"What <hi rend="italic">good</hi> would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially as we are now    
situated? I do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be    
inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet! Would <hi rend="italic">my word</hi> free the slaves, when    
I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the rebel States? Is there a single court, or    
magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there? And what reason is there to think    
it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved,    
and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines?    
Yet I cannot learn that that law has caused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they    
could be induced by a proclamation of freedom from me to throw themselves upon us, <hi rend="italic">what    
should we do with them?</hi> How can we feed and care for such a multitude? Gen. Butler wrote me    
a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to    
all the white    
<pb n="421"/>    
    
troops under his command. They <hi rend="italic">eat</hi>, and that is all, though it is true Gen. Butler is    
feeding the whites also by the thousand; for it nearly amounts to a famine there. If, now, the    
pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what    
is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again; for I am told that whenever    
the rebels take any black prisoners, free or slave, they immediately auction them off! They did    
so with those they took from a boat that was aground in the Tennessee river a few days ago. And    
then <hi rend="italic">I am very ungenerously attacked for it</hi>! For instance, when, after the late battles    
at and near Bull Run, an expedition went out from Washington under a flag of truce to bury the    
dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help and sent    
them into slavery, Horace Greeley said in his paper that the Government would probably do nothing    
about it. What <hi rend="italic">could</hi> I do? [Here your delegation suggested that this was a gross outrage    
on a flag of truce, which covers and protects all over which it waves, and that whatever he could    
do if <hi rend="italic">white</hi> men had been similarly detained he <hi rend="italic">could</hi> do in this case.]</p>    
<p>"Now, then, tell me, if you please, what possible result of good would follow the issuing of    
such a proclamation as you desire? Understand, I raise no objections against it on legal or    
constitutional grounds; for, as commander-in-chief of the army and navy, in time of war, I    
suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best subdue the enemy. Nor do I urge    
objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of insurrection and massacre at    
the South. I view the matter as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the    
advantages or disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion."</p>    
<p>Thus invited, your delegation very willingly made reply to the following effect; it being    
understood that a portion of the remarks were intermingled by the way of conversation with those    
of the President just given.</p>    
<p>We observed (taking up the President's ideas in order) that good men indeed differed in their    
opinions on this subject; nevertheless <hi rend="italic">the truth was somewhere</hi>, and it was a matter of    
solemn moment for him to ascertain it; that we had not been so wanting in respect, alike to    
ourselves and to him, as to come a thousand miles to bring merely <hi rend="italic">our opinion</hi> to be set    
over against the <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi> of other parties; that the memorial contained facts,    
principles, and arguments which appealed to the intelligence of the President and to his faith in    
Divine Providence; that he could not deny that the Bible denounced oppression as one of the    
highest of crimes, and    
<pb n="422"/>    
    
threatened Divine judgments against nations that practice it; that our country had been    
exceedingly guilty in this respect, both at the North and South; that our just punishment has    
come by a slaveholder's rebellion; that the virus of secession is found wherever the virus of    
slavery extends, and no farther; so that there is the amplest reason for expecting to avert    
Divine judgments by putting away the sin, and for hoping to remedy the national troubles by    
striking at their cause.</p>    
<p>We observed, further, that we freely admitted the probability, and even the certainty, that    
God would reveal the path of duty to the President as well as to others, provided he sought to    
learn it in the appointed way; but, as according to his own remark, Providence wrought by means    
and not miraculously, it might be, God would use the suggestions and arguments of other minds to    
secure that result. We felt the deepest personal interest in the matter as of national concern,    
and would fain aid the thoughts of our President by communicating the convictions of the    
Christian community from which we came, with the ground upon which they were based.</p>    
<p>That it was true he could not now enforce the Constitution at the South; but we could see in    
that fact no reason whatever for not proclaiming emancipation, but rather the contrary. The two    
appealed to different classes; the latter would aid, and in truth was necessary to re-establish    
the former; and the two could be made operative together as fast as our armies fought their way    
southward; while we had yet to hear that he proposed to abandon the Constitution because of the    
present difficulty of enforcing it.</p>    
<p>As to the inability of Congress to agree on this policy at the late session, it was quite    
possible, in view of subsequent events, there might be more unanimity at another meeting. The    
members have met their constituents and learned of marvellous conversions to the wisdom of    
emancipation, especially since late reverses have awakened thought as to the extreme peril of the    
nation, and made bad men as well as good men realize that we have to deal with God in this    
matter. Men of the most opposite previous views were now uniting in calling for this measure.</p>    
<p>That to proclaim emancipation would secure the sympathy of Europe and the whole civilized    
world, which now saw no other reason for the strife than national pride and ambition, an    
unwillingness to abridge our domain and power. No other step would be so potent to prevent    
foreign intervention.</p>    
<p>Furthermore, it would send a thrill through the entire North, firing every patriotic heart,    
giving the people a glorious principle    
<pb n="423"/>    
    
for which to suffer and to fight, and assuring them that the work was to be so thoroughly done as    
to leave our country free forever from danger and disgrace in this quarter.</p>    
<p>We added, that when the proclamation should become widely known (as the law of Congress has    
<hi rend="italic">not</hi> been) it would withdraw the slaves from the rebels, leaving them without laborers,    
and giving us <hi rend="italic">both laborers and soldiers</hi>. That the difficulty experienced by Gen. Butler    
and other Generals arose from the fact that <hi rend="italic">half-way measures could never avail</hi>. It is    
the inherent vice of half-way measures that they create as many difficulties as they remove. It    
is folly merely to receive and feed the slaves. They should be welcomed and fed, and then,    
according to Paul's doctrine, that they who eat must work, be made to labor and to fight for    
their liberty and ours. With such a policy the blacks would be no incumbrance and their rations    
no waste. In this respect we should follow the ancient maxim, and learn of the enemy. What the    
rebels most fear is what we should be most prompt to do; and what they most fear is evident from    
the hot haste with which, on the first day of the present session of the Rebel Congress, bills    
were introduced threatening terrible vengeance if we used the blacks in the war.</p>    
<p>The President rejoined from time to time in about these terms:</p>    
<p>"I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion, or at least its <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>.    
The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but they would have been impotent    
without slavery as their instrument. I will also concede that emancipation would help us in    
Europe, and convince them that we are incited by something more than ambition. I grant further    
that it would help <hi rend="italic">somewhat</hi> at the North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those    
you represent imagine. Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the war. And    
then unquestionably it would weaken the rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is of great    
importance. But I am not so sure we could do much with the blacks. If we were to arm them, I fear    
that in a few weeks the arms would be in the hands of the rebels; and indeed thus far we have not    
had arms enough to equip our white troops. I will mention another thing, though it meet only your    
scorn and contempt: There are fifty thousand bayonets in the Union armies from the Border Slave    
States. It would be a serious matter if, in consequence of a proclamation such as you desire,    
they should go over to the rebels. I do not think they all would---not so many indeed as a year    
ago, or as six months ago---not so many to-day as yesterday. Every day increases their Union    
feeling. They are also getting their pride enlisted, and want to beat the rebels. Let me say one    
thing more: I    
<pb n="424"/>    
    
think you should admit that we already have an important principle to rally and unite the people    
in the fact that constitutional government is at stake. This is a fundamental idea, going down    
about as deep as any thing."</p>    
<p>We answered that, being fresh from the people, we were naturally more hopeful than himself as    
to the necessity and probable effect of such a proclamation. The value of constitutional    
government is indeed a grand idea for which to contend; but the people know that <hi rend="italic">nothing else    
has put constitutional government in danger but slavery</hi>; that the toleration of that    
aristocratic and despotic element among our free institutions was the inconsistency that had    
nearly wrought our ruin and caused free government to appear a failure before the world, and    
therefore the people demand emancipation to preserve and perpetuate constitutional government.    
Our idea would thus be found to go deeper than this, and to be armed with corresponding power.    
("Yes,"interrupted Mr. Lincoln, "that is the true ground of our difficulties.") That a    
proclamation of general emancipation, "giving Liberty and Union"as the national watch-word,    
would rouse the people and rally them to his support beyond any thing yet witnessed---appealing    
alike to conscience, sentiment, and hope. He must remember, too, that present manifestations are    
no idex of what would then take place. If the leader will but utter a trumpet call the nation    
will respond with patriotic ardor. No one can tell the power of the right word from the right man    
to develop the latent fire and enthusiasm of the masses. ("I know it,"exclaimed Mr. Lincoln.)    
That good sense must of course be exercised in drilling, arming, and using black as well as white    
troops to make them efficient; and that in a scarcity of arms it was at least worthy of inquiry    
whether it were not wise to place a portion of them in the hands of those nearest to the seat of    
the rebellion and able to strike the deadliest blow.</p>    
<p>That in case of a proclamation of emancipation we had no fear of serious injury from the    
desertion of Border State troops. The danger was greatly diminished, as the President had    
admitted. But let the desertions be what they might, the increased spirit of the North would    
replace them two to one. One State alone, if necessary, would compensate the loss, were the whole    
50,000 to join the enemy. The struggle has gone too far, and cost too much treasure and blood, to    
allow of a partial settlement. Let the line be drawn at the same time between freedom and    
slavery, and between loyalty and treason. The sooner we know who are our enemies the better.</p>    
<p>In bringing our interview to a close, after an hour of earnest and    
<pb n="425"/>    
    
frank discussion, of which the foregoing is a specimen, Mr. Lincoln remarked: "Do not    
misunderstand me, because I have mentioned these objections. They indicate the difficulties that    
have thus far prevented my action in some such way as you desire. I have not decided against a    
proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but hold the matter under advisement. And I can assure you    
that the subject is on my mind, by day and night, more than any other. Whatever shall appear to    
be God's will I will do. I trust that, in the freedom with which I have canvassed your views, I    
have not in any respect injured your feelings."</p>

Wool telegraphs that including those from Harper's Ferry, there are now twenty thousand at    
Anapolis, requiring four good unparoled regiments to guard them. This should not be endured    
beyond the earliest moment possible to change it. Arm them and send them away just as fast as the    
Railroads will carry them. Each regiment arriving on the frontier will relieve a new regiment to

Benton Barracks, Saint Louis. We need a well-drilled force . . . to resist the over-whelming    
force of Indians now attacking our frontier settlements. Cannot you order the Third Regiment to    
report at once to me . . .? This service would not be a violation of their parole. . . ."(OR,    
II, IV, 417).</p><p>On September 9, Governor David Tod pursued the question further, "If the    
Indian troubles in Minnesota are serious and the paroled Union prisoners are not soon to be    
exchanged would it not be well to send them to Minnesota? It is with great difficulty we can    
preserve order among them at Camp Chase."(OR, II, IV, 499).</p>

Indian borders is excellent and will be immediately acted upon."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>).</p>

Indians would seem to be contrary to the fourth article of the cartel."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p.    
621). The terms of parole specified that paroled Union troops were to be kept in Union camps as    
non-combatants until they were exchanged for Confederate prisoners. Insubordination and mutiny    
among parolees at both Camp Chase and Camp Douglas, as well as the need for troops in Minnesota,    
prompted the project, but no reference has been found to the actual service of any of the paroled    
regiments in Minnesota, excepting a portion of the Third Minnesota, as first requested by

The autograph proclamation in the New York State Library was presented by Lincoln to the Albany    
Army Relief Bazaar held in February and March, 1864, where it was purchased by Gerrit Smith for    
$1,100 and given to the U.S. Sanitary Commission, whence it was purchased again for $1,000 in    
April, 1865, by the State of New York for the State Library. A letter of transmittal from    
Frederick W. Seward to Mrs. Emily W. Barnes, January 4, 1864, correctly describes the body of the    
document as being in Lincoln's own handwriting, the pencilled additions in the hand of the    
Secretary of State, and the formal beginning and ending, in the hand of the chief clerk."    
Seward's emendations as well as other peculiarities of the document are indicated in succeeding    
footnotes.</p><p>From Lincoln's original the engrossed copy in the National Archives was made and    
an official printing was issued by the State Department accompanied by a Circular from Secretary    
Seward to Diplomatic and Consular officers. A copy of this Circular printing is preserved in the    
Lincoln Papers bearing Lincoln's endorsement "Preliminary Proclamation from which a scrap was    
cut to paste onto the final one."The "scrap"cut away comprised paragraphs three and four of    
the Preliminary Proclamation, incorporated as paragraphs two and three of the Final Proclamation    
January 1, 1863, <hi rend="italic">infra</hi>.</p>    
<p>The purported facsimile of the original document which appears in Whitney, <hi rend="italic">Life on the    
Circuit with Lincoln</hi>, and which has been referred to as a forgery (Charles Eberstadt,    
"Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation,"<hi rend="italic">The New Colophon</hi>, 1950, pp. 312-56), is not    
reliable in detail, but appears to have been made from the original by a tracing process rather    
than by photography, and presents the passages which appear in the original as clippings from the    
official printings of the acts referred to, in type face and line length which do not correspond    
to the clippings themselves.</p>    
<p>The history of the original document, prior to the cabinet meeting on September 22 at which    
Lincoln presented it, is somewhat obscure, except for the notation in Hay's <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> on    
September 23 that "The President rewrote the Proclamation on Sunday morning carefully."This    
may be interpreted to mean that Lincoln rewrote directly from the draft of July 22    
(<hi rend="italic">supra</hi>), or that he rewrote from an intervening draft in more or less complete form. If    
the latter possibility is the case, the intervening draft has not been found. Later accounts of    
the writing of the Preliminary Proclamation are reminiscent and unreliable in detail (see George    
S. Boutwell, <hi rend="italic">The Lawyer, the Statesman, and the Soldier</hi>, 1887, pp. 116-17). The full    
reports of the cabinet meeting on September 22 as recorded in the diaries of Chase and Welles are    
too long for reproduction here, but should be consulted by anyone interested in the reaction of    
the several members to Lincoln's announcement that he had made up his mind to issue the    
Proclamation forthwith.</p></note>

before us we are inclined to believe that many of the haps and mishaps of the nation, during this

feet of our leaders. . . ."The writer further pointed out that "The President has been greatly

down firmly when he was troubled with corns?"</p></note>

me, and to thank you for it. I have not been distinctly informed why it is this occasion you    
appear to do me this honor, though I suppose [interruptions] it is because of the proclamation.

deliberation, and under a very heavy and solemn sense of responsibility. [Cries of "Good,"    
"Good,""Bless you,"and applause.]</p>    
<p>I can only trust in God I have made no mistake. [Cries "No mistake---all right; you've made    
no mistakes yet. Go ahead, you're right."] I shall make no attempt on this occasion to sustain    
what I have done or said by any comment. [Voices---"That's unnecessary; we understand it."] It    
is now for the country and the world to pass judgment on it, and, may be, take action upon it. I    
will say no more upon this subject. In my position I am environed with difficulties. [A voice---    
"That's so."]</p>    
<p>Yet they are scarcely so great as the difficulties of those who, upon the battle field, are    
endeavoring to purchase with their blood and their lives the future happiness and prosperity of    
this country. [Applause, long and continued.] Let us never forget them. On the 14th and 17th days    
of the present month there have been battles bravely, skillfully and successfully fought.    
[Applause.] We do not yet know the particulars. Let us be sure that in giving praise to    
particular individuals, we do no injustice to others. I only ask you, at the conclusion of these

claiming my constant attention I have been unable to examine and determine the exact treaty    
relations between the United States and the Cherokee Nation. Neither have I been able to

treaty obligation on our part, excusing the Cherokee Nation for making a treaty with a portion of    
the people of the United States in open rebellion against the government thereof. This letter    
therefore, must not be understood to decide anything upon these questions. I shall, however,    
cause a careful investigation of them to be made. Meanwhile the Cherokee people remaining    
practically loyal to the federal Union will receive all the protection which can be given them    
consistently with the duty of the government to the whole country.<ref target="n5-439-2">2</ref>

<p>We have reason to believe that the following is an exact copy of the record upon which Major    
John J. Key was dismissed from the military service of the United States.</p>    
<p>Executive Mansion</p>    
<p>Major John J. Key Washington, Sept. 26. 1862.</p>    
<p>Sir: I am informed that in answer to the question "Why was not the rebel army bagged    
immediately after the battle near Sharpsburg?"propounded to you by Major Levi C. Turner, Judge    
Advocate &amp;c. you answered "That is not the game""The object is that neither army shall    
get much advantage of the other; that both shall be kept in the field till they are exhausted,    
when we will make a compromise and save slavery."</p>    
<p>I shall be very happy if you will, within twentyfour hours from the receipt of this, prove to    
me by Major Turner, that you did not, either litterally, or in substance, make the answer stated.    
Yours, A. LINCOLN</p>    
<p>(Indorsed as follows)</p>    
<p>"Copy delivered to Major Key at 10.25 A.M. September 27th. 1862.</p>    
<p>JOHN HAY."</p>    
<p>At about 11 o'clock, A.M. Sept. 27. 1862. Major Key and Major Turner appear before me. Major    
Turner says: "As I remember it, the conversation was, I asked the question why we did not bag    
them after the battle at Sharpsburg? Major Key's reply was that was not the game, that we should    
tire the rebels out, and ourselves, that that was the only way the Union could be preserved, we    
come together fraternally, and slavery be saved"</p>    
<p>On cross-examination, Major Turner says he has frequently heard Major Key converse in regard    
to the present troubles, and never heard him utter a a [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] sentiment unfavorable to    
the maintainance of the Union. He has never uttered anything which he Major T. would call    
disloyalty. The particular conversation detailed was a private one A. LINCOLN.</p>    
<p>(Indorsed on the above)</p>    
<p>In my view it is wholly inadmissable for any gentleman holding a military commission from the    
United States to utter such sentiments as Major Key is within proved to have done. Therefore    
<pb n="443"/>    
    
let Major John J. Key be forthwith dismissed from the Military service of the United States. A    
LINCOLN.</p>    
<p>The foregoing is the whole record, except the simple order of dismissal at the War Department.    
At the interview of Major Key and Major Turner with the President, Major Key did not attempt to    
controvert the statement of Major Turner; but simply insisted, and sought to prove, that he was    
true to the Union. The substance of the President's reply was that if there was a "game"ever    
among Union men, to have our army not take an advantage of the enemy when it could, it was his    
object to break up that game.</p>

September 27, Major Key wrote Lincoln an explanation as follows:</p><p>". . . I have never

<p>"I have often remarked, that the Rebels would never let this contest be decided, if they

substance. An endorsement by Stanton immediately following that of Lincoln suggests the    
possibility that the letter concerned the advisability of evacuating the Capitol, which had been    
requisitioned by the War Department. Stanton's endorsement is as follows: "The Secretary of War    
respectfully reports etc. that the great number of wounded soldiers in the battles on the    
Rappahannock[,] Manassas &amp; Centreville made the occupation of the Capitol an absolute    
necessity and it was taken on the requisition of the Surgeon General for temporary purposes.

<p>My Dear Sir: Your kind letter of the 25th is just received. It is known to some that while I    
hope something from the proclamation, my expectations are not as sanguine as are those of some    
friends. The time for its effect southward has not come; but northward the effect should be    
instantaneous.</p>    
<p>It is six days old, and while commendation in newspapers and by distinguished individuals is    
all that a vain man could wish, the stocks have declined, and troops come forward more slowly    
than ever. This, looked soberly in the face, is not very satisfactory. We have fewer troops in    
the field at the end of six days than we had at the beginning---the attrition among the old    
outnumbering the addition by the new. The North responds to the proclamation sufficiently in    
breath; but breath alone kills no rebels.</p>    
<p>I wish I could write more cheerfully; nor do I thank you the less for the kindness of your    
letter. Yours very truly,</p>    
<p>A. LINCOLN.</p>

written on a letter from Salmon P. Chase, September 28, asking that a ward in the Capitol    
Hospital be assigned to Dr. S. W. Forsha to treat wounded soldiers with his "Balm."Dr. Forsha    
had been denied access to a wounded soldier who wished to try his remedy. Apparently the surgeon    
general did not act, for on December 17, Attorney General Bates endorsed a note from Forsha with    
the comment that "it is evident that <hi rend="italic">Dr. Forsha</hi> is not much of a scholar. But he    
certainly has great <hi rend="italic">curative</hi> powers; and really works wonders in relieving pain and    
healing wounds."Forsha's letter reads as follows: "If the President will give me the charge of    
a hospital or a ward in one to use my owne medisen in and up on the wounded Soldiers for three    
Months I will insure ninety percent of all the flesh wounds to be well and the Soldiers to be in    
a healthy condition and fit for duty within thirty days from the time I take them if I can have    
them within 8 or 10 days from    
<pb n="445"/>    
</p><p>the time they are wounded and I will only ask the same assistance that the other Surgeons    
are allowed. The Soldiers will not suffer the twentieth part as much as they do in the other    
hospitals and their general health shall not be impared from the Effects of the wounds."(DLC-    
RTL). A letter from Hammond to Lincoln, February 13, 1863, in reply to a communication from the    
president which has not been located, specified that "I have met with Dr. Forsha before, and am

Adelaide Mary Louisa, spouse of the Prince Royal of Prussia, Your Majesty's well-beloved    
daughter-in-law, had on the preceding day safely given birth to a Prince.</p>    
<p>I participate in the satisfaction which this happy event has afforded to Your Majesty and to    
Your Majesty's Royal Family, and offer my sincere congratulations upon the occasion.</p>    
<p>

May God have Your Majesty always in His safe and holy keeping! Your Good Friend, ABRAHAM    
LINCOLN.</p>    
<p>Washington, October 1, 1862.</p>

<p>General Stuart of the Rebel Army, has sent in a few of our prisoners under a flag of truce,    
paroled with terms to prevent their fighting the Indians, and evidently seeking to commit us to    
their right to parole our prisoners in that way. My inclination is to send the prisoners back    
with a distinct notice that we will recognize no parole given to our prisoners by the rebels, as    
extending beyond a prohibition against fighting them. Yet I wish your opinion upon it, based upon    
the general law and our cartel. I wish to avoid violations of law and bad faith. Answer as quick    
as possible, as the thing, if done at all, should be done at once. A. LINCOLN</p>

<note id="n5-449-2"><p>2 Copy, DLC-McClellan Papers. Concerning    
the Union troops paroled by Confederate General James E. B. Stuart, Halleck at first replied that    
he thought there was "nothing against"Lincoln's proposal (OR, II, IV, 593), but later on the    
same day he replied, "When I telegraphed you this morning I had only heard the cartel read by    
the Secretary of War. I have since examined the original document and withdraw my opinion. I am    
disposed to think the parole is made by the cartel to include all military duty."    
(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 593-94). On October 4, he concluded, "After full consultation with the    
Secretary of War and Colonel Holt it is concluded that the parole under the cartel does not    
prohibit doing service against the Indians."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., 598). But Attorney General Bates    
on October 18 gave his opinion that "The terms of the contract are . . . explicit . . . beyond a    
doubt. . . . It is the plainly declared purpose of the Cartel to prevent the use of prisoners    
paroled . . . in the discharge of any of the duties of a soldier. . . ."(DLC-RTL). See also the

enemy or drive him south. Your army must move now while the roads are good. If you cross the

enforced with 30,000 men. If you move up the Valley of the Shenandoah, not more than 12,000 or    
15,000 can be sent to you. The President advises the interior line between Washington and the    
enemy, but does not order it. He is very desirous that your army move as soon as possible. You    
will immediately report what line you adopt and when you intend to cross the river; also to what

<p>You <hi rend="italic">can not</hi> have reflected seriously when you ask that I shall order Gen. Morgan's

established by it would instantly break up the whole army. Buell's old troops now in pursuit of    
Bragg, have done more hard marching recently. And, in fact, if you include marching and fighting,    
there are scarcely any old troops East or West of the mountains that have not done as hard    
service.</p>    
<p>I sincerely wish war was an easier and pleasanter business than it is; but it does not admit

that he has been a very faithful friend to the Govt. in the present troubles. A. LINCOLN</p>

<note id="n5-455-1"><p>1 AES, IHi. Lincoln's endorsement appears    
on a letter from Benjamin F. Wade, September 30, 1862: "I have just returned from a six weeks    
residence about the head of Lake Superior. I have taken pains, to make myself acquainted with our    
relations with the Indians in that region and from all I can learn I fear that there is danger of    
trouble with the Chippeways as well as the Sioux. I know that the people there live under the    
greatest apprehension of an outbreak, and have no doubt that measures should be immediately taken    
to prevent it. What those measures should be, Mr [Henry B.] Whipple will be able to inform you,    
but my principal object in writing to you . . . is, to induce you, if possible to appoint Hon.    
Henry M. Rice, Major Genl. with full command of the Department now under command of Genl. Pope.    
And this I do without any disparagement of Genl. Pope, who I regard as one of our very best    
officers, but he has no acquaintance with the Indian character, or experience of their mode of    
warfare, without which, no man is competent to command against them. Now for God's sake, let us    
not in this Sioux war, repeat the blunders of Genl. Braddock in the French war, or of our    
Administration in the conduct of the Florida War. What we want is, a man thoroughly acquainted    
with the Indian character, who is acquainted with their method of warfare and who can speak their    
language. A man, who the Indians both fear and respect. Such a man is Henry M. Rice of Minnesota,    
he is also well acquainted with military affairs, having spent a large portion of his active life    
with the army, as well as among the Indians. From what I have seen, I know the Chippeway tribe    
have the fullest confidence in him, and the Sioux before the war had like confidence in him. From    
all I can learn the people who are exposed to Indian depredations, have more confidence in his    
ability to protect them than in any other man. Mr. Rice is brave, sagacious and vigilant and    
persevering beyond any man I know. I hope therefore you will appoint him at once and I will    
answer with my head for the result. Genl. Pope might in the meantime be assigned to a field more    
in accordance with his wishes and better adapted to his knowledge of the profession. . .

<p>The organization attempted by Mr. Boswell, makes a place for people in that region inclined    
our way, to go; and, in that respect is important. While it is proper that a corps of Northern    
men should not be raised, &amp; be called Mississippians, still I see no objection to    
Alabamian's, and even persons from other Southern states, found in Missi[ssi]ppi, joining in the    
organization. Suppose the Sec. of War modifies his order so as to admit of this; and also    
providing that when enough for a regiment are obtained they shall go into the service at once,    
not waiting for the completion of a Brigade---nevertheless Mr. Boswell proceeding to get the    
materials for a Brigade, if practicable. One man there is worth two here in this, that it adds    
one to us, and takes one from the enemy; and for which advantage we can afford to endure a little

the order signed by Lincoln on July 11, but in this case it is difficult to conjecture why Bates    
dated it "June 27"and later changed the date to "July 11."It is also possible that the    
"draft of an order"enclosed by Bates on September 23 was an undated draft of a letter which is    
preserved in the Lincoln Papers (No. 18528) immediately following Bates' letter of September 19    
rather than following the letter of September 23. If so, there is no evidence that the letter was

<p>"To Major General Curtis</p>    
<p>"Commanding Department of Missouri</p>    
<p>"General Many persons, including several Major Generals who have commanded in Missouri, have    
urged me to order the completion of the South West Branch of the Pacific Railroad to Lebanon.    
Nevertheless the burdens of the National Treasury are so enormous that I hesitate to make this    
order, and have concluded to refer the subject to you with the following instructions.</p>    
<p>"You will investigate the matter thoroughly, and in doing so, you will exclude all    
considerations of a local character and confine yourself to the point whether the completion of    
this road will decrease instead of increasing the national expenditures in the prosecution of the    
war and the maintainance of the supremacy of the Government in that section of the country.</p>    
<p>"Should you be well satisfied upon this point you will order the work to be done and the    
materials to be provided as expeditiously and as economically as possible, and for this purpose    
you are hereby authorized to appoint a Superintendant of the same; and to make such contracts as    
may be requisite therefor, and to make the proper requisitions upon the Quartermaster at St.

<opener>Major General McClellan Executive Mansion,<lb/>    
My dear Sir Washington, Oct. 13, 1862.</opener>    
<p>You remember my speaking to you of what I called your over-cautiousness. Are you not over-    
cautious when you assume that you can not do what the enemy is constantly doing? Should you not    
claim to be at least his equal in prowess, and act upon the claim?</p>    
<p>As I understand, you telegraph Gen. Halleck that you can not subsist your army at Winchester    
unless the Railroad from Harper's Ferry to that point be put in working order. But the enemy does    
now subsist his army at Winchester at a distance nearly twice as great from railroad    
transportation as you would have to do without the railroad last named. He now wagons from    
Culpepper C.H. which is just about twice as far as you would have to do from Harper's Ferry. He    
is certainly not more than half as well provided with wagons as you are. I certainly should be    
pleased for you to have the advantage of the Railroad from Harper's Ferry to Winchester, but it    
wastes all the remainder of autumn to give it to you; and, in fact ignores the question of    
<hi rend="italic">time</hi>, which can not, and must not be ignored.</p>    
<p>Again, one of the standard maxims of war, as you know, is "to operate upon the enemy's    
communications as much as possible without exposing your own."You seem to act as if this    
applies <hi rend="italic">against</hi> you, but can not apply in your <hi rend="italic">favor</hi>. Change positions with the    
enemy, and think you not he would break your communication with Richmond within the next    
twentyfour hours? You dread his going into Pennsylvania. But if he does so in full force, he    
gives up his communications to you absolutely, and you have nothing to do but to follow, and ruin    
him; if he does so with less than full force, fall upon, and beat what is left behind all the    
easier.</p>    
<p>Exclusive of the water line, you are now nearer Richmond than the enemy is by the route that    
you <hi rend="italic">can</hi>, and he <hi rend="italic">must</hi> take. Why can you not reach there before him, unless you    
admit that he is more than your equal on a march. His route is the arc of a circle, while yours    
is the chord. The roads are as good on yours as on his.</p>    
<p>You know I desired, but did not order, you to cross the Potomac below, instead of above the    
Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was that this would at once menace the enemies'    
communications, which I would seize if he would permit. If he should move Northward</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="461"/>    
I would follow him closely, holding his communications. If he should prevent our seizing his    
communications, and move towards Richmond, I would press closely to him, fight him if a favorable    
opportunity should present, and, at least, try to beat him to Richmond on the inside track. I say    
"try"; if we never try, we shall never succeed. If he make a stand at Winchester, moving    
neither North or South, I would fight him there, on the idea that if we can not beat him when he    
bears the wastage of coming to us, we never can when we bear the wastage of going to him. This    
proposition is a simple truth, and is too important to be lost sight of for a moment. In coming    
to us, he tenders us an advantage which we should not waive. We should not so operate as to    
merely drive him away. As we must beat him somewhere, or fail finally, we can do it, if at all,    
easier near to us, than far away. If we can not beat the enemy where he now is, we never can, he    
again being within the entrenchments of Richmond.</p>    
<p>Recurring to the idea of going to Richmond on the inside track, the facility of supplying from    
the side away from the enemy is remarkable---as it were, by the different spokes of a wheel    
extending from the hub towards the rim---and this whether you move directly by the chord, or on    
the inside arc, hugging the Blue Ridge more closely. The chord-line, as you see, carries you by    
Aldie, Hay-Market, and Fredericksburg; and you see how turn-pikes, railroads, and finally, the    
Potomac by Acquia Creek, meet you at all points from Washington. The same, only the lines    
lengthened a little, if you press closer to the Blue Ridge part of the way. The gaps through the    
Blue Ridge I understand to be about the following distances from Harper's Ferry, towit: Vestal's    
five miles; Gregorie's, thirteen, Snicker's eighteen, Ashby's, twenty-eight, Mannassas, thirty-    
eight, Chester fortyfive, and Thornton's fiftythree. I should think it preferable to take the    
route nearest the enemy, disabling him to make an important move without your knowledge, and    
compelling him to keep his forces together, for dread of you. The gaps would enable you to attack    
if you should wish. For a great part of the way, you would be practically between the enemy and    
both Washington and Richmond, enabling us to spare you the greatest number of troops from here.    
When at length, running for Richmond ahead of him enables him to move this way; if he does so,    
turn and attack him in rear. But I think he should be engaged long before such point is reached.    
It is all easy if our troops march as well as the enemy; and it is unmanly to say they can not do    
it.</p>

<note id="n5-460-1"><p>1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. On October 16, 8:30 A.M.,    
McClellan acknowledged Lincoln's letter "just received from Colonel [Delavan D.] Perkins. . . .    
I go to the front. . . . This may delay my reply."(OR, I, XIX, I, 16). On October 17, McClellan    
replied as follows:</p><p>"Your letter of the 13th . . . and reached me yesterday morning by the    
hands of Colonel Perkins.</p>    
<p>"I had sent out strong reconnaissances . . . and as sharp artillery fire was heard, I felt it    
incumbent to go to the front. I did not leave Charlestown until dark, so that I have been unable    
to give Your Excellency's letter that full and respectful consideration which it merits at my    
hands.</p>    
<p>"I do not wish to detain Colonel Perkins beyond this morning's train; I therefore think it    
best to send him back with this simple acknowledgment of the receipt of Your Excellency's letter.    
. . . I promise you that I will give to your views the fullest and most unprejudiced    
consideration, and that it is my intention to advance the moment my men are shod and my cavalry    
are sufficiently renovated to be available. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>.).</p>    
<p>No further reply has been found, but McClellan continued to delay and sought changes in the    
order of October 6 (see note, Lincoln to McClellan, October 7, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>). On October 21,    
Halleck telegraphed McClellan that the president "directs me to say that he has no change to    
make in his order of the 6th instant. If you have not been and are not now in condition to obey    
it, you will be able to show such want of ability. The President does not expect impossibilities,    
but he is very anxious that all this good weather should not be wasted in inactivity. Telegraph    
when you will move, and on what lines you propose to march."(OR, I, XIX, I, 81).</p></note>

These appointments are to continue during the pleasure of the President, not extending beyond the    
military occupation of the city of New Orleans or the restoration of the civil authority in that

<note id="n5-474-3"><p>3 ALS, IHi. Lincoln obviously misdated this    
telegram, since McClellan's dispatch to Halleck transmitting a report of Colonel Robert Williams    
of the First Massachusetts Cavalry was not received at the War Department until 12 M., October    
25. Williams reported as follows:</p><p>"I have in camp 267 horses . . . of these, 128 are    
positively and absolutely unable to leave the camp, from the following causes, viz, sore-tongue,    
grease, and consequent lameness, and sore backs . . . . The horses, which are still sound, are    
absolutely broken down from fatigue and want of flesh . . . ."(OR, I, XIX, II, 485-86).</p>    
<p>McClellan replied to Lincoln at 6 P.M. October 25, as follows:</p>    
<p>"In reply to your telegram of this date, I have the honor to state, from the time this army    
left Washington, on the 7th of September, my cavalry has been constantly employed in making    
reconnaissances, scouting, and picketing. Since the battle of Antietam, six regiments have made a    
trip of 200 miles, marching 55 miles in one day, while endeavoring to reach Stuart's cavalry.</p>    
<p>"General Pleasonton, in his official report, states that he, with the remainder of our    
available cavalry, while on Stuart's track, marched 78 miles in twenty-four hours.</p>    
<p>"Besides these two remarkable expeditions, our cavalry has been engaged in picketing and    
scouting 150 miles of river front ever since the battle of Antietam, and has made repeated    
reconnaissances since that time, engaging the enemy on every occasion, and, indeed, it has    
performed harder service since the battle than before. I beg that you will also consider that    
this same cavalry was brought from the Peninsula, where it encountered most laborious service,    
and was, at the commencement    
<pb n="475"/>    
    
of this campaign, in low condition, and from that time to the present has had no time to    
recruit.</p>    
<p>"If any instance can be found where overworked cavalry has performed more labor than mine    
since the battle of Antietam, I am not conscious of it."(OR, I, XIX, II, 485).</p></note>

pardon me for most respectfully differing with you in regard to the expression in your dispatch    
`Stuart's cavalry has done more marked service on the Peninsula and everywhere since.' I cannot

impression in regard to the service of our cavalry, for I know you would not intentionally do    
injustice to the excellent officers and men of which it is composed . . . .</p><p>"With the    
exception of the two raids by Stuart, I am unconscious of a single instance where the rebel    
cavalry has exhibited any superiority over ours. The fact that Stuart outmarched Pleasonton in    
his last raid is easily accounted for. It is said that he received a relay of fresh horses when    
he crossed the river at McCoy's Ferry. From that point he had extra lead horses to take the    
places of those that gave out on the road, besides which he stole some 1,000 horses in    
Pennsylvania, which contributed toward giving him another relay. Notwithstanding all this, he    
dropped a great many broken-down horses along the road. Pleasonton made his entire trip without a    
change of horses.</p>

been commenced; If I had been allowed my way this war would have been ended before this, but we

the whole to 7918 that the cavalry horses were too much fatiegued to move, presented a very

<p>The Army is constantly depleted by company officers who give their men leave of absence in the

this very moment there are between seventy and one hundred thousand men absent on furlough from

war is to be ended, the nation united, and peace restored, by <hi rend="italic">strategy</hi>, and not by hard

political figures and private citizens, as well as the majority of his cabinet. On August 30,    
Secretary Chase had drawn up a letter to the president which Secretaries Stanton and Smith joined    
him in signing, recommending "the immediate removal of George B. McClellan."(ORB). On    
September 2, a similar document was drafted by Secretary Bates "declaring to you our deliberate    
opinion that, at this time, it is not safe to entrust to Major General McClellan the command of    
any of the armies of the United States."(DLC-Stanton Papers). Stanton, Chase, Smith, and Bates    
signed this document, a copy of which is in the Nicolay Papers bearing the following note in    
Bates' handwriting:</p>    
<p>"Note. M. Blair p.m.g. declined to sign (no reason given that I heard, but preserving a    
cautious reticence)</p>    
<p>Gideon Welles, Secy Navy, declined to sign, for some reasons of etiquette, but openly declared    
in Council, his entire want of confidence in the general</p>    
<p>W.H. Seward, Sec of State, <hi rend="italic">absent</hi></p>    
<p>The Prest. was in deep distress. He had already, with, apparently, Gen Halleck's approbation,    
assigned Genl McClellan to the command of the forts in &amp; around Washington &amp; entrusted    
him with the defence of the City. At the opening of the Council, he seemed wrung by the bitterest    
anguish---said he felt almost ready to hang himself---in ansr to something said by Mr. Chase, he    
sd. he was far from doubting our sincerity, but that he was so distressed, precisely because he    
knew we were earnestly sincere.</p>    
<p>"He was, manifestly alarmed for the safety of the City. He had been talking with Gen Halleck    
(who, I think is cowed) &amp; had gotten the idea that Pope's army was utterly demoralized---    
saying that "if Pope's army came within the lines (of the forts) as <hi rend="italic">a mob</hi>, the City wd    
be overrun by the enemy in 48 hours!!"</p>    
<p>"I said that if Halleck doubted his ability to defend the City, he ought to be instantly,    
broke. 50,000 men were enough to defend it against all the power of the enemy. If the City fell,    
it would be by treachery in our leaders, &amp; not by lack of power to defend. The shame was that    
we were reduced to the defensive, instead of the aggressive policy &amp;c. That all the army was    
not needed to defend the City, &amp; now was the time, above all others, to strike the enemy    
behind &amp; at a distance &amp;c"</p></note>

No. 20. Alfred W. Ellet was a brother of Charles Ellet, inventor of the steam rams operating with    
Union forces on the Mississippi, who died June 21, of wounds received in a naval engagement off    
Memphis, Tennessee, on June 6, 1862. At a White House conference attended by Welles, Stanton, and    
Halleck on November 7, the question of the disposition of the fleet of rams was decided by    
Lincoln in accordance with a congressional order. Welles' <hi rend="italic">Diary</hi> summarizes the situation    
prior to the conference as follows: "Congress wisely ordered a transfer of all war vessels on    
the Mississippi to the Navy. . . . It has . . . greatly disturbed Stanton, who, supported by    
Halleck and Ellet, opposes a transfer of the ram fleet as not strictly within the letter . . . of    
the law. That Ellet should wish a distinct command is not surprising. It is characteristic. He is    
full of zeal to overflowing; is not, however, a naval man, but is, very naturally, delighted with    
an independent naval command in this adventurous ram service. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Diary of Gideon

commission at the Lower Sioux Agency, was received at 7:40 P.M., November 8. Governor Alexander    
Ramsey telegraphed Lincoln on November 10, "I hope the execution of every Sioux Indian condemned    
by the military court will be at once ordered. It would be wrong upon principle and policy to    
refuse this. Private revenge would on all this border take the place of official judgment on    
these Indians."(OR, I, XIII, 787). On November 11 Lincoln endorsed Ramsey's telegram    
"Respectfully referred to Secretary of War."</p><p>On November 11 Pope replied to Lincoln's    
message of November 10 as follows: "Your dispatch of yesterday received. Will comply with your    
wishes immediately. I desire to represent . . . that the only distinction between the culprits is    
as to which of them murdered most people or violated most young girls. All of them are guilty of    
these things in more or less degree. The people . . . are exasperated . . . and if the guilty are    
not all executed I think it nearly impossible to prevent the indiscriminate massacre of all the    
Indians---old men, women, and children. . . ."(<hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>,788).</p>    
<p>Succeeding telegrams from Pope on November 24 and Ramsey on November 28 (DLC-RTL) insisted on    
the necessity for speedy execution, but on November 28 in conference with Senator Morton S.    
Wilkinson and Representative Cyrus Aldrich, who pressed for immediate execution, Lincoln    
"promised to . . . make a final determination upon it after completing his [Annual] Message."

Gen. Schurz. Executive Mansion,<lb/>    
My dear Sir Washington, Nov. 10. 1862.</opener>    
<p>Yours of the 8th. was, to-day, read to me by Mrs. S[churz]. We have lost the elections; and it    
is natural that each of us will believe, and say, it has been because his peculiar views was not    
made sufficiently prominent. I think I know what it was, but I may be    
<pb n="494"/>    
    
mistaken. Three main causes told the whole story. 1. The democrats were left in a majority by our    
friends going to the war. 2. The democrats observed this &amp; determined to re-instate    
themselves in power, and 3. Our newspaper's, by vilifying and disparaging the administration,    
furnished them all the weapons to do it with. Certainly, the ill-success of the war had much to    
do with this.</p>    
<p>You give a different set of reasons. If you had not made the following statements, I should    
not have suspected them to be true. "The defeat of the administration is the administrations own    
fault."(opinion) "It admitted its professed opponents to its counsels"(Asserted as a fact)    
"It placed the Army, now a great power in this Republic, into the hands of its' enemys"    
(Asserted as a fact) "In all personal questions, to be hostile to the party of the Government,    
seemed, to be a title to consideration."(Asserted as a fact) "If to forget the great rule,    
that if you are true to your friends, your friends will be true to you, and that you make your    
enemies stronger by placing them upon an equality with your friends.""Is it surprising that    
the opponents of the administration should have got into their hands the government of the    
principal states, after they have had for a long time the principal management of the war, the    
great business of the national government."</p>    
<p>I can not dispute about the matter of opinion. On the the [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] three matters (stated    
as facts) I shall be glad to have your evidence upon them when I shall meet you. The plain facts,    
as they appear to me, are these. The administration came into power, very largely in a minority    
of the popular vote. Notwithstanding this, it distributed to it's party friends as nearly all the    
civil patronage as any administration ever did. The war came. The administration could not even    
start in this, without assistance outside of it's party. It was mere nonsense to suppose a    
minority could put down a majority in rebellion. Mr. Schurz (now Gen. Schurz) was about here then    
&amp; I do not recollect that he then considered all who were not republicans, were enemies of    
the government, and that none of them must be appointed to to [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>] military positions.    
He will correct me if I am mistaken. It so happened that very few of our friends had a military    
education or were of the profession of arms. It would have been a question whether the war should    
be conducted on military knowledge, or on political affinity, only that our own friends (I think    
Mr. Schurz included) seemed to think that such a question was inadmissable. Accordingly I have    
scarcely appointed a democrat to a command, who was not urged by many republicans and opposed by    
none. It was so as to McClellan. He    
<pb n="495"/>    
    
was first brought forward by the Republican Governor of Ohio, &amp; claimed, and contended for at    
the same time by the Republican Governor of Pennsylvania. I received recommendations from the    
republican delegations in congress, and I believe every one of them recommended a majority of    
democrats. But, after all many Republicans were appointed; and I mean no disparagement to them    
when I say I do not see that their superiority of success has been so marked as to throw great    
suspicion on the good faith of those who are not Republicans. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN</p>

<p>My dear Sir Your very patriotic and judicious letter, addressed to Judge Davis, in relation to    
the Mississippi, has been left with me by him for perusal. You do not estimate the value of the    
object you press, more highly than it is estimated here. It is now the object of particular    
attention. It has not been neglected, as you seem to think, because the West was divided into    
different military Departments. The cause is much deeper. The country will not allow us to send    
our whole Western force down the Mississippi, while the enemy sacks Louisville and Cincinnati.    
Possibly it would be better if the country would allow this, but it will not. I confidently    
believed, last September that we could end the war by allowing the enemy to go to Harrisburg and    
Philadelphia, only that we could not keep down mutiny, and utter demoralization among the    
Pennsylvanians. And this, though very unhandy sometimes, is not at all strange. I presume if an

respectable citizens of Louisiana, are willing to be members of congress &amp; to swear support    
to the constitution; and that other respectable citizens there are willing to vote for them and    
send them. To send a parcel of Northern men here, as representatives, elected as would be    
understood, (and perhaps really so,) at the point of the bayonet, would be disgusting and

On the 14th. of October I addressed a letter to Gen. Butler, yourself and others upon this very

<p>I wish elections for Congressmen to take place in Louisiana; but I wish it to be a movement of    
the people of the Districts, and not a movement of our military and quasi-military, authorities    
there. I merely wish our authorities to give the people a chance---to protect them against    
secession interference. Of course the election can not be according to strict law---by state law,    
there is, I suppose, no election day, before January; and the regular election officers will not    
act, in many cases, if in any. These knots must be cut, the main object being to get an    
expression of the people. If they would fix a day and a way, for themselves, all the better; but    
if they stand idle not seeming to know what to do, do you fix these things for them by    
proclamation. And do not waste a day about it; but, fix the election day early enough that we can    
hear the result here by the first of January. Fix a day for an election in all the Districts, and    
have it held in as many places as you can. Yours very truly A. LINCOLN</p>

My dear General Banks Washington, Nov. 22, 1862.</opener>    
<p>Early last week you left me in high hope with your assurance that you would be off with your    
expedition at the end of that week, or early in this. It is now the end of this, and I have just    
been overwhelmed and confounded with the sight of a requisition made by you, which, I am assured,    
can not be filled, and got off within an hour short of two months! I inclose you a copy of the    
requisition, in some hope that it is not genuine---that you have never seen it.</p>    
<p>My dear General, this expanding, and piling up of <hi rend="italic">impedimenta</hi>, has been, so far,    
almost our ruin, and will be our final ruin if it is not abandoned. If you had the articles of    
this requisition upon the    
<pb n="506"/>    
    
wharf, with the necessary animals to make them of any use, and forage for the animals, you could    
not get vessels together in two weeks to carry the whole, to say nothing of your twenty thousand    
men; and, having the vessels, you could not put the cargoes aboard in two weeks more. And, after    
all, where you are going, you have no use for them. When you parted with me, you had no such idea    
in your mind. I know you had not, or you could not have expected to be off so soon as you said.    
You must get back to something like the plan you had then, or your expedition is a failure before    
you start. You must be off before Congress meets. You would be better off any where, and    
especially where you are going, for not having a thousand wagons, doing nothing but hauling    
forage to feed the animals that draw them, and taking at least two thousand men to care for the    
wagons and animals, who otherwise might be two thousand good soldiers.</p>    
<p>Now dear General, do not think this is an ill-natured letter---it is the very reverse. The    
simple publication of this requisition would ruin you. Very truly your friend A. LINCOLN</p>

Lincoln's endorsement is written on a letter from Nathaniel P. Banks, November 19, 1862,    
requesting that Colonel Daniel Ullmann of the Seventy-eighth New York Regiment "with such    
Regiments as you may place under his command"be assigned to Banks' expedition bound for    
Louisiana. No record has been found of Ullmann's transfer at this time, but on March 25, 1863,    
Stanton notified Banks that Ullmann, who had been made a brigadier general as of January 13, had    
been "intrusted with authority"to raise "a large military force from the colored population

<p>You tell me you have in your hands some two hundred and seventy thousand dollars of    
"Confederate Scrip"which was forced upon Union men of Kentucky, in exchange for supplies, by    
the rebels during their late raid into that State; and you wish government authority for you to    
take this Scrip into the Cotten-States, exchange it for cotten if found practicable, and to bring    
the cotten out.</p>    
<p>While I have felt great anxiety to oblige you, and your friends, in this matter, I feel    
constrained to decline it. It would come to something, or it would come to nothing---that is, you    
would get cotten for the Scrip, or you would not. If you should get none, the effort would have    
been a useless failure. If you should get <hi rend="italic">any</hi>, to precisely that extent, this government    
would have aided in giving currency to this Scrip---that is, men seeing that the Scrip would    
bring cotten, would gladly give produce for the scrip; and hence a scramble for it, as for gold    
would ensue. If your two hundred and seventy thousand dollars, was to be the sole instance, I    
would gladly risk it. But it would not be the beginning, or, at most, only the beginning. Having    
begun, I could not stop. What I had done for some, I must do for others. All that sort of Scrip    
now in Kentucky, and much not yet in Kentucky, would find it's way into Union-hands and be    
presented under the rule. We all know how easily oaths are furnished, when required, in    
transactions of this sort. And the thing would become even broader yet. Men who have been robbed    
out-right by the rebels, without even receiving scrip would appeal, (and with quite as equitable    
a case) to be permitted a means of indemnity, by leave to go in and bring out cotten. This would    
run till at length I should have to abandon all restraint, or put a stop to what it is now much    
easier to not begin.</p>

Dear Sir: Washington, Nov. 24, 1862</opener>    
<p>A bundle of letters including one from yourself, was, early last week, handed me by Gen.    
Halleck, as I understood, at your request. I sincerely sympathise with you in the death of your    
brave and noble son.<ref target="n5-508-3">3</ref>    
</p>    
<p>In regard to my dismissal of yourself from the military service, it seems to me you    
misunderstand me. I did not charge, or intend to charge you with disloyalty. I had been brought    
to fear that there was a class of officers in the army, not very inconsiderable in numbers, who    
were playing a game to not beat the enemy when they could, on some peculiar notion as to the    
proper way of saving the Union; and when you were proved to me, in your own presence, to have    
avowed yourself in favor of that "game,"and did not attempt to controvert the proof, I    
dismissed you as an example and a warning to that supposed class. I bear you no ill will; and I    
regret that I could not have the example without wounding you personally. But can I now, in view    
of the public interest, restore you to the service, by which the army would understand that I    
indorse and approve that game myself? If there was any doubt of your having made the avowal, the    
case would be different. But when it was proved to me, in your presence, you did not deny or    
attempt to deny it, but confirmed it in my mind, by attempting to sustain the position by    
argument.</p>    
<p>I am really sorry for the pain the case gives you, but I do not see how, consistently with    
duty, I can change it. Yours, &amp;c.</p>

<opener>Gen. Carl Schurz Executive Mansion,<lb/>    
My dear Sir Washington, Nov. 24. 1862.</opener>    
<p>I have just received, and read, your letter of the 20th. The purport of it is that we lost the    
late elections, and the administration is failing, because the war is unsuccessful; and that I    
must not flatter myself that I am not justly to blame for it. I certainly know that if the war    
fails, the administration fails, and that I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be blamed for it, whether I deserve it    
or not. And I ought to be blamed, if I could do better. You think I could do better; therefore    
you blame me already. I think I could not do better; therefore I blame you for blaming me. I    
understand you <hi rend="italic">now</hi> to be willing to accept the help of men, who are not republicans,    
provided they have "heart in it."Agreed. I want no others. But who is to be the judge of    
hearts, or of "heart in it"? If I must discard my own judgment, and take yours, I must also    
take that of others; and by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject, I should    
have none left, republicans, or others---not even yourself. For, be assured, my dear sir, there    
are men who have "heart in it"that think you are performing your part as poorly as you think I    
am performing mine. I certainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan;    
but before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors to them, who would do    
better; and I am sorry    
<pb n="510"/>    
    
to add, that I have seen little since to relieve those fears. I do not clearly see the prospect    
of any more rapid movements. I fear we shall at last find out that the difficulty is in our case,    
rather than in particular generals. I wish to disparage no one---certainly not those who    
sympathize with me; but I must say I need success more than I need sympathy, and that I have not    
seen the so much greater evidence of getting success from my sympathizers, than from those who    
are denounced as the contrary. It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been    
very much alike, in what they have done, and what they have failed to do. In sealing their faith    
with their blood, Baker, an[d] Lyon, and Bohlen, and Richardson, republicans, did all that men    
could do; but did they any more than Kearney, and Stevens, and Reno, and Mansfield, none of whom    
were republicans, and some, at least of whom, have been bitterly, and repeatedly, denounced to me    
as secession sympathizers?<ref target="n5-510-1">1</ref>    
 I will not perform the ungrateful task of    
comparing cases of failure.</p>    
<p>In answer to your question "Has it not been publicly stated in the newspapers, and apparantly    
proved as a fact, that from the commencement of the war, the enemy was continually supplied with    
information by some of the confidential subordinates of as important an officer as Adjutant    
General Thomas?"I must say "no"so far as my knowledge extends. And I add that if you can    
give any tangible evidence upon that subject, I will thank you to come to the City and do so.

<note id="n5-509-2"><p>2 ALS, DLC-Schurz Papers. On November 20,    
Schurz replied to Lincoln's communication of November 10, <hi rend="italic">supra</hi>, in part as    
follows:</p><p>"I fear you entertain too favorable a view of the causes of our defeat in the    
elections. . . .</p>    
<p>"Whatever proportion of Republicans may have entered the army---if the administration had    
succeeded in preserving its hold upon the masses, your majorities would . . . have put the    
majorities of 1860 into the shade. . . . But the general confidence and enthusiasm yielded to    
general disappointment, and . . . too many Republicans . . . either voted against you or withheld    
their votes. I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> this to be a fact. . . . That some of our newspapers disparaged and    
vilified the administration may be true. . . . But however that may be, I ask you . . . what    
power would there have been in newspaper-talk . . . had the administration been able to set up    
against it the evidence of great successes? . . .</p>    
<p>"I am far from presuming to blame you for having placed old democrats into high military    
positions. . . . But it was unfortunate that you sustained them . . . after they had been found    
failing;---failing not only in a political but also in a military sense. Was I really wrong in    
saying that the principal management of the war had been in the hands of your opponents? Or will    
perhaps anybody assert, that such men as McClellan and Buell and Halleck have the least sympathy    
with you or your views and principles?---or that their efficiency as military leaders has offered    
a compensation for their deficiency of sympathy, since the first has in 18 months succeeded in    
effecting literally nothing except the consumption of our resources with the largest and best    
appointed army this country ever saw;---since the second by his criminal tardiness and laxity    
endangered even    
<pb n="511"/>    
    
the safety of Cincinnati; and since the appearance of the third on the battlefield of Shiloh    
served suddenly to arrest the operations of our victorious troops. . . . Has it not been publicly    
stated in the newspapers and apparently proved as a fact, that from the commencement of the war    
the enemy has [been] continually supplied with information by some of the confidential    
subordinates of so important an officer as Adjutant General Thomas?. . . . I am far from being    
inclined to impeach the loyalty and good faith of any man; but the coincidence of circumstances    
is such, that if the case were placed before a popular jury, I would find it much easier to act    
on the prosecution than on the defence. . . . You say that our Republican generals did no better.    
. . . I ask . . . what Republican General has ever had a fair chance . . .?</p>    
<p>"No, sir, let us indulge in no delusions as to the true causes of our defeat in the    
elections. . . . The people had sown confidence and reaped disaster and disappointment. They    
wanted a change, and . . . they sought it in the wrong direction. I entreat you, do not attribute    
to small incidents . . . what is a great historical event. It is best that you . . . should see    
the fact in its true light and appreciate its significance: <hi rend="italic">the result of the elections was a    
most serious and severe reproof administered to the administration</hi>. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p>

Robinson of Lexington, representing himself as a Union man of whose counsels . . . you have seen

Although too long to reproduce in full, the pertinent portions read as follows: "I am in a devil

On December 1, Judge Robertson replied to Lincoln's letter, "In my late telegram to you I did    
not allude to either my boy Adam, or to Col. Utley, or to his case. Divining your information, as    
you must have done, from some other source, you have been misinformed, and . . . misconceived the    
motive of my dispatch. . . . I had put Col. Utley in the position which I preferred, and I    
neither intended nor disired to seek any . . . intervention in . . . my own case. . . . The    
citation in my civil suit against him having been served, I can certainly obtain a judgement for    
$1000, and perhaps more. . . . My object in that suit was far from mercenary---it was solely to    
try the question whether the civil or the military power is Constitutionally supreme in Kentucky.    
. . ."(DLC-RTL).</p>    
<p>Whatever his intentions were at this time, Robertson pressed his suit in the courts and on    
October 6, 1871, eventually obtained judgment against Utley in the U.S. Circuit Court for the    
Eastern District of Wisconsin, in the amount of $908.06 plus costs of $26.40. By an act approved    
February 14, 1873, congress directed the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the amount "together

Major General Halleck Off Acquia Creek, Va<lb/>    
Sir: Nov. 27. 1862</opener>    
<p>I have just had a long conference with Gen. Burnside. He believes that Gen. Lees whole army,    
or nearly the whole of it is in front of him, at and near Fredericksburg. Gen. B. says he could    
take into battle now any day, about, one hundred and ten thousand men, that his army is in good    
spirit, good condition, good moral, and that in all respects he is satisfied with officers and    
men; that he does not want more men with him, because he could not handle them to advantage; that    
he thinks he can cross the river in face of the enemy and drive him away, but that, to use his    
own expression, it is somewhat risky. I wish the case to stand more favorable than this in two    
respects. First, I wish his crossing of the river to be nearly free from risk; and secondly, I    
wish the enemy to be prevented from falling back, accumulating strength as he goes, into his    
intrenchments at Richmond. I therefore propose that Gen. B. shall not move immediately; that we    
accumulate a force on the South bank of the Rappahanock---at, say, Port-Royal, under protection    
of one or two gun-boats, as nearly up to twentyfive thousand    
<pb n="515"/>    
    
strong as we can. At the same time another force of about the same strength as high up the    
Pamunkey, as can be protected by gunboats. These being ready, let all three forces move    
simultaneously, Gen. B.'s force in it's attempt to cross the river, the Rappahanock force moving    
directly up the South side of the river to his assistance, and ready, if found admissable, to    
deflect off to the turnpike bridge over the Mattapony in the direction of Richmond. The Pamunkey    
force to move as rapidly as possible up the North side of the Pamunkey, holding all the bridges,    
and especially the turnpike bridge immediately North of Hanover C.H; hurry North, and seize and    
hold the Mattapony bridge before mentioned, and also, if possible, press higher up the streams    
and destroy the railroad bridges. Then, if Gen. B. succeeds in driving the enemy from    
Fredericksburg, he the enemy no longer has the road to Richmond, but we have it and can march    
into the city. Or, possibly, having forced the enemy from his line, we could move upon, and    
destroy his army. Gen. B.'s main army would have the same line of supply and retreat as he has    
now provided; the Rappahanock force would have that river for supply, and gun-boats to fall back    
upon; and the Pamunkey force would have that river for supply, and a line between the two rivers-    
--Pamunkey &amp; Mattapony---along which to fall back upon it's gun-boats. I think the plan    
promises the best results, with the least hazzard, of any now conceiveable.</p>    
<p>Note--- The above plan, proposed by me, was rejected by Gen. Halleck &amp; Gen. Burnside, on    
the ground that we could not raise and put in position, the Pamunkey force without too much waste    
of time A.L.</p>

Hon. Attorney General Nov. 29, 1862.</opener>    
<p>My dear Sir: Few things perplex me more than this question between Gov. Gamble, and the War    
Department, as to whether the peculiar force organized by the former in Missouri are "State    
troops,"or "United States troops."Now, this is either an immaterial, or a mischievous    
question. First, if no more is desired than to have it settled what name the forces is to be    
called by, it is immaterial.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="516"/>    
Secondly, if it is desired for more than the fixing a name, it can only be to get a position from    
which to draw practical inferences, then it is mischievous. Instead of settling one dispute by    
deciding the question, I should merely furnish a nest full of eggs for hatching new disputes. I    
believe the force is not strictly either "State troops"or "United States troops."It is of    
mixed character. I therefore think it is safer when a practical question arises, to decide that    
question directly, and not indirectly, by deciding a general abstraction supposed to include it,    
and also including a great deal more. Without dispute, Gov. Gamble appoints the officers of this    
force, and fills vacancies when they occur. The question now practically in dispute is "Can Gov.    
Gamble make a vacancy, by removing an officer, or accepting a resignation? Now, while it is    
proper that this question shall be settled, I do not perceive why either Gov. Gamble, or the    
government here, should care which way it is settled. I am perplexed with it only because there    
seems to be pertinacity about it. It seems to me that it might be either way without injury to    
the service; or that the offer of the Secretary of War to let Gov. Gamble make vacancies, and he,    
the Secretary, to ratify the making of them, ought to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>After inquiry, I believe it is true that a man calling himself J. Wesley Greene, and    
professing to reside at Pittsburg, Pa., called on the President some time in November, and stated    
to him that he, Greene, had had two interviews with Jeff. Davis, at Richmond, Va., on the last    
day of October; and also related certain statements which he said Davis had made to him upon the    
occasion. The President became satisfied that Greene had not seen Davis at all, and that the    
whole thing was a very shallow attempt at humbuggery. Jeff. Davis can redeem Greene's character    
if he will, by verifying his statement.</p>

item is described as "a manuscript memo."But Hertz's date, February, 1865, probably taken from    
the American Art Association Anderson Galleries Catalog, October 20, 1930, would seem to be    
incorrect. The New York <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> for December 11, 1862, prints a similar statement at the    
end of a news item reprinted from the Chicago <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, Wednesday, December 10, 1862, which    
gives an account of J. Wesley Greene's visits to Jefferson Davis and to President Lincoln. The    
<hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> does not, however, credit the statement as Lincoln's, although implying that    
Lincoln is the source of information, and it seems possible that Lincoln may have written the    
memorandum in answer to a query from the press on the reliability of Greene's narrative. A letter    
from Greene to Lincoln, November 11, 1862, reads in part as follows:</p><p>"An entire stranger    
to fame, and almost unknown . . . but at the same time an ardent lover of the country which for    
nearly fifty years has encompassed me with its protection, I presume to introduce myself to your    
notice in reference to the . . . termination of the Rebellion and the restoration of the    
Union.</p>    
<p>"One week has but just elapsed since I returned to my home in this city, fresh from two    
interviews with the controlling man of the rebellious states. I not only found him depressed in    
spirit, beyond my conception of him, in view of the terrible    
<pb n="518"/>    
    
circumstances in which he is placed and the condition of the Confederacy, but I found him anxious    
for an end of hostilities and a return to the Union. In the last interview he cautiously    
intimated the terms on which the desired end might be accomplished. They are of a nature which    
forbids me to commit them to writing from this distance. This much I can say that, while he now    
deprecates foreign intervention or foreign mediation, the terms are such as may be secretly    
negotiated, and can in no way reflect upon the Government of which you are the head should they    
in any future period become known.</p>    
<p>"I am no visionary, . . . no speculator, no party demagogue. I am but a plain business man,    
who in other days became incidentally acquainted with Mr. Davis, an acquaintance which secured    
his friendship. . . .</p>    
<p>"I sincerely and daily pray for the peace and unity and prosperity of my beloved country,    
again. I honestly believe they can be brought about at an early day, honorably to the North    
without the continuance of bloodshed and devastation. If, therefore, Your Excellency desires an    
interview with me on this subject such an order as will convey me to Washington will be promptly    
complied with.</p>    
<p>"Permit me to add, Sir, that I have never intimated this matter to any human being; and    
desire that it may, at least for the present, be treated confidentially."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>Since your last annual assembling another year of health and bountiful harvests has passed.    
And while it has not pleased the Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we can but press    
on, guided by the best light He gives us, trusting that in His own good time, and wise way, all    
will yet be well.</p>    
<p>The correspondence touching foreign affairs which has taken place during the last year is    
herewith submitted, in virtual compliance with a request to that effect, made by the House of    
Representatives near the close of the last session of Congress.<ref target="n5-518-2">2</ref>    
</p>    
<p>If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually    
been at former periods, it is certainly more satisfactory than a nation so unhappily distracted    
as we are, might reasonably have apprehended. In the month of June last there were some grounds    
to expect that the maritime powers which, at the beginning of our domestic difficulties, so    
unwisely and unnecessarily, as we think, recognized the insurgents as a belligerent, would soon    
recede from that position,<ref target="n5-518-3">3</ref>    
 which has proved only less injurious to    
themselves, than to our own country. But the temporary    
<pb n="519"/>    
    
reverses which afterwards befell the national arms, and which were exaggerated by our own    
disloyal citizens abroad have hitherto delayed that act of simple justice.<ref target="n5-519-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>The civil war, which has so radically changed for the moment, the occupations and habits of    
the American people, has necessarily disturbed the social condition, and affected very deeply the    
prosperity of the nations with which we have carried on a commerce that has been steadily    
increasing throughout a period of half a century. It has, at the same time, excited political    
ambitions and apprehensions which have produced a profound agitation throughout the civilized    
world. In this unusual agitation we have forborne from taking part in any controversy between    
foreign states, and between parties or factions in such states. We have attempted no    
propagandism, and acknowledged no revolution. But we have left to every nation the exclusive    
conduct and management of its own affairs. Our struggle has been, of course, contemplated by    
foreign nations with reference less to its own merits, than to its supposed, and often    
exaggerated effects and consequences resulting to those nations themselves. Nevertheless,    
complaint on the part of this government, even if it were just, would certainly be unwise.</p>    
<p>The treaty with Great Britain for the suppression of the slave trade has been put into    
operation with a good prospect of complete success. It is an occasion of special pleasure to    
acknowledge that the execution of it, on the part of Her Majesty's government, has been marked    
with a jealous respect for the authority of the United States, and the rights of their moral and    
loyal citizens.</p>    
<p>The convention with Hanover for the abolition of the stade dues has been carried into full    
effect, under the act of Congress for that purpose.</p>    
<p>A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established, and vigorously    
enforced, in a season of great commercial activity like the present, without committing    
occasional mistakes, and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and their    
subjects.</p>    
<p>A civil war occurring in a country where foreigners reside and carry on trade under treaty    
stipulations, is necessarily fruitful of complaints of the violation of neutral rights. All such    
collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly to produce mutual reclamations between    
nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these    
kinds I have,    
<pb n="520"/>    
    
so far as possible, heard and redressed complaints which have been presented by friendly powers.    
There is still, however, a large and an augmenting number of doubtful cases upon which the    
government is unable to agree with the governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants.    
There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States, or their citizens, suffer wrongs from    
the naval or military authorities of foreign nations, which the governments of those states are    
not at once prepared to redress. I have proposed to some of the foreign states, thus interested,    
mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints. This proposition has been made    
especially to Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prussia. In each case it has been kindly    
received, but has not yet been formally adopted.</p>    
<p>I deem it my duty to recommend an appropriation in behalf of the owners of the Norwegian bark    
Admiral P. Tordenskiold, which vessel was, in May, 1861, prevented by the commander of the    
blockading force off Charleston from leaving that port with cargo, notwithstanding a similar    
privilege had, shortly before, been granted to an English vessel. I have directed the Secretary    
of State to cause the papers in the case to be communicated to the proper committees.<ref target="n5-520-1">1</ref>    
</p>    
<p>Applications have been made to me by many free Americans of African descent to favor their    
emigration, with a view to such colonization as was contemplated in recent acts of Congress.    
Other parties, at home and abroad---some from interested motives, others upon patriotic    
considerations, and still others influenced by philanthropic sentiments---have suggested similar    
measures; while, on the other hand, several of the Spanish-American republics have protested    
against the sending of such colonies to their respective territories. Under these circumstances,    
I have declined to move any such colony to any state, without first obtaining the consent of its    
government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all the rights    
of freemen; and I have, at the same time, offered to the several states situated within the    
tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to the advice and consent of    
the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigration of persons of that class to their respective    
territories, upon conditions which shall be equal, just, and humane. Liberia and Hayti are, as    
yet, the only countries to which colonists of African descent from here, could go with certainty    
of being received and adopted as citizens; and I regret to say such persons, contemplating    
colonization,    
<pb n="521"/>    
    
do not seem so willing to migrate to those countries, as to some others, nor so willing as I    
think their interest demands. I believe, however, opinion among them, in this respect, is    
improving; and that, ere long, there will be an augmented, and considerable migration to both    
these countries, from the United States.</p>    
<p>The new commercial treaty between the United States and the Sultan of Turkey has been carried    
into execution.</p>    
<p>A commercial and consular treaty has been negotiated, subject to the Senate's consent, with    
Liberia; and a similar negotiation is now pending with the republic of Hayti. A considerable    
improvement of the national commerce is expected to result from these measures.</p>    
<p>Our relations with Great Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, Russia, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden,    
Austria, the Netherlands, Italy, Rome, and the other European states, remain undisturbed. Very    
favorable relations also continue to be maintained with Turkey, Morocco, China and Japan.</p>    
<p>During the last year there has not only been no change of our previous relations with the    
independent states of our own continent, but, more friendly sentiments than have heretofore    
existed, are believed to be entertained by these neighbors, whose safety and progress, are so    
intimately connected with our own. This statement especially applies to Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa    
Rica, Honduras, Peru, and Chile.</p>    
<p>The commission under the convention with the republic of New Granada closed its session,    
without having audited and passed upon, all the claims which were submitted to it. A proposition    
is pending to revive the convention, that it may be able to do more complete justice. The joint    
commission between the United States and the republic of Costa Rica has completed its labors and    
submitted its report.</p>    
<p>I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantic    
telegraph, and a similar project to extend the telegraph from San Francisco, to connect by a    
Pacific telegraph with the line which is being extended across the Russian empire.</p>    
<p>The Territories of the United States, with unimportant exceptions, have remained undisturbed    
by the civil war, and they are exhibiting such evidence of prosperity as justifies an expectation    
that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States, and be constitutionally    
admitted into the federal Union.</p>    
<p>The immense mineral resources of some of those Territories ought to be developed as rapidly as    
possible. Every step in that direction would have a tendency to improve the revenues of the    
government, and diminish the burdens of the people. It is worthy of    
<pb n="522"/>    
    
your serious consideration whether some extraordinary measures to promote that end cannot be    
adopted. The means which suggests itself as most likely to be effective, is a scientific    
exploration of the mineral regions in those Territories, with a view to the publication of its    
results at home and in foreign countries---results which cannot fail to be auspicious.</p>    
<p>The condition of the finances will claim your most diligent consideration. The vast    
expenditures incident to the military and naval operations required for the suppression of the    
rebellion, have hitherto been met with a promptitude, and certainty, unusual in similar    
circumstances, and the public credit has been fully maintained. The continuance of the war,    
however, and the increased disbursements made necessary by the augmented forces now in the field,    
demand your best reflections as to the best modes of providing the necessary revenue, without    
injury to business and with the least possible burdens upon labor.</p>    
<p>The suspension of specie payments by the banks, soon after the commencement of your last    
session, made large issues of United States notes unavoidable. In no other way could the payment    
of the troops, and the satisfaction of other just demands, be so economically, or so well    
provided for. The judicious legislation of Congress, securing the receivability of these notes    
for loans and internal duties, and making them a legal tender for other debts, has made them an    
universal currency; and has satisfied, partially, at least, and for the time, the long felt want    
of an uniform circulating medium, saving thereby to the people, immense sums in discounts and    
exchanges.</p>    
<p>A return to specie payments, however, at the earliest period compatible with due regard to all    
interests concerned, should ever be kept in view. Fluctuations in the value of currency are    
always injurious, and to reduce these fluctuations to the lowest possible point will always be a    
leading purpose in wise legislation. Convertibility, prompt and certain convertibility into coin,    
is generally acknowledged to be the best and surest safeguard against them; and it is extremely    
doubtful whether a circulation of United States notes, payable in coin, and sufficiently large    
for the wants of the people, can be permanently, usefully and safely maintained.</p>    
<p>Is there, then, any other mode in which the necessary provision for the public wants can be    
made, and the great advantages of a safe and uniform currency secured?</p>    
<p>I know of none which promises so certain results, and is, at the same time, so    
unobjectionable, as the organization of banking associations, under a general act of Congress,    
well guarded in its provisions.</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="523"/>    
To such associations the government might furnish circulating notes, on the security of United    
States bonds deposited in the treasury. These notes, prepared under the supervision of proper    
officers, being uniform in appearance and security, and convertible always into coin, would at    
once protect labor against the evils of a vicious currency, and facilitate commerce by cheap and    
safe exchanges.</p>    
<p>A moderate reservation from the interest on the bonds would compensate the United States for    
the preparation and distribution of the notes and a general supervision of the system, and would    
lighten the burden of that part of the public debt employed as securities. The public credit,    
moreover, would be greatly improved, and the negotiation of new loans greatly facilitated by the    
steady market demand for government bonds which the adoption of the proposed system would    
create.</p>    
<p>It is an additional recommendation of the measure, of considerable weight, in my judgment,    
that it would reconcile, as far as possible, all existing interests, by the opportunity offered    
to existing institutions to reorganize under the act, substituting only the secured uniform    
national circulation for the local and various circulation, secured and unsecured, now issued by    
them.</p>    
<p>The receipts into the treasury from all sources, including loans and balance from the    
preceding year, for the fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1862, were $583,885,247 06, of which    
sum $49,056,397 62 were derived from customs; $1,795,331,73 from the direct tax; from public    
lands $152,203,77; from miscellaneous sources, $931,787 64; from loans in all forms, $529,692,460    
50. The remainder, $2,257,065 80, was the balance from last year.</p>    
<p>The disbursements during the same period were for congressional, executive, and judicial    
purposes, $5,939,009 29; for foreign intercourse, $1,339,710,35; for miscellaneous expenses,    
including the mints, loans, post office deficiencies, collection of revenue, and other like    
charges, $14,129,771 50; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,985 52; under the War    
Department, $394,368,407,36; under the Navy Department, $42,674,569 69; for interest on public    
debt, $13,190,324 45; and for payment of public debt, including reimbursement of temporary loan,    
and redemptions, $96,096,922 09; making an aggregate of $570,841,700 25; and leaving a balance in    
the treasury on the first day of July, 1862, of $13,043,546,81.</p>    
<p>It should be observed that the sum of $96,096,922 09, expended for reimbursements and    
redemption of public debt, being included also in the loans made, may be properly deducted, both    
from receipts    
<pb n="524"/>    
    
and expenditures, leaving the actual receipts for the year $487,788,324 97; and the expenditures,    
$474,744,778 16.</p>    
<p>Other information on the subject of the finances will be found in the report of the Secretary    
of the Treasury, to whose statements and views I invite your most candid and considerate    
attention.</p>    
<p>The reports of the Secretaries of War, and of the Navy, are herewith transmitted. These    
reports, though lengthy, are scarcely more than brief abstracts of the very numerous and    
extensive transactions and operations conducted through those departments. Nor could I give a    
summary of them here, upon any principle, which would admit of its being much shorter than the    
reports themselves. I therefore content myself with laying the reports before you, and asking    
your attention to them.</p>    
<p>It gives me pleasure to report a decided improvement in the financial condition of the Post    
Office Department, as compared with several preceding years. The receipts for the fiscal year    
1861 amounted to $8,349,296 40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for    
three quarters of that year. Notwithstanding the cessation of revenue from the so-called seceded    
States during the last fiscal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has    
been sufficient to produce a revenue during the same year of $8,299,820 90, being only $50,000    
less than was derived from all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures    
show a still more favorable result. The amount expended in 1861 was $13,606,759 11. For the last    
year the amount has been reduced to $11,125,364 13, showing a decrease of about $2,481,000 in the    
expenditures as compared with the preceding year and about $3,750,000 as compared with the fiscal    
year 1860. The deficiency in the department for the previous year was $4,551,966.98. For the last    
fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814.57. These favorable results are in part owing to the    
cessation of mail service in the insurrectionary States, and in part to a careful review of all    
expenditures in that department in the interest of economy. The efficiency of the postal service,    
it is believed, has also been much improved. The Postmaster General has also opened a    
correspondence, through the Department of State, with foreign governments, proposing a convention    
of postal representatives for the purpose of simplifying the rates of foreign postage, and to    
expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens, and to    
the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained, and agreed to, by all    
the governments from whom replies have been received.</p>    
<p>I ask the attention of Congress to the suggestions of the Postmaster</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="525"/>    
General in his report respecting the further legislation required, in his opinion, for the    
benefit of the postal service.</p>    
<p>The Secretary of the Interior reports as follows in regard to the public lands:</p>    
<p>"The public lands have ceased to be a source of revenue. From the 1st July, 1861, to the 30th    
September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands were $137,476 26---a sum much    
less than the expenses of our land system during the same period. The homestead law, which will    
take effect on the 1st of January next, offers such inducements to settlers, that sales for cash    
cannot be expected, to an extent sufficient to meet the expenses of the General Land Office, and    
the cost of surveying and bringing the land into market"</p>    
<p>The discrepancy between the sum here stated as arising from the sales of the public lands, and    
the sum derived from the same source as reported from the Treasury Department arises, as I    
understand, from the fact that the periods of time, though apparently, were not really,    
coincident at the beginning point---the Treasury report including a considerable sum now, which    
had previously been reported from the Interior---sufficiently large to greatly overreach the sum    
derived from the three months now reported upon by the Interior, and not by the Treasury.</p>    
<p>The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during the past year, manifested a spirit of    
insubordination, and, at several points, have engaged in open hostilities against the white    
settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occupying the Indian country south of Kansas, renounced    
their allegiance to the United States, and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who    
remained loyal to the United States were driven from the country. The chief of the Cherokees has    
visited this city for the purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United    
States. He alleges that they were constrained, by superior force, to enter into treaties with the    
insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty    
stipulations required.</p>    
<p>In the month of August last the Sioux Indians, in Minnesota, attacked the settlements in their    
vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing, indiscriminately, men, women, and children. This attack    
was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no means of defence had been provided. It is estimated    
that not less than eight hundred persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of    
property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspicions,    
which may be unjust, need not to be stated. Information was received by the Indian bureau, from    
different sources,    
<pb n="526"/>    
    
about the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the    
white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains. The    
State of Minnesota has suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her    
territory has been depopulated, and a severe loss has been sustained by the destruction of    
property. The people of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the    
limits of the State as a guarantee against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs    
will furnish full details. I submit for your especial consideration whether our Indian system    
shall not be remodelled. Many wise and good men have impressed me with the belief that this can    
be profitably done.</p>    
<p>I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners, which shows the progress that has    
been made in the enterprise of constructing the Pacific railroad. And this suggests the earliest    
completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the projects now pending    
before them for enlarging the capacities of the great canals in New York and Illinois, as being    
of vital, and rapidly increasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vast    
interior region hereinafter to be noticed at some greater length. I purpose having prepared and    
laid before you at an early day some interesting and valuable statistical information upon this    
subject. The military and commercial importance of enlarging the Illinois and Michigan canal, and    
improving the Illinois river, is presented in the report of Colonel Webster to the Secretary of    
War, and now transmitted to Congress. I respectfully ask attention to it.</p>    
<p>To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 15th of May last, I have caused the    
Department of Agriculture of the United States to be organized.</p>    
<p>The Commissioner informs me that within the period of a few months this department has    
established an extensive system of correspondence and exchanges, both at home and abroad, which    
promises to effect highly beneficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent    
improvements in agriculture, in the introduction of new products, and in the collection of the    
agricultural statistics of the different States.</p>    
<p>Also that it will soon be prepared to distribute largely seeds, cereals, plants and cuttings,    
and has already published, and liberally diffused, much valuable information in anticipation of a    
more elaborate report, which will in due time be furnished, embracing some valuable tests in    
chemical science now in progress in the laboratory.</p>    
<p>The creation of this department was for the more immediate    
<pb n="527"/>    
    
benefit of a large class of our most valuable citizens; and I trust that the liberal basis upon    
which it has been organized will not only meet your approbation, but that it will realize, at no    
distant day, all the fondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, and become the fruitful    
source of advantage to all our people.</p>    
<p>On the twenty-second day of September last a proclamation was issued by the Executive, a copy    
of which is herewith submitted.</p>    
<p>In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now    
respectfully recall your attention to what may be called "compensated emancipation."</p>    
<p>A nation may be said to consist of its territory, its people, and its laws. The territory is    
the only part which is of certain durability. "One generation passeth away, and another    
generation cometh, but the earth abideth forever."It is of the first importance to duly    
consider, and estimate, this ever-enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is    
owned and inhabited by the people of the United States, is well adapted to be the home of one    
national family; and it is not well adapted for two, or more. Its vast extent, and its variety of    
climate and productions, are of advantage, in this age, for one people, whatever they might have    
been in former ages. Steam, telegraphs, and intelligence, have brought these, to be an    
advantageous combination, for one united people.</p>    
<p>In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion, as a remedy    
for the differences between the people of the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot    
improve, and which, therefore, I beg to repeat:</p>    
<p>"One section of our country believes slavery is <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, and ought to be extended,    
while the other believes it is <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi>, and ought not to be extended. This is the only    
substantial dispute. The fugitive slave clause of the Constitution, and the law for the    
suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well enforced, perhaps, as any law can ever    
be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. The    
great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in    
each. This, I think, cannot be perfectly cured; and it would be worse in both cases    
<hi rend="italic">after</hi> the separation of the sections, than before. The foreign slave trade, now    
imperfectly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section; while    
fugitive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by the    
other.</p>    
<p>"Physically speaking, we cannot separate. We cannot remove our respective sections from each    
other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go    
<pb n="528"/>    
    
out of the presence, and beyond the reach of each other; but the different parts of our country    
cannot do this. They cannot but remain face to face; and intercourse, either amicable or hostile,    
must continue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intercourse more advantageous, or    
more satisfactory, <hi rend="italic">after</hi> separation than <hi rend="italic">before?</hi> Can aliens make treaties,    
easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens, than    
laws can among friends? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always; and when, after much loss    
on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions, as to    
terms of intercourse, are again upon you."</p>    
<p>There is no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a national boundary, upon which to divide.    
Trace through, from east to west, upon the line between the free and slave country, and we shall    
find a little more than one-third of its length are rivers, easy to be crossed, and populated, or    
soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; while nearly all its remaining length, are merely    
surveyor's lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any consciousness of their    
presence. No part of this line can be made any more difficult to pass, by writing it down on    
paper, or parchment, as a national boundary. The fact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on    
the part of the seceding section, the fugitive slave clause, along with all other constitutional    
obligations upon the section seceded from, while I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever    
be made to take its place.</p>    
<p>But there is another difficulty. The great interior region, bounded east by the Alleghanies,    
north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky mountains, and south by the line along which    
the culture of corn and cotton meets, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all    
of Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Minnesota and    
the Territories of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colorado, already has above ten millions of    
people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years, if not prevented by any political folly    
or mistake. It contains more than one-third of the country owned by the United States---certainly    
more than one million of square miles. Once half as populous as Massachusetts already is, it    
would have more than seventy-five millions of people. A glance at the map shows that,    
territorially speaking, it is the great body of the republic. The other parts are but marginal    
borders to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the rocky mountains to the Pacific, being    
the deepest, and also the richest, in undeveloped resources. In the production of provisions,    
grains, grasses, and all which proceed from them, this    
<pb n="529"/>    
    
great interior region is naturally one of the most important in the world. Ascertain from the    
statistics the small proportion of the region which has, as yet, been brought into cultivation,    
and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed    
with the magnitude of the prospect presented. An[d] yet this region has no sea-coast, touches no    
ocean anywhere. As part of one nation, its people now find, and may forever find, their way to    
Europe by New York, to South America and Africa by New Orleans, and to Asia by San Francisco. But    
separate our common country into two nations, as designed by the present rebellion, and every man    
of this great interior region is thereby cut off from some one or more of these outlets, not,    
perhaps, by a physical barrier, but by embarrassing and onerous trade regulations.</p>    
<p>And this is true, <hi rend="italic">wherever</hi> a dividing, or boundary line, may be fixed. Place it    
between the now free and slave country, or place it south of Kentucky, or north of Ohio, and    
still the truth remains, that none south of it, can trade to any port or place north of it, and    
none north of it, can trade to any port or place south of it, except upon terms dictated by a    
government foreign to them. These outlets, east, west, and south, are indispensable to the well-    
being of the people inhabiting, and to inhabit, this vast interior region. <hi rend="italic">Which</hi> of the    
three may be the best, is no proper question. All, are better than either, and all, of right,    
belong to that people, and to their successors forever. True to themselves, they will not ask    
<hi rend="italic">where</hi> a line of separation shall be, but will vow, rather, that there shall be no such    
line. Nor are the marginal regions less interested in these communications to, and through them,    
to the great outside world. They too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of the    
West, without paying toll at the crossing of any national boundary.</p>    
<p>Our national strife springs not from our permanent part; not from the land we inhabit; not    
from our national homestead. There is no possible severing of this, but would multiply, and not    
mitigate, evils among us. In all its adaptations and aptitudes, it demands union, and abhors    
separation. In fact, it would, ere long, force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the    
separation might have cost.</p>    
<p>Our strife pertains to ourselves---to the passing generations of men; and it can, without    
convulsion, be hushed forever with the passing of one generation.</p>    
<p>In this view, I recommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amendatory to    
the Constitution of the United States:    
<pb n="530"/>    
    
<hi rend="italic">"Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in    
Congress assembled</hi>, (two thirds of both houses concurring,) That the following articles be    
proposed to the legislatures (or conventions) of the several States as amendments to the    
Constitution of the United States, all or any of which articles when ratified by three-fourths of    
the said legislatures (or conventions) to be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution,    
viz:</p>    
<p>"Article ---.</p>    
<p>"Every State, wherein slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein, at any time,    
or times, before the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand and nine hundred,    
shall receive compensation from the United States as follows, to wit:</p>    
<p>"The President of the United States shall deliver to every such State, bonds of the United    
States, bearing interest at the rate of --- per cent, per annum, to an amount equal to the    
aggregate sum of for each slave shown to have been therein, by the eig[h]th census of the United    
States, said bonds to be delivered to such State by instalments, or in one parcel, at the    
completion of the abolishment, accordingly as the same shall have been gradual, or at one time,    
within such State; and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond, only from the proper time    
of its delivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterwards    
reintroducing or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so    
received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon.</p>    
<p>"Article ---.</p>    
<p>"All slaves who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of the war, at any time    
before the end of the rebellion, shall be forever free; but all owners of such, who shall not    
have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them, at the same rates as is provided for States    
adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way, that no slave shall be twice accounted for.</p>    
<p>"Article ---.</p>    
<p>"Congress may appropriate money, and otherwise provide, for colonizing free colored persons,    
with their own consent, at any place or places without the United States."</p>    
<p>I beg indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length. Without slavery the    
rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it could not continue.</p>    
<p>Among the friends of the Union there is great diversity, of sentiment,    
<pb n="531"/>    
    
and of policy, in regard to slavery, and the African race amongst us. Some would perpetuate    
slavery; some would abolish it suddenly, and without compensation; some would abolish it    
gradually, and with compensation; some would remove the freed people from us, and some would    
retain them with us; and there are yet other minor diversities. Because of these diversities, we    
waste much strength in struggles among ourselves. By mutual concession we should harmonize, and    
act together. This would be compromise; but it would be compromise among the friends, and not    
with the enemies of the Union. These articles are intended to embody a plan of such mutual    
concessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow, at least,    
in several of the States.</p>    
<p>As to the first article, the main points are: first, the emancipation; secondly, the length of    
time for consummating it---thirty-seven years; and thirdly, the compensation.</p>    
<p>The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to the advocates of perpetual slavery; but the length    
of time should greatly mitigate their dissatisfaction. The time spares both races from the evils    
of sudden derangement---in fact, from the necessity of any derangement---while most of those    
whose habitual course of thought will be disturbed by the measure will have passed away before    
its consummation. They will never see it. Another class will hail the prospect of emancipation,    
but will deprecate the length of time. They will feel that it gives too little to the now living    
slaves. But it really gives them much. It saves them from the vagrant destitution which must    
largely attend immediate emancipation in localities where their numbers are very great; and it    
gives the inspiring assurance that their posterity shall be free forever. The plan leaves to each    
State, choosing to act under it, to abolish slavery now, or at the end of the century, or at any    
intermediate time, or by degrees, extending over the whole or any part of the period; and it    
obliges no two states to proceed alike. It also provides for compensation, and generally the mode    
of making it. This, it would seem, must further mitigate the dissatisfaction of those who favor    
perpetual slavery, and especially of those who are to receive the compensation. Doubtless some of    
those who are to pay, and not to receive will object. Yet the measure is both just and    
economical. In a certain sense the liberation of slaves is the destruction of property---property    
acquired by descent, or by purchased, the same as any other property. It is no less true for    
having been often said, that the people of the south are not more responsible for the original    
introduction of this property, than are the people of the north; and when it is remembered how    
unhesitatingly    
<pb n="532"/>    
    
we all use cotton and sugar, and share the profits of dealing in them, it may not be quite safe    
to say, that the south has been more responsible than the north for its continuance. If then, for    
a common object, this property is to be sacrificed is it not just that it be done at a common    
charge?</p>    
<p>And if, with less money, or money more easily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union    
by this means, than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it? Let us consider    
it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensated emancipation was    
proposed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted, by even    
some of the slave States, the same sum would not have done more to close the war, than has been    
otherwise done. If so the measure would save money, and, in that view, would be a prudent and    
economical measure. Certainly it is not so easy to pay <hi rend="italic">something</hi> as it is to pay    
<hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>; but it is easier to pay a <hi rend="italic">large</hi> sum than it is to pay a larger one.    
And it is easier to pay any sum <hi rend="italic">when</hi> we are able, than it is to pay it <hi rend="italic">before</hi>    
we are able. The war requires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary    
for compensated emancipation, of course, would be large. But it would require no ready cash; nor    
the bonds even, any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would    
not, close before the end of the thirty-seven years. At that time we shall probably have a    
hundred millions of people to share the burden, instead of thirty one millions, as now. And not    
only so, but the increase of our population may be expected to continue for a long time after    
that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will not have become full. I do not    
state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an    
average, from our first national census, in 1790, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a    
population of 103,208,415. And why may we not continue that ratio far beyond that period? Our    
abundant room---our broad national homestead---is our ample resource. Were our territory as    
limited as are the British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated.    
Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native    
born away. But such is not our condition. We have two millions nine hundred and sixty-three    
thousand square miles. Europe has three millions and eight hundred thousand, with a population    
averaging seventy-three and one-third persons to the square mile. Why may not our country, at    
some time, average as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface, by mountains, rivers,    
lakes, deserts, or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage?</p>    
<p>    
<pb n="533"/>    
If, then, we are, at some time, to be as populous as Europe, how soon? As to when this    
<hi rend="italic">may</hi> be, we can judge by the past and the present; as to when it <hi rend="italic">will</hi> be, if    
ever, depends much on whether we maintain the Union. Several of our States are already above the    
average of Europe---seventy three and a third to the square mile. Massachusetts has 157; Rhode    
Island, 133; Connecticut, 99; New York and New Jersey, each, 80; also two other great States,    
Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 63, and the latter 59. The States    
already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio, since    
passing that point, as ever before; while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our    
country, in natural capacity for sustaining a dense population.</p>    
<p>Taking the nation in the aggregate, and we find its population and ratio of increase, for the    
several decennial periods, to be as follows:---</p>    
<p>1790 	3,929,827</p>    
<p>1800 	5,305,937 	35.02 per cent. 	{ratio of</p>    
<p>			{increase</p>    
<p>1810 	7,239,814 	36.45 	"</p>    
<p>1820 	9,638,131 	33.13 	"</p>    
<p>1830 	12,866,020 	33.49 	"</p>    
<p>1840 	17,069,453 	32.67 	"</p>    
<p>1850 	23,191,876 	35.87 	"</p>    
<p>1860 	31,443,790 	35.58 	"</p>    
<p>This shows an average decennial increase of 34.60 per cent. in population through the seventy    
years from our first, to our last census yet taken. It is seen that the ratio of increase, at no    
one of these seven periods, is either two per cent. below, or two per cent. above, the average;    
thus showing how inflexible, and, consequently, how reliable, the law of increase, in our case,    
is. Assuming that it will continue, gives the following results:---</p>    
<p>1870 	42,323,341 	1910 	138,918,526</p>    
<p>1880 	56,967,216 	1920 	186,984,335</p>    
<p>1890 	76,677,872 	1930 	251,680,914</p>    
<p>1900 	103,208,415</p>    
<p>These figures show that our country <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be as populous as Europe now is, at some    
point between 1920 and 1930---say about 1925---our territory, at seventy-three and a third    
persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.</p>    
<p>And we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance, by the    
folly and evils of disunion, or by long and exhausting war springing from the only great element    
of national discord    
<pb n="534"/>    
    
among us. While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of secession, breeding    
lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization, and prosperity, no one can doubt    
that the extent of it would be very great and injurious.</p>    
<p>The proposed emancipation would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of    
population, and proportionately the wealth of the country. With these, we should pay all the    
emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt,    
without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent. per annum, simple    
interest, from the end of our revolutionary struggle until to day, without paying anything on    
either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now, than each man    
owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men, through the whole period, has been    
greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon the debt. Thus, time alone    
relieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest    
accumulates on its debt.</p>    
<p>This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due; but it shows the    
great importance of time in this connexion---the great advantage of a policy by which we shall    
not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to    
pay now, when we number but thirty one millions. In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much    
harder to pay for the war, than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then    
the latter will cost no blood, no precious life. It will be a saving of both.</p>    
<p>As to the second article, I think it would be impracticable to return to bondage the class of    
persons therein contemplated. Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal    
owners; and hence, provision is made in this article for compensating such.</p>    
<p>The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely    
authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded as    
objectionable, on the one hand, or on the other, in so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the    
mutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters, through their    
representatives in Congress.</p>    
<p>I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor colonization. And yet    
I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country,    
which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.</p>    
<p>It is insisted that their presence would injure, and displace white    
<pb n="535"/>    
    
labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that    
time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would    
not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people    
can displace any more white labor, by being free, than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their    
old places, they jostle no white laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open    
to white laborers. Logically, there is neither more nor less of it. Emancipation, even without    
deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and, very surely, would not reduce    
them. Thus, the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed people    
would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably, for a time, would do    
less, leaving an increased part to white laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and,    
consequently, enhancing the wages of it. With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced    
wages to white labor is mathematically certain. Labor is like any other commodity in the market--    
-increase the demand for it, and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of black labor,    
by colonizing the black laborer out of the country, and, by precisely so much, you increase the    
demand for, and wages of, white labor.</p>    
<p>But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth, and cover the whole land? Are they    
not already in the land? Will liberation make them any more numerous? Equally distributed among    
the whites of the whole country, and there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the    
one, in any way, greatly disturb the seven? There are many communities now, having more than one    
free colored person, to seven whites; and this, without any apparent consciousness of evil from    
it. The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition.    
The District has more than one free colored to six whites; and yet, in its frequent petitions to    
Congress, I believe it has never presented the presence of free colored persons as one of its    
grievances. But why should emancipation south, send the free people north? People, of any color,    
seldom run, unless there be something to run from. <hi rend="italic">Heretofore</hi> colored people, to some    
extent, have fled north from bondage; and <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, perhaps, from both bondage and    
destitution. But if gradual emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to    
flee from. Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured;    
and the freed men, in turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages, till new homes can be    
found for them, in congenial climes,    
<pb n="536"/>    
    
and with people of their own blood and race. This proposition can be trusted on the mutual    
interests involved. And, in any event, cannot the north decide for itself, whether to receive    
them?</p>    
<p>Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption of    
colored people northward, because of the abolishment of slavery in this District last spring?</p>    
<p>What I have said of the proportion of free colored persons to the whites, in the District, is    
from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called contrabands, nor to those made    
free by the act of Congress abolishing slavery here.</p>    
<p>The plan consisting of these articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the    
national authority would be accepted without its adoption.</p>    
<p>Nor will the war, nor proceedings under the proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed    
because of the <hi rend="italic">recommendation</hi> of this plan. Its timely <hi rend="italic">adoption</hi>, I doubt not,    
would bring restoration and thereby stay both.</p>    
<p>And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provide by law for    
compensating any State which may adopt emancipation, before this plan shall have been acted upon,    
is hereby earnestly renewed. Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same    
arguments apply to both.</p>    
<p>This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for    
restoring and preserving the national authority throughout the Union. The subject is presented    
exclusively in its economical aspect. The plan would, I am confident, secure peace more speedily,    
and maintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all it would cost,    
considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of payment, would be easier paid than will    
be the additional cost of the war, if we rely solely upon force. It is much---very much---that it    
would cost no blood at all.</p>    
<p>The plan is proposed as permanent constitutional law. It cannot become such without the    
concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and, afterwards, three-fourths of the States. The    
requisite three-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave states. Their    
concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation, at no    
very distant day, upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would end the struggle now,    
and save the Union forever.</p>    
<p>I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the    
nation by the Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors,    
nor    
<pb n="537"/>    
    
that many of you have more experience than I, in the conduct of public affairs. Yet I trust that    
in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to    
yourselves, in any undue earnestness. I may seem to display.</p>    
<p>Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus    
lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the national    
authority and national prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely? Is it doubted that we here--    
-Congress and Executive---can secure its adoption? Will not the good people respond to a united,    
and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly, or so speedily,    
assure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not "can <hi rend="italic">any</hi> of us    
<hi rend="italic">imagine</hi> better?"but "can we <hi rend="italic">all</hi> do better?"Object whatsoever is possible,    
still the question recurs "can we do better?"The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to    
the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the    
occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall our    
selves, and then we shall save our country.</p>    
<p>Fellow-citizens, <hi rend="italic">we</hi> cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this    
administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or    
insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light    
us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We <hi rend="italic">say</hi> we are for the Union.    
The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do    
know how to save it. We---even <hi rend="italic">we here</hi>---hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In    
<hi rend="italic">giving</hi> freedom to the <hi rend="italic">slave</hi>, we <hi rend="italic">assure</hi> freedom to the <hi rend="italic">free</hi>---    
honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the    
last best, hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain,    
peaceful, generous, just---a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must    
forever bless.</p>

<p>To the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>    
<p>On the third of November, 1861, a collision took place off the coast of Cuba between the    
United States War Steamer `San Jacinto' and the French Brig `Jules et Marie,' resulting in    
serious damage to the latter. The obligation of this government to make amends therefor, could    
not be questioned if the injury resulted from any fault on the part of the `San Jacinto.' With a    
view to ascertain this, the subject was referred to a Commission of the United States and French    
naval officers at New York, with a naval officer of Italy as an arbiter. The conclusion arrived    
at was, that the collision was occasioned by the failure of the `San Jacinto' seasonably to    
reverse her engine. It then became necessary to ascertain the amount of indemnification due to    
the injured party. The United States Consul General at Havana was consequently instructed to    
confer with the Consul of France on this point, and they have determined that the sum of nine    
thousand five hundred dollars is an equitable allowance under the circumstances.</p>    
<p>I recommend an appropriation of this sum for the benefit of the owners of the `Jules et    
Marie.'</p>    
<p>A copy of the letter of Mr. Shufeldt, the Consul General of the United States at Havana, to    
the Secretary of State on the subject is herewith transmitted. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>

<p>In answer to your inquiries I can only say, at this distance of time, that I remember the    
Land-officers at Vandalia, Palestine, Danville and Dixon, in the State of Illinois, who went in    
under the administration of President Taylor, afterwards made a claim in connection with the    
location of Land-Warrants in the respective offices, which claim was disallowed by the accounting    
officers at Washington; that the claim, and consequently the question in all the cases was the    
same, and that the officers, of whom you were one, determined to test the legality of the claim    
in a suit against one of them, which might be brought by the government; &amp; I think the    
District Attorney also agreed to it, so far as to sue one only---Daniel Clapp, of Danville &amp;    
Judge Logan and myself were engaged to defend; and while I, do not now remember the exact    
question, I do remember that I<hi rend="italic">expected the defence would succeed, and I am sure there was    
nothing in the claim, to cast any imputation upon the parties making it</hi>. My recollection is    
that the defendants or rather, <hi rend="italic">the single defendant</hi>, constantly sought to bring the suit    
to trial, <hi rend="italic">that the District Attorney was never ready</hi>, and that the case lingered many    
years, and, as I think <hi rend="italic">was still on the docket when I came on here</hi>. Yours very truly A.

<p>I find on maps here that Huntsville [Hartsville, Tennessee] is on the North bank of Cumberland    
river, sixteen miles directly east of Gallatin, and apparently on a turnpike road leading towards    
East Tennessee generally. What on earth an isolated Brigade was doing there I can not    
concieve</p>    
<p>The road is not a line between any two places in our possession. Yours truly, A. LINCOLN.</p>

<note id="n5-545-2"><p>2 Copy, DNA WR RG 108, HQA, Letters    
Received, L 1243. On December 9, 1862, Halleck directed Rosecrans to "immediately report why an    
isolated brigade was at Hartsville, and by whose command; and also by whose fault it was    
surprised and captured."(OR, I, XX, I, 42). Rosecrans replied at 11 P.M. on December    
9:</p><p>"In reply to your telegram, inquiring why the brigade was stationed at Hartsville, I    
respectfully state that it was necessary to cover the crossing of the Cumberland River against    
rebel cavalry, who would essay to attack our road and capture our trains. We have, for all our    
immense line of front communications, picket, and couriers, less than 4,000 cavalry, and the    
enemy not less than 10,000, who are much relieved by guerrilla scouts, and can concentrate for    
mischief with    
<pb n="546"/>    
    
almost perfect secrecy and impunity. The subjoined copy of General Thomas' report shows that it    
was a pretty full brigade, posted strongly, with a cavalry regiment for picket duty on the north    
side of the river, in a commanding position; that it was strongly supported within 9 miles, and,    
but for being surprised and making feeble resistance, it would have been succored, and the enemy    
badly whipped. That outpost was stronger and better supported than our outpost at Rienzi, 7 miles    
below Corinth, last summer. The difference was in the superiority and number of rebel    
cavalry:</p>    
<p>"`Hartsville was garrisoned by the Thirty-ninth Brigade, Twelfth Division (Dumont's), for    
duty, and was commanded by Col. A.B. Moore, One hundred and fourth Illinois. There was also a    
regiment of cavalry posted there, the Second Indiana, sent there by your order. The effective    
force not known. The troops were posted so as to guard the ford and the approaches from the    
direction of Lebanon, and the cavalry for picket duty and scouting. Col. J.M. Harlan, Second    
Brigade, First Division, was posted at Castalian Springs. This brigade reports 2,725 men present    
for duty. Colonel [Abram O.] Miller, commanding the Fortieth Brigade, was also posted at    
Castalian Springs, sent there to relieve Colonel Harlan. This brigade reports 2,274 men present    
for duty. The last two brigades were nine miles distant from Hartsville when the attack was made.    
As soon as cannonading was heard, Colonel Harlan ordered Colonel Miller to march with his command    
in the direction of Hartsville, and, with a portion of his brigade, followed Colonel Miller, and    
orders were given to the cavalry from these headquarters to be vigilant and scour the country, so    
that no enemy could approach without giving timely notice to the garrison. Colonel Harlan, upon    
being relieved by Colonel [Joseph R.] Scott at Hartsville, informed me that the position was    
strong and defensible; added to the information received from my officers, led to the belief that    
the officer in command allowed himself to be surprised, which resulted in the capture of nearly    
his whole force. The attack was sudden, and so quickly decided that it was impossible for re-    
enforcements to reach Hartsville in time to take part in the action, and the enemy have been    
defeated and probably cut off before crossing the river."' (<hi rend="italic">Ibid</hi>., p. 43).</p>    
<p>On February 13, 1863, Halleck recommended that Colonel Absalom B. Moore be dismissed for    
neglect of duty. Moore was not dismissed, however, but resigned on account of disability, his    
resignation taking effect on September 9, 1863, (<hi rend="italic">ibid.</hi>, p. 45, note). See also Lincoln

Curtis, who had been placed in command of the Department of the Missouri on September 19, 1862,    
telegraphed a brief acknowledgment at 12:30 P.M., "Dispatch rec'd. Proceedings suspended."    
(DLC-RTL). On December 12 he replied at length as follows:</p><p>"Your telegraphic dispatch of    
the 10th inst. suspending proceedings in the order made by General Schofield for collecting half    
a million from Secessionists and southern sympathizers, . . . was duly received, and proceedings    
immediately suspended. . . . I had supposed and so held, that Gen. Schofield issued the order in    
his capacity of Brigadier General of Enrolled Missouri Militia, and I only stood ready to support    
the State in the execution of her affairs. But the Governor and Genl. Schofield send me papers .    
. . which try to place the United States in the front rank. Before taking that place myself, I    
had referred the matters to my Commanding General, presenting some legal doubts such as these:---    
</p>    
<p>"1st. The words defining the persons to be assessed . . . are too indefinite.</p>    
<p>"2d. . . . Is it competent for the United States to make assessments for State purposes, and    
if we do it for one State, will we not open a wide door. . . .</p>    
<p>"3d. If there was a <hi rend="italic">military necessity</hi> . . . which would justify an assessment, as a    
<hi rend="italic">military</hi> duty, I cannot say it now exists. . . .</p>    
<p>"4th. If it is a <hi rend="italic">tax</hi>, it conflicts with the Constitution of the United States. . .    
.</p>    
<p>"5th. It conflicts with the direct tax prescribed by the revenue laws of Congress. . . .</p>    
<p>"6th. It conflicts with the Confiscation act . . . by taking for State purposes, that which    
should be confiscated for the United States.</p>    
<p>"In my judgement, some of these objections are insurmountable. Besides, I consider the sum    
exorbitant for one County. . . .</p>    
<p>"To `suspend' is better than to relinquish or annul, as it acts as a restraint on disloyal    
persons who fear its execution. Let the matter rest till the rebels all come in and swear their    
fidelity to our cause. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>

<p>In compliance with your resolution of December 5th, 1862, requesting the President "to    
furnish the Senate with all information in his possession touching the late Indian barbarities in    
the State of Minnesota, and also the evidence in his possession upon which some of the principal

which is herewith inclosed, marked "B."</p>    
<p>I further state, that on the 8th. day of November last I received a long telegraphic dispatch    
from Major General Pope, at St. Paul, Minnesota, simply announcing the names of the persons    
sentenced

to be hanged. I immediately telegraphed to have transcripts of the records in all the cases    
forwarded to me, which transcripts, however, did not reach me until two or three days before the

appeals in behalf of the condemned, appeals for their execution, and expressions of opinion as to    
proper policy in regard to them, and to the Indians generally in that vicinity, none of which, as    
I understand, falls within the scope of your inquiry. After the arrival of the transcripts of    
records, but before I had sufficient opportunity to examine them, I received a joint letter from

of fact not found in the records of the trials, and for which reason I herewith transmit a copy,    
marked "C."I also, for the same reason, inclose a printed memorial of the citizens of St Paul,    
addressed to me, and forwarded with the letter aforesaid.</p>    
<p>Anxious to not act with so much clemency as to encourage another outbreak on the one hand, nor    
with so much severity as to be real cruelty on the other, I caused a careful examination of the    
records of trials to be made, in view of first ordering the execution of such as had been proved    
guilty of violating females. Contrary to my expectations, only two of this class were found. I    
then directed a further examination, and a classification of all who were proven to have    
participated in <hi rend="italic">massacres</hi>, as distinguished from participation in <hi rend="italic">battles</hi>. This    
class numbered forty, and included the two convicted of female violation. One of the number is    
strongly recommended by the Commission which tried them, for commutation to ten years'    
imprisonment.<ref target="n5-551-2">2</ref> I have ordered the other thirty-nine

transmitted, marked "D."</p>

<p>Fellow-citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives:</p>    
<p>I have in my possession three valuable swords, formerly the property of Gen. David E. Twiggs,    
which I now place at the disposal of Congress. They were forwarded to me from New Orleans by    
Major General Benjamin F. Butler. If they, or any of them, shall be by Congress disposed of in    
reward or compliment of military service, I think General Butler is entitled to the first    
consideration. A copy of the General's letter to me, accompanying the swords, is herewith    
transmitted. ABRAHAM LINCOLN</p>    
<p>December 12, 1862.</p>

233, House Executive Document No. 11. Butler's letter forwarding the swords---one of which had    
been presented to the hero of Monterey by Congress, one by the State of Georgia, and one by his    
native city of Augusta---is printed in <hi rend="italic">House Executive Document No. 11</hi>. Upon fleeing    
from New Orleans, Twiggs presented the swords to Miss Rowena Florence, "but as she had neglected    
to inform her father of this singular donation,    
<pb n="553"/>    
    
<hi rend="italic">causa fugae</hi>, and as the girl's mother caused them to be given to a negro, to be sent    
back to General Twiggs' house, I ventured to interfere. . . ."Butler suggested that the    
congressional sword be presented to "some officer as a token of appreciation of loyalty,"that    
the State of Georgia sword be placed in the library at West Point "as a perpetual memento . . .    
how worse than useless are all education and military training . . . if heartfelt patriotism and    
undying fealty to the Constitution and the flag is wanting,"and that the Augusta sword be    
placed in the Patent Office "as a warning against the folly and uselessness of such an invention    
as `secession."' A resolution (S. 116) introduced on January 7, 1863, disposing of the swords as    
Butler had suggested and following Lincoln's recommendation that Butler receive the congressional    
sword, was pigeonholed. Butler deposited the swords in the Treasury, and after the war they were    
returned to Twiggs' daughter (<hi rend="italic">Butler's Book</hi>, p. 568 note).</p></note>

Hon. Fernando Wood December 12, 1862.</opener>    
<p>My dear Sir Your letter of the 8th. with the accompanying note of same date, was received    
yesterday. The most important paragraph in the letter, as I consider, is in these words: "On the    
25th. November last I was advised by an authority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as    
well as reliable and truthful, that the Southern States would send representatives to the next    
congress, provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarranties or    
terms were asked for other than the amnesty referred to."</p>    
<p>I strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless; nevertheless I thank you for    
communicating it to me.</p>    
<p>Understanding the phrase in the paragraph above quoted "the Southern States would send    
representatives to the next congress"to be substantially the same as that "the people of the    
Southern States would cease resistance, and would re-inaugerate, submit to, and maintain the    
national authority, within the limits of such states under the Constitution of the United    
States,"I say, that in such case, the war would cease on the part of the United States; and    
that, if within a reasonable time "a full and general amnesty"were necessary to such end, it    
would not be withheld.</p>    
<p>I do not think it would be proper now for me to communicate this, formally or informally, to    
the people of the Southern States. My belief is that they already know it; and when they choose,    
if ever, they can communicate with me unequivocally. Nor do I think it proper now to suspend    
military operations to try any experiment of negotiation.</p>    
<p>I should, nevertheless, receive with great pleasure the exact information    
<pb n="554"/>    
    
you now have, and also such other as you may in any way obtain. Such information<ref target="n5-553-2">1</ref>    
might be more valuable before the first of January than afterwards.</p>    
<p>While there is nothing in this letter which I shall dread to see in history, it is, perhaps,    
better for the present, that it's existence should not become public.</p>    
<p>I therefore have to request that you will regard it as confidential. Your Obt. Servt A.

<note id="n5-553-1"><p>1 ADfS, DLC-RTL. Fernando Wood's letter of    
December 8, 1862, reads in part as follows:</p><p>"On the 25th November last I was advised by an    
authority which I deemed likely to be well informed, as well as reliable and truthful that the    
southern states would send representatives to the next congress, provided that a full and general    
amnesty should permit them to do so. No guarantees or terms were asked for other than the amnesty    
referred to. Deeming this information of great value . . . I communicated it . . . to . . .    
George Opdyke . . . whom I knew to hold confidential relations to members of your administration,    
and proposing through him that if the government would permit the correspondence, under its own    
inspection I would undertake to procure something definite &amp; positive from persons connected    
with the so called Confederate authorities. Mr. Opdyke in reply stated that several senators from    
New England . . . were then in this city . . . to whom he would at once communicate the    
proposition and advise me of the answer . . . supposing that they would immediately confer with    
you. . . .</p>    
<p>"I now learn . . . from Mr. Opdyke this day that he failed to see these Senators. . . .    
Therefore the object of this letter.</p>    
<p>"As an humble, but loyal citizen . . . I ask your immediate attention to this subject. . . .    
I suggest that gentlemen whose former social &amp; political relations with the leaders of the    
southern revolt may be allowed to hold unofficial correspondence with them on this subject. . . .    
Your Inaugural address . . . pointed out with prophetic vision. . . . that after a bloody and    
terrible struggle `the still small voice of reason' would intervene and settle the controversy. .    
. . Has not the time arrived when to quote your own language we should `cease fighting'--- at    
least long enough to ascertain whether the `identical questions' about which we began the fight    
may not be amicably &amp; honorably adjusted, and `the terms of intercourse' be once more    
established? It is to this end that I address you. . . ."(DLC-RTL).</p>    
<p>On December 17, Wood replied to Lincoln's letter, "Your letter of the 12th inst. was handed    
to me on the afternoon of the 15th inst. by Mr. Wakeman, the Post-master of this city;---Pardon    
me Mr. President when I say that your reply has filled me with profound regret. It declines what    
I had conceived to be an innocent effort to ascertain the foundation for information in my    
possession of a desire in the South to return to the Union. . . . In compliance with your    
request, that your letter shall not for the present become public I shall withhold its    
publication at this time."(DLC-RTL).</p></note>    
<note id="n5-553-2"><p>2 This paragraph was revised; Lincoln had    
first written: "Any information you may in your own way, obtain upon this subject, I shall be    
glad to receive, if you please. Any such information. . . ."</p></note>
