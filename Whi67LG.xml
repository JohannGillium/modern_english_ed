							<l>The young man that flushes and flushes, and the

							<l>Leaves from you I yield, I write, to be perused best
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterwards, </l>

							<l>Tombleaves, growing up above me, above
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, </l>

							<l>Perennial roots, tall leaves &mdash; O the winter shall not
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freeze you,
								delicate leaves, </l>

							<l>Every year shall you bloom again &mdash; Out from where
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you retired,
								you shall emerge again ; </l>

							<l>O I do not know whether many, passing by, will
								dis-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cover
								you, or inhale your faint odor &mdash; but I
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe a few

							<l>O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you to tell,
								in your own way, of the heart that
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is under you
								; </l>

							<l>O burning and throbbing &mdash; surely all will one day be
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplish'd
								; </l>
							<l>O I do not know what you mean, there underneath
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourselves
								&mdash; you are not happiness, </l>

							<l>You are often more bitter than I can bear &mdash; you burn
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sting me, </l>

							<l>Yet you are very beautiful to me, you faint-tinged
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roots
								&mdash; you make me think of Death, </l>

							<l>Death is beautiful from you &mdash; (what indeed is
								beauti-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ful,
								except Death and Love?) </l>

							<l>O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my

								lovers &mdash; I think it must be for Death, </l>

							<l>For how calm, how solemn it grows, to ascend to the

							<l>Death or life I am then indifferent &mdash; my Soul declines
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to prefer, </l>

							<l>I am not sure but the high Soul of lovers welcomes

							<l>Indeed, O Death, I think now these leaves mean

							<l>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my

							<l>Come, I am determin'd to unbare this broad breast of

							<l>Emblematic and capricious blades, I leave you &mdash; now

							<l>Away! I will say what I have to say, by itself, </l>

							<l>I will escape from the sham that was proposed to
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, </l>

							<l>I will sound myself and comrades only &mdash; I will never

							<l>I will raise with it, immortal reverberations through
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The States, </l>

							<l>I will give an example to lovers, to take permanent
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shape and
								will through The States; </l>

							<l>Through me shall the words be said to make death
								<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exhilarating; </l>

							<l>Give me your tone therefore, O Death, that I may

							<l>Give me yourself &mdash; for I see that you belong to me

								&mdash; you Love and Death are; </l>

							<l>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I

							<l>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons

							<l>That you, beyond them, come forth, to remain, the

						<l>O quick mettle, rich blood, impulse, and love! Good

						<l>O dear to me my birth-things &mdash; All moving things,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the trees

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plants, rivers; </l>

						<l>Dear to me my own slow sluggish rivers where they
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flow, distant,
							over flats of silvery sands, or
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through swamps; </l>

						<l>Dear to me the Roanoke, the Savannah, the

							Pedee, the Tombigbee, the Santee, the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coosa, and the

						<l>O pensive, far away wandering, I return with my Soul
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to haunt their

						<l>Again in Florida I float on transparent lakes &mdash; I float
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the Okeechobee
							&mdash; I cross the hummock land,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or through
							pleasant openings, or dense forests; </l>

						<l>I see the parrots in the woods &mdash; I see the papaw tree
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the
							blossoming titi; </l>

						<l>Again, sailing in my coaster, on deck, I coast off
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Georgia
							&mdash; I coast up the Carolinas, </l>

						<l>I see where the live-oak is growing &mdash; I see where the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yellow-pine, the
							scented bay-tree, the lemon and
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;orange, the
							cypress, the graceful palmetto; </l>







						<pb n="223" id="Whi67LG223"/>



						<l>I pass rude sea-headlands and enter Pamlico Sound
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through an inlet,
							and dart my vision inland; </l>

						<l>O the cotton plant! the growing fields of rice, sugar,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hemp ! </l>

						<l>The cactus, guarded with thorns &mdash; the laurel-tree,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with large white
							flowers; </l>

						<l>The range afar &mdash; the richness and barrenness &mdash; the
							old <lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woods charged

						<l>The piney odor and the gloom &mdash; the awful natural
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stillness, (Here
							in these dense swamps the
							free-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booter
							carries his gun, and the fugitive slave
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has his conceal'd
							hut;) </l>

						<l>O the strange fascination of these half-known,
							half-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impassable
							swamps, infested by reptiles,
							re-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sounding with
							the bellow of the alligator, the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sad noises of the
							night-owl and the wild-cat,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the whirr of
							the rattlesnake; </l>

						<l>The mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing all
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the forenoon
							&mdash; singing through the moon-lit
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night, </l>

						<l>The humming-bird, the wild-turkey, the raccoon, the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opossum; </l>

						<l>A Tennessee corn-field &mdash; the tall, graceful, long-leav'd
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corn &mdash;
							slender, flapping, bright green, with
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tassels
							&mdash; with beautiful ears, each well-sheath'd
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in its husk; </l>

						<l>An Arkansas prairie &mdash; a sleeping lake, or still bayou; </l>

						<l>O my heart! O tender and fierce pangs &mdash; I can stand
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them not
							&mdash; I will depart; </l>

						<l>O to be a Virginian, where I grew up! O to be a
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolinian! </l>

						<l>O longings irrepressible! O I will go back to old
							Ten-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nessee, and
							never wander more! </l>

						<l>All characters, movements, growths &mdash; a few noticed,

						<l>Through Mannahatta's streets I walking, these things

						<l>On interior rivers, by night, in the glare of pine knots,

						<l>Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna,

						<l>In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adirondacks, the
							hills &mdash; or lapping the Saginaw
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters to drink; </l>

						<l>In a lonesome inlet, a sheldrake, lost from the flock,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting on the
							water, rocking silently; </l>

						<l>In farmers' barns, oxen in the stable, their harvest
							la-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bor done-they
							rest standing &mdash; they are too tired; </l>

						<l>Afar on arctic ice, the she-walrus lying drowsily,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while her cubs
							play around; </l>

						<l>The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail'd &mdash; the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farthest polar
							sea, ripply, crystalline, open,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond the floes; </l>

						<l>White drift spooning ahead, where the ship in the

						<l>On solid land, what is done in cities, as the bells all
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strike midnight
							together; </l>

						<l>In primitive woods, the sounds there also sounding &mdash;
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the howl of the
							wolf, the scream of the panther,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hoarse
							bellow of the elk; </l>

						<l>In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lake &mdash;
							in summer visible through the clear
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters, the great

						<l>In lower latitudes, in warmer air, in the Carolinas,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the large black

						<l>Below, the red cedar, festoon'd with tylandria &mdash; the

						<l>Rude boats descending the big Pedee &mdash; climbing

							enveloping huge trees, </l>

						<l>The waving drapery on the live oak, trailing long and
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low, noiselessly
							waved by the wind; </l>

						<l>The camp of Georgia wagoners, just after dark &mdash; the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supper-fires, and
							the cooking and eating by
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whites and

						<l>Thirty or forty great wagons &mdash; the mules, cattle,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horses, feeding

						<l>The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old

							&mdash; the flames &mdash; also the black
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoke from the

						<l>Southern fishermen fishing &mdash; the sounds and inlets of

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the
							herring-fishery &mdash; the large sweep-seines &mdash;
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the windlasses on
							shore work'd by horses &mdash; the

						<l>Deep in the forest, in piney woods, turpentine
							drop-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ping from
							the incisions in the trees &mdash; There are
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the turpentine
							works, </l>

						<l>There are the negroes at work, in good health &mdash; the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground in all

						<l> &mdash; In Tennessee and Kentucky, slaves busy in the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coalings, at the
							forge, by the furnace-blaze, or
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the
							corn-shucking; </l>

						<l>In Virginia, the planter's son returning after a long

							welcom'd and kiss'd by the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aged mulatto
							nurse; </l>

						<l>On rivers, boatmen safely moor'd at night-fall, in their
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boats, under
							shelter of high banks, </l>

						<l>Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;banjo or fiddle
							&mdash; others sit on the gunwale,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smoking and
							talking; </l>

						<l>Late in the afternoon, the mocking

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;
							there are the greenish waters, the resinous

						<l> &mdash; Northward, young men of Mannahatta &mdash; the target

						<l>Children at play &mdash; or on his father's lap a young boy
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fallen asleep,
							(how his lips move! how he
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smiles in his
							sleep!) </l>

						<l>The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Mississippi
							&mdash; he ascends a knoll and sweeps
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his eye around; </l>

						<l>California life &mdash; the miner, bearded, dress'd in his
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rude costume
							&mdash; the stanch California friendship
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash; the
							sweet air &mdash; the graves one, in passing.
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meets, solitary,
							just aside the horse-path; </l>

						<l>Down in Texas, the cotton-field, the negro-cabins &mdash;

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;
							cotton-bales piled on banks and wharves; </l>

						<l>Encircling all, vast-darting, up and wide, the American

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dilation or
							Pride; </l>

						<l> &mdash; In arriere, the peace-talk with the Iroquois, the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aborigines
							&mdash; the calumet, the pipe of good-will
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arbitration, and
							indorsement, </l>

						<l>The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sum
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then toward
							the earth, </l>

						<l>The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faces and

						<l>The setting out of the war-party &mdash; the long and

						<l>The single-file &mdash; the swinging hatchets &mdash; the

						<l> &mdash; All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of These

						<l>All These States, compact &mdash; Every square mile of

						<l>Me pleased, rambling in lanes and country fields,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paumanok's

						<l>Me, observing the spiral flight of two little yellow

							shuffling between each other,

						<l>The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects &mdash; the

							southward, but returning
							north-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ward early
							in the spring; </l>

						<l>The country boy at the close of the day, driving the

							by the road-side; </l>

						<l>The city wharf &mdash; Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charleston, New

						<l>The departing ships, when the sailors heave at the
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capstan; </l>

						<l>Evening &mdash; me in my room &mdash; the setting sun, </l>

						<l>The setting summer sun shining in my open window,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;showing the swarm
							of flies, suspended,
							balanc-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ing in the
							air in the centre of the room, darting
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;athwart, up and
							down, casting swift shadows in
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;specks on the
							opposite wall, where the shine is; </l>

						<l>The athletic American matron speaking in public to
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crowds of

						<l>Males, females, immigrants, combinations &mdash; the
							co-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piousness
							&mdash; the individuality of The States, each
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for itself
							&mdash; the money-makers; </l>

						<l>Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces &mdash; the

						<l>The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, </l>

						<l>In space, the sporades, the scattered islands, the stars

							the firm earth, the lands, my lands, </l>

						<l>O lands! all so dear to me &mdash; what you are, (whatever

						<l>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow

						<l>Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of

							with parties of snowy herons wading
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wet to
							seek worms and aquatic plants; </l>

						<l>Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from piercing the
							crow with its bill, for

							&mdash; And I triumphantly twittering; </l>

						<l>The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn

							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and taking turns
							with the rest; </l>

						<l>In Kanadian forests, the moose, large as an ox,
							cor-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ner'd by
							hunters, rising desperately on his
							hind-<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet, and
							plunging with his fore-feet, the hoofs

						<l>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping,

						<l>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof &mdash; and
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no less in myself
							than the whole of the

							itself, </l>

						<l>Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands &mdash; my
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body no more
							inevitably united, part to part,
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made one
							identity, any more than my lands
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are inevitably

						<l>Nativities, climates, the grass of the great Pastoral

						<l>Cities, labors, death, animals, products, good and evil
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;

						<l>These affording, in all their particulars, endless

							and to America, how can I do
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less than pass
							the clew of the union of them, to

						<l>Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaves, that you

						<l>How can I but, as here, chanting, invite you for

						<l>Because I see that word nested in nests of water-bays,

						<l>Rich, hemm'd thick all around with sailships and

						<l>The flowing sea-currents, the little islands, larger

						<l>Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant

						<l>'Tis a large old church, at the crossing roads &mdash; 'tis now

						<l>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving

						<l>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in

						<l>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers,

						<l>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders
							<lb/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or calls; </l>

						<l>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the
