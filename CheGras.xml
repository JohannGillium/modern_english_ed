<head>THE GRASSHOPPER <lb/> I</head>

<p>ALL Olga Ivanovna's friends and acquaintances were
at her wedding.

</p><p>"Look at him; isn't it true that there is something
in him?" she said to her friends, with a nod towards
her husband, as though she wanted to explain why
she was marrying a simple, very ordinary, and in no
way remarkable man.

</p><p>Her husband, Osip Stepanitch Dymov, was a doctor, and only of the
rank of a titular councillor. He was on the staff of two hospitals: in
one a ward-surgeon and in the other a dissecting demonstrator.  Every
day from nine to twelve he saw patients and was busy in his ward, and
after twelve o'clock he went by tram to the other hospital, where he
dissected. His private practice was a small one, not worth more than
five hundred roubles a year. That was all. What more could one say about
him?  Meanwhile, Olga Ivanovna and her friends and acquaintances were
not quite ordinary people.  Every one of them was remarkable in some
way, and more or less famous; already had made a reputation and was
looked upon as a celebrity; or if not yet a celebrity, gave brilliant
promise of becoming one. There was an actor from the Dramatic Theatre,
who was a




   <pb n="90"/>

great talent of established reputation, as well as an elegant,
intelligent, and modest man, and a capital elocutionist, and who taught
Olga Ivanovna to recite; there was a singer from the opera, a
good-natured, fat man who assured Olga Ivanovna, with a sigh, that she
was ruining herself, that if she would take herself in hand and not be
lazy she might make a remarkable singer; then there were several
artists, and chief among them Ryabovsky, a very handsome, fair young man
of five-and-twenty who painted genre pieces, animal studies, and
landscapes, was successful at exhibitions, and had sold his last picture
for five hundred roubles. He touched up Olga Ivanovna's sketches, and
used to say she might do something. Then a violoncellist, whose
instrument used to sob, and who openly declared that of all the ladies
of his acquaintance the only one who could accompany him was Olga
Ivanovna; then there was a literary man, young but already well known,
who had written stories, novels, and plays. Who else?  Why, Vassily
Vassilyitch, a landowner and amateur illustrator and vignettist, with a
great feeling for the old Russian style, the old ballad and epic. On
paper, on china, and on smoked plates, he produced literally marvels. In
the midst of this free artistic company, spoiled by fortune, though
refined and modest, who recalled the existence of doctors only in times
of illness, and to whom the name of Dymov sounded in no way different
from Sidorov or Tarasov &mdash; in the midst of this company Dymov seemed
strange, not wanted, and small, though he was tall and broad-shouldered.
He looked as though he


   <pb n="91"/>

had on somebody else's coat, and his beard was like
a shopman's. Though if he had been a writer or an
artist, they would have said that his beard reminded
them of Zola.
</p><p>An artist said to Olga Ivanovna that with her
flaxen hair and in her wedding-dress she was very
much like a graceful cherry-tree when it is covered
all over with delicate white blossoms in spring.

</p><p>"Oh, let me tell you," said Olga Ivanovna, taking his arm, "how
it was it all came to pass so suddenly.  Listen, listen! . . . I must
tell you that my father was on the same staff at the hospital as Dymov.
When my poor father was taken ill, Dymov watched for days and nights
together at his bedside.  Such self-sacrifice! Listen, Ryabovsky! You,
my writer, listen; it is very interesting! Come nearer.  Such
self-sacrifice, such genuine sympathy! I sat up with my father, and did
not sleep for nights, either.  And all at once &mdash; the princess had won
the hero's heart &mdash; my Dymov fell head over ears in love.  Really, fate
is so strange at times! Well, after my father's death he came to see me
sometimes, met me in the street, and one fine evening, all at once he
made me an offer . . . like snow upon my head.
. . . I lay awake all night, crying, and fell hellishly
in love myself. And here, as you see, I am his wife.  There really is
something strong, powerful, bearlike about him, isn't there? Now his
face is turned three-quarters towards us in a bad light, but when he
turns round look at his forehead. Ryabovsky, what do you say to that
forehead? Dymov, we are talking about you!" she called to her husband.
"Come


   <pb n="92"/>

here; hold out your honest hand to Ryabovsky. . . .
That's right, be friends."
</p><p>Dymov, with a naive and good-natured smile, held
out his hand to Ryabovsky, and said:

</p><p>"Very glad to meet you. There was a Ryabovsky in my year at the
medical school. Was he a relation of yours?"
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d4">
<head>II</head>


<p>Olga Ivanovna was twenty-two, Dymov was thirty-one. They got on
splendidly together when they were married. Olga Ivanovna hung all her
drawing-room walls with her own and other people's sketches, in frames
and without frames, and near the piano and furniture arranged
picturesque corners with Japanese parasols, easels, daggers, busts,
photographs, and rags of many colours. . . . In the dining-room she
papered the walls with peasant woodcuts, hung up bark shoes and sickles,
stood in a corner a scythe and a rake, and so achieved a dining-room in
the Russian style. In her bedroom she draped the ceiling and the walls
with dark cloths to make it like a cavern, hung a Venetian lantern over
the beds, and at the door set a figure with a halberd.  And every one
thought that the young people had a very charming little home.

</p><p>When she got up at eleven o'clock every morning,
Olga Ivanovna played the piano or, if it were sunny,
painted something in oils. Then between twelve and
one she drove to her dressmaker's. As Dymov and
she had very little money, only just enough, she and


   <pb n="93"/>

her dressmaker were often put to clever shifts to enable her to appear
constantly in new dresses and make a sensation with them. Very often out
of an old dyed dress, out of bits of tulle, lace, plush, and silk,
costing nothing, perfect marvels were created, something bewitching &mdash;
not a dress, but a dream.  From the dressmaker's Olga Ivanovna usually
drove to some actress of her acquaintance to hear the latest theatrical
gossip, and incidentally to try and get hold of tickets for the first
night of some new play or for a benefit performance. From the actress's
she had to go to some artist's studio or to some exhibition or to see
some celebrity &mdash; either to pay a visit or to give an invitation or
simply to have a chat. And everywhere she met with a gay and friendly
welcome, and was assured that she was good, that she was sweet, that she
was rare. . . . Those whom she called great and famous received her as
one of themselves, as an equal, and predicted with one voice that, with
her talents, her taste, and her intelligence, she would do great things
if she concentrated herself. She sang, she played the piano, she painted
in oils, she carved, she took part in amateur performances; and all this
not just anyhow, but all with talent, whether she made lanterns for an
illumination or dressed up or tied somebody's cravat &mdash; everything she
did was exceptionally graceful, artistic, and charming. But her talents
showed themselves in nothing so clearly as in her faculty for quickly
becoming acquainted and on intimate terms with celebrated people. No
sooner did any one become ever so little celebrated, and set people
talking about him,


   <pb n="94"/>

than she made his acquaintance, got on friendly terms the same day, and
invited him to her house.  Every new acquaintance she made was a
veritable f&ecirc;te for her. She adored celebrated people, was proud of
them, dreamed of them every night. She craved for them, and never could
satisfy her craving. The old ones departed and were forgotten, new ones
came to replace them, but to these, too, she soon grew accustomed or was
disappointed in them, and began eagerly seeking for fresh great men,
finding them and seeking for them again. What for?

</p><p>Between four and five she dined at home with her husband. His
simplicity, good sense, and kind-heartedness touched her and moved her
up to enthusiasm. She was constantly jumping up, impulsively hugging his
head and showering kisses on it.

</p><p>"You are a clever, generous man, Dymov," she
used to say, "but you have one very serious defect.
You take absolutely no interest in art. You don't
believe in music or painting."
</p><p>"I don't understand them," he would say mildly.
"I have spent all my life in working at natural
science and medicine, and I have never had time to
take an interest in the arts."
</p><p>"But, you know, that's awful, Dymov!"

</p><p>"Why so? Your friends don't know anything of science or medicine,
but you don't reproach them with it. Every one has his own line. I don't
understand landscapes and operas, but the way I look at it is that if
one set of sensible people devote their whole lives to them, and other
sensible people pay


   <pb n="95"/>

immense sums for them, they must be of use. I
don't understand them, but not understanding does
not imply disbelieving in them."
</p><p>"Let me shake your honest hand!"
</p><p>After dinner Olga Ivanovna would drive off to
see her friends, then to a theatre or to a concert,
and she returned home after midnight. So it was
every day.

</p><p>On Wednesdays she had "At Homes." At these "At Homes" the hostess
and her guests did not play cards and did not dance, but entertained
themselves with various arts. An actor from the Dramatic Theatre
recited, a singer sang, artists sketched in the albums of which Olga
Ivanovna had a great number, the violoncellist played, and the hostess
herself sketched, carved, sang, and played accompaniments.  In the
intervals between the recitations, music, and singing, they talked and
argued about literature, the theatre, and painting. There were no
ladies, for Olga Ivanovna considered all ladies wearisome and vulgar
except actresses and her dressmaker. Not one of these entertainments
passed without the hostess starting at every ring at the bell, and
saying, with a triumphant expression, "It is he," meaning by "he," of
course, some new celebrity. Dymov was not in the drawing-room, and no
one remembered his existence. But exactly at half-past eleven the door
leading into the dining-room opened, and Dymov would appear with his
good-natured, gentle smile and say, rubbing his hands:

</p><p>"Come to supper, gentlemen."
</p><p>They all went into the dining-room, and every


   <pb n="96"/>

time found on the table exactly the same things: a
dish of oysters, a piece of ham or veal, sardines,
cheese, caviare, mushrooms, vodka, and two decanters of wine.
</p><p>"My dear <foreign lang="fr">m&acirc;itre d'
h&ocirc;tel!</foreign>" Olga Ivanovna
would say, clasping her hands with enthusiasm, "you
are simply fascinating! My friends, look at his
forehead! Dymov, turn your profile. Look! he
has the face of a Bengal tiger and an expression as
kind and sweet as a gazelle. Ah, the darling!"
</p><p>The visitors ate, and, looking at Dymov, thought,
"He really is a nice fellow"; but they soon forgot
about him, and went on talking about the theatre,
music, and painting.
</p><p>The young people were happy, and their life
flowed on without a hitch.

</p><p>The third week of their honeymoon was spent, however, not quite
happily &mdash; sadly, indeed. Dymov caught erysipelas in the hospital, was
in bed for six days, and had to have his beautiful black hair cropped.
Olga Ivanovna sat beside him and wept bitterly, but when he was better
she put a white handkerchief on his shaven head and began to paint him
as a Bedouin. And they were both in good spirits. Three days after he
had begun to go back to the hospital he had another mischance.

</p><p>"I have no luck, little mother," he said one day
at dinner. "I had four dissections to do today, and
I cut two of my fingers at one. And I did not notice
it till I got home."
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna was alarmed. He smiled, and


   <pb n="97"/>

told her that it did not matter, and that he often
cut his hands when he was dissecting.
</p><p>"I get absorbed, little mother, and grow careless."

</p><p>Olga Ivanovna dreaded symptoms of blood-poisoning, and prayed
about it every night, but all went well. And again life flowed on
peaceful and happy, free from grief and anxiety. The present was happy,
and to follow it spring was at hand, already smiling in the distance,
and promising a thousand delights. There would be no end to their
happiness. In April, May and June a summer villa a good distance out of
town; walks, sketching, fishing, nightingales; and then from July right
on to autumn an artist's tour on the Volga, and in this tour Olga
Ivanovna would take part as an indispensable member of the society. She
had already had made for her two travelling dresses of linen, had bought
paints, brushes, canvases, and a new palette for the journey. Almost
every day Ryabovsky visited her to see what progress she was making in
her painting; when she showed him her painting, he used to thrust his
hands deep into his pockets, compress his lips, sniff, and say:

</p><p>" Ye&mdash;es . . . ! That cloud of yours is screaming: it's not in
the evening light. The foreground is somehow chewed up, and there is
something, you know, not the thing. . . . And your cottage is weighed
down and whines pitifully. That corner ought to have been taken more in
shadow, but on the whole it is not bad; I like it."


   <pb n="98"/>

</p><p>And the more incomprehensible he talked, the
more readily Olga Ivanovna understood him.
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d5">
<head>III</head>

<p>After dinner on the second day of Trinity week,
Dymov bought some sweets and some savouries and
went down to the villa to see his wife. He had not
seen her for a fortnight, and missed her terribly.
As he sat in the train and afterwards as he looked
for his villa in a big wood, he felt all the while
hungry and weary, and dreamed of how he would
have supper in freedom with his wife, then tumble
into bed and to sleep. And he was delighted as he
looked at his parcel, in which there was caviare,
cheese, and white salmon.

</p><p>The sun was setting by the time he found his villa and recognized
it. The old servant told him that her mistress was not at home, but that
most likely she would soon be in. The villa, very uninviting in
appearance, with low ceilings papered with writing-paper and with uneven
floors full of crevices, consisted only of three rooms. In one there was
a bed, in the second there were canvases, brushes, greasy papers, and
men's overcoats and hats lying about on the chairs and in the windows,
while in the third Dymov found three unknown men; two were dark-haired
and had beards, the other was clean-shaven and fat, apparently an actor.
There was a samovar boiling on the table.

</p><p>"What do you want?" asked the actor in a bass
voice, looking at Dymov ungraciously. "Do you


   <pb n="99"/>

want Olga Ivanovna? Wait a minute; she will be
here directly."

</p><p>Dymov sat down and waited. One of the dark-haired men, looking
sleepily and listlessly at him, poured himself out a glass of tea, and
asked:

</p><p>"Perhaps you would like some tea?"

</p><p>Dymov was both hungry and thirsty, but he refused tea for fear of
spoiling his supper. Soon he heard footsteps and a familiar laugh; a
door slammed, and Olga Ivanovna ran into the room, wearing a
wide-brimmed hat and carrying a box in her hand; she was followed by
Ryabovsky, rosy and good-humoured, carrying a big umbrella and a
camp-stool.

</p><p>"Dymov!" cried Olga Ivanovna, and she flushed
crimson with pleasure. "Dymov!" she repeated,
laying her head and both arms on his bosom. "Is
that you? Why haven't you come for so long?
Why? Why?"
</p><p>"When could I, little mother? I am always busy,
and whenever I am free it always happens somehow
that the train does not fit."

</p><p>"But how glad I am to see you! I have been dreaming about you the
whole night, the whole night, and I was afraid you must be ill. Ah! if
you only knew how sweet you are! You have come in the nick of time! You
will be my salvation! You are the only person who can save me! There is
to be a most original wedding here tomorrow," she went on, laughing, and
tying her husband's cravat. "A young telegraph clerk at the station,
called Tchikeldyeev, is going to be married. He is a handsome


   <pb n="100"/>

young man and &mdash; well, not stupid, and you know there is something
strong, bearlike in his face . . .  you might paint him as a young
Norman. We summer visitors take a great interest in him, and have
promised to be at his wedding. . . . He is a lonely, timid man, not well
off, and of course it would be a shame not to be sympathetic to him.
Fancy! the wedding will be after the service; then we shall all walk
from the church to the bride's lodgings . . .  you see the wood, the
birds singing, patches of sunlight on the grass, and all of us spots of
different colours against the bright green background &mdash; very original,
in the style of the French impressionists.  But, Dymov, what am I to go
to the church in?"  said Olga Ivanovna, and she looked as though she
were going to cry. "I have nothing here, literally nothing! no dress, no
flowers, no gloves . . . you must save me. Since you have come, fate
itself bids you save me. Take the keys, my precious, go home and get my
pink dress from the wardrobe. You remember it; it hangs in front. . . .
Then, in the storeroom, on the floor, on the right side, you will see
two cardboard boxes. When you open the top one you will see tulle, heaps
of tulle and rags of all sorts, and under them flowers. Take out all the
flowers carefully, try not to crush them, darling; I will choose among
them later. . . . And buy me some gloves."

</p><p>"Very well!" said Dymov; "I will go tomorrow
and send them to you."
</p><p>"Tomorrow?" asked Olga Ivanovna, and she
looked at him surprised. "You won't have time tomorrow.


   <pb n="101"/>

The first train goes tomorrow at nine, and
the wedding's at eleven. No, darling, it must be
today; it absolutely must be today. If you won't be
able to come tomorrow, send them by a messenger.
Come, you must run along. . . . The passenger
train will be in directly; don't miss it, darling."
</p><p>"Very well."
</p><p>"Oh, how sorry I am to let you go!" said Olga
Ivanovna, and tears came into her eyes. "And
why did I promise that telegraph clerk, like a silly?"
</p><p>Dymov hurriedly drank a glass of tea, took a
cracknel, and, smiling gently, went to the station.
And the caviare, the cheese, and the white salmon
were eaten by the two dark gentlemen and the fat
actor.
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d6">
<head>IV</head>

<p>On a still moonlight night in July Olga Ivanovna was standing on
the deck of a Volga steamer and looking alternately at the water and at
the picturesque banks. Beside her was standing Ryabovsky, telling her
the black shadows on the water were not shadows, but a dream, that it
would be sweet to sink into forgetfulness, to die, to become a memory in
the sight of that enchanted water with the fantastic glimmer, in sight
of the fathomless sky and the mournful, dreamy shores that told of the
vanity of our life and of the existence of something higher, blessed,
and eternal. The past was vulgar and uninteresting, the future was
trivial, and that marvellous night, unique in a lifetime, would soon be
over, would blend with eternity; then, why live?


   <pb n="102"/>

</p><p>And Olga Ivanovna listened alternately to Ryabovsky's voice and
the silence of the night, and thought of her being immortal and never
dying.  The turquoise colour of the water, such as she had never seen
before, the sky, the river-banks, the black shadows, and the
unaccountable joy that flooded her soul, all told her that she would
make a great artist, and that somewhere in the distance, in the infinite
space beyond the moonlight, success, glory, the love of the people, lay
awaiting her. . . . When she gazed steadily without blinking into the
distance, she seemed to see crowds of people, lights, triumphant strains
of music, cries of enthusiasm, she herself in a white dress, and flowers
showered upon her from all sides. She thought, too, that beside her,
leaning with his elbows on the rail of the steamer, there was standing a
real great man, a genius, one of God's elect. . . . All that he had
created up to the present was fine, new, and extraordinary, but what he
would create in time, when with maturity his rare talent reached its
full development, would be astounding, immeasurably sublime; and that
could be seen by his face, by his manner of expressing himself and his
attitude to nature. He talked of shadows, of the tones of evening, of
the moonlight, in a special way, in a language of his own, so that one
could not help feeling the fascination of his power over nature. He was
very handsome, original, and his life, free, independent, aloof from all
common cares, was like the life of a bird.

</p><p>"It's growing cooler," said Olga Ivanovna, and
she gave a shudder.


   <pb n="103"/>

</p><p>Ryabovsky wrapped her in his cloak, and said
mournfully:
</p><p>"I feel that I am in your power; I am a slave.
Why are you so enchanting today?"
</p><p>He kept staring intently at her, and his eyes were
terrible. And she was afraid to look at him.
</p><p>"I love you madly," he whispered, breathing on
her cheek. "Say one word to me and I will not go
on living; I will give up art . . ." he muttered in
violent emotion. "Love me, love . . ."

</p><p>"Don't talk like that," said Olga Ivanovna, covering her eyes.
"It's dreadful! How about Dymov?"

</p><p>"What of Dymov? Why Dymov? What have I to do with Dymov? The
Volga, the moon, beauty, my love, ecstasy, and there is no such thing as
Dymov. . . . Ah! I don't know . . . I don't care about the past; give me
one moment, one instant!"

</p><p>Olga Ivanovna's heart began to throb. She tried
to think about her husband, but all her past, with her
wedding, with Dymov, and with her "At Homes,"
seemed to her petty, trivial, dingy, unnecessary, and
far, far away. . . . Yes, really, what of Dymov?
Why Dymov? What had she to do with Dymov?
Had he any existence in nature, or was he only a
dream?

</p><p>"For him, a simple and ordinary man the happiness he has had
already is enough," she thought, covering her face with her hands. "Let
them con-demn me, let them curse me, but in spite of them all I will go
to my ruin; I will go to my ruin! . . . One


   <pb n="104"/>

must experience everything in life. My God! how
terrible and how glorious!"
</p><p>"Well? Well?" muttered the artist, embracing
her, and greedily kissing the hands with which she
feebly tried to thrust him from her. "You love
me? Yes? Yes? Oh, what a night! marvellous
night!"
</p><p>"Yes, what a night!" she whispered, looking
into his eyes, which were bright with tears.
</p><p>Then she looked round quickly, put her arms
round him, and kissed him on the lips.
</p><p>"We are nearing Kineshmo!" said some one on
the other side of the deck.
</p><p>They heard heavy footsteps; it was a waiter from
the refreshment-bar.

</p><p>"Waiter," said Olga Ivanovna, laughing and crying with happiness,
"bring us some wine."

</p><p>The artist, pale with emotion, sat on the seat,
looking at Olga Ivanovna with adoring, grateful
eyes; then he closed his eyes, and said, smiling languidly:

</p><p>"I am tired."
</p><p>And he leaned his head against the rail.

<p>On the second of September the day was warm and
still, but overcast. In the early morning a light mist
had hung over the Volga, and after nine o'clock it
had begun to spout with rain. And there seemed no
hope of the sky clearing. Over their morning tea
Ryabovsky told Olga Ivanovna that painting was the


   <pb n="105"/>

most ungrateful and boring art, that he was not an artist, that none but
fools thought that he had any talent, and all at once, for no rhyme or
reason, he snatched up a knife and with it scraped over his very best
sketch. After his tea he sat plunged in gloom at the window and gazed at
the Volga. And now the Volga was dingy, all of one even colour without a
gleam of light, cold-looking. Everything, everything recalled the
approach of dreary, gloomy autumn. And it seemed as though nature had
removed now from the Volga the sumptuous green covers from the banks,
the brilliant reflections of the sunbeams, the transparent blue
distance, and all its smart gala array, and had packed it away in boxes
till the coming spring, and the crows were flying above the Volga and
crying tauntingly, "Bare, bare!"

</p><p>Ryabovsky heard their cawing, and thought he had already gone off
and lost his talent, that everything in this world was relative,
conditional, and stupid, and that he ought not to have taken up with
this woman. . . . In short, he was out of humour and depressed.

</p><p>Olga Ivanovna sat behind the screen on the bed, and, passing her
fingers through her lovely flaxen hair, pictured herself first in the
drawing-room, then in the bedroom, then in her husband's study; her
imagination carried her to the theatre, to the dress-maker, to her
distinguished friends. Were they getting something up now? Did they
think of her?  The season had begun by now, and it would be time to
think about her "At Homes." And Dymov?


   <pb n="106"/>

Dear Dymov! with what gentleness and childlike pathos he kept begging
her in his letters to make haste and come home! Every month he sent her
seventy-five roubles, and when she wrote him that she had lent the
artists a hundred roubles, he sent that hundred too. What a kind,
generous-hearted man! The travelling wearied Olga Ivanovna; she was
bored; and she longed to get away from the peasants, from the damp smell
of the river, and to cast off the feeling of physical uncleanliness of
which she was conscious all the time, living in the peasants' huts and
wandering from village to village. If Ryabovsky had not given his word
to the artists that he would stay with them till the twentieth of
September, they might have gone away that very day. And how nice that
would have been!

</p><p>"My God!" moaned Ryabovsky. "Will the
sun ever come out? I can't go on with a sunny
landscape without the sun. . . ."
</p><p>"But you have a sketch with a cloudy sky," said
Olga Ivanovna, coming from behind the screen.
"Do you remember, in the right foreground forest
trees, on the left a herd of cows and geese? You
might finish it now."
</p><p>"Aie!" the artist scowled. "Finish it! Can
you imagine I am such a fool that I don't know
what I want to do?"
</p><p>"How you have changed to me!" sighed Olga
Ivanovna.
</p><p>"Well, a good thing too!"
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna's face quivered; she moved away
to the stove and began to cry.


   <pb n="107"/>

</p><p>"Well, that's the last straw &mdash; crying! Give
over! I have a thousand reasons for tears, but I
am not crying."

</p><p>"A thousand reasons!" cried Olga Ivanovna.  "The chief one is
that you are weary of me. Yes!"  she said, and broke into sobs. "If one
is to tell the truth, you are ashamed of our love. You keep trying to
prevent the artists from noticing it, though it is impossible to conceal
it, and they have known all about it for ever so long."

</p><p>"Olga, one thing I beg you," said the artist in an
imploring voice, laying his hand on his heart &mdash; "one
thing, don't worry me! I want nothing else from
you!"
</p><p>"But swear that you love me still!"

</p><p>"This is agony!" the artist hissed through his teeth, and he
jumped up. "It will end by my throwing myself in the Volga or going out
of my mind!  Let me alone!"

</p><p>"Come, kill me, kill me!" cried Olga Ivanovna.
"Kill me!"
</p><p>She sobbed again, and went behind the screen.
There was a swish of rain on the straw thatch of
the hut. Ryabovsky clutched his head and strode
up and down the hut; then with a resolute face, as
though bent on proving something to somebody, put
on his cap, slung his gun over his shoulder, and went
out of the hut.

</p><p>After he had gone, Olga Ivanovna lay a long time on the bed,
crying. At first she thought it would be a good thing to poison herself,
so that when Ryabovsky came back he would find her dead; then her


   <pb n="108"/>

imagination carried her to her drawing-room, to her husband's study, and
she imagined herself sitting motionless beside Dymov and enjoying the
physical peace and cleanliness, and in the evening sitting in the
theatre, listening to Mazini. And a yearning for civilization, for the
noise and bustle of the town, for celebrated people sent a pang to her
heart. A peasant woman came into the hut and began in a leisurely way
lighting the stove to get the dinner.  There was a smell of charcoal
fumes, and the air was filled with bluish smoke. The artists came in, in
muddy high boots and with faces wet with rain, examined their sketches,
and comforted themselves by saying that the Volga had its charms even in
bad weather. On the wall the cheap clock went "tic-tic-tic." . . . The
flies, feeling chilled, crowded round the ikon in the corner, buzzing,
and one could hear the cockroaches scurrying about among the thick
portfolios under the seats. . . .

</p><p>Ryabovsky came home as the sun was setting.
He flung his cap on the table, and, without removing
his muddy boots, sank pale and exhausted on the
bench and closed his eyes.

</p><p>"I am tired . . ." he said, and twitched his eyebrows, trying to
raise his eyelids.

</p><p>To be nice to him and to show she was not cross,
Olga Ivanovna went up to him, gave him a silent
kiss, and passed the comb through his fair hair.
She meant to comb it for him.

</p><p>"What's that?" he said, starting as though something cold had
touched him, and he opened his eyes.  "What is it? Please let me alone."


   <pb n="109"/>

</p><p>He thrust her off, and moved away. And it
seemed to her that there was a look of aversion and
annoyance on his face.
</p><p>At that time the peasant woman cautiously carried
him, in both hands, a plate of cabbage-soup. And
Olga Ivanovna saw how she wetted her fat fingers
in it. And the dirty peasant woman, standing with
her body thrust forward, and the cabbage-soup which
Ryabovsky began eating greedily, and the hut, and
their whole way of life, which she at first had so
loved for its simplicity and artistic disorder, seemed
horrible to her now. She suddenly felt insulted, and
said coldly:
</p><p>"We must part for a time, or else from boredom
we shall quarrel in earnest. I am sick of this; I am
going today."
</p><p>"Going how? Astride on a broomstick?"
</p><p>"Today is Thursday, so the steamer will be here
at half-past nine."
</p><p>"Eh? Yes, yes. . . . Well, go, then . . ."
Ryabovsky said softly, wiping his mouth with a
towel instead of a dinner napkin. "You are dull
and have nothing to do here, and one would have
to be a great egoist to try and keep you. Go home,
and we shall meet again after the twentieth."
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna packed in good spirits. Her
cheeks positively glowed with pleasure. Could it
really be true, she asked herself, that she would
soon be writing in her drawing-room and sleeping in
her bedroom, and dining with a cloth on the table?
A weight was lifted from her heart, and she no
longer felt angry with the artist.


   <pb n="110"/>

</p><p>"My paints and brushes I will leave with you, Ryabovsky," she
said. "You can bring what's left.
. . . Mind, now, don't be lazy here when I am
gone; don't mope, but work. You are such a splendid fellow, Ryabovsky!"

</p><p>At ten o'clock Ryabovsky gave her a farewell kiss,
in order, as she thought, to avoid kissing her on the
steamer before the artists, and went with her to
the landing-stage. The steamer soon came up and
carried her away.
</p><p>She arrived home two and a half days later.
Breathless with excitement, she went, without taking
off her hat or waterproof, into the drawing-room
and thence into the dining-room. Dymov, with his
waistcoat unbuttoned and no coat, was sitting at the
table sharpening a knife on a fork; before him lay
a grouse on a plate. As Olga Ivanovna went into
the flat she was convinced that it was essential to
hide everything from her husband, and that she
would have the strength and skill to do so; but now,
when she saw his broad, mild, happy smile, and
shining, joyful eyes, she felt that to deceive this man
was as vile, as revolting, and as impossible and out
of her power as to bear false witness, to steal, or
to kill, and in a flash she resolved to tell him all
that had happened. Letting him kiss and embrace
her, she sank down on her knees before him and
hid her face.
</p><p>"What is it, what is it, little mother?" he asked
tenderly. "Were you homesick?"
</p><p>She raised her face, red with shame, and gazed
at him with a guilty and imploring look, but fear


   <pb n="111"/>

and shame prevented her from telling him the truth.
</p><p>"Nothing," she said; "it's just nothing. . . ."

</p><p>"Let us sit down," he said, raising her and seating her at the
table. "That's right, eat the grouse.  You are starving, poor darling."

</p><p>She eagerly breathed in the atmosphere of home and ate the
grouse, while he watched her with tenderness and laughed with delight.
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d8">
<head>VI</head>

<p>Apparently, by the middle of the winter Dymov began to suspect
that he was being deceived. As though his conscience was not clear, he
could not look his wife straight in the face, did not smile with delight
when he met her, and to avoid being left alone with her, he often
brought in to dinner his colleague, Korostelev, a little close-cropped
man with a wrinkled face, who kept buttoning and unbuttoning his reefer
jacket with embarrassment when he talked with Olga Ivanovna, and then
with his right hand nipped his left moustache. At dinner the two doctors
talked about the fact that a displacement of the diaphragm was sometimes
accompanied by irregularities of the heart, or that a great number of
neurotic complaints were met with of late, or that Dymov had the day
before found a cancer of the lower abdomen while dissecting a corpse
with the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia. And it seemed as though they
were talking of medicine to give Olga Ivanovna a chance of being silent
&mdash; that is, of not lying. After dinner Korostelev sat down to


   <pb n="112"/>

the piano, while Dymov sighed and said to him:
</p><p>"Ech, brother &mdash; well, well! Play something
melancholy."

</p><p>Hunching up his shoulders and stretching his
fingers wide apart, Korostelev played some chords
and began singing in a tenor voice, "Show me the
abode where the Russian peasant would not groan,"
while Dymov sighed once more, propped his head
on his fist, and sank into thought.

</p><p>Olga Ivanovna had been extremely imprudent in her conduct of
late. Every morning she woke up in a very bad humour and with the
thought that she no longer cared for Ryabovsky, and that, thank God, it
was all over now. But as she drank her coffee she reflected that
Ryabovsky had robbed her of her husband, and that now she was left with
neither her husband nor Ryabovsky; then she remembered talks she had
heard among her acquaintances of a picture Ryabovsky was preparing for
the exhibition, something striking, a mixture of genre and landscape, in
the style of Polyenov, about which every one who had been into his
studio went into raptures; and this, of course, she mused, he had
created under her influence, and altogether, thanks to her influence, he
had greatly changed for the better. Her influence was so beneficent and
essential that if she were to leave him he might perhaps go to ruin. And
she remembered, too, that the last time he had come to see her in a
great-coat with flecks on it and a new tie, he had asked her languidly:

</p><p>"Am I beautiful?"
</p><p>And with his elegance, his long curls, and his blue


   <pb n="113"/>

eyes, he really was very beautiful (or perhaps it
only seemed so), and he had been affectionate to
her.

</p><p>Considering and remembering many things Olga Ivanovna dressed and
in great agitation drove to Ryabovsky's studio. She found him in high
spirits, and enchanted with his really magnificent picture.  He was
dancing about and playing the fool and answering serious questions with
jokes. Olga Ivanovna was jealous of the picture and hated it, but from
politeness she stood before the picture for five minutes in silence,
and, heaving a sigh, as though before a holy shrine, said softly:

</p><p>"Yes, you have never painted anything like it
before. Do you know, it is positively awe-inspiring?"

</p><p>And then she began beseeching him to love her and not to cast her
off, to have pity on her in her misery and her wretchedness. She shed
tears, kissed his hands, insisted on his swearing that he loved her,
told him that without her good influence he would go astray and be
ruined. And, when she had spoilt his good-humour, feeling herself
humiliated, she would drive off to her dressmaker or to an actress of
her acquaintance to try and get theatre tickets.

</p><p>If she did not find him at his studio she left a letter in which
she swore that if he did not come to see her that day she would poison
herself. He was scared, came to see her, and stayed to dinner.
Regardless of her husband's presence, he would say rude things to her,
and she would answer him in


   <pb n="114"/>

the same way. Both felt they were a burden to
each other, that they were tyrants and enemies, and
were wrathful, and in their wrath did not notice
that their behaviour was unseemly, and that even
Korostelev, with his close-cropped head, saw it all.
After dinner Ryabovsky made haste to say good-bye
and get away.

</p><p>"Where are you off to?" Olga Ivanovna would
ask him in the hall, looking at him with hatred.

</p><p>Scowling and screwing up his eyes, he mentioned some lady of
their acquaintance, and it was evident that he was laughing at her
jealousy and wanted to annoy her. She went to her bedroom and lay down
on her bed; from jealousy, anger, a sense of humiliation and shame, she
bit the pillow and began sobbing aloud. Dymov left Korostelev in the
drawing-room, went into the bedroom, and with a desperate and
embarrassed face said softly:

</p><p>"Don't cry so loud, little mother; there's no need.  You must be
quiet about it. You must not let people see. . . . You know what is done
is done, and can't be mended."

</p><p>Not knowing how to ease the burden of her jealousy, which
actually set her temples throbbing with pain, and thinking still that
things might be set right, she would wash, powder her tear-stained face,
and fly off to the lady mentioned.

</p><p>Not finding Ryabovsky with her, she would drive off to a second,
then to a third. At first she was ashamed to go about like this, but
afterwards she got used to it, and it would happen that in one evening
she would make the round of all her female


   <pb n="115"/>

acquaintances in search of Ryabovsky, and they all
understood it.
</p><p>One day she said to Ryabovsky of her husband:
</p><p>"That man crushes me with his magnanimity."

</p><p>This phrase pleased her so much that when she met the artists who
knew of her affair with Ryabovsky she said every time of her husband,
with a vigorous movement of her arm:

</p><p>"That man crushes me with his magnanimity."
</p><p>Their manner of life was the same as it had been
the year before. On Wednesdays they were "At
Home"; an actor recited, the artists sketched. The
violoncellist played, a singer sang, and invariably at
half-past eleven the door leading to the dining-room
opened and Dymov, smiling, said:
</p><p>"Come to supper, gentlemen."
</p><p>As before, Olga Ivanovna hunted celebrities,
found them, was not satisfied, and went in pursuit
of fresh ones. As before, she came back late every
night; but now Dymov was not, as last year, asleep,
but sitting in his study at work of some sort. He
went to bed at three o'clock and got up at eight.

</p><p>One evening when she was getting ready to go to the theatre and
standing before the pier glass, Dymov came into her bedroom, wearing his
dress-coat and a white tie. He was smiling gently and looked into his
wife's face joyfully, as in old days; his face was radiant.

</p><p>"I have just been defending my thesis," he said,
sitting down and smoothing his knees.
</p><p>"Defending?" asked Olga Ivanovna.
</p><p>"Oh, oh!" he laughed, and he craned his neck to


   <pb n="116"/>

see his wife's face in the mirror, for she was still
standing with her back to him, doing up her hair.  "Oh, oh," he
repeated, "do you know it's very possible they may offer me the
Readership in General Pathology? It seems like it."

</p><p>It was evident from his beaming, blissful face that if Olga
Ivanovna had shared with him his joy and triumph he would have forgiven
her everything, both the present and the future, and would have
forgotten everything, but she did not understand what was meant by a
"readership" or by "general pathology"; besides, she was afraid of being
late for the theatre, and she said nothing.

</p><p>He sat there another two minutes, and with a
guilty smile went away.
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d9">
<head>VII</head>

<p>It had been a very troubled day.
</p><p>Dymov had a very bad headache; he had no
breakfast, and did not go to the hospital, but spent
the whole time lying on his sofa in the study. Olga
Ivanovna went as usual at midday to see Ryabovsky,
to show him her still-life sketch, and to ask him why
he had not been to see her the evening before. The
sketch seemed to her worthless, and she had painted
it only in order to have an additional reason for
going to the artist.
</p><p>She went in to him without ringing, and as she
was taking off her goloshes in the entry she heard
a sound as of something running softly in the studio,
with a feminine rustle of skirts; and as she hastened


   <pb n="117"/>

to peep in she caught a momentary glimpse of a bit of brown petticoat,
which vanished behind a big picture draped, together with the easel,
with black calico, to the floor. There could be no doubt that a woman
was hiding there. How often Olga Ivanovna herself had taken refuge
behind that picture!

</p><p>Ryabovsky, evidently much embarrassed, held out
both hands to her, as though surprised at her arrival,
and said with a forced smile:
</p><p>"Aha! Very glad to see you! Anything nice
to tell me?"
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna's eyes filled with tears. She felt
ashamed and bitter, and would not for a million
roubles have consented to speak in the presence of
the outsider, the rival, the deceitful woman who was
standing now behind the picture, and probably giggling malignantly.

</p><p>"I have brought you a sketch," she said timidly
in a thin voice, and her lips quivered. <hi rend="italic">"Nature
morte."</hi>
</p><p>"Ah &mdash; ah! . . . A sketch?"
</p><p>The artist took the sketch in his hands, and as
he examined it walked, as it were mechanically, into
the other room.
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna followed him humbly.
</p><p><hi rend="italic">"Nature morte</hi> . . . first-rate sort," he muttered,
falling into rhyme. "Kurort . . . sport . . .
port . . ."

</p><p>From the studio came the sound of hurried footsteps and the
rustle of a skirt.

</p><p>So she had gone. Olga Ivanovna wanted to


   <pb n="118"/>

scream aloud, to hit the artist on the head with something heavy, but
she could see nothing through her tears, was crushed by her shame, and
felt herself, not Olga Ivanovna, not an artist, but a little insect.

</p><p>"I am tired . . ." said the artist languidly, looking at the
sketch and tossing his head as though struggling with drowsiness. "It's
very nice, of course, but here a sketch today, a sketch last year,
another sketch in a month . . . I wonder you are not bored with them. If
I were you I should give up painting and work seriously at music or
something. You're not an artist, you know, but a musician. But you can't
think how tired I am! I'll tell them to bring us some tea, shall I?"

</p><p>He went out of the room, and Olga Ivanovna
heard him give some order to his footman. To
avoid farewells and explanations, and above all to
avoid bursting into sobs, she ran as fast as she could,
before Ryabovsky came back, to the entry, put on
her goloshes, and went out into the street; then she
breathed easily, and felt she was free for ever from
Ryabovsky and from painting and from the burden
of shame which had so crushed her in the studio.
It was all over!

</p><p>She drove to her dressmaker's; then to see Barnay, who had only
arrived the day before; from Barnay to a music-shop, and all the time
she was thinking how she would write Ryabovsky a cold, cruel letter full
of personal dignity, and how in the spring or the summer she would go
with Dymov to


   <pb n="119"/>

the Crimea, free herself finally from the past there,
and begin a new life.

</p><p>On getting home late in the evening she sat down in the
drawing-room, without taking off her things, to begin the letter.
Ryabovsky had told her she was not an artist, and to pay him out she
wrote to him now that he painted the same thing every year, and said
exactly the same thing every day; that he was at a standstill, and that
nothing more would come of him than had come already. She wanted to
write, too, that he owed a great deal to her good influence, and that if
he was going wrong it was only because her influence was paralysed by
various dubious persons like the one who had been hiding behind the
picture that day.

</p><p>"Little mother!" Dymov called from the study,
without opening the door.
</p><p>"What is it?"
</p><p>"Don't come in to me, but only come to the door
&mdash; that's right. . . . The day before yesterday I
must have caught diphtheria at the hospital, and
now . . . I am ill. Make haste and send for
Korostelev."
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna always called her husband by his
surname, as she did all the men of her acquaintance;
she disliked his Christian name, Osip, because it
reminded her of the Osip in Gogol and the silly pun
on his name. But now she cried:
</p><p>"Osip, it cannot be!"
</p><p>"Send for him; I feel ill," Dymov said behind
the door, and she could hear him go back to the


   <pb n="120"/>

sofa and lie down. "Send!" she heard his voice
faintly.

</p><p>"Good Heavens!" thought Olga Ivanovna, turning chill with horror.
"Why, it's dangerous!"

</p><p>For no reason she took the candle and went into the bedroom, and
there, reflecting what she must do, glanced casually at herself in the
pier glass. With her pale, frightened face, in a jacket with sleeves
high on the shoulders, with yellow ruches on her bosom, and with stripes
running in unusual directions on her skirt, she seemed to herself
horrible and disgusting. She suddenly felt poignantly sorry for Dymov,
for his boundless love for her, for his young life, and even for the
desolate little bed in which he had not slept for so long; and she
remembered his habitual, gentle, submissive smile. She wept bitterly,
and wrote an imploring letter to Korostelev.  It was two o'clock in the
night.
</p>
</div1><div1 type="section" id="d10">
<head>VIII</head>

<p>When towards eight o'clock in the morning Olga Ivanovna, her head
heavy from want of sleep and her hair unbrushed, came out of her
bedroom, looking unattractive and with a guilty expression on her face,
a gentleman with a black beard, apparently the doctor, passed by her
into the entry. There was a smell of drugs. Korostelev was standing near
the study door, twisting his left moustache with his right hand.

</p><p>"Excuse me, I can't let you go in," he said surlily


   <pb n="121"/>

to Olga Ivanovna; "it's catching. Besides, it's no
use, really; he is delirious, anyway."
</p><p>"Has he really got diphtheria?" Olga Ivanovna
asked in a whisper.

</p><p>"People who wantonly risk infection ought to be hauled up and
punished for it," muttered Korostelev, not answering Olga Ivanovna's
question. "Do you know why he caught it? On Tuesday he was sucking up
the mucus through a pipette from a boy with diphtheria. And what for? It
was stupid.
. . . Just from folly. . . ."

</p><p>"Is it dangerous, very?" asked Olga Ivanovna.

</p><p>"Yes; they say it is the malignant form. We
ought to send for Shrek really."

</p><p>A little red-haired man with a long nose and a Jewish accent
arrived; then a tall, stooping, shaggy individual, who looked like a
head deacon; then a stout young man with a red face and spectacles.
These were doctors who came to watch by turns beside their colleague.
Korostelev did not go home when his turn was over, but remained and
wandered about the rooms like an uneasy spirit. The maid kept getting
tea for the various doctors, and was constantly running to the chemist,
and there was no one to do the rooms. There was a dismal stillness in
the flat.

</p><p>Olga Ivanovna sat in her bedroom and thought
that God was punishing her for having deceived her
husband. That silent, unrepining, uncomprehended
creature, robbed by his mildness of all personality
and will, weak from excessive kindness, had been


   <pb n="122"/>

suffering in obscurity somewhere on his sofa, and had not complained.
And if he were to complain even in delirium, the doctors watching by his
bedside would learn that diphtheria was not the only cause of his
sufferings. They would ask Korostelev. He knew all about it, and it was
not for nothing that he looked at his friend's wife with eyes that
seemed to say that she was the real chief criminal and diphtheria was
only her accomplice. She did not think now of the moonlight evening on
the Volga, nor the words of love, nor their poetical life in the
peasant's hut. She thought only that from an idle whim, from
self-indulgence, she had sullied herself all over from head to foot in
something filthy, sticky, which one could never wash off. . . .

</p><p>"Oh, how fearfully false I've been!" she thought,
recalling the troubled passion she had known with
Ryabovsky. "Curse it all! . . ."

</p><p>At four o'clock she dined with Korostelev. He did nothing but
scowl and drink red wine, and did not eat a morsel. She ate nothing,
either. At one minute she was praying inwardly and vowing to God that if
Dymov recovered she would love him again and be a faithful wife to him.
Then, forgetting herself for a minute, she would look at Korostelev, and
think: "Surely it must be dull to be a humble, obscure person, not
remarkable in any way, especially with such a wrinkled face and bad
manners!"  Then it seemed to her that God would strike her dead that
minute for not having once been in her husband's study, for fear of
infection. And altogether she had a dull, despondent feeling and a
conviction


   <pb n="123"/>

that her life was spoilt, and that there was
no setting it right anyhow. . . .
</p><p>After dinner darkness came on. When Olga
Ivanovna went into the drawing-room Korostelev
was asleep on the sofa, with a gold-embroidered silk
cushion under his head.
</p><p>"Khee-poo-ah," he snored &mdash; "khee-poo-ah."
</p><p>And the doctors as they came to sit up and went
away again did not notice this disorder. The fact
that a strange man was asleep and snoring in the
drawing-room, and the sketches on the walls and the
exquisite decoration of the room, and the fact that
the lady of the house was dishevelled and untidy &mdash;
all that aroused not the slightest interest now. One
of the doctors chanced to laugh at something, and
the laugh had a strange and timid sound that made
one's heart ache.

</p><p>When Olga Ivanovna went into the drawing-room
next time, Korostelev was not asleep, but sitting up
and smoking.

</p><p>"He has diphtheria of the nasal cavity," he said in a low voice,
"and the heart is not working properly now. Things are in a bad way,
really."

</p><p>"But you will send for Shrek?" said Olga Ivanovna.

</p><p>"He has been already. It was he noticed
that the diphtheria had passed into the nose.
What's the use of Shrek! Shrek's no use at all,
really. He is Shrek, I am Korostelev, and nothing
more."
</p><p>The time dragged on fearfully slowly. Olga
Ivanovna lay down in her clothes on her bed, that


   <pb n="124"/>

had not been made all day, and sank into a doze.
She dreamed that the whole flat was filled up from
floor to ceiling with a huge piece of iron, and that
if they could only get the iron out they would all be
light-hearted and happy. Waking, she realized
that it was not the iron but Dymov's illness that was
weighing on her.

</p><p>"Nature morte, port . . ." she thought, sinking
into forgetfulness again. "Sport . . . Kurort . . .
and what of Shrek? Shrek . . . trek . . . wreck.
. . . And where are my friends now? Do they
know that we are in trouble? Lord, save . . .
spare! Shrek . . . trek . . ."

</p><p>And again the iron was there. . . . The time dragged on slowly,
though the clock on the lower storey struck frequently. And bells were
continually ringing as the doctors arrived. . . . The house-maid came in
with an empty glass on a tray, and asked, "Shall I make the bed, madam?"
and getting no answer, went away.

</p><p>The clock below struck the hour. She dreamed
of the rain on the Volga; and again some one came
into her bedroom, she thought a stranger. Olga
Ivanovna jumped up, and recognized Korostelev.
</p><p>"What time is it?" she asked.
</p><p>"About three."
</p><p>"Well, what is it?"
</p><p>"What, indeed! . . . I've come to tell you he is
passing. . . ."
</p><p>He gave a sob, sat down on the bed beside her,
and wiped away the tears with his sleeve. She


   <pb n="125"/>

could not grasp it at once, but turned cold all over
and began slowly crossing herself.

</p><p>"He is passing," he repeated in a shrill voice, and again he gave
a sob. "He is dying because he sacrificed himself. What a loss for
science!" he said bitterly." Compare him with all of us. He was a great
man, an extraordinary man! What gifts! What hopes we all had of him!"
Korostelev went on, wringing his hands: "Merciful God, he was a man of
science; we shall never look on his like again. Osip Dymov, what have
you done &mdash; aie, aie, my God!"

</p><p>Korostelev covered his face with both hands in
despair, and shook his head.
</p><p>"And his moral force," he went on, seeming to
grow more and more exasperated against some one.
"Not a man, but a pure, good, loving soul, and
clean as crystal. He served science and died for
science. And he worked like an ox night and day &mdash;
no one spared him &mdash; and with his youth and his
learning he had to take a private practice and work
at translations at night to pay for these . . . vile
rags!"
</p><p>Korostelev looked with hatred at Olga Ivanovna,
snatched at the sheet with both hands and angrily
tore it, as though it were to blame.
</p><p>"He did not spare himself, and others did not
spare him. Oh, what's the use of talking!"
</p><p>"Yes, he was a rare man," said a bass voice in
the drawing-room.
</p><p>Olga Ivanovna remembered her whole life with


   <pb n="126"/>

him from the beginning to the end, with all its details, and suddenly
she understood that he really was an extraordinary, rare, and, compared
with every one else she knew, a great man. And remembering how her
father, now dead, and all the other doctors had behaved to him, she
realized that they really had seen in him a future celebrity. The walls,
the ceiling, the lamp, and the carpet on the floor, seemed to be winking
at her sarcastically, as though they would say, "You were blind! you
were blind!"  With a wail she flung herself out of the bedroom, dashed
by some unknown man in the drawing-room, and ran into her husband's
study. He was lying motionless on the sofa, covered to the waist with a
quilt. His face was fearfully thin and sunken, and was of a
grayish-yellow colour such as is never seen in the living; only from the
forehead, from the black eyebrows and from the familiar smile, could he
be recognized as Dymov. Olga Ivanovna hurriedly felt his chest, his
forehead, and his hands. The chest was still warm, but the forehead and
hands were unpleasantly cold, and the half-open eyes looked, not at Olga
Ivanovna, but at the quilt.

</p><p>"Dymov!" she called aloud, "Dymov!" She wanted to explain to him
that it had been a mistake, that all was not lost, that life might still
be beautiful and happy, that he was an extraordinary, rare, great man,
and that she would all her life worship him and bow down in homage and
holy awe before him. . . .

</p><p>"Dymov!" she called him, patting him on the


   <pb n="127"/>

shoulder, unable to believe that he would never wake
again. "Dymov! Dymov!"

</p><p>In the drawing-room Korostelev was saying to the
housemaid:

</p><p>"Why keep asking? Go to the church beadle
and enquire where they live. They'll wash the body
and lay it out, and do everything that is necessary."
