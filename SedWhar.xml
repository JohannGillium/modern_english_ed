<p>  WHEN Mrs. Wharton's stories first appeared, in that early
period which, as we have now learned, was merely a period of
apprenticeship, everybody said, "How clever!"  "How wonderfully
clever!"  And the criticism&mdash;to adopt a generic term for
indiscriminate adjectives&mdash;was apt, for the most conspicuous
trait
in the stories was cleverness.  They were astonishingly clever;
and
their cleverness, as an ostensible quality will, caught and held
the attention.  And yet, though undoubtedly correct, the term
owes
its correctness, in part at least, to its ready-to-wear quality,
to
its negative merit of vague amplitude, behind which the most
diverse gifts and capacities may lie concealed.  No readers of
Mrs.
Wharton, after the first shock of bewildered admiration, rest
content with it, but grope about to lift the cloaking surtout of
cleverness and to see as best they may how and by what methods
her
preternaturally nimble wits are playing their game,&mdash;for it is a
game that Mrs. Wharton plays, pitting herself against a situation
to see how much she can score.</p><p>
     To most people the point she plays most brilliantly is the
episode, which in the novel is merely one of the links in the
concatenation of the plot, but in the short story is the form and
substance, the very thing itself; and so to be mistress of the
art
of the episode almost seems to leave any other species of mastery
irrelevant and superfluous.  In Mrs. Wharton this aptitude is not
single, but a combination.  It includes the sense of proportion,
and markedly that elementary proportion of allotting the proper
space for the introduction of the story,&mdash;so much to bring the
<hi rend="italic"> dramatis personae</hi> into the ring, so much for the preliminary
bouts, so much for the climax, and, finally, the proper length
for
the recessional.  It includes the subordination of one character
to
another, of one picture to another, the arrangement of details in
proper hierarchy to produce the desired effect.</p><p>
     "The Dilettante," for instance, is a good example of craft
in
introducing a situation.  The story is very short, the episode a
mere dialogue; and, as the nature of the dialogue forbids an
explanation of the situation through the mouths of the speakers,
a
neat prologue, in half-livery as it were, opens the door and
takes
your name, then the dialogue, in full livery, immediately shows
you
upstairs into the inner privacy of the episode, where the climax
awaits you.  You are met at each step by the forethought of a
somewhat anxious hostess; and there is throughout a well-bred
economy of effort which one expects to pass into grace, but which
for some reason deflects and slips back into cleverness.</p><p>
     Some readers deem the dialogue the strongest point of Mrs.
Wharton's game, it is so pithy and witty.  Others, again, among
the
various excellences, prefer the author's own observations and
comments.  Still others like best the epigrams or the dramatic
interest of the incident itself.</p><p>
     If the reader, after he has gone over these various points
in
the game, attempts to sum up his impressions, to his astonishment
and dismay he finds himself again face to face with his old
adjective <hi rend="italic"> clever</hi>.  At first he surmises that this is a
trick of
his own indolence, which, lazily yielding to habit, offers him
this
serviceable word; but upon reflection he perceives that the
adjective has a positive merit.  It is a word of limitation: it
fences in its own domain, <pb n="218" id="SedWhar218"/> and excludes other
regions
beyond.  Mrs. Wharton's stories are not original like Miss
Wilkins's, not poetic like George Eliot's, not romantic like Bret
Harte's, not rippling with muscular energy like Kipling's, not
smooth with the dogmatic determinism of Maupassant.  To none of
those story-tellers would one apply the word clever; and though
Mrs. Wharton cannot very well monopolize the adjective, by her
high
level of skill, by her ready command over her own resources, by
her
tact, by her courage,&mdash;no situation daunts her,&mdash;and especially
by
her limitations, she wholly justifies the public in crying out,
"Oh, clever Mrs. Wharton!"</p><p>
     Cleverness not only limits its own domain, but stamps a
special character upon it.  In the novel proper there is one
fundamental rule: that the characters, once introduced, must act
with the large liberty of life, and work out their own fortunes.
For novelists believe that, though other arts are all artificial
and do not hold up the mirror to nature, yet their art is life
indeed, their business is to leave the reader uncertain whether
he
is really in or out of the book.  Let that be so.  Novels proper
are not everything.  There are other fields of fiction in which
the
author is an absolute tyrant, and need make no pretense of giving
his characters any free will whatever.  To these regions the
short
story as a rule belongs.  There is no room for liberty.  The
characters must complete their episode in scanty pages, and they
must do the most artificial things in order to make the scene
effective.  Mrs. Wharton makes a most excellent tyrant, and gives
her subjects vastly more vivacity than they would have if left to
themselves.  The dialogues are far too good for life, the
episodes
too well modeled, the motives too well calculated, the actions
too
complete, to admit of any doubt concerning the immediate presence
of the autocrat.  Everywhere the emphasis is the emphasis of art,
not of life.  This literary art is, of course, not only wholly
legitimate, but some people might contend that it is the only art
worth having.  Artificial fiction makes no pretense that it is a
reflection of life; it does not profess to make a real man and a
real woman living in a real house, and really talking over real
toast and tea.  It sets itself up as an independent art, with its
own rules, its own proprieties, its own standard of success.  It
is
akin to artificial comedy, as Sheridan, for instance, handled it.

No one judges <hi rend="italic"> The Rivals</hi> as a bit of real life.  The
business
of Mrs. Wharton's <hi rend="italic"> dramatis personae</hi> is to portray an
effective
episode; and it is a business which requires <hi rend="italic"> cleverness</hi>,
as
distinguished from originality, poetic feeling, humour, insight,
romance, energy, or power.

                                II</head>
<p>
     Going a step farther, the most casual investigator becomes
acquainted with Mrs. Wharton's propriety, tact, nicety of
craftsmanship, and that special possession which in creative art
is
of the first importance,&mdash;human personality.  Those people who
advocate the suppression of all traces of the creator in his
creations are too ascetic, too marmoreal, too super-or infra-human.  Our generation, not yet wholly purged of the lingering
effects left by the old Romantic individualism, cannot but feel
that the more fiction is interpenetrated by the author's
personality the more interesting it is.</p><p>
     This assumption involves as a corollary the immense
importance
of gender; and gender is indeed a matter of fundamental interest
in
literature, as in life.  We are born on one side or the other of
the great chasm; and in whichever camp we are, on the approach of
anything that awakens our real interest, we challenge at once,
"Fine or Superfine?"  A man's world is not a woman's world.  He
and
she are differently endowed; they perceive differently,&mdash;that is,
all except the bald, unannotated reports of the senses,&mdash;group
their impressions differently, deduce differently.  Traits which
preserve <pb n="219" id="SedWhar219"/> neutrality and straddle the chasm,
serving both
sides alike, are limited to the performance of the mechanical
parts
of fiction, and subject to rules and regulations.  Where they
end,
begins the employment of those faculties that make individuality;
and here the first rough and ready test as to whether the work
has
the flavor of personality is the determination of sex.  Readers,
male readers at least, are sometimes so blinded by prejudice, by
an
indefensible habit of identifying art with the male sex, that
when
a woman writes a novel such as <hi rend="italic"> Jane Eyre</hi> or <hi rend="italic"> Adam
Bede</hi>,
there is a general masculine readiness to be surprised, and a
general masculine agreement that the talents and capacities which
created the novel are of a peculiarly masculine order.  In Mrs.
Wharton's case men are debarred from any such self-complacent
theory, for her talents and capacities are not only intrinsically
feminine, but also, despite her cleverness, which, generally
speaking, is a neutral trait, they are superficially
feminine.</p><p>
     This fundamental fact of Mrs. Wharton's femininity is
conspicuous in many ways.  There was, for instance, in her early
stories, a certain feminine dependence, as a girl on skates for
the
first time might lay the tip of her finger on a supporting arm.
She showed a wish to learn, a ready docility, and the attractive
simplicity of credulity, toward her first teacher, such as women,
with their innate appreciation of authority, possess in a much
greater degree than men.  This hesitating dependence, as she took
her first comparatively timid steps, following as closely as she
could the sway and oscillations to which her teacher subjected
his
equilibrium, served her purpose.  She learned her lesson, skated
with ever greater ease, and, though still maintaining the rules
she
had learned, gradually got her own balance, and, after hard work
and frequent practice, skated off, head erect, scarf, ribbons,
and
vesture floating free, with the speed and security of a racer.
Her
movements are always feminine movements, her ease, her poise,
always feminine.</p><p>
     There is also in the stories what one might call a certain
feminine capriciousness or arbitrariness, even beyond the
ordinary
autocracy of the story-teller, a method of deciding upon instinct
rather than upon reflection.  Take the union of episodes.  Mrs.
Wharton sees her story in episodes, or rather she sees episodes
and
puts them together.  Sometimes they have no natural congruity, or
are even rebelliously opposed to union.  A man would acknowledge
their independence, and leave them apart; but Mrs. Wharton,
insisting on her autocratic prerogatives, forcibly unites them.
In
<hi rend="italic"> The Sanctuary</hi>, for example, she conceived the idea of
repeating
weakness of character and similarity of temptation in two
generations; so she contrived two episodes, which, however, had
no
natural bond of union.  She then put double duty on the heroine,
and made her fulfill the function of joining the two episodes by
the ingenious method of marrying her to the hero of the first in
order to make her the mother of the hero of the second.</p><p>
     Her choice of plot, even, is distinctly feminine.  Take <hi rend="italic">
The
Touchstone</hi> for instance:given the situation, a man would have
shifted the centre of gravity, and have rearranged all the
effects.
Her emphasis, her sense of interest, of importance, differ from a
man's.  Her feminine tact&mdash;that quality of unexpected control
among
forces so slight or so stubborn that no man can see how a woman
gets her leverage; that power of steering when his rudder would
be
trailing in the air or stuck in the mud&mdash;is conspicuous in
dialogue, in adjustment of relations, in the whole frame and
finish
of the story.</p><p>
     These characteristics are minor matters, but they point
unhesitatingly to the conclusion that Mrs. Wharton is not only
mentally feminine, with all the value of personality and
humanity,
but so much so as to belong plainly enough to the species,&mdash;the
notable and justly celebrated <pb n="220" id="SedWhar220"/> species,&mdash;the
American woman.
This interesting type has been studied with the ardor due to the
rapid modification by which it has diverged from its European
progenitors.  Its salient traits are well known, and perhaps no
one
has portrayed them more effectively than Mr. John Sargent.  In
his
portraits we see a network of nerves drawn too taut for the
somewhat inadequate equipment of flesh and blood: an attention
given to the business of receiving and acting upon sensations so
disproportionate that there is no proper leisure for the
sensations
themselves; a superior, indeed, a snubbing attitude of the
nervous
system toward the rest of the body.  In Sargent's women there is
no
wholesome tendency to loafing, no ease of manner, no sense of
physical <hi rend="italic"> bien-etre:</hi> rather they stand, or sit&mdash;in the
latter
case on the edge of their chairs&mdash;like discoboli, waiting for a
signal to whirl and hurl anything&mdash;anywhere&mdash;direction being
unimportant, the sibylline contortion everything.  This
fundamental
nervous restlessness shows itself in all Mrs. Wharton's stories,
in
her rapidity of thought, of phrase, of dialogue, in her
intensity,
her eagerness, her rush of thought.  This American dash, this
cascade-like brilliancy of motion, make, no doubt, for most
readers
the interest of the stories.  But many of us, idle and
inefficient,
weakly wish for repose, a little pause, a trifling indulgence.
With many story-tellers the reader gets aboard an accommodation
train, and during the jogging, the stopping and starting, the
pleasant Trollopy leisure, he looks out of the window, reflects
on
what has gone before, and speculates on what is to come.  None of
these weaknesses are permitted to Mrs. Wharton's readers,&mdash;I
speak
of the stories,&mdash;we are booked express, the present is all-exacting, and the pace is American.</p><p>
     This nervous eagerness and intensity find their fullest and
freest expression in the epigrams, metaphors, similes, and
aphorisms which crack fast and furious about our ears.  No sooner
do we hear an epigrammatic phrase, catch a loose end of its
applicability, and grasp at apprehension, than crack! crack! go
another and another.  There is something almost vindictive in
this
hailstorm.  "His egoism was not of a kind to mirror its
complacency
in the adventure."  "There was something fatuous in an attitude
of
sentimental apology toward a memory already classic."  "He had no
fancy for leaving havoc in his wake, and would have preferred to
sow a quick growth of oblivion in the spaces wasted by his
inconsidered inroads;" and so forth.  Such quotations&mdash;one can
pluck them from every page&mdash;are clearly the literary
gesticulations
of an American woman.

</p>
</div1>
<div1 type="section" n="3" id="d5">

                                III</head>
<p>
     This American element, which gives the stories so much of
their character, is also noticeable in another of Mrs. Wharton's
accomplishments&mdash;one had almost said one of her talents, so fully
and freely does she use it,&mdash;her artistic and literary
cultivation.
That cultivation is distinctly American in the sense that it
immediately displays its American acquisition and ownership, and
peremptorily excludes the notion that it might be English
cultivation or French.</p><p>
     That such a distinction may be taken is due, no doubt, to
the
fact that we are on this shore of the Atlantic, and not on the
other.  The great traditional humanities, the inheritances of
literature and art, are fundamentally foreign to us.  Our
ancestors
did not create them, did not experience the emotions that
prompted
their creation, nor were they in any way cognizant of the
stimulating circumstances under which they were produced.
Emigration from Europe broke the course of spiritual-descent, and
our type is so much the result of modification by new conditions,
and by a natural selection adapted to such new conditions, that
our
inheritance of European understanding and sympathy is an almost
negligible quantity.  We learn the humanities as we learn
<pb n="221" id="SedWhar221"/>
lessons; not in the way cultivated Englishmen or Frenchmen learn
them, as part and parcel of their familiar experience of
life.</p><p>
     Nevertheless, our national theory is that culture is not to
be
neglected, but to be assimilated rapidly in a manner becoming the
busy, forward-looking, American spirit: and, accordingly, we make
ourselves acquainted with the humanities,&mdash;as we might become
acquainted with the British peerage in Burke,&mdash;in terms of
galleries, museums, operas, scenery; whereas to Europeans the
humanities, the inheritances of art and literature, constitute a
collection of ideas, expressed in various modes, a study for
discipline, for growth, for pleasure.  Such being our attitude,
we
naturally look to the country where humanism, culture, art may
most
rapidly be <hi rend="italic"> got up</hi>, where the greatest number of names may
with
least effort be appended to the greatest number of things, the
amplest amount <hi rend="italic"> Bohned</hi> with the least expenditure of
effort.
That country, beyond dispute, is Italy, and thither we betake
ourselves.</p><p>
     It would be absurd to apply this rude generalization to Mrs.
Wharton's cultivation, which is so unusual in variety, accuracy,
and scholarship; but one does not wholly escape an intimation of
the presence of this cis-Atlantic attitude in the evidences of
cultivation so profusely scattered through Mrs. Wharton's
stories,
and the patriotically inclined are justified in pointing to her
with pride as a product of our national civilization.</p><p>
     This point, otherwise unimportant, suggests the further
point
as to whether culture of this character is favorable for the
production of fiction.  Of course the most highly cultivated
novelist might write fiction free from all badges of the author's
culture, but that would rather be a European way of doing than an
American.  Take Mr. Henry James, for instance: one would search
his
novels in vain for any such obvious badges; or take
D'Annunzio&mdash;no
writer is more imbued with the culture of Italy than he,&mdash;and
though he uses that culture obviously, perhaps, yet he uses it
merely as a color to emphasize the pattern of his story.  We are
inclined&mdash;I refer to those of us who move in the denser and
stuffier strata of our national culture, and not to those who,
like
Mrs. Wharton, float in a purer upper air&mdash;to hold the man who
uses
his knowledge of literature and art for personal enjoyment only
as
an Epicurean egotist; we look upon his accomplishments as bad
investments until he is able to exhibit dividends.  And he, not
daring to hoist a standard unacceptable to the community, readily
succumbs to our attitude, and hurries to advertise his
possessions.
The European method of mere unavoidable enrichment of the matter
in
hand is seldom adopted.</p><p>
     Mrs. Wharton, though flying briskly through that purer upper
air, nevertheless is unconsciously affected by the fumes which
rise
from below.  Her cultivation declares the most appetizing
dividends.  She showers her references and allusions to art and
letters with the ready cleverness and lavish prodigality with
which
she scatters her epigrams.  One cannot help asking one's self,
diffidently indeed, but pertinaciously, are not the ornaments too
clinquant, do not the decorations assert themselves too
presumptuously and mar the softer and more harmonious colors of
the
groundwork?  And the question&mdash;or a question derived from that
question&mdash;obtrudes itself most insistently in reference to <hi rend="italic">
The
Valley of Decision</hi>.</p><p>
     When that novel was first published, the fashion was to
disentangle and distinguish,&mdash;as one ruminates and speculates
over
the flavors of a salad,&mdash;to separate the several ingredients
culled
from many books, and to crow over the discovery or attribution;
in
blindness to the fact that the somewhat royal levy of tribute was
the object of the book, open, obvious, proclaimed, and carefully
planned.  The story, of purpose, is subordinated to its setting.
The actors are necessarily a little frigid, the hero, unwillingly
perhaps, a <hi rend="italic"> poseur</hi>, the heroine willingly a <hi rend="italic"> poseuse;</hi>
<pb n="222" id="SedWhar222"/> but the scenery in which they carry about their rarefied and cool
personalities is very attractive.  Considering the book from the
point of view of pageantry, one almost inclines to name it beside
<hi rend="italic"> Le Capitaine Fracasse</hi>, so prodigal is it in details of
information, so many-hued and high-colored in general
effect,&mdash;the
hero and heroine most dutifully going hither and thither wherever
the calcium light will fall most effectually on the rich
scenery.</p><p>
     Of course there were persons, devotees to the dogma that the
proper material for a novel is personal experience of life, who
said that a book compact of memories of other books, <hi rend="italic"> souvenirs
des voyages intellectuels</hi>, was not admissible, must be
frowned
upon.  But arbitrary positions, satisfactory though they be to
the
occupants, are not necessarily universally satisfactory.  At
present, authority in literature is of little moment, and success
justifies itself.  If Mrs. Wharton could gather matter, shear
wool,
as it were, from <hi rend="italic"> Wilhelm Meister, La Chartreuse de Parme</hi>,
the
memoirs of Goldoni, Alfieri, Casanova, sundry novels of
Turgeneff,
and what else besides, and make an interesting novel, one might
fairly say that she had done admirably to use whatever materials
were adapted to her purpose; for Shakespeare did not hesitate to
use materials ready to his hand.  The success is the matter.  All
life is but a transmutation of materials, and novelists may use
whatever they can find in books, in history, in life, in
imagination; the point is to create life again.  One would hardly
go so far in praise of <hi rend="italic"> The Valley of Decision</hi> as to think
of it
as creating life out of its literary materials.  It did not do
that; it made a very entertaining, interesting, and agreeable
book.
It gave that longed-for sensation of floating down a romantic
river
whose banks are lined with the rich hues which only far-away
distances and the irrevocable past possess.  One heard, despite a
forced assent to pedantic and literary fault-finding, the "tirra
lirra by the river" that caught one's imagination and bore it
off.</p><p>
     Perhaps the first after-effect of the book on the reader was
to set him wondering as to Mrs. Wharton's future career.  Would
she
confine herself to study, to scholarship, to the world of the
connoisseur and amateur? would she be our cicerone to the
agreeable
things of art and literature?  Or would she take the other road,
study life, and become a novelist?  It was not easy to decide
one's
wishes.  Now, more than ever, we need critics to help us to an
appreciation of the pleasures of refinement.  Europe is so near,
and so easily overrun, that the obvious charms of the obviously
beautiful are daily rendered more and more obvious and less and
less charming by scores of amiable persons, who interpose
themselves and their shadows between us and the beauties of the
past.  We are so much more disposed to see obvious beauty, so
much
more disposed to <hi rend="italic"> have seen</hi> it, than to sit before one
beautiful
thing and incorporate it in our experience, that we need a
teacher
to teach us what immense differences lie huddled close to one
another, how far apart are things that look to us so much alike.
On the other hand, how delightful to have a real novelist, one
who
out of her own personal experience of life will take a part that
shall stand by itself, and give us that sense of satisfaction
which
is, after all, the emotion which we commonly crave in
novels,&mdash;the
satisfaction of knowledge, of experience, of sympathy, of
happiness, of sorrow, of life.  And though, after reading the
stories, the reader did not expect from Mrs. Wharton pathos, nor
humour, nor tragedy, nor a wide range of experience, nor broad
sympathies, nor raids upon the heart, one did expect wit, satire,
flashes of insight, comprehension, analysis, vividness.  So one
stood with a divided mind.</p><p>
     In such a mood the volumes on <hi rend="italic"> Italian Gardens</hi> and on
<hi rend="italic">
Italian Backgrounds</hi> came, with some interval between them.
The
name <hi rend="italic"> Italian Gardens</hi> carried with it a special aroma, and
gave
a fillip to expectation.  At last we were to get at the
<pb n="223" id="SedWhar223"/>
meaning of Italian gardens, which to our ignorance appeared so
inferior to the English in all usual horticultural appointments,
in
flowers, shrubs, turf, and trees; so unsentimental in their
terraces, formalities, and observances, when compared with the
"wet, bird-haunted English lawn" and the brick-walled, fruit-beloved, rose-encumbered gardens of England.  The book, however,
was a disappointment.  Whether Mrs. Wharton's hand had not
complete
control, or whether she was impatient of a prescribed task, or
whether the translation of the inner delicacies of an Italian
garden into American notions was a task unsuited to her talents,
or
whatever the reason, the book had a cold, perfunctory, mechanical
ring.  We had hoped to share the branchless sentiment of the
stone
pine's bole, the green thoughts of the lizards that crawl out
under
the Italian sun, to enter into the connubial sympathies between
ilex and stucco, to understand why Mignon felt the lemon's
fragrance in so peculiarly rapturous a manner; but the book
leaves
us with a number of names of villas and of landscape gardeners, a
consciousness of emptiness, and the conviction that Mrs. Wharton
has never spent an hour in a garden uprooting weeds, hunting
rose-bugs, squashing caterpillars, or sealing up new-made homes of
borer
worms with putty and clay.  One may talk with landscape gardeners
by the hour about prospects, middle distances, reaches, effects,
about lines of box, parallels of sweet peas, clumps of viburnum,
about the values of an axis and of straight lines, about the
etiquette of graveled paths and the massing of afternoon shadows;
but the trowel and a broken back, the pruning hook and dazzled
eyes, the vendetta with the slug, the rich, creative fragrance of
manure, the heat and sweat of noon, dirty hands,&mdash;with these
indispensables to the love and knowledge of any garden Mrs.
Wharton
betrays no acquaintance.</p><p>
     In <hi rend="italic"> Italian Backgrounds</hi> she is on surer footing.  She
is
familiar with Italy, and she has a very wide knowledge of the
best
that has been thought and said of Italy.  She is hand and glove
with the critics of art.  She never enters a town in Italy, no
matter how small, but she has in her handbag Crowe and
Cavalcaselle, Kugler, Burckhardt, Morelli, Berenson, and a half
dozen more.  She looks at every picture, every fresco, every bit
of
sculpture and carving, like a constitutional queen, and they are
her responsible advisers; she judges cherubim, madonnas,
portraits,
choir-stalls, proportions of height and breadth, contrasts of
light
and shade, relations of Gothic to Romanesque, of the <hi rend="italic">
quattrocento</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"> cinquecento</hi>, of masters to
pupils, all
according to the laws and rules adopted by her learned advisers,
to
which she gives full assent and approval.  Certainly she does
this
well.  There are no errors to be subsequently corrected, no rash
ventures to be regretted; but ill-regulated readers sometimes
long
to fling authority to the winds.  Give us not what Morelli
thought
or Burckhardt, but what you think, Mrs. Wharton; pitch your
portable library out of your <hi rend="italic"> vettura</hi>, send Berenson to
Jericho,
make mistakes on every page, and let's hear how beautiful Italy
impresses you.  It is your personal intimacy with Italy that
interests us.

<p>
     It was at this moment, when Mrs. Wharton's devotion to
culture
seemed to produce less ripeness, less freshness of flavor, than
our
general elation with her accomplishments had led us to expect,
that
<hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi> made its triumphant appearance.  Here
Mrs.
Wharton, as it were, lays down her hand (with all its trumps) on
the table, and enables us to understand her play and to determine
whether she is the novelist for us, whether she is able to
provide
us with that personal satisfaction to which as novel readers we
aspire.  For our personal satisfactions are still, in America,
our
chief preoccupation.  Elsewhere, it may be, a novelist is judged
as
an artist, a novel as <pb n="224" id="SedWhar224"/> a work of art.  This
foreign method,
if it exists, is due to a coincidence between the reader's
personal
appetite and his artistic appetite, or to the subordination of
the
former to the latter.  In this country there is no such
coincidence, no such subordination; and novelists must submit, if
they wish to be read, to the democratic methods of our merit
system, must run the gauntlet of our personal tastes.</p><p>
     With a knowledge that this system obtains in this country,
Mrs. Wharton approached her present position, which one may call,
out of deference to its eminence, that of the novelist-laureate.
Like other laureateships, Petrarch's for instance, it is a
position
that lies in the public gift, and the candidate must commend
himself or herself to the good opinion of the patron.  The only
objection to the position is that in making the appointment the
patron regards its own satisfaction far more than the excellence
of
its appointee, and interposes the obstacle of its appetite
between
approval and even so admirable a candidate as Mrs. Wharton.  In
other arts an artist is braced and enabled to sacrifice all to
his
art through the support afforded by the intellectual
exclusiveness
of the small band before which he presents himself; but the
novelist is deprived of such support by the nature of his craft,
and when he addresses a pure democracy of readers, as he must to
obtain the laurel, there is an immense temptation to do what may
be
necessary to secure the patron's ear.  None would go so far as to
suggest that Mrs. Wharton deliberately or even consciously sought
that ear, that she entertained any covetous thoughts of the
laureateship when she held up to public gaze a certain aspect of
fashionable life in New York in a popular and somewhat
melodramatic
fashion; on the contrary, she would doubtless prefer a patrician
patron of her own choosing; but being an American, it would have
been unnatural had she wholly avoided the inoculation
administered
by her birth and education.  Our universal acceptance of the
patron's right to appoint makes too strong a current to be
withstood, unless there be some very good reason for resistance,
and there was none in this case.  The point I wish to make is
that
Mrs. Wharton is so thoroughly American that even in <hi rend="italic"> The House
of
Mirth</hi> she adopts a popular method unintentionally and
successfully.</p><p>
     But most certainly one must not suffer this idea (too
grossly
stated), that Mrs. Wharton is affected by the atmosphere around
her, does hear the murmurs of the many-voiced public, to obscure
in
any way one's judgment of her excellences as an artist; on the
contrary, the idea should merely remind us that there is this
unconscious difficulty with which her art has to struggle, and
make
us appreciate the more the brilliancy of her success.</p><p>
     On reading <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi>, the first sensation
of
everybody, included or not among those whose plebiscite granted
the
laurel, was one of exultation, of "I told you so," as they
recognized all Mrs. Wharton's talents, but better and brighter.
Her mastery of the episode is as dashing as ever, and more
delicate.  The chapters are a succession of tableaux, all
admirably
posed.  And yet this mastery, by its very excess, has marred the
work of its necessary companion art, the hymeneal art of uniting
episodes; it will not suffer any episode to remain in a state
other
than that of celibate self-sufficiency.  But in a novel no
episode
can be self-sufficient; it must proceed from the episode before
and
merge into the episode that follows.  In this part of her craft
Mrs. Wharton has always shown a certain lack of dexterity; and
the
general effect of <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi> is to throw this
difficulty in high relief.  There are places where the junction
of
two episodes appears no more than as the scar of an old
inadequacy;
and then again there are others where the episodes seem animated
by
a desire to break away from the trammels of the plot and pose by
themselves.  They remind one of the succession of prints that
constitute <hi rend="italic"> The Rake's Progress</hi>.  Like the rake, Lily Bart
proceeds downward from <pb n="225" id="SedWhar225"/> print to print, from
Trenor circle
to Gormer circle, from the Gormers to Norma Hatch, from Norma to
millinery, and so on, from morn to noon she falls, from noon to
dewy eve, down to her catastrophe; each stage is a distinct
episode, a scene which Hogarth&mdash;with Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint
Lily's picture&mdash;might have portrayed.</p><p>
     The epigrams are as luminous as ever, but they are no longer
firecrackers; they are brightened and softened to electric lights
ensconced in Venetian glass, where they shed both illumination
and
color.  They maintain their old electric vivacity,&mdash;Mrs. Bart
sits
at her husband's bed-side "with the provisional air of a traveler
who waits for a belated train to start,"&mdash;but now they serve a
purpose, they explain, they emphasize, and in no readily
forgettable manner.  To be sure, the temptation to use an epigram
because it is an epigram has not wholly lost its sweetness.  Such
phrases as "her finely disseminated sentences made their chatter
dull" still recall a morning notebook in which the happy thoughts
of a restless night are recorded; yet, on the whole, they serve
to
remind us that the epigram is a mark of youth,&mdash;youth cannot
bring
itself to forego the glitter of any of its diamonds,&mdash;and that
Mrs.
Wharton is still in the opening of her summer time, before the
period of her ripest harvests.</p><p>
     The less artistic traits, which revealed themselves at times
in the stories, show a great gain in self-effacement.  Mrs.
Wharton's nervous American energy has become far less tense, less
fitful, far more even and self-controlled.  Her luxuriant
artistic
and literary information is never put obviously forward;
nevertheless, unjustly perhaps, one cannot shake off a somewhat
uncomfortable suspicion that a great deal of the book is rather
the
product of culture than of real human knowledge; that it has been
approached by the circuitous way of the authorities,&mdash;Stendhal,
Bourget, Henry James,&mdash;rather than by grubbing in life
itself.</p><p>
     A matter of greater interest is to see whether Mrs. Wharton
continues to maintain her attitude that fiction must be forced to
accept its creator's arbitrary pattern, or whether she limits
that
view to short stories, and in the matter of novels ranges herself
with those who deem objective reality alone of any value.
Perhaps
a safe answer to such questioning is to say that Mrs. Wharton has
effected a compromise.  She has undoubtedly tried to catch living
traits, and from her success in that respect the book has been
treated as a <hi rend="italic"> roman a clef;</hi> but she has also taken much of
her
color from her book-imbued imagination, possibly for fear of
having
drawn from life too closely.  The motive for compromise, however,
it is more likely, lies in a certain discord between Mrs.
Wharton's
talents.  Her power of observation is admirably adapted to look
directly at facts that lie before her; but her wit tempts her to
satire, and satire is an unfortunate medium through which to
study
humanity.  We may regard human beings as a superior or an
inferior
race of monkeys, but granting that they are monkeys, it would
seem
to be the business of the novelist not to make gibes at them, not
to confront them with more elaborately evolved standards of
living,
but to keep the story on the plane of monkey life.  Satire,
perhaps, is a natural temptation to any observer of life; but
human
inadequacy, inconsistency, folly, may well be left, as life
leaves
them, to be noticed, scorned, pitied, or ignored, according to
the
humour of the observer.  Mrs. Wharton, in her early period,
acquired a habit of using men and women as butts for satire,
masks
for a dialogue, candelabra for epigrams,&mdash;as something other than
human beings living in and for themselves; and that habit is a
hindrance in her present task of studying them humanly.  With her
talents, with her growth in artistic feeling,&mdash;a growth that is
conspicuous throughout <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi>,&mdash;Mrs. Wharton
will,
no doubt, free herself from these trammels.</p><p>
     Even without the deflection of direct <pb n="226" id="SedWhar226"/>
vision caused by
such a habit, it is difficult for novelists to detect the
identifying traits in men and women.  Those most fitted by nature
for such insight require a wide range of study, a comparison of
many species, an intimacy with many individuals of different
education, different habits, different minds.  Not that it is the
business of a novelist to portray different species or diverging
types; but men are so made that the fine characteristics in them,
the fainter qualities, the nicer deviation of thought and action
from the normal, can only be understood after studying such
characteristics, qualities, or deviations where they exist with
greater emphasis.  And it is less easy for a woman than for a
man&mdash;
though nowadays sundry social exclusions and discriminations have
been boldly brushed aside&mdash;to pick and choose her objects of
study.
She is on the whole confined to those that come voluntarily
within
the range of her vision.  Mrs. Wharton, it would appear, has been
limited to one somewhat narrow species of men and women, a
species
in which, perhaps, human nature does not find its freest
expression.  For the purpose of portraiture any species serves as
well as another,&mdash;our interest in an artist's perception of our
fellow beings in exhaustible,&mdash;but to enable an artist to acquire
a knowledge of humanity one species is too narrow a field of
study.
As soon as Mrs. Wharton leaves the Trenor set (supposing that
that
set is taken from life), she is forced to draw, and always more
and
more, upon the stores of her imagination and of her general
literary information.  The Gormers, though they, to be sure, are
but temporary wheels to roll the plot forward, evince a
disinclination to become solid and substantial.  Even Simon
Rosedale, with all the advantages of individuality conferred by
his
race, offers a by no means irrefutable argument for his
verisimilitude.  Mrs. Norma Hatch flutters beyond the frontier of
Mrs. Wharton's experience, and the charwoman, who as a <hi rend="italic"> dea ex
machina</hi> shoves the plot onward, does so very
unhandily.</p><p>
     A statement of the fact that Mrs. Wharton does not give to
her
characters the illusion of reality is no explanation of her
motive
in not doing so.  One vaguely surmises that she feels she cannot
attain the flashes of revelation of the great masters, and
disdains
the counterfeit procured by elaborate descriptions of petty
details, and therefore rests content with her own individual, if
arbitrary, representation of human life.  But one has also a
subsidiary feeling that it is safer to suspend judgment until one
has approached this matter from another point.</p><p>
     This failure to observe the primary tenets of realism is not
the only instance of Mrs. Wharton's disregard of ordinary rules;
she does not adhere to the rule of inevitability.  There is no
inevitable connection between the last chapter of <hi rend="italic"> The House
of
Mirth</hi> and the first; the bottle of chloral may be the last
link of
a chain of which the visit to Seldon's apartment is the first,
but
it does not fasten upon us a sense of necessary connection.  The
reader is in doubt as to the intervening links; he snuffs, as it
were, traces of indecision as to the termination of Lily's
career.
Some law-abiding readers resent the disregard of a rule they
happen
to know, but the ordinary mortal is comfortably pleased to
experience the sentiment of suspense.  A life when lived, a novel
when published, are certain enough,&mdash;why should not a novel in
the
making enjoy the liberty of what, even in life, appears an ample
uncertainty ahead?</p><p>
     The reason for Mrs. Wharton's indecision must perhaps be
sought in the episodical character of her vision; possibly in the
difficulty of discovering the inevitable thread.  A better
solution, justified by the fact that it also explains her neglect
of the commandment of realism, is that, as an artist, she finds
neither rule of advantage to her, and therefore brushes them
aside
with the elegant ease of an American woman passing the customs.
Certainly <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi> shows a <pb n="227" id="SedWhar227"/>
marked advance in
acceptance of responsibility to art, a far larger sense of the
value of composition, and a great increase of power in putting
that
sense to use.  It is her feeling for composition that causes her
to
disregard both literary determinism and realism; these she
deliberately sacrifices for the sake of obtaining the desired
emphasis upon the figure of central interest.  All the minor
characters in the novel are adjuncts and accessories,
illustration
and decoration, to display the commanding figure of Lily Bart;
she
stands conspicuous, and all the others derive their importance
from
their relations to her.  What they do, say, and think, is done,
said, and thought in order to explain and give a high relief to
Lily Bart.  This mastery of composition is the great artistic
achievement of the book, and justifies its immense
success.</p><p>
     Otherwise, except for this power of composition (which
indeed
will have to measure its strength with the old inadequacy of
uniting episodes), Mrs. Wharton in <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi>
displays
no new aptitude, no new sensitiveness, no new accomplishment.
The
plot, wholly apart from any question of determinism, is
uninteresting,&mdash;if one may say this when so many episodes are
extremely interesting.  There is a monotony, due to the iteration
of motive, like that in the dimly remembered figures of the
Lancers
at dancing-school,&mdash;"forward and back," ladies chain,
pirouetting,
and so on, over and over, in interminable sequence.  Lily's
behavior is mechanical; she whirls round and round, fresh and
glittering, like waters in the upper basin of a fountain; then
tumbles into the basin beneath, whirls and eddies with breaking
bubbles, and tumbles again, and so down and down, until at last
her
continual falls from set to set sound painfully like a neglected
faucet.  One might suppose that this would produce what in
current
criticism is called the "note of inevitableness;" but it does
not;
the reader is continually expecting Mrs. Wharton to get up and
turn
it off.</p><p>
     Her failure in the construction of the plot in this respect,
so far as it is due neither to the episodical character of her
vision nor to the imperious demands of composition, is because
she
lacks the talents of a story-teller; for Mrs. Wharton cannot, at
least, she certainly does not, put forward any claim to be a
raconteur.  In the short stories this lack was concealed by her
mastery of the episode, but in <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi> it is
betrayed by the mechanical monotony that, even in all the
brilliancy and glamour of episodes, of epigrams, of Lily herself,
oppresses us with drowsy remembrances as of a too familiar
tune.</p><p>
     The traits of a raconteur belong to persons richly endowed
with bodily life and animal spirits, persons exhilarated by mere
living, who receive accession of vigor from mere physical contact
with other living things; but Mrs. Wharton, as an American woman,
segregates herself from all this; she looks down on life from a
tower, armed indeed with a powerful glass&mdash;the very strength of
her
lenses limits her field;&mdash;but though she observes individuals in
the crowd below as if they were close, she does not touch them,
she
gets none of the physical aroma of immediate juxtaposition, which
is so exciting to the born raconteur.</p><p>
     There is another element that one misses in <hi rend="italic"> The House of
Mirth</hi>, indeed, in all of Mrs. Wharton's books,&mdash;poetry.  To
be
sure, the reader perhaps is exacting, finical, greedy, if he asks
for poetry; he is no "Oliver asking for more," for he has
certainly
partaken of a lordly bill-of-fare; yet he is not without
justification.  There are modern novelists&mdash;Meredith's name alone
would be authority enough&mdash;who look poetically at their subject,
throw over it the haze of their own imagination.  Mrs. Wharton
cannot allege in defense the needs of realism; and if she did,
there is poetry to be found in this real world, even in New
York,&mdash;
to be found, at least, by poets.  Lily herself might seem to be
the
very subject for poetic treatment, so freely posed, so
<pb n="228" id="SedWhar228"/>
strongly modeled, so brilliantly lighted, so exalted on her
pedestal, so persuasive in her physical beauty, and yet so barren
of poetic dower.  The demand for poetry in a novel, however, is
the
idiosyncrasy of certain readers; there is no law, no plebiscite,
no
good reason that novels should be poetical; on the contrary, if a
novel is to mirror ordinary life, especially if it is to mirror
ordinary American life for American readers, it must deal in
prose.
The demand is, in fact, a mere subterfuge; it sneaks forward in
place of an honest demand for a romantic novel.  For, after all,
are not novel-readers in the final allotment divided into two
camps, divided by the two fundamentally diverse conceptions of
fiction: the one of a world parallel to ours, rolling along with
even pace, with like gestures, mimicking the wrinkles, the
matter-of-factness of our old world, repeating our own doings, our own
imaginings, our own yawns; the other rounding out and filling in
this defective world of daily experience, conceiving fiction as
young Goethe or young Hugo conceived it, catching for this poor,
wrinkled, matter-of-fact earth a ray of that brightness which
shone
on the first day of creation?
</p><p>
     The world's unwithered countenance</p><p>
     Is bright as on Creation's day.
</p><p>
     If this is so, can Mrs. Wharton be said to have taken sides?

No doubt the school she consciously inclines to is that of the
parallels; but she has diminished the effect of this inclination
by
her inobservance of the regulations of realism and determinism,
which she has sacrificed for the sake of creating what the other
camp may fairly claim is the romantic effect of Miss Bart
towering
above the other figures.  This uncertainty furnishes another
reason
for believing that Mrs. Wharton has not obtained her full
stature,
that her powers have not yet fully and finally expressed
themselves, and that <hi rend="italic"> The House of Mirth</hi>, with all its
achievement, is most interesting as a promise of more important
novels yet to come.</p><p>
     The mere thought of another novel sets the appetite on edge;
one recalls the eagerness with which readers awaited the next
Thackeray or Dickens, and curiosity with difficulty restrains
impatient expressions, such as encourage passengers entering or
leaving a street car; but one's judgment remembers the Flaubert-Maupassant maxim, "Le talent n'est qu'une longue reflexion," and
hopes that Mrs. Wharton will let the seeds of inspiration slowly
ripen, and, leaving books to book-worms, patiently study the
living, so that, while fulfilling the duties of her position as
Laureate, she shall also completely satisfy herself.
