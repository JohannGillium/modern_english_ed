<head>THE FREE NEGROES OF NORTH CAROLINA.</head>

<p>According to the census of 1860, there were in the United States,
in round numbers, 487,000 free negroes, of which the fifteen slave-holding States contained 251,000.  Virginia stood first, with
58,000; North Carolina second, with 30,000; and in the seven States
south of these, in which the most rigorous free-negro laws
prevailed, there were a total of less than 40,000.  In Virginia
they formed 10.60 per cent. of the negro population, in North
Carolina 8.42 per cent., and in the other seven States alluded to
considerably less than two per cent.
</p><p>There is hardly another instance in the range of history in
which a class as comparatively insignificant in numbers and as
timid and unaggressive in spirit has been the occasion of so much
alarm and disquietude.  The nearest parallel, though by no means a
close one, is perhaps that of the Romanist of England in the latter
part of the seventeenth century.  However, to a candid mind there
can be little doubt as to whether the panic of the English Whigs or
that of the Southern slave-holders had the better foundation in
reason and probability.
</p><p>The laws of almost all the slave-holding States, not even
excepting many that were early to abolish and oppose slavery,
attest plainly enough what an ever-recurring, ever-deepening
problem the free-negro question was from very early colonial times.
In the frequent spasmodic reiteration of such laws we see the
futile attempts either to lay or to largely control this spectre,
which, springing into being at a word, waxed or waned as it was
viewed through the medium of alarm or security.  Still, the
apprehension of which the free negroes were doubtless in nearly
every case the innocent cause was natural, if not reasonable.  Not
that they were formidable within themselves.  Among a homogeneous
people with solidarity of interest their very existence would have
been ignored.  But the slave-owners, like the upholders of all
abnormal, arbitrary institutions, could not but be excessively
suspicious and susceptible to panic.  They dreaded the example and
influence of free blacks dwelling among their enslaved brethren.
They saw in the free negro an instigator and disseminator of
insurrectionary doctrine which he perhaps never thought of, and
gave him credit for a philanthropy and temerity which I am sure he
never possessed.
</p><p>The negro legislation of the South&mdash;indeed, of all the slave-holding States in proportion to the number of slaves and the
consequent danger of insurrection&mdash;was harsh and grim enough, and
it is not my desire to condone it.  For the sake of fairness, I
would only say, in passing, that a man whose house is stored with
deadly explosives can hardly be blamed for placing very severe
restrictions on fire.  The crime and folly in placing and keeping
them there overshadows, if it does not excuse, the rest.  Then
slavery grew into an institution amid, and took the indelible
impress of, an era of rigorous laws and cruel, unnatural
punishments the world over.  Scourgings and brandings, maimings and
hangings, were as a rule inflicted for offenses now deemed
trifling.  Not only were criminals treated with incredible
barbarity, but in the army, the navy, the school, the shop, the
farm, the rod was seldom out of the hand of authority.  Whitefield
himself held it laudable to bring the negro under christianizing
influences, even if the only road lay through slavery; to save
heathen African souls at the expense of heathen African bodies.  I
would also <pb n="21"/>
add that it was the curse of the South to be
chained by self-interest,&mdash;self-preservation they considered it,&mdash;
that despotic controller of conduct, in an attitude towards slavery
which the more disinterested world had outgrown and come to
execrate.
</p><p>To North Carolina belongs the sorry honor of being more
lenient in the execution, if not in the spirit, of her laws
governing this unhappy class than either Virginia or any of the
other Southern States.  Not only did she contain the largest
proportion of whites, Texas alone excepted, and have therefore less
to fear from a servile insurrection, but the negroes, instead of
being collected on large plantations to themselves, were more
generally divided up among smaller owners, in much closer contact
with the whites, better understood, better treated, and
consequently less disposed and less able to inflict harm.  The
number of slave-holders in North Carolina must have been
comparatively very much larger than in the other States, as well as
the number of slaves who were yearly hired out, usually passing
into the families of small non-slave-holding farmers.  This feeling
of comparative safety had its influence in according both the
slaves and free negroes more privileges on sufferance than was
common in the large slave-holding States, though cruel statutes
were not wanting, which were enforced and even exceeded in time of
panic.  Thus the free negroes possessed and exercised the elective
franchise down to the constitutional convention of 1835, one
hundred and twelve years after they had been formally disfranchised
in Virginia.  The same assembly also abolished their schools,
although no penalty was ever imposed for the teaching by a white
person of a negro, slave or free, to read or write.  On this
question, the attitude of the State was similar to that of the
South in general.  They also held real estate, which was prohibited
in many other States, and in some instances even became slave-owners themselves.
</p><p>Although North Carolina modeled her free-negro legislation
largely upon that of Virginia, she never entirely removed every
restriction from manumission, as Virginia did from 1782 to 1805.
Her attitude towards the foreign slave-trade about the same period
was mid-way between that of Virginia and the States to the south.
She neither prohibited it, like Virginia, nor encouraged it, like
South Carolina and Georgia; but contented herself with imposing a
tax on slave importation, and declaring it to be "of evil
consequence and highly impolitic."  Neither did the great movement
for gradual emancipation in Virginia, about 1785, which under the
leadership of Jefferson promised so much for a time, ever find much
favor in this State.
</p><p>Of the proprietary period in North Carolina, which came to an
end in 1729, the colony being then barely seventy years old, there
is only one statute extant restricting the manumission of slaves,
or in any way relating to free negroes.  This act marks the
adoption of a policy subsequently modified and never rigidly
enforced except in periods of alarm, but still to the last never
wholly abandoned.  This policy had its root in the generally
accepted theory of the incompatibility of slaves and free blacks in
the same community, and its end was the expulsion and exclusion of
the latter.  The act permitted the manumission of "good and orderly
slaves" for "honest and faithful service," but the freedman must
forthwith depart the province forever, under penalty of being sold
to any one who would transport him out of the country.  Had this
law been strictly carried out, the tender of freedom to a creature
as ignorance and as helpless as the slave perforce was would have
been only mockery.  For philanthropy at large had not yet taken
note of him, if indeed it had of anything, with practical
<pb n="22"/>
effect.  But the presence of nearly 5000 slaves in the State at the
census of 1790 proves either that the act had fallen into disuse,
or that their immigration from Virginia was tolerated, as it was
later on in quiet times.  Indeed, a considerable sprinkling of free
negroes from this State served in the white regiments through the
whole war of the Revolution.  Several distinguished themselves.
Local tradition preserves the memory of one by the name of Dibby,
of noted bravery.  He lived to a great age, and I have heard old
men tell of his indignant protest at the polls when his ballot was
refused at the next election after the disfranchising convention of
1835.  Several large tracts of land in this vicinity were, during
the latter part of the last century, the property of free negroes.
One was a school-teacher and the neighborhood scribe.  Several
deeds in his handwriting are still preserved.  The children of some
of the best families in the neighborhood were numbered among his
pupils.  In fact, negroes, slave and free, were to some extent
employed as teachers in several States, about that date.  It is
clear that either the bitter race prejudice of later times was then
much less strong, or that the calling of teacher was less regarded.
Doubtless both conditions were true.  It is well known that the
former was largely a thing of more recent growth; while neither the
Old World nor some portions of the New seem then to have been very
particular as to who had either mind or soul in charge.
</p><p>After the Revolution, public opinion, and consequent
legislation to the detriment of this class and the race in general,
had received marked impulse from two different, though collateral,
sources.  The first of these was the aggressive emancipatory spirit
of the North, which found national expression in the famous Quaker
memorial to Congress in 1790; the other, the periodic alarms of
anticipated insurrection of the slaves,&mdash;above all, the Nat Turner
insurrection, just over the Virginia border, in 1831.
</p><p>Largely to resentment against the abolitionism of the North,
and perhaps partly to a dread lest the newly liberated blacks of
the North should gravitate towards the great mass of their race at
the South, importing the dangerous doctrines of discontent and
insurrection as they came, may be ascribed the first series of
those laws passed in 1795.  The first act, passed in 1795,
compelled all free negroes entering the State to give bond in the
sum of &pound;200 for their good behavior, which was virtual exclusion,
as it was doubtless intended to be.  Manumitted slaves were
permitted to remain on the same condition, which, with the aid of
their emancipators, they sometimes succeeded in complying with.
Failing to give the bond, and persisting in remaining in the State,
both classes forfeited their freedom.  An act passed in 1796 was
still more stringent.  According to this, no slave could be
manumitted except for meritorious services, to be adjudged by the
county court, the bond as to future behavior being still required.
It will be noticed that, while the Northern States required a bond
to guard against a manumitted slave falling on the public for
support, the large slave-holding States took that means to prevent
his tampering with the slaves; each section guarding against what
it had most to fear.  Closely following the above act came another,
requiring six weeks' notice to be given preceding the term of the
court which would be prayed to confirm the deed of manumission.
With increased severity, it compelled the freedman to give bond in
the sum of $1000 to quit the State in ninety days after
manumission.  It further enacted that no deed of manumission should
work to the detriment of an emancipator's creditors.
</p><p>At this time North Carolina was less merciful to the free
negro than Virginia.  The former leaned, in theory at least,
<pb n="23"/>
rather to the policy of South Carolina and Georgia.  But the period
from 1799 to 1801 was a time of great excitement and apprehension
of insurrection in Virginia.  The result was that the act of 1782,
facilitating the manumission of slaves, and taking all restrictions
from their residence in that State, was repealed, and measures of
unwonted severity were adopted.  This alarm also extended to North
Carolina, and actuated the only legislation of consequence on the
subject for many years after that of 1795.  The inference from the
fact that no supplemental legislation of this nature followed for
nearly thirty years is that either the working of the laws was
satisfactory,&mdash;a quality never characteristic of such acts,&mdash;or
that they were but the expression of a passing mood of the public
mind, and that they lost their vitality when the mood changed.  If
the concurrent tradition of the country is to be believed, the
latter was the case.  Numbers of free negroes, especially in the
northern tier of counties, agree in the statement that their
forefathers came over from Virginia about sixty or eighty years
ago, and that they were unhindered.  Here they found cheaper lands,
and laws, in their execution at least, more lenient, as well as a
social attitude less hostile than in aristocratic Virginia.  That
this immigration was considerable is to be gathered from the fact
that quite a third of the free-negro population of the State was to
be found in the counties contiguous to Virginia.  The presence of
large numbers in some of the southern counties leads to the belief
that there was also some immigration of this class from South
Carolina, though in a much less degree.  However, free negroes were
to be found in every county in the State, ranging from less than a
dozen in some of the western to more than two thousand in some of
the eastern counties.
</p><p>Bordering on Virginia, and occurring at various intervals from
the sea-coast to the mountains, there were considerable areas then
considered too poor for profitable cultivation.  A meagre, whitish
soil, thirsty and unrecuperative, afforded grudging sustenance to
a puny, grotesque growth of blackjack and chincapin, even the
renovating pine&mdash;the badge of the State&mdash;being in many places a
rarity.  They were dreary, poverty-stricken regions, inhabited
almost exclusively by poor non-slave-holding whites, and selling up
to the war often as low as one dollar an acre.  The slave-holders
and more substantial immigrants settled farther inward, along the
streams, or on the stiffer lands, then alone regarded fit for
producing tobacco.  However, I will add that the development of the
bright tobacco industry&mdash;for which this soil, aided by commercial
fertilizers, is wonderfully adapted&mdash;has very recently made this
the most prosperous part of the State.
</p><p>To this section the free negroes had been straggling over from
Virginia from a very early period.  And although their immigration
into the State was prohibited, under heavy penalty, by the acts of
1795,&mdash;supplemented by still more stringent ones, none of which
were ever repealed,&mdash;they continued to come, almost up to the war
of secession.  In some cases their coming was doubtless
surreptitious, but usually, by selecting a quiet period, and
settling in a favorable neighborhood, they ran little or no risk of
having the law enforced against them.  They rarely, at any rate
towards the last, penetrated very deep into the State: partly
because they feared opposition; partly because they attached a
vague idea of safety to the border; mainly because there lands were
cheap, and the poor white population not averse to their
settlement.  For the land-owners, being in need of labor, found it
much cheaper to employ them than to hire slaves.  It was only in
such neighborhoods that the free negro could ever hope to become a
freeholder.  The lands farther inwardsubs were
<pb n="24"/>  not only more
valuable, but also in the hands of large owners, who rarely sold
unless constrained by debt, or desirous of moving West.  Land at
the South was, in a stronger sense than elsewhere, considered the
final investment of money.  Least of all would the nervous slave-owner have been disposed to sell to this half-feared, half-despised
class.  But the poor whites of the border, with no slaves to be
corrupted, owned more or less poor land, for which they were glad
to find purchasers, tenants, or laborers.  Yet notwithstanding the
merely nominal price of land, a large majority of these immigrants
always remained too poor to become freeholders, squatting instead
on barren, worn-out corners, or along rocky, untillable ridges; the
convenience of having this docile, uncomplaining help within call
being deemed a fair compensation for the equally superfluous wood
and water they consumed.  In some instances they were tenants at
will by a tenure not unlike the milder types of feudalism.
</p><p>A very few prospered, bought larger and better farms, and even
owned slaves,&mdash;one as many as thirty,&mdash;which they held up to
general emancipation.  But generally, when they bought land at all,
the purchase was ludicrously small, and, in the country phrase, "so
po' it couldn't sprout er pea dout grunt'n."  On these
infinitesimal bits they built flimsy log huts, travesties in every
respect of the rude dwellings of the earliest white settlers.  The
timber growth being often too scant to afford fence rails, their
little patches of phantom corn mixed with pea-vines&mdash;or, rather,
stubs, their little quota of hulls akimbo on top&mdash;were encircled by
brush fences, which even by dint of annual renewals were scarcely
to be regarded by a beast of average hunger and enterprise.
</p><p>The subsidence of the alarm of 1802 was followed by nearly
thirty years of comparative quiet.  So far these alarms had, with
scarcely an exception, ended in smoke, leaving little permanent
impress on the popular mind.  The unfathomable race prejudice of
later years had not yet developed into a mania.  Negrophobia was
then a hardly known malady.  The resentment against the antislavery
spirit of the North had not yet been poured out on the head of the
negro.  The attitude of the races towards each other was widely
different from what it afterwards became.  But about 1830, a
growing mistrust on the part of the whites manifested itself.
Abolitionism, hitherto the hobby of visionaries and isolated
philanthropists, had now grown to be the watchword of a militant,
uncompromising party.  Its subtle leaven permeated the whole
country, encouraging the slave, exasperating the master.  It would
be curious to know what were the real grounds of these panics.  But
in all history there are fewer mysteries more insolvable.
Secretiveness is the chief characteristic of the negro, and on this
subject, above all others, he is immovably silent.  It seems most
probable that there was general disquiet among the slaves at these
periods, but no far-reaching conspiracy.  That the scare was out of
all proportion to the danger is not to be doubted.  The mystery and
uncertainty that shrouded the whole matter left the imagination
full play.  Still, all the white survivors of that time that I have
questioned agree in maintaining that a great change came over the
negroes.  They are said to have suddenly become less joyous, more
reticent and thoughtful.  Large meetings of a quasi-religious
character were held in secret.  Prayer meetings found their scores
swell into hundreds.  By incredible journeys between sun and sun
representatives from many counties frequently attended the same
meeting.  Then the memorable sun spots of 1831 undoubtedly wrought
on the superstition of both races.  Apprehension took hold of the
whites; it grew into alarm, and burst into panic when Nat Turner
<pb n="25"/>
and his followers began their midnight butcheries just over the
Virginia border.
</p><p>In general it might be said that the fears of the people spoke
in framing the negro laws, their hearts in executing them.  But on
occasions like this, it was the reverse.  All the dead laws were
hunted up, put into execution, and exceeded.  Patrolling, the
greatest of all hardships to the sociable, restless negro, not
hitherto common in this State, now became a system, strict and
unsparing.
</p><p>This highly wrought state of the public mind naturally found
expression in legislation.  Minor acts of this nature were passed
in 1830, and in the following year legislation began in earnest.
>From then till 1837 the statute book abounds in stringent laws
against slaves and free negroes.
</p><p>Whenever servile insurrection arose or was apprehended, the
free negro seems to have fallen under even greater suspicion than
the slave.  He was half believed to value his freedom solely as a
means to sow discontent among the slaves.  The fact that he was out
of all sympathy with them, that really a strong dislike existed
between the two, did not exonerate him.  It was doubtless regarded
as but another proof of his astute dissimulation.  It was made
unlawful to free any slave under fifty years of age, and then it
could be effected only as a reward for meritorious services.  Such
persons were allowed to remain in the State on giving bond in five
hundred dollars for their "good behavior."  A fine of five hundred
dollars was imposed for bringing a free negro into the State, and
he must leave in twenty days or be sold, for ten years.  If a
native free negro left the State for ninety days, he could never
return.
</p><p>The state convention called in 1835, to amend the
constitution, among other important changes, such as the
disfranchisement of the boroughs and the removal of the
gubernatorial election from the legislature to the people, also
disfranchised the free negroes.  Hitherto there had existed in this
State the strange anomaly of a class incompetent to testify in
court, and otherwise almost as destitute of rights as brutes,
exercising a function everywhere deemed the first of privileges,
and which the vast mass of freemen in the most enlightened
countries of the world are yet striving to attain.  But even prior
to their disfranchisement the free negroes were too timid and
lethargic ever to possess even the modicum of political influence
to which their numbers would seem to have entitled them.  In a few
of the northern counties only do they ever seem to have become an
object to demagogues.  There is still a tradition among them in
Granville County that they lost the franchise on account of their
persistent support of the notorious Potter.  Potter, though a man
of parts and a natural orator, was a consummate demagogue and a
violent, unscrupulous man, whose new departure in iniquity evoked
special legislation.  Toward the last, the free negroes falling
more and more into disrepute, their support carried such a stigma
with it as to be an element of weakness rather than of strength to
a candidate.  More than one candidate of those days, twitted by his
opponent on the stump about this element of his constituency,
retorted by declaring his willingness to throw out every free-negro
ballot, if his assailant would do likewise.
</p><p>After this period, the life of the free negro grew unspeakably
harder.  Not so much that the laws were harsher, but because the
attitude of the whites became and continued more hostile.  Neither
the harshness nor the leniency of the laws was of great moment to
him, who could in no wise put them in operation even for his own
protection.  His lot added the disability of the slave to the
responsibility of the freeman.  Dependent on his own industry and
enterprise, as the slave was not, he found the field of his labor
contracted, till subsistence
<pb n="26"/>  became a formidable
problem indeed.  Except among the non-slave-holding farmers, who were
often too poor to pay him sufficient hire to sustain life, he could find
little employment that did not bring him in contact with the slave,
while the main end of public policy was to keep them as far apart
as possible.  Intermarriage and social intercourse were of course
strictly forbidden by law.  With him, all depended on the temper of
the whites among whom he lived.  If they were kind and well
disposed, he had little to complain of.  But if they were cruel or
alarmist, his condition was pitiable beyond words.  Then all his
movements were closely watched, and his actions ingeniously
tortured to sinister ends.  If, in quest of employment, he ventured
out of his immediate neighborhood and neglected to take his free
papers, he got into serious trouble.  Even carrying them in his
pocket, if his actions aroused suspicion and his explanation was
not at once prompt, lucid, and consistent, he also got into
trouble.  Dumb as a witness against the dominant race, he not
infrequently became the object of the spite of malicious white men,
or the wanton cruelty of heartless, unthinking striplings.
</p><p>It is not to be wondered that the free negroes, unelastic and
prone to unthrift, underwent still further deterioration.  Cowed,
perplexed, and dispirited, they huddled together on any scant,
sterile bit of land that they were fortunate enough to be possessed
of, erected clusters of their frail little huts, and like
oppressed, hopeless classes the world over sunk into profound
listlessness and sloth.  The women grew unchaste, the men
dishonest, until in many minds the term "free negro" became a
synonym for all that was worthless and despicable.  Their
settlements were commonly contiguous to some town; the counties in
which were located Raleigh, Wilmington, New Berne, and Fayetteville
containing nearly a fourth of all the free negroes in the State, in
which the apter males became barbers, fiddlers, or Jacks-of-all-trades.  Some followed ditching, well-digging, and such work as was
considered too perilous or too unhealthy to risk slaves in its
performance.  I never knew a neighborhood without a free-negro
shoemaker.  In fact, they were largely, perforce, a class of
piddlers; and like piddlers everywhere more indispensable than any
other element of the community.  The majority kept soul and body
together with the product of their sterile little patches, eked out
with a petty traffic in the rude articles of their own make, such
as chairs, splint baskets, horse-collars and door-mats made from
shucks and bark, "dug" troughs, bread-trays, etc.  Many derived
almost their whole living from the sale of ginger cakes, and
watermelons, wild nuts, and fruits when in season, at the
neighboring towns, or on Saturdays and "big" days at the cross-road
stores and country post-offices.
</p><p>In some of the county seats, during court week, an aged
specimen of this latter type is still occasionally to be seen
selling ginger cakes.  Generally tall, meagre, stooping, slouching,
for all the world the color of his own wares, he lounges half
listlessly, half dejectedly, on the shafts of the little steer-cart
bearing his antiquated confections, silently awaiting the customers
that never seem to come nowadays.  He and his cakes are almost the
sole survivors of ante-bellum days.  But in all his silent musings
it seems not to have occurred to him that he is an anachronism.
That he is still catering to the obsolete gastronomy of a long-gone
generation, and that his goodies are caviare to their
grandchildren, has never entered his mind.  At least, if it has, he
is too staunch a quietist or pessimist, no one knows which, to care
much.  He has seen the primitive wooden court house supplanted by
a pretentious brick one; the once boundless court-house green
contracted and contracted,
<pb n="27"/>  till the pitiless
march of brick and mortar has left him no stopping place save an unsafe and
ignoble one in the gutter.  He has seen man and nature change, but
it has never suggested new methods, any more than the fact that
people quit eating home-made ginger cakes a generation ago has
suggested the advisability of discontinuing their manufacture.
Like the persistent sibyl of old, his serene confidence in his
wares is not a jot abated because they are ignored of men and have
diminished in quantity.  And there he will be every court week,
more punctual than judge or jury, till some hard-hearted board of
town commissioners pronounce him a nuisance, when he will
uncomplainingly take a remoter stand, unless perchance before then
death the gleaner should follow in the swath of death the reaper.
</p><p>To one acquainted with the stringent laws against the
manumission of slaves and against the immigration of free negroes,
and not with the impunity with which those laws were disregarded,
the number of free negroes in the State might well be a matter of
wonder.  From the infancy of the colony in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, the laws placed every bar in the way of
manumission short of total and absolute prohibition.  First, only
the "good and orderly" slaves could be set free for "honest and
faithful" service.  Later on, when it became the custom to construe
these qualifications too liberally, the power of determining these
was removed from the master to the county court, which was
essentially the same as the method in the other Southern States.
Still later, a slave must be over fifty years of age before he
could be set free at all.  Excepting for a very short period, the
latter class of freedmen were the only ones permitted to remain in
the State, although under bond for their behavior.  For even the
law of 1795, which permitted free negroes to enter and reside
within the State on giving a bond of &pound;200, tantamount to
prohibition, was soon repealed.  True, occasionally the legislature
did, by special enactment, sanction the manumission of slaves, and
also suspend the banishing clause.  But the number manumitted in
this way must have been comparatively small.
</p><p>But as the laws were often exceeded or disregarded to the
negro's harm, so also were they sometimes exceeded or disregarded
in his favor.  Many industrious, thrifty slaves, especially
mechanics, not only hired themselves in the face of a law
forbidding it, but with money thus earned bought their own freedom,
and sometimes that of their families, and remained in the State
unmolested.  Of course the whole transaction was informal and
illegal, and in the eyes of the law they were the property of their
former master.  But they were practically free men, and I never
heard of a case in which a master proved treacherous.  Nor would
the community have countenanced such an act.
</p><p>I knew of a very touching instance in which a free negro
became the purchaser, though not the owner, of his family.  He was
a blacksmith, and had married a slave woman, by whom he had several
children.  His shop was on her master's farm, where he was liked
and kindly treated.  But finally the master got involved in debt,
and all of his slaves, among them the blacksmith's family, were
seized by the creditors and sold to a speculator, who resold them
in Mississippi.  The husband, who was then forehanded, went
desperately to work, and in a few years scraped together sufficient
money, placed it in their first owner's hand, and got him to
repurchase and bring back from the terrible South the loved ones;
content that they should remain slaves&mdash;for the temper of the
neighborhood was hostile to manumission&mdash;so that he need not be
separated from them.
</p><p>Several large slave-holders in the eastern part of the State
not only set their
<pb n="28"/>  slaves free by will, with legislative
sanction, but also gave them an outfit and paid their passage to
Liberia.  But bills of manumission were not always sure of passage.
All depended on the mood of the legislature.  A noted politician,
since the war conspicuous for his eccentricities as well as for his
services to the State, is said to have opposed one of these bills,
by which a very old man sought power to free his slaves at his
death, in the following speech: "Mr. Speaker, this old man is a
slave-holder, the son of a slave-holder, the grandson of a slave-holder.  He inherited slaves without compunction, and has held and
enjoyed them far beyond the span of most human lives without a
qualm.  He never seems to have realized the sinfulness of slavery
as long as it was useful to himself.  Now that he totters on the
brink of the grave he would fain propitiate an offended God by an
offering that costs him nothing.  Like a mediaeval reprobate
bequeathing his all to the church, he would buy heaven, but his
heir must pay for it.  I can see no justice in that.  He has waited
too late.  And now, sir, if that is his only chance of heaven, and
my vote avails anything, I shall keep him out.  I vote nay."  I
think the bill was lost.
</p><p>In the excitement preceding the war, as well as in the
disorder attending it, these mud-sills of society, of course, had
the hardest lot of all.  They fared badly, not because they were
the objects of any special ill-will,&mdash;all fears of servile trouble
being eclipsed and forgotten in the pressing exigencies of the
hour,&mdash;but simply because they were unprotected in a period of
general confusion and irresponsibility.  Some few were seized and
sold as slaves, their feeble protest being drowned in the tumult.
All males within the drafting age of from eighteen to forty-five
were compelled to serve the Confederacy as laborers on the
fortifications, unless already acting as servants for officers in
the field.  Most of the free negroes served in the latter capacity,
but few officers being willing to risk their slaves so near the
Federal lines.  As laborers on the fortifications they received the
same pay as white privates, while those that served the officers
were still better paid by the individuals employing them.  About
the beginning of the war the question was mooted of compelling all
free negroes to choose masters and become slaves, or be forthwith
expelled the State; but it was soon lost sight of in the stress of
affairs, if indeed it was ever seriously entertained.
</p><p>At the close of the war the appellations "Old Issue" and "New
Issue," to distinguish the free from the freed negroes, were
invented by the latter.  The blacks are quick at appropriating new
words, and sometimes very original in applying them; and this
instance came about as follows: Early in 1864, when Confederate
money had greatly depreciated in value, it was rumored that the
government was about to make a new issue of notes, whose purchasing
value would be fixed by law, and that they would bring back the
good old time prices.  While those competent to judge must have
known better, popular expectation was on tiptoe.  Wonders were
fondly hoped for from this magic "New Issue."  It came.  Almost the
only effect was at once to still farther depreciate the "Old
Issue," while prices went steadily upward.  The war ended while
these terms were still fresh in the popular mind, and the only
result of this great financial scheme was to add two words&mdash;"Ol'
Isshy" and "New Isshy"&mdash;to the negro's scant vocabulary.  The terms
were expressive and appropriate, and no one now thinks of using any
other.
</p><p>The war ended, a radically new era began.  Life and thought,
with a sharp wrench, assumed new lines.  The social kaleidoscope,
shaken by the rude hand of war, shivered, and was recast into
<pb n="29"/>  strangely new forms.  The slave, suddenly metamorphosed into a
free man, struck out for himself with more or less energy and
judgment, but nevertheless under a new impulse.  His quondam
master, though stunned for a while, finally dropped into a new rut,
and began life anew.  But the effect on this neutral class was
comparatively slight.  His sloth was too profound, his isolation
too complete, he was too far out of sympathy with his surroundings,
to feel with effect the impulse of the new order of things.  He saw
the war end, and oppression and disability cease, with his inherent
listlessness.  Almost wholly destitute of the vigor and elasticity
of the freedman and of the industrious habits which the latter had
perforce acquired as a slave, the "Ol' Isshy" remains to-day
largely an alien to the strivings and aspirations of his
contemporaries.  Some, well to do at the end of the war, failing to
catch the new drift, have become impoverished.  The line of
demarkation between the Old and New "Isshy" is not only still
plainly visible, but bids fair long to continue so.  Associating
but little with each other, intermarriage is not common.  A free
negro who marries a freed one almost invariably loses caste, and is
disowned by his people.  The freedmen make no secret of their
dislike and contempt for the other class, which is reciprocated by
feelings more covert, but perhaps still deeper.  In their habits,
manner, and dress the free negroes still resemble, as they always
did, the poorest class of whites much closer than they do the
freedmen.
</p><p>Of course the cause of the comparative retrogradation of this
class is to be found in the innate indolence and shiftlessness of
the race, superinduced by their exceptionally unfavorable
conditions of life under the old <hi rend="italic">regime</hi>, the influence of
which will doubtless not be entirely spent for many generations.
Both instinct and environment have been against them.  But there
are two factors that have worked together to form or intensify the
former that I have not yet seen duly noticed.  The first of these
lies in the fact that they are almost wholly a hybrid race, and
therefore deficient in stamina, as hybrid races are in general and
the mulatto in particular.  According to the census of 1860, fifty-five per cent. of all the free-negro population consisted of
mulattoes, a proportion eight times greater than existed among the
slaves.  Of course the proportion of those with blood more or less
mixed was very much larger.  Indeed, of all the hundreds of free
negroes that I have known from childhood, I cannot now recall a
dozen black or very dark ones.  Hardly a neighborhood was free from
low white women who married or cohabited with free negroes.  Well
can I recollect the many times when, with the inconsiderate
curiosity of a child, I hurriedly climbed the front gate-post to
get a good look at a shriveled old white woman trudging down the
lane, who, when young, I was told, had had her free-negro lover
bled, and drank some of his blood, so that she might swear she had
negro blood in her, and thus marry him without penalty.  Since I
became a man I have heard it corroborated by those who knew, and I
still occasionally see the children of this tragic marriage, now
grown old men.
</p><p>The other factor in their decadence&mdash;or perhaps more
correctly, another cause of their torpor and inelasticity&mdash;is the
considerable infusion of Indian blood generally diffused by
exclusive intermarriage in their own class, and which has unduly
asserted itself owing to their irregular mode of life for many
generations.  From the nature of the case, the extent of this
infusion is of course hard to approximate.  If the account of the
free negro himself is to be received, it is large, though his
anxiety to disown all negro affinity causes one to receive his

<pb n="30"/>
statement with caution and allowance.  But, tradition aside,
many, if not the larger part, of the free negroes whose freedom
dates back further than this century show traits of mind and body
that are unmistakably Indian.  In many instances, long, coarse,
straight black hair and high cheek-bones are joined with
complexions whose duskiness disclaims white blood and with features
clearly un-African.  True, these extreme types are the exception;
but the majority shade up to it more or less closely.  These traits
are more noticeable among women, forming no exception to the usual
accentuation of racial characteristics in the female.  The mental
qualities of unrecuperativeness and transcendent indolence of a
drowsy, listless type, coupled with lurking vindictiveness, all
point the same way.
</p><p>My neighborhood contains an "Ol' Isshy" town, a petrified
remnant of the past, hardly an exaggeration of the general type, in
which the above race marks are to be seen in their full
development.  It stands about five miles from the railroad station,
and consists of some half a dozen families, scantily provided with
fathers, crowded into as many little huts scattered here and there
on a "slipe" of very poor, rocky ridge.  Here they have vegetated
for several generations since their ancestors immigrated from
Virginia, early in the century.  They are intensely clannish and
loyal to each other, timid and suspicious of the outside world, of
which they are incredibly ignorant.  Many of the women have grown
old without ever seeing the cars or having been in a town, although
almost within sight of both.  They still cherish boundless respect
for the class that are to them, and to them alone, "rich folks,"
coupled with an abiding dislike of the "New Isshy," especially if
he is black.  A marriage, even a <hi rend="italic">liaison</hi>, with one would be
instantly fatal to the reputation of any female among them, though,
excepting the African, the children of many, in point of variety of
color at least, might serve to illustrate the five races of
mankind.  After their own immediate class, they associate almost
wholly with the poorest whites, though not quite as equals.
</p><p>Till the reduction of the revenue tax, a few years ago,
rendered "blockading" no longer profitable, the whole settlement
was engaged, in connection with several white men, nearly as poor
as themselves, in a petty traffic in illicit tobacco.  The tobacco,
after being stemmed and prepared in the lofts of their little huts
and pressed in the woods, was smuggled off at night for sale in the
eastern part of the State.  The quality of the product was
necessarily of the sorriest, and the annual profit must have been
paltry in the extreme.  But it fended the wolf after a fashion; the
labor required was trifling and intermittent, while the spice of
danger was doubtless grateful as giving some zest to the monotonous
languor of their lives.  For years they did literally nothing else,
save perhaps a still pettier traffic in unlicensed whiskey, which
I suspect they have not yet abandoned.  Cold, hunger, even fatigue,
they seem indifferent to, but labor when it assumes the form of a
task appalls them.  Even the children, instead of proclaiming their
wants with the unthinking clamor characteristic of childhood, pine
and dwindle in silence, seeming to regard hunger as the normal
condition of life.
