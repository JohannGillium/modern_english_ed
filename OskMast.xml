<p>ON the cattle ranges of the Indian Territory ten years ago he was
known as "the Runt," because he was several inches shorter than the
average puncher.  His other title of "Hanner" had been fastened
upon him by a ludicrous incident in his youth.  "Hanner the Runt"
was a half-breed Cherokee cow-boy, who combined with the stoicism
of the Indian something of the physical energy and mental weakness
of his white father.  One of his shoulders was knocked down a
quarter of a foot lower than the other, two ribs had been "caved
in" on his left side, and a scar high up on his cheek-bone
indicated a stormy life.  It was a matter of speculation in the
cow-camps as to the number of times Hanner had been thrown from
horses and discharged by his employers; he would have been called
the foot-ball of fate had these cow-boys been modern and college-bred.
</p><p>No trick that was ever perpetrated upon him, no service that
another imposed upon him, no jeer flung straight in his face, could
destroy the innocent trust he felt in humanity.  Bill Seymour had
caused him to break his ribs by falling from a wild pony, and had
then thrashed the puncher who laughed at the fall.  In this way
Hanner had become the slave of Seymour.
</p><p>The two, Seymour and Hanner, now rode for Colonel Clarke, and
were generally together.  It was convenient for Seymour to have his
"vallet" to do his work, and it was the chief joy of Hanner's
uncolored existence to do something for the man who had fought for
him.  The grotesque little figure never stopped to ask whether his
friend were worthy of his devotion.  Bill Seymour was a short,
athletic fellow, and good to look upon, but he bore in his nature
a too large share of the devil to be dependable.  Silent, gruff,
and capable when sober, he became a laughing, steel-hearted fury
when drunk, and he got drunk as often as he could reach liquor.
More than Hanner had felt the sting of his quirt as Bill reeled
laughing and jesting on the streets, and had feared to show the
anger that rose in their hearts.  He made enemies when drunk, and
gravely apologized to them in his sober days.  One man, a traveling
cattle-buyer, braver than most, and not knowing his man, had drawn
a small pistol and shot the puncher in the
<pb n="328"/>
body.  Bill, who
was not hurt at all seriously, laughingly strode up to the shooter,
seized the weapon, and pointing at his feet, said:
</p><p>"Now dance for me, you impident son of a mosquito!  Dance till
you drop!  Tryin' to plug me with a toy like that &mdash; a cursed little
thirty-two!"  He flung the pistol noisily into the street, caught
the man by one ear, and slapped his face.
</p><p>There is one time in the year when the cow-puncher feels that
he must get away from his work and indulge in a "good time."  He
does not know the significance of the Fourth of July except in a
hazy way, but he does know that on that day he may have abundant
whisky for the buying, even though its sale be prohibited by law.
He knows, too, that he will find at the big celebrations in the
Territory all his friends and enemies worth meeting and fighting;
and this meeting of friends and fighting of enemies gives the spice
of variety to his life.
</p><p>As the two companions rode to the largest town in the
Territory on the morning of the Fourth, one could see that their
outfits were typical of themselves.  Bill Seymour rode the best and
fastest horse on the ranch; his saddle was new and modern in make,
his spurs rare and shanked long &mdash; only a leader of cow-boy fashions
had dared to wear them; his hat was a Stetson, and hardly
discolored by the weather.  Hanner might have fitted himself up
from the ranch dump-heap.  Two old, unmated spurs dangled from a
pair of "run-over" boot-heels, the patched corduroy trousers he
wore had been traded to him long ago by his champion, and between
the bottom of a dirty waistcoat and the top of his trousers there
showed a greasy cartridge-belt, with scattering cartridges stuck in
it.  A "floppy" black hat, which almost concealed his dark, pinched
features, completed the queer figure.  The pony he rode was called
"Pignuts," and was knotty and scrubby and tough enough to deserve
the title.
</p><p>"Bill, ye ain't a-goin' to git drunk to-day, are ye?  They say
they's goin' to be a lot of extra marshals 'at ain't lettin' any
drunk walk the streets to-day.  I wish ye wouldn't drink too much,
Bill!"  Remembering other celebrations, Hanner wished to get
through the day with as little trouble on Bill's account as
possible.
</p><p>"Oh, go to the devil, you old woman!  Who said I was goin' to
get drunk?  Somethin' I never do.  Come on; let's ride up," Bill
replied shortly; and the two galloped into town through a cloud of
dust raised by many incoming wagons.
</p><p>"Hello, Lem!  How's the Convict?  Keepin' healthy now, Smear?
What's the show and the price?"  Bill greeted the punchers from the
ranches in all parts of the country with a familiarity possible
only to one who knows and does and dares as much as the best of
them.
</p><p>"Got the dangdest mule fer buckin' down here they's goin' to
have rode to-day ye ever seen.  Five dollars in it fer the man that
rides it.  Why don't ye try, Hanner?"  The Convict winked at Bill,
and insinuatingly confronted the Runt with the question.
</p><p>"I don't hardly think this here saddle of mine 'u'd stand it,"
the Runt returned, after glancing at Seymour.  "Think I'd better
try it, Bill?"
</p><p>"Get your bloomin' neck broke if you do, but I expect it 'u'd
be good for you.  Yes, go ahead and ride it, and I'll lend you this
saddle."
</p><p>Bill's words were spoken in jest, but Hanner meditated upon
them seriously during the day, and when the vicious mule was led
out for its first trial, Seymour noted with some anxiety that his
own saddle was buckled upon it.  He was careless with drink now,
and grinned in anticipation of the sorry figure the Runt would
present astride the mule.  He made a foolish drunken wager that
"Hanner'll stay with that there mule till its tongue sticks out and
it can't hump its back any more."
</p><p>The bucking mule was the closing scene in the day's spectacle.
The high-heeled, stiff-muscled cow-boys had chased a greased pig
over a fifty-acre field, and been sadly beaten by the street boys
of the town; they had pitched rings at the heads of canes over the
handles of cheap penknives, and wasted their efforts trying for a
gilded watch pegged down with a large-handled awl; they had ridden
in the tourney, flying past rings hung in the air, and picking them
off with wooden spears, causing strangers to gaze with open-eyed
wonder at their dash and recklessness; they had bucked the scores
of games which gamblers had devised to part the fool and his money,
and were gathered now to watch a game they could understand and
appreciate.
</p><p>Out of a knot of excited men Hanner went straight to the
waiting, restless mule.  With a mock air of bravado he struck the
excited mule across the flank with his sombrero, after roughly
seizing the reins.  No one who has not learned by experience how to
mount a
<pb n="329"/>
plunging horse can understand how Hanner lifted
himself out of the chaos of rearing mule and struggling attendants
into the saddle before he signed to the men to turn the animal
loose.
</p><p>When the mule found itself free to act there was a momentary
pause.  Then began the short, nasty jumps straight into the air,
with the animal's back bowed, its legs stiff, and its head lowered.
It was the first powerful effort of the angered beast, made with
devilish confidence.  Hanner was scarcely shaken by these first
straight jumps, but then began the twisting series, which is the
second expedient of a bucking animal.  A jump high into the air,
with a seemingly impossible twist to the side, landed the mule with
its head turned almost half round.  Before the rider caught his
breath another jump and another half-turn were made.  These are the
motions that make a bronco-buster's life shorter.  Hanner was
bleeding at the nose in half a minute.  The twisting jumps were
continued until the strength of the mule was almost exhausted, and
as yet only the hat of the puncher had been dislodged.  A short
pause followed, during which the mule changed its tactics, and
Hanner thwacked its sweaty neck with his open hand.  The next
motion was a sudden rearing by the mule.  As it rose on its hind
legs the rider yanked fiercely on the reins, and, slipping to the
ground on one side, allowed the brute to fall on its back.  The
saddle-horn buried itself in the earth, and the mule's hoofs beat
the air a moment before it scrambled to its feet.
</p><p>Hanner was cooler than the mule now, and swung himself back
into the saddle with the first long leap of the desperate animal.
This was the easy part of the trial for the rider, and the
spectacular part for the world.
<pb n="330"/>
The mule ran straight away
for the opposite fence of the fair-grounds with long, lunging
jumps, rising and pitching forward with the speed of a racing
yacht.  Hanner brought his craft about before it sailed into the
fence, and beat it fore and aft with a flourishing hand.  He was
wild with triumph now, his hair blowing in the wind.  He leaned
forward as in a race, urging the thoroughly tired and conquered
mule straight for the crowd.  A particularly vicious dig with the
spurs made the beast plunge into the scattering knot of spectators
and rise to a four-barred gate.  At the opposite side of the track
no fence barred its way, and it ran, frightened and quivering,
under the awning of a lemonade-vender's stand, scattering glasses
and confections to the winds, and wrecking the stand.  Hanner
slowly dismounted, stroked the sweaty flank of the subdued mule,
then turning and picking up an unbroken bottle of soda, proposed a
toast "to our gentle old family-buggy hoss!"
</p><p>The punchers cheered Hanner with the heartiness of men who can
appreciate the feat.
</p><p>"Hanner, you're all right.  I knowed you could do it."  Bill's
praise fell sweetly upon the Runt's ears.  "Where's that wooley I
made the bet with?  Hanner, we'll drink; yes, sir, we'll liquor up
now and have a good time.  I won the bet and you won the five for
ridin' the mule.  We'll drink, Hanner."  Seymour slapped Hanner's
shoulder in a cruelly hearty fashion.
</p><p>"No, Bill; let's not drink any more to-day," Hanner protested,
though he had not drunk anything.
</p><p>"Hanner, I don't understand you; blast me if I do."  Bill was
argumentative.  "Here you are, just rode the buckinest mule in the
Territory, and you won't take a drink with your best friend!  Now,
if anybody else 'u'd refuse to drink with Bill Seymour I think
they'd have trouble.  But you, Hanner, I reckon I'll just have to
pour it down you."  The drunken puncher tried to carry out his
plan, but changed his mind at Hanner's appeal.
</p><p>"Don't, Bill; fer God's sake, Bill, I'm too sick to drink!
Let's go home, Bill.  I'm shore sick.  Won't ye come on home with
me?"
</p><p>"I believe the darn little skunk is sick," muttered Bill to
himself.  Then aloud: "If you want to go home with me you'll have
to come along pretty quick.  I'm tired of this show, and, anyway,
I've got to get over to the round-up on Big Creek to-morrow.  Get
your horse and wait for me here; I'm goin' to see Smear before I go
home."
</p><p>Hanner knew that his companion went for another bottle of
whisky, but knew also the futility of protesting.
</p><p>They rode out of the tired, dirty, and heated crowd, where the
dance-platforms were beginning to fill up, and where the owner of
the two-headed calf, the five-legged mule, and the biggest steer in
the world, was beseeching everybody to come and view his
collection.  Bill rode at a gallop, with his companion spurring at
his heels, until they passed quite out of sight of the revelers.
Then he turned with an air of real concern to the Runt, and asked:
</p><p>"You shore 'nough sick, Hanner?  That mule shore put up a
stiff article."
</p><p>Hanner was not diplomatic, and spoke out truthfully: "Sick?
No, I ain't sick.  What 'u'd I want to see ye get drunk an' run in
for?  They'd 'a' run ye in to-night, Bill, I know.  Did ye ever
notice the color of the sky this time a day, Bill?  Seems to me it
ain't so darn purty as some people think."  The sun was setting in
a dull, coppery sky, the air was sultry, and the dust rose in thick
clouds.
</p><p>For a minute Bill did not reply, but looked at his companion
with a half-puzzled expression.  Then he broke out:
</p><p>"Well, you're a nice one, ain't you?  Do you know what I'm a
mind to do to you for this dirty trick?  You think I'm a darn kid
to sneak like this to keep from gettin' run in?  Oh, you baby!  For
a cent I'd make you walk all the way home, and lay this quirt over
your shoulders every step of the way."
</p><p>"Oh, no, Bill; ye wouldn't think o' doin' that.  D' ye want to
go back?  I didn't know ye cared to stay so bad."
</p><p>"Go back?  You think I'm crazy?  What 'u'd the punchers say?
No, curse you; you've robbed me of my fun.  That mule ought to 'a'
killed you!"
</p><p>Hanner had learned long before the value of silence, and rode
beside his morose companion with now and then an anxious glance at
him.  Bill was meditative, and quite forgot the rider at his side.
The pale light of a young moon deepened the shadows and illuminated
the heavy, sluggish dust-clouds that rose in the wake of the
riders.  Hungry calves, neglected at the ranches since early
morning by the celebrating ranchmen, bawled in useless appeal;
scurrying, skulking coyotes answered with their threatening cries
the challenge of the ranch-dogs.  A mile away, and coming toward
them with rhythmic hoof-beat and noisy rattle of hub
<pb n="331"/>
on
axle, the two riders heard a wagon and team.
</p><p>"Who do ye reckon kin be goin' into town this time o' night,
Bill?" asked Hanner.
</p><p>"Hold on here, Hanner; we'll stop."  Bill meditated a moment,
then went on: "You know what that team is?  It's the mail-stage
from Coffeyville to Vinita.  Darn old rattle-trap; it's a disgrace
to the country.  Ought to have a railroad through this God-forsaken
land.  That driver's a fool, and you know what I'm goin' to do?
Darn your skin, Hanner, you made me miss the fun at Vinita; now I'm
goin' to have some fun of my own.  We'll rob the stage!  Ever hear
about the road-agents, the James boys and the Younger gang?  Well,
they robbed overland stages and trains for swag; but we won't get
anything here, only some fun, and scare the fool driver.  Stage-robbers always jump out and grab the horses' heads and poke a gun
in the driver's face.  We'll tie our horses over there in the
gully, and hide in the grass here by the road.  You jump out and
get the horses, and I'll fix the driver.  See?  Come on; tie up
over here!"
</p><p>"Ye don't mean that, do ye, Bill?  Oh, come on and let's go
home."  Hanner detected a determined ring in the puncher's voice,
and he dared not protest more.
</p><p>"You don't have to get in on this unless you want to.  I can
do it myself."  Bill considered the plan a good joke, being drunk
enough to forget that robbing the mails is a very serious crime in
the eyes of the law, and the most serious in the eyes of citizen
posses, who sometimes take the law into their hands.  He galloped
down the rain-washed gully and tied his horse out of sight of
travelers on the road.  Hanner, expecting an end of the joke, rode
with him; but when Bill turned to go back to the road on foot, the
little puncher announced his intention of having nothing to do with
it.
</p><p>"Then give me that floppy old hat.  I got to wear some kind of
a mask.  Let me have that old red handkerchief round your neck,
too.  Now I look like a shore-'nough stage-robber &mdash; or like you, and
that's worse.  Well, ride out of the way if you ain't goin' to
help."  The amateur highwayman half stumbled, chuckling at the
prospect of fun, to a place in the long grass at the roadside.
</p><p>Hanner rode far down the dry wash, and waited in anxious
silence.  He heard the scarcely understood command of Bill Seymour
to the driver.  The rattling of the wagon suddenly ceased.  There
was a brief moment of absolute silence, and a pistol cracked.
Another shot from the same gun rang out.  In a short moment an
answering shot was heard.  Hanner could have sworn that it was the
bark of Bill's revolver.  An angry shout from Bill was followed by
a fusillade of shots.  The rattling of harness indicated a struggle
with the horses.  Then a yell from the driver started the stage-team at a gallop.  The firing ceased, and trembling with fright,
Hanner heard the noisy wagon pass on toward Vinita.
</p><p>Thoroughly sobered now, Bill ran to his horse, mounted, and
rode to meet his companion.  The two galloped on their way for five
minutes before Seymour trusted his voice to explain.  After
breaking into a string of furious oaths, he said:
</p><p>"What a fool I was!  Softy Sam wasn't drivin' the blanked
wagon at all.  When I got holt of the horses they shot at me.  I
yelled to 'em to stop, that I was only jokin', but the fools kept
on pluggin' away at me.  I got behind the horses and yelled again.
Then I had to shoot.  One of 'em fell back off the seat, and then
the other one whipped up the horses.  I let 'em go quick.  That
unshot fool plugged at me till he got out of sight.  No, I didn't
get hurt, but your hat got a hole in it all right."
</p><p>"Ye didn't kill one of 'em, did ye, Bill?  Ye don't think ye
did?  That wouldn't do, ye know, at all."
</p><p>"Kill one?  Hit one, all right; maybe killed him.  The fool!
Oh, that's just my luck.  Curse you, Hanner, it was your fault, you
cur, takin' me away from the fair-grounds with your old-granny tale
about bein' sick.  Say, what we goin' to do about it now, eh?  We
got to get out of this, or we'll get strung up, shore &mdash; I will, I
mean.  We'll ride for the Verdigris River timber and hide there.
Well, have you got anything better?"
</p><p>"Bill, couldn't we explain, tell the marshals it was a
mistake, and &mdash; "
</p><p>"Get strung up to a limb before we got through tellin' that,
you darn fool!  But it ain't a question of 'we'; I'm the only one
in this.  You kept out of it, you cowardly skunk, and you're safe.
You want to run away now, and keep your skin whole?"  Bill grew
incoherent, scarcely retaining sense enough to spur on toward his
destination.
</p><p>Meanwhile the stage had reached Vinita, with the wounded man
at the point of dying, and the driver too much confused to do
anything to help him.  Quite by chance, a considerable sum of money
had been sent through the mails that day, and the regular
<pb n="332"/>
driver had been replaced by two well-known deputy sheriffs.  After
the driver had finished telling of the attack made by a short man
wearing a big, floppy black hat, and with a dirty red handkerchief
tied over his lower face, a posse was immediately formed to hunt
the bandit down.  No one could guess who the guilty one might be.
</p><p>Dick Brewer, the leader of the party, questioned minutely:
"Would you know the hat if you saw it?"
</p><p>"Yes," the driver answered; "Tom Forbes put a hole through it
before he got shot.  I saw it nearly fall off his head &mdash; a great,
big, wide-brimmed, floppy thing, with what looked like a piece of
rope for a band."
</p><p>"Somethin' like the hat that Hanner the Runt wore to-day,
wasn't it, Smear?" the Convict commented.  Then he asked: "Where <hi rend="italic">
is</hi> Bill Seymour and Hanner, anyway?  You seen 'em last, didn't
you, Smear?"
</p><p>"They started home an hour ago.  Bill said he had to get over
to the Big Creek round-up to-morrow, an' he got a bottle of my
whisky before he went."  Smear remembered the unusual incident of
Bill's early departure; ordinarily, duty was not allowed to
interfere with the puncher's pleasure.
</p><p>To Smear, who made one of the pursuing party, the words "a
big, floppy black hat and a dirty red handkerchief" kept repeating
themselves in his mind.  At each repetition he recalled with
distinctness the appearance of the Runt as he had gone out to ride
the wild mule.  No other puncher in the country would wear that
hat, and none would feel quite respectable with that dirty red rag
about his neck at a Fourth of July celebration.
</p><p>"But, shucks!" Smear muttered to himself, "it can't be him.
But he's got nerve, the little devil, ridin' that mule the way he
did!  He ought to 'a' been with Bill Seymour, though; couldn't tear
the cuss away from him.  Well, we'll see."
</p><p>Hanner and Bill rode at a steady gallop until, in the middle
of the night, they plunged into the Verdigris River timber.  No
definite plan of action had been formed; they felt only a strong
desire to get away out of sight.  The horses must rest, and
overcome by fatigue, Bill dropped asleep.  The consciousness of a
crime done did not disturb him; in his mind it was an accident, the
unfortunate result of a joke.  Hanner did not sleep.  He stared up
through the tree-tops into the starlit sky, and pondered the
significance of the deed.  The course he had suggested to Bill,
that of confessing and explaining the matter, still seemed to be
the wisest one to him.  "Surely," he thought, "they would
understand, for they all know Bill's nature.  Didn't everybody know
that he must indulge in a joke whenever he could?"  A plan began to
form in his mind.
</p><p>"I kin sneak away before Bill wakes up, an' go explain to the
marshals.  They'll let Bill go, I know they will.  I kin do this
fer ye, Bill, an' ye'll be glad of it.  I don't want to have ye
scoutin' round the country; I want ye here, so we kin still ride
together.  I made ye come away from the fair, an' I got to git ye
out of the trouble I got ye into."  Hanner scarcely spoke his
thoughts.  He waited undecided for two or three hours.  The dawn
was just beginning to filter in to the hiding-place as he stole
forth quietly to his horse and rode to find the posse.
</p><p>More than one gang of outlaws had made the river-bottom their
headquarters and been captured there.  The pursuers of the lonely
mail-robber inferred that he was one of a number, and that he was
very likely to be heard of in the old haunts.  So early morning
found the posse scouring the country outside the timber, inquiring
of ranchmen and the women of the houses for a trace of the man they
sought.  It would do little good to try to rout him out of the
great forest of brush and swamp until some trace of his location
had been found.
</p><p>Dick Brewer and Smear were riding together near the road that
plunges through the thickest of the timber when Hanner rode out.
They stopped, attracted by his action.  The little puncher looked
anxiously about until he saw the waiting horsemen, then galloped
toward them.  Smear felt sick at heart on seeing the floppy hat and
the dirty red handkerchief that he wore.  Brewer saw them, too, and
his hand flew to his revolver.  He had not voiced his suspicions
before, but now Smear exclaimed with excitement:
</p><p>"If that there hat's got a hole in it, we've got the man!"
</p><p>"It's the Runt!"  Brewer had not heard the insinuations which
were made before the posse started.
</p><p>The appearance of the bullet-hole in the crown of the old hat
sufficed to make Brewer and Smear bring Hanner to a halt before
their pointed pistols.  At sight of their stern faces and
threatening weapons Hanner's power of speech was gone.  He tried to
say that he wanted to explain, and grew quite incoherent.

</p><p>"Never mind; explain when you get up before all of us," the
leader commanded.
</p><p>Half an hour of scurrying about by Smear and vigorous blowing
of signal-calls brought the party together.  Everything was
extremely orderly and businesslike.  A man who robbed mails and
killed drivers had no claim on their consideration; the only
question was, to be sure of the man.  When they were sure of him,
no matter what his former standing, he must be hanged straightway.
The effect of a lynching they felt to be good.  Dick Brewer called
upon the driver of the mail-wagon to step forth and declare
truthfully whether or not he recognized the prisoner.
</p><p>"Yes, sir; I can swear that that hat is the one the robber
wore, and allowing for the difference between daylight and
moonlight, I'd say that handkerchief was around the robber's face."
</p><p>"Is he of the same size and build?" asked the leader.
</p><p>"About the same; but I won't swear to anything but the hat.
I know that."
</p><p>It grew clear to the mind of the confused little puncher that
if he told the story which he had planned to tell, Bill Seymour
would be caught and hanged within the day.  No excuse that he had
perfected would stand for an instant against the plain fact that an
attempt to rob the mails had been made and a man murdered.  He saw,
too, just as plainly, that if he did not tell the truth concerning
Bill, he, as the owner of the hat, would suffer the penalty.  He
knew that very soon he would be asked to tell his story, to clear
up the evidence against him.  There was none of the great
excitement present that nerves men to self-sacrifice.  The day was
young yet, and the air was chilling.  The legs of the horses and
the boots of the men were dew-splashed and dripping.  It was not
pleasant to die now, even though life had been hard and mean to
him.  He felt a shudder of repulsion when he thought of the mode of
death.
</p><p>On the other side he considered what he owed to Bill.  Out of
a host of cow-boys he had known, Bill was the only one who had ever
recognized the fierce desire for comradeship that had consumed him,
the only one who had not passed him by in open ridicule.
</p><p>"Bill fought fer me when I was down," Hanner whispered to
himself.  "He knowed I was human.  An' I brought this on to him.
He come away yesterday because he thought I was sick.  He'd 'a' got
away, maybe, if I hadn't left him asleep to explain.  If he had to
go I wouldn't have nobody to ride with, an' if I take his place &mdash; if
I go he'll know an' &mdash; "  Hanner did not trust himself to go on, but
turned to the leader and said:
</p><p>"I reckon ye got the man all right."
</p><p>Under the misshapen body and the half-foolish features there
was a stoic in Hanner.  To save the life of his friend, the man
whom he worshiped and the other punchers respected, was the one
great service he could render.  He died there with a blind terror
in his heart at the blackness of the unknown, and with the thought
of Bill Seymour in his mind.  The men who hanged him felt no
exultation at having avenged a crime, but only a nameless pity for
the poor fellow.
</p><p>A day later Bill Seymour, while dodging about in the timber,
learned from a chance-met friend of Hanner's fate.  Looking this
friend full in the face, he said:
</p><p>"The poor little fool, to do a thing like that!"
