<head>P. J. PROUDHON: HIS LIFE AND HIS WORKS.</head> 
 
<p>The correspondence[1] of P. J. Proudhon, the first volumes of 
which we publish to-day, has been collected since his death by the 
faithful and intelligent labors of his daughter, aided by a few friends.  It 
was incomplete when submitted to Sainte Beuve, but the portion with 
which the illustrious academician became acquainted was sufficient to 
allow him to estimate it as a whole with that soundness of judgment 
which characterized him as a literary critic. 
</p> 
<p>In an important work, which his habitual readers certainly have not 
forgotten, although death did not allow him to finish it, Sainte Beuve 
thus judges the correspondence of the great publicist: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The letters of Proudhon, even outside the circle of his 
particular friends, will always be of value; we can always learn 
something from them, and here is the proper place to determine the 
general character of his correspondence. 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] In the French edition of Proudhon's works, the above sketch of 
his life is prefixed to the first volume of his correspondence, but the 
translator prefers to insert it here as the best method of introducing the 
author to the American public.  He would, however, caution readers 
against accepting the biographer's interpretation of the author's views as 
in any sense authoritative; advising them, rather, to await the publication 
of the remainder of Proudhon's writings, that they may form an opinion 
for themselves. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>. 
 
 
 
<pb n="xxii"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It has always been large, especially since he became so 
celebrated; and, to tell the truth, I am persuaded that, in the future, the 
correspondence of Proudhon will be his principal, vital work, and that 
most of his books will be only accessory to and corroborative of this.  At 
any rate, his books can be well understood only by the aid of his letters 
and the continual explanations which he makes to those who consult him 
in their doubt, and request him to define more clearly his position. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are, among celebrated people, many methods of 
correspondence.  There are those to whom letter-writing is a bore, and 
who, assailed with questions and compliments, reply in the greatest 
haste, solely that the job may be over with, and who return politeness for 
politeness, mingling it with more or less wit.  This kind of 
correspondence, though coming from celebrated people, is insignificant 
and unworthy of collection and classification. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;After those who write letters in performance of a 
disagreeable duty, and almost side by side with them in point of 
insignificance, I should put those who write in a manner wholly external, 
wholly superficial, devoted only to flattery, lavishing praise like gold, 
without counting it; and those also who weigh every word, who reply 
formally and pompously, with a view to fine phrases and effects.  They 
exchange words only, and choose them solely for their brilliancy and 
show.  You think it is you, individually, to whom they speak; but they 
are addressing themselves in your person to the four corners of Europe.  
Such letters are empty, and teach as nothing but theatrical execution and 
the favorite pose of their writers. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I will not class among the latter the more prudent and 
sagacious authors who, when writing to individuals, keep one eye on 
posterity.  We know that many who pursue this method have written 
long, finished, charming, flattering, and tolerably natural letters.  
Beranger furnishes us with the best example of this class. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Proudhon, however, is a man of entirely different nature 
and habits.  In writing, he thinks of nothing but his idea and the person 
whom he addresses: <hi rend="italic">ad rem et ad hominem</hi>.  A man of 
conviction and doctrine, to write does not weary him; to be questioned 
does not annoy him.  When approached, he cares only to know that your 
motive is not one of futile curiosity, but the love of truth; he assumes 
you to be serious, he replies, he examines your objections, sometimes 
verbally, sometimes in writing; for, as he remarks, `if there be some 
points which correspondence can never settle, but which can be made 
clear by conversation in two minutes, at other times just the opposite is 
the case: an objection clearly stated in writing, a doubt well expressed, 
which elicits a direct and positive reply, helps things along more than ten 
hours of oral inter 
<pb n="xxiii"/> course!'  In writing to you he does not hesitate to 
treat the subject anew; he unfolds to you the foundation and 
superstructure of his thought: rarely does he confess himself defeated &mdash; 
it is not his way; he holds to his position, but admits the breaks, the 
variations, in short, the <hi rend="italic">evolution</hi> of his mind.  The history 
of his mind is in his letters; there it must be sought. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Proudhon, whoever addresses him, is always ready; he 
quits the page of the book on which he is at work to answer you with the 
same pen, and that without losing patience, without getting confused, 
without sparing or complaining of his ink; he is a public man, devoted to 
the propagation of his idea by all methods, and the best method, with 
him, is always the present one, the latest one.  His very handwriting, 
bold, uniform, legible, even in the most tiresome passages, betrays no 
haste, no hurry to finish.  Each line is accurate: nothing is left to chance; 
the punctuation, very correct and a little emphatic and decided, indicates 
with precision and delicate distinction all the links in the chain of his 
argument.  He is devoted entirely to you, to his business and yours, 
while writing to you, and never to anything else.  All the letters of his 
which I have seen are serious: not one is commonplace. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But at the same time he is not at all artistic or affected; he 
does not <hi rend="italic">construct</hi> his letters, he does not revise them, he 
spends no time in reading them over; we have a first draught, excellent 
and clear, a jet from the fountain-head, but that is all.  The new 
arguments, which he discovers in support of his ideas and which 
opposition suggests to him, are an agreeable surprise, and shed a light 
which we should vainly search for even in his works.  His 
correspondence differs essentially from his books, in that it gives you no 
uneasiness; it places you in the very heart of the man, explains him to 
you, and leaves you with an impression of moral esteem and almost of 
intellectual security.  We feel his sincerity.  I know of no one to whom 
he can be more fitly compared in this respect than George Sand, whose 
correspondence is large, and at the same time full of sincerity.  His 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> and his nature correspond.  If he is writing to a 
young man who unbosoms himself to him in sceptical anxiety, to a 
young woman who asks him to decide delicate questions of conduct for 
her, his letter takes the form of a short moral essay, of a father-confessor's advice.  Has he perchance attended the theatre (a rare thing 
for him) to witness one of Ponsart's comedies, or a drama of Charles 
Edmond's, he feels bound to give an account of his impressions to the 
friend to whom he is indebted for this pleasure, and his letter becomes a 
literary and philosophical criticism, full of sense, and like no other.  His 
familiarity is suited to his correspondent; he affects no rudeness.  The 
terms of civ 
<pb n="xxiv"/> ility or affection which he employs towards his 
correspondents are sober, measured, appropriate to each, and honest in 
their simplicity and cordiality.  When he speaks of morals and the 
family, he seems at times like the patriarchs of the Bible.  His command 
of language is complete, and he never fails to avail himself of it.  Now 
and then a coarse word, a few personalities, too bitter and quite unjust or 
injurious, will have to be suppressed in printing; time, however, as it 
passes away, permits many things and renders them inoffensive.  Am I 
right in saying that Proudhon's correspondence, always substantial, will 
one day be the most accessible and attractive portion of his 
works?&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Almost the whole of Proudhon's real biography is included in his 
correspondence.  Up to 1837, the date of the first letter which we have 
been able to collect, his life, narrated by Sainte Beuve, from whom we 
make numerous extracts, may be summed up in a few pages. 
</p> 
<p>Pierre Joseph Proudhon was born on the 15th of January, 1809, in 
a suburb of Besan&ccedil;on, called Mouill&egrave;re.  His father and 
mother were employed in the great brewery belonging to M. Renaud.  
His father, though a cousin of the jurist Proudhon, the celebrated 
professor in the faculty of Dijon, was a journeyman brewer.  His 
mother, a genuine peasant, was a common servant.  She was an orderly 
person of great good sense; and, as they who knew her say, a superior 
woman of <hi rend="italic">heroic</hi> character, &mdash; to use the expression of the 
venerable M. Weiss, the librarian at Besan&ccedil;on.  She it was 
especially that Proudhon resembled: she and his grandfather 
Tourn&eacute;si, the soldier peasant of whom his mother told him, and 
whose courageous deeds he has described in his work on 
&ldquo;Justice.&rdquo;  Proudhon, who always felt a great veneration 
for his mother Catharine, gave her name to the elder of his daughters.  
In 1814, when Besan&ccedil;on was blockaded, Mouill&egrave;re, 
which stood in front of the walls of the town, was destroyed in the 
 
<pb n="xxv"/> defence of the place; and Proudhon's father established 
a cooper's shop in a suburb of Battant, called Vignerons.  Very honest, 
but simple-minded and short-sighted, this cooper, the father of five 
children, of whom Pierre Joseph was the eldest, passed his life in 
poverty.  At eight years of age, Proudhon either made himself useful in 
the house, or tended the cattle out of doors.  No one should fail to read 
that beautiful and precious page of his work on &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; 
in which he describes the rural sports which he enjoyed when a neatherd.  
At the age of twelve, he was a cellar-boy in an inn.  This, however, did 
not prevent him from studying.  His mother was greatly aided by M. 
Renaud, the former owner of the brewery, who had at that time retired 
from business, and was engaged in the education of his children. 
</p> 
<p>Proudhon entered school as a day-scholar in the sixth class.  He 
was necessarily irregular in his attendance; domestic cares and restraints 
sometimes kept him from his classes.  He succeeded nevertheless in his 
studies; he showed great perseverance.  His family were so poor that 
they could not afford to furnish him with books; he was obliged to 
borrow them from his comrades, and copy the text of his lessons.  He 
has himself told us that he was obliged to leave his wooden shoes outside 
the door, that he might not disturb the classes with his noise; and that, 
having no hat, he went to school bareheaded.  One day, towards the 
close of his studies, on returning from the distribution of the prizes, 
loaded with crowns, he found nothing to eat in the house. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In his eagerness for labor and his thirst for knowledge, 
Proudhon,&rdquo; says Sainte Beuve, &ldquo;was not content with the 
instruction of his teachers.  From his twelfth to his fourteenth year, he 
was a constant frequenter of  
<pb n="xxvi"/> the town library.  One curiosity led to another, and he 
called for book after book, sometimes eight or ten at one sitting.  The 
learned librarian, the friend and almost the brother of Charles Nodier, 
M. Weiss, approached him one day, and said, smiling, `But, my little 
friend, what do you wish to do with all these books?'  The child raised 
his head, eyed his questioner, and replied:  `What's that to you?'  And 
the good M. Weiss remembers it to this day.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Forced to earn his living, Proudhon could not continue his studies.  
He entered a printing-office in Besan&ccedil;on as a proof-reader.  
Becoming, soon after, a compositor, he made a tour of France in this 
capacity.  At Toulon, where he found himself without money and 
without work, he had a scene with the mayor, which he describes in his 
work on &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Sainte Beuve says that, after his tour of France, his service book 
being filled with good certificates, Proudhon was promoted to the 
position of foreman.  But he does not tell us, for the reason that he had 
no knowledge of a letter written by Fallot, of which we never heard until 
six months since, that the printer at that time contemplated quitting his 
trade in order to become a teacher. 
</p> 
<p>Towards 1829, Fallot, who was a little older than Proudhon, and 
who, after having obtained the Suard pension in 1832, died in his 
twenty-ninth year, while filling the position of assistant librarian at the 
Institute, was charged, Protestant though he was, with the revisal of a 
&ldquo;Life of the Saints,&rdquo; which was published at 
Besan&ccedil;on.  The book was in Latin, and Fallot added some notes 
which also were in Latin. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Sainte Beuve, &ldquo;it happened that 
some errors escaped his attention, which Proudhon, then proof-reader in 
the printing office, did not fail to point out to him.  Surprised at finding 
so good a Latin scholar in a workshop, he desired to make his 
acquaintance; and soon there sprung up between them a most earnest and 
intimate friendship: a friendship of the intellect and of the heart.&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="xxvii"/>  
</p> 
<p>Addressed to a printer between twenty-two and twenty-three years 
of age, and predicting in formal terms his future fame, Fallot's letter 
seems to us so interesting that we do not hesitate to reproduce it entire. 
</p>

<div1 type="letter" id="d6"> 
<head>&ldquo;PARIS, December 5, 1831.</head> 
 
<p>&ldquo;MY DEAR PROUDHON, &mdash; YOU have a right to be 
surprised at, and even dissatisfied with, my long delay in replying to 
your kind letter; I will tell you the cause of it.  It became necessary to 
forward an account of your ideas to M. J. de Gray; to hear his 
objections, to reply to them, and to await his definitive response, which 
reached me but a short time ago; for M. J. is a sort of financial king, 
who takes no pains to be punctual in dealing with poor devils like 
ourselves.  I, too, am careless in matters of business; I sometimes push 
my negligence even to disorder, and the metaphysical musings which 
continually occupy my mind, added to the amusements of Paris, render 
me the most incapable man in the world for conducting a negotiation 
with despatch. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I have M. Jobard's decision; here it is:  In his judgment, 
you are too learned and clever for his children; he fears that you could 
not accommodate your mind and character to the childish notions 
common to their age and station.  In short.  he is what the world calls a 
good father; that is, he wants to spoil his children, and, in order to do 
this easily, he thinks fit to retain his present instructor, who is not very 
learned, but who takes part in their games and joyous sports with 
wonderful facility, who points out the letters of the alphabet to the little 
girl, who takes the little boys to mass, and who, no less obliging than 
the worthy Abb&eacute; P. of our acquaintance, would readily dance for 
Madame's amusement.  Such a profession would not suit you, you who 
have a free, proud, and manly soul: you are refused; let us dismiss the 
matter from our minds.  Perhaps another time my solicitude will be less 
unfortunate.  I can only ask your pardon for having thought of thus 
disposing of you almost without consulting you.  I find my excuse in the 
motives which guided me; I had in view your well-being and 
advancement in the ways of this world. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I see in your letter, my comrade, through its brilliant 
witticisms and beneath the frank and artless gayety with which you have 
sprinkled it, a tinge of sadness and despondency which pains me.  You 
are unhappy, my friend: your present situation does not suit you; you 
cannot remain in it, it was not made for you, it is beneath you; you 
ought, by all means, to leave it, before its injurious influence begins to 
affect your faculties, and before you become settled, as they say, in the 
ways of your profes 
<pb n="xxviii"/> sion, were it possible that such a thing could ever 
happen, which I flatly deny.  You are unhappy; you have not yet entered 
upon the path which Nature has marked out for you.  But, faint-hearted 
soul, is that a cause for despondency?  Ought you to feel discouraged?  
Struggle, <hi rend="italic">morbleu</hi>, struggle persistently, and you will 
triumph.  J. J. Rousseau groped about for forty years before his genius 
was revealed to him.  You are not J. J Rousseau; but listen: I know not 
whether I should have divined the author of &ldquo;Emile&rdquo; when 
he was twenty years of age, supposing that I had been his contemporary, 
and had enjoyed the honor of his acquaintance.  But I have known you, I 
have loved you, I have divined your future, if I may venture to say so; 
for the first time in my life, I am going to risk a prophecy.  Keep this 
letter, read it again fifteen or twenty years hence, perhaps twenty-five, 
and if at that time the prediction which I am about to make has not been 
fulfilled, burn it as a piece of folly out of charity and respect for my 
memory.  This is my prediction: you will be, Proudhon, in spite of 
yourself, inevitably, by the fact of your destiny, a writer, an author; you 
will be a philosopher; you will be one of the lights of the century, and 
your name will occupy a place in the annals of the nineteenth century, 
like those of Gassendi, Descartes, Malebranche, and Bacon in the 
seventeenth, and those of Diderot, Montesquieu, Helvetius.  Locke, 
Hume, and Holbach in the eighteenth.  Such will be your lot!  Do now 
what you will, set type in a printing-office, bring up children, bury 
yourself in deep seclusion, seek obscure and lonely villages, it is all one 
to me; you cannot escape your destiny; you cannot divest yourself of 
your noblest feature, that active, strong, and inquiring mind, with which 
you are endowed; your place in the world has been appointed, and it 
cannot remain empty.  Go where you please, I expect you in Paris, 
talking philosophy and the doctrines of Plato; you will have to come, 
whether you want to or not.  I, who say this to you, must feel very sure 
of it in order to be willing to put it upon paper, since, without reward 
for my prophetic skill, &mdash; to which, I assure you, I make not the slightest 
claim, &mdash; I run the risk of passing for a hare-brained fellow, in case I 
prove to be mistaken: he plays a bold game who risks his good sense 
upon his cards, in return for the very trifling and insignificant merit of 
having divined a young man's future. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When I say that I expect you in Paris, I use only a 
proverbial phrase which you must not allow to mislead you as to my 
projects and plans.  To reside in Paris is disagreeable to me, very much 
so; and when this fine-art fever which possesses me has left me, I shall 
abandon the place without regret to seek a more peaceful residence in a 
provincial town, provided always the town shall afford me the means of 
living, bread, a  
<pb n="xxix"/> bed, books, rest, and solitude.  How I miss, my good 
Proudhon, that dark, obscure, smoky chamber in which I dwelt in 
Besan&ccedil;on, and where we spent so many pleasant hours in the 
discussion of philosophy!  Do you remember it?  But that is now far 
away.  Will that happy time ever return?  Shall we one day meet again?  
Here my life is restless, uncertain, precarious, and, what is worse, 
indolent, illiterate, and vagrant.  I do no work, I live in idleness, I 
ramble about; I do not read, I no longer study; my books are forsaken; 
now and then I glance over a few metaphysical works, and after a days 
walk through dirty, filthy, crowded streets.  I lie down with empty head 
and tired body, to repeat the performance on the following day.  What is 
the object of these walks, you will ask.  I make visits, my friend; I hold 
interviews with stupid people.  Then a fit of curiosity seizes me, the 
least inquisitive of beings: there are museums, libraries, assemblies, 
churches, palaces, gardens, and theatres to visit.  I am fond of pictures, 
fond of music, fond of sculpture; all these are beautiful and good, but 
they cannot appease hunger, nor take the place of my pleasant readings 
of Bailly, Hume, and Tennemann, which I used to enjoy by my fireside 
when I was able to read. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But enough of complaints.  Do not allow this letter to 
affect you too much, and do not think that I give way to dejection or 
despondency; no, I am a fatalist, and I believe in my star.  I do not 
know yet what my calling is, nor for what branch of polite literature I 
am best fitted; I do not even know whether I am, or ever shall be, fitted 
for any: but what matters it?  I suffer, I labor, I dream, I enjoy, I think; 
and, in a word, when my last hour strikes, I shall have lived. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Proudhon, I love you, I esteem you; and, believe me, 
these are not mere phrases.  What interest could I have in flattering and 
praising a poor printer?  Are you rich, that you may pay for courtiers?  
Have you a sumptuous table, a dashing wife, and gold to scatter, in 
order to attract them to your suite?  Have you the glory, honors, credit, 
which would render your acquaintance pleasing to their vanity and pride?  
No; you are poor, obscure, abandoned; but, poor, obscure, and 
abandoned, you have a friend, and a friend who knows all the 
obligations which that word imposes upon honorable people, when they 
venture to assume it.  That friend is myself: put me to the test. 
</p> 
<p>                                &ldquo;GUSTAVE 
FALLOT.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>It appears from this letter that if, at this period, Proudhon had 
already exhibited to the eyes of a clairvoyant friend his genius for 
research and investigation, it was in the direction  
<pb n="xxx"/> of philosophical, rather than of economical and social, 
questions. 
</p> 
<p>Having become foreman in the house of Gauthier &amp; Co., who 
carried on a large printing establishment at Besan&ccedil;on, he 
corrected the proofs of ecclesiastical writers, the Fathers of the Church.  
As they were printing a Bible, a Vulgate, he was led to compare the 
Latin with the original Hebrew. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In this way,&rdquo; says Sainte Beuve, &ldquo;he 
learned Hebrew by himself, and, as everything was connected in his 
mind, he was led to the study of comparative philology.  As the house of 
Gauthier published many works on Church history and theology, he 
came also to acquire, through this desire of his to investigate everything, 
an extensive knowledge of theology, which afterwards caused 
misinformed persons to think that he had been in an ecclesiastical 
seminary.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Towards 1836, Proudhon left the house of Gauthier, and, in 
company with an associate, established a small printing-office in 
Besan&ccedil;on.  His contribution to the partnership consisted, not so 
much in capital, as in his knowledge of the trade.  His partner 
committing suicide in 1838, Proudhon was obliged to wind up the 
business, an operation which he did not accomplish as quickly and as 
easily as he hoped.  He was then urged by his friends to enter the ranks 
of the competitors for the Suard pension.  This pension consisted of an 
income of fifteen hundred francs bequeathed to the Academy of 
Besan&ccedil;on by Madame Suard, the widow of the academician, to be 
given once in three years to the young man residing in the department of 
Doubs, a bachelor of letters or of science, and not possessing a fortune, 
whom the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on <hi rend="italic">should deem best fitted 
for a literary or scientific career, or for the study of law or of 
medicine</hi>.  The first to win the Suard pension was Gustave Fallot.  
Mauvais, who  
<pb n="xxxi"/> was a distinguished astronomer in the Academy of 
Sciences, was the second.  Proudhon aspired to be the third.  To qualify 
himself, he had to be received as a bachelor of letters, and was obliged 
to write a letter to the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on.  In a phrase of this 
letter, the terms of which he had to modify, though he absolutely refused 
to change its spirit, Proudhon expressed his firm resolve to labor for the 
amelioration of the condition of his brothers, the working-men. 
</p> 
<p>The only thing which he had then published was an &ldquo;Essay 
on General Grammar,&rdquo; which appeared without the author's 
signature.  While reprinting, at Besan&ccedil;on, the &ldquo;Primitive 
Elements of Languages, Discovered by the Comparison of Hebrew roots 
with those of the Latin and French,&rdquo; by the Abb&eacute; 
Bergier, Proudhon had enlarged the edition of his &ldquo;Essay on 
General Grammar.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The date of the edition, 1837, proves that he did not at that time 
think of competing for the Suard pension.  In this work, which continued 
and completed that of the Abb&eacute; Bergier, Proudhon adopted the 
same point of view, that of Moses and of Biblical tradition.  Two years 
later, in February, 1839, being already in possession of the Suard 
pension, he addressed to the Institute, as a competitor for the Volney 
prize, a memoir entitled:  &ldquo;Studies in Grammatical Classification 
and the Derivation of some French words.&rdquo;  It was his first 
work, revised and presented in another form.  Four memoirs only were 
sent to the Institute, none of which gained the prize.  Two honorable 
mentions were granted, one of them to memoir No. 4; that is, to P. J. 
Proudhon, printer at Besan&ccedil;on.  The judges were MM. 
Am&eacute;dd&eacute; Jaubert, Reinaud, and Burnouf. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The committee,&rdquo; said the report presented at the 
annual meeting of the five academies on Thursday, May 2, 1839, 
&ldquo;has paid especial atten 
<pb n="xxxii"/> tion to manuscripts No. 1 and No. 4.  Still, it does 
not feel able to grant the prize to either of these works, because they do 
not appear to be sufficiently elaborated.  The committee, which finds in 
No. 4 some ingenious analyses, particularly in regard to the mechanism 
of the Hebrew language, regrets that the author has resorted to hazardous 
conjectures, and has sometimes forgotten the special recommendation of 
the committee to pursue the experimental and comparative 
method.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Proudhon remembered this.  He attended the lectures of 
Eug&egrave;ne Burnouf, and, as soon as he became acquainted with the 
labors and discoveries of Bopp and his successors, he definitively 
abandoned an hypothesis which had been condemned by the Academy of 
Inscriptions and Belles-lettres.  He then sold, for the value of the paper, 
the remaining copies of the &ldquo;Essay&rdquo; published by him in 
1837.  In 1850, they were still lying in a grocer's back-shop.  A 
neighboring publisher then placed the edition on the market, with the 
attractive name of Proudhon upon it.  A lawsuit ensued, in which the 
author was beaten.  His enemies, and at that time there were many of 
them, would have been glad to have proved him a renegade and a 
recanter.  Proudhon, in his work on &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; gives some 
interesting details of this lawsuit. 
</p> 
<p>In possession of the Suard pension, Proudhon took part in the 
contest proposed by the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on on the question of 
the utility of the celebration of Sunday.  His memoir obtained honorable 
mention, together with a medal which was awarded him, in open session, 
on the 24th of August, 1839.  The reporter of the committee, the 
Abb&eacute; Doney, since made Bishop of Montauban, called attention 
to the unquestionable superiority of his talent. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Sainte Beuve, &ldquo;he reproached 
him with having adopted dangerous theories, and with having touched 
upon questions of practical politics and social organization, where 
upright intentions and zeal for the public welfare cannot justify rash 
solutions.&rdquo; 
 
 
<pb n="xxxiii"/>  
</p> 
<p>Was it policy, we mean prudence, which induced Proudhon to 
screen his ideas of equality behind the Mosaic law?  Sainte Beuve, like 
many others, seems to think so.  But we remember perfectly well that, 
having asked Proudhon, in August, 1848, if he did not consider himself 
indebted in some respects to his fellow-countryman, Charles Fourier, we 
received from him the following reply:  &ldquo;I have certainly read 
Fourier, and have spoken of him more than once in my works; but, upon 
the whole, I do not think that I owe anything to him.  My real masters, 
those who have caused fertile ideas to spring up in my mind, are three in 
number: first, the Bible; next, Adam Smith; and last, Hegel. 
</p> 
<p>Freely confessed in the &ldquo;Celebration of Sunday,&rdquo; 
the influence of the Bible on Proudhon is no less manifest in his first 
memoir on property.  Proudhon undoubtedly brought to this work many 
ideas of his own; but is not the very foundation of ancient Jewish law to 
be found in its condemnation of usurious interest and its denial of the 
right of personal appropriation of land? 
</p> 
<p>The first memoir on property appeared in 1840, under the title, 
&ldquo;What is Property? or an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and 
of Government.&rdquo;  Proudhon dedicated it, in a letter which served 
as the preface, to the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on.  The latter, finding 
itself brought to trial by its pensioner, took the affair to heart, and 
evoked it, says Sainte Beuve, with all possible haste.  The pension 
narrowly escaped being immediately withdrawn from the bold defender 
of the principle of equality of conditions.  M. Vivien, then Minister of 
Justice, who was earnestly solicited to prosecute the author, wished first 
to obtain the opinion of the economist, Blanqui,  
<pb n="xxxiv"/> a member of the Academy of Moral and Political 
Sciences.  Proudhon having presented to this academy a copy of his 
book, M. Blanqui was appointed to review it.  This review, though it 
opposed Proudhon's views, shielded him.  Treated as a 
<hi rend="italic">savant</hi> by M. Blanqui, the author was not prosecuted.  He 
was always grateful to MM. Blanqui and Vivien for their handsome 
conduct in the matter. 
</p> 
<p>M. Blanqui's review, which was partially reproduced by 
&ldquo;Le Moniteur,&rdquo; on the 7th of September, 1840, naturally 
led Proudhon to address to him, in the form of a letter, his second 
memoir on property, which appeared in April, 1841.  Proudhon had 
endeavored, in his first memoir, to demonstrate that the pursuit of 
equality of conditions is the true principle of right and of government.  
In the &ldquo;Letter to M. Blanqui,&rdquo; he passes in review the 
numerous and varied methods by which this principle gradually becomes 
realized in all societies, especially in modern society. 
</p> 
<p>In 1842, a third memoir appeared, entitled, &ldquo;A Notice to 
Proprietors, or a Letter to M. Victor Consid&eacute;rant, Editor of `La 
Phalange,' in Reply to a Defence of Property.&rdquo;  Here the 
influence of Adam Smith manifested itself, and was frankly admitted.  
Did not Adam Smith find, in the principle of equality, the first of all the 
laws which govern wages?  There are other laws, undoubtedly; but 
Proudhon considers them all as springing from the principle of property, 
as he defined it in his first memoir.  Thus, in humanity, there are two 
principles, &mdash; one which leads us to equality, another which separates us 
from it.  By the former, we treat each other as associates; by the latter, 
as strangers, not to say enemies.  This distinction, which is constantly 
met with throughout the  
<pb n="xxxv"/> three memoirs, contained already, in germ, the idea 
which gave birth to the &ldquo;System of Economical 
Contradictions,&rdquo; which appeared in 1846, the idea of antinomy or 
<hi rend="italic">contre-loi</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The &ldquo;Notice to Proprietors&rdquo; was seized by the 
magistrates of Besan&ccedil;on; and Proudhon was summoned to appear 
before the assizes of Doubs within a week.  He read his written defence 
to the jurors in person, and was acquitted.  The jury, like M. Blanqui, 
viewed him only as a philosopher, an inquirer, a <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>In 1843, Proudhon published the &ldquo;Creation of Order in 
Humanity,&rdquo; a large volume, which does not deal exclusively with 
questions of social economy.  Religion, philosophy, method, certainty, 
logic, and dialectics are treated at considerable length. 
</p> 
<p>Released from his printing-office on the 1st of March of the same 
year, Proudhon had to look for a chance to earn his living.  Messrs. 
Gauthier Bros., carriers by water between Mulhouse and Lyons, the 
eldest of whom was Proudhon's companion in childhood, conceived the 
happy thought of employing him, of utilizing his ability in their business, 
and in settling the numerous points of difficulty which daily arose.  
Besides the large number of accounts which his new duties required him 
to make out, and which retarded the publication of the &ldquo;System 
of Economical Contradictions,&rdquo; until October, 1846, we ought to 
mention a work, which, before it appeared in pamphlet form, was 
published in the &ldquo;Revue des Economistes,&rdquo; &mdash; 
&ldquo;Competition between Railroads and Navigable Ways.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Le Miserere, or the Repentance of a King,&rdquo; which 
he published in March, 1845, in the &ldquo;Revue 
Ind&eacute;pendante,&rdquo; during  
<pb n="xxxvi"/> that Lenten season when Lacordaire was preaching 
in Lyons, proves that, though devoting himself with ardor to the study of 
economical problems, Proudhon had not lost his interest in questions of 
religious history.  Among his writings on these questions, which he was 
unfortunately obliged to leave unfinished, we may mention a nearly 
completed history of the early Christian heresies, and of the struggle of 
Christianity against C&aelig;sarism. 
</p> 
<p>We have said that, in 1848, Proudhon recognized three masters.  
Having no knowledge of the German language, he could not have read 
the works of Hegel, which at that time had not been translated into 
French.  It was Charles Gr&uuml;n, a German, who had come to France 
to study the various philosophical and socialistic systems, who gave him 
the substance of the Hegelian ideas.  During the winter of 1844-45, 
Charles Gr&uuml;n had some long conversations with Proudhon, which 
determined, very decisively, not the ideas, which belonged exclusively to 
the <hi rend="italic">bisontin</hi> thinker, but the form of the important work on 
which he labored after 1843, and which was published in 1846 by 
Guillaumin. 
</p> 
<p>Hegel's great idea, which Proudhon appropriated, and which he 
demonstrates with wonderful ability in the &ldquo;System of 
Economical Contradictions,&rdquo; is as follows:  Antinomy, that is, 
the existence of two laws or tendencies which are opposed to each other, 
is possible, not only with two different things, but with one and the same 
thing.  Considered in their thesis, that is, in the law or tendency which 
created them, all the economical categories are rational, &mdash; competition, 
monopoly, the balance of trade, and property, as well as the division of 
labor, machinery, taxation, and credit.  But, like communism  
<pb n="xxxvii"/> and population, all these categories are antinomical; 
all are opposed, not only to each other, but to themselves.  All is 
opposition, and disorder is born of this system of opposition.  Hence, the 
sub-title of the work, &mdash; &ldquo;Philosophy of Misery.&rdquo;  No 
category can be suppressed; the opposition, antinomy, or <hi rend="italic">contre-tendance</hi>, which exists in each of them, cannot be suppressed. 
</p> 
<p>Where, then, lies the solution of the social problem?  Influenced 
by the Hegelian ideas, Proudhon began to look for it in a superior 
synthesis, which should reconcile the thesis and antithesis.  Afterwards, 
while at work upon his book on &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; he saw that the 
antinomical terms do not cancel each other, any more than the opposite 
poles of an electric pile destroy each other; that they are the procreative 
cause of motion, life, and progress; that the problem is to discover, not 
their fusion, which would be death, but their equilibrium, &mdash; an 
equilibrium for ever unstable, varying with the development of society. 
</p> 
<p>On the cover of the &ldquo;System of Economical 
Contradictions,&rdquo; Proudhon announced, as soon to appear, his 
&ldquo;Solution of the Social Problem.&rdquo;  This work, upon which 
he was engaged when the Revolution of 1848 broke out, had to be cut up 
into pamphlets and newspaper articles.  The two pamphlets, which he 
published in March, 1848, before he became editor of &ldquo;Le 
Repr&eacute;sentant du Peuple,&rdquo; bear the same title, &mdash; 
&ldquo;Solution of the Social Problem.&rdquo;  The first, which is 
mainly a criticism of the early acts of the provisional government, is 
notable from the fact that in it Proudhon, in advance of all others, 
energetically opposed the establishment of national workshops.  The 
second, &ldquo;Organization of Credit and Circulation,&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="xxxviii"/> sums up in a few pages his idea of economical 
progress: a gradual reduction of interest, profit, rent, taxes, and wages.  
All progress hitherto has been made in this manner; in this manner it 
must continue to be made.  Those workingmen who favor a nominal 
increase of wages are, unconsciously.  following a back-track, opposed 
to all their interests. 
</p> 
<p>After having published in &ldquo;Le Repr&eacute;sentant du 
Peuple,&rdquo; the statutes of the Bank of Exchange, &mdash; a bank which 
was to make no profits, since it was to have no stockholders, and which, 
consequently, was to discount commercial paper with out interest, 
charging only a commission sufficient to defray its running expenses, &mdash; 
Proudhon endeavored, in a number of articles, to explain its mechanism 
and necessity.  These articles have been collected in one volume, under 
the double title, &ldquo;R&eacute;sum&eacute; of the Social Question; 
Bank of Exchange.&rdquo;  His other articles, those which up to 
December, 1848, were inspired by the progress of events, have been 
collected in another volume, &mdash; &ldquo;Revolutionary Ideas.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Almost unknown in March, 1848, and struck off in April from the 
list of candidates for the Constituent Assembly by the delegation of 
workingmen which sat at the Luxembourg, Proudhon had but a very 
small number of votes at the general elections of April.  At the 
complementary elections, which were held in the early days of June, he 
was elected in Paris by seventy-seven thousand votes. 
</p> 
<p>After the fatal days of June, he published an article on <hi rend="italic">le 
terme</hi>, which caused the first suspension of &ldquo;Le 
Repr&eacute;sentant du Peuple.&rdquo;  It was at that time that he 
introduced a bill into the Assembly, which, being referred to the 
Committee on the Finances, drew forth, first, the report of M. Thiers, 
and then  
<pb n="xxxix"/> the speech which Proudhon delivered, on the 31st of 
July, in reply to this report.  &ldquo;Le Repr&eacute;sentant du 
Peuple,&rdquo; reappearing a few days later, he wrote, <hi rend="italic">&agrave; 
propos</hi> of the law requiring journals to give bonds, his famous 
article on &ldquo;The Malthusians&rdquo; (August 10, 1848).  Ten 
days afterwards, &ldquo;Le Repr&eacute;sentant du Peuple,&rdquo; 
again suspended, definitively ceased to appear.  &ldquo;Le 
Peuple,&rdquo; of which he was the editor-in-chief, and the first number 
of which was issued in the early part of September, appeared weekly at 
first, for want of sufficient bonds; it afterwards appeared daily, with a 
double number once a week.  Before &ldquo;Le Peuple&rdquo; had 
obtained its first bond, Proudhon published a remarkable pamphlet on the 
&ldquo;Right to Labor,&rdquo; &mdash; a right which he denied in the form 
in which it was then affirmed.  It was during the same period that he 
proposed, at the Poissonniere banquet, his <hi rend="italic">Toast to the 
Revolution</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Proudhon, who had been asked to preside at the banquet, refused, 
and proposed in his stead, first, Ledru-Rollin, and then, in view of the 
reluctance of the organizers of the banquet, the illustrious president of 
the party of the Mountain, Lamennais.  It was evidently his intention to 
induce the representatives of the Extreme Left to proclaim at last with 
him the Democratic and Social Republic.  Lamennais being accepted by 
the organizers, the Mountain promised to be present at the banquet.  The 
night before, all seemed right, when General Cavaignac replaced 
Minister S&eacute;nart by Minister Dufaure-Vivien.  The Mountain, 
questioning the government, proposed a vote of confidence in the old 
minister, and, tacitly, of want of confidence in the new.  Proudhon ab-stained from voting on this proposition.  The Mountain declared that it 
would not attend the banquet, if Proud 
<pb n="xl"/> hon was to be present.  Five Montagnards, Mathieu of 
Dr&ocirc;me at their head, went to the temporary office of &ldquo;Le 
Peuple&rdquo; to notify him of this.  &ldquo;Citizen 
Proudhon,&rdquo; said they to the organizers in his presence, 
&ldquo;in abstaining from voting to-day on the proposition of the 
Mountain, has betrayed the Republican cause.&rdquo;  Proudhon, 
vehemently questioned, began his defence by recalling, on the one hand, 
the treatment which he had received from the dismissed minister; and, 
on the other, the impartial conduct displayed towards him in 1840 by M. 
Vivien, the new minister.  He then attacked the Mountain by telling its 
delegates that it sought only a pretext, and that really, in spite of its 
professions of Socialism in private conversation, whether with him or 
with the organizers of the banquet, it had not the courage to publicly 
declare itself Socialist. 
</p> 
<p>On the following day, in his <hi rend="italic">Toast to the Revolution</hi>, 
a toast which was filled with allusions to the exciting scene of the night 
before, Proudhon commenced his struggle against the Mountain.  His 
duel with F&eacute;lix Pyat was one of the episodes of this struggle, 
which became less bitter on Proudhon's side after the Mountain finally 
decided to publicly proclaim the Democratic and Social Republic.  The 
campaign for the election of a President of the Republic had just begun.  
Proudhon made a very sharp attack on the candidacy of Louis Bonaparte 
in a pamphlet which is regarded as one of his literary <hi rend="italic">chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</hi>: the &ldquo;Pamphlet on the Presidency.&rdquo;  
An opponent of this institution, against which he had voted in the 
Constituent Assembly, he at first decided to take no part in the 
campaign.  But soon seeing that he was thus increasing the chances of 
Louis Bonaparte, and that if, as was not  
<pb n="xli"/> at all probable, the latter should not obtain an absolute 
majority of the votes, the Assembly would not fail to elect General 
Cavaignac, he espoused, for the sake of form, the candidacy of Raspail, 
who was supported by his friends in the Socialist Committee.  Charles 
Delescluze, the editor-in-chief of &ldquo;La R&eacute;volution 
D&eacute;mocratique et Sociale,&rdquo; who could not forgive him for 
having preferred Raspail to Ledru-Rollin, the candidate of the Mountain, 
attacked him on the day after the election with a violence which 
overstepped all bounds.  At first, Proudhon had the wisdom to refrain 
from answering him.  At length, driven to an extremity, he became 
aggressive himself, and Delescluze sent him his seconds.  This time, 
Proudhon positively refused to fight; he would not have fought with 
F&eacute;lix Pyat, had not his courage been called in question. 
</p> 
<p>On the 25th of January, 1849, Proudhon, rising from a sick bed, 
saw that the existence of the Constituent Assembly was endangered by 
the coalition of the monarchical parties with Louis Bonaparte, who was 
already planning his <hi rend="italic">coup d'Etat</hi>.  He did not hesitate to 
openly attack the man who had just received five millions of votes.  He 
wanted to break the idol; he succeeded only in getting prosecuted and 
condemned himself.  The prosecution demanded against him was 
authorized by a majority of the Constituent Assembly, in spite of the 
speech which he delivered on that occasion.  Declared guilty by the jury, 
he was sentenced, in March, 1849, to three years' imprisonment and the 
payment of a fine of ten thousand francs. 
</p> 
<p>Proudhon had not abandoned for a single moment his project of a 
Bank of Exchange, which was to operate without capital with a sufficient 
number of merchants and manu 
<pb n="xlii"/> facturers for adherents.  This bank, which he then 
called the <hi rend="italic">Bank of the People</hi>, and around which he wished 
to gather the numerous working-people's associations which had been 
formed since the 24th of February, 1848, had already obtained a certain 
number of subscribers and adherents, the latter to the number of thirty-seven thousand.  It was about to commence operations, when Proudhon's 
sentence forced him to choose between imprisonment and exile.  He did 
not hesitate to abandon his project and return the money to the 
subscribers.  He explained the motives which led him to this decision in 
an article in &ldquo;Le Peuple.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Having fled to Belgium, he remained there but a few days, going 
thence to Paris, under an assumed name, to conceal himself in a house in 
the Rue de Chabrol.  From his hiding-place he sent articles almost every 
day, signed and unsigned, to &ldquo;Le Peuple.&rdquo;  In the 
evening, dressed in a blouse, he went to some secluded spot to take the 
air.  Soon, emboldened by habit, he risked an evening promenade upon 
the Boulevards, and afterwards carried his imprudence so far as to take a 
stroll by daylight in the neighborhood of the Gare du Nord.  It was not 
long before he was recognized by the police, who arrested him on the 
6th of June, 1849, in the Rue du Faubourg-Poissonniere. 
</p> 
<p>Taken to the office of the prefect of police, then to Sainte&mdash; 
P&eacute;lagie, he was in the Conciergerie on the day of the 13th of 
June, 1849, which ended with the violent suppression of &ldquo;Le 
Peuple.&rdquo;  He then began to write the &ldquo;Confessions of a 
Revolutionist,&rdquo; published towards the end of the year.  He had 
been again transferred to Sainte-P&eacute;lagie, when he married, in 
December, 1849, Mlle. Euphrasie Pi&eacute;gard, a young working 
 
<pb n="xliii"/> girl whose hand he had requested in 1847.  Madame 
Proudhon bore him four daughters, of whom but two, Catherine and 
St&eacute;phanie, survived their father.  St&eacute;phanie died in 1873. 
</p> 
<p>In October, 1849, &ldquo;Le Peuple&rdquo; was replaced by a 
new journal, &ldquo;La Voix du Peuple,&rdquo; which Proudhon 
edited from his prison cell.  In it were published his discussions with 
Pierre Leroux and Bastiat.  The political articles which he sent to 
&ldquo;La Voix du Peuple&rdquo; so displeased the government 
finally, that it transferred him to Doullens, where he was secretly 
confined for some time.  Afterwards taken back to Paris, to appear 
before the assizes of the Seine in reference to an article in &ldquo;La 
Voix du Peuple,&rdquo; he was defended by M. Cremieux and 
acquitted.  From the Conciergerie he went again to Sainte-P&eacute;lagie, where he ended his three years in prison on the 6th of 
June, 1852. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;La Voix du Peuple,&rdquo; suppressed before the 
promulgation of the law of the 31st of May, had been replaced by a 
weekly sheet, &ldquo;Le Peuple&rdquo; of 1850.  Established by the 
aid of the principal members of the Mountain, this journal soon met with 
the fate of its predecessors. 
</p> 
<p>In 1851, several months before the <hi rend="italic">coup d'Etat</hi>, 
Proudhon published the &ldquo;General Idea of the Revolution of the 
Nineteenth Century,&rdquo; in which, after having shown the logical 
series of unitary governments, &mdash; from monarchy, which is the first term, 
to the direct government of the people, which is the last, &mdash; he opposes 
the ideal of an-archy or self-government to the communistic or 
governmental ideal. 
</p> 
<p>At this period, the Socialist party, discouraged by the elections of 
1849, which resulted in a greater conservative triumph than those of 
1848, and justly angry with the national representative body which had 
just passed the law of the  
<pb n="xliv"/> 31st of May, 1850, demanded direct legislation and 
direct government.  Proudhon, who did not want, at any price, the 
plebiscitary system which he had good reason to regard as destructive of 
liberty, did not hesitate to point out, to those of his friends who expected 
every thing from direct legislation, one of the antinomies of universal 
suffrage.  In so far as it is an institution intended to achieve, for the 
benefit of the greatest number, the social reforms to which landed 
suffrage is opposed, universal suffrage is powerless; especially if it 
pretends to legislate or govern directly.  For, until the social reforms are 
accomplished, the greatest number is of necessity the least enlightened, 
and consequently the least capable of understanding and effecting 
reforms.  In regard to the antinomy, pointed out by him, of liberty and 
government, &mdash;  whether the latter be monarchic, aristocratic, or 
democratic in form, &mdash; Proudhon, whose chief desire was to preserve 
liberty, naturally sought the solution in the free contract.  But though the 
free contract may be a practical solution of purely economical questions, 
it cannot be made use of in politics.  Proudhon recognized this ten years 
later, when his beautiful study on &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo; led 
him to find in the <hi rend="italic">federative principle</hi> the exact equilibrium 
of liberty and government. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d' 
Etat&rdquo; appeared in 1852, a few months after his release from 
prison.  At that time, terror prevailed to such an extent that no one was 
willing to publish his book without express permission from the 
government.  He succeeded in obtaining this permission by writing to 
Louis Bonaparte a letter which he published at the same time with the 
work.  The latter being offered for sale, Proudhon was warned that he 
would not be  
<pb n="xlv"/> allowed to publish any more books of the same 
character.  At that time he entertained the idea of writing a universal 
history entitled &ldquo;Chronos.&rdquo;  This project was never 
fulfilled. 
</p> 
<p>Already the father of two children, and about to be presented with 
a third, Proudhon was obliged to devise some immediate means of 
gaining a living; he resumed his labors, and published, at first 
anonymously, the &ldquo;Manual of a Speculator in the Stock-Exchange.&rdquo;  Later, in 1857, after having completed the work, he 
did not hesitate to sign it, acknowledging in the preface his indebtedness 
to his collaborator, G. Duch&ecirc;ne. 
</p> 
<p>Meantime, he vainly sought permission to establish a journal, or 
review.  This permission was steadily refused him.  The imperial 
government always suspected him after the publication of the 
&ldquo;Social Revolution Demonstrated by the Coup d'Etat.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Towards the end of 1853, Proudhon issued in Belgium a pamphlet 
entitled &ldquo;The Philosophy of Progress.&rdquo;  Entirely 
inoffensive as it was, this pamphlet, which he endeavored to send into 
France, was seized on the frontier.  Proudhon's complaints were of no 
avail. 
</p> 
<p>The empire gave grants after grants to large companies.  A 
financial society, having asked for the grant of a railroad in the east of 
France, employed Proudhon to write several memoirs in support of this 
demand.  The grant was given to another company.  The author was 
offered an indemnity as compensation, to be paid (as was customary in 
such cases) by the company which received the grant.  It is needless to 
say that Proudhon would accept nothing.  Then, wishing to explain to the 
public, as well as to the government, the end which he  
<pb n="xlvi"/> had in view, he published the work entitled 
&ldquo;Reforms to be Effected in the Management of 
Railroads.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Towards the end of 1854, Proudhon had already begun his book on 
&ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; when he had a violent attack of cholera, from 
which he recovered with great difficulty.  Ever afterwards his health was 
delicate. 
</p> 
<p>At last, on the 22d of April, 1858, he published, in three large 
volumes, the important work upon which he had labored since 1854.  
This work had two titles: the first, &ldquo;Justice in the Revolution and 
in the Church;&rdquo; the second, &ldquo;New Principles of Practical 
Philosophy, addressed to His Highness Monseigneur Mathieu, Cardinal-Archbishop of Besan&ccedil;on.&rdquo;  On the 27th of April, when 
there had scarcely been time to read the work, an order was issued by 
the magistrate for its seizure; on the 28th the seizure was effected.  To 
this first act of the magistracy, the author of the incriminated book 
replied on the 11th of May in a strongly-motived petition, demanding a 
revision of the concordat of 1802; or, in other words, a new adjustment 
of the relations between Church and State.  At bottom, this petition was 
but the logical consequence of the work itself.  An edition of a thousand 
copies being published on the 17th of May, the &ldquo;Petition to the 
Senate&rdquo; was regarded by the public prosecutor as an aggravation 
of the offence or offences discovered in the body of the work to which it 
was an appendix, and was seized in its turn on the 23d.  On the first of 
June, the author appealed to the Senate in a second 
&ldquo;Petition,&rdquo; which was deposited with the first in the office 
of the Secretary of the Assembly, the guardian and guarantee, according 
to the constitution of 1852, of the principles of '89.  On the 2d of June, 
the two processes being united, Proudhon  
<pb n="xlvii"/> appeared at the bar with his publisher, the printer of 
the book, and the printer of the petition, to receive the sentence of the 
police magistrate, which condemned him to three years' imprisonment, a 
fine of four thousand francs, and the suppression of his work.  It is 
needless to say that the publisher and printers were also condemned by 
the sixth chamber. 
</p> 
<p>Proudhon lodged an appeal; he wrote a memoir which the law of 
1819, in the absence of which he would have been liable to a new 
prosecution, gave him the power to publish previous to the hearing.  
Having decided to make use of the means which the law permitted, he 
urged in vain the printers who were prosecuted with him to lend him 
their aid.  He then demanded of Attorney-General Chaix d'Est Ange a 
statement to the effect that the twenty-third article of the law of the 17th 
of May, 1819, allows a written defence, and that a printer runs no risk 
in printing it.  The attorney-general flatly refused.  Proudhon then 
started for Belgium, where he printed his defence, which could not, of 
course, cross the French frontier.  This memoir is entitled to rank with 
the best of Beaumarchais's; it is entitled:  &ldquo;Justice prosecuted by 
the Church; An Appeal from the Sentence passed upon P. J. Proudhon 
by the Police Magistrate of the Seine, on the 2d of June, 1858.&rdquo;  
A very close discussion of the grounds of the judgment of the sixth 
chamber, it was at the same time an excellent 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</hi> of his great work. 
</p> 
<p>Once in Belgium, Proudhon did not fail to remain there.  In 1859, 
after the general amnesty which followed the Italian war, he at first 
thought himself included in it.  But the imperial government, consulted 
by his friends, notified him that, in its opinion, and in spite of the 
contrary advice of M. Faus 
<pb n="xlviii"/> tin H&eacute;lie, his condemnation was not of a 
political character.  Proudhon, thus classed by the government with the 
authors of immoral works, thought it beneath his dignity to protest, and 
waited patiently for the advent of 1863 to allow him to return to France. 
</p> 
<p>In Belgium, where he was not slow in forming new friendships, he 
published in 1859-60, in separate parts, a new edition of his great work 
on &ldquo;Justice.&rdquo;  Each number contained, in addition to the 
original text carefully reviewed and corrected, numerous explanatory 
notes and some &ldquo;Tidings of the Revolution.&rdquo;  In these 
tidings, which form a sort of review of the progress of ideas in Europe, 
Proudhon sorrowfully asserts that, after having for a long time marched 
at the head of the progressive nations, France has become, without 
appearing to suspect it, the most retrogressive of nations; and he 
considers her more than once as seriously threatened with moral death. 
</p> 
<p>The Italian war led him to write a new work, which he published 
in 1861, entitled &ldquo;War and Peace.&rdquo;  This work, in which, 
running counter to a multitude of ideas accepted until then without 
examination, he pronounced for the first time against the restoration of 
an aristocratic and priestly Poland, and against the establishment of a 
unitary government in Italy, created for him a multitude of enemies.  
Most of his friends, disconcerted by his categorical affirmation of a right 
of force, notified him that they decidedly disapproved of his new 
publication.  &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; triumphantly cried those whom 
he had always combated, &ldquo;this man is only a sophist.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Led by his previous studies to test every thing by the question of 
right, Proudhon asks, in his &ldquo;War and Peace,&rdquo; whether 
there is a real right of which war is the vindication, and vic 
<pb n="xlix"/> tory the demonstration.  This right, which he roughly 
calls the right of the strongest or the right of force, and which is, after 
all, only the right of the most worthy to the preference in certain definite 
cases, exists, says Proudhon, independently of war.  It cannot be 
legitimately vindicated except where necessity clearly demands the 
subordination of one will to another, and within the limits in which it 
exists; that is, without ever involving the enslavement of one by the 
other.  Among nations, the right of the majority, which is only a 
corollary of the right of force, is as unacceptable as universal monarchy.  
Hence, until equilibrium is established and recognized between States or 
national forces, there must be war.  War, says Proudhon, is not always 
necessary to determine which side is the strongest; and he has no trouble 
in proving this by examples drawn from the family, the workshop, and 
elsewhere.  Passing then to the study of war, he proves that it by no 
means corresponds in practice to that which it ought to be according to 
his theory of the right of force.  The systematic horrors of war naturally 
lead him to seek a cause for it other than the vindication of this right; 
and then only does the economist take it upon himself to denounce this 
cause to those who, like himself, want peace.  The necessity of finding 
abroad a compensation for the misery resulting in every nation from the 
absence of economical equilibrium, is, according to Proudhon, the ever 
real, though ever concealed, cause of war.  The pages devoted to this 
demonstration and to his theory of poverty, which he clearly 
distinguishes from misery and pauperism, shed entirely new light upon 
the philosophy of history.  As for the author's conclusion, it is a very 
simple one.  Since the treaty of Westphalia, and especially since the 
treaties of 1815, equilibrium has been the international law of 
Europe.  It remains now, not to destroy it, but, while maintaining it, to 
labor peacefully, in every nation protected by it, for the equilibrium of 
economical forces.  The last line of the book, evidently written to check 
imperial ambition, is:  &ldquo;Humanity wants no more war.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In 1861, after Garibaldi's expedition and the battle of 
Castelfidardo, Proudhon immediately saw that the establishment of 
Italian unity would be a severe blow to European equilibrium.  It was 
chiefly in order to maintain this equilibrium that he pronounced so 
energetically in favor of Italian federation, even though it should be at 
first only a federation of monarchs.  In vain was it objected that, in 
being established by France, Italian unity would break European 
equilibrium in our favor.  Proudhon, appealing to history, showed that 
every State which breaks the equilibrium in its own favor only causes the 
other States to combine against it, and thereby diminishes its influence 
and power.  He added that, nations being essentially selfish, Italy would 
not fail, when opportunity offered, to place her interest above her 
gratitude. 
</p> 
<p>To maintain European equilibrium by diminishing great States and 
multiplying small ones; to unite the latter in organized federations, not 
for attack, but for defence; and with these federations, which, if they 
were not republican already, would quickly become so, to hold in check 
the great military monarchies, &mdash; such, in the beginning of 1861, was the 
political programme of Proudhon. 
</p> 
<p>The object of the federations, he said, will be to guarantee, as far 
as possible, the beneficent reign of peace; and they will have the further 
effect of securing in every nation the triumph  
<pb n="li"/> of liberty over despotism.  Where the largest unitary 
State is, there liberty is in the greatest danger; further, if this State be 
democratic, despotism without the counterpoise of majorities is to be 
feared.  With the federation, it is not so.  The universal suffrage of the 
federal State is checked by the universal suffrage of the federated States; 
and the latter is offset in its turn by <hi rend="italic">property</hi>, the 
stronghold of liberty, which it tends, not to destroy, but to balance with 
the institutions of <hi rend="italic">mutualism</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>All these ideas, and many others which were only hinted at in his 
work on &ldquo;War and Peace,&rdquo; were developed by Proudhon 
in his subsequent publications, one of which has for its motto, 
&ldquo;Reforms always, Utopias never.&rdquo;  The thinker had 
evidently finished his evolution. 
</p> 
<p>The Council of State of the canton of Vaud having offered prizes 
for essays on the question of taxation, previously discussed at a congress 
held at Lausanne, Proudhon entered the ranks and carried off the first 
prize.  His memoir was published in 1861 under the title of &ldquo;The 
Theory of Taxation.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>About the same time, he wrote at Brussels, in &ldquo;L'Office de 
Publicit&eacute;,&rdquo; some remarkable articles on the question of 
literary property, which was discussed at a congress held in Belgium, 
These articles must not be confounded with &ldquo;Literary 
Majorats,&rdquo; a more complete work on the same subject, which 
was published in 1863, soon after his return to France. 
</p> 
<p>Arbitrarily excepted from the amnesty in 1859, Proudhon was 
pardoned two years later by a special act.  He did not wish to take 
advantage of this favor, and seemed resolved to remain in Belgium until 
the 2d of June, 1863, the time when he was to acquire the privilege of 
prescription, when an absurd  
<pb n="lii"/> and ridiculous riot, excited in Brussels by an article 
published by him on federation and unity in Italy, induced him to hasten 
his return to France.  Stones were thrown against the house in which he 
lived, in the Faubourg d'Ixelles.  After having placed his wife and 
daughters in safety among his friends at Brussels, he arrived in Paris in 
September, 1862, and published there, &ldquo;Federation and Italian 
Unity,&rdquo; a pamphlet which naturally commences with the article 
which served as a pretext for the rioters in Brussels. 
</p> 
<p>Among the works begun by Proudhon while in Belgium, which 
death did not allow him to finish, we ought to mention a &ldquo;History 
of Poland,&rdquo; which will be published later; and, &ldquo;The 
Theory of Property,&rdquo; which appeared in 1865, before 
&ldquo;The Gospels Annotated,&rdquo; and after the volume entitled 
&ldquo;The Principle of Art and its Social Destiny.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The publications of Proudhon, in 1863, were: 1. &ldquo;Literary 
Majorats:  An Examination of a Bill having for its object the Creation of 
a Perpetual Monopoly for the Benefit of Authors, Inventors, and 
Artists;&rdquo; 2. &ldquo;The Federative Principle and the Necessity 
of Re-establishing the Revolutionary party;&rdquo; 3. &ldquo;The 
Sworn Democrats and the Refractories;&rdquo; 4. &ldquo;Whether the 
Treaties of 1815 have ceased to exist?  Acts of the Future 
Congress.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The disease which was destined to kill him grew worse and worse; 
but Proudhon labored constantly! . . .  A series of articles, published in 
1864 in &ldquo;Le Messager de Paris,&rdquo; have been collected in a 
pamphlet under the title of &ldquo;New Observations on Italian 
Unity.&rdquo;  He hoped to publish during the same year his work on 
&ldquo;The Political Capacity of the Working Classes,&rdquo; but was 
unable to write the last chapter. . . .  He grew weaker  
<pb n="liii"/> continually.  His doctor prescribed rest.  In the month 
of August he went to Franche-Comt&eacute;, where he spent a month.  
Having returned to Paris, he resumed his labor with difficulty. . . .  
From the month of December onwards, the heart disease made rapid 
progress; the oppression became insupportable, his legs were swollen, 
and he could not sleep. . . . 
</p> 
<p>On the 19th of January, 1865, he died, towards two o'clock in the 
morning, in the arms of his wife, his sister-in-law, and the friend who 
writes these lines. . . . 
</p> 
<p>The publication of his correspondence, to which his daughter 
Catherine is faithfully devoted, will tend, no doubt, to increase his 
reputation as a thinker, as a writer, and as an honest man.

<head>PREFACE.</head> 
<p>The following letter served as a preface to the first edition of this 
memoir: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To the Members of the Academy of 
Besan&ccedil;on</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;PARIS, June 30, 1840. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;GENTLEMEN, &mdash; In the course of your debate of the 9th 
of May, 1833, in regard to the triennial pension established by Madame 
Suard, you expressed the following wish: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo; `The Academy requests the titulary to present it annually, 
during the first fortnight in July, with a succinct and logical statement of 
the various studies which he has pursued during the year which has just 
expired.' 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I now propose, gentlemen, to discharge this duty. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When I solicited your votes, I boldly avowed my intention 
to bend my efforts to the discovery of some means of <hi rend="italic">ameliorating 
the physical, moral, and intellectual condition of the mere numerous and 
poorer classes</hi>.  This idea, foreign as it may have seemed to the 
object of my candidacy, you received favorably; and, by the precious 
distinction with which it has been your pleasure to honor me, you 
changed this formal offer into an inviolable and sacred obligation.  
Thenceforth I understood with how worthy and honorable a society I had 
to deal: my regard for its enlightenment, my recognition of its benefits, 
my enthusiasm for its glory, were unbounded. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Convinced at once that, in order to break loose from the 
beaten paths of opinions and systems, it was necessary to proceed in my 
study of man and society by scientific methods, and in a rigorous 
manner, I devoted one year to philology and grammar; linguistics, or the 
natural history of speech, being, of all the sciences, that which was best 
suited to the character of my mind, seemed to bear the closest relation to 
the researches which I was about to commence.  A treatise, written at 
this period upon  
 
<pb n="2"/>  
one of the most interesting questions of comparative grammar,[1] if it 
did not reveal the astonishing success, at least bore witness to the 
thoroughness, of my labors. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Since that time, metaphysics and moral science have been 
my only studies; my perception of the fact that these sciences, though 
badly defined as to their object and not confined to their sphere, are, like 
the natural sciences, susceptible of demonstration and certainty, has 
already rewarded my efforts. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, of all the masters whom I have followed, 
to none do I owe so much as to you.  Your co-operation, your 
programmes, your instructions, in agreement with my secret wishes and 
most cherished hopes, have at no time failed to enlighten me and to point 
out my road; this memoir on property is the child of your thought. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In 1838, the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on proposed the 
following question:  <hi rend="italic">To what causes must we attribute the 
continually increasing number of suicides, and what are the proper 
means for arresting the effects of this moral contagion?</hi> 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Thereby it asked, in less general terms, what was the 
cause of the social evil, and what was its remedy?  You admitted that 
yourselves, gentlemen when your committee reported that the 
competitors had enumerated with exactness the immediate and particular 
causes of suicide, as well as the means of preventing each of them; but 
that from this enumeration, chronicled with more or less skill, no 
positive information had been gained, either as to the primary cause of 
the evil, or as to its remedy. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In 1839, your programme, always original and varied in 
its academical expression, became more exact.  The investigations of 
1838 had pointed out, as the causes or rather as the symptoms of the 
social malady, the neglect of the principles of religion and morality, the 
desire for wealth, the passion for enjoyment, and political disturbances.  
All these data were embodied by you in a single proposition:  <hi rend="italic">The 
utility of the celebration of Sunday as regards hygiene, morality, and 
social and political relations</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In a Christian tongue you asked, gentlemen, what was the 
true system of society.  A competitor[2] dared to maintain, and believed 
that he

<p>[2] &ldquo;The Utility of the Celebration of Sunday,&rdquo; &amp;c.

<pb n="3"/>  
had proved, that the institution of a day of rest at weekly intervals is 
inseparably bound up with a political system based on the equality of 
conditions; that without equality this institution is an anomaly and an 
impossibility: that equality alone can revive this ancient and mysterious 
keeping of the seventh day.  This argument did not meet with your 
approbation, since, without denying the relation pointed out by the 
competitor, you judged, and rightly gentlemen, that the principle of 
equality of conditions not being demonstrated, the ideas of the author 
were nothing more than hypotheses. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Finally, gentlemen, this fundamental principle of equality 
you presented for competition in the following terms:  <hi rend="italic">The 
economical and moral consequences in France up to the present time, 
and those which seem likely to appear in future, of the law concerning 
the equal division of hereditary property between the children</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Instead of confining one to common places without 
breadth or significance, it seems to me that your question should be 
developed as follows: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the law has been able to render the right of heredity 
common to all the children of one father, can it not render it equal for 
all his grandchildren and great-grandchildren? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the law no longer heeds the age of any member of the 
family, can it not, by the right of heredity, cease to heed it in the race, 
in the tribe, in the nation? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Can equality, by the right of succession, be preserved 
between citizens, as well as between cousins and brothers?  In a word, 
can the principle of succession become a principle of equality? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To sum up all these ideas in one inclusive question:  What 
is the principle of heredity?  What are the foundations of inequality?  
What is property? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Such, gentlemen, is the object of the memoir that I offer 
you to day. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If I have rightly grasped the object of your thought; if I 
succeed in bringing to light a truth which is indisputable, but, from 
causes which I am bold enough to claim to have explained, has always 
been misunderstood; if by an infallible method of investigation, I 
establish the dogma of equality of conditions; if I determine the principle 
of civil law, the essence of justice, and the form of society; if I 
annihilate property forever, &mdash; to you, gentlemen, will redound all the 
glory, for it is to your aid and your inspiration that I owe it. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;My purpose in this work is the application of method to 
the problems of philosophy; every other intention is foreign to and even 
abusive of it. 
 
<pb n="4"/>  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I have spoken lightly of jurisprudence:  I had the right; 
but I should be unjust did I not distinguish between this pretended 
science and the men who practise it.  Devoted to studies both laborious 
and severe, entitled in all respects to the esteem of their fellow-citizens 
by their knowledge and eloquence our legists deserve but one reproach, 
that of an excessive deference to arbitrary laws. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I have been pitiless in my criticism of the economists: for 
them I confess that, in general, I have no liking.  The arrogance and the 
emptiness of their writings, their impertinent pride and their unwarranted 
blunders, have disgusted me.  Whoever, knowing them, pardons them, 
may read them. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I have severely blamed the learned Christian Church: it 
was my duty.  This blame results from the facts which I call attention to: 
why has the Church decreed concerning things which it does not 
understand?  The Church has erred in dogma and in morals; physics and 
mathematics testify against her.  It may be wrong for me to say it, but 
surely it is unfortunate for Christianity that it is true.  To restore 
religion, gentlemen, it is necessary to condemn the Church. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will regret, gentlemen, that, in giving all my 
attention to method and evidence, I have too much neglected form and 
style: in vain should I have tried to do better.  Literary hope and faith I 
have none.  The nineteenth century is, in my eyes, a genesic era, in 
which new principles are elaborated, but in which nothing that is written 
shall endure.  That is the reason, in my opinion, why, among so many 
men of talent, France to-day counts not one great writer.  In a society 
like ours, to seek for literary glory seems to me an anachronism.  Of 
what use is it to invoke an ancient sibyl when a muse is on the eve of 
birth?  Pitiable actors in a tragedy nearing its end, that which it behooves 
us to do is to precipitate the catastrophe.  The most deserving among us 
is he who plays best this part.  Well, I no longer aspire to this sad 
success! 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not confess it, gentlemen?  I have aspired to 
your suffrages and sought the title of your pensioner, hating all which 
exists and full of projects for its destruction; I shall finish this 
investigation in a spirit of calm and philosophical resignation.  I have 
derived more peace from the knowledge of the truth, than anger from the 
feeling of oppression; and the most precious fruit that I could wish to 
gather from this memoir would be the inspiration of my readers with that 
tranquillity of soul which arises from the clear perception of evil and its 
cause, and which is much more powerful than passion and enthusiasm.  
My hatred of privilege and human authority was unbounded; perhaps at 
times I <pb n="5"/>have been guilty, in my indignation, of confounding 
persons and things; at present I can only despise and complain; to cease 
to hate I only needed to know. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It is for you now, gentlemen, whose mission and character 
are the proclamation of the truth, it is for you to instruct the people, and 
to tell them for what they ought to hope and what they ought to fear.  
The people, incapable as yet of sound judgment as to what is best for 
them, applaud indiscriminately the most opposite ideas, provided that in 
them they get a taste of flattery: to them the laws of thought are like the 
confines of the possible; to-day they can no more distinguish between a 
<hi rend="italic">savant</hi> and a sophist, than formerly they could tell a 
physician from a sorcerer.  `Inconsiderately accepting, gathering 
together, and accumulating everything that is new, regarding all reports 
as true and indubitable, at the breath or ring of novelty they assemble 
like bees at the sound of a basin.'[1] 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;May you, gentlemen, desire equality as I myself desire it; 
may you, for the eternal happiness of our country, become its 
propagators and its heralds; may I be the last of your pensioners!  Of all 
the wishes that I can frame, that, gentlemen, is the most worthy of you 
and the most honorable for me. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I am, with the profoundest respect and the most earnest 
gratitude,

<p>                                &ldquo;Your

&ldquo;P. J. PROUDHON.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Two months after the receipt of this letter, the Academy, in its 
debate of August 24th, replied to the address of its pensioner by a note, 
the text of which I give below: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A member calls the attention of the Academy to a 
pamphlet, published last June by the titulary of the Suard pension, 
entitled, &ldquo;What is property?&rdquo; and dedicated by the author 
to the Academy.  He is of the opinion that the society owes it to justice, 
to example, and to its own dignity, to publicly disavow all responsibility 
for the anti-social doctrines contained in this publication.  In consequence 
he demands: 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;1.  That the Academy disavow and condemn, in the most 
formal manner, the work of the Suard pensioner, as having been 
published without its assent, and as attributing to it opinions 
diametrically opposed to the principles of each of its members; 
 
 
[1] Charron, on &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; Chapter xviii. 
 
<pb n="6"/> 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;2.  That the pensioner be charged, in case he should 
publish a second edition of his book, to omit the dedication; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;3.  That this judgment of the Academy be placed upon the 
records. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;These three propositions, put to vote, are 
adopted.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>After this ludicrous decree, which its authors thought to render 
powerful by giving it the form of a contradiction, I can only beg the 
reader not to measure the intelligence of my compatriots by that of our 
Academy. 
</p> 
<p>While my patrons in the social and political sciences were 
fulminating anathemas against my <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi>, a man, who 
was a stranger to Franche-Comt&eacute;, who did not know me, who 
might even have regarded himself as personally attacked by the too sharp 
judgment which I had passed upon the economists, a publicist as learned 
as he was modest, loved by the people whose sorrows he felt, honored 
by the power which he sought to enlighten without flattering or 
disgracing it, M. Blanqui &mdash; member of the Institute, professor of 
political economy, defender of property &mdash; took up my defence before his 
associates and before the ministry, and saved me from the blows of a 
justice which is always blind, because it is always ignorant. 
</p> 
<p>It seems to me that the reader will peruse with pleasure the letter 
which M. Blanqui did me the honor to write to me upon the publication 
of my second memoir, a letter as honorable to its author as it is flattering 
to him to whom it is addressed. 
 
</p> 
<p>                                &ldquo;PARIS, May 
1, 1841. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;MONSIEUR, &mdash; I hasten to thank you for forwarding to 
me your second memoir upon property.  I have read it with all the 
interest that an acquaintance with the first would naturally inspire.  I am 
very glad that you have modified somewhat the rudeness of form which 
gave to a work of such gravity the manner and appearance of a 
pamphlet; for you quite frightened me, sir, and your talent was needed to 
reassure me in regard to your intentions.  One does not expend so much 
real knowledge with the <pb n="7"/>purpose of inflaming his country.  This 
proposition, now coming into notice &mdash; <hi rend="italic">property is robbery</hi>! 
&mdash; was of a nature to repel from your book even those serious minds who 
do not judge by appearances, had you persisted in maintaining it in its 
rude simplicity.  But if you have softened the form, you are none the 
less faithful to the ground-work of your doctrines; and although you have 
done me the honor to give me a share in this perilous teaching, I cannot 
accept a partnership which, as far as talent goes, would surely be a 
credit to me, but which would compromise me in all other respects. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you in one thing only; namely, that all kinds 
of property get too frequently abused in this world.  But I do not reason 
from the abuse to the abolition, &mdash; an heroic remedy too much like death, 
which cures all evils.  I will go farther: I will confess that, of all abuses, 
the most hateful to me are those of property; but once more, there is a 
remedy for this evil without violating it, all the more without destroying 
it.  If the present laws allow abuse, we can reconstruct them.  Our civil 
code is not the Koran; it is not wrong to examine it.  Change, then, the 
laws which govern the use of property, but be sparing of anathemas; for, 
logically, where is the honest man whose hands are entirely clean?  Do 
you think that one can be a robber without knowing it, without wishing 
it, without suspecting it?  Do you not admit that society in its present 
state, like every man, has in its constitution all kinds of virtues and vices 
inherited from our ancestors?  Is property, then, in your eyes a thing so 
simple and so abstract that you can re-knead and equalize it, if I may so 
speak, in your metaphysical mill?  One who has said as many excellent 
and practical things as occur in these two beautiful and paradoxical 
improvisations of yours cannot be a pure and unwavering utopist.  You 
are too well acquainted with the economical and academical phraseology 
to play with the hard words of revolutions.  I believe, then, that you 
have handled property as Rousseau, eighty years ago, handled letters, 
with a magnificent and poetical display of wit and knowledge.  Such, at 
least, is my opinion. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That is what I said to the Institute at the time when I 
presented my report upon your book.  I knew that they wished to 
proceed against you in the courts; you perhaps do not know by how 
narrow a chance I succeeded in preventing them.[1]  What chagrin I 
should always have felt, if 
 
 
[1] M. Vivien, Minister of Justice, before commencing proceedings 
against the &ldquo;Memoir upon Property,&rdquo; asked the opinion of 
M. Blanqui; and it was on the strength of the observations of this 
honorable academician that he spared a book <pb n="8"/>
 
the king's counsel, that is to say, the intellectual executioner, had 
followed in my very tracks to attack your book and annoy your person!  
I actually passed two terrible nights, and I succeeded in restraining the 
secular arm only by showing that your book was an academical 
dissertation, and not the manifesto of an incendiary.  Your style is too 
lofty ever to be of service to the madmen who in discussing the gravest 
questions of our social order, use paving-stones as their weapons.  But 
see to it, sir, that ere long they do not come, in spite of you, to seek for 
ammunition in this formidable arsenal, and that your vigorous 
metaphysics falls not into the hands of some sophist of the market-place, 
who might discuss the question in the presence of a starving audience: 
we should have pillage for conclusion and peroration. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I feel as deeply as you, sir, the abuses which you point 
out; but I have so great an affection for order, &mdash; not that common and 
strait-laced order with which the police are satisfied, but the majestic and 
imposing order of human societies, &mdash; that I sometimes find myself 
embarrassed in attacking certain abuses.  I like to rebuild with one hand 
when I am compelled to destroy with the other.  In pruning an old tree, 
we guard against destruction of the buds and fruit.  You know that as 
well as any one.  You are a wise and learned man; you have a thoughtful 
mind.  The terms by which you characterize the fanatics of our day are 
strong enough to reassure the most suspicious imaginations as to your 
intentions; but you conclude in favor of the abolition of property!  You 
wish to abolish the most powerful motor of the human mind; you attack 
the paternal sentiment in its sweetest illusions; with one word you arrest 
the formation of capital, and we build henceforth upon the sand instead 
of on a rock.  That I cannot agree to; and for that reason I have 
criticised your book, so full of beautiful pages, so brilliant with 
knowledge and fervor! 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;I wish, sir, that my impaired health would permit me to 
examine with you, page by page, the memoir which you have done me 
the honor to ad- 
 
which had already excited the indignation of the magistrates.  M. Vivien 
is not the only official to whom I have been indebted, since my first 
publication, for assistance and protection; but such generosity in the 
political arena is so rare that one may acknowledge it graciously and 
freely.  I have always thought, for my part, that bad institutions made 
bad magistrates; just as the cowardice and hypocrisy of certain bodies 
results solely from the spirit which governs them.  Why, for instance, in 
spite of the virtues and talents for which they are so noted, are the 
academies generally centres of intellectual repression, stupidity, and base 
intrigue?  That question ought to be proposed by an academy: there 
would be no lack of competitors. 
 
 
<pb n="9"/>dress to me publicly and personally; I think I could offer some 
important criticisms.  For the moment, I must content myself with 
thanking you for the kind words in which you have seen fit to speak of 
me.  We each possess the merit of sincerity; I desire also the merit of 
prudence.  You know how deep-seated is the disease under which the 
working-people are suffering; I know how many noble hearts beat under 
those rude garments, and I feel an irresistible and fraternal sympathy 
with the thousands of brave people who rise early in the morning to 
labor, to pay their taxes, and to make our country strong.  I try to serve 
and enlighten them, whereas some endeavor to mislead them.  You have 
not written directly for them.  You have issued two magnificent 
manifestoes, the second more guarded than the first; issue a third more 
guarded than the second, and you will take high rank in science, whose 
first precept is calmness and impartiality. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, sir!  No man's esteem for another can exceed 
mine for you. 
</p> 
<p>                                           
&ldquo;BLANQUI.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>I should certainly take some exceptions to this noble and eloquent 
letter; but I confess that I am more inclined to realize the prediction with 
which it terminates than to augment needlessly the number of my 
antagonists.  So much controversy fatigues and wearies me.  The 
intelligence expended in the warfare of words is like that employed in 
battle: it is intelligence wasted.  M. Blanqui acknowledges that property 
is abused in many harmful ways; I call <hi rend="italic">property</hi> the sum 
these abuses exclusively.  To each of us property seems a polygon whose 
angles need knocking off; but, the operation performed, M. Blanqui 
maintains that the figure will still be a polygon (an hypothesis admitted 
in mathematics, although not proven), while I consider that this figure 
will be a circle.  Honest people can at least understand one another. 
</p> 
<p>For the rest, I allow that, in the present state of the question, the 
mind may legitimately hesitate before deciding in favor of the abolition 
of property.  To gain the victory for one's cause, it does not suffice 
simply to overthrow a principle  
<pb n="10"/> generally recognized, which has the indisputable merit of 
systematically recapitulating our political theories; it is also necessary to 
establish the opposite principle, and to formulate the system which must 
proceed from it.  Still further, it is necessary to show the method by 
which the new system will satisfy all the moral and political needs which 
induced the establishment of the first.  On the following conditions, then, 
of subsequent evidence, depends the correctness of my preceding 
arguments: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>The discovery of a system of absolute equality in which all existing 
institutions, save property, or the sum of the abuses of property, not only 
may find a place, but may themselves serve as instruments of equality: 
individual liberty, the division of power, the public ministry, the jury 
system, administrative and judicial organization, the unity and 
completeness of instruction, marriage, the family, heredity in direct and 
collateral succession, the right of sale and exchange, the right to make a 
will, and even birthright, &mdash; a system which, better than property, 
guarantees the formation of capital and keeps up the courage of all; 
which, from a superior point of view, explains, corrects, and completes 
the theories of association hitherto proposed, from Plato and Pythagoras 
to Babeuf, Saint Simon, and Fourier; a system, finally, which, serving as 
a means of transition, is immediately applicable. 
</p> 
<p>A work so vast requires, I am aware, the united efforts of twenty 
Montesquieus; nevertheless, if it is not given to a single man to finish, a 
single one can commence, the enterprise.  The road that he shall traverse 
will suffice to show the end and assure the result.

<p>
If I were asked to answer the following question:  <hi rend="italic">What is 
slavery?</hi>  and I should answer in one word, <hi rend="italic">It is 
murder</hi>, my meaning would be understood at once.  No extended 
argument would be required to show that the power to take from a man 
his thought, his will, his personality, is a power of life and death; and 
that to enslave a man is to kill him.  Why, then, to this other question:  
<hi rend="italic">What is property!</hi> may I not likewise answer, <hi rend="italic">It is 
robbery</hi>, without the certainty of being misunderstood; the second 
proposition being no other than a transformation of the first? 
</p> 
<p>I undertake to discuss the vital principle of our government and 
our institutions, property:  I am in my right.  I may be mistaken in the 
conclusion which shall result from my investigations:  I am in my right.  
I think best to place the last thought of my book first: still am I in my 
right. 
 
<pb n="12"/>  
</p> 
<p>Such an author teaches that property is a civil right, born of 
occupation and sanctioned by law; another maintains that it is a natural 
right, originating in labor, &mdash; and both of these doctrines, totally opposed 
as they may seem, are encouraged and applauded.  I contend that neither 
labor, nor occupation, nor law, can create property; that it is an effect 
without a cause: am I censurable? 
</p> 
<p>But murmurs arise! 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Property is robbery</hi>!  That is the war-cry of '93!  
That is the signal of revolutions! 
</p> 
<p>Reader, calm yourself:  I am no agent of discord, no firebrand of 
sedition.  I anticipate history by a few days; I disclose a truth whose 
development we may try in vain to arrest; I write the preamble of our 
future constitution.  This proposition which seems to you blasphemous &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">property is robbery</hi> &mdash; would, if our prejudices allowed us 
to consider it, be recognized as the lightning-rod to shield us from the 
coming thunderbolt; but too many interests stand in the way! . . .  Alas! 
philosophy will not change the course of events: destiny will fulfill itself 
regardless of prophecy.  Besides, must not justice be done and our 
education be finished? 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Property is robbery! . . . </hi> What a revolution in 
human ideas!  <hi rend="italic">Proprietor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">robber</hi> have 
been at all times expressions as contradictory as the beings whom they 
designate are hostile; all languages have perpetuated this opposition.  On 
what authority, then, do you venture to attack universal consent, and 
give the lie to the human race?  Who are you, that you should question 
the judgment of the nations and the ages? 
</p> 
<p>Of what consequence to you, reader, is my obscure individuality?  
I live, like you, in a century in which reason submits only to fact and to 
evidence.  My name, like yours, is TRUTH-<pb n="13"/> SEEKER.[1]  My mission is written in these words of 
the law:  <hi rend="italic">Speak without hatred and without fear; tell that which 
thou knowest!</hi>  The work of our race is to build the temple of 
science, and this science includes man and Nature.  Now, truth reveals 
itself to all; to-day to Newton and Pascal, tomorrow to the herdsman in 
the valley and the journeyman in the shop.  Each one contributes his 
stone to the edifice; and, his task accomplished, disappears.  Eternity 
precedes us, eternity follows us: between two infinites, of what account 
is one poor mortal that the century should inquire about him? 
</p> 
<p>Disregard then, reader, my title and my character, and attend only 
to my arguments.  It is in accordance with universal consent that I 
undertake to correct universal error; from the <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi> of 
the human race I appeal to its <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>.  Have the courage to 
follow me; and, if your will is untrammelled, if your conscience is free, 
if your mind can unite two propositions and deduce a third therefrom, 
my ideas will inevitably become yours.  In beginning by giving you my 
last word, it was my purpose to warn you, not to defy you; for I am 
certain that, if you read me, you will be compelled to assent.  The things 
of which I am to speak are so simple and clear that you will be 
astonished at not having perceived them before, and you will say:  
&ldquo;I have neglected to think.&rdquo;  Others offer you the 
spectacle of genius wresting Nature's secrets from her, and unfolding 
before you her sublime messages; you will find here only a series of 
experiments upon <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">right</hi> a sort of 
verification of the weights and measures of your conscience.  The 
operations shall be conducted under your very eyes; and you shall weigh 
the result.

examiner; a philosopher whose business is to seek the truth. 
</p> 
  
 
<pb n="14"/>  
<p>Nevertheless, I build no system.  I ask an end to privilege, the 
abolition of slavery, equality of rights, and the reign of law.  Justice, 
nothing else; that is the alpha and omega of my argument: to others I 
leave the business of governing the world. 
</p><p>One day I asked myself:  Why is there so much sorrow and misery 
in society?  Must man always be wretched?  And not satisfied with the 
explanations given by the reformers, &mdash; these attributing the general 
distress to governmental cowardice and incapacity, those to conspirators 
and <hi rend="italic">&eacute;meutes</hi>, still others to ignorance and general 
corruption, &mdash; and weary of the interminable quarrels of the tribune and 
the press, I sought to fathom the matter myself.  I have consulted the 
masters of science; I have read a hundred volumes of philosophy, law, 
political economy, and history: would to God that I had lived in a 
century in which so much reading had been useless!  I have made every 
effort to obtain exact information, comparing doctrines, replying to 
objections, continually constructing equations and reductions from 
arguments, and weighing thousands of syllogisms in the scales of the 
most rigorous logic.  In this laborious work, I have collected many 
interesting facts which I shall share with my friends and the public as 
soon as I have leisure.  But I must say that I recognized at once that we 
had never understood the meaning of these words, so common and yet so 
sacred:  <hi rend="italic">Justice, equity, liberty;</hi> that concerning each of 
these principles our ideas have been utterly obscure; and, in fact, that 
this ignorance was the sole cause, both of the poverty that devours us, 
and of all the calamities that have ever afflicted the human race. 
</p> 
<p>My mind was frightened by this strange result:  I doubted my 
reason.  What! said I, that which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor 
insight penetrated, you have discovered!   
<pb n="15"/> Wretch, mistake not the visions of your diseased brain 
for the truths of science!  Do you not know (great philosophers have said 
so) that in points of practical morality universal error is a contradiction? 
</p> 
<p>I resolved then to test my arguments; and in entering upon this 
new labor I sought an answer to the following questions:  Is it possible 
that humanity can have been so long and so universally mistaken in the 
application of moral principles?  How and why could it be mistaken?  
How can its error, being universal, be capable of correction? 
</p> 
<p>These questions, on the solution of which depended the certainty of 
my conclusions, offered no lengthy resistance to analysis.  It will be 
seen, in chapter V. of this work, that in morals, as in all other branches 
of knowledge, the gravest errors are the dogmas of science; that, even in 
works of justice, to be mistaken is a privilege which ennobles man; and 
that whatever philosophical merit may attach to me is infinitely small.  
To name a thing is easy: the difficulty is to discern it before its 
appearance.  In giving expression to the last stage of an idea, &mdash; an idea 
which permeates all minds, which to-morrow will be proclaimed by 
another if I fail to announce it to-day, &mdash; I can claim no merit save that 
of priority of utterance.  Do we eulogize the man who first perceives the 
dawn? 
</p> 
<p>Yes: all men believe and repeat that equality of conditions is 
identical with equality of rights; that <hi rend="italic">property</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">robbery</hi> are synonymous terms; that every social advantage 
accorded, or rather usurped, in the name of superior talent or service, is 
iniquity and extortion.  All men in their hearts, I say, bear witness to 
these truths; they need only to be made to understand it. 
</p> 
<p>Before entering directly upon the question before me, I must 
 
<pb n="16"/> say a word of the road that I shall traverse.  When 
Pascal approached a geometrical problem, he invented a method of 
solution; to solve a problem in philosophy a method is equally necessary.  
Well, by how much do the problems of which philosophy treats surpass 
in the gravity of their results those discussed by geometry!  How much 
more imperatively, then, do they demand for their solution a profound 
and rigorous analysis! 
</p> 
<p>It is a fact placed for ever beyond doubt, say the modern 
psychologists, that every perception received by the mind is determined 
by certain general laws which govern the mind; is moulded, so to speak, 
in certain types pre-existing in our understanding, and which constitutes 
its original condition.  Hence, say they, if the mind has no innate 
<hi rend="italic">ideas</hi>, it has at least innate <hi rend="italic">forms</hi>.  Thus, for 
example, every phenomenon is of necessity conceived by us as 
happening in <hi rend="italic">time</hi> and <hi rend="italic">space</hi>, &mdash; that compels 
us to infer a <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of its occurrence; every thing which 
exists implies the ideas of <hi rend="italic">substance, mode, relation, number, 
&amp;c.;</hi> in a word, we form no idea which is not related to some 
one of the general principles of reason, independent of which nothing 
exists. 
</p> 
<p>These axioms of the understanding, add the psychologists, these 
fundamental types, by which all our judgments and ideas are inevitably 
shaped, and which our sensations serve only to illuminate, are known in 
the schools as <hi rend="italic">categories</hi>.  Their primordial existence in 
the mind is to-day demonstrated; they need only to be systematized and 
catalogued.  Aristotle recognized ten; Kant increased the number to 
fifteen; M. Cousin has reduced it to three, to two, to one; and the 
indisputable glory of this professor will be due to the fact that, if he has 
not discovered the true theory of categories, he has, at least, seen more 
clearly than any one else the vast importance of this  
<pb n="17"/> question, &mdash; the greatest and perhaps the only one with 
which metaphysics has to deal. 
</p> 
<p>I confess that I disbelieve in the innateness, not only of 
<hi rend="italic">ideas</hi>, but also of <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">laws</hi> of our understanding; and I hold the metaphysics of 
Reid and Kant to be still farther removed from the truth than that of 
Aristotle.  However, as I do not wish to enter here into a discussion of 
the mind, a task which would demand much labor and be of no interest 
to the public, I shall admit the hypothesis that our most general and most 
necessary ideas &mdash; such as time, space, substance, and cause &mdash; exist 
originally in the mind; or, at least, are derived immediately from its 
constitution. 
</p> 
<p>But it is a psychological fact none the less true, and one to which 
the philosophers have paid too little attention, that habit, like a second 
nature, has the power of fixing in the mind new categorical forms 
derived from the appearances which impress us, and by them usually 
stripped of objective reality, but whose influence over our judgments is 
no less predetermining than that of the original categories.  Hence we 
reason by the <hi rend="italic">eternal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> laws of 
our mind, and at the same time by the secondary rules, ordinarily faulty, 
which are suggested to us by imperfect observation.  This is the most 
fecund source of false prejudices, and the permanent and often invincible 
cause of a multitude of errors.  The bias resulting from these prejudices 
is so strong that often, even when we are fighting against a principle 
which our mind thinks false, which is repugnant to our reason, and 
which our conscience disapproves, we defend it without knowing it, we 
reason in accordance with it, and we obey it while attacking it.  Enclosed 
within a circle, our mind revolves about itself, until a new observation, 
creating within us new ideas, brings to view an external principle which 
delivers us from the phantom by which our imagination is possessed. 
 
<pb n="18"/>  
</p> 
<p>Thus, we know to-day that, by the laws of a universal magnetism 
whose cause is still unknown, two bodies (no obstacle intervening) tend 
to unite by an accelerated impelling force which we call 
<hi rend="italic">gravitation</hi>.  It is gravitation which causes unsupported 
bodies to fall to the ground, which gives them weight, and which fastens 
us to the earth on which we live.  Ignorance of this cause was the sole 
obstacle which prevented the ancients from believing in the antipodes.  
&ldquo;Can you not see,&rdquo; said St. Augustine after Lactantius, 
&ldquo;that, if there were men under our feet, their heads would point 
downward, and that they would fall into the sky?&rdquo;  The bishop of 
Hippo, who thought the earth flat because it appeared so to the eye, 
supposed in consequence that, if we should connect by straight lines the 
zenith with the nadir in different places, these lines would be parallel 
with each other; and in the direction of these lines he traced every 
movement from above to below.  Thence he naturally concluded that the 
stars were rolling torches set in the vault of the sky; that, if left to 
themselves, they would fall to the earth in a shower of fire; that the 
earth was one vast plain, forming the lower portion of the world, &amp;c.  If 
he had been asked by what the world itself was sustained, he would have 
answered that he did not know, but that to God nothing is impossible.  
Such were the ideas of St. Augustine in regard to space and movement, 
ideas fixed within him by a prejudice derived from an appearance, and 
which had become with him a general and categorical rule of judgment.  
Of the reason why bodies fall his mind knew nothing; he could only say 
that a body falls because it falls. 
</p> 
<p>With us the idea of a fall is more complex: to the general ideas of 
space and movement which it implies, we add that of attraction or 
direction towards a centre, which gives us the higher idea of cause.  But 
if physics has fully corrected our judgment  
<pb n="19"/> in this respect, we still make use of the prejudice of St. 
Augustine; and when we say that a thing has <hi rend="italic">fallen</hi>, we do 
not mean simply and in general that there has been an effect of 
gravitation, but specially and in particular that it is towards the earth, 
and <hi rend="italic">from above to below</hi>, that this movement has taken 
place.  Our mind is enlightened in vain; the imagination prevails, and 
our language remains forever incorrigible.  To <hi rend="italic">descend from 
heaven</hi> is as incorrect an expression as to <hi rend="italic">mount to 
heaven;</hi> and yet this expression will live as long as men use 
language. 
</p> 
<p>All these phrases &mdash; <hi rend="italic">from above to below; to descend from 
heaven; to fall from the clouds, &amp;c.</hi> &mdash; are henceforth harmless, 
because we know how to rectify them in practice; but let us deign to 
consider for a moment how much they have retarded the progress of 
science.  If, indeed, it be a matter of little importance to statistics, 
mechanics, hydrodynamics, and ballistics, that the true cause of the fall 
of bodies should be known, and that our ideas of the general movements 
in space should be exact, it is quite otherwise when we undertake to 
explain the system of the universe, the cause of tides, the shape of the 
earth, and its position in the heavens: to understand these things we must 
leave the circle of appearances.  In all ages there have been ingenious 
mechanicians, excellent architects, skilful artillerymen: any error, into 
which it was possible for them to fall in regard to the rotundity of the 
earth and gravitation, in no wise retarded the development of their art; 
the solidity of their buildings and accuracy of their aim was not affected 
by it.  But sooner or later they were forced to grapple with phenomena, 
which the supposed parallelism of all perpendiculars erected from the 
earth's surface rendered inexplicable: then also commenced a struggle 
between the prejudices, which for centuries had sufficed in daily 
practice, and the unpre 
 
<pb n="20"/>  
cedented opinions which the testimony of the eyes seemed to contradict. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, on the one hand, the falsest judgments, whether based on 
isolated facts or only on appearances, always embrace some truths whose 
sphere, whether large or small, affords room for a certain number of 
inferences, beyond which we fall into absurdity.  The ideas of St. 
Augustine, for example, contained the following truths: that bodies fall 
towards the earth, that they fall in a straight line, that either the sun or 
the earth moves, that either the sky or the earth turns, &amp;c.  These 
general facts always have been true; our science has added nothing to 
them.  But, on the other hand, it being necessary to account for every 
thing, we are obliged to seek for principles more and more 
comprehensive: that is why we have had to abandon successively, first 
the opinion that the world was flat, then the theory which regards it as 
the stationary centre of the universe, &amp;c. 
</p> 
<p>If we pass now from physical nature to the moral world, we still 
find ourselves subject to the same deceptions of appearance, to the same 
influences of spontaneity and habit.  But the distinguishing feature of this 
second division of our knowledge is, on the one hand, the good or the 
evil which we derive from our opinions; and, on the other, the obstinacy 
with which we defend the prejudice which is tormenting and killing us. 
</p> 
<p>Whatever theory we embrace in regard to the shape of the earth 
and the cause of its weight, the physics of the globe does not suffer; and, 
as for us, our social economy can derive therefrom neither profit nor 
damage.  But it is in us and through us that the laws of our moral nature 
work; now, these laws cannot be executed without our deliberate aid, 
and, consequently, unless we know them.  If, then, our science of  
 
<pb n="21"/>  
moral laws is false, it is evident that, while desiring our own good, we 
are accomplishing our own evil; if it is only incomplete, it may suffice 
for a time for our social progress, but in the long run it will lead us into 
a wrong road, and will finally precipitate us into an abyss of calamities. 
</p> 
<p>Then it is that we need to exercise our highest judgments; and, be 
it said to our glory, they are never found wanting: but then also 
commences a furious struggle between old prejudices and new ideas.  
Days of conflagration and anguish!  We are told of the time when, with 
the same beliefs, with the same institutions, all the world seemed happy: 
why complain of these beliefs; why banish these institutions?  We are 
slow to admit that that happy age served the precise purpose of 
developing the principle of evil which lay dormant in society; we accuse 
men and gods, the powers of earth and the forces of Nature.  Instead of 
seeking the cause of the evil in his mind and heart, man blames his 
masters, his rivals, his neighbors, and himself; nations arm themselves, 
and slay and exterminate each other, until equilibrium is restored by the 
vast depopulation, and peace again arises from the ashes of the 
combatants.  So loath is humanity to touch the customs of its ancestors, 
and to change the laws framed by the founders of communities, and 
confirmed by the faithful observance of the ages. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est</hi>:  Distrust all 
innovations, wrote Titus Livius.  Undoubtedly it would be better were 
man not compelled to change: but what! because he is born ignorant, 
because he exists only on condition of gradual self-instruction, must he 
abjure the light, abdicate his reason, and abandon himself to fortune?  
Perfect health is better than convalescence: should the sick man, 
therefore, refuse to be cured?  Reform, reform! cried, ages since, John 
the Bap 
 
<pb n="22"/>  
tist and Jesus Christ.  Reform, reform! cried our fathers, fifty years ago; 
and for a long time to come we shall shout, Reform, reform! 
</p> 
<p>Seeing the misery of my age, I said to myself:  Among the 
principles that support society, there is one which it does not understand, 
which its ignorance has vitiated, and which causes all the evil that exists.  
This principle is the most ancient of all; for it is a characteristic of 
revolutions to tear down the most modern principles, and to respect those 
of long-standing.  Now the evil by which we suffer is anterior to all 
revolutions.  This principle, impaired by our ignorance, is honored and 
cherished; for if it were not cherished it would harm nobody, it would be 
without influence. 
</p> 
<p>But this principle, right in its purpose, but misunderstood: this 
principle, as old as humanity, what is it?  Can it be religion? 
</p> 
<p>All men believe in God: this dogma belongs at once to their 
conscience and their mind.  To humanity God is a fact as primitive, an 
idea as inevitable, a principle as necessary as are the categorical ideas of 
cause, substance, time, and space to our understanding.  God is proven 
to us by the conscience prior to any inference of the mind; just as the 
sun is proven to us by the testimony of the senses prior to all the 
arguments of physics.  We discover phenomena and laws by observation 
and experience; only this deeper sense reveals to us existence.  Humanity 
believes that God is; but, in believing in God, what does it believe?  In a 
word, what is God? 
</p> 
<p>The nature of this notion of Divinity, &mdash; this primitive, universal 
notion, born in the race, &mdash; the human mind has not yet fathomed.  At 
each step that we take in our investigation of Nature and of causes, the 
idea of God is extended and  
 
<pb n="23"/>  
exalted; the farther science advances, the more God seems to grow and 
broaden.  Anthropomorphism and idolatry constituted of necessity the 
faith of the mind in its youth, the theology of infancy and poesy.  A 
harmless error, if they had not endeavored to make it a rule of conduct, 
and if they had been wise enough to respect the liberty of thought.  But 
having made God in his own image, man wished to appropriate him still 
farther; not satisfied with disfiguring the Almighty, he treated him as his 
patrimony, his goods, his possessions.  God, pictured in monstrous 
forms, became throughout the world the property of man and of the 
State.  Such was the origin of the corruption of morals by religion, and 
the source of pious feuds and holy wars.  Thank Heaven! we have 
learned to allow every one his own beliefs; we seek for moral laws 
outside the pale of religion.  Instead of legislating as to the nature and 
attributes of God, the dogmas of theology, and the destiny of our souls, 
we wisely wait for science to tell us what to reject and what to accept.  
God, soul, religion, &mdash; eternal objects of our unwearied thought and our 
most fatal aberrations, terrible problems whose solution, for ever 
attempted, for ever remains unaccomplished, &mdash; concerning all these 
questions we may still be mistaken, but at least our error is harmless.  
With liberty in religion, and the separation of the spiritual from the 
temporal power, the influence of religious ideas upon the progress of 
society is purely negative; no law, no political or civil institution being 
founded on religion.  Neglect of duties imposed by religion may increase 
the general corruption, but it is not the primary cause; it is only an 
auxiliary or result.  It is universally admitted, and especially in the 
matter which now engages our attention, that the cause of the inequality 
of conditions among men &mdash; of pauperism, of universal misery, and of 
gov 
 
<pb n="24"/>  
ernmental embarrassments &mdash; can no longer be traced to religion: we 
must go farther back, and dig still deeper. 
</p> 
<p>But what is there in man older and deeper than the religious 
sentiment? 
</p> 
<p>There is man himself; that is, volition and conscience, free-will 
and law, eternally antagonistic.  Man is at war with himself: why? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; say the theologians, &ldquo;transgressed in 
the beginning; our race is guilty of an ancient offence.  For this 
transgression humanity has fallen; error and ignorance have become its 
sustenance.  Read history, you will find universal proof of this necessity 
for evil in the permanent misery of nations.  Man suffers and always will 
suffer; his disease is hereditary and constitutional.  Use palliatives, 
employ emollients; there is no remedy.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Nor is this argument peculiar to the theologians; we find it 
expressed in equivalent language in the philosophical writings of the 
materialists, believers in infinite perfectibility.  Destutt de Tracy teaches 
formally that poverty, crime, and war are the inevitable conditions of our 
social state; necessary evils, against which it would be folly to revolt.  
So, call it <hi rend="italic">necessity of evil</hi> or <hi rend="italic">original 
depravity</hi>, it is at bottom the same philosophy. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The first man transgressed.&rdquo;  If the votaries of the 
Bible interpreted it faithfully, they would say: <hi rend="italic">man originally 
transgressed</hi>, that is, made a mistake; for <hi rend="italic">to transgress, to 
fail, to make a mistake</hi>, all mean the same thing. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The consequences of Adam's transgression are inherited 
by the race; the first is ignorance.&rdquo;  Truly, the race, like the 
individual, is born ignorant; but, in regard to a multitude of questions, 
even in the moral and political spheres, this ignorance of the race has 
been dispelled: who says that it will  
 
<pb n="25"/>  
not depart altogether?  Mankind makes continual progress toward truth, 
and light ever triumphs over darkness.  Our disease is not, then, 
absolutely incurable, and the theory of the theologians is worse than 
inadequate; it is ridiculous, since it is reducible to this tautology:  
&ldquo;Man errs, because he errs.&rdquo;  While the true statement is 
this:  &ldquo;Man errs, because he learns.&rdquo;  Now, if man 
arrives at a knowledge of all that he needs to know, it is reasonable to 
believe that, ceasing to err, he will cease to suffer. 
</p> 
<p>But if we question the doctors as to this law, said to be engraved 
upon the heart of man, we shall immediately see that they dispute about 
a matter of which they know nothing; that, concerning the most 
important questions, there are almost as many opinions as authors; that 
we find no two agreeing as to the best form of government, the principle 
of authority, and the nature of right; that all sail hap-hazard upon a 
shoreless and bottomless sea, abandoned to the guidance of their private 
opinions which they modestly take to be right reason.  And, in view of 
this medley of contradictory opinions, we say:  &ldquo;The object of 
our investigations is the law, the determination of the social principle.  
Now, the politicians, that is, the social scientists, do not understand each 
other; then the error lies in themselves; and, as every error has a reality 
for its object, we must look in their books to find the truth which they 
have unconsciously deposited there.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Now, of what do the lawyers and the publicists treat?  Of 
<hi rend="italic">justice, equity, liberty, natural law, civil laws</hi>, &amp;c.  But 
what is justice?  What is its principle, its character, its formula?  To this 
question our doctors evidently have no reply; for otherwise their science, 
starting with a principle clear and well defined, would quit the region of 
probabilities, and all disputes would end. 
 
 
<pb n="26"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>What is justice?  The theologians answer:  &ldquo;All justice 
comes from God.&rdquo;  That is true; but we know no more than 
before. 
</p> 
<p>The philosophers ought to be better informed: they have argued so 
much about justice and injustice!  Unhappily, an examination proves that 
their knowledge amounts to nothing, and that with them &mdash; as with the 
savages whose every prayer to the sun is simply <hi rend="italic">O!  O!</hi> &mdash; 
it is a cry of admiration, love, and enthusiasm; but who does not know 
that the sun attaches little meaning to the interjection O!  That is exactly 
our position toward the philosophers in regard to justice.  Justice, they 
say, is a <hi rend="italic">daughter of Heaven; a light which illumines every man 
that comes into the world; the most beautiful prerogative of our nature; 
that which distinguishes us from the beasts and likens us to God</hi> --and a thousand other similar things.  What, I ask, does this pious litany 
amount to?  To the prayer of the savages:  O! 
</p> 
<p>All the most reasonable teachings of human wisdom concerning 
justice are summed up in that famous adage:  <hi rend="italic">Do unto others that 
which you would that others should do unto you; Do not unto others that 
which you would not that others should do unto you</hi>.  But this 
rule of moral practice is unscientific: what have I a right to wish that 
others should do or not do to me?  It is of no use to tell me that my duty 
is equal to my right, unless I am told at the same time what my right is. 
</p> 
<p>Let us try to arrive at something more precise and positive. 
</p> 
<p>Justice is the central star which governs societies, the pole around 
which the political world revolves, the principle and the regulator of all 
transactions.  Nothing takes place between men save in the name of 
<hi rend="italic">right;</hi> nothing without the invocation of justice.  Justice is 
not the work of the law: on  
 
<pb n="27"/>  
the contrary, the law is only a declaration and application of 
<hi rend="italic">justice</hi> in all circumstances where men are liable to come 
in contact.  If, then, the idea that we form of justice and right were ill-defined, if it were imperfect or even false, it is clear that all our 
legislative applications would be wrong, our institutions vicious, our 
politics erroneous: consequently there would be disorder and social 
chaos. 
</p> 
<p>This hypothesis of the perversion of justice in our minds, and, as a 
necessary result, in our acts, becomes a demonstrated fact when it is 
shown that the opinions of men have not borne a constant relation to the 
notion of justice and its applications; that at different periods they have 
undergone modifications: in a word, that there has been progress in 
ideas.  Now, that is what history proves by the most overwhelming 
testimony. 
</p> 
<p>Eighteen Hundred years ago, the world, under the rule of the 
C&aelig;sars, exhausted itself in slavery, superstition, and 
voluptuousness.  The people &mdash; intoxicated and, as it were, stupefied by 
their long-continued orgies &mdash; had lost the very notion of right and duty: 
war and dissipation by turns swept them away; usury and the labor of 
machines (that is of slaves), by depriving them of the means of 
subsistence, hindered them from continuing the species.  Barbarism 
sprang up again, in a hideous form, from this mass of corruption, and 
spread like a devouring leprosy over the depopulated provinces.  The 
wise foresaw the downfall of the empire, but could devise no remedy.  
What could they think indeed?  To save this old society it would have 
been necessary to change the objects of public esteem and veneration, 
and to abolish the rights affirmed by a justice purely secular; they said:  
&ldquo;Rome has conquered through her politics and her gods; any 
change in theology and public opinion would be folly and sacrilege.   
 
<pb n="28"/>  
Rome, merciful toward conquered nations, though binding them in 
chains, spared their lives; slaves are the most fertile source of her 
wealth; freedom of the nations would be the negation of her rights and 
the ruin of her finances.  Rome, in fact, enveloped in the pleasures and 
gorged with the spoils of the universe, is kept alive by victory and 
government; her luxury and her pleasures are the price of her conquests: 
she can neither abdicate nor dispossess herself.&rdquo;  Thus Rome had 
the facts and the law on her side.  Her pretensions were justified by 
universal custom and the law of nations.  Her institutions were based 
upon idolatry in religion, slavery in the State, and epicurism in private 
life; to touch those was to shake society to its foundations, and, to use 
our modern expression, to open the abyss of revolutions.  So the idea 
occurred to no one; and yet humanity was dying in blood and luxury. 
</p> 
<p>All at once a man appeared, calling himself <hi rend="italic">The Word of 
God</hi>.  It is not known to this day who he was, whence he came, 
nor what suggested to him his ideas.  He went about proclaiming 
everywhere that the end of the existing society was at hand, that the 
world was about to experience a new birth; that the priests were vipers, 
the lawyers ignoramuses, an I the philosophers hypocrites and liars; that 
master and slave were equals, that usury and every thing akin to it was 
robbery, that proprietors and idlers would one day burn, while the poor 
and pure in heart would find a haven of peace. 
</p> 
<p>This man &mdash; <hi rend="italic">The Word of God</hi> &mdash; was denounced and 
arrested as a public enemy by the priests and the lawyers, who well 
understood how to induce the people to demand his death.  But this 
judicial murder, though it put the finishing stroke to their crimes, did not 
destroy the doctrinal seeds which <hi rend="italic">The  
 
<pb n="29"/>  
Word of God</hi> had sown.  After his death, his original disciples 
travelled about in all directions, preaching what they called the 
<hi rend="italic">good news</hi>, creating in their turn millions of missionaries; 
and, when their task seemed to be accomplished, dying by the sword of 
Roman justice.  This persistent agitation, the war of the executioners and 
martyrs, lasted nearly three centuries, ending in the conversion of the 
world.  Idolatry was destroyed, slavery abolished, dissolution made room 
for a more austere morality, and the contempt for wealth was sometimes 
pushed almost to privation.  Society was saved by the negation of its 
own principles, by a revolution in its religion, and by violation of its 
most sacred rights.  In this revolution, the idea of justice spread to an 
extent that had not before been dreamed of, never to return to its original 
limits.  Heretofore justice had existed only for the masters;[1] it then 
commenced to exist for the slaves. 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the new religion at that time had borne by no means 
all its fruits.  There was a perceptible improvement of the public morals, 
and a partial release from oppression; but, other than that, the 
<hi rend="italic">seeds sown by the Son of Man</hi>, having fallen into 
idolatrous hearts, had produced nothing save innumerable discords and a 
quasi-poetical mythology.  Instead of developing into their practical 
consequences the principles of morality and government taught by 
<hi rend="italic">The Word of God</hi>, his followers busied themselves in 
speculations as to his birth, his origin, his person, and his actions; they 
discussed his parables, and from the conflict of the most extravagant 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] Religion, laws, marriage, were the privileges of freemen, and, 
in the beginning, of nobles only.  <hi rend="italic">Dii majorum gentium</hi> &mdash; 
gods of the patrician families; <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> &mdash; right of 
nations; that is, of families or nobles.  The slave and the plebeian had no 
families; their children were treated as the offspring of animals.  
<hi rend="italic">Beasts</hi> they were born, <hi rend="italic">beasts</hi> they must live. 
 
 
 
<pb n="30"/>  
opinions upon unanswerable questions and texts which no one 
understood, was born <hi rend="italic">theology</hi>, &mdash; which may be defined 
as the <hi rend="italic">science of the infinitely absurd</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The truth of <hi rend="italic">Christianity</hi> did not survive the age of 
the apostles; the <hi rend="italic">Gospel</hi>, commented upon and symbolized 
by the Greeks and Latins, loaded with pagan fables, became literally a 
mass of contradictions; and to this day the reign of the <hi rend="italic">infallible 
Church</hi> has been a long era of darkness.  It is said that the 
<hi rend="italic">gates of hell</hi> will not always prevail, that <hi rend="italic">The Word 
of God</hi> will return, and that one day men will know truth and 
justice; but that will be the death of Greek and Roman Catholicism, just 
as in the light of science disappeared the caprices of opinion. 
</p> 
<p>The monsters which the successors of the apostles were bent on 
destroying, frightened for a moment, reappeared gradually, thanks to the 
crazy fanaticism, and sometimes the deliberate connivance, of priests and 
theologians.  The history of the enfranchisement of the French 
communes offers constantly the spectacle of the ideas of justice and 
liberty spreading among the people, in spite of the combined efforts of 
kings, nobles, and clergy.  In the year 1789 of the Christian era, the 
French nation, divided by caste, poor and oppressed, struggled in the 
triple net of royal absolutism, the tyranny of nobles and parliaments, and 
priestly intolerance.  There was the right of the king and the right of the 
priest, the right of the patrician and the right of the plebeian; there were 
the privileges of birth, province, communes, corporations, and trades; 
and, at the bottom of all, violence, immorality, and misery.  For some 
time they talked of reformation; those who apparently desired it most 
favoring it only for their own profit, and the people who were to be the 
gainers expecting little and saying nothing.  For a long time these poor 
 
<pb n="31"/>  
people, either from distrust, incredulity, or despair, hesitated to ask for 
their rights: it is said that the habit of serving had taken the courage 
away from those old communes, which in the middle ages were so bold. 
</p> 
<p>Finally a book appeared, summing up the whole matter in these 
two propositions:  <hi rend="italic">What is thee third estate? &mdash; Nothing.  What 
ought it to be? &mdash; Every thing</hi>.  Some one added by way of 
comment:  <hi rend="italic">What is the king? &mdash; The servant of the people.</hi> 
</p> 
<p>This was a sudden revelation: the veil was torn aside, a thick 
bandage fell from all eyes.  The people commenced to reason thus: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>If the king is our servant, he ought to report to us; 
</p> 
<p>If he ought to report to us, he is subject to control; 
</p> 
<p>If he can be controlled, he is responsible; 
</p> 
<p>If he is responsible, he is punishable;

<p>Five years after the publication of the <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi> of 
Siey&egrave;s, the third estate was every thing; the king, the nobility, 
the clergy, were no more.  In 1793, the nation, without stopping at the 
constitutional fiction of the inviolability of the sovereign, conducted 
Louis XVI. to the scaffold; in 1830, it accompanied Charles X. to 
Cherbourg.  In each case, it may have erred, in fact, in its judgment of 
the offence; but, in right, the logic which led to its action was 
irreproachable.  The people, in punishing their sovereign, did precisely 
that which the government of July was so severely censured for failing to 
do when it refused to execute Louis Bonaparte after the affair of 
Strasburg: they struck the true culprit.  It was an applica 
<pb n="32"/>  
tion of the common law, a solemn decree of justice enforcing the penal 
laws.[1] 
</p> 
<p>The spirit which gave rise to the movement of '89 was a spirit of 
negation; that, of itself, proves that the order of things which was 
substituted for the old system was not methodical or well-considered; 
that, born of anger and hatred, it could not have the effect of a science 
based on observation and study; that its foundations, in a word, were not 
derived from a profound knowledge of the laws of Nature and society.  
Thus the people found that the republic, among the so-called new 
institutions, was acting on the very principles against which they had 
fought, and was swayed by all the prejudices which they had intended to 
destroy.  We congratulate ourselves, with inconsiderate enthusiasm, on 
the glorious French Revolution, the regeneration of 1789, the great 
changes that have been effected, and the reversion of institutions: a 
delusion, a delusion! 
</p> 
<p>When our ideas on any subject, material, intellectual, or social, 
undergo a thorough change in consequence of new observations, I call 
that movement of the mind <hi rend="italic">revolution</hi>.  If the ideas are 
simply extended or modified, there is only <hi rend="italic">progress</hi>.  Thus 
the system of Ptolemy was a step in astronomical progress, that of 
Copernicus was a revolution.  So, in 1789, there was struggle and 
progress; revolution there was none.  An examination of the reforms 
which were attempted proves this. 
</p> 
<p>The nation, so long a victim of monarchical selfishness, 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] If the chief of the executive power is responsible, so must the 
deputies be also.  It is astonishing that this idea has never occurred to 
any one; it might be made the subject of an interesting essay.  But I 
declare that I would not, for all the world, maintain it; the people are yet 
much too logical for me to furnish them with arguments. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="33"/>  
thought to deliver itself for ever by declaring that it alone was sovereign.  
But what was monarchy?  The sovereignty of one man.  What is 
democracy?  The sovereignty of the nation, or, rather, of the national 
majority.  But it is, in both cases, the sovereignty of man instead of the 
sovereignty of the law, the sovereignty of the will instead of the 
sovereignty of the reason; in one word, the passions instead of justice.  
Undoubtedly, when a nation passes from the monarchical to the 
democratic state, there is progress, because in multiplying the sovereigns 
we increase the opportunities of the reason to substitute itself for the 
will; but in reality there is no revolution in the government, since the 
principle remains the same.  Now, we have the proof to-day that, with 
the most perfect democracy, we cannot be free.[1] 
</p> 
<p>Nor is that all.  The nation-king cannot exercise its sovereignty 
itself; it is obliged to delegate it to agents: this is constantly reiterated by 
those who seek to win its favor.  Be these agents five, ten, one hundred, 
or a thousand, of what consequence is the number; and what matters the 
name?  It is always the government of man, the rule of will and caprice.  
I ask what this pretended revolution has revolutionized? 
</p> 
<p>We know, too, how this sovereignty was exercised; first by the 
Convention, then by the Directory, afterwards confiscated by the Consul.  
As for the Emperor, the strong man so much adored and mourned by the 
nation, he never wanted to be dependent on it; but, as if intending to set 
its sovereignty at defiance, he dared to demand its suffrage: that is, its 
abdica- 
 
[1]  See De Tocqueville, &ldquo;Democracy in the United 
States;&rdquo; and Michel Chevalier, &ldquo;Letters on North 
America.&rdquo;  Plutarch tells us, &ldquo;Life of Pericles,&rdquo; 
that in Athens honest people were obliged to conceal themselves while 
studying, fearing they would be regarded as aspirants for office. 
 
 
 
<pb n="34"/>  
tion, the abdication of this inalienable sovereignty; and he obtained it. 
</p> 
<p>But what is sovereignty?  It is, they say, the <hi rend="italic">power to make 
laws</hi>.[1]  Another absurdity, a relic of despotism.  The nation had 
long seen kings issuing their commands in this form: <hi rend="italic">for such is 
our pleasure;</hi> it wished to taste in its turn the pleasure of making 
laws.  For fifty years it has brought them forth by myriads; always, be it 
understood, through the agency of representatives.  The play is far from 
ended. 
</p> 
<p>The definition of sovereignty was derived from the definition of 
the law.  The law, they said, is <hi rend="italic">the expression of the will of the 
sovereign:</hi> then, under a monarchy, the law is the expression of 
the will of the king; in a republic, the law is the expression of the will of 
the people.  Aside from the difference in the number of wills, the two 
systems are exactly identical: both share the same error, namely, that the 
law is the expression of a will; it ought to be the expression of a fact.  
Moreover they followed good leaders: they took the citizen of Geneva 
for their prophet, and the <hi rend="italic">contrat social</hi> for their Koran. 
</p> 
<p>Bias and prejudice are apparent in all the phrases of the new 
legislators.  The nation had suffered from a multitude of exclusions and 
privileges; its representatives issued the following declaration:  <hi rend="italic">All 
men are equal by nature and before the law</hi>; an ambiguous and 
redundant declaration.  <hi rend="italic">Men are equal by nature:</hi> does that 
mean that they are equal in size, beauty, talents, and virtue?  No; they 
meant, then, political and civil equality.  Then it would have been 
sufficient to have said:  <hi rend="italic">All men are equal before the law</hi>. 
 
 
[1] &ldquo;Sovereignty,&rdquo; according to Toullier, &ldquo;is 
human omnipotence.&rdquo;  A materialistic definition: if sovereignty is 
any thing, it is a <hi rend="italic">right</hi> not a <hi rend="italic">force</hi> or a 
faculty.  And what is human omnipotence? 
 
 
 
<pb n="35"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>But what is equality before the law?  Neither the constitution of 
1790, nor that of '93, nor the granted charter, nor the accepted charter, 
have defined it accurately.  All imply an inequality in fortune and station 
incompatible with even a shadow of equality in rights.  In this respect it 
may be said that all our constitutions have been faithful expressions of 
the popular will:  I am going, to prove it. 
</p> 
<p>Formerly the people were excluded from civil and military offices; 
it was considered a wonder when the following high-sounding article was 
inserted in the Declaration of Rights:  &ldquo;All citizens are equally 
eligible to office; free nations know no qualifications in their choice of 
officers save virtues and talents.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>They certainly ought to have admired so beautiful an idea: they 
admired a piece of nonsense.  Why! the sovereign people, legislators, 
and reformers, see in public offices, to speak plainly, only opportunities 
for pecuniary advancement.  And, because it regards them as a source of 
profit, it decrees the eligibility of citizens.  For of what use would this 
precaution be, if there were nothing to gain by it?  No one would think 
of ordaining that none but astronomers and geographers should be pilots, 
nor of prohibiting stutterers from acting at the theatre and the opera.  
The nation was still aping the kings: like them it wished to award the 
lucrative positions to its friends and flatterers.  Unfortunately, and this 
last feature completes the resemblance, the nation did not control the list 
of livings; that was in the hands of its agents and representatives.  They, 
on the other hand, took care not to thwart the will of their gracious 
sovereign. 
</p> 
<p>This edifying article of the Declaration of Rights, retained in the 
charters of 1814 and 1830, implies several kinds of civil inequality; that 
is, of inequality before the law: inequality of  
<pb n="36"/>  
station, since the public functions are sought only for the consideration 
and emoluments which they bring; inequality of wealth, since, if it had 
been desired to equalize fortunes, public service would have been 
regarded as a duty, not as a reward; inequality of privilege, the law not 
stating what it means by <hi rend="italic">talents</hi> and <hi rend="italic">virtues.</hi>  
Under the empire, virtue and talent consisted simply in military bravery 
and devotion to the emperor; that was shown when Napoleon created his 
nobility, and attempted to connect it with the ancients.  To-day, the man 
who pays taxes to the amount of two hundred francs is virtuous; the 
talented man is the honest pickpocket: such truths as these are accounted 
trivial. 
</p> 
<p>The people finally legalized property.  God forgive them, for they 
knew not what they did!  For fifty years they have suffered for their 
miserable folly.  But how came the people, whose voice, they tell us, is 
the voice of God, and whose conscience is infallible, &mdash; how came the 
people to err?  How happens it that, when seeking liberty and equality, 
they fell back into privilege and slavery?  Always through copying the 
ancient <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Formerly, the nobility and the clergy contributed towards the 
expenses of the State only by voluntary aid and gratuitous gift; their 
property could not be seized even for debt, &mdash; while the plebeian, 
overwhelmed by taxes and statute-labor, was continually tormented, now 
by the king's tax-gatherers, now by those of the nobles and clergy.  He 
whose possessions were subject to mortmain could neither bequeath nor 
inherit property; he was treated like the animals, whose services and 
offspring belong to their master by right of accession.  The people 
wanted the conditions of <hi rend="italic">ownership</hi> to be alike for all; they 
thought that every one should <hi rend="italic">enjoy and freely dispose of his 
possessions his income and the fruit of his labor and in-<pb n="37"/>  
dustry</hi>.  The people did not invent property; but as they had not 
the same privileges in regard to it, which the nobles and clergy 
possessed, they decreed that the right should be exercised by all under 
the same conditions.  The more obnoxious forms of property &mdash; statute-labor, mortmain, <hi rend="italic">ma&icirc;trise</hi>, and exclusion from 
public office &mdash; have disappeared; the conditions of its enjoyment have 
been modified: the principle still remains the same.  There has been 
progress in the regulation of the right; there has been no revolution. 
</p> 
<p>These, then, are the three fundamental principles of modern 
society, established one after another by the movements of 1789 and 
1830:  1. <hi rend="italic">Sovereignty of the human will;</hi> in short, 
<hi rend="italic">despotism</hi>.  2. <hi rend="italic">Inequality of wealth and rank</hi>.  
3. <hi rend="italic">Property</hi> &mdash; above JUSTICE, always invoked as the 
guardian angel of sovereigns, nobles, and proprietors; JUSTICE, the 
general, primitive, categorical law of all society. 
</p> 
<p>We must ascertain whether the ideas of <hi rend="italic">despotism, civil 
inequality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">property</hi>, are in harmony with the 
primitive notion of <hi rend="italic">justice</hi>, and necessarily follow from it, 
&mdash; assuming various forms according to the condition, position, and 
relation of persons; or whether they are not rather the illegitimate result 
of a confusion of different things, a fatal association of ideas.  And since 
justice deals especially with the questions of government, the condition 
of persons, and the possession of things, we must ascertain under what 
conditions, judging by universal opinion and the progress of the human 
mind, government is just, the condition of citizens is just, and the 
possession of things is just; then, striking out every thing which fails to 
meet these conditions, the result will at once tell us what legitimate 
government is, what the legitimate condition of citizens is, and what the 
legitimate possession of things is; and finally, as the last result of the 
analysis, what <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> is. 
 
<pb n="38"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Is the authority of man over man just? 
</p> 
<p>Everybody answers, &ldquo;No; the authority of man is only the 
authority of the law, which ought to be justice and truth.&rdquo;  The 
private will counts for nothing in government, which consists, first, in 
discovering truth and justice in order to make the law; and, second, in 
superintending the execution of this law.  I do not now inquire whether 
our constitutional form of government satisfies these conditions; whether, 
for example, the will of the ministry never influences the declaration and 
interpretation of the law; or whether our deputies, in their debates, are 
more intent on conquering by argument than by force of numbers: it is 
enough for me that my definition of a good government is allowed to be 
correct.  This idea is exact.  Yet we see that nothing seems more just to 
the Oriental nations than the despotism of their sovereigns; that, with the 
ancients and in the opinion of the philosophers themselves, slavery was 
just; that in the middle ages the nobles, the priests, and the bishops felt 
justified in holding slaves; that Louis XIV. thought that he was right 
when he said, &ldquo;The State!  I am the State;&rdquo; and that 
Napoleon deemed it a crime for the State to oppose his will.  The idea of 
justice, then, applied to sovereignty and government, has not always 
been what it is to-day; it has gone on developing and shaping itself by 
degrees, until it has arrived at its present state.  But has it reached its 
last phase?  I think not: only, as the last obstacle to be overcome arises 
from the institution of property which we have kept intact, in order to 
finish the reform in government and consummate the revolution, this 
very institution we must attack. 
</p> 
<p>Is political and civil inequality just? 
</p> 
<p>Some say yes; others no.  To the first I would reply that, when the 
people abolished all privileges of birth and caste,  
<pb n="39"/>  
they did it, in all probability, because it was for their advantage; why 
then do they favor the privileges of fortune more than those of rank and 
race?  Because, say they, political inequality is a result of property; and 
without property society is impossible: thus the question just raised 
becomes a question of property.  To the second I content myself with 
this remark:  If you wish to enjoy political equality, abolish property; 
otherwise, why do you complain? 
</p> 
<p>Is property just? 
</p> 
<p>Everybody answers without hesitation, &ldquo;Yes, property is 
just.&rdquo;  I say everybody, for up to the present time no one who 
thoroughly understood the meaning of his words has answered no.  For 
it is no easy thing to reply understandingly to such a question; only time 
and experience can furnish an answer.  Now, this answer is given; it is 
for us to understand it.  I undertake to prove it. 
</p> 
<p>We are to proceed with the demonstration in the following order: --</p> 
<p>I. We dispute not at all, we refute nobody, we deny nothing; we 
accept as sound all the arguments alleged in favor of property, and 
confine ourselves to a search for its principle, in order that we may then 
ascertain whether this principle is faithfully expressed by property.  In 
fact, property being defensible on no ground save that of justice, the 
idea, or at least the intention, of justice must of necessity underlie all the 
arguments that have been made in defence of property; and, as on the 
other hand the right of property is only exercised over those things 
which can be appreciated by the senses, justice, secretly objectifying 
itself, so to speak, must take the shape of an algebraic formula.  By this 
method of investigation, we soon see that every argument which has 
been invented in behalf of property, <hi rend="italic">whatever it may be</hi>,  
 
<pb n="40"/>  
always and of necessity leads to equality; that is, to the negation of 
property. 
</p> 
<p>The first part covers two chapters: one treating of occupation, the 
foundation of our right; the other, of labor and talent, considered as 
causes of property and social inequality. 
</p> 
<p>The first of these chapters will prove that the right of occupation 
<hi rend="italic">obstructs</hi> property; the second that the right of labor 
<hi rend="italic">destroys</hi> it. 
</p> 
<p>II. Property, then, being of necessity conceived as existing only in 
connection with equality, it remains to find out why, in spite of this 
necessity of logic, equality does not exist.  This new investigation also 
covers two chapters: in the first, considering the fact of property in 
itself, we inquire whether this fact is real, whether it exists, whether it is 
possible; for it would imply a contradiction, were these two opposite 
forms of society, equality and inequality, both possible.  Then we 
discover, singularly enough, that property may indeed manifest itself 
accidentally; but that, as an institution and principle, it is mathematically 
impossible.  So that the axiom of the school &mdash; <hi rend="italic">ab actu ad posse 
valet consecutio:</hi> from the actual to the possible the inference is 
good &mdash; is given the lie as far as property is concerned. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, in the last chapter, calling psychology to our aid, and 
probing man's nature to the bottom, we shall disclose the principle of 
<hi rend="italic">justice</hi> &mdash; its formula and character; we shall state with 
precision the organic law of society; we shall explain the origin of 
property, the causes of its establishment, its long life, and its 
approaching death; we shall definitively establish its identity with 
robbery.  And, after having shown that these three prejudices &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">the sovereignty of man, the inequality of conditions, and 
property</hi> &mdash; are one and the same; that they may be taken for each 
other, and are reciprocally  
<pb n="41"/>  
convertible, &mdash; we shall have no trouble in inferring therefrom, by the 
principle of contradiction, the basis of government and right.  There our 
investigations will end, reserving the right to continue them in future 
works. 
</p> 
<p>The importance of the subject which engages our attention is 
recognized by all minds. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Property,&rdquo; says M. Hennequin, &ldquo;is the 
creative and conservative principle of civil society.  Property is one of 
those basic institutions, new theories concerning which cannot be 
presented too soon; for it must not be forgotten, and the publicist and 
statesman must know, that on the answer to the question whether 
property is the principle or the result of social order, whether it is to be 
considered as a cause or an effect, depends all morality, and, 
consequently, all the authority of human institutions.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>These words are a challenge to all men of hope and faith; but, 
although the cause of equality is a noble one, no one has yet picked up 
the gauntlet thrown down by the advocates of property; no one has been 
courageous enough to enter upon the struggle.  The spurious learning of 
haughty jurisprudence, and the absurd aphorisms of a political economy 
controlled by property have puzzled the most generous minds; it is a sort 
of password among the most influential friends of liberty and the 
interests of the people that <hi rend="italic">equality is a chimera!</hi>  So many 
false theories and meaningless analogies influence minds otherwise keen, 
but which are unconsciously controlled by popular prejudice.  Equality 
advances every day &mdash; <hi rend="italic">fit aequalitas</hi>.  Soldiers of liberty, 
shall we desert our flag in the hour of triumph? 
</p> 
<p>A defender of equality, I shall speak without bitterness and without 
anger; with the independence becoming a philosopher, with the courage 
and firmness of a free man.  May I, in this momentous struggle, carry 
into all hearts the light with which I am filled; and show, by the success 
of my argument, that equality failed to conquer by the sword only that it 
might conquer by the pen!

CHAPTER II. <lb/> 
PROPERTY CONSIDERED AS A NATURAL RIGHT. &mdash; 
OCCUPATION 
AND CIVIL LAW AS EFFICIENT BASES OF PROPERTY. 
DEFINITIONS. 
</head> 
<p> 
The Roman law defined property as the right to use and abuse one's own 
within the limits of the law &mdash; <hi rend="italic">jus utendi et abutendi re su&acirc;, 
guatenus juris ratio patitur</hi>.  A justification of the word 
<hi rend="italic">abuse</hi> has been attempted, on the ground that it signifies, 
not senseless and immoral abuse, but only absolute domain.  Vain 
distinction! invented as an excuse for property, and powerless against the 
frenzy of possession, which it neither prevents nor represses.  The 
proprietor may, if he chooses, allow his crops to rot under foot; sow his 
field with salt; milk his cows on the sand; change his vineyard into a 
desert, and use his vegetable-garden as a park: do these things constitute 
abuse, or not?  In the matter of property, use and abuse are necessarily 
indistinguishable. 
</p> 
<p>According to the Declaration of Rights, published as a preface to 
the Constitution of '93, property is &ldquo;the right to enjoy and 
dispose at will of one's goods, one's income, and the fruit of one's labor 
and industry.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Code Napol&eacute;on, article 544:  &ldquo;Property is the right 
to enjoy and dispose of things in the most absolute manner, provided we 
do not overstep the limits prescribed by the laws and 
regulations.&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="43"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>These two definitions do not differ from that of the Roman law: all 
give the proprietor an absolute right over a thing; and as for the 
restriction imposed by the code, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">provided we do not overstep 
the limits prescribed by the laws and regulations</hi>, &mdash; its object is 
not to limit property, but to prevent the domain of one proprietor from 
interfering with that of another.  That is a confirmation of the principle, 
not a limitation of it. 
</p> 
<p>There are different kinds of property:  1. Property pure and 
simple, the dominant and seigniorial power over a thing; or, as they term 
it, <hi rend="italic">naked property</hi>.  2. <hi rend="italic">Possession</hi>.  
&ldquo;Possession,&rdquo; says Duranton, &ldquo;is a matter of fact, 
not of right.&rdquo;  Toullier:  &ldquo;Property is a right, a legal 
power; possession is a fact.&rdquo;  The tenant, the farmer, the 
<hi rend="italic">commandit&eacute;</hi>, the usufructuary, are possessors; the 
owner who lets and lends for use, the heir who is to come into 
possession on the death of a usufructuary, are proprietors.  If I may 
venture the comparison: a lover is a possessor, a husband is a proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>This double definition of property &mdash; domain and possession  &mdash; is 
of the highest importance; and it must be clearly understood, in order to 
comprehend what is to follow. 
</p> 
<p>From the distinction between possession and property arise two 
sorts of rights: the <hi rend="italic">jus in re</hi>, the right in a thing, the right 
by which I may reclaim the property which I have acquired, in whatever 
hands I find it; and the <hi rend="italic">jus ad rem</hi>, the right 
<hi rend="italic">to</hi> a thing, which gives me a claim to become a proprietor.  
Thus the right of the partners to a marriage over each other's person is 
the <hi rend="italic">jus in re</hi>; that of two who are betrothed is only the 
<hi rend="italic">jus ad rem</hi>.  In the first, possession and property are 
united; the second includes only naked property.  With me who, as a 
laborer, have a right to the possession of the products of Nature and my 
own industry, &mdash; and who, as a <pb n="44"/> 
proletaire, enjoy none of them, &mdash; it is by virtue of the <hi rend="italic">jus ad 
rem</hi> that I demand admittance to the <hi rend="italic">jus in re</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This distinction between the <hi rend="italic">jus in re</hi> and the 
<hi rend="italic">jus ad rem</hi> is the basis of the famous distinction between 
<hi rend="italic">possessoire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">petitoire</hi>, &mdash; actual categories 
of jurisprudence, the whole of which is included within their vast 
boundaries.  <hi rend="italic">Petitoire</hi> refers to every thing relating to 
property; <hi rend="italic">possessoire</hi> to that relating to possession.  In 
writing this memoir against property, I bring against universal society an 
<hi rend="italic">action petitoire:</hi>  I prove that those who do not possess to-day are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess; but, 
instead of inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all, I 
demand, in the name of general security, its entire abolition.  If I fail to 
win my case, there is nothing left for us (the proletarian class and 
myself) but to cut our throats: we can ask nothing more from the justice 
of nations; for, as the code of procedure (art 26) tells us in its energetic 
style, <hi rend="italic">the plaintiff who has been non-suited in an action petitoire, 
is debarred thereby from bringing an action possessoire</hi>.  If, on 
the contrary, I gain the case, we must then commence an <hi rend="italic">action 
possessoire</hi>, that we may be reinstated in the enjoyment of the 
wealth of which we are deprived by property.  I hope that we shall not 
be forced to that extremity; but these two actions cannot be prosecuted at 
once, such a course being prohibited by the same code of procedure. 
</p> 
<p>Before going to the heart of the question, it will not be useless to 
offer a few preliminary remarks. 
 
&sect; 1. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Property as a Natural Right</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The Declaration of Rights has placed property in its list of the 
natural and inalienable rights of man, four in all: <hi rend="italic">liberty, equality, 
property, security</hi>.  What rule did the legislators of  
<pb n="45"/>  
'93 follow in compiling this list?  None.  They laid down principles, just 
as they discussed sovereignty and the laws; from a general point of view, 
and according to their own opinion.  They did every thing in their own 
blind way. 
</p> 
<p>If we can believe Toullier:  &ldquo;The absolute rights can be 
reduced to three: <hi rend="italic">security, liberty, property</hi>.&rdquo;  
Equality is eliminated by the Rennes professor; why?  Is it because 
<hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> implies it, or because property prohibits it?  On this 
point the author of &ldquo;Droit Civil Expliqu&eacute;&rdquo; is 
silent: it has not even occurred to him that the matter is under 
discussion. 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, if we compare these three or four rights with each 
other, we find that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others; 
that for the majority of citizens it exists only potentially, and as a 
dormant faculty without exercise; that for the others, who do enjoy it, it 
is susceptible of certain transactions and modifications which do not 
harmonize with the idea of a natural right; that, in practice, 
governments, tribunals, and laws do not respect it; and finally that 
everybody, spontaneously and with one voice, regards it as chimerical. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is inviolable.  I can neither sell nor alienate my liberty; 
every contract, every condition of a contract, which has in view the 
alienation or suspension of liberty, is null: the slave, when he plants his 
foot upon the soil of liberty, at that moment becomes a free man.  When 
society seizes a malefactor and deprives him of his liberty, it is a case of 
legitimate defence: whoever violates the social compact by the 
commission of a crime declares himself a public enemy; in attacking the 
liberty of others, he compels them to take away his own.  Liberty is the 
original condition of man; to renounce liberty is to renounce the nature 
of man: after that, how could we perform the acts of man? 
</p> 
<p>Likewise, equality before the law suffers neither restriction 
 
<pb n="46"/>  
nor exception.  All Frenchmen are equally eligible to office: 
consequently, in the presence of this equality, condition and family have, 
in many cases, no influence upon choice.  The poorest citizen can obtain 
judgment in the courts against one occupying the most exalted station.  
Let the millionaire, Ahab, build a ch&acirc;teau upon the vineyard of 
Naboth: the court will have the power, according to the circumstances, 
to order the destruction of the ch&acirc;teau, though it has cost millions; 
and to force the trespasser to restore the vineyard to its original state, 
and pay the damages.  The law wishes all property, that has been 
legitimately acquired, to be kept inviolate without regard to value, and 
without respect for persons. 
</p> 
<p>The charter demands, it is true, for the exercise of certain political 
rights, certain conditions of fortune and capacity; but all publicists know 
that the legislator's intention was not to establish a privilege, but to take 
security.  Provided the conditions fixed by law are complied with, every 
citizen may be an elector, and every elector eligible.  The right, once 
acquired, is the same for all; the law compares neither persons nor 
votes.  I do not ask now whether this system is the best; it is enough 
that, in the opinion of the charter and in the eyes of every one, equality 
before the law is absolute, and, like liberty, admits of no compromise. 
</p> 
<p>It is the same with the right of security.  Society promises its 
members no half-way protection, no sham defence; it binds itself to them 
as they bind themselves to it.  It does not say to them, &ldquo;I will 
shield you, provided it costs me nothing; I will protect you, if I run no 
risks thereby.&rdquo;  It says, &ldquo;I will defend you against 
everybody; I will save and avenge you, or perish myself.&rdquo;  The 
whole strength of the State is at the service of each citizen; the obligation 
which binds them together is absolute. 
 
<pb n="47"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>How different with property!  Worshipped by all, it is 
acknowledged by none: laws, morals, customs, public and private 
conscience, all plot its death and ruin. 
</p> 
<p>To meet the expenses of government, which has armies to support, 
tasks to perform, and officers to pay, taxes are needed.  Let all 
contribute to these expenses: nothing more just.  But why should the rich 
pay more than the poor?  That is just, they say, because they possess 
more.  I confess that such justice is beyond my comprehension. 
</p> 
<p>Why are taxes paid?  To protect all in the exercise of their natural 
rights &mdash; liberty, equality, security, and property; to maintain order in the 
State; to furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences. 
</p> 
<p>Now, does it cost more to defend the rich man's life and liberty 
than the poor man's?  Who, in time of invasion, famine, or plague, 
causes more trouble, &mdash; the large proprietor who escapes the evil without 
the assistance of the State, or the laborer who sits in his cottage 
unprotected from danger? 
</p> 
<p>Is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen, or by the 
artisan and journeyman?  Why, the police have more to fear from a few 
hundred laborers, out of work, than from two hundred thousand electors! 
</p> 
<p>Does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the 
poor man national festivities, clean streets, and beautiful monuments?  
Why, he prefers his country-seat to all the popular pleasures; and when 
he wants to enjoy himself, he does not wait for the greased pole! 
</p> 
<p>One of two things is true: either the proportional tax affords 
greater security to the larger tax-payers, or else it is a wrong.  Because, 
if property is a natural right, as the Declaration of '93 declares, all that 
belongs to me by virtue of this right is as sacred as my person; it is my 
blood, my life,  
<pb n="48"/>  
myself: whoever touches it offends the apple of my eye.  My income of 
one hundred thousand francs is as inviolable as the grisette's daily wage 
of seventy-five centimes; her attic is no more sacred than my suite of 
apartments.  The tax is not levied in proportion to strength, size, or 
skill: no more should it be levied in proportion to property. 
</p> 
<p>If, then, the State takes more from me, let it give me more in 
return, or cease to talk of equality of rights; for otherwise, society is 
established, not to defend property, but to destroy it.  The State, through 
the proportional tax, becomes the chief of robbers; the State sets the 
example of systematic pillage: the State should be brought to the bar of 
justice at the head of those hideous brigands, that execrable mob which it 
now kills from motives of professional jealousy. 
</p> 
<p>But, they say, the courts and the police force are established to 
restrain this mob; government is a company, not exactly for insurance, 
for it does not insure, but for vengeance and repression.  The premium 
which this company exacts, the tax, is divided in proportion to property; 
that is, in proportion to the trouble which each piece of property 
occasions the avengers and repressers paid by the government. 
</p> 
<p>This is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property.  
Under this system the poor and the rich distrust, and make war upon, 
each other.  But what is the object of the war?  Property.  So that 
property is necessarily accompanied by war upon property.  The liberty 
and security of the rich do not suffer from the liberty and security of the 
poor; far from that, they mutually strengthen and sustain each other.  
The rich man's right of property, on the contrary, has to be continually 
defended against the poor man's desire for property.  What a 
contradiction!  In England they have a poor-rate: they wish me to pay 
 
<pb n="49"/>  
this tax.  But what relation exists between my natural and inalienable 
right of property and the hunger from which ten million wretched people 
are suffering?  When religion commands us to assist our fellows, it 
speaks in the name of charity, not in the name of law.  The obligation of 
benevolence, imposed upon me by Christian morality, cannot be imposed 
upon me as a political tax for the benefit of any person or poor-house.  I 
will give alms when I see fit to do so, when the sufferings of others 
excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk, and in which I do 
not believe: I will not be forced to bestow them.  No one is obliged to 
do more than comply with this injunction:  <hi rend="italic">In the exercise of your 
own rights do not encroach upon the rights of another</hi>; an 
injunction which is the exact definition of liberty.  Now, my possessions 
are my own; no one has a claim upon them: I object to the placing of the 
third theological virtue in the order of the day. 
</p> 
<p>Everybody, in France, demands the conversion of the five per 
cent. bonds; they demand thereby the complete sacrifice of one species 
of property.  They have the right to do it, if public necessity requires it; 
but where is the just indemnity promised by the charter?  Not only does 
none exist, but this indemnity is not even possible; for, if the indemnity 
were equal to the property sacrificed, the conversion would be useless. 
</p> 
<p>The State occupies the same position to-day toward the 
bondholders that the city of Calais did, when besieged by Edward III., 
toward its notables.  The English conqueror consented to spare its 
inhabitants, provided it would surrender to him its most distinguished 
citizens to do with as he pleased.  Eustache and several others offered 
themselves; it was noble in them, and our ministers should recommend 
<pb n="50"/>their example to the bondholders.  But had the city the right to 
surrender them?  Assuredly not.  The right to security is absolute; the 
country can require no one to sacrifice himself.  The soldier standing 
guard within the enemy's range is no exception to this rule.  Wherever a 
citizen stands guard, the country stands guard with him: to-day it is the 
turn of the one, to-morrow of the other.  When danger and devotion are 
common, flight is parricide.  No one has the right to flee from danger; 
no one can serve as a scapegoat.  The maxim of Caiaphas &mdash; <hi rend="italic">it is 
right that a man should die for his nation</hi> &mdash; is that of the 
populace and of tyrants; the two extremes of social degradation. 
</p> 
<p>It is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable.  
This maxim of civil law, applied to the State, is good for those who wish 
to return to the natural equality of labor and wealth; but, from the point 
of view of the proprietor, and in the mouth of conversionists, it is the 
language of bankrupts.  The State is not only a borrower, it is an insurer 
and guardian of property; granting the best of security, it assures the 
most inviolable possession.  How, then, can it force open the hands of 
its creditors, who have confidence in it, and then talk to them of public 
order and security of property?  The State, in such an operation, is not a 
debtor who discharges his debt; it is a stock-company which allures its 
stockholders into a trap, and there, contrary to its authentic promise, 
exacts from them twenty, thirty, or forty per cent. of the interest on their 
capital. 
</p> 
<p>That is not all.  The State is a university of citizens joined together 
under a common law by an act of society.  This act secures all in the 
possession of their property; guarantees to one his field, to another his 
vineyard, to a third his rents, and to the bondholder, who might have 
bought real <pb n="51"/>estate but who preferred to come to the assistance of 
the treasury, his bonds.  The State cannot demand, without offering an 
equivalent, the sacrifice of an acre of the field or a corner of the 
vineyard; still less can it lower rents: why should it have the right to 
diminish the interest on bonds?  This right could not justly exist, unless 
the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal advantage; but 
being confined to the State, where can he find a place to invest them, 
since the cause of conversion, that is, the power to borrow to better 
advantage, lies in the State?  That is why a government, based on the 
principle of property, cannot redeem its annuities without the consent of 
their holders.  The money deposited with the republic is property which 
it has no right to touch while other kinds of property are respected; to 
force their redemption is to violate the social contract, and outlaw the 
bondholders. 
</p> 
<p>The whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds finally 
reduces itself to this: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Question</hi>.  Is it just to reduce to misery forty-five 
thousand families who derive an income from their bonds of one hundred 
francs or less? 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Answer</hi>.  Is it just to compel seven or eight millions 
of tax-payers to pay a tax of five francs, when they should pay only 
three?  It is clear, in the first place, that the reply is in reality no reply; 
but, to make the wrong more apparent, let us change it thus: Is it just to 
endanger the lives of one hundred thousand men, when we can save 
them by surrendering one hundred heads to the enemy?  Reader, decide! 
</p> 
<p>All this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present 
system.  Yet, nevertheless, sooner or later, the conversion will be 
effected and property be violated, because no other <pb n="52"/>course is 
possible; because property, regarded as a right, and not being a right, 
must of right perish; because the force of events, the laws of conscience, 
and physical and mathematical necessity must, in the end, destroy this 
illusion of our minds. 
</p> 
<p>To sum up: liberty is an absolute right, because it is to man what 
impenetrability is to matter, &mdash; a <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of existence; 
equality is an absolute right, because without equality there is no society; 
security is an absolute right, because in the eyes of every man his own 
liberty and life are as precious as another's.  These three rights are 
absolute; that is, susceptible of neither increase nor diminution; because 
in society each associate receives as much as he gives, &mdash; liberty for 
liberty, equality for equality, security for security, body for body, soul 
for soul, in life and in death. 
</p> 
<p>But property, in its derivative sense, and by the definitions of law, 
is a right outside of society; for it is clear that, if the wealth of each was 
social wealth, the conditions would be equal for all, and it would be a 
contradiction to say:  <hi rend="italic">Property is a man's right to dispose at will 
of social property</hi>.  Then if we are associated for the sake of 
liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated for the sake of 
property; then if property is a <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> right, this natural 
right is not <hi rend="italic">social</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">anti-social</hi>.  Property 
and society are utterly irreconcilable institutions.  It is as impossible to 
associate two proprietors as to join two magnets by their opposite poles.  
Either society must perish, or it must destroy property. 
</p> 
<p>If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable 
right, why, in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its 
origin? &mdash; for this is one of its distinguishing characteristics.  The origin 
of a natural right!  Good God! who ever inquired into the origin of the 
rights of liberty, security, or equality?  They exist by the same right that 
<pb n="53"/>we exist; they are born with us, they live and die with us.  With 
property it is very different, indeed.  By law, property can exist without 
a proprietor, like a quality without a subject.  It exists for the human 
being who as yet is not, and for the octogenarian who is no more.  And 
yet, in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor of the eternal 
and the infinite, they have never found the origin of property; the 
doctors still disagree.  On one point only are they in harmony: namely, 
that the validity of the right of property depends upon the authenticity of 
its origin.  But this harmony is their condemnation.  Why have they 
acknowledged the right before settling the question of origin? 
</p> 
<p>Certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles 
to property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history.  They wish 
to hold to this proposition: that property is a fact; that it always has 
been, and always will be.  With that proposition the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> 
Proudhon[1] commenced his &ldquo;Treatise on the Right of 
Usufruct,&rdquo; regarding the origin of property as a useless question.  
Perhaps I would subscribe to this doctrine, believing it inspired by a 
commendable love of peace, were all my fellow-citizens in comfortable 
circumstances; but, no!  I will not subscribe to it. 
</p> 
<p>The titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are 
two in number: <hi rend="italic">occupation</hi> and <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>.  I 
shall examine them successively, under all their aspects and in detail; 
and I remind the reader that, to whatever authority we appeal, I shall 
prove beyond a doubt that property, to be just and possible, must 
necessarily have equality for its condition. 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] The Proudhon here referred to is J. B. V. Proudhon; a 
distinguished French jurist, and distant relative of the Translator. 
 
 
<pb n="54"/>
&sect; <hi rend="italic">2. &mdash; Occupation, as the Title to Property</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>It is remarkable that, at those meetings of the State Council at 
which the Code was discussed, no controversy arose as to the origin and 
principle of property.  All the articles of Vol.  II., Book 2, concerning 
property and the right of accession, were passed without opposition or 
amendment.  Bonaparte, who on other questions had given his legists so 
much trouble, had nothing to say about property.  Be not surprised at it: 
in the eyes of that man, the most selfish and wilful person that ever 
lived, property was the first of rights, just as submission to authority was 
the most holy of duties. 
</p> 
<p>The right of <hi rend="italic">occupation</hi>, or of the <hi rend="italic">first 
occupant</hi>, is that which results from the actual, physical, real 
possession of a thing.  I occupy a piece of land; the presumption is, that 
I am the proprietor, until the contrary is proved.  We know that 
originally such a right cannot be legitimate unless it is reciprocal; the 
jurists say as much. 
</p> 
<p>Cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre:  <hi rend="italic">Quemadmodum 
theatrum cum commune sit, recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum 
quem quisque occuparit</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the 
origin of property. 
</p> 
<p>The theatre, says Cicero, is common to all; nevertheless, the place 
that each one occupies is called <hi rend="italic">his own</hi>; that is, it is a 
place <hi rend="italic">possessed</hi>, not a place <hi rend="italic">appropriated</hi>.  
This comparison annihilates property; moreover, it implies equality.  
Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit, another 
in the boxes, and a third in the gallery?  Not unless I have three bodies, 
like Geryon, or can exist in different places at the same time, as is 
related of the magician Apollonius. 
<pb n="55"/>
</p> 
<p>According to Cicero, no one has a right to more than he needs: 
such is the true interpretation of his famous axiom &mdash;  <hi rend="italic">suum 
quidque cujusque sit</hi>, to each one that which belongs to him &mdash; an 
axiom that has been strangely applied.  That which belongs to each is not 
that which each <hi rend="italic">may</hi> possess, but that which each 
<hi rend="italic">has a right</hi> to possess.  Now, what have we a right to 
possess?  That which is required for our labor and consumption; Cicero's 
comparison of the earth to a theatre proves it.  According to that, each 
one may take what place he will, may beautify and adorn it, if he can; it 
is allowable: but he must never allow himself to overstep the limit which 
separates him from another.  The doctrine of Cicero leads directly to 
equality; for, occupation being pure toleration, if the toleration is mutual 
(and it cannot be otherwise) the possessions are equal. 
</p> 
<p>Grotius rushes into history; but what kind of reasoning is that 
which seeks the origin of a right, said to be natural, elsewhere than in 
Nature?  This is the method of the ancients: the fact exists, then it is 
necessary, then it is just, then its antecedents are just also.  Nevertheless, 
let us look into it. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Originally, all things were common and undivided; they 
were the property of all.&rdquo;  Let us go no farther.  Grotius tells us 
how this original communism came to an end through ambition and 
cupidity; how the age of gold was followed by the age of iron, &amp;c.  So 
that property rested first on war and conquest, then on treaties and 
agreements.  But either these treaties and agreements distributed wealth 
equally, as did the original communism (the only method of distribution 
with which the barbarians were acquainted, and the only form of justice 
of which they could conceive; and then the question of origin assumes 
this form: how did equality afterwards disappear?) &mdash; or else these 
treaties and agreements were forced <pb n="56"/>by the strong upon the weak, 
and in that case they are null; the tacit consent of posterity does not 
make them valid, and we live in a permanent condition of iniquity and 
fraud. 
</p> 
<p>We never can conceive how the equality of conditions, having once 
existed, could afterwards have passed away.  What was the cause of such 
degeneration?  The instincts of the animals are unchangeable, as well as 
the differences of species; to suppose original equality in human society 
is to admit by implication that the present inequality is a degeneration 
from the nature of this society, &mdash; a thing which the defenders of 
property cannot explain.  But I infer therefrom that, if Providence placed 
the first human beings in a condition of equality, it was an indication of 
its desires, a model that it wished them to realize in other forms; just as 
the religious sentiment, which it planted in their hearts, has developed 
and manifested itself in various ways.  Man has but one nature, constant 
and unalterable: he pursues it through instinct, he wanders from it 
through reflection, he returns to it through judgment; who shall say that 
we are not returning now?  According to Grotius, man has abandoned 
equality; according to me, he will yet return to it.  How came he to 
abandon it?  Why will he return to it?  These are questions for future 
consideration. 
</p> 
<p>Reid writes as follows: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The right of property is not innate, but acquired.  It is not 
grounded upon the constitution of man, but upon his actions.  Writers on 
jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy 
every man of common understanding. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The earth is given to men in common for the purposes of 
life, by the bounty of Heaven.  But to divide it, and appropriate one part 
of its produce to one, another part to another, must be the work of men 
who have power and understanding given them, by which every man 
may accommodate himself, <hi rend="italic">without hurt to any other</hi>. 
<pb n="57"/> 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This common right of every man to what the earth 
produces, before it be occupied and appropriated by others, was, by 
ancient moralists, very properly compared to the right which every 
citizen had to the public theatre, where every man that came might 
occupy an empty seat, and thereby acquire a right to it while the 
entertainment lasted; but no man had a right to dispossess another. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The earth is a great theatre, furnished by the Almighty, 
with perfect wisdom and goodness, for the entertainment and 
employment of all mankind.  Here every man has a right to 
accommodate himself as a spectator, and to perform his part as an actor; 
but without hurt to others.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Consequences of Reid's doctrine. 
</p> 
<p>1.  That the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no 
one, it must be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be 
shared, divided by the number of those who are to share it; 
</p> 
<p>2.  The number of places being of necessity equal at all times to 
that of the spectators, no spectator can occupy two places, nor can any 
actor play several parts; 
</p> 
<p>3.  Whenever a spectator comes in or goes out, the places of all 
contract or enlarge correspondingly: for, says Reid, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">the 
right of property is not innate, but acquired</hi>;&rdquo; 
consequently, it is not absolute; consequently, the occupancy on which it 
is based, being a conditional fact, cannot endow this right with a stability 
which it does not possess itself.  This seems to have been the thought of 
the Edinburgh professor when he added: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A right to life implies a right to the necessary means of 
life; and that justice, which forbids the taking away the life of an 
innocent man, forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means 
of life.  He has the same right to defend the one as the other.  To hinder 
another man's innocent labor, or to deprive him of the fruit of it, is an 
injustice of the same kind, and has the same effect as to put him in 
fetters or in prison, and is equally a just object of resentment.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Thus the chief of the Scotch school, without considering at 
<pb n="58"/>all the inequality of skill or labor, posits <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> 
the equality of the means of labor, abandoning thereafter to each laborer 
the care of his own person, after the eternal axiom:  <hi rend="italic">Whoso does 
well, shall fare well</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The philosopher Reid is lacking, not in knowledge of the principle, 
but in courage to pursue it to its ultimate.  If the right of life is equal, 
the right of labor is equal, and so is the right of occupancy.  Would it 
not be criminal, were some islanders to repulse, in the name of property, 
the unfortunate victims of a shipwreck struggling to reach the shore?  
The very idea of such cruelty sickens the imagination.  The proprietor, 
like Robinson Crusoe on his island, wards off with pike and musket the 
proletaire washed overboard by the wave of civilization, and seeking to 
gain a foothold upon the rocks of property.  &ldquo;Give me 
work!&rdquo; cries he with all his might to the proprietor: 
&ldquo;don't drive me away, I will work for you at any price.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;I do not need your services,&rdquo; replies the proprietor, 
showing the end of his pike or the barrel of his gun.  &ldquo;Lower my 
rent at least.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I need my income to live upon.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;How can I pay you, when I can get no work?&rdquo;  
&ldquo;That is your business.&rdquo;  Then the unfortunate proletaire 
abandons himself to the waves; or, if he attempts to land upon the shore 
of property, the proprietor takes aim, and kills him. 
</p> 
<p>We have just listened to a spiritualist; we will now question a 
materialist, then an eclectic: and having completed the circle of 
philosophy, we will turn next to law. 
</p> 
<p>According to Destutt de Tracy, property is a necessity of our 
nature.  That this necessity involves unpleasant consequences, it would 
be folly to deny.  But these consequences are necessary evils which do 
not invalidate the principle; so that it as unreasonable to rebel against 
property on account of the abuses which it generates, as to complain of 
life be<pb n="59"/>cause it is sure to end in death.  This brutal and pitiless 
philosophy promises at least frank and close reasoning.  Let us see if it 
keeps its promise. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We talk very gravely about the conditions of 
property, . . . as if it was our province to decide what constitutes 
property. . . .  It would seem, to hear certain philosophers and 
legislators, that at a certain moment, spontaneously and without cause, 
people began to use the words <hi rend="italic">thine</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">mine;</hi> and that they might have, or ought to have, 
dispensed with them.  But <hi rend="italic">thine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> 
were never invented.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>A philosopher yourself, you are too realistic.  <hi rend="italic">Thine</hi> 
and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> do not necessarily refer to self, as they do when 
I say your philosophy, and my equality; for your philosophy is you 
philosophizing, and my equality is I professing equality.  
<hi rend="italic">Thine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> oftener indicate a relation, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> country, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> parish, 
<hi rend="italic">your</hi> tailor, <hi rend="italic">your</hi> milkmaid; 
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> chamber, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> seat at the theatre, 
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> company and <hi rend="italic">my</hi> battalion in the 
National Guard.  In the former sense, we may sometimes say 
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> labor, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> skill, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> virtue; 
never <hi rend="italic">my</hi> grandeur nor <hi rend="italic">my</hi> majesty: in the 
latter sense only, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> field, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> house, 
<hi rend="italic">my</hi> vineyard, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> capital, &mdash; precisely as the 
banker's clerk says <hi rend="italic">my</hi> cash-box.  In short, 
<hi rend="italic">thine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> are signs and expressions of 
personal, but equal, rights; applied to things outside of us, they indicate 
possession, function, use, not property. 
</p> 
<p>It does not seem possible, but, nevertheless, I shall prove, by 
quotations, that the whole theory of our author is based upon this paltry 
equivocation. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Prior to all covenants, men are, not exactly, as Hobbes 
says, in a state of <hi rend="italic">hostility</hi>, but of 
<hi rend="italic">estrangement</hi>.  In this state, justice and injustice are 
unknown; the rights of one bear no relation to the rights of another.  All 
have as many rights as needs, and all feel it their duty to satisfy those 
needs by any means at their command.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Grant it; whether true or false, it matters not.  Destutt de Tracy 
cannot escape equality.  On this theory, men, while in  <pb n="60"/>a state of 
<hi rend="italic">estrangement</hi>, are under no obligations to each other; they 
all have the right to satisfy their needs without regard to the needs of 
others, and consequently the right to exercise their power over Nature, 
each according to his strength and ability.  That involves the greatest 
inequality of wealth.  Inequality of conditions, then, is the characteristic 
feature of estrangement or barbarism: the exact opposite of Rousseau's 
idea.  But let us look farther: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the 
time when covenants, either implied or expressed, are agreed upon.  
Then appears for the first time justice and injustice; that is, the balance 
between the rights of one and the rights of another, which up to that time 
were necessarily equal.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Listen: <hi rend="italic">rights were equal</hi>; that means that each 
individual had the right to <hi rend="italic">satisfy his needs without reference to 
the needs of others</hi>.  In other words, that all had the right to 
injure each other; that there was no right save force and cunning.  They 
injured each other, not only by war and pillage, but also by usurpation 
and appropriation.  Now, in order to abolish this equal right to use force 
and stratagem, &mdash; this equal right to do evil, the sole source of the 
inequality of benefits and injuries, &mdash; they commenced to make 
<hi rend="italic">covenants either implied or expressed</hi>, and established a 
balance.  Then these agreements and this balance were intended to secure 
to all equal comfort; then, by the law of contradictions, if isolation is the 
principle of inequality, society must produce equality.  The social 
balance is the equalization of the strong and the weak; for, while they 
are not equals, they are strangers; they can form no associations, &mdash; they 
live as enemies.  Then, if inequality of conditions is a necessary evil, so 
is isolation, for society and inequality are incompatible with each other.  
Then, if society is the true condition of man's <pb n="61"/>existence, so is 
equality also.  This conclusion cannot be avoided. 
</p> 
<p>This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this 
balance, inequality has been on the increase?  How is it that justice and 
isolation always accompany each other?  Destutt de Tracy shall reply: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Needs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">means, rights</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">duties</hi>, are products of the will.  If man willed nothing, 
these would not exist.  But to have needs and means, rights and duties, 
is to <hi rend="italic">have</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">possess</hi>, something.  They are 
so many kinds of property, using the word in its most general sense: 
they are things which belong to us.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Shameful equivocation, not justified by the necessity for 
generalization!  The word <hi rend="italic">property</hi> has two meanings:  1. 
It designates the quality which makes a thing what it is; the attribute 
which is peculiar to it, and especially distinguishes it.  We use it in this 
sense when we say <hi rend="italic">the properties of the triangle</hi> or of 
<hi rend="italic">numbers; the property of the magnet</hi>, &amp;c.  2. It expresses 
the right of absolute control over a thing by a free and intelligent being.  
It is used in this sense by writers on jurisprudence.  Thus, in the phrase, 
<hi rend="italic">iron acquires the property of a magnet</hi>, the word 
<hi rend="italic">property</hi> does not convey the same idea that it does in this 
one:  <hi rend="italic">I have acquired this magnet as my property</hi>.  To tell 
a poor man that he HAS property because he HAS arms and legs, &mdash; that 
the hunger from which he suffers, and his power to sleep in the open air 
are his property, &mdash; is to play upon words, and to add insult to injury. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of 
personality.  As soon as property is born at all, it is born, of necessity, 
in all its fulness.  As soon as an individual knows <hi rend="italic">himself</hi>, 
&mdash; his moral personality, his capacities of enjoyment, suffering, and 
action, &mdash; he necessarily sees also that this <hi rend="italic">self</hi> is exclusive 
proprietor of the body in which it dwells, its organs, <pb n="62"/>their 
powers, faculties, &amp;c. . . .  Inasmuch as artificial and conventional 
property exists, there must be natural property also; for nothing can exist 
in art without its counterpart in Nature.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>We ought to admire the honesty and judgment of philosophers!  
Man has properties; that is, in the first acceptation of the term, faculties.  
He has property; that is, in its second acceptation, the right of domain.  
He has, then, the property of the property of being proprietor.  How 
ashamed I should be to notice such foolishness, were I here considering 
only the authority of Destutt de Tracy!  But the entire human race, since 
the origination of society and language, when metaphysics and dialectics 
were first born, has been guilty of this puerile confusion of thought.  All 
which man could call his own was identified in his mind with his person.  
He considered it as his property, his wealth; a part of himself, a member 
of his body, a faculty of his mind.  The possession of things was likened 
to property in the powers of the body and mind; and on this false 
analogy was based the right of property, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">the imitation of Nature 
by art</hi>, as Destutt de Tracy so elegantly puts it. 
</p> 
<p>But why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor 
even of his own faculties?  Man has powers, attributes, capacities; they 
are given him by Nature that he may live, learn, and love: he does not 
own them, but has only the use of them; and he can make no use of 
them that does not harmonize with Nature's laws.  If he had absolute 
mastery over his faculties, he could avoid hunger and cold; he could eat 
unstintedly, and walk through fire; he could move mountains, walk a 
hundred leagues in a minute, cure without medicines and by the sole 
force of his will, and could make himself immortal.  He could say, 
&ldquo;I wish to produce,&rdquo; and his tasks would be finished with 
the words; he could <pb n="63"/>say.  &ldquo;I wish to know,&rdquo; and 
he would know; &ldquo;I love,&rdquo; and he would enjoy.  What 
then?  Man is not master of himself, but may be of his surroundings.  
Let him use the wealth of Nature, since he can live only by its use; but 
let him abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor, and remember 
that he is called so only metaphorically. 
</p> 
<p>To sum up:  Destutt de Tracy classes together the external 
<hi rend="italic">productions</hi> of Nature and art, and the 
<hi rend="italic">powers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">faculties</hi> of man, making both of 
them species of property; and upon this equivocation he hopes to 
establish, so firmly that it can never be disturbed, the right of property.  
But of these different kinds of property some are <hi rend="italic">innate</hi>, as 
memory, imagination, strength, and beauty; while others are 
<hi rend="italic">acquired</hi>, as land, water, and forests.  In the state of 
Nature or isolation, the strongest and most skilful (that is, those best 
provided with innate property) stand the best chance of obtaining 
acquired property.  Now, it is to prevent this encroachment and the war 
which results therefrom, that a balance (justice) has been employed, and 
covenants (implied or expressed) agreed upon: it is to correct, as far as 
possible, inequality of innate property by equality of acquired property.  
As long as the division remains unequal, so long the partners remain 
enemies; and it is the purpose of the covenants to reform this state of 
things.  Thus we have, on the one hand, isolation, inequality, enmity, 
war, robbery, murder; on the other, society, equality, fraternity, peace, 
and love.  Choose between them! 
</p> 
<p>M. Joseph Dutens &mdash; a physician, engineer, and geometrician, but a 
very poor legist, and no philosopher at all &mdash; is the author of a 
&ldquo;Philosophy of Political Economy,&rdquo; in which he felt it his 
duty to break lances in behalf of property.  His reasoning seems to be 
borrowed from Destutt de Tracy.  He commences with this definition of 
property, worthy <pb n="64"/>of Sganarelle:  &ldquo;Property is the right by 
which a thing is one's own.&rdquo;  Literally translated:  Property is 
the right of property. 
</p> 
<p>After getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will, liberty, 
and personality; after having distinguished between <hi rend="italic">immaterial-natural</hi> property, and <hi rend="italic">material-natural</hi> property, a 
distinction similar to Destutt de Tracy's of innate and acquired property, 
&mdash; M. Joseph Dutens concludes with these two general propositions:  1. 
Property is a natural and inalienable right of every man; 2. Inequality of 
property is a necessary result of Nature, &mdash; which propositions are 
convertible into a simpler one:  All men have an equal right of unequal 
property. 
</p> 
<p>He rebukes M. de Sismondi for having taught that landed property 
has no other basis than law and conventionality; and he says himself, 
speaking of the respect which people feel for property, that &ldquo;their 
good sense reveals to them the nature of the <hi rend="italic">original 
contract</hi> made between society and proprietors.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>He confounds property with possession, communism with equality, 
the just with the natural, and the natural with the possible.  Now he 
takes these different ideas to be equivalents; now he seems to distinguish 
between them, so much so that it would be infinitely easier to refute him 
than to understand him.  Attracted first by the title of the work, 
&ldquo;Philosophy of Political Economy,&rdquo; I have found, among 
the author's obscurities, only the most ordinary ideas.  For that reason I 
will not speak of him. 
</p> 
<p>M. Cousin, in his &ldquo;Moral Philosophy,&rdquo; page 15, 
teaches that all morality, all laws, all rights are given to man with this 
injunction:  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Free being, remain free</hi>.&rdquo;  
Bravo! master; I wish to remain free if I can.  He continues: &mdash;  
<pb n="65"/>
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Our principle is true; it is good, it is social.  Do not fear 
to push it to its ultimate. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;1. If the human person is sacred, its whole nature is 
sacred; and particularly its interior actions, its feelings, its thoughts, its 
voluntary decisions.  This accounts for the respect due to philosophy, 
religion, the arts industry, commerce, and to all the results of liberty.  I 
say respect, not simply toleration; for we do not tolerate a right, we 
respect it.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>I bow my head before this philosophy. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;2. My liberty, which is sacred, needs for its objective 
action an instrument which we call the body: the body participates then 
in the sacredness of liberty; it is then inviolable.  This is the basis of the 
principle of individual liberty. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;3. My liberty needs, for its objective action, material to 
work upon; in other words, property or a thing.  This thing or property 
naturally participates then in the inviolability of my person.  For 
instance, I take possession of an object which has become necessary and 
useful in the outward manifestation of my liberty.  I say, `This object is 
mine since it belongs to no one else; consequently, I possess it 
legitimately.'  So the legitimacy of possession rests on two conditions.  
First, I possess only as a free being.  Suppress free activity, you destroy 
my power to labor.  Now it is only by labor that I can use this property 
or thing, and it is only by using it that I possess it.  Free activity is then 
the principle of the right of property.  But that alone does not legitimate 
possession.  All men are free; all can use property by labor.  Does that 
mean that all men have a right to all property?  Not at all.  To possess 
legitimately, I must not only labor and produce in my capacity of a free 
being, but I must also be the first to occupy the property.  In short, if 
labor and production are the principle of the right of property, the fact of 
first occupancy is its indispensable condition. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;4. I possess legitimately: then I have the right to use my 
property as I see fit.  I have also the right to give it away.  I have also 
the right to bequeath it; for if I decide to make a donation, my decision 
is as valid after my death as during my life.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In fact, to become a proprietor, in M. Cousin's opinion, one must 
take possession by occupation and labor.  I maintain that the element of 
time must be considered also; for if the first occupants have occupied 
every thing, what are the new <pb n="66"/>comers to do?  What will become 
of them, having an instrument with which to work, but no material to 
work upon?  Must they devour each other?  A terrible extremity, 
unforeseen by philosophical prudence; for the reason that great geniuses 
neglect little things. 
</p> 
<p>Notice also that M. Cousin says that neither occupation nor labor, 
taken separately, can legitimate the right of property; and that it is born 
only from the union of the two.  This is one of M. Cousin's eclectic 
turns, which he, more than any one else, should take pains to avoid.  
Instead of proceeding by the method of analysis, comparison, 
elimination, and reduction (the only means of discovering the truth amid 
the various forms of thought and whimsical opinions), he jumbles all 
systems together, and then, declaring each both right and wrong, 
exclaims:  &ldquo;There you have the truth.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But, adhering to my promise, I will not refute him.  I will only 
prove, by all the arguments with which he justifies the right of property, 
the principle of equality which kills it.  As I have already said, my sole 
intent is this: to show at the bottom of all these positions that inevitable 
major, <hi rend="italic">equality</hi>; hoping hereafter to show that the principle 
of property vitiates the very elements of economical, moral, and 
governmental science, thus leading it in the wrong direction. 
</p> 
<p>Well, is it not true, from M. Cousin's point of view, that, if the 
liberty of man is sacred, it is equally sacred in all individuals; that, if it 
needs property for its objective action, that is, for its life, the 
appropriation of material is equally necessary for all; that, if I wish to be 
respected in my right of appropriation, I must respect others in theirs; 
and, consequently, that though, in the sphere of the infinite, a person's 
power of appropriation is limited only by himself, in the sphere of the 
finite this same power is limited by the mathe<pb n="67"/>matical relation 
between the number of persons and the space which they occupy?  Does 
it not follow that if one individual cannot prevent another &mdash; his fellow-man &mdash; from appropriating an amount of material equal to his own, no 
more can he prevent individuals yet to come; because, while 
individuality passes away, universality persists, and eternal laws cannot 
be determined by a partial view of their manifestations?  Must we not 
conclude, therefore, that whenever a person is born, the others must 
crowd closer together; and, by reciprocity of obligation, that if the new 
comer is afterwards to become an heir, the right of succession does not 
give him the right of accumulation, but only the right of choice? 
</p> 
<p>I have followed M. Cousin so far as to imitate his style, and I am 
ashamed of it.  Do we need such high-sounding terms, such sonorous 
phrases, to say such simple things?  Man needs to labor in order to live; 
consequently, he needs tools to work with and materials to work upon.  
His need to produce constitutes his right to produce.  Now, this right is 
guaranteed him by his fellows, with whom he makes an agreement to 
that effect.  One hundred thousand men settle in a large country like 
France with no inhabitants: each man has a right to 1/100,000 of the 
land.  If the number of possessors increases, each one's portion 
diminishes in consequence; so that, if the number of inhabitants rises to 
thirty-four millions, each one will have a right only to 1/34,000,000.  
Now, so regulate the police system and the government, labor, 
exchange, inheritance, &amp;c., that the means of labor shall be shared by all 
equally, and that each individual shall be free; and then society will be 
perfect. 
</p> 
<p>Of all the defenders of property, M. Cousin has gone the farthest.  
He has maintained against the economists that <pb n="68"/>labor does not 
establish the right of property unless preceded by occupation, and against 
the jurists that the civil law can determine and apply a natural right, but 
cannot create it.  In fact, it is not sufficient to say, &ldquo;The right of 
property is demonstrated by the existence of property; the function of the 
civil law is purely declaratory.&rdquo;  To say that, is to confess that 
there is no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the fact itself.  
Every right must be justifiable in itself, or by some antecedent right; 
property is no exception.  For this reason, M. Cousin has sought to base 
it upon the <hi rend="italic">sanctity</hi> of the human personality, and the act 
by which the will assimilates a thing.  &ldquo;Once touched by 
man,&rdquo; says one of M. Cousin's disciples, &ldquo;things receive 
from him a character which transforms and humanizes them.&rdquo;  I 
confess, for my part, that I have no faith in this magic, and that I know 
of nothing less holy than the will of man.  But this theory, fragile as it 
seems to psychology as well as jurisprudence, is nevertheless more 
philosophical and profound than those theories which are based upon 
labor or the authority of the law.  Now, we have just seen to what this 
theory of which we are speaking leads, &mdash; to the equality implied in the 
terms of its statement. 
</p> 
<p>But perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint, 
and is not sufficiently practical; perhaps from the exalted summit of 
speculation men seem so small to the metaphysician that he cannot 
distinguish between them; perhaps, indeed, the equality of conditions is 
one of those principles which are very true and sublime as generalities, 
but which it would be ridiculous and even dangerous to attempt to 
rigorously apply to the customs of life and to social transactions.  
Undoubtedly, this is a case which calls for imitation of the wise reserve 
of moralists and jurists, who warn us <pb n="69"/>against carrying things to 
extremes, and who advise us to suspect every definition; because there is 
not one, they say, which cannot be utterly destroyed by developing its 
disastrous results &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Omnis definitio in jure civili periculosa est: 
parum est enim ut non subverti possit</hi>.  Equality of conditions, &mdash; 
a terrible dogma in the ears of the proprietor, a consoling truth at the 
poor-man's sick-bed, a frightful reality under the knife of the anatomist, 
&mdash; equality of conditions, established in the political, civil, and industrial 
spheres, is only an alluring impossibility, an inviting bait, a satanic 
delusion. 
</p> 
<p>It is never my intention to surprise my reader.  I detest, as I do 
death, the man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct.  From 
the first page of this book, I have expressed myself so plainly and 
decidedly that all can see the tendency of my thought and hopes; and 
they will do me the justice to say, that it would be difficult to exhibit 
more frankness and more boldness at the same time.  I do not hesitate to 
declare that the time is not far distant when this reserve, now so much 
admired in philosophers &mdash; this happy medium so strongly recommended 
by professors of moral and political science &mdash; will be regarded as the 
disgraceful feature of a science without principle, and as the seal of its 
reprobation.  In legislation and morals, as well as in geometry, axioms 
are absolute, definitions are certain; and all the results of a principle are 
to be accepted, provided they are logically deduced.  Deplorable pride!  
We know nothing of our nature, and we charge our blunders to it; and, 
in a fit of unaffected ignorance, cry out, &ldquo;The truth is in doubt, 
the best definition defines nothing!&rdquo;  We shall know some time 
whether this distressing uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the 
nature of its investigations, or from our prejudices; whether, to explain 
social phenomena, it is not enough to change our hypothesis, as did 
Copernicus when he reversed the system of Ptolemy. 
<pb n="70"/>
</p> 
<p>But what will be said when I show, as I soon shall, that this same 
jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality?  What 
reply can be made? 
 
&sect;  3. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Civil Law as the Foundation and Sanction of 
Property</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Pothier seems to think that property, like royalty, exists by divine 
right.  He traces back its origin to God himself &mdash; <hi rend="italic">ab Jove 
principium</hi>.  He begins in this way: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;God is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it 
contains:  <hi rend="italic">Domini est terra et plenitudo ejus, orbis et universi qui 
habitant in eo</hi>.  For the human race he has created the earth and 
all its creatures, and has given it a control over them subordinate only to 
his own.  `Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy 
hands; thou hast put all things under his feet,' says the Psalmist.  God 
accompanied this gift with these words, addressed to our first parents 
after the creation: `Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth,' 
&rdquo; &amp;c. 
 
</p> 
<p>After this magnificent introduction, who would refuse to believe 
the human race to be an immense family living in brotherly union, and 
under the protection of a venerable father?  But, heavens! are brothers 
enemies?  Are fathers unnatural, and children prodigal? 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">God gave the earth to the human race:</hi> why then 
have I received none?  <hi rend="italic">He has put all things under my 
feet</hi>, &mdash; and I have not where to lay my head!  
<hi rend="italic">Multiply</hi>, he tells us through his interpreter, Pothier.  Ah, 
learned Pothier! that is as easy to do as to say; but you must give moss 
to the bird for its nest. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The human race having multiplied, men divided among 
themselves the earth and most of the things upon it; that which fell to 
each, from that time exclusively belonged to him.  That was the origin 
of the right of property.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Say, rather, the right of possession.  Men lived in a state of 
communism; whether positive or negative it matters little.  <pb n="71"/>Then 
there was no property, not even private possession.  The genesis and 
growth of possession gradually forcing people to labor for their support, 
they agreed either formally or tacitly, &mdash; it makes no difference which, &mdash; 
that the laborer should be sole proprietor of the fruit of his labor; that is, 
they simply declared the fact that thereafter none could live without 
working.  It necessarily followed that, to obtain equality of products, 
there must be equality of labor; and that, to obtain equality of labor, 
there must be equality of facilities for labor.  Whoever without labor got 
possession, by force or by strategy, of another's means of subsistence, 
destroyed equality, and placed himself above or outside of the law.  
Whoever monopolized the means of production on the ground of greater 
industry, also destroyed equality.  Equality being then the expression of 
right, whoever violated it was <hi rend="italic">unjust</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, labor gives birth to private possession; the right in a thing &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">jus in re</hi>.  But in what thing?  Evidently <hi rend="italic">in the 
product</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">in the soil</hi>.  So the Arabs have always 
understood it; and so, according to C&aelig;sar and Tacitus, the 
Germans formerly held.  &ldquo;The Arabs,&rdquo; says M. de 
Sismondi, &ldquo;who admit a man's property in the flocks which he 
has raised, do not refuse the crop to him who planted the seed; but they 
do not see why another, his equal, should not have a right to plant in his 
turn.  The inequality which results from the pretended right of the first 
occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of justice; and when 
all the land falls into the hands of a certain number of inhabitants, there 
results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the nation, to which 
they do not wish to submit.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Well, they have shared the land.  I admit that therefrom results a 
more powerful organization of labor; and that this method of 
distribution, fixed and durable, is advantageous to <pb n="72"/>production: but 
how could this division give to each a transferable right of property in a 
thing to which all had an inalienable right of possession?  In the terms of 
jurisprudence, this metamorphosis from possessor to proprietor is legally 
impossible; it implies in the jurisdiction of the courts the union of 
<hi rend="italic">possessoire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">petitoire;</hi> and the mutual 
concessions of those who share the land are nothing less than traffic in 
natural rights.  The original cultivators of the land, who were also the 
original makers of the law, were not as learned as our legislators, I 
admit; and had they been, they could not have done worse: they did not 
foresee the consequences of the transformation of the right of private 
possession into the right of absolute property.  But why have not those, 
who in later times have established the distinction between <hi rend="italic">jus in 
re</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jus ad rem</hi>, applied it to the principle of 
property itself? 
</p> 
<p>Let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their 
own maxims. 
</p> 
<p>The right of property, provided it can have a cause, can have but 
one &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Dominium non potest nisi ex una causa contingere</hi>.  
I can possess by several titles; I can become proprietor by only one &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Non ut ex pluribus causis idem nobis deberi potest, ita ex pluribus 
causis idem potest nostrum esse</hi>.  The field which I have cleared, 
which I cultivate, on which I have built my house, which supports 
myself, my family, and my livestock, I can possess:  1st. As the original 
occupant; 2d. As a laborer; 3d. By virtue of the social contract which 
assigns it to me as my share.  But none of these titles confer upon me 
the right of property.  For, if I attempt to base it upon occupancy, 
society can reply, &ldquo;I am the original occupant.&rdquo;  If I 
appeal to my labor, it will say, &ldquo;It is only on that condition that 
you possess.&rdquo;  If I speak of agreements, it will respond, 
&ldquo;These agreements establish only your right of use.&rdquo;  
<pb n="73"/>Such, however, are the only titles which proprietors advance.  
They never have been able to discover any others.  Indeed, every right &mdash; 
it is Pothier who says it &mdash; supposes a producing cause in the person who 
enjoys it; but in man who lives and dies, in this son of earth who passes 
away like a shadow, there exists, with respect to external things, only 
titles of possession, not one title of property.  Why, then, has society 
recognized a right injurious to itself, where there is no producing cause?  
Why, in according possession, has it also conceded property?  Why has 
the law sanctioned this abuse of power? 
</p> 
<p>The German Ancillon replies thus: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Some philosophers pretend that man, in employing his 
forces upon a natural object, &mdash; say a field or a tree, &mdash; acquires a right 
only to the improvements which he makes, to the form which he gives to 
the object, not to the object itself.  Useless distinction!  If the form could 
be separated from the object, perhaps there would be room for question; 
but as this is almost always impossible, the application of man's strength 
to the different parts of the visible world is the foundation of the right of 
property, the primary origin of riches.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Vain pretext!  If the form cannot be separated from the object, nor 
property from possession, possession must be shared; in any case, 
society reserves the right to fix the conditions of property.  Let us 
suppose that an appropriated farm yields a gross income of ten thousand 
francs; and, as very seldom happens, that this farm cannot be divided.  
Let us suppose farther that, by economical calculation, the annual 
expenses of a family are three thousand francs: the possessor of this farm 
should be obliged to guard his reputation as a good father of a family, by 
paying to society ten thousand francs, &mdash; less the total costs of 
cultivation, and the three thousand francs required for the maintenance of 
his family.  This payment is not rent, it is an indemnity. 
<pb n="74"/> 
</p> 
<p>What sort of justice is it, then, which makes such laws as this: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, since labor so changes the form of a thing that 
the form and substance cannot be separated without destroying the thing 
itself, either society must be disinherited, or the laborer must lose the 
fruit of his labor; and 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, in every other case, property in raw material 
would give a title to added improvements, minus their cost; and whereas, 
in this instance, property in improvements ought to give a title to the 
principal; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Therefore, the right of appropriation by labor shall never 
be admitted against individuals, but only against society.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property.  
The law is intended to protect men's mutual rights, &mdash; that is, the rights 
of each against each, and each against all; and, as if a proportion could 
exist with less than four terms, the law-makers always disregard the 
latter.  As long as man is opposed to man, property offsets property, and 
the two forces balance each other; as soon as man is isolated, that is, 
opposed to the society which he himself represents, jurisprudence is at 
fault: Themis has lost one scale of her balance. 
</p> 
<p>Listen to the professor of Rennes, the learned Toullier: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;How could this claim, made valid by occupation, become 
stable and permanent property, which might continue to stand, and which 
might be reclaimed after the first occupant had relinquished possession? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Agriculture was a natural consequence of the 
multiplication of the human race, and agriculture, in its turn, favors 
population, and necessitates the establishment of permanent property; for 
who would take the trouble to plough and sow, if he were not certain 
that he would reap?&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>To satisfy the husbandman, it was sufficient to guarantee him 
possession of his crop; admit even that he should have been protected in 
his right of occupation of land, as long as he remained its cultivator.  
That was all that he had a right to expect; that was all that the advance 
of civilization de<pb n="75"/>manded.  But property, property! the right of 
escheat over lands which one neither occupies nor cultivates, &mdash; who had 
authority to grant it? who pretended to have it? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Agriculture alone was not sufficient to establish permanent 
property; positive laws were needed, and magistrates to execute them; in 
a word, the civil State was needed. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The multiplication of the human race had rendered 
agriculture necessary; the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of 
his labor made permanent property necessary, and also laws for its 
protection.  So we are indebted to property for the creation of the civil 
State.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Yes, of our civil State, as you have made it; a State which, at 
first, was despotism, then monarchy, then aristocracy, today democracy, 
and always tyranny. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Without the ties of property it never would have been 
possible to subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law; and 
without permanent property the earth would have remained a vast forest.  
Let us admit, then, with the most careful writers, that if transient 
property, or the right of preference resulting from occupation, existed 
prior to the establishment of civil society, permanent property, as we 
know it to-day, is the work of civil law.  It is the civil law which holds 
that, when once acquired, property can be lost only by the action of the 
proprietor, and that it exists even after the proprietor has relinquished 
possession of the thing, and it has fallen into the hands of a third party. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Thus property and possession, which originally were 
confounded, became through the civil law two distinct and independent 
things; two things which, in the language of the law, have nothing 
whatever in common.  In this we see what a wonderful change has been 
effected in property, and to what an extent Nature has been altered by 
the civil laws.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Thus the law, in establishing property, has not been the expression 
of a psychological fact, the development of a natural law, the application 
of a moral principle.  It has literally <hi rend="italic">created</hi> a right outside 
of its own province.  It has realized an abstraction, a metaphor, a 
fiction; and that without deigning to look at the consequences, without 
considering the disadvantages, without inquiring whether it was right or 
wrong. 
<pb n="76"/> 
</p> 
<p>It has sanctioned selfishness; it has indorsed monstrous 
pretensions; it has received with favor impious vows, as if it were able 
to fill up a bottomless pit, and to satiate hell!  Blind law; the law of the 
ignorant man; a law which is not a law; the voice of discord, deceit, and 
blood!  This it is which, continually revived, reinstated, rejuvenated, 
restored, re-enforced &mdash; as the palladium of society &mdash; has troubled the 
consciences of the people, has obscured the minds of the masters, and 
has induced all the catastrophes which have befallen nations.  This it is 
which Christianity has condemned, but which its ignorant ministers 
deify; who have as little desire to study Nature and man, as ability to 
read their Scriptures. 
</p> 
<p>But, indeed, what guide did the law follow in creating the domain 
of property?  What principle directed it?  What was its standard? 
</p> 
<p>Would you believe it?  It was equality. 
</p> 
<p>Agriculture was the foundation of territorial possession, and the 
original cause of property.  It was of no use to secure to the farmer the 
fruit of his labor, unless the means of production were at the same time 
secured to him.  To fortify the weak against the invasion of the strong, 
to suppress spoliation and fraud, the necessity was felt of establishing 
between possessors permanent lines of division, insuperable obstacles.  
Every year saw the people multiply, and the cupidity of the husbandman 
increase: it was thought best to put a bridle on ambition by setting 
boundaries which ambition would in vain attempt to overstep.  Thus the 
soil came to be appropriated through need of the equality which is 
essential to public security and peaceable possession.  Undoubtedly the 
division was never geographically equal; a multitude of rights, some 
founded in Nature, but wrongly interpreted and still more wrongly 
applied, inheritance, gift, and exchange; others, like <pb n="77"/>the 
privileges of birth and position, the illegitimate creations of ignorance 
and brute force, &mdash; all operated to prevent absolute equality.  But, 
nevertheless, the principle remained the same: equality had sanctioned 
possession; equality sanctioned property. 
</p> 
<p>The husbandman needed each year a field to sow; what more 
convenient and simple arrangement for the barbarians, &mdash; instead of 
indulging in annual quarrels and fights, instead of continually moving 
their houses, furniture, and families from spot to spot, &mdash; than to assign 
to each individual a fixed and inalienable estate? 
</p> 
<p>It was not right that the soldier, on returning from an expedition, 
should find himself dispossessed on account of the services which he had 
just rendered to his country; his estate ought to be restored to him.  It 
became, therefore, customary to retain property by intent alone &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">nudo animo;</hi> it could be sacrificed only with the consent 
and by the action of the proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>It was necessary that the equality in the division should be kept up 
from one generation to another, without a new distribution of the land 
upon the death of each family; it appeared therefore natural and just that 
children and parents, according to the degree of relationship which they 
bore to the deceased, should be the heirs of their ancestors.  Thence 
came, in the first place, the feudal and patriarchal custom of recognizing 
only one heir; then, by a quite contrary application of the principle of 
equality, the admission of all the children to a share in their father's 
estate, and, very recently also among us, the definitive abolition of the 
right of primogeniture. 
</p> 
<p>But what is there in common between these rude outlines of 
instinctive organization and the true social science?  How could these 
men, who never had the faintest idea of statistics, <pb n="78"/>valuation, or 
political economy, furnish us with principles of legislation? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The law,&rdquo; says a modern writer on jurisprudence, 
&ldquo;is the expression of a social want, the declaration of a fact: the 
legislator does not make it, he declares it.  `This definition is not exact.  
The law is a method by which social wants must be satisfied; the people 
do not vote it, the legislator does not express it: the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> 
discovers and formulates it.  But in fact, the law, according to M. Ch. 
Comte, who has devoted half a volume to its definition, was in the 
beginning only the <hi rend="italic">expression of a want</hi>, and the indication 
of the means of supplying it; and up to this time it has been nothing else.  
The legists &mdash; with mechanical fidelity, full of obstinacy, enemies of 
philosophy, buried in literalities &mdash; have always mistaken for the last 
word of science that which was only the inconsiderate aspiration of men 
who, to be sure, were well-meaning, but wanting in foresight. 
</p> 
<p>They did not foresee, these old founders of the domain of 
property, that the perpetual and absolute right to retain one's estate, &mdash; a 
right which seemed to them equitable, because it was common, &mdash; 
involves the right to transfer, sell, give, gain, and lose it; that it tends, 
consequently, to nothing less than the destruction of that equality which 
they established it to maintain.  And though they should have foreseen it, 
they disregarded it; the present want occupied their whole attention, and, 
as ordinarily happens in such cases, the disadvantages were at first 
scarcely perceptible, and they passed unnoticed. 
</p> 
<p>They did not foresee, these ingenuous legislators, that if property 
is retainable by intent alone &mdash; <hi rend="italic">nudo animo</hi> &mdash; it carries 
with it the right to let, to lease, to loan at interest, to profit by exchange, 
to settle annuities, and to levy a tax on a field which intent reserves, 
while the body is busy elsewhere. 
<pb n="79"/> 
</p> 
<p>They did not foresee, these fathers of our jurisprudence, that, if 
the right of inheritance is any thing other than Nature's method of 
preserving equality of wealth, families will soon become victims of the 
most disastrous exclusions; and society, pierced to the heart by one of its 
most sacred principles, will come to its death through opulence and 
misery.[1] 
</p> 
<p>They did not foresee. . . .  But why need I go farther? 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] Here, especially, the simplicity of our ancestors appears in all 
its rudeness.  After having made first cousins heirs, where there were no 
legitimate children, they could not so divide the property between two 
different branches as to prevent the simultaneous existence of extreme 
wealth and extreme poverty in the same family.  For example: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>James, dying, leaves two sons, Peter and John, heirs of his 
fortune: James's property is divided equally between them.  But Peter 
has only one daughter, while John, his brother, leaves six sons.  It is 
clear that, to be true to the principle of equality, and at the same time to 
that of heredity, the two estates must be divided in seven equal portions 
among the children of Peter and John; for otherwise a stranger might 
marry Peter's daughter, and by this alliance half of the property of 
James, the grandfather, would be transferred to another family, which is 
contrary to the principle of heredity.  Furthermore, John's children 
would be poor on account of their number, while their cousin, being an 
only child, would be rich, which is contrary to the principle of equality.  
If we extend this combined application of two principles apparently 
opposed to each other, we shall become convinced that the right of 
succession, which is assailed with so little wisdom in our day, is no 
obstacle to the maintenance of equality. 
</p> 
<p>Under whatever form of government we live, it can always be said 
that <hi rend="italic">le mort saisit le vif;</hi> that is, that inheritance and 
succession will last for ever, whoever may be the recognized heir.  But 
the St. Simonians wish the heir to be designated by the magistrate; others 
wish him to be chosen by the deceased, or assumed by the law to be so 
chosen: the essential point is that Nature's wish be satisfied, so far as the 
law of equality allows.  To-day the real controller of inheritance is 
chance or caprice; now, in matters of legislation, chance and caprice 
cannot be accepted as guides.  It is for the purpose of avoiding the 
manifold disturbances which follow in the wake of chance that Nature, 
after having created us equal, suggests to us the principle of heredity; 
which serves as a voice by which society asks us to choose, from among 
all our brothers, him whom we judge best fitted to complete our 
unfinished work. 
 
 
 
<pb n="80"/>The consequences are plain enough, and this is not the time to 
criticise the whole Code. 
</p> 
<p>The history of property among the ancient nations is, then, simply 
a matter of research and curiosity.  It is a rule of jurisprudence that the 
fact does not substantiate the right.  Now, property is no exception to 
this rule: then the universal recognition of the right of property does not 
legitimate the right of property.  Man is mistaken as to the constitution 
of society, the nature of right, and the application of justice; just as he 
was mistaken regarding the cause of meteors and the movement of the 
heavenly bodies.  His old opinions cannot be taken for articles of faith.  
Of what consequence is it to us that the Indian race was divided into four 
classes; that, on the banks of the Nile and the Ganges, blood and 
position formerly determined the distribution of the land; that the Greeks 
and Romans placed property under the protection of the gods; that they 
accompanied with religious ceremonies the work of partitioning the land 
and appraising their goods?  The variety of the forms of privilege does 
not sanction injustice.  The faith of Jupiter, the proprietor,[1] proves no 
more against the equality of citizens, than do the mysteries of Venus, the 
wanton, against conjugal chastity. 
</p> 
<p>The authority of the human race is of no effect as evidence in 
favor of the right of property, because this right, resting of necessity 
upon equality, contradicts its principle; the decision of the religions 
which have sanctioned it is of no effect, because in all ages the priest has 
submitted to the prince, and the gods have always spoken as the 
politicians desired; the social advantages, attributed to property, cannot 
 
 
[1] <hi rend="italic">Zeus kl&eacute;sios</hi>. 
 
 
<pb n="81"/>be cited in its behalf, because they all spring from the principle of 
equality of possession. 
</p> 
<p>What means, then, this dithyramb upon property? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The right of property is the most important of human 
institutions.&rdquo; . . . 
 
</p> 
<p>Yes; as monarchy is the most glorious. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The original cause of man's prosperity upon 
earth.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Because justice was supposed to be its principle. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Property became the legitimate end of his ambition, the 
hope of his existence, the shelter of his family; in a word, the corner-stone of the domestic dwelling, of communities, and of the political 
State.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Possession alone produced all that. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Eternal principle, &mdash; &rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Property is eternal, like every negation, &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Of all social and civil institutions.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>For that reason, every institution and every law based on property 
will perish. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It is a boon as precious as liberty.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>For the rich proprietor. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In fact, the cause of the cultivation of the habitable 
earth.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>If the cultivator ceased to be a tenant, would the land be worse 
cared for? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The guarantee and the morality of labor.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Under the regime of property, labor is not a condition, but a 
privilege. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The application of justice.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>What is justice without equality of fortunes?  A balance with false 
weights. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;All morality, &mdash; &rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>A famished stomach knows no morality, &mdash;  
 
<pb n="82"/> 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;All public order, &mdash; &rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Certainly, the preservation of property, &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Rest on the right of property.&rdquo;[1] 
 
</p> 
<p>Corner-stone of all which is, stumbling-block of all which ought to 
be, &mdash; such is property. 
 
</p> 
<p>To sum up and conclude: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Not only does occupation lead to equality, it 
<hi rend="italic">prevents</hi> property.  For, since every man, from the fact of 
his existence, has the right of occupation, and, in order to live, must 
have material for cultivation on which he may labor; and since, on the 
other hand, the number of occupants varies continually with the births 
and deaths, &mdash; it follows that the quantity of material which each laborer 
may claim varies with the number of occupants; consequently, that 
occupation is always subordinate to population.  Finally, that, inasmuch 
as possession, in right, can never remain fixed, it is impossible, in fact, 
that it can ever become property. 
</p> 
<p>Every occupant is, then, necessarily a possessor or usufructuary, &mdash; 
a function which excludes proprietorship.  Now, this is the right of the 
usufructuary: he is responsible for the thing entrusted to him; he must 
use it in conformity with general utility, with a view to its preservation 
and development; he has no power to transform it, to diminish it, or to 
change its nature; he cannot so divide the usufruct that another shall 
perform the labor while he receives the product.  In a word, the 
usufructuary is under the supervision of society, submitted to the 
condition of labor and the law of equality. 
</p> 
<p>Thus is annihilated the Roman definition of property &mdash; <hi rend="italic">the 
right of use and abuse</hi> &mdash; an immorality born of violence, the 
 
 
[1] Giraud, &ldquo;Investigations into the Right of Property among the 
Romans.&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="83"/> 
most monstrous pretension that the civil laws ever sanctioned.  
Man receives his usufruct from the hands of society, which alone is the 
permanent possessor.  The individual passes away, society is deathless. 
</p> 
<p>What a profound disgust fills my soul while discussing such simple 
truths ! Do we doubt these things to-day?  Will it be necessary to again 
take arms for their triumph?  And can force, in default of reason, alone 
introduce them into our laws? 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">All have an equal right of occupancy. </hi>
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">The amount occupied being measured, not by the will, but by the 
variable conditions of space and number, property cannot exist</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This no code has ever expressed; this no constitution can admit!  
These are axioms which the civil law and the law of nations 
deny! . . . . . 
</p> 
<p>But I hear the exclamations of the partisans of another system:  
&ldquo;Labor, labor! that is the basis of property!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Reader, do not be deceived.  This new basis of property is worse 
than the first, and I shall soon have to ask your pardon for having 
demonstrated things clearer, and refuted pretensions more unjust, than 
any which we have yet considered.

</div2> 
<div2 type="chapter" n="3" id="d12"> 
<head>CHAPTER III. 
LABOR AS THE EFFICIENT CAUSE OF THE DOMAIN OF 
PROPERTY. 
</head> 
<p>Nearly all the modern writers on jurisprudence, taking their cue 
from the economists, have abandoned the theory of first occupancy as a 
too dangerous one, and have adopted that which regards property as born 
of labor.  In this they are deluded; they reason in a circle.  To labor it is 
necessary to occupy, says M. Cousin.  Consequently, I have added in 
my turn, all having an equal right of occupancy, to labor it is necessary 
to submit to equality.  &ldquo;The rich,&rdquo; exclaims Jean Jacques, 
&ldquo;have the arrogance to say, `I built this wall; I earned this land 
by my labor.'  Who set you the tasks? we may reply, and by what right 
do you demand payment from us for labor which we did not impose 
upon you?&rdquo;  All sophistry falls to the ground in the presence of 
this argument. 
</p> 
<p>But the partisans of labor do not see that their system is an 
absolute contradiction of the Code, all the articles and provisions of 
which suppose property to be based upon the fact of first occupancy.  If 
labor, through the appropriation which results from it, alone gives birth 
to property, the Civil Code lies, the charter is a falsehood, our whole 
social system is a violation of right.  To this conclusion shall we come, 
at <pb n="85"/>the end of the discussion which is to occupy our attention in 
this chapter and the following one, both as to the right of labor and the 
fact of property.  We shall see, on the one hand, our legislation in 
opposition to itself; and, on the other hand, our new jurisprudence in 
opposition both to its own principle and to our legislation. 
</p> 
<p>I have asserted that the system which bases property upon labor 
implies, no less than that which bases it upon occupation, the equality of 
fortunes; and the reader must be impatient to learn how I propose to 
deduce this law of equality from the inequality of skill and faculties: 
directly his curiosity shall be satisfied.  But it is proper that I should call 
his attention for a moment to this remarkable feature of the process; to 
wit, the substitution of labor for occupation as the principle of property; 
and that I should pass rapidly in review some of the prejudices to which 
proprietors are accustomed to appeal, which legislation has sanctioned, 
and which the system of labor completely overthrows. 
</p> 
<p>Reader, were you ever present at the examination of a criminal?  
Have you watched his tricks, his turns, his evasions, his distinctions, his 
equivocations?  Beaten, all his assertions overthrown, pursued like a 
fallow deer by the in exorable judge, tracked from hypothesis to 
hypothesis, &mdash; he makes a statement, he corrects it, retracts it, contradicts 
it, he exhausts all the tricks of dialectics, more subtle, more ingenious a 
thousand times than he who invented the seventy-two forms of the 
syllogism.  So acts the proprietor when called upon to defend his right.  
At first he refuses to reply, he exclaims, he threatens, he defies; then, 
forced to accept the discussion, he arms himself with chicanery, he 
surrounds himself with formidable artillery, &mdash; crossing his fire, opposing 
one by one and all together occupation, possession, limitation, 
<pb n="86"/>covenants, immemorial custom, and universal consent.  
Conquered on this ground, the proprietor, like a wounded boar, turns on 
his pursuers.  &ldquo;I have done more than occupy,&rdquo; he cries 
with terrible emotion; &ldquo;I have labored, produced, improved, 
transformed, <hi rend="italic">created</hi>.  This house, these fields, these trees 
are the work of my hands; I changed these brambles into a vineyard, and 
this bush into a fig-tree; and to-day I reap the harvest of my labors.  I 
have enriched the soil with my sweat; I have paid those men who, had 
they not had the work which I gave them, would have died of hunger.  
No one shared with me the trouble and expense; no one shall share with 
me the benefits.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>You have labored, proprietor! why then do you speak of original 
occupancy?  What, were you not sure of your right, or did you hope to 
deceive men, and make justice an illusion?  Make haste, then, to 
acquaint us with your mode of defence, for the judgment will be final; 
and you know it to be a question of restitution. 
</p> 
<p>You have labored! but what is there in common between the labor 
which duty compels you to perform, and the appropriation of things in 
which there is a common interest?  Do you not know that domain over 
the soil, like that over air and light, cannot be lost by prescription? 
</p> 
<p>You have labored! have you never made others labor?  Why, then, 
have they lost in laboring for you what you have gained in not laboring 
for them? 
</p> 
<p>You have labored! very well; but let us see the results of your 
labor.  We will count, weigh, and measure them.  It will be the 
judgment of Balthasar; for I swear by balance, level, and square, that if 
you have appropriated another's labor in any way whatsoever, you shall 
restore it every stroke. 
<pb n="87"/> 
</p> 
<p>Thus, the principle of occupation is abandoned; no longer is it 
said, &ldquo;The land belongs to him who first gets possession of it.  
Property, forced into its first intrenchment, repudiates its old adage; 
justice, ashamed, retracts her maxims, and sorrow lowers her bandage 
over her blushing cheeks.  And it was but yesterday that this progress in 
social philosophy began: fifty centuries required for the extirpation of a 
lie!  During this lamentable period, how many usurpations have been 
sanctioned, how many invasions glorified, how many conquests 
celebrated!  The absent dispossessed, the poor banished, the hungry 
excluded by wealth, which is so ready and bold in action!  Jealousies and 
wars, incendiarism and bloodshed, among the nations!  But henceforth, 
thanks to the age and its spirit, it is to be admitted that the earth is not a 
prize to be won in a race; in the absence of any other obstacle, there is a 
place for everybody under the sun.  Each one may harness his goat to 
the bearn, drive his cattle to pasture, sow a corner of a field, and bake 
his bread by his own fireside. 
</p> 
<p>But, no; each one cannot do these things.  I hear it proclaimed on 
all sides, &ldquo;Glory to labor and industry! to each according to his 
capacity; to each capacity according to its results!&rdquo;  And I see 
three-fourths of the human race again despoiled, the labor of a few being 
a scourge to the labor of the rest. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The problem is solved,&rdquo; exclaims M. Hennequin.  
&ldquo;Property, the daughter of labor, can be enjoyed at present and in 
the future only under the protection of the laws.  It has its origin in 
natural law; it derives its power from civil law; and from the union of 
these two ideas, <hi rend="italic">labor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">protection</hi>, 
positive legislation results.&rdquo; . . . 
 
</p> 
<p>Ah! <hi rend="italic">the problem is solved! property is the daughter of 
labor!</hi>  What, then, is the right of accession, and the right 
<pb n="88"/>of succession, and the right of donation, &amp;c., if not the right to 
become a proprietor by simple occupancy?  What are your laws 
concerning the age of majority, emancipation, guardianship, and 
interdiction, if not the various conditions by which he who is already a 
laborer gains or loses the right of occupancy; that is, property? 
</p> 
<p>Being unable, at this time, to enter upon a detailed discussion of 
the Code, I shall content myself with examining the three arguments 
oftenest resorted to in support of property.  1. 
<hi rend="italic">Appropriation</hi>, or the formation of property by possession; 
2. <hi rend="italic">The consent of mankind</hi>; 3. <hi rend="italic">Prescription</hi>.  
I shall then inquire into the effects of labor upon the relative condition of 
the laborers and upon property. 
 
&sect; 1. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">The Land cannot be Appropriated</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It would seem that lands capable of cultivation ought to be 
regarded as natural wealth, since they are not of human creation, but 
Nature's gratuitous gift to man; but inasmuch as this wealth is not 
fugitive, like the air and water, &mdash; inasmuch as a field is a fixed and 
limited space which certain men have been able to appropriate, to the 
exclusion of all others who in their turn have consented to this 
appropriation, &mdash; the land, which was a natural and gratuitous gift, has 
become social wealth, for the use of which we ought to pay.&rdquo; &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Say:  Political Economy</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Was I wrong in saying, at the beginning of this chapter, that the 
economists are the very worst authorities in matters of legislation and 
philosophy?  It is the <hi rend="italic">father</hi> of this class of men who 
clearly states the question, How can the supplies of Nature, the wealth 
created by Providence, become private property? and who replies by so 
gross an equivocation that we scarcely know which the author lacks, 
sense or honesty.  What, I ask, has the fixed and solid nature of the 
earth to do with the right of appropriation?  I can understand that a thing 
<hi rend="italic">limited</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stationary</hi>, like the land, offers 
greater <pb n="89"/>chances for appropriation than the water or the sunshine; 
that it is easier to exercise the right of domain over the soil than over the 
atmosphere: but we are not dealing with the difficulty of the thing, and 
Say confounds the right with the possibility.  We do not ask why the 
earth has been appropriated to a greater extent than the sea and the air; 
we want to know by what right man has appropriated wealth 
<hi rend="italic">which he did not create, and which Nature gave to him 
gratuitously</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Say, then, did not solve the question which he asked.  But if he 
had solved it, if the explanation which he has given us were as 
satisfactory as it is illogical, we should know no better than before who 
has a right to exact payment for the use of the soil, of this wealth which 
is not man's handiwork.  Who is entitled to the rent of the land?  The 
producer of the land, without doubt.  Who made the land?  God.  Then, 
proprietor, retire! 
</p> 
<p>But the creator of the land does not sell it: he gives it; and, in 
giving it, he is no respecter of persons.  Why, then, are some of his 
children regarded as legitimate, while others are treated as bastards?  If 
the equality of shares was an original right, why is the inequality of 
conditions a posthumous right? 
</p> 
<p>Say gives us to understand that if the air and the water were not of 
a <hi rend="italic">fugitive</hi> nature, they would have been appropriated.  Let 
me observe in passing that this is more than an hypothesis; it is a reality.  
Men have appropriated the air and the water, I will not say as often as 
they could, but as often as they have been allowed to. 
</p> 
<p>The Portuguese, having discovered the route to India by the Cape 
of Good Hope, pretended to have the sole right to that route; and 
Grotius, consulted in regard to this matter by the Dutch who refused to 
recognize this right, wrote expressly <pb n="90"/>for this occasion his treatise 
on the &ldquo;Freedom of the Seas,&rdquo; to prove that the sea is not 
liable to appropriation. 
</p> 
<p>The right to hunt and fish used always to be confined to lords and 
proprietors; to-day it is leased by the government and communes to 
whoever can pay the license-fee and the rent.  To regulate hunting and 
fishing is an excellent idea, but to make it a subject of sale is to create a 
monopoly of air and water. 
</p> 
<p>What is a passport?  A universal recommendation of the traveller's 
person; a certificate of security for himself and his property.  The 
treasury, whose nature it is to spoil the best things, has made the 
passport a means of espionage and a tax.  Is not this a sale of the right to 
travel? 
</p> 
<p>Finally, it is permissible neither to draw water from a spring 
situated in another's grounds without the permission of the proprietor, 
because by the right of accession the spring belongs to the possessor of 
the soil, if there is no other claim; nor to pass a day on his premises 
without paying a tax; nor to look at a court, a garden, or an orchard, 
without the consent of the proprietor; nor to stroll in a park or an 
enclosure against the owner's will: every one is allowed to shut himself 
up and to fence himself in.  All these prohibitions are so many positive 
interdictions, not only of the land, but of the air and water.  We who 
belong to the proletaire class: property excommunicates us!  
<hi rend="italic">Terra, et aqua, et aere, et igne interdicti sumus</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Men could not appropriate the most fixed of all the elements 
without appropriating the three others; since, by French and Roman law, 
property in the surface carries with it property from zenith to nadir &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad c&aelig;lum</hi>.  Now, if 
the use of water, air, and fire excludes property, so does the use of the 
soil.  This chain of <pb n="91"/>reasoning seems to have been presented by 
M. Ch. Comte, in his &ldquo;Treatise on Property,&rdquo; chap. 5. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If a man should be deprived of air for a few moments 
only, he would cease to exist, and a partial deprivation would cause him 
severe suffering; a partial or complete deprivation of food would produce 
like effects upon him though less suddenly; it would be the same, at least 
in certain climates! were he deprived of all clothing and shelter. . . .  To 
sustain life, then, man needs continually to appropriate many different 
things.  But these things do not exist in like proportions.  Some, such as 
the light of the stars, the atmosphere of the earth, the water composing 
the seas and oceans, exist in such large quantities that men cannot 
perceive any sensible increase or diminution; each one can appropriate as 
much as his needs require without detracting from the enjoyment of 
others, without causing them the least harm.  Things of this sort are, so 
to speak, the common property of the human race; the only duty 
imposed upon each individual in this regard is that of infringing not at all 
upon the rights of others.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Let us complete the argument of M. Ch. Comte.  A man who 
should be prohibited from walking in the highways, from resting in the 
fields, from taking shelter in caves, from lighting fires, from picking 
berries, from gathering herbs and boiling them in a bit of baked clay, &mdash; 
such a man could not live.  Consequently the earth &mdash; like water, air, and 
light &mdash; is a primary object of necessity which each has a right to use 
freely, without infringing another's right.  Why, then, is the earth 
appropriated?  M. Ch. Comte's reply is a curious one.  Say pretends that 
it is because it is not <hi rend="italic">fugitive;</hi> M. Ch. Comte assures us 
that it is because it is not <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi>.  The land is limited in 
amount.  Then, according to M. Ch. Comte, it ought to be appropriated.  
It would seem, on the contrary, that he ought to say, Then it ought not 
to be appropriated.  Because, no matter how large a quantity of air or 
light any one appropriates, no one is damaged thereby; there always 
remains enough for all.  With the soil, it is very different.  <pb n="92"/>Lay 
hold who will, or who can, of the sun's rays, the passing breeze, or the 
sea's billows; he has my consent, and my pardon for his bad intentions.  
But let any living man dare to change his right of territorial possession 
into the right of property, and I will declare war upon him, and wage it 
to the death! 
</p> 
<p>M. Ch. Comte's argument disproves his position.  &ldquo;Among 
the things necessary to the preservation of life,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;there are some which exist in such large quantities that they are 
inexhaustible; others which exist in lesser quantities, and can satisfy the 
wants of only a certain number of persons.  The former are called 
<hi rend="italic">common</hi>, the latter <hi rend="italic">private</hi>.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>This reasoning is not strictly logical.  Water, air, and light are 
<hi rend="italic">common</hi> things, not because they are 
<hi rend="italic">inexhaustible</hi>, but because they are 
<hi rend="italic">indispensable;</hi> and so indispensable that for that very 
reason Nature has created them in quantities almost infinite, in order that 
their plentifulness might prevent their appropriation.  Likewise the land 
is indispensable to our existence, &mdash; consequently a common thing, 
consequently insusceptible of appropriation; but land is much scarcer 
than the other elements, therefore its use must be regulated, not for the 
profit of a few, but in the interest and for the security of all.  In a word, 
equality of rights is proved by equality of needs.  Now, equality of 
rights, in the case of a commodity which is limited in amount, can be 
realized only by equality of possession.  An agrarian law underlies M. 
Ch. Comte's arguments. 
</p> 
<p>From whatever point we view this question of property &mdash; provided 
we go to the bottom of it &mdash; we reach equality.  I will not insist farther 
on the distinction between things which can, and things which cannot, be 
appropriated.  On this point, economists and legists talk worse than 
nonsense.  The Civil Code, after having defined property, says nothing 
about sus<pb n="93"/>ceptibility of appropriation; and if it speaks of things 
which are in <hi rend="italic">the market</hi>, it always does so without 
enumerating or describing them.  However, light is not wanting.  There 
are some few maxims such as these: <hi rend="italic">Ad reges potestas omnium 
pertinet, ad singulos proprietas; Omnia rex imperio possidet, singula 
dominio</hi>.  Social sovereignty opposed to private property! &mdash; 
might not that be called a prophecy of equality, a republican oracle?  
Examples crowd upon us: once the possessions of the church, the estates 
of the crown, the fiefs of the nobility were inalienable and 
imprescriptible.  If, instead of abolishing this privilege, the Constituent 
had extended it to every individual; if it had declared that the right of 
labor, like liberty, can never be forfeited, &mdash; at that moment the 
revolution would have been consummated, and we could now devote 
ourselves to improvement in other directions. 
 
&sect; 2. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Universal Consent no Justification of 
Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>In the extract from Say, quoted above, it is not clear whether the 
author means to base the right of property on the stationary character of 
the soil, or on the consent which he thinks all men have granted to this 
appropriation.  His language is such that it may mean either of these 
things, or both at once; which entitles us to assume that the author 
intended to say, &ldquo;The right of property resulting originally from 
the exercise of the will, the stability of the soil permitted it to be applied 
to the land, and universal consent has since sanctioned this 
application.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>However that may be, can men legitimate property by mutual 
consent?  I say, no.  Such a contract, though drafted by Grotius, 
Montesquieu, and J. J. Rousseau, though signed by the whole human 
race, would be null in the eyes of jus<pb n="94"/>tice, and an act to enforce it 
would be illegal.  Man can no more give up labor than liberty.  Now, to 
recognize the right of territorial property is to give up labor, since it is 
to relinquish the means of labor; it is to traffic in a natural right, and 
divest ourselves of manhood. 
</p> 
<p>But I wish that this consent, of which so much is made, had been 
given, either tacitly or formally.  What would have been the result?  
Evidently, the surrenders would have been reciprocal; no right would 
have been abandoned without the receipt of an equivalent in exchange.  
We thus come back to equality again, &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> 
of appropriation; so that, after having justified property by universal 
consent, that is, by equality, we are obliged to justify the inequality of 
conditions by property.  Never shall we extricate ourselves from this 
dilemma.  Indeed, if, in the terms of the social compact, property has 
equality for its condition, at the moment when equality ceases to exist, 
the compact is broken and all property becomes usurpation.  We gain 
nothing, then, by this pretended consent of mankind. 
 
 
&sect; 3. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Prescription gives no Title to Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The right of property was the origin of evil on the earth, the first 
link in the long chain of crimes and misfortunes which the human race 
has endured since its birth.  The delusion of prescription is the fatal 
charm thrown over the intellect, the death sentence breathed into the 
conscience, to arrest man's progress towards truth, and bolster up the 
worship of error. 
</p> 
<p>The Code defines prescription thus:  &ldquo;The process of 
gaining and losing through the lapse of time.&rdquo;  In applying this 
definition to ideas and beliefs, we may use the word 
<hi rend="italic">prescription</hi> to denote the everlasting prejudice in favor of 
old super<pb n="95"/>stitions, whatever be their object; the opposition, often 
furious and bloody, with which new light has always been received, and 
which makes the sage a martyr.  Not a principle, not a discovery, not a 
generous thought but has met, at its entrance into the world, with a 
formidable barrier of preconceived opinions, seeming like a conspiracy 
of all old prejudices.  Prescriptions against reason, prescriptions against 
facts, prescriptions against every truth hitherto unknown, &mdash; that is the 
sum and substance of the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> philosophy, the 
watchword of conservatives throughout the centuries. 
</p> 
<p>When the evangelical reform was broached to the world, there was 
prescription in favor of violence, debauchery, and selfishness; when 
Galileo, Descartes, Pascal, and their disciples reconstructed philosophy 
and the sciences, there was prescription in favor of the Aristotelian 
philosophy; when our fathers of '89 demanded liberty and equality, there 
was prescription in favor of tyranny and privilege.  &ldquo;There 
always have been proprietors and there always will be:&rdquo; it is with 
this profound utterance, the final effort of selfishness dying in its last 
ditch, that the friends of social inequality hope to repel the attacks of 
their adversaries; thinking undoubtedly that ideas, like property, can be 
lost by prescription. 
</p> 
<p>Enlightened to-day by the triumphal march of science, taught by 
the most glorious successes to question our own opinions, we receive 
with favor and applause the observer of Nature, who, by a thousand 
experiments based upon the most profound analysis, pursues a new 
principle, a law hitherto undiscovered.  We take care to repel no idea, 
no fact, under the pretext that abler men than ourselves lived in former 
days, who did not notice the same phenomena, nor grasp the same 
analogies.  Why do we not preserve a like attitude towards political and 
philosophical questions?  Why this <pb n="96"/>ridiculous mania for affirming 
that every thing has been said, which means that we know all about 
mental and moral science?  Why is the proverb, <hi rend="italic">There is nothing 
new under the sun</hi>, applied exclusively to metaphysical 
investigations? 
</p> 
<p>Because we still study philosophy with the imagination, instead of 
by observation and method; because fancy and will are universally 
regarded as judges, in the place of arguments and facts, &mdash; it has been 
impossible to this day to distinguish the charlatan from the philosopher, 
the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> from the impostor.  Since the days of Solomon 
and Pythagoras, imagination has been exhausted in guessing out social 
and psychological laws; all systems have been proposed.  Looked at in 
this light, it is probably true that <hi rend="italic">every thing has been 
said;</hi> but it is no less true that <hi rend="italic">every thing remains to be 
proved</hi>.  In politics (to take only this branch of philosophy), in 
politics every one is governed in his choice of party by his passion and 
his interests; the mind is submitted to the impositions of the will, &mdash; there 
is no knowledge, there is not even a shadow of certainty.  In this way, 
general ignorance produces general tyranny; and while liberty of thought 
is written in the charter, slavery of thought, under the name of 
<hi rend="italic">majority rule</hi>, is decreed by the charter. 
</p> 
<p>In order to confine myself to the civil prescription of which the 
Code speaks, I shall refrain from beginning a discussion upon this worn-out objection brought forward by proprietors; it would be too tiresome 
and declamatory.  Everybody knows that there are rights which cannot 
be prescribed; and, as for those things which can be gained through the 
lapse of time, no one is ignorant of the fact that prescription requires 
certain conditions, the omission of one of which renders it null.  If it is 
true, for example, that the proprietor's possession has been <hi rend="italic">civil, 
public, peaceable</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">uninterrupted</hi>, it is 
<pb n="97"/>none the less true that it is not based on a just title; since the only 
titles which it can show &mdash; occupation and labor &mdash; prove as much for the 
proletaire who demands, as for the proprietor who defends.  Further, 
this possession is <hi rend="italic">dishonest</hi>, since it is founded on a 
violation of right, which prevents prescription, according to the saying of 
St. Paul &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Nunquam in usucapionibus juris error possessori 
prodest</hi>.  The violation of right lies either in the fact that the 
holder possesses as proprietor, while he should possess only as 
usufructuary; or in the fact that he has purchased a thing which no one 
had a right to transfer or sell. 
</p> 
<p>Another reason why prescription cannot be adduced in favor of 
property (a reason borrowed from jurisprudence) is that the right to 
possess real estate is a part of a universal right which has never been 
totally destroyed even at the most critical periods; and the proletaire, in 
order to regain the power to exercise it fully, has only to prove that he 
has always exercised it in part.  He, for example, who has the universal 
right to possess, give, exchange, loan, let, sell, transform, or destroy a 
thing, preserves the integrity of this right by the sole act of loaning, 
though he has never shown his authority in any other manner.  Likewise 
we shall see that <hi rend="italic">equality of possessions, equality of rights, 
liberty, will, personality</hi>, are so many identical expressions of 
one and the same idea, &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">right of preservation</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">development;</hi> in a word, the right of life, against which 
there can be no prescription until the human race has vanished from the 
face of the earth. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, as to the time required for prescription, it would be 
superfluous to show that the right of property in general cannot be 
acquired by simple possession for ten, twenty, a hundred, a thousand, or 
one hundred thousand years; and that, so long as there exists a human 
head capable of under<pb n="98"/>standing and combating the right of 
property, this right will never be prescribed.  For principles of 
jurisprudence and axioms of reason are different from accidental and 
contingent facts.  One man's possession can prescribe against another 
man's possession; but just as the possessor cannot prescribe against 
himself, so reason has always the faculty of change and reformation.  
Past error is not binding on the future.  Reason is always the same 
eternal force.  The institution of property, the work of ignorant reason, 
may be abrogated by a more enlightened reason.  Consequently, property 
cannot be established by prescription.  This is so certain and so true, that 
on it rests the maxim that in the matter of prescription a violation of 
right goes for nothing. 
</p> 
<p>But I should be recreant to my method, and the reader would have 
the right to accuse me of charlatanism and bad faith, if I had nothing 
further to advance concerning prescription.  I showed, in the first place, 
that appropriation of land is illegal; and that, supposing it to be legal, it 
must be accompanied by equality of property.  I have shown, in the 
second place, that universal consent proves nothing in favor of property; 
and that, if it proves any thing, it proves equality of property.  I have 
yet to show that prescription, if admissible at all, presupposes equality of 
property. 
</p> 
<p>This demonstration will be neither long nor difficult.  I need only 
to call attention to the reasons why prescription was introduced. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Prescription,&rdquo; says Dunod, &ldquo;seems 
repugnant to natural equity, which permits no one either to deprive 
another of his possessions without his knowledge and consent, or to 
enrich himself at another's expense.  But as it might often happen, in the 
absence of prescription, that one who had honestly earned would be 
ousted after long possession; and even that he who had received a thing 
from its rightful owner, or who had been legitimately relieved from all 
obligations, would, on losing his title, be <pb n="99"/>liable to be dispossessed 
or subjected again, &mdash; the public welfare demanded that a term should be 
fixed, after the expiration of which no one should be allowed to disturb 
actual possessors, or reassert rights too long neglected. . . .  The civil 
law, in regulating prescription, has aimed, then, only to perfect natural 
law, and to supplement the law of nations; and as it is founded on the 
public good, which should always be considered before individual 
welfare, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">bono publico usucapio introducta est</hi>, &mdash; it 
should be regarded with favor, provided the conditions required by the 
law are fulfilled.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Toullier, in his &ldquo;Civil Law,&rdquo; says:  &ldquo;In 
order that the question of proprietorship may not remain too long 
unsettled, and thereby injure the public welfare, disturbing the peace of 
families and the stability of social transactions, the law has fixed a time 
when all claims shall be cancelled, and possession shall regain its ancient 
prerogative through its transformation into property.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Cassiodorus said of property, that it was the only safe harbor in 
which to seek shelter from the tempests of chicanery and the gales of 
avarice &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Hic unus inter humanas pro cellas portus, quem si 
homines fervida voluntate praeterierint; in undosis semper jurgiis 
errabunt</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, in the opinion of the authors, prescription is a means of 
preserving public order; a restoration in certain cases of the original 
mode of acquiring property; a fiction of the civil law which derives all 
its force from the necessity of settling differences which otherwise would 
never end.  For, as Grotius says, time has no power to produce effects; 
all things happen in time, but nothing is done by time.  Prescription, or 
the right of acquisition through the lapse of time, is, therefore, a fiction 
of the law, conventionally adopted. 
</p> 
<p>But all property necessarily originated in prescription, or, as the 
Latins say, in <hi rend="italic">usucapion;</hi> that is, in continued possession.  
I ask, then, in the first place, how possession can become property by 
the lapse of time?  Continue possession as long as you wish, continue it 
for years and for centuries,  
<pb n="100"/> you never can give duration &mdash; which of itself creates 
nothing, changes nothing, modifies nothing &mdash; the power to change the 
usufructuary into a proprietor.  Let the civil law secure against chance-comers the honest possessor who has held his position for many years, &mdash; 
that only confirms a right already respected; and prescription, applied in 
this way, simply means that possession which has continued for twenty, 
thirty, or a hundred years shall be retained by the occupant.  But when 
the law declares that the lapse of time changes possessor into proprietor, 
it supposes that a right can be created without a producing cause; it 
unwarrantably alters the character of the subject; it legislates on a matter 
not open to legislation; it exceeds its own powers.  Public order and 
private security ask only that possession shall be protected.  Why has the 
law created property?  Prescription was simply security for the future; 
why has the law made it a matter of privilege? 
</p> 
<p>Thus the origin of prescription is identical with that of property 
itself; and since the latter can legitimate itself only when accompanied by 
equality, prescription is but another of the thousand forms which the 
necessity of maintaining this precious equality has taken.  And this is no 
vain induction, no far-fetched inference.  The proof is written in all the 
codes. 
</p> 
<p>And, indeed, if all nations, through their instinct of justice and 
their conservative nature, have recognized the utility and the necessity of 
prescription; and if their design has been to guard thereby the interests of 
the possessor, &mdash; could they not do something for the absent citizen, 
separated from his family and his country by commerce, war, or 
captivity, and in no position to exercise his right of possession?  No.  
Also, at the same time that prescription was introduced into the laws, 
 
<pb n="101"/> it was admitted that property is preserved by intent 
alone, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">nudo animo</hi>.  Now, if property is preserved by 
intent alone, if it can be lost only by the action of the proprietor, what 
can be the use of prescription?  How does the law dare to presume that 
the proprietor, who preserves by intent alone, intended to abandon that 
which he has allowed to be prescribed?  What lapse of time can warrant 
such a conjecture; and by what right does the law punish the absence of 
the proprietor by depriving him of his goods?  What then! we found but 
a moment since that prescription and property were identical; and now 
we find that they are mutually destructive! 
</p> 
<p>Grotius, who perceived this difficulty, replied so singularly that his 
words deserve to be quoted: <hi rend="italic"> Bene sperandum de hominibus, ac 
propterea non putandum eos hoc esse animo ut, rei caducae causa, 
hominem alterum velint in perpetuo peccato versari, quo d evitari saepe 
non poterit sine tali derelictione</hi>.  &ldquo;Where is the 
man,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;with so unchristian a soul that, for a 
trifle, he would perpetuate the trespass of a possessor, which would 
inevitably be the result if he did not consent to abandon his 
right?&rdquo;  By the Eternal!  I am that man.  Though a million 
proprietors should burn for it in hell, I lay the blame on them for 
depriving me of my portion of this world's goods.  To this powerful 
consideration Grotius rejoins, that it is better to abandon a disputed right 
than to go to law, disturb the peace of nations, and stir up the flames of 
civil war.  I accept, if you wish it, this argument, provided you 
indemnify me.  But if this indemnity is refused me, what do I, a 
proletaire, care for the tranquillity and security of the rich?  I care as 
little for <hi rend="italic">public order</hi> as for the proprietor's safety.  I ask 
to live a laborer; otherwise I will die a warrior. 
</p> 
<p>Whichever way we turn, we shall come to the conclusion 
 
<pb n="102"/> that prescription is a contradiction of property; or rather 
that prescription and property are two forms of the same principle, but 
two forms which serve to correct each other; and ancient and modern 
jurisprudence did not make the least of its blunders in pretending to 
reconcile them.  Indeed, if we see in the institution of property only a 
desire to secure to each individual his share of the soil and his right to 
labor; in the distinction between naked property and possession only an 
asylum for absentees, orphans, and all who do not know, or cannot 
maintain, their rights; in prescription only a means, either of defence 
against unjust pretensions and encroachments, or of settlement of the 
differences caused by the removal of possessors, &mdash; we shall recognize in 
these various forms of human justice the spontaneous efforts of the mind 
to come to the aid of the social instinct; we shall see in this protection of 
all rights the sentiment of equality, a constant levelling tendency.  And, 
looking deeper, we shall find in the very exaggeration of these principles 
the confirmation of our doctrine; because, if equality of conditions and 
universal association are not soon realized, it will be owing to the 
obstacle thrown for the time in the way of the common sense of the 
people by the stupidity of legislators and judges; and also to the fact that, 
while society in its original state was illuminated with a flash of truth, 
the early speculations of its leaders could bring forth nothing but 
darkness. 
</p> 
<p>After the first covenants, after the first draughts of laws and 
constitutions, which were the expression of man's primary needs, the 
legislator's duty was to reform the errors of legislation; to complete that 
which was defective; to harmonize, by superior definitions, those things 
which seemed to conflict.  Instead of that, they halted at the literal 
meaning of the laws, content to play the subordinate part of 
commentators and  
<pb n="103"/> scholiasts.  Taking the inspirations of the human mind, 
at that time necessarily weak and faulty, for axioms of eternal and 
unquestionable truth, &mdash; influenced by public opinion, enslaved by the 
popular religion, &mdash; they have invariably started with the principle 
(following in this respect the example of the theologians) that that is 
infallibly true which has been admitted by all persons, in all places, and 
at all times &mdash; <hi rend="italic">quod ab omnibus, quod ubique, quod 
semper;</hi> as if a general but spontaneous opinion was any thing 
more than an indication of the truth.  Let us not be deceived: the opinion 
of all nations may serve to authenticate the perception of a fact, the 
vague sentiment of a law; it can teach us nothing about either fact or 
law.  The consent of mankind is an indication of Nature; not, as Cicero 
says, a law of Nature.  Under the indication is hidden the truth, which 
faith can believe, but only thought can know.  Such has been the

&sect; 4. &mdash; LABOR &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That Labor has no Inherent Power to 
appropriate Natural Wealth</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>We shall show by the maxims of political economy and law, that 
is, by the authorities recognized by property, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>1. That labor has no inherent power to appropriate natural wealth. 
</p> 
<p>2. That, if we admit that labor has this power, we are led directly 
to equality of property, &mdash; whatever the kind of labor, however scarce the 
product, or unequal the ability of the laborers. 
</p> 
<p>3. That, in the order of justice, labor <hi rend="italic">destroys</hi> 
property. 
</p> 
<p>Following the example of our opponents, and that we may 
 
<pb n="104"/> leave no obstacles in the path, let us examine the 
question in the strongest possible light. 
</p> 
<p>M. Ch. Comte says, in his &ldquo;Treatise on Property:&rdquo; 
&mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;France, considered as a nation, has a territory which is 
her own.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>France, as an individuality, possesses a territory which she 
cultivates; it is not her property.  Nations are related to each other as 
individuals are: they are commoners and workers; it is an abuse of 
language to call them proprietors.  The right of use and abuse belongs no 
more to nations than to men; and the time will come when a war waged 
for the purpose of checking a nation in its abuse of the soil will be 
regarded as a holy war. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, M. Ch. Comte &mdash; who undertakes to explain how property 
comes into existence, and who starts with the supposition that a nation is 
a proprietor &mdash; falls into that error known as <hi rend="italic">begging the 
question;</hi> a mistake which vitiates his whole argument. 
</p> 
<p>If the reader thinks it is pushing logic too far to question a nation's 
right of property in the territory which it possesses, I will simply remind 
him of the fact that at all ages the results of the fictitious right of 
national property have been pretensions to suzerainty, tributes, 
monarchical privileges, statute-labor, quotas of men and money, supplies 
of merchandise, &amp;c.; ending finally in refusals to pay taxes, 
insurrections, wars, and depopulations. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Scattered through this territory are extended tracts of land, 
which have not been converted into individual property.  These lands, 
which consist mainly of forests, belong to the whole population, and the 
government, which receives the revenues, uses or ought to use them in 
the interest of all.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Ought to use</hi> is well said: a lie is avoided thereby. 
 
 
<pb n="105"/>  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Let them be offered for sale. . . .&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Why offered for sale?  Who has a right to sell them?  Even were 
the nation proprietor, can the generation of to-day dispossess the 
generation of to-morrow?  The nation, in its function of usufructuary, 
possesses them; the government rules, superintends, and protects them.  
If it also granted lands, it could grant only their use; it has no right to 
sell them or transfer them in any way whatever.  Not being a proprietor, 
how can it transmit property? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Suppose some industrious man buys a portion, a large 
swamp for example.  This would be no usurpation, since the public 
would receive the exact value through the hands of the government, and 
would be as rich after the sale as before.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>How ridiculous!  What! because a prodigal, imprudent, 
incompetent official sells the State's possessions, while I, a ward of the 
State, &mdash; I who have neither an advisory nor a deliberative voice in the 
State councils, &mdash; while I am allowed to make no opposition to the sale, 
this sale is right and legal!  The guardians of the nation waste its 
substance, and it has no redress!  I have received, you tell me, through 
the hands of the government my share of the proceeds of the sale: but, in 
the first place, I did not wish to sell; and, had I wished to, I could not 
have sold.  I had not the right.  And then I do not see that I am 
benefited by the sale.  My guardians have dressed up some soldiers, 
repaired an old fortress, erected in their pride some costly but worthless 
monument, &mdash; then they have exploded some fireworks and set up a 
greased pole!  What does all that amount to in comparison with my loss? 
</p> 
<p>The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 
&ldquo;This is mine; each one by himself, each one for 
himself.&rdquo;  Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, 
 
<pb n="106"/> no one has a right to step, save the proprietor and his 
friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants.  
Let these sales multiply, and soon the people &mdash; who have been neither 
able nor willing to sell, and who have received none of the proceeds of 
the sale &mdash; will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to 
till.  They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that 
property which was their birthright; and the proprietor, watching them 
die, will exclaim, &ldquo;So perish idlers and vagrants!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>To reconcile us to the proprietor's usurpation, M. Ch. Comte 
assumes the lands to be of little value at the time of sale. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The importance of these usurpations should not be 
exaggerated: they should be measured by the number of men which the 
occupied land would support, and by the means which it would furnish 
them.  It is evident, for instance, that if a piece of land which is worth 
to-day one thousand francs was worth only five centimes when it was 
usurped, we really lose only the value of five centimes.  A square league 
of earth would be hardly sufficient to support a savage in distress; to-day 
it supplies one thousand persons with the means of existence.  Nine 
hundred and ninety-nine parts of this land is the legitimate property of 
the possessors; only one-thousandth of the value has been 
usurped.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>A peasant admitted one day, at confession, that he had destroyed a 
document which declared him a debtor to the amount of three hundred 
francs.  Said the father confessor, &ldquo;You must return these three 
hundred francs.&rdquo;  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the peasant, 
&ldquo;I will return a penny to pay for the paper.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>M. Ch. Comte's logic resembles this peasant's honesty.  The soil 
has not only an integrant and actual value, it has also a potential value, --a value of the future, &mdash; which depends on our ability to make it 
valuable, and to employ it in our work.  Destroy a bill of exchange, a 
promissory note,  
<pb n="107"/> an annuity deed, &mdash; as a paper you destroy almost no 
value at all; but with this paper you destroy your title, and, in losing 
your title, you deprive yourself of your goods.  Destroy the land, or, 
what is the same thing, sell it, &mdash; you not only transfer one, two, or 
several crops, but you annihilate all the products that you could derive 
from it; you and your children and your children's children. 
</p> 
<p>When M. Ch. Comte, the apostle of property and the eulogist of 
labor, supposes an alienation of the soil on the part of the government, 
we must not think that he does so without reason and for no purpose; it 
is a necessary part of his position.  As he rejected the theory of 
occupancy, and as he knew, moreover, that labor could not constitute the 
right in the absence of a previous permission to occupy, he was obliged 
to connect this permission with the authority of the government, which 
means that property is based upon the sovereignty of the people; in other 
words, upon universal consent.  This theory we have already considered. 
</p> 
<p>To say that property is the daughter of labor, and then to give 
labor material on which to exercise itself, is, if I am not mistaken, to 
reason in a circle.  Contradictions will result from it. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A piece of land of a certain size produces food enough to 
supply a man for one day.  If the possessor, through his labor, discovers 
some method of making it produce enough for two days, he doubles its 
value.  This new value is his work, his creation: it is taken from nobody; 
it is his property.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>I maintain that the possessor is paid for his trouble and industry in 
his doubled crop, but that he acquires no right to the land.  &ldquo;Let 
the laborer have the fruits of his labor.&rdquo;  Very good; but I do not 
understand that property in products carries with it property in raw 
material.  Does the skill of the  
<pb n="108"/> fisherman, who on the same coast can catch more fish 
than his fellows, make him proprietor of the fishing-grounds?  Can the 
expertness of a hunter ever be regarded as a property-title to a game-forest?  The analogy is perfect, &mdash; the industrious cultivator finds the 
reward of his industry in the abundancy and superiority of his crop.  If 
he has made improvements in the soil, he has the possessor's right of 
preference.  Never, under any circumstances, can he be allowed to claim 
a property-title to the soil which he cultivates, on the ground of his skill 
as a cultivator. 
</p> 
<p>To change possession into property, something is needed besides 
labor, without which a man would cease to be proprietor as soon as he 
ceased to be a laborer.  Now, the law bases property upon immemorial, 
unquestionable possession; that is, prescription.  Labor is only the 
sensible sign, the physical act, by which occupation is manifested.  If, 
then, the cultivator remains proprietor after he has ceased to labor and 
produce; if his possession, first conceded, then tolerated, finally becomes 
inalienable, &mdash; it happens by permission of the civil law, and by virtue of 
the principle of occupancy.  So true is this, that there is not a bill of 
sale, not a farm lease, not an annuity, but implies it.  I will quote only 
one example. 
</p> 
<p>How do we measure the value of land?  By its product.  If a piece 
of land yields one thousand francs, we say that at five per cent. it is 
worth twenty thousand francs; at four per cent. twenty-five thousand 
francs, &amp;c.; which means, in other words, that in twenty or twenty-five 
years' time the purchaser would recover in full the amount originally 
paid for the land.  If, then, after a certain length of time, the price of a 
piece of land has been wholly recovered, why does the purchaser 
continue to be proprietor?  Because of the right of  
<pb n="109"/> occupancy, in the absence of which every sale would be 
a redemption. 
</p> 
<p>The theory of appropriation by labor is, then, a contradiction of 
the Code; and when the partisans of this theory pretend to explain the 
laws thereby, they contradict themselves. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If men succeed in fertilizing land hitherto unproductive, or 
even death-producing, like certain swamps, they create thereby property 
in all its completeness.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>What good does it do to magnify an expression, and play with 
equivocations, as if we expected to change the reality thereby?  
<hi rend="italic">They create property in all its completeness</hi>.  You mean 
that they create a productive capacity which formerly did not exist; but 
this capacity cannot be created without material to support it.  The 
substance of the soil remains the same; only its qualities and 
modifications are changed.  Man has created every thing &mdash; every thing 
save the material itself.  Now, I maintain that this material he can only 
possess and use, on condition of permanent labor, &mdash; granting, for the 
time being, his right of property in things which he has produced. 
</p> 
<p>This, then, is the first point settled: property in product, if we 
grant so much, does not carry with it property in the means of 
production; that seems to me to need no further demonstration.  There is 
no difference between the soldier who possesses his arms, the mason 
who possesses the materials committed to his care, the fisherman who 
possesses the water, the hunter who possesses the fields and forests, and 
the cultivator who possesses the lands: all, if you say so, are proprietors 
of their products &mdash; not one is proprietor of the means of production.  
The right to product is exclusive &mdash; <hi rend="italic">jus in re;</hi> the right to 
means is common &mdash; <hi rend="italic">jus ad rem</hi>. 
 
 
 
<pb n="110"/>  
&sect; 5. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That Labor leads to Equality of Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Admit, however, that labor gives a right of property in material.  
Why is not this principle universal?  Why is the benefit of this pretended 
law confined to a few and denied to the mass of laborers?  A 
philosopher, arguing that all animals sprang up formerly out of the earth 
warmed by the rays of the sun, almost like mushrooms, on being asked 
why the earth no longer yielded crops of that nature, replied:  
&ldquo;Because it is old, and has lost its fertility.&rdquo;  Has labor, 
once so fecund, likewise become sterile?  Why does the tenant no longer 
acquire through his labor the land which was formerly acquired by the 
labor of the proprietor? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;it is already 
appropriated.&rdquo;  That is no answer.  A farm yields fifty bushels 
per <hi rend="italic">hectare;</hi> the skill and labor of the tenant double this 
product: the increase is created by the tenant.  Suppose the owner, in a 
spirit of moderation rarely met with, does not go to the extent of 
absorbing this product by raising the rent, but allows the cultivator to 
enjoy the results of his labor; even then justice is not satisfied.  The 
tenant, by improving the land, has imparted a new value to the property; 
he, therefore, has a right to a part of the property.  If the farm was 
originally worth one hundred thousand francs, and if by the labor of the 
tenant its value has risen to one hundred and fifty thousand francs, the 
tenant, who produced this extra value, is the legitimate proprietor of one-third of the farm.  M. Ch. Comte could not have pronounced this 
doctrine false, for it was he who said: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Men who increase the fertility of the earth are no less 
useful to their fellow-men, than if they should create new land.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Why, then, is not this rule applicable to the man who im 
<pb n="111"/> proves the land, as well as to him who clears it?  The 
labor of the former makes the land worth one; that of the latter makes it 
worth two: both create equal values.  Why not accord to both equal 
property?  I defy any one to refute this argument, without again falling 
back on the right of first occupancy. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it will be said, &ldquo;even if your wish 
should be granted, property would not be distributed much more evenly 
than now.  Land does not go on increasing in value for ever; after two 
or three seasons it attains its maximum fertility.  That which is added by 
the agricultural art results rather from the progress of science and the 
diffusion of knowledge, than from the skill of the cultivator.  
Consequently, the addition of a few laborers to the mass of proprietors 
would be no argument against property.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>This discussion would, indeed, prove a well-nigh useless one, if 
our labors culminated in simply extending land-privilege and industrial 
monopoly; in emancipating only a few hundred laborers out of the 
millions of proletaires.  But this also is a misconception of our real 
thought, and does but prove the general lack of intelligence and logic. 
</p> 
<p>If the laborer, who adds to the value of a thing, has a right of 
property in it, he who maintains this value acquires the same right.  For 
what is maintenance?  It is incessant addition, &mdash; continuous creation.  
What is it to cultivate?  It is to give the soil its value every year; it is, 
by annually renewed creation, to prevent the diminution or destruction of 
the value of a piece of land.  Admitting, then, that property is rational 
and legitimate, &mdash; admitting that rent is equitable and just, &mdash; I say that he 
who cultivates acquires property by as good a title as he who clears, or 
he who improves; and that every time a tenant pays his rent, he obtains a 
fraction of  
<pb n="112"/> property in the land entrusted to his care, the 
denominator of which is equal to the proportion of rent paid.  Unless 
you admit this, you fall into absolutism and tyranny; you recognize class 
privileges; you sanction slavery. 
</p> 
<p>Whoever labors becomes a proprietor &mdash; this is an inevitable 
deduction from the acknowledged principles of political economy and 
jurisprudence.  And when I say proprietor, I do not mean simply (as do 
our hypocritical economists) proprietor of his allowance, his salary, his 
wages, &mdash; I mean proprietor of the value which he creates, and by which 
the master alone profits. 
</p> 
<p>As all this relates to the theory of wages and of the distribution of 
products, &mdash; and as this matter never has been even partially cleared up, --I ask permission to insist on it: this discussion will not be useless to the 
work in hand.  Many persons talk of admitting working-people to a share 
in the products and profits; but in their minds this participation is pure 
benevolence: they have never shown &mdash; perhaps never suspected &mdash; that it 
was a natural, necessary right, inherent in labor, and inseparable from 
the function of producer, even in the lowest forms of his work. 
</p> 
<p>This is my proposition:  <hi rend="italic">The laborer retains, even  after he 
has received his wages, a natural right of property in the thing which he 
has produced</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>I again quote M. Ch. Comte: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Some laborers are employed in draining marshes, in 
cutting down trees and brushwood, &mdash; in a word, in cleaning up the soil.  
They increase the value, they make the amount of property larger; they 
are paid for the value which they add in the form of food and daily 
wages: it then becomes the property of the capitalist.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>The price is not sufficient: the labor of the workers has created a 
value; now this value is their property.  But they  
<pb n="113"/> have neither sold nor exchanged it; and you, capitalist, 
you have not earned it.  That you should have a partial right to the 
whole, in return for the materials that you have furnished and the 
provisions that you have supplied, is perfectly just.  You contributed to 
the production, you ought to share in the enjoyment.  But your right 
does not annihilate that of the laborers, who, in spite of you, have been 
your colleagues in the work of production.  Why do you talk of wages?  
The money with which you pay the wages of the laborers remunerates 
them for only a few years of the perpetual possession which they have 
abandoned to you.  Wages is the cost of the daily maintenance and 
refreshment of the laborer.  You are wrong in calling it the price of a 
sale.  The workingman has sold nothing; he knows neither his right, nor 
the extent of the concession which he has made to you, nor the meaning 
of the contract which you pretend to have made with him.  On his side, 
utter ignorance; on yours, error and surprise, not to say deceit and 
fraud. 
</p> 
<p>Let us make this clearer by another and more striking example. 
</p> 
<p>No one is ignorant of the difficulties that are met with in the 
conversion of untilled land into arable and productive land.  These 
difficulties are so great, that usually an isolated man would perish before 
he could put the soil in a condition to yield him even the most meagre 
living.  To that end are needed the united and combined efforts of 
society, and all the resources of industry.  M. Ch. Comte quotes on this 
subject numerous and well-authenticated facts, little thinking that he is 
amassing testimony against his own system. 
</p> 
<p>Let us suppose that a colony of twenty or thirty families establishes 
itself in a wild district, covered with underbrush and forests; and from 
which, by agreement, the natives con 
<pb n="114"/> sent to withdraw.  Each one of these families possesses 
a moderate but sufficient amount of capital, of such a nature as a colonist 
would be apt to choose, &mdash; animals, seeds, tools, and a little money and 
food.  The land having been divided, each one settles himself as 
comfortably as possible, and begins to clear away the portion allotted to 
him.  But after a few weeks of fatigue, such as they never before have 
known, of inconceivable suffering, of ruinous and almost useless labor, 
our colonists begin to complain of their trade; their condition seems hard 
to them; they curse their sad existence. 
</p> 
<p>Suddenly, one of the shrewdest among them kills a pig, cures a 
part of the meat; and, resolved to sacrifice the rest of his provisions, 
goes to find his companions in misery.  &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; he 
begins in a very benevolent tone, &ldquo;how much trouble it costs you 
to do a little work and live uncomfortably!  A fortnight of labor has 
reduced you to your last extremity! . . .  Let us make an arrangement by 
which you shall all profit.  I offer you provisions and wine: you shall get 
so much every day; we will work together, and, zounds! my friends, we 
will be happy and contented!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Would it be possible for empty stomachs to resist such an 
invitation?  The hungriest of them follow the treacherous tempter.  They 
go to work; the charm of society, emulation, joy, and mutual assistance 
double their strength; the work can be seen to advance.  Singing and 
laughing, they subdue Nature.  In a short time, the soil is thoroughly 
changed; the mellowed earth waits only for the seed.  That done, the 
proprietor pays his laborers, who, on going away, return him their 
thanks, and grieve that the happy days which they have spent with him 
are over. 
</p> 
<p>Others follow this example, always with the same success.  
 
<pb n="115"/> Then, these installed, the rest disperse, &mdash; each one 
returns to his grubbing.  But, while grubbing, it is necessary to live.  
While they have been clearing away for their neighbor, they have done 
no clearing for themselves.  One year's seed-time and harvest is already 
gone.  They had calculated that in lending their labor they could not but 
gain, since they would save their own provisions; and, while living 
better, would get still more money.  False calculation! they have created 
for another the means wherewith to produce, and have created nothing 
for themselves.  The difficulties of clearing remain the same; their 
clothing wears out, their provisions give out; soon their purse becomes 
empty for the profit of the individual for whom they have worked, and 
who alone can furnish the provisions which they need, since he alone is 
in a position to produce them.  Then, when the poor grubber has 
exhausted his resources, the man with the provisions (like the wolf in the 
fable, who scents his victim from afar) again comes forward.  One he 
offers to employ again by the day; from another he offers to buy at a 
favorable price a piece of his bad land, which is not, and never can be, 
of any use to him: that is, he uses the labor of one man to cultivate the 
field of another for his own benefit.  So that at the end of twenty years, 
of thirty individuals originally equal in point of wealth, five or six have 
become proprietors of the whole district, while the rest have been 
philanthropically dispossessed! 
</p> 
<p>In this century of <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> morality, in which I 
have had the honor to be born, the moral sense is so debased that I 
should not be at all surprised if I were asked, by many a worthy 
proprietor, what I see in this that is unjust and illegitimate?  Debased 
creature! galvanized corpse! how can I expect to convince you, if you 
cannot tell robbery when I  
<pb n="116"/> show it to you?  A man, by soft and insinuating words, 
discovers the secret of taxing others that he may establish himself; then, 
once enriched by their united efforts, he refuses, on the very conditions 
which he himself dictated, to advance the well-being of those who made 
his fortune for him: and you ask how such conduct is fraudulent!  Under 
the pretext that he has paid his laborers, that he owes them nothing 
more, that he has nothing to gain by putting himself at the service of 
others, while his own occupations claim his attention, &mdash; he refuses, I 
say, to aid others in getting a foothold, as he was aided in getting his 
own; and when, in the impotence of their isolation, these poor laborers 
are compelled to sell their birthright, he &mdash; this ungrateful proprietor, this 
knavish upstart &mdash; stands ready to put the finishing touch to their 
deprivation and their ruin.  And you think that just?  Take care!  I read 
in your startled countenance the reproach of a guilty conscience, much 
more clearly than the innocent astonishment of involuntary ignorance. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The capitalist,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;has paid the 
laborers their <hi rend="italic">daily wages</hi>.&rdquo;  To be accurate, it 
must be said that the capitalist has paid as many times one day's wage as 
he has employed laborers each day, &mdash; which is not at all the same thing.  
For he has paid nothing for that immense power which results from the 
union and harmony of laborers, and the convergence and 
simultaneousness of their efforts.  Two hundred grenadiers stood the 
obelisk of Luxor upon its base in a few hours; do you suppose that one 
man could have accomplished the same task in two hundred days?  
Nevertheless, on the books of the capitalist, the amount of wages paid 
would have been the same.  Well, a desert to prepare for cultivation, a 
house to build, a factory to run, &mdash; all these are obelisks to erect, 
mountains to move.  The smallest fortune,  
<pb n="117"/> the most insignificant establishment, the setting in 
motion of the lowest industry, demand the concurrence of so many 
different kinds of labor and skill, that one man could not possibly 
execute the whole of them.  It is astonishing that the economists never 
have called attention to this fact.  Strike a balance, then, between the 
capitalist's receipts and his payments. 
</p> 
<p>The laborer needs a salary which will enable him to live while he 
works; for unless he consumes, he cannot produce.  Whoever employs a 
man owes him maintenance and support, or wages enough to procure the 
same.  That is the first thing to be done in all production.  I admit, for 
the moment, that in this respect the capitalist has discharged his duty. 
</p> 
<p>It is necessary that the laborer should find in his production, in 
addition to his present support, a guarantee of his future support; 
otherwise the source of production would dry up, and his productive 
capacity would become exhausted: in other words, the labor 
accomplished must give birth perpetually to new labor &mdash; such is the 
universal law of reproduction.  In this way, the proprietor of a farm 
finds:  1. In his crops, means, not only of supporting himself and his 
family, but of maintaining and improving his capital, of feeding his live-stock &mdash; in a word, means of new labor and continual reproduction; 2. In 
his ownership of a productive agency, a permanent basis of cultivation 
and labor. 
</p> 
<p>But he who lends his services, &mdash; what is his basis of cultivation?  
The proprietor's presumed need of him, and the unwarranted supposition 
that he wishes to employ him.  Just as the commoner once held his land 
by the munificence and condescension of the lord, so to-day the working-man holds his labor by the condescension and necessities of the master 
and proprietor: that is what is called possession by  
<pb n="118"/> a precarious[1] title.  But this precarious condition is an 
injustice, for it implies an inequality in the bargain.  The laborer's wages 
exceed but little his running expenses, and do not assure him wages for 
to-morrow; while the capitalist finds in the instrument produced by the 
laborer a pledge of independence and security for the future. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this reproductive leaven &mdash; this eternal germ of life, this 
preparation of the land and manufacture of implements for production &mdash; 
constitutes the debt of the capitalist to the producer, which he never 
pays; and it is this fraudulent denial which causes the poverty of the 
laborer, the luxury of idleness, and the inequality of conditions.  This it 
is, above all other things, which has been so fitly named the exploitation 
of man by man. 
</p> 
<p>One of three things must be done.  Either the laborer must be 
given a portion of the product in addition to his wages; or the employer 
must render the laborer an equivalent in productive service; or else he 
must pledge himself to employ him for ever.  Division of the product, 
reciprocity of service, or guarantee of perpetual labor, &mdash; from the 
adoption of one of these courses the capitalist cannot escape.  But it is 
evident that he cannot satisfy the second and third of these conditions &mdash; 
he can neither put himself at the service of the thousands of working-men, who, directly or indirectly, have aided him in establishing himself, 
nor employ them all for ever.  He has no other course left him, then, but 
a division of the property.  But if the property is divided, all conditions 
will be equal &mdash; there will be no more large capitalists or large 
proprietors. 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] Precarious, from precor, &ldquo;I pray;&rdquo; because the 
act of concession expressly signified that the lord, in answer to the 
prayers of his men or slaves, had granted them permission to labor. 
 
 
 
<pb n="119"/>  
</p> 
<p>Consequently, when M. Ch. Comte &mdash; following out his hypothesis 
&mdash; shows us his capitalist acquiring one after another the products of his 
employees' labor, he sinks deeper and deeper into the mire; and, as his 
argument does not change, our reply of course remains the same. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Other laborers are employed in building: some quarry the 
stone, others transport it, others cut it, and still others put it in place.  
Each of them adds a certain value to the material which passes through 
his hands; and this value, the product of his labor, is his property.  He 
sells it, as fast as he creates it, to the proprietor of the building, who 
pays him for it in food and wages.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Divide et impera</hi> &mdash; divide, and you shall command; 
divide, and you shall grow rich; divide, and you shall deceive men, you 
shall daze their minds, you shall mock at justice!  Separate laborers from 
each other, perhaps each one's daily wage exceeds the value of each 
individual's product; but that is not the question under consideration.  A 
force of one thousand men working twenty days has been paid the same 
wages that one would be paid for working fifty-five years; but this force 
of one thousand has done in twenty days what a single man could not 
have accomplished, though he had labored for a million centuries.  Is the 
exchange an equitable one?  Once more, no; when you have paid all the 
individual forces, the collective force still remains to be paid.  
Consequently, there remains always a right of collective property which 
you have not acquired, and which you enjoy unjustly. 
</p> 
<p>Admit that twenty days' wages suffice to feed, lodge, and clothe 
this multitude for twenty days: thrown out of employment at the end of 
that time, what will become of them, if, as fast as they create, they 
abandon their creations to the proprietors who will soon discharge them?  
While the proprietor, firm in his position (thanks to the aid of all the 
laborers),  
<pb n="120"/> dwells in security, and fears no lack of labor or bread, 
the laborer's only dependence is upon the benevolence of this same 
proprietor, to whom he has sold and surrendered his liberty.  If, then, 
the proprietor, shielding himself behind his comfort and his rights, 
refuses to employ the laborer, how can the laborer live?  He has 
ploughed an excellent field, and cannot sow it; he has built an elegant 
and commodious house, and cannot live in it; he has produced all, and 
can enjoy nothing 
</p> 
<p>Labor leads us to equality.  Every step that we take brings us 
nearer to it; and if laborers had equal strength, diligence, and industry, 
clearly their fortunes would be equal also.  Indeed, if, as is pretended, &mdash; 
and as we have admitted, &mdash; the laborer is proprietor of the value which 
he creates, it follows: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>1. That the laborer acquires at the expense of the idle proprietor; 
</p> 
<p>2. That all production being necessarily collective, the laborer is 
entitled to a share of the products and profits commensurate with his 
labor; 
</p> 
<p>3. That all accumulated capital being social property, no one can 
be its exclusive proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>These inferences are unavoidable; these alone would suffice to 
revolutionize our whole economical system, and change our institutions 
and our laws.  Why do the very persons, who laid down this principle, 
now refuse to be guided by it?  Why do the Says, the Comtes, the 
Hennequins, and others &mdash; after having said that property is born of labor 
&mdash; seek to fix it by occupation and prescription? 
</p> 
<p>But let us leave these sophists to their contradictions and blindness.  
The good sense of the people will do justice to their equivocations.  Let 
us make haste to enlighten it, and  
<pb n="121"/> show it the true path.  Equality approaches; already 
between it and us but a short distance intervenes: to-morrow even this 
distance will have been traversed. 
 
 
&sect; 6. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That in Society all Wages are Equal</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>When the St. Simonians, the Fourierists, and, in general, all who 
in our day are connected with social economy and reform, inscribe upon 
their banner, &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capacity, to each capacity 
according to its results&rdquo; <hi rend="italic">(St. Simon)</hi>; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capital, his labor, and his 
skill&rdquo; (<hi rend="italic">Fourier)</hi>, &mdash;  
 
they mean &mdash; although they do not say so in so many words &mdash; that the 
products of Nature procured by labor and industry are a reward, a palm, 
a crown offered to all kinds of preeminence and superiority.  They 
regard the land as an immense arena in which prizes are contended for, --no longer, it is true, with lances and swords, by force and by 
treachery; but by acquired wealth, by knowledge, talent, and by virtue 
itself.  In a word, they mean &mdash; and everybody agrees with them &mdash; that 
the greatest capacity is entitled to the greatest reward; and, to use the 
mercantile phraseology, &mdash; which has, at least, the merit of being 
straightforward, &mdash; that salaries must be governed by capacity and its 
results. 
</p> 
<p>The disciples of these two self-styled reformers cannot deny that 
such is their thought; for, in doing so, they would contradict their 
official interpretations, and would destroy the unity of their systems.  
Furthermore, such a denial on their part is not to be feared.  The two 
sects glory in laying down as a principle inequality of conditions, &mdash; 
reasoning from Nature, who, they say, intended the inequality of 
capacities.  They boast only of one thing; namely, that their political 
system is so perfect, that the social inequalities always corre 
<pb n="122"/> spond with the natural inequalities.  They no more 
trouble themselves to inquire whether inequality of conditions &mdash; I mean 
of salaries &mdash; is possible, than they do to fix a measure of capacity.[1] 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capacity, to each capacity 
according to its results.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capital, his labor, and his 
skill.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Since the death of St. Simon and Fourier, not one among their 
numerous disciples has attempted to give to the public a scientific 
demonstration of this grand maxim; and I would wager a hundred to one 
that no Fourierist even suspects that this biform aphorism is susceptible 
of two interpretations. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capacity, to each capacity 
according to its results.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To each according to his capital, his labor, and his 
skill.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>This proposition, taken, as they say, <hi rend="italic">in sensu obvio</hi> --in the sense usually attributed to it &mdash; is false, absurd, unjust, 
contradictory, hostile to liberty, friendly to tyranny, anti-social, and was 
unluckily framed under the express influence of the property idea. 
</p> 
<p>And, first, <hi rend="italic">capital</hi> must be crossed off the list of 
elements which are entitled to a reward.  The Fourierists &mdash; as far as I 
have been able to learn from a few of their pamphlets &mdash; deny the right 
of occupancy, and recognize no basis of property save labor.  Starting 
with a like premise, they would have seen &mdash; had they reasoned upon the 
matter &mdash; that capital is a 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] In St. Simon's system, the St.-Simonian priest determines the 
capacity of each by virtue of his pontifical infallibility, in imitation of the 
Roman Church: in Fourier's, the ranks and merits are decided by vote, 
in imitation of the constitutional <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>.  Clearly, 
the great man is an object of ridicule to the reader; he did not mean to 
tell his secret. 
 
 
 
<pb n="123"/> source of production to its proprietor only by virtue of 
the right of occupancy, and that this production is therefore illegitimate.  
Indeed, if labor is the sole basis of property, I cease to be proprietor of 
my field as soon as I receive rent for it from another.  This we have 
shown beyond all cavil.  It is the same with all capital; so that to put 
capital in an enterprise, is, by the law's decision, to exchange it for an 
equivalent sum in products.  I will not enter again upon this now useless 
discussion, since I propose, in the following chapter, to exhaust the 
subject of <hi rend="italic">production by capital</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, capital can be exchanged, but cannot be a source of income. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Labor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">skill</hi> remain; or, as St. 
Simon puts it, <hi rend="italic">results</hi> and <hi rend="italic">capacities</hi>.  I will 
examine them successively. 
</p> 
<p>Should wages be governed by labor?  In other words, is it just that 
he who does the most should get the most?  I beg the reader to pay the 
closest attention to this point. 
</p> 
<p>To solve the problem with one stroke, we have only to ask 
ourselves the following question:  &ldquo;Is labor a 
<hi rend="italic">condition</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">struggle</hi>?  &ldquo;The reply 
seems plain. 
</p> 
<p>God said to man, &ldquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat 
bread,&rdquo; &mdash; that is, thou shalt produce thy own bread: with more 
or less ease, according to thy skill in directing and combining thy 
efforts, thou shalt labor.  God did not say, &ldquo;Thou shalt quarrel 
with thy neighbor for thy bread;&rdquo; but, &ldquo;Thou shalt labor 
by the side of thy neighbor, and ye shall dwell together in 
harmony.&rdquo;  Let us develop the meaning of this law, the extreme 
simplicity of which renders it liable to misconstruction. 
</p> 
<p>In labor, two things must be noticed and distinguished: 
<hi rend="italic">association</hi> and <hi rend="italic">available material</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>In so far as laborers are associated, they are equal; and it 
 
<pb n="124"/> involves a contradiction to say that one should be paid 
more than another.  For, as the product of one laborer can be paid for 
only in the product of another laborer, if the two products are unequal, 
the remainder &mdash; or the difference between the greater and the smaller &mdash; 
will not be acquired by society; and, therefore, not being exchanged, 
will not affect the equality of wages.  There will result, it is true, in 
favor of the stronger laborer a natural inequality, but not a social 
inequality; no one having suffered by his strength and productive energy.  
In a word, society exchanges only equal products &mdash; that is, rewards no 
labor save that performed for her benefit; consequently, she pays all 
laborers equally: with what they produce outside of her sphere she has 
no more to do, than with the difference in their voices and their hair. 
</p> 
<p>I seem to be positing the principle of inequality: the reverse of this 
is the truth.  The total amount of labor which can be performed for 
society (that is, of labor susceptible of exchange), being, within a given 
space, as much greater as the laborers are more numerous, and as the 
task assigned to each is less in magnitude, &mdash; it follows that natural 
inequality neutralizes itself in proportion as association extends, and as 
the quantity of consumable values produced thereby increases.  So that in 
society the only thing which could bring back the inequality of labor 
would be the right of occupancy, &mdash; the right of property. 
</p> 
<p>Now, suppose that this daily social task consists in the ploughing, 
hoeing, or reaping of two square decameters, and that the average time 
required to accomplish it is seven hours: one laborer will finish it in six 
hours, another will require eight; the majority, however, will work 
seven.  But provided each one furnishes the quantity of labor demanded 
of him, whatever be the time he employs, they are entitled to equal 
wages. 
 
<pb n="125"/>  
</p> 
<p>Shall the laborer who is capable of finishing his task in six hours 
have the right, on the ground of superior strength and activity, to usurp 
the task of the less skilful laborer, and thus rob him of his labor and 
bread?  Who dares maintain such a proposition?  He who finishes before 
the others may rest, if he chooses; he may devote himself to useful 
exercise and labors for the maintenance of his strength, and the culture 
of his mind, and the pleasure of his life.  This he can do without injury 
to any one: but let him confine himself to services which affect him 
solely.  Vigor, genius, diligence, and all the personal advantages which 
result therefrom, are the work of Nature and, to a certain extent, of the 
individual; society awards them the esteem which they merit: but the 
wages which it pays them is measured, not by their power, but by their 
production.  Now, the product of each is limited by the right of all. 
</p> 
<p>If the soil were infinite in extent, and the amount of available 
material were exhaustless, even then we could not accept this maxim, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">To each according to his labor</hi>.  And why?  Because 
society, I repeat, whatever be the number of its subjects, is forced to pay 
them all the same wages, since she pays them only in their own 
products.  Only, on the hypothesis just made, inasmuch as the strong 
cannot be prevented from using all their advantages, the inconveniences 
of natural inequality would reappear in the very bosom of social equality.  
But the land, considering the productive power of its inhabitants and 
their ability to multiply, is very limited; further, by the immense variety 
of products and the extreme division of labor, the social task is made 
easy of accomplishment.  Now, through this limitation of things 
producible, and through the ease of producing them, the law of absolute 
equality takes effect. 
 
<pb n="126"/>  
</p> 
<p>Yes, life is a struggle.  But this struggle is not between man and 
man &mdash; it is between man and Nature; and it is each one's duty to take 
his share in it.  If, in the struggle, the strong come to the aid of the 
weak, their kindness deserves praise and love; but their aid must be 
accepted as a free gift, &mdash; not imposed by force, nor offered at a price.  
All have the same career before them, neither too long nor too difficult; 
whoever finishes it finds his reward at the end: it is not necessary to get 
there first. 
</p> 
<p>In printing-offices, where the laborers usually work by the job, the 
compositor receives so much per thousand letters set; the pressman so 
much per thousand sheets printed.  There, as elsewhere, inequalities of 
talent and skill are to be found.  When there is no prospect of dull times 
(for printing and typesetting, like all other trades, sometimes come to a 
stand-still), every one is free to work his hardest, and exert his faculties 
to the utmost: he who does more gets more; he who does less gets less.  
When business slackens, compositors and pressmen divide up their labor; 
all monopolists are detested as no better than robbers or traitors. 
</p> 
<p>There is a philosophy in the action of these printers, to which 
neither economists nor legists have ever risen.  If our legislators had 
introduced into their codes the principle of distributive justice which 
governs printing-offices; if they had observed the popular instincts, &mdash; not 
for the sake of servile imitation, but in order to reform and generalize 
them, &mdash; long ere this liberty and equality would have been established on 
an immovable basis, and we should not now be disputing about the right 
of property and the necessity of social distinctions. 
</p> 
<p>It has been calculated that if labor were equally shared by the 
whole number of able-bodied individuals, the average  
<pb n="127"/> working-day of each individual, in France, would not 
exceed five hours.  This being so, how can we presume to talk of the 
inequality of laborers?  It is the <hi rend="italic">labor</hi> of Robert Macaire 
that causes inequality. 
</p> 
<p>The principle, <hi rend="italic">To each according to his labor</hi>, 
interpreted to mean, <hi rend="italic">Who works most should receive most</hi>, 
is based, therefore, on two palpable errors: one, an error in economy, 
that in the labor of society tasks must necessarily be unequal; the other, 
an error in physics, that there is no limit to the amount of producible 
things. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it will be said, &ldquo;suppose there are 
some people who wish to perform only half of their task?&rdquo; . . .  
Is that very embarrassing?  Probably they are satisfied with half of their 
salary.  Paid according to the labor that they had performed, of what 
could they complain? and what injury would they do to others?  In this 
sense, it is fair to apply the maxim, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">To each according to his 
results</hi>.  It is the law of equality itself. 
</p> 
<p>Further, numerous difficulties, relative to the police system and the 
organization of industry, might be raised here.  I will reply to them all 
with this one sentence, &mdash; that they must all be solved by the principle of 
equality.  Thus, some one might observe, &ldquo;Here is a task which 
cannot be postponed without detriment to production.  Ought society to 
suffer from the negligence of a few? and will she not venture &mdash; out of 
respect for the right of labor &mdash; to assure with her own hands the product 
which they refuse her?  In such a case, to whom will the salary 
belong?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>To society; who will be allowed to perform the labor, either 
herself, or through her representatives, but always in such a way that the 
general equality shall never be violated, and that only the idler shall be 
punished for his idleness.  Further, if  
<pb n="128"/> society may not use excessive severity towards her lazy 
members, she has a right, in self-defence, to guard against abuses. 
</p> 
<p>But every industry needs &mdash; they will add &mdash; leaders, instructors, 
superintendents, &amp;c.  Will these be engaged in the general task?  No; 
since their task is to lead, instruct, and superintend.  But they must be 
chosen from the laborers by the laborers themselves, and must fulfil the 
conditions of eligibility.  It is the same with all public functions, whether 
of administration or instruction. 
</p> 
<p>Then, article first of the universal constitution will be: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The limited quantity of available material proves the 
necessity of dividing the labor among the whole number of laborers.  
The capacity, given to all, of accomplishing a social task, &mdash; that is, an 
equal task, &mdash; and the impossibility of paying one laborer save in the 
products of another, justify the equality of wages.&rdquo; 
 
 
&sect; 7. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That Inequality of Powers is the Necessary Condition 
of Equality of Fortunes</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>It is objected, &mdash; and this objection constitutes the second part of 
the St. Simonian, and the third part of the Fourierstic, maxims, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;That all kinds of labor cannot be executed with equal 
ease.  Some require great superiority of skill and intelligence; and on 
this superiority is based the price.  The artist, the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, 
the poet, the statesman, are esteemed only because of their excellence; 
and this excellence destroys all similitude between them and other men: 
in the presence of these heights of science and genius the law of equality 
disappears.  Now, if equality is not absolute, there is no equality.  From 
the poet we descend to the novelist; from the sculptor to the stonecutter; 
from the architect to the mason; from the chemist  
<pb n="129"/> to the cook, &amp;c.  Capacities are classified and 
subdivided into orders, genera, and species.  The extremes of talent are 
connected by intermediate talents.  Humanity is a vast hierarchy, in 
which the individual estimates himself by comparison, and fixes his price 
by the value placed upon his product by the public.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>This objection always has seemed a formidable one.  It is the 
stumbling-block of the economists, as well as of the defenders of 
equality.  It has led the former into egregious blunders, and has caused 
the latter to utter incredible platitudes.  Gracchus Babeuf wished all 
superiority to be <hi rend="italic">stringently repressed</hi>, and even 
<hi rend="italic">persecuted as a social calamity</hi>.  To establish his 
communistic edifice, he lowered all citizens to the stature of the 
smallest.  Ignorant eclectics have been known to object to the inequality 
of knowledge, and I should not be surprised if some one should yet rebel 
against the inequality of virtue.  Aristotle was banished, Socrates drank 
the hemlock, Epaminondas was called to account, for having proved 
superior in intelligence and virtue to some dissolute and foolish 
demagogues.  Such follies will be re-enacted, so long as the inequality of 
fortunes justifies a populace, blinded and oppressed by the wealthy, in 
fearing the elevation of new tyrants to power. 
</p> 
<p>Nothing seems more unnatural than that which we examine too 
closely, and often nothing seems less like the truth than the truth itself.  
On the other hand, according to J. J. Rousseau, &ldquo;it takes a great 
deal of philosophy to enable us to observe once what we see every 
day;&rdquo; and, according to d'Alembert, &ldquo;the ordinary truths 
of life make but little impression on men, unless their attention is 
especially called to them.&rdquo;  The father of the school of 
economists (Say), from whom I borrow these two quotations, might have 
profited by them; but he  
<pb n="130"/> who laughs at the blind should wear spectacles, and he 
who notices him is near-sighted. 
</p> 
<p>Strange! that which has frightened so many minds is not, after all, 
an objection to equality &mdash; it is the very condition on which equality 
exists! . . . 
</p> 
<p>Natural inequality the condition of equality of fortunes! . . .  What 
a paradox! . . .  I repeat my assertion, that no one may think I have 
blundered &mdash; inequality of powers is the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of 
equality of fortunes. 
</p> 
<p>There are two things to be considered in society &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">functions</hi> and <hi rend="italic">relations</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>I. <hi rend="italic">Functions</hi>.  Every laborer is supposed to be 
capable of performing the task assigned to him; or, to use a common 
expression, &ldquo;every workman must know his trade.&rdquo;  The 
workman equal to his work, &mdash; there is an equation between functionary 
and function. 
</p> 
<p>In society, functions are not alike; there must be, then, different 
capacities.  Further, &mdash; certain functions demand greater intelligence and 
powers; then there are people of superior mind and talent.  For the 
performance of work necessarily involves a workman: from the need 
springs the idea, and the idea makes the producer.  We only know what 
our senses long for and our intelligence demands; we have no keen 
desire for things of which we cannot conceive, and the greater our 
powers of conception, the greater our capabilities of production. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, functions arising from needs, needs from desires, and 
desires from spontaneous perception and imagination, the same 
intelligence which imagines can also produce; consequently, no labor is 
superior to the laborer.  In a word, if the function calls out the 
functionary, it is because the functionary exists before the function. 
 
<pb n="131"/>  
</p> 
<p>Let us admire Nature's economy.  With regard to these various 
needs which she has given us, and which the isolated man cannot satisfy 
unaided, Nature has granted to the race a power refused to the 
individual.  This gives rise to the principle of the <hi rend="italic">division of 
labor</hi>, &mdash; a principle founded on the <hi rend="italic">speciality of 
vocations</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The satisfaction of some needs demands of man continual creation; 
while others can, by the labor of a single individual, be satisfied for 
millions of men through thousands of centuries.  For example, the need 
of clothing and food requires perpetual reproduction; while a knowledge 
of the system of the universe may be acquired for ever by two or three 
highly-gifted men.  The perpetual current of rivers supports our 
commerce, and runs our machinery; but the sun, alone in the midst of 
space, gives light to the whole world.  Nature, who might create Platos 
and Virgils, Newtons and Cuviers, as she creates husbandmen and 
shepherds, does not see fit to do so; choosing rather to proportion the 
rarity of genius to the duration of its products, and to balance the 
number of capacities by the competency of each one of them. 
</p> 
<p>I do not inquire here whether the distance which separates one man 
from another, in point of talent and intelligence, arises from the 
deplorable condition of civilization, nor whether that which is now called 
the <hi rend="italic">inequality of powers</hi> would be in an ideal society any 
thing more than a <hi rend="italic">diversity of powers</hi>.  I take the worst 
view of the matter; and, that I may not be accused of tergiversation and 
evasion of difficulties, I acknowledge all the inequalities that any one can 
desire.[1] 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] I cannot conceive how any one dares to justify the inequality of 
conditions, by pointing to the base inclinations and propensities of certain 
men.  Whence comes this shameful degradation of heart and mind to 
which so many fall victims, if not from the misery and abjection into 
which property plunges them? 
 
 
 
<pb n="132"/>  
</p> 
<p>Certain philosophers, in love with the levelling idea, maintain that 
all minds are equal, and that all differences are the result of education.  I 
am no believer, I confess, in this doctrine; which, even if it were true, 
would lead to a result directly opposite to that desired.  For, if capacities 
are equal, whatever be the degree of their power (as no one can be 
coerced), there are functions deemed coarse, low, and degrading, which 
deserve higher pay, &mdash; a result no less repugnant to equality than to the 
principle, <hi rend="italic">to each capacity according to its results</hi>.  Give 
me, on the contrary, a society in which every kind of talent bears a 
proper numerical relation to the needs of the society, and which demands 
from each producer only that which his special function requires him to 
produce; and, without impairing in the least the hierarchy of functions, I 
will deduce the equality of fortunes. 
</p> 
<p>This is my second point. 
</p> 
<p>II. <hi rend="italic">Relations</hi>.  In considering the element of labor, I 
have shown that in the same class of productive services, the capacity to 
perform a social task being possessed by all, no inequality of reward can 
be based upon an inequality of individual powers.  However, it is but 
fair to say that certain capacities seem quite incapable of certain services; 
so that, if human industry were entirely confined to one class of 
products, numerous incapacities would arise, and, consequently, the 
greatest social inequality.  But every body sees, without any hint from 
me, that the variety of industries avoids this difficulty; so clear is this 
that I shall not stop to discuss it.  We have only to prove, then, that 
functions are equal to each other; just as laborers, who perform the same 
function, are equal to each other. 
 &mdash;   &mdash;   
Property makes man a eunuch, and then reproaches him for being 
nothing but dry wood, a decaying tree. 
 
 
 
<pb n="133"/>  
</p> 
<p>Are you astonished that I refuse to genius, to knowledge, to 
courage, &mdash; in a word, to all the excellences admired by the world, &mdash; the 
homage of dignities, the distinctions of power and wealth?  It is not I 
who refuse it: it is economy, it is justice, it is liberty.  Liberty! for the 
first time in this discussion I appeal to her.  Let her rise in her own 
defence, and achieve her victory. 
</p> 
<p>Every transaction ending in an exchange of products or services 
may be designated as a <hi rend="italic">commercial operation</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Whoever says commerce, says exchange of equal values; for, if 
the values are not equal, and the injured party perceives it, he will not 
consent to the exchange, and there will be no commerce. 
</p> 
<p>Commerce exists only among free men.  Transactions may be 
effected between other people by violence or fraud, but there is no 
commerce. 
</p> 
<p>A free man is one who enjoys the use of his reason and his 
faculties; who is neither blinded by passion, nor hindered or driven by 
oppression, nor deceived by erroneous opinions. 
</p> 
<p>So, in every exchange, there is a moral obligation that neither of 
the contracting parties shall gain at the expense of the other; that is, that, 
to be legitimate and true, commerce must be exempt from all inequality.  
This is the first condition of commerce.  Its second condition is, that it 
be voluntary; that is, that the parties act freely and openly. 
</p> 
<p>I define, then, commerce or exchange as an act of society. 
</p> 
<p>The negro who sells his wife for a knife, his children for some bits 
of glass, and finally himself for a bottle of brandy, is not free.  The 
dealer in human flesh, with whom he negotiates, is not his associate; he 
is his enemy. 
</p> 
<p>The civilized laborer who bakes a loaf that he may eat a slice of 
bread, who builds a palace that he may sleep in a  
<pb n="134"/> stable, who weaves rich fabrics that he may dress in 
rags, who produces every thing that he may dispense with every thing, &mdash; 
is not free.  His employer, not becoming his associate in the exchange of 
salaries or services which takes place between them, is his enemy. 
</p> 
<p>The soldier who serves his country through fear instead of through 
love is not free; his comrades and his officers, the ministers or organs of 
military justice, are all his enemies. 
</p> 
<p>The peasant who hires land, the manufacturer who borrows capital, 
the tax-payer who pays tolls, duties, patent and license fees, personal and 
property taxes, &amp;c., and the deputy who votes for them, &mdash; all act neither 
intelligently nor freely.  Their enemies are the proprietors, the 
capitalists, the government. 
</p> 
<p>Give men liberty, enlighten their minds that they may know the 
meaning of their contracts, and you will see the most perfect equality in 
exchanges without regard to superiority of talent and knowledge; and you 
will admit that in commercial affairs, that is, in the sphere of society, the 
word superiority is void of sense. 
</p> 
<p>Let Homer sing his verse.  I listen to this sublime genius in 
comparison with whom I, a simple herdsman, an humble farmer, am as 
nothing.  What, indeed, &mdash; if product is to be compared with product, &mdash; 
are my cheeses and my beans in the presence of his 
&ldquo;Iliad&rdquo;?  But, if Homer wishes to take from me all that I 
possess, and make me his slave in return for his inimitable poem, I will 
give up the pleasure of his lays, and dismiss him.  I can do without his 
&ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; and wait, if necessary, for the 
&ldquo;&aelig;neid.&rdquo;  Homer cannot live twenty-four hours 
without my products.  Let him accept, then, the little that I have to 
offer; and then his muse may instruct, encourage, and console me. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;What! do you say that such should be the condition of 
 
<pb n="135"/> one who sings of gods and men?  Alms, with the 
humiliation and suffering which they bring with them! &mdash; what barbarous 
generosity!&rdquo; . . .  Do not get excited, I beg of you.  Property 
makes of a poet either a Cr&oelig;sus or a beggar; only equality knows 
how to honor and to praise him.  What is its duty?  To regulate the right 
of the singer and the duty of the listener.  Now, notice this point, which 
is a very important one in the solution of this question: both are free, the 
one to sell, the other to buy.  Henceforth their respective pretensions go 
for nothing; and the estimate, whether fair or unfair, that they place, the 
one upon his verse, the other upon his liberality, can have no influence 
upon the conditions of the contract.  We must no longer, in making our 
bargains, weigh talent; we must consider products only. 
</p> 
<p>In order that the bard of Achilles may get his due reward, he must 
first make himself wanted: that done, the exchange of his verse for a fee 
of any kind, being a free act, must be at the same time a just act; that is, 
the poet's fee must be equal to his product.  Now, what is the value of 
this product? 
</p> 
<p>Let us suppose, in the first place, that this &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; &mdash; 
this <hi rend="italic">chef-d' &oelig;uvre</hi> that is to be equitably rewarded &mdash; 
is really above price, that we do not know how to appraise it.  If the 
public, who are free to purchase it, refuse to do so, it is clear that, the 
poem being unexchangeable, its intrinsic value will not be diminished; 
but that its exchangeable value, or its productive utility, will be reduced 
to zero, will be nothing at all.  Then we must seek the amount of wages 
to be paid between infinity on the one hand and nothing on the other, at 
an equal distance from each, since all rights and liberties are entitled to 
equal respect; in other words, it is not the intrinsic value, but the relative 
value, of the thing sold that needs to be fixed.  The question grows 
simpler: what is this rela 
<pb n="136"/> tive value?  To what reward does a poem like the 
&ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; entitle its author? 
</p> 
<p>The first business of political economy, after fixing its definitions, 
was the solution of this problem; now, not only has it not been solved, 
but it has been declared insoluble.  According to the economists, the 
relative or exchangeable value of things cannot be absolutely determined; 
it necessarily varies. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The value of a thing,&rdquo; says Say, &ldquo;is a 
positive quantity, but only for a given moment.  It is its nature to 
perpetually vary, to change from one point to another.  Nothing can fix 
it absolutely, because it is based on needs and means of production 
which vary with every moment.  These variations complicate economical 
phenomena, and often render them very difficult of observation and 
solution.  I know no remedy for this; it is not in our power to change the 
nature of things.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Elsewhere Say says, and repeats, that value being based on utility, 
and utility depending entirely on our needs, whims, customs, &amp;c., value 
is as variable as opinion.  Now, political economy being the science of 
values, of their production, distribution, exchange, and consumption, &mdash; 
if exchangeable value cannot be absolutely determined, how is political 
economy possible?  How can it be a science?  How can two economists 
look each other in the face without laughing?  How dare they insult 
metaphysicians and psychologists?  What! that fool of a Descartes 
imagined that philosophy needed an immovable base &mdash; an <hi rend="italic">aliquid 
inconcussum</hi> &mdash; on which the edifice of science might be built, 
and he was simple enough to search for it!  And the Hermes of 
economy, Trismegistus Say, devoting half a volume to the amplification 
of that solemn text, <hi rend="italic">political economy is a science</hi>, has the 
courage to affirm immediately afterwards that this science cannot 
determine its object, &mdash; which is equivalent to saying that it is without a 
principle or foundation!  He does not know, then,  
<pb n="137"/> the illustrious Say, the nature of a science; or rather, he 
knows nothing of the subject which he discusses. 
</p> 
<p>Say's example has borne its fruits.  Political economy, as it exists 
at present, resembles ontology: discussing effects and causes, it knows 
nothing, explains nothing, decides nothing.  The ideas honored with the 
name of economic laws are nothing more than a few trifling generalities, 
to which the economists thought to give an appearance of depth by 
clothing them in high-sounding words.  As for the attempts that have 
been made by the economists to solve social problems, all that can be 
said of them is, that, if a glimmer of sense occasionally appears in their 
lucubrations, they immediately fall back into absurdity.  For twenty-five 
years political economy, like a heavy fog, has weighed upon France, 
checking the efforts of the mind, and setting limits to liberty. 
</p> 
<p>Has every creation of industry a venal, absolute, unchangeable, 
and consequently legitimate and true value? &mdash; Yes. 
</p> 
<p>Can every product of man be exchanged for some other product of 
man? &mdash; Yes, again. 
</p> 
<p>How many nails is a pair of shoes worth? 
</p> 
<p>If we can solve this appalling problem, we shall have the key of 
the social system for which humanity has been searching for six thousand 
years.  In the presence of this problem, the economist recoils confused; 
the peasant who can neither read nor write replies without hesitation:  
&ldquo;As many as can be made in the same time, and with the same 
expense.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The absolute value of a thing, then, is its cost in time and expense.  
How much is a diamond worth which costs only the labor of picking it 
up? &mdash; Nothing; it is not a product of man.  How much will it be worth 
when cut and mounted? &mdash; The time and expense which it has cost the 
laborer.  Why, then, is it sold at so high a price? &mdash; Because men are not 
 
<pb n="138"/> free.  Society must regulate the exchange and 
distribution of the rarest things, as it does that of the most common ones, 
in such a way that each may share in the enjoyment of them.  What, 
then, is that value which is based upon opinion? &mdash; Delusion, injustice, 
and robbery. 
</p> 
<p>By this rule, it is easy to reconcile every body.  If the mean term, 
which we are searching for, between an infinite value and no value at all 
is expressed in the case of every product, by the amount of time and 
expense which the product cost, a poem which has cost its author thirty 
years of labor and an outlay of ten thousand francs in journeys, books, 
&amp;c., must be paid for by the ordinary wages received by a laborer 
during thirty years, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> ten thousand francs indemnity for 
expense incurred.  Suppose the whole amount to be fifty thousand francs; 
if the society which gets the benefit of the production include a million 
of men, my share of the debt is five centimes. 
</p> 
<p>This gives rise to a few observations. 
</p> 
<p>1. The same product, at different times and in different places, 
may cost more or less of time and outlay; in this view, it is true that 
value is a variable quantity.  But this variation is not that of the 
economists, who place in their list of the causes of the variation of 
values, not only the means of production, but taste, caprice, fashion, and 
opinion.  In short, the true value of a thing is invariable in its algebraic 
expression, although it may vary in its monetary expression. 
</p> 
<p>2. The price of every product in demand should be its cost in time 
and outlay &mdash; neither more nor less: every product not in demand is a 
loss to the producer &mdash; a commercial non-value. 
</p> 
<p>3. The ignorance of the principle of evaluation, and the difficulty 
under many circumstances of applying it, is the  
<pb n="139"/> source of commercial fraud, and one of the most potent 
causes of the inequality of fortunes. 
</p> 
<p>4. To reward certain industries and pay for certain products, a 
society is needed which corresponds in size with the rarity of talents, the 
costliness of the products, and the variety of the arts and sciences.  If, 
for example, a society of fifty farmers can support a schoolmaster, it 
requires one hundred for a shoemaker, one hundred and fifty for a 
blacksmith, two hundred for a tailor, &amp;c.  If the number of farmers rises 
to one thousand, ten thousand, one hundred thousand, &amp;c., as fast as 
their number increases, that of the functionaries which are earliest 
required must increase in the same proportion; so that the highest 
functions become possible only in the most powerful societies.[1]  That 
is the peculiar feature of capacities; the character of genius, the seal of 
its glory, cannot arise and develop itself, except in the bosom of a great 
nation.  But this physiological condition, necessary to the existence of 
genius, adds nothing to its social rights: far from that, &mdash; the delay in its 
appearance proves that, in economical and civil affairs, the loftiest 
intelligence must submit to the equality of possessions; an equality which 
is anterior to it, and of which it constitutes the crown. 
</p> 
<p>This is severe on our pride, but it is an inexorable truth.  And here 
psychology comes to the aid of social economy, giving us to understand 
that talent and material recompense have no common measure; that, in 
this respect, the condition of all producers is equal: consequently, that all 
comparison between them, and all distinction in fortunes, is impossible. 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] How many citizens are needed to support a professor of 
philosophy? &mdash; Thirty-five millions.  How many for an economist? &mdash; 
Two billions.  And for a literary man, who is neither a 
<hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, nor an artist, nor a philosopher, nor an economist, 
and who writes newspaper novels? &mdash; None. 
 
 
 
<pb n="140"/>  
</p> 
<p>In fact, every work coming from the hands of man &mdash; compared 
with the raw material of which it is composed &mdash; is beyond price.  In this 
respect, the distance is as great between a pair of wooden shoes and the 
trunk of a walnut-tree, as between a statue by Scopas and a block of 
marble.  The genius of the simplest mechanic exerts as much influence 
over the materials which he uses, as does the mind of a Newton over the 
inert spheres whose distances, volumes, and revolutions he calculates.  
You ask for talent and genius a corresponding degree of honor and 
reward.  Fix for me the value of a wood-cutter's talent, and I will fix 
that of Homer.  If any thing can reward intelligence, it is intelligence 
itself.  That is what happens, when various classes of producers pay to 
each other a reciprocal tribute of admiration and praise.  But if they 
contemplate an exchange of products with a view to satisfying mutual 
needs, this exchange must be effected in accordance with a system of 
economy which is indifferent to considerations of talent and genius, and 
whose laws are deduced, not from vague and meaningless admiration, 
but from a just balance between <hi rend="italic">debit</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">credit;</hi> in short, from commercial accounts. 
</p> 
<p>Now, that no one may imagine that the liberty of buying and 
selling is the sole basis of the equality of wages, and that society's sole 
protection against superiority of talent lies in a certain force of inertia 
which has nothing in common with right, I shall proceed to explain why 
all capacities are entitled to the same reward, and why a corresponding 
difference in wages would be an injustice.  I shall prove that the 
obligation to stoop to the social level is inherent in talent; and on this 
very superiority of genius I will found the equality of fortunes.  I have 
just given the negative argument in favor of rewarding all capacities 
alike; I will now give the direct and positive argument. 
 
<pb n="141"/>  
</p> 
<p>Listen, first, to the economist: it is always pleasant to see how he 
reasons, and how he understands justice.  Without him, moreover, 
without his amusing blunders and his wonderful arguments, we should 
learn nothing.  Equality, so odious to the economist, owes every thing to 
political economy. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When the parents of a physician [the text says a lawyer, 
which is not so good an example] have expended on his education forty 
thousand francs, this sum may be regarded as so much capital invested in 
his head.  It is therefore permissible to consider it as yielding an annual 
income of four thousand francs.  If the physician earns thirty thousand, 
there remains an income of twenty-six thousand francs due to the 
personal talents given him by Nature.  This natural capital, then, if we 
assume ten per cent. as the rate of interest, amounts to two hundred and 
sixty thousand francs; and the capital given him by his parents, in 
defraying the expenses of his education, to forty thousand francs.  The 
union of these two kinds of capital constitutes his fortune.&rdquo; &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Say: Complete Course, &amp;c.</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Say divides the fortune of the physician into two parts: one is 
composed of the capital which went to pay for his education, the other 
represents his personal talents.  This division is just; it is in conformity 
with the nature of things; it is universally admitted; it serves as the 
major premise of that grand argument which establishes the inequality of 
capacities.  I accept this premise without qualification; let us look at the 
consequences. 
</p> 
<p>1. Say <hi rend="italic">credits</hi> the physician with forty thousand 
francs, &mdash; the cost of his education.  This amount should be entered upon 
the <hi rend="italic">debit</hi> side of the account.  For, although this expense 
was incurred for him, it was not incurred by him.  Then, instead of 
appropriating these forty thousand francs, the physician should add them 
to the price of his product, and repay them to those who are entitled to 
them.  Notice, further, that Say speaks of <hi rend="italic">income</hi> instead 
of <hi rend="italic">reimbursement;</hi> reasoning on the false principle of the 
productivity of capital.   
<pb n="142"/> The expense of educating a talent is a debt contracted 
by this talent.  From the very fact of its existence, it becomes a debtor to 
an amount equal to the cost of its production.  This is so true and simple 
that, if the education of some one child in a family has cost double or 
triple that of its brothers, the latter are entitled to a proportional amount 
of the property previous to its division.  There is no difficulty about this 
in the case of guardianship, when the estate is administered in the name 
of the minors. 
</p> 
<p>2. That which I have just said of the obligation incurred by talent 
of repaying the cost of its education does not embarrass the economist.  
The man of talent, he says, inheriting from his family, inherits among 
other things a claim to the forty thousand francs which his education 
costs; and he becomes, in consequence, its proprietor.  But this is to 
abandon the right of talent, and to fall back upon the right of occupancy; 
which again calls up all the questions asked in Chapter II.  What is the 
right of occupancy? what is inheritance?  Is the right of succession a 
right of accumulation or only a right of choice? how did the physician's 
father get his fortune? was he a proprietor, or only a usufructuary?  If he 
was rich, let him account for his wealth; if he was poor, how could he 
incur so large an expense?  If he received aid, what right had he to use 
that aid to the disadvantage of his benefactors, &amp;c.? 
</p> 
<p>3. &ldquo;There remains an income of twenty-six thousand francs 
due to the personal talents given him by Nature.&rdquo;  
<hi rend="italic">(Say</hi>, &mdash; as above quoted.)  Reasoning from this premise, 
Say concludes that our physician's talent is equivalent to a capital of two 
hundred and sixty thousand francs.  This skilful calculator mistakes a 
consequence for a principle.  The talent must not be measured by the 
gain, but rather the gain by the talent;  
<pb n="143"/> for it may happen, that, notwithstanding his merit, the 
physician in question will gain nothing at all, in which case will it be 
necessary to conclude that his talent or fortune is equivalent to zero?  To 
such a result, however, would Say's reasoning lead; a result which is 
clearly absurd. 
</p> 
<p>Now, it is impossible to place a money value on any talent 
whatsoever, since talent and money have no common measure.  On what 
plausible ground can it be maintained that a physician should be paid 
two, three, or a hundred times as much as a peasant?  An unavoidable 
difficulty, which has never been solved save by avarice, necessity, and 
oppression.  It is not thus that the right of talent should be determined.  
But how is it to be determined? 
</p> 
<p>4. I say, first, that the physician must be treated with as much 
favor as any other producer, that he must not be placed below the level 
of others.  This I will not stop to prove.  But I add that neither must he 
be lifted above that level; because his talent is collective property for 
which he did not pay, and for which he is ever in debt. 
</p> 
<p>Just as the creation of every instrument of production is the result 
of collective force, so also are a man's talent and knowledge the product 
of universal intelligence and of general knowledge slowly accumulated 
by a number of masters, and through the aid of many inferior industries.  
When the physician has paid for his teachers, his books, his diplomas, 
and all the other items of his educational expenses, he has no more paid 
for his talent than the capitalist pays for his house and land when he 
gives his employees their wages.  The man of talent has contributed to 
the production in himself of a useful instrument.  He has, then, a share 
in its possession; he is not its proprietor.  There exist side by side in him 
a free laborer and an accumulated social capital.  As a laborer, 
 
<pb n="144"/> he is charged with the use of an instrument, with the 
superintendence of a machine; namely, his capacity.  As capital, he is 
not his own master; he uses himself, not for his own benefit, but for that 
of others. 
</p> 
<p>Even if talent did not find in its own excellence a reward for the 
sacrifices which it costs, still would it be easier to find reasons for 
lowering its reward than for raising it above the common level.  Every 
producer receives an education; every laborer is a talent, a capacity, &mdash; 
that is, a piece of collective property.  But all talents are not equally 
costly.  It takes but few teachers, but few years, and but little study, to 
make a farmer or a mechanic: the generative effort and &mdash; if I may 
venture to use such language &mdash; the period of social gestation are 
proportional to the loftiness of the capacity.  But while the physician, the 
poet, the artist, and the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> produce but little, and that 
slowly, the productions of the farmer are much less uncertain, and do 
not require so long a time.  Whatever be then the capacity of a man, &mdash; 
when this capacity is once created, &mdash; it does not belong to him.  Like 
the material fashioned by an industrious hand, it had the power of 
<hi rend="italic">becoming</hi>, and society has given it <hi rend="italic">being</hi>.  
Shall the vase say to the potter, &ldquo;I am that I am, and I owe you 
nothing&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>The artist, the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, and the poet find their just 
recompense in the permission that society gives them to devote 
themselves exclusively to science and to art: so that in reality they do not 
labor for themselves, but for society, which creates them, and requires 
of them no other duty.  Society can, if need be, do without prose and 
verse, music and painting, and the knowledge of the movements of the 
moon and stars; but it cannot live a single day without food and shelter. 
 
<pb n="145"/>  
</p> 
<p>Undoubtedly, man does not live by bread alone; he must, also 
(according to the Gospel), <hi rend="italic">live by the word of God;</hi> that 
is, he must love the good and do it, know and admire the beautiful, and 
study the marvels of Nature.  But in order to cultivate his mind, he must 
first take care of his body, &mdash; the latter duty is as necessary as the former 
is noble.  If it is glorious to charm and instruct men, it is honorable as 
well to feed them.  When, then, society &mdash; faithful to the principle of the 
division of labor &mdash; intrusts a work of art or of science to one of its 
members, allowing him to abandon ordinary labor, it owes him an 
indemnity for all which it prevents him from producing industrially; but 
it owes him nothing more.  If he should demand more, society should, 
by refusing his services, annihilate his pretensions.  Forced, then, in 
order to live, to devote himself to labor repugnant to his nature, the man 
of genius would feel his weakness, and would live the most distasteful of 
lives. 
</p> 
<p>They tell of a celebrated singer who demanded of the Empress of 
Russia (Catherine II.) twenty thousand roubles for his services:  
&ldquo;That is more than I give my field-marshals,&rdquo; said 
Catherine.  &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; replied the other, 
&ldquo;has only to make singers of her field-marshals.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>If France (more powerful than Catherine II.) should say to 
Mademoiselle Rachel, &ldquo;You must act for one hundred louis, or 
else spin cotton;&rdquo; to M. Duprez, &ldquo;You must sing for two 
thousand four hundred francs, or else work in the vineyard,&rdquo; &mdash; 
do you think that the actress Rachel, and the singer Duprez, would 
abandon the stage?  If they did, they would be the first to repent it. 
</p> 
<p>Mademoiselle Rachel receives, they say, sixty thousand francs 
annually from the Com&eacute;die-Fran&ccedil;aise.  For a talent like 
hers, it is a slight fee.  Why not one hundred thousand  
<pb n="146"/> francs, two hundred thousand francs?  Why! not a civil 
list?  What meanness!  Are we really guilty of chaffering with an artist 
like Mademoiselle Rachel? 
</p> 
<p>It is said, in reply, that the managers of the theatre cannot give 
more without incurring a loss; that they admit the superior talent of their 
young associate; but that, in fixing her salary, they have been compelled 
to take the account of the company's receipts and expenses into 
consideration also. 
</p> 
<p>That is just, but it only confirms what I have said; namely, that an 
artist's talent may be infinite, but that its mercenary claims are 
necessarily limited, &mdash; on the one hand, by its usefulness to the society 
which rewards it; on the other, by the resources of this society: in other 
words, that the demand of the seller is balanced by the right of the 
buyer. 
</p> 
<p>Mademoiselle Rachel, they say, brings to the treasury of the 
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Fran&ccedil;ais more than sixty thousand francs.  
I admit it; but then I blame the theatre.  From whom does the 
Th&eacute;&acirc;tre-Fran&ccedil;ais take this money?  From some 
curious people who are perfectly free.  Yes; but the workingmen, the 
lessees, the tenants, those who borrow by pawning their possessions, 
from whom these curious people recover all that they pay to the theatre, 
&mdash; are they free?  And when the better part of their products are 
consumed by others at the play, do you assure me that their families are 
not in want?  Until the French people, reflecting on the salaries paid to 
all artists, <hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, and public functionaries, have plainly 
expressed their wish and judgment as to the matter, the salaries of 
Mademoiselle Rachel and all her fellow-artists will be a compulsory tax 
extorted by violence, to reward pride, and support libertinism. 
</p> 
<p>It is because we are neither free nor sufficiently enlightened, that 
we submit to be cheated in our bargains; that the  
<pb n="147"/> laborer pays the duties levied by the prestige of power 
and the selfishness of talent upon the curiosity of the idle, and that we 
are perpetually scandalized by these monstrous inequalities which are 
encouraged and applauded by public opinion. 
</p> 
<p>The whole nation, and the nation only, pays its authors, its 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, its artists, its officials, whatever be the hands 
through which their salaries pass.  On what basis should it pay them?  
On the basis of equality.  I have proved it by estimating the value of 
talent.  I shall confirm it in the following chapter, by proving the 
impossibility of all social inequality. 
</p> 
<p>What have we shown so far?  Things so simple that really they 
seem silly: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>That, as the traveller does not appropriate the route which he 
traverses, so the farmer does not appropriate the field which he sows; 
</p> 
<p>That if, nevertheless, by reason of his industry, a laborer may 
appropriate the material which he employs, every employer of material 
becomes, by the same title, a proprietor; 
</p> 
<p>That all capital, whether material or mental, being the result of 
collective labor, is, in consequence, collective property; 
</p> 
<p>That the strong have no right to encroach upon the labor of the 
weak, nor the shrewd to take advantage of the credulity of the simple; 
</p> 
<p>Finally, that no one can be forced to buy that which he does not 
want, still less to pay for that which he has not bought; and, 
consequently, that the exchangeable value of a product, being measured 
neither by the opinion of the buyer nor that of the seller, but by the 
amount of time and outlay which it has cost, the property of each always 
remains the same.

</p> 
<p>Are not these very simple truths?  Well, as simple as they seem to 
you, reader, you shall yet see others which surpass them in dullness and 
simplicity.  For our course is the reverse of that of the geometricians: 
with them, the farther they advance, the more difficult their problems 
become; we, on the contrary, after having commenced with the most 
abstruse propositions, shall end with the axioms. 
</p> 
<p>But I must close this chapter with an exposition of one of those 
startling truths which never have been dreamed of by legists or 
economists. 
 
 
&sect; 8. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That, from the Stand-point of Justice, Labor destroys 
Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>This proposition is the logical result of the two preceding sections, 
which we have just summed up. 
</p> 
<p>The isolated man can supply but a very small portion of his wants; 
all his power lies in association, and in the intelligent combination of 
universal effort.  The division and co-operation of labor multiply the 
quantity and the variety of products; the individuality of functions 
improves their quality. 
</p> 
<p>There is not a man, then, but lives upon the products of several 
thousand different industries; not a laborer but receives from society at 
large the things which he consumes, and, with these, the power to 
reproduce.  Who, indeed, would venture the assertion, &ldquo;I 
produce, by my own effort, all that I consume; I need the aid of no one 
else&rdquo;?  The farmer, whom the early economists regarded as the 
only real producer &mdash; the farmer, housed, furnished, clothed, fed, and 
assisted by the mason, the carpenter, the tailor, the miller, the baker, the 
butcher, the grocer, the blacksmith, &amp;c., &mdash; the farmer, I say, can he 
boast that he produces by his own unaided effort? 
</p> 
<p>The various articles of consumption are given to each by 
 
<pb n="149"/> all; consequently, the production of each involves the 
production of all. One product cannot exist without another; an isolated 
industry is an impossible thing.  What would be the harvest of the 
farmer, if others did not manufacture for him barns, wagons, ploughs, 
clothes, &amp;c.?  Where would be the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> without the 
publisher; the printer without the typecaster and the machinist; and these, 
in their turn, without a multitude of other industries? . . .  Let us not 
prolong this catalogue &mdash; so easy to extend &mdash; lest we be accused of 
uttering commonplaces.  All industries are united by mutual relations in 
a single group; all productions do reciprocal service as means and end; 
all varieties of talent are but a series of changes from the inferior to the 
superior. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this undisputed and indisputable fact of the general 
participation in every species of product makes all individual productions 
common; so that every product, coming from the hands of the producer, 
is mortgaged in advance by society.  The producer himself is entitled to 
only that portion of his product, which is expressed by a fraction whose 
denominator is equal to the number of individuals of which society is 
composed.  It is true that in return this same producer has a share in all 
the products of others, so that he has a claim upon all, just as all have a 
claim upon him; but is it not clear that this reciprocity of mortgages, far 
from authorizing property, destroys even possession?  The laborer is not 
even possessor of his product; scarcely has he finished it, when society 
claims it. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; it will be answered, &ldquo;even if that is 
so &mdash; even if the product does not belong to the producer &mdash; still society 
gives each laborer an equivalent for his product; and this equivalent, this 
salary, this reward, this allowance, becomes his property.  Do you deny 
that this property is legitimate?   
<pb n="150"/> And if the laborer, instead of consuming his entire 
wages, chooses to economize, &mdash; who dare question his right to do 
so?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The laborer is not even proprietor of the price of his labor, and 
cannot absolutely control its disposition.  Let us not be blinded by a 
spurious justice.  That which is given the laborer in exchange for his 
product is not given him as a reward for past labor, but to provide for 
and secure future labor.  We consume before we produce.  The laborer 
may say at the end of the day, &ldquo;I have paid yesterday's expenses; 
to-morrow I shall pay those of today.&rdquo;  At every moment of his 
life, the member of society is in debt; he dies with the debt unpaid: &mdash; 
how is it possible for him to accumulate? 
</p> 
<p>They talk of economy &mdash; it is the proprietor's hobby.  Under a 
system of equality, all economy which does not aim at subsequent 
reproduction or enjoyment is impossible &mdash; why?  Because the thing 
saved, since it cannot be converted into capital, has no object, and is 
without a <hi rend="italic">final cause</hi>.  This will be explained more fully in 
the next chapter. 
</p> 
<p>To conclude: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>The laborer, in his relation to society, is a debtor who of necessity 
dies insolvent.  The proprietor is an unfaithful guardian who denies the 
receipt of the deposit committed to his care, and wishes to be paid for 
his guardianship down to the last day. 
</p> 
<p>Lest the principles just set forth may appear to certain readers too 
metaphysical, I shall reproduce them in a more concrete form, 
intelligible to the dullest brains, and pregnant with the most important 
consequences. 
</p> 
<p>Hitherto, I have considered property as a power of 
<hi rend="italic">exclusion;</hi> hereafter, I shall examine it as a power of 
<hi rend="italic">invasion</hi>. 
</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="4" id="d13"> 
<head>CHAPTER IV. 
THAT PROPERTY IS IMPOSSIBLE. 
</head> 
<p> 
The last resort of proprietors, &mdash; the overwhelming argument whose 
invincible potency reassures them, &mdash; is that, in their opinion, equality of 
conditions is impossible.  &ldquo;Equality of conditions is a 
chimera,&rdquo; they cry with a knowing air; &ldquo;distribute wealth 
equally to-day &mdash; to-morrow this equality will have vanished.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>To this hackneyed objection, which they repeat everywhere with 
the most marvellous assurance, they never fail to add the following 
comment, as a sort of <hi rend="italic">Glory be to the Father</hi>:  &ldquo;If 
all men were equal, nobody would work.&rdquo; 
This anthem is sung with variations. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If all were masters, nobody would obey.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If nobody were rich, who would employ the 
poor?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>And, &ldquo;If nobody were poor, who would labor for the 
rich?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But let us have done with invective &mdash; we have better arguments at 
our command. 
</p> 
<p>If I show that property itself is impossible &mdash; that it is property 
which is a contradiction, a chimera, a utopia; and if I show it no longer 
by metaphysics and jurisprudence, but by figures, equations, and 
calculations, &mdash; imagine the fright of the astounded proprietor!  And you, 
reader; what do you think of the retort? 
 
<pb n="152"/>  
</p> 
<p>Numbers govern the world &mdash; <hi rend="italic">mundum regunt 
numeri</hi>.  This proverb applies as aptly to the moral and political, 
as to the sidereal and molecular, world.  The elements of justice are 
identical with those of algebra; legislation and government are simply the 
arts of classifying and balancing powers; all jurisprudence falls within 
the rules of arithmetic.  This chapter and the next will serve to lay the 
foundations of this extraordinary doctrine.  Then will be unfolded to the 
reader's vision an immense and novel career; then shall we commence to 
see in numerical relations the synthetic unity of philosophy and the 
sciences; and, filled with admiration and enthusiasm for this profound 
and majestic simplicity of Nature, we shall shout with the apostle:  
&ldquo;Yes, the Eternal has made all things by number, weight, and 
measure!&rdquo;  We shall understand not only that equality of 
conditions is possible, but that all else is impossible; that this seeming 
impossibility which we charge upon it arises from the fact that we 
always think of it in connection either with the proprietary or the 
communistic <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, &mdash; political systems equally 
irreconcilable with human nature.  We shall see finally that equality is 
constantly being realized without our knowledge, even at the very 
moment when we are pronouncing it incapable of realization; that the 
time draws near when, without any effort or even wish of ours, we shall 
have it universally established; that with it, in it, and by it, the natural 
and true political order must make itself manifest. 
</p> 
<p>It has been said, in speaking of the blindness and obstinacy of the 
passions, that, if man had any thing to gain by denying the truths of 
arithmetic, he would find some means of unsettling their certainty: here 
is an opportunity to try this curious experiment.  I attack property, no 
longer with its own maxims, but with arithmetic.  Let the proprietors 
pre 
<pb n="153"/> pare to verify my figures; for, if unfortunately for them 
the figures prove accurate, the proprietors are lost. 
</p> 
<p>In proving the impossibility of property, I complete the proof of its 
injustice.  In fact, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>That which is <hi rend="italic">just</hi> must be <hi rend="italic">useful;</hi> 
</p> 
<p>That which is useful must be <hi rend="italic">true;</hi> 
</p> 
<p>That which is true must be <hi rend="italic">possible;</hi> 
</p> 
<p>Therefore, every thing which is impossible is untrue, useless, 
unjust.  Then, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>, &mdash; we may judge of the justice of 
any thing by its possibility; so that if the thing were absolutely 
impossible, it would be absolutely unjust. 
 
 
PROPERTY IS PHYSICALLY AND MATHEMATICALLY 
IMPOSSIBLE. 
 
DEMONSTRATION. 
 
AXIOM. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Property is the Right of Increase claimed by the 
Proprietor over any thing which he has stamped as his own</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>This proposition is purely an axiom, because, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>1. It is not a definition, since it does not express all that is 
included in the right of property &mdash; the right of sale, of exchange, of gift; 
the right to transform, to alter, to consume, to destroy, to use and abuse, 
&amp;c.  All these rights are so many different powers of property, which 
we may consider separately; but which we disregard here, that we may 
devote all our attention to this single one, &mdash; the right of increase. 
</p> 
<p>2. It is universally admitted.  No one can deny it without denying 
the facts, without being instantly belied by universal custom. 
</p> 
<p>3. It is self-evident, since property is always accompanied (either 
actually or potentially) by the fact which this axiom expresses; and 
through this fact, mainly, property manifests, establishes, and asserts 
itself. 
 
<pb n="154"/>  
</p> 
<p>4. Finally, its negation involves a contradiction.  The right of 
increase is really an inherent right, so essential a part of property, that, 
in its absence, property is null and void. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Observations</hi>. &mdash; Increase receives different names 
according to the thing by which it is yielded: if by land, <hi rend="italic">farm-rent;</hi> if by houses and furniture, <hi rend="italic">rent;</hi> if by life-investments, <hi rend="italic">revenue;</hi> if by money, <hi rend="italic">interest;</hi> 
if by exchange, <hi rend="italic">advantage gain, profit</hi> (three things which 
must not be confounded with the wages or legitimate price of labor). 
</p> 
<p>Increase &mdash; a sort of royal prerogative, of tangible and consumable 
homage &mdash; is due to the proprietor on account of his nominal and 
metaphysical occupancy.  His seal is set upon the thing; that is enough to 
prevent any one else from occupying it without <hi rend="italic">his</hi> 
permission. 
</p> 
<p>This permission to use his things the proprietor may, if he 
chooses, freely grant.  Commonly he sells it.  This sale is really a 
stellionate and an extortion; but by the legal fiction of the right of 
property, this same sale, severely punished, we know not why, in other 
cases, is a source of profit and value to the proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>The amount demanded by the proprietor, in payment for this 
permission, is expressed in monetary terms by the dividend which the 
supposed product yields in nature.  So that, by the right of increase, the 
proprietor reaps and does not plough; gleans and does not till; consumes 
and does not produce; enjoys and does not labor.  Very different from 
the idols of the Psalmist are the gods of property: the former had hands 
and felt not; the latter, on the contrary, <hi rend="italic">manus habent et 
palpabunt</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The right of increase is conferred in a very mysterious and 
supernatural manner.  The inauguration of a proprietor is accompanied 
by the awful ceremonies of an ancient initia 
<pb n="155"/> tion.  First, comes the <hi rend="italic">consecration</hi> of the 
article; a consecration which makes known to all that they must offer up 
a suitable sacrifice to the proprietor, whenever they wish, by his 
permission obtained and signed, to use his article. 
</p> 
<p>Second, comes the <hi rend="italic">anathema</hi>, which prohibits &mdash; 
except on the conditions aforesaid &mdash; all persons from touching the 
article, even in the proprietor's absence; and pronounces every violator 
of property sacrilegious, infamous, amenable to the secular power, and 
deserving of being handed over to it. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, the <hi rend="italic">dedication</hi>, which enables the proprietor 
or patron saint &mdash; the god chosen to watch over the article &mdash; to inhabit it 
mentally, like a divinity in his sanctuary.  By means of this dedication, 
the substance of the article &mdash; so to speak &mdash; becomes converted into the 
person of the proprietor, who is regarded as ever present in its form. 
</p> 
<p>This is exactly the doctrine of the writers on jurisprudence.  
&ldquo;Property,&rdquo; says Toullier, &ldquo;is a <hi rend="italic">moral 
quality</hi> inherent in a thing; <hi rend="italic">an actual bond</hi> which 
fastens it to the proprietor, and which cannot be broken save by his 
act.&rdquo;  Locke humbly doubted whether God could make matter 
<hi rend="italic">intelligent</hi>.  Toullier asserts that the proprietor renders it 
<hi rend="italic">moral</hi>.  How much does he lack of being a God?  These 
are by no means exaggerations. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Property is the right of increase;</hi> that is, the power 
to produce without labor.  Now, to produce without labor is to make 
something from nothing; in short, to create.  Surely it is no more 
difficult to do this than to moralize matter.  The jurists are right, then, in 
applying to proprietors this passage from the Scriptures, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Ego 
dixi:  Dii estis et filii Excelsi omnes</hi>, &mdash; &ldquo;I have said, Ye 
are gods; and all of you are children of the Most High.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Property is the right of increase</hi>.  To us this axiom 
shall  
<pb n="156"/> be like the name of the beast in the Apocalypse, &mdash; a 
name in which is hidden the complete explanation of the whole mystery 
of this beast.  It was known that he who should solve the mystery of this 
name would obtain a knowledge of the whole prophecy, and would 
succeed in mastering the beast.  Well! by the most careful interpretation 
of our axiom we shall kill the sphinx of property.  Starting from this 
eminently characteristic fact &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">right of increase</hi> &mdash; we 
shall pursue the old serpent through his coils; we shall count the 
murderous entwinings of this frightful t&aelig;nia, whose head, with its 
thousand suckers, is always hidden from the sword of its most violent 
enemies, though abandoning to them immense fragments of its body.  It 
requires something more than courage to subdue this monster.  It was 
written that it should not die until a proletaire, armed with a magic 
wand, had fought with it. 
</p> 
<p>COROLLARIES. &mdash; 1. <hi rend="italic">The amount of increase is 
proportional to the thing increased</hi>.  Whatever be the rate of 
interest, &mdash; whether it rise to three, five, or ten per cent., or fall to one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, &mdash; it does not matter; the law of increase 
remains the same.  The law is as follows: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>All capital &mdash; the cash value of which can be estimated &mdash; may be 
considered as a term in an arithmetical series which progresses in the 
ratio of one hundred, and the revenue yielded by this capital as the 
corresponding term of another arithmetical series which progresses in a 
ratio equal to the rate of interest.  Thus, a capital of five hundred francs 
being the fifth term of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is one 
hundred, its revenue at three per cent. will be indicated by the fifth term 
of the arithmetical progression whose ratio is three: &mdash;  
 
100  .  200  .  300  .  400  .  500. 
 3   .   6   .   9   .   12  .   15. 
 
 
<pb n="157"/>  
</p> 
<p>An acquaintance with this sort of <hi rend="italic">logarithms</hi> &mdash; tables 
of which, calculated to a very high degree, are possessed by proprietors 
&mdash; will give us the key to the most puzzling problems, and cause us to 
experience a series of surprises. 
</p> 
<p>By this <hi rend="italic">logarithmic</hi> theory of the right of increase, a 
piece of property, together with its income, may be defined as <hi rend="italic">a 
number whose logarithm is equal to the sum of its units divided by one 
hundred, and multiplied by the rate of interest</hi>.  For instance; a 
house valued at one hundred thousand francs, and leased at five per 
cent., yields a revenue of five thousand francs, according to the formula 
100,000 x 5 / 100 = five thousand.  <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>, a piece of 
land which yields, at two and a half per cent., a revenue of three 
thousand francs is worth one hundred and twenty thousand francs, 
according to this other formula; 3,000 x 100 / 2 1/2 = one hundred and 
twenty thousand. 
</p> 
<p>In the first case, the ratio of the progression which marks the 
increase of interest is five; in the second, it is two and a half. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Observation</hi>. &mdash; The forms of increase known as 
farm-rent, income, and interest are paid annually; rent is paid by the 
week, the month, or the year; profits and gains are paid at the time of 
exchange.  Thus, the amount of increase is proportional both to the thing 
increased, and the time during which it increases; in other words, usury 
grows like a cancer &mdash; <hi rend="italic">f&oelig;nus serpit sicut cancer</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">The increase paid to the proprietor by the occupant is a 
dead loss to the latter</hi>.  For if the proprietor owed, in exchange 
for the increase which he receives, some thing more than the permission 
which he grants, his right of property would not be perfect &mdash; he would 
not possess <hi rend="italic">jure optimo, jure perfecto;</hi>  that is, he would 
not be in reality a proprietor.  Then, all which passes from the hands of 
the occupant into  
<pb n="158"/> those of the proprietor in the name of increase, and as 
the price of the permission to occupy, is a permanent gain for the latter, 
and a dead loss and annihilation for the former; to whom none of it will 
return, save in the forms of gift, alms, wages paid for his services, or 
the price of merchandise which he has delivered.  In a word, increase 
perishes so far as the borrower is concerned; or to use the more 
energetic Latin phrase, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">res perit solventi</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">The right of increase oppresses the proprietor as well as 
the stranger</hi>.  The master of a thing, as its proprietor, levies a tax 
for the use of his property upon himself as its possessor, equal to that 
which he would receive from a third party; so that capital bears interest 
in the hands of the capitalist, as well as in those of the borrower and the 
<hi rend="italic">commandit&eacute;</hi>.  If, indeed, rather than accept a rent 
of five hundred francs for my apartment, I prefer to occupy and enjoy it, 
it is clear that I shall become my own debtor for a rent equal to that 
which I deny myself.  This principle is universally practised in business, 
and is regarded as an axiom by the economists.  Manufacturers, also, 
who have the advantage of being proprietors of their floating capital, 
although they owe no interest to any one, in calculating their profits 
subtract from them, not only their running expenses and the wages of 
their employees, but also the interest on their capital.  For the same 
reason, money-lenders retain in their own possession as little money as 
possible; for, since all capital necessarily bears interest, if this interest is 
supplied by no one, it comes out of the capital, which is to that extent 
diminished.  Thus, by the right of increase, capital eats itself up.  This 
is, doubtless, the idea that Papinius intended to convey in the phrase, as 
elegant as it is forcible &mdash; <hi rend="italic">F&oelig;nus mordet solidam</hi>.  I 
beg pardon for using Latin so frequently in discussing this subject; it is 
an  
<pb n="159"/> homage which I pay to the most usurious nation that 
ever existed. 
 
 
FIRST PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because it demands Something for 
Nothing</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The discussion of this proposition covers the same ground as that 
of the origin of farm-rent, which is so much debated by the economists.  
When I read the writings of the greater part of these men, I cannot avoid 
a feeling of contempt mingled with anger, in view of this mass of 
nonsense, in which the detestable vies with the absurd.  It would be a 
repetition of the story of the elephant in the moon, were it not for the 
atrocity of the consequences.  To seek a rational and legitimate origin of 
that which is, and ever must be, only robbery, extortion, and plunder &mdash; 
that must be the height of the proprietor's folly; the last degree of 
bedevilment into which minds, otherwise judicious, can be thrown by the 
perversity of selfishness. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A farmer,&rdquo; says Say, &ldquo;is a wheat 
manufacturer who, among other tools which serve him in modifying the 
material from which he makes the wheat, employs one large tool, which 
we call a field.  If he is not the proprietor of the field, if he is only a 
tenant, he pays the proprietor for the productive service of this tool.  
The tenant is reimbursed by the purchaser, the latter by another, until the 
product reaches the consumer; who redeems the first payment, 
<hi rend="italic">plus</hi> all the others, by means of which the product has at 
last come into his hands.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Let us lay aside the subsequent payments by which the product 
reaches the consumer, and, for the present, pay attention only to the first 
one of all, &mdash; the rent paid to the proprietor by the tenant.  On what 
ground, we ask, is the proprietor entitled to this rent? 
</p> 
<p>According to Ricardo, MacCulloch, and Mill, farm-rent, 
 
<pb n="160"/> properly speaking, is simply the <hi rend="italic">excess of the 
product of the most fertile land over that of lands of an inferior 
quality;</hi> so that farm-rent is not demanded for the former until the 
increase of population renders necessary the cultivation of the latter. 
</p> 
<p>It is difficult to see any sense in this.  How can a right to the land 
be based upon a difference in the quality of the land?  How can varieties 
of soil engender a principle of legislation and politics?  This reasoning is 
either so subtle, or so stupid, that the more I think of it, the more 
bewildered I become.  Suppose two pieces of land of equal area; the 
one, A, capable of supporting ten thousand inhabitants; the other, B, 
capable of supporting nine thousand only: when, owing to an increase in 
their number, the inhabitants of A shall be forced to cultivate B, the 
landed proprietors of A will exact from their tenants in A a rent 
proportional to the difference between ten and nine.  So say, I think, 
Ricardo, Macculloch, and Mill.  But if A supports as many inhabitants 
as it can contain, &mdash; that is, if the inhabitants of A, by our hypothesis, 
have only just enough land to keep them alive, &mdash; how can they pay 
farm-rent? 
</p> 
<p>If they had gone no farther than to say that the difference in land 
has <hi rend="italic">occasioned</hi> farm-rent, instead of <hi rend="italic">caused</hi> 
it, this observation would have taught us a valuable lesson; namely, that 
farm-rent grew out of a desire for equality.  Indeed, if all men have an 
equal right to the possession of good land, no one can be forced to 
cultivate bad land without indemnification.  Farm-rent &mdash; according to 
Ricardo, Macculloch, and Mill &mdash; would then have been a compensation 
for loss and hardship.  This system of practical equality is a bad one, no 
doubt; but it sprang from good intentions.  What argument can Ricardo, 
Maculloch [sic] , and Mill develop therefrom in favor  
<pb n="161"/> of property?  Their theory turns against themselves, and 
strangles them. 
</p> 
<p>Malthus thinks that farm-rent has its source in the power possessed 
by land of producing more than is necessary to supply the wants of the 
men who cultivate it.  I would ask Malthus why successful labor should 
entitle the idle to a portion of the products? 
</p> 
<p>But the worthy Malthus is mistaken in regard to the fact.  Yes; 
land has the power of producing more than is needed by those who 
cultivate it, if by <hi rend="italic">cultivators</hi> is meant tenants only.  The 
tailor also makes more clothes than he wears, and the cabinet-maker 
more furniture than he uses.  But, since the various professions imply 
and sustain one another, not only the farmer, but the followers of all arts 
and trades &mdash; even to the doctor and the school-teacher &mdash; are, and ought 
to be, regarded as <hi rend="italic">cultivators of the land</hi>.  Malthus bases 
farm-rent upon the principle of commerce.  Now, the fundamental law of 
commerce being equivalence of the products exchanged, any thing which 
destroys this equivalence violates the law.  There is an error in the 
estimate which needs to be corrected. 
</p> 
<p>Buchanan &mdash; a commentator on Smith &mdash; regarded farm-rent as the 
result of a monopoly, and maintained that labor alone is productive.  
Consequently, he thought that, without this monopoly, products would 
rise in price; and he found no basis for farm-rent save in the civil law.  
This opinion is a corollary of that which makes the civil law the basis of 
property.  But why has the civil law &mdash; which ought to be the written 
expression of justice &mdash; authorized this monopoly?  Whoever says 
monopoly, necessarily excludes justice.  Now, to say that farm-rent is a 
monopoly sanctioned by the law, is to say that injustice is based on 
justice, &mdash; a contradiction in terms. 
 
<pb n="162"/>  
</p> 
<p>Say answers Buchanan, that the proprietor is not a monopolist, 
because a monopolist &ldquo;is one who does not increase the utility of 
the merchandise which passes through his hands.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>How much does the proprietor increase the utility of his tenant's 
products?  Has he ploughed, sowed, reaped, mowed, winnowed, 
weeded?  These are the processes by which the tenant and his employees 
increase the utility of the material which they consume for the purpose of 
reproduction. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The landed proprietor increases the utility of products by 
means of his implement, the land.  This implement receives in one state, 
and returns in another the materials of which wheat is composed.  The 
action of the land is a chemical process, which so modifies the material 
that it multiplies it by destroying it.  The soil is then a producer of 
utility; and when it [the soil?] asks its pay in the form of profit, or farm 
rent, for its proprietor, it at the same time gives something to the 
consumer in exchange for the amount which the consumer pays it.  It 
gives him a produced utility; and it is the production of this utility which 
warrants us in calling land productive, as well as labor.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Let us clear up this matter. 
</p> 
<p>The blacksmith who manufactures for the farmer implements of 
husbandry, the wheelwright who makes him a cart, the mason who 
builds his barn, the carpenter, the basket-maker, &amp;c., &mdash; all of whom 
contribute to agricultural production by the tools which they provide, &mdash; 
are producers of utility; consequently, they are entitled to a part of the 
products. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; says Say; &ldquo;but the land also 
is an implement whose service must be paid for, then. . . .&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>I admit that the land is an implement; but who made it?  Did the 
proprietor?  Did he &mdash; by the efficacious virtue of the right of property, 
by this <hi rend="italic">moral quality</hi> infused into the soil &mdash; endow it with 
vigor and fertility?  Exactly there lies the monopoly of the proprietor; in 
the fact that, though he  
<pb n="163"/> did not make the implement, he asks pay for its use.  
When the Creator shall present himself and claim farm-rent, we will 
consider the matter with him; or even when the proprietor &mdash; his 
pretended representative &mdash; shall exhibit his power-of-attorney. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The proprietor's service,&rdquo; adds Say, &ldquo;is 
easy, I admit.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>It is a frank confession. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But we cannot disregard it.  Without property, one farmer 
would contend with another for the possession of a field without a 
proprietor, and the field would remain uncultivated. . . .&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Then the proprietor's business is to reconcile farmers by robbing 
them.  O logic!  O justice!  O the marvellous wisdom of economists!  
The proprietor, if they are right, is like Perrin-Dandin who, when 
summoned by two travellers to settle a dispute about an oyster, opened 
it, gobbled it, and said to them: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Court awards you each a shell.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Could any thing worse be said of property? 
</p> 
<p>Will Say tell us why the same farmers, who, if there were no 
proprietors, would contend with each other for possession of the soil, do 
not contend to-day with the proprietors for this possession?  Obviously, 
because they think them legitimate possessors, and because their respect 
for even an imaginary right exceeds their avarice.  I proved, in Chapter 
II., that possession is sufficient, without property, to maintain social 
order.  Would it be more difficult, then, to reconcile possessors without 
masters than tenants controlled by proprietors?  Would laboring men, 
who respect &mdash; much to their own detriment &mdash; the pretended rights of the 
idler, violate the natural rights of the producer and the manufacturer?  
What! if the  
<pb n="164"/> husbandman forfeited his right to the land as soon as he 
ceased to occupy it, would he become more covetous?  And would the 
impossibility of demanding increase, of taxing another's labor, be a 
source of quarrels and law-suits?  The economists use singular logic.  
But we are not yet through.  Admit that the proprietor is the legitimate 
master of the land. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The land is an instrument of production,&rdquo; they say.  
That is true.  But when, changing the noun into an adjective, they alter 
the phrase, thus, &ldquo;The land is a productive instrument,&rdquo; 
they make a wicked blunder. 
</p> 
<p>According to Quesnay and the early economists, all production 
comes from the land.  Smith, Ricardo, and de Tracy, on the contrary, 
say that labor is the sole agent of production.  Say, and most of his 
successors, teach that <hi rend="italic">both</hi> land <hi rend="italic">and</hi> labor 
<hi rend="italic">and</hi> capital are productive.  The latter constitute the 
eclectic school of political economy.  The truth is, that 
<hi rend="italic">neither</hi> land <hi rend="italic">nor</hi> labor <hi rend="italic">nor</hi> 
capital is productive.  Production results from the co-operation of these 
three equally necessary elements, which, taken separately, are equally 
sterile. 
</p> 
<p>Political economy, indeed, treats of the production, distribution, 
and consumption of wealth or values.  But of what values?  Of the 
values produced by human industry; that is, of the changes made in 
matter by man, that he may appropriate it to his own use, and not at all 
of Nature's spontaneous productions.  Man's labor consists in a simple 
laying on of hands.  When he has taken that trouble, he has produced a 
value.  Until then, the salt of the sea, the water of the springs, the grass 
of the fields, and the trees of the forests are to him as if they were not.  
The sea, without the fisherman and his line, supplies no fish.  The 
forest, without the wood-cutter and his axe, furnishes neither fuel nor 
timber.   
<pb n="165"/> The meadow, without the mower, yields neither hay nor 
aftermath.  Nature is a vast mass of material to be cultivated and 
converted into products; but Nature produces nothing for herself: in the 
economical sense, her products, in their relation to man, are not yet 
products. 
</p> 
<p>Capital, tools, and machinery are likewise unproductive.  The 
hammer and the anvil, without the blacksmith and the iron, do not forge.  
The mill, without the miller and the grain, does not grind, &amp;c.  Bring 
tools and raw material together; place a plough and some seed on fertile 
soil; enter a smithy, light the fire, and shut up the shop, &mdash; you will 
produce nothing.  The following remark was made by an economist who 
possessed more good sense than most of his fellows:  &ldquo;Say 
credits capital with an active part unwarranted by its nature; left to itself, 
it is an idle tool.&rdquo;  (<hi rend="italic">J. Droz: Political Economy</hi>.) 
</p> 
<p>Finally, labor and capital together, when unfortunately combined, 
produce nothing.  Plough a sandy desert, beat the water of the rivers, 
pass type through a sieve, &mdash; you will get neither wheat, nor fish, nor 
books.  Your trouble will be as fruitless as was the immense labor of the 
army of Xerxes; who, as Herodotus says, with his three million soldiers, 
scourged the Hellespont for twenty-four hours, as a punishment for 
having broken and scattered the pontoon bridge which the great king had 
thrown across it. 
</p> 
<p>Tools and capital, land and labor, considered individually and 
abstractly, are not, literally speaking, productive.  The proprietor who 
asks to be rewarded for the use of a tool, or the productive power of his 
land, takes for granted, then, that which is radically false; namely, that 
capital produces by its own effort, &mdash; and, in taking pay for this 
imaginary product, he literally receives something for nothing. 
 
<pb n="166"/>  
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Objection</hi>. &mdash; But if the blacksmith, the wheelwright, 
all manufacturers in short, have a right to the products in return for the 
implements which they furnish; and if land is an implement of 
production, &mdash; why does not this implement entitle its proprietor, be his 
claim real or imaginary, to a portion of the products; as in the case of 
the manufacturers of ploughs and wagons? 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>. &mdash; Here we touch the heart of the question, 
the mystery of property; which we must clear up, if we would 
understand any thing of the strange effects of the right of increase. 
</p> 
<p>He who manufactures or repairs the farmer's tools receives the 
price <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, either at the time of delivery, or in several 
payments; and when this price is once paid to the manufacturer, the tools 
which he has delivered belong to him no more.  Never does he claim 
double payment for the same tool, or the same job of repairs.  If he 
annually shares in the products of the farmer, it is owing to the fact that 
he annually makes something for the farmer. 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor, on the contrary, does not yield his implement; 
eternally he is paid for it, eternally he keeps it. 
</p> 
<p>In fact, the rent received by the proprietor is not intended to defray 
the expense of maintaining and repairing the implement; this expense is 
charged to the borrower, and does not concern the proprietor except as 
he is interested in the preservation of the article.  If he takes it upon 
himself to attend to the repairs, he takes care that the money which he 
expends for this purpose is repaid. 
</p> 
<p>This rent does not represent the product of the implement, since of 
itself the implement produces nothing; we have just proved this, and we 
shall prove it more clearly still by its consequences. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, this rent does not represent the participation of the 
 
<pb n="167"/> proprietor in the production; since this participation 
could consist, like that of the blacksmith and the wheelwright, only in 
the surrender of the whole or a part of his implement, in which case he 
would cease to be its proprietor, which would involve a contradiction of 
the idea of property. 
</p> 
<p>Then, between the proprietor and his tenant there is no exchange 
either of values or services; then, as our axiom says, farm-rent is real 
increase, &mdash; an extortion based solely upon fraud and violence on the one 
hand, and weakness and ignorance upon the other.  
<hi rend="italic">Products</hi> say the economists, <hi rend="italic">are bought only by 
products</hi>.  This maxim is property's condemnation.  The 
proprietor, producing neither by his own labor nor by his implement, 
and receiving products in exchange for nothing, is either a parasite or a 
thief.  Then, if property can exist only as a right, property is impossible. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Corollaries</hi>. &mdash; 1. The republican constitution of 
1793, which defined property as &ldquo;the right to enjoy the fruit of 
one's labor,&rdquo; was grossly mistaken.  It should have said, 
&ldquo;Property is the right to enjoy and dispose at will of another's 
goods, &mdash; the fruit of another's industry and labor.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>2. Every possessor of lands, houses, furniture, machinery, tools, 
money, &amp;c., who lends a thing for a price exceeding the cost of repairs 
(the repairs being charged to the lender, and representing products which 
he exchanges for other products), is guilty of swindling and extortion.  
In short, all rent received (nominally as damages, but really as payment 
for a loan) is an act of property, &mdash; a robbery. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Historical Comment</hi>. &mdash; The tax which a victorious 
nation levies upon a conquered nation is genuine farm-rent.  The 
seigniorial rights abolished by the Revolution of 1789, &mdash; tithes, 
mortmain, statute-labor, &amp;c., &mdash; were different forms of the rights of 
property; and they who under the titles of nobles,  
<pb n="168"/> seigneurs, prebendaries, &amp;c. enjoyed these rights, were 
neither more nor less than proprietors.  To defend property to-day is to 
condemn the Revolution. 
 
 
SECOND PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible because wherever it exists Production costs 
more than it is worth</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The preceding proposition was legislative in its nature; this one is 
economical.  It serves to prove that property, which originates in 
violence, results in waste. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Production,&rdquo; says Say, &ldquo;is exchange on a 
large scale.  To render the exchange productive the value of the whole 
amount of service must be balanced by the value of the product.  If this 
condition is not complied with, the exchange is unequal; the producer 
gives more than he receives.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Now, value being necessarily based upon utility, it follows that 
every useless product is necessarily valueless, &mdash; that it cannot be 
exchanged; and, consequently, that it cannot be given in payment for 
productive services. 
</p> 
<p>Then, though production may equal consumption, it never can 
exceed it; for there is no real production save where there is a 
production of utility, and there is no utility save where there is a 
possibility of consumption.  Thus, so much of every product as is 
rendered by excessive abundance inconsumable, becomes useless, 
valueless, unexchangeable, &mdash; consequently, unfit to be given in payment 
for any thing whatever, and is no longer a product. 
</p> 
<p>Consumption, on the other hand, to be legitimate, &mdash; to be true 
consumption, &mdash; must be reproductive of utility; for, if it is unproductive, 
the products which it destroys are cancelled values &mdash; things produced at 
a pure loss; a state of things  
<pb n="169"/> which causes products to depreciate in value.  Man has 
the power to destroy, but he consumes only that which he reproduces.  
Under a right system of economy, there is then an equation between 
production and consumption. 
</p> 
<p>These points established, let us suppose a community of one 
thousand families, enclosed in a territory of a given circumference, and 
deprived of foreign intercourse.  Let this community represent the human 
race, which, scattered over the face of the earth, is really isolated.  In 
fact, the difference between a community and the human race being only 
a numerical one, the economical results will be absolutely the same in 
each case. 
</p> 
<p>Suppose, then, that these thousand families, devoting themselves 
exclusively to wheat-culture, are obliged to pay to one hundred 
individuals, chosen from the mass, an annual revenue of ten per cent. on 
their product.  It is clear that, in such a case, the right of increase is 
equivalent to a tax levied in advance upon social production.  Of what 
use is this tax? 
</p> 
<p>It cannot be levied to supply the community with provisions, for 
between that and farm-rent there is nothing in common; nor to pay for 
services and products, &mdash; for the proprietors, laboring like the others, 
have labored only for themselves.  Finally, this tax is of no use to its 
recipients who, having harvested wheat enough for their own 
consumption, and not being able in a society without commerce and 
manufactures to procure any thing else in exchange for it, thereby lose 
the advantage of their income. 
</p> 
<p>In such a society, one-tenth of the product being inconsumable, 
one-tenth of the labor goes unpaid &mdash; production costs more than it is 
worth. 
</p> 
<p>Now, change three hundred of our wheat-producers into artisans of 
all kinds: one hundred gardeners and wine-<pb n="170"/> growers, sixty shoemakers and tailors, fifty carpenters 
and blacksmiths, eighty of various professions, and, that nothing may be 
lacking, seven school-masters, one mayor, one judge, and one priest; 
each industry furnishes the whole community with its special product.  
Now, the total production being one thousand, each laborer's 
consumption is one; namely, wheat, meat, and grain, 0.7; wine and 
vegetables, 0.1; shoes and clothing, 0.06; iron-work and furniture, 0.05; 
sundries, 0.08; instruction, 0.007; administration, 0.002; mass, 0.001, 
Total 1. 
</p> 
<p>But the community owes a revenue of ten per cent.; and it matters 
little whether the farmers alone pay it, or all the laborers are responsible 
for it, &mdash; the result is the same.  The farmer raises the price of his 
products in proportion to his share of the debt; the other laborers follow 
his example.  Then, after some fluctuations, equilibrium is established, 
and all pay nearly the same amount of the revenue.  It would be a grave 
error to assume that in a nation none but farmers pay farm-rent &mdash; the 
whole nation pays it. 
</p> 
<p>I say, then, that by this tax of ten per cent. each laborer's 
consumption is reduced as follows: wheat, 0.63; wine and vegetables, 
0.09; clothing and shoes, 0.054; furniture and iron-work, 0.045; other 
products, 0.072; schooling, 0.0063; administration, 0.0018; mass, 
0.0009.  Total 0.9. 
</p> 
<p>The laborer has produced 1; he consumes only 0.9.  He loses, 
then, one-tenth of the price of his labor; his production still costs more 
than it is worth.  On the other hand, the tenth received by the proprietors 
is no less a waste; for, being laborers themselves, they, like the others, 
possess in the nine-tenths of their product the wherewithal to live: they 
want for nothing.  Why should they wish their proportion of bread, 
wine, meat, clothes, shelter, &amp;c., to be doubled, if they  
<pb n="171"/> can neither consume nor exchange them?  Then farm-rent, with them as with the rest of the laborers, is a waste, and perishes 
in their hands.  Extend the hypothesis, increase the number and variety 
of the products, you still have the same result. 
</p> 
<p>Hitherto, we have considered the proprietor as taking part in the 
production, not only (as Say says) by the use of his instrument, but in an 
effective manner and by the labor of his hands.  Now, it is easy to see 
that, under such circumstances, property will never exist.  What 
happens? 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor &mdash; an essentially libidinous animal, without virtue or 
shame &mdash; is not satisfied with an orderly and disciplined life.  He loves 
property, because it enables him to do at leisure what he pleases and 
when he pleases.  Having obtained the means of life, he gives himself up 
to trivialities and indolence; he enjoys, he fritters away his time, he goes 
in quest of curiosities and novel sensations.  Property &mdash; to enjoy itself &mdash; 
has to abandon ordinary life, and busy itself in luxurious occupations and 
unclean enjoyments. 
</p> 
<p>Instead of giving up a farm-rent, which is perishing in their hands, 
and thus lightening the labor of the community, our hundred proprietors 
prefer to rest.  In consequence of this withdrawal, &mdash; the absolute 
production being diminished by one hundred, while the consumption 
remains the same, &mdash; production and consumption seem to balance.  But, 
in the first place, since the proprietors no longer labor, their 
consumption is, according to economical principles, unproductive; 
consequently, the previous condition of the community &mdash; when the labor 
of one hundred was rewarded by no products &mdash; is superseded by one in 
which the products of one hundred are consumed without labor.  The 
deficit is always the same, whichever the column of the account in which 
it is  
<pb n="172"/> expressed.  Either the maxims of political economy are 
false, or else property, which contradicts them, is impossible. 
</p> 
<p>The economists &mdash; regarding all unproductive consumption as an 
evil, as a robbery of the human race &mdash; never fail to exhort proprietors to 
moderation, labor, and economy; they preach to them the necessity of 
making themselves useful, of remunerating production for that which 
they receive from it; they launch the most terrible curses against luxury 
and laziness.  Very beautiful morality, surely; it is a pity that it lacks 
common sense.  The proprietor who labors, or, as the economists say, 
<hi rend="italic">who makes himself useful</hi>, is paid for this labor and 
utility; is he, therefore, any the less idle as concerns the property which 
he does not use, and from which he receives an income?  His condition, 
whatever he may do, is an unproductive and <hi rend="italic">felonious</hi> one; 
he cannot cease to waste and destroy without ceasing to be a proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>But this is only the least of the evils which property engenders.  
Society has to maintain some idle people, whether or no.  It will always 
have the blind, the maimed, the insane, and the idiotic.  It can easily 
support a few sluggards.  At this point, the impossibilities thicken and 
become complicated. 
 
 
THIRD PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because, with a given capital, Production 
is proportional to labor, not to property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>To pay a farm-rent of one hundred at the rate of ten per cent. of 
the product, the product must be one thousand; that the product may be 
one thousand, a force of one thousand laborers is needed.  It follows, 
that in granting a furlough, as we have just done, to our one hundred 
laborer-proprietors, all of whom had an equal right to lead the life of 
men  
<pb n="173"/> of income, &mdash; we have placed ourselves in a position 
where we are unable to pay their revenues.  In fact, the productive 
power, which at first was one thousand, being now but nine hundred, the 
production is also reduced to nine hundred, one-tenth of which is ninety.  
Either, then, ten proprietors out of the one hundred cannot be paid, &mdash; 
provided the remaining ninety are to get the whole amount of their farm-rent, &mdash; or else all must consent to a decrease of ten per cent.  For it is 
not for the laborer, who has been wanting in no particular, who has 
produced as in the past, to suffer by the withdrawal of the proprietor.  
The latter must take the consequences of his own idleness.  But, then, 
the proprietor becomes poorer for the very reason that he wishes to 
enjoy; by exercising his right, he loses it; so that property seems to 
decrease and vanish in proportion as we try to lay hold of it, &mdash; the more 
we pursue it, the more it eludes our grasp.  What sort of a right is that 
which is governed by numerical relations, and which an arithmetical 
calculation can destroy? 
</p> 
<p>The laborer-proprietor received, first, as laborer, 0.9 in wages; 
second, as proprietor, 1 in farm-rent.  He said to himself, &ldquo;My 
farm-rent is sufficient; I have enough and to spare without my 
labor.&rdquo;  And thus it is that the income upon which he calculated 
gets diminished by one-tenth, &mdash; he at the same time not even suspecting 
the cause of this diminution.  By taking part in the production, he was 
himself the creator of this tenth which has vanished; and while he 
thought to labor only for himself, he unwittingly suffered a loss in 
exchanging his products, by which he was made to pay to himself one-tenth of his own farm-rent.  Like every one else, he produced 1, and 
received but 0.9 
</p> 
<p>If, instead of nine hundred laborers, there had been but five 
hundred, the whole amount of farm-rent would have been  
<pb n="174"/> reduced to fifty; if there had been but one hundred, it 
would have fallen to ten.  We may posit, then, the following axiom as a 
law of proprietary economy: <hi rend="italic"> Increase must diminish as the 
number of idlers augments</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This first result will lead us to another more surprising still.  Its 
effect is to deliver us at one blow from all the evils of property, without 
abolishing it, without wronging proprietors, and by a highly conservative 
process. 
</p> 
<p>We have just proved that, if the farm-rent in a community of one 
thousand laborers is one hundred, that of nine hundred would be ninety, 
that of eight hundred, eighty, that of one hundred, ten, &amp;c.  So that, in a 
community where there was but one laborer, the farm-rent would be but 
0.1; no matter how great the extent and value of the land appropriated.  
Therefore, <hi rend="italic">with a given landed capital, production is proportional 
to labor, not to property</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Guided by this principle, let us try to ascertain the maximum 
increase of all property whatever. 
</p> 
<p>What is, essentially, a farm-lease?  It is a contract by which the 
proprietor yields to a tenant possession of his land, in consideration of a 
portion of that which it yields him, the proprietor.  If, in consequence of 
an increase in his household, the tenant becomes ten times as strong as 
the proprietor, he will produce ten times as much.  Would the proprietor 
in such a case be justified in raising the farm-rent tenfold?  His right is 
not, The more you produce, the more I demand.  It is, The more I 
sacrifice, the more I demand.  The increase in the tenant's household, 
the number of hands at his disposal, the resources of his industry, &mdash; all 
these serve to increase production, but bear no relation to the proprietor.  
His claims are to be measured by his own productive capacity, not that 
of others.  Property is the 
<pb n="175"/> right of increase, not a poll-tax.  How could a man, 
hardly capable of cultivating even a few acres by himself, demand of a 
community, on the ground of its use of ten thousand acres of his 
property, ten thousand times as much as he is incapable of producing 
from one acre?  Why should the price of a loan be governed by the skill 
and strength of the borrower, rather than by the utility sacrificed by the 
proprietor?  We must recognize, then, this second economical law:  
<hi rend="italic">Increase is measured by a fraction of the proprietors 
production</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this production, what is it?  In other words, What can the 
lord and master of a piece of land justly claim to have sacrificed in 
lending it to a tenant? 
</p> 
<p>The productive capacity of a proprietor, like that of any laborer, 
being one, the product which he sacrifices in surrendering his land is 
also one.  If, then, the rate of increase is ten per cent., the maximum 
increase is 0.1. 
</p> 
<p>But we have seen that, whenever a proprietor withdraws from 
production, the amount of products is lessened by 1.  Then the increase 
which accrues to him, being equal to 0.1 while he remains among the 
laborers, will be equal after his withdrawal, by the law of the decrease 
of farm-rent, to 0.09.  Thus we are led to this final formula:  <hi rend="italic">The 
maximum income of a proprietor is equal to the square root of the 
product of one laborer</hi> (some number being agreed upon to 
express this product).  <hi rend="italic">The diminution which this income suffers, 
if the proprietor is idle, is equal to a fraction whose numerator is 1, and 
whose denominator is the number which expresses the product</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Thus the maximum income of an idle proprietor, or of one who 
labors in his own behalf outside of the community, figured at ten per 
cent. on an average production of one  
<pb n="176"/> thousand francs per laborer, would be ninety francs.  If, 
then, there are in France one million proprietors with an income of one 
thousand francs each, which they consume unproductively, instead of the 
one thousand millions which are paid them annually, they are entitled in 
strict justice, and by the most accurate calculation, to ninety millions 
only. 
</p> 
<p>It is something of a reduction, to take nine hundred and ten 
millions from the burdens which weigh so heavily upon the laboring 
class!  Nevertheless, the account is not finished, and the laborer is still 
ignorant of the full extent of his rights. 
</p> 
<p>What is the right of increase when confined within just limits?  A 
recognition of the right of occupancy.  But since all have an equal right 
of occupancy, every man is by the same title a proprietor.  Every man 
has a right to an income equal to a fraction of his product.  If, then, the 
laborer is obliged by the right of property to pay a rent to the proprietor, 
the proprietor is obliged by the same right to pay the same amount of 
rent to the laborer; and, since their rights balance each other, the 
difference between them is zero. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Scholium</hi>. &mdash; If farm-rent is only a fraction of the 
supposed product of the proprietor, whatever the amount and value of 
the property, the same is true in the case of a large number of small and 
distinct proprietors.  For, although one man may use the property of 
each separately, he cannot use the property of all at the same time. 
</p> 
<p>To sum up.  The right of increase, which can exist only within 
very narrow limits, defined by the laws of production, is annihilated by 
the right of occupancy.  Now, without the right of increase, there is no 
property.  Then property is impossible. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="177"/>  
FOURTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because it is Homicide</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>If the right of increase could be subjected to the laws of reason and 
justice, it would be reduced to an indemnity or reward whose 
<hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> never could exceed, for a single laborer, a 
certain fraction of that which he is capable of producing.  This we have 
just shown.  But why should the right of increase &mdash; let us not fear to call 
it by its right name, the right of robbery &mdash; be governed by reason, with 
which it has nothing in common?  The proprietor is not content with the 
increase allotted him by good sense and the nature of things: he demands 
ten times, a hundred times, a thousand times, a million times as much.  
By his own labor, his property would yield him a product equal only to 
one; and he demands of society, no longer a right proportional to his 
productive capacity, but a <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> tax.  He taxes his 
fellows in proportion to their strength, their number, and their industry.  
A son is born to a farmer.  &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; says the proprietor; 
&ldquo;one more chance for increase!&rdquo;  By what process has 
farm-rent been thus changed into a poll-tax?  Why have our jurists and 
our theologians failed, with all their shrewdness, to check the extension 
of the right of increase? 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor, having estimated from his own productive capacity 
the number of laborers which his property will accommodate, divides it 
into as many portions, and says:  &ldquo;Each one shall yield me 
revenue.&rdquo;  To increase his income, he has only to divide his 
property.  Instead of reckoning the interest due him on his labor, he 
reckons it on his capital; and, by this substitution, the same property, 
which in the hands of its owner is capable of yielding only one, is worth 
to  
<pb n="178"/> him ten, a hundred, a thousand, a million.  
Consequently, he has only to hold himself in readiness to register the 
names of the laborers who apply to him &mdash; his task consists in drafting 
leases and receipts. 
</p> 
<p>Not satisfied with the lightness of his duties, the proprietor does 
not intend to bear even the deficit resulting from his idleness; he throws 
it upon the shoulders of the producer, of whom he always demands the 
same reward.  When the farm-rent of a piece of land is once raised to its 
highest point, the proprietor never lowers it; high prices, the scarcity of 
labor, the disadvantages of the season, even pestilence itself, have no 
effect upon him &mdash; why should he suffer from hard times when he does 
not labor? 
</p> 
<p>Here commences a new series of phenomena. 
</p> 
<p>Say &mdash; who reasons with marvellous clearness whenever he assails 
taxation, but who is blind to the fact that the proprietor, as well as the 
tax-gatherer, steals from the tenant, and in the same manner &mdash; says in 
his second letter to Malthus: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the collector of taxes and those who employ him 
consume one-sixth of the products, they thereby compel the producers to 
feed, clothe, and support themselves on five-sixths of what they produce.  
They admit this, but say at the same time that it is possible for each one 
to live on five-sixths of what he produces.  I admit that, if they insist 
upon it; but I ask if they believe that the producer would live as well, in 
case they demanded of him, instead of one-sixth, two-sixths, or one-third, of their products?  No; but he would still live.  Then I ask whether 
he would still live, in case they should rob him of two-thirds, . . . then 
three-quarters?  But I hear no reply.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>If the master of the French economists had been less blinded by his 
proprietary prejudices, he would have seen that farm-rent has precisely 
the same effect. 
</p> 
<p>Take a family of peasants composed of six persons, &mdash; father, 
mother, and four children, &mdash; living in the country, and culti 
<pb n="179"/> vating a small piece of ground.  Let us suppose that by 
hard labor they manage, as the saying is, to make both ends meet; that, 
having lodged, warmed, clothed, and fed themselves, they are clear of 
debt, but have laid up nothing.  Taking the years together, they contrive 
to live.  If the year is prosperous, the father drinks a little more wine, 
the daughters buy themselves a dress, the sons a hat; they eat a little 
cheese, and, occasionally, some meat.  I say that these people are on the 
road to wreck and ruin. 
</p> 
<p>For, by the third corollary of our axiom, they owe to themselves 
the interest on their own capital.  Estimating this capital at only eight 
thousand francs at two and a half per cent., there is an annual interest of 
two hundred francs to be paid.  If, then, these two hundred francs, 
instead of being subtracted from the gross product to be saved and 
capitalized, are consumed, there is an annual deficit of two hundred 
francs in the family assets; so that at the end of forty years these good 
people, without suspecting it, will have eaten up their property and 
become bankrupt! 
</p> 
<p>This result seems ridiculous &mdash; it is a sad reality. 
</p> 
<p>The conscription comes.  What is the conscription?  An act of 
property exercised over families by the government without warning &mdash; a 
robbery of men and money.  The peasants do not like to part with their 
sons, &mdash; in that I do not think them wrong.  It is hard for a young man of 
twenty to gain any thing by life in the barracks; unless he is depraved, 
he detests it.  You can generally judge of a soldier's morality by his 
hatred of his uniform.  Unfortunate wretches or worthless scamps, &mdash; 
such is the make-up of the French army.  This ought not to be the case, 
&mdash; but so it is.  Question a hundred thousand men, and not one will 
contradict my assertion. 
 
<pb n="180"/>  
</p> 
<p>Our peasant, in redeeming his two conscripted sons, expends four 
thousand francs, which he borrows for that purpose; the interest on this, 
at five per cent., is two hundred francs; &mdash; a sum equal to that referred to 
above.  If, up to this time, the production of the family, constantly 
balanced by its consumption, has been one thousand two hundred francs, 
or two hundred francs per persons &mdash; in order to pay this interest, either 
the six laborers must produce as much as seven, or must consume as 
little as five.  Curtail consumption they cannot &mdash; how can they curtail 
necessity?  To produce more is impossible; they can work neither harder 
nor longer.  Shall they take a middle course, and consume five and a 
half while producing six and a half?  They would soon find that with the 
stomach there is no compromise &mdash; that beyond a certain degree of 
abstinence it is impossible to go &mdash; that strict necessity can be curtailed 
but little without injury to the health; and, as for increasing the product, 
&mdash; there comes a storm, a drought, an epizootic, and all the hopes of the 
farmer are dashed.  In short, the rent will not be paid, the interest will 
accumulate, the farm will be seized, and the possessor ejected. 
</p> 
<p>Thus a family, which lived in prosperity while it abstained from 
exercising the right of property, falls into misery as soon as the exercise 
of this right becomes a necessity.  Property requires of the husbandman 
the double power of enlarging his land, and fertilizing it by a simple 
command.  While a man is simply possessor of the land, he finds in it 
means of subsistence; as soon as he pretends to proprietorship, it suffices 
him no longer.  Being able to produce only that which he consumes, the 
fruit of his labor is his recompense for his trouble &mdash; nothing is left for 
the instrument. 
</p> 
<p>Required to pay what he cannot produce, &mdash; such is the  
<pb n="181"/> condition of the tenant after the proprietor has retired 
from social production in order to speculate upon the labor of others by 
new methods. 
</p> 
<p>Let us now return to our first hypothesis. 
</p> 
<p>The nine hundred laborers, sure that their future production will 
equal that of the past, are quite surprised, after paying their farm-rent, to 
find themselves poorer by one-tenth than they were the previous year.  
In fact, this tenth &mdash; which was formerly produced and paid by the 
proprietor-laborer who then took part in the production, and paid part of 
the &mdash; public expenses &mdash; now has not been produced, and has been paid.  
It must then have been taken from the producer's consumption.  To 
choke this inexplicable deficit, the laborer borrows, confident of his 
intention and ability to return, &mdash; a confidence which is shaken the 
following year by a new loan, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> the interest on the first.  
From whom does he borrow?  From the proprietor.  The proprietor 
lends his surplus to the laborer; and this surplus, which he ought to 
return, becomes &mdash; being lent at interest &mdash; a new source of profit to him.  
Then debts increase indefinitely; the proprietor makes advances to the 
producer who never returns them; and the latter, constantly robbed and 
constantly borrowing from the robbers, ends in bankruptcy, defrauded of 
all that he had. 
</p> 
<p>Suppose that the proprietor &mdash; who needs his tenant to furnish him 
with an income &mdash; then releases him from his debts.  He will thus do a 
very benevolent deed, which will procure for him a recommendation in 
the curate's prayers; while the poor tenant, overwhelmed by this 
unstinted charity, and taught by his catechism to pray for his 
benefactors, will promise to redouble his energy, and suffer new 
hardships that he may discharge his debt to so kind a master. 
</p> 
<p>This time he takes precautionary measures; he raises the  
<pb n="182"/> price of grains.  The manufacturer does the same with 
his products.  The reaction comes, and, after some fluctuation, the farm-rent &mdash; which the tenant thought to put upon the manufacturer's shoulders 
&mdash; becomes nearly balanced.  So that, while he is congratulating himself 
upon his success, he finds himself again impoverished, but to an extent 
somewhat smaller than before.  For the rise having been general, the 
proprietor suffers with the rest; so that the laborers, instead of being 
poorer by one-tenth, lose only nine-hundredths.  But always it is a debt 
which necessitates a loan, the payment of interest, economy, and fasting.  
Fasting for the nine-hundredths which ought not to be paid, and are paid; 
fasting for the redemption of debts; fasting to pay the interest on them.  
Let the crop fail, and the fasting becomes starvation.  They say, 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">It is necessary to work more</hi>.&rdquo;  That 
means, obviously, that <hi rend="italic">it is necessary to produce more</hi>.  
By what conditions is production effected?  By the combined action of 
labor, capital, and land.  As for the labor, the tenant undertakes to 
furnish it; but capital is formed only by economy.  Now, if the tenant 
could accumulate any thing, he would pay his debts.  But granting that 
he has plenty of capital, of what use would it be to him if the extent of 
the land which he cultivates always remained the same?  He needs to 
enlarge his farm. 
</p> 
<p>Will it be said, finally, that he must work harder and to better 
advantage?  But, in our estimation of farm-rent, we have assumed the 
highest possible average of production.  Were it not the highest, the 
proprietor would increase the farm-rent.  Is not this the way in which the 
large landed proprietors have gradually raised their rents, as fast as they 
have ascertained by the increase in population and the development of 
industry how much society can produce from their  
<pb n="183"/> property?  The proprietor is a foreigner to society; but, 
like the vulture, his eyes fixed upon his prey, he holds himself ready to 
pounce upon and devour it. 
</p> 
<p>The facts to which we have called attention, in a community of one 
thousand persons, are reproduced on a large scale in every nation and 
wherever human beings live, but with infinite variations and in 
innumerable forms, which it is no part of my intention to describe. 
</p> 
<p>In fine, property &mdash; after having robbed the laborer by usury &mdash; 
murders him slowly by starvation.  Now, without robbery and murder, 
property cannot exist; with robbery and murder, it soon dies for want of 
support.  Therefore it is impossible. 
 
 
FIFTH PROPOSITION. 
 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because, if it exists, Society devours 
itself</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>When the ass is too heavily loaded, he lies down; man always 
moves on.  Upon this indomitable courage, the proprietor &mdash; well 
knowing that it exists &mdash; bases his hopes of speculation.  The free laborer 
produces ten; for me, thinks the proprietor, he will produce twelve. 
</p> 
<p>Indeed, &mdash; before consenting to the confiscation of his fields, before 
bidding farewell to the paternal roof, &mdash; the peasant, whose story we have 
just told, makes a desperate effort; he leases new land; he will sow one-third more; and, taking half of this new product for himself, he will 
harvest an additional sixth, and thereby pay his rent.  What an evil!  To 
add one-sixth to his production, the farmer must add, not one-sixth, but 
two-sixths to his labor.  At such a price, he pays a farm-rent which in 
God's eyes he does not owe. 
 
<pb n="184"/>  
</p> 
<p>The tenant's example is followed by the manufacturer.  The former 
tills more land, and dispossesses his neighbors; the latter lowers the price 
of his merchandise, and endeavors to monopolize its manufacture and 
sale, and to crush out his competitors.  To satisfy property, the laborer 
must first produce beyond his needs.  Then, he must produce beyond his 
strength; for, by the withdrawal of laborers who become proprietors, the 
one always follows from the other.  But to produce beyond his strength 
and needs, he must invade the production of another, and consequently 
diminish the number of producers.  Thus the proprietor &mdash; after having 
lessened production by stepping outside &mdash; lessens it still further by 
encouraging the monopoly of labor.  Let us calculate it. 
</p> 
<p>The laborer's deficit, after paying his rent, being, as we have seen, 
one-tenth, he tries to increase his production by this amount.  He sees no 
way of accomplishing this save by increasing his labor: this also he does.  
The discontent of the proprietors who have not received the full amount 
of their rent; the advantageous offers and promises made them by other 
farmers, whom they suppose more diligent, more industrious, and more 
reliable; the secret plots and intrigues, &mdash; all these give rise to a 
movement for the re-division of labor, and the elimination of a certain 
number of producers.  Out of nine hundred, ninety will be ejected, that 
the production of the others may be increased one-tenth.  But will the 
total product be increased?  Not in the least: there will be eight hundred 
and ten laborers producing as nine hundred, while, to accomplish their 
purpose, they would have to produce as one thousand.  Now, it having 
been proved that farm-rent is proportional to the landed capital instead of 
to labor, and that it never diminishes, the debts must continue  
<pb n="185"/> as in the past, while the labor has increased.  Here, 
then, we have a society which is continually decimating itself, and which 
would destroy itself, did not the periodical occurrence of failures, 
bankruptcies, and political and economical catastrophes re-establish 
equilibrium, and distract attention from the real causes of the universal 
distress. 
</p> 
<p>The monopoly of land and capital is followed by economical 
processes which also result in throwing laborers out of employment.  
Interest being a constant burden upon the shoulders of the farmer and the 
manufacturer, they exclaim, each speaking for himself, &ldquo;I should 
have the means wherewith to pay my rent and interest, had I not to pay 
so many hands.&rdquo;  Then those admirable inventions, intended to 
assure the easy and speedy performance of labor, become so many 
infernal machines which kill laborers by thousands. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;A few years ago, the Countess of Strafford ejected fifteen 
thousand persons from her estate, who, as tenants, added to its value.  
This act of private administration was repeated in 1820, by another large 
Scotch proprietor, towards six hundred tenants and their 
families.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Tissot: on Suicide and Revolt</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The author whom I quote, and who has written eloquent words 
concerning the revolutionary spirit which prevails in modern society, 
does not say whether he would have disapproved of a revolt on the part 
of these exiles.  For myself, I avow boldly that in my eyes it would have 
been the first of rights, and the holiest of duties; and all that I desire to-day is that my profession of faith be understood. 
</p> 
<p>Society devours itself, &mdash; 1. By the violent and periodical sacrifice 
of laborers: this we have just seen, and shall see again; 2. By the 
stoppage of the producer's consumption caused by property.  These two 
modes of suicide are at first simultaneous; but soon the first is given 
additional force by  
<pb n="186"/> the second, famine uniting with usury to render labor at 
once more necessary and more scarce. 
</p> 
<p>By the principles of commerce and political economy, that an 
industrial enterprise may be successful, its product must furnish, &mdash; 1. 
The interest on the capital employed; 2. Means for the preservation of 
this capital; 3. The wages of all the employees and contractors.  Further, 
as large a profit as possible must be realized. 
</p> 
<p>The financial shrewdness and rapacity of property is worthy of 
admiration.  Each different name which increase takes affords the 
proprietor an opportunity to receive it, &mdash; 1. In the form of interest; 2. In 
the form of profit.  For, it says, a part of the income derived from 
manufactures consists of interest on the capital employed.  If one 
hundred thousand francs have been invested in a manufacturing 
enterprise, and in a year's time five thousand francs have been received 
therefrom in addition to the expenses, there has been no profit, but only 
interest on the capital.  Now, the proprietor is not a man to labor for 
nothing.  Like the lion in the fable, he gets paid in each of his capacities; 
so that, after he has been served, nothing is left for his associates. 
 
</p> 
<l>         Ego primam tollo, nominor quia leo. 
</l> 
<l>         Secundam quia sum fortis tribuctis mihi. 
</l> 
<l>         Tum quia plus valeo, me sequetur tertia. 
</l> 
<l>         Malo adficietur, si quis quartam tetigerit. 
</l> 

<p>I know nothing prettier than this fable.  
</p> 
<l>         &ldquo;I am the contractor.  I take the first share. 
</l> 
<l>          I am the laborer, I take the second. 
</l> 
<l>          I am the capitalist, I take the third. 
</l> 
<l>          I am the proprietor, I take the whole.&rdquo;  
</l> 

<p>In four lines, Phaedrus has summed up all the forms of property. 
 
<pb n="187"/>  
</p> 
<p>I say that this interest, all the more then this profit, is impossible. 
</p> 
<p>What are laborers in relation to each other?  So many members of 
a large industrial society, to each of whom is assigned a certain portion 
of the general production, by the principle of the division of labor and 
functions.  Suppose, first, that this society is composed of but three 
individuals, &mdash;  a cattle-raiser, a tanner, and a shoemaker.  The social 
industry, then, is that of shoemaking.  If I should ask what ought to be 
each producer's share of the social product, the first schoolboy whom I 
should meet would answer, by a rule of commerce and association, that 
it should be one-third.  But it is not our duty here to balance the rights 
of laborers conventionally associated: we have to prove that, whether 
associated or not, our three workers are obliged to act as if they were; 
that, whether they will or no, they are associated by the force of things, 
by mathematical necessity. 
</p> 
<p>Three processes are required in the manufacture of shoes, &mdash; the 
rearing of cattle, the preparation of their hides, and the cutting and 
sewing.  If the hide, on leaving the farmer's stable, is worth one, it is 
worth two on leaving the tanner's pit, and three on leaving the 
shoemaker's shop.  Each laborer has produced a portion of the utility; so 
that, by adding all these portions together, we get the value of the 
article.  To obtain any quantity whatever of this article, each producer 
must pay, then, first for his own labor, and second for the labor of the 
other producers.  Thus, to obtain as many shoes as can be made from 
ten hides, the farmer will give thirty raw hides, and the tanner twenty 
tanned hides.  For, the shoes that are made from ten hides are worth 
thirty raw hides, in consequence of the extra labor bestowed upon them; 
just as twenty tanned hides are worth thirty raw hides, on account 
 
<pb n="188"/> of the tanner's labor.  But if the shoemaker demands 
thirty-three in the farmer's product, or twenty-two in the tanner's, for 
ten in his own, there will be no exchange; for, if there were, the farmer 
and the tanner, after having paid the shoemaker ten for his labor, would 
have to pay eleven for that which they had themselves sold for ten, &mdash; 
which, of course, would be impossible.[1] 
</p> 
<p>Well, this is precisely what happens whenever an emolument of 
any kind is received; be it called revenue, farm-rent, interest, or profit.  
In the little community of which we are speaking, if the shoemaker &mdash; in 
order to procure tools, buy a stock of leather, and support himself until 
he receives something from his investment &mdash; borrows money at interest, 
it is clear that to pay this interest he will have to make a profit off the 
tanner and the farmer.  But as this profit is impossible unless fraud is 
used, the interest will fall back upon the shoulders of the unfortunate 
shoemaker, and ruin him. 
</p> 
<p>I have imagined a case of unnatural simplicity.  There is no human 
society but sustains more than three vocations.  The most uncivilized 
society supports numerous industries; to-day, the number of industrial 
functions (I mean by industrial functions all useful functions) exceeds, 
perhaps, a thousand.  However numerous the occupations, the economic 
law remains the same, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">That the producer may live, his wages 
must repurchase his product</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The economists cannot be ignorant of this rudimentary principle of 
their pretended science: why, then, do they so obstinately defend 
property, and inequality of wages, and 
 
 
[1]  There is an error in the author's calculation here; but the translator, 
feeling sure that the reader will understand Proudhon's meaning, prefers 
not to alter his figures. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Translator</hi>. 
 
 
 
<pb n="189"/> the legitimacy of usury, and the honesty of profit, &mdash; all 
of which contradict the economic law, and make exchange impossible?  
A contractor pays one hundred thousand francs for raw material, fifty 
thousand francs in wages, and then expects to receive a product of two 
hundred thousand francs, &mdash; that is, expects to make a profit on the 
material and on the labor of his employees; but if the laborers and the 
purveyor of the material cannot, with their combined wages, repurchase 
that which they have produced for the contractor, how can they live?  I 
will develop my question.  Here details become necessary. 
</p> 
<p>If the workingman receives for his labor an average of three francs 
per day, his employer (in order to gain any thing beyond his own salary, 
if only interest on his capital) must sell the day's labor of his employee, 
in the form of merchandise, for more than three francs.  The 
workingman cannot, then, repurchase that which he has produced for his 
master.  It is thus with all trades whatsoever.  The tailor, the hatter, the 
cabinet-maker, the blacksmith, the tanner, the mason, the jeweller, the 
printer, the clerk, &amp;c., even to the farmer and wine-grower, cannot 
repurchase their products; since, producing for a master who in one form 
or another makes a profit, they are obliged to pay more for their own 
labor than they get for it. 
</p> 
<p>In France, twenty millions of laborers, engaged in all the branches 
of science, art, and industry, produce every thing which is useful to 
man.  Their annual wages amount, it is estimated.  to twenty thousand 
millions; but, in consequence of the right of property, and the 
multifarious forms of increase, premiums, tithes, interests, fines, profits, 
farm-rents, house-rents, revenues, emoluments of every nature and 
description, their products are estimated by the proprietors and 
employers  
<pb n="190"/> at twenty-five thousand millions.  What does that 
signify?  That the laborers, who are obliged to repurchase these products 
in order to live, must either pay five for that which they produced for 
four, or fast one day in five. 
</p> 
<p>If there is an economist in France able to show that this calculation 
is false, I summon him to appear; and I promise to retract all that I have 
wrongfully and wickedly uttered in my attacks upon property. 
</p> 
<p>Let us now look at the results of this profit. 
</p> 
<p>If the wages of the workingmen were the same in all pursuits, the 
deficit caused by the proprietor's tax would be felt equally everywhere; 
but also the cause of the evil would be so apparent, that it would soon be 
discovered and suppressed.  But, as there is the same inequality of wages 
(from that of the scavenger up to that of the minister of state) as of 
property, robbery continually rebounds from the stronger to the weaker; 
so that, since the laborer finds his hardships increase as he descends in 
the social scale, the lowest class of people are literally stripped naked 
and eaten alive by the others. 
</p> 
<p>The laboring people can buy neither the cloth which they weave, 
nor the furniture which they manufacture, nor the metal which they 
forge, nor the jewels which they cut, nor the prints which they engrave.  
They can procure neither the wheat which they plant, nor the wine which 
they grow, nor the flesh of the animals which they raise.  They are 
allowed neither to dwell in the houses which they build, nor to attend the 
plays which their labor supports, nor to enjoy the rest which their body 
requires.  And why?  Because the right of increase does not permit these 
things to be sold at the cost-price, which is all that laborers can afford to 
pay.  On the signs of those magnificent warehouses which he in 
 
<pb n="191"/> his poverty admires, the laborer reads in large letters:  
&ldquo;This is thy work, and thou shalt not have it.&rdquo;  <hi rend="italic">Sic 
vos non vobis</hi>! 
</p> 
<p>Every manufacturer who employs one thousand laborers, and gains 
from them daily one sou each, is slowly pushing them into a state of 
misery.  Every man who makes a profit has entered into a conspiracy 
with famine.  But the whole nation has not even this labor, by means of 
which property starves it.  And why?  Because the workers are forced by 
the insufficiency of their wages to monopolize labor; and because, before 
being destroyed by dearth, they destroy each other by competition.  Let 
us pursue this truth no further. 
</p> 
<p>If the laborer's wages will not purchase his product, it follows that 
the product is not made for the producer.  For whom, then, is it 
intended?  For the richer consumer; that is, for only a fraction of 
society.  But when the whole society labors, it produces for the whole 
society.  If, then, only a part of society consumes, sooner or later a part 
of society will be idle.  Now, idleness is death, as well for the laborer as 
for the proprietor.  This conclusion is inevitable. 
</p> 
<p>The most distressing spectacle imaginable is the sight of producers 
resisting and struggling against this mathematical necessity, this power of 
figures to which their prejudices blind them. 
</p> 
<p>If one hundred thousand printers can furnish reading-matter enough 
for thirty-four millions of men, and if the price of books is so high that 
only one-third of that number can afford to buy them, it is clear that 
these one hundred thousand printers will produce three times as much as 
the booksellers can sell.  That the products of the laborers may never 
exceed the demands of the consumers, the laborers must either rest two 
days out of three, or, separating into three groups, relieve each other 
three times a week, month, or  
<pb n="192"/> quarter; that is, during two-thirds of their life they must 
not live.  But industry, under the influence of property, does not proceed 
with such regularity.  It endeavors to produce a great deal in a short 
time, because the greater the amount of products, and the shorter the 
time of production, the less each product costs.  As soon as a demand 
begins to be felt, the factories fill up, and everybody goes to work.  
Then business is lively, and both governors and governed rejoice.  But 
the more they work to-day, the more idle will they be hereafter; the 
more they laugh, the more they shall weep.  Under the rule of property, 
the flowers of industry are woven into none but funeral wreaths.  The 
laborer digs his own grave. 
</p> 
<p>If the factory stops running, the manufacturer has to pay interest 
on his capital the same as before.  He naturally tries, then, to continue 
production by lessening expenses.  Then comes the lowering of wages; 
the introduction of machinery; the employment of women and children to 
do the work of men; bad workmen, and wretched work.  They still 
produce, because the decreased cost creates a larger market; but they do 
not produce long, because, the cheapness being due to the quantity and 
rapidity of production, the productive power tends more than ever to 
outstrip consumption.  It is when laborers, whose wages are scarcely 
sufficient to support them from one day to another, are thrown out of 
work, that the consequences of the principle of property become most 
frightful.  They have not been able to economize, they have made no 
savings, they have accumulated no capital whatever to support them even 
one day more.  Today the factory is closed.  To-morrow the people 
starve in the streets.  Day after tomorrow they will either die in the 
hospital, or eat in the jail. 
</p> 
<p>And still new misfortunes come to complicate this terrible 
 
<pb n="193"/> situation.  In consequence of the cessation of business, 
and the extreme cheapness of merchandise, the manufacturer finds it 
impossible to pay the interest on his borrowed capital; whereupon his 
frightened creditors hasten to withdraw their funds.  Production is 
suspended, and labor comes to a standstill.  Then people are astonished 
to see capital desert commerce, and throw itself upon the Stock 
Exchange; and I once heard M. Blanqui bitterly lamenting the blind 
ignorance of capitalists.  The cause of this movement of capital is very 
simple; but for that very reason an economist could not understand it, or 
rather must not explain it.  The cause lies solely in 
<hi rend="italic">competition</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>I mean by competition, not only the rivalry between two parties 
engaged in the same business, but the general and simultaneous effort of 
all kinds of business to get ahead of each other.  This effort is to-day so 
strong, that the price of merchandise scarcely covers the cost of 
production and distribution; so that, the wages of all laborers being 
lessened, nothing remains, not even interest for the capitalists. 
</p> 
<p>The primary cause of commercial and industrial stagnations is, 
then, interest on capital, &mdash; that interest which the ancients with one 
accord branded with the name of usury, whenever it was paid for the use 
of money, but which they did not dare to condemn in the forms of 
house-rent, farm-rent, or profit: as if the nature of the thing lent could 
ever warrant a charge for the lending; that is, robbery. 
</p> 
<p>In proportion to the increase received by the capitalist will be the 
frequency and intensity of commercial crises, &mdash; the first being given, we 
always can determine the two others; and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>.  Do 
you wish to know the regulator of a society?  Ascertain the amount of 
active capital; that is, the capital bearing interest, and the legal rate of 
this interest.   
<pb n="194"/> The course of events will be a series of overturns, 
whose number and violence will be proportional to the activity of capital. 
</p> 
<p>In 1839, the number of failures in Paris alone was one thousand 
and sixty-four.  This proportion was kept up in the early months of 
1840; and, as I write these lines, the crisis is not yet ended.  It is said, 
further, that the number of houses which have wound up their business is 
greater than the number of declared failures.  By this flood, we may 
judge of the waterspout's power of suction. 
</p> 
<p>The decimation of society is now imperceptible and permanent, 
now periodical and violent; it depends upon the course which property 
takes.  In a country where the property is pretty evenly distributed, and 
where little business is done, &mdash; the rights and claims of each being 
balanced by those of others, &mdash; the power of invasion is destroyed.  
There &mdash; it may be truly said &mdash; property does not exist, since the right of 
increase is scarcely exercised at all.  The condition of the laborers &mdash; as 
regards security of life &mdash; is almost the same as if absolute equality 
prevailed among them.  They are deprived of all the advantages of full 
and free association, but their existence is not endangered in the least.  
With the exception of a few isolated victims of the right of property &mdash; of 
this misfortune whose primary cause no one perceives &mdash; the society 
appears to rest calmly in the bosom of this sort of equality.  But have a 
care; it is balanced on the edge of a sword: at the slightest shock, it will 
fall and meet with death! 
</p> 
<p>Ordinarily, the whirlpool of property localizes itself.  On the one 
hand, farm-rent stops at a certain point; on the other, in consequence of 
competition and over-production, the price of manufactured goods does 
not rise, &mdash; so that the condition of the peasant varies but little, and 
depends mainly on the  
<pb n="195"/> seasons.  The devouring action of property bears, then, 
principally upon business.  We commonly say <hi rend="italic">commercial 
crises</hi>, not <hi rend="italic">agricultural crises;</hi> because, while the 
farmer is eaten up slowly by the right of increase, the manufacturer is 
swallowed at a single mouthful.  This leads to the cessation of business, 
the destruction of fortunes, and the inactivity of the working people; who 
die one after another on the highways, and in the hospitals, prisons, and 
galleys. 
</p> 
<p>To sum up this proposition: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Property sells products to the laborer for more than it pays him for 
them; therefore it is impossible. 
 
 
APPENDIX TO THE FIFTH PROPOSITION. 
 
</p> 
<p>I. Certain reformers, and even the most of the publicists &mdash; who, 
though belonging to no particular school, busy themselves in devising 
means for the amelioration of the lot of the poorer and more numerous 
class &mdash; lay much stress now-a-days on a better organization of labor.  
The disciples of Fourier, especially, never stop shouting, 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">On to the phalanx</hi>!&rdquo; declaiming in the 
same breath against the foolishness and absurdity of other sects.  They 
consist of half-a-dozen incomparable geniuses who have discovered that 
<hi rend="italic">five and four make nine; take two away, and nine remain</hi>, 
&mdash; and who weep over the blindness of France, who refuses to believe in 
this astonishing arithmetic.[1] 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] Fourier, having to multiply a whole number by a fraction, 
never failed, they say, to obtain a product much greater than the 
multiplicand.  He affirmed that under his system of harmony the 
mercury would solidify when the temperature was above zero.  He might 
as well have said that the Harmonians would make burning ice.  I once 
asked an intelligent phalansterian what he thought of such physics.  
&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I 
believe.&rdquo;  And yet the same man disbelieved in the doctrine of 
the Real Presence.   
 
 
<pb n="196"/>  
</p> 
<p>In fact, the Fourierists proclaim themselves, on the one hand, 
defenders of property, of the right of increase, which they have thus 
formulated:  <hi rend="italic">To each according to his capital, his labor, and his 
skill</hi>.  On the other hand, they wish the workingman to come into 
the enjoyment of all the wealth of society; that is, &mdash; abridging the 
expression, &mdash; into the undivided enjoyment of his own product.  Is not 
this like saying to the workingman, &ldquo;Labor, you shall have three 
francs per day; you shall live on fifty-five sous; you shall give the rest to 
the proprietor, and thus you will consume three francs&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>If the above speech is not an exact epitome of Charles Fourier's 
system, I will subscribe to the whole phalansterian folly with a pen 
dipped in my own blood. 
</p> 
<p>Of what use is it to reform industry and agriculture, &mdash; of what 
use, indeed, to labor at all, &mdash; if property is maintained, and labor can 
never meet its expenses?  Without the abolition of property, the 
organization of labor is neither more nor less than a delusion.  If 
production should be quadrupled, &mdash; a thing which does not seem to me 
at all impossible, &mdash; it would be labor lost: if the additional product was 
not consumed, it would be of no value, and the proprietor would decline 
to receive it as interest; if it was consumed, all the disadvantages of 
property would reappear.  It must be confessed that the theory of 
passional attraction is gravely at fault in this particular, and that Fourier, 
when he tried to harmonize the <hi rend="italic">passion</hi> for property, &mdash; a 
bad passion, whatever he may say to the contrary, &mdash; blocked his own 
chariot-wheels. 
</p> 
<p>The absurdity of the phalansterian economy is so gross, that many 
people suspect Fourier, in spite of all the homage paid by him to 
proprietors, of having been a secret enemy of property.  This opinion 
might be supported by plausible  
<pb n="197"/> arguments; still it is not mine.  Charlatanism was too 
important a part for such a man to play, and sincerity too insignificant a 
one.  I would rather think Fourier ignorant (which is generally admitted) 
than disingenuous.  As for his disciples, before they can formulate any 
opinion of their own, they must declare once for all, unequivocally and 
with no mental reservation, whether they mean to maintain property or 
not, and what they mean by their famous motto, &mdash; &ldquo;To each 
according to his capital, his labor, and his skill.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>II. But, some half-converted proprietor will observe, 
&ldquo;Would it not be possible, by suppressing the bank, incomes, 
farm-rent, house-rent, usury of all kinds, and finally property itself, to 
proportion products to capacities?  That was St. Simon's idea; it was also 
Fourier's; it is the desire of the human conscience; and no decent person 
would dare maintain that a minister of state should live no better than a 
peasant.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>O Midas! your ears are long!  What! will you never understand 
that disparity of wages and the right of increase are one and the same?  
Certainly, St. Simon, Fourier, and their respective flocks committed a 
serious blunder in attempting to unite, the one, inequality and 
communism; the other, inequality and property: but you, a man of 
figures, a man of economy, &mdash; you, who know by heart your 
<hi rend="italic">logarithmic</hi> tables, &mdash; how can you make so stupid a 
mistake?  Does not political economy itself teach you that the product of 
a man, whatever be his individual capacity, is never worth more than his 
labor, and that a man's labor is worth no more than his consumption?  
You remind me of that great constitution-framer, poor Pinheiro-Ferreira, 
the Siey&egrave;s of the nineteenth century, who, dividing the citizens 
of a nation into twelve classes, &mdash; or, if you prefer, into twelve grades, &mdash; 
assigned to some a salary of one hundred thousand francs each; to 
others, eighty  
<pb n="198"/> thousand; then twenty-five thousand, fifteen thousand, 
ten thousand, &amp;c., down to one thousand five hundred, and one thousand 
francs, the minimum allowance of a citizen.  Pinheiro loved distinctions, 
and could no more conceive of a State without great dignitaries than of 
an army without drum-majors; and as he also loved, or thought he loved, 
liberty, equality, and fraternity, he combined the good and the evil of 
our old society in an eclectic philosophy which he embodied in a 
constitution.  Excellent Pinheiro!  Liberty even to passive submission, 
fraternity even to identity of language, equality even in the jury-box and 
at the guillotine, &mdash; such was his ideal republic.  Unappreciated genius, 
of whom the present century was unworthy, but whom the future will 
avenge! 
</p> 
<p>Listen, proprietor.  Inequality of talent exists in fact; in right it is 
not admissible, it goes for nothing, it is not thought of.  One Newton in 
a century is equal to thirty millions of men; the psychologist admires the 
rarity of so fine a genius, the legislator sees only the rarity of the 
function.  Now, rarity of function bestows no privilege upon the 
functionary; and that for several reasons, all equally forcible. 
</p> 
<p>1. Rarity of genius was not, in the Creator's design, a motive to 
compel society to go down on its knees before the man of superior 
talents, but a providential means for the performance of all functions to 
the greatest advantage of all. 
</p> 
<p>2. Talent is a creation of society rather than a gift of Nature; it is 
an accumulated capital, of which the receiver is only the guardian.  
Without society, &mdash; without the education and powerful assistance which 
it furnishes, &mdash; the finest nature would be inferior to the most ordinary 
capacities in the very respect in which it ought to shine.  The more 
extensive a man's knowledge, the more luxuriant his imagina 
<pb n="199"/> tion, the more versatile his talent, &mdash; the more costly has 
his education been, the more remarkable and numerous were his teachers 
and his models, and the greater is his debt.  The farmer produces from 
the time that he leaves his cradle until he enters his grave: the fruits of 
art and science are late and scarce; frequently the tree dies before the 
fruit ripens.  Society, in cultivating talent, makes a sacrifice to hope. 
</p> 
<p>3. Capacities have no common standard of comparison: the 
conditions of development being equal, inequality of talent is simply 
speciality of talent. 
</p> 
<p>4. Inequality of wages, like the right of increase, is economically 
impossible.  Take the most favorable case, &mdash; that where each laborer has 
furnished his maximum production; that there may be an equitable 
distribution of products, the share of each must be equal to the quotient 
of the total production divided by the number of laborers.  This done, 
what remains wherewith to pay the higher wages?  Nothing whatever. 
</p> 
<p>Will it be said that all laborers should be taxed?  But, then, their 
consumption will not be equal to their production, their wages will not 
pay for their productive service, they will not be able to repurchase their 
product, and we shall once more be afflicted with all the calamities of 
property.  I do not speak of the injustice done to the defrauded laborer, 
of rivalry, of excited ambition, and burning hatred, &mdash; these may all be 
important considerations, but they do not hit the point. 
</p> 
<p>On the one hand, each laborer's task being short and easy, and the 
means for its successful accomplishment being equal in all cases, how 
could there be large and small producers?  On the other hand, all 
functions being equal, either on account of the actual equivalence of 
talents and capacities, or  
 
<pb n="200"/>  
on account of social co-operation, how could a functionary claim a salary 
proportional to the worth of his genius? 
</p> 
<p>But, what do I say?  In equality wages are always proportional to 
talents.  What is the economical meaning of wages?  The reproductive 
consumption of the laborer.  The very act by which the laborer produces 
constitutes, then, this consumption, exactly equal to his production, of 
which we are speaking.  When the astronomer produces observations, 
the poet verses, or the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> experiments, they consume 
instruments, books, travels, &amp;c., &amp;c.; now, if society supplies this 
consumption, what more can the astronomer, the <hi rend="italic">savant</hi>, 
or the poet demand?  We must conclude, then, that in equality, and only 
in equality, St. Simon's adage &mdash; <hi rend="italic">To each according to his capacity 
to each capacity according to its results</hi> &mdash; finds its full and 
complete application. 
</p> 
<p>III. The great evil &mdash; the horrible and ever-present evil &mdash; arising 
from property, is that, while property exists, population, however 
reduced, is, and always must be, over-abundant.  Complaints have been 
made in all ages of the excess of population; in all ages property has 
been embarrassed by the presence of pauperism, not perceiving that it 
caused it.  Further, &mdash; nothing is more curious than the diversity of the 
plans proposed for its extermination.  Their atrocity is equalled only by 
their absurdity. 
</p> 
<p>The ancients made a practice of abandoning their children.  The 
wholesale and retail slaughter of slaves, civil and foreign wars, also lent 
their aid.  In Rome (where property held full sway), these three means 
were employed so effectively, and for so long a time, that finally the 
empire found itself without inhabitants.  When the barbarians arrived, 
nobody was to be found; the fields were no longer cultivated; grass grew 
in the streets of the Italian cities. 
 
 
<pb n="201"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>In China, from time immemorial, upon famine alone has devolved 
the task of sweeping away the poor.  The people living almost 
exclusively upon rice, if an accident causes the crop to fail, in a few 
days hunger kills the inhabitants by myriads; and the Chinese historian 
records in the annals of the empire, that in such a year of such an 
emperor twenty, thirty, fifty, one hundred thousand inhabitants died of 
starvation.  Then they bury the dead, and recommence the production of 
children until another famine leads to the same result.  Such appears to 
have been, in all ages, the Confucian economy. 
</p> 
<p>I borrow the following facts from a modern economist: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Since the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, England has 
been preyed upon by pauperism.  At that time beggars were punished by 
law.&rdquo;  Nevertheless, she had not one-fourth as large a population 
as she has to-day. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Edward prohibits alms-giving, on pain of 
imprisonment. . . .  The laws of 1547 and 1656 prescribe a like 
punishment, in case of a second offence.  Elizabeth orders that each 
parish shall support its own paupers.  But what is a pauper?  Charles II. 
decides that an <hi rend="italic">undisputed</hi> residence of forty days 
constitutes a settlement in a parish; but, if disputed, the new-comer is 
forced to pack off.  James II. modifies this decision, which is again 
modified by William.  In the midst of trials, reports, and modifications, 
pauperism increases, and the workingman languishes and dies. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The poor-tax in 1774 exceeded forty millions of francs; in 
1783-4-5, it averaged fifty-three millions; 1813, more than a hundred 
and eighty-seven millions five hundred thousand francs; 1816, two 
hundred and fifty millions; in 1817, it is estimated at three hundred and 
seventeen millions. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In 1821, the number of paupers enrolled upon the parish 
lists was estimated at four millions, nearly one-third of the population. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">France</hi>.  In 1544, Francis I. establishes a 
compulsory tax in behalf of the poor.  In 1566 and 1586, the same 
principle is applied to the whole kingdom. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Under Louis XIV., forty thousand paupers infested the 
capital [as many in proportion as to-day].  Mendicity was punished 
severely.  In 1740, the Parliament of Paris re-establishes within its own 
jurisdiction the compulsory assessment. 
 
 
<pb n="202"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Constituent Assembly, frightened at the extent of the 
evil and the difficulty of curing it, ordains the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Convention proclaims assistance of the poor to be a 
<hi rend="italic">national debt</hi>.  Its law remains unexecuted. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Napoleon also wishes to remedy the evil: his idea is 
imprisonment.  `In that way,' said he, `I shall protect the rich from the 
importunity of beggars, and shall relieve them of the disgusting sight of 
abject poverty.' &rdquo;  O wonderful man! 
 
</p> 
<p>From these facts, which I might multiply still farther, two things 
are to be inferred, &mdash; the one, that pauperism is independent of 
population; the other, that all attempts hitherto made at its extermination 
have proved abortive. 
</p> 
<p>Catholicism founds hospitals and convents, and commands charity; 
that is, she encourages mendicity.  That is the extent of her insight as 
voiced by her priests. 
</p> 
<p>The secular power of Christian nations now orders taxes on the 
rich, now banishment and imprisonment for the poor; that is, on the one 
hand, violation of the right of property, and, on the other, civil death 
and murder. 
</p> 
<p>The modern economists &mdash; thinking that pauperism is caused by the 
excess of population, exclusively &mdash; have devoted themselves to devising 
checks.  Some wish to prohibit the poor from marrying; thus, &mdash; having 
denounced religious celibacy, &mdash; they propose compulsory celibacy, 
which will inevitably become licentious celibacy. 
</p> 
<p>Others do not approve this method, which they deem too violent; 
and which, they say, deprives the poor man of <hi rend="italic">the only pleasure 
which he knows in this world</hi>.  They would simply recommend 
him to be <hi rend="italic">prudent</hi>.  This opinion is held by Malthus, 
Sismondi, Say, Droz, Duchatel, &amp;c.  But if the poor are to be 
<hi rend="italic">prudent</hi>, the rich must set the example.  Why should the 
marriageable age of the latter be fixed at eighteen years, while that of 
the former is postponed until thirty? 
 
 
<pb n="203"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Again, they would do well to explain clearly what they mean by 
this matrimonial prudence which they so urgently recommend to the 
laborer; for here equivocation is especially dangerous, and I suspect that 
the economists are not thoroughly understood.  &ldquo;Some half-enlightened ecclesiastics are alarmed when they hear prudence in 
marriage advised; they fear that the divine injunction &mdash; <hi rend="italic">increase 
and multiply</hi> &mdash; is to be set aside.  To be logical, they must 
anathematize bachelors.&rdquo;  (<hi rend="italic">J. Droz: Political 
Economy</hi>.) 
</p> 
<p>M. Droz is too honest a man, and too little of a theologian, to see 
why these casuists are so alarmed; and this chaste ignorance is the very 
best evidence of the purity of his heart.  Religion never has encouraged 
early marriages; and the kind of <hi rend="italic">prudence</hi> which it 
condemns is that described in this Latin sentence from Sanchez, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">An licet ob metum liberorum semen extra vas ejicere</hi>? 
</p> 
<p>Destutt de Tracy seems to dislike prudence in either form.  He 
says:  &ldquo;I confess that I no more share the desire of the moralists 
to diminish and restrain our pleasures, than that of the politicians to 
increase our procreative powers, and accelerate reproduction.&rdquo;  
He believes, then, that we should love and marry when and as we 
please.  Widespread misery results from love and marriage, but this our 
philosopher does not heed.  True to the dogma of the necessity of evil, 
to evil he looks for the solution of all problems.  He adds:  &ldquo;The 
multiplication of men continuing in all classes of society, the surplus 
members of the upper classes are supported by the lower classes, and 
those of the latter are destroyed by poverty.&rdquo;  This philosophy 
has few avowed partisans; but it has over every other the indisputable 
advantage of demonstration in practice.  Not long since France heard it 
advocated in the Chamber of Deputies, in the course of the discussion on 
the  
 
<pb n="204"/>  
electoral reform, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Poverty will always exist</hi>.  That is the 
political aphorism with which the minister of state ground to powder the 
arguments of M. Arago.  <hi rend="italic">Poverty will always exist</hi>!  Yes, 
so long as property does. 
</p> 
<p>The Fourierists &mdash; <hi rend="italic">inventors</hi> of so many marvellous 
contrivances &mdash; could not, in this field, belie their character.  They 
invented four methods of checking increase of population at will. 
</p> 
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">The vigor of women</hi>.  On this point they are 
contradicted by experience; for, although vigorous women may be less 
likely to conceive, nevertheless they give birth to the healthiest children; 
so that the advantage of maternity is on their side. 
</p> 
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Integral exercise</hi>, or the equal development of all 
the physical powers.  If this development is equal, how is the power of 
reproduction lessened? 
</p> 
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">The gastronomic regime;</hi> or, in plain English, the 
philosophy of the belly.  The Fourierists say, that abundance of rich food 
renders women sterile; just as too much sap &mdash; while enhancing the 
beauty of flowers &mdash; destroys their reproductive capacity.  But the 
analogy is a false one.  Flowers become sterile when the stamens &mdash; or 
male organs &mdash; are changed into petals, as may be seen by inspecting a 
rose; and when through excessive dampness the pollen loses its 
fertilizing power.  Then, &mdash; in order that the gastronomic 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> may produce the results claimed for it, &mdash; 
not only must the females be fattened, but the males must be rendered 
impotent. 
</p> 
<p>4. <hi rend="italic">Phanerogamic morality</hi>, or public concubinage.  I 
know not why the phalansterians use Greek words to convey ideas which 
can be expressed so clearly in French.  This method &mdash; like the preceding 
one &mdash; is copied from civilized customs.  Fourier, himself, cites the 
example of prostitutes as a proof.   
 
<pb n="205"/>  
Now we have no certain knowledge yet of the facts which he quotes.  So 
states Parent Duchatelet in his work on &ldquo;Prostitution.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>From all the information which I have been able to gather, I find 
that all the remedies for pauperism and fecundity &mdash;  sanctioned by 
universal practice, philosophy, political economy, and the latest 
reformers &mdash; may be summed up in the following list: masturbation, 
onanism,[1] sodomy, <hi rend="italic">tribadie</hi>, polyandry,[2] prostitution, 
castration, continence, abortion, and infanticide.[3] 
</p> 
<p>All these methods being proved inadequate, there remains 
proscription. 
</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, proscription, while decreasing the number of the 
poor, increases their proportion.  If the interest charged by the proprietor 
upon the product is equal only to one-twentieth of the product (by law it 
is equal to one-twentieth of the capital), it follows that twenty laborers 
produce for nineteen only; because there is one among them, called 
proprietor, who eats the share of two.  Suppose that the twentieth laborer 
&mdash; the poor one &mdash; is killed: the production of the following year will be 
diminished one-twentieth; consequently the nineteenth will have to yield 
his portion, and 
 
 
[1] <hi rend="italic">Hoc inter se differunt onanismus et manuspratio, nempe quod 
h&aelig;c a solitario exercetur, ille autem a duobus reciprocatur, 
masculo scilicet  et faemina.  Porro f&oelig;dam hanc onanismi venerem 
ludentes uxoria mariti habent nunc omnigm suavissimam</hi> 
 
[2] Polyandry, &mdash; plurality of husbands. 
 
[3] Infanticide has just been publicly advocated in England, in a 
pamphlet written by a disciple of Malthus.  He proposes an <hi rend="italic">annual 
massacre of the innocents</hi> in all families containing more children 
than the law allows; and he asks that a magnificent cemetery, adorned 
with statues, groves, fountains, and flowers, be set apart as a special 
burying-place for the superfluous children.  Mothers would resort to this 
delightful spot to dream of the happiness of these little angels, and would 
return, quite comforted, to give birth to others, to be buried in their 
turn. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="206"/>  
perish.  For, since it is not one-twentieth of the product of nineteen 
which must be paid to the proprietor, but one-twentieth of the product of 
twenty (see third proposition), each surviving laborer must sacrifice one-twentieth <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> one four-hundredth of his product; in other 
words, one man out of nineteen must be killed.  Therefore, while 
property exists, the more poor people we kill, the more there are born in 
proportion. 
</p> 
<p>Malthus, who proved so clearly that population increases in 
geometrical progression, while production increases only in arithmetical 
progression, did not notice this <hi rend="italic">pauperizing</hi> power of 
property.  Had he observed this, he would have understood that, before 
trying to check reproduction, the right of increase should be abolished; 
because, wherever that right is tolerated, there are always too many 
inhabitants, whatever the extent or fertility of the soil. 
</p> 
<p>It will be asked, perhaps, how I would maintain a balance between 
population and production; for sooner or later this problem must be 
solved.  The reader will pardon me, if I do not give my method here.  
For, in my opinion, it is useless to say a thing unless we prove it.  Now, 
to explain my method fully would require no less than a formal treatise.  
It is a thing so simple and so vast, so common and so extraordinary, so 
true and so misunderstood, so sacred and so profane, that to name it 
without developing and proving it would serve only to excite contempt 
and incredulity.  One thing at a time.  Let us establish equality, and this 
remedy will soon appear; for truths follow each other, just as crimes and 
errors do.

SIXTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because it is the Mother of 
Tyranny</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>What is government?  Government is public economy, the supreme 
administrative power over public works and national possessions. 
</p> 
<p>Now, the nation is like a vast society in which all the, citizens are 
stockholders.  Each one has a deliberative voice in the assembly; and, if 
the shares are equal, has one vote at his disposal.  But, under the 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> of property, there is great inequality 
between the shares of the stockholders; therefore, one may have several 
hundred votes, while another has only one.  If, for example, I enjoy an 
income of one million; that is, if I am the proprietor of a fortune of 
thirty or forty millions well invested, and if this fortune constitutes 
1/30000 of the national capital, &mdash; it is clear that the public 
administration of my property would form 1/30000 of the duties of the 
government; and, if the nation had a population of thirty-four millions, 
that I should have as many votes as one thousand one hundred and thirty-three simple stockholders. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, when M. Arago demands the right of suffrage for all 
members of the National Guard, he is perfectly right; since every citizen 
is enrolled for at least one national share, which entitles him to one vote.  
But the illustrious orator ought at the same time to demand that each 
elector shall have as many votes as he has shares; as is the case in 
commercial associations.  For to do otherwise is to pretend that the 
nation has a right to dispose of the property of individuals without 
consulting them; which is contrary to the right of property.  In a country 
where property exists, equality of electoral rights is a violation of 
property. 
 
 
<pb n="208"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Now, if each citizen's sovereignty must and ought to be 
proportional to his property, it follows that the small stock holders are at 
the mercy of the larger ones; who will, as soon as they choose, make 
slaves of the former, marry them at pleasure, take from them their 
wives, castrate their sons, prostitute their daughters, throw the aged to 
the sharks, &mdash; and finally will be forced to serve themselves in the same 
way, unless they prefer to tax themselves for the support of their 
servants.  In such a condition is Great Britain to-day.  John Bull &mdash; 
caring little for liberty, equality, or dignity &mdash; prefers to serve and beg.  
But you, <hi rend="italic">bonhomme Jacques</hi>? 
</p> 
<p>Property is incompatible with political and civil equality; then 
property is impossible. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Historical Comments</hi>. &mdash; 1. When the vote of the 
third estate was doubled by the States-General of 1789, property was 
grossly violated.  The nobility and the clergy possessed three-fourths of 
the soil of France; they should have controlled three-fourths of the votes 
in the national representation.  To double the vote of the third estate was 
just, it is said, since the people paid nearly all the taxes.  This argument 
would be sound, if there were nothing to be voted upon but taxes.  But it 
was a question at that time of reforming the government and the 
constitution; consequently, the doubling of the vote of the third estate 
was a usurpation, and an attack on property. 
</p> 
<p>2. If the present representatives of the radical opposition should 
come into power, they would work a reform by which every National 
Guard should be an elector, and every elector eligible for office, &mdash; an 
attack on property. 
</p> 
<p>They would lower the rate of interest on public funds, &mdash; an attack 
on property. 
</p> 
<p>They would, in the interest of the public, pass laws to regu 
 
<pb n="209"/>  
late the exportation of cattle and wheat, &mdash; an attack on property. 
</p> 
<p>They would alter the assessment of taxes, &mdash; an attack on property. 
</p> 
<p>They would educate the people gratuitously, &mdash; a conspiracy against 
property. 
</p> 
<p>They would organize labor; that is, they would guarantee labor to 
the workingman, and give him a share in the profits, &mdash; the abolition of 
property. 
</p> 
<p>Now, these same radicals are zealous defenders of property, &mdash; a 
radical proof that they know not what they do, nor what they wish. 
</p> 
<p>3. Since property is the grand cause of privilege and despotism, 
the form of the republican oath should be changed.  Instead of, &ldquo;I 
swear hatred to royalty,&rdquo; henceforth the new member of a secret 
society should say, &ldquo;I swear hatred to property.&rdquo; 
 
 
SEVENTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because, in consuming its Receipts, it 
loses them; in hoarding them, it nullifies them; and in 
using them as Capital, it turns them against Production</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>I. If, with the economists, we consider the laborer as a living 
machine, we must regard the wages paid to him as the amount necessary 
to support this machine, and keep it in repair.  The head of a 
manufacturing establishment &mdash; who employs laborers at three, five, ten, 
and fifteen francs per day, and who charges twenty francs for his 
superintendence &mdash; does not regard his disbursements as losses, because 
he knows they will return to him in the form of products.  Consequently, 
<hi rend="italic">labor</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reproductive consumption</hi> are 
identical. 
</p> 
<p>What is the proprietor?  He is a machine which does not  
 
<pb n="210"/>  
work; or, which working for its own pleasure, and only when it sees fit, 
produces nothing. 
</p> 
<p>What is it to consume as a proprietor?  It is to consume without 
working, to consume without reproducing.  For, once more, that which 
the proprietor consumes as a laborer comes back to him; he does not 
give his labor in exchange for his property, since, if he did, he would 
thereby cease to be a proprietor.  In consuming as a laborer, the 
proprietor gains, or at least does not lose, since he recovers that which 
he consumes; in consuming as a proprietor, he impoverishes himself.  
To enjoy property, then, it is necessary to destroy it; to be a real 
proprietor, one must cease to be a proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>The laborer who consumes his wages is a machine which destroys 
and reproduces; the proprietor who consumes his income is a bottomless 
gulf, &mdash; sand which we water, a stone which we sow.  So true is this, 
that the proprietor &mdash; neither wishing nor knowing how to produce, and 
perceiving that as fast as he uses his property he destroys it for ever &mdash; 
has taken the precaution to make some one produce in his place.  That is 
what political economy, speaking in the name of eternal justice, calls 
<hi rend="italic">producing by his capital, &mdash; producing by his tools</hi>.  And 
that is what ought to be called <hi rend="italic">producing by a slave &mdash; producing 
as a thief and as a tyrant</hi>.  He, the proprietor, produce! . . .  The 
robber might say, as well:  &ldquo;I produce.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The consumption of the proprietor has been styled luxury, in 
opposition to <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> consumption.  From what has just 
been said, we see that great luxury can prevail in a nation which is not 
rich, &mdash; that poverty even increases with luxury, and <hi rend="italic">vice 
vers&acirc;</hi>.  The economists (so much credit must be given 
them, at least) have caused such a horror of luxury, that to-day a very 
large number of proprietors &mdash; not to say almost  
 
<pb n="211"/>  
all &mdash; ashamed of their idleness &mdash; labor, economize, and capitalize.  
They have jumped from the frying-pan into the fire. 
</p> 
<p>I cannot repeat it too often: the proprietor who thinks to deserve 
his income by working, and who receives wages for his labor, is a 
functionary who gets paid twice; that is the only difference between an 
idle proprietor and a laboring proprietor.  By his labor, the proprietor 
produces his wages only &mdash; not his income.  And since his condition 
enables him to engage in the most lucrative pursuits, it may be said that 
the proprietor's labor harms society more than it helps it.  Whatever the 
proprietor does, the consumption of his income is an actual loss, which 
his salaried functions neither repair nor justify; and which would 
annihilate property, were it not continually replenished by outside 
production. 
</p> 
<p>II. Then, the proprietor who consumes annihilates the product: he 
does much worse if he lays it up.  The things which he lays by pass into 
another world; nothing more is seen of them, not even the <hi rend="italic">caput 
mortuum</hi>, &mdash; the smoke.  If we had some means of transportation 
by which to travel to the moon, and if the proprietors should be seized 
with a sudden fancy to carry their savings thither, at the end of a certain 
time our terraqueous planet would be transported by them to its satellite! 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor who lays up products will neither allow others to 
enjoy them, nor enjoy them himself; for him there is neither possession 
nor property.  Like the miser, he broods over his treasures: he does not 
use them.  He may feast his eyes upon them; he may lie down with 
them; he may sleep with them in his arms: all very fine, but coins do not 
breed coins.  No real property without enjoyment; no enjoyment without 
consumption; no consumption without loss of property, &mdash; such is the 
inflexible necessity to which  
 
<pb n="212"/>  
God's judgment compels the proprietor to bend.  A curse upon property 
! 
</p> 
<p>III. The proprietor who, instead of consuming his income, uses it 
as capital, turns it against production, and thereby makes it impossible 
for him to exercise his right.  For the more he increases the amount of 
interest to be paid upon it, the more he is compelled to diminish wages.  
Now, the more he diminishes wages, &mdash; that is, the less he devotes to the 
maintenance and repair of the machines, &mdash; the more he diminishes the 
quantity of labor; and with the quantity of labor the quantity of product, 
and with the quantity of product the very source of his income.  This is 
clearly shown by the following example: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Take an estate consisting of arable land, meadows, and vineyards, 
containing the dwellings of the owner and the tenant; and worth, together 
with the farming implements, one hundred thousand francs, the rate of 
increase being three per cent.  If, instead of consuming his revenue, the 
proprietor uses it, not in enlarging but in beautifying his estate, can he 
annually demand of his tenant an additional ninety francs on account of 
the three thousand francs which he has thus added to his capital?  
Certainly not; for on such conditions the tenant, though producing no 
more than before, would soon be obliged to labor for nothing, &mdash; what do 
I say? to actually suffer loss in order to hold his lease. 
</p> 
<p>In fact, revenue can increase only as productive soil increases: it is 
useless to build walls of marble, and work with plows of gold.  But, 
since it is impossible to go on acquiring for ever, to add estate to estate, 
to <hi rend="italic">continue one's possessions</hi>, as the Latins said; and 
since, moreover, the proprietor always has means wherewith to 
capitalize, &mdash; it follows that the exercise of his right finally becomes 
impossible. 
 
 
<pb n="213"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Well, in spite of this impossibility, property capitalizes, and in 
capitalizing increases its revenue; and, without stopping to look at the 
particular cases which occur in commerce, manufacturing operations, 
and banking, I will cite a graver fact, &mdash;  one which directly affects all 
citizens.  I mean the indefinite increase of the budget. 
</p> 
<p>The taxes increase every year.  It would be difficult to tell in 
which department of the government the expenses increase; for who can 
boast of any knowledge as to the budget?  On this point, the ablest 
financiers continually disagree.  What is to be thought, I ask, of the 
science of government, when its professors cannot understand one 
another's figures?  Whatever be the immediate causes of this growth of 
the budget, it is certain that taxation increases at a rate which causes 
everybody to despair.  Everybody sees it, everybody acknowledges it; 
but nobody seems to understand the primary cause.[1]  Now, I say that it 
cannot be otherwise, &mdash; that it is necessary and inevitable. 
</p> 
<p>A nation is the tenant of a rich proprietor called the 
<hi rend="italic">government</hi>, to whom it pays, for the use of the soil, a 
farm-rent called a tax.  Whenever the government makes war, loses or 
gains a battle, changes the outfit of its army, erects a monu- 
 
[1]  &ldquo;The financial situation of the English government was 
shown up in the House of Lords during the session of January 23.  It is 
not an encouraging one.  For several years the expenses have exceeded 
the receipts, and the Minister has been able to re-establish the balance 
only by loans renewed annually.  The combined deficits of the years 
1838 and 1839 amount to forty-seven million five hundred thousand 
francs.  In 1840, the excess of expenses over receipts is expected to be 
twenty-two million five hundred thousand francs.  Attention was called 
to these figures by Lord Ripon.  Lord Melbourne replied:  `The noble 
earl unhappily was right in declaring that the public expenses continually 
increase, and with him I must say that there is no room for hope that 
they can be diminished or met in any way.' &rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">National:  
January</hi> 26, 1840. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="214"/>  
ment, digs a canal, opens a road, or builds a railway, it borrows money, 
on which the tax-payers pay interest; that is, the government, without 
adding to its productive capacity, increases its active capital, &mdash; in a 
word, capitalizes after the manner of the proprietor of whom I have just 
spoken. 
</p> 
<p>Now, when a governmental loan is once contracted, and the 
interest is once stipulated, the budget cannot be reduced.  For, to 
accomplish that, either the capitalists must relinquish their interest, 
which would involve an abandonment of property; or the government 
must go into bankruptcy, which would be a fraudulent denial of the 
political principle; or it must pay the debt, which would require another 
loan; or it must reduce expenses, which is impossible, since the loan was 
contracted for the sole reason that the ordinary receipts were insufficient; 
or the money expended by the government must be reproductive, which 
requires an increase of productive capacity, &mdash; a condition excluded by 
our hypothesis; or, finally, the tax-payers must submit to a new tax in 
order to pay the debt, &mdash; an impossible thing.  For, if this new tax were 
levied upon all citizens alike, half, or even more, of the citizens would 
be unable to pay it; if the rich had to bear the whole, it would be a 
forced contribution, &mdash; an invasion of property.  Long financial 
experience has shown that the method of loans, though exceedingly 
dangerous, is much surer, more convenient, and less costly than any 
other method; consequently the government borrows, &mdash; that is, goes on 
capitalizing, &mdash; and increases the budget. 
</p> 
<p>Then, a budget, instead of ever diminishing, must necessarily and 
continually increase.  It is astonishing that the economists, with all their 
learning, have failed to perceive a fact so simple and so evident.  If they 
have perceived it, why have they neglected to condemn it? 
 
 
<pb n="215"/>  
 
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Historical Comment</hi>. &mdash; Much interest is felt at 
present in a financial operation which is expected to result in a reduction 
of the budget.  It is proposed to change the present rate of increase, five 
per cent.  Laying aside the politico-legal question to deal only with the 
financial question, &mdash; is it not true that, when five per cent. is changed to 
four per cent., it will then be necessary, for the same reasons, to change 
four to three; then three to two, then two to one, and finally to sweep 
away increase altogether?  But that would be the advent of equality of 
conditions and the abolition of property.  Now it seems to me, that an 
intelligent nation should voluntarily meet an inevitable revolution half 
way, instead of suffering itself to be dragged after the car of inflexible 
necessity. 
 
 
EIGHTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because its power of Accumulation is 
infinite, and is exercised only over finite quantities. 
</hi> 
</p> 
<p>If men, living in equality, should grant to one of their number the 
exclusive right of property; and this sole proprietor should lend one 
hundred francs to the human race at compound interest, payable to his 
descendants twenty-four generations hence, &mdash; at the end of six hundred 
years this sum of one hundred francs, at five per cent., would amount to 
107,854,010,777,600 francs; two thousand six hundred and ninety-six 
and one-third times the capital of France (supposing her capital to be 
40,000,000,000), or more than twenty times the value of the terrestrial 
globe! 
</p> 
<p>Suppose that a man, in the reign of St. Louis, had borrowed one 
hundred francs, and had refused, &mdash; he and his heirs after him, &mdash; to 
return it.  Even though it were known that the said heirs were not the 
rightful possessors, and that prescription  
 
<pb n="216"/>  
had been interrupted always at the right moment, &mdash; nevertheless, by our 
laws, the last heir would be obliged to return the one hundred francs 
with interest, and interest on the interest; which in all would amount, as 
we have seen, to nearly one hundred and eight thousand billions. 
</p> 
<p>Every day, fortunes are growing in our midst much more rapidly 
than this.  The preceding example supposed the interest equal to one-twentieth of the capital, &mdash; it often equals one-tenth, one-fifth, one-half of 
the capital; and sometimes the capital itself. 
</p> 
<p>The Fourierists &mdash; irreconcilable enemies of equality, whose 
partisans they regard as <hi rend="italic">sharks</hi> &mdash; intend, by quadrupling 
production, to satisfy all the demands of capital, labor, and skill.  But, 
should production be multiplied by four, ten, or even one hundred, 
property would soon absorb, by its power of accumulation and the 
effects of its capitalization, both products and capital, and the land, and 
even the laborers.  Is the phalanstery to be prohibited from capitalizing 
and lending at interest?  Let it explain, then, what it means by property. 
</p> 
<p>I will carry these calculations no farther.  They are capable of 
infinite variation, upon which it would be puerile for me to insist.  I only 
ask by what standard judges, called upon to decide a suit for possession, 
fix the interest?  And, developing the question, I ask, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Did the legislator, in introducing into the Republic the principle of 
property, weigh all the consequences?  Did he know the law of the 
possible?  If he knew it, why is it not in the Code?  Why is so much 
latitude allowed to the proprietor in accumulating property and charging 
interest, &mdash; to the judge in recognizing and fixing the domain of property, 
&mdash; to the State in its power to levy new taxes continually?  At what point 
is the nation justified in repudiating the budget,  
 
<pb n="217"/>  
the tenant his farm-rent, and the manufacturer the interest on his capital?  
How far may the idler take advantage of the laborer?  Where does the 
right of spoliation begin, and where does it end?  When may the 
producer say to the proprietor, &ldquo;I owe you nothing 
more&rdquo;?  When is property satisfied?  When must it cease to steal? 
</p> 
<p>If the legislator did know the law of the possible, and disregarded 
it, what must be thought of his justice?  If he did not know it, what must 
be thought of his wisdom?  Either wicked or foolish, how can we 
recognize his authority? 
</p> 
<p>If our charters and our codes are based upon an absurd hypothesis, 
what is taught in the law-schools?  What does a judgment of the Court of 
Appeal amount to?  About what do our Chambers deliberate?  What is 
<hi rend="italic">politics</hi>?  What is our definition of a 
<hi rend="italic">statesman</hi>?  What is the meaning of 
<hi rend="italic">jurisprudence</hi>?  Should we not rather say 
<hi rend="italic">jurisignorance</hi>? 
</p> 
<p>If all our institutions are based upon an error in calculation, does it 
not follow that these institutions are so many shams?  And if the entire 
social structure is built upon this absolute impossibility of property, is it 
not true that the government under which we live is a chimera, and our 
present society a utopia? 
 
 
NINTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because it is powerless against 
Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>I. By the third corollary of our axiom, interest tells against the 
proprietor as well as the stranger.  This economical principle is 
universally admitted.  Nothing simpler at first blush; yet, nothing more 
absurd, more contradictory in terms, or more absolutely impossible. 
</p> 
<p>The manufacturer, it is said, pays himself the rent on his house 
and capital.  <hi rend="italic">He pays himself;</hi> that is, he gets paid by  
 
<pb n="218"/>  
the public who buy his products.  For, suppose the manufacturer, who 
seems to make this profit on his property, wishes also to make it on his 
merchandise, can he then pay himself one franc for that which cost him 
ninety centimes, and make money by the operation?  No: such a 
transaction would transfer the merchant's money from his right hand to 
his left, but without any profit whatever. 
</p> 
<p>Now, that which is true of a single individual trading with himself 
is true also of the whole business world.  Form a chain of ten, fifteen, 
twenty producers; as many as you wish.  If the producer A makes a 
profit out of the producer B.  B's loss must, according to economical 
principles, be made up by C, C's by D; and so on through to Z. 
</p> 
<p>But by whom will Z be paid for the loss caused him by the profit 
charged by A in the beginning?  <hi rend="italic">By the consumer</hi>, replies 
Say.  Contemptible equivocation!  Is this consumer any other, then, than 
A, B.  C, D, &amp;c., or Z?  By whom will Z be paid?  If he is paid by A, 
no one makes a profit; consequently, there is no property.  If, on the 
contrary, Z bears the burden himself, he ceases to be a member of 
society; since it refuses him the right of property and profit, which it 
grants to the other associates. 
</p> 
<p>Since, then, a nation, like universal humanity, is a vast industrial 
association which cannot act outside of itself, it is clear that no man can 
enrich himself without impoverishing another.  For, in order that the 
right of property, the right of increase, may be respected in the case of 
A, it must be denied to Z; thus we see how equality of rights, separated 
from equality of conditions, may be a truth.  The iniquity of political 
economy in this respect is flagrant.  &ldquo;When I, a manufacturer, 
purchase the labor of a workingman, I do not include his wages in the 
net product of my business; on the  
 
<pb n="219"/>  
contrary, I deduct them.  But the workingman includes them in his net 
product. . . .  &ldquo;(<hi rend="italic">Say:  Political Economy</hi>.) 
</p> 
<p>That means that all which the workingman gains is <hi rend="italic">net 
product;</hi> but that only that part of the manufacturer's gains is 
<hi rend="italic">net product</hi>, which remains after deducting his wages.  But 
why is the right of profit confined to the manufacturer?  Why is this 
right, which is at bottom the right of property itself, denied to the 
workingman?  In the terms of economical science, the workingman is 
capital.  Now, all capital, beyond the cost of its maintenance and repair, 
must bear interest.  This the proprietor takes care to get, both for his 
capital and for himself.  Why is the workingman prohibited from 
charging a like interest for his capital, which is himself? 
</p> 
<p>Property, then, is inequality of rights; for, if it were not inequality 
of rights, it would be equality of goods, &mdash; in other words, it would not 
exist.  Now, the charter guarantees to all equality of rights.  Then, by 
the charter, property is impossible. 
</p> 
<p>II. Is A, the proprietor of an estate, entitled by the fact of his 
proprietorship to take possession of the field belonging to B. his 
neighbor?  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; reply the proprietors; &ldquo;but what 
has that to do with the right of property?&rdquo;  That I shall show you 
by a series of similar propositions. 
</p> 
<p>Has C, a hatter, the right to force D, his neighbor and also a 
hatter, to close his shop, and cease his business?  Not the least in the 
world. 
</p> 
<p>But C wishes to make a profit of one franc on every hat, while D 
is content with fifty centimes.  It is evident that D's moderation is 
injurious to C's extravagant claims.  Has the latter a right to prevent D 
from selling?  Certainly not. 
</p> 
<p>Since D is at liberty to sell his hats fifty centimes cheaper  
 
<pb n="220"/>  
than C if he chooses, C in his turn is free to reduce his price one franc.  
Now, D is poor, while C is rich; so that at the end of two or three years 
D is ruined by this intolerable competition, and C has complete control 
of the market.  Can the proprietor D get any redress from the proprietor 
C?  Can he bring a suit against him to recover his business and 
property?  No; for D could have done the same thing, had he been the 
richer of the two. 
</p> 
<p>On the same ground, the large proprietor A may say to the small 
proprietor B:  &ldquo;Sell me your field, otherwise you shall not sell 
your wheat,&rdquo; &mdash; and that without doing him the least wrong, or 
giving him ground for complaint.  So that A can devour B if he likes, 
for the very reason that A is stronger than B.  Consequently, it is not the 
right of property which enables A and C to rob B and D, but the right of 
might.  By the right of property, neither the two neighbors A and B, nor 
the two merchants C and D, could harm each other.  They could neither 
dispossess nor destroy one another, nor gain at one another's expense.  
The power of invasion lies in superior strength. 
</p> 
<p>But it is superior strength also which enables the manufacturer to 
reduce the wages of his employees, and the rich merchant and well-stocked proprietor to sell their products for what they please.  The 
manufacturer says to the laborer, &ldquo;You are as free to go 
elsewhere with your services as I am to receive them.  I offer you so 
much.&rdquo;  The merchant says to the customer, &ldquo;Take it or 
leave it; you are master of your money, as I am of my goods.  I want so 
much.&rdquo; Who will yield?  The weaker. 
</p> 
<p>Therefore, without force, property is powerless against property, 
since without force it has no power to increase; therefore, without force, 
property is null and void.

<p><hi rend="italic">Historical Comment</hi>. &mdash; The struggle between 
colonial and native sugars furnishes us a striking example of this 
impossibility of property.  Leave these two industries to themselves, and 
the native manufacturer will be ruined by the colonist.  To maintain the 
beet-root, the cane must be taxed: to protect the property of the one, it is 
necessary to injure the property of the other.  The most remarkable 
feature of this business is precisely that to which the least attention is 
paid; namely, that, in one way or another, property has to be violated.  
Impose on each industry a proportional tax, so as to preserve a balance 
in the market, and you create a <hi rend="italic">maximum price</hi>, &mdash; you 
attack property in two ways.  On the one hand, your tax interferes with 
the liberty of trade; on the other, it does not recognize equality of 
proprietors.  Indemnify the beet-root, you violate the property of the tax-payer.  Cultivate the two varieties of sugar at the nation's expense, just 
as different varieties of tobacco are cultivated, &mdash; you abolish one species 
of property.  This last course would be the simpler and better one; but, 
to induce the nations to adopt it, requires such a co-operation of able 
minds and generous hearts as is at present out of the question. 
</p> 
<p>Competition, sometimes called liberty of trade, &mdash; in a word, 
property in exchange, &mdash; will be for a long time the basis of our 
commercial legislation; which, from the economical point of view, 
embraces all civil laws and all government.  Now, what is competition?  
A duel in a closed field, where arms are the test of right. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Who is the liar, &mdash; the accused or the accuser?&rdquo; 
said our barbarous ancestors.  &ldquo;Let them fight it out,&rdquo; 
replied the still more barbarous judge; &ldquo;the stronger is 
right.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Which of us two shall sell spices to our neighbor?  &ldquo;Let 
each offer them for sale,&rdquo; cries the economist; &ldquo;the  
 
<pb n="222"/>  
sharper, or the more cunning, is the more honest man, and the better 
merchant.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Such is the exact spirit of the Code Napoleon. 
 
 
TENTH PROPOSITION. 
 
<hi rend="italic">Property is impossible, because it is the Negation of 
equality</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The development of this proposition will be the 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</hi> of the preceding ones. 
</p> 
<p>1. It is a principle of economical justice, that <hi rend="italic">products are 
bought only by products</hi>.  Property, being capable of defence 
only on the ground that it produces utility, is, since it produces nothing, 
for ever condemned. 
</p> 
<p>2. It is an economical law, that <hi rend="italic">labor must be balanced by 
product</hi>.  It is a fact that, with property, production costs more 
than it is worth. 
</p> 
<p>3. Another economical law:  <hi rend="italic">The capital being given, 
production is measured, not by the amount of capital, but by productive 
capacity</hi>.  Property, requiring income to be always proportional 
to capital without regard to labor, does not recognize this relation of 
equality between effect and cause. 
</p> 
<p>4 and 5. Like the insect which spins its silk, the laborer never 
produces for himself alone.  Property, demanding a double product and 
unable to obtain it, robs the laborer, and kills him. 
</p> 
<p>6. Nature has given to every man but one mind, one heart, one 
will.  Property, granting to one individual a plurality of votes, supposes 
him to have a plurality of minds. 
</p> 
<p>7. All consumption which is not reproductive of utility is 
destruction.  Property, whether it consumes or hoards or capitalizes, is 
productive of <hi rend="italic">inutility</hi>, &mdash; the cause of sterility and death. 
 
 
<pb n="223"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>8. The satisfaction of a natural right always gives rise to an 
equation; in other words, the right to a thing is necessarily balanced by 
the possession of the thing.  Thus, between the right to liberty and the 
condition of a free man there is a balance, an equation; between the right 
to be a father and paternity, an equation; between the right to security 
and the social guarantee, an equation.  But between the right of increase 
and the receipt of this increase there is never an equation; for every new 
increase carries with it the right to another, the latter to a third, and so 
on for ever.  Property, never being able to accomplish its object, is a 
right against Nature and against reason. 
</p> 
<p>9. Finally, property is not self-existent.  An extraneous cause &mdash; 
either <hi rend="italic">force</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fraud</hi> &mdash; is necessary to its life 
and action.  In other words, property is not equal to property: it is a 
negation &mdash; a delusion &mdash; NOTHING.</p>

PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPOSITION OF THE IDEA OF JUSTICE AND 
INJUSTICE, AND A DETERMINATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF 
GOVERNMENT AND OF RIGHT. 
</head> 
<p>Property is impossible; equality does not exist.  We hate the 
former, and yet wish to possess it; the latter rules all our thoughts, yet 
we know not how to reach it.  Who will explain this profound 
antagonism between our conscience and our will?  Who will point out 
the causes of this pernicious error, which has become the most sacred 
principle of justice and society? 
</p> 
<p>I am bold enough to undertake the task, and I hope to succeed. 
</p> 
<p>But before explaining why man has violated justice, it is necessary 
to determine what justice is. 
 
 
PART FIRST. 
 
&sect; 1. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Of the Moral Sense in Man and the Animals</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The philosophers have endeavored often to locate the line which 
separates man's intelligence from that of the brutes; and, according to 
their general custom, they gave utterance to much foolishness before 
resolving upon the only course possible for them to take, &mdash; observation.  
It was reserved  
 
<pb n="225"/>  
for an unpretending <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> &mdash; who perhaps did not pride 
himself on his philosophy &mdash; to put an end to the interminable 
controversy by a simple distinction; but one of those luminous 
distinctions which are worth more than systems.  Frederic Cuvier 
separated <hi rend="italic">instinct</hi> from <hi rend="italic">intelligence</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>But, as yet, no one has proposed this question: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Is the difference between man's moral sense and that of the 
brute a difference in kind or only in degree</hi>? 
</p> 
<p>If, hitherto, any one had dared to maintain the latter alternative, 
his arguments would have seemed scandalous, blasphemous, and 
offensive to morality and religion.  The ecclesiastical and secular 
tribunals would have condemned him with one voice.  And, mark the 
style in which they would have branded the immoral paradox!  
&ldquo;Conscience,&rdquo; &mdash; they would have cried, &mdash; 
&ldquo;conscience, man's chief glory, was given to him exclusively; the 
notion of justice and injustice, of merit and demerit, is his noble 
privilege; to man, alone, &mdash; the lord of creation, &mdash; belongs the sublime 
power to resist his worldly propensities, to choose between good and 
evil, and to bring himself more and more into the resemblance of God 
through liberty and justice. . . .  No; the holy image of virtue was never 
graven save on the heart of man.&rdquo;  Words full of feeling, but 
void of sense. 
</p> 
<p>Man is a rational and social animal &mdash; <foreign lang="grk"> 
zwon logikon kai politikon</foreign> &mdash; said Aristotle.  This definition 
is worth more than all which have been given since.  I do not except 
even M. de Bonald's celebrated definition, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">man is an intellect 
served by organs</hi> &mdash; a definition which has the double fault of 
explaining the known by the unknown; that is, the living being by the 
intellect; and of neglecting man's essential quality, &mdash; animality. 
</p> 
<p>Man, then, is an animal living in society.  Society means  
 
<pb n="226"/>  
the sum total of relationships; in short, system.  Now, all systems exist 
only on certain conditions.  What, then, are the conditions, the 
<hi rend="italic">laws</hi>, of human society? 
</p> 
<p>What are the <hi rend="italic">rights</hi> of men with respect to each 
other; what is <hi rend="italic">justice</hi>? 
</p> 
<p>It amounts to nothing to say, &mdash; with the philosophers of various 
schools, &mdash; &ldquo;It is a divine instinct, an immortal and heavenly 
voice, a guide given us by Nature, a light revealed unto every man on 
coming into the world, a law engraved upon our hearts; it is the voice of 
conscience, the <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi> of reason, the inspiration of 
sentiment, the <hi rend="italic">penchant</hi> of feeling; it is the love of self in 
others; it is enlightened self-interest; or else it is an innate idea, the 
imperative command of applied reason, which has its source in the 
concepts of pure reason; it is a passional attraction,&rdquo; &amp;c., &amp;c.  
This may be as true as it seems beautiful; but it is utterly meaningless.  
Though we should prolong this litany through ten pages (it has been 
filtered through a thousand volumes), we should be no nearer to the 
solution of the question. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Justice is public utility,&rdquo; says Aristotle.  That is 
true, but it is a tautology.  &ldquo;The principle that the public welfare 
ought to be the object of the legislator&rdquo; &mdash; says M. Ch. Comte in 
his &ldquo;Treatise on Legislation&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;cannot be 
overthrown.  But legislation is advanced no farther by its announcement 
and demonstration, than is medicine when it is said that it is the business 
of physicians to cure the sick.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Let us take another course.  <hi rend="italic">Right</hi> is the sum total of 
the principles which govern society.  Justice, in man, is the respect and 
observation of those principles.  To practise justice is to obey the social 
instinct; to do an act of justice is to do a social act.  If, then, we watch 
the conduct of men towards each other under different circumstances, it 
will be easy for  
 
<pb n="227"/>  
us to distinguish between the presence and absence of society; from the 
result we may inductively infer the law. 
</p> 
<p>Let us commence with the simplest and least doubtful cases. 
</p> 
<p>The mother, who protects her son at the peril of her life, and 
sacrifices every thing to his support, is in society with him &mdash; she is a 
good mother.  She, on the contrary, who abandons her child, is 
unfaithful to the social instinct, &mdash; maternal love being one of its many 
features; she is an unnatural mother. 
</p> 
<p>If I plunge into the water to rescue a drowning man, I am his 
brother, his associate; if, instead of aiding him, I sink him, I am his 
enemy, his murderer. 
</p> 
<p>Whoever bestows alms treats the poor man as his associate; not 
thoroughly, it is true, but only in respect to the amount which he shares 
with him.  Whoever takes by force or stratagem that which is not the 
product of his labor, destroys his social character &mdash; he is a brigand. 
</p> 
<p>The Samaritan who relieves the traveller lying by the wayside, 
dresses his wounds, comforts him, and supplies him with money, thereby 
declares himself his associate &mdash; his neighbor; the priest, who passes by 
on the other side, remains unassociated, and is his enemy. 
</p> 
<p>In all these cases, man is moved by an internal attraction towards 
his fellow, by a secret sympathy which causes him to love, congratulate, 
and condole; so that, to resist this attraction, his will must struggle 
against his nature. 
</p> 
<p>But in these respects there is no decided difference between man 
and the animals.  With them, as long as the weakness of their young 
endears them to their mothers, &mdash; in a word, associates them with their 
mothers, &mdash; the latter protect the former, at the peril of their lives, with a 
courage which  
 
<pb n="228"/>  
reminds us of our heroes dying for their country.  Certain species unite 
for hunting purposes, seek each other, call each other (a poet would say 
invite each other), to share their prey; in danger they aid, protect, and 
warn each other.  The elephant knows how to help his companion out of 
the ditch into which the latter has fallen.  Cows form a circle, with their 
horns outward and their calves in the centre, in order to repel the attacks 
of wolves.  Horses and pigs, on hearing a cry of distress from one of 
their number, rush to the spot whence it comes.  What descriptions I 
might give of their marriages, the tenderness of the males towards the 
females, and the fidelity of their loves!  Let us add, however, &mdash; to be 
entirely just &mdash; that these touching demonstrations of society, fraternity, 
and love of neighbor, do not prevent the animals from quarrelling, 
fighting, and outrageously abusing one another while gaining their 
livelihood and showing their gallantry; the resemblance between them 
and ourselves is perfect. 
</p> 
<p>The social instinct, in man and beast, exists to a greater or less 
degree &mdash; its nature is the same.  Man has the greater need of 
association, and employs it more; the animal seems better able to endure 
isolation.  In man, social needs are more imperative and complex; in the 
beast, they seem less intense, less diversified, less regretted.  Society, in 
a word, aims, in the case of man, at the preservation of the race and the 
individual; with the animals, its object is more exclusively the 
preservation of the race. 
</p> 
<p>As yet, we have met with no claim which man can make for 
himself alone.  The social instinct and the moral sense he shares with the 
brutes; and when he thinks to become god-like by a few acts of charity, 
justice, and devotion, he does not perceive that in so acting he simply 
obeys an instinct wholly animal in its nature.  As we are good, loving, 
tender,  
 
<pb n="229"/>  
just, so we are passionate, greedy, lewd, and vindictive; that is, we are 
like the beasts.  Our highest virtues appear, in the last analysis, as blind, 
impulsive instincts.  What subjects for canonization and apotheosis! 
</p> 
<p>There is, however, a difference between us two-handed bipeds and 
other living creatures &mdash; what is it? 
</p> 
<p>A student of philosophy would hasten to reply:  &ldquo;This 
difference lies in the fact that we are conscious of our social faculty, 
while the animals are unconscious of theirs &mdash; in the fact that while we 
reflect and reason upon the operation of our social instinct, the animals 
do nothing of the kind.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I will go farther.  It is by our reflective and reasoning powers, 
with which we seem to be exclusively endowed, that we know that it is 
injurious, first to others and then to ourselves, to resist the social instinct 
which governs us, and which we call <hi rend="italic">justice</hi>.  It is our 
reason which teaches us that the selfish man, the robber, the murderer &mdash; 
in a word, the traitor to society &mdash; sins against Nature, and is guilty with 
respect to others and himself, when he does wrong wilfully.  Finally, it 
is our social sentiment on the one hand, and our reason on the other, 
which cause us to think that beings such as we should take the 
responsibility of their acts.  Such is the principle of remorse, revenge, 
and penal justice. 
</p> 
<p>But this proves only an intellectual diversity between the animals 
and man, not at all an affectional one; for, although we reason upon our 
relations with our fellows, we likewise reason upon our most trivial 
actions, &mdash; such as drinking, eating, choosing a wife, or selecting a 
dwelling-place.  We reason upon things earthly and things heavenly; 
there is nothing to which our reasoning powers are not applicable.  Now, 
just as the knowledge of external phenomena, which we acquire, has no 
influence upon their causes and laws, so reflection, by  
 
<pb n="230"/>  
illuminating our instinct, enlightens us as to our sentient nature, but does 
not alter its character; it tells us what our morality is, but neither 
changes nor modifies it.  Our dissatisfaction with ourselves after doing 
wrong, the indignation which we feel at the sight of injustice, the idea of 
deserved punishment and due remuneration, are effects of reflection, and 
not immediate effects of instinct and emotion.  Our appreciation (I do not 
say exclusive appreciation, for the animals also realize that they have 
done wrong, and are indignant when one of their number is attacked, 
but), our infinitely superior appreciation of our social duties, our 
knowledge of good and evil, does not establish, as regards morality, any 
vital difference between man and the beasts. 
 
 
&sect; 2. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Of the first and second degrees of Sociability</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>I insist upon the fact, which I have just pointed out, as one of the 
most important facts of anthropology. 
</p> 
<p>The sympathetic attraction, which causes us to associate, is, by 
reason of its blind, unruly nature, always governed by temporary 
impulse, without regard to higher rights, and without distinction of merit 
or priority.  The bastard dog follows indifferently all who call it; the 
suckling child regards every man as its father and every woman as its 
nurse; every living creature, when deprived of the society of animals of 
its species, seeks companionship in its solitude.  This fundamental 
characteristic of the social instinct renders intolerable and even hateful 
the friendship of frivolous persons, liable to be infatuated with every new 
face, accommodating to all whether good or bad, and ready to sacrifice, 
for a passing <hi rend="italic">liaison</hi>, the oldest and most honorable 
affections.  The fault of such beings is not in the heart &mdash; it is in the 
judgment.  Sociability, in this degree, is a sort of magnetism awakened 
in us  
 
<pb n="231"/>  
by the contemplation of a being similar to ourselves, but which never 
goes beyond the person who feels it; it may be reciprocated, but not 
communicated.  Love, benevolence, pity, sympathy, call it what you 
will, there is nothing in it which deserves esteem, &mdash; nothing which lifts 
man above the beast. 
</p> 
<p>The second degree of sociability is justice, which may be defined 
as the <hi rend="italic">recognition of the equality between another's personality 
and our own</hi>.  The sentiment of justice we share with the 
animals; we alone can form an exact idea of it; but our idea, as has been 
said already, does not change its nature.  We shall soon see how man 
rises to a third degree of sociability which the animals are incapable of 
reaching.  But I must first prove by metaphysics that <hi rend="italic">society, 
justice</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">equality</hi>, are three equivalent terms, &mdash; 
three expressions meaning the same thing, &mdash; whose mutual conversion is 
always allowable. 
</p> 
<p>If, amid the confusion of a shipwreck, having escaped in a boat 
with some provisions, I see a man struggling with the waves, am I bound 
to go to his assistance?  Yes, I am bound under penalty of being 
adjudged guilty of murder and treason against society. 
</p> 
<p>But am I also bound to share with him my provisions? 
</p> 
<p>To settle this question, we must change the phraseology.  If society 
is binding on the boat, is it also binding on the provisions?  
Undoubtedly.  The duty of an associate is absolute.  Man's occupancy 
succeeds his social nature, and is subordinate to it; possession can 
become exclusive only when permission to occupy is granted to all alike.  
That which in this instance obscures our duty is our power of foresight, 
which, causing us to fear an eventual danger, impels us to usurpation, 
and makes us robbers and murderers.  Animals do not calculate the duty 
of instinct any more than the disadvantages resulting to those who 
exercise it; it  
 
<pb n="232"/>  
would be strange if the intellect of man &mdash; the most sociable of animals &mdash; 
should lead him to disobey the law.  He betrays society who attempts to 
use it only for his own advantage; better that God should deprive us of 
prudence, if it is to serve as the tool of our selfishness. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; you will say, &ldquo;must I share my 
bread, the bread which I have earned and which belongs to me, with the 
stranger whom I do not know; whom I may never see again, and who, 
perhaps, will reward me with ingratitude?  If we had earned this bread 
together, if this man had done something to obtain it, he might demand 
his share, since his co-operation would entitle him to it; but as it is, what 
claim has he on me?  We have not produced together &mdash; we shall not eat 
together.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The fallacy in this argument lies in the false supposition, that each 
producer is not necessarily associated with every other producer. 
</p> 
<p>When two or more individuals have regularly organized a society, 
&mdash; when the contracts have been agreed upon, drafted, and signed, &mdash; 
there is no difficulty about the future.  Everybody knows that when two 
men associate &mdash; for instance &mdash; in order to fish, if one of them catches 
no fish, he is none the less entitled to those caught by his associate.  If 
two merchants form a partnership, while the partnership lasts, the profits 
and losses are divided between them; since each produces, not for 
himself, but for the society: when the time of distribution arrives, it is 
not the producer who is considered, but the associate.  That is why the 
slave, to whom the planter gives straw and rice; and the civilized 
laborer, to whom the capitalist pays a salary which is always too small, --not being associated with their employers, although producing with 
them, &mdash; are disregarded when the product is divided.  Thus,  
 
<pb n="233"/>  
the horse who draws our coaches, and the ox who draws our carts 
produce with us, but are not associated with us; we take their product, 
but do not share it with them.  The animals and laborers whom we 
employ hold the same relation to us.  Whatever we do for them, we do, 
not from a sense of justice, but out of pure benevolence.[1] 
</p> 
<p>But is it possible that we are not all associated?  Let us call to 
mind what was said in the last two chapters, That even though we do not 
want to be associated, the force of things, the necessity of consumption, 
the laws of production, and the mathematical principle of exchange 
combine to associate us.  There is but a single exception to this rule, &mdash; 
that of the proprietor, who, producing by his right of increase, is not 
associated with any one, and consequently is not obliged to share his 
product with any one; just as no one else is bound to share with him.  
With the exception of the proprietor, we labor for each other; we can do 
nothing by ourselves unaided by others, and we continually exchange 
products and services with each other.  If these are not social acts, what 
are they? 
</p> 
<p>Now, neither a commercial, nor an industrial, nor an agricultural 
association can be conceived of in the absence of equality; equality is its 
<hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>.  So that, in all matters which concern this 
association, to violate society is to violate justice and equality.  Apply 
this principle to humanity at large.  After what has been said, I assume 
that the reader 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] To perform an act of benevolence towards one's neighbor is 
called, in Hebrew, <hi rend="italic">to do justice;</hi> in Greek, <hi rend="italic">to take 
compassion</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pity</hi>  
(<foreign lang="grk"> elehmosunh</foreign>,from which is 
derived the French <hi rend="italic">aumone</hi>); in Latin, <hi rend="italic">to perform an 
act of love</hi> or <hi rend="italic">charity;</hi> in French, <hi rend="italic">give 
alms</hi>.  We can trace the degradation of this principle through 
these various expressions: the first signifies duty; the second only 
sympathy; the third, affection, a matter of choice, not an obligation; the 
fourth, caprice. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="234"/>  
has sufficient insight to enable him to dispense with any aid of mine. 
</p> 
<p>By this principle, the man who takes possession of a field, and 
says, &ldquo;This field is mine,&rdquo; will not be unjust so long as 
every one else has an equal right of possession; nor will he be unjust, if, 
wishing to change his location, he exchanges this field for an equivalent.  
But if, putting another in his place, he says to him, &ldquo;Work for 
me while I rest,&rdquo; he then becomes unjust, unassociated, 
<hi rend="italic">unequal</hi>.  He is a proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>Reciprocally, the sluggard, or the rake, who, without performing 
any social task, enjoys like others &mdash; and often more than others &mdash; the 
products of society, should be proceeded against as a thief and a 
parasite.  We owe it to ourselves to give him nothing; but, since he must 
live, to put him under supervision, and compel him to labor. 
</p> 
<p>Sociability is the attraction felt by sentient beings for each other.  
Justice is this same attraction, accompanied by thought and knowledge.  
But under what general concept, in what category of the understanding, 
is justice placed?  In the category of equal quantities.  Hence, the ancient 
definition of justice &mdash;  <hi rend="italic">Justum &aelig;quale est, injustum 
in&aelig;quale</hi>.  What is it, then, to practise justice?  It is to give 
equal wealth to each, on condition of equal labor.  It is to act socially.  
Our selfishness may complain; there is no escape from evidence and 
necessity. 
</p> 
<p>What is the right of occupancy?  It is a natural method of dividing 
the earth, by reducing each laborer's share as fast as new laborers 
present themselves.  This right disappears if the public interest requires 
it; which, being the social interest, is also that of the occupant. 
</p> 
<p>What is the right of labor?  It is the right to obtain one's  
 
<pb n="235"/>  
share of wealth by fulfilling the required conditions.  It is the right of 
society, the right of equality. 
</p> 
<p>Justice, which is the product of the combination of an idea and an 
instinct, manifests itself in man as soon as he is capable of feeling, and 
of forming ideas.  Consequently, it has been regarded as an innate and 
original sentiment; but this opinion is logically and chronologically false.  
But justice, by its composition hybrid &mdash; if I may use the term, &mdash; justice, 
born of emotion and intellect combined, seems to me one of the strongest 
proofs of the unity and simplicity of the <hi rend="italic">ego;</hi> the organism 
being no more capable of producing such a mixture by itself, than are 
the combined senses of hearing and sight of forming a binary sense, half 
auditory and half visual. 
</p> 
<p>This double nature of justice gives us the definitive basis of all the 
demonstrations in Chapters II., III., and IV.  On the one hand, the idea 
of <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> being identical with that of society, and society 
necessarily implying equality, equality must underlie all the sophisms 
invented in defence of property; for, since property can be defended only 
as a just and social institution, and property being inequality, in order to 
prove that property is in harmony with society, it must be shown that 
injustice is justice, and that inequality is equality, &mdash; a contradiction in 
terms.  On the other hand, since the idea of equality &mdash; the second 
element of justice &mdash; has its source in the mathematical proportions of 
things; and since property, or the unequal distribution of wealth among 
laborers, destroys the necessary balance between labor, production, and 
consumption, &mdash; property must be impossible. 
</p> 
<p>All men, then, are associated; all are entitled to the same justice; 
all are equal.  Does it follow that the preferences of love and friendship 
are unjust? 
 
 
<pb n="236"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>This requires explanation.  I have already supposed the case of a 
man in peril, I being in a position to help him.  Now, I suppose myself 
appealed to at the same time by two men exposed to danger.  Am I not 
allowed &mdash; am I not commanded even &mdash; to rush first to the aid of him 
who is endeared to me by ties of blood, friendship, acquaintance, or 
esteem, at the risk of leaving the other to perish?  Yes.  And why?  
Because within universal society there exist for each of us as many 
special societies as there are individuals; and we are bound, by the 
principle of sociability itself, to fulfil the obligations which these impose 
upon us, according to the intimacy of our relations with them.  Therefore 
we must give our father, mother, children, friends, relatives, &amp;c., the 
preference over all others.  But in what consists this preference? 
</p> 
<p>A judge has a case to decide, in which one of the parties is his 
friend, and the other his enemy.  Should he, in this instance, prefer his 
<hi rend="italic">intimate associate</hi> to his <hi rend="italic">distant associate;</hi> 
and decide the case in favor of his friend, in spite of evidence to the 
contrary?  No: for, if he should favor his friend's injustice, he would 
become his accomplice in his violation of the social compact; he would 
form with him a sort of conspiracy against the social body.  Preference 
should be shown only in personal matters, such as love, esteem, 
confidence, or intimacy, when all cannot be considered at once.  Thus, 
in case of fire, a father would save his own child before thinking of his 
neighbor's; but the recognition of a right not being an optional matter 
with a judge, he is not at liberty to favor one person to the detriment of 
another. 
</p> 
<p>The theory of these special societies &mdash; which are formed 
concentrically, so to speak, by each of us inside of the main body &mdash; 
gives the key to all the problems which arise from  
 
<pb n="237"/>  
the opposition and conflict of the different varieties of social duty, &mdash; 
problems upon which the ancient tragedies are based. 
</p> 
<p>The justice practised among animals is, in a certain degree, 
negative.  With the exception of protecting their young, hunting and 
plundering in troops, uniting for common defence and sometimes for 
individual assistance, it consists more in prevention than in action.  A 
sick animal who cannot arise from the ground, or an imprudent one who 
has fallen over a precipice, receives neither medicine nor nourishment.  
If he cannot cure himself, nor relieve himself of his trouble, his life is in 
danger: he will neither be cared for in bed, nor fed in a prison.  Their 
neglect of their fellows arises as much from the weakness of their 
intellect as from their lack of resources.  Still, the degrees of intimacy 
common among men are not unknown to the animals.  They have 
friendships of habit and of choice; friendships neighborly, and 
friendships parental.  In comparison with us, they have feeble memories, 
sluggish feelings, and are almost destitute of intelligence; but the identity 
of these faculties is preserved to some extent, and our superiority in this 
respect arises entirely from our understanding. 
</p> 
<p>It is our strength of memory and penetration of judgment which 
enable us to multiply and combine the acts which our social instinct 
impels us to perform, and which teaches us how to render them more 
effective, and how to distribute them justly.  The beasts who live in 
society practise justice, but are ignorant of its nature, and do not reason 
upon it; they obey their instinct without thought or philosophy.  They 
know not how to unite the social sentiment with the idea of equality, 
which they do not possess; this idea being an abstract one.  We, on the 
contrary, starting with the principle that society implies equality, can, by 
our reasoning faculty,  
 
<pb n="238"/>  
understand and agree with each other in settling our rights; we have even 
used our judgment to a great extent.  But in all this our conscience plays 
a small part, as is proved by the fact that the idea of <hi rend="italic">right</hi> 
&mdash; of which we catch a glimpse in certain animals who approach nearer 
than any others to our standard of intelligence &mdash; seems to grow, from 
the low level at which it stands in savages, to the lofty height which it 
reaches in a Plato or a Franklin.  If we trace the development of the 
moral sense in individuals, and the progress of laws in nations, we shall 
be convinced that the ideas of justice and legislative perfection are 
always proportional to intelligence.  The notion of justice &mdash; which has 
been regarded by some philosophers as simple &mdash; is then, in reality, 
complex.  It springs from the social instinct on the one hand, and the 
idea of equality on the other; just as the notion of guilt arises from the 
feeling that justice has been violated, and from the idea of free-will. 
</p> 
<p>In conclusion, instinct is not modified by acquaintance with its 
nature; and the facts of society, which we have thus far observed, occur 
among beasts as well as men.  We know the meaning of justice; in other 
words, of sociability viewed from the standpoint of equality.  We have 
met with nothing which separates us from the animals. 
 
&sect; 3. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Of the third degree of Sociability</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The reader, perhaps, has not forgotten what was said in the third 
chapter concerning the division of labor and the speciality of talents.  
The sum total of the talents and capacities of the race is always the 
same, and their nature is always similar.  We are all born poets, 
mathematicians, philosophers, artists, artisans, or farmers, but we are 
not born equally endowed; and between one man and another in society, 
or  
 
<pb n="239"/>  
between one faculty and another in the same individual, there is an 
infinite difference.  This difference of degree in the same faculties, this 
predominance of talent in certain directions, is, we have said, the very 
foundation of our society.  Intelligence and natural genius have been 
distributed by Nature so economically, and yet so liberally, that in 
society there is no danger of either a surplus or a scarcity of special 
talents; and that each laborer, by devoting himself to his function, may 
always attain to the degree of proficiency necessary to enable him to 
benefit by the labors and discoveries of his fellows.  Owing to this 
simple and wise precaution of Nature, the laborer is not isolated by his 
task.  He communicates with his fellows through the mind, before he is 
united with them in heart; so that with him love is born of intelligence. 
</p> 
<p>It is not so with societies of animals.  In every species, the 
aptitudes of all the individuals &mdash; though very limited &mdash; are equal in 
number and (when they are not the result of instinct) in intensity.  Each 
one does as well as all the others what all the others do; provides his 
food, avoids the enemy, burrows in the earth, builds a nest, &amp;c.  No 
animal, when free and healthy, expects or requires the aid of his 
neighbor; who, in his turn, is equally independent. 
</p> 
<p>Associated animals live side by side without any intellectual 
intercourse or intimate communication, &mdash; all doing the same things, 
having nothing to learn or to remember; they see, feel, and come in 
contact with each other, but never penetrate each other.  Man continually 
exchanges with man ideas and feelings, products and services.  Every 
discovery and act in society is necessary to him.  But of this immense 
quantity of products and ideas, that which each one has to produce and 
acquire for himself is but an atom in the sun.  Man  
 
<pb n="240"/>  
would not be man were it not for society, and society is supported by the 
balance and harmony of the powers which compose it. 
</p> 
<p>Society, among the animals, is <hi rend="italic">simple;</hi> with man it is 
<hi rend="italic">complex</hi>.  Man is associated with man by the same instinct 
which associates animal with animal; but man is associated differently 
from the animal, and it is this difference in association which constitutes 
the difference in morality. 
</p> 
<p>I have proved, &mdash; at too great length, perhaps, &mdash; both by the spirit 
of the laws which regard property as the basis of society, and by political 
economy, that inequality of conditions is justified neither by priority of 
occupation nor superiority of talent, service, industry, and capacity.  
But, although equality of conditions is a necessary consequence of 
natural right, of liberty, of the laws of production, of the capacity of 
physical nature, and of the principle of society itself, &mdash; it does not 
prevent the social sentiment from stepping over the boundaries of 
<hi rend="italic">debt</hi> and <hi rend="italic">credit</hi>.  The fields of benevolence 
and love extend far beyond; and when economy has adjusted its balance, 
the mind begins to benefit by its own justice, and the heart expands in 
the boundlessness of its affection. 
</p> 
<p>The social sentiment then takes on a new character, which varies 
with different persons.  In the strong, it becomes the pleasure of 
generosity; among equals, frank and cordial friendship; in the weak, the 
pleasure of admiration and gratitude. 
</p> 
<p>The man who is superior in strength, skill, or courage, knows that 
he owes all that he is to society, without which he could not exist.  He 
knows that, in treating him precisely as it does the lowest of its 
members, society discharges its whole duty towards him.  But he does 
not underrate his faculties; he is no less conscious of his power and 
greatness;  
 
<pb n="241"/>  
and it is this voluntary reverence which he pays to humanity, this avowal 
that he is but an instrument of Nature, &mdash; who is alone worthy of glory 
and worship, &mdash; it is, I say, this simultaneous confession of the heart and 
the mind, this genuine adoration of the Great Being, that distinguishes 
and elevates man, and lifts him to a degree of social morality to which 
the beast is powerless to attain.  Hercules destroying the monsters and 
punishing brigands for the safety of Greece, Orpheus teaching the rough 
and wild Pelasgians, &mdash; neither of them putting a price upon their 
services, &mdash; there we see the noblest creations of poetry, the loftiest 
expression of justice and virtue. 
</p> 
<p>The joys of self-sacrifice are ineffable. 
</p> 
<p>If I were to compare human society to the old Greek tragedies, I 
should say that the phalanx of noble minds and lofty souls dances the 
<hi rend="italic">strophe</hi>, and the humble multitude the 
<hi rend="italic">antistrophe</hi>.  Burdened with painful and disagreeable tasks, 
but rendered omnipotent by their number and the harmonic arrangement 
of their functions, the latter execute what the others plan.  Guided by 
them, they owe them nothing; they honor them, however, and lavish 
upon them praise and approbation. 
</p> 
<p>Gratitude fills people with adoration and enthusiasm. 
</p> 
<p>But equality delights my heart.  Benevolence degenerates into 
tyranny, and admiration into servility.  Friendship is the daughter of 
equality.  O my friends! may I live in your midst without emulation, and 
without glory; let equality bring us together, and fate assign us our 
places.  May I die without knowing to whom among you I owe the most 
esteem! 
</p> 
<p>Friendship is precious to the hearts of the children of men. 
</p> 
<p>Generosity, gratitude (I mean here only that gratitude which is 
born of admiration of a superior power), and friendship are three distinct 
shades of a single sentiment which I will call  
 
<pb n="242"/>  
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">social 
proportionality</hi>.[1]  <hi rend="italic">Equit&eacute;</hi> does not change 
justice: but, always taking <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> for the 
base, it superadds esteem, and thereby forms in man a third degree of 
sociability.  <hi rend="italic">Equit&eacute;</hi> makes it at once our duty and 
our pleasure to aid the weak who have need of us, and to make them our 
equals; to pay to the strong a just tribute of gratitude and honor, without 
enslaving ourselves to them; to cherish our neighbors, friends, and 
equals, for that which we receive from them, even by right of exchange.  
<hi rend="italic">Equit&eacute;</hi> is sociability raised to its ideal by reason 
and justice; its commonest manifestation is <hi rend="italic">urbanity</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">politeness</hi>, which, among certain nations, sums up in a 
single word nearly all the social duties. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this feeling is unknown among the beasts, who love and 
cling to each other, and show their preferences, but who cannot conceive 
of esteem, and who are incapable of generosity, admiration, or 
politeness. 
</p> 
<p>This feeling does not spring from intelligence, which calculates, 
computes, and balances, but does not love; which sees, but does not feel.  
As justice is the product of social instinct and reflection combined, so 
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> is a product of justice and taste 
combined &mdash; that is, of our powers of judging and of idealizing. 
</p> 
<p>This product &mdash; the third and last degree of human sociability &mdash; is 
determined by our complex mode of association; in which inequality, or 
rather the divergence of faculties, and the speciality of functions &mdash; 
tending of themselves to isolate laborers &mdash; demand a more active 
sociability. 
</p> 
<p>That is why the force which oppresses while protecting is 
 
 
[1]  I mean here by <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> what the Latins 
called <hi rend="italic">humanitas</hi>, &mdash; that is, the kind of sociability which is 
peculiar to man.  Humanity, gentle and courteous to all, knows how to 
distinguish ranks, virtues, and capacities without injury to any.  It is the 
just distribution of social sympathy and universal love. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="243"/>  
execrable; why the silly ignorance which views with the same eye the 
marvels of art, and the products of the rudest industry, excites 
unutterable contempt; why proud mediocrity, which glories in saying, 
&ldquo;I have paid you &mdash; I owe you nothing,&rdquo; is especially 
odious. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Sociability, justice, &eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> &mdash; such, in 
its triplicity, is the exact definition of the instinctive faculty which leads 
us into communication with our fellows, and whose physical 
manifestation is expressed by the formula:  <hi rend="italic">Equality in natural 
wealth, and the products of labor</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>These three degrees of sociability support and imply each other.  
<hi rend="italic">Equit&eacute;</hi> cannot exist without justice; society without 
justice is a solecism.  If, in order to reward talent, I take from one to 
give to another, in unjustly stripping the first, I do not esteem his talent 
as I ought; if, in society, I award more to myself than to my associate, 
we are not really associated.  Justice is sociability as manifested in the 
division of material things, susceptible of weight and measure; 
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> is justice accompanied by admiration 
and esteem, &mdash; things which cannot be measured. 
</p> 
<p>From this several inferences may be drawn. 
</p> 
<p>1. Though we are free to grant our esteem to one more than to 
another, and in all possible degrees, yet we should give no one more 
than his proportion of the common wealth; because the duty of justice, 
being imposed upon us before that of 
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>, must always take precedence of it.  
The woman honored by the ancients, who, when forced by a tyrant to 
choose between the death of her brother and that of her husband, 
sacrificed the latter on the ground that she could find another husband 
but not another brother, &mdash; that woman, I say, in obeying her sense of 
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>, failed in point of justice, and did a 
bad deed, because conjugal association is a closer  
 
<pb n="244"/>  
relation than fraternal association, and because the life of our neighbor is 
not our property. 
</p> 
<p>By the same principle, inequality of wages cannot be admitted by 
law on the ground of inequality of talents; because the just distribution of 
wealth is the function of economy, &mdash; not of enthusiasm. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, as regards donations, wills, and inheritance, society, 
careful both of the personal affections and its own rights, must never 
permit love and partiality to destroy justice.  And, though it is pleasant 
to think that the son, who has been long associated with his father in 
business, is more capable than any one else of carrying it on; and that 
the citizen, who is surprised in the midst of his task by death, is best 
fitted, in consequence of his natural taste for his occupation, to designate 
his successor; and though the heir should be allowed the right of choice 
in case of more than one inheritance, &mdash; nevertheless, society can tolerate 
no concentration of capital and industry for the benefit of a single man, 
no monopoly of labor, no encroachment.[1] 
 
 
[1]  Justice and <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> never have been 
understood. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Suppose that some spoils, taken from the enemy, and 
equal to twelve, are to be divided between Achilles and Ajax.  If the two 
persons were equal, their respective shares would be arithmetically 
equal: Achilles would have six, Ajax six.  And if we should carry out 
this arithmetical equality, Thersites would be entitled to as much as 
Achilles, which would be unjust in the extreme.  To avoid this injustice, 
the worth of the persons should be estimated, and the spoils divided 
accordingly.  Suppose that the worth of Achilles is double that of Ajax: 
the former's share is eight, the latter four.  There is no arithmetical 
equality, but a proportional equality.  It is this comparison of merits, 
<hi rend="italic">rationum</hi>, that Aristotle calls distributive justice.  It is a 
geometrical proportion.&rdquo; &mdash; Toullier:  <hi rend="italic">French Law 
according to the Code</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Are Achilles and Ajax associated, or are they not?  Settle that, and 
you settle the whole question.  If Achilles and Ajax, instead of being 
associated, are themselves in the service of Agamemnon who pays them, 
there is no objection to Aristotle's method.  The slave-owner, who 
controls his slaves, may give a 
 
 
<pb n="245"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Equit&eacute;</hi>, justice, and society, can exist only 
between individuals of the same species.  They form no part of the 
relations of different races to each other, &mdash; for instance, of the wolf to 
the goat, of the goat to man, of man to God, much less of God to man.  
The attribution of justice, equity, and love to the Supreme Being is pure 
anthropomorphism; and the adjectives just, merciful, pitiful, and the like, 
should be stricken from our litanies.  God can be regarded as just, 
equitable, and good, only to another God.  Now, God has no associate; 
consequently, he cannot experience social affections, &mdash; such as 
goodness, <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>, and justice.  Is the 
shepherd said to be just to his sheep and his dogs?  No: and if he saw fit 
to shear as much wool from a lamb six months old, as from a ram of 
two years; or, if he required as much work from a young dog as from an 
old one, &mdash; they would say, not that he was unjust, but that he was 
foolish.  Between man and beast there is no society, though there may be 
affection.  Man loves the animals as <hi rend="italic">things</hi>, &mdash; as 
<hi rend="italic">sentient things</hi>, if you will, &mdash; but not as 
<hi rend="italic">persons</hi>.  Philosophy, after having eliminated from the idea 
of God the passions ascribed to him by super-<lb/>

[Footnote continued]<lb/> 
double allowance of brandy to him who does double work.  That is the 
law of despotism; the right of slavery.  But if Achilles and Ajax are 
associated, they are equals.  What matters it that Achilles has a strength 
of four, while that of Ajax is only two?  The latter may always answer 
that he is free; that if Achilles has a strength of four, five could kill him; 
finally, that in doing personal service he incurs as great a risk as 
Achilles.  The same argument applies to Thersites.  If he is unable to 
fight, let him be cook, purveyor, or butler.  If he is good for nothing, 
put him in the hospital.  In no case wrong him, or impose upon him 
laws. 
</p> 
<p>Man must live in one of two states: either in society, or out of it.  
In society, conditions are necessarily equal, except in the degree of 
esteem and consideration which each one may receive.  Out of society, 
man is so much raw material, a capitalized tool, and often an 
incommodious and useless piece of furniture. [End of footnote] 
 
 
<pb n="246"/>  
stition, will then be obliged to eliminate also the virtues which our 
liberal piety awards to him.[1] 
</p> 
<p>If God should come down to earth, and dwell among us, we could 
not love him unless he became like us; nor give him any thing unless he 
produced something; nor listen to him unless he proved us mistaken; nor 
worship him unless he manifested his power.  All the laws of our nature, 
affectional, economical, and intellectual, would prevent us from treating 
him as we treat our fellow-men, &mdash; that is, according to reason, justice, 
and <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>.  I infer from this that, if God 
should wish ever to put himself into immediate communication with 
man, he would have to become a man. 
</p> 
<p>Now, if kings are images of God, and executors of his will, they 
cannot receive love, wealth, obedience, and glory from us, unless they 
consent to labor and associate with us &mdash; produce as much as they 
consume, reason with their subjects, and do wonderful things.  Still 
more; if, as some pretend, kings are public functionaries, the love which 
is due them is measured by their personal amiability; our obligation to 
obey them, by the wisdom of their commands; and their civil list, by the 
total social production divided by the number of citizens. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, jurisprudence, political economy, and psychology agree in 
admitting the law of equality.  Right and duty &mdash;  
 
 
[1]  Between woman and man there may exist love, passion, ties of 
custom, and the like; but there is no real society.  Man and woman are 
not companions.  The difference of the sexes places a barrier between 
them, like that placed between animals by a difference of race.  
Consequently, far from advocating what is now called the emancipation 
of woman, I should incline, rather, if there were no other alternative, to 
exclude her from society. 
</p> 
<p>The rights of woman and her relations with man are yet to be 
determined Matrimonial legislation, like civil legislation, is a matter for 
the future to settle. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="247"/>  
the due reward of talent and labor &mdash; the outbursts of love and 
enthusiasm, &mdash; all are regulated in advance by an invariable standard; all 
depend upon number and balance.  Equality of conditions is the law of 
society, and universal solidarity is the ratification of this law. 
</p> 
<p>Equality of conditions has never been realized, thanks to our 
passions and our ignorance; but our opposition to this law has made it all 
the more a necessity.  To that fact history bears perpetual testimony, and 
the course of events reveals it to us.  Society advances from equation to 
equation.  To the eyes of the economist, the revolutions of empires seem 
now like the reduction of algebraical quantities, which are inter-deducible; now like the discovery of unknown quantities, induced by the 
inevitable influence of time.  Figures are the providence of history.  
Undoubtedly there are other elements in human progress; but in the 
multitude of hidden causes which agitate nations, there is none more 
powerful or constant, none less obscure, than the periodical explosions of 
the proletariat against property.  Property, acting by exclusion and 
encroachment, while population was increasing, has been the life-principle and definitive cause of all revolutions.  Religious wars, and 
wars of conquest, when they have stopped short of the extermination of 
races, have been only accidental disturbances, soon repaired by the 
mathematical progression of the life of nations.  The downfall and death 
of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property. 
</p> 
<p>In the middle ages, take Florence, &mdash; a republic of merchants and 
brokers, always rent by its well-known factions, the Guelphs and 
Ghibellines, who were, after all, only the people and the proprietors 
fighting against each other, &mdash; Florence, ruled by bankers, and borne 
down at last by the weight  
 
<pb n="248"/>  
of her debts;[1] in ancient times, take Rome, preyed upon from its birth 
by usury, flourishing, nevertheless, as long as the known world 
furnished its terrible proletaires with <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>, stained with 
blood by civil war at every interval of rest, and dying of exhaustion 
when the people lost, together with their former energy, their last spark 
of moral sense; Carthage, a commercial and financial city, continually 
divided by internal competition; Tyre, Sidon, Jerusalem, Nineveh, 
Babylon, ruined, in turn, by commercial rivalry and, as we now express 
it, by panics in the market, &mdash; do not these famous examples show clearly 
enough the fate which awaits modern nations, unless the people, unless 
France, with a sudden burst of her powerful voice, proclaims in thunder-tones the abolition of the <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi> of property? 
</p> 
<p>Here my task should end.  I have proved the right of the poor; I 
have shown the usurpation of the rich.  I demand justice; it is not my 
business to execute the sentence.  If it should be argued &mdash; in order to 
prolong for a few years an illegitimate privilege &mdash; that it is not enough 
to demonstrate equality, that it is necessary also to organize it, and above 
all to establish it peacefully, I might reply:  The welfare of the oppressed 
is of more importance than official composure.  Equality of conditions is 
a natural law upon which public economy and jurisprudence are based.  
The right to labor, and the principle of equal distribution of wealth, 
cannot give way to the anxieties of power.  It is not for the proletaire to 
reconcile the contradictions of the codes, still less to suffer for the errors 
of the government.  On the contrary, it is the duty of the civil and 
administrative power to recon- 
 
[1]  &ldquo;The strong-box of Cosmo de Medici was the grave of 
Florentine liberty,&rdquo; said M. Michelet to the College of France. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="249"/>  
struct itself on the basis of political equality.  An evil, when known, 
should be condemned and destroyed.  The legislator cannot plead 
ignorance as an excuse for upholding a glaring iniquity.  Restitution 
should not be delayed.  Justice, justice! recognition of right! 
reinstatement of the proletaire! &mdash; when these results are accomplished, 
then, judges and consuls, you may attend to your police, and provide a 
government for the Republic! 
</p> 
<p>For the rest, I do not think that a single one of my readers accuses 
me of knowing how to destroy, but of not knowing how to construct.  In 
demonstrating the principle of equality, I have laid the foundation of the 
social structure I have done more.  I have given an example of the true 
method of solving political and legislative problems.  Of the science 
itself, I confess that I know nothing more than its principle; and I know 
of no one at present who can boast of having penetrated deeper.  Many 
people cry, &ldquo;Come to me, and I will teach you the truth!&rdquo;  
These people mistake for the truth their cherished opinion and ardent 
conviction, which is usually any thing but the truth.  The science of 
society &mdash; like all human sciences &mdash; will be for ever incomplete.  The 
depth and variety of the questions which it embraces are infinite.  We 
hardly know the A B C of this science, as is proved by the fact that we 
have not yet emerged from the period of systems, and have not ceased to 
put the authority of the majority in the place of facts.  A certain 
philological society decided linguistic questions by a plurality of votes.  
Our parliamentary debates &mdash; were their results less pernicious &mdash; would 
be even more ridiculous.  The task of the true publicist, in the age in 
which we live, is to close the mouths of quacks and charlatans, and to 
teach the public to demand demonstrations, instead of being contented 
with symbols and  
 
<pb n="250"/>  
programmes.  Before talking of the science itself, it is necessary to 
ascertain its object, and discover its method and principle.  The ground 
must be cleared of the prejudices which encumber it.  Such is the 
mission of the nineteenth century. 
</p> 
<p>For my part, I have sworn fidelity to my work of demolition, and I 
will not cease to pursue the truth through the ruins and rubbish.  I hate 
to see a thing half done; and it will be believed without any assurance of 
mine, that, having dared to raise my hand against the Holy Ark, I shall 
not rest contented with the removal of the cover.  The mysteries of the 
sanctuary of iniquity must be unveiled, the tables of the old alliance 
broken, and all the objects of the ancient faith thrown in a heap to the 
swine.  A charter has been given to us, &mdash; a 
<hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</hi> of political science, the monument 
of twenty legislatures.  A code has been written, &mdash; the pride of a 
conqueror, and the summary of ancient wisdom.  Well! of this charter 
and this code not one article shall be left standing upon another!  The 
time has come for the wise to choose their course, and prepare for

PART SECOND. 
 
 
&sect; 1. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Of the Causes of our Mistakes.  The Origin of 
Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>The true form of human society cannot be determined until the 
following question has been solved: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Property not being our natural condition, how did it gain a  
 
<pb n="251"/>  
foothold?  Why has the social instinct, so trustworthy among the 
animals, erred in the case of man?  Why is man, who was born for 
society, not yet associated? 
</p> 
<p>I have said that human society is <hi rend="italic">complex</hi> in its 
nature.  Though this expression is inaccurate, the fact to which it refers 
is none the less true; namely, the classification of talents and capacities.  
But who does not see that these talents and capacities, owing to their 
infinite variety, give rise to an infinite variety of wills, and that the 
character, the inclinations, and &mdash; if I may venture to use the expression --the form of the <hi rend="italic">ego</hi>, are necessarily changed; so that in 
the order of liberty, as in the order of intelligence, there are as many 
types as individuals, as many characters as heads, whose tastes, fancies, 
and propensities, being modified by dissimilar ideas, must necessarily 
conflict?  Man, by his nature and his instinct, is predestined to society; 
but his personality, ever varying, is adverse to it. 
</p> 
<p>In societies of animals, all the members do exactly the same 
things.  The same genius directs them; the same will animates them.  A 
society of beasts is a collection of atoms, round, hooked, cubical, or 
triangular, but always perfectly identical.  These personalities do not 
vary, and we might say that a single <hi rend="italic">ego</hi> governs them all.  
The labors which animals perform, whether alone or in society, are exact 
reproductions of their character.  Just as the swarm of bees is composed 
of individual bees, alike in nature and equal in value, so the honeycomb 
is formed of individual cells, constantly and invariably repeated. 
</p> 
<p>But man's intelligence, fitted for his social destiny and his personal 
needs, is of a very different composition, and therefore gives rise to a 
wonderful variety of human wills.  In the bee, the will is constant and 
uniform, because the instinct  
 
<pb n="252"/>  
which guides it is invariable, and constitutes the animal's whole life and 
nature.  In man, talent varies, and the mind wavers; consequently, his 
will is multiform and vague.  He seeks society, but dislikes constraint 
and monotony; he is an imitator, but fond of his own ideas, and 
passionately in love with his works. 
</p> 
<p>If, like the bees, every man were born possessed of talent, perfect 
knowledge of certain kinds, and, in a word, an innate acquaintance with 
the functions he has to perform, but destitute of reflective and reasoning 
faculties, society would organize itself.  We should see one man plowing 
a field, another building houses; this one forging metals, that one cutting 
clothes; and still others storing the products, and superintending their 
distribution.  Each one, without inquiring as to the object of his labor, 
and without troubling himself about the extent of his task, would obey 
orders, bring his product, receive his salary, and would then rest for a 
time; keeping meanwhile no accounts, envious of nobody, and satisfied 
with the distributor, who never would be unjust to any one.  Kings 
would govern, but would not reign; for to reign is to be a 
<hi rend="italic">proprietor &agrave; l'engrais</hi>, as Bonaparte said: and 
having no commands to give, since all would be at their posts, they 
would serve rather as rallying centres than as authorities or counsellors.  
It would be a state of ordered communism, but not a society entered into 
deliberately and freely. 
</p> 
<p>But man acquires skill only by observation and experiment.  He 
reflects, then, since to observe and experiment is to reflect; he reasons, 
since he cannot help reasoning.  In reflecting, he becomes deluded; in 
reasoning, he makes mistakes, and, thinking himself right, persists in 
them.  He is wedded to his opinions; he esteems himself, and despises 
others.  Consequently, he isolates himself; for he could not submit to  
 
<pb n="253"/>  
the majority without renouncing his will and his reason, &mdash; that is, 
without disowning himself, which is impossible.  And this isolation, this 
intellectual egotism, this individuality of opinion, lasts until the truth is 
demonstrated to him by observation and experience. 
A final illustration will make these facts still clearer. 
</p> 
<p>If to the blind but convergent and harmonious instincts of a swarm 
of bees should be suddenly added reflection and judgment, the little 
society could not long exist.  In the first place, the bees would not fail to 
try some new industrial process; for instance, that of making their cells 
round or square.  All sorts of systems and inventions would be tried, 
until long experience, aided by geometry, should show them that the 
hexagonal shape is the best.  Then insurrections would occur.  The 
drones would be told to provide for themselves, and the queens to labor; 
jealousy would spread among the laborers; discords would burst forth; 
soon each one would want to produce on his own account; and finally 
the hive would be abandoned, and the bees would perish.  Evil would be 
introduced into the honey-producing republic by the power of reflection, 
&mdash; the very faculty which ought to constitute its glory. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, moral evil, or, in this case, disorder in society, is naturally 
explained by our power of reflection.  The mother of poverty, crime, 
insurrection, and war was inequality of conditions; which was the 
daughter of property, which was born of selfishness, which was 
engendered by private opinion, which descended in a direct line from the 
autocracy of reason.  Man, in his infancy, is neither criminal nor 
barbarous, but ignorant and inexperienced.  Endowed with imperious 
instincts which are under the control of his reasoning faculty, at first he 
reflects but little, and reasons inaccurately; then, benefit 
 
<pb n="254"/>  
ing by his mistakes, he rectifies his ideas, and perfects his reason.  In 
the first place, it is the savage sacrificing all his possessions for a 
trinket, and then repenting and weeping; it is Esau selling his birthright 
for a mess of pottage, and afterwards wishing to cancel the bargain; it is 
the civilized workman laboring in insecurity, and continually demanding 
that his wages be increased, neither he nor his employer understanding 
that, in the absence of equality, any salary, however large, is always 
insufficient.  Then it is Naboth dying to defend his inheritance; Cato 
tearing out his entrails that he might not be enslaved; Socrates drinking 
the fatal cup in defence of liberty of thought; it is the third estate of '89 
reclaiming its liberty: soon it will be the people demanding equality of 
wages and an equal division of the means of production. 
</p> 
<p>Man is born a social being, &mdash; that is, he seeks equality and justice 
in all his relations, but he loves independence and praise.  The difficulty 
of satisfying these various desires at the same time is the primary cause 
of the despotism of the will, and the appropriation which results from it.  
On the other hand, man always needs a market for his products; unable 
to compare values of different kinds, he is satisfied to judge 
approximately, according to his passion and caprice; and he engages in 
dishonest commerce, which always results in wealth and poverty.  Thus, 
the greatest evils which man suffers arise from the misuse of his social 
nature, of this same justice of which he is so proud, and which he 
applies with such deplorable ignorance.  The practice of justice is a 
science which, when once discovered and diffused, will sooner or later 
put an end to social disorder, by teaching us our rights and duties. 
</p> 
<p>This progressive and painful education of our instinct, this slow 
and imperceptible transformation of our spontaneous  
 
<pb n="255"/>  
perceptions into deliberate knowledge, does not take place among the 
animals, whose instincts remain fixed, and never become enlightened. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;According to Frederic Cuvier, who has so clearly 
distinguished between instinct and intelligence in animals, `instinct is a 
natural and inherent faculty, like feeling, irritability, or intelligence.  
The wolf and the fox who recognize the traps in which they have been 
caught, and who avoid them; the dog and the horse, who understand the 
meaning of several of our words, and who obey us, &mdash; thereby show 
<hi rend="italic">intelligence</hi>.  The dog who hides the remains of his dinner, 
the bee who constructs his cell, the bird who builds his nest, act only 
from <hi rend="italic">instinct</hi>.  Even man has instincts: it is a special 
instinct which leads the new-born child to suck.  But, in man, almost 
every thing is accomplished by intelligence; and intelligence supplements 
instinct.  The opposite is true of animals: their instinct is given them as a 
supplement to their intelligence.' &rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Flourens:  Analytical 
Summary of the Observations of F. Cuvier</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;We can form a clear idea of instinct only by admitting that 
animals have in their <hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi>, images or innate and 
constant sensations, which influence their actions in the same manner 
that ordinary and accidental sensations commonly do.  It is a sort of 
dream, or vision, which always follows them and in all which relates to 
instinct they may be regarded as somnambulists.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">F. 
Cuvier:  Introduction to the Animal Kingdom</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Intelligence and instinct being common, then, though in different 
degrees, to animals and man, what is the distinguishing characteristic of 
the latter?  According to F. Cuvier, it is <hi rend="italic">reflection or the power of 
intellectually considering our own modifications by a survey of 
ourselves</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This lacks clearness, and requires an explanation. 
</p> 
<p>If we grant intelligence to animals, we must also grant them, in 
some degree, reflection; for, the first cannot exist without the second, as 
F. Cuvier himself has proved by numerous examples.  But notice that the 
learned observer defines the kind of reflection which distinguishes us 
from the animals as the <hi rend="italic">power of considering our own 
modifications</hi>.  This I shall endeavour to interpret, by developing  
 
<pb n="256"/>  
to the best of my ability the laconism of the philosophical naturalist. 
</p> 
<p>The intelligence acquired by animals never modifies the operations 
which they perform by instinct: it is given them only as a provision 
against unexpected accidents which might disturb these operations.  In 
man, on the contrary, instinctive action is constantly changing into 
deliberate action.  Thus, man is social by instinct, and is every day 
becoming social by reflection and choice.  At first, he formed his words 
by instinct;[1] he was a poet by inspiration: to-day, he makes grammar a 
science, and poetry an art.  His conception of God and a future life is 
spontaneous and instinctive, and his expressions of this conception have 
been, by turns, monstrous, eccentric, beautiful, comforting, and terrible.  
All these different creeds, at which the frivolous irreligion of the 
eighteenth century mocked, are modes of expression of the religious 
sentiment.  Some day, man will explain to himself 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;The problem of the origin of language is solved by the 
distinction made by Frederic Cuvier between instinct and intelligence.  
Language is not a premeditated, arbitrary, or conventional device; nor is 
it communicated or revealed to us by God.  Language is an instinctive 
and unpremeditated creation of man, as the hive is of the bee.  In this 
sense, it may be said that language is not the work of man, since it is not 
the work of his mind.  Further, the mechanism of language seems more 
wonderful and ingenious when it is not regarded as the result of 
reflection.  This fact is one of the most curious and indisputable which 
philology has observed.  See, among other works, a Latin essay by F. 
G. Bergmann (Strasbourg, 1839), in which the learned author explains 
how the phonetic germ is born of sensation; how language passes 
through three successive stages of development; why man, endowed at 
birth with the instinctive faculty of creating a language, loses this faculty 
as fast as his mind develops; and that the study of languages is real 
natural history, &mdash; in fact, a science.  France possesses to-day several 
philologists of the first rank, endowed with rare talents and deep 
philosophic insight, &mdash; modest <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> developing a science 
almost without the knowledge of the public; devoting themselves to 
studies which are scornfully looked down upon, and seeming to shun 
applause as much as others seek it.&rdquo; 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="257"/>  
the character of the God whom he believes in, and the nature of that 
other world to which his soul aspires. 
</p> 
<p>All that he does from instinct man despises; or, if he admires it, it 
is as Nature's work, not as his own.  This explains the obscurity which 
surrounds the names of early inventors; it explains also our indifference 
to religious matters, and the ridicule heaped upon religious customs.  
Man esteems only the products of reflection and of reason.  The most 
wonderful works of instinct are, in his eyes, only lucky <hi rend="italic">god-sends;</hi> he reserves the name <hi rend="italic">discovery</hi> &mdash; I had 
almost said creation &mdash; for the works of intelligence.  Instinct is the 
source of passion and enthusiasm; it is intelligence which causes crime 
and virtue. 
</p> 
<p>In developing his intelligence, man makes use of not only his own 
observations, but also those of others.  He keeps an account of his 
experience, and preserves the record; so that the race, as well as the 
individual, becomes more and more intelligent.  The animals do not 
transmit their knowledge; that which each individual accumulates dies 
with him. 
</p> 
<p>It is not enough, then, to say that we are distinguished from the 
animals by reflection, unless we mean thereby the <hi rend="italic">constant 
tendency of our instinct to become intelligence</hi>.  While man is 
governed by instinct, he is unconscious of his acts.  He never would 
deceive himself, and never would be troubled by errors, evils, and 
disorder, if, like the animals, instinct were his only guide.  But the 
Creator has endowed us with reflection, to the end that our instinct might 
become intelligence; and since this reflection and resulting knowledge 
pass through various stages, it happens that in the beginning our instinct 
is opposed, rather than guided, by reflection; consequently, that our 
power of thought leads us to act in opposition to our nature and our end; 
that, deceiving ourselves, we do and  
 
<pb n="258"/>  
suffer evil, until instinct which points us towards good, and reflection 
which makes us stumble into evil, are replaced by the science of good 
and evil, which invariably causes us to seek the one and avoid the other. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, evil &mdash; or error and its consequences &mdash; is the firstborn son of 
the union of two opposing faculties, instinct and reflection; good, or 
truth, must inevitably be the second child.  Or, to again employ the 
figure, evil is the product of incest between adverse powers; good will 
sooner or later be the legitimate child of their holy and mysterious union. 
</p> 
<p>Property, born of the reasoning faculty, intrenches itself behind 
comparisons.  But, just as reflection and reason are subsequent to 
spontaneity, observation to sensation, and experience to instinct, so 
property is subsequent to communism.  Communism &mdash; or association in 
a simple form &mdash; is the necessary object and original aspiration of the 
social nature, the spontaneous movement by which it manifests and 
establishes itself.  It is the first phase of human civilization.  In this state 
of society, &mdash; which the jurists have called <hi rend="italic">negative 
communism</hi> &mdash; man draws near to man, and shares with him the 
fruits of the field and the milk and flesh of animals.  Little by little this 
communism &mdash; negative as long as man does not produce &mdash; tends to 
become positive and organic through the development of labor and 
industry.  But it is then that the sovereignty of thought, and the terrible 
faculty of reasoning logically or illogically, teach man that, if equality is 
the <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of society, communism is the first species 
of slavery. 
To express this idea by an Hegelian formula, I will say: 
</p> 
<p>Communism &mdash; the first expression of the social nature &mdash; is the 
first term of social development, &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">thesis;</hi> property, 
the reverse of communism, is the second term, &mdash; the 
<hi rend="italic">antithesis</hi>.  When we have discovered the third term, the 
<hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi>,  
 
<pb n="259"/>  
we shall have the required solution.  Now, this synthesis necessarily 
results from the correction of the thesis by the antithesis.  Therefore it is 
necessary, by a final examination of their characteristics, to eliminate 
those features which are hostile to sociability.  The union of the two 
remainders will give us the true form of human association. 
 
 
&sect; 2. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Communism and of 
Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>I. I ought not to conceal the fact that property and communism 
have been considered always the only possible forms of society.  This 
deplorable error has been the life of property.  The disadvantages of 
communism are so obvious that its critics never have needed to employ 
much eloquence to thoroughly disgust men with it.  The irreparability of 
the injustice which it causes, the violence which it does to attractions and 
repulsions, the yoke of iron which it fastens upon the will, the moral 
torture to which it subjects the conscience, the debilitating effect which it 
has upon society; and, to sum it all up, the pious and stupid uniformity 
which it enforces upon the free, active, reasoning, unsubmissive 
personality of man, have shocked common sense, and condemned 
communism by an irrevocable decree. 
</p> 
<p>The authorities and examples cited in its favor disprove it.  The 
communistic republic of Plato involved slavery; that of Lycurgus 
employed Helots, whose duty it was to produce for their masters, thus 
enabling the latter to devote themselves exclusively to athletic sports and 
to war.  Even J. J. Rousseau &mdash; confounding communism and equality &mdash; 
has said somewhere that, without slavery, he did not think equality of 
conditions possible.  The communities of the early Church did not last 
the first century out, and soon degenerated into monasteries.  In those of 
the Jesuits of Paraguay, the condi 
 
<pb n="260"/>  
tion of the blacks is said by all travellers to be as miserable as that of 
slaves; and it is a fact that the good Fathers were obliged to surround 
themselves with ditches and walls to prevent their new converts from 
escaping.  The followers of Bab&oelig;uf &mdash; guided by a lofty horror of 
property rather than by any definite belief &mdash; were ruined by exaggeration 
of their principles; the St. Simonians, lumping communism and 
inequality, passed away like a masquerade.  The greatest danger to 
which society is exposed to-day is that of another shipwreck on this 
rock. 
</p> 
<p>Singularly enough, systematic communism &mdash; the deliberate 
negation of property &mdash; is conceived under the direct influence of the 
proprietary prejudice; and property is the basis of all communistic 
theories. 
</p> 
<p>The members of a community, it is true, have no private property; 
but the community is proprietor, and proprietor not only of the goods, 
but of the persons and wills.  In consequence of this principle of absolute 
property, labor, which should be only a condition imposed upon man by 
Nature, becomes in all communities a human commandment, and 
therefore odious.  Passive obedience, irreconcilable with a reflecting 
will, is strictly enforced.  Fidelity to regulations, which are always 
defective, however wise they may be thought, allows of no complaint.  
Life, talent, and all the human faculties are the property of the State, 
which has the right to use them as it pleases for the common good.  
Private associations are sternly prohibited, in spite of the likes and 
dislikes of different natures, because to tolerate them would be to 
introduce small communities within the large one, and consequently 
private property; the strong work for the weak, although this ought to be 
left to benevolence, and not enforced, advised, or enjoined; the 
industrious work for the  
 
<pb n="261"/>  
lazy, although this is unjust; the clever work for the foolish, although 
this is absurd; and, finally, man &mdash; casting aside his personality, his 
spontaneity, his genius, and his affections &mdash; humbly annihilates himself 
at the feet of the majestic and inflexible Commune! 
</p> 
<p>Communism is inequality, but not as property is.  Property is the 
exploitation of the weak by the strong.  Communism is the exploitation 
of the strong by the weak.  In property, inequality of conditions is the 
result of force, under whatever name it be disguised: physical and mental 
force; force of events, chance, <hi rend="italic">fortune;</hi> force of 
accumulated property, &amp;c.  In communism, inequality springs from 
placing mediocrity on a level with excellence.  This damaging equation 
is repellent to the conscience, and causes merit to complain; for, 
although it may be the duty of the strong to aid the weak, they prefer to 
do it out of generosity, &mdash; they never will endure a comparison.  Give 
them equal opportunities of labor, and equal wages, but never allow their 
jealousy to be awakened by mutual suspicion of unfaithfulness in the 
performance of the common task. 
</p> 
<p>Communism is oppression and slavery.  Man is very willing to 
obey the law of duty, serve his country, and oblige his friends; but he 
wishes to labor when he pleases, where he pleases, and as much as he 
pleases.  He wishes to dispose of his own time, to be governed only by 
necessity, to choose his friendships, his recreation, and his discipline; to 
act from judgment, not by command; to sacrifice himself through 
selfishness, not through servile obligation.  Communism is essentially 
opposed to the free exercise of our faculties, to our noblest desires, to 
our deepest feelings.  Any plan which could be devised for reconciling it 
with the demands of the individual reason and will would end only in 
changing the  
 
<pb n="262"/>  
thing while preserving the name.  Now, if we are honest truth-seekers, 
we shall avoid disputes about words. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, communism violates the sovereignty of the conscience, and 
equality: the first, by restricting spontaneity of mind and heart, and 
freedom of thought and action; the second, by placing labor and laziness, 
skill and stupidity, and even vice and virtue on an equality in point of 
comfort.  For the rest, if property is impossible on account of the desire 
to accumulate, communism would soon become so through the desire to 
shirk. 
</p> 
<p>II. Property, in its turn, violates equality by the rights of exclusion 
and increase, and freedom by despotism.  The former effect of property 
having been sufficiently developed in the last three chapters, I will 
content myself here with establishing by a final comparison, its perfect 
identity with robbery. 
</p> 
<p>The Latin words for robber are <hi rend="italic">fur</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">latro;</hi> the former taken from the Greek  
<foreign lang="grk"> for</foreign>, from GREEK &iacute;&thorn;&thorn;&thorn; or 
<foreign lang="grk"> fhrw</foreign>, Latin <hi rend="italic">fero</hi>, I 
carry away; the latter from <foreign lang="grk"> 
laqrw</foreign>, I play the part of a brigand, which is derived from 
<foreign lang="grk"> lhqw</foreign>, Latin <hi rend="italic">lateo</hi>, 
I conceal myself.  The Greeks have also <foreign lang="grk"> 
klepths</foreign>, from <foreign lang="grk"> 
kleptw</foreign>, I filch, whose radical consonants are the same as 
those of <foreign lang="grk"> kalnptw</foreign>, I cover, I 
conceal.  Thus, in these languages, the idea of a robber is that of a man 
who conceals, carries away, or diverts, in any manner whatever, a thing 
which does not belong to him. 
</p> 
<p>The Hebrews expressed the same idea by the word 
<hi rend="italic">gannab</hi>, &mdash; robber, &mdash; from the verb <hi rend="italic">ganab</hi>, 
which means to put away, to turn aside: <hi rend="italic">lo thi-gnob (Decalogue: 
Eighth Commandment</hi>), thou shalt not steal, &mdash; that is, thou shalt 
not hold back, thou shalt not put away any thing for thyself.  That is the 
act of a man who, on entering into a society into which he agrees to  
 
<pb n="263"/>  
bring all that he has, secretly reserves a portion, as did the celebrated 
disciple Ananias. 
</p> 
<p>The etymology of the French verb <hi rend="italic">voler</hi> is still more 
significant.  <hi rend="italic">Voler</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">faire la vole</hi> (from the 
Latin <hi rend="italic">vola</hi>, palm of the hand), means to take all the tricks 
in a game of ombre; so that <hi rend="italic">le voleur</hi>, the robber, is the 
capitalist who takes all, who gets the lion's share.  Probably this verb 
<hi rend="italic">voler</hi> had its origin in the professional slang of thieves, 
whence it has passed into common use, and, consequently into the 
phraseology of the law. 
</p> 
<p>Robbery is committed in a variety of ways, which have been very 
cleverly distinguished and classified by legislators according to their 
heinousness or merit, to the end that some robbers may be honored, 
while others are punished. 
</p> 
<p>We rob, &mdash; 1. By murder on the highway; 2. Alone, or in a band; 
3. By breaking into buildings, or scaling walls; 4. By abstraction; 5. By 
fraudulent bankruptcy; 6. By forgery of the handwriting of public 
officials or private individuals; 7. By manufacture of counterfeit money. 
</p> 
<p>This species includes all robbers who practise their profession with 
no other aid than force and open fraud.  Bandits, brigands, pirates, 
rovers by land and sea, &mdash; these names were gloried in by the ancient 
heroes, who thought their profession as noble as it was lucrative.  
Nimrod, Theseus, Jason and his Argonauts; Jephthah, David, Cacus, 
Romulus, Clovis and all his Merovingian descendants; Robert Guiscard, 
Tancred de Hauteville, Bohemond, and most of the Norman heroes, &mdash;  
were brigands and robbers.  The heroic character of the robber is 
expressed in this line from Horace, in reference to Achilles, &mdash;  
 
<hi rend="italic">        &ldquo;Jura neget sibi nata, nihil non arroget 
armis</hi>,&rdquo;[1] 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;My right is my lance and my buckler.&rdquo;  General de 
Brossard said, like Achilles:  &ldquo;I get wine, gold, and women with 
my lance and my buckler.&rdquo; 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="264"/>  
and by this sentence from the dying words of Jacob (Gen. xlviii.), which 
the Jews apply to David, and the Christians to their Christ:  
<hi rend="italic">Manus ejus contra omnes</hi>.  In our day, the robber &mdash; the 
warrior of the ancients &mdash; is pursued with the utmost vigor.  His 
profession, in the language of the code, entails ignominious and corporal 
penalties, from imprisonment to the scaffold.  A sad change in opinions 
here below! 
</p> 
<p>We rob, &mdash; 8. By cheating; 9. By swindling; 10. By abuse of trust; 
11. By games and lotteries. 
</p> 
<p>This second species was encouraged by the laws of Lycurgus, in 
order to sharpen the wits of the young.  It is the kind practised by 
Ulysses, Solon, and Sinon; by the ancient and modern Jews, from Jacob 
down to Deutz; and by the Bohemians, the Arabs, and all savage tribes.  
Under Louis XIII. and Louis XIV., it was not considered dishonorable to 
cheat at play.  To do so was a part of the game; and many worthy 
people did not scruple to correct the caprice of Fortune by dexterous 
jugglery.  To-day even, and in all countries, it is thought a mark of 
merit among peasants, merchants, and shopkeepers to <hi rend="italic">know how 
to make a bargain</hi>, &mdash; that is, to deceive one's man.  This is so 
universally accepted, that the cheated party takes no offence.  It is 
known with what reluctance our government resolved upon the abolition 
of lotteries.  It felt that it was dealing a stab thereby at property.  The 
pickpocket, the blackleg, and the charlatan make especial use of their 
dexterity of hand, their subtlety of mind, the magic power of their 
eloquence, and their great fertility of invention.  Sometimes they offer 
bait to cupidity.  Therefore the penal code &mdash; which much prefers 
intelligence to muscular vigor &mdash; has made, of the four varieties 
mentioned above, a second category, liable only to correctional, not to 
Ignominious, punishments.

<p>Let them now accuse the law of being materialistic and atheistic. 
</p> 
<p>We rob, &mdash; 12. By usury. 
</p> 
<p>This species of robbery, so odious and so severely punished since 
the publication of the Gospel, is the connecting link between forbidden 
and authorized robbery.  Owing to its ambiguous nature, it has given rise 
to a multitude of contradictions in the laws and in morals, &mdash; 
contradictions which have been very cleverly turned to account by 
lawyers, financiers, and merchants.  Thus the usurer, who lends on 
mortgage at ten, twelve, and fifteen per cent., is heavily fined when 
detected; while the banker, who receives the same interest (not, it is 
true, upon a loan, but in the way of exchange or discount, &mdash; that is, of 
sale), is protected by royal privilege.  But the distinction between the 
banker and the usurer is a purely nominal one.  Like the usurer, who 
lends on property, real or personal, the banker lends on business paper; 
like the usurer, he takes his interest in advance; like the usurer, he can 
recover from the borrower if the property is destroyed (that is, if the 
note is not redeemed), &mdash; a circumstance which makes him a money-lender, not a money-seller.  But the banker lends for a short time only, 
while the usurer's loan may be for one, two, three, or more years.  
Now, a difference in the duration of the loan, or the form of the act, 
does not alter the nature of the transaction.  As for the capitalists who 
invest their money, either with the State or in commercial operations, at 
three, four, and five per cent., &mdash; that is, who lend on usury at a little 
lower rate than the bankers and usurers, &mdash; they are the flower of society, 
the cream of honesty!  Moderation in robbery is the height of virtue![1] 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] It would be interesting and profitable to review the authors who 
have written on usury, or, to use the gentler expression which some 
prefer, lending

<p>We rob, &mdash; 13. By farm-rent, house-rent, and leases of all kinds.

<p>The author of the &ldquo;Provincial Letters&rdquo; entertained 
the honest Christians of the seventeenth century at the expense of 
Escobar, the Jesuit, and the contract <hi rend="italic">Mohatra</hi>.&rdquo;  
The contract <hi rend="italic">Mohatra</hi>,&rdquo; said Escobar, &ldquo;is a 
contract by which goods are bought, at a high price and on credit, to be 
again sold at the same moment to the same person, cash down, and at a 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued] <lb/> 
at interest.  The theologians always have opposed usury; but, since they 
have admitted always the legitimacy of rent, and since rent is evidently 
identical with interest, they have lost themselves in a labyrinth of subtle 
distinctions, and have finally reached a pass where they do not know 
what to think of usury.  The Church &mdash; the teacher of morality, so 
jealous and so proud of the purity of her doctrine &mdash; has always been 
ignorant of the real nature of property and usury.  She even has 
proclaimed through her pontiffs the most deplorable errors.  <hi rend="italic">Non 
potest mutuum</hi>, said Benedict XIV., <hi rend="italic">locationi ullo pacto 
comparari</hi>.  &ldquo;Rent,&rdquo; says Bossuet, &ldquo;is as 
far from usury as heaven is from the earth.&rdquo;  How, on [sic]  such 
a doctrine, condemn lending at interest? how justify the Gospel, which 
expressly forbids usury?  The difficulty of theologians is a very serious 
one.  Unable to refute the economical demonstrations, which rightly 
assimilate interest to rent, they no longer dare to condemn interest, and 
they can say only that there must be such a thing as usury, since the 
Gospel forbids it.  But what, then, is usury?  Nothing is more amusing 
than to see these <hi rend="italic">instructors of nations</hi> hesitate between the 
authority of the Gospel, which, they say, <hi rend="italic">never can have spoken 
in vain</hi>, and the authority of economical demonstrations.  
Nothing, to my mind, is more creditable to the Gospel than this old 
infidelity of its pretended teachers.  Salmasius, having assimilated 
interest to rent, was <hi rend="italic">refuted</hi> by Grotius, Pufendorf, 
Burlamaqui, Wolf, and Heineccius; and, what is more curious still, 
Salmasius <hi rend="italic">admitted his error</hi>.  Instead of inferring from 
this doctrine of Salmasius that all increase is illegitimate, and proceeding 
straight on to the demonstration of Gospel equality, they arrived at just 
the opposite conclusion; namely, that since everybody acknowledges that 
rent is permissible, if we allow that interest does not differ from rent, 
there is nothing left which can be called usury.  and, consequently, that 
the commandment of Jesus Christ is an <hi rend="italic">illusion</hi>, and 
amounts to <hi rend="italic">nothing</hi>, which is an impious conclusion. 
</p> 
<p>If this memoir had appeared in the time of Bossuet, that great 
theologian would have <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> by scripture, the fathers, 
traditions, councils, and popes, that property exists by Divine right, 
while usury is an invention of the devil; and the heretical work would 
have been burned, and the author imprisoned.<lb/>

lower price.&rdquo;  Escobar found a way to justify this kind of usury.  
Pascal and all the Jansenists laughed at him.  But what would the 
satirical Pascal, the learned Nicole, and the invincible Arnaud have said, 
if Father Antoine Escobar de Valladolid had answered them thus:  
&ldquo;A lease is a contract by which real estate is bought, at a high 
price and on credit, to be again sold, at the expiration of a certain time, 
to the same person, at a lower price; only, to simplify the transaction, 
the buyer is content to pay the difference between the first sale and the 
second.  Either deny the identity of the lease and the contract 
<hi rend="italic">Mohatra</hi>, and then I will annihilate you in a moment; or, if 
you admit the similarity, admit also the soundness of my doctrine:  
otherwise you proscribe both interest and rent at one blow&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>In reply to this overwhelming argument of the Jesuit, the sire of 
Montalte would have sounded the tocsin, and would have shouted that 
society was in peril, &mdash; that the Jesuits were sapping its very foundations. 
</p> 
<p>We rob, &mdash; 14. By commerce, when the profit of the merchant 
exceeds his legitimate salary. 
</p> 
<p>Everybody knows the definition of commerce &mdash; <hi rend="italic">The art of 
buying for three francs that which is worth six, and of selling for six that 
which is worth three</hi>.  Between commerce thus defined and 
<hi rend="italic">vol a l'americaine</hi>, the only difference is in the relative 
proportion of the values exchanged, &mdash; in short, in the amount of the 
profit. 
</p> 
<p>We rob, &mdash; 15. By making profit on our product, by accepting 
sinecures, and by exacting exorbitant wages. 
</p> 
<p>The farmer, who sells a certain amount of corn to the consumer, 
and who during the measurement thrusts his hand into the bushel and 
takes out a handful of grains, robs; the professor, whose lectures are 
paid for by the State, and who  
 
<pb n="268"/>  
through the intervention of a bookseller sells them to the public a second 
time, robs; the sinecurist, who receives an enormous product in 
exchange for his vanity, robs; the functionary, the laborer, whatever he 
may be, who produces only one and gets paid four, one hundred, or one 
thousand, robs; the publisher of this book, and I, its author, &mdash; we rob, 
by charging for it twice as much as it is worth. 
</p> 
<p>In recapitulation: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>Justice, after passing through the state of negative communism, 
called by the ancient poets the <hi rend="italic">age of gold</hi>, commences as 
the right of the strongest.  In a society which is trying to organize itself, 
inequality of faculties calls up the idea of merit; 
<hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> suggests the plan of proportioning 
not only esteem, but also material comforts, to personal merit; and since 
the highest and almost the only merit then recognized is physical 
strength, the strongest, <foreign lang="grk"> apistos</foreign>, 
and consequently the best, <foreign lang="grk"> 
apistos</foreign>, is entitled to the largest share; and if it is refused 
him, he very naturally takes it by force.  From this to the assumption of 
the right of property in all things, it is but one step. 
</p> 
<p>Such was justice in the heroic age, preserved, at least by tradition, 
among the Greeks and Romans down to the last days of their republics.  
Plato, in the &ldquo;Gorgias,&rdquo; introduces a character named 
Callicles, who spiritedly defends the right of the strongest, which 
Socrates, the advocate of equality, <foreign lang="grk"> ton 
ison</foreign>, seriously refutes.  It is related of the great Pompey, 
that he blushed easily, and, nevertheless, these words once escaped his 
lips:  &ldquo;Why should I respect the laws, when I have arms in my 
hand?&rdquo;  This shows him to have been a man in whom the moral 
sense and ambition were struggling for the mastery, and who sought to 
justify his violence by the motto of the hero and the brigand. 
 
 
<pb n="269"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>From the right of the strongest springs the exploitation of man by 
man, or bondage; usury, or the tribute levied upon the conquered by the 
conqueror; and the whole numerous family of taxes, duties, monarchical 
prerogatives, house-rents, farm-rents, &amp;c.; in one word, &mdash; property. 
</p> 
<p>Force was followed by artifice, the second manifestation of justice, 
which was detested by the ancient heroes, who, not excelling in that 
direction, were heavy losers by it.  Force was still employed, but mental 
force instead of physical.  Skill in deceiving an enemy by treacherous 
propositions seemed deserving of reward; nevertheless, the strong always 
prided themselves upon their honesty.  In those days, oaths were 
observed and promises kept according to the letter rather than the spirit:  
<hi rend="italic">Uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto</hi>, &mdash; &ldquo;As the 
tongue has spoken, so must the right be,&rdquo; says the law of the 
Twelve Tables.  Artifice, or rather perfidy, was the main element in the 
politics of ancient Rome.  Among other examples, Vico cites the 
following, also quoted by Montesquieu:  The Romans had guaranteed to 
the Carthaginians the preservation of their goods and their 
<hi rend="italic">city</hi>, &mdash; intentionally using the word <hi rend="italic">civitas</hi>, 
that is, the society, the State; the Carthaginians, on the contrary, 
understood them to mean the material city, <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi>, and 
accordingly began to rebuild their walls.  They were immediately 
attacked on account of their violation of the treaty, by the Romans, who, 
acting upon the old heroic idea of right, did not imagine that, in taking 
advantage of an equivocation to surprise their enemies, they were waging 
unjust war. 
</p> 
<p>From artifice sprang the profits of manufactures, commerce, and 
banking, mercantile frauds, and pretensions which are honored with the 
beautiful names of <hi rend="italic">talent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">genius</hi>, but 
which ought to be regarded as the last degree of knavery and deception; 
and, finally, all sorts of social inequalities. 
 
 
<pb n="270"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>In those forms of robbery which are prohibited by law, force and 
artifice are employed alone and undisguised; in the authorized forms, 
they conceal themselves within a useful product, which they use as a tool 
to plunder their victim. 
</p> 
<p>The direct use of violence and stratagem was early and universally 
condemned; but no nation has yet got rid of that kind of robbery which 
acts through talent, labor, and possession, and which is the source of all 
the dilemmas of casuistry and the innumerable contradictions of 
jurisprudence. 
</p> 
<p>The right of force and the right of artifice &mdash; glorified by the 
rhapsodists in the poems of the &ldquo;Iliad&rdquo; and the 
&ldquo;Odyssey&rdquo; &mdash; inspired the legislation of the Greeks and 
Romans, from which they passed into our morals and codes.  
Christianity has not changed at all.  The Gospel should not be blamed, 
because the priests, as stupid as the legists, have been unable either to 
expound or to understand it.  The ignorance of councils and popes upon 
all questions of morality is equal to that of the market-place and the 
money-changers; and it is this utter ignorance of right, justice, and 
society, which is killing the Church, and discrediting its teachings for 
ever.  The infidelity of the Roman church and other Christian churches 
is flagrant; all have disregarded the precept of Jesus; all have erred in 
moral and doctrinal points; all are guilty of teaching false and absurd 
dogmas, which lead straight to wickedness and murder.  Let it ask 
pardon of God and men, &mdash; this church which called itself infallible, and 
which has grown so corrupt in morals; let its reformed sisters humble 
themselves, . . .  and the people, undeceived, but still religious and 
merciful, will begin to think.[1] 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;I preach the Gospel, I live by the Gospel,&rdquo; said the 
Apostle; meaning thereby that he lived by his labor.  The Catholic clergy 
prefer to live by prop- 
 
 
 
<pb n="271"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>The development of right has followed the same order, in its 
various expressions, that property has in its forms.  Every where we see 
justice driving robbery before it and confining it within narrower and 
narrower limits.  Hitherto the victories of justice over injustice, and of 
equality over inequality, have been won by instinct and the simple force 
of things; but the final triumph of our social nature will be due to our 
reason, or else we shall fall back into feudal chaos.  Either this glorious 
height is reserved for our intelligence, or this miserable depth for our 
baseness. 
</p> 
<p>The second effect of property is despotism.  Now, since despotism 
is inseparably connected with the idea of legitimate authority, in 
explaining the natural causes of the first, the principle of the second will 
appear. 
</p> 
<p>What is to be the form of government in the future? hear some of 
my younger readers reply:  &ldquo;Why, how can you ask such a 
question?  You are a republican.&rdquo;  &ldquo;A republican!  Yes; 
but that word specifies nothing.  <hi rend="italic">Res publica;</hi> that is, the 
public thing.  Now, whoever is interested in public affairs &mdash; no matter 
under what form of government &mdash; may call himself a republican.  Even 
kings are republicans.&rdquo; &mdash;

erty.  The struggles in the communes of the middle ages between the 
priests and bishops and the large proprietors and seigneurs are famous.  
The papal excommunications fulminated in defence of ecclesiastical 
revenues are no less so.  Even to-day, the official organs of the Gallican 
clergy still maintain that the pay received by the clergy is not a salary, 
but an indemnity for goods of which they were once proprietors, and 
which were taken from them in '89 by the Third Estate.  The clergy 
prefer to live by the right of increase rather than by labor. 
</p> 
<p>One of the main causes of Ireland's poverty to-day is the immense 
revenues of the English clergy.  So heretics and orthodox &mdash; Protestants 
and Papists &mdash; cannot reproach each other.  All have strayed from the 
path of justice; all have disobeyed the eighth commandment of the 
Decalogue:  &ldquo;Thou shalt not steal.&rdquo;

</p> 
<p>In all species of sociable animals, &ldquo;the weakness of the 
young is the principle of their obedience to the old, who are strong; and 
from habit, which is a kind of conscience with them, the power remains 
with the oldest, although he finally becomes the weakest.  Whenever the 
society is under the control of a chief, this chief is almost always the 
oldest of the troop.  I say almost always, because the established order 
may be disturbed by violent outbreaks.  Then the authority passes to 
another; and, having been re-established by force, it is again maintained 
by habit.  Wild horses go in herds: they have a chief who marches at 
their head, whom they confidently follow, and who gives the signal for 
flight or battle. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The sheep which we have raised follows us, but it follows 
in company with the flock in the midst of which it was born.  It regards 
man <hi rend="italic">as the chief of its flock</hi>. . . .  Man is regarded by 
domestic animals as a member of their society.  All that he has to do is 
to get himself accepted by them as an associate: he soon becomes their 
chief, in consequence of his superior intelligence.  He does not, then, 
change the <hi rend="italic">natural condition</hi> of these animals, as Buffon 
has said.  On the contrary, he uses this natural condition to his own 
advantage; in other words, he finds <hi rend="italic">sociable</hi> animals, and 
renders them <hi rend="italic">domestic</hi> by becoming their associate and 
chief.  Thus, the <hi rend="italic">domesticity</hi> of animals is only a special 
condition, a simple modification, a definitive consequence of their 
<hi rend="italic">sociability</hi>.  All domestic animals are by nature sociable 
animals.&rdquo; . . . &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Flourens:  Summary of the Observations 
of F. Cuvier</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Sociable animals follow their chief by <hi rend="italic">instinct;</hi> but 
take notice of the fact (which F. Cuvier omitted to state), that  
 
<pb n="273"/>  
the function of the chief is altogether one of <hi rend="italic">intelligence</hi>.  
The chief does not teach the others to associate, to unite under his lead, 
to reproduce their kind, to take to flight, or to defend themselves.  
Concerning each of these particulars, his subordinates are as well 
informed as he.  But it is the chief who, by his accumulated experience, 
provides against accidents; he it is whose private intelligence 
supplements, in difficult situations, the general instinct; he it is who 
deliberates, decides, and leads; he it is, in short, whose enlightened 
prudence regulates the public routine for the greatest good of all. 
</p> 
<p>Man (naturally a sociable being) naturally follows a chief.  
Originally, the chief is the father, the patriarch, the elder; in other 
words, the good and wise man, whose functions, consequently, are 
exclusively of a reflective and intellectual nature.  The human race &mdash; 
like all other races of sociable animals &mdash; has its instincts, its innate 
faculties, its general ideas, and its categories of sentiment and reason.  
Its chiefs, legislators, or kings have devised nothing, supposed nothing, 
imagined nothing.  They have only guided society by their accumulated 
experience, always however in conformity with opinions and beliefs. 
</p> 
<p>Those philosophers who (carrying into morals and into history 
their gloomy and factious whims) affirm that the human race had 
originally neither chiefs nor kings, know nothing of the nature of man.  
Royalty, and absolute royalty, is &mdash; as truly and more truly than 
democracy &mdash; a primitive form of government.  Perceiving that, in the 
remotest ages, crowns and kingships were worn by heroes, brigands, and 
knight-errants, they confound the two things, &mdash; royalty and despotism.  
But royalty dates from the creation of man; it existed in the age of 
negative communism.  Ancient heroism (and  
 
<pb n="274"/>  
the despotism which it engendered) commenced only with the first 
manifestation of the idea of justice; that is, with the reign of force.  As 
soon as the strongest, in the comparison of merits, was decided to be the 
best, the oldest had to abandon his position, and royalty became 
despotic. 
</p> 
<p>The spontaneous, instinctive, and &mdash; so to speak &mdash; physiological 
origin of royalty gives it, in the beginning, a superhuman character.  The 
nations connected it with the gods, from whom they said the first kings 
descended.  This notion was the origin of the divine genealogies of royal 
families, the incarnations of gods, and the messianic fables.  From it 
sprang the doctrine of divine right, which is still championed by a few 
singular characters. 
</p> 
<p>Royalty was at first elective, because &mdash; at a time when man 
produced but little and possessed nothing &mdash; property was too weak to 
establish the principle of heredity, and secure to the son the throne of his 
father; but as soon as fields were cleared, and cities built, each function 
was, like every thing else, appropriated, and hereditary kingships and 
priesthoods were the result.  The principle of heredity was carried into 
even the most ordinary professions, &mdash; a circumstance which led to class 
distinctions, pride of station, and abjection of the common people, and 
which confirms my assertion, concerning the principle of patrimonial 
succession, that it is a method suggested by Nature of filling vacancies in 
business, and completing unfinished tasks. 
</p> 
<p>From time to time, ambition caused usurpers, or 
<hi rend="italic">supplanters</hi> of kings, to start up; and, in consequence, 
some were called kings by right, or legitimate kings, and others 
<hi rend="italic">tyrants</hi>.  But we must not let these names deceive us.  
There have been execrable kings, and very tolerable tyrants.  Royalty 
may always be good, when it is the only possible form of  
 
<pb n="275"/>  
government; legitimate it is never.  Neither heredity, nor election, nor 
universal suffrage, nor the excellence of the sovereign, nor the 
consecration of religion and of time, can make royalty legitimate.  
Whatever form it takes, &mdash; monarchic, oligarchic, or democratic, &mdash; 
royalty, or the government of man by man, is illegitimate and absurd. 
</p> 
<p>Man, in order to procure as speedily as possible the most thorough 
satisfaction of his wants, seeks <hi rend="italic">rule</hi>.  In the beginning, this 
rule is to him living, visible, and tangible.  It is his father, his master, 
his king.  The more ignorant man is, the more obedient he is, and the 
more absolute is his confidence in his guide.  But, it being a law of 
man's nature to conform to rule, &mdash; that is, to discover it by his powers 
of reflection and reason, &mdash; man reasons upon the commands of his 
chiefs.  Now, such reasoning as that is a protest against authority, &mdash; a 
beginning of disobedience.  At the moment that man inquires into the 
motives which govern the will of his sovereign, &mdash; at that moment man 
revolts.  If he obeys no longer because the king commands, but because 
the king demonstrates the wisdom of his commands, it may be said that 
henceforth he will recognize no authority, and that he has become his 
own king.  Unhappy he who shall dare to command him, and shall offer, 
as his authority, only the vote of the majority; for, sooner or later, the 
minority will become the majority, and this imprudent despot will be 
overthrown, and all his laws annihilated. 
</p> 
<p>In proportion as society becomes enlightened, royal authority 
diminishes.  That is a fact to which all history bears witness.  At the 
birth of nations, men reflect and reason in vain.  Without methods, 
without principles, not knowing how to use their reason, they cannot 
judge of the justice of their conclusions.  Then the authority of kings is 
immense, no  
 
<pb n="276"/>  
knowledge having been acquired with which to contradict it.  But, little 
by little, experience produces habits, which develop into customs; then 
the customs are formulated in maxims, laid down as principles, &mdash; in 
short, transformed into laws, to which the king, the living law, has to 
bow.  There comes a time when customs and laws are so numerous that 
the will of the prince is, so to speak, entwined by the public will; and 
that, on taking the crown, he is obliged to swear that he will govern in 
conformity with established customs and usages; and that he is but the 
executive power of a society whose laws are made independently of him. 
</p> 
<p>Up to this point, all is done instinctively, and, as it were, 
unconsciously; but see where this movement must end. 
</p> 
<p>By means of self-instruction and the acquisition of ideas, man 
finally acquires the idea of <hi rend="italic">science</hi>, &mdash; that is, of a system 
of knowledge in harmony with the reality of things, and inferred from 
observation.  He searches for the science, or the system, of inanimate 
bodies, &mdash; the system of organic bodies, the system of the human mind, 
and the system of the universe: why should he not also search for the 
system of society?  But, having reached this height, he comprehends that 
political truth, or the science of politics, exists quite independently of the 
will of sovereigns, the opinion of majorities, and popular beliefs, &mdash; that 
kings, ministers, magistrates, and nations, as wills, have no connection 
with the science, and are worthy of no consideration.  He comprehends, 
at the same time, that, if man is born a sociable being, the authority of 
his father over him ceases on the day when, his mind being formed and 
his education finished, he becomes the associate of his father; that his 
true chief and his king is the demonstrated truth; that politics is a 
science, not a stratagem; and that the function of the legislator is 
reduced, in the last analysis, to the methodical search for truth. 
 
 
<pb n="277"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Thus, in a given society, the authority of man over man is 
inversely proportional to the stage of intellectual development which that 
society has reached; and the probable duration of that authority can be 
calculated from the more or less general desire for a true government, &mdash; 
that is, for a scientific government.  And just as the right of force and 
the right of artifice retreat before the steady advance of justice, and must 
finally be extinguished in equality, so the sovereignty of the will yields 
to the sovereignty of the reason, and must at last be lost in scientific 
socialism.  Property and royalty have been crumbling to pieces ever 
since the world began.  As man seeks justice in equality, so society 
seeks order in anarchy. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Anarchy</hi>, &mdash; the absence of a master, of a 
sovereign,[1] &mdash; such is the form of government to which we are every 
day approximating, and which our accustomed habit of taking man for 
our rule, and his will for law, leads us to regard as the height of disorder 
and the expression of chaos.  The story is told, that a citizen of Paris in 
the seventeenth century having heard it said that in Venice there was no 
king, the good man could not recover from his astonishment, and nearly 
died from laughter at the mere mention of so ridiculous a thing.  So 
strong is our prejudice.  As long as we live, we want a chief or chiefs; 
and at this very moment I hold in my hand a <hi rend="italic">brochure</hi>, 
whose author &mdash; a zealous communist &mdash; dreams, like a second Marat, of 
the dictatorship.  The most advanced among us are those who wish the 
greatest possible number of sovereigns, &mdash; their most ardent wish is for 
the royalty of the National Guard.  Soon, undoubtedly, some one, 
jealous

&ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; is absence of principle, absence of rule;

of the citizen militia, will say, &ldquo;Everybody is king.&rdquo;  But, 
when he has spoken, I will say, in my turn, &ldquo;Nobody is king; we 
are, whether we will or no, associated.&rdquo;  Every question of 
domestic politics must be decided by departmental statistics; every 
question of foreign politics is an affair of international statistics.  The 
science of government rightly belongs to one of the sections of the 
Academy of Sciences, whose permanent secretary is necessarily prime 
minister; and, since every citizen may address a memoir to the 
Academy, every citizen is a legislator.  But, as the opinion of no one is 
of any value until its truth has been proven, no one can substitute his 
will for reason, &mdash; nobody is king. 
</p> 
<p>All questions of legislation and politics are matters of science, not 
of opinion.  The legislative power belongs only to the reason, 
methodically recognized and demonstrated.  To attribute to any power 
whatever the right of veto or of sanction, is the last degree of tyranny.  
Justice and legality are two things as independent of our approval as is 
mathematical truth.  To compel, they need only to be known; to be 
known, they need only to be considered and studied.  What, then, is the 
nation, if it is not the sovereign, &mdash; if it is not the source of the 
legislative power?  The nation is the guardian of the law &mdash; the nation is 
the <hi rend="italic">executive power</hi>.  Every citizen may assert:  
&ldquo;This is true; that is just; &ldquo;but his opinion controls no one 
but himself.  That the truth which he proclaims may become a law, it 
must be recognized.  Now, what is it to recognize a law?  It is to verify 
a mathematical or a metaphysical calculation; it is to repeat an 
experiment, to observe a phenomenon, to establish a fact.  Only the 
nation has the right to say, &ldquo;Be it known and decreed.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I confess that this is an overturning of received ideas, and that I 
seem to be attempting to revolutionize our political  
 
<pb n="279"/>  
system; but I beg the reader to consider that, having begun with a 
paradox, I must, if I reason correctly, meet with paradoxes at every step, 
and must end with paradoxes.  For the rest, I do not see how the liberty 
of citizens would be endangered by entrusting to their hands, instead of 
the pen of the legislator, the sword of the law.  The executive power, 
belonging properly to the will, cannot be confided to too many proxies.  
That is the true sovereignty of the nation.[1] 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor, the robber, the hero, the sovereign &mdash; for all these 
titles are synonymous &mdash; imposes his will as law, and suffers neither 
contradiction nor control; that is, he pretends to be the legislative and the 
executive power at once.  Accordingly, the substitution of the scientific 
and true law for the royal will is accomplished only by a terrible 
struggle; and this constant substitution is, after property, the most potent 
element in history, the most prolific source of political disturbances.  
Examples are too numerous and too striking to require enumeration. 
</p> 
<p>Now, property necessarily engenders despotism, &mdash; the government 
of caprice, the reign of libidinous pleasure.  That is so 
 
 
[1]  If such ideas are ever forced into the minds of the people, it will be 
by representative government and the tyranny of talkers.  Once science, 
thought, and speech were characterized by the same expression.  To 
designate a thoughtful and a learned man, they said, &ldquo;a man 
quick to speak and powerful in discourse.  &ldquo;For a long time, 
speech has been abstractly distinguished from science and reason.  
Gradually, this abstraction is becoming realized, as the logicians say, in 
society; so that we have to-day <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> of many kinds who 
talk but little, and <hi rend="italic">talkers</hi> who are not even 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi> in the science of speech.  Thus a philosopher is no 
longer a <hi rend="italic">savant:</hi> he is a talker.  Legislators and poets were 
once profound and sublime characters: now they are talkers.  A talker is 
a sonorous bell, whom the least shock suffices to set in perpetual motion.  
With the talker, the flow of speech is always directly proportional to the 
poverty of thought.  Talkers govern the world; they stun us, they bore 
us, they worry us, they suck our blood, and laugh at us.  As for the 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, they keep silence: if they wish to say a word, they 
are cut short.  Let them write. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="280"/>  
clearly the essence of property that, to be convinced of it, one need but 
remember what it is, and observe what happens around him.  Property is 
the right to <hi rend="italic">use</hi> and <hi rend="italic">abuse</hi>.  If, then, 
government is economy, &mdash; if its object is production and consumption, 
and the distribution of labor and products, &mdash; how is government possible 
while property exists?  And if goods are property, why should not the 
proprietors be kings, and despotic kings &mdash; kings in proportion to their 
<hi rend="italic">facult&eacute;s bonitaires</hi>?  And if each proprietor is 
sovereign lord within the sphere of his property, absolute king 
throughout his own domain, how could a government of proprietors be 
any thing but chaos and confusion? 
 
 
&sect; 3. &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Determination of the third form of Society.  
Conclusion</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Then, no government, no public economy, no administration, is 
possible, which is based upon property. 
</p> 
<p>Communism seeks <hi rend="italic">equality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">law</hi>.  
Property, born of the sovereignty of the reason, and the sense of 
personal merit, wishes above all things <hi rend="italic">independence</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">proportionality</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>But communism, mistaking uniformity for law, and levelism for 
equality, becomes tyrannical and unjust.  Property, by its despotism and 
encroachments, soon proves itself oppressive and anti-social. 
</p> 
<p>The objects of communism and property are good &mdash; their results 
are bad.  And why?  Because both are exclusive, and each disregards 
two elements of society.  Communism rejects independence and 
proportionality; property does not satisfy equality and law. 
</p> 
<p>Now, if we imagine a society based upon these four principles, &mdash; 
equality, law, independence, and proportionality, &mdash; we find: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>1. That <hi rend="italic">equality</hi>, consisting only in <hi rend="italic">equality of 
conditions</hi>,  
 
<pb n="281"/>  
that is, <hi rend="italic">of means</hi>, and not in <hi rend="italic">equality of 
comfort</hi>, &mdash; which it is the business of the laborers to achieve for 
themselves, when provided with equal means, &mdash; in no way violates 
justice and <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>2. That <hi rend="italic">law</hi>, resulting from the knowledge of facts, 
and consequently based upon necessity itself, never clashes with 
independence. 
</p> 
<p>3. That individual <hi rend="italic">independence</hi>, or the autonomy of 
the private reason, originating in the difference in talents and capacities, 
can exist without danger within the limits of the law. 
</p> 
<p>4. That <hi rend="italic">proportionality</hi>, being admitted only in the 
sphere of intelligence and sentiment, and not as regards material objects, 
may be observed without violating justice or social equality. 
</p> 
<p>This third form of society, the synthesis of communism and 
property, we will call <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi>.[1] 
</p> 
<p>In determining the nature of liberty, we do not unite communism 
and property indiscriminately; such a process would be absurd 
eclecticism.  We search by analysis for those elements in each which are 
true, and in harmony with the laws of Nature and society, disregarding 
the rest altogether; and the result gives us an adequate expression of the 
natural form of human society, &mdash; in one word, liberty. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is equality, because liberty exists only in society; and in 
the absence of equality there is no society. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is anarchy, because it does not admit the government of 
the will, but only the authority of the law; that is, of necessity. 
 
 
[1]  <hi rend="italic">libertas, librare, libratio, libra</hi>, &mdash; liberty, to liberate, 
libration, balance (pound), &mdash; words which have a common derivation.  
Liberty is the balance of rights and duties.  To make a man free is to 
balance him with others, &mdash; that is, to put him or their level. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="282"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is infinite variety, because it respects all wills within the 
limits of the law. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is proportionality, because it allows the utmost latitude to 
the ambition for merit, and the emulation of glory. 
</p> 
<p>We can now say, in the words of M. Cousin:  &ldquo;Our 
principle is true; it is good, it is social; let us not fear to push it to its 
ultimate.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Man's social nature becoming <hi rend="italic">justice</hi> through 
reflection, <hi rend="italic">&eacute;quit&eacute;</hi> through the classification 
of capacities, and having <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> for its formula, is the true 
basis of morality, &mdash; the principle and regulator of all our actions.  This 
is the universal motor, which philosophy is searching for, which religion 
strengthens, which egotism supplants, and whose place pure reason never 
can fill.  <hi rend="italic">Duty</hi> and <hi rend="italic">right</hi> are born of 
<hi rend="italic">need</hi>, which, when considered in connection with others, is 
a <hi rend="italic">right</hi>, and when considered in connection with ourselves, 
a <hi rend="italic">duty</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>We need to eat and sleep.  It is our right to procure those things 
which are necessary to rest and nourishment.  It is our duty to use them 
when Nature requires it. 
</p> 
<p>We need to labor in order to live.  To do so is both our right and 
our duty. 
</p> 
<p>We need to love our wives and children.  It is our duty to protect 
and support them.  It is our right to be loved in preference to all others.  
Conjugal fidelity is justice.  Adultery is high treason against society. 
</p> 
<p>We need to exchange our products for other products.  It is our 
right that this exchange should be one of equivalents; and since we 
consume before we produce, it would be our duty, if we could control 
the matter, to see to it that our last product shall follow our last 
consumption.  Suicide is fraudulent bankruptcy. 
 
 
<pb n="283"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>We need to live our lives according to the dictates of our reason.  
It is our right to maintain our freedom.  It is our duty to respect that of 
others. 
</p> 
<p>We need to be appreciated by our fellows.  It is our duty to 
deserve their praise.  It is our right to be judged by our works. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is not opposed to the rights of succession and bequest.  It 
contents itself with preventing violations of equality.  
&ldquo;Choose,&rdquo; it tells us, &ldquo;between two legacies, but 
do not take them both.&rdquo;  All our legislation concerning 
transmissions, entailments, adoptions, and, if I may venture to use such a 
word, <hi rend="italic">coadjutoreries</hi>, requires remodelling. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty favors emulation, instead of destroying it.  In social 
equality, emulation consists in accomplishing under like conditions; it is 
its own reward.  No one suffers by the victory. 
</p> 
<p>Liberty applauds self-sacrifice, and honors it with its votes, but it 
can dispense with it.  Justice alone suffices to maintain the social 
equilibrium.  Self-sacrifice is an act of supererogation.  Happy, however, 
the man who can say, &ldquo;I sacrifice myself.&rdquo;[1] 
 
 
[1]  In a monthly publication, the first number of which has just 
appeared under the name of &ldquo;L'Egalitaire,&rdquo; self-sacrifice 
is laid down as a principle of equality.  This is a confusion of ideas.  
Self-sacrifice, taken alone, is the last degree of inequality.  To seek 
equality in self-sacrifice is to confess that equality is against nature.  
Equality must be based upon justice, upon strict right, upon the 
principles invoked by the proprietor himself; otherwise it will never 
exist.  Self-sacrifice is superior to justice; but it cannot be imposed as 
law, because it is of such a nature as to admit of no reward.  It is, 
indeed, desirable that everybody shall recognize the necessity of self-sacrifice, and the idea of &ldquo;L'Egalitaire&rdquo; is an excellent 
example.  Unfortunately, it can have no effect.  What would you reply, 
indeed, to a man who should say to you, &ldquo;I do not want to 
sacrifice myself&rdquo;?  Is he to be compelled to do so?  When self-sacrifice is forced, it becomes oppression, slavery, the exploitation of 
man by man.  Thus have the proletaires sacrificed themselves to 
property. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="284"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Liberty is essentially an organizing force.  To insure equality 
between men and peace among nations, agriculture and industry, and the 
centres of education, business, and storage, must be distributed according 
to the climate and the geographical position of the country, the nature of 
the products, the character and natural talents of the inhabitants, &amp;c., in 
proportions so just, so wise, so harmonious, that in no place shall there 
ever be either an excess or a lack of population, consumption, and 
products.  There commences the science of public and private right, the 
true political economy.  It is for the writers on jurisprudence, henceforth 
unembarrassed by the false principle of property, to describe the new 
laws, and bring peace upon earth.  Knowledge and genius they do not 
lack; the foundation is now laid for them.[1] 
 
 
</p> 
<p>[1] The disciples of Fourier have long seemed to me the most 
advanced of all modern socialists, and almost the only ones worthy of 
the name.  If they had understood the nature of their task, spoken to the 
people, awakened their sympathies, and kept silence when they did not 
understand; if they had made less extravagant pretensions, and had 
shown more respect for public intelligence, &mdash; perhaps the reform would 
now, thanks to them, be in progress.  But why are these earnest 
reformers continually bowing to power and wealth, &mdash; that is, to all that 
is anti-reformatory?  How, in a thinking age, can they fail to see that the 
world must be converted by <hi rend="italic">demonstration</hi>, not by myths 
and allegories?  Why do they, the deadly enemies of civilization, borrow 
from it, nevertheless, its most pernicious fruits, &mdash; property, inequality of 
fortune and rank, gluttony, concubinage, prostitution, what do I know? 
theurgy, magic, and sorcery?  Why these endless denunciations of 
morality, metaphysics, and psychology, when the abuse of these 
sciences, which they do not understand, constitutes their whole system?  
Why this mania for deifying a man whose principal merit consisted in 
talking nonsense about things whose names, even, he did not know, in 
the strongest language ever put upon paper?  Whoever admits the 
infallibility of a man becomes thereby incapable of instructing others.  
Whoever denies his own reason will soon proscribe free thought.  The 
phalansterians would not fail to do it if they had the power.  Let them 
condescend to reason, let them proceed systematically, let them give us 
demonstrations instead of revelations, and we will listen willingly.  Then 
let them organize manufactures, agriculture, and commerce; let them 
make labor attractive, and the most 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="285"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>I have accomplished my task; property is conquered, never again 
to arise.  Wherever this work is read and discussed, there will be 
deposited the germ of death to property; there, sooner or later, privilege 
and servitude will disappear, and the despotism of will will give place to 
the reign of reason.  What sophisms, indeed, what prejudices (however 
obstinate) can stand before the simplicity of the following propositions: &mdash; 
 
</p> 
<p>I. Individual <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>[1] is the condition of social 
life; five thousand years of property demonstrate it.  
<hi rend="italic">Property</hi> is the suicide of society.  Possession is a right; 
property is against right.  Suppress property while maintaining 
possession, and, by this simple modification of the principle, you will 
revolutionize law, government, economy, and institutions; you will drive 
evil from the face of the earth. 
</p> 
<p>II. All having an equal right of occupancy, possession varies with 
the number of possessors; property cannot establish itself. 
</p> 
<p>III. The effect of labor being the same for all, property is lost in 
the common prosperity. 
</p> 
<p>IV. All human labor being the result of collective force, all 
property becomes, in consequence, collective and unitary.  To speak 
more exactly, labor destroys property. 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued]<lb/> 
humble functions honorable, and our praise shall be theirs.  Above all, 
let them throw off that Illuminism which gives them the appearance of 
impostors or dupes, rather than believers and apostles. 
 
[1]  Individual possession is no obstacle to extensive cultivation and unity 
of exploitation.  If I have not spoken of the drawbacks arising from 
small estates, it is because I thought it useless to repeat what so many 
others have said, and what by this time all the world must know.  But I 
am surprised that the economists, who have so clearly shown the 
disadvantages of spade-husbandry, have failed to see that it is caused 
entirely by property; above all, that they have not perceived that their 
plan for mobilizing the soil is a first step towards the abolition of 
property. 
 
<pb n="286"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>V. Every capacity for labor being, like every instrument of labor, 
an accumulated capital, and a collective property, inequality of wages 
and fortunes (on the ground of inequality of capacities) is, therefore, 
injustice and robbery. 
</p> 
<p>VI. The necessary conditions of commerce are the liberty of the 
contracting parties and the equivalence of the products exchanged.  Now, 
value being expressed by the amount of time and outlay which each 
product costs, and liberty being inviolable, the wages of laborers (like 
their rights and duties) should be equal. 
</p> 
<p>VII. Products are bought only by products.  Now, the condition of 
all exchange being equivalence of products, profit is impossible and 
unjust.  Observe this elementary principle of economy, and pauperism, 
luxury, oppression, vice, crime, and hunger will disappear from our 
midst. 
</p> 
<p>VIII. Men are associated by the physical and mathematical law of 
production, before they are voluntarily associated by choice.  Therefore, 
equality of conditions is demanded by justice; that is, by strict social 
law: esteem, friendship, gratitude, admiration, all fall within the domain 
of <hi rend="italic">equitable</hi> or <hi rend="italic">proportional</hi> law only. 
</p> 
<p>IX. Free association, liberty &mdash; whose sole function is to maintain 
equality in the means of production and equivalence in exchanges &mdash; is 
the only possible, the only just, the only true form of society. 
</p> 
<p>X. Politics is the science of liberty.  The government of man by 
man (under whatever name it be disguised) is oppression.  Society finds 
its highest perfection in the union of order with anarchy. 
</p> 
<p>The old civilization has run its race; a new sun is rising, and will 
soon renew the face of the earth.  Let the present generation perish, let 
the old prevaricators die in the desert!  
 
<pb n="287"/>  
the holy earth shall not cover their bones.  Young man, exasperated by 
the corruption of the age, and absorbed in your zeal for justice! &mdash; if 
your country is dear to you, and if you have the interests of humanity at 
heart, have the courage to espouse the cause of liberty!  Cast off your 
old selfishness, and plunge into the rising flood of popular equality!  
There your regenerate soul will acquire new life and vigor; your 
enervated genius will recover unconquerable energy; and your heart, 
perhaps already withered, will be rejuvenated!  Every thing will wear a 
different look to your illuminated vision; new sentiments will engender 
new ideas within you; religion, morality, poetry, art, language will 
appear before you in nobler and fairer forms; and thenceforth, sure of 
your faith, and thoughtfully enthusiastic, you will hail the dawn of 
universal regeneration! 
</p> 
<p>And you, sad victims of an odious law! &mdash; you, whom a jesting 
world despoils and outrages! &mdash; you, whose labor has always been 
fruitless, and whose rest has been without hope, &mdash; take courage! your 
tears are numbered!  The fathers have sown in affliction, the children 
shall reap in rejoicings! 
</p> 
<p>O God of liberty!  God of equality!  Thou who didst place in my 
heart the sentiment of justice, before my reason could comprehend it, 
hear my ardent prayer!  Thou hast dictated all that I have written; Thou 
hast shaped my thought; Thou hast directed my studies; Thou hast 
weaned my mind from curiosity and my heart from attachment, that I 
might publish Thy truth to the master and the slave.  I have spoken with 
what force and talent Thou hast given me: it is Thine to finish the work.  
Thou knowest whether I seek my welfare or Thy glory, O God of 
liberty!  Ah! perish my memory, and let humanity be free!  Let me see 
from my obscurity the people at last instructed; let noble teachers 
enlighten them;  
 
<pb n="288"/>  
let generous spirits guide them! Abridge, if possible, the time of our 
trial; stifle pride and avarice in equality; annihilate this love of glory 
which enslaves us; teach these poor children that in the bosom of liberty 
there are neither heroes nor great men!  Inspire the powerful man, the 
rich man, him whose name my lips shall never pronounce in Thy 
presence, with a horror of his crimes; let him be the first to apply for 
admission to the redeemed society; let the promptness of his repentance 
be the ground of his forgiveness!  Then, great and small, wise and 
foolish, rich and poor, will unite in an ineffable fraternity; and, singing 
in unison a new hymn, will rebuild Thy altar, O God of liberty and 
equality!

<head>A LETTER TO M. BLANQUI. 
<lb/> 
PARIS, April 1, 1841.</head> 
<p> 
MONSIEUR, &mdash;  
Before resuming my &ldquo;Inquiries into Government and 
Property,&rdquo; it is fitting, for the satisfaction of some worthy 
people, and also in the interest of order, that I should make to you a 
plain, straightforward explanation.  In a much-governed State, no one 
would be allowed to attack the external form of the society, and the 
groundwork of its institutions, until he had established his right to do so, 
&mdash; first, by his morality; second, by his capacity; and, third, by the 
purity of his intentions.  Any one who, wishing to publish a treatise upon 
the constitution of the country, could not satisfy this threefold condition, 
would be obliged to procure the endorsement of a responsible patron 
possessing the requisite qualifications. 
</p> 
<p>But we Frenchmen have the liberty of the press.  This grand right 
&mdash; the sword of thought, which elevates the virtuous citizen to the rank of 
legislator, and makes the malicious citizen an agent of discord &mdash; frees us 
from all preliminary responsibility to the law; but it does not release us 
from our internal obligation to render a public account of our sentiments 
and thoughts.  I have used, in all its fulness, and  
 
<pb n="292"/>  
concerning an important question, the right which the charter grants us.  
I come to-day, sir, to submit my conscience to your judgment, and my 
feeble insight to your discriminating reason.  You have criticised in a 
kindly spirit &mdash; I had almost said with partiality for the writer &mdash; a work 
which teaches a doctrine that you thought it your duty to condemn.  
&ldquo;The Academy of Moral and Political Sciences,&rdquo; said you 
in your report, &ldquo;can accept the conclusions of the author only as 
far as it likes.&rdquo;  I venture to hope, sir, that, after you have read 
this letter, if your prudence still restrains you, your fairness will induce 
you to do me justice. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Men, equal in the dignity of their persons and equal before 
the law, should be equal in their conditions</hi>, &mdash; such is the thesis 
which I maintained and developed in a memoir bearing the title, 
&ldquo;What is Property? or, An Inquiry into the Principle of Right and 
of Government.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The idea of social equality, even in individual fortunes, has in all 
ages besieged, like a vague presentiment, the human imagination.  Poets 
have sung of it in their hymns; philosophers have dreamed of it in their 
Utopias; priests teach it, but only for the spiritual world.  The people, 
governed by it, never have had faith in it; and the civil power is never 
more disturbed than by the fables of the age of gold and the reign of 
Astrea.  A year ago, however, this idea received a scientific 
demonstration, which has not yet been satisfactorily answered, and, 
permit me to add, never will be.  This demonstration, owing to its 
slightly impassioned style, its method of reasoning, &mdash; which was so at 
variance with that employed by the generally recognized authorities, &mdash; 
and the importance and novelty of its conclusions, was of a nature to 
cause some alarm; and might have been dangerous, had it not been &mdash; as 
you, sir, so well said &mdash; a sealed letter, so far as the general  
 
<pb n="293"/>  
public was concerned, addressed only to men of intelligence.  I was glad 
to see that through its metaphysical dress you recognized the wise 
foresight of the author; and I thank you for it.  May God grant that my 
intentions, which are wholly peaceful, may never be charged upon me as 
treasonable! 
</p> 
<p>Like a stone thrown into a mass of serpents, the First Memoir on 
Property excited intense animosity, and aroused the passions of many.  
But, while some wished the author and his work to be publicly 
denounced, others found in them simply the solution of the fundamental 
problems of society; a few even basing evil speculations upon the new 
light which they had obtained.  It was not to be expected that a system of 
inductions abstractly gathered together, and still more abstractly 
expressed, would be understood with equal accuracy in its 
<hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> and in each of its parts. 
</p> 
<p>To find the law of equality, no longer in charity and self-sacrifice 
(which are not binding in their nature), but in justice; to base equality of 
functions upon equality of persons; to determine the absolute principle of 
exchange; to neutralize the inequality of individual faculties by collective 
force; to establish an equation between property and robbery; to change 
the law of succession without destroying the principle; to maintain the 
human personality in a system of absolute association, and to save liberty 
from the chains of communism; to synthetize the monarchical and 
democratic forms of government; to reverse the division of powers; to 
give the executive power to the nation, and to make legislation a 
positive, fixed, and absolute science, &mdash; what a series of paradoxes! what 
a string of delusions! if I may not say, what a chain of truths!  But it is 
not my purpose here to pass upon the theory of the right of possession.  
I discuss no dogmas.  My only object is to justify my views, and to  
 
<pb n="294"/>  
show that, in writing as I did, I not only exercised a right, but performed 
a duty. 
</p> 
<p>Yes, I have attacked property, and shall attack it again; but, sir, 
before demanding that I shall make the <hi rend="italic">amende honorable</hi> 
for having obeyed my conscience and spoken the exact truth, 
condescend, I beg of you, to cast a glance at the events which are 
happening around us; look at our deputies, our magistrates, our 
philosophers, our ministers, our professors, and our publicists; examine 
their methods of dealing with the matter of property; count up with me 
the restrictions placed upon it every day in the name of the public 
welfare; measure the breaches already made; estimate those which 
society thinks of making hereafter; add the ideas concerning property 
held by all theories in common; interrogate history, and then tell me 
what will be left, half a century hence, of this old right of property; and, 
thus perceiving that I have so many accomplices, you will immediately 
declare me innocent. 
</p> 
<p>What is the law of expropriation on the ground of public utility, 
which everybody favors, and which is even thought too lenient?[1]  A 
flagrant violation of the right of property.  Society indemnifies, it is said, 
the dispossessed proprietor; but does it return to him the traditional 
associations, the poetic charm, and the family pride which accompany 
property?  Naboth, and the miller of Sans-Souci, would have protested 
against French law, as they protested against the caprice of their kings.  
&ldquo;It is the field of our fathers,&rdquo; they would have cried, 
&ldquo;and we will not sell it!&rdquo;  Among the ancients, the refusal 
of the individual limited the powers of

January, 1841, M. Dufaure moved to renew the expropriation bill, on 
the ground of public utility. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="295"/>  
the State.  The Roman law bowed to the will of the citizen, and an 
emperor &mdash; Commodus, if I remember rightly &mdash; abandoned the project of 
enlarging the forum out of respect for the rights of the occupants who 
refused to abdicate.  Property is a real right, <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> <hi rend="italic">in 
re</hi>, &mdash; a right inherent in the thing, and whose principle lies in the 
external manifestation of man's will.  Man leaves his imprint, stamps his 
character, upon the objects of his handiwork.  This plastic force of man, 
as the modern jurists say, is the seal which, set upon matter, makes it 
holy.  Whoever lays hands upon it, against the proprietor's will, does 
violence to the latter's personality.  And yet, when an administrative 
committee saw fit to declare that public utility required it, property had 
to give way to the general will.  Soon, in the name of public utility, 
methods of cultivation and conditions of enjoyment will be prescribed; 
inspectors of agriculture and manufactures will be appointed; property 
will be taken away from unskilful hands, and entrusted to laborers who 
are more deserving of it; and a general superintendence of production 
will be established.  It is not two years since I saw a proprietor destroy a 
forest more than five hundred acres in extent.  If public utility had 
interfered, that forest &mdash; the only one for miles around &mdash; would still be 
standing. 
</p> 
<p>But, it is said, expropriation on the ground of public utility is only 
an exception which confirms the principle, and bears testimony in favor 
of the right.  Very well; but from this exception we will pass to another, 
from that to a third, and so on from exceptions to exceptions, until we 
have reduced the rule to a pure abstraction. 
</p> 
<p>How many supporters do you think, sir, can be claimed for the 
project of the conversion of the public funds?  I venture to say that 
everybody favors it, except the fund-holders.   
 
<pb n="296"/>  
Now, this so-called conversion is an extensive expropriation, and in this 
case with no indemnity whatever.  The public funds are so much real 
estate, the income from which the proprietor counts upon with perfect 
safety, and which owes its value to the tacit promise of the government 
to pay interest upon it at the established rate, until the fund-holder 
applies for redemption.  For, if the income is liable to diminution, it is 
less profitable than house-rent or farm-rent, whose rates may rise or fall 
according to the fluctuations in the market; and in that case, what 
inducement has the capitalist to invest his money in the State?  When, 
then, you force the fund-holder to submit to a diminution of interest, you 
make him bankrupt to the extent of the diminution; and since, in 
consequence of the conversion, an equally profitable investment becomes 
impossible, you depreciate his property. 
</p> 
<p>That such a measure may be justly executed, it must be 
generalized; that is, the law which provides for it must decree also that 
interest on sums lent on deposit or on mortgage throughout the realm, as 
well as house and farm-rents, shall be reduced to three per cent.  This 
simultaneous reduction of all kinds of income would be not a whit more 
difficult to accomplish than the proposed conversion; and, further, it 
would offer the advantage of forestalling at one blow all objections to it, 
at the same time that it would insure a just assessment of the land-tax.  
See!  If at the moment of conversion a piece of real estate yields an 
income of one thousand francs, after the new law takes effect it will 
yield only six hundred francs.  Now, allowing the tax to be an aliquot 
part &mdash; one-fourth for example &mdash; of the income derived from each piece 
of property, it is clear on the one hand that the proprietor would not, in 
order to lighten his share of the tax, underestimate the value of his 
property; since, house and  
 
<pb n="297"/>  
farm-rents being fixed by the value of the capital, and the latter being 
measured by the tax, to depreciate his real estate would be to reduce his 
revenue.  On the other hand, it is equally evident that the same 
proprietors could not overestimate the value of their property, in order to 
increase their incomes beyond the limits of the law, since the tenants and 
farmers, with their old leases in their hands, would enter a protest. 
</p> 
<p>Such, sir, must be the result sooner or later of the conversion 
which has been so long demanded; otherwise, the financial operation of 
which we are speaking would be a crying injustice, unless intended as a 
stepping-stone.  This last motive seems the most plausible one; for in 
spite of the clamors of interested parties, and the flagrant violation of 
certain rights, the public conscience is bound to fulfil its desire, and is 
no more affected when charged with attacking property, than when 
listening to the complaints of the bondholders.  In this case, instinctive 
justice belies legal justice. 
</p> 
<p>Who has not heard of the inextricable confusion into which the 
Chamber of Deputies was thrown last year, while discussing the question 
of colonial and native sugars?  Did they leave these two industries to 
themselves?  The native manufacturer was ruined by the colonist.  To 
maintain the beet-root, the cane had to be taxed.  To protect the property 
of the one, it became necessary to violate the property of the other.  The 
most remarkable feature of this business was precisely that to which the 
least attention was paid; namely, that, in one way or another, property 
had to be violated.  Did they impose on each industry a proportional tax, 
so as to preserve a balance in the market?  They created a maximum 
<hi rend="italic">price</hi> for each variety of sugar; and, as this maximum 
<hi rend="italic">price</hi> was not the same, they attacked property in two 
ways, &mdash; on  
 
<pb n="298"/>  
the one hand, interfering with the liberty of trade; on the other, 
disregarding the equality of proprietors.  Did they suppress the beet-root 
by granting an indemnity to the manufacturer?  They sacrificed the 
property of the tax-payer.  Finally, did they prefer to cultivate the two 
varieties of sugar at the nation's expense, just as different varieties of 
tobacco are cultivated?  They abolished, so far as the sugar industry was 
concerned, the right of property.  This last course, being the most social, 
would have been certainly the best; but, if property is the necessary basis 
of civilization, how is this deep-seated antagonism to be explained?[1] 
</p> 
<p>Not satisfied with the power of dispossessing a citizen on the 
ground of public utility, they want also to dispossess him on the ground 
of <hi rend="italic">private utility</hi>.  For a long time, a revision of the law 
concerning mortgages was clamored for; a process was demanded, in 
behalf of all kinds of credit and in the interest of even the debtors 
themselves, which would render the expropriation of real estate as 
prompt, as easy, and as effective as that which follows a commercial 
protest.  The Chamber of Deputies, in the early part of this year, 1841, 
discussed this project, and the law was passed almost unanimously.  
There is nothing more just, nothing more reasonable, nothing more 
philosophical apparently, than the motives which gave rise to this 
reform. 
</p> 
<p>I. Formerly, the small proprietor whose obligation had arrived at 
maturity, and who found himself unable to meet it, had to employ all 
that he had left, after being released from his debt, in defraying the legal 
costs.  Henceforth, the promptness of expropriation will save him from 
total ruin.  2. The difficulties in the way of payment arrested credit, and 
 
 
[1] &ldquo;What is Property?&rdquo; Chap. IV., Ninth Proposition. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="299"/>  
prevented the employment of capital in agricultural enterprises.  This 
cause of distrust no longer existing, capitalists will find new markets, 
agriculture will rapidly develop, and farmers will be the first to enjoy the 
benefit of the new law.  3. Finally, it was iniquitous and absurd, that, on 
account of a protested note, a poor manufacturer should see in twenty-four hours his business arrested, his labor suspended, his merchandise 
seized, his machinery sold at auction, and finally himself led off to 
prison, while two years were sometimes necessary to expropriate the 
most miserable piece of real estate.  These arguments, and others 
besides, you clearly stated, sir, in your first lectures of this academic 
year. 
</p> 
<p>But, when stating these excellent arguments, did you ask yourself, 
sir, whither would tend such a transformation of our system of 
mortgages? . . .  To monetize, if I may say so, landed property; to 
accumulate it within portfolios; to separate the laborer from the soil, man 
from Nature; to make him a wanderer over the face of the earth; to 
eradicate from his heart every trace of family feeling, national pride, and 
love of country; to isolate him more and more; to render him indifferent 
to all around him; to concentrate his love upon one object, &mdash; money; 
and, finally, by the dishonest practices of usury, to monopolize the land 
to the profit of a financial aristocracy, &mdash; a worthy auxiliary of that 
industrial feudality whose pernicious influence we begin to feel so 
bitterly.  Thus, little by little, the subordination of the laborer to the 
idler, the restoration of abolished castes, and the distinction between 
patrician and plebeian, would be effected; thus, thanks to the new 
privileges granted to the property of the capitalists, that of the small and 
intermediate proprietors would gradually disappear, and with it the whole 
class of free and honest laborers.  This certainly is not my plan for the 
 
<pb n="300"/>  
abolition of property.  Far from mobilizing the soil, I would, if possible, 
immobilize even the functions of pure intelligence, so that society might 
be the fulfilment of the intentions of Nature, who gave us our first 
possession, the land.  For, if the instrument or capital of production is 
the mark of the laborer, it is also his pedestal, his support, his country, 
and, as the Psalmist says, <hi rend="italic">the place of his activity and his 
rest.</hi>[1] 
</p> 
<p>Let us examine more closely still the inevitable and approaching 
result of the last law concerning judicial sales and mortgages.  Under the 
system of competition which is killing us, and whose necessary 
expression is a plundering and tyrannical government, the farmer will 
need always capital in order to repair his losses, and will be forced to 
contract loans.  Always depending upon the future for the payment of his 
debts, he will be deceived in his hope, and surprised by maturity.  For 
what is there more prompt, more unexpected, more abbreviatory of 
space and time, than the maturity of an obligation?  I address this 
question to all whom this pitiless Nemesis pursues, and even troubles in 
their dreams.  Now, under the new law, the expropriation of a debtor 
will be effected a hundred times more rapidly; then, also, spoliation will 
be a hundred times surer, and the free laborer will pass a hundred times 
sooner from his present condition to that of a serf attached to the soil.  
Formerly, the length of time required to effect the seizure curbed the 
usurer's avidity, gave the borrower an opportunity to recover himself, 
and gave rise to a transaction between him and his creditor which might 
result finally in a complete release.  Now, the debtor's sentence is 
irrevocable: he has but a few days of grace. 
</p> 
<p>And what advantages are promised by this law as an offset 
 
 
[1]   <hi rend="italic">Tu cognovisti sessionem meam et resurrectionem 
meam</hi>.  Psalm 139. 
 
 
 
<pb n="301"/>  
to this sword of Damocles, suspended by a single hair over the head of 
the unfortunate husbandman?  The expenses of seizure will be much less, 
it is said; but will the interest on the borrowed capital be less exorbitant?  
For, after all, it is interest which impoverishes the peasant and leads to 
his expropriation.  That the law may be in harmony with its principle, 
that it may be truly inspired by that spirit of justice for which it is 
commended, it must &mdash; while facilitating expropriation &mdash; lower the legal 
price of money.  Otherwise, the reform concerning mortgages is but a 
trap set for small proprietors, &mdash; a legislative trick. 
</p> 
<p>Lower interest on money!  But, as we have just seen, that is to 
limit property.  Here, sir, you shall make your own defence.  More than 
once, in your learned lectures, I have heard you deplore the precipitancy 
of the Chambers, who, without previous study and without profound 
knowledge of the subject, voted almost unanimously to maintain the 
statutes and privileges of the Bank.  Now these privileges, these statutes, 
this vote of the Chambers, mean simply this, &mdash; that the market price of 
specie, at five or six per cent., is not too high, and that the conditions of 
exchange, discount, and circulation, which generally double this interest, 
are none too severe.  So the government thinks.  M. Blanqui &mdash; a 
professor of political economy, paid by the State &mdash; maintains the 
contrary, and pretends to demonstrate, by decisive arguments, the 
necessity of a reform.  Who, then, best understands the interests of 
property, &mdash; the State, or M. Blanqui? 
</p> 
<p>If specie could be borrowed at half the present rate, the revenues 
from all sorts of property would soon be reduced one-half also.  For 
example: when it costs less to build a house than to hire one, when it is 
cheaper to clear a field than to procure one already cleared, competition 
inevitably  
<pb n="302"/>  
leads to a reduction of house and farm-rents, since the surest way to 
depreciate active capital is to increase its amount.  But it is a law of 
political economy that an increase of production augments the mass of 
available capital, consequently tends to raise wages, and finally to 
annihilate interest.  Then, proprietors are interested in maintaining the 
statutes and privileges of the Bank; then, a reform in this matter would 
compromise the right of increase; then, the peers and deputies are better 
informed than Professor Blanqui. 
</p> 
<p>But these same deputies, &mdash; so jealous of their privileges whenever 
the equalizing effects of a reform are within their intellectual horizon, &mdash; 
what did they do a few days before they passed the law concerning 
judicial sales?  They formed a conspiracy against property!  Their law to 
regulate the labor of children in factories will, without doubt, prevent the 
manufacturer from compelling a child to labor more than so many hours 
a day; but it will not force him to increase the pay of the child, nor that 
of its father.  To-day, in the interest of health, we diminish the 
subsistence of the poor; to-morrow it will be necessary to protect them 
by fixing their <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> wages.  But to fix their minimum 
wages is to compel the proprietor, is to force the master to accept his 
workman as an associate, which interferes with freedom and makes 
mutual insurance obligatory.  Once entered upon this path, we never 
shall stop.  Little by little the government will become manufacturer, 
commission-merchant, and retail dealer.  It will be the sole proprietor.  
Why, at all epochs, have the ministers of State been so reluctant to 
meddle with the question of wages?  Why have they always refused to 
interfere between the master and the workman?  Because they knew the 
touchy and jealous nature of property, and, regarding it as the principle 
of all civilization, felt that to meddle  
<pb n="303"/>  
with it would be to unsettle the very foundations of society.  Sad 
condition of the proprietary <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;gime</hi>, &mdash; one of 
inability to exercise charity without violating justice![1] 
</p> 
<p>And, sir, this fatal consequence which necessity forces upon the 
State is no mere imagination.  Even now the legislative power is asked, 
no longer simply to regulate the government of factories, but to create 
factories itself.  Listen to the millions of voices shouting on all hands for 
<hi rend="italic">the organisation of labor, the creation of national 
workshops!</hi>  The whole laboring class is agitated: it has its 
journals, organs, and representatives.  To guarantee labor to the 
workingman, to balance production with sale, to harmonize industrial 
proprietors, it advocates to-day &mdash; as a sovereign remedy &mdash; one sole 
head, one national wardenship, one huge manufacturing company.  For, 
sir, all this is included in the idea of national workshops.  On this subject 
I wish to quote, as proof, the views of an illustrious economist, a 
brilliant mind, a progressive intellect, an enthusiastic soul, a true patriot, 
and yet an official defender of the right of property.[2] 
</p> 
<p>The honorable professor of the Conservatory proposes then, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">To check the continual emigration of laborers from the 
country into the cities</hi>. 
 
 
[1]  The emperor Nicholas has just compelled all the manufacturers in 
his empire to maintain, at their own expense, within their establishments, 
small hospitals for the reception of sick workmen, &mdash; the number of beds 
in each being proportional to the number of laborers in the factory.  
&ldquo;You profit by man's labor,&rdquo; the Czar could have said to 
his proprietors; &ldquo;you shall be responsible for man's life.&rdquo;  
M. Blanqui has said that such a measure could not succeed in France.  It 
would be an attack upon property, &mdash; a thing hardly conceivable even in 
Russia, Scythia, or among the Cossacks; but among us, the oldest sons 
of civilization! . . .  I fear very much that this quality of age may prove 
in the end a mark of decrepitude.

<pb n="304"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>But, to keep the peasant in his village, his residence there must be 
made endurable: to be just to all, the proletaire of the country must be 
treated as well as the proletaire of the city.  Reform is needed, then, on 
farms as well as in factories; and, when the government enters the 
workshop, the government must seize the plough!  What becomes, 
during this progressive invasion, of independent cultivation, exclusive 
domain, property? 
</p> 
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">To fix for each profession a moderate salary, varying 
with time and place and based upon certain data</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The object of this measure would be to secure to laborers their 
subsistence, and to proprietors their profits, while obliging the latter to 
sacrifice from motives of prudence, if for no other reason, a portion of 
their income.  Now, I say, that this portion, in the long run, would swell 
until at last there would be an equality of enjoyment between the 
proletaire and the proprietor.  For, as we have had occasion to remark 
several times already, the interest of the capitalist &mdash; in other words the 
increase of the idler &mdash; tends, on account of the power of labor, the 
multiplication of products and exchanges, to continually diminish, and, 
by constant reduction, to disappear.  So that, in the society proposed by 
M. Blanqui, equality would not be realized at first, but would exist 
potentially; since property, though outwardly seeming to be industrial 
feudality, being no longer a principle of exclusion and encroachment, but 
only a privilege of division, would not be slow, thanks to the intellectual 
and political emancipation of the proletariat, in passing into absolute 
equality, &mdash; as absolute at least as any thing can be on this earth. 
</p> 
<p>I omit, for the sake of brevity, the numerous considerations which 
the professor adduces in support of what he calls, too modestly in my 
opinion, his Utopia.  They would serve only  
<pb n="305"/>  
to prove beyond all question that, of all the charlatans of radicalism who 
fatigue the public ear, no one approaches, for depth and clearness of 
thought, the audacious M. Blanqui. 
</p> 
<p>3. <hi rend="italic">National workshops should be in operation only during 
periods of stagnation in ordinary industries; at such times they should be 
opened as vast outlets to the flood of the laboring population</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, the stoppage of private industry is the result of over-production, and insufficient markets.  If, then, production continues in 
the national workshops, how will the crisis be terminated?  Undoubtedly, 
by the general depreciation of merchandise, and, in the last analysis, by 
the conversion of private workshops into national workshops.  On the 
other hand, the government will need capital with which to pay its 
workmen; now, how will this capital be obtained?  By taxation.  And 
upon what will the tax be levied?  Upon property.  Then you will have 
proprietary industry sustaining against itself, and at its own expense, 
another industry with which it cannot compete.  What, think you, will 
become, in this fatal circle, of the possibility of profit, &mdash; in a word, of 
property? 
</p> 
<p>Thank Heaven! equality of conditions is taught in the public 
schools; let us fear revolutions no longer.  The most implacable enemy 
of property could not, if he wished to destroy it, go to work in a wiser 
and more effective way.  Courage, then, ministers, deputies, economists! 
make haste to seize this glorious initiative; let the watchwords of 
equality, uttered from the heights of science and power, be repeated in 
the midst of the people; let them thrill the breasts of the proletaires, and 
carry dismay into the ranks of the last representatives of privilege! 
</p> 
<p>The tendency of society in favor of compelling proprietors 
 
<pb n="306"/>  
to support national workshops and public manufactories is so strong that 
for several years, under the name of <hi rend="italic">electoral reform</hi>, it 
has been exclusively the question of the day.  What is, after all, this 
electoral reform which the people grasp at, as if it were a bait, and 
which so many ambitious persons either call for or denounce?  It is the 
acknowledgment of the right of the masses to a voice in the assessment 
of taxes, and the making of the laws; which laws, aiming always at the 
protection of material interests, affect, in a greater or less degree, all 
questions of taxation or wages.  Now the people, instructed long since by 
their journals, their dramas,[1] and their songs,[2] know to-day that 
taxation, to be equitably divided, must be graduated, and must be borne 
mainly by the rich, &mdash; that it must be levied upon luxuries, &amp;c.  And be 
sure that the people, once in the majority in the Chamber, will not fail to 
apply these lessons.  Already we have a minister of public works.  
National workshops will follow; and soon, as a consequence, the excess 
of the proprietor's revenue over the workingman's wages will be 
swallowed up in the coffers of the laborers of the State.  Do you not see 
that in this way property is gradually reduced, as nobility was formerly, 
to a nominal title, to a distinction purely honorary in its nature? 
</p> 
<p>Either the electoral reform will fail to accomplish that which is 
hoped from it, and will disappoint its innumerable partisans, or else it 
will inevitably result in a transformation of the absolute right under 
which we live into a right of possession; that is, that while, at present, 
property makes the elec-</p>

<pb n="307"/>  
<p>
tor, after this reform is accomplished, the citizen, the producer will be 
the possessor.[1]  Consequently, the radicals are right in saying that the 
electoral reform is in their eyes only a means; but, when they are silent 
as to the end, they show either profound ignorance, or useless 
dissimulation.  There should be no secrets or reservations from peoples 
and powers.  He disgraces himself and fails in respect for his fellows, 
who, in publishing his opinions, employs evasion and cunning.  Before 
the people act, they need to know the whole truth.  Unhappy he who 
shall dare to trifle with them!  For the people are credulous, but they are 
strong.  Let us tell them, then, that this reform which is proposed is only 
a means, &mdash; a means often tried, and hitherto without effect, &mdash; but that 
the logical object of the electoral reform is equality of fortunes; and that 
this equality itself is only a new means having in view the superior and 
definitive object of the salvation of society, the restoration of morals and 
religion, and the revival of poetry and art. 
</p> 
<p>It would be an abuse of the reader's patience to insist further upon 
the tendency of our time towards equality.  There are, moreover, so 
many people who denounce the present age, 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;In some countries, the enjoyment of certain political rights 
depends upon the amount of property.  But, in these same countries, 
property is expressive, rather than attributive, of the qualifications 
necessary to the exercise of these rights.  It is rather a conjectural proof 
than the cause of these qualifications.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Rossi: Treatise 
on Penal Law</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>This assertion of M. Rossi is not borne out by history.  Property is 
the cause of the electoral right, not as a <hi rend="italic">presumption of 
capacity</hi>, &mdash; an idea which never prevailed until lately, and which 
is extremely absurd, &mdash; but as a <hi rend="italic">guarantee</hi> <hi rend="italic">of 
devotion to the established order</hi>.  The electoral body is a league 
of those interested in the maintenance of property, against those not 
interested.  There are thousands of documents, even official documents, 
to prove this, if necessary.  For the rest, the present system is only a 
continuation of the municipal system, which, in the middle ages, sprang 
up in connection with feudalism, &mdash; an oppressive, mischief-making 
system, full of petty passions and base intrigues. 
 
 
 
<pb n="308"/>  
that nothing is gained by exposing to their view the popular, scientific, 
and representative tendencies of the nation.  Prompt to recognize the 
accuracy of the inferences drawn from observation, they confine 
themselves to a general censure of the facts, and an absolute denial of 
their legitimacy.  &ldquo;What wonder,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;that 
this atmosphere of equality intoxicates us, considering all that has been 
said and done during the past ten years! . . .  Do you not see that society 
is dissolving, that a spirit of infatuation is carrying us away?  All these 
hopes of regeneration are but forebodings of death; your songs of 
triumph are like the prayers of the departing, your trumpet peals 
announce the baptism of a dying man.  Civilization is falling in ruin: 
<hi rend="italic">Imus, imus, pr&aelig;cipites</hi>!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Such people deny God.  I might content myself with the reply that 
the spirit of 1830 was the result of the maintenance of the violated 
charter; that this charter arose from the Revolution of '89; that '89 
implies the States-General's right of remonstrance, and the 
enfranchisement of the communes; that the communes suppose 
feudalism, which in its turn supposes invasion, Roman law, Christianity, 
&amp;c. 
</p> 
<p>But it is necessary to look further.  We must penetrate to the very 
heart of ancient institutions, plunge into the social depths, and uncover 
this indestructible leaven of equality which the God of justice breathed 
into our souls, and which manifests itself in all our works. 
</p> 
<p>Labor is man's contemporary; it is a duty, since it is a condition of 
existence:  &ldquo;In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.&rdquo;  
It is more than a duty, it is a mission:  &ldquo;God put the man into the 
garden to dress it.&rdquo;  I add that labor is the cause and means of 
equality. 
</p> 
<p>Cast away upon a desert island two men: one large, strong, and 
active; the other weak, timid, and domestic.  The latter  
<pb n="309"/>  
will die of hunger; while the other, a skilful hunter, an expert fisherman, 
and an indefatigable husbandman, will overstock himself with provisions.  
What greater inequality, in this state of Nature so dear to the heart of 
Jean Jacques, could be imagined!  But let these two men meet and 
associate themselves: the second immediately attends to the cooking, 
takes charge of the household affairs, and sees to the provisions, beds, 
and clothes; provided the stronger does not abuse his superiority by 
enslaving and ill-treating his companion, their social condition will be 
perfectly equal.  Thus, through exchange of services, the inequalities of 
Nature neutralize each other, talents associate, and forces balance.  
Violence and inertia are found only among the poor and the aristocratic.  
And in that lies the philosophy of political economy, the mystery of 
human brotherhood.  <hi rend="italic">Hic est sapientia</hi>.  Let us pass from 
the hypothetical state of pure Nature into civilization. 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor of the soil, who produces, I will suppose with the 
economists, by lending his instrument, receives at the foundation of a 
society so many bushels of grain for each acre of arable land.  As long 
as labor is weak, and the variety of its products small, the proprietor is 
powerful in comparison with the laborers; he has ten times, one hundred 
times, the portion of an honest man.  But let labor, by multiplying its 
inventions, multiply its enjoyments and wants, and the proprietor, if he 
wishes to enjoy the new products, will be obliged to reduce his income 
every day; and since the first products tend rather to depreciate than to 
rise in value, &mdash; in consequence of the continual addition of the new 
ones, which may be regarded as supplements of the first ones, &mdash; it 
follows that the idle proprietor grows poor as fast as public prosperity 
increases.  &ldquo;Incomes&rdquo; (I like to quote you, sir, because it 
is  
<pb n="310"/>  
impossible to give too good an authority for these elementary principles 
of economy, and because I cannot express them better myself), 
&ldquo;incomes,&rdquo; you have said, &ldquo;tend to disappear as 
capital increases.  He who possesses to-day an income of twenty 
thousand pounds is not nearly as rich as he who possessed the same 
amount fifty years ago.  The time is coming when all property will be a 
burden to the idle, and will necessarily pass into the hands of the able 
and industrious.[1] . . .&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In order to live as a proprietor, or to consume without producing, 
it is necessary, then, to live upon the labor of another; in other words, it 
is necessary to kill the laborer.  It is upon this principle that proprietors 
of those varieties of capital which are of primary necessity increase their 
farm-rents as fast as industry develops, much more careful of their 
privileges in that respect, than those economists who, in order to 
strengthen property, advocate a reduction of interest.  But the crime is 
unavailing: labor and production increase; soon the proprietor will be 
forced to labor, and then property is lost. 
</p> 
<p>The proprietor is a man who, having absolute control of an 
instrument of production, claims the right to enjoy the product of the 
instrument without using it himself.  To this end he lends it; and we 
have just seen that from this loan the laborer derives a power of 
exchange, which sooner or later will destroy the right of increase.  In the 
first place, the proprietor is obliged to allow the laborer a portion of the 
product, for without it the laborer could not live.  Soon the latter, 
through the development of his industry, finds a means of regaining the 
greater portion of that which he gives to the proprietor; so that at last, 
the objects of enjoyment increasing continually, while the income of the 
idler remains the same, 
 
 
[1]  Lecture of December 22. 
 
 
 
<pb n="311"/>  
the proprietor, having exhausted his resources, begins to think of going 
to work himself.  Then the victory of the producer is certain.  Labor 
commences to tip the balance towards its own side, and commerce leads 
to equilibrium. 
</p> 
<p>Man's instinct cannot err; as, in liberty, exchange of functions 
leads inevitably to equality among men, so commerce &mdash; or exchange of 
products, which is identical with exchange of functions &mdash; is a new cause 
of equality.  As long as the proprietor does not labor, however small his 
income, he enjoys a privilege; the laborer's welfare may be equal to his, 
but equality of conditions does not exist.  But as soon as the proprietor 
becomes a producer, &mdash; since he can exchange his special product only 
with his tenant or his <hi rend="italic">commandit&eacute;</hi>, &mdash; sooner or 
later this tenant, this <hi rend="italic">exploited</hi> man, if violence is not done 
him, will make a profit out of the proprietor, and will oblige him to 
restore &mdash; in the exchange of their respective products &mdash; the interest on 
his capital.  So that, balancing one injustice by another, the contracting 
parties will be equal.  Labor and exchange, when liberty prevails, lead, 
then, to equality of fortunes; mutuality of services neutralizes privilege.  
That is why despots in all ages and countries have assumed control of 
commerce; they wished to prevent the labor of their subjects from 
becoming an obstacle to the rapacity of tyrants. 
</p> 
<p>Up to this point, all takes place in the natural order; there is no 
premeditation, no artifice.  The whole proceeding is governed by the 
laws of necessity alone.  Proprietors and laborers act only in obedience 
to their wants.  Thus, the exercise of the right of increase, the art of 
robbing the producer, depends &mdash; during this first period of civilization &mdash;  
upon physical violence, murder, and war. 
But at this point a gigantic and complicated conspiracy is  
<pb n="312"/>  
hatched against the capitalists.  The weapon of the 
<hi rend="italic">exploiters</hi> is met by the <hi rend="italic">exploited</hi> with the 
instrument of commerce, &mdash; a marvellous invention, denounced at its 
origin by the moralists who favored property, but inspired without doubt 
by the genius of labor, by the Minerva of the proletaires. 
</p> 
<p>The principal cause of the evil lay in the accumulation and 
immobility of capital of all sorts, &mdash; an immobility which prevented 
labor, enslaved and subalternized by haughty idleness, from ever 
acquiring it.  The necessity was felt of dividing and mobilizing wealth, 
of rendering it portable, of making it pass from the hands of the 
possessor into those of the worker.  Labor invented 
<hi rend="italic">money</hi>.  Afterwards, this invention was revived and 
developed by the <hi rend="italic">bill of exchange</hi> and the 
<hi rend="italic">Bank</hi>.  For all these things are substantially the same, and 
proceed from the same mind.  The first man who conceived the idea of 
representing a value by a shell, a precious stone, or a certain weight of 
metal, was the real inventor of the Bank.  What is a piece of money, in 
fact?  It is a bill of exchange written upon solid and durable material, 
and carrying with it its own redemption.  By this means, oppressed 
equality was enabled to laugh at the efforts of the proprietors, and the 
balance of justice was adjusted for the first time in the tradesman's shop.  
The trap was cunningly set, and accomplished its purpose so thoroughly 
that in idle hands money became only dissolving wealth, a false symbol, 
a shadow of riches.  An excellent economist and profound philosopher 
was that miser who took as his motto, &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">When a guinea is 
exchanged, it evaporates</hi>.&rdquo;  So it may be said, 
&ldquo;When real estate is converted into money, it is lost.&rdquo;  
This explains the constant fact of history, that the nobles &mdash; the 
unproductive proprietors of the soil &mdash; have every where been 
dispossessed by industrial and commercial plebeians.  Such  
<pb n="313"/>  
was especially the case in the formation of the Italian republics, born, 
during the middle ages, of the impoverishment of the seigniors.  I will 
not pursue the interesting considerations which this matter suggests; I 
could only repeat the testimony of historians, and present economical 
demonstrations in an altered form. 
</p> 
<p>The greatest enemy of the landed and industrial aristocracy to-day, 
the incessant promoter of equality of fortunes, is the 
<hi rend="italic">banker</hi>.  Through him immense plains are divided, 
mountains change their positions, forests are grown upon the public 
squares, one hemisphere produces for another, and every corner of the 
globe has its usufructuaries.  By means of the Bank new wealth is 
continually created, the use of which (soon becoming indispensable to 
selfishness) wrests the dormant capital from the hands of the jealous 
proprietor.  The banker is at once the most potent creator of wealth, and 
the main distributor of the products of art and Nature.  And yet, by the 
strangest antinomy, this same banker is the most relentless collector of 
profits, increase, and usury ever inspired by the demon of property.  The 
importance of the services which he renders leads us to endure, though 
not without complaint, the taxes which he imposes.  Nevertheless, since 
nothing can avoid its providential mission, since nothing which exists can 
escape the end for which it exists the banker (the modern Cr&oelig;sus) 
must some day become the restorer of equality.  And following in your 
footsteps, sir, I have already given the reason; namely, that profit 
decreases as capital multiplies, since an increase of capital &mdash; calling for 
more laborers, without whom it remains unproductive &mdash; always causes 
an increase of wages.  Whence it follows that the Bank, to-day the 
suction-pump of wealth, is destined to become the steward of the human 
race. 
 
<pb n="314"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>The phrase <hi rend="italic">equality of fortunes</hi> chafes people, as if it 
referred to a condition of the other world, unknown here below.  There 
are some persons, radicals as well as moderates, whom the very mention 
of this idea fills with indignation.  Let, then, these silly aristocrats 
abolish mercantile societies and insurance companies, which are founded 
by prudence for mutual assistance.  For all these social facts, so 
spontaneous and free from all levelling intentions, are the legitimate 
fruits of the instinct of equality. 
</p> 
<p>When the legislator makes a law, properly speaking he does not 
<hi rend="italic">make</hi> it, &mdash; he does not <hi rend="italic">create</hi> it: he 
<hi rend="italic">describes</hi> it.  In legislating upon the moral, civil, and 
political relations of citizens, he does not express an arbitrary notion: he 
states the general idea, &mdash; the higher principle which governs the matter 
which he is considering; in a word, he is the proclaimer, not the 
inventor, of the law.  So, when two or more men form among 
themselves, by synallagmatic contract, an industrial or an insurance 
association, they recognize that their interests, formerly isolated by a 
false spirit of selfishness and independence, are firmly connected by their 
inner natures, and by the mutuality of their relations.  They do not really 
bind themselves by an act of their private will: they swear to conform 
henceforth to a previously existing social law hitherto disregarded by 
them.  And this is proved by the fact that these same men, could they 
avoid association, would not associate.  Before they can be induced to 
unite their interests, they must acquire full knowledge of the dangers of 
competition and isolation; hence the experience of evil is the only thing 
which leads them into society. 
</p> 
<p>Now I say that, to establish equality among men, it is only 
necessary to generalize the principle upon which insurance, agricultural, 
and commercial associations are based.  I say  
<pb n="315"/>  
that competition, isolation of interests, monopoly, privilege, 
accumulation of capital, exclusive enjoyment, subordination of functions, 
individual production, the right of profit or increase, the exploitation of 
man by man, and, to sum up all these species under one head, that 
PROPERTY is the principal cause of misery and crime.  And, for 
having arrived at this offensive and anti-proprietary conclusion, I am an 
abhorred monster; radicals and conservatives alike point me out as a fit 
subject for prosecution; the academies shower their censures upon me; 
the most worthy people regard me as mad; and those are excessively 
tolerant who content themselves with the assertion that I am a fool.  Oh, 
unhappy the writer who publishes the truth otherwise than as a 
performance of a duty!  If he has counted upon the applause of the 
crowd; if he has supposed that avarice and self-interest would forget 
themselves in admiration of him; if he has neglected to encase himself 
within three thicknesses of brass, &mdash; he will fail, as he ought, in his 
selfish undertaking.  The unjust criticisms, the sad disappointments, the 
despair of his mistaken ambition, will kill him. 
</p> 
<p>But, if I am no longer permitted to express my own personal 
opinion concerning this interesting question of social equilibrium, let me, 
at least, make known the thought of my masters, and develop the 
doctrines advocated in the name of the government. 
</p> 
<p>It never has been my intention, sir, in spite of the vigorous censure 
which you, in behalf of your academy, have pronounced upon the 
doctrine of equality of fortunes, to contradict and cope with you.  In 
listening to you, I have felt my inferiority too keenly to permit me to 
enter upon such a discussion.  And then, &mdash; if it must be said, &mdash; however 
different your language is from mine, we believe in the same 
princi 
<pb n="316"/>  
ples; you share all my opinions.  I do not mean to insinuate thereby, sir, 
that you have (to use the phraseology of the schools) an 
<hi rend="italic">esoteric</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">exoteric</hi> doctrine, &mdash; that, 
secretly believing in equality, you defend property only from motives of 
prudence and by command.  I am not rash enough to regard you as my 
colleague in my revolutionary projects; and I esteem you too highly, 
moreover, to suspect you of dissimulation.  I only mean that the truths 
which methodical investigation and laborious metaphysical speculation 
have painfully demonstrated to me, a profound acquaintance with 
political economy and a long experience reveal to you.  While I have 
reached my belief in equality by long reflection, and almost in spite of 
my desires, you hold yours, sir, with all the zeal of faith, &mdash; with all the 
spontaneity of genius.  That is why your course of lectures at the 
Conservatory is a perpetual war upon property and inequality of 
fortunes; that is why your most learned investigations, your most 
ingenious analyses, and your innumerable observations always conclude 
in a formula of progress and equality; that is why, finally, you are never 
more admired and applauded than at those moments of inspiration when, 
borne upon the wings of science, you ascend to those lofty truths which 
cause plebeian hearts to beat with enthusiasm, and which chill with 
horror men whose intentions are evil.  How many times, from the place 
where I eagerly drank in your eloquent words, have I inwardly thanked 
Heaven for exempting you from the judgment passed by St. Paul upon 
the philosophers of his time, &mdash; &ldquo;They have known the truth, and 
have not made it known&rdquo;!  How many times have I rejoiced at 
finding my own justification in each of your discourses!  No, no; I 
neither wish nor ask for any thing which you do not teach yourself.  I 
appeal to your numerous audience;  
<pb n="317"/>  
let it belie me if, in commenting upon you, I pervert your meaning. 
</p> 
<p>A disciple of Say, what in your eyes is more anti-social than the 
custom-houses; or, as you correctly call them, the barriers erected by 
monopoly between nations?  What is more annoying, more unjust, or 
more absurd, than this prohibitory system which compels us to pay forty 
sous in France for that which in England or Belgium would bring us but 
fifteen?  It is the custom-house, you once said,[1] which arrests the 
development of civilization by preventing the specialization of industries; 
it is the custom-house which enriches a hundred monopolists by 
impoverishing millions of citizens; it is the custom-house which produces 
famine in the midst of abundance, which makes labor sterile by 
prohibiting exchange, and which stifles production in a mortal embrace.  
It is the custom-house which renders nations jealous of, and hostile to, 
each other; four-fifths of the wars of all ages were caused originally by 
the custom-house.  And then, at the highest pitch of your enthusiasm, 
you shouted:  &ldquo;Yes, if to put an end to this hateful system, it 
should become necessary for me to shed the last drop of my blood, I 
would joyfully spring into the gap, asking only time enough to give 
thanks to God for having judged me worthy of martyrdom!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>And, at that solemn moment, I said to myself:  &ldquo;Place in 
every department of France such a professor as that, and the revolution 
is avoided.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, by this magnificent theory of liberty of commerce you 
render military glory impossible, &mdash; you leave nothing for diplomacy to 
do; you even take away the desire for conquest, while abolishing profit 
altogether.  What matters it, indeed,

<pb n="318"/>  
who restores Constantinople, Alexandria, and Saint Jean d'Acre, if the 
Syrians, Egyptians, and Turks are free to choose their masters; free to 
exchange their products with whom they please?  Why should Europe get 
into such a turmoil over this petty Sultan and his old Pasha, if it is only 
a question whether we or the English shall civilize the Orient, &mdash; shall 
instruct Egypt and Syria in the European arts, and shall teach them to 
construct machines, dig canals, and build railroads?  For, if to national 
independence free trade is added, the foreign influence of these two 
countries is thereafter exerted only through a voluntary relationship of 
producer to producer, or apprentice to journeyman. 
</p> 
<p>Alone among European powers, France cheerfully accepted the 
task of civilizing the Orient, and began an invasion which was quite 
apostolic in its character, &mdash; so joyful and high-minded do noble thoughts 
render our nation!  But diplomatic rivalry, national selfishness, English 
avarice, and Russian ambition stood in her way.  To consummate a long-meditated usurpation, it was necessary to crush a too generous ally: the 
robbers of the Holy Alliance formed a league against dauntless and 
blameless France.  Consequently, at the news of this famous treaty, there 
arose among us a chorus of curses upon the principle of property, which 
at that time was acting under the hypocritical formulas of the old 
political system.  The last hour of property seemed to have struck by the 
side of Syria; from the Alps to the ocean, from the Rhine to the 
Pyrenees, the popular conscience was aroused.  All France sang songs of 
war, and the coalition turned pale at the sound of these shuddering cries:  
&ldquo;War upon the autocrat, who wishes to be proprietor of the old 
world!  War upon the English perjurer, the devourer of India, the 
poisoner of China, the tyrant of Ireland, and the eternal enemy 
 
<pb n="319"/>  
of France!  War upon the allies who have conspired against liberty and 
equality!  War! war! war upon property!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>By the counsel of Providence the emancipation of the nations is 
postponed.  France is to conquer, not by arms, but by example.  
Universal reason does not yet understand this grand equation, which, 
commencing with the abolition of slavery, and advancing over the ruins 
of aristocracies and thrones, must end in equality of rights and fortunes; 
but the day is not far off when the knowledge of this truth will be as 
common as that of equality of origin.  Already it seems to be understood 
that the Oriental question is only a question of custom-houses.  Is it, 
then, so difficult for public opinion to generalize this idea, and to 
comprehend, finally, that if the suppression of custom-houses involves 
the abolition of national property, it involves also, as a consequence, the 
abolition of individual property? 
</p> 
<p>In fact, if we suppress the custom-houses, the alliance of the 
nations is declared by that very act; their solidarity is recognized, and 
their equality proclaimed.  If we suppress the custom-houses, the 
principle of association will not be slow in reaching from the State to the 
province, from the province to the city, and from the city to the 
workshop.  But, then, what becomes of the privileges of authors and 
artists?  Of what use are the patents for invention, imagination, 
amelioration, and improvement?  When our deputies write a law of 
literary property by the side of a law which opens a large breach in the 
custom-house they contradict themselves, indeed, and pull down with one 
hand what they build up with the other.  Without the custom-house.  
literary property does not exist, and the hopes of our starving authors are 
frustrated.  For, certainly you do not expect, with the good man Fourier, 
that literary property will exercise itself in China to the profit of 
 
<pb n="320"/>  
a French writer; and that an ode of Lamartine, sold by privilege all over 
the world, will bring in millions to its author!  The poet's work is 
peculiar to the climate in which he lives; every where else the 
reproduction of his works, having no market value, should be frank and 
free.  But what! will it be necessary for nations to put themselves under 
mutual surveillance for the sake of verses, statues, and elixirs?  We shall 
always have, then, an excise, a city-toll, rights of entrance and transit, 
custom-houses finally; and then, as a reaction against privilege, 
smuggling. 
</p> 
<p>Smuggling!  That word reminds me of one of the most horrible 
forms of property.  &ldquo;Smuggling,&rdquo; you have said, sir,[1] 
&ldquo;is an offence of political creation; it is the exercise of natural 
liberty, defined as a crime in certain cases by the will of the sovereign.  
The smuggler is a gallant man, &mdash; a man of spirit, who gaily busies 
himself in procuring for his neighbor, at a very low price, a jewel, a 
shawl, or any other object of necessity or luxury, which domestic 
monopoly renders excessively dear.&rdquo;  Then, to a very poetical 
monograph of the smuggler, you add this dismal conclusion, &mdash; that the 
smuggler belongs to the family of Mandrin, and that the galleys should 
be his home! 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, you have not called attention to the horrible exploitation 
which is carried on in this way in the name of property. 
</p> 
<p>It is said, &mdash; and I give this report only as an hypothesis and an 
illustration, for I do not believe it, &mdash; it is said that the present minister 
of finances owes his fortune to smuggling.  M. Humann, of Strasbourg, 
sent out of France, it is said, enormous quantities of sugar, for which he 
received the 
 
 
[1] Lecture of Jan.  15, 1841. 
 
 
 
<pb n="321"/>  
bounty on exportation promised by the State; then, smuggling this sugar 
back again, he exported it anew, receiving the bounty on exportation a 
second time, and so on.  Notice, sir, that I do not state this as a fact; I 
give it only as it is told, not endorsing or even believing it.  My sole 
design is to fix the idea in the mind by an example.  If I believed that a 
minister had committed such a crime, that is, if I had personal and 
authentic knowledge that he had, I would denounce M. Humann, the 
minister of finances, to the Chamber of Deputies, and would loudly 
demand his expulsion from the ministry. 
</p> 
<p>But that which is undoubtedly false of M. Humann is true of many 
others, as rich and no less honorable than he.  Smuggling, organized on 
a large scale by the eaters of human flesh, is carried on to the profit of a 
few pashas at the risk and peril of their imprudent victims.  The inactive 
proprietor offers his merchandise for sale; the actual smuggler risks his 
liberty, his honor, and his life.  If success crowns the enterprise, the 
courageous servant gets paid for his journey; the profit goes to the 
coward.  If fortune or treachery delivers the instrument of this execrable 
traffic into the hands of the custom-house officer, the master-smuggler 
suffers a loss which a more fortunate voyage will soon repair.  The 
agent, pronounced a scoundrel, is thrown into prison in company with 
robbers; while his glorious patron, a juror, elector, deputy, or minister, 
makes laws concerning expropriation, monopoly, and custom-houses! 
</p> 
<p>I promised, at the beginning of this letter, that no attack on 
property should escape my pen, my only object being to justify myself 
before the public by a general recrimination.  But I could not refrain 
from branding so odious a mode of exploitation, and I trust that this 
short digression will be pardoned.   
<pb n="322"/>  
Property does not avenge, I hope, the injuries which smuggling suffers. 
</p> 
<p>The conspiracy against property is general; it is flagrant; it takes 
possession of all minds, and inspires all our laws; it lies at the bottom of 
all theories.  Here the proletaire pursues property in the street, there the 
legislator lays an interdict upon it; now, a professor of political economy 
or of industrial legislation,[1] paid to defend it, undermines it with 
redoubled blows; at another &mdash; time, an academy calls it in question,[2] 
or inquires as to the progress of its demolition.[3]  To-day there is not 
an idea, not an opinion, not a sect, which does not dream of muzzling 
property.  None confess it, because none are yet conscious of it; there 
are too few minds capable of grasping spontaneously this 
<hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> of causes and effects, of principles and 
consequences, by which I try to demonstrate the approaching 
disappearance of property; on the other hand, the ideas that are generally 
formed of this right are too divergent and too loosely determined to 
allow an admission, so soon, of the contrary theory.  Thus, in the middle 
and lower ranks of literature and philosophy, no less than among the 
common people, it is thought that, when property is abolished, no one 
will be able to enjoy the fruit of his labor; that no one will have any 
thing peculiar to himself, and that tyrannical communism will be 
established on the ruins of family and

<pb n="323"/>  
liberty! &mdash; chimeras, which are to support for a little while longer the 
cause of privilege. 
</p> 
<p>But, before determining precisely the idea of property, before 
seeking amid the contradictions of systems for the common element 
which must form the basis of the new right, let us cast a rapid glance at 
the changes which, at the various periods of history, property has 
undergone.  The political forms of nations are the expression of their 
beliefs.  The mobility of these forms, their modification and their 
destruction, are solemn experiences which show us the value of ideas, 
and gradually eliminate from the infinite variety of customs the absolute, 
eternal, and immutable truth.  Now, we shall see that every political 
institution tends, necessarily, and on pain of death, to equalize 
conditions; that every where and always equality of fortunes (like 
equality of rights) has been the social aim, whether the plebeian classes 
have endeavored to rise to political power by means of property, or 
whether &mdash; rulers already &mdash; they have used political power to overthrow 
property.  We shall see, in short, by the progress of society, that the 
consummation of justice lies in the extinction of individual domain. 
</p> 
<p>For the sake of brevity, I will disregard the testimony of 
ecclesiastical history and Christian theology: this subject deserves a 
separate treatise, and I propose hereafter to return to it.  Moses and 
Jesus Christ proscribed, under the names of usury and inequality,[1] all 
sorts of profit and increase.  The church itself, in its purest teachings, 
has always condemned property; and when I attacked, not only the 
authority of the church, but also its infidelity to justice, I did it to the 
glory of religion.  I wanted to provoke a peremptory 
 
 
[1]  <foreign lang="grk"> Pleonexia</foreign>, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">greater property</hi>.  The Vulgate translates it avaritia. 
 
 
 
<pb n="324"/>  
reply, and to pave the way for Christianity's triumph, in spite of the 
innumerable attacks of which it is at present the object.  I hoped that an 
apologist would arise forthwith, and, taking his stand upon the 
Scriptures, the Fathers, the canons, and the councils and constitutions of 
the Popes, would demonstrate that the church always has maintained the 
doctrine of equality, and would attribute to temporary necessity the 
contradictions of its discipline.  Such a labor would serve the cause of 
religion as well as that of equality.  We must know, sooner or later, 
whether Christianity is to be regenerated in the church or out of it, and 
whether this church accepts the reproaches cast upon it of hatred to 
liberty and antipathy to progress.  Until then we will suspend judgment, 
and content ourselves with placing before the clergy the teachings of 
history.

<p>When Lycurgus undertook to make laws for Sparta, in what 
condition did he find this republic?  On this point all historians agree.  
The people and the nobles were at war.  The city was in a confused 
state, and divided by two parties, &mdash; the party of the poor, and the party 
of the rich.  Hardly escaped from the barbarism of the heroic ages, 
society was rapidly declining.  The proletariat made war upon property, 
which, in its turn, oppressed the proletariat.  What did Lycurgus do?  
His first measure was one of general security, at the very idea of which 
our legislators would tremble.  He abolished all debts; then, employing 
by turns persuasion and force, he induced the nobles to renounce their 
privileges, and re-established equality.  Lycurgus, in a word, hunted 
property out of Laced&aelig;mon, seeing no other way to harmonize 
liberty, equality, and law.  I certainly should not wish France to follow 
the example of Sparta; but it is remarkable that the most ancient of 
Greek legislators, thor 
<pb n="325"/>  
oughly acquainted with the nature and needs of the people, more capable 
than any one else of appreciating the legitimacy of the obligations which 
he, in the exercise of his absolute authority, cancelled; who had 
compared the legislative systems of his time, and whose wisdom an 
oracle had proclaimed, &mdash; it is remarkable, I say, that Lycurgus should 
have judged the right of property incompatible with free institutions, and 
should have thought it his duty to preface his legislation by a <hi rend="italic">coup 
d'&eacute;tat</hi> which destroyed all distinctions of fortune. 
</p> 
<p>Lycurgus understood perfectly that the luxury, the love of 
enjoyments, and the inequality of fortunes, which property engenders, 
are the bane of society; unfortunately the means which he employed to 
preserve his republic were suggested to him by false notions of political 
economy, and by a superficial knowledge of the human heart.  
Accordingly, property, which this legislator wrongly confounded with 
wealth, reentered the city together with the swarm of evils which he was 
endeavoring to banish; and this time Sparta was hopelessly corrupted. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The introduction of wealth,&rdquo; says M. Pastoret, 
&ldquo;was one of the principal causes of the misfortunes which they 
experienced.  Against these, however, the laws had taken extraordinary 
precautions, the best among which was the inculcation of morals which 
tended to suppress desire.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>The best of all precautions would have been the anticipation of 
desire by satisfaction.  Possession is the sovereign remedy for cupidity, a 
remedy which would have been the less perilous to Sparta because 
fortunes there were almost equal, and conditions were nearly alike.  As a 
general thing, fasting and abstinence are bad teachers of moderation. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There was a law,&rdquo; says M. Pastoret again, 
&ldquo;to prohibit  
<pb n="326"/>  
the rich from wearing better clothing than the poor, from eating more 
delicate food, and from owning elegant furniture, vases, carpets, fine 
houses,&rdquo; &amp;c.  Lycurgus hoped, then, to maintain equality by 
rendering wealth useless.  How much wiser he would have been if, in 
accordance with his military discipline, he had organized industry and 
taught the people to procure by their own labor the things which he tried 
in vain to deprive them of.  In that case, enjoying happy thoughts and 
pleasant feelings, the citizen would have known no other desire than that 
with which the legislator endeavored to inspire him, &mdash; love of honor and 
glory, the triumphs of talent and virtue. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Gold and all kinds of ornaments were forbidden the 
women.&rdquo;  Absurd.  After the death of Lycurgus, his institutions 
became corrupted; and four centuries before the Christian era not a 
vestige remained of the former simplicity.  Luxury and the thirst for gold 
were early developed among the Spartans in a degree as intense as might 
have been expected from their enforced poverty and their inexperience in 
the arts.  Historians have accused Pausanias, Lysander, Agesilaus, and 
others of having corrupted the morals of their country by the introduction 
of wealth obtained in war.  It is a slander.  The morals of the Spartans 
necessarily grew corrupt as soon as the Laced&aelig;monian poverty 
came in contact with Persian luxury and Athenian elegance.  Lycurgus, 
then, made a fatal mistake in attempting to inspire generosity and 
modesty by enforcing vain and proud simplicity. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Lycurgus was not frightened at idleness!  A 
Laced&aelig;monian, happening to be in Athens (where idleness was 
forbidden) during the punishment of a citizen who had been found guilty, 
asked to see the Athenian thus condemned for having exercised the rights 
of a free man. . . .  It was one of the principles of Lycurguss, acted 
upon for several centuries, that free men should not follow lucrative 
professions. . . .  The women  
<pb n="327"/>  
disdained domestic labor; they did not spin their wool themselves, as did 
the other Greeks [they did not, then, read Homer!]; they left their slaves 
to make their clothing for them.&rdquo;<hi rend="italic"> &mdash; Pastoret:  History of 
Legislation</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>Could any thing be more contradictory?  Lycurgus proscribed 
property among the citizens, and founded the means of subsistence on 
the worst form of property, &mdash; on property obtained by force.  What 
wonder, after that, that a lazy city, where no industry was carried on, 
became a den of avarice?  The Spartans succumbed the more easily to 
the allurements of luxury and Asiatic voluptuousness, being placed 
entirely at their mercy by their own coarseness.  The same thing 
happened to the Romans, when military success took them out of Italy, --a thing which the author of the prosopopoeia of Fabricius could not 
explain.  It is not the cultivation of the arts which corrupts morals, but 
their degradation, induced by inactive and luxurious opulence.  The 
instinct of property is to make the industry of D&aelig;dalus, as well as 
the talent of Phidias, subservient to its own fantastic whims and 
disgraceful pleasures.  Property, not wealth, ruined the Spartans. 
</p> 
<p>When Solon appeared, the anarchy caused by property was at its 
height in the Athenian republic.  &ldquo;The inhabitants of Attica were 
divided among themselves as to the form of government.  Those who 
lived on the mountains (the poor) preferred the popular form; those of 
the plain (the middle class), the oligarchs; those by the sea coast, a 
mixture of oligarchy and democracy.  Other dissensions were arising 
from the inequality of fortunes.  The mutual antagonism of the rich and 
poor had become so violent, that the one-man power seemed the only 
safe-guard against the revolution with which the republic was 
threatened.&rdquo;  (<hi rend="italic">Pastoret:  History of Legislation</hi>.) 
 
<pb n="328"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Quarrels between the rich and the poor, which seldom occur in 
monarchies, because a well established power suppresses dissensions, 
seem to be the life of popular governments.  Aristotle had noticed this.  
The oppression of wealth submitted to agrarian laws, or to excessive 
taxation; the hatred of the lower classes for the upper class, which is 
exposed always to libellous charges made in hopes of confiscation, &mdash; 
these were the features of the Athenian government which were 
especially revolting to Aristotle, and which caused him to favor a limited 
monarchy.  Aristotle, if he had lived in our day, would have supported 
the constitutional government.  But, with all deference to the Stagirite, a 
government which sacrifices the life of the proletaire to that of the 
proprietor is quite as irrational as one which supports the former by 
robbing the latter; neither of them deserve the support of a free man, 
much less of a philosopher. 
</p> 
<p>Solon followed the example of Lycurgus.  He celebrated his 
legislative inauguration by the abolition of debts, &mdash; that is, by 
bankruptcy.  In other words, Solon wound up the governmental machine 
for a longer or shorter time depending upon the rate of interest.  
Consequently, when the spring relaxed and the chain became unwound, 
the republic had either to perish, or to recover itself by a second 
bankruptcy.  This singular policy was pursued by all the ancients.  After 
the captivity of Babylon, Nehemiah, the chief of the Jewish nation, 
abolished debts; Lycurgus abolished debts; Solon abolished debts; the 
Roman people, after the expulsion of the kings until the accession of the 
C&aelig;sars, struggled with the Senate for the abolition of debts.  
Afterwards, towards the end of the republic, and long after the 
establishment of the empire, agriculture being abandoned, and the 
provinces becoming depopulated in consequence of the excessive rates 
 
<pb n="329"/>  
of interest, the emperors freely granted the lands to whoever would 
cultivate them, &mdash; that is, they abolished debts.  No one, except 
Lycurgus, who went to the other extreme, ever perceived that the great 
point was, not to release debtors by a <hi rend="italic">coup d'&eacute;tat</hi>, 
but to prevent the contraction of debts in future.  On the contrary, the 
most democratic governments were always exclusively based upon 
individual property; so that the social element of all these republics was 
war between the citizens. 
</p> 
<p>Solon decreed that a census should be taken of all fortunes, 
regulated political rights by the result, granted to the larger proprietors 
more influence, established the balance of powers, &mdash; in a word, inserted 
in the constitution the most active leaven of discord; as if, instead of a 
legislator chosen by the people, he had been their greatest enemy.  Is it 
not, indeed, the height of imprudence to grant equality of political rights 
to men of unequal conditions?  If a manufacturer, uniting all his 
workmen in a joint-stock company, should give to each of them a 
consultative and deliberative voice, &mdash; that is, should make all of them 
masters, &mdash; would this equality of mastership secure continued inequality 
of wages?  That is the whole political system of Solon, reduced to its 
simplest expression. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In giving property a just preponderance,&rdquo; says M. 
Pastoret, &ldquo;Solon repaired, as far as he was able, his first official 
act, &mdash; the abolition of debts. . . .  He thought he owed it to public peace 
to make this great sacrifice of acquired rights and natural equity.  But 
the violation of individual property and written contracts is a bad preface 
to a public code.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>In fact, such violations are always cruelly punished.  In '89 and 
'93, the possessions of the nobility and the clergy were confiscated, the 
clever proletaires were enriched; and to-day the latter, having become 
aristocrats, are making us  
<pb n="330"/>  
pay dearly for our fathers' robbery.  What, therefore, is to be done now?  
It is not for us to violate right, but to restore it.  Now, it would be a 
violation of justice to dispossess some and endow others, and then stop 
there.  We must gradually lower the rate of interest, organize industry, 
associate laborers and their functions, and take a census of the large 
fortunes, not for the purpose of granting privileges, but that we may 
effect their redemption by settling a life-annuity upon their proprietors.  
We must apply on a large scale the principle of collective production, 
give the State eminent domain over all capital! make each producer 
responsible, abolish the custom-house, and transform every profession 
and trade into a public function.  Thereby large fortunes will vanish 
without confiscation or violence; individual possession will establish 
itself, without communism, under the inspection of the republic; and 
equality of conditions will no longer depend simply on the will of 
citizens. 
</p> 
<p>Of the authors who have written upon the Romans, Bossuet and 
Montesquieu occupy prominent positions in the first rank; the first being 
generally regarded as the father of the philosophy of history, and the 
second as the most profound writer upon law and politics.  Nevertheless, 
it could be shown that these two great writers, each of them imbued with 
the prejudices of their century and their cloth, have left the question of 
the causes of the rise and fall of the Romans precisely where they found 
it. 
</p> 
<p>Bossuet is admirable as long as he confines himself to description: 
witness, among other passages, the picture which he has given us of 
Greece before the Persian War, and which seems to have inspired 
&ldquo;Telemachus;&rdquo; the parallel between Athens and Sparta, 
drawn twenty times since Bossuet; the description of the character and 
morals of the ancient Ro 
<pb n="331"/>  
mans; and, finally, the sublime peroration which ends the 
&ldquo;Discourse on Universal History.&rdquo;  But when the famous 
historian deals with causes, his philosophy is at fault. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The tribunes always favored the division of captured 
lands, or the proceeds of their sale, among the citizens.  The Senate 
steadfastly opposed those laws which were damaging to the State, and 
wanted the price of lands to be awarded to the public treasury.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Thus, according to Bossuet, the first and greatest wrong of civil 
wars was inflicted upon the people, who, dying of hunger, demanded 
that the lands, which they had shed their blood to conquer, should be 
given to them for cultivation.  The patricians, who bought them to 
deliver to their slaves, had more regard for justice and the public 
interests.  How little affects the opinions of men!  If the 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;les</hi> of Cicero and the Gracchi had been inverted, 
Bossuet, whose sympathies were aroused by the eloquence of the great 
orator more than by the clamors of the tribunes, would have viewed the 
agrarian laws in quite a different light.  He then would have understood 
that the interest of the treasury was only a pretext; that, when the 
captured lands were put up at auction, the patricians hastened to buy 
them, in order to profit by the revenues from them, &mdash; certain, moreover, 
that the price paid would come back to them sooner or later, in exchange 
either for supplies furnished by them to the republic, or for the 
subsistence of the multitude, who could buy only of them, and whose 
services at one time, and poverty at another, were rewarded by the State.  
For a State does not hoard; on the contrary, the public funds always 
return to the people.  If, then, a certain number of men are the sole 
dealers in articles of primary necessity, it follows that the public 
treasury, in passing and repassing through their hands, deposits and 
accumulates real property there. 
 
<pb n="332"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>When Menenius related to the people his fable of the limbs and the 
stomach, if any one had remarked to this story-teller that the stomach 
freely gives to the limbs the nourishment which it freely receives, but 
that the patricians gave to the plebeians only for cash, and lent to them 
only at usury, he undoubtedly would have silenced the wily senator, and 
saved the people from a great imposition.  The Conscript Fathers were 
fathers only of their own line.  As for the common people, they were 
regarded as an impure race, exploitable, taxable, and workable at the 
discretion and mercy of their masters. 
</p> 
<p>As a general thing, Bossuet shows little regard for the people.  His 
monarchical and theological instincts know nothing but authority, 
obedience, and alms-giving, under the name of charity.  This unfortunate 
disposition constantly leads him to mistake symptoms for causes; and his 
depth, which is so much admired, is borrowed from his authors, and 
amounts to very little, after all.  When he says, for instance, that 
&ldquo;the dissensions in the republic, and finally its fall, were caused 
by the jealousies of its citizens, and their love of liberty carried to an 
extreme and intolerable extent,&rdquo; are we not tempted to ask him 
what caused those <hi rend="italic">jealousies</hi>? &mdash; what inspired the people 
with that <hi rend="italic">love of liberty, extreme and intolerable</hi>?  It 
would be useless to reply, The corruption of morals; the disregard for 
the ancient poverty; the debaucheries, luxury, and class jealousies; the 
seditious character of the Gracchi, &amp;c.  Why did the morals become 
corrupt, and whence arose those eternal dissensions between the 
patricians and the plebeians? 
</p> 
<p>In Rome, as in all other places, the dissension between the rich 
and the poor was not caused directly by the desire for wealth (people, as 
a general thing, do not covet that which they deem it illegitimate to 
acquire), but by a natural instinct  
<pb n="333"/>  
of the plebeians, which led them to seek the cause of their adversity in 
the constitution of the republic.  So we are doing to-day; instead of 
altering our public economy, we demand an electoral reform.  The 
Roman people wished to return to the social compact; they asked for 
reforms, and demanded a revision of the laws, and a creation of new 
magistracies.  The patricians, who had nothing to complain of, opposed 
every innovation.  Wealth always has been conservative.  Nevertheless, 
the people overcame the resistance of the Senate; the electoral right was 
greatly extended; the privileges of the plebeians were increased, &mdash; they 
had their representatives, their tribunes, and their consuls; but, 
notwithstanding these reforms, the republic could not be saved.  When 
all political expedients had been exhausted, when civil war had depleted 
the population, when the C&aelig;sars had thrown their bloody mantle 
over the cancer which was consuming the empire, &mdash; inasmuch as 
accumulated property always was respected, and since the fire never 
stopped, the nation had to perish in the flames.  The imperial power was 
a compromise which protected the property of the rich, and nourished 
the proletaires with wheat from Africa and Sicily: a double error, which 
destroyed the aristocrats by plethora and the commoners by famine.  At 
last there was but one real proprietor left, &mdash; the emperor, &mdash; whose 
dependent, flatterer, parasite, or slave, each citizen became; and when 
this proprietor was ruined, those who gathered the crumbs from under 
his table, and laughed when he cracked his jokes, perished also. 
</p> 
<p>Montesquieu succeeded no better than Bossuet in fathoming the 
causes of the Roman decline; indeed, it may be said that the president 
has only developed the ideas of the bishop.  If the Romans had been 
more moderate in their conquests, more just to their allies, more humane 
to the vanquished;  
<pb n="334"/>  
if the nobles had been less covetous, the emperors less lawless, the 
people less violent, and all classes less corrupt; if . . . &amp;c., &mdash; perhaps 
the dignity of the empire might have been preserved, and Rome might 
have retained the sceptre of the world!  That is all that can be gathered 
from the teachings of Montesquieu.  But the truth of history does not lie 
there; the destinies of the world are not dependent upon such trivial 
causes.  The passions of men, like the contingencies of time and the 
varieties of climate, serve to maintain the forces which move humanity 
and produce all historical changes; but they do not explain them.  The 
grain of sand of which Pascal speaks would have caused the death of one 
man only, had not prior action ordered the events of which this death 
was the precursor. 
</p> 
<p>Montesquieu has read extensively; he knows Roman history 
thoroughly, is perfectly well acquainted with the people of whom he 
speaks, and sees very clearly why they were able to conquer their rivals 
and govern the world.  While reading him we admire the Romans, but 
we do not like them; we witness their triumphs without pleasure, and we 
watch their fall without sorrow.  Montesquieu's work, like the works of 
all French writers, is skilfully composed, &mdash; spirited, witty, and filled 
with wise observations.  He pleases, interests, instructs, but leads to little 
reflection; he does not conquer by depth of thought; he does not exalt the 
mind by elevated reason or earnest feeling.  In vain should we search his 
writings for knowledge of antiquity, the character of primitive society, or 
a description of the heroic ages, whose morals and prejudices lived until 
the last days of the republic.  Vico, painting the Romans with their 
horrible traits, represents them as excusable, because he shows that all 
their conduct was governed by preexisting ideas and customs, and that 
they were in 
<pb n="335"/>  
formed, so to speak, by a superior genius of which they were 
unconscious; in Montesquieu, the Roman atrocity revolts, but is not 
explained.  Therefore, as a writer, Montesquieu brings greater credit 
upon French literature; as a philosopher, Vico bears away the palm. 
</p> 
<p>Originally, property in Rome was national, not private.  Numa was 
the first to establish individual property by distributing the lands captured 
by Romulus.  What was the dividend of this distribution effected by 
Numa?  What conditions were imposed upon individuals, what powers 
reserved to the State?  None whatever.  Inequality of fortunes, absolute 
abdication by the republic of its right of eminent domain over the 
property of citizens, &mdash; such were the first results of the division of 
Numa, who justly may be regarded as the originator of Roman 
revolutions.  He it was who instituted the worship of the god Terminus, --the guardian of private possession, and one of the most ancient gods of 
Italy.  It was Numa who placed property under the protection of Jupiter; 
who, in imitation of the Etrurians, wished to make priests of the land-surveyors; who invented a liturgy for cadastral operations, and 
ceremonies of consecration for the marking of boundaries, &mdash; who, in 
short, made a religion of property.[1]  All these fancies would have been 
more beneficial than dangerous, if the holy king had not forgotten one 
essential thing; namely, to fix the amount that each citizen could possess, 
and on what conditions he could possess it.  For, since it is the essence 
of property to continually increase by accession and profit, and since the 
lender will take advantage of every opportunity to apply this principle 
inherent in prop- 
 
[1]  Similar or analogous customs have existed among all nations.  
Consult, among other works, &ldquo;Origin of French Law,&rdquo; by 
M. Michelet; and &ldquo;Antiquities of German Law,&rdquo; by 
Grimm. 
 
 
 
<pb n="336"/>  
erty, it follows that properties tend, by means of their natural energy and 
the religious respect which protects them, to absorb each other, and 
fortunes to increase or diminish to an indefinite extent, &mdash; a process 
which necessarily results in the ruin of the people, and the fall of the 
republic.  Roman history is but the development of this law. 
</p> 
<p>Scarcely had the Tarquins been banished from Rome and the 
monarchy abolished, when quarrels commenced between the orders.  In 
the year 494 B.C., the secession of the commonalty to the Mons Sacer 
led to the establishment of the tribunate.  Of what did the plebeians 
complain?  That they were poor, exhausted by the interest which they 
paid to the proprietors, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">f&oelig;neratoribus;</hi> that the 
republic, administered for the benefit of the nobles, did nothing for the 
people; that, delivered over to the mercy of their creditors, who could 
sell them and their children, and having neither hearth nor home, they 
were refused the means of subsistence, while the rate of interest was kept 
at its highest point, &amp;c.  For five centuries, the sole policy of the Senate 
was to evade these just complaints; and, notwithstanding the energy of 
the tribunes, notwithstanding the eloquence of the Gracchi, the violence 
of Marius, and the triumph of C&aelig;sar, this execrable policy 
succeeded only too well.  The Senate always temporized; the measures 
proposed by the tribunes might be good, but they were inopportune.  It 
admitted that something should be done; but first it was necessary that 
the people should resume the performance of their duties, because the 
Senate could not yield to violence, and force must be employed only by 
the law.  If the people &mdash; out of respect for legality &mdash; took this beautiful 
advice, the Senate conjured up a difficulty; the reform was postponed, 
and that was the end of it.  On the contrary, if the demands of the 
proletaires  
<pb n="337"/>  
became too pressing, it declared a foreign war, and neighboring nations 
were deprived of their liberty, to maintain the Roman aristocracy. 
</p> 
<p>But the toils of war were only a halt for the plebeians in their 
onward march towards pauperism.  The lands confiscated from the 
conquered nations were immediately added to the domain of the State, to 
the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus;</hi> and, as such, cultivated for the benefit 
of the treasury; or, as was more often the case, they were sold at 
auction.  None of them were granted to the proletaires, who, unlike the 
patricians and knights, were not supplied by the victory with the means 
of buying them.  War never enriched the soldier; the extensive 
plundering has been done always by the generals.  The vans of 
Augereau, and of twenty others, are famous in our armies; but no one 
ever heard of a private getting rich.  Nothing was more common in 
Rome than charges of peculation, extortion, embezzlement, and 
brigandage, carried on in the provinces at the head of armies, and in 
other public capacities.  All these charges were quieted by intrigue, 
bribery of the judges, or desistance of the accuser.  The culprit was 
allowed always in the end to enjoy his spoils in peace; his son was only 
the more respected on account of his father's crimes.  And, in fact, it 
could not be otherwise.  What would become of us, if every deputy, 
peer, or public functionary should be called upon to show his title to his 
fortune! 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The patricians arrogated the exclusive enjoyment of the 
<hi rend="italic">ager publicus;</hi> and, like the feudal seigniors, granted some 
portions of their lands to their dependants, &mdash; a wholly precarious 
concession, revocable at the will of the grantor.  The plebeians, on the 
contrary, were entitled to the enjoyment of only a little pasture-land left 
to them in common: an utterly unjust state of things, since, in 
consequence of it, taxation &mdash; <hi rend="italic">census</hi> &mdash; weighed more 
heavily upon the poor than upon the rich.  The patrician, in fact, always 
exempted himself from the tithe which he owed  
<pb n="338"/>  
as the price and as the acknowledgment of the concession of domain; 
and, on the other hand, paid no taxes on his <hi rend="italic">possessions</hi>, 
if, as there is good reason to believe, only citizens' property was 
taxed.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Laboulaye: History of Property</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>In order thoroughly to understand the preceding quotation, we 
must know that the estates of <hi rend="italic">citizens</hi> &mdash; that is, estates 
independent of the public domain, whether they were obtained in the 
division of Numa, or had since been sold by the questors &mdash; were alone 
regarded as <hi rend="italic">property;</hi> upon these a tax, or 
<hi rend="italic">cense</hi>, was imposed.  On the contrary, the estates obtained 
by concessions of the public domain, of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> 
(for which a light rent was paid), were called <hi rend="italic">possessions</hi>.  
Thus, among the Romans, there was a <hi rend="italic">right of property</hi> 
and a <hi rend="italic">right of possession</hi> regulating the administration of 
all estates.  Now, what did the proletaires wish?  That the <hi rend="italic">jus 
possessionis</hi> &mdash; the simple right of possession &mdash; should be 
extended to them at the expense, as is evident, not of private property, 
but of the public domain, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">agri publici</hi>.  The proletaires, 
in short, demanded that they should be tenants of the land which they 
had conquered.  This demand, the patricians in their avarice never would 
accede to.  Buying as much of this land as they could, they afterwards 
found means of obtaining the rest as <hi rend="italic">possessions</hi>.  Upon 
this land they employed their slaves.  The people, who could not buy, on 
account of the competition of the rich, nor hire, because &mdash; cultivating 
with their own hands &mdash; they could not promise a rent equal to the 
revenue which the land would yield when cultivated by slaves, were 
always deprived of possession and property. 
</p> 
<p>Civil wars relieved, to some extent, the sufferings of the multitude.  
&ldquo;The people enrolled themselves under the banners of the 
ambitious, in order to obtain by force that which  
<pb n="339"/>  
the law refused them, &mdash; property.  A colony was the reward of a 
victorious legion.  But it was no longer the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> 
only; it was all Italy that lay at the mercy of the legions.  The 
<hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> disappeared almost entirely, . . . but the 
cause of the evil &mdash; accumulated property &mdash; became more potent than 
ever.&rdquo;  (<hi rend="italic">Laboulaye:  History of Property</hi>.) 
 
</p> 
<p>The author whom I quote does not tell us why this division of 
territory which followed civil wars did not arrest the encroachments of 
accumulated property; the omission is easily supplied.  Land is not the 
only requisite for cultivation; a working-stock is also necessary, &mdash; 
animals, tools, harnesses, a house, an advance, &amp;c.  Where did the 
colonists, discharged by the dictator who rewarded them, obtain these 
things?  From the purse of the usurers; that is, of the patricians, to 
whom all these lands finally returned, in consequence of the rapid 
increase of usury, and the seizure of estates.  Sallust, in his account of 
the conspiracy of Catiline, tells us of this fact.  The conspirators were 
old soldiers of Sylla, who, as a reward for their services, had received 
from him lands in Cisalpine Gaul, Tuscany, and other parts of the 
peninsula Less than twenty years had elapsed since these colonists, free 
of debt, had left the service and commenced farming; and already they 
were crippled by usury, and almost ruined.  The poverty caused by the 
exactions of creditors was the life of this conspiracy which well-nigh 
inflamed all Italy, and which, with a worthier chief and fairer means, 
possibly would have succeeded.  In Rome, the mass of the people were 
favorable to the conspirators &mdash; <hi rend="italic">cuncta plebes Catilin&aelig; 
incepta probabat;</hi> the allies were weary of the patricians' 
robberies; deputies from the Allobroges (the Savoyards) had come to 
Rome to appeal to the Senate in behalf of their fellow-citizens involved 
in debt; in short, the complaint against the large  
<pb n="340"/>  
proprietors was universal.  &ldquo;We call men and gods to 
witness,&rdquo; said the soldiers of Catiline, who were Roman citizens 
with not a slave among them, &ldquo;that we have taken arms neither 
against the country, nor to attack any one, but in defence of our lives 
and liberties.  Wretched, poor, most of us deprived of country, all of us 
of fame and fortune, by the violence and cruelty of usurers, we have no

<p>The bad reputation of Catiline, and his atrocious designs, the 
imprudence of his accomplices, the treason of several, the strategy of 
Cicero, the angry outbursts of Cato, and the terror of the Senate, baffled 
this enterprise, which, in furnishing a precedent for expeditions against 
the rich, would perhaps have saved the republic, and given peace to the 
world.  But Rome could not evade her destiny; the end of her expiations 
had not come.  A nation never was known to anticipate its punishment 
by a sudden and unexpected conversion.  Now, the long-continued 
crimes of the Eternal City could not be atoned for by the massacre of a 
few hundred patricians.  Catiline came to stay divine vengeance; 
therefore his conspiracy failed. 
</p> 
<p>The encroachment of large proprietors upon small proprietors, by 
the aid of usury, farm-rent, and profits of all sorts, was common 
throughout the empire.  The most honest citizens invested their money at 
high rates of interest.[2]  Cato, Cicero, Brutus, all the stoics so noted for 
their frugality, <hi rend="italic">viri frugi</hi>, &mdash;

Seneca, the teacher of virtue, &mdash; levied enormous taxes in the provinces, 
under the name of usury; and it is something remarkable, that the last 
defenders of the republic, the proud Pompeys, were all usurious 
aristocrats, and oppressors of the poor.  But the battle of Pharsalus, 
having killed men only, without touching institutions, the encroachments 
of the large domains became every day more active.  Ever since the birth 
of Christianity, the Fathers have opposed this invasion with all their 
might.  Their writings are filled with burning curses upon this crime of 
usury, of which Christians are not always innocent.  St. Cyprian 
complains of certain bishops of his time, who, absorbed in disgraceful 
stock-jobbing operations, abandoned their churches, and went about the 
provinces appropriating lands by artifice and fraud, while lending money 
and piling up interests upon interests.[1]  Why, in the midst of this 
passion for accumulation, did not the possession of the public land, like 
private property, become concentrated in a few hands? 
</p> 
<p>By law, the domain of the State was inalienable, and consequently 
possession was always revocable; but the edict of the praetor continued it 
indefinitely, so that finally the possessions of the patricians were 
transformed into absolute property, though the name, possessions, was 
still applied to them.  This conversion, instigated by senatorial avarice; 
owed its accomplishment to the most deplorable and indiscreet policy.

citizen's possession of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> to five hundred 
acres, the amount of this possession had been fixed at as much as one 
family could cultivate, and granted on the express condition that the 
possessor should cultivate it himself, and should lease it to no one, the 
empire never would have been desolated by large estates; and 
possession, instead of increasing property, would have absorbed it.  On 
what, then, depended the establishment and maintenance of equality in 
conditions and fortunes?  On a more equitable division of the <hi rend="italic">ager 
publicus</hi>, a wiser distribution of the right of possession. 
</p> 
<p>I insist upon this point, which is of the utmost importance, because 
it gives us an opportunity to examine the history of this individual 
possession, of which I said so much in my first memoir, and which so 
few of my readers seem to have understood.  The Roman republic &mdash; 
having, as it did, the power to dispose absolutely of its territory, and to 
impose conditions upon possessors &mdash; was nearer to liberty and equality 
than any nation has been since.  If the Senate had been intelligent and 
just, &mdash; if, at the time of the retreat to the Mons Sacer, instead of the 
ridiculous farce enacted by Menenius Agrippa, a solemn renunciation of 
the right to acquire had been made by each citizen on attaining his share 
of possessions, &mdash; the republic, based upon equality of possessions and 
the duty of labor, would not, in attaining its wealth, have degenerated in 
morals; Fabricius would have enjoyed the arts without controlling artists; 
and the conquests of the ancient Romans would have been the means of 
spreading civilization, instead of the series of murders and robberies that 
they were. 
</p> 
<p>But property, having unlimited power to amass and to lease, was 
daily increased by the addition of new possessions.  From the time of 
Nero, six individuals were the sole proprietors of one-half of Roman 
Africa.  In the fifth cen 
<pb n="343"/>  
tury, the wealthy families had incomes of no less than two millions: 
some possessed as many as twenty thousand slaves.  All the authors who 
have written upon the causes of the fall of the Roman republic concur.  
M. Giraud of Aix[1] quotes the testimony of Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, 
Olympiodorus, and Photius.  Under Vespasian and Titus, Pliny, the 
naturalist, exclaimed:  &ldquo;Large estates have ruined Italy, and are 
ruining the provinces.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But it never has been understood that the extension of property was 
effected then, as it is to-day, under the aegis of the law, and by virtue of 
the constitution.  When the Senate sold captured lands at auction, it was 
in the interest of the treasury and of public welfare.  When the patricians 
bought up possessions and property, they realized the purpose of the 
Senate's decrees; when they lent at high rates of interest, they took 
advantage of a legal privilege.  &ldquo;Property,&rdquo; said the 
lender, &ldquo;is the right to enjoy even to the extent of abuse, 
<hi rend="italic">jus utendi et abutendi</hi>; that is, the right to lend at interest, 
&mdash; to lease, to acquire, and then to lease and lend again.&rdquo;  But 
property is also the right to exchange, to transfer, and to sell.  If, then, 
the social condition is such that the proprietor, ruined by usury, may be 
compelled to sell his possession, the means of his subsistence, he will 
sell it; and, thanks to the law, accumulated property &mdash; devouring and 
anthropophagous property &mdash; will be established.[2]

<p>The immediate and secondary cause of the decline of the Romans 
was, then, the internal dissensions between the two orders of the 
republic, &mdash; the patricians and the plebeians, &mdash; dissensions which gave 
rise to civil wars, proscriptions, and loss of liberty, and finally led to the 
empire; but the primary and mediate cause of their decline was the 
establishment by Numa of the institution of property.

<p>I end with an extract from a work which I have quoted several 
times already, and which has recently received a prize from the 
Academy of Moral and Political Sciences: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The concentration of property,&rdquo; says M. 
Laboulaye, &ldquo;while causing extreme poverty, forced the emperors 
to feed and amuse the people, that they might forget their misery.  
<hi rend="italic">Panem et circenses:</hi> that was the Roman law in regard to 
the poor; a dire and perhaps a necessary evil wherever a landed 
aristocracy exists. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To feed these hungry mouths, grain was brought from 
Africa and the provinces, and distributed gratuitously among the needy.  
In the time of C&aelig;sar, three hundred and twenty thousand people 
were thus fed.  Augustus saw that such a measure led directly to the 
destruction of husbandry; but to abolish these distributions was to put a 
weapon within the reach of the first aspirant for power.  The emperor 
shrank at the thought. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While grain was gratuitous, agriculture was impossible.  
Tillage gave way to pasturage, another cause of depopulation, even 
among slaves. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Finally, luxury, carried further and further every day, 
covered the soil of Italy with elegant <hi rend="italic">villas</hi>, which 
occupied whole cantons.  Gardens and groves replaced the fields, and the 
free population fled to the towns.  Husbandry disappeared almost 
entirely, and with husbandry the husbandman.  Africa furnished the 
wheat, and Greece the wine.  Tiberius complained bitterly of this evil, 
which placed the lives of the Roman people at the mercy of the winds 
and waves: that was his anxiety.  One day

later, and three hundred thousand starving men walked the streets of 
Rome: that was a revolution. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This decline of Italy and the provinces did not stop.  After 
the reign of Nero, depopulation commenced in towns as noted as Antium 
and Tarentum.  Under the reign of Pertinax, there was so much desert 
land that the emperor abandoned it, even that which belonged to the 
treasury, to whoever would cultivate it, besides exempting the farmers 
from taxation for a period of ten years.  Senators were compelled to 
invest one-third of their fortunes in real estate in Italy; but this measure 
served only to increase the evil which they wished to cure.  To force the 
rich to possess in Italy was to increase the large estates which had ruined 
the country.  And must I say, finally, that Aurelian wished to send the 
captives into the desert lands of Etruria, and that Valentinian was forced 
to settle the Alamanni on the fertile banks of the Po?&rdquo;

<p>If the reader, in running through this book, should complain of 
meeting with nothing but quotations from other works, extracts from 
journals and public lectures, comments upon laws, and interpretations of 
them, I would remind him that the very object of this memoir is to 
establish the conformity of my opinion concerning property with that 
universally held; that, far from aiming at a paradox, it has been my main 
study to follow the advice of the world; and, finally, that my sole 
pretension is to clearly formulate the general belief.  I cannot repeat it 
too often, &mdash; and I confess it with pride, &mdash; I teach absolutely nothing that 
is new; and I should regard the doctrine which I advocate as radically 
erroneous, if a single witness should testify against it. 
</p> 
<p>Let us now trace the revolutions in property among the Barbarians. 
</p> 
<p>As long as the German tribes dwelt in their forests, it did not 
occur to them to divide and appropriate the soil.  The land was held in 
common: each individual could plow, sow, and reap.  But, when the 
empire was once invaded, they bethought themselves of sharing the land, 
just as they shared  
<pb n="346"/>  
spoils after a victory.  &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; says M. Laboulaye, 
&ldquo;the expressions <hi rend="italic">sortes Burgundiorum Gothorum</hi> 
and  
<foreign lang="grk"> klhroi Ouandigwn</foreign>; hence the 
German words <hi rend="italic">allod</hi>, allodium, and <hi rend="italic">loos</hi>, 
lot, which are used in all modern languages to designate the gifts of 
chance.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Allodial property, at least with the mass of coparceners, was 
originally held, then, in equal shares; for all of the prizes were equal, 
or, at least, equivalent.  This property, like that of the Romans, was 
wholly individual, independent, exclusive, transferable, and consequently 
susceptible of accumulation and invasion.  But, instead of its being, as 
was the case among the Romans, the large estate which, through increase 
and usury, subordinated and absorbed the small one, among the 
Barbarians &mdash; fonder of war than of wealth, more eager to dispose of 
persons than to appropriate things &mdash; it was the warrior who, through 
superiority of arms, enslaved his adversary.  The Roman wanted matter; 
the Barbarian wanted man.  Consequently, in the feudal ages, rents were 
almost nothing, &mdash; simply a hare, a partridge, a pie, a few pints of wine 
brought by a little girl, or a Maypole set up within the suzerain's reach.  
In return, the vassal or incumbent had to follow the seignior to battle (a 
thing which happened almost every day), and equip and feed himself at 
his own expense.  &ldquo;This spirit of the German tribes &mdash; this spirit 
of companionship and association &mdash; governed the territory as it governed 
individuals.  The lands, like the men, were secured to a chief or seignior 
by a bond of mutual protection and fidelity.  This subjection was the 
labor of the German epoch which gave birth to feudalism.  By fair 
means or foul, every proprietor who could not be a chief was forced to 
be a vassal.&rdquo;  (<hi rend="italic">Laboulaye: History of Property</hi>.) 
</p> 
<p>By fair means or foul, every mechanic who cannot be a  
<pb n="347"/>  
master has to be a journeyman; every proprietor who is not an invader 
will be invaded; every producer who cannot, by the exploitation of other 
men, furnish products at less than their proper value, will lose his labor.  
Corporations and masterships, which are hated so bitterly, but which will 
reappear if we are not careful, are the necessary results of the principle 
of competition which is inherent in property; their organization was 
patterned formerly after that of the feudal hierarchy, which was the 
result of the subordination of men and possessions. 
</p> 
<p>The times which paved the way for the advent of feudalism and the 
reappearance of large proprietors were times of carnage and the most 
frightful anarchy.  Never before had murder and violence made such 
havoc with the human race.  The tenth century, among others, if my 
memory serves me rightly, was called the <hi rend="italic">century of iron</hi>.  
His property, his life, and the honor of his wife and children always in 
danger the small proprietor made haste to do homage to his seignior, and 
to bestow something on the church of his freehold, that he might receive 
protection and security. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Both facts and laws bear witness that from the sixth to the 
tenth century the proprietors of small freeholds were gradually 
plundered, or reduced by the encroachments of large proprietors and 
counts to the condition of either vassals or tributaries.  The Capitularies 
are full of repressive provisions; but the incessant reiteration of these 
threats only shows the perseverance of the evil and the impotency of the 
government.  Oppression, moreover, varies but little in its methods.  
The complaints of the free proprietors, and the groans of the plebeians at 
the time of the Gracchi, were one and the same.  It is said that, 
whenever a poor man refused to give his estate to the bishop, the curate, 
the count, the judge, or the centurion, these immediately sought an 
opportunity to ruin him.  They made him serve in the army until, 
completely ruined, he was induced, by fair means or foul, to give up his 
freehold.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Laboulaye: History of Property</hi>. 
 
<pb n="348"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>How many small proprietors and manufacturers have not been 
ruined by large ones through chicanery, law-suits, and competition?  
Strategy, violence, and usury, &mdash; such are the proprietor's methods of 
plundering the laborer. 
</p> 
<p>Thus we see property, at all ages and in all its forms, oscillating 
by virtue of its principle between two opposite terms, &mdash; extreme division 
and extreme accumulation. 
</p> 
<p>Property, at its first term, is almost null.  Reduced to personal 
exploitation, it is property only potentially.  At its second term, it exists 
in its perfection; then it is truly property. 
</p> 
<p>When property is widely distributed, society thrives, progresses, 
grows, and rises quickly to the zenith of its power.  Thus, the Jews, 
after leaving Babylon with Esdras and Nehemiah, soon became richer 
and more powerful than they had been under their kings.  Sparta was in 
a strong and prosperous condition during the two or three centuries 
which followed the death of Lycurgus.  The best days of Athens were 
those of the Persian war; Rome, whose inhabitants were divided from 
the beginning into two classes, &mdash; the exploiters and the exploited, &mdash; 
knew no such thing as peace. 
</p> 
<p>When property is concentrated, society, abusing itself, polluted, so 
to speak, grows corrupt, wears itself out &mdash; how shall I express this 
horrible idea? &mdash; plunges into long-continued and fatal luxury. 
</p> 
<p>When feudalism was established, society had to die of the same 
disease which killed it under the C&aelig;sars, &mdash; I mean accumulated 
property.  But humanity, created for an immortal destiny, is deathless; 
the revolutions which disturb it are purifying crises, invariably followed 
by more vigorous health.  In the fifth century, the invasion of the 
Barbarians partially restored the world to a state of natural equality.  In 
the  
<pb n="349"/>  
twelfth century, a new spirit pervading all society gave the slave his 
rights, and through justice breathed new life into the heart of nations.  It 
has been said, and often repeated, that Christianity regenerated the 
world.  That is true; but it seems to me that there is a mistake in the 
date.  Christianity had no influence upon Roman society; when the 
Barbarians came, that society had disappeared.  For such is God's curse 
upon property; every political organization based upon the exploitation of 
man .  shall perish: slave-labor is death to the race of tyrants.  The 
patrician families became extinct, as the feudal families did, and as all 
aristocracies must. 
</p> 
<p>It was in the middle ages, when a reactionary movement was 
beginning to secretly undermine accumulated property, that the influence 
of Christianity was first exercised to its full extent.  The destruction of 
feudalism, the conversion of the serf into the commoner, the 
emancipation of the communes, and the admission of the Third Estate to 
political power, were deeds accomplished by Christianity exclusively.  I 
say Christianity, not ecclesiasticism; for the priests and bishops were 
themselves large proprietors, and as such often persecuted the villeins.  
Without the Christianity of the middle ages, the existence of modern 
society could not be explained, and would not be possible.  The truth of 
this assertion is shown by the very facts which M. Laboulaye quotes, 
although this author inclines to the opposite opinion.[1] 
 
 
[1]  M. Guizot denies that Christianity alone is entitled to the glory of 
the abolition of slavery.  &ldquo;To this end,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;many causes were necessary, &mdash; the evolution of other ideas and 
other principles of civilization.&rdquo;  So general an assertion cannot 
be refuted.  Some of these ideas and causes should have been pointed 
out, that we might judge whether their source was not wholly Christian, 
or whether at least the Christian spirit had not penetrated and thus

</p> 
<p>1. <hi rend="italic">Slavery among the Romans</hi>. &mdash; &ldquo;The 
Roman slave was, in the eyes of the law, only a thing, &mdash; no more than 
an ox or a horse.  He had neither property, family, nor personality; he 
was defenceless against his master's cruelty, folly, or cupidity.  `Sell 
your oxen that are past use,' said Cato, `sell your calves, your lambs, 
your wool, your hides, your old ploughs, your old iron, your old slave, 
and your sick slave, and all that is of no use to you.'  When no market 
could be found for the slaves that were worn out by sickness or old age, 
they were abandoned to starvation.  Claudius was the first defender of 
this shameful practice.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Discharge your old workman,&rdquo; says the economist 
of the proprietary school; &ldquo;turn off that sick domestic, that 
toothless and worn-out servant.  Put away the unserviceable beauty; to 
the hospital with the useless mouths!&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The condition of these wretched beings improved but little 
under the emperors; and the best that can be said of the goodness of 
Antoninus is that he prohibited intolerable cruelty, as an <hi rend="italic">abuse of 
property.  Expedit enim reipublic&aelig; ne quis re re sua male 
utatur</hi>, says Gaius. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the Church met in council, it launched an 
anathema against the masters who had exercised over their slaves this 
terrible right of life and death.  Were not the slaves, thanks to the right 
of sanctuary and to their poverty, the dearest 
<hi rend="italic">prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</hi> of religion?  Constantine, who 
embodied in the laws the grand ideas of Christianity, valued the life of a 
slave as highly as that of a freeman, and declared the master, who had 
intentionally brought death upon his slave, guilty of murder.  Between 
this law and that of Antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral 
ideas: the slave was a thing; religion has made him a man.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Note the last words:  &ldquo;Between the law of the Gospel and 
that of Antoninus there is a complete revolution in moral ideas: the slave 
was a thing; religion has made him a man.&rdquo;  The moral 
revolution which transformed the slave into a 
 
 
fructified them.  Most of the emancipation charters begin with these 
words:  &ldquo;For the love of God and the salvation of my 
soul.&rdquo;  Now, we did not commence to love God and to think of 
our salvation until after the promulgation of the Gospel. 
 
 
 
<pb n="351"/>  
citizen was effected, then, by Christianity before the Barbarians set foot 
upon the soil of the empire.  We have only to trace the progress of this 
<hi rend="italic">moral</hi> revolution in the <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi> of society.  
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; M. Laboulaye rightly says, &ldquo;it did not 
change the condition of men in a moment, any more than that of things; 
between slavery and liberty there was an abyss which could not be filled 
in a day; the transitional step was servitude.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Now, what was servitude?  In what did it differ from Roman 
slavery, and whence came this difference?  Let the same author answer. 
 
</p> 
<p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Servitude</hi>. &mdash; &ldquo;I see, in the lord's 
manor, slaves charged with domestic duties.  Some are employed in the 
personal service of the master; others are charged with household cares.  
The women spin the wool; the men grind the grain, make the bread, or 
practise, in the interest of the seignior, what little they know of the 
industrial arts.  The master punishes them when he chooses, kills them 
with impunity, and sells them and theirs like so many cattle.  The slave 
has no personality, and consequently no <hi rend="italic">wehrgeld</hi>[1] 
peculiar to himself: he is a thing.  The <hi rend="italic">wehrgeld</hi> belongs 
to the master as a compensation for the loss of his property.  Whether 
the slave is killed or stolen, the indemnity does not change, for the 
injury is the same; but the indemnity increases or diminishes according 
to the value of the serf.  In all these particulars Germanic slavery and 
Roman servitude are alike.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>This similarity is worthy of notice.  Slavery is always the same, 
whether in a Roman villa or on a Barbarian farm.  The man, like the ox 
and the ass, is a part of the live-stock; a price is set upon his head; he is 
a tool without a conscience, a chattel without personality, an impeccable, 
irresponsible being, who has neither rights nor duties. 
 
 
[1]  <hi rend="italic">Weregild</hi>, &mdash; the fine paid for the murder of a man.  
So much for a count, so much for a baron, so much for a freeman, so 
much for a priest; for a slave, nothing.  His value was restored to the 
proprietor. 
 
 
 
<pb n="352"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Why did his condition improve? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In good season . . .&rdquo; [when ?] &ldquo;the serf 
began to be regarded as a man; and, as such, the law of the Visigoths, 
under the influence of Christian ideas, punished with fine or banishment 
any one who maimed or killed him.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Always Christianity, always religion, though we should like to 
speak of the laws only.  Did the philanthropy of the Visigoths make its 
first appearance before or after the preaching of the Gospel?  This point 
must be cleared up. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;After the conquest, the serfs were scattered over the large 
estates of the Barbarians, each having his house, his lot, and his 
peculium, in return for which he paid rent and performed service.  They 
were rarely separated from their homes when their land was sold; they 
and all that they had became the property of the purchaser.  The law 
favored this realization of the serf, in not allowing him to be sold out of 
the country.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>What inspired this law, destructive not only of slavery, but of 
property itself?  For, if the master cannot drive from his domain the 
slave whom he has once established there, it follows that the slave is 
proprietor, as well as the master. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The Barbarians,&rdquo; again says M. Laboulaye, 
&ldquo;were the first to recognize the slave's rights of family and 
property, &mdash; two rights which are incompatible with slavery.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>But was this recognition the necessary result of the mode of 
servitude in vogue among the Germanic nations previous to their 
conversion to Christianity, or was it the immediate effect of that spirit of 
justice infused with religion, by which the seignior was forced to respect 
in the serf a soul equal to his own, a brother in Jesus Christ, purified by 
the same baptism, and redeemed by the same sacrifice of the Son of God 
in the form of man?  For we must not close our eyes to the fact that, 
though the Barbarian morals and the ignorance  
<pb n="353"/>  
and carelessness of the seigniors, who busied themselves mainly with 
wars and battles, paying little or no attention to agriculture, may have 
been great aids in the emancipation of the serfs, still the vital principle of 
this emancipation was essentially Christian.  Suppose that the Barbarians 
had remained Pagans in the midst of a Pagan world.  As they did not 
change the Gospel, so they would not have changed the polytheistic 
customs; slavery would have remained what it was; they would have 
continued to kill the slaves who were desirous of liberty, family, and 
property; whole nations would have been reduced to the condition of 
Helots; nothing would have changed upon the terrestrial stage, except the 
actors.  The Barbarians were less selfish, less imperious, less dissolute, 
and less cruel than the Romans.  Such was the nature upon which, after 
the fall of the empire and the renovation of society, Christianity was to 
act.  But this nature, grounded as in former times upon slavery and war, 
would, by its own energy, have produced nothing but war and slavery. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Gradually</hi> the serfs obtained the privilege of 
being judged by the same standard as their masters. . . .&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>When, how, and by what title did they obtain this privilege? 
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Gradually</hi> their duties were regulated.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Whence came the regulations?  Who had the authority to introduce 
them? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The master took a part of the labor of the serf, &mdash; three 
days, for instance, &mdash; and left the rest to him.  As for Sunday, that 
belonged to God.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>And what established Sunday, if not religion?  Whence I infer, that 
the same power which took it upon itself to suspend hostilities and to 
lighten the duties of the serf was also  
<pb n="354"/>  
that which regulated the judiciary and created a sort of law for the slave. 
</p> 
<p>But this law itself, on what did it bear? &mdash; what was its principle? --what was the philosophy of the councils and popes with reference to 
this matter?  The reply to all these questions, coming from me alone, 
would be distrusted.  The authority of M. Laboulaye shall give credence 
to my words.  This holy philosophy, to which the slaves were indebted 
for every thing, this invocation of the Gospel, was an anathema against 
property. 
</p> 
<p>The proprietors of small freeholds, that is, the freemen of the 
middle class, had fallen, in consequence of the tyranny of the nobles, 
into a worse condition than that of the tenants and serfs.  &ldquo;The 
expenses of war weighed less heavily upon the serf than upon the 
freeman; and, as for legal protection, the seigniorial court, where the 
serf was judged by his peers, was far preferable to the cantonal 
assembly.  It was better to have a noble for a seignior than for a 
judge.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>So it is better to-day to have a man of large capital for an associate 
than for a rival.  The honest tenant &mdash; the laborer who earns weekly a 
moderate but constant salary &mdash; is more to be envied than the independent 
but small farmer, or the poor licensed mechanic. 
</p> 
<p>At that time, all were either seigniors or serfs, oppressors or 
oppressed.  &ldquo;Then, under the protection of convents, or of the 
seigniorial turret, new societies were formed, which silently spread over 
the soil made fertile by their hands, and which derived their power from 
the annihilation of the free classes whom they enlisted in their behalf.  
As tenants, these men acquired, from generation to generation, sacred 
rights over the soil which they cultivated in the interest of lazy and 
pillaging masters.  As fast as the social tempest abated, it  
<pb n="355"/>  
became necessary to respect the union and heritage of these villeins, who 
by their labor had truly prescribed the soil for their own profit.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I ask how prescription could take effect where a contrary title and 
possession already existed?  M. Laboulaye is a lawyer.  Where, then, 
did he ever see the labor of the slave and the cultivation by the tenant 
prescribe the soil for their own profit, to the detriment of a recognized 
master daily acting as a proprietor?  Let us not disguise matters.  As fast 
as the tenants and the serfs grew rich, they wished to be independent and 
free; they commenced to associate, unfurl their municipal banners, raise 
belfries, fortify their towns, and refuse to pay their seigniorial dues.  In 
doing these things they were perfectly right; for, in fact, their condition 
was intolerable.  But in law &mdash; I mean in Roman and Napoleonic law &mdash; 
their refusal to obey and pay tribute to their masters was illegitimate. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this imperceptible usurpation of property by the commonalty 
was inspired by religion. 
</p> 
<p>The seignior had attached the serf to the soil; religion granted the 
serf rights over the soil.  The seignior imposed duties upon the serf; 
religion fixed their limits.  The seignior could kill the serf with 
impunity, could deprive him of his wife, violate his daughter, pillage his 
house, and rob him of his savings; religion checked his invasions: it 
excommunicated the seignior.  Religion was the real cause of the ruin of 
feudal property.  Why should it not be bold enough to-day to resolutely 
condemn capitalistic property?  Since the middle ages, there has been no 
change in social economy except in its forms; its relations remain 
unaltered. 
</p> 
<p>The only result of the emancipation of the serfs was that property 
changed hands; or, rather, that new proprietors were  
<pb n="356"/>  
created.  Sooner or later the extension of privilege, far from curing the 
evil, was to operate to the disadvantage of the plebeians.  Nevertheless, 
the new social organization did not meet with the same end in all places.  
In Lombardy, for example, where the people rapidly growing rich 
through commerce and industry soon conquered the authorities, even to 
the exclusion of the nobles, &mdash; first, the nobility became poor and 
degraded, and were forced, in order to live and maintain their credit, to 
gain admission to the guilds; then, the ordinary subalternization of 
property leading to inequality of fortunes, to wealth and poverty, to 
jealousies and hatreds, the cities passed rapidly from the rankest 
democracy under the yoke of a few ambitious leaders.  Such was the fate 
of most of the Lombardic cities, &mdash; Genoa, Florence, Bologna, Milan, 
Pisa, &amp;c,. &mdash; which afterwards changed rulers frequently, but which have 
never since risen in favor of liberty.  The people can easily escape from 
the tyranny of despots, but they do not know how to throw off the 
effects of their own despotism; just as we avoid the assassin's steel, 
while we succumb to a constitutional malady.  As soon as a nation 
becomes proprietor, either it must perish, or a foreign invasion must 
force it again to begin its evolutionary round.[1] 
</p> 
<p> 
[1]  The spirit of despotism and monopoly which animated the 
communes has not escaped the attention of historians.  &ldquo;The 
formation of the commoners' associations,&rdquo; says Meyer, 
&ldquo;did not spring from the true spirit of liberty, but from the desire 
for exemption from the charges of the seigniors, from individual 
interests, and jealousy of the welfare of others. . . .  Each commune or 
corporation opposed the creation of every other; and this spirit increased 
to such an extent that the King of England, Henry V., having established 
a university at Caen, in 1432, the city and university of Paris opposed 
the registration of the edict. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The communes once organized, the kings treated them as 
superior vassals.  Now, just as the under vassal had no communication 
with the king except  
 
 
<pb n="357"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>In France, the Revolution was much more gradual.  The 
communes, in taking refuge under the protection of the kings, had found 
them masters rather than protectors.  Their liberty had long since been 
lost, or, rather, their emancipation had been suspended, when feudalism 
received its death-blow at the hand of Richelieu.  Then liberty halted; the 
prince of the feudatories held sole and undivided sway.  The nobles, the 
clergy, the commoners, the parliaments, every thing in short except a 
few seeming privileges, were controlled by the king; who, like his early 
predecessors, consumed regularly, and nearly always in advance, the 
revenues of his domain, &mdash; and that domain was France.  Finally, '89 
arrived; liberty resumed its march; a century and a half had been 
required to wear out the last form of feudal property, &mdash; monarchy. 
</p> 
<p>The French Revolution may be defined as <hi rend="italic">the substitution of 
real right for personal right;</hi> that is to say, in the days of 
feudalism, the value of property depended upon the standing of the 
proprietor, while, after the Revolution, the regard for the man was 
proportional to his property.  Now, we have seen from what has been 
said in the preceding pages, that this recognition of the right of laborers 
had been the constant aim of the serfs and communes, the secret motive 
of their 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued]> 
<lb/> 
through the direct vassal, so also the commoners could enter no 
complaints except through the commune. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Like causes produce like effects.  Each commune became 
a small and separate State, governed by a few citizens, who sought to 
extend their authority over the others; who, in their turn, revenged 
themselves upon the unfortunate inhabitants who had not the right of 
citizenship.  Feudalism in unemancipated countries, and oligarchy in the 
communes, made nearly the same ravages.  There were sub-associations, 
fraternities, tradesmen's associations in the communes, and colleges in 
the universities.  The oppression was so great, that it was no rare thing 
to see the inhabitants of a commune demanding its 
suppression. . . .&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Meyer:  Judicial Institutions of 
Europe</hi>. 
 
 
 
<pb n="358"/>  
efforts.  The movement of '89 was only the last stage of that long 
insurrection.  But it seems to me that we have not paid sufficient 
attention to the fact that the Revolution of 1789, instigated by the same 
causes, animated by the same spirit, triumphing by the same struggles, 
was consummated in Italy four centuries ago.  Italy was the first to 
sound the signal of war against feudalism; France has followed; Spain 
and England are beginning to move; the rest still sleep.  If a grand 
example should be given to the world, the day of trial would be much 
abridged. 
</p> 
<p>Note the following summary of the revolutions of property, from 
the days of the Roman Empire down to the present time: &mdash;  
 
1. <hi rend="italic">Fifth Century</hi>. &mdash;  Barbarian invasions; division of the 
lands of the empire into independent portions or freeholds.   
 
2. <hi rend="italic">From the fifth to the eighth Century</hi>. &mdash; Gradual 
concentration of freeholds, or transformation of the small freeholds into 
fiefs, feuds, tenures, &amp;c.  Large properties, small possessions.  
Charlemagne (771-814) decrees that all freeholds are dependent upon the 
king of France. 
 
3. <hi rend="italic">From the eighth to the tenth Century</hi>. &mdash; The relation 
between the crown and the superior dependents is broken; the latter 
becoming freeholders, while the smaller dependents cease to recognize 
the king, and adhere to the nearest suzerain.  Feudal system. 
 
4. <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Century</hi>. &mdash; Movement of the serfs towards 
liberty; emancipation of the communes. 
 
5. <hi rend="italic">Thirteenth Century</hi>. &mdash; Abolition of personal right, and 
of the feudal system in Italy.  Italian Republics. 
 
6. <hi rend="italic">Seventeenth Century</hi>. &mdash; Abolition of feudalism in 
France during Richelieu's ministry.  Despotism. 
 
 
<pb n="359"/>  
 
7. 1789. &mdash; Abolition of all privileges of birth, caste, provinces, and 
corporations; equality of persons and of rights.  French democracy. 
 
8. 1830. &mdash; The principle of concentration inherent in individual property 
is <hi rend="italic">remarked</hi>.  Development of the idea of association. 
 
</p> 
<p>The more we reflect upon this series of transformations and 
changes, the more clearly we see that they were necessary in their 
principle, in their manifestations, and in their result. 
</p> 
<p>It was necessary that inexperienced conquerors, eager for liberty, 
should divide the Roman Empire into a multitude of estates, as free and 
independent as themselves. 
</p> 
<p>It was necessary that these men, who liked war even better than 
liberty, should submit to their leaders; and, as the freehold represented 
the man, that property should violate property. 
</p> 
<p>It was necessary that, under the rule of a nobility always idle when 
not fighting, there should grow up a body of laborers, who, by the 
power of production, and by the division and circulation of wealth, 
would gradually gain control over commerce, industry, and a portion of 
the land, and who, having become rich, would aspire to power and 
authority also. 
</p> 
<p>It was necessary, finally, that liberty and equality of rights having 
been achieved, and individual property still existing, attended by 
robbery, poverty, social inequality, and oppression, there should be an 
inquiry into the cause of this evil, and an idea of universal association 
formed, whereby, on condition of labor, all interests should be protected 
and consolidated. 
 
<pb n="360"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Evil, when carried too far,&rdquo; says a learned jurist, 
&ldquo;cures itself; and the political innovation which aims to increase 
the power of the State, finally succumbs to the effects of its own work.  
The Germans, to secure their independence, chose chiefs; and soon they 
were oppressed by their kings and noblemen.  The monarchs surrounded 
themselves with volunteers, in order to control the freemen; and they 
found themselves dependent upon their proud vassals.  The <hi rend="italic">missi 
dominici</hi> were sent into the provinces to maintain the power of 
the emperors, and to protect the people from the oppressions of the 
noblemen; and not only did they usurp the imperial power to a great 
extent, but they dealt more severely with the inhabitants.  The freemen 
became vassals, in order to get rid of military service and court duty; 
and they were immediately involved in all the personal quarrels of their 
seigniors, and compelled to do jury duty in their courts. . . .  The kings 
protected the cities and the communes, in the hope of freeing them from 
the yoke of the grand vassals, and of rendering their own power more 
absolute; and those same communes have, in several European countries, 
procured the establishment of a constitutional power, are now holding 
royalty in check, and are giving rise to a universal desire for political 
reform.&rdquo; &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Meyer: Judicial Institutions of Europe</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>In recapitulation. 
</p> 
<p>What was feudalism?  A confederation of the grand seign iors 
against the villeins, and against the king.[1] What is constitutional 
government?  A confederation of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> against 
the laborers, and against the king.[2] 
 
 
[1]  Feudalism was, in spirit and in its providential destiny, a long 
protest of the human personality against the monkish communism with 
which Europe, in the middle ages, was overrun.  After the orgies of 
Pagan selfishness, society &mdash; carried to the opposite extreme by the 
Christian religion &mdash; risked its life by unlimited self-denial and absolute 
indifference to the pleasures of the world.  Feudalism was the balance-weight which saved Europe from the combined influence of the religious 
communities and the Manlchean sects which had sprung up since the 
fourth century under different names and in different countries.  Modern 
civilization is indebted to feudalism for the definitive establishment of the 
person, of marriage, of the family, and of country.  (See, on this 
subject, Guizot, &ldquo;History of Civilization in Europe.&rdquo;) 
 
[2]  This was made evident in July, 1830, and the years which followed 
it, when the electoral <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> effected a revolution in 
order to get control over 
 
 
 
<pb n="361"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>How did feudalism end?  In the union of the communes and the 
royal authority.  How will the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> aristocracy end?  
In the union of the proletariat and the sovereign power. 
</p> 
<p>What was the immediate result of the struggle of the communes 
and the king against the seigniors?  The monarchical unity of Louis XIV.  
What will be the result of the struggle of the proletariat and the 
sovereign power combined against the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>?  The 
absolute unity of the nation and the government. 
</p> 
<p>It remains to be seen whether the nation, one and supreme, will be 
represented in its executive and central power by <hi rend="italic">one</hi>, by 
<hi rend="italic">five</hi>, by <hi rend="italic">one hundred</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">one 
thousand;</hi> that is, it remains to be seen, whether the royalty of 
the barricades intends to maintain itself by the people, or without the 
people, and whether Louis Philippe wishes his reign to be the most 
famous in all history. 
</p> 
<p>I have made this statement as brief, but at the same time

the king, and suppressed the <hi rend="italic">&eacute;meutes</hi> in order to 
restrain the people.  The <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>, through the jury, the 
magistracy, its position in the army, and its municipal despotism, 
governs both royalty and the people.  It is the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> 
which, more than any other class, is conservative and retrogressive.  It is 
the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> which makes and unmakes ministries.  It is 
the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> which has destroyed the influence of the 
Upper Chamber, and which will dethrone the King whenever he shall 
become unsatisfactory to it.  It is to please the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> 
that royalty makes itself unpopular.  It is the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> 
which is troubled at the hopes of the people, and which hinders reform.  
The journals of the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> are the ones which preach 
morality and religion to us, while reserving scepticism and indifference 
for themselves; which attack personal government, and favor the denial 
of the electoral privilege to those who have no property.  The 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> will accept any thing rather than the 
emancipation of the proletariat.  As soon as it thinks its privileges 
threatened, it will unite with royalty; and who does not know that at this 
very moment these two antagonists have suspended their quarrels? . . .  
It has been a question of property. 
 
<pb n="362"/>  
as accurate as I could, neglecting facts and details, that I might give the 
more attention to the economical relations of society.  For the study of 
history is like the study of the human organism; just as the latter has its 
system, its organs, and its functions, which can be treated separately, so 
the former has its <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi>, its instruments, and its 
causes.  Of course I do not pretend that the principle of property is a 
complete <hi rend="italic">r&eacute;sum&eacute;</hi> of all the social forces; 
but, as in that wonderful machine which we call our body, the harmony 
of the whole allows us to draw a general conclusion from the 
consideration of a single function or organ, so, in discussing historical 
causes, I have been able to reason with absolute accuracy from a single 
order of facts, certain as I was of the perfect correlation which exists 
between this special order and universal history.  As is the property of a 
nation, so is its family, its marriage, its religion, its civil and military 
organization, and its legislative and judicial institutions.  History, viewed 
from this standpoint, is a grand and sublime psychological study. 
</p> 
<p>Well, sir, in writing against property, have I done more than quote 
the language of history?  I have said to modern society, &mdash; the daughter 
and heiress of all preceding societies, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">Age guod agis:</hi> 
complete the task which for six thousand years you have been executing 
under the inspiration and by the command of God; hasten to finish your 
journey; turn neither to the right nor the left, but follow the road which 
lies before you.  You seek reason, law, unity, and discipline; but 
hereafter you can find them only by stripping off the veils of your 
infancy, and ceasing to follow instinct as a guide.  Awaken your sleeping 
conscience; open your eyes to the pure light of reflection and science; 
behold the phantom which troubled your dreams, and so long kept you in 
a state  
<pb n="363"/>  
of unutterable anguish.  Know thyself, O long-deluded society[1] know 
thy enemy! . . .  And I have denounced property. 
</p> 
<p>We often hear the defenders of the right of domain quote in 
defence of their views the testimony of nations and ages.  We can judge, 
from what has just been said, how far this historical argument conforms 
to the real facts and the conclusions of science. 
</p> 
<p>To complete this apology, I must examine the various theories. 
</p> 
<p>Neither politics, nor legislation, nor history, can be explained and 
understood, without a positive theory which defines their elements, and 
discovers their laws; in short, without a philosophy.  Now, the two 
principal schools, which to this day divide the attention of the world, do 
not satisfy this condition. 
</p> 
<p>The first, essentially <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> in its character, 
confined to a statement of facts, and buried in learning, cares very little 
by what laws humanity develops itself.  To it these laws are the secret of 
the Almighty, which no one can fathom without a commission from on 
high.  In applying the facts of history to government, this school does 
not reason; it does not anticipate; it makes no comparison of the past 
with the present, in order to predict the future.  In its opinion, the 
lessons of experience teach us only to repeat old errors, and its whole 
philosophy consists in perpetually retracing the tracks of antiquity, 
instead of going straight ahead forever in the direction in which they 
point. 
</p> 
<p>The second school may be called either <hi rend="italic">fatalistic</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">pantheistic</hi>.  To it the movements of empires and the 
revolutions of humanity are the manifestations, the incarnations, of the 
Almighty.  The human race, identified with the divine  
<pb n="364"/>  
essence, wheels in a circle of appearances, informations, and 
destructions, which necessarily excludes the idea of absolute truth, and 
destroys providence and liberty. 
</p> 
<p>Corresponding to these two schools of history, there are two 
schools of jurisprudence, similarly opposed, and possessed of the same 
peculiarities. 
</p> 
<p>1. The practical and conventional school, to which the law is 
always a creation of the legislator, an expression of his will, a privilege 
which he condescends to grant, &mdash; in short, a gratuitous affirmation to be 
regarded as judicious and legitimate, no matter what it declares. 
</p> 
<p>2. The fatalistic and pantheistic school, sometimes called the 
historical school, which opposes the despotism of the first, and maintains 
that law, like literature and religion, is always the expression of society, 
&mdash; its manifestation, its form, the external realization of its mobile spirit 
and its ever-changing inspirations. 
</p> 
<p>Each of these schools, denying the absolute, rejects thereby all 
positive and <hi rend="italic">&agrave; priori</hi> philosophy. 
</p> 
<p>Now, it is evident that the theories of these two schools, whatever 
view we take of them, are utterly unsatisfactory: for, opposed, they form 
no dilemma, &mdash; that is, if one is false, it does not follow that the other is 
true; and, united, they do not constitute the truth, since they disregard 
the absolute, without which there is no truth.  They are respectively a 
<hi rend="italic">thesis</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">antithesis</hi>.  There remains to be 
found, then, a <hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi>, which, predicating the absolute, 
justifies the will of the legislator, explains the variations of the law, 
annihilates the theory of the circular movement of humanity, and 
demonstrates its progress. 
</p> 
<p>The legists, by the very nature of their studies and in spite of their 
obstinate prejudices, have been led irresistibly to sus 
<pb n="365"/>  
pect that the absolute in the science of law is not as chimerical as is 
commonly supposed; and this suspicion arose from their comparison of 
the various relations which legislators have been called upon to regulate. 
</p> 
<p>M. Laboulaye, the laureate of the Institute, begins his 
&ldquo;History of Property&rdquo; with these words: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;While the law of contract, which regulates only the mutual 
interests of men, has not varied for centuries (except in certain forms 
which relate more to the proof than to the character of the obligation), 
the civil law of property, which regulates the mutual relations of 
citizens, has undergone several radical changes, and has kept pace in its 
variations with all the vicissitudes of society.  The law of contract, 
which holds essentially to those principles of eternal justice which are 
engraven upon the depths of the human heart, is the immutable element 
of jurisprudence, and, in a certain sense, its philosophy.  Property, on 
the contrary, is the variable element of jurisprudence, its history, its 
policy.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Marvellous!  There is in law, and consequently in politics, 
something variable and something invariable.  The invariable element is 
obligation, the bond of justice, duty; the variable element is property, &mdash; 
that is, the external form of law, the subject-matter of the contract.  
Whence it follows that the law can modify, change, reform, and judge 
property.  Reconcile that, if you can, with the idea of an eternal, 
absolute, permanent, and indefectible right. 
</p> 
<p>However, M. Laboulaye is in perfect accord with himself when he 
adds, &ldquo;Possession of the soil rests solely upon force until society 
takes it in hand, and espouses the cause of the possessor;&rdquo;[1] and, 
a little farther, &ldquo;The right of property is 
 
 
[1]  The same opinion was recently expressed from the tribune by one of 
our most honorable Deputies, M. Gauguier.  &ldquo;Nature,&rdquo; 
said he, &ldquo;has not endowed man with landed property.&rdquo;  
Changing the adjective <hi rend="italic">landed</hi>, which designates only a 
species into <hi rend="italic">capitalistic</hi>, which denotes the genus, &mdash; M. 
Gauguier made an <hi rend="italic">&eacute;galitaire</hi> profession of faith. 
 
 
 
<pb n="366"/>  
not natural, but social.  The laws not only protect property: they give it 
birth,&rdquo; &amp;c.  Now, that which the law has made the law can 
unmake; especially since, according to M. Laboulaye, &mdash; an avowed 
partisan of the historical or pantheistic school, &mdash; the law is not absolute, 
is not an idea, but a form. 
</p> 
<p>But why is it that property is variable, and, unlike obligation, 
incapable of definition and settlement?  Before affirming, somewhat 
boldly without doubt, that in right there are no absolute principles (the 
most dangerous, most immoral, most tyrannical &mdash; in a word, most anti-social &mdash; assertion imaginable), it was proper that the right of property 
should be subjected to a thorough examination, in order to put in 
evidence its variable, arbitrary, and contingent elements, and those which 
are eternal, legitimate, and absolute; then, this operation performed, it 
became easy to account for the laws, and to correct all the codes. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this examination of property I claim to have made, and in 
the fullest detail; but, either from the public's lack of interest in an 
unrecommended and unattractive pamphlet, or &mdash; which is more probable 
&mdash; from the weakness of exposition and want of genius which 
characterize the work, the First Memoir on Property passed unnoticed; 
scarcely would a few communists, having turned its leaves, deign to 
brand it with their disapprobation.  You alone, sir, in spite of the 
disfavor which I showed for your economical predecessors in too severe 
a criticism of them, &mdash; you alone have judged me justly; and although I 
cannot accept, at least literally, your first judgment, yet it is to you alone 
that I appeal from a decision too equivocal to be regarded as final. 
</p> 
<p>It not being my intention to enter at present into a discussion of 
principles, I shall content myself with estimating, from the point of view 
of this simple and intelligible abso 
<pb n="367"/>  
lute, the theories of property which our generation has produced. 
</p> 
<p>The most exact idea of property is given us by the Roman law, 
faithfully followed in this particular by the ancient legists.  It is the 
absolute, exclusive, autocratic domain of a man over a thing, &mdash; a domain 
which begins by <hi rend="italic">usucaption</hi>, is maintained by 
<hi rend="italic">possession</hi>, and finally, by the aid of 
<hi rend="italic">prescription</hi>, finds its sanction in the civil law; a domain 
which so identifies the man with the thing, that the proprietor can say, 
&ldquo;He who uses my field, virtually compels me to labor for him; 
therefore he owes me compensation.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I pass in silence the secondary modes by which property can be 
acquired, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">tradition, sale, exchange, inheritance</hi>, &amp;c., &mdash; 
which have nothing in common with the origin of property. 
</p> 
<p>Accordingly, Pothier said <hi rend="italic">the domain of property</hi>, 
and not simply <hi rend="italic">property</hi>.  And the most learned writers on 
jurisprudence &mdash; in imitation of the Roman praetor who recognized a 
<hi rend="italic">right of property</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">right of possession</hi> &mdash; 
have carefully distinguished between the <hi rend="italic">domain</hi> and the 
right of <hi rend="italic">usufruct, use</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">habitation</hi>, which, 
reduced to its natural limits, is the very expression of justice; and which 
is, in my opinion, to supplant domanial property, and finally form the 
basis of all jurisprudence. 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, admire the clumsiness of systems, or rather the fatality of 
logic!  While the Roman law and all the <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> inspired 
by it teach that property in its origin is the right of first occupancy 
sanctioned by law, the modern legists, dissatisfied with this brutal 
definition, claim that property is based upon <hi rend="italic">labor</hi>.  
Immediately they infer that he who no longer labors, but makes another 
labor in his stead, loses his right to the earnings of the latter.  It is by 
virtue of this  
<pb n="368"/>  
principle that the serfs of the middle ages claimed a legal right to 
property, and consequently to the enjoyment of political rights; that the 
clergy were despoiled in '89 of their immense estates, and were granted 
a pension in exchange; that at the restoration the liberal deputies opposed 
the indemnity of one billion francs.  &ldquo;The nation,&rdquo; said 
they, &ldquo;has acquired by twenty-five years of labor and possession 
the property which the emigrants forfeited by abandonment and long 
idleness: why should the nobles be treated with more favor than the 
priests?&rdquo;[1] 
</p> 
<p>All usurpations, not born of war, have been caused and supported 
by labor.  All modern history proves this, from the end of the Roman 
empire down to the present day.  And as if to give a sort of legal 
sanction to these usurpations, the doctrine of labor, subversive of 
property, is professed at great length in the Roman law under the name 
of <hi rend="italic">prescription</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>The man who cultivates, it has been said, makes the land his own; 
consequently, no more property.  This was clearly seen by the old 
jurists, who have not failed to denounce this novelty; while on the other 
hand the young school hoots at the absurdity of the first-occupant theory.  
Others have pre- 
 
[1]  A professor of comparative legislation, M. Lerminier, has gone still 
farther.  He has dared to say that the nation took from the clergy all 
their possessions, not because of <hi rend="italic">idleness</hi>, but because of 
<hi rend="italic">unworthiness</hi>.  &ldquo;You have civilized the 
world,&rdquo; cries this apostle of equality, speaking to the priests; 
&ldquo;and for that reason your possessions were given you.  In your 
hands they were at once an instrument and a reward.  But you do not 
now deserve them, for you long since ceased to civilize any thing 
whatever. . . .&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>This position is quite in harmony with my principles, and I heartily 
applaud the indignation of M. Lerminier; but I do not know that a 
proprietor was ever deprived of his property because 
<hi rend="italic">unworthy;</hi> and as reasonable, social, and even useful as the 
thing may seem, it is quite contrary to the uses and customs of property. 
 
 
 
<pb n="369"/>  
sented themselves, pretending to reconcile the two opinions by uniting 
them.  They have failed, like all the <hi rend="italic">juste-milieux</hi> of the 
world, and are laughed at for their eclecticism.  At present, the alarm is 
in the camp of the old doctrine; from all sides pour in <hi rend="italic">defences of 
property, studies regarding property, theories of property</hi>, each 
one of which, giving the lie to the rest, inflicts a fresh wound upon 
property. 
</p> 
<p>Consider, indeed, the inextricable embarrassments, the 
contradictions, the absurdities, the incredible nonsense, in which the bold 
defenders of property so lightly involve themselves.  I choose the 
eclectics, because, those killed, the others cannot survive. 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong, jurist, passes for a philosopher in the eyes of the 
editors of &ldquo;Le Droit.&rdquo;  I tell the gentlemen of &ldquo;Le 
Droit&rdquo; that, in the judgment of philosophers, M. Troplong is only 
an advocate; and I prove my assertion. 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong is a defender of progress.  &ldquo;The words of the 
code,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;are fruitful sap with which the classic 
works of the eighteenth century overflow.  To wish to suppress 
them . . . is to violate the law of progress, and to forget that a science 
which moves is a science which grows.&rdquo;[1] 
</p> 
<p>Now, the only mutable and progressive portion of law, as we have 
already seen, is that which concerns property.  If, then, you ask what 
reforms are to be introduced into the right of property?  M. Troplong 
makes no reply; what progress is to be hoped for? no reply; what is to 
be the destiny of property in case of universal association? no reply; 
what is the absolute and what the contingent, what the true and what the 
false, in property? no reply.  M. Troplong favors quies- 
 
[1]  &ldquo;Treatise on Prescription.&rdquo; 
 
 
 
<pb n="370"/>  
cence and <hi rend="italic">in statu quo</hi> in regard to property.  What could 
be more unphilosophical in a progressive philosopher? 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, M. Troplong has thought about these things.  
&ldquo;There are,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;many weak points and 
antiquated ideas in the doctrines of modern authors concerning property: 
witness the works of MM. Toullier and Duranton.&rdquo;  The doctrine 
of M. Troplong promises, then, strong points, advanced and progressive 
ideas.  Let us see; let us examine: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Man, placed in the presence of matter, is conscious of a 
power over it, which has been given to him to satisfy the needs of his 
being.  King of inanimate or unintelligent nature, he feels that he has a 
right to modify it, govern it, and fit it for his use.  There it is, the 
subject of property, which is legitimate only when exercised over things, 
never when over persons.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong is so little of a philosopher, that he does not even 
know the import of the philosophical terms which he makes a show of 
using.  He says of matter that it is the <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> of property; 
he should have said the <hi rend="italic">object</hi>.  M. Troplong uses the 
language of the anatomists, who apply the term <hi rend="italic">subject</hi> to 
the human matter used in their experiments. 
</p> 
<p>This error of our author is repeated farther on:  &ldquo;Liberty, 
which overcomes matter, the subject of property, &amp;c.&rdquo;  The 
<hi rend="italic">subject</hi> of property is man; its <hi rend="italic">object</hi> is 
matter.  But even this is but a slight mortification; directly we shall have 
some crucifixions. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, according to the passage just quoted, it is in the conscience 
and personality of man that the principle of property must be sought.  Is 
there any thing new in this doctrine?  Apparently it never has occurred 
to those who, since the days of Cicero and Aristotle, and earlier, have 
maintained that <hi rend="italic">things belong to the first occupant</hi>, that 
occupation may be  
<pb n="371"/>  
exercised by beings devoid of conscience and personality.  The human 
personality, though it may be the principle or the subject of property, as 
matter is the object, is not the <hi rend="italic">condition</hi>.  Now, it is this 
condition which we most need to know.  So far, M. Troplong tells us no 
more than his masters, and the figures with which he adorns his style 
add nothing to the old idea. 
</p> 
<p>Property, then, implies three terms:  The subject, the object, and 
the condition.  There is no difficulty in regard to the first two terms.  As 
to the third, the condition of property down to this day, for the Greek as 
for the Barbarian, has been that of first occupancy.  What now would 
you have it, progressive doctor? 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;When man lays hands for the first time upon an object 
without a master, he performs an act which, among individuals, is of the 
greatest importance.  The thing thus seized and occupied participates, so 
to speak, in the personality of him who holds it.  It becomes sacred, like 
himself.  It is impossible to take it without doing violence to his liberty, 
or to remove it without rashly invading his person.  Diogenes did but 
express this truth of intuition, when he said:  `Stand out of my light!' 
&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Very good! but would the prince of cynics, the very personal and 
very haughty Diogenes, have had the right to charge another cynic, as 
rent for this same place in the sunshine, a bone for twenty-four hours of 
possession?  It is that which constitutes the proprietor; it is that which 
you fail to justify.  In reasoning from the human personality and 
individuality to the right of property, you unconsciously construct a 
syllogism in which the conclusion includes more than the premises, 
contrary to the rules laid down by Aristotle.  The individuality of the 
human person proves <hi rend="italic">individual possession</hi>, originally 
called <hi rend="italic">proprietas</hi>, in opposition to collective possession, 
<hi rend="italic">communio</hi>.  It gives birth to the distinction  
<pb n="372"/>  
between <hi rend="italic">thine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>, true signs of 
equality, not, by any means, of subordination.  &ldquo;From 
equivocation to equivocation,&rdquo; says M. Michelet,[1] 
&ldquo;property would crawl to the end of the world; man could not 
limit it, were not he himself its limit.  Where they clash, there will be its 
frontier.&rdquo;  In short, individuality of being destroys the hypothesis 
of communism, but it does not for that reason give birth to domain, &mdash; 
that domain by virtue of which the holder of a thing exercises over the 
person who takes his place a right of prestation and suzerainty, that has 
always been identified with property itself. 
</p> 
<p>Further, that he whose legitimately acquired possession injures 
nobody cannot be nonsuited without flagrant injustice, is a truth, not of 
<hi rend="italic">intuition</hi>, as M. Troplong says, but of <hi rend="italic">inward 
sensation</hi>,[2] which has nothing to do with property. 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong admits, then, occupancy as a condition of property.  
In that, he is in accord with the Roman law, in accord with MM. 
Toullier and Duranton; but in his opinion this condition is not the only 
one, and it is in this particular that his doctrine goes beyond theirs. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But, however exclusive the right arising from sole 
occupancy, does it not become still more so, when man has moulded 
matter by his labor; when he has deposited in it a portion of himself, re-creating it by his industry, and setting upon it the seal of his intelligence 
and activity?  Of all conquests, that is the most legitimate, for it is the 
price of labor. 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;Origin of French Law.&rdquo; 
 
[2]  To honor one's parents, to be grateful to one's benefactors, to 
neither kill nor steal, &mdash; truths of inward sensation.  To obey God rather 
than men, to render to each that which is his; the whole is greater than a 
part, a straight line is the shortest road from one point to another, &mdash; 
truths of intuition.  All are <hi rend="italic">&agrave; priori</hi> but the first are 
felt by the conscience, and imply only a simple act of the soul; the 
second are perceived by the reason, and imply comparison and relation.  
In short, the former are sentiments, the latter are ideas. 
 
 
 
<pb n="373"/>  
He who should deprive a man of the thing thus remodelled, thus 
humanized, would invade the man himself, and would inflict the deepest 
wounds upon his liberty.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>I pass over the very beautiful explanations in which M. Troplong, 
discussing labor and industry, displays the whole wealth of his 
eloquence.  M. Troplong is not only a philosopher, he is an orator, an 
artist.  <hi rend="italic">He abounds with appeals to the conscience and the 
passions</hi>.  I might make sad work of his rhetoric, should I 
undertake to dissect it; but I confine myself for the present to his 
philosophy. 
</p> 
<p>If M. Troplong had only known how to think and reflect, before 
abandoning the original fact of occupancy and plunging into the theory of 
labor, he would have asked himself:  &ldquo;What is it to 
occupy?&rdquo;  And he would have discovered that 
<hi rend="italic">occupancy</hi> is only a generic term by which all modes of 
possession are expressed, &mdash; seizure, station, immanence, habitation, 
cultivation, use, consumption, &amp;c.; that labor, consequently, is but one 
of a thousand forms of occupancy.  He would have understood, finally, 
that the right of possession which is born of labor is governed by the 
same general laws as that which results from the simple seizure of 
things.  What kind of a legist is he who declaims when he ought to 
reason, who continually mistakes his metaphors for legal axioms, and 
who does not so much as know how to obtain a universal by induction, 
and form a category? 
</p> 
<p>If labor is identical with occupancy, the only benefit which it 
secures to the laborer is the right of individual possession of the object 
of his labor; if it differs from occupancy, it gives birth to a right equal 
only to itself, &mdash; that is, a right which begins, continues, and ends, with 
the labor of the occupant.  It is for this reason, in the words of the law, 
that one cannot acquire a just title to a thing by labor alone.  He must 
also  
<pb n="374"/>  
hold it for a year and a day, in order to be regarded as its possessor; and 
possess it twenty or thirty years, in order to become its proprietor. 
</p> 
<p>These preliminaries established, M. Troplong's whole structure 
falls of its own weight, and the inferences, which he attempts to draw, 
vanish. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Property once acquired by occupation and labor, it 
naturally preserves itself, not only by the same means, but also by the 
refusal of the holder to abdicate; for from the very fact that it has risen 
to the height of a right, it is its nature to perpetuate itself and to last for 
an indefinite period. . . .  Rights, considered from an ideal point of 
view, are imperishable and eternal; and time, which affects only the 
contingent, can no more disturb them than it can injure God 
himself.&rdquo;  It is astonishing that our author, in speaking of the 
<hi rend="italic">ideal, time</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">eternity</hi>, did not work into 
his sentence the <hi rend="italic">divine wings</hi> of Plato, &mdash; so fashionable to-day in philosophical works. 
</p> 
<p>With the exception of falsehood, I hate nonsense more than any 
thing else in the world.  <hi rend="italic">Property once acquired</hi>!  Good, if 
it is acquired; but, as it is not acquired, it cannot be preserved.  
<hi rend="italic">Rights are eternal</hi>!  Yes, in the sight of God, like the 
archetypal ideas of the Platonists.  But, on the earth, rights exist only in 
the presence of a subject, an object, and a condition.  Take away one of 
these three things, and rights no longer exist.  Thus, individual 
possession ceases at the death of the subject, upon the destruction of the 
object, or in case of exchange or abandonment. 
</p> 
<p>Let us admit, however, with M. Troplong, that property is an 
absolute and eternal right, which cannot be destroyed save by the deed 
and at the will of the proprietor.  What are the consequences which 
immediately follow from this position? 
 
<pb n="375"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>To show the justice and utility of prescription, M. Troplong 
supposes the case of a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> possessor whom a 
proprietor, long since forgotten or even unknown, is attempting to eject 
from his possession.  &ldquo;At the start, the error of the possessor was 
excusable but not irreparable.  Pursuing its course and growing old by 
degrees, it has so completely clothed itself in the colors of truth, it has 
spoken so loudly the language of right, it has involved so many confiding 
interests, that it fairly may be asked whether it would not cause greater 
confusion to go back to the reality than to sanction the fictions which it 
(an error, without doubt) has sown on its way?  Well, yes; it must be 
confessed, without hesitation, that the remedy would prove worse than 
the disease, and that its application would lead to the most outrageous 
injustice.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>How long since utility became a principle of law?  When the 
Athenians, by the advice of Aristides, rejected a proposition eminently 
advantageous to their republic, but also utterly unjust, they showed finer 
moral perception and greater clearness of intellect than M. Troplong.  
Property is an eternal right, independent of time, indestructible except by 
the act and at the will of the proprietor; and here this right is taken from 
the proprietor, and on what ground?  Good God! on the ground of 
<hi rend="italic">absence</hi>!  Is it not true that legists are governed by caprice 
in giving and taking away rights?  When it pleases these gentlemen, 
idleness, unworthiness, or absence can invalidate a right which, under 
quite similar circumstances, labor, residence, and virtue are inadequate 
to obtain.  Do not be astonished that legists reject the absolute.  Their 
good pleasure is law, and their disordered imaginations are the real cause 
of the <hi rend="italic">evolutions</hi> in jurisprudence. 
 
<pb n="376"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If the nominal proprietor should plead ignorance, his 
claim would be none the more valid.  Indeed, his ignorance might arise 
from inexcusable carelessness, etc.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>What! in order to legitimate dispossession through prescription, 
you suppose faults in the proprietor!  You blame his absence, &mdash; which 
may have been involuntary; his neglect, &mdash; not knowing what caused it; 
his carelessness, &mdash; a gratuitous supposition of your own!  It is absurd.  
One very simple observation suffices to annihilate this theory.  Society, 
which, they tell us, makes an exception in the interest of order in favor 
of the possessor as against the old proprietor, owes the latter an 
indemnity; since the privilege of prescription is nothing but expropriation 
for the sake of public utility. 
</p> 
<p>But here is something stronger: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;In society a place cannot remain vacant with impunity.  A 
new man arises in place of the old one who disappears or goes away; he 
brings here his existence, becomes entirely absorbed, and devotes 
himself to this post which he finds abandoned.  Shall the deserter, then, 
dispute the honor of the victory with the soldier who fights with the 
sweat standing on his brow, and bears the burden of the day, in behalf of 
a cause which he deems just?&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>When the tongue of an advocate once gets in motion, who can tell 
where it will stop?  M. Troplong admits and justifies usurpation in case 
of the <hi rend="italic">absence</hi> of the proprietor, and on a mere 
presumption of his <hi rend="italic">carelessness</hi>.  But when the neglect is 
authenticated; when the abandonment is solemnly and voluntarily set 
forth in a contract in the presence of a magistrate; when the proprietor 
dares to say, &ldquo;I cease to labor, but I still claim a share of the 
product,&rdquo; &mdash; then the absentee's right of property is protected; the 
usurpation of the possessor would be criminal; farm-rent is the reward of 
idleness.   
<pb n="377"/>  
Where is, I do not say the consistency, but, the honesty of this law? 
</p> 
<p>Prescription is a result of the civil law, a creation of the legislator.  
Why has not the legislator fixed the conditions differently? &mdash; why, 
instead of twenty and thirty years, is not a single year sufficient to 
prescribe? &mdash; why are not voluntary absence and confessed idleness as 
good grounds for dispossession as involuntary absence, ignorance, or 
apathy? 
</p> 
<p>But in vain should we ask M. Troplong, the philosopher, to tell us 
the ground of prescription.  Concerning the code, M. Troplong does not 
reason.  &ldquo;The interpreter,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;must take 
things as they are, society as it exists, laws as they are made: that is the 
only sensible starting-point.&rdquo;  Well, then, write no more books; 
cease to reproach your predecessors &mdash; who, like you, have aimed only at 
interpretation of the law &mdash; for having remained in the rear; talk no more 
of philosophy and progress, for the lie sticks in your throat. 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong denies the reality of the right of possession; he denies 
that possession has ever existed as a principle of society; and he quotes 
M. de Savigny, who holds precisely the opposite position, and whom he 
is content to leave unanswered.  At one time, M. Troplong asserts that 
possession and property are <hi rend="italic">contemporaneous</hi>, and that 
they exist <hi rend="italic">at the same time</hi>, which implies that the 
<hi rend="italic">right</hi> of property is based on the <hi rend="italic">fact</hi> of 
possession, &mdash; a conclusion which is evidently absurd; at another, he 
denies that possession <hi rend="italic">had any historical existence prior to 
property</hi>, &mdash; an assertion which is contradicted by the customs of 
many nations which cultivate the land without appropriating it; by the 
Roman law, which distinguished so clearly between 
<hi rend="italic">possession</hi> and <hi rend="italic">property;</hi> and by our code 
itself, which makes possession for twenty or thirty years the condition of 
property.  Finally, M. Troplong  
<pb n="378"/>  
goes so far as to maintain that the Roman maxim, <hi rend="italic">Nihil comune 
habet proprietas cum possessione</hi> &mdash; which contains so striking an 
allusion to the possession of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi>, and which, 
sooner or later, will be again accepted without qualification &mdash; expresses 
in French law only a judicial axiom, a simple rule forbidding the union 
of an <hi rend="italic">action possessoire</hi> with an <hi rend="italic">action 
petitoire</hi>, &mdash; an opinion as retrogressive as it is unphilosophical. 
</p> 
<p>In treating of <hi rend="italic">actions possessoires</hi>, M. Troplong is so 
unfortunate or awkward that he mutilates economy through failure to 
grasp its meaning &ldquo;Just as property,&rdquo; he writes, 
&ldquo;gave rise to the action for revendication, so possession &mdash; the 
<hi rend="italic">jus possessionis</hi> &mdash; was the cause of possessory 
interdicts. . . .  There were two kinds of interdicts, &mdash; the interdict 
<hi rend="italic">recuperand&aelig; possessionis</hi>, and the interdict 
<hi rend="italic">retinend&aelig; possessionis</hi>, &mdash;  which correspond to our 
<hi rend="italic">complainte en cas de saisine et nouvelete</hi>.  There is also a 
third, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">adipiscend&aelig; possessionis</hi>, &mdash; of which the 
Roman law-books speak in connection with the two others.  But, in 
reality, this interdict is not possessory: for he who wishes to acquire 
possession by this means does not possess, and has not possessed; and 
yet acquired possession is the condition of possessory interdicts.&rdquo;  
Why is not an action to acquire possession equally conceivable with an 
action to be reinstated in possession?  When the Roman plebeians 
demanded a division of the conquered territory; when the proletaires of 
Lyons took for their motto, <hi rend="italic">Vivre en travaillant, ou mourir en 
combattant</hi> (to live working, or die fighting); when the most 
enlightened of the modern economists claim for every man the right to 
labor and to live, &mdash; they only propose this interdict, 
<hi rend="italic">adipiscend&aelig; possessionis</hi>, which embarrasses M. 
Troplong so seriously.  And what is my object in pleading against 
property, if not to obtain possession?   
<pb n="379"/>  
How is it that M. Troplong &mdash; the legist, the orator, the philosopher &mdash; 
does not see that logically this interdict must be admitted, since it is the 
necessary complement of the two others, and the three united form an 
indivisible trinity, &mdash; to <hi rend="italic">recover</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">maintain</hi>, 
to <hi rend="italic">acquire</hi>?  To break this series is to create a blank, 
destroy the natural synthesis of things, and follow the example of the 
geometrician who tried to conceive of a solid with only two dimensions.  
But it is not astonishing that M. Troplong rejects the third class of 
<hi rend="italic">actions possessoires</hi>, when we consider that he rejects 
possession itself.  He is so completely controlled by his prejudices in this 
respect, that he is unconsciously led, not to unite (that would be horrible 
in his eyes), but to identify the <hi rend="italic">action possessoire</hi> with the 
<hi rend="italic">action petitoire</hi>.  This could be easily proved, were it not 
too tedious to plunge into these metaphysical obscurities. 
</p> 
<p>As an interpreter of the law, M. Troplong is no more successful 
than as a philosopher.  One specimen of his skill in this direction, and I 
am done with him: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Code of Civil Procedure, Art</hi>. 23:  
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Actions possessoires</hi> are only when commenced 
within the year of trouble by those who have held possession for at least 
a year by an irrevocable title.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>M. Troplong's comments: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Ought we to maintain &mdash; as Duparc, Poullain, and 
Lanjuinais would have us &mdash; the rule <hi rend="italic">spoliatus ante omnia 
restituendus</hi>, when an individual, who is neither proprietor nor 
annual possessor, is expelled by a third party, who has no right to the 
estate?  I think not.  Art. 23 of the Code is general: it absolutely 
requires that the plaintiff in <hi rend="italic">actions possessoires</hi> shall have 
been in peaceable possession for a year at least.  That is the invariable 
principle: it can in no case be modified.  And why should it be set aside?  
The plaintiff had no seisin; he had no privileged possession; he had only 
a temporary occupancy, insufficient to warrant in his favor the 
presumption of property, which renders the annual possession so 
valuable.  Well! this <hi rend="italic">ae facto</hi> occupancy he has lost; 
another is in 
<pb n="380"/>  
vested with it: possession is in the hands of this new-comer.  Now, is 
not this a case for the application of the principle, <hi rend="italic">In</hi> 
<hi rend="italic">pari causa possesser potior habetur</hi>?  Should not the actual 
possessor be preferred to the evicted possessor?  Can he not meet the 
complaint of his adversary by saying to him:  `Prove that you were an 
annual possessor before me, for you are the plaintiff.  As far as I am 
concerned, it is not for me to tell you how I possess, nor how long I 
have possessed.  <hi rend="italic">Possideo quia possideo</hi>.  I have no other 
reply, no other defence.  When you have shown that your action is 
admissible, then we will see whether you are entitled to lift the veil 
which hides the origin of my possession.' &rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>And this is what is honored with the name of jurisprudence and 
philosophy, &mdash; the restoration of force.  What! when I have 
&ldquo;moulded matter by my labor&rdquo; [I quote M. Troplong]; 
when I have &ldquo;deposited in it a portion of myself&rdquo; [M. 
Troplong]; when I have &ldquo;re-created it by my industry, and set 
upon it the seal of my intelligence&rdquo; [M. Troplong], &mdash; on the 
ground that I have not possessed it for a year, a stranger may dispossess 
me, and the law offers me no protection!  And if M. Troplong is my 
judge, M. Troplong will condemn me!  And if I resist my adversary, &mdash; 
if, for this bit of mud which I may call <hi rend="italic">my field</hi>, and of 
which they wish to rob me, a war breaks out between the two 
competitors, &mdash; the legislator will gravely wait until the stronger, having 
killed the other, has had possession for a year!  No, no, Monsieur 
Troplong! you do not understand the words of the law; for I prefer to 
call in question your intelligence rather than the justice of the legislator.  
You are mistaken in your application of the principle, <hi rend="italic">In pari 
causa possessor potior habetur:</hi> the actuality of possession here 
refers to him who possessed at the time when the difficulty arose, not to 
him who possesses at the time of the complaint.  And when the code 
prohibits the reception of <hi rend="italic">actions possessoires</hi>, in cases 
where the possession is not of a year's duration, it simply means that if, 
before a year has  
<pb n="381"/>  
elapsed, the holder relinquishes possession, and ceases actually to occupy 
<hi rend="italic">in propria persona</hi>, he cannot avail himself of an 
<hi rend="italic">action possessoire</hi> against his successor.  In a word, the 
code treats possession of less than a year as it ought to treat all 
possession, however long it has existed, &mdash; that is, the condition of 
property ought to be, not merely seisin for a year, but perpetual seisin. 
</p> 
<p>I will not pursue this analysis farther.  When an author bases two 
volumes of quibbles on foundations so uncertain, it may be boldly 
declared that his work, whatever the amount of learning displayed in it, 
is a mess of nonsense unworthy a critic's attention. 
</p> 
<p>At this point, sir, I seem to hear you reproaching me for this 
conceited dogmatism, this lawless arrogance, which respects nothing, 
claims a monopoly of justice and good sense, and assumes to put in the 
pillory any one who dares to maintain an opinion contrary to its own.  
This fault, they tell me, more odious than any other in an author, was 
too prominent a characteristic of my First Memoir, and I should do well 
to correct it. 
</p> 
<p>It is important to the success of my defence, that I should vindicate 
myself from this reproach; and since, while perceiving in myself other 
faults of a different character, I still adhere in this particular to my 
disputatious style, it is right that I should give my reasons for my 
conduct.  I act, not from inclination, but from necessity. 
</p> 
<p>I say, then, that I treat my authors as I do for two reasons: a 
<hi rend="italic">reason of right</hi>, and a <hi rend="italic">reason of intention;</hi> 
both peremptory. 
</p> 
<p>1. Reason of right.  When I preach equality of fortunes, I do not 
advance an opinion more or less probable, a utopia more or less 
ingenious, an idea conceived within my brain by means of imagination 
only.  I lay down an absolute truth,  
<pb n="382"/>  
concerning which hesitation is impossible, modesty superfluous, and 
doubt ridiculous. 
</p> 
<p>But, do you ask, what assures me that that which I utter is true?  
What assures me, sir?  The logical and metaphysical processes which I 
use, the correctness of which I have demonstrated by <hi rend="italic">&agrave; 
priori</hi> reasoning; the fact that I possess an infallible method of 
investigation and verification with which my authors are unacquainted; 
and finally, the fact that for all matters relating to property and justice I 
have found a formula which explains all legislative variations, and 
furnishes a key for all problems.  Now, is there so much as a shadow of 
method in M. Toullier, M. Troplong, and this swarm of insipid 
commentators, almost as devoid of reason and moral sense as the code 
itself?  Do you give the name of method to an alphabetical, 
chronological, analogical, or merely nominal classification of subjects?  
Do you give the name of method to these lists of paragraphs gathered 
under an arbitrary head, these sophistical vagaries, this mass of 
contradictory quotations and opinions, this nauseous style, this spasmodic 
rhetoric, models of which are so common at the bar, though seldom 
found elsewhere?  Do you take for philosophy this twaddle, this 
intolerable pettifoggery adorned with a few scholastic trimmings?  No, 
no! a writer who respects himself, never will consent to enter the balance 
with these manipulators of law, misnamed <hi rend="italic">jurists</hi>; and for 
my part I object to a comparison. 
</p> 
<p>2. Reason of intention.  As far as I am permitted to divulge this 
secret, I am a conspirator in an immense revolution, terrible to 
charlatans and despots, to all exploiters of the poor and credulous, to all 
salaried idlers, dealers in political panaceas and parables, tyrants in a 
word of thought and of opinion.  I labor to stir up the reason of 
individuals to insurrection against the reason of authorities. 
 
<pb n="383"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>According to the laws of the society of which I am a member, all 
the evils which afflict humanity arise from faith in external teachings and 
submission to authority.  And not to go outside of our own century, is it 
not true, for instance, that France is plundered, scoffed at, and 
tyrannized over, because she speaks in masses, and not by heads?  The 
French people are penned up in three or four flocks, receiving their 
signal from a chief, responding to the voice of a leader, and thinking just 
as he says.  A certain journal, it is said, has fifty thousand subscribers; 
assuming six readers to every subscriber, we have three hundred 
thousand sheep browsing and bleating at the same cratch.  Apply this 
calculation to the whole periodical press, and you find that, in our free 
and intelligent France, there are two millions of creatures receiving 
every morning from the journals spiritual pasturage.  Two millions!  In 
other words, the entire nation allows a score of little fellows to lead it by 
the nose. 
</p> 
<p>By no means, sir, do I deny to journalists talent, science, love of 
truth, patriotism, and what you please.  They are very worthy and 
intelligent people, whom I undoubtedly should wish to resemble, had I 
the honor to know them.  That of which I complain, and that which has 
made me a conspirator, is that, instead of enlightening us, these 
gentlemen command us, impose upon us articles of faith, and that 
without demonstration or verification.  When, for example, I ask why 
these fortifications of Paris, which, in former times, under the influence 
of certain prejudices, and by means of a concurrence of extraordinary 
circumstances supposed for the sake of the argument to have existed, 
may perhaps have served to protect us, but which it is doubtful whether 
our descendants will ever use, &mdash; when I ask, I say, on what grounds 
they assimilate the future to a hypothetical past, they reply that M. 
Thiers, who  
<pb n="384"/>  
has a great mind, has written upon this subject a report of admirable 
elegance and marvellous clearness.  At this I become angry, and reply 
that M. Thiers does not know what he is talking about.  Why, having 
wanted no detached forts seven years ago, do we want them to-day? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Oh! damn it,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;the difference is 
great; the first forts were too near to us; with these we cannot be bom-barded.&rdquo;  You cannot be bombarded; but you can be blockaded, 
and will be, if you stir.  What! to obtain blockade forts from the 
Parisians, it has sufficed to prejudice them against bombardment forts!  
And they thought to outwit the government!  Oh, the sovereignty of the 
people! . . . 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Damn it! M. Thiers, who is wiser than you, says that it 
would be absurd to suppose a government making war upon citizens, and 
maintaining itself by force and in spite of the will of the people.  That 
would be absurd!&rdquo;  Perhaps so: such a thing has happened more 
than once, and may happen again.  Besides, when despotism is strong, it 
appears almost legitimate.  However that may be, they lied in 1833, and 
they lie again in 1841, &mdash; those who threaten us with the bomb-shell.  
And then, if M. Thiers is so well assured of the intentions of the 
government, why does he not wish the forts to be built before the circuit 
is extended?  Why this air of suspicion of the government, unless an 
intrigue has been planned between the government and M. Thiers? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Damn it! we do not wish to be again invaded.  If Paris 
had been fortified in 1815, Napoleon would not have been 
conquered!&rdquo;  But I tell you that Napoleon was not conquered, but 
sold; and that if, in 1815, Paris had had fortifications, it would have 
been with them as with the thirty thousand men of Grouchy, who were 
misled during the battle.  It is still easier to surrender forts than to lead 
soldiers.   
<pb n="385"/>  
Would the selfish and the cowardly ever lack reasons for yielding to the 
enemy? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But do you not see that the absolutist courts are provoked 
at our fortifications? &mdash; a proof that they do not think as you do.&rdquo;  
You believe that; and, for my part, I believe that in reality they are quite 
at ease about the matter; and, if they appear to tease our ministers, they 
do so only to give the latter an opportunity to decline.  The absolutist 
courts are always on better terms with our constitutional monarchy, than 
our monarchy with us.  Does not M. Guizot say that France needs to be 
defended within as well as without?  Within! against whom?  Against 
France.  O Parisians! it is but six months since you demanded war, and 
now you want only barricades.  Why should the allies fear your 
doctrines, when you cannot even control yourselves? . . .  How could 
you sustain a siege, when you weep over the absence of an actress? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;But, finally, do you not understand that, by the rules of 
modern warfare, the capital of a country is always the objective point of 
its assailants?  Suppose our army defeated on the Rhine, France invaded, 
and defenceless Paris falling into the hands of the enemy.  It would be 
the death of the administrative power; without a head it could not live.  
The capital taken, the nation must submit.  What do you say to 
that?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>The reply is very simple.  Why is society constituted in such a way 
that the destiny of the country depends upon the safety of the capital?  
Why, in case our territory be invaded and Paris besieged, cannot the 
legislative, executive, and military powers act outside of Paris?  Why 
this localization of all the vital forces of France? . . .  Do not cry out 
upon decentralization.  This hackneyed reproach would discredit only 
 
<pb n="386"/>  
your own intelligence and sincerity.  It is not a question of 
decentralization; it is your political fetichism which I attack.  Why 
should the national unity be attached to a certain place, to certain 
functionaries, to certain bayonets?  Why should the Place Maubert and 
the Palace of the Tuileries be the palladium of France? 
</p> 
<p>Now let me make an hypothesis. 
</p> 
<p>Suppose it were written in the charter, &ldquo;In case the country 
be again invaded, and Paris forced to surrender, the government being 
annihilated and the national assembly dissolved, the electoral colleges 
shall reassemble spontaneously and without other official notice, for the 
purpose of appointing new deputies, who shall organize a provisional 
government at Orleans.  If Orleans succumbs, the government shall 
reconstruct itself in the same way at Lyons; then at Bordeaux, then at 
Bayonne, until all France be captured or the enemy driven from the land.  
For the government may perish, but the nation never dies.  The king, the 
peers, and the deputies massacred, <hi rend="italic">Vive la 
France</hi>!&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Do you not think that such an addition to the charter would be a 
better safeguard for the liberty and integrity of the country than walls 
and bastions around Paris?  Well, then! do henceforth for administration, 
industry, science, literature, and art that which the charter ought to 
prescribe for the central government and common defence.  Instead of 
endeavoring to render Paris impregnable, try rather to render the loss of 
Paris an insignificant matter.  Instead of accumulating about one point 
academies, faculties, schools, and political, administrative, and judicial 
centres; instead of arresting intellectual development and weakening 
public spirit in the provinces by this fatal agglomeration, &mdash; can you not, 
without destroying unity, distribute social functions among  
<pb n="387"/>  
places as well as among persons?  Such a system &mdash; in allowing each 
province to participate in political power and action, and in balancing 
industry, intelligence, and strength in all parts of the country &mdash; would 
equally secure, against enemies at home and enemies abroad, the liberty 
of the people and the stability of the government. 
</p> 
<p>Discriminate, then, between the centralization of functions and the 
concentration of organs; between political unity and its material symbol. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Oh! that is plausible; but it is impossible!&rdquo; &mdash; 
which means that the city of Paris does not intend to surrender its 
privileges, and that there it is still a question of property. 
</p> 
<p>Idle talk!  The country, in a state of panic which has been cleverly 
worked upon, has asked for fortifications.  I dare to affirm that it has 
abdicated its sovereignty.  All parties are to blame for this suicide, &mdash; the 
conservatives, by their acquiescence in the plans of the government; the 
friends of the dynasty, because they wish no opposition to that which 
pleases them, and because a popular revolution would annihilate them; 
the democrats, because they hope to rule in their turn.[1]  That which all 
rejoice at having obtained is a means 
 
 
[1]  Armand Carrel would have favored the fortification of the capital.  
&ldquo;Le National&rdquo; has said, again and again, placing the name 
of its old editor by the side of the names of Napoleon and Vauban.  
What signifies this exhumation of an anti-popular politician?  It signifies 
that Armand Carrel wished to make government an individual and 
irremovable, but elective, property, and that he wished this property to 
be elected, not by the people, but by the army.  The political system of 
Carrel was simply a reorganization of the pretorian guards.  Carrel also 
hated the <hi rend="italic">p&eacute;quins</hi>.  That which he deplored in the 
revolution of July was not, they say, the insurrection of the people, but 
the victory of the people over the soldiers.  That is the reason why 
Carrel, after 1830, would never support the patriots.  &ldquo;Do you 
answer me with a few regiments?&rdquo; he asked.  Armand Carrel 
regarded the army &mdash; the military power &mdash; as the basis of law and 
government.  This man undoubtedly had a moral sense within him, 
 
 
 
<pb n="388"/>  
of future repression.  As for the defence of the country, they are not 
troubled about that.  The idea of tyranny dwells in the minds of all, and 
brings together into one conspiracy all forms of selfishness.  We wish 
the regeneration of society, but we subordinate this desire to our ideas 
and convenience.  That our approaching marriage may take place, that 
our business may succeed, that our opinions may triumph, we postpone 
reform.  Intolerance and selfishness lead us to put fetters upon liberty; 
and, because we cannot wish all that God wishes, we would, if it rested 
with us, stay the course of destiny rather than sacrifice our own interests 
and self-love.  Is not this an instance where the words of Solomon apply, 
&mdash; &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">L'iniquit&eacute; a menti &agrave; elle-m&ecirc;me</hi>&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>For this reason, sir, I have enlisted in a desperate war against 
every form of authority over the multitude.  Advance sentinel of the 
proletariat, I cross bayonets with the celebrities of the day, as well as 
with spies and charlatans.  Well, when I am fighting with an illustrious 
adversary, must I stop at the end of every phrase, like an orator in the 
tribune, to say &ldquo;the learned author,&rdquo; &ldquo;the eloquent 
writer,&rdquo; &ldquo;the profound publicist,&rdquo; and a hundred 
other platitudes with which it is fashionable to mock people?  These 
civilities seem to me no less insulting to the man attacked than 
dishonorable 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued] 
<lb/> 
but he surely had no sense of justice.  Were he still in this world, I 
declare it boldly, liberty would have no greater enemy than Carrel. 
</p> 
<p>It is said that on this question of the fortification of Paris the staff 
of &ldquo;Le National&rdquo; are not agreed.  This would prove, if 
proof were needed, that a journal may blunder and falsify, without 
entitling any one to accuse its editors.  A journal is a metaphysical 
being, for which no one is really responsible, and which owes its 
existence solely to mutual concessions.  This idea ought to frighten those 
worthy citizens who, because they borrow their opinions from a journal, 
imagine that they belong to a political party, and who have not the 
faintest suspicion that they are really without a head.<lb/> 
[End of footnote] 
 
 
<pb n="389"/>  
to the aggressor.  But when, rebuking an author, I say to him, 
&ldquo;Citizen, your doctrine is absurd, and, if to prove my assertion is 
an offence against you, I am guilty of it,&rdquo; immediately the 
listener opens his ears; he is all attention; and, if I do not succeed in 
convincing him, at least I give his thought an impulse, and set him the 
wholesome example of doubt and free examination. 
</p> 
<p>Then do not think, sir, that, in tripping up the philosophy of your 
very learned and very estimable <hi rend="italic">confr&egrave;re</hi>, M. 
Troplong, I fail to appreciate his talent as a writer (in my opinion, he 
has too much for a jurist); nor his knowledge, though it is too closely 
confined to the letter of the law, and the reading of old books.  In these 
particulars, M. Troplong offends on the side of excess rather than 
deficiency.  Further, do not believe that I am actuated by any personal 
animosity towards him, or that I have the slightest desire to wound his 
self-love.  I know M. Troplong only by his &ldquo;Treatise on 
Prescription,&rdquo; which I wish he had not written; and as for my 
critics, neither M. Troplong, nor any of those whose opinion I value, 
will ever read me.  Once more, my only object is to prove, as far as I 
am able, to this unhappy French nation, that those who make the laws, 
as well as those who interpret them, are not infallible organs of general, 
impersonal, and absolute reason. 
</p> 
<p>I had resolved to submit to a systematic criticism the semi-official 
defence of the right of property recently put forth by M. Wolowski, your 
colleague at the Conservatory.  With this view, I had commenced to 
collect the documents necessary for each of his lectures, but, soon 
perceiving that the ideas of the professor were incoherent, that his 
arguments contradicted each other, that one affirmation was sure to be 
overthrown by another, and that in M. Wolowski's lucubrations 
 
<pb n="390"/>  
the good was always mingled with the bad, and being by nature a little 
suspicious, it suddenly occurred to me that M. Wolowski was an 
advocate of equality in disguise, thrown in spite of himself into the 
position in which the patriarch Jacob pictures one of his sons, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">inter duas clitellas</hi>, between two stools, as the proverb 
says.  In more parliamentary language, I saw clearly that M. Wolowski 
was placed between his profound convictions on the one hand and his 
official duties on the other, and that, in order to maintain his position, he 
had to assume a certain slant.  Then I experienced great pain at seeing 
the reserve, the circumlocution, the figures, and the irony to which a 
professor of legislation, whose duty it is to teach dogmas with clearness 
and precision, was forced to resort; and I fell to cursing the society in 
which an honest man is not allowed to say frankly what he thinks.  
Never, sir, have you conceived of such torture: I seemed to be 
witnessing the martyrdom of a mind.  I am going to give you an idea of 
these astonishing meetings, or rather of these scenes of sorrow. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Monday, Nov</hi>.  20, 1840. &mdash; The professor declares, 
in brief, &mdash; 1. That the right of property is not founded upon occupation, 
but upon the impress of man; 2. That every man has a natural and 
inalienable right to the use of matter. 
</p> 
<p>Now, if matter can be appropriated, and if, notwithstanding, all 
men retain an inalienable right to the use of this matter, what is 
property? &mdash; and if matter can be appropriated only by labor, how long is 
this appropriation to continue? &mdash; questions that will confuse and 
confound all jurists whatsoever. 
</p> 
<p>Then M. Wolowski cites his authorities.  Great God! what 
witnesses he brings forward!  First, M. Troplong, the great 
metaphysician, whom we have discussed; then, M. Louis Blanc, editor 
of the &ldquo;Revue du Progres,&rdquo; who came near  
<pb n="391"/>  
being tried by jury for publishing his &ldquo;Organization of 
Labor,&rdquo; and who escaped from the clutches of the public 
prosecutor only by a juggler's trick;[1] Corinne, &mdash; I mean Madame de 
Stael, &mdash; who, in an ode, making a poetical comparison of the land with 
the waves, of the furrow of a plough with the wake of a vessel, says 
&ldquo;that property exists only where man has left his trace,&rdquo; 
which makes property dependent upon the solidity of the elements; 
Rousseau, the apostle of liberty and equality, but who, according to M. 
Wolowski, attacked property only <hi rend="italic">as a joke</hi>, and in order 
to point a paradox; Robespierre, who prohibited a division of the land, 
because he regarded such a measure as a rejuvenescence of property, and 
who, while awaiting the definitive organization of the republic, placed all 
property in the care of the people, &mdash; that is, transferred the right of 
eminent domain from the individual to society; Babeuf, who wanted 
property for the nation, and communism for the citizens; M. Con-sid&eacute;rant, who favors a division of landed property into shares, &mdash; 
that is, who wishes to render property nominal and fictitious: the whole 
being intermingled with jokes and witticisms (intended undoubtedly to 
lead people away from the <hi rend="italic">hornets' nests</hi>) at the expense of 
the adversaries of the right of property! 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">November 26</hi>. &mdash; M. Wolowski supposes this 
objection: Land, like water, air, and light, is necessary to life, therefore 
it cannot be appropriated; and he replies: The impor- 
 
[1]  In a very short article, which was read by M. Wolowski, M. Louis 
Blanc declares, in substance, that he is not a communist (which I easily 
believe); that one must be a fool to attack property (but he does not say 
why); and that it is very necessary to guard against confounding property 
with its abuses.  When Voltaire overthrew Christianity, he repeatedly 
avowed that he had no spite against religion, but only against its abuses. 
 
 
 
<pb n="392"/>  
tance of landed property diminishes as the power of industry increases. 
</p> 
<p>Good! this importance <hi rend="italic">diminishes</hi>, but it does not 
<hi rend="italic">disappear</hi>; and this, of itself, shows landed property to be 
illegitimate.  Here M. Wolowski pretends to think that the opponents of 
property refer only to property in land, while they merely take it as a 
term of comparison; and, in showing with wonderful clearness the 
absurdity of the position in which he places them, he finds a way of 
drawing the attention of his hearers to another subject without being false 
to the truth which it is his office to contradict. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Property,&rdquo; says M. Wolowski, &ldquo;is that 
which distinguishes man from the animals.&rdquo;  That may be; but 
are we to regard this as a compliment or a satire? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Mahomet,&rdquo; says M. Wolowski, &ldquo;decreed 
property.&rdquo;  And so did Genghis Khan, and Tamerlane, and all the 
ravagers of nations.  What sort of legislators were they? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Property has been in existence ever since the origin of the 
human race.&rdquo;  Yes, and so has slavery, and despotism also; and 
likewise polygamy and idolatry.  But what does this antiquity show? 
</p> 
<p>The members of the Council of the State &mdash; M. Portalis at their 
head &mdash; did not raise, in their discussion of the Code, the question of the 
legitimacy of property.  &ldquo;Their silence,&rdquo; says M. 
Wolowski, &ldquo;is a precedent in favor of this right.&rdquo;  I may 
regard this reply as personally addressed to me, since the observation 
belongs to me.  I reply, &ldquo;As long as an opinion is universally 
admitted, the universality of belief serves of itself as argument and 
proof.  When this same opinion is attacked, the former faith proves 
nothing; we must resort to reason.  Ignorance, however old and 
pardonable it may be, never outweighs reason.&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="393"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Property has its abuses, M. Wolowski confesses.  
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;these abuses gradually disappear.  
To-day their cause is known.  They all arise from a false theory of prop-erty.  In principle, property is inviolable, but it can and must be checked 
and disciplined.&rdquo;  Such are the conclusions of the professor. 
</p> 
<p>When one thus remains in the clouds, he need not fear to 
equivocate.  Nevertheless, I would like him to define these 
<hi rend="italic">abuses</hi> of property, to show their cause, to explain this 
true theory from which no abuse is to spring; in short, to tell me how, 
without destroying property, it can be governed for the greatest good of 
all.  &ldquo;Our civil code,&rdquo; says M. Wolowski, in speaking of 
this subject, &ldquo;leaves much to be desired.&rdquo;  I think it 
leaves every thing undone. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, M. Wolowski opposes, on the one hand, the concentration 
of capital, and the absorption which results therefrom; and, on the other, 
he objects to the extreme division of the land.  Now I think that I have 
demonstrated in my First Memoir, that large accumulation and minute 
division are the first two terms of an economical trinity, &mdash; a 
<hi rend="italic">thesis</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">antithesis</hi>.  But, while M. 
Wolowski says nothing of the third term, the <hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi>, 
and thus leaves the inference in suspense, I have shown that this third 
term is ASSOCIATION, which is the annihilation of property. 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">November</hi> 30. &mdash; LITERARY PROPERTY.  M. 
Wolowski grants that it is just to recognize the rights of talent (which is 
not in the least hostile to equality); but he seriously objects to perpetual 
and absolute property in the works of genius, to the profit of the authors' 
heirs.  His main argument is, that society has a right of collective 
production over every creation of the mind.  Now, it is precisely this 
principle of collective power that I developed in my &ldquo;Inquiries 
into Property  
<pb n="394"/>  
and Government,&rdquo; and on which I have established the complete 
edifice of a new social organization.  M. Wolowski is, as far as I know, 
the first jurist who has made a legislative application of this economical 
law.  Only, while I have extended the principle of collective power to 
every sort of product, M. Wolowski, more prudent than it is my nature 
to be, confines it to neutral ground.  So, that that which I am bold 
enough to say of the whole, he is contented to affirm of a part, leaving 
the intelligent hearer to fill up the void for himself.  However, his 
arguments are keen and close.  One feels that the professor, finding 
himself more at ease with one aspect of property, has given the rein to 
his intellect, and is rushing on towards liberty. 
</p> 
<p>1. Absolute literary property would hinder the activity of other 
men, and obstruct the development of humanity.  It would be the death 
of progress; it would be suicide.  What would have happened if the first 
inventions, &mdash; the plough, the level, the saw, &amp;c., &mdash; had been 
appropriated? 
</p> 
<p>Such is the first proposition of M. Wolowski. 
</p> 
<p>I reply:  Absolute property in land and tools hinders human 
activity, and obstructs progress and the free development of man.  What 
happened in Rome, and in all the ancient nations?  What occurred in the 
middle ages?  What do we see to-day in England, in consequence of 
absolute property in the sources of production?  The suicide of humanity. 
</p> 
<p>2. Real and personal property is in harmony with the social 
interest.  In consequence of literary property, social and individual 
interests are perpetually in conflict. 
</p> 
<p>The statement of this proposition contains a rhetorical figure, 
common with those who do not enjoy full and complete liberty of 
speech.  This figure is the <hi rend="italic">anti-phrasis</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">contre-v&eacute;rit&eacute;</hi>.  It consists, according to 
Dumarsais and the  
<pb n="395"/>  
best humanists, in saying one thing while meaning another.  M. 
Wolowski's proposition, naturally expressed, would read as follows:  
&ldquo;Just as real and personal property is essentially hostile to 
society, so, in consequence of literary property, social and individual 
interests are perpetually in conflict.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>3. M. de Montalembert, in the Chamber of Peers, vehemently 
protested against the assimilation of authors to inventors of machinery; 
an assimilation which he claimed to be injurious to the former.  M. 
Wolowski replies, that the rights of authors, without machinery, would 
be nil; that, without paper-mills, type foundries, and printing-offices, 
there could be no sale of verse and prose; that many a mechanical 
invention, &mdash; the compass, for instance, the telescope, or the steam-engine, &mdash; is quite as valuable as a book. 
</p> 
<p>Prior to M. Montalembert, M. Charles Comte had laughed at the 
inference in favor of mechanical inventions, which logical minds never 
fail to draw from the privileges granted to authors.  &ldquo;He,&rdquo; 
says M. Comte, &ldquo;who first conceived and executed the idea of 
transforming a piece of wood into a pair of <hi rend="italic">sabots</hi>, or an 
animal's hide into a pair of sandals, would thereby have acquired an 
exclusive right to make shoes for the human race!&rdquo;  Undoubtedly, 
under the system of property.  For, in fact, this pair of 
<hi rend="italic">sabots</hi>, over which you make so merry, is the creation of 
the shoemaker, the work of his genius, the expression of his thought; to 
him it is his poem, quite as much as &ldquo;Le Roi s'amuse,&rdquo; is 
M. Victor Hugo's drama.  Justice for all alike.  If you refuse a patent to 
a perfecter of boots, refuse also a privilege to a maker of rhymes. 
</p> 
<p>4. That which gives importance to a book is a fact external to the 
author and his work.  Without the intelligence of society, without its 
development, and a certain community of ideas, passions, and interests 
between it and the authors,  
<pb n="396"/>  
the works of the latter would be worth nothing.  The exchangeable value 
of a book is due even more to the <hi rend="italic">social condition</hi> than to 
the talent displayed in it. 
</p> 
<p>Indeed, it seems as if I were copying my own words.  This 
proposition of M. Wolowski contains a special expression of a general 
and absolute idea, one of the strongest and most conclusive against the 
right of property.  Why do artists, like mechanics, find the means to 
live?  Because society has made the fine arts, like the rudest industries, 
objects of consumption and exchange, governed consequently by all the 
laws of commerce and political economy.  Now, the first of these laws is 
the equipoise of functions; that is, the equality of associates. 
</p> 
<p>5. M. Wolowski indulges in sarcasm against the petitioners for 
literary property.  &ldquo;There are authors,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;who crave the privileges of authors, and who for that purpose 
point out the power of the melodrama.  They speak of the niece of 
Corneille, begging at the door of a theatre which the works of her uncle 
had enriched. . . .  To satisfy the avarice of literary people, it would be 
necessary to create literary majorats, and make a whole code of 
exceptions.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I like this virtuous irony.  But M. Wolowski has by no means 
exhausted the difficulties which the question involves.  And first, is it 
just that MM. Cousin, Guizot, Villemain, Damiron, and company, paid 
by the State for delivering lectures, should be paid a second time through 
the booksellers? &mdash; that I, who have the right to report their lectures, 
should not have the right to print them?  Is it just that MM. Noel and 
Chapsal, overseers of the University, should use their influence in selling 
their selections from literature to the youth whose studies they are 
instructed to superintend in consideration of a salary?  And, if that is not 
just, is it not  
<pb n="397"/>  
proper to refuse literary property to every author holding public offices, 
and receiving pensions or sinecures? 
</p> 
<p>Again, shall the privilege of the author extend to irreligious and 
immoral works, calculated only to corrupt the heart, and obscure the 
understanding?  To grant this privilege is to sanction immorality by law; 
to refuse it is to censure the author.  And since it is impossible, in the 
present imperfect state of society, to prevent all violations of the moral 
law, it will be necessary to open a license-office for books as well as 
morals.  But, then, three-fourths of our literary people will be obliged to 
register; and, recognized thenceforth on their own declaration as 
<hi rend="italic">prostitutes</hi>, they will necessarily belong to the public.  We 
pay toll to the prostitute; we do not endow her. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, shall plagiarism be classed with forgery?  If you reply 
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you appropriate in advance all the subjects of 
which books treat; if you say &ldquo;No,&rdquo; you leave the whole 
matter to the decision of the judge.  Except in the case of a clandestine 
reprint, how will he distinguish forgery from quotation, imitation, 
plagiarism, or even coincidence?  A <hi rend="italic">savant</hi> spends two 
years in calculating a table of logarithms to nine or ten decimals.  He 
prints it.  A fortnight after his book is selling at half-price; it is 
impossible to tell whether this result is due to forgery or competition.  
What shall the court do?  In case of doubt, shall it award the property to 
the first occupant?  As well decide the question by lot. 
</p> 
<p>These, however, are trifling considerations; but do we see that, in 
granting a perpetual privilege to authors and their heirs, we really strike 
a fatal blow at their interests?  We think to make booksellers dependent 
upon authors, &mdash; a delusion.  The booksellers will unite against works, 
and their proprietors.  Against works, by refusing to push their sale, by 
replacing them with poor imitations, by reproducing them  
<pb n="398"/>  
in a hundred indirect ways; and no one knows how far the science of 
plagiarism, and skilful imitation may be carried.  Against proprietors.  
Are we ignorant of the fact, that a demand for a dozen copies enables a 
bookseller to sell a thousand; that with an edition of five hundred he can 
supply a kingdom for thirty years?  What will the poor authors do in the 
presence of this omnipotent union of booksellers?  I will tell them what 
they will do.  They will enter the employ of those whom they now treat 
as pirates; and, to secure an advantage, they will become wage laborers.  
A fit reward for ignoble avarice, and insatiable pride.[1] 
 
 
[1]  The property fever is at its height among writers and artists, and it 
is curious to see the complacency with which our legislators and men of 
letters cherish this devouring passion.  An artist sells a picture, and then, 
the merchandise delivered, assumes to prevent the purchaser from selling 
engravings, under the pretext that he, the painter, in selling the original, 
has not sold his <hi rend="italic">design</hi>.  A dispute arises between the 
amateur and the artist in regard to both the fact and the law.  M. 
Villemain, the Minister of Public Instruction, being consulted as to this 
particular case, finds that the painter is right; only the property in the 
design should have been specially reserved in the contract: so that, in 
reality, M. Villemain recognizes in the artist a power to surrender his 
work and prevent its communication; thus contradicting the legal axiom, 
One <hi rend="italic">cannot give and keep at the same time</hi>.  A strange 
reasoner is M. Villemain!  An ambiguous principle leads to a false 
conclusion.  Instead of rejecting the principle, M. Villemain hastens to 
admit the conclusion.  With him the <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi> 
is a convincing argument.  Thus he is made official defender of literary 
property, sure of being understood and sustained by a set of loafers, the 
disgrace of literature and the plague of public morals.  Why, then, does 
M. Villemain feel so strong an interest in setting himself up as the chief 
of the literary classes, in playing for their benefit the 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Trissotin</hi> in the councils of the 
State, and in becoming the accomplice and associate of a band of profli-gates, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi> men of letters, &mdash; who for more than ten 
years have labored with such deplorable success to ruin public spirit, and 
corrupt the heart by warping the mind? 
</p> 
<p>Contradictions of contradictions!&rdquo;  Genius is the great 
leveller of the world,&rdquo; cries M. de Lamartine; &ldquo;then 
genius should be a proprietor.  Literary property is the fortune of 
democracy.&rdquo;  This unfortunate poet thinks himself profound when 
he is only puffed up.  His eloquence consists solely in 
 
 
 
<pb n="399"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>6. <hi rend="italic">Objection</hi>. &mdash; Property in occupied land passes to 
the heirs of the occupant.  &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; say the authors, 
&ldquo;should not the work of genius pass in like manner to the heirs of 
the man of genius?&rdquo;  M. Wolowski's reply:  &ldquo;Because the 
labor of the first occupant is continued by his heirs, while the heirs of an 
author neither change nor add to his works.  In landed property, the 
continuance of labor explains the continuance of the right.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Yes, when the labor is continued; but if the labor is not continued, 
the right ceases.  Thus is the right of possession, founded on personal 
labor, recognized by M. Wolowski. 
</p> 
<p>M. Wolowski decides in favor of granting to authors property in 
their works for a certain number of years, dating from the day of their 
first publication. 
</p> 
<p>The succeeding lectures on patents on inventions were no less 
instructive, although intermingled with shocking contradictions inserted 
with a view to make the useful truths more palatable.  The necessity for 
brevity compels me to terminate this examination here, not without 
regret. 
</p> 
<p>Thus, of two eclectic jurists, who attempt a defence of 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued] 
<lb/> 
coupling ideas which clash with each other: <hi rend="italic">round square, dark 
sun, fallen angel, priest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">love, thought</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">poetry, gunius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fortune, leveling</hi> and 
<hi rend="italic">property</hi>.  Let us tell him, in reply, that his mind is a dark 
luminary; that each of his discourses is a disordered harmony; and that 
all his successes, whether in verse or prose, are due to the use of the 
extraordinary in the treatment of the most ordinary subjects. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Le National,&rdquo; in reply to the report of M. 
Lamartine, endeavors to prove that literary property is of quite a 
different nature from landed property; as if the nature of the right of 
property depended on the object to which it is applied, and not on the 
mode of its exercise and the condition of its existence.  But the main 
object of &ldquo;Le National&rdquo; is to please a class of proprietors 
whom an extension of the right of property vexes: that is why 
&ldquo;Le National&rdquo; opposes literary property.  Will it tell us, 
once for all, whether it is for equality or against it? 
<lb/> 
[Enf of footnote] 
 
 
<pb n="400"/>  
property, one is entangled in a set of dogmas without principle or 
method, and is constantly talking nonsense; and the other designedly 
abandons the cause of property, in order to present under the same name 
the theory of individual possession.  Was I wrong in claiming that 
confusion reigned among legists, and ought I to be legally prosecuted for 
having said that their science henceforth stood convicted of falsehood, its 
glory eclipsed? 
</p> 
<p>The ordinary resources of the law no longer sufficing, philosophy, 
political economy, and the framers of systems have been consulted.  All 
the oracles appealed to have been discouraging. 
</p> 
<p>The philosophers are no clearer to-day than at the time of the 
eclectic efflorescence; nevertheless, through their mystical apothegms, 
we can distinguish the words <hi rend="italic">progress, unity, association, 
solidarity, fraternity</hi>, which are certainly not reassuring to 
proprietors.  One of these philosophers, M. Pierre Leroux, has written 
two large books, in which he claims to show by all religious, legislative, 
and philosophical systems that, since men are responsible to each other, 
equality of conditions is the final law of society.  It is true that this 
philosopher admits a kind of property; but as he leaves us to imagine 
what property would become in presence of equality, we may boldly 
class him with the opponents of the right of increase. 
</p> 
<p>I must here declare freely &mdash; in order that I may not be suspected 
of secret connivance, which is foreign to my nature &mdash; that M. Leroux 
has my full sympathy.  Not that I am a believer in his quasi-Pythagorean 
philosophy (upon this subject I should have more than one observation to 
submit to him, provided a veteran covered with stripes would not despise 
the remarks of a conscript); not that I feel bound to  
<pb n="401"/>  
this author by any special consideration for his opposition to property.  
In my opinion, M. Leroux could, and even ought to, state his position 
more explicitly and logically.  But I like, I admire, in M. Leroux, the 
antagonist of our philosophical demigods, the demolisher of usurped 
reputations, the pitiless critic of every thing that is respected because of 
its antiquity.  Such is the reason for my high esteem of M. Leroux; such 
would be the principle of the only literary association which, in this 
century of coteries, I should care to form.  We need men who, like M. 
Leroux, call in question social principles, &mdash; not to diffuse doubt 
concerning them, but to make them doubly sure; men who excite the 
mind by bold negations, and make the conscience tremble by doctrines of 
annihilation.  Where is the man who does not shudder on hearing M. 
Leroux exclaim, &ldquo;There is neither a paradise nor a hell; the 
wicked will not be punished, nor the good rewarded.  Mortals! cease to 
hope and fear; you revolve in a circle of appearances; humanity is an 
immortal tree, whose branches, withering one after another, feed with 
their <hi rend="italic">d&eacute;bris</hi> the root which is always 
young!&rdquo;  Where is the man who, on hearing this desolate 
confession of faith, does not demand with terror, &ldquo;Is it then true 
that I am only an aggregate of elements organized by an unknown force, 
an idea realized for a few moments, a form which passes and disappears?  
Is it true that my mind is only a harmony, and my soul a vortex?  What 
is the <hi rend="italic">ego</hi>? what is God?  what is the sanction of 
society?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In former times, M. Leroux would have been regarded as a great 
culprit, worthy only (like Vanini) of death and universal execration.  To-day, M. Leroux is fulfilling a mission of salvation, for which, whatever 
he may say, he will be rewarded.  Like those gloomy invalids who are 
always talking of their  
<pb n="402"/>  
approaching death, and who faint when the doctor's opinion confirms 
their pretence, our materialistic society is agitated and loses countenance 
while listening to this startling decree of the philosopher, &ldquo;Thou 
shalt die!&rdquo;  Honor then to M. Leroux, who has revealed to us the 
cowardice of the Epicureans; to M. Leroux, who renders new 
philosophical solutions necessary!  Honor to the anti-eclectic, to the 
apostle of equality! 
</p> 
<p>In his work on &ldquo;Humanity,&rdquo; M. Leroux commences 
by positing the necessity of property:  &ldquo;You wish to abolish 
property; but do you not see that thereby you would annihilate man and 
even the name of man? . . .  You wish to abolish property; but could 
you live without a body?  I will not tell you that it is necessary to 
support this body; . . . I will tell you that this body is itself a species of 
property.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In order clearly to understand the doctrine of M. Leroux, it must 
be borne in mind that there are three necessary and primitive forms of 
society, &mdash; communism, property, and that which to-day we properly call 
association.  M. Leroux rejects in the first place communism, and 
combats it with all his might.  Man is a personal and free being, and 
therefore needs a sphere of independence and individual activity.  M. 
Leroux emphasizes this in adding:  &ldquo;You wish neither family, nor 
country, nor property; therefore no more fathers, no more sons, no more 
brothers.  Here you are, related to no being in time, and therefore 
without a name; here you are, alone in the midst of a billion of men who 
to-day inhabit the earth.  How do you expect me to distinguish you in 
space in the midst of this multitude?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>If man is indistinguishable, he is nothing.  Now, he can be 
distinguished, individualized, only through a devotion of certain things to 
his use, &mdash; such as his body, his faculties, and  
<pb n="403"/>  
the tools which he uses.  &ldquo;Hence,&rdquo; says M. Leroux, 
&ldquo;the necessity of appropriation;&rdquo; in short, property. 
</p> 
<p>But property on what condition?  Here M. Leroux, after having 
condemned communism, denounces in its turn the right of domain.  His 
whole doctrine can be summed up in this single proposition, &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Man may be made by property a slave or a despot by 
turns</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>That posited, if we ask M. Leroux to tell us under what system of 
property man will be neither a slave nor a despot, but free, just, and a 
citizen, M. Leroux replies in the third volume of his work on 
&ldquo;Humanity:&rdquo; &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;There are three ways of destroying man's communion 
with his fellows and with the universe: . . .  1. By separating man in 
time; 2. by separating him in space; 3. by dividing the land, or, in 
general terms, the instruments of production; by attaching men to things, 
by subordinating man to property, by making man a proprietor.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>This language, it must be confessed, savors a little too strongly of 
the metaphysical heights which the author frequents, and of the school of 
M. Cousin.  Nevertheless, it can be seen, clearly enough it seems to me, 
that M. Leroux opposes the exclusive appropriation of the instruments of 
production; only he calls this non-appropriation of the instruments of 
production a <hi rend="italic">new method</hi> of establishing property, while I, 
in accordance with all precedent, call it a destruction of property.  In 
fact, without the appropriation of instruments, property is nothing. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Hitherto.  we have confined ourselves to pointing out and 
combating the despotic features of property, by considering property 
alone.  We have failed to see that the despotism of property is a 
correlative of the division of the human race; . . . that property, instead 
of being organized in such a way as to facilitate the unlimited 
communion of man with his fellows and with the universe, has been, on 
the contrary, turned against this communion.&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="404"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Let us translate this into commercial phraseology.  In order to 
destroy despotism and the inequality of conditions, men must cease from 
competition and must associate their interests.  Let employer and 
employed (now enemies and rivals) become associates. 
</p> 
<p>Now, ask any manufacturer, merchant, or capitalist, whether he 
would consider himself a proprietor if he were to share his revenue and 
profits with this mass of wage-laborers whom it is proposed to make his 
associates. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Family, property, and country are finite things, which 
ought to be organized with a view to the infinite.  For man is a finite 
being, who aspires to the infinite.  To him, absolute finiteness is evil.  
The infinite is his aim, the indefinite his right.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Few of my readers would understand these hierophantic words, 
were I to leave them unexplained.  M. Leroux means, by this 
magnificent formula, that humanity is a single immense society, which, 
in its collective unity, represents the infinite; that every nation, every 
tribe, every commune, and every citizen are, in different degrees, 
fragments or finite members of the infinite society, the evil in which 
results solely from individualism and privilege, &mdash; in other words, from 
the subordination of the infinite to the finite; finally, that, to attain 
humanity's end and aim, each part has a right to an indefinitely 
progressive development. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;All the evils which afflict the human race arise from 
caste.  The family is a blessing; the family caste (the nobility) is an evil.  
Country is a blessing; the country caste (supreme, domineering, 
conquering) is an evil; property (individual possession) is a blessing; the 
property caste (the domain of property of Pothier, Toullier, Troplong, 
&amp;c.) is an evil.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Thus, according to M. Leroux, there is property and property, &mdash; 
the one good, the other bad.  Now, as it is proper to  
<pb n="405"/>  
call different things by different names, if we keep the name 
&ldquo;property&rdquo; for the former, we must call the latter 
robbery, rapine, brigandage.  If, on the contrary, we reserve the name 
&ldquo;property&rdquo; for the latter, we must designate the former by 
the term <hi rend="italic">possession</hi>, or some other equivalent; otherwise 
we should be troubled with an unpleasant synonymy. 
</p> 
<p>What a blessing it would be if philosophers, daring for once to say 
all that they think, would speak the language of ordinary mortals!  
Nations and rulers would derive much greater profit from their lectures, 
and, applying the same names to the same ideas, would come, perhaps, 
to understand each other.  I boldly declare that, in regard to property, I 
hold no other opinion than that of M. Leroux; but, if I should adopt the 
style of the philosopher, and repeat after him, &ldquo;Property is a 
blessing, but the property caste &mdash; the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> of property 
&mdash; is an evil,&rdquo; I should be extolled as a genius by all the bachelors 
who write for the reviews.[1]  If, on the contrary, I prefer the classic 
language of Rome and the civil code, and say accordingly, 
&ldquo;Possession is a blessing, but 
 
 
[1]  M. Leroux has been highly praised in a review for having defended 
property.  I do not know whether the industrious encyclopedist is pleased 
with the praise, but I know very well that in his place I should mourn for 
reason and for truth. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Le National,&rdquo; on the other hand, has laughed at 
M. Leroux and his ideas on property, charging him with 
<hi rend="italic">tautology</hi> and <hi rend="italic">childishness</hi>.  &ldquo;Le 
National&rdquo; does not wish to understand.  Is it necessary to remind 
this journal that it has no right to deride a dogmatic philosopher, because 
it is without a doctrine itself?  From its foundation, &ldquo;Le 
National&rdquo; has been a nursery of intriguers and renegades.  From 
time to time it takes care to warn its readers.  Instead of lamenting over 
all its defections, the democratic sheet would do better to lay the blame 
on itself, and confess the shallowness of its theories.  When will this 
organ of popular interests and the electoral reform cease to hire sceptics 
and spread doubt?  I will wager, without going further, that M. Leon 
Durocher, the critic of M. Leroux, is an anonymous or pseudonymous 
editor of some <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi>, or even aristocratic, journal. 
 
 
 
<pb n="406"/>  
property is robbery,&rdquo; immediately the aforesaid bachelors raise a 
hue and cry against the monster, and the judge threatens me.  Oh, the 
power of language! 
</p> 
<p>The economists, questioned in their turn, propose to associate 
capital and labor.  You know, sir, what that means.  If we follow out the 
doctrine, we soon find that it ends in an absorption of property, not by 
the community, but by a general and indissoluble <hi rend="italic">commandite 
[sic] </hi>, so that the condition of the proprietor would differ from 
that of the workingman only in receiving larger wages.  This system, 
with some peculiar additions and embellishments, is the idea of the 
phalanstery.  But it is clear that, if inequality of conditions is one of the 
attributes of property, it is not the whole of property.  That which makes 
property a <hi rend="italic">delightful thing</hi>, as some philosopher (I know 
not who) has said, is the power to dispose at will, not only of one's own 
goods, but of their specific nature; to use them at pleasure; to confine 
and enclose them; to excommunicate mankind, as M. Pierre Leroux 
says; in short, to make such use of them as passion, interest, or even 
caprice, may suggest.  What is the possession of money, a share in an 
agricultural or industrial enterprise, or a government-bond coupon, in 
comparison with the infinite charm of being master of one's house and 
grounds, under one's vine and fig-tree?  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Beati 
possidentes</hi>!&rdquo; says an author quoted by M. Troplong.  
Seriously, can that be applied to a man of income, who has no other 
possession under the sun than the market, and in his pocket his money?  
As well maintain that a trough is a coward.  A nice method of reform!  
They never cease to condemn the thirst for gold, and the growing 
individualism of the century; and yet, most inconceivable of 
contradictions, they prepare to turn all kinds of property into one, &mdash; 
property in coin. 
 
<pb n="407"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>I must say something further of a theory of property lately put 
forth with some ado: I mean the theory of M. Consid&eacute;rant. 
</p> 
<p>The Fourierists are not men who examine a doctrine in order to 
ascertain whether it conflicts with their system.  On the contrary, it is 
their custom to exult and sing songs of triumph whenever an adversary 
passes without perceiving or noticing them.  These gentlemen want direct 
refutations, in order that, if they are beaten, they may have, at least, the 
selfish consolation of having been spoken of.  Well, let their wish be 
gratified. 
</p> 
<p>M. Consid&eacute;rant makes the most lofty pretensions to logic.  
His method of procedure is always that of <hi rend="italic">major, minor</hi>, 
and <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi>.  He would willingly write upon his hat, 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Argumentator in barbara</hi>.&rdquo;  But M. 
Consid&eacute;rant is too intelligent and quick-witted to be a good 
logician, as is proved by the fact that he appears to have taken the 
syllogism for logic. 
</p> 
<p>The syllogism, as everybody knows who is interested in 
philosophical curiosities, is the first and perpetual sophism of the human 
mind, &mdash; the favorite tool of falsehood, the stumbling-block of science, 
the advocate of crime.  The syllogism has produced all the evils which 
the fabulist so eloquently condemned, and has done nothing good or 
useful: it is as devoid of truth as of justice.  We might apply to it these 
words of Scripture:  &ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Celui qui met en lui sa confiance, 
p&eacute;rira</hi>.&rdquo;  Consequently, the best philosophers long 
since condemned it; so that now none but the enemies of reason wish to 
make the syllogism its weapon. 
</p> 
<p>M. Consid&eacute;rant, then, has built his theory of property upon 
a syllogism.  Would he be disposed to stake the system of Fourier upon 
his arguments, as I am ready to risk the whole doctrine of equality upon 
my refutation of that system?   
<pb n="408"/>  
Such a duel would be quite in keeping with the warlike and chivalric 
tastes of M. Consid&eacute;rant, and the public would profit by it; for, 
one of the two adversaries falling, no more would be said about him, 
and there would be one grumbler less in the world. 
</p> 
<p>The theory of M. Consid&eacute;rant has this remarkable feature, 
that, in attempting to satisfy at the same time the claims of both laborers 
and proprietors, it infringes alike upon the rights of the former and the 
privileges of the latter.  In the first place, the author lays it down as a 
principle:  &ldquo;1. That the use of the land belongs to each member 
of the race; that it is a natural and imprescriptible right, similar in all 
respects to the right to the air and the sunshine.  2. That the right to 
labor is equally fundamental, natural, and imprescriptible.&rdquo;  I 
have shown that the recognition of this double right would be the death 
of property.  I denounce M. Consid&eacute;rant to the proprietors! 
</p> 
<p>But M. Consid&eacute;rant maintains that the right to labor creates 
the right of property, and this is the way he reasons: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Major Premise</hi>. &mdash; &ldquo;Every man legitimately 
possesses the thing which his labor, his skill, &mdash; or, in more general 
terms, his action, &mdash; has created.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>To which M. Consid&eacute;rant adds, by way of comment:  
&ldquo;Indeed, the land not having been created by man, it follows 
from the fundamental principle of property, that the land, being given to 
the race in common, can in no wise be the exclusive and legitimate 
property of such and such individuals, who were not the creators of this 
value.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>If I am not mistaken, there is no one to whom this proposition, at 
first sight and in its entirety, does not seem utterly irrefutable.  Reader, 
distrust the syllogism. 
</p> 
<p>First, I observe that the words <hi rend="italic">legitimately possesses</hi> 
signify  
<pb n="409"/>  
to the author's mind is <hi rend="italic">legitimate proprietor;</hi> otherwise the 
argument, being intended to prove the legitimacy of property, would 
have no meaning.  I might here raise the question of the difference 
between property and possession, and call upon M. Consid&eacute;rant, 
before going further, to define the one and the other; but I pass on. 
</p> 
<p>This first proposition is doubly false.  1. In that it asserts the act of 
<hi rend="italic">creation</hi> to be the only basis of property.  2. In that it 
regards this act as sufficient in all cases to authorize the right of 
property. 
</p> 
<p>And, in the first place, if man may be proprietor of the game 
which he does not create, but which he <hi rend="italic">kills;</hi> of the fruits 
which he does not create, but which he <hi rend="italic">gathers;</hi> of the 
vegetables which he does not create, but which he <hi rend="italic">plants;</hi> 
of the animals which he does not create, but which he 
<hi rend="italic">rears</hi>, &mdash; it is conceivable that men may in like manner 
become proprietors of the land which they do not create, but which they 
clear and fertilize.  The act of creation, then, is not 
<hi rend="italic">necessary</hi> to the acquisition of the right of property.  I say 
further, that this act alone is not always sufficient, and I prove it by the 
second premise of M. Consid&eacute;rant: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Minor Premise</hi>. &mdash; &ldquo;Suppose that on an 
isolated island, on the soil of a nation, or over the whole face of the 
earth (the extent of the scene of action does not affect our judgment of 
the facts), a generation of human beings devotes itself for the first time 
to industry, agriculture, manufactures, &amp;c.  This generation, by its 
labor, intelligence, and activity, creates products, develops values which 
did not exist on the uncultivated land.  Is it not perfectly clear that the 
property of this industrious generation will stand on a basis of right, if 
the value or wealth produced by the activity of all be distributed among 
the producers, according to each one's assistance in the creation of the 
general wealth?  That is unquestionable.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>That is quite questionable.  For this value or wealth, 
<hi rend="italic">pro 
<pb n="410"/>  
duced by the activity of all</hi>, is by the very fact of its creation 
<hi rend="italic">collective</hi> wealth, the use of which, like that of the land, 
may be divided, but which as property remains <hi rend="italic">undivided</hi>.  
And why this undivided ownership?  Because the society which creates is 
itself indivisible, &mdash; a permanent unit, incapable of reduction to fractions.  
And it is this unity of society which makes the land common property, 
and which, as M. Consid&eacute;rant says, renders its use 
imprescriptible in the case of every individual.  Suppose, indeed, that at 
a given time the soil should be equally divided; the very next moment 
this division, if it allowed the right of property, would become 
illegitimate.  Should there be the slightest irregularity in the method of 
transfer, men, members of society, imprescriptible possessors of the 
land, might be deprived at one blow of property, possession, and the 
means of production.  In short, property in capital is indivisible, and 
consequently inalienable, not necessarily when the capital is 
<hi rend="italic">uncreated</hi>, but when it is <hi rend="italic">common</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">collective</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>I confirm this theory against M. Consid&eacute;rant, by the third 
term of his syllogism: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p><hi rend="italic">Conclusion</hi>. &mdash; &ldquo;The results of the labor 
performed by this generation are divisible into two classes, between 
which it is important clearly to distinguish.  The first class includes the 
products of the soil which belong to this first generation in its 
usufructuary capacity, augmented, improved and refined by its labor and 
industry.  These products consist either of objects of consumption or 
instruments of labor.  It is clear that these products are the legitimate 
property of those who have created them by their activity. . . .  Second 
class. &mdash; Not only has this generation created the products just mentioned 
(objects of consumption and instruments of labor), but it has also added 
to the original value of the soil by cultivation, by the erection of 
buildings, by all the labor producing permanent results, which it has 
performed.  This additional value evidently constitutes a product &mdash; a 
value created by the activity of the first generation; and if, <hi rend="italic">by any 
means whatever</hi>, the ownership of this value be  
<pb n="411"/>  
distributed among the members of society equitably, &mdash; that is, in pro-portion to the labor which each has performed, &mdash; each will legitimately 
possess the portion which he receives.  He may then dispose of this 
legitimate and private property as he sees fit, &mdash; exchange it, give it 
away, or transfer it; and no other individual, or collection of other 
individuals, &mdash; that is, society, &mdash; can lay any claim to these 
values.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>Thus, by the distribution of collective capital, to the use of which 
each associate, either in his own right or in right of his authors, has an 
imprescriptible and undivided title, there will be in the phalanstery, as in 
the France of 1841, the poor and the rich; some men who, to live in 
luxury, have only, as Figaro says, to take the trouble to be born, and 
others for whom the fortune of life is but an opportunity for long-con-tinued poverty; idlers with large incomes, and workers whose fortune is 
always in the future; some privileged by birth and caste, and others 
pariahs whose sole civil and political rights are <hi rend="italic">the right to labor, 
and the right to land</hi>.  For we must not be deceived; in the 
phalanstery every thing will be as it is to-day, an object of property, &mdash; 
machines, inventions, thought, books, the products of art, of agriculture, 
and of industry; animals, houses, fences, vineyards, pastures, forests, 
fields, &mdash; every thing, in short, except the <hi rend="italic">uncultivated 
land</hi>.  Now, would you like to know what uncultivated land is 
worth, according to the advocates of property?  &ldquo;A square league 
hardly suffices for the support of a savage,&rdquo; says M. Charles 
Comte.  Estimating the wretched subsistence of this savage at three 
hundred francs per year, we find that the square league necessary to his 
life is, relatively to him, faithfully represented by a rent of fifteen 
francs.  In France there are twenty-eight thousand square leagues, the 
total rent of which, by this estimate, would be four hundred and twenty 
thousand francs, which, when divided among nearly thirty-four millions 
of people, would give each an <hi rend="italic">income of a centime and a 
quarter</hi>.   
<pb n="412"/>  
That is the new right which the great genius of Fourier has invented 
<hi rend="italic">in behalf of the French people</hi>, and with which his first 
disciple hopes to reform the world.  I denounce M. Consid&eacute;rant 
to the proletariat! 
</p> 
<p>If the theory of M. Consid&eacute;rant would at least really guar-antee this property which he cherishes so jealously, I might pardon him 
the flaws in his syllogism, certainly the best one he ever made in his life.  
But, no: that which M. Consid&eacute;rant takes for property is only a 
privilege of extra pay.  In Fourier's system, neither the created capital 
nor the increased value of the soil are divided and appropriated in any 
effective manner: the instruments of labor, whether created or not, 
remain in the hands of the phalanx; the pretended proprietor can touch 
only the income.  He is permitted neither to realize his share of the 
stock, nor to possess it exclusively, nor to administer it, whatever it be.  
The cashier throws him his dividend; and then, proprietor, eat the whole 
if you can! 
</p> 
<p>The system of Fourier would not suit the proprietors, since it takes 
away the most delightful feature of property, &mdash; the free disposition of 
one's goods.  It would please the communists no better, since it involves 
unequal conditions.  It is repugnant to the friends of free association and 
equality, in consequence of its tendency to wipe out human character and 
individuality by suppressing possession, family, and country, &mdash; the 
threefold expression of the human personality. 
</p> 
<p>Of all our active publicists, none seem to me more fertile in 
resources, richer in imagination, more luxuriant and varied in style, than 
M. Consid&eacute;rant.  Nevertheless, I doubt if he will undertake to 
reestablish his theory of property.  If he has this courage, this is what I 
would say to him:  &ldquo;Before writing your reply, consider well 
your plan of action; do not scour the country; have recourse to none of 
your ordinary  
<pb n="413"/>  
expedients; no complaints of civilization; no sarcasms upon equality; no 
glorification of the phalanstery.  Leave Fourier and the departed in 
peace, and endeavor only to re-adjust the pieces of your syllogism.  To 
this end, you ought, first, to analyze closely each proposition of your 
adversary; second, to show the error, either by a direct refutation, or by 
proving the converse; third, to oppose argument to argument, so that, 
objection and reply meeting face to face, the stronger may break down 
the weaker, and shiver it to atoms.  By that method only can you boast 
of having conquered, and compel me to regard you as an honest 
reasoner, and a good artillery-man.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>I should have no excuse for tarrying longer with these phal-ansterian crotchets, if the obligation which I have imposed upon myself 
of making a clean sweep, and the necessity of vindicating my dignity as 
a writer, did not prevent me from passing in silence the reproach uttered 
against me by a correspondent of &ldquo;La Phalange.&rdquo;  
&ldquo;We have seen but lately,&rdquo; says this journalist,[1] 
&ldquo;that M. Proudhon, enthusiast as he has been for the science 
created by Fourier, is, or will be, an enthusiast for any thing else 
whatsoever.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>If ever sectarians had the right to reproach another for changes in 
his beliefs, this right certainly does not belong to the disciples of 
Fourier, who are always so eager to administer the phalansterian baptism 
to the deserters of all parties.  But why regard it as a crime, if they are 
sincere?  Of what consequence is the constancy or inconstancy of an 
individual to the truth which is always the same?  It is better to enlighten 
men's minds than to teach them to be obstinate in their prejudices.  Do 
we not know that man is frail and 
 
 
[1]  &ldquo;Impartial,&rdquo; of Besan&ccedil;on. 
 
 
 
<pb n="414"/>  
fickle, that his heart is full of delusions, and that his lips are a distillery 
of falsehood?  <hi rend="italic">Omnis homo meudax</hi>.  Whether we will or 
no, we all serve for a time as instruments of this truth, whose kingdom 
comes every day.  God alone is immutable, because he is eternal. 
</p> 
<p>That is the reply which, as a general rule, an honest man is 
entitled always to make, and which I ought perhaps to be content to offer 
as an excuse; for I am no better than my fathers.  But, in a century of 
doubt and apostasy like ours, when it is of importance to set the small 
and the weak an example of strength and honesty of utterance, I must not 
suffer my character as a public assailant of property to be dishonored.  I 
must render an account of my old opinions. 
</p> 
<p>Examining myself, therefore, upon this charge of Fourierism, and 
endeavoring to refresh my memory, I find that, having been connected 
with the Fourierists in my studies and my friendships, it is possible that, 
without knowing it, I have been one of Fourier's partisans.  
J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Lalande placed Napoleon and Jesus Christ in his 
catalogue of atheists.  The Fourierists resemble this astronomer: if a man 
happens to find fault with the existing civilization, and to admit the truth 
of a few of their criticisms, they straightway enlist him, willy-nilly, in 
their school.  Nevertheless, I do not deny that I have been a Fourierist; 
for, since they say it, of course it may be so.  But, sir, that of which my 
ex-associates are ignorant, and which doubtless will astonish you, is that 
I have been many other things, &mdash; in religion, by turns a Protestant, a 
Papist, an Arian and Semi-Arian, a Manichean, a Gnostic, an Adamite 
even and a Pre-Adamite, a Sceptic, a Pelagian, a Socinian, an Anti-Trinitarian, and a Neo-Christian;[1] in phi- 
 
[1]  The Arians deny the divinity of Christ.  The Semi-Arians differ 
from the Arians only by a few subtle distinctions.  M. Pierre Leroux, 
who regards Jesus

losophy and politics, an Idealist, a Pantheist, a Platonist, a Cartesian, an 
Eclectic (that is, a sort of <hi rend="italic">juste-milieu</hi>), a Monarchist, an 
Aristocrat, a Constitutionalist, a follower of Babeuf, and a Communist.  
I have wandered through a whole encyclopaedia of systems.  Do you 
think it surprising, sir, that, among them all, I was for a short time a 
Fourierist? 
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued] 
<lb/> 
as a man, but claims that the Spirit of God was infused into him, is a 
true Semi-Arian. 
</p> 
<p>The Manicheans admit two co-existent and eternal principles, &mdash; 
God and matter, spirit and flesh, light and darkness, good and evil; but, 
unlike the Phalansterians, who pretend to reconcile the two, the 
Manicheans make war upon matter, and labor with all their might for the 
destruction of the flesh, by condemning marriage and forbidding 
reproduction, &mdash; which does not prevent them, however, from indulging 
in all the carnal pleasures which the intensest lust can conceive of.  In 
this last particular, the tendency of the Fourieristic morality is quite 
Manichean. 
</p> 
<p>The Gnostics do not differ from the early Christians.  As their 
name indicates, they regarded themselves as inspired.  Fourier, who held 
peculiar ideas concerning the visions of somnambulists, and who 
believed in the possibility of developing the magnetic power to such an 
extent as to enable us to commune with invisible beings, might, if he 
were living, pass also for a Gnostic. 
</p> 
<p>The Adamites attend mass entirely naked, from motives of 
chastity.  Jean Jacques Rousseau, who took the sleep of the senses for 
chastity, and who saw in modesty only a refinement of pleasure, inclined 
towards Adamism.  I know such a sect, whose members usually 
celebrate their mysteries in the costume of Venus coming from the bath. 
</p> 
<p>The Pre-Adamites believe that men existed before the first man.  I 
once met a Pre-Adamite.  True, he was deaf and a Fourierist. 
</p> 
<p>The Pelagians deny grace, and attribute all the merit of good 
works to liberty.  The Fourierists, who teach that man's nature and 
passions are good, are reversed Pelagians; they give all to grace, and 
nothing to liberty. 
</p> 
<p>The Socinians, deists in all other respects, admit an original 
revelation.  Many people are Socinians to-day, who do not suspect it, 
and who regard their opinions as new. 
</p> 
<p>The Neo-Christians are those simpletons who admire Christianity 
because it has produced bells and cathedrals.  Base in soul, corrupt in 
heart, dissolute in mind and senses, the Neo-Christians seek especially 
after the external form, and admire religion, as they love women, for its 
physical beauty.  They believe in a coming revelation, as well as a 
transfiguration of Catholicism.  They will sing masses at the grand 
spectacle in the phalanstery. 
 
 
<pb n="416"/>  
For my part, I am not at all surprised, although at present I have no 
recollection of it.  One thing is sure, &mdash; that my superstition and credulity 
reached their height at the very period of my life which my critics 
reproachfully assign as the date of my Fourieristic beliefs.  Now I hold 
quite other views.  My mind no longer admits that which is demonstrated 
by syllogisms, analogies, or metaphors, which are the methods of the 
phalanstery, but demands a process of generalization and induction which 
excludes error.  Of my past <hi rend="italic">opinions</hi>, I retain absolutely 
none.  I have acquired some <hi rend="italic">knowledge</hi>.  I no longer 
<hi rend="italic">believe</hi>.  I either <hi rend="italic">know</hi>, or am <hi rend="italic">igno-rant</hi>.  In a word, in seeking for the reason of things, I saw that I 
was a <hi rend="italic">rationalist</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Undoubtedly, it would have been simpler to begin where I have 
ended.  But then, if such is the law of the human mind; if all society, for 
six thousand years, has done nothing but fall into error; if all mankind 
are still buried in the darkness of faith, deceived by their prejudices and 
passions, guided only by the instinct of their leaders; if my accusers, 
themselves, are not free from sectarianism (for they call themselves 
<hi rend="italic">Fourierists</hi>), &mdash; am I alone inexcusable for having, in my 
inner self, at the secret tribunal of my conscience, begun anew the 
journey of our poor humanity? 
</p> 
<p>I would by no means, then, deny my errors; but, sir, that which 
distinguishes me from those who rush into print is the fact that, though 
my thoughts have varied much, my writings do not vary.  To-day, even, 
and on a multitude of questions, I am beset by a thousand extravagant 
and contradictory opinions; but my opinions I do not print, for the public 
has nothing to do with them.  Before addressing my fellow-men, I wait 
until light breaks in upon the chaos of my ideas, in order that what I 
may say may be, not the whole truth (no man can know that), but 
nothing but the truth. 
 
<pb n="417"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>This singular disposition of my mind to first identify itself with a 
system in order to better understand it, and then to reflect upon it in 
order to test its legitimacy, is the very thing which disgusted me with 
Fourier, and ruined in my esteem the societary school.  To be a faithful 
Fourierist, in fact, one must abandon his reason and accept every thing 
from a master, &mdash; doctrine, interpretation, and application.  M. Consid-&eacute;rant, whose excessive intolerance anathematizes all who do not 
abide by his sovereign decisions, has no other conception of Fourierism.  
Has he not been appointed Fourier's vicar on earth and pope of a Church 
which, unfortunately for its apostles, will never be of this world?  
Passive belief is the theological virtue of all sectarians, especially of the 
Fourierists. 
</p> 
<p>Now, this is what happened to me.  While trying to demonstrate 
by argument the religion of which I had become a follower in studying 
Fourier, I suddenly perceived that by reasoning I was becoming 
incredulous; that on each article of the creed my reason and my faith 
were at variance, and that my six weeks' labor was wholly lost.  I saw 
that the Fourierists &mdash; in spite of their inexhaustible gabble, and their 
extravagant pretension to decide in all things &mdash; were neither 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, nor logicians, nor even believers; that they were 
<hi rend="italic">scientific quacks</hi>, who were led more by their self-love 
than their conscience to labor for the triumph of their sect, and to whom 
all means were good that would reach that end.  I then understood why 
to the Epicureans they promised women, wine, music, and a sea of 
luxury; to the rigorists, maintenance of marriage, purity of morals, and 
temperance; to laborers, high wages; to proprietors, large incomes; to 
philosophers, solutions the secret of which Fourier alone possessed; to 
priests, a costly religion and magnificent festivals; to 
<hi rend="italic">savants</hi>,  
<pb n="418"/>  
knowledge of an unimaginable nature; to each, indeed, that which he 
most desired.  In the beginning, this seemed to me droll; in the end, I 
regarded it as the height of impudence.  No, sir; no one yet knows of the 
foolishness and infamy which the phalansterian system contains.  That is 
a subject which I mean to treat as soon as I have balanced my accounts 
with property.[1] 
</p> 
<p>It is rumored that the Fourierists think of leaving France and going 
to the new world to found a phalanstery.  When a house threatens to fall, 
the rats scamper away; that is because they are rats.  Men do better; they 
rebuild it.  Not long since, the St. Simonians, despairing of their country 
which paid no heed to them, proudly shook the dust from their feet, and 
started for the Orient to fight the battle of free woman.  Pride, 
wilfulness, mad selfishness!  True charity, like true faith, does not 
worry, never despairs; it seeks neither its own glory, nor its interest, nor 
empire; it does every thing for all, speaks with indulgence to the reason 
and the will, and desires to conquer only by persuasion and sacrifice.  
Remain in France, Fourierists, if the progress of humanity is the only 
thing which you have at heart!  There is more to do here than in the new 
world.  Otherwise, go! you are nothing but liars and hypocrites! 
</p> 
<p>The foregoing statement by no means embraces all the political 
elements, all the opinions and tendencies, which threaten the future of 
property; but it ought to satisfy any 
 
 
[1]  It should be understood that the above refers only to the moral and 
political doctrines of Fourier, &mdash; doctrines which, like all philosophical 
and religious systems, have their root and <hi rend="italic">raison 
d'existence</hi> in society itself, and for this reason deserve to be 
examined.  The peculiar speculations of Fourier and his sect concerning 
cosmogony, geology, natural history, physiology, and psychology, I 
leave to the attention of those who would think it their duty to seriously 
refute the fables of Blue Beard and the Ass's Skin. 
 
 
 
 
<pb n="419"/>  
one who knows how to classify facts, and to deduce their law or the idea 
which governs them.  Existing society seems abandoned to the demon of 
falsehood and discord; and it is this sad sight which grieves so deeply 
many distinguished minds who lived too long in a former age to be able 
to understand ours.  Now, while the short-sighted spectator begins to 
despair of humanity, and, distracted and cursing that of which he is 
ignorant, plunges into scepticism and fatalism, the true observer, certain 
of the spirit which governs the world, seeks to comprehend and fathom 
Providence.  The memoir on &ldquo;Property,&rdquo; published last 
year by the pensioner of the Academy of Besan&ccedil;on, is simply a 
study of this nature. 
</p> 
<p>The time has come for me to relate the history of this unlucky 
treatise, which has already caused me so much chagrin, and made me so 
unpopular; but which was on my part so involuntary and unpremeditated, 
that I would dare to affirm that there is not an economist, not a 
philosopher, not a jurist, who is not a hundred times guiltier than I.  
There is something so singular in the way in which I was led to attack 
property, that if, on hearing my sad story, you persist, sir, in your 
blame, I hope at least you will be forced to pity me. 
</p> 
<p>I never have pretended to be a great politician; far from that, I 
always have felt for controversies of a political nature the greatest 
aversion; and if, in my &ldquo;Essay on Property,&rdquo; I have 
sometimes ridiculed our politicians, believe, sir, that I was governed 
much less by my pride in the little that I know, than by my vivid 
consciousness of their ignorance and excessive vanity.  Relying more on 
Providence than on men; not suspecting at first that politics, like every 
other science, contained an absolute truth; agreeing equally well with 
Bossuet and Jean Jacques, &mdash; I accepted with resignation my share of 
human misery, and contented myself with praying to God for  
<pb n="420"/>  
good deputies, upright ministers, and an honest king.  By taste as well as 
by discretion and lack of confidence in my powers, I was slowly 
pursuing some commonplace studies in philology, mingled with a little 
metaphysics, when I suddenly fell upon the greatest problem that ever 
has occupied philosophical minds:  I mean the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of 
certainty. 
</p> 
<p>Those of my readers who are unacquainted with the philosophical 
terminology will be glad to be told in a few words what this 
<hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> is, which plays so great a part in my work. 
</p> 
<p>The <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of certainty, according to the 
philosophers, will be, when discovered, an infallible method of 
establishing the truth of an opinion, a judgment, a theory, or a system, 
in nearly the same way as gold is recognized by the touchstone, as iron 
approaches the magnet, or, better still, as we verify a mathematical 
operation by applying the <hi rend="italic">proof</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> has 
hitherto served as a sort of <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> for society.  Thus, the 
primitive men &mdash; having observed that they were not all equal in strength, 
beauty, and labor &mdash; judged, and rightly, that certain ones among them 
were called by nature to the performance of simple and common 
functions; but they concluded, and this is where their error lay, that 
these same individuals of duller intellect, more restricted genius, and 
weaker personality, were predestined to <hi rend="italic">serve</hi> the others; 
that is, to labor while the latter rested, and to have no other will than 
theirs: and from this idea of a natural subordination among men sprang 
domesticity, which, voluntarily accepted at first, was imperceptibly 
converted into horrible slavery.  Time, making this error more palpable, 
has brought about justice.  Nations have learned at their own cost that 
the subjection of man to man is a false idea, an erroneous theory, 
pernicious alike to master and to slave.  And yet such a social system 
has stood  
<pb n="421"/>  
several thousand years, and has been defended by celebrated 
philosophers; even to-day, under somewhat mitigated forms, sophists of 
every description uphold and extol it.  But experience is bringing it to an 
end. 
</p> 
<p>Time, then, is the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of societies; thus looked 
at, history is the demonstration of the errors of humanity by the 
argument <hi rend="italic">reductio ad absurdum</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Now, the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> sought for by metaphysicians 
would have the advantage of discriminating at once between the true and 
the false in every opinion; so that in politics, religion, and morals, for 
example, the true and the useful being immediately recognized, we 
should no longer need to await the sorrowful experience of time.  
Evidently such a secret would be death to the sophists, &mdash; that cursed 
brood, who, under different names, excite the curiosity of nations, and, 
owing to the difficulty of separating the truth from the error in their 
artistically woven theories, lead them into fatal ventures, disturb their 
peace, and fill them with such extraordinary prejudice. 
</p> 
<p>Up to this day, the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of certainty remains a 
mystery; this is owing to the multitude of <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> that have 
been successively proposed.  Some have taken for an absolute and 
definite <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> the testimony of the senses; others intui-tion; these evidence; those argument.  M. Lamennais affirms that there 
is no other <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> than universal reason.  Before him, 
M. de Bonald thought he had discovered it in language.  Quite recently, 
M. Buchez has proposed morality; and, to harmonize them all, the 
eclectics have said that it was absurd to seek for an absolute 
<hi rend="italic">criterion</hi>, since there were as many <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> 
as special orders of knowledge. 
</p> 
<p>Of all these hypotheses it may be observed, That the testimony of 
the senses is not a <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi>, because the senses, relating us 
only to phenomena, furnish us with no ideas; that  
<pb n="422"/>  
intuition needs external confirmation or objective certainty; that evidence 
requires proof, and argument verification; that universal reason has been 
wrong many a time; that language serves equally well to express the true 
or the false; that morality, like all the rest, needs demonstration and rule; 
and finally, that the eclectic idea is the least reasonable of all, since it is 
of no use to say that there are several <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> if we cannot 
point out one.  I very much fear that it will be with the <hi rend="italic">cri-terion</hi> as with the philosopher's stone; that it will finally be 
abandoned, not only as insolvable, but as chimerical.  Consequently, I 
entertain no hopes of having found it; nevertheless, I am not sure that 
some one more skilful will not discover it. 
</p> 
<p>Be it as it may with regard to a <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> or 
<hi rend="italic">criteria</hi>, there are methods of demonstration which, when 
applied to certain subjects, may lead to the discovery of unknown truths, 
bring to light relations hitherto unsuspected, and lift a paradox to the 
highest degree of certainty.  In such a case, it is not by its novelty, nor 
even by its content, that a system should be judged, but by its method.  
The critic, then, should follow the example of the Supreme Court, 
which, in the cases which come before it, never examines the facts, but 
only the form of procedure.  Now, what is the form of procedure?  A 
method. 
</p> 
<p>I then looked to see what philosophy, in the absence of a 
<hi rend="italic">criterion</hi>, had accomplished by the aid of special methods, 
and I must say that I could not discover &mdash; in spite of the loudly-proclaimed pretensions of some &mdash; that it had produced any thing of real 
value; and, at last, wearied with the philosophical twaddle, I resolved to 
make a new search for the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi>.  I confess it, to my 
shame, this folly lasted for two years, and I am not yet entirely rid of it.  
It was like seeking a needle in a haystack.  I might have learned 
Chi<pb n="423"/> 
nese or Arabic in the time that I have lost in considering and 
reconsidering syllogisms, in rising to the summit of an induction as to 
the top of a ladder, in inserting a proposition between the horns of a 
dilemma, in decomposing, distinguishing, separating, denying, affirming, 
admitting, as if I could pass abstractions through a sieve. 
</p> 
<p>I selected justice as the subject-matter of my experiments.  Finally, 
after a thousand decompositions, recompositions, and double 
compositions, I found at the bottom of my analytical crucible, not the 
<hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of certainty, but a metaphysico-economico-political treatise, whose conclusions were such that I did not care to 
present them in a more artistic or, if you will, more intelligible form.  
The effect which this work produced upon all classes of minds gave me 
an idea of the spirit of our age, and did not cause me to regret the 
prudent and scientific obscurity of my style.  How happens it that to-day 
I am obliged to defend my intentions, when my conduct bears the evident 
impress of such lofty morality? 
</p> 
<p>You have read my work, sir, and you know the gist of my tedious 
and scholastic lucubrations.  Considering the revolutions of humanity, 
the vicissitudes of empires, the transformations of property, and the 
innumerable forms of justice and of right, I asked, &ldquo;Are the evils 
which afflict us inherent in our condition as men, or do they arise only 
from an error?  This inequality of fortunes which all admit to be the 
cause of society's embarrassments, is it, as some assert, the effect of 
Nature; or, in the division of the products of labor and the soil, may 
there not have been some error in calculation?  Does each laborer 
receive all that is due him, and only that which is due him?  In short, in 
the present conditions of labor, wages, and exchange, is no one 
wronged? &mdash; are the accounts well kept? &mdash; is the social balance 
accurate?&rdquo; 
 
<pb n="424"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>Then I commenced a most laborious investigation.  It was 
necessary to arrange informal notes, to discuss contradictory titles, to 
reply to captious allegations, to refute absurd pretensions, and to 
describe fictitious debts, dishonest transactions, and fraudulent accounts.  
In order to triumph over quibblers, I had to deny the authority of 
custom, to examine the arguments of legislators, and to oppose science 
with science itself.  Finally, all these operations completed, I had to give 
a judicial decision. 
</p> 
<p>I therefore declared, my hand upon my heart, before God and 
men, that the causes of social inequality are three in number:  1. 
<hi rend="italic">Gratuitous appropriation of collective wealth</hi>; 2. 
<hi rend="italic">Inequality in exchange</hi>; 3. <hi rend="italic">The right of profit or 
increase</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>And since this threefold method of extortion is the very essence of 
the domain of property, I denied the legitimacy of property, and 
proclaimed its identity with robbery. 
</p> 
<p>That is my only offence.  I have reasoned upon property; I have 
searched for the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of justice; I have demonstrated, 
not the possibility, but the necessity, of equality of fortunes; I have 
allowed myself no attack upon persons, no assault upon the government, 
of which I, more than any one else, am a provisional adherent.  If I have 
sometimes used the word <hi rend="italic">proprietor</hi>, I have used it as the 
abstract name of a metaphysical being, whose reality breathes in every 
individual, &mdash; not alone in a privileged few. 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, I acknowledge &mdash; for I wish my confession to be 
sincere &mdash; that the general tone of my book has been bitterly censured.  
They complain of an atmosphere of passion and invective unworthy of an 
honest man, and quite out of place in the treatment of so grave a subject. 
</p> 
<p>If this reproach is well founded (which it is impossible for me 
either to deny or admit, because in my own cause I can<pb n="425"/> 
not be judge), &mdash; if, I say, I deserve this charge, I can only humble 
myself and acknowledge myself guilty of an involuntary wrong; the only 
excuse that I could offer being of such a nature that it ought not to be 
communicated to the public.  All that I can say is, that I understand 
better than any one how the anger which injustice causes may render an 
author harsh and violent in his criticisms.  When, after twenty years of 
labor, a man still finds himself on the brink of starvation, and then 
suddenly discovers in an equivocation, an error in calculation, the cause 
of the evil which torments him in common with so many millions of his 
fellows, he can scarcely restrain a cry of sorrow and dismay. 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, though pride be offended by my rudeness, it is not to 
pride that I apologize, but to the proletaires, to the simple-minded, 
whom I perhaps have scandalized.  My angry dialectics may have 
produced a bad effect on some peaceable minds.  Some poor 
workingman &mdash; more affected by my sarcasm than by the strength of my 
arguments &mdash; may, perhaps, have concluded that property is the result of 
a perpetual Machiavelianism on the part of the governors against the 
governed, &mdash; a deplorable error of which my book itself is the best 
refutation.  I devoted two chapters to showing how property springs 
from human personality and the comparison of individuals.  Then I 
explained its perpetual limitation; and, following out the same idea, I 
predicted its approaching disappearance.  How, then, could the editors of 
the &ldquo;Revue D&eacute;mocratique,&rdquo; after having borrowed 
from me nearly the whole substance of their economical articles, dare to 
say:  &ldquo;The holders of the soil, and other productive capital, are 
more or less wilful accomplices in a vast robbery, they being the 
exclusive receivers and sharers of the stolen goods&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>The proprietors <hi rend="italic">wilfully</hi> guilty of the crime of 
robbery!   
<pb n="426"/>  
Never did that homicidal phrase escape my pen; never did my heart 
conceive the frightful thought.  Thank Heaven!  I know not how to 
calumniate my kind; and I have too strong a desire to seek for the reason 
of things to be willing to believe in criminal conspiracies.  The 
millionnaire is no more tainted by property than the journeyman who 
works for thirty sous per day.  On both sides the error is equal, as well 
as the intention.  The effect is also the same, though positive in the 
former, and negative in the latter.  I accused property; I did not 
denounce the proprietors, which would have been absurd: and I am sorry 
that there are among us wills so perverse and minds so shattered that 
they care for only so much of the truth as will aid them in their evil 
designs.  Such is the only regret which I feel on account of my 
indignation, which, though expressed perhaps too bitterly, was at least 
honest, and legitimate in its source. 
</p> 
<p>However, what did I do in this essay which I voluntarily submitted 
to the Academy of Moral Sciences?  Seeking a fixed axiom amid social 
uncertainties, I traced back to one fundamental question all the secondary 
questions over which, at present, so keen and diversified a conflict is 
raging This question was the right of property.  Then, comparing all 
existing theories with each other, and extracting from them that which is 
common to them all, I endeavored to discover that element in the idea of 
property which is necessary, immutable, and absolute; and asserted, after 
authentic verification, that this idea is reducible to that of 
<hi rend="italic">individual and transmissible possession; susceptible of exchange, 
but not of alienation; founded on labor, and not on fictitious occupancy, 
or idle caprice</hi>.  I said, further, that this idea was the result of 
our revolutionary movements, &mdash; the culminating point towards which all 
opinions, gradually divesting themselves of  
<pb n="427"/>  
their contradictory elements, converge.  And I tried to demonstrate this 
by the spirit of the laws, by political economy, by psychology and 
history. 
</p> 
<p>A Father of the Church, finishing a learned exposition of the 
Catholic doctrine, cried, in the enthusiasm of his faith, 
<hi rend="italic">&ldquo;Domine, si error est, a te decepti sumus</hi> (if my 
religion is false, God is to blame).&rdquo;  I, as well as this theologian, 
can say, &ldquo;If equality is a fable, God, through whom we act and 
think and are; God, who governs society by eternal laws, who rewards 
just nations, and punishes proprietors, &mdash; God alone is the author of evil; 
God has lied.  The fault lies not with me.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But, if I am mistaken in my inferences, I should be shown my 
error, and led out of it.  It is surely worth the trouble, and I think I 
deserve this honor.  There is no ground for proscription.  For, in the 
words of that member of the Convention who did not like the guillotine, 
<hi rend="italic">to kill is not to reply</hi>.  Until then, I persist in regarding 
my work as useful, social, full of instruction for public officials, &mdash; 
worthy, in short, of reward and encouragement. 
</p> 
<p>For there is one truth of which I am profoundly convinced, &mdash; 
nations live by absolute ideas, not by approximate and partial 
conceptions; therefore, men are needed who define principles, or at least 
test them in the fire of controversy.  Such is the law, &mdash; the idea first, the 
pure idea, the understanding of the laws of God, the theory: practice 
follows with slow steps, cautious, attentive to the succession of events; 
sure to seize, towards this eternal meridian, the indications of supreme 
reason.  The co-operation of theory and practice produces in humanity 
the realization of order, &mdash; the absolute truth.[1] 
 
 
[1]  A writer for the radical press, M. Louis Raybaud, said, in the 
preface to his &ldquo;Studies of Contemporary Reformers:&rdquo;  
&ldquo;Who does not know that mo- 
 
<pb n="428"/> 
 
</p> 
<p>All of us, as long as we live, are called, each in proportion to his 
strength, to this sublime work.  The only duty which it imposes upon us 
is to refrain from appropriating the truth to ourselves, either by 
concealing it, or by accommodating it to the temper of the century, or by 
using it for our own interests.  This principle of conscience, so grand 
and so simple, has always been present in my thought. 
</p> 
<p>Consider, in fact, sir, that which I might have done, but did not 
wish to do.  I reason on the most honorable hypothesis.  What hindered 
me from concealing, for some years to come, the abstract theory of the 
equality of fortunes, and, at the same time, from criticising constitutions 
and codes; from showing the absolute and the contingent, the immutable 
and the ephemeral, the eternal and the transitory, in laws present and 
past; from constructing a new system of legislation, and establishing on a 
solid foundation this social edifice, ever destroyed and as often rebuilt?  
Might I not, taking up the definitions of casuists, have clearly shown the 
cause of their contradictions and uncertainties, and supplied, at the same 
time, the inadequacies of their conclusions?  Might I not 
<lb/>

rality is relative?  Aside from a few grand sentiments which are 
strikingly instinctive, the measure of human acts varies with nations and 
climates, and only civilization &mdash; the progressive education of the race &mdash; 
can lead to a universal morality. . . .  The absolute escapes our 
contingent and finite nature; the absolute is the secret of God.&rdquo;  
God keep from evil M. Louis Raybaud!  But I cannot help remarking 
that all political apostates begin by the negation of the absolute, which is 
really the negation of truth.  What can a writer, who professes 
scepticism, have in common with radical views?  What has he to say to 
his readers?  What judgment is he entitled to pass upon contemporary 
reformers?  M. Raybaud thought it would seem wise to repeat an old 
impertinence of the legist, and that may serve him for an excuse.  We all 
have these weaknesses.  But I am surprised that a man of so much 
intelligence as M. Raybaud, who <hi rend="italic">studies systems</hi>, fails to 
see the very thing he ought first to recognize, &mdash; namely, that systems are 
the progress of the mind towards the absolute.

have confirmed this labor by a vast historical exposition, in which the 
principle of exclusion, and of the accumulation of property, the 
appropriation of collective wealth, and the radical vice in exchanges, 
would have figured as the constant causes of tyranny, war, and 
revolution? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It should have been done,&rdquo; you say.  Do not 
doubt, sir, that such a task would have required more patience than 
genius.  With the principles of social economy which I have analyzed, I 
would have had only to break the ground, and follow the furrow.  The 
critic of laws finds nothing more difficult than to determine justice: the 
labor alone would have been longer.  Oh, if I had pursued this glittering 
prospect, and, like the man of the burning bush, with inspired counte-nance and deep and solemn voice, had presented myself some day with 
new tables, there would have been found fools to admire, boobies to 
applaud, and cowards to offer me the dictatorship; for, in the way of 
popular infatuations, nothing is impossible. 
</p> 
<p>But, sir, after this monument of insolence and pride, what should I 
have deserved in your opinion, at the tribunal of God, and in the 
judgment of free men?  Death, sir, and eternal reprobation! 
</p> 
<p>I therefore spoke the truth as soon as I saw it, waiting only long 
enough to give it proper expression.  I pointed out error in order that 
each might reform himself, and render his labors more useful.  I 
announced the existence of a new political element, in order that my 
associates in reform, developing it in concert, might arrive more 
promptly at that unity of principles which alone can assure to society a 
better day.  I expected to receive, if not for my book, at least for my 
commendable conduct, a small republican ovation.  And, behold! 
journalists denounce me, academicians curse me, political  
<pb n="430"/>  
adventurers (great God!) think to make themselves tolerable by protesting 
that they are not like me!  I give the formula by which the whole social 
edifice may be scientifically reconstructed, and the strongest minds 
reproach me for being able only to destroy.  The rest despise me, 
because I am unknown.  When the &ldquo;Essay on Property&rdquo; 
fell into the reformatory camp, some asked:  &ldquo;Who has spoken?  
Is it Arago?  Is it Lamennais?  Michel de Bourges or Garnier-Pag&egrave;s?&rdquo;  And when they heard the name of a new man:  
&ldquo;We do not know him,&rdquo; they would reply.  Thus, the 
monopoly of thought, property in reason, oppresses the proletariat as 
well as the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi>.  The worship of the infamous 
prevails even on the steps of the tabernacle. 
</p> 
<p>But what am I saying?  May evil befall me, if I blame the poor 
creatures!  Oh! let us not despise those generous souls, who in the 
excitement of their patriotism are always prompt to identify the voice of 
their chiefs with the truth.  Let us encourage rather their simple 
credulity, enlighten complacently and tenderly their precious sincerity, 
and reserve our shafts for those vain-glorious spirits who are always ad-miring their genius, and, in different tongues, caressing the people in 
order to govern them. 
</p> 
<p>These considerations alone oblige me to reply to the strange and 
superficial conclusions of the &ldquo;Journal du Peuple&rdquo; (issue 
of Oct. 11, 1840), on the question of property.  I leave, therefore, the 
journalist to address myself only to his readers.  I hope that the self-love 
of the writer will not be offended, if, in the presence of the masses, I 
ignore an individual. 
</p> 
<p>You say, proletaires of the &ldquo;Peuple,&rdquo; &ldquo;For 
the very reason that men and things exist, there always will be men who 
will possess things; nothing, therefore, can destroy property.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>In speaking thus, you unconsciously argue exactly after the 
 
<pb n="431"/>  
manner of M. Cousin, who always reasons from 
<hi rend="italic">possession</hi> to <hi rend="italic">property</hi>.  This coincidence, 
however, does not surprise me.  M. Cousin is a philosopher of much 
mind, and you, proletaires, have still more.  Certainly it is honorable, 
even for a philosopher, to be your companion in error. 
</p> 
<p>Originally, the word <hi rend="italic">property</hi> was synonymous with 
<hi rend="italic">proper</hi> or <hi rend="italic">individual possession</hi>.  It 
designated each individual's special right to the use of a thing.  But when 
this right of use, inert (if I may say so) as it was with regard to the other 
usufructuaries, became active and paramount, &mdash; that is, when the 
usufructuary converted his right to personally use the thing into the right 
to use it by his neighbor's labor, &mdash; then property changed its nature, and 
its idea became complex.  The legists knew this very well, but instead of 
opposing, as they ought, this accumulation of profits, they accepted and 
sanctioned the whole.  And as the right of farm-rent necesarily [sic]  
implies the right of use, &mdash; in other words, as the right to cultivate land 
by the labor of a slave supposes one's power to cultivate it himself, 
according to the principle that the greater includes the less, &mdash; the name 
property was reserved to designate this double right, and that of 
possession was adopted to designate the right of use.  Whence property 
came to be called the perfect right, the right of domain, the eminent 
right, the heroic or <hi rend="italic">quiritaire</hi> right, &mdash; in Latin, <hi rend="italic">jus 
perfectum, jus optimum, jus quiritarium, jus dominii</hi>, &mdash; while 
possession became assimilated to farm-rent. 
</p> 
<p>Now, that individual possession exists of right, or, better, from 
natural necessity, all philosophers admit, and can easily e demonstrated; 
but when, in imitation of M. Cousin, we assume it to be the basis of the 
domain of property, we fall into the sophism called <hi rend="italic">sophisma 
amphiboli&aelig; vel ambiguitatis</hi>, which consists in changing the 
meaning by a verbal equivocation. 
 
<pb n="432"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>People often think themselves very profound, because, by the aid 
of expressions of extreme generality, they appear to rise to the height of 
absolute ideas, and thus deceive inexperienced minds; and, what is 
worse, this is commonly called <hi rend="italic">examining abstractions</hi>.  
But the abstraction formed by the comparison of identical facts is one 
thing, while that which is deduced from different acceptations of the 
same term is quite another.  The first gives the universal idea, the 
axiom, the law; the second indicates the order of generation of ideas.  
All our errors arise from the constant confusion of these two kinds of 
abstractions.  In this particular, languages and philosophies are alike 
deficient.  The less common an idiom is, and the more obscure its terms, 
the more prolific is it as a source of error: a philosopher is sophistical in 
proportion to his ignorance of any method of neutralizing this 
imperfection in language.  If the art of correcting the errors of speech by 
scientific methods is ever discovered, then philosophy will have found its 
<hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of certainty. 
</p> 
<p>Now, then, the difference between property and possession being 
well established, and it being settled that the former, for the reasons 
which I have just given, must necessarily disappear, is it best, for the 
slight advantage of restoring an etymology, to retain the word 
<hi rend="italic">property</hi>?  My opinion is that it would be very unwise to 
do so, and I will tell why.  I quote from the &ldquo;Journal du 
Peuple:&rdquo; &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To the legislative power belongs the right to regulate 
property, to prescribe the conditions of acquiring, possessing, and 
transmitting it. . .  It cannot be denied that inheritance, assessment, 
commerce, industry, labor, and wages require the most important 
modifications.&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>You wish, proletaires, to <hi rend="italic">regulate property;</hi> that is, 
you wish to destroy it and reduce it to the right of possession.  For to 
regulate property without the consent of the proprie 
<pb n="433"/>  
tors is to deny the right <hi rend="italic">of domain;</hi> to associate employees 
with proprietors is to destroy the <hi rend="italic">eminent</hi> right; to 
suppress or even reduce farm-rent, house-rent, revenue, and increase 
generally, is to annihilate <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> property.  Why, then, 
while laboring with such laudable enthusiasm for the establishment of 
equality, should you retain an expression whose equivocal meaning will 
always be an obstacle in the way of your success? 
</p> 
<p>There you have the first reason &mdash; a wholly philosophical one &mdash; for 
rejecting not only the thing, but the name, property.  Here now is the 
political, the highest reason. 
</p> 
<p>Every social revolution &mdash; M. Cousin will tell you &mdash; is effected 
only by the realization of an idea, either political, moral, or religious.  
When Alexander conquered Asia, his idea was to avenge Greek liberty 
against the insults of Oriental despotism; when Marius and C&aelig;sar 
overthrew the Roman patricians, their idea was to give bread to the 
people; when Christianity revolutionized the world, its idea was to 
emancipate mankind, and to substitute the worship of one God for the 
deities of Epicurus and Homer; when France rose in '89, her idea was 
liberty and equality before the law.  There has been no true revolution, 
says M. Cousin, with out its idea; so that where an idea does not exist, 
or even fails of a formal expression, revolution is impossible.  There are 
mobs, conspirators, rioters, regicides.  There are no revolutionists.  
Society, devoid of ideas, twists and tosses about, and dies in the midst of 
its fruitless labor. 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, you all feel that a revolution is to come, and that 
you alone can accomplish it.  What, then, is the idea which governs you, 
proletaires of the nineteenth century? &mdash; for really I cannot call you 
revolutionists.  What do you think? &mdash; what do you believe? &mdash; what do 
you want?  Be  
<pb n="434"/>  
guarded in your reply.  I have read faithfully your favorite journals, your 
most esteemed authors.  I find everywhere only vain and puerile 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s;</hi> nowhere do I discover an idea. 
</p> 
<p>I will explain the meaning of this word 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi>, &mdash; new, without doubt, to most of you. 
</p> 
<p>By <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi> is generally understood a substance 
which the imagination grasps, but which is incognizable by the senses 
and the reason.  Thus the <hi rend="italic">soporific power</hi> of opium, of 
which Sganarelle speaks, and the <hi rend="italic">peccant humors</hi> of 
ancient medicine, are <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi>.  The 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi> is the support of those who do not wish to 
confess their ignorance.  It is incomprehensible; or, as St. Paul says, the 
<hi rend="italic">argumentum non apparentium</hi>.  In philosophy, the 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi> is often only a repetition of words which add 
nothing to the thought. 
</p> 
<p>For example, when M. Pierre Leroux &mdash; who says so many 
excellent things, but who is too fond, in my opinion, of his Platonic 
formulas &mdash; assures us that the evils of humanity are due to our 
<hi rend="italic">ignorance of life</hi>, M. Pierre Leroux utters an 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;;</hi> for it is evident that if we are evil it is 
because we do not know how to live; but the knowledge of this fact is of 
no value to us. 
</p> 
<p>When M. Edgar Quinet declares that France suffers and declines 
because there is an <hi rend="italic">antagonism</hi> of men and of interests, he 
declares an <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;;</hi> for the problem is to discover 
the cause of this antagonism. 
</p> 
<p>When M. Lamennais, in thunder tones, preaches self-sacrifice and 
love, he proclaims two <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi>; for we need to 
know on what conditions self-sacrifice and love can spring up and exist. 
</p> 
<p>So also, proletaires, when you talk of <hi rend="italic">liberty, 
progress</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">the sovereignty of the people</hi>, you 
make of these naturally intelligible things so many 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi> in space: for, on the one  
<pb n="435"/>  
hand, we need a new definition of liberty, since that of '89 no longer 
suffices; and, on the other, we must know in what direction society 
should proceed in order to be in progress.  As for the sovereignty of the 
people, that is a grosser <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi> than the sovereignty 
of reason; it is the <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;</hi> of 
<hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi>.  In fact, since sovereignty can no more be 
conceived of outside of the people than outside of reason, it remains to 
be ascertained who, among the people, shall exercise the sovereignty; 
and, among so many minds, which shall be the sovereigns.  To say that 
the people should elect their representatives is to say that the people 
should recognize their sovereigns, which does not remove the difficulty 
at all. 
</p> 
<p>But suppose that, equal by birth, equal before the law, equal in 
personality, equal in social functions, you wish also to be equal in 
conditions. 
</p> 
<p>Suppose that, perceiving all the mutual relations of men, whether 
they produce or exchange or consume, to be relations of commutative 
justice, &mdash; in a word, social relations; suppose, I say, that, perceiving 
this, you wish to give this natural society a legal existence, and to 
establish the fact by law, &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>I say that then you need a clear, positive, and exact expression of 
your whole idea, &mdash; that is, an expression which states at once the 
principle, the means, and the end; and I add that that expression is 
<hi rend="italic">association</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>And since the association of the human race dates, at least 
rightfully, from the beginning of the world, and has gradually established 
and perfected itself by successively divesting itself of its negative 
elements, slavery, nobility, despotism, aristocracy, and feudalism, &mdash; I 
say that, to eliminate the last negation of society, to formulate the last 
revolutionary idea, you must change your old rallying-cries, <hi rend="italic">no 
more absolutism,  
<pb n="436"/>  
no more nobility, no more slaves</hi>! into that of <hi rend="italic">no more 
property</hi>! . . . 
</p> 
<p>But I know what astonishes you, poor souls, blasted by the wind of 
poverty, and crushed by your patrons' pride: it is <hi rend="italic">equality</hi>, 
whose consequences frighten you.  How, you have said in your journal, 
&mdash; how can we &ldquo;dream of a level which, being unnatural, is 
therefore unjust?  How shall we pay the day's labor of a Cormenin or a 
Lamennais?&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>Plebeians, listen!  When, after the battle of Salamis, the Athenians 
assembled to award the prizes for courage, after the ballots had been 
collected, it was found that each combatant had one vote for the first 
prize, and Themistocles all the votes for the second.  The people of 
Minerva were crowned by their own hands.  Truly heroic souls! all were 
worthy of the olive-branch, since all had ventured to claim it for 
themselves.  Antiquity praised this sublime spirit.  Learn, proletaires, to 
esteem yourselves, and to respect your dignity.  You wish to be free, 
and you know not how to be citizens.  Now, whoever says 
&ldquo;citizens&rdquo; necessarily says equals. 
</p> 
<p>If I should call myself Lamennais or Cormenin, and some journal, 
speaking of me, should burst forth with these hyperboles, 
<hi rend="italic">incomparable genius, superior mind, consummate virtue, noble 
character</hi>, I should not like it, and should complain, &mdash; first, 
because such eulogies are never deserved; and, second, because they 
furnish a bad example.  But I wish, in order to reconcile you to equality, 
to measure for you the greatest literary personage of our century.  Do 
not accuse me of envy, proletaires, if I, a defender of equality, estimate 
at their proper value talents which are universally admired, and which I, 
better than any one, know how to recognize.  A dwarf can always 
measure a giant: all that he needs is a yardstick. 
 
<pb n="437"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>You have seen the pretentious announcements of 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">L'Esquisse d'une Philosophie</hi>,&rdquo; and you 
have admired the work on trust; for either you have not read it, or, if 
you have, you are incapable of judging it.  Acquaint yourselves, then, 
with this speculation more brilliant than sound; and, while admiring the 
enthusiasm of the author, cease to pity those useful labors which only 
habit and the great number of the persons engaged in them render 
contemptible.  I shall be brief; for, notwithstanding the importance of the 
subject and the genius of the author, what I have to say is of but little 
moment. 
</p> 
<p>M. Lamennais starts with the existence of God.  How does he 
demonstrate it?  By Cicero's argument, &mdash; that is, by the consent of the 
human race.  There is nothing new in that.  We have still to find out 
whether the belief of the human race is legitimate; or, as Kant says, 
whether our subjective certainty of the existence of God corresponds 
with the objective truth.  This, however, does not trouble M. Lamennais.  
He says that, if the human race believes, it is because it has a reason for 
believing.  Then, having pronounced the name of God, M. Lamennais 
sings a hymn; and that is his demonstration! 
</p> 
<p>This first hypothesis admitted, M. Lamennais follows it with a 
second; namely, that there are three persons in God.  But, while 
Christianity teaches the dogma of the Trinity only on the authority of 
revelation, M. Lamennais pretends to arrive at it by the sole force of 
argument; and he does not perceive that his pretended demonstration is, 
from beginning to end, anthropomorphism, &mdash; that is, an ascription of the 
faculties of the human mind and the powers of nature to the Divine 
substance.  New songs, new hymns! 
</p> 
<p>God and the Trinity thus <hi rend="italic">demonstrated</hi>, the 
philosopher passes to the creation, &mdash; a third hypothesis, in which M. 
La<pb n="438"/> 
mennais, always eloquent, varied, and sublime, 
<hi rend="italic">demonstrates</hi> that God made the world neither of nothing, 
nor of something, nor of himself; that he was free in creating, but that 
nevertheless he could not but create; that there is in matter a matter 
which is not matter; that the archetypal ideas of the world are separated 
from each other, in the Divine mind, by a division which is obscure and 
unintelligible, and yet substantial and real, which involves intelligibility, 
&amp;c.  We meet with like contradictions concerning the origin of evil.  To 
explain this problem, &mdash; one of the profoundest in philosophy, &mdash; M. 
Lamennais at one time denies evil, at another makes God the author of 
evil, and at still another seeks outside of God a first cause which is not 
God, &mdash; an amalgam of <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi> more or less 
incoherent, borrowed from Plato, Proclus, Spinoza, I might say even 
from all philosophers. 
</p> 
<p>Having thus established his trinity of hypotheses, M. Lamennais 
deduces therefrom, by a badly connected chain of analogies, his whole 
philosophy.  And it is here especially that we notice the syncretism 
which is peculiar to him.  The theory of M. Lamennais embraces all 
systems, and supports all opinions.  Are you a materialist?  Suppress, as 
useless <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi>, the three persons in God; then, 
starting directly from heat, light, and electro-magnetism, &mdash; which, 
according to the author, are the three original fluids, the three primary 
external manifestations of Will, Intelligence, and Love, &mdash; you have a 
materialistic and atheistic cosmogony.  On the contrary, are you wedded 
to spiritualism?  With the theory of the immateriality of the body, you 
are able to see everywhere nothing but spirits.  Finally, if you incline to 
pantheism, you will be satisfied by M. Lamennais, who formally teaches 
that the world is not an <hi rend="italic">emanation</hi> from Divinity, &mdash; which 
is pure pantheism, &mdash; but a <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> of Divinity. 
 
<pb n="439"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>I do not pretend, however, to deny that 
&ldquo;L'Esquisse&rdquo; contains some excellent things; but, by the 
author's declaration, these things are not original with him; it is the 
system which is his.  That is undoubtedly the reason why M. Lamennais 
speaks so contemptuously of his predecessors in philosophy, and disdains 
to quote his originals.  He thinks that, since &ldquo;L'Esquisse&rdquo; 
contains all true philosophy, the world will lose nothing when the names 
and works of the old philosophers perish.  M. Lamennais, who renders 
glory to God in beautiful songs, does not know how as well to render 
justice to his fellows.  His fatal fault is this appropriation of knowledge, 
which the theologians call the <hi rend="italic">philosophical sin</hi>, or the 
<hi rend="italic">sin against the Holy Ghost</hi> &mdash; a sin which will not damn 
you, proletaires, nor me either. 
</p> 
<p>In short, &ldquo;L'Esquisse,&rdquo; judged as a system, and 
divested of all which its author borrows from previous systems, is a 
commonplace work, whose method consists in constantly explaining the 
known by the unknown, and in giving <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi> for 
abstractions, and tautologies for proofs.  Its whole theodicy is a work not 
of genius but of imagination, a patching up of neo-Platonic ideas.  The 
psychological portion amounts to nothing, M. Lamennais openly 
ridiculing labors of this character, without which, however, metaphysics 
is impossible.  The book, which treats of logic and its methods, is weak, 
vague, and shallow.  Finally, we find in the physical and physiological 
speculations which M. Lamennais deduces from his trinitarian 
cosmogony grave errors, the preconceived design of accommodating 
facts to theory, and the substitution in almost every case of hypothesis 
for reality.  The third volume on industry and art is the most interesting 
to read, and the best.  It is true that M. Lamennais can boast of 
<pb n="440"/> 
nothing but his style.  As a philosopher, he has added not a single idea 
to those which existed before him. 
</p> 
<p>Why, then, this excessive mediocrity of M. Lamennais considered 
as a thinker, a mediocrity which disclosed itself at the time of the 
publication of the &ldquo;Essai sur l'Indiff&eacute;rence&rdquo;?  It is 
because (remember this well, proletaires!)  Nature makes no man truly 
complete, and because the development of certain faculties almost always 
excludes an equal development of the opposite faculties; it is because M. 
Lamennais is preeminently a poet, a man of feeling and sentiment.  Look 
at his style, &mdash; exuberant, sonorous, picturesque, vehement, full of 
exaggeration and invective, &mdash; and hold it for certain that no man pos-sessed of such a style was ever a true metaphysician.  This wealth of 
expression and illustration, which everybody admires, becomes in M 
Lamennais the incurable cause of his philosophical impotence.  His flow 
of language, and his sensitive nature misleading his imagination, he 
thinks that he is reasoning when he is only repeating himself, and readily 
takes a description for a logical deduction.  Hence his horror of positive 
ideas, his feeble powers of analysis, his pronounced taste for indefinite 
analogies, verbal abstractions, hypothetical generalities, in short, all sorts 
of <hi rend="italic">entit&eacute;s</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>Further, the entire life of M. Lamennais is conclusive proof of his 
anti-philosophical genius.  Devout even to mysticism, an ardent 
ultramontane, an intolerant theocrat, he at first feels the double influence 
of the religious reaction and the literary theories which marked the 
beginning of this century, and falls back to the middle ages and Gregory 
VII.; then, suddenly becoming a progressive Christian and a democrat, 
he gradually leans towards rationalism, and finally falls into deism.  At 
present, everybody waits at the trap-door.  As for me, though I would 
not swear to it, I am inclined to think  
<pb n="441"/>  
that M. Lamennais, already taken with scepticism, will die in a state of 
indifference.  He owes to individual reason and methodical doubt this 
expiation of his early essays. 
</p> 
<p>It has been pretended that M. Lamennais, preaching now a 
theocracy, now universal democracy, has been always consistent; that, 
under different names, he has sought invariably one and the same thing, 
&mdash; unity.  Pitiful excuse for an author surprised in the very act of 
contradiction!  What would be thought of a man who, by turns a servant 
of despotism under Louis XVI., a demagogue with Robespierre, a 
courtier of the Emperor, a bigot during fifteen years of the Restoration, 
a conservative since 1830, should dare to say that he ever had wished for 
but one thing, &mdash; public order?  Would he be regarded as any the less a 
renegade from all parties?  Public order, unity, the world's welfare, 
social harmony, the union of the nations, &mdash; concerning each of these 
things there is no possible difference of opinion.  Everybody wishes 
them; the character of the publicist depends only upon the means by 
which he proposes to arrive at them.  But why look to M. Lamennais for 
a steadfastness of opinion, which he himself repudiates?  Has he not 
said, &ldquo;The mind has no law; that which I believe to-day, I did 
not believe yesterday; I do not know that I shall believe it to-morrow&rdquo;? 
</p> 
<p>No; there is no real superiority among men, since all talents and 
capacities are combined never in one individual.  This man has the 
power of thought, that one imagination and style, still another industrial 
and commercial capacity.  By our very nature and education, we possess 
only special aptitudes which are limited and confined, and which become 
consequently more necessary as they gain in depth and strength.  
Capacities are to each other as functions and persons; who would dare to 
classify them in ranks?  The finest genius is,  
<pb n="442"/>  
by the laws of his existence and development, the most dependent upon 
the society which creates him.  Who would dare to make a god of the 
glorious child? 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;It is not strength which makes the man,&rdquo; said a 
Hercules of the market-place to the admiring crowd; &ldquo;it is 
character.&rdquo;  That man, who had only his muscles, held force in 
contempt.  The lesson is a good one, proletaires; we should profit by it.  
It is not talent (which is also a force), it is not knowledge, it is not 
beauty which makes the man.  It is heart, courage, will, virtue.  Now, if 
we are equal in that which makes us men, how can the accidental 
distribution of secondary faculties detract from our manhood? 
</p> 
<p>Remember that privilege is naturally and inevitably the lot of the 
weak; and do not be misled by the fame which accompanies certain 
talents whose greatest merit consists in their rarity, and a long and 
toilsome apprenticeship.  It is easier for M. Lamennais to recite a 
philippic, or sing a humanitarian ode after the Platonic fashion, than to 
discover a single useful truth; it is easier for an economist to apply the 
laws of production and distribution than to write ten lines in the style of 
M. Lamennais; it is easier for both to speak than to act.  You, then, who 
put your hands to the work, who alone truly create, why do you wish me 
to admit your inferiority?  But, what am I saying?  Yes, you are inferior, 
for you lack virtue and will!  Ready for labor and for battle, you have, 
when liberty and equality are in question, neither courage nor character! 
</p> 
<p>In the preface to his pamphlet on &ldquo;Le Pays et le Gouverne-ment,&rdquo; as well as in his defence before the jury, M. Lamennais 
frankly declared himself an advocate of property.  Out of regard for the 
author and his misfortune, I shall abstain from characterizing this 
declaration, and from examining these  
<pb n="443"/>  
two sorrowful performances.  M. Lamennais seems to be only the tool of 
a quasi-radical party, which flatters him in order to use him, without 
respect for a glorious, but hence forth powerless, old age.  What means 
this profession of faith?  From the first number of 
&ldquo;L'Avenir&rdquo; to &ldquo;L'Esquisse d'une 
Philosophie,&rdquo; M. Lamennais always favors equality, association, 
and even a sort of vague and indefinite communism.  M. Lamennais, in 
recognizing the right of property, gives the lie to his past career, and 
renounces his most generous tendencies.  Can it, then, be true that in 
this man, who has been too roughly treated, but who is also too easily 
flattered, strength of talent has already outlived strength of will? 
</p> 
<p>It is said that M. Lamennais has rejected the offers of several of 
his friends to try to procure for him a commutation of his sentence.  M. 
Lamennais prefers to serve out his time.  May not this affectation of a 
false stoicism come from the same source as his recognition of the right 
of property?  The Huron, when taken prisoner, hurls insults and threats 
at his conqueror, &mdash; that is the heroism of the savage; the martyr prays 
for his executioners, and is willing to receive from them his life, &mdash; that 
is the heroism of the Christian.  Why has the apostle of love become an 
apostle of anger and revenge?  Has, then, the translator of 
&ldquo;L'Imitation&rdquo; forgotten that he who offends charity cannot 
honor virtue?  Galileo, retracting on his knees before the tribunal of the 
inquisition his heresy in regard to the movement of the earth, and 
recovering at that price his liberty, seems to me a hundred times grander 
than M. Lamennais.  What! if we suffer for truth and justice, must we, 
in retaliation, thrust our persecutors outside the pale of human society; 
and, when sentenced to an unjust punishment, must we decline 
exemption if it is offered to us,  
<pb n="444"/>  
because it pleases a few base satellites to call it a pardon?  Such is not 
the wisdom of Christianity.  But I forgot that in the presence of M. 
Lamennais this name is no longer pronounced.  May the prophet of 
&ldquo;L'Avenir&rdquo; be soon restored to liberty and his friends; 
but, above all, may he henceforth derive his inspiration only from his 
genius and his heart! 
</p> 
<p>O proletaires, proletaires! how long are you to be victimized by 
this spirit of revenge and implacable hatred which your false friends 
kindle, and which, perhaps, has done more harm to the development of 
reformatory ideas than the corruption, ignorance, and malice of the 
government?  Believe me, at the present time everybody is to blame.  In 
fact, in intention, or in example, all are found wanting; and you have no 
right to accuse any one.  The king himself (God forgive me!  I do not 
like to justify a king), &mdash; the king himself is, like his predecessors, only 
the personification of an idea, and an idea, proletaires, which possesses 
you yet.  His greatest wrong consists in wishing for its complete 
realization, while you wish it realized only partially, &mdash; consequently, in 
being logical in his government; while you, in your complaints, are not 
at all so.  You clamor for a second regicide.  He that is without sin 
among you, &mdash; let him cast at the prince of property the first stone! 
</p> 
<p>How successful you would have been if, in order to influence men, 
you had appealed to the self-love of men, &mdash; if, in order to alter the 
constitution and the law, you had placed yourselves within the 
constitution and the law!  Fifty thousand laws, they say, make up our 
political and civil codes.  Of these fifty thousand laws, twenty-five 
thousand are for you, twenty-five thousand against you.  Is it not clear 
that your duty is to oppose the former to the latter, and thus, by the 
argument of contradiction, drive privilege into its last  
<pb n="445"/>  
ditch?  This method of action is henceforth the only useful one, being the 
only moral and rational one. 
</p> 
<p>For my part, if I had the ear of this nation, to which I am attached 
by birth and predilection, with no intention of playing the leading part in 
the future republic, I would instruct the laboring masses to conquer 
property through institutions and judicial pleadings; to seek auxiliaries 
and accomplices in the highest ranks of society, and to ruin all privileged 
classes by taking advantage of their common desire for power and 
popularity.  The petition for the electoral reform has already received 
two hundred thousand signatures, and the illustrious Arago threatens us 
with a million.  Surely, that will be well done; but from this million of 
citizens, who are as willing to vote for an emperor as for equality, could 
we not select ten thousand signatures &mdash; I mean <hi rend="italic">bon&acirc; 
fide</hi> signatures &mdash; whose authors can read, write, cipher, and even 
think a little, and whom we could invite, after due perusal and verbal 
explanation, to sign such a petition as the following: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">To his Excellency the Minister of the 
interior</hi>: &mdash;  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;MONSIEUR LE MINISTRE, &mdash; On the day when a royal 
ordinance, decreeing the establishment of model national workshops, 
shall appear in the `Moniteur,' the undersigned, to the number of 
<hi rend="italic">ten thousand</hi>, will repair to the Palace of the Tuileries, and 
there, with all the power of their lungs, will shout, `Long live Louis 
Philippe!' 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;On the day when the `Moniteur' shall inform the public 
that this petition is refused, the undersigned, to the number of <hi rend="italic">ten 
thousand</hi>, will say secretly in their hearts, `Down with Louis 
Philippe!' &rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>If I am not mistaken, such a petition would have some effect.[1]  
The pleasure of a popular ovation would be well 
 
 
[1]  The electoral reform, it is continually asserted, is not an 
<hi rend="italic">end</hi>, but a <hi rend="italic">means</hi>.  Undoubtedly; but what, 
then, is the end?  Why not furnish an unequivocal explanation of its 
object?  How can the people choose their representatives, 
 
 
 
<pb n="446"/>  
worth the sacrifice of a few millions.  They sow so much to reap 
unpopularity!  Then, if the nation, its hopes of 1830 restored, should feel 
it its duty to keep its promise, &mdash; and it would keep it, for the word of 
the nation is, like that of God, sacred, &mdash; if, I say, the nation, reconciled 
by this act with the public-spirited monarchy, should bear to the foot of 
the throne its cheers and its vows, and should at that solemn moment 
choose me to speak in its name, the following would be the substance of 
my speech: &mdash;  
<lb/> 
<lb/> 
[footnote continued] 
<lb/> 
unless they know in advance the purpose for which they choose them, 
and the object of the commission which they entrust to them? 
</p> 
<p>But, it is said, the very business of those chosen by the people is 
to find out the object of the reform. 
</p> 
<p>That is a quibble.  What is to hinder these persons, who are to be 
elected in future, from first seeking for this object, and then, when they 
have found it, from communicating it to the people?  The reformers have 
well said, that, while the object of the electoral reform remains in the 
least indefinite, it will be only a means of transferring power from the 
hands of petty tyrants to the hands of other tyrants.  We know already 
how a nation may be oppressed by being led to believe that it is obeying 
only its own laws.  The history of universal suffrage, among all nations, 
is the history of the restrictions of liberty by and in the name of the 
multitude. 
</p> 
<p>Still, if the electoral reform, in its present shape, were rational, 
practical, acceptable to clean consciences and upright minds, perhaps one 
might be excused, though ignorant of its object, for supporting it.  But, 
no; the text of the petition determines nothing, makes no distinctions, 
requires no conditions, no guarantee; it establishes the right without the 
duty.  &ldquo;Every Frenchman is a voter, and eligible to 
office.&rdquo;  As well say:  &ldquo;Every bayonet is intelligent, 
every savage is civilized, every slave is free.&rdquo;  In its vague 
generality, the reformatory petition is the weakest of abstractions, or the 
highest form of political treason.  Consequently, the enlightened patriots 
distrust and despise each other.  The most radical writer of the time, &mdash; 
he whose economical and social theories are, without comparison, the 
most advanced, &mdash; M. Leroux, has taken a bold stand against universal 
suffrage and democratic government, and has written an exceedingly 
keen criticism of J. J. Rousseau.  That is undoubtedly the reason why 
M. Leroux is no longer the philosopher of &ldquo;Le National.&rdquo;  
That journal, like Napoleon, does not like men of ideas.  Nevertheless, 
&ldquo;Le National&rdquo; ought to know that he who fights against 
ideas will perish by ideas. 
<lb/>

<pb n="447"/>  
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;SIRE, &mdash; This is what the nation wishes to say to your 
Majesty: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;O King! you see what it costs to gain the applause of the 
citizens.  Would you like us henceforth to take for our motto:  `Let us 
help the King, the King will help us'?  Do you wish the people to cry:  
`THE KING AND THE FRENCH NATION'?  Then abandon these 
grasping bankers, these quarrelsome lawyers, these miserable 
<hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi>, these infamous writers, these dishonored men.  
All these, Sire, hate you, and continue to support you only because they 
fear us.  Finish the work of our kings; wipe out aristocracy and 
privilege; consult with these faithful proletaires, with the nation, which 
alone can honor a sovereign and sincerely shout, `Long live the king!' 
&rdquo; 
 
</p> 
<p>The rest of what I have to say, sir, is for you alone; others would 
not understand me.  You are, I perceive, a republican as well as an 
economist, and your patriotism revolts at the very idea of addressing to 
the authorities a petition in which the government of Louis Philippe 
should be tacitly recognized.  &ldquo;National workshops! it were well 
to have such institutions established,&rdquo; you think; &ldquo;but 
patriotic hearts never will accept them from an aristocratic ministry, nor 
by the courtesy of a king.&rdquo;  Already, undoubtedly, your old 
prejudices have returned, and you now regard me only as a sophist, as 
ready to flatter the powers that be as to dishonor, by pushing them to an 
extreme, the principles of equality and universal fraternity. 
</p> 
<p>What shall I say to you? . . .  That I should so lightly compromise 
the future of my theories, either this clever sophistry which is attributed 
to me must be at bottom a very trifling affair, or else my convictions 
must be so firm that they deprive me of free-will. 
</p> 
<p>But, not to insist further on the necessity of a compromise between 
the executive power and the people, it seems to me, sir, that, in doubting 
my patriotism, you reason very capriciously, and that your judgments are 
exceedingly rash.  You, sir, ostensibly defending government and 
property, are al<pb n="448"/> 
lowed to be a republican, reformer, phalansterian, any thing you wish; I, 
on the contrary, demanding distinctly enough a slight reform in public 
economy, am foreordained a conservative, and likewise a friend of the 
dynasty.  I cannot explain myself more clearly.  So firm a believer am I 
in the philosophy of accomplished facts and the <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi> 
of governmental forms that, instead of destroying that which exists and 
beginning over again the past, I prefer to render every thing legitimate 
by correcting it.  It is true that the corrections which I propose, though 
respecting the form, tend to finally change the nature of the things 
corrected.  Who denies it?  But it is precisely that which constitutes my 
system of <hi rend="italic">statu quo</hi>.  I make no war upon symbols, 
figures, or phantoms.  I respect scarecrows, and bow before bugbears.  I 
ask, on the one hand, that property be left as it is, but that interest on all 
kinds of capital be gradually lowered and finally abolished; on the other 
hand, that the charter be maintained in its present shape, but that method 
be introduced into administration and politics.  That is all.  Nevertheless, 
submitting to all that is, though not satisfied with it, I endeavor to 
conform to the established order, and to render unto C&aelig;sar the 
things that are C&aelig;sar's.  Is it thought, for instance, that I love 
property? . . .  Very well; I am myself a proprietor and do homage to 
the right of increase, as is proved by the fact that I have creditors to 
whom I faithfully pay, every year, a large amount of interest.  The same 
with politics.  Since we are a monarchy, I would cry, 
&ldquo;<hi rend="italic">Long live the king</hi>,&rdquo; rather than suffer 
death; which does not prevent me, however, from demanding that the 
irremovable, inviolable, and hereditary representative of the nation shall 
act with the proletaires against the privileged classes; in a word, that the 
king shall become the leader of the radical party.  Thereby we 
proletaires  
<pb n="449"/>  
would gain every thing; and I am sure that, at this price, Louis Philippe 
might secure to his family the perpetual presidency of the republic.  And 
this is why I think so. 
</p> 
<p>If there existed in France but one great functional inequality, the 
duty of the functionary being, from one end of the year to the other, to 
hold full court of <hi rend="italic">savants</hi>, artists, soldiers, deputies, 
inspectors, &amp;c., it is evident that the expenses of the presidency then 
would be the national expenses; and that, through the reversion of the 
civil list to the mass of consumers, the great inequality of which I speak 
would form an exact equation with the whole nation.  Of this no econo-mist needs a demonstration.  Consequently, there would be no more fear 
of cliques, courtiers, and appanages, since no new inequality could be 
established.  The king, as king, would have friends (unheard-of thing), 
but no family.  His relatives or kinsmen, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">agnats et 
cognats</hi>, &mdash; if they were fools, would be nothing to him; and in no 
case, with the exception of the heir apparent, would they have, even in 
court, more privileges than others.  No more nepotism, no more favor, 
no more baseness.  No one would go to court save when duty required, 
or when called by an honorable distinction; and as all conditions would 
be equal and all functions equally honored, there would be no other 
emulation than that of merit and virtue.  I wish the king of the French 
could say without shame, &ldquo;My brother the gardener, my sister-in-law the milk-maid, my son the prince-royal, and my son the 
blacksmith.&rdquo; His daughter might well be an artist.  That would be 
beautiful, sir; that would be royal; no one but a buffoon could fail to 
understand it. 
</p> 
<p>In this way, I have come to think that the forms of royalty may be 
made to harmonize with the requirements of equality, and have given a 
monarchical form to my republican spirit.   
<pb n="450"/>  
I have seen that France contains by no means as many democrats as is 
generally supposed, and I have compromised with the monarchy.  I do 
not say, however, that, if France wanted a republic, I could not 
accommodate myself equally well, and perhaps better.  By nature, I hate 
all signs of distinction, crosses of honor, gold lace, liveries, costumes, 
honorary titles, &amp;c., and, above all, parades.  If I had my way, no 
general should be distinguished from a soldier, nor a peer of France 
from a peasant.  Why have I never taken part in a review? for I am 
happy to say, sir, that I am a national guard; I have nothing else in the 
world but that.  Because the review is always held at a place which I do 
not like, and because they have fools for officers whom I am compelled 
to obey.  You see, &mdash; and this is not the best of my history, &mdash; that, in 
spite of my conservative opinions, my life is a perpetual sacrifice to the 
republic. 
</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, I doubt if such simplicity would be agreeable to 
French vanity, to that inordinate love of distinction and flattery which 
makes our nation the most frivolous in the world.  M. Lamartine, in his 
grand &ldquo;Meditation on Bonaparte,&rdquo; calls the French 
<hi rend="italic">a nation of Brutuses</hi>.  We are merely a nation of 
Narcissuses.  Previous to '89, we had the aristocracy of blood; then 
every <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> looked down upon the commonalty, and 
wished to be a nobleman.  Afterwards, distinction was based on wealth, 
and the <hi rend="italic">bourgeoisie</hi> jealous of the nobility, and proud of 
their money, used 1830 to promote, not liberty by any means, but the 
aristocracy of wealth.  When, through the force of events, and the 
natural laws of society, for the development of which France offers such 
free play, equality shall be established in functions and fortunes, then the 
beaux and the belles, the <hi rend="italic">savants</hi> and the artists, will form 
new classes.  There is a universal and innate desire  
<pb n="451"/>  
in this Gallic country for fame and glory.  We must have distinctions, be 
they what they may, &mdash; nobility, wealth, talent, beauty, or dress.  I 
suspect MM. Arage and Garnier-Pag&egrave;s of having aristocratic 
manners, and I picture to myself our great journalists, in their columns 
so friendly to the people, administering rough kicks to the compositors in 
their printing offices. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; once said &ldquo;Le National&rdquo; 
in speaking of Carrel, &ldquo;whom we had proclaimed <hi rend="italic">first 
consul</hi>! . . .  Is it not true that the monarchical principle still 
lives in the hearts of our democrats, and that they want universal 
suffrage in order to make themselves kings?  Since &ldquo;Le 
National&rdquo; prides itself on holding more fixed opinions than 
&ldquo;Le Journal des Debats,&rdquo; I presume that, Armand Carrel 
being dead, M. Armand Marrast is now first consul, and M. Garnier-Pag&egrave;s second consul.  In every thing the deputy must give way 
to the journalist.  I do not speak of M. Arago, whom I believe to be, in 
spite of calumny, too learned for the consulship.  Be it so.  Though we 
have consuls, our position is not much altered.  I am ready to yield my 
share of sovereignty to MM. Armand Marrast and Garnier-Pag&egrave;s, the appointed consuls, provided they will swear on 
entering upon the duties of their office, to abolish property and not be 
haughty. 
</p> 
<p>Forever promises!  Forever oaths!  Why should the people trust in 
tribunes, when kings perjure themselves?  Alas! truth and honesty are no 
longer, as in the days of King John, in the mouth of princes.  A whole 
senate has been convicted of felony, and, the interest of the governors 
always being, for some mysterious reason, opposed to the interest of the 
governed, parliaments follow each other while the nation dies of hunger.  
No, no!  No more protectors, no more emperors, no more consuls.  
Better manage our affairs ourselves than  
 
<pb n="452"/>  
 
through agents.  Better associate our industries than beg from 
monopolies; and, since the republic cannot dispense with virtues, we 
should labor for our reform. 
</p> 
<p>This, therefore, is my line of conduct.  I preach emancipation to 
the proletaires; association to the laborers; equality to the wealthy.  I 
push forward the revolution by all means in my power, &mdash; the tongue, the 
pen, the press, by action, and example.  My life is a continual 
apostleship. 
</p> 
<p>Yes, I am a reformer; I say it as I think it, in good faith, and that 
I may be no longer reproached for my vanity.  I wish to convert the 
world.  Very likely this fancy springs from an enthusiastic pride which 
may have turned to delirium; but it will be admitted at least that I have 
plenty of company, and that my madness is not monomania.  At the 
present day, everybody wishes to be reckoned among the lunatics of 
Beranger.  To say nothing of the Babeufs, the Marats, and the 
Robespierres, who swarm in our streets and workshops, all the great 
reformers of antiquity live again in the most illustrious personages of our 
time.  One is Jesus Christ, another Moses, a third Mahomet; this is 
Orpheus, that Plato, or Pythagoras.  Gregory VII., himself, has risen 
from the grave together with the evangelists and the apostles; and it may 
turn out that even I am that slave who, having escaped from his master's 
house, was forthwith made a bishop and a reformer by St. Paul.  As for 
the virgins and holy women, they are expected daily; at present, we have 
only Aspasias and courtesans. 
</p> 
<p>Now, as in all diseases, the diagnostic varies according to the 
temperament, so my madness has its peculiar aspects and distinguishing 
characteristic. 
</p> 
<p>Reformers, as a general thing, are jealous of their 
<hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi>; they suffer no rivals, they want no partners; 
they have dis 
<pb n="453"/>  
ciples, but no co-laborers.  It is my desire, on the contrary, to 
communicate my enthusiasm, and to make it, as far as I can, epidemic.  
I wish that all were, like myself, reformers, in order that there might be 
no more sects; and that Christs, Anti-Christs, and false Christs might be 
forced to understand and agree with each other. 
</p> 
<p>Again, every reformer is a magician, or at least desires to become 
one.  Thus Moses, Jesus Christ, and the apostles, proved their mission 
by miracles.  Mahomet ridiculed miracles after having endeavored to 
perform them.  Fourier, more cunning, promises us wonders when the 
globe shall be covered with phalansteries.  For myself, I have as great a 
horror of miracles as of authorities, and aim only at logic.  That is why I 
continually search after the <hi rend="italic">criterion</hi> of certainty.  I work 
for the reformation of ideas.  Little matters it that they find me dry and 
austere.  I mean to conquer by a bold struggle, or die in the attempt; and 
whoever shall come to the defence of property, I swear that I will force 
him to argue like M. Consid&eacute;rant, or philosophize like M. 
Troplong. 
</p> 
<p>Finally, &mdash; and it is here that I differ most from my compeers, &mdash; I 
do not believe it necessary, in order to reach equality, to turn every 
thing topsy-turvy.  To maintain that nothing but an overturn can lead to 
reform is, in my judgment, to construct a syllogism, and to look for the 
truth in the regions of the unknown.  Now, I am for generalization, 
induction, and progress.  I regard general disappropriation as impossible: 
attacked from that point, the problem of universal association seems to 
me insolvable.  Property is like the dragon which Hercules killed: to 
destroy it, it must be taken, not by the head, but by the tail, &mdash; that is, by 
profit and interest. 
</p> 
<p>I stop.  I have said enough to satisfy any one who can  
<pb n="454"/>  
read and understand.  The surest way by which the government can 
baffle intrigues and break up parties is to take possession of science, and 
point out to the nation, at an already appreciable distance, the rising 
oriflamme of equality; to say to those politicians of the tribune and the 
press, for whose fruitless quarrels we pay so dearly, &ldquo;You are 
rushing forward, blind as you are, to the abolition of property; but the 
government marches with its eyes open.  You hasten the future by 
unprincipled and insincere controversy; but the government, which 
knows this future, leads you thither by a happy and peaceful transition.  
The present generation will not pass away before France, the guide and 
model of civilized nations, has regained her rank and legitimate 
influence.&rdquo; 
</p> 
<p>But, alas! the government itself, &mdash; who shall enlighten it?  Who 
can induce it to accept this doctrine of equality, whose terrible but 
decisive formula the most generous minds hardly dare to 
acknowledge? . . .  I feel my whole being tremble when I think that the 
testimony of three men &mdash; yes, of three men who make it their business 
to teach and define &mdash; would suffice to give full play to public opinion, to 
change beliefs, and to fix destinies.  Will not the three men be 
found? . . . 
</p> 
<p>May we hope, or not?  What must we think of those who govern 
us?  In the world of sorrow in which the proletaire moves, and where 
nothing is known of the intentions of power, it must be said that despair 
prevails.  But you, sir, &mdash; you, who by function belong to the official 
world; you, in whom the people recognize one of their noblest friends, 
and property its most prudent adversary, &mdash; what say you of our deputies, 
our ministers, our king?  Do you believe that the authorities are friendly 
to us?  Then let the government declare its position; let it print its 
profession of faith in equality, and I am dumb.  Otherwise, I shall 
continue the  
<pb n="455"/>  
war; and the more obstinacy and malice is shown, the oftener will I 
redouble my energy and audacity.  I have said before, and I repeat it, &mdash; 
I have sworn, not on the dagger and the death's-head, amid the horrors 
of a catacomb, and in the presence of men besmeared with blood; but I 
have sworn on my conscience to pursue property, to grant it neither 
peace nor truce, until I see it everywhere execrated.  I have not yet 
published half the things that I have to say concerning the right of 
domain, nor the best things.  Let the knights of property, if there are any 
who fight otherwise than by retreating, be prepared every day for a new 
demonstration and accusation; let them enter the arena armed with reason 
and knowledge, not wrapped up in sophisms, for justice will be done. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;To become enlightened, we must have liberty.  That alone 
suffices; but it must be the liberty to use the reason in regard to all 
public matters. 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;And yet we hear on every hand authorities of all kinds and 
degrees crying:  `Do not reason!' 
 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;If a distinction is wanted, here is one: &mdash;  
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;The <hi rend="italic">public</hi> use of the reason always should 
be free, but the <hi rend="italic">private</hi> use ought always to be rigidly 
restricted.  By public use, I mean the scientific, literary use; by private, 
that which may be taken advantage of by civil officials and public 
functionaries.  Since the governmental machinery must be kept in 
motion, in order to preserve unity and attain our object, we must not 
reason; we must obey.  But the same individual who is bound, from this 
point of view, to passive obedience, has the right to speak in his capacity 
of citizen and scholar.  He can make an appeal to the public, submit to it 
his observations on events which occur around him and in the ranks 
above him, taking care, however, to avoid offences which are 
punishable. 
</p> 
<p>&ldquo;Reason, then, as much as you like; only, obey.&rdquo; &mdash; 
<hi rend="italic">Kant:  Fragment on the Liberty of Thought and of the Press.  
Tissot's Translation</hi>. 
 
</p> 
<p>These words of the great philosopher outline for me my duty.  I 
have delayed the reprint of the work entitled &ldquo;What  
<pb n="456"/>  
is Property?&rdquo; in order that I might lift the discussion to the 
philosophical height from which ridiculous clamor has dragged it down; 
and that, by a new presentation of the question, I might dissipate the 
fears of good citizens.  I now reenter upon the public use of my reason, 
and give truth full swing.  The second edition of the First Memoir on 
Property will immediately follow the publication of this letter.  Before 
issuing any thing further, I shall await the observations of my critics, 
and the co-operation of the friends of the people and of equality. 
</p> 
<p>Hitherto, I have spoken in my own name, and on my own personal 
responsibility.  It was my duty.  I was endeavoring to call attention to 
principles which antiquity could not discover, because it knew nothing of 
the science which reveals them, &mdash; political economy.  I have, then, 
testified as to <hi rend="italic">facts;</hi> in short, I have been a 
<hi rend="italic">witness</hi>.  Now my <hi rend="italic">r&ocirc;le</hi> changes.  It 
remains for me to deduce the practical consequences of the facts 
proclaimed.  The position of <hi rend="italic">public prosecutor</hi> is the only 
one which I am henceforth fitted to fill, and I shall sum up the case in 
the name of the <hi rend="italic">people</hi>. 
</p> 
<p>I am, sir, with all the consideration that I owe to your talent and 
your character, 
 
</p> 
<p>     Your very humble and most obedient servant, 
</p> 
<p>                         P. J. PROUDHON, 
</p> 
<p>                 <hi rend="italic">Pensioner of the Academy of 
Besan&ccedil;on</hi>. 
 
 
</p> 
<p>P.S.  During the session of April 2, the Chamber of Deputies 
rejected, by a very large majority, the literary-property bill, 
<hi rend="italic">because it did not understand it</hi>.  Nevertheless, literary 
property is only a special form of the right of prop 
<pb n="457"/>  
erty, which everybody claims to understand.  Let us hope that this 
legislative precedent will not be fruitless for the cause of equality.  The 
consequence of the vote of the Chamber is the abolition of capitalistic 
property, &mdash; property incomprehensible, contradictory, impossible, and 
absurd.
