<bibl>HENRY KING, Bishop of Chichester, Exequy on the death of his wife.</bibl></epigraph>

 


<p>Ill-fated and mysterious man! &mdash; bewildered in the brilliancy 
of thine own imagination, and fallen in the flames of thine own 
youth!  Again in fancy I behold thee!  Once more thy form hath 
risen before me! &mdash; not &mdash; oh not as thou art &mdash; in the cold valley and 
shadow &mdash; but as thou shouldst be &mdash; squandering away a life of 
magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions, thine own 
Venice &mdash; which is a star-beloved Elysium of the sea, and the wide 
windows of whose Palladian palaces look down with a deep and 
bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters.  Yes!  I 
repeat it &mdash; as thou shouldst be.  There are surely other worlds 
than this &mdash; other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude &mdash; 
other speculations than the speculations of the sophist.  Who 
then shall call thy conduct into question? who blame thee for thy 
visionary hours, or denounce those occupations as a 
wasting away of life, which were but the overflowing of thine 
everlasting energies? 
</p><p>It was at Venice, beneath the covered archway there called 
the Ponte di Sospiri, that I met for the third or fourth time the 
person of whom I speak.  It is with a confused recollection that 
I bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting.  Yet I 
remember &mdash; ah! how should I forget? &mdash; the deep midnight, the Bridge 
of Sighs, the beauty of woman, and the Genius of Romance that 
stalked up and down the narrow canal. 
</p><p>It was a night of unusual gloom.  The great clock of the 
Piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the Italian evening.  The 
square of the Campanile lay silent and deserted, and the lights 
in the old Ducal Palace were dying fast away.  I was returning 
home from the Piazetta, by way of the Grand Canal.  But as my 
gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal San Marco, a 
female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night, in 
one wild, hysterical, and long-continued shriek.  Startled at the 
sound, I sprang upon my feet: while the gondolier, letting slip 
his single oar, lost it in the pitchy darkness 
<pb n="146"/>  
beyond a chance of 
recovery, and we were consequently left to the guidance of the 
current which here sets from the greater into the smaller 
channel.  Like some huge and sable-feathered condor, we were 
slowly drifting down towards the Bridge of Sighs, when a thousand 
flambeaux flashing from the windows, and down the staircases of 
the Ducal Palace, turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid 
and preternatural day. 
</p><p>A child, slipping from the arms of its own mother, had 
fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep 
and dim canal.  The quiet waters had closed placidly over their 
victim; and, although my 
own gondola was the only one in sight, 
many a stout swimmer, already in the stream, was seeking in vain 
upon the surface, the treasure which was to be found, alas! only 
within the abyss.  Upon the broad black marble flagstones at the 
entrance of the palace, and a few steps above the water, stood a 
figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten.  It 
was the Marchesa Aphrodite &mdash; the adoration of all Venice &mdash; the 
gayest of the gay &mdash; the most lovely where all were beautiful &mdash; but 
still the young wife of the old and intriguing Mentoni, and the 
mother of that fair child, her first and only one, who now deep 
beneath the murky water, was thinking in bitterness of heart upon 
her sweet caresses, and exhausting its little life in struggles 
to call upon her name. 
</p><p>She stood alone.  Her small, bare, and silvery feet gleamed 
in the black mirror of marble beneath her.  Her hair, not as yet 
more than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array, 
clustered, amid a shower of diamonds, round and round her 
classical head, in curls like those of the young hyacinth.  A 
snowy-white and gauze-like drapery seemed to be nearly the sole 
covering to her delicate form; but the midsummer and midnight air 
was hot, sullen, and still, and no motion in the statue-like form 
itself, stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapour 
which hung around it as the heavy marble hangs around the Niobe. 
Yet &mdash; strange to say! &mdash; her large lustrous eyes were not turned 
downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest hope lay buried &mdash; 
but riveted in a widely different direction!  The prison of the 
Old Republic is, I think, the stateliest building in all Venice &mdash; 
but how could that lady gaze so fixedly upon it, when beneath her 
lay stifling her only child?  Yon dark, gloomy niche, too, yawns 
right opposite her chamber window &mdash; what, then, could there be in 
its shadows &mdash; in its architecture &mdash; in its ivy-wreathed and solemn 
cornices &mdash; that the Marchesa di Mentoni had not wondered at a 
thousand times before? 
<pb n="147"/>  
Nonsense! &mdash;   Who does not remember that, 
at such a time as this, the eye, like a shattered mirror, 
multiplies the images of its sorrow, and sees in innumerable far-off places the woe which is close at hand? 
</p><p>Many steps above the Marchesa, and within the arch of the 
water-gate, stood, in full dress, the Satyr-like figure of 
Mentoni himself.  He was occasionally occupied in thrumming a 
guitar, and seemed ennuye to the very death, as at intervals he 
gave directions for the recovery of his child.  Stupefied and 
aghast, I had myself no power to move from the upright position I 
had assumed upon first hearing the shriek, and must have 
presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and 
ominous appearance, as with pale countenance and rigid limbs, I 
floated down among them in that funereal gondola. 
</p><p>All efforts proved in vain.  Many of the most energetic in 
the search were relaxing their exertions, and yielding to a 
gloomy sorrow.  There seemed but little hope for the child (how 
much less than for the mother!); but now, from the interior of 
that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a 
part of the Old Republican prison, and as fronting the lattice of 
the Marchesa, a figure muffled in a cloak stepped out within 
reach of the light, and, pausing a moment upon the verge of the 
giddy descent, plunged headlong into the canal.  As, in an 
instant afterwards, he stood with the still living and breathing 
child within his grasp, upon the marble flagstones by the side of the 
Marchesa, his cloak, heavy with the drenching water, became 
unfastened, and, falling in folds about his feet, discovered to 
the wonder-stricken spectators the graceful person of a very 
young man, with the sound of whose name the greater part of 
Europe was then ringing. 
</p><p>No word spoke the deliverer.  But the Marchesa!  She will 
now receive her child &mdash; she will press it to her heart &mdash; she will 
cling to its little form, and smother it with her caresses. 
Alas! another's arms have taken it from the stranger &mdash; another's 
arms have taken it away, and borne it afar off, unnoticed, into 
the palace!  And the Marchesa!  Her lip &mdash; her beautiful lip 
trembles: tears are gathering in her eyes &mdash; those eyes which, like 
Pliny's acanthus, are 'soft and almost liquid'.  Yes! tears are 
gathering in those eyes &mdash; and see! the entire woman thrills 
throughout the soul, and the statue has started into life!  The 
pallor of the marble countenance, the swelling of the marble 
bosom, the very purity of the marble feet, we behold suddenly 
flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson; and a slight 
<pb n="148"/>  
shudder quivers about her delicate frame, as a gentle air at 
Napoli about the rich silver lilies in the grass. 
</p><p>Why should that lady blush!  To this demand there is no 
answer &mdash; except that, having left, in the eager haste and terror 
of a mother's heart, the privacy of her own boudoir, she has 
neglected to enthrall her tiny feet in their slippers, and 
utterly forgotten to throw over her Venetian shoulders that 
drapery which is their due.  What other possible reason could 
there have been for her so blushing? &mdash; for the glance of those 
wild appealing eyes? for the unusual tumult of that throbbing 
bosom? &mdash; for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand? &mdash; that 
hand which fell, as Mentoni turned into the palace, accidentally, 
upon the hand of the stranger.  What reason could there have been 
for the low &mdash; the singularly low tone of those unmeaning words 
which the lady uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu?  'Thou 
hast conquered &mdash; ' she said, or the murmurs of the water deceived 
me &mdash; 'thou hast conquered &mdash; one hour after sunrise &mdash; we shall meet &mdash; 
so let it be!' 
 
                           *<lb/> 
 
</p><p>The tumult had subsided, the lights had died away within the 
palace, and the stranger, whom I now recognized, stood alone upon 
the flags.  He shook with inconceivable agitation, and his eye 
glanced around in search of a gondola.  I could not do less than 
offer him the service of my own; and he accepted the civility. 
Having obtained an oar at the water-gate, we proceeded together 
to his residence, while he rapidly recovered his self-possession, 
and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great 
apparent cordiality. 
</p><p>There are some subjects upon which I take pleasure in being 
minute.  The person of the stranger &mdash; let me call him by this 
title, who to all the world was still a stranger &mdash; the person of 
the stranger is one of these subjects.  In height he might have 
been below rather than above the medium size: although there were 
moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and 
belied the assertion.  The light, almost slender symmetry of his 
figure, promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at 
the Bridge of Sighs, than of that Herculean strength which he has 
been known to wield without an effort, upon occasions of more 
dangerous emergency.  With the mouth and chin of a deity &mdash; 
singular, wild, full, liquid eyes, whose shadows varied from pure 
hazel to intense and brilliant jet &mdash; and a profusion of curling, 
black hair, from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed 
forth at intervals all light and ivory &mdash; his were features 
<pb n="149"/>  
than 
which I have seen none more classically regular, except, perhaps, 
the marble ones of the Emperor Commodus.  Yet his countenance 
was, nevertheless, one of those which all men have seen at some 
period of their lives, and have never afterwards seen again.  It 
had no peculiar &mdash; it had no settled predominant expression to be 
fastened upon the memory; a countenance seen and instantly 
forgotten &mdash; but forgotten with a vague and never-ceasing desire of 
recalling it to mind.  Not that the spirit of each rapid passion 
failed, at any time, to throw its own distinct image upon the 
mirror of that face &mdash; but that the mirror, mirror-like, retained 
no vestige of the passion, when the passion had departed. 
</p><p>Upon leaving him on the night of our adventure, he solicited 
me, in what I thought an urgent manner, to call upon him very 
early the next morning.  Shortly after sunrise, I found myself 
accordingly at his Palazzo, one of those huge structures of 
gloomy, yet fantastic pomp, which tower above the waters of the 
Grand Canal in the vicinity of the Rialto.  I was shown up a 
broad winding staircase of mosaics, into an apartment whose 
unparalleled splendour burst through the opening door with an 
actual glare, making me blind and dizzy with luxuriousness. 
</p><p>I knew my acquaintance to be wealthy.  Report had spoken of 
his possessions in terms which I had even ventured to call terms 
of ridiculous exaggeration.  But as I gazed about me, I could not 
bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in Europe 
could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and 
blazed around. 
</p><p>Although, as I say, the sun had arisen, yet the room was 
still brilliantly lighted up.  I judge from this circumstance, as 
well as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my 
friend, that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the 
preceding night.  In the architecture and embellishments of the 
chamber, the evident design had been to dazzle and astound. 
Little attention had been paid to the decora of what is 
technically called keeping, or to the proprieties of nationality. 
The eye wandered from object to object, and rested upon none &mdash; 
neither the grotesques of the Greek painters, nor the sculptures 
of the best Italian days, nor the huge carvings of untutored 
Egypt.  Rich draperies in every part of the room trembled to the 
vibration of low, melancholy music, whose origin was not to be 
discovered.  The senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting 
perfumes, reeking up from strange convolute censers, together 
with multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of emerald 
<pb n="150"/>  
and 
violet fire.  The rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the 
whole, through windows formed each of a single pane of crimson-tinted glass.  Glancing to and fro, in a thousand reflections, 
from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of 
molten silver, the beams of natural glory mingled at length 
fitfully with the artificial light, and lay weltering in subdued 
masses upon a carpet of rich, liquid-looking cloth of Chili gold. 
</p><p>'Ha! ha! ha! &mdash; ha! ha! ha!' &mdash; laughed the proprietor, 
motioning me to a seat as I entered the room, and throwing himself back at 
full-length upon an ottoman.  'I see,' said he, perceiving that I 
could not immediately reconcile myself to the bienseance of so 
singular a welcome &mdash; 'I see you are astonished at my apartment &mdash; at 
my statues &mdash; my pictures &mdash; my originality of conception in 
architecture and upholstery &mdash; absolutely drunk, eh? with my 
magnificence?  But pardon me, my dear sir,' (here his tone of 
voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality) 'pardon me for my 
uncharitable laughter.  You appeared so utterly astonished. 
Besides, some things are so completely ludicrous that a man must 
laugh or die.  To die laughing must be the most glorious of all 
glorious deaths!  Sir Thomas More &mdash; a very fine man was Sir Thomas 
More &mdash; Sire Thomas More died laughing, you remember.  Also in the 
Absurdities of Ravisius Textor, there is a long list of 
characters who came to the same magnificent end.  Do you know, 
however,' continued he musingly, 'that at Sparta (which is now 
Palaeochori) &mdash; at Sparta, I say, to the west of the citadel, among 
a chaos of scarcely visible ruins, is a kind of socle, upon which 
are still legible the letters &lgr;&agr;&sgr;&mgr;.  They are undoubtedly part of 
&igr;&egr;&lgr;&agr;&sgr;&mgr;&agr;. Now at Sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a 
thousand different divinities.  How exceedingly strange that the 
altar of Laughter should have survived all the others!  But in 
the present instance,' he resumed, with a singular alteration of 
voice and manner, 'I have no right to be merry at your expense. 
You might well have been amazed.  Europe cannot produce anything 
so fine as this, my little regal cabinet.  My other apartments 
are by no means of the same order; mere ultras of fashionable 
insipidity.  This is better than fashion &mdash; is it not?  Yet this 
has but to be seen to become the rage &mdash; that is, with those who 
could afford it at the cost of their entire patrimony.  I have 
guarded, however, against any such profanation.  With one 
exception you are the only human being besides myself and my 
valet, who has been 
<pb n="151"/>  
admitted within the mysteries of these 
imperial precincts, since they have been bedizened as you see!' 
</p><p>I bowed in acknowledgment; for the overpowering sense of 
splendour and perfume, and music, together with the unexpected 
eccentricity of his address and manner, prevented me from 
expressing, in words, my appreciation of what I might have 
construed into a compliment. 
</p><p>'Here,' he resumed, arising and leaning on my arm as he 
sauntered around the apartment &mdash; 'here are paintings from the 
Greeks to Cimabue, and from Cimabue to the present hour.  Many 
are chosen, as you see, with little deference to the opinions of 
Virtu.  They are all, however, fitting tapestry for a chamber 
such as this.  Here too, are some chefs d'oeuvre of the unknown 
great &mdash; and here unfinished designs by men, celebrated in their 
day, whose very names the perspicacity of the academies has left 
to silence and to me.  What think you,' said he, turning abruptly 
as he spoke &mdash; 'what think you of this Madonna della Pieta?' 
</p><p>'It is Guido's own!' I said with all the enthusiasm of my 
nature, for I had been poring intently over its surpassing 
loveliness.  'It is Guido's own! &mdash; how could you have obtained 
it? &mdash; she is undoubtedly in painting what the Venus is in 
sculpture.' 
</p><p>'Ha!' said he thoughtfully, 'the Venus &mdash; the beautiful 
Venus? &mdash; the Venus of the Medici? &mdash; she of the diminutive head and 
the gilded hair?  Part of the left arm' (here his voice dropped 
so as to be heard with difficulty), 'and all the right are 
restorations, and in the coquetry of that right arm lies, I 
think, the quintessence of all affectation.  Give me the Canova! 
The Apollo, too! &mdash; is a copy &mdash; there can be no doubt of it &mdash; blind 
fool that I am, who cannot behold the boasted inspiration of the 
Apollo!  I cannot help &mdash; pity me! &mdash; I cannot help preferring the 
Antinous.  Was it not Socrates who said that the statuary found 
his statue in the block of marble?  Then Michael Angelo was by no 
means original in his couplet &mdash; 
</p> 
<l>     'Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto</l> 
<l>     Che un marmo solo in se non circonscriva.'</l> 
 
<p>It has been, or should be remarked, that, in the manner of 
the true gentleman, we are always aware of a difference from the 
bearing of the vulgar, without being at once precisely able to 
determine in what such difference consists.  Allowing the remark 
to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanour of my 
acquaintance, I felt it, on that eventful morning, still more 
<pb n="152"/>  
fully applicable to his moral temperament and character.  Nor can 
I better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place 
him so essentially apart from all other human beings, than by 
calling it a habit of intense and continual thought, pervading 
even his most trivial actions &mdash; intruding upon his moments of 
dalliance &mdash; and interweaving itself with his very flashes of 
merriment &mdash; like adders which writhe from out the eyes of the 
grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of Persepolis. 
</p><p>I could not help, however, repeatedly observing, through the 
mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly 
descanted upon matters of little importance, a certain air of 
trepidation &mdash; a degree of nervous unction in action and in speech &mdash; 
an unquiet excitability of manner which appeared to me at all 
times unaccountable, and upon some occasions even filled me with 
alarm.  Frequently, too, pausing in the middle of a sentence 
whose commencement he had apparently forgotten, he seemed to be 
listening in the deepest attention, as if either in momentary 
expectation of a visitor, or to sounds which must have had 
existence in his imagination alone. 
</p><p>It was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent 
abstraction, that, in turning over a page of the poet and scholar 
Politian's beautiful tragedy of The Orfeo (the first native 
Italian tragedy) which lay near me upon an ottoman, I discovered 
a passage underlined in pencil.  It was a passage towards the end 
of the third act &mdash; a passage of the most heart-stirring 
excitement &mdash; a passage which, although tainted with impurity, no 
man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion &mdash; no woman 
without a sigh.  The whole page was blotted with fresh tears, 
and, upon the opposite interleaf, were the following English 
lines, written in a hand so very different from the peculiar 
characters of my acquaintance, that I had some difficulty in 
recognizing it as his own.</p>

<p>That these lines were written in English &mdash; a language with 
which I had not believed their author acquainted &mdash; afforded me 
little matter for surprise.  I was too well aware of the extent 
of his acquirements, and of the singular pleasure he took in 
concealing them from observation, to be astonished at any similar 
discovery; but the place of date, I must confess, occasioned me 
no little amazement.  It had been originally written London, and 
afterwards carefully overscored &mdash; not, however, so effectually as 
to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye.  I say this 
occasioned me no little amazement; for I well remember that, in a 
former conversation with my friend, I particularly inquired if he 
had at any time met in London the Marchesa di Mentoni (who for 
some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city), 
when his answer, if I mistake not, gave me to understand that he 
had never visited the metropolis of Great Britain.  I might as 
well here mention, that I have more than once heard (without of 
course giving credit to a report involving so many 
improbabilities), that the person of whom I speak was not only by 
birth, but in education, an Englishman. 
 
                           *<lb/> 
 
</p><p>'There is one painting,' said he, without being aware of my 
notice of the tragedy &mdash; 'there is still one painting which you 
have not seen.'  And throwing aside a drapery, he discovered a 
full-length portrait of the Marchesa Aphrodite. 
</p><p>Human art could have done no more in the delineation of her 
superhuman beauty.  The same ethereal figure which stood before 
me the preceding night upon the steps of the Ducal 
<pb n="154"/>  
Palace, stood 
before me once again.  But in the expression of the countenance, 
which was beaming all over with smiles, there still lurked 
(incomprehensible anomaly!) that fitful stain of melancholy which 
will ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the 
beautiful.  Her right arm lay folded over her bosom.  With her 
left she pointed downwards to a curiously fashioned vase.  One 
small, fairy foot, alone visible, barely touched the earth &mdash; and, 
scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to 
encircle and enshrine her loveliness, floated a pair of the most 
delicately imagined wings.  My glance fell from the painting to 
the figure of my friend, and the vigorous words of Chapman's 
Bussy D'Ambois quivered instinctively upon my lips: 
</p> 
<l>                                   He is up 
</l><l>          There like a Roman statue!  He will stand 
</l><l>          Till Death hath made him marble!</l> 
 
<p>'Come!' he said at length, turning towards a table of richly 
enamelled and massive silver, upon which were a few goblets 
fantastically stained, together with two large Etruscan vases, 
fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the 
foreground of the portrait, and filled with what I supposed to be 
Johannisberger.  'Come!' he said abruptly, 'let us drink!  It is 
early &mdash; but let us drink.  It is indeed early,' he continued, 
musingly, as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the 
apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise &mdash; 'It is indeed 
early, but what matters it?  Let us drink!  Let us pour out an 
offering to yon solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and censers 
are so eager to subdue!'  And, having made me pledge him in a 
bumper, he swallowed in rapid succession several goblets of the 
wine. 
</p><p>'To dream,' he continued, resuming the tone of his desultory 
conversation, as he held up to the rich light of a censer one of 
the magnificent vases &mdash; 'to dream has been the business of my 
life.  I have therefore framed for myself, as you see, a bower of 
dreams.  In the heart of Venice, could I have erected a better? 
You behold around you, it is true, a medley of architectural 
embellishments.  The chastity of Ionia is offended by 
antediluvian devices, and the sphinxes of Egypt are outstretched 
upon carpets of gold.  Yet the effect is incongruous to the timid 
alone.  Proprieties of place, and especially of time, are the 
bugbears which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the 
magnificent.  Once I was myself a decorist: but that sublimation 
<pb n="155"/>  
of folly has palled upon my soul.  All this is now the fitter for 
my purpose.  Like these arabesque censers, my spirit is writhing 
in fire, and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the 
wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither I am now 
rapidly departing.'  He here paused abruptly, bent his head to 
his bosom, and seemed to listen to a sound which I could not 
hear.  At length, erecting his frame, he looked upwards and 
ejaculated the lines of the Bishop of Chichester: &mdash; 
</p> 
<l>          Stay for me there!  I will not fail 
</l><l>             To meet thee in that hollow vale.</l> 
 
<p>In the next instant, confessing the power of the wine, he 
threw himself at full length upon an ottoman. 
</p><p>A quick step was now heard upon the staircase, and a loud 
knock at the door rapidly succeeded.  I was hastening to 
anticipate a second disturbance, when a page of Mentoni's 
household burst into the room, and faltered out, in a voice 
choking with emotion, the incoherent words, 'My mistress! &mdash; my 
mistress! &mdash; poisoned! &mdash; poisoned!  Oh beautiful &mdash; oh beautiful 
Aphrodite!' 
</p><p>Bewildered, I flew to the ottoman, and endeavoured to arouse 
the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence.  But his 
limbs were rigid &mdash; his lips were livid &mdash; his lately beaming eyes 
were riveted in death.  I staggered back towards the table &mdash; my 
hand fell upon a cracked and blackened goblet &mdash; and a 
consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly 
over my soul.
