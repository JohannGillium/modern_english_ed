# DARK WAYS.

     - "Tortured with winter's storms, and tossed with a tumultuous sea." 
    WHEN God's curse forsook my country, it fell on me.  I had  been young and heroic; I had fought well; what portion of the  clock-work of Fate had been allotted me I had utterly performed.   Twelve years ago I became a man and strove for my country's  freedom; now she has attained her heights without me, and I—what  am I?  A shapeless hulk, that stays in the shadow, and that hates  the world and the people of the world, and verily the God above the  world!    

"Fight!" whispered Father Anselmo, the young priest, to me, at  my last shrift; and fight I did.  For from Italy's bosom I had  drawn the strength of sword-arm, hip, and thigh; and I vowed to  lose that arm and life and all that made life dear toward the  trampling of oppressors from the sacred place.  

My sun rose in storm, it continued in storm,—why not so have  set?  Why not have died when swords swept their lightnings about  me, when the glorious thunders of battle rolled around and  sulphurous blasts enveloped, when the air was full of the bray of  bugle and beat of drum, of shout and shriek, exultation and agony?   Why not have gone with the crowd of souls reeking with daring and  desire?  Why, oh, why thus left alone to wither?  Why still hangs  that sun above me, yet wrapt and veiled and utterly obscured in  thick, murk mists of sorrow and despair?  

Peace!—let me tell you my story.  

Since Father Anselmo—like all youth, whether under cowl, cap,  or crown—was a Liberal at heart, I had not wanted counsel; but  when I had told him all my yearnings and aspirations, had bared to  him the throbbings of my very thought, and he had replied in that  one blessed word, I hastened away.  There were none to whom I  should say farewell; I   was alone in the world.  This wild  blood of my veins ran in no other veins; I knew thoroughly the wide  freedom of solitude; the sins and the virtues of my race, whatever  they were, had culminated in me.  As I looked back, that morning,  the castle, planted in a dimple of its demesnes, old and gray and  watched by purple peaks of Apennine, seemed to hide its command  only under the mask of silence.  The wood through which I went,  with its alluring depths, the moss verdant in everlasting spring  beneath my eager feet, each bough I lifted, the blossoms that blew  their gales after, the bearded grasses that shook in the wind, all  gave me their secret sigh; all the sweet land around, the distant  hill, the distant shore, said, "Redeem me from my chains!"  I came  across a sylvan statue, some faun nestled in the forest: the rains  had stained, frosts cracked, suns blistered it; but what of those?   A vine covered with thorns and stemmed with cords had wreathed  about it and bound it closely in serpent-coils.  I stayed and tore  apart the fetters till my hands bled, cut away the twisting  branches, and set the god free from his bonds.  Triumph rose to my  lips, for I said, "So will I free my country!"  Ah, there was my  error,—the shackling vines would grow again, and infold the marble  image that had consecrated the forest-glooms; there is the flaw in  all my work,—I have shorn, but have never uprooted an evil.  Youth  is a fool; the young Titans cannot scale heaven,—heaven, that, if  what I live through be true, is ramparted round with tyrant lies!   But is it true?  Am I what I seem to myself?  Did I fail in my  purpose, in my will?  Did Italy herself belie me?  Did she, did she  I loved, she I worshipped, she the woman to whom I gave all, for  whom I sacrificed all, did she, too, forsake me?  Ah, no! you will  tell me Italy is free.  But I did not free her!  She waits only to  put on in Venice her tiara.  And for that other one, that fair  Austrian woman, that devil whom I serve and adore, that yellow-haired witch who brewed her incantations in my holiest raptures,—  she did not then play me foul, and falsely feign love to win me to  disgrace?  May all the woes in Heaven's hands fall on her!  

God! what have I said?  That I should live to ban her with a  word!  Did I say it?  Oh, but it was vain!  Woe for her?  No, no!  all blessings shower upon her, sunshine attend her, peace and  gladness dwell about her!  Traitress though she were, I must love  her yet; I cannot unlove her; I would take her into my heart, and  fold my arms about her.—Oh, I pray you do not look upon me with  that mocking smile!  Pity me, rather! pity this wretched heart that  longs to curse God and die!—Nay, I want not your idle words.  Can  good destroy?  Can love persecute?  I was a worm that turned.  What  then?  Why not have crushed me to annihilation?  Oh, no, not that!   He took me up and shook me before the world, clipped me, and let me  fall.  I derisive Deity,—why, the words give each other the lie!  

Stop!  Your sad eyes look as if you would go away, but for  this infinite pity in you.  What makes you pity me?  Because I am  shorn of my strength? because of all my fair proportions there is  nothing left unshrivelled? because my body—such as it is—is  racked with hourly and perpetual pain? because I die?  For none of  these?  Truly, your judgments are inscrutable.  For what then?   Because,—yet, no, that cannot be,—because I bear a stubborn  heart? because I will not bend my soul as He has bent my body?   Partly,—but you are witless!  What else?  Because I toss off a  shield and buckler, you say.  Because I will not lean upon a tower  of strength.  Because I will not throw myself on the tide of divine  love, and trust myself to its course.  It was that divine love,  then, that tower of strength, that shield and buckler, that made m  this thing you see.  Tarpeia was enough.  Away with your  generalities!  Go, go, you slave of the past!  

Yet no,—you have not gone?  You believe what you say,—I know  with   those eyes you cannot deceive.  Ah, but I trusted her  eyes once!  Yet it gives you rest;—your sorrows are not like  mine,—there *is* no rest for me.  I cannot go and gather that  balm of Gilead,—I have no legs.  I have as good as none.  This  wheel-chair and that dog of a turnkey are not the equipage for such  a journey.—Ah, do not turn from me now!  My railing is worse than  my cursing, you feel indeed.  Well, stay with me at least, and if  it is twelve years since you shrived me at first, perhaps you shall  shrive me at last,—for I doubt if I am ever brought out to this  sunshine again, if I do not die in the prison-damps tonight,—and  you, with all your change, are Father Anselmo, I think.—Stay, I  will confess to you, confess this.  Man! man! this infinite pity of  your soul for mine throws a light on my dark ways: God's curse has  fallen on me through man's curse, why not God's love through man's  love?  Anselmo, though you became priest, and I went to become  hero, we were children together; I was dear to you then; I am so  still, it seems.  In your love let me find the love of that Heaven  I have defied.—Stay, friend, yet another word.  If man's love can  be so great, what can God's love be?  That which I said I said in  desperation; in very truth, that peace hangs like an unattainable  city in the clouds before my soul's vision, that love like a broad  river flowing through the lands, an atmosphere bathing the worlds,  the subtile essence and ether of space in which the farthest star  pursues its course,—why, then, should it escape me, the mote?  Oh,  when the world turned from me, I sought to flee thither!  I sighed  for the rest there!  Wretched, alone, I have wept in the dark and  in the light that I might go and fling myself at the heavenly feet.   But, do you see? sin has broken down the bridge between God and me.   Yet why, then, is sin in the world,—that scum that rises in the  creation and fermentation of good,—why, but *as* a bridge on  which to re-seek those shores from which we wander?  Man, I do  repent me,—in loving you I find God.  And you call that  blasphemy!—Nay, go, indeed, my friend!  So humble, you are not the  man for me.  I can talk to the winds: they, at least, do not visit  me too roughly.  

These are thy tears, Anselmo?  Thou a priest, yet a man?   Still with me?  Yet thou wilt have to bear with wayward moods,—  scorn now, quiet then.  I am a tetchy man; I am an old man, too,  though but just past thirty.—So!  I thank God for thee, dear  friend!    

Anselmo, look out on this scene below us here, as we sit on  our lofty battlement.  Not on the turrets of the loopholes, the  grates and spikes, or all the fortified horror,—but on the earth.   It is fair earth, though not Italy; this is a mountain-fortress;  here are all the lights and shadows that play over grand hill-countries, and yonder are fields of grain, where the winds and  sunbeams play at storm, and a little hamlet's sheltered valley.   Doubtless there are towers, besides, half hidden in the hills.  It  is Austria: slaves tread it, and tyrants drain it, it is true,—but  the wild, free gypsies troop now and then across it, and though no  fiction of law supports a claim they would scorn to make, they use  it so that you would swear they own it.  Do you see how this iron  reticulation of social rule and custom and force makes a  scaffolding on which this tameless race build up their lives?  I  watch them often.  Each country has its compensations.  Anselmo,  this first made me tremble in my petty defiance,—I, an ephemera of  May, defying the dominations of eternity!—Not so,—not too lowly;  I also am, and each limitation of life is as well, a domination of  eternity.  But I saw that it was no purpose of God to have  destroyed Italy; when men in weakness and wantonness suffered their  liberties to be torn from them, suffered themselves to become  enslaved, there was compensation in that their sons had chance for  heroic growth; they might, in efforts for freedom, create virtues  that, born to freedom, they would   never have known.  I,  too, had my field; I lost it; my enemy was myself.  But when I  think of her—  Ay, there it is!  Do not let me think of her!  I  become mad, when I think of her!—At least, allow me this: God's  ways are dark.  Not that?  Not even that?  I needed what I have?   If my ambitions, my passions, my will, had ruled, my soul would  have remained null?  Ah, friend, and is that so much the worse?  It  is the soul that aches!—I am a man of the people, a man who acts,--I *was*, I mean,—not a man who thinks; and all your subtleties  of word perchance entrap me.  I am not wary when you come to logic.   See!  I surrender point after point.  I shall be dead soon, you  know; when this morning's sun shall have set, when the moon shall  hold the night in fee, I shall depart,—wing up and away;—is it,  that, my body already dead, my mind sickens and dies with it, bit  after bit, and so I yield, and attest, that, without the agony of  my life, death had failed to burst my soul's husk?  Oh, for I was  born of an earthy race, blood ran thick in our veins, we were  sensuous and passionate, the breath and steam of pleasure stifled  our brains, and our filmy eyes could not see heaven.  Yes, yes, I  needed it all; but, friend, it is pitiful.    

I like to sit here in the sun.  It is only a twelvemonth, of  all my long years' imprisonment, that this has been allowed me.  I  like to sleep in it, like any wild creature,—the lizard, a mere  reptile,—the bird, a hindered soul.  To lie thus, weak as I am,  but pillowed and warmed by the searching genial rays, seems such  comfort, when I think of the bed I once had on the rack!  This  little slumber from which I wake revives me.  I feared not to find  you, and did not unclose my eyes at once.  It was good in you to  come, Anselmo; it must have been at risk of much.  

You ask me to speak of my life since I went away on that  morning of your command,—to reconcile the hostile acts, to gather  the scattered reports.  Hear it all!  

You know my wealth was equal to my demand.  I used it; before  six months were over, I was the life and soul of those who must  needs be conspirators.  They saw that I was earnest, that my  sacrifices were real; they trusted me.  Soon the movement had  become general; all the smothered elements of national life were  convulsed and throbbing under the crust of tyranny.  

How proud and glad was I that morning after our victory!  I  saw great Italy, beautiful Italy, once more put on her diadem; I  beheld the future prospect of one broad, free land, barriered by  Alps and set impregnably in summer seas, storied seas, keys of the  West and East.  We embraced each other as brothers of this glorious  nation, ancient Rome risen from trance; as we walked the streets,  we sand; Milan was turbulent with gladness; no gala-day was ever  half so bright; the very spires appeared to spring in the white  radiance of their flames up a deeper heaven; the sun stayed at  perpetual dawn for us.  Walking along, jubilant and daring, at  length we paused in a square where a fountain dashed up its column  of sunshine, and laved our hands.  By Heaven!  We forgot  independence, Italy, freedom; we were crazed with success and hope;  it seemed that the stream was Austrian blood!  Then, in the midst  of all, I looked up,—and on a balcony she stood.  A fair woman,  with hair like shredded light, her great blue eyes wide and full  and of intense dye, her nostril distended with pride, and fear and  hate of us,—but on the full lips, ripe with crimson bloom, juicy  and young and fresh, on those Love lay.  The others wound forward,--I with them, yet apart; and my eyes became fixed on hers.  Then I  lifted my cap with its tricolor.  She did not return the courtesy,  but stood as if spellbound, one hand threading back the straying  hair, the lips a little parted; suddenly she turned to fly, that  hand upraised to the casement's side, and still, as she looked  back, the beautiful eyes on mine.  My companions had preceded me;  we were alone in the square; she wavered as she stood, then tore a    rose from her bosom, kissed it deep into its heart, and  tossed it to me.  

"Let all its petals be joys!" I said, and she vanished.  

Oh, friend, the leaves have fallen, the rose is dead!  Look!   I have kept it through all,—sear leaf and withered spray!  

That night we danced; and the Austrian girl was there.  They  told me she was exiled, and that she loved liberty; no one told me  she was a spy.  I saw her swim along the dance, the white satin of  her raiment flashing perpetual interchange of lustrous and obscure,  the warm air playing in the lace that fell like the spray of the  fountain round her golden hair and over her pearly shoulder; grace  swept in all her motions, beauty crowned her, she seemed the  perfect pitch of womanhood.  

Still she swims along the lazy line with indolent pleasure,  still floats in dreamy waltz-circles perchance, still bends to the  swaying tune as the hazel-branch bends to the hidden treasure,—but  as for me, my dancing days are over.  

By-and-by it was I with whom she danced, whose hand she  touched, on whom she leaned.  I wondered if there were any man so  blest; I listened to her breath, I watched her cheek, our eyes met,  and I loved her.  The music grew deeper, more impassioned; we stood  and listened to it,—for she danced then no more,—our hearts beat  time to it, the wind wandering at the casement played in its  measure; we said no words, but now and then each sought the other's  glance, and, convicted there, turned in sudden shame away.  When I  bade her good-night, which I might never have done but that the  revel broke, a great curl of her hair blew across my lips.  I was  bold,—I was heated, too, with this half-secret life of my heart,  this warm blood that went leaping so riotously through my veins,  and yet so silently,—I took my dagger from my belt and severed the  curl.  See, friend! will you look at it?  It is like the little  gold snakes of the Campagna, is it not? each thread, so fine and  fair, a separate ray of light: once it was part of her!  See how it  twists round my hand!  Haste! haste! let me put it up, lest I go  mad!—Where was I?  

I busied myself again in the work to be done; because of our  victory we must not rest; once more all went forward.  I saw the  Austrian woman only from a window, or in a church, or as she walked  in the gardens, for many days.  Then the times grew hotter; I left  the place, and lived with stern alarums; and thither she also came.   I never sought what sent her.  She was with the wounded, with the  dying.  Then the need of her was past, and she and all the others  took their way.  At length that also came to an end.  

We were in Rome,—and thither, some time previously, she had  gone.  

One night, our business for the day was over, our plans for  the morrow laid, our messages received, our messengers despatched,  and those who had been conspirators and now bade fair to be  saviours were sleeping.  Sleep seemed to fold the world; each bough  and twig was silent in repose; the spectral moonlight itself slept  as it bathed the air.  I alone wandered and waked.  With me there  were too many cares for rest; work kept me on the alert; to court  slumber at once was not easy after the nervous tension of duty.  I  was torn, too, with conflicting feelings: half my soul went one way  in devotion to my country, half my soul swerved to the other as I  thought of the Austrian woman.  I grew tired of the streets and  squares; something that should be fragrant and bowery attracted me.   I mounted on the broken water-god of a dry bath and leaped a  garden-wall.  

No sooner was I there than I knew why I had come.  This was  her garden.  

Heart of Heaven! how all things spoke of her!  How the great  white roses hung their doubly heavy heads and poured their perfume  out to her! how the sprays shivered as I spoke the name she owned!  how the nightingales ceased for a breath their warbling as she  rustled down a fragrant path and met me!  All her hair   was  swept back in one great mass and held by an ivory comb; a white  cloak wrapped her white array; she was jewelless and stripped of  lustre; she was like pearl, milky as a shell, white as the  moonlight that followed in her wake.  

"You breathed my name,—I came," she said.  

"Pardon!" I replied.  "I heard the fountains dash and the  nightingales sing, and I but came for rest under the spell."  

"And have you found it?"  

"I have found it."  

We remained silent then, while floods of passion gathered and  lay darkly still in our hearts.  No, no! I know now that it was not  so; yet I will tell it, tell it all, as I thought it then.  

She did not stir; indeed, she had such capability of rest,  that, had I not spoken, she would never have stirred, it may be.   She knew that my glance was upon her; for herself, she looked at  the broad lilies that grew at her feet, and listened to the melody  that seemed to bubble from a thousand throats with interfluent  sound upon the night.  It was her repose that soothed me: moulded  clay is not so calm, the marble rose of silence not half so  beautifully folded to dreamful rest, so lovely and so still no  garden-statue could have been; the cool, soft night infiltrated its  tranquillity through all her being.  

As we stood, the nightingales gave us capricious pause; one  alone, distant and clear, fluted its faint piping like the phantom  of the finished strain.  Another sound broke the air and floated  alone on this too delicious accompaniment: music, fine and far.   Some other lover sang to her his serenade.  The voice in its golden  sonority rose and crept toward her with persuading sweetness,  winding through all the alleys and hovering over the plots of  greenery with a tranquil strength, as if such song were but the  natural spirit of the night, or as if the soul of the broad calm  and silence itself had taken voice. 

   -           "Thy beauty, like a star  
-              Whose life is light,  
-            Shines on me from afar,  
-              And on the night.  
  -           "Each midnight blossom bends  
-              With sweetest weight,  
-            And to thy casement sends  
-              Its fragrant freight.  
  -           "Each air that faintly curls  
-              About thy nest  
-            Its daring pinion furls  
-              Within thy breast.  
  -           "The night is spread for thee,  
-              The heavens are wide,  
-            And the dark earth's mystery  
-              Is magnified.  
  -           "For thee the garden waits,  
-              The hours delay,  
-            The fountains toss their jets  
-              Of shimmering spray.  
  -           "Then leave thy dim delight  
-              In dreams above,  
-            Come forth, and crown the night  
-              With her I love!"  
  She listened, but did not lift her head or suffer the change  of a fold; then there came the tinkle of the strings that embalmed  the tune, and the singer's steps grew soundless as he left the  street.  A new phantasm crept upon me.  What right had any other  man to sing to her his love-songs?  Did she not live, was not her  beauty created, her soul given, for me?  Did not the very breath  she drew belong to me?  My voice, hoarse and husky, disturbed the  stillness, my eyes flamed on her.  

"Do you love that man who sang?" I murmured.  

"Signor, I love you," she said.  

Then we were silent as before, but she stood no longer alone  and opposite.  One passionate step, an outstretched arm, and her  head on my bosom, my lips bent to hers.  

All the nightingales burst forth in choral redundance of song,  all the low winds woke and fainted again through the balmy boughs,  all the great stars bent out of heaven to shed their sweet  influences upon us.  

It seemed to me that in that old palace-garden life began, my  memory went out in confused joy.  I held her, she was mine! mine,  mine, in life and for eter- nity!  Fool! it was I who was  hers!  Man, you are a priest, and must not love.  I, too, was sworn  a priest to my country.  So we break oaths!  

O moments of swift bliss, why are you torture to remember?   Let me not think how the night slipped into dawn as we roamed, how  pale gold filtered through the darkness and bleached the air, how  bird after bird with distant chirrup and breaking tune announced  the day.  She left me, and as well it might be night.  I wound a  strange way home.  I questioned if it were the dream of a fevered  brain; I wondered, would she remember when next she saw me?  None  met with me that day; I forgot all.  With the night I again waited  in the garden.  In vain I waited; she came no more.  I waxed full  of love's anger, I crushed the tendril and the vine, I wandered up  and down the walks and cursed these thorns that tore my heart.  As  I went, an angle of the shrubbery allured; I turned, and lo! full  radiance from open doors, and silvery sounds of sport.  I leaned  against the ilex, lost in shadow, and watched her as she stirred  and floated there before me in the light.  She seemed to carry with  her an atmosphere of warmth and brilliance; all things were ordered  as she moved; one throng melted before her, another followed.  By-and-by she stood at the long casement to seek acquaintance with the  night.  Constantly I thought to meet her eye, and I would not  reflect that she saw only dusk and vacancy.  Then indignantly I  stepped from the ilex and confronted her.  A low, glad cry escapes  her lips, she holds her arms toward me and would cross the sill,  when a voice constrains her from within.  It is he, the accursed  Neapolitan.  

"Signor," she says, "a vampire flitted past the dawn."  

Dawn indeed was breaking.  The man still stood there when she  left him, and still looked out; his eyes lay on me, and irate and  motionless I returned their gaze.  One by one her guests departed;  with a last threatening glance, he, too, withdrew.  I plunged into  the silent places again, and waited now, assured that she would  come.  The constellations paled, and still I was alone.  Then I  wandered restlessly again, and, winding through thickets of leaf-distilled perfume, I came where just above a balcony, and almost  beyond reach from it, a light burned dimly in one narrow window.   I did not ask myself why I did it, but in another moment I had  clambered to the place, and standing there, I bent forward to my  right, pulled away the tangle of ivy that filled half the niche,  and was peering in.  

"What is that?" said a voice I knew, with its silvery echo of  the South, the accursed Neapolitan's.  

"It is the owl that builds in the recess, and stirs the ivy,"  she replied.  

"Haste!" said a third,—"the day breaks."  

She was sitting at a low table, writing; Pia, the old nurse,  stood behind her chair; the oil was richly scented that she burned;  the single light illumined only her, and covered with her shadow  the low ceiling,—a shadow that seemed to hang above her like a  pall ready to fall from ghostly fingers and smother her in its  folds; the others lounged about the room and waited on her pen, in  gloom they, their faces gleaming from that dusk demoniacly.  It was  a concealed room, entered by secret ways, unknown to others than  these.  

When she had written, she sealed.  

"There is no more to await.  Adieu," she said.  

"It is some transfer of property, some legal paper, some sale,  some gift," I said to myself, as I watched them take it and depart.   Then she was alone again.  I saw her start up, pace the narrow  spot,—saw her stand and pull down the masses, so interspersed with  golden light, that crowned her head, and look at them wonderingly  as they overlay her fingers,—then saw those fingers clasped across  the eyes, and the lips part with a sigh that, prolonged and  deepened, grew to be a groan,—while all the time that shadow on  the ceiling hovered and fluttered and   grew still, till it  seemed the cluster of Eumenides waiting to pounce on its prey.  In  another pause I had taken the perilous step, had hung by the  crumbling rock, the rending vine, had entered and was beside her.   A cold horror iced her face; she warned me away with her trembling  hands.  

"What have you seen?" she said.  

"You, O my love, in grief."  

"And no more?"  

"I have seen you give a letter to the Neapolitan, who departs  to-morrow with the little Viennois,—perhaps to your friends at  home."  

"And that is all?"  

"That is all."  

"I have no friends at home.  To whom, then, could the letter  be?"  

"How should I divine?"  

"It was for the Austrian Government!  Now love me, if you  dare!"  

"And do you suppose I did not know it?"  

"Then is your love for me but a shield and mask?"  

As I gazed in reply, my steady eyes, the soul that kindled my  smile, my open arms, all must have asseverated for me the truth of  my devotion.  

"Still?" she said.  "Still?  And you can keep your faith to me  and to Italy?"  

What was this doubt of me, this stain she would have cast upon  my honor?  That armor's polish was too intense to sustain it; it  rolled off like a cloud from heaven.  Italy's fortunes were *my*  fortunes; it was impossible for me to betray them; this woman I  would win to wed them.  How long, how long my blood had felt this  thing in her! how long my brain had rebelled!  In a proud  innocence, I stood with folded arms, and could afford to smile.  

"Stay!" she said again, after our mute gaze, and laying her  hand upon my arm.  "You shall not love me in vain, you shall not  trust me for nothing.  Your cause is mine to-day.  That is the last  message I send to Vienna."  

And then I believed her.  

The light, slanting up, crept in and touched the brow of an  ideal bust of Mithras which she had invested with her faintly-faded  wreath of heliotropes; their fragrance falling through the place  already made the atmosphere more rich than that of chest of almond-wood,—this perfume that is like the soul of the earth itself  exhaled to the amorous air.  Behind an alabaster shrine she lighted  a holy-taper, slowly to waste and pale in the spreading day.  We  went to the window, where among the ivy-nooks day's life was just  astir with gaudy wings.  

"All will be seeking you, and yet you cannot go," she said.  

"Why can I not go?"  

"It is broad morning."  

"And what of that?"  

"One thing.  You shall not compromise yourself, going from the  house of an Austrian woman and worse!"  

She was too winningly imperious to fail.  I delayed, and  together we looked out on the rosy sky.  

"Come down," she said at last, "and on an arbor-moss the sun  shall drowse you, the flower-scents be your opiates, the birds your  lullaby, and I your guard."  

We went, and, wandering again through the garden-paths, she  brushed the dew with her trailing festal garments, and plucked the  great blue convolvuli to crown her forehead.  Soon, on a plot of  Roman violets, screened by tall trees and trellises, we  breakfasted.  One might have said that the cloth was laid above  giant mushroom-stems, the service acorn-cups and calices of milky  blooms; golden was the honey-comb we broke, manna was our bread;  she caught the water in her hand from the fountain and pledged me,  and swift as sunshine I bent forward and prevented the thirsty  lips.  Then she laid my head on her shoulder, with her cool finger-tips she stroked the temples and soothed the lids, they fell and  closed on the vision bending above me,—loveliness like painting,  pallor that was waxen, yellow tresses wreathed with azure stars,  eyes that caught the hue again and absorbed all Tyrian dyes.     The plash and bubble of waters swooned dreamily about my ears,  and far off it seemed I heard the wild, sad songs of her native  land, that now in tinkling tune, and now in long, slow rise and  fall of mellow sound, swathed me with sweet satiety to dreamless  rest.  

The sun stole round and rose above the screen of trees at last  and woke me.  I was alone, the silent statues looked on me, the  breath of the dark violets crushed by my weight rose in shrouding  incense.  I lifted myself and searched for her, and asked why I  must needs believe each hour of joy a dream,—then went and cooled  my brow in the lucent basin at hand, and waited till she came, in  changed raiment, and gliding toward me as the Spirit of Noon might  have come.  She led me in, well, refreshed, and in the cool north  rooms of the palace the warm hours of the day slipped like beads  from a leash.  It scarcely seemed her fingers that touched the harp  to tune, but as if some herald of sirocco, some faint, hot breeze,  had brushed between the strings.  It scarcely seemed her voice that  talked to me, but something distant as the tone in a sad sea-shell.   What I said I knew not; I was in a maze, bewildered with bliss; I  only knew I loved her, I only felt my joy.  

She told me many things: stories of her mountain-home, in  distant view of the old fortress of Hellberg,—this is the fortress  of Hellberg, Anselmo,—of her youth, her maidenhood, her life in  Vienna, her lovers in Venice, her health, that had sent her finally  there where we sat together.  

"I thought it sad," she said at length, "when they exiled me,  so to say, from Vienna and all my gay career there because Venice,  with its water-breaths, might heal my attainted health,—and sadder  when the winter bade me leave night-tides and gondolas and repair  to Rome.  Now spring has come, and all the hills are blue with  these deep violets, the very air is balm, the year is at flood, and  life at what seems its height is perfected with you."  

"But you love that land you left?" I replied, after a while,  and lifting her face to meet my gaze.  

"Love it?  Oh, yes!  You love your land as you love a person  in whose veins and yours kindred blood runs, because it is hardly  possible to do otherwise.  The land gave me life, that is all; I  never knew till lately that it was anything to be thankful for.  It  is not sufficiently a *country* to kindle enthusiasm; it has no  national life, you know,—is an automaton put through its motions  by paid and cunning mechanists.  I thought it right to obey orders  and serve it.  But now *you* are my country,—I serve only you."  

It was easy so to pass to my own hopes, to my own life, to my  land, the land to which I had vowed the last drop of blood in my  gift.  Her eyes beamed upon me, smiles rippled over her face, she  clasped me now and then and sealed my brow with kisses.  Soon I  left her side and strode from end to end of the long *salon*,  speaking eagerly of the future that opened to Italy.  I told her  how the beautiful corpse lay waiting its resurrection, and how the  Angel of Eternal Life hovered with spreading wings above, ready to  sound his general trump.  My pulses beat like trip-hammers, and as  I passed a mirror I saw myself white with the excitement that fired  me.  

"You are wild with your joyous emotion," she said, coming  forward and clinging round me.  "Your eyes flame from depths of  darkness.  What, after all, is Italy to you, that your blood should  boil in thinking of her wrongs?  These people, for whom in your  terrible magnanimity, I feel that you would sacrifice even me, to-morrow would turn and rend you!"  

"No, no!" I answered.  "All things but you!  You, you, are  before my country!"  

The tears filled her large, serious eyes, her lips quivered in  melancholy smile, as sunshine plays with shower over autumn  woodlands.  Was I not right?  Right, though the universe declare me  wrong!  I would do it all again; if she loved me, she   had  authority to be first of all in my care; in love lie the highest  duties of existence.  

I had forgotten the subject on which we spoke; I was thinking  only of her, her beauty, her tenderness, and the debt of deathless  devotion that I owed her.  It was otherwise in her thought; she had  not dropped the old thread, but, looking up, resumed.  

"It is, then, an idea that you serve?"  

Brought back from my reverie, "Could I serve a more worthy  master?" I asked.  

"You do not particularly love your countrymen, nine-tenths of  whom you have never seen?  You do not particularly hate the hostile  race, nine-tenths of whom you have never seen?"  

"Abstractly, I hate them.  Kindliness of heart prevents  individual hatred, and without kindliness of heart in the first  place there can be no pure patriotism."  

"And for the other part.  What do you care for these men who  herd in the old tombs, raise a pittance of vetch, and live the life  of brutes? what for the lazzaroni of Naples, for the brigands of  Romagna, the murderers of the Appenine?  Nay, nothing indeed.  It  is, then, for the land that you care, the mere face of the country,  because it entombs myriad ancestors, because it is familiar in its  every aspect, because it overflows with abundant beauty.  But is  the land less fair when foreign sway domineers it? do the blossoms  cease to crowd the gorge, the mists to fill it with rolling color?  is the sea less purple around you, the sky less blue above, the  hills, the fields, the forests, less lavishly lovely?"  

"Yes, the land is less fair," I said.  "It is a fair slave.   It loses beauty in the proportion of difference that exists between  any two creatures,—the one a slave of supple symmetry and perfect  passivity, the other a daring woman who stands nearer heaven by all  the height of her freedom.  And for these people of whom you speak,  first I care for them because they *are* my countrymen,—and  next, because the idea which I serve is a purpose to raise them  into free and responsible agents."  

"Each man does that for himself; no one can do it for  another."  

"But any one may remove the obstacles from another's way,  scatter the scales from the eyes of the blind, strip the dead coral  from the reef."  

She took yellow honeysuckles from a vase of massed amethyst  and began to weave them in her yellow hair,—humming a tune, the  while, that was full of the subtilest curves of sound.  Soon she  had finished, and finished the fresh thought as well.  

"Do you know, my own," she said, "the men who begin as  hierophants of an idea are apt to lose sight of the pure purpose,  and to become the dogged, bigoted, inflexible, unreasoning  adherents of a party?  All leaders of liberal movements should  beware how far they commit themselves to party-organizations.  Only  that man is free.  It is easier to be a partisan then a patriot."  

I laughed.  

"Lady, you are like all women who talk politics, however  capable they may be of acting them.  You immediately beg the  question.  We are speaking of patriotism, not of partisanship."  

"You it was who forsook the subject.  You know nothing about  it; you confess that it is with you merely a blind instinct; you  cannot tell me even what patriotism is."  

"Stay!" I replied.  "All love is instinct in the germ.  Can  you define the yearnings that the mother feels toward her child,  the tie that binds son to father?  Then you can define the  sentiment that attaches me to the land from whose breast I have  drawn life.  The love of country is more invisible, more  imponderable, more inappreciable than the electricity that fills  the air and flows with perpetual variation from pole to pole of the  earth.  It is as deep, as unsearchable, as ineffable as the power  which sways me to you.  It is the sublimation of other affection.   A portion of you has always gone out into the material spot where  you have been, a portion of that has entered you, your past life is    entwined with river and shore.  You become the country, and  the country becomes a part of God.  Those who love their country,  love the vast abstraction, can almost afford not to love God.  She  is a beneficence, she is a shield, something for which to do and  die, something for worship, ideal, grand; and though the sky is  their only roof, the earth their only bed, affluent are they who  have a land!  Passion rooted deeply as the foundations of the  hills: a man may adore one woman, but in adoring his land the  aggregation of all men's love for all other women overwhelms him  and accentuates to a fuller emotion.  It is unselfish, impersonal,  sheer sentiment clarified at its white heat from all interest and  deceit, the noblest joy, the noblest sorrow.  Bold should they be,  and pure as the priests who bore the ark, that dare to call  themselves patriots.  And those, Lenore, who live to see their  country's hopeless ruin, plunge into a sadness at heart that no  other loss can equal, no remaining blessing mitigate,—neither the  devotion of a wife nor the perfection of a child.  You have seen  exiles from a lost land?  Pride is dead in them, hope is dead,  ambition is dead, joy is dead.  Tell me, would you choose me to  suffer the personal loss of love and you, a loss I could hide in my  aching soul, or to bear those black marks of gall and melancholy  which forever overshadow them in widest grief and gloom?"  

She had sunk upon a seat, and was looking up at me with a  pained unwavering glance, as if in my words she foresaw my fate.  

"You are too intense!" she cried.  "Your tones, your eyes,  your gestures, make it an individual thing with you."  

"And so it is!" I exclaimed.  "I cannot sleep in peace, nor  walk upon the ways, while these Austrian bayonets take my sunshine,  these threatening approaching French banners hide the fair light of  heaven!"  

"Come," she said, rising.  "Speak no more.  I am tired of the  burden of the ditty, dear; and it may do you such injury yet that  already I hate it.  Come out again into our garden with me.   Dismiss these cares, these burning pains and rankling wounds.  Be  soothed by the cool evening air, taste the gorgeous quiet of  sunset, gather peace with the dew."  

So we went.  I trusted her the more that she differed from me,  that then she promised to love Italy only because *I* loved it.   I told her my secret schemes, I took her advice on points of my own  responsibility, I learned the joy of help and confidence in one  whom you deem devotedly true.  Finally we remained without speech,  stood long heart to heart while the night fell around us like a  curtain; her eyes deepened from their azure noon-splendor and took  the violet glooms of the hour, a great planet rose and painted  itself within them; again and again I printed my soul on her lips  ere I left her.  

At first, when I was sure that I was once more alone in the  streets, I could not shake from myself the sense of her presence.   I could not escape from my happiness, I was able to bring my  thought to no other consideration.  I reached home mechanically,  slept an hour, performed the routine of bath and refreshment, and  sought my former duties.  But how changed seemed all the world to  me! what air I breathed! in what light I worked!  Still I felt the  thrilling pressure of those kisses on my lips, still those dear  embraces!  

So days passed on.  I worked faithfully for the purpose to  which I was so utterly committed that let that be lost and I was  lost!  We were victorious; after the banner fell in Lombardy to  soar again in Venice and sink, the Republic struggled to life; Rome  rose once more on her seven hills, free and grand, child and mother  of an idea, the idea of national unity, of independence and liberty  from Tyrol to Sicily.  My God! think of those dear people who for  the first time said, "We have a country!"  

Yet how could we have hoped then to continue?  Such brief  success dazzled us to the past.  Piedmont had long since    struck the key-note of Italy's fortunes.  As Charles Albert forsook  Milan and suffered Austria once more to mouth the betrayed land and  drip its blood from her heavy jaws, till in a baptism of redder dye  he absolved himself from the sin,—so woe heaped on woe, all came  to crisis, ruin, and loss,—the Republic fell, Rome fell, the  French entered.  

Our names had become too famous, our heroic defence too  familiar, for us to escape unknown: the Vascello had not been the  only place where youth fought as the lioness fights for her whelps.   Many of us died.  Some fled.  Others, and I among them, remained  impenetrably concealed in the midst of our enemies.  Weeks then  dragged away, and months.  New schemes chipped their shell.  Again  the central glory of the land might rise revealed to the nations.   We never lost courage; after each downfall we rose like Antaeus  with redoubled strength from contact with the beloved soil, for  each fall plunged us farther into the masses of the people, into  closer knowledge of them and kinder depths of their affection, and  so, learning their capabilities and the warmth of their hearts and  the strength of their endurance, we became convinced that freedom  was yet to be theirs.  Meanwhile, you know, our operations were  shrouded in inscrutable secrecy; the French held Rome in frowning  terror and subjection; the Pope trembled on his chair, and clutched  it more franticly [sic] with his weak fingers: it was not even  known that we, the leaders, were now in the city; all supposed us  to be awaiting quietly the turn of events, in some other land.  As  if we ourselves were not events, and Italy did not hang on our  motions!  But, as I said, all this time we were at work; our  emissaries gave us enough to do: we knew what spoil the robbers in  the March had made, the decree issued in Vienna, the order of the  day in Paris, the last word exchanged between the Cardinals, what  whispers were sibilant in the Vatican; we mined deeper every day,  and longed for the electric stroke which should kindle the spark  and send princes and principalities shivered widely into atoms.   But, friend, this was not to be.  We knew one thing more, too: we  knew at last that we also were watched,—when men sang our songs in  the echoing streets at night, and when each of us, and I, chief of  all, renewed our ancient fame, and became the word in every one's  mouth, so that old men blessed us in the way as we passed, wrapt,  we had thought, in safe disguise, and crowds applauded.  Thus again  we changed our habits, our rendezvous, our quarters, and again we  eluded suspicion.  

There came breathing-space.  I went to her to enjoy it, as I  would have gone with some intoxicating blossom to share with her  its perfume,—with any band of wandering harpers, that together our  ears might be delighted.  I went as when, utterly weary, I had  always gone and rested awhile with her I loved in the sweet old  palace-garden: I had my ways, undreamed of by army or police or  populace.  There had I lingered, soothed at noon by the hum of the  bee, at night by that spirit that scatters the dew, by the  tranquillity and charm of the place, ever rested by her presence,  the repose of her manner, the curve of her dropping eyelid, so that  looking on her face alone gave me pleasant dreams.  

Now, as I entered, she threw down her work,—some handkerchief  for her shoulders, perhaps, or yet a banner for those unrisen men  of Rome, I said,—a white silk square on which she had wrought a  hand with a gleaming sickle, reversed by tall wheat whose barbed  grains bent full and ripe to the reaper, and round the margin,  half-pictured, wound the wild hedge-roses of Paestum.  She threw it  down and came toward me in haste, and drew me through an inner  apartment.  

"He has returned, they say," she said presently,—mentioning  the Neapolitan,—"and it would be unfortunate, if you met."  

"Unfortunate for *him*, if we met here!"    

"How fearless!  Yet he is subtler than the snake in Eden.  I  fear him as I detest him."  

"Why fear him?"  

"That I cannot tell.  Some secret sign, some unspeakable  intuition, assures me of injury through him."  

"Dearest, put it by.  The strength of all these surrounding  leagues with their swarm does not flow through his wrist, as it  does through mine.  He is more powerless than the mote in the air."  

"You are so confident!" she said.  

"How can I be anything else than confident?  The very signs in  the sky speak for us, and half the priests are ours, and the land  itself is an oath.  Look out, Lenore!  Look down on these purple  fields that so sweetly are taking nightfall; look on these rills  that braid the landscape and sing toward the sea; see yonder the  row of columns that have watched above the ruins of their temple  for centuries, to wait this hour; behold the heaven, that, lucid as  one dome of amethyst, darkens over us and blooms in star on star;—  was ever such beauty?  Ah, take this wandering wind,—was ever such  sweetness?  And since every inch of earth is historic,—since here  rose glory to fill the world with wide renown,—since here the  heroes walked, the gods came down,—since Oreads haunt the hill,  and Nereids seek the shore"—  

"Whereabout do Nereids seek the shore?" she archly asked.  

"Why, if you must have data," I answered, laughing, "let us  say Naples."  

"What is that you have to say of Naples?" demanded a voice in  the doorway,—and turning, I confronted the Neapolitan.  

She had started back at the abrupt apparition, and before she  could recover, stung by rage and surprise I had replied,—  

"What have I to say of Naples?  That its tyrant walks in blood  to his knees!"  

A man, I, with my hot furies, to be intrusted with the  commonwealth!  

"I will trouble you to repeat that sentence at some day," he  said.  

"Here and now, if you will!" I uttered, my hand on my hilt.  

"Thanks.  Not here and now.  It will answer, if you remember  it *then*.—I hope I see Her Highness well.  Pardon this little  *brusquerie*, I pray.  The southern air is kind to loveliness: I  regret to bring with me Her Highness's recall."  

She replied in the same courteous air, inquired concerning her  acquaintance, and ordered lights,—took the letter he brought, and  held it, still sealed, in the taper's flame till it fell in ashes.  

"Signor," she said, lifting the white atoms of dust and  sifting them through her fingers, "you may carry back these as my  reply."  

"Nay, I do not return," he answered.  "And, Signorina, many  things are pardoned to one in—your condition.  Recover your  senses, and you will find this so among others."  

Then, as coolly as if nothing had happened, he spoke of the  affairs of the day, the tendency of measures, the feeling of the  people, and finally rose, kissed her hand, and departed.  He was  joined without by the little Viennois, and the accursed couple  sauntered down the street together.  I should have gone then,—the  place was no longer safe for me,—but something, the old spell, yet  detained me.  

Lenore did not speak, but threw open all the windows and doors  that were closed.  

"Let us be purified of his presence, at least!" she cried,  when this was done.  

"And you have ceased to fear this man whom you have dared so  offend?" I asked.  

"He is not offended," said Lenore.  "Austria is not Naples.   He will not transmit my reply till he is utterly past hope."  

"Hope of what?"  

"Of my hand."  

"Lenore!  Then put him beyond hope now!  Become my wife!"  

"Ah,—if it were less unwise"—  

"If you loved me, Lenore, you would not think of that."     

"And you doubt it?  Why should I, then, say again that I love  you,—I love you?"  

Ah, friend, how can I repeat those words?  Never have I given  her endearments again to the air: sacred were they then, sacred  now, however false.  Ah, passionate words! oh, sweet *issimos*!  tender intonations! how deeply, how deeply ye lie in my soul!  Let  me repeat but one sentence: it was the key to my destiny.  

"Yes, yes," she said, rising from my arms, "already I do you  injury.  You think oftener of me than of Italy."  

It was true.  I sprang to my feet and began pacing the floor,  as I sought to recall any instance in which I had done less than I  might for my country.  The cool evening-breeze, and the bell-notes  sinking through the air from distant old campaniles, soothed my  tumult, and, turning, I said,—  

"My devotion to you sanctifies my devotion to her.  And not  only for her own sake do I work, but that you, you, Lenore, may  have a land where no one is your master, and where your soul may  develop and become perfect."  

"And those who have not such object, why do they work?"  

Then first I felt that I had fallen from the heights where my  companions stood.  This ardent patriotism of mine was sullied, a  stain of selfishness rose and blotted out my glory, others should  wear the conquering crowns of this grand civic game.  Oh, friend!  that was sad enough, but it was inevitable.  Here is where the  crime came in,—that, knowing this, I still continued as their  leader, suffered them to call me Master and Saviour, and walked  upon the palms they spread.  

Lenore mistook my silence.  

"You cannot tell me why they work?" she said.  "From habit,  from fear, because committed?  It cannot be, then, that they are in  earnest, that they are sincere, that they care a rush for this  cause so holy to you.  They have entered into it, as all this  common people do, for the love of a new excitement, for the  pleasurable mystery of conspiracy, for the self-importance and  gratulation.  They will scatter at the signal of danger, like  mischievous boys when a gendarme comes round the corner.  They will  betray you at the lifting of an Austrian finger.  Leave them!"  

This was too much to hear in silence,—to hear of these  faithful comrades, who had endured everything, and were yet to  overcome because they possessed their souls in patience, each of  whom stood higher before God than I in unspotted public purity, and  whose praise and love led me constantly to larger effort.  At least  I would make them the reparation of vindication.  

"You mistrust them?" I exclaimed.  "They whose souls have been  tried in the furnace, who have the temper of fine steel, pliant as  gold, but incorruptible as adamant,—heroes and saints, they stand  so low in your favor?  Come, then, come with me now,—for the bells  have struck the hour, and shadows clothe the earth,—come to their  conclave where discovery is death, and judge if they be idle  prattlers, or men who carry their lives in their hands!"  

Fool!  Fool!  Fool!  Every sound in the air cries out that  word to me: the bee that wings across the tower hums it in my ear;  the booming alarm-bell rings it forth; my heart, my failing heart,  beats it while I speak.  I would have carried a snake to the sacred  ibis-nest, and thenceforth hope was hollow as an egg-shell!  

She ran from the room, but, pausing in the door-way,  exclaimed,—  

"Remember, if you take me there, that I am no Roman patriot,—  I!  I, who am of the House of Austria, that House that wears the  crown of the Caesars, those Caesars who swayed the very imperial  sceptre, who trailed the very imperial purple of old Rome!  I  endure the cause because it is yours.  I beseech you to be faithful  to it; because I should despise you, if for any woman you swerved  from an object that had previously been with you holier than  heaven!"  

I stood there leaning from the lofty   window and  looking down over the wide, solitary fields.  Recollections crowded  upon me, hopes rose before me.  One day, that yet lives in my  heart, Anselmo, sprang up afresh, a day forever domed in memory.   Fair rose the sun that day, and I walked on the nation's errands  through the streets of a distant town,—a hoar and antique place,  that sheltered me safely, so slight guard was it thought to need by  our oppressors.  It pleased that reverend arch-hypocrite to take at  this hour his airing.  Late events had given the people courage.   It was a market-day, peasants from the country obstructed the  ancient streets, the citizens were all abroad.  Not few were the  maledictions muttered over a column of French infantry that wound  along as it returned to Rome from some movement of subjection, not  low the curses showered on an officer who escorted ladies upon  their drive.  As I went, I considered what a day it would have been  for *emeute*, and what mortal injury *emeute* would have done  our cause.  Italy, we said, like fools, but honest fools, must not  be redeemed with blood.  As if there were ever any sacred pact, any  new order of things, that was not first sealed by blood!   Therefore, when I, alone perhaps of all the throng, saw one man—a  man in whose soul I knew the iron rankled—stealing behind the  crowd, behind the monuments, and, as the coach of His Excellency  rolled luxuriously along, levelling a glittering barrel,—it was  but an instant's work to seize the advancing creatures, to hold  them rearing,—and then a deadly flash,—while the ball whistled  past me, grazed my hand, and pierced the leader's heart.  In a  twinkling the dead horse was cut away, and His Excellency, cowering  in the bottom of the coach, galloped home more swiftly than the  wind, without a word.  But the populace appreciated the action,  took it up with *vivas* long and loud, that rang after me when I  had slipped away, and before nightfall had echoed in all ears  through leagues of country round.  I went that night to the  theatre.  The house was filled, and, as we entered, a murmur went  about, and then cries broke forth,—the multitude rose with cheers  and bravos, calling my name, intoxicated with enthusiasm, and  dazzled, not by a daring feat, but by the spirit that prompted it.   Women tore off their jewels to twist them into a sling for my  injured hand; men rose and made me a conqueror's ovation; the  orchestra played the old Etrurian hymns of freedom; I was attended  home with a more than Roman triumph of torch and song, stately men  and beautiful women.  But chameleons change their tint in the  sunshine, and why should men always march under one color?  Friend,  not six months later there came another day, when triumph was  shame,—plaudits, curses,—joyous tumult, scorching silence.  Oh!—  —  But I shall come to that in time.  Now let me hasten; the  hours are less tardy than I, and they bring with them my last.  

Thought of this day—sole pageant defiling through memory—was  startled again by the far, sweet sound of a bell, some bell ringing  twilight out and evening in across the wide Campagna.  I wondered  what delayed Lenore.  Did it take so long to toss off the cloudy  back-falling veil, to wrap in any long cloak her gown of white  damask and all the sheen of her milky pearl-clusters and fiery  rubies?  I thought with exultation then of what she was so soon to  see,—of the route through sunken ruins, down wells forsaken of  their pristine sources and hidden by masses of moss, winding with  the faint light in our hands through the awful ways and avenues of  the catacombs.  The scene grew real to me, as I mused.  Alone, what  should I fear?  These silent hosts encamped around would but have  cheered their child.  But with her, every murmur becomes a portent  of danger, every current of air gives me fresh tremors; as we pass  casual openings into the sky, the vault of air, the glint of stars,  shall seem a malignant face; I fancy to hear impossible footsteps  behind us, some bone that crumbling falls from its shelf makes my  heart beat high, her dear hand trembles in my hold, and, full of a  new and superstitious   awe, I half fear this ancient  population of the graves will rise and surround us with phantom  array.  Now and then, a cold, lonely wind, blowing from no one  knows where, rises and careers past us, piercing to the marrow.  I  think, too, of that underground space, half choked with rubbish,  into which we are to emerge at last, once the hall of some old  Roman revel.  I see the troubled flashes flung from the flaring  torch over our assembly.  Alert and startled, I see Lenore listen  to the names as if they summoned the wraiths and not the bodies of  men whom she had supposed to be lost in the pampas of Paraguay,  dead in the Papal prisons, sheltered in English homes, or tossing  far away on the long voyages of the Pacific seas.  I see myself at  length taking the torch from its niche and restoring it, as a  hundred times before, to Pietro da Valambo, while it glitters on  some strange object looking in at the vine-clad opening above with  its breaths of air, serpent or hare, or the large face and slow  eyes of a browsing buffalo.  And as I think, lo! an echo in the  house, a dull tramp in the hall, a stealthy tread in the room, a  heavy hand upon my shoulder,—I was arrested for high treason.  

Do not think I surrendered then.  Without a struggle I would  be the prize of Pope nor King nor Kaiser!  I shook the minions'  grasp from my shoulder, I flashed my sword in their eyes; and not  till the crescent of weapons encircled me in one blinding gleam,  vain grew defence, vain honor, vain bravery.  Of what use was my  soul to me thenceforth?  I became but carrion prey.  I fell, and  the world fell from me.  

Sensation, emotion, awoke from their swooning lapse only in  the light of day, the next or another, I knew not which.  I was  lifted from some conveyance, I saw blue reaches of curving bay and  the great purifying priest of flame, and knew I was in the city  guarded by its pillar of cloud by day, of fire by night.  I had  reason to know it, when, yet unfed, unrested, faint, smirched and  smeared with blood and travel, loaded with chains, I was brought to  a tribunal where sat the sleek and subtle tyrant of Naples.  

"Signor," said a bland voice from the king's side,—and  looking in its direction, I encountered the Neapolitan,—"Signor,  I lately said that at some day I would trouble you to repeat a  brilliant sentence addressed to me.  The day has arrived.  I  scarcely dared dream it would be so soon.  Shall we listen?"  

I was silent: not that I feared to say it; they could but  finish their play.  

Then I saw the beautifully cut lips of my judge part, that the  voice might slide forth, and, taking a comfit, he uttered, with  unchanging tint and sweetest tone, the three words, "Apply the  question."  

Why should I endure that for a whim?  Who courts torment?   Already they drew near with the cunning instruments.  Let me say  it, and what then?  Nothing worse than torture.  Let me *not* say  it, and certainly torture.  Oh, I was weaker than a child! my body  ruled my spirit with its exhaustion and pain.  Yet there was a  certain satisfaction in flinging the words in their faces.  I waved  back with my remaining arm the slaves who approached.  

"You should allow a weary man the time to collect his  thoughts," I said, and then turned to my persecutors.  "I have  spoken with you many times, Signor," I replied to the Neapolitan,  "yet of all our words I can remember none but these, that you could  care to hear with this auditory.  I said,—that the tyrant of  Naples walks in blood to his knees!"  

The Neapolitan smiled.  The king rose.  

"Well said!" he murmured, in his silvery tones.  "One that  knows so much must know more.  Exhaust his knowledge, I pray.  Do  not spare your courtesies; remember he is my guest.  I leave him in  your hands."  

He fixed me with his eye,—that darkly-glazed eye, devoid of  life, of love, of joy, as if he were the thing of another element,--then bowed and passed away.  

"The urbanity of His Majesty is too well known to suppose it  possible that he   should prove you a liar," said the  Neapolitan.  

Truly, I was left in their hands!  Shall I tell you of the  charities I found there?  Not I, friend! it would wring your heart  as dry of tears as mine was wrung of groans.  At last I was alone,  it seemed,—on a wet stone floor, sweat pouring from every muscle,  each fibre quivering; I was distorted and unjointed, I only hoped  I was dying.  But no, that was too good for me.  Anselmo, how can  I but be full of scoffs, when I remember those hours, those ages?   The cold dampness of the place crept into my bones; I became  swollen and teeming with intimate pain.  But that was light, my  body might have ached till the throbs stiffened into death-spasms,  and yet the suffering had been nought, compared with that loathing  and disgust in my soul.  It had seemed that I was alone, I said.   Alone as the corpse in unshrouded grave!  I was in a charnel-house.   Men who were sinless as you hung dead upon the wall, hung dying  there.  Darkness covered all things at a distance, sighs crept up  from far corners, chains clanked, or imprecations or prayers  uttered themselves,—bodiless voices in the night.  I did not know  what untold horror there might yet be hid.  I heard the drip of  water from the black vaults; I heart the short, fierce pants and  deadly groans.  Oh, worst infliction of Hell's armory it is to see  another suffer!  Why was it allowed, Anselmo?  Did it come in the  long train of a broken law? was it one of the dark places of  Providence? or was it indeed the vile compost to mature some  beautiful germ?  Ah, then, is it possible that Heaven looks on us  so in the mass?  

But for me, after a while I lay torpid, and then perchance I  slept, for finally I opened my eyes and found the white strong  light; I lay on a bed, and a surgeon handled me.  Too elastic was  I to be long crushed, once the weight removed.  Soon I breathed  fresh air; and save that my frame had become in its distortion  hideous, I was the same as before.  

Then, indeed, began my torture,—torture to which this had  been idle jest.  I was taken once more to the room of tribunal.   Beside the Neapolitan a woman sat veiled and shrouded in masses of  sable drapery.  "A queen?" I thought, "or a slave?"  But I had no  further room for fancy; the same interrogatories as before were  given me to answer, and then I felt why I had been nursed back to  life.  In the months that had elapsed, I could not know if Italy  were saved or lost, if Naples tottered or remained impregnable.  I  stood only on my personal basis of right or wrong.  I refused to  open my lips.  They wheeled forward a low bed that I knew well.   Oh, the slow starting of the socket!  Oh, the long wrench of tendon  and nerve!  A bed of steel and cords, rollers and levers, bound me  there, and bent to their creaking toil.  I was strong to endure; I  had set my teeth and sworn myself to silence; no woman should hear  me moan.  Even in this misery I saw that she who sat there,  shaking, fell.  

The tyrant was lily-livered; seldom he witnessed what others  died under; he intended nothing further then;—many men who faint  at sight of blood can probe a soul to its utmost gasp.  Now he  motioned, and they paused.  Then others lifted the woman and held  her beside him, yet a little in advance.  

"Keep your silence," said he, in a voice unrecognizable, and  as if a wild beast, half-glutted, should speak, "and I keep her!   She is in my power.  Mine, and you know what that means.  Mine,"  and he bent toward me, *" body—and—soul*.  To use, to blast, to  destroy, to tear piecemeal,—as I will do, so help me God! unless  you meet my condition."  And extending his hand, he drew aside the  black veil, and my eye lay on the face of Lenore, thin and white as  the familiar faces of corpses, and utterly insensible in swoon.  

Ah, that mortal horror stops my pulse!  Was I wrong?  Why not  have borne that, too?  Had she loved me, she had chosen it, chosen  it rather.  And death would have made all right!—God! why    not have seized some poignard lying there? why not have sprung upon  her, have slain her?  Then silence had been simply secure.  Then I  could have smiled in their frustrated faces, one keen, deep smile,  and died.  I was dissolved in pain, writhed with prolonged strokes  that thrilled me from head to foot, pierced as with acute stabs, my  heart seemed to forge thunderbolts to break upon my brain,—but  this agony had been spared me.  They unbound me, fed me with some  stimulating cordial, gave me cold air, and I rose on my elbow a  little.  

"Swear!" I said, hoarsely.  "But you do not keep oaths.  God  help you?  Never!  There must be a Hell to help you!  Imprecate  this, then, on yourself.  May you in your smooth white body know  the torture I have known, be racked till each bone in your skin  changes place, hang festering in chains from the wall of a living  grave, make fellowship with putridity, and lie in the pitiless dark  to see all the dead who died under your hand rise, rise and accuse  you before God!  And may your little son know the deeds you have  done, live the life those deeds merit, and die the death that *I*  shall die,—if you do not keep your word!"  

"What word?" he said.  

"Promise, if I reveal all, and my revelations shall be true  and thorough therefore,—promise that you will leave her in safe  security and freedom to-day, untouched, unscathed, unharmed, and  that so ever shall she remain.  And false to this oath, may no  priest shrive you, no land own you, God blight you and curse you  and wither you from the face of the earth!"  

And taking a crucifix, he swore the oath.  

Then they busied themselves about Lenore, revived her, soothed  her, gave her of the same cordial to drink, and placed her once  more in her dais-seat.  Her veil was thrown back, her wide blue  eyes fixed on me in intense strain, her face and lips still  blanched more bitterly beneath that hue, her features sharp as  chisel-graven death.  Ah, God! must I endure that too?  Was she to  hear me,—she, not knowing why, never knowing why,—she in whom  that look of aching passion and pity was to die out and freeze and  fade in one of utter scorn?  

They brought me some strange draught, as if one swallowed  fire.  The blood coursed richly through my shrunken veins; I felt  filled with a different life.  I arose and left that bed of  torture, but came back to it as to my rest.  

And lying there, I betrayed Italy.  

Root and branch and spray and leaf, I uprooted all my  memories; I forgot no name, I lost no fact; I was eagerer than  they; I modified nothing, I abbreviated nothing; the past, the  future, what had been, was to be, plan and scheme and supreme  purpose, I never faltered, I told the whole!  

I did not look at her, I kept my eyes on the tyrant; I wished  I might have the evil eye,—but that gift was for him, the  Neapolitan.  Yet at length I heard a low moan trailing toward me;  I turned and saw her face, as I saw it last, Anselmo,—stonily  quiet, frozen from indignant pain to icy apathy, and the words she  would have said had hissed inarticulately through her ashen lips.   Then they brought me the confession, and, as I could, I signed it.  

"Madame," said the tyrant, "your knowledge is coextensive with  his.  Does all this agree?"  

"Sire, it does agree," she answered, and they led her out.  

"I have no authority over you," said the tyrant then to me.   "You might go freely now, but that, precious as Homer, seven cities  claim you, Signor!  My prisons also will now be full of rarer game.   But as a crime of your commission places you within Austrian  jurisdiction, I shall take pleasure in presenting you to my cousin  and surrendering you to his mercy," and he withdrew.  

"You may not be aware," said the courteous Neapolitan, "that  on the night of your arrest your frantic sword-slashes had serious  result.  My friend the little Viennois fell at your hands."    

"God be praised," I answered, "that I do not die without one  good work!"  

"Well said!  And worthy of a traitor both to his ancient blood  and to his cause,—the betrayer of comrade and friend!"  

I do not know what look was in my eye, or whether, with the  savage ferocity taught me but now, I was about to leap and throttle  him, and suck the life-blood from his veins.  But suddenly he  laughed, a feigned merriment, twirled his moustache, opened a door,  looked back, uttering this one sentence:—  

"You have simply corroborated her statement: you are not even  the first in at the death: Lenore told all this more swiftly, with  a better grace, and a something less sardonic mute-comment,"—  closed the door and was gone.  The breath of the bottomless pit had  blown in my face.  

They gave themselves time to swoop down and pounce on every  man whose name I had given, and others; they prevented future  trouble, they made terrible examples, they sated themselves with  vengeance.  But their feet were shod with velvet,—history will  never record it; to the world I and those nameless ones pass as  mere idle agitators, bubbles that blew out to sea,—but at my  mention kings in their closet remember how their thrones trembled!   Then they looked about them for one last morsel, and I was led to  Rome.  

O stormy days that I have to remember!  O wild mornings of the  cannonade, and of the sally!  One noon blots ye all out in sullen  darkness!  

It was a gala-day, the day when I passed through; all the  populace were out, my signed confession placarded the corners,  Pasquin harvested my sins, Church and State made holiday.  Cries of  derision awaited me, ribald laughter, taunting jests, hisses and  groans, gleaming stilettos, shining barrels, eyes of rage.  But  when I reached them, all was silence; silence closed up the ranks  behind me.  The shouting crowds grew noiseless, breathless.  They  each received the terrible impress of him who passed,—his brow was  branded as by doom; he went out Cain, and carried with him the  curse of a ruined people.  I gazed right and left,—on these men  who had once hailed me, followed me, worshipped me; their hate  melted as they met my eye; slowly a cloud of terror and pity  gathered and hung above the city.  I did not repent; I would have  done it again: not for a universe of Italies would I have resigned  *her* to that fate.  But, O friend, this forgiveness of theirs  was unmerciful!  For hate they had cause; for this none: they knew  nothing of my reason, they only knew that I had betrayed them.   Each man had despised me; he thought that to save my limbs like a  young god's, to keep my face that had been splendid in youth's  beauty, to spare that shape of antique symmetry and grace, to win  ease and rest and wealth and happiness, perhaps, I had done this.   Each man, as I met his gaze, shrunken, dismembered, deformed,  dishonored, held his breath, shook with indefinable fear, felt the  neighborhood of agony and despair, and forgave, forgave:—oh! to  live to be forgiven!  But the women,—the women, Anselmo, were not  so cruel.  There were torrents of streamers, but all were black,  pouring from window and roof,—there were sunny heads, and dark,  fair faces, rosy cheeks, snowy shoulders, clustered in door and  arch like bunches of poison-flowers,—and of all shrill sounds of  hate, Anselmo, that can pierce and part red lips, the fiercest,  shrillest, fell on me; and at last, from one lofty balcony, where  erst I had seen her leaning forth in sunset to catch the evening  winds, the evening bells, crowned, too, by the evening star, one  woman, now centred in merciless mid-noon, leaned, leaned and gazed  down as into her grave: it was Lenore.  It had been late spring  when last I passed that way; all the hot, pestilential summer I had  lain in the dungeons of Naples; now it was autumn, and the town was  full.  Full, but I saw no one; blank became the spaces on which I  gazed; my gyves vanished, my guards; my brain swam   through  dazzling rings of light, and I fell forward in the cart and hung by  my chains among the hoofs of the trampling horses who dragged me.   On that day I had taken my last step; I never set foot on the round  earth again.  But, with all, I smiled through my groans; for the  shining, solid hoofs that did their work on me did their work as  well on the man who walked by my side,—dashed dead the accursed  Neapolitan.  

They were not the surgeons of Naples who essayed to galvanize  volition through my paralyzed limbs, but those who knew the utmost  resources of their art.  And so I lived,—lived, too, by reason of  my inextinguishable vitality, by reason of this spark that will not  quench,—and so I came to Hellberg.  It would have been mockery to  give this shapeless hulk to sentence, and then to headsman or  hangman; perhaps, too, her haughty name had been involved; and so  I was never brought to trial, and so I am at Hellberg.  

And I have never set foot on the ground again.  But, oh, to  touch it for a moment, to sit anywhere on the summer mould, to pull  down the sun-quivering, sun-steeped branches about me, to scent the  fresh grass as it springs to the light!  Oh, but to touch the  sweet, kind earth, the warm earth, silent with ineffable tenderness  and soothing, to feel it under my hand, to lay my cheek there for  a moment, while it drew away pain and weariness with its absorbing,  purifying power!  Oh, but to lie once more where the blossoms grow!   Soon, soon, they will grow above me!  Soon the kind mother will  cover me!    

What had happened in the outer world I knew not till you came.   I fancied Lenore returned, breathing Austrian air, and living under  the same horizon that girds me in.  Sometimes I have seen a distant  cavalcade skimming over the vale, as once we careered over the  Campagna, when she handled her steed as another woman handles her  needle, and the sweet wind fanned peach-tints to her cheeks and  drew out unravelled braids of gold in lingering caress.  She could  have come to me, had she pleased, then: this old chief who rules  the place was her father's friend and hers.—But look! but see!   Who is it comes now,—sweeps round the donjon flank?  Lean over the  embrasure, and learn!  Ah, man, are my eyes so old, my memories so  treacherous, that I do not know day from night?  They have gone  on,—or did they enter, think you?  Or yet, there is to be  carousal, perhaps, in the halls beyond and below, and she comes to  join the gay feast; she will drink healths in red wine, will listen  to flattering dalliance with pleased eyes, will utter light laughs  through the lips that once glowed to my kisses, and will forget  that the same roof which shelters the revellers shelters also her  lover dying in moans?  Careless—  Best so! best so!  What  cavalier whispered in her ear as she passed?  Have years tarnished  her beauty?  Ah, God! this wind, that maddens me now, a moment  since touched her!  

Anselmo, I will go in.  This vault of heaven with its spotless  blue, this wide land that laughs in festive summer, these winds  that lift my hair and come heavy with odors,—these do not fit with  me, I burlesque the fair face of creation.  O invisible airs, that  softly sport round the castle-towers, why do you not woo my soul  forth and bear it and lose it in the flawless cope of sky?  

Nay, why, any more than Ajax, should I die in the dark?  Never  again will I enter the cell, never again!  The wide universe shall  receive my breath.  Lower the back of my chair, pull away the  cushions, wrap my cloak round me, Anselmo.  There!  I will lie, and  wait, and look up.  Give me ghostly counsel, my friend, console me.   You are not too weary with this long tale?  Tell me I needed all  the tears I have shed to quench the fiery defiance, the  independence of heaven and tumult of earth in my being.  If you  could tell me that she had not been false, that she never feigned  her passion   to decoy, that, Austrian though she were—   Ah, but I had evidence!  I had evidence! his words, that ate out my  life like gangrene and rust.—Speak slower, Anselmo, slower.  Can  it be that I sinned most, when I held his words before hers,—his  black damning falsehoods?—  Mother of God! do you know what you  say?  

Tell me, then, that I am a fool,—that not through other loss  than the loss of faith did the curse fall on me!  Tell me, then,  that these dark ways lead me out on a height!  Needful the shadow  and the groping.  He anointed my eyes with the clay beneath his  feet,—I was blind, but now I see God!  

Repeat, Anselmo, repeat that she was true, though the  knowledge blast me with self-consuming pangs.  But, true or false,  one thing she promised me: though other spheres, though other lives  had come between us, she would be with me in my dying hour.  Soon  the bell will toll that hour, and toll my knell!    

What is this, Anselmo,—this face that hangs between me and  heaven,—this pitying, sorrowing countenance?—Ave Maria!—Never!   Never!  Still of the earth, this melting mouth, these violet eyes,  this brow of snow, this fragrant bosom pillowing my head!  Mirage  of fainting fancy,—out, beautiful thing, away!  Do not torment me  with such a despairing lie! do not cheat me into death! let me at  least look on the unobstructed sky, as I sink lower and lower to my  eternal rest!    

Still there?  Still there?  Still bending above me, smiling  and weeping, sweet April face?  Oh, were they truly thy lips that  lay on mine, then, that stamped them with life's impress, that woke  me?  Are they truly thy fingers that pressed my throbless temples?   These arms that are wound about me, are thine?  Thy heart beats for  me, thy tears flow, thy perfect womanhood does not recoil in  horror?  Lenore!  Lenore! is it thou?    

Nay, nay, Sweet, ask me no question; I have wronged thee; he  shall tell thee how.  Yet best thou shouldst never hear it.  Sin to  thee greater than all treachery had been.  Forgive, forgive!  I  go,—in meeting, leave thee; but be glad for me,—whether I sleep  or whether I wake, know that a great curse will have fallen from  me.  Swathe my memory in thy love.  Kiss me again, child!  Rock me  a little; stoop lower, and croon those old mountain-songs that once  you sang when the sunshine soaked the sward and your hair was  crowned with blue morning-glories.  

Ah, your song drowns in tears!  Yet you do not wish me to  live, Lenore?  O love, I can do nothing but die!  

The sunlight fades from the hills, the air wavers and  glimmers, and day is dim.  Thy face is mistier than a vision of  angels.  There are faint, strange voices in my ear, swift  rustlings, far harmonies;—has sense become so attenuated that I  hear the blood in my failing pulses?  Lenore, love, lower.  Thy  lips to mine, and breathe my life away.  Twice would I die to save  thee!  

—Anselmo! man! where art thou?  Come back ere I fall,—  strength flares up like a dying flame.  * Never tell her why I  betrayed Italy!*  

—Closer, dear love, closer!  What old murmurs do I hear?    

-      "The night is spread for thee,  
-          The heavens are wide,  
-       And the dark earth's mystery"—    
So,—in thy arms,—from thee to God!  O love, forever—kiss—  forgive!—Life me, that I confront eternity and Christ!
