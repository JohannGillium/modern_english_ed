  UPON the hearing before the Court, it appeared, that Zacheus  Mayhew, of  Massachusetts, by Deed of Gift, dated the first Day of *March*,  1750, did give  a certain Negro Girl called Flora, unto his Daughter, Lucy Little, then the Wife of  Little—That the said Lucy Little afterwards being a Widow, and having One  Son called William Little, intermarried in Massachusetts with a Dr. Joseph Eaton,  who came from thence with his Wife to Shrewsberry in *New-Jersey*, and at  the same Time brought the said Negro Flora with them—That on the 31st Day  of *August*, 1752, the said Dr. Eaton sold the said Negro Flora with  a Child she  then had called          Rose, unto one John Worthley—That the said John Worthley by Bill of Sale,  dated 27th *September*, 1753, sold the said Negro Flora to one John  Williams—That John Williams the 8th of *May*, 1754, sold  the said  Negro Flora to the aforesaid Dr. Eaton for the Sum of Sixty-Pounds  York-Money—That the said Dr. Eaton upwards of Twenty Years ago, and  about Five Days after one Jacob Dennis had purchased the aforesaid Negro Girl Rose,  Daughter of the said Flora, of the said John Worthley, he the said Dr. Eaton informed  the said Jacob Dennis, he was collecting those Negroes for William Little (his  Son-in-Law)—that they should return to him again as they belonged to him ;  and at that Time and often afterwards declared that he was principled against Slavery,  and that he never intended the said Flora should belong to his Estate, nor should any  of his Children be benefited by having her as their Property—It also appeared  that the said Lucy Eaton survived her said Husband, the said Dr. Eaton—That  shortly after the Death of the said Dr. Eaton (*to wit*, about  Seventeen Years  ago) one Thomas White applied to the said Lucy Eaton to purchase and did purchase  at private Sale, a small Spinning Wheel, which she then said she had not any further  Use for, as she had given Flora free who used to spin on the said Wheel—That  since that Time the said Flora has passed for, and been esteemed a free Woman, and  for a considerable Time worked about in the Neighborhood of the said Widow Eaton,  and in the House of the said Widow, and for the Wife of John Eaton the eldest Son of  the said Dr. Eaton, and always received her Wages as well from the said John Eaton's  Wife, as the Neighbours ; and the said Widow Eaton herself promised to compensate  her therefor—And it further appeared that whilst the said Flora worked about  for herself as aforesaid, she intermarried with a certain Joseph Reap, a free Negro,  with whom the said Flora has ever since lived unmolested and as a free Woman, and  still continues so to live—That after the marriage of the said Flora with the said  Joseph Reap, she had Two Children called Lydia, and *Margaret*  (the present  Claimant), that these Children lived with their said Father and Mother, who brought  them up by their own Industry without any Expence or Trouble to any other Person  whatsoever, until            last Fall, when they were taken away from their said Parents without their  Consent—That since the said taking, it appears by a certain Instrument of  Writing, bearing date the 8th Day of *January*, 1789, executed under  the Hand  and Seal of the aforesaid William Little, (the Son-in-Law of the said Dr. Eaton, and  for whom the said Dr. Eaton declared as aforesaid, he was collecting the  Negroes)—That the said William Little hath manumitted and set at Liberty the  said Flora and her said Two Children, Lydia and Margaret ; whereupon  The Court having considered this state of Facts, and the arguments of Counsel on both  Sides thereupon, *are of Opinion*, That, permitting the said Negro  Woman  Flora to remain at Liberty for so long a Time, and to work for herself, and having  intermarried with the said Joseph Reap a free Man, with whom she has ever since  lived as a free Woman, is such Evidence of Freedom, both of the said Negro Woman  Flora, and consequently of her Children, as to entitle the said Negro Margaret Reap  to her Discharge ; and the Court do therefore accordingly *order*  the said Negro Margaret Reap to be discharged and set at Liberty from the said David  Lyon ; on  Motion of the Attorney General.  

  *Bloomfield, Attorney General, and R. Stockton for the  State*.—

#   *April* Term, 1790.  
  (p. 42.)  
  The STATE *against* LEWIS PRALL *and*  ROBERT ROSS *Administrators of* ISAAC PRALL,   *deceased*.  

  *On* Habeas Corpus *of Negro* Thomas  *claiming his Freedom*.  [Habeas Corpus returned and filed.]  

  RETURN,    “WE have the Negro in the above Writ named, at the Day  and Place as by the said Writ we are commanded, *and we do  certify*, that we as Administrators of all and singular the Goods and Chattels,  Rights and Credits which were of Isaac Prall, deceased, took Possession of said Negro as  part of the personal Property of the said Isaac Prall, and that there is no other Cause of  detaining him.  LEWIS PRALL, ROBERT ROSS, JUN.  Administrators.”  

  Upon the hearing in this Cause, it appeared to the Court that the said Negro Thomas  belonged to the said Isaac Prall, deceased—That the Intestate, about Three  Years before his Death, and frequently afterwards, declared that Tom should never  have another Master—That he had been a faithful Servant to him—That  they had been born under one Roof, that they had received Sustenance from one  Breast, and had broke up the Ground, and always lived together ; and continued to  shew great Affection and Regard for the Negro until his last Sickness, and during that  Sickness whilst he had his Senses—That in his last Illness, on the Friday before  he died, he requested a Person might be sent for to make his Will, at which Time his  Sister being present, she asked him what he intended to do with his Negroes, he  replied they should all be sold but Tom, and he should be free ; which Declaration he  also made the same Day to several others, with this, further, that Tom should not serve  any other Master—The Person sent for to write his Will, did not come 'till the  next Day, when          the Intestate was so deranged in his Mind as to be incapable of making his Will, and  continued so until he died, which was on the Wednesday following ; that the said  Intestate, after he was in some measure deranged, continued to shew strong and  evident Marks of Affection for the said Negro, and of the Continuance of his Design  and Intention to make him free : It also appeared to the Court that the said Negro had  always before the Death of the Intestate, and till that Event took place, been much  attached to his Master, had shewn a great Affection for him, and had behaved himself  well and faithfully.  

  The Court having considered of the whole Case, and the Arguments of Counsel for  and against the Manumission of the Negro, *are unanimously of  Opinion*, That  the frequent and full Declarations of the Intestate, amounted to more than a bare  Intention of doing something in future ; that even if these Declarations were taken in  the Sense of a Promise to do something in future, the good Behaviour of the Negro  which was admitted on all Hands, the evident Continuation of the Affection of the  Master as long as he had his Senses, and even when in some Measure deprived of  them, afforded a strong Ground of Presumption of a Contract between the Negro and  Master for his Freedom, conditionally on his behaving well, which having performed  on his Part, the Negro was entitled to his Liberty, and that the Performance of the  Condition on the Part of the Master and his Representatives, might be effected on this  Habeas Corpus, *do therefore adjudge*, That the said Negro Tom  being entitled  to his Freedom, be discharged from the Custody of the said Administrators, and all  the Representatives of the said Isaac Prall, deceased.

  THE Court having considered this Case under all its  Circumstances, and it appearing that John Coward the former Master,   under whom Tobias Hendrickson  claims Title to the Negro, antecedent to the Year 1785, actually entered into an  Agreement with Jack for his Freedom, the Terms of which have been fully complied  with ; *The Court are therefore of Opinion*, and   *do order*, the said  Negro Jack to be liberated from the Custody of the said Tobias  Hendrickson—But as John Coward the former Master is not before the Court,  and of Course not heard, and his Interest may be materially concerned, this Judgment  for the Liberation of the said Jack is not to affect any present or future Claim of the  said John Coward.

  *On* Habeas Corpus *of Negro* Jethro *(Son of Charity Briggs) claiming his Freedom*.  

  IT appearing to the Court that the said Negro Jethro was born on  the eighth  Day of *September*, 1768, in the County of Cape-May in this State ;  that his  Mother Charity Briggs a (Mulatto Woman) was free at the Time of his  Birth—That the said Charity was by Indenture bound by the Justices and  Overseers of the Poor of the Lower Precinct of Cape-May to one Nathaniel Foster, in  order to bear the Expences of her having had the Small-Pox—That in the said  Year of 1768, the said Charity was purchased by a certain John Connel, she           then having the said Jethro an Infant at her Breast—That afterwards the Time  of Service of the said Charity was sold by Connel to Captain Jonathan Jenkins, and  that the said Charity took her said Son with her—That the said Jethro her Son,  was brought up by Jenkins until he was sit for Business, and then was sold unto  Christopher Leaming of the said County of Cape-May, who kept the said Jethro a  number of Years, and within Two Years last past sold the said Jethro unto John Ware  of Cumberland, the Defendant now in Court, for the Term of Twelve Years and Eight  Months, and by Bill of Sale engaged to warrant the Service of the said Negro Jethro  for the said Term.  

And the Court having taken the said Case into Consideration, *are unanimously of  Opinion*, That the said Jethro being the Son of a free Woman, and of the Age of  Twenty-one Years, is now entitled to his Freedom, and do therefore adjudge, that the  said Negro Jethro (otherwise called *Jethro Briggs)* be discharged  from the  Custody of the said John Ware, on the Motion of Joseph Bloomfield, Attorney  General.

  *Returnable Saturday 11th September, and returned accordingly*.  

  The Defendant appears with the Negro, to do and receive, &c. pursuant to  Recognizance.  

  THE Case stated by Counsel for, the Opinion of the Court is as  follows,  That on the fourth Day of December, 1761, John Horsfield was entitled to Two Negro  Girls, named Betty and Nelly as Slaves ; and on the said fourth Day of December by  his last Will and Testament, (then dated) made the following Devise, “Item, my  Two Negro Girls named Betty and Nelly, I leave to be sold by my Executors, hereafter  named, for the Term of Fifteen Years, and at the end of that Time to be free, and          the Money arising thereby, to be equally divided amongst my Four youngest  Daughters, and they that buy the said Negro Girls, if the said Girls or either of them  Misbehave, or become chargeable, it must be at the Risque or Cost of the Buyer.”  That the said Executors sold the said Negro Girls to one Covenhoven, who sold them  to the present Defendant Anderson, for the Term mentioned in the Will—That  Betty had a Child (the Negro Silas) now of full Age, which Child was not born in  Matrimony.  

  The Court having considered the above State of Facts, are *are  unanimously of   Opinion*, That on the Death of John Horsfield the Testator, Betty ceased to be a  Slave, that she ceasing to be a Slave, no Child born of her Body can be deemed so by  the Birth of such Child during the Fifteen Years, and that the Claim of James  Anderson to hold the said Negro Silas as a Slave, is not warranted by Law :  *Wherefore it is ordered*, That the same Silas be liberated from the  illegal  Detention of the same James Anderson, and he is hereby liberated accordingly, *ex  motione* J. Bloomfield, Attorney-General.  

  *The Attorney-General, Fisher, Howell and Todd for the negro.—R.  Stockton and Frelinghysen for defendant*.    [^]: NOTE.    *Chief Justice Kinsey, in giving the Opinion of the Court said*,  BY the words of the Will taken together, It appears that the Testator intended to  increase the Daughters' Portions, to effect this Purpose, he ordered the Mother of the  Negro now before the Court, and another, to be sold by his Executors for the Term of  Fifteen Years, and every Construction which will not detract from this Intention  should be made in a Case of this Nature—It is also evident that the Testator  foreseeing probably, that some Means might, after his Death, be made use of to  frustrate his benevolent Design, took care to guard against it, by ordering that  whoever should purchase these Negroes, the Purchasers should run all Risques, and  be at all the Expence which should arise from their Misbehaviour, the most probable  Grounds on which that Attempt might be made—The Chief Justice was of  Opinion, that these words take in the Fact which has happened, and the Purchaser  ought not to avail himself of it by making a Slave of the Child—

  The STATE *against* JOSHUA FARLEY.  

    ORDERED, that a Habeas Corpus do issue, directed to the said  Joshua  Farley for the Body of Negro  

  He thought this might be sufficient to say on the present Occasion, but he would go  further, and say that in his Opinion, at the Death of the Testator, the two Negro  Women were not Slaves, no body at that Time had that absolute Property in either,  which distinguishes the Slave from what we call a Servant, and the Retention of the  temporary Interest excludes that Supposition intirely—The Argument made use  of by the Counsel for the Claimant, from the Word *sell*, might  have had some  Weight if it had not been coupled with and explained by the particular Time to which  it applies, but taken together, it is of no kind of Consequence, neither could he give  his assent to the Idea suggested that both were Slaves until the Expiration of the  Fifteen Years : Indeed the thought in his Opinion was absurd, for he had no other Idea  of a Slave but where, the Servitude is perpetual, or in other Words for  Life—Neither did he see the Impropriety of supposing, that the Right to  Freedom subject to the Temporary servitude, might vest in the Negro at the Death of  the Testator—If this be so, and if the Misbehaviour of the Mothers were not to  affect themselves, he could not bring himself to entertain an Opinion that it should  affect their innocent offspring and make them Slaves : all that Anderson bought was  the Service of the Mother for a Term of Years, and that too subject to all Risques : As  the Party buying, had nothing else in Contemplation, no Construction can be unjust  which gives that Right in the fullest extent to him, and if he suffers by his Bargain, it  is no more than he undertook to subject himself to, and a Construction of this Nature  appeared much more Rational than one which subjects a human Creature to be a Slave  for no Fault of his own. For these Reasons the Court were unanimously of Opinion  that the Claim of James Anderson is unfounded and the Negro Boy should be  liberated from his Custody.

  The Evidence both for and against the Claim of the said Negro Joe to be set at Liberty,  being fully heard, and Counsel thereupon on both sides.  

  The Court do adjudge that the said Negro Joe is illegally detained in the Custody of  the said Joshua Farley, and therefore do order him to be discharged from the said  Custody and illegal Detention of him the said Joshua Farley, on the Motion of Elisha  Boudinot.

  The Court considering that this Point was fully argued and determined by them in the  Case of the State against Joshua Farley, *November Term* last, do  refuse to  hear any Argument thereupon, and do direct that the Cause be opened and heard  before the Court in the usual Manner ; whereupon,  The Court having heard the Return filed and Evidence and Allegations of the Parties,  *do order*, on Motion of Mr. Leake Attorney for the said  Administrators, that  the said Abraham and Dolley be remanded into the Custody of the said  Administrators.

  THE Court having fully heard the Allegations and Proofs of all  Parties, and  the Arguments of Counsel thereon ; it appeared to the Court, that the said Negroes  brought up on the said Writ, were in the Year 1776, the Slaves of William Winds,  Esq. of the County of Morris  ;—That the said William Winds, in consideration  of the good Behaviour of the said Negro Cornelius Wilson the Father, in the said Year  1776, did manumit and set free the said Cornelius, his Wife Hagar, and all the said  Children—That the said Cornelius and his Family built a House on the Lands  of the said William Winds by his Assistance, and with his Permission, and lived  thereon as Free Citizens for the Term of Three Years, when the said Cornelius Wilson  and Wife were taken sick ; on which the said William Winds removed them to a  House near his own, and took care of them till they recovered, when he employed  them and paid them          Wages for their Labor as free Persons ; That the said William Winds, fearing they  might become a burthen on his Estate, urged them to obtain security to indemnify him  from any Expence in Case of their becoming a Charge—That thereupon the  said William Winds gave to the said Negro Cornelus Wilson a Pass to go into the  County of Monmouth to obtain such Security—That the said Cornelius  accordingly went to the said County of Monmouth, and agreed with Abraham  Probasco the Defendant, that in Consideration of his becoming Security to the said  William Winds, he and his Family would serve him Five Years—That the said  Abraham Probasco in Consequence thereof, came to the said William Winds and  agreed with him accordingly, and in order to secure the said William Winds, the said  Abraham Probasco proposed, that the said William Winds should give to the said  Abraham a Bill of Sale for the said Negroes, and at the end of Five Years, the said  Abraham would release the said Negroes and set them free : That a Bill of Sale for the  Consideration of Five Shillings, without any Condition or Reservation was drawn up  accordingly by the said Abraham, and executed by the said William, and a Receipt  given by the said Abraham to the said William therefor, calling it a Deed of  Gift—That at the Execution of the said Instrument or Bill of Sale, the said  William Winds mentioned his Fear least the said Abraham should claim the said  Negroes as Slaves by virtue of the said Bill of Sale, when he and the Witnesses should  be dead, and declared that altho' he could get Two Hundred Pounds for the said  Negroes, yet he had given the said Bill of Sale for Five Shillings in order that they  might be free—That the said Negroes have faithfully served the said Abraham  for more than Six Years under the said Agreement, and are still detained by the said  Abraham who claims their Service for Life by Virtue of the said Bill of Sale.
