  HONOLULU, JUNE 30, 1866. 

## A MONTH OF MOURNING

For a little more than a month, the late PrincessHer Royal Highness Victoria   Kamamalu Kaahumanu, heir presumptive to the crown and sister to the Kinglay in state  at Iolani Palace, the royal residence. For a little over a month, troops of natives of both   sexes, drawn here from the several islands by the great event, have thronged past my door   every evening on their way to the palace. Every night, and all night long, for more than   thirty days, multitudes of these strange mourners have burned their candlenut torches in   the royal inclosure, and sung their funeral dirges, and danced their hula-hulas, and wailed  their harrowing wail for the dead. All this time we strangers have been consumed with   curiosity to look within those walls and see the pagan deviltry that was going on there.   But the thing was tabu (forbiddenwe get our word "taboo" from the Hawaiian language)   to foreignershaoles. The grounds were thrown open to everybody the first night, but   several rowdy white people acted so unbecominglyso shamefully, in factthat the King   placed a strict tabu upon their future admittance. I was absenton the island of Hawaiiat that time, and so I lost that one single opportunity to gratify my curiosity in   this matter. 

	Last night was to behold the grand finale, inasmuch as the obsequies were to   transpire today, and therefore I was a good deal gratified to learn that a few foreigners   would be allowed to enter a side gate and view the performances in the palace yard from   the veranda of Dr. Hutchinson's house (Minister of the Interior). I got there at a little after   8 P.M. 

## NIGHT SCENE IN THE PALACE GROUNDS

	The veranda we occupied overlooked the royal grounds, and afforded an excellent   view of the two thousand or twenty-five hundred natives sitting, densely packed together,   in the glare of the torches, between our position and the palace, a hundred feet in front of   us. It was a wild scenethose long rows of eager, dusky faces, with the light upon them;   the band of hula girls in the center, showily attired in white bodices and pink skirts, and   with wreaths of pink and white flowers and garlands of green leaves about their heads;   and the strongly illuminated torchbearers scattered far and near at intervals through the   large assemblage and standing up conspicuously above the masses of sitting forms. Light   enough found its way to the broad verandas of the palace to enable us to see whatever   transpired upon them with considerable distinctness. We could see nothing there,   however, except two or three native sentries in red uniforms, with gleaming muskets in   their hands. 

 Presently some one said: "Oh, there's the King!" 

 "Where?" 

	"Thereon the verandanow, he's just passing thatNo; it's that blasted Harris." 

	That isn't really his Christian name, but he is usually called by that or a stronger   one. I state this by way of explanation. Harris is the Minister of Finance and Attorney   General, and I don't know how many other things. He has three marked points: He is not   a second Solomon; he is as vain as a peacock; he is as "cheeky" ashowever, there is no   simile for his "cheek." In the Legislature, the other day, the Speaker was trying to seat a   refractory member; the member knew he was strictly in order, though, and that his only   crime was his opposition to the Ministry, and so he refused to sit down. Harris whispered  to the interpreter: "Tell the Speaker to let me have the chair a moment." The speaker   vacated his place; Harris stepped into it, rapped fiercely with the gavel, scowled   imperiously upon the intrepid commoner, and ordered him to sit down. The man declined   to do it. Harris commanded the Sergeant-at-Arms to seat him. After a trial, that officer   said the bold representative of the people refused to permit him to seat him. Harris   ordered the Sergeant to take the man out of the houseremove him by force! [Sensation  tempest, I should rather say.] The poor humbled and browbeaten country members threw   off their fears for the moment and became men; and from every part of the house they   shouted: "Come out of that chair! leave that place! put him out! put out the !" (I   have forgotten the Hawaiian phrase, but it is equivalent to "miserable dog.") And this   terrible man, who was going to perform such wonders, vacated the Speaker's chair, and   went meekly back to his own place, leaving the stout opponent of the Ministry master of   the field. The Legislature adjourned at once, and the excited and triumphant Kanakas   burst forth into a stirring battle hymn of the old days of Kamehameha the Great. Harris   was an American once (he was born in Portsmouth, N. H.) , but he is no longer one. He is   *hoopilimeaai* to the King. How do you like that, Mr. H.? How do you like being   attacked in your own native tongue? 

	(NOTE TO THE READER: That long native word meanswell, it means Uriah   Heep boiled downit means the soul and spirit of obsequiousness. No genuine American   can be other than obedient and respectful toward the Government he lives under and the   flag that protects him, but no such American can ever be hoopilimeaai to anybody.) 

	I hope the gentle reader will pardon this digression; but if the gentle reader don't   want to do it, he can let it alone. 

## A GLIMPSE OF THE HEATHEN AGES

	About half past eight o'clock a dozen native women rose up and began the sad   mourning rites. They locked arms and swayed violently backward and forward; faced   around and went through a number of quick gestures with hands, heads, and bodies;   turned and twisted and mingled togetherheads and hands going all the time, and their   motions timed to a weird howling which it would be rather complimentary to call   singing; and finished up spreading their arms abroad and throwing their heads and bodies   far backward simultaneously, and all uttering a deafening squall at the same moment. 

	"Well, if there's anything between the Farallones and Fiddler's Green as devilish   as that, I wish I may" 

	"Brown," I said, "these solemn and impressive funeral rites of the ancient times   have been rescued from the oblivion to which the ignorant missionaries consigned them   forty years ago, by the good and wise Lord Bishop Staley, and it ill beseems such as you   to speak irreverently of them. I cannot permit you to say more in this vein in my   presence." 

	When the women had finished, the multitude clapped their hands boisterously in   token of applause. 

	A number of native boys next stood up and went through a performance a good   deal like that which I have just described, singing at the same time a strange, unmusical   chant. The audience applauded again. (Harris came out once more on that part of the   veranda which could be seen best by the great assemblage, and assumed an attitude and   expression so suggestive of his being burdened with the cares of state of sixty or seventy   kingdoms, that, if I had been a stranger, I must have said to myself "The trifles Richelieu   had to contend with were foolishness to what this man has got on his hands.") 

## CHRISTIANITY AND CIVILIZATION IN WARM QUARTERS

	Next, about twenty native women dressed in black rose up and sang some hymns   like ours, but in the Kanaka tongue, and made good music of them. Some of the voices   were very rich and sweet, the harmony was excellent and the time perfect. Every now and   then, while this choir sang (and, in fact, all the evening), old-time natives scattered   through the crowd would suddenly break out into a wild heartbroken wail that would   almost startle one's pulse into stillness. And there was one old fellow near the center who   would get up often, no matter what was going on, and branch forth into a sort of singsong   recitation, which he would eventually change into a stump speech; he seemed to make a   good many hits judging by the cordial applause he got from a coterie of admirers in his   immediate vicinity. 

## MORE HEATHEN DEVILTRY

	A dozen men performed nexthowled and distorted their bodies and flung their   arms fiercely about, like very maniacs. 

	"God bless my soul, just listen at that racket! Your opinion is your opinion, and I   don't quarrel with it; and my opinion is my opinion; and I say, once for all, that if I was   Mayor of this town I would just get up here and read the Riot Act once, if I died for it the   next" 

	"Brown, I cannot allow this language. These touching expressions of mourning   were instituted by the good bishop, who has come from his English home to teach this   poor benighted race to follow the example and imitate the sinless ways of the Redeemer,   and did not he mourn for the dead Lazarus? Do not the sacred scriptures say 'Jesus   wept'?" 

	I overheard this person Brown muttering something about the imitation being   rather overdone or improved on, or something of that kind, but I paid no attention to it.   The man means well; his ignorance is his misfortunenot his crime. 

	Twenty Kanakas in striped knit shirts now filed through the dense crowd and sat   down in a double row on the ground; each bore an immense gourd, more than two feet   long, with a neck near one end and a head to it; the outer, or largest end, was a foot in   diameter; these things were dry and hollow, and are the native tom-toms or drums. Each   man set his gourd on end, and supported it with a hand on each side; at a given signal   every drummer launched out into a dismal chant and slapped his drum twice in quick   succession with his open hands; then three times; then twice again; thenwell, I cannot   describe it; they slapped the drums in every conceivable way, and the sound produced   was as dull and dry as if the drums had been solid stone; then they held them above their   heads a few moments, or over their shoulders, or in front of their faces, or behind their   necks, and then brought them simultaneously to the gound with a dead, hollow thump;   and then they went on slapping them as before. They kept up this most dreary and   unexciting performance for twenty minutes or more, and the great concourse of natives   watched every motion with rapt and eager admiration, and loudly applauded the   musicians. 

	Brown muttered (under the vile pretense of not intending to be overheard) : "Jesus   wept." 

	"Brown," I said, "your conduct is shameful. It has always been conceded that in   following the example set us by the Savior we may be allowed some latitude. But I will   not argue with a man who is so bigoted, faultfinding, and uncharitable. I will have   nothing further to say to you upon this subject." 

	"Hehe wept." 

	I thought I heard those words, but Brown's head was out of the window, and I was   not certain. I was already irritated to that degree that to speak would be to lose my   temper, and therefore I allowed the suspected mutinous language to pass unnoticed. 

## THE CELEBRATED NATIONAL DANCE ("HULA-HULA")

	After the drumming came the famous hula-hula we had heard so much about and   so longed to seethe lascivious dance that was wont to set the passions of men ablaze in   the old heathen days, a century ago. About thirty buxom young Kanaka women, gaily   attired as I have before remarked, in pink and white, and with heads wreathed with   flowers and evergreens, formed themselves into half a dozen rows of five or six in a row,   shook the reefs out of their skirts, tightened their girdles and began the most unearthly   caterwauling that was ever heard, perhaps; the noise had a marked and regular time to it,   however, and they kept strict time to it with writhing bodies; with heads and hands thrust   out to the left; then to the right; then a step to the front and the left hands all projected   simultaneously forward, and the right hands placed on the hips; then the same repeated   with a change of hands; then a mingling together of the performersquicker time, faster   and more violently excited motionsmore and more complicated gestures(the words of   their fierce chant meantime treating in broadest terms, and in detail, of things which may   be vaguely hinted at in a respectable newspaper, but not distinctly mentioned)then a   convulsive writhing of the person, continued for a few moments and ending in a sudden   stop and a grand caterwaul in chorus (great applause). 

	"Jesus wept." 

	I barely heard the words, and that was all. They sounded like blasphemy. I offered   no rebuke to the utterer, because I could not disguise from myself that the gentle grief of   the Savior was but poorly imitated herethat the heathen orgies resurrected by the Lord   Bishop of Honolulu were not warranted by the teachings of the Master whom he   professes to serve. 

	Minister Harris emerging from the Palace veranda at this moment with the weight   of his sixty kingdoms bearing down on him heavier than ever, and it being past midnight,   I judged it time to go home, and I did so. 

## WHOSE CIRCUS IT WAS

	It is reported that the King has said: "The foreigners like their religionlet them   enjoy it, and freely. But the religion of my fathers is good enough for me." Now that is all   right. At least I think so. And I have no fault to find with the natives for the lingering love   they feel for their ancient customs. But I do find fault with Bishop Staley for reviving   those customs of a barbarous age at a time when they had long been abandoned and were   being forgottenwhen one more generation of faithful adherence to the teachings of the   American missionaries would have buried them forever and made them memories of the   pastthings to be talked of and wondered at, like the old laws that made it death for a   plebeian to stand erect in the presence of his king, or for a man to speak to his wife on a   tabu daybut never imitated. 

	For forty years before the bishop brought his Royal Hawaiian Established   Reformed Catholic Church here, the kings and chiefs of this land had been buried with   the quiet, simple, Christian rites that are observed in England and America, and no man   thought of anything more being necessary. But one of the first things Bishop Staley did   when he arrived here a few years ago was to write home that the missionaries had   deprived the natives of their innocent sports and pastimes (such as the lascivious hula-hula, and the promiscuous bathing in the surf of nude natives of opposite sexes), and one   of the next things he did was to attend a hula-hula at Waikiki with his holy head tricked   out in the flower and evergreen trumpery worn by the hula girls. When the late king died,   the bishop revived the half-forgotten howling and hula dancing and other barbarisms in   the palace yard, and officiated there as a sort of master of ceremonies. For many a year   before he came, that wretchedest of all wretched musical abortions, the tom-tom, had not   been heard near the heart of Honolulu; but he has reinstated it and brought it into its   ancient esteem and popularity. The old superstitions of this people were passing away far   faster than is the case with the inhabitants of the unfrequented and sparsely populated   country districts of America, France, and Wales, but Bishop Staley is putting a stop to   progress in this direction. 

	We owe the strange and unpleasant scenes of last night to himthere are not ten   white men in the kingdom who have ever seen their like before in publicand I am told   that he is appalled at the work of his own handsthat he is ashamedthat he dreads to   think of the comments it will provoke in Christian landsin a word, that he finds, too late,   that he has made a most melancholy blunder. 

## BISHOP STALEY

	If I may speak freely, I think this all comes of elevating a weak, trivial-minded   man to a position of rank and powerof making a bishop out of very inferior materialof   trying to construct greatness out of constitutional insignificance. My estimate of Bishop   Staley is not carelessly formed; there is evidence to back it. He gossips habitually; he   lacks the common wisdom to keep still that deadly enemy of a man, his own tongue; he   says ill-advised things in public speeches, and then in other public speeches denies that   he ever said them; he shows spite, a trait which is not allied to greatness; he is fond of   rushing into print, like mediocrity the world over, and is vainer of being my Lord Bishop   over a diocese of fifteen thousand men and women (albeit they belong to other people's   churches) than some other men would be of wielding the worldwide power of the Pope;   and finally, every single important act of his administration has evinced a lack of sagacity   and an unripeness of judgment which might be forgiven a youth, but not a full-grown   manor, if that seems too severe, which might be forgiven a restless, visionary nobody,   but not a bishop. My estimate of Bishop Staley may be a wrong one, but it is at least an   honest one. 

	Persons who are intimate with Bishop Staley say he is a good man, and a well   educated and cultivated one, and that in social life he is companionable, pleasant, and   liberal spirited when church matters are not the topic of conversation. This is no doubt   true; but it is my province to speak of him in his official, not in his private capacity. He   has shown the temerity of an incautious, inexperienced, and immature judgment in   rushing in here fresh from the heart and home of a high English civilization and throwing   down the gauntlet of defiance before a band of stern, tenacious, unyielding, tireless,   industrious, devoted old Puritan knights who have seen forty years of missionary service;   whose time was never fooled away in theorizing, but whose lightest acts always meant   business; who landed here two score years ago, full of that fervent zeal and resistless   determination inherited from their Pilgrim fore-fathers, and marched forth and seized   upon this people with a grip of iron, and infused into their being, wrought into their very   natures, the spirit of democracy and the religious enthusiasm that animated themselves;   whose grip is still upon the race and can never be loosened till they, of their own free will   and accord, shall relax it. He showed a marvelous temerityone weak, inexperienced   man against a host of drilled and hardy veterans; and among them great menmen who   would be great in wider and broader spheres than that they have chosen here. He   miscalculated the force, the confidence, the determination of that Puritan spirit which   subdued America and underlies her whole religious fabric todaywhich has subdued   these islanders, and whose influence over them can never be unseated.	

## THE REFORMED CATHOLIC CHURCHTHE "COURT RELIGION"

	His church was another miscalculation. It was a mistake to appeal by imposing   ceremonies and showy display to a people imbued with a thorough Puritan distaste for   such things, and who had never been much accustomed to anything of the kind at any   period of their history. There is little in common between the simple evergreen   decorations and the tom-toms and the hula-hulas of the natives, and the cheap   magnificence of the bishop's cathedral altar,	his gaudily painted organ pipes and the   monotonous and unattractive ceremonials of his church service. 

	He is fighting with good nerve, but his side is weak. The moneyed strength of   these islandstheir agriculture, their commerce, their mercantile affairsis in the hands   of Americansrepublicans; the religious power of the country is wielded by Americans  republicans; the whole people are saturated with the spirit of democratic Puritanism,  and they arerepublicans. This is a republic, to the very marrow, and over it sit a King, a   dozen Nobles and half a dozen Ministers. The field of the Royal Hawaiian Established   Church is thus so circumscribed that the little cathedral in Nuuanu Street, with its thirty   pews of ten individual capacity each, is large enough to accommodate it in its entirety,   and have room to spare. 

 And this is the bugbear that has kept the American missionaries in hot water for   three or four years! The Bishop of Honolulu ought to feel flattered that a chance so slim   as his, and a power so feeble as his, has been able to accomplish it. But at the same time   he ought to feel grateful, because, if let alone, he and his church must infallibly have been   and remained insignificant. I do not say this ill-naturedly, for I bear the Bishop no malice,   and I respect his sacred office; I simply state a palpable fact. 

 I will say a word or two about the Reformed Catholic Church, to the end that   strangers may understand its character. Briefly, then, it is a miraculous invention. One   might worship this strange production itself without breaking the first commandment, for   there is nothing like it in the heavens above or in the earth beneath, or in the water under   the earth. The Catholics refuse to accept it as Catholic, the Episcopalians deny that it is   the church they are accustomed to, and of course the Puritans claim no kindred with it. It   is called a child of the Established Church of England, but it resembles its parent in few   particulars. It has got an altar which is gay with fiery velvet, showy white trimmings,   vases of flowers, and other mantel ornaments. (It was once flanked by imposing, seven-branched candlesticks, but these were obnoxious and have been removed.) Over it is a   thing like a gilt signboard, on which is rudely painted two processionsfour personages   in eachmarching solemnly and in single file toward the crucified Savior in the center,   and bringing their baggage with them. The design of it is a secret known only to the artist   and his Maker. Near the pulpit is a red canopied shower bathI mean it looks like oneupon which is inscribed, "Separated unto the Gospel of God." The bishop sits under it at a   small desk, when he has got nothing particular to do. The organ pipes are colored with a   groundwork of blue, which is covered all over with a flower work wrought in other   colors. Judging by its striking homeliness, I should say that the artist of the altar piece   had labored here also. Near the door of the church, but inside, of course, stands a small   pillar, surmounted by a large shell. It may be for holy water or it may be a contribution   box. If the latter be the case, I must protest that this ghastly punthis mute suggestion to   shell outis ill suited to the sacred character of the place, and it is only with the   profoundest pain that I force myself to even think for a moment upon so distressing a   circumstance. Against the wall is a picture of the future cathedral of Honolulua more   imposing structure than the present one; that many a year may elapse before it is built is   no wish of mine. A dozen acolytesChinese, Kanaka, and half-white boys, arrayed in   white robes, hold positions near the altar, and during the early part of the service they   sing and go through some performances suggestive of the regular Catholic services; after   that, the majority of the boys go off on furlough. The bishop reads a chapter from the   Bible; then the organist leaves his instrument and sings a litany peculiar to this church,   and not to be heard elsewhere; there is nothing stirring or incendiary about his mild, nasal   music; the congregation join the chorus; after this a third clergyman preaches the sermon;   these three ecclesiastics all wear white surplices. I have described the evening services.   When the bishop first came here, he indulged in a good deal of showy display and   ceremony in his church, but these proved so distasteful, even to Episcopalians, that he   shortly modified them very much. 

	I have spoken rather irreverently once or twice in the above paragraph, and am   ashamed of it. But why write it over? I would not be likely to get it any better. I might   make the matter worse. 

 	"And say that" 

	"Brown, have you, in defiance of all my reproofs, been looking over my shoulder   again?" 

	"Yes, but that's all right, you knowthat's all right. Just sayjust say that the   bishop works as hard as any man, and makes the best fight he canand that's a credit to   him, anyway." 

	"Brown, that is the first charitable sentiment I have ever heard you utter. At a   proper moment I will confer upon you a fitting reward for it. But for the present, good   night, son. Go, now. Go to your innocent slumbers. And wash your feet, Brownor   perhaps it is your teethat any rate you are unusually offensive this evening. Remedy the   matter. Never mind explaininggood night." 

## THE ROMAN CATHOLIC MISSION

	The French Roman Catholic Mission here, under the Right Reverend Lord Bishop   Maigret, goes along quietly and unostentatiously; and its affairs are conducted with a   wisdom which betrays the presence of a leader of distinguished ability. The Catholic   clergy are honest, straightforward, frank, and open; they are industrious and devoted to   their religion and their work; they never meddle; whatever they do can be relied on as   being prompted by a good and worthy motive. These things disarm resentmentprejudice   cannot exist in their presence. Consequently, Americans are never heard to speak ill or   slightingly of the French Catholic Mission. Their religion is not nondescriptit is plain,   out-and-out, undisguised, and unmistakable Catholicism. You know right where to find   them when you want them. The American missionaries have no quarrel with these men;   they honor and respect and esteem themand bid them Godspeed. There is an anomaly   for youPuritan and Roman Catholic striding along, hand in hand, under the banner of   the Cross!
