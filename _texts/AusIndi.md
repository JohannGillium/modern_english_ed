## SONG FOR THE PASSING OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
 [From the Paiute]

   - GO thy way in comeliness!
 - Strong sun across the sod doth make
 - Such quickening as thy countenance.
   - Pursue thy unguessed errand and pass by;
 - I am more worth for what thy passing wakes,
 - Great races in my loins to thee that cry!
 - My blood is redder for thy loveliness.
 - Prosper; be fair; pass by!

## [SONG OF A PASSIONATE LOVER]
  [From the Yokut]

  - COME not near my songs,
 - You who are not my lover,
 - Lest from that ambush
 - Leaps my heart upon you!
   - When my songs are glowing
 - As an almond thicket
 - With the bloom upon it,
 - Lies my heart in ambush
 - All amid my singing;
 - Come not near my songs,
 - You who are not my lover!
   - Do not hear my songs,
 - You who are not my lover!
  - Over-sweet the heart is
 - Where my love has bruised it,
 - Breathe you not that fragrance,
 - You who are not my lover;
 - Do not stoop above my heart
 - With its languor on you,
 - Lest I should not know you
 - From my own belov√®d,
 - Lest from out my singing
 - Leaps my heart upon you!
