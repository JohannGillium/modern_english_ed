#  					AMOURS DE VOYAGE. 				

  				 					 						- OH, you are sick of self love, Malvolio.
 						- And taste with a distempered appetite!—SHAKESPEARE.
 					 				  				 					 						Il doutait de tout, meme de l'amour.—FRENCH 							NOVEL. 					

 				  				 					 						Solvitur ambulando.—SOLUTIO 						SOPHISMATUM. 					

 				  				 					 						-  							Flevit amores 						
 						- Non elaboratum ad 						pedem.—HORACE.
 					 				  				 					 					 						- OVER the great windy waters, and over the clear crested summits, 
 						- Unto the sun and the sky, and unto the perfecter earth, 
 						- Come, let us go,—to a land wherein gods of the old time 							wandered, 
 						- Where every breath even now changes to ether divine. 
 						- Come, let us go; though withal a voice whisper, "The world that we live 							in, 
 						- Withersoever we turn, still is the same narrow crib;  						
 						- 'Tis but to prove limitation, and measure a cord, that we travel; 
 						- Let who would 'scape and be free go to his chamber and 							think; 
 						- 'Tis but to change idle fancies for memories wilfully falser; 
 						- 'Tis but to go and have been."—Come, little bark, 							let us go!
 					 				  				 					
## I.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  DEAR EUSTATIO, I write that you may write me an answer, 
 						- Or at the least to put us *en rapport* with each 							other, 
 						- Rome disappoints me much,—St. Peter's, perhaps, in especial; 
 						- Only the Arch of Titus and view from the Lateran please me: 
 						- This, however, perhaps, is the weather, which truly is horrid. 
 						- Greece must be better, surely; and yet I am feeling so spiteful, 
 						- That I could travel to Athens, to Delphi, and Troy, and Mount Sinai, 
 						- Though but to see with my eyes that these are vanity also. 
 					 					 						-  Rome disappoints me much; I hardly as yet understand, but 
 						- *Rubbishy* seems the word that most exactly would 							suit it. 
 						- All the foolish destructions, and all the sillier savings, 
 						- All the incongruous things of past incompatible ages, 
 						- Seem to be treasured up here to make fools of present and future. 
 						- Would to Heaven the old Goths had made a cleaner sweep of it! 
 						- Would to Heaven some new ones would come and destroy me these churches! 
 						- However, one can live in Rome as also in London. 
 						- Rome is better than London, because it is other than London. 
 						- It is a blessing, no doubt, to be rid, at least for a time, of 
 						- All one's friends and relations,—yourself (forgive me!) 							included,— 
 						- All the *assujettissement* of having been what one 							has been, 
 						- What one thinks one is, or thinks that others suppose one; 
 						- Yet, in despite of all, we turn like fools to the English. 
 						- Vernon has been my fate; who is here the same that you knew 							him,— 
 						- Making the tour, it seems, with friends of the name of Trevellyn. 
 					 				  				 					
## II.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  Rome disappoints me still; but I shrink and adapt myself 							to it. 
 						- Somehow a tyrannous sense of a superincumbent oppression 
 						- Still, wherever I go, accompanies ever, and makes me 
 						- Feel like a tree (shall I say?) buried under a ruin of brick-work. 
 						- Rome, believe me, my friend, is like its own Monte Testacco, 
 						- Merely a marvellous mass of broken and castaway wine-pots. 
 						- Ye gods! what do I want with this rubbish of ages departed, 
 						- Things that Nature abhors, the experiments that she has failed in? 
 						- What do I think of the Forum? An archway and two or three pillars. 
 						- Well, but St. Peter's? Alas, Bernini has filled it with sculpture! 
 						- No one can cavil, I grant, at the size of the great Coliseum. 
 						- Doubtless the notion of grand and capacious and massive amusement, 
 						- This the old Romans had; but tell me, is this an idea? 
 						- Yet of solidity much, but splendor little is extant: 
 						- "Brickwork I found thee, and marble I left thee!" their Emperor vaunted; 
 						- "Marble I thought thee, and brickwork I find thee!" the Tourist may 							answer. 
 					 					 				  				 					
## III.—GEORGINA TREVELLYN TO LOUISA—

  					 						-  AT last, dearest Louisa, take up my pen to address you. 
 						- Here we are, you see, with the seven-and-seventy boxes, 
 						- Courier, Papa and Mamma, the children, and Mary and Susan: 
 						- Here we all are at Rome, and delighted of course with St. Peter's, 
 						- And very pleasantly lodged in the famous Piazza di Spagna. 
 						- Rome is a wonderful place, but Mary shall tell you about it; 
 						- Not very gay, however; the English are mostly at Naples; 
 						- There are the A.s, we hear, and most of the W. party. 
 						- George, however, is come; did I tell you about his mustachios? 
 						- Dear, I must really stop, for the carriage, they tell me, is waiting. 
 						- Mary will finish; and Susan is writing, they say, to Sophia. 
 						- Adieu, dearest Louise,—evermore your faithful Georgina. 
 						- Who can a Mr. Claude be whom George has taken to be with? 
 						- Very stupid, I think, but George says so *very* 							clever. 
 					 				  				 					
## IV.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  No, the Christian faith, as at any rate I understood it, 
 						- With its humiliations and exaltations combining, 
 						- Exaltations sublime, and yet diviner abasements, 
 						- Aspirations from something most shameful here upon earth and 
 						- In our poor selves to something most perfect above in the 							heavens,— 
 						- No, the Christian faith, as I, at least, understood it, 
 						- Is not here, O Rome, in any of these thy churches; 
 						- Is not here, but in Freiberg, or Rheims, or Westminster Abbey. 
 						- What in thy Dome I find, in all thy recenter efforts, 
 						- Is a something, I think, more *rational* far, more 							earthly, 
 						- Actual, less ideal, devout not in scorn and refusal, 
 						- But in a positive, calm, Stoic-Epicurean acceptance. 
 						- This I begin to detect in St. Peter's and some of the churches, 
 						- Mostly in all that I see of the sixteenth-century masters; 
 						- Overlaid of course with infinite gauds and gewgaws, 
 						- Innocent, playful follies, the toys and trinkets of childhood, 
 						- Forced on maturer years, as the serious one thing essential, 
 						- By the barbarian will of the rigid and ignorant Spaniard. 
 					 				  				 					
## V.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  LUTHER, they say, was unwise; like a half-taught German, 							he could not 
 						- See that old follies were passing most tranquilly out of remembrance; 
 						- Leo the Tenth was employing all efforts to clear out abuses; 
 						- Jupiter, Juno, and Venus, Fine Arts, and Fine Letters, the Poets, 
 						- Scholars, and Sculptors, and Painters, were quietly clearing away the 
 						- Martyrs, and Virgins, and Saints, or at any rate Thomas Aquinas. 
 						- He must forsooth make a fuss and distend his huge Wittenberg lungs, and 
 						- Bring back Theology once yet again in a flood upon Europe: 
 						- Lo, you, for forty days from the windows of heaven it fell; the 
 						- Waters prevail on the earth yet more for a hundred and fifty; 
 						- Are they abating at last? The doves that are sent to explore are 
 						- Wearily fain to return, at the best with a leaflet of promise,— 
 						- Fain to return, as they went, to the wandering wave-tost 							vessel,—  						
 						- Fain to reenter the roof which covers the clean and the unclean. 
 						- Luther, they say, was unwise; he didn't see how things were going; 
 						- Luther was foolish,—but, O great God! what call you Ignatius? 
 						- O my tolerant soul, be still! but you talk of barbarians, 
 						- Alaric, Attila, Genseric;—why, they came, they killed, they 
 						- Ravaged, and went on their way; but these vile, tyrannous Spaniards, 
 						- These are here still,—how long, O ye Heavens, in the country of 							Dante? 
 						- These, that fanaticized Europe, which now can forget them, release not 
 						- This, their choicest of prey, this Italy; here you can see 							them,— 
 						- Here, with emasculate pupils and gimcrack churches of Gesu, 
 						- Pseudo-learning and lies, confessional-boxes and postures,— 
 						- Here, with metallic beliefs and regimental devotions,— 
 						- Here, overcrusting with shame, perverting, defacing, debasing, 
 						- Michael Angelo's dome, that had hung the Pantheon in heaven, 
 						- Raphael's Joys and Graces, and thy clear stars, Galileo! 
 					 				  				 					
## VI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  WHICH of three Misses Trevellyn it is that Vernon shall 							marry 
 						- Is not a thing to be known; for our friend's is one of those natures 
 						- Which have their perfect delight in the general tender-domestic, 
 						- So that he trifles with Mary's shawl, ties Susan's bonnet, 
 						- Dances with all, but at home is most, they say, with Georgina, 
 						- Who is, however, *too* silly in my apprehension for 							Vernon. 
 						- I, as before when I wrote, continue to see them a little; 
 						- Not that I like them so much, or care a *bajocco* 							for Vernon, 
 						- But I am slow at Italian, have not many English acquaintance, 
 						- And I am asked, in short, and am not good at excuses. 
 						- Middle-class people these, bankers very likely, not wholly 
 						- Pure of the taint of the shop; will at table d'hote and restaurant 
 						- Have their shilling's worth, their penny's pennyworth even: 
 						- Neither man's aristocracy this, nor God's, God knoweth! 
 						- Yet they are fairly descended, they give you to know, well connected; 
 						- Doubtless somewhere in some neighborhood have, and careful to keep, some 
 						- Threadbare-genteel relations, who in their turn are enchanted 
 						- Grandly among county people to introduce at assemblies 
 						- To the unpennied cadets our cousins with excellent fortunes. 
 						- Neither man's aristocracy this, nor God's, God knoweth! 
 					 				  				 					
## VII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  AH, what a shame, indeed, to abuse these most worthy 							people! 
 						- Ah, what a sin to have sneered at their innocent rustic pretensions! 
 						- Is it not laudable really, this reverent worship of station? 
 						- Is it not fitting that wealth should tender this homage to culture? 
 						- Is it not touching to witness these efforts, if little availing, 
 						- Painfully made, to perform the old ritual service of manners? 
 						- Shall not devotion atone for the absence of knowledge? and fervor 
 						- Palliate, cover, the fault of a superstitious observance? 
 						- Dear, dear, what have I said? but, alas, just now, like Iago, 
 						- I can be nothing at all, if it is not critical wholly; 
 						- So in fantastic height, in coxcomb exaltation,  						
 						- Here in the Garden I walk, can freely concede to the Maker 
 						- That the works of his hand are all very good; his creatures, 
 						- Beast of the field and fowl, he brings them before me; I name them; 
 						- That which I name them, they are,—the bird, the beast, and the 							cattle. 
 						- But for Adam,—alas, poor critical coxcomb Adam! 
 						- But for Adam there is not found an help-meet for him. 
 					 				  				 					
## VIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  NO, great Dome of Agrippa, thou art not Christian! canst 							not, 
 						- Strip and replaster and daub and do what they will with thee, be so! 
 						- Here underneath the great porch of colossal Corinthian columns, 
 						- Here as I walk, do I dream of the Christian belfries above them; 
 						- Or on a bench as I sit and abide for long hours, till thy whole vast 
 						- Round grows dim as in dreams to my eyes, I repeople thy niches, 
 						- Not with the Martyrs, and Saints, and Confessors, and Virgins, and 							children, 
 						- But with the mightier forms of an older, austerer worship; 
 						- And I recite to myself, how 
 					 					 						-  Eager for battle here 
 						- Stood Vulcan, here matronal Juno, 
 						- And with the bow to his shoulder faithful 
 						- He who with pure dew laveth of Castaly 
 						- His flowing locks, who holdeth of Lycia 
 						- The oak forest and the wood that bore him, 
 						- Delos and Patara's own Apollo* 
 					 					 						-  							 *Hic avidus stetit  						
 						-  							Vulcanus, hic matrona Juno, et  						
 						-  							Nunquam humero positurus arcum,  						
 						-  							Qui rore puro Castaliae lavat  						
 						-  							Crines solutos, qui Lyciae tenet  						
 						-  							Dumeta natalemque sylvam,  						
 						-  							Delius et Patareus Apollo.  						
 					 				  				 					
## IX.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  YET it is pleasant, I own it, to be in their company; 							pleasant, 
 						- Whatever else it may be, to abide in the feminine presence. 
 						- Pleasant, but wrong, will you say? But this happy, serene coexistence 
 						- Is to some poor soft souls, I fear, a necessity simple, 
 						- Meat and drink and life, and music, filling with sweetness, 
 						- Thrilling with melody sweet, with harmonies strange overwhelming, 
 						- All the long-silent strings of an awkward, meaningless fabric. 
 						- Yet as for that, I could live, I believe, with children; to have those 
 						- Pure and delicate forms encompassing, moving about you, 
 						- This were enough, I could think; and truly with glad resignation 
 						- Could from the dream of romance, from the fever of flushed adolescence, 
 						- Look to escape and subside into peaceful avuncular functions. 
 						- Nephews and nieces! alas, for as yet I have none! and, moreover, 
 						- Mothers are jealous, I fear me, too often, too rightfully; fathers 
 						- Think they have title exclusive to spoiling their own little darlings; 
 						- And by the law of the land, in despite of Malthusian doctrine, 
 						- No sort of proper provision is made for that most patriotic, 
 						- Most meritorious subject, the childless and bachelor uncle. 
 					 					 				  				 					
## X.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  YE, too, marvellous Twain, that erect on the Monte Cavallo 
 						- Stand by your rearing steeds in the grace of your motionless movement, 
 						- Stand with your upstretched arms and tranquil regardant faces, 
 						- Stand as instinct with life in the might of immutable manhood,— 
 						- O ye mighty and strange, ye ancient divine ones of Hellas, 
 						- Are ye Christian too? to convert and redeem and renew you, 
 						- Will the brief form have sufficed, that a Pope has set up on the apex 
 						- Of the Egyptian stone that o'ertops you the Christian symbol? 
 						- And ye, silent, supreme in serene and victorious marble, 
 						- Ye that encircle the walls of the stately Vatican chambers, 
 						- Juno and Ceres, Minerva, Apollo, the Muses and Bacchus, 
 						- Ye unto whom far and near come posting the Christian pilgrims, 
 						- Ye that are ranged in the halls of the mystic Christian pontiff, 
 						- Are ye also baptized? are ye of the Kingdom of Heaven? 
 						- Utter, O some one, the word that shall reconcile Ancient and Modern! 
 						- Am I to turn me for this unto thee, great Chapel of Sixtus? 
 					 				  				 					
## XI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  THESE are the facts. The uncle, the elder brother, the 							squire, (a 
 						- Little embarrassed, I fancy,) resides in a family place in 
 						- Cornwall, of course. "Papa is in business," Mary informs me; 
 						- He's a good sensible man, whatever his trade is. The mother 
 						- Is—shall I call it fine?—herself she would tell you 							refined, and 
 						- Greatly, I fear me, looks down on my bookish and maladroit manners; 
 						- Somewhat affecteth the blue; would talk to me often of poets; 
 						- Quotes, which I hate, Childe Harold; but also appreciates Wordsworth; 
 						- Sometimes adventures on Schiller; and then to religion diverges; 
 						- Questions me much about Oxford; and yet, in her loftiest flights, still 
 						- Grates the fastidious ear with the slightly mercantile accent. 
 					 					 						-  Is it contemptible, Eustace,—I'm perfectly ready 							to think so,— 
 						- Is it,—the horrible pleasure of pleasing inferior people? 
 						- I am ashamed my own self; and yet true it is, if disgraceful, 
 						- That for the first time in life I am living and moving with freedom. 
 						- I, who never could talk to the people I meet with my uncle,— 
 						- I, who have always failed,—I, trust me, can suit the 							Trevellyns; 
 						- I, believe me,—great conquest,—am liked by the 							country bankers. 
 						- And I am glad to be liked, and like in return very kindly. 
 						- So it proceeds;  								*Laissez faire, laissez aller* 							,—such is the watchword. 
 						- Well, I know there are thousands as pretty and hundreds as pleasant, 
 						- Girls by the dozen as good, and girls in abundance with polish 
 						- Higher and manners more perfect than Susan or Mary Trevellyn. 
 						- Well, I know, after all, it is only juxtaposition,— 
 						- Juxtaposition, in short; and what is juxtaposition? 
 					 				  				 					
## XII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  BUT I am in for it now,— 								*laissez faire* 							, of a truth,  								*laissez aller* 							. 
 						- Yes, I am going,—I feel it, I feel and cannot recall 							it,— 
 						- Fusing with this thing and that, entering into all sorts of relations, 								 						
 						- Tying I know not what ties, which, whatever they are, I know one thing, 
 						- Will and must, woe is me, be one day painfully broken,— 
 						- Broken with painful remorses, with shrinkings of soul, and relentings, 
 						- Foolish delays, more foolish evasions, most foolish renewals. 
 						- But I am in for it now,—I have quitted the ship of Ulysses; 
 						- Yet on my lips is the *moly*, medicinal, offered of 							Hermes. 
 						- I have passed into the precinct, the labyrinth closes around me, 
 						- Path into path rounding slyly; I pace slowly on, and the fancy, 
 						- Struggling awhile to sustain the long sequences, weary, bewildered, 
 						- Fain must collapse in despair; I yield, I am lost and know nothing; 
 						- Yet in my bosom unbroken remaineth the clue; I shall use it. 
 						- Lo, with the rope on my loins I descend through the fissure; I sink, yet 
 						- Inly secure in the strength of invisible arms up above me; 
 						- Still, wheresoever I swing, wherever to shore, or to shelf, or 
 						- Floor of cavern untrodden, shell-sprinkled, enchanting, I know I 
 						- Yet shall one time feel the strong cord tighten about me,— 
 						- Feel it, relentless, upbear me from spots I would rest in; and though the 
 						- Rope sway wildly, I faint, crags wound me, from crag unto crag re-
 						- Bounding, or, wide in the void, I die ten deaths ere the end, I 
 						- Yet shall plant firm foot on the broad lofty spaces I quit, shall 
 						- Feel underneath me again the great massy strengths of abstraction, 
 						- Look yet abroad from the height o'er the sea whose salt wave I have 							tasted. 
 					 				  				 					
## XIII.—GEORGINA TREVELLYN TO LOUISA—

  					 						-  DEAREST LOUISA,—Inquire, if you please, about 							Mr. Claude—. 
 						- He has been once at R., and remembers meeting the H.s. 
 						- Harriet L., perhaps, may be able to tell you about him. 
 						- It is an awkward youth, but still with very good manners; 
 						- Not without prospects, we hear; and, George says, highly connected. 
 						- Georgy declares it absurd, but Mamma is alarmed and insists he has 
 						- Taken up strange opinions and may be turning a Papist. 
 						- Certainly once he spoke of a daily service he went to. 
 						- "Where?" we asked, and he laughed and answered, "At the Pantheon." 
 						- This was a temple, you know, and now is a Catholic church; and 
 						- Though it is said that Mazzini has sold it for Protestant service, 
 						- Yet I suppose the change can hardly as yet be effected. 
 						- Adieu again,—evermore, my dearest, your loving Georgina. 
 					 				  				 					
## P. S. BY MARY TREVELLYN.

  					 						-  I AM to tell you, you say, what I think of our last new 							acquaintance. 
 						- Well, then, I think that George has a very fair right to be jealous. 
 						- I do not like him much, though I do not dislike being with him. 
 						- He is what people call, I suppose, a superior man, and 
 						- Certainly seems so to me; but I think he is frightfully selfish. 
 					 					 —

 				  				 					  					 						- ALBA, thou findest me still, and, Alba, thou findest me ever, 
 						- Now from the Capitol steps, now over Titus's Arch, 
 						- Here from the large grassy spaces that spread from the Lateran portal, 
 						- Towering o'er aqueduct lines lost in perspective between, 								 						
 						- Or from a Vatican window, or bridge, or the high Coliseum, 
 						- Clear by the garlanded line cut of the Flavian ring. 
 						- Beautiful can I not call thee, and yet thou hast power to o'ermaster, 
 						- Power of mere beauty; in dreams, Alba, thou hauntest me 							still. 
 						- Is it religion? I ask me; or is it a vain superstition? 
 						- Slavery abject and gross? service, too feeble, of truth? 
 						- Is it an idol I bow to, or is it a god that I worship? 
 						- Do I sink back on the old, or do I soar from the mean? 
 						- So through the city I wander and question, unsatisfied ever, 
 						- Reverent so I accept, doubtful because I revere. 
 					 					 [To be continued.]

 				 			    			 				 				
# AMOURS DE VOYAGE.
 [Continued.]
II.

   				 					 					 						-  IS it illusion? or does there a spirit from perfecter ages, 
 						- Here, even yet, amid loss, change, and corruption, abide? 
 						- Does there a spirit we know not, though seek, though we find, comprehend 							not, 
 						- Here to entice and confuse, tempt and evade us, abide? 
 						- Lives in the exquisite grace of the column disjointed and single, 
 						- Haunts the rude masses of brick garlanded gayly with vine, 
 						- E'en in the turret fantastic surviving that springs from the ruin, 
 						- E'en in the people itself? Is it illusion or not? 
 						- Is it illusion or not that attracteth the pilgrim Transalpine, 
 						- Brings him a dullard and dunce hither to pry and to stare? 
 						- Is it illusion or not that allures the barbarian stranger, 
 						- Brings him with gold to the shrine, brings him in arms to 							the gate? 
 					 				  				 					
## I.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  WHAT do the people say, and what does the government do?—you 
 						- Ask, and I know not at all. Yet fortune will favor your hopes; and 
 						- I, who avoided it all, am fated, it seems, to describe it. 
 						- I, who nor meddle nor make in politics,—I, who sincerely 
 						- Put not my trust in leagues nor any suffrage by ballot, 
 						- Never predicted Parisian millenniums, never beheld a 
 						- New Jerusalem coming down dressed like a bride out of heaven 
 						- Right on the Place de la Concorde,—I, ne'ertheless, let me say 							it, 
 						- Could in my soul of souls, this day, with the Gaul at the gates, shed 
 						- One true tear for thee, thou poor little Roman republic!  						
 						- France, it is foully done! and you, my stupid old 							England,— 
 						- You, who a twelvemonth ago said nations must choose for themselves, you 
 						- Could not, of course, interfere,—you, now, when a nation has 							chosen— 
 						- Pardon this folly! *The Times* will, 							of course, have announced the occasion, 
 						- Told you the news of to-day; and although it was slightly in error 
 						- When it proclaimed as a fact the Apollo was sold to a Yankee, 
 						- You may believe when it tells you the French are at Civita Vecchia. 
 					 				  				 					
## II.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  "DULCE" it is, and *"decorum*," no doubt, for the 							country to fall,—to 
 						- Offer one's blood an oblation to Freedom, and die for the Cause; yet 
 						- Still, individual culture is also something, and no man 
 						- Finds quite distinct the assurance that he of all others is called on, 
 						- Or would be justified, even, in taking away from the world that 
 						- Precious creature, himself. Nature sent him here to abide here; 
 						- Else why sent him at all? Nature wants him still, it is likely. 
 						- On the whole, we are meant to look after ourselves; it is certain 
 						- Each has to eat for himself, digest for himself, and in general 
 						- Care for his own dear life, and see to his own preservation; 
 						- Nature's intentions, in most things uncertain, in this most plain and 							decisive: 
 						- These, on the whole, I conjecture the Romans will follow, and I shall. 
 						- So we cling to the rocks like limpets; Ocean may bluster, 
 						- Over and under and round us; we open our shells to imbibe our 
 						- Nourishment, close them again, and are safe, fulfilling the purpose 
 						- Nature intended,—a wise one, of course, and a noble, we doubt 							not. 
 						- Sweet it may be and decorous, perhaps, for the country to die; but, 
 						- On the whole, we conclude the Romans won't do it, and I shan't. 
 					 				  				 					
## III.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  WILL they fight? They say so. And will the French? I can hardly, 
 						- Hardly think so; and yet— He is come, they say, to Palo, 
 						- He is passed from Monterone, at Santa Severa 
 						- He hath laid up his guns. But the Virgin, the Daughter of Roma, 
 						- She hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn,—the Daughter 							of Tiber 
 						- She hath shaken her head and built barricades against thee! 
 						- Will they fight? I believe it. Alas, 'tis ephemeral folly, 
 						- Vain and ephemeral folly, of course, compared with pictures, 
 						- Statues, and antique gems,—indeed: and yet indeed too, 
 						- Yet methought, in broad day did I dream,—tell it not in St. 							James's, 
 						- Whisper it not in thy courts, O Christ Church!—yet did I, 							waking, 
 						- Dream of a cadence that sings,  								*Si tombent nos jeunes heros, la* 							 						
 						-  								*Terre en produit de nouveaux contre vous tous 									prets a se battre* 							; 
 						- Dreamt of great indignations and angers transcendental, 
 						- Dreamt of a sword at my side and a battle-horse underneath me. 
 					 				  				 					
## IV.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  NOW supposing the French or the Neapolitan soldier 
 						- Should by some evil chance come exploring the Maison Serny,  						
 						- (Where the family English are all to assemble for safety,) 
 						- Am I prepared to lay down my life for the British female? 
 						- Really, who knows? One has bowed and talked, till, little by little, 
 						- All the natural heat has escaped of the chivalrous spirit. 
 						- Oh, one conformed, of course; but one doesn't die for good manners, 
 						- Stab or shoot, or be shot, by way of a graceful attention. 
 						- No, if it should be at all, it should be on the barricades there; 
 						- Should I incarnadine ever this inky pacifical finger, 
 						- Sooner far should it be for this vapor of Italy's freedom, 
 						- Sooner far by the side of the damned and dirty plebeians. 
 						- Ah, for a child in the street I could strike; for the 							full-blown lady— 
 						- Somehow, Eustace, alas, I have not felt the vocation. 
 						- Yet these people of course will expect, as of course, my 							protection, 
 						- Vernon in radiant arms stand forth for the lovely Georgina, 
 						- And to appear, I suppose, were but common civility. Yes, and 
 						- Truly I do not desire they should either be killed or offended. 
 						- Oh, and of course you will say, "When the time comes, you 							will be ready," 
 						- Ah, but before it comes, am I to presume it will be so? 
 						- What I cannot feel now, am I to suppose that I shall feel? 
 						- Am I not free to attend for the ripe and indubious instinct? 
 						- Am I forbidden to wait for the clear and lawful perception? 
 						- Is it the calling of man to surrender his knowledge and insight, 
 						- For the mere venture of what may, perhaps, be the virtuous action? 
 						- Must we, walking o'er earth, discerning a little, and hoping 
 						- Some plain visible task shall yet for our hands be assigned 							us,— 
 						- Must we abandon the future for fear of omitting the present, 
 						- Quit our own fireside hopes at the alien call of a neighbor, 
 						- To the mere possible shadow of Deity offer the victim? 
 						- And is all this, my friend, but a weak and ignoble repining, 
 						- Wholly unworthy the head or the heart of Your Own Correspondent? 
 					 				  				 					
## V.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  YES, we are fighting at last, it appears. This morning, as usual, 
 						- *Murray*, as usual, in hand, I enter the Caffe 							Nuovo; 
 						- Seating myself with a sense as it were of a change in the weather, 
 						- Not understanding, however, but thinking mostly of Murray, 
 						- And, for to-day is their day, of the Campidoglio Marbles, 
 						-  								*Caffe-latte!* 							 I call to the waiter,—and  								*Non c' e latte* 							, 
 						- This is the answer he makes me, and this the sign of a battle. 
 						- So I sit; and truly they seem to think any one else more 
 						- Worthy than me of attention. I wait for my milkless *nero*, 
 						- Free to observe undistracted all sorts and sizes of persons, 
 						- Blending civilian and soldier in strangest costume, coming in, and 
 						- Gulping in hottest haste, still standing, their 							coffee,—withdrawing 
 						- Eagerly, jangling a sword on the steps, or jogging a musket 
 						- Slung to the shoulder behind. They are fewer, moreover, than usual, 
 						- Much, and silenter far; and so I begin to imagine 
 						- Something is really afloat. Ere I leave, the Caffe is empty, 
 						- Empty too the streets, in all its length the Corso 
 						- Empty, and empty I see to my right and left the Condotti. 
 						- Twelve o'clock, on the Pincian Hill, with lots of English, 								 						
 						- Germans, Americans, French,—the Frenchmen, too, are protected. 
 						- So we stand in the sun, but afraid of a probable shower; 
 						- So we stand and stare, and see, to the left of St. Peter's, 
 						- Smoke, from the cannon, white,—but that is at intervals 							only,— 
 						- Black, from a burning house, we suppose, by the Cavalleggieri; 
 						- And we believe we discern some lines of men descending 
 						- Down through the vineyard-slopes, and catch a bayonet gleaming. 
 						- Every ten minutes, however,—in this there is no 							misconception,— 
 						- Comes a great white puff from behind Michel Angelo's dome, and 
 						- After a space the report of a real big gun,—not the 							Frenchman's?— 
 						- That must be doing some work. And so we watch and conjecture. 
 						- Shortly, an Englishman comes, who says he has been to St. 							Peter's, 
 						- Seen the Piazza and troops, but that is all he can tell us; 
 						- So we watch and sit, and, indeed, it begins to be tiresome.— 
 						- All this smoke is outside; when it has come to the inside, 
 						- It will be time, perhaps, to descend and retreat to our houses. 
 						- Half-past one, or two. The report of small arms frequent, 
 						- Sharp and savage indeed; that cannot all be for nothing: 
 						- So we watch and wonder; but guessing is tiresome, very. 
 						- Weary of wondering, watching, and guessing, and gossiping idly, 
 						- Down I go, and pass through the quiet streets with the knots of 
 						- National Guards patrolling, and flags hanging out at the windows, 
 						- English, American, Danish,—and, after offering to help an 
 						- Irish family moving *en masse* to the Maison Serny, 
 						- After endeavoring idly to minister balm to the trembling 
 						- Quinquagenarian fears of two lone British spinsters, 
 						- Go to make sure of my dinner before the enemy enter. 
 						- But by this time there are signs of stragglers returning; and voices 
 						- Talk, though you don't believe it, of guns and prisoners taken; 
 						- And on the walls you read the first bulletin of the morning.— 
 						- This is all that I saw, and all I know of the battle. 
 					 				  				 					
## VI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  VICTORY! VICTORY!—Yes! ah, yes, thou republican Zion, 
 						- Truly the kings of the earth are gathered and gone by together; 
 						- Doubtless they marvelled to witness such things, were astonished, and so 							forth. 
 						- Victory! Victory! Victory!—Ah, but it is, believe me, 
 						- Easier, easier far, to intone the chant of the martyr 
 						- Than to indite any paean of any victory. Death may 
 						- Sometimes be noble; but life, at the best, will appear an illusion. 
 						- While the great pain is upon us, it is great; when it is over, 
 						- Why, it is over. The smoke of the sacrifice rises to heaven, 
 						- Of a sweet savor, no doubt, to somebody; but on the altar, 
 						- Lo, there is nothing remaining but ashes and dirt and ill odor. 
 						- So it stands, you perceive; the labial muscles, that 							swelled with 
 						- Vehement evolution of yesterday Marseillaises, 
 						- Articulations sublime of defiance and scorning, to-day col-
 						- Lapse and languidly mumble, while men and women and papers 
 						- Scream and re-scream to each other the chorus of Victory. Well, but 
 						- I am thankful they fought, and glad that the Frenchmen were beaten.  						
 					 				  				 					
## VII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  So I have seen a man killed! An experience that, among others! 
 						- Yes, I suppose I have; although I can hardly be certain, 
 						- And in a court of justice could never declare I had seen it. 
 						- But a man was killed, I am told, and I saw something. 
 						- I was returning home from St. Peter's; Murray, as usual, 
 						- Under my arm, I remember; had crossed the St. Angelo bridge; and 
 						- Moving towards the Condotti, had got to the first barricade, when 
 						- Gradually, thinking still of St. Peter's, I became conscious 
 						- Of a sensation of movement opposing me,—tendency this way 
 						- (Such as one fancies may be in a stream when the wave of the tide is 
 						- Coming and not yet come,—a sort of poise and retention); 
 						- So I turned, and, before I turned, caught sight of stragglers 
 						- Heading a crowd, it is plain, that is coming behind that corner. 
 						- Looking up, I see windows filled with heads; the Piazza, 
 						- Into which you remember the Ponte St. Angelo enters, 
 						- Since I passed, has thickened with curious groups; and now the 
 						- Crowd is coming, has turned, has crossed that last barricade, is 
 						- Here at my side. In the middle they drag at something. What is it? 
 						- Ha! bare swords in the air, held up! There seem to be voices 
 						- Pleading and hands putting back; official, perhaps; but the swords are 
 						- Many, and bare in the air,—in the air! They descend! They are 							smiting, 
 						- Hewing, chopping! At what? In the air once more upstretched! And 
 						- Is it blood that's on them? Yes, certainly blood! Of whom, then? 
 						- Over whom is the cry of this furor of exultation? 
 						- While they are skipping and screaming, and dancing their 							caps on the points of 
 						- Swords and bayonets, I to the outskirts back, and ask a 
 						- Mercantile-seeming bystander, "What is it?" and he, looking always 
 						- That way, makes me answer, "A Priest, who was trying to fly to 
 						- The Neapolitan army,"—and thus explains the proceeding. 
 						- You didn't see the dead man? No;—I began to be 							doubtful; 
 						- I was in black myself, and didn't know what mightn't happen;— 
 						- But a National Guard close by me, outside of the hubbub, 
 						- Broke his sword with slashing a broad hat covered with 							dust,—and 
 						- Passing away from the place with Murray under my arm, and 
 						- Stooping, I saw through the legs of the people the legs of a body. 
 						- You are the first, do you know, to whom I have mentioned 							the matter. 
 						- Whom should I tell it to, else?—these girls?—the 							Heavens forbid it!— 
 						- Quidnuncs at Monaldini's?—idlers upon the Pincian? 
 						- If I rightly remember, it happened on that afternoon when 
 						- Word of the nearer approach of a new Neapolitan army 
 						- First was spread. I began to bethink me of Paris Septembers, 
 						- Thought I could fancy the look of the old 'Ninety-two. On that evening, 
 						- Three or four, or, it may be, five, of these people were slaughtered. 
 						- Some declare they had, one of them, fired on a sentinel; others 
 						- Say they were only escaping; a Priest, it is currently stated, 
 						- Stabbed a National Guard on the very Piazza Colonna: 
 						- History, Rumour of Rumours, I leave it to thee to determine! 
 						- But I am thankful to say the government seems to have 							strength to  						
 						- Put it down; it has vanished, at least; the place is now peaceful. 
 						- Through the Trastevere walking last night, at nine of the clock, I 
 						- Found no sort of disorder; I crossed by the Island-bridges, 
 						- So by the narrow streets to the Ponte Rotto, and onwards 
 						- Thence, by the Temple of Vesta, away to the great Coliseum, 
 						- Which at the full of the moon is an object worthy a visit. 
 					 				  				 					
## VIII.—GEORGINA TREVELLYN TO LOUISA —

 					 						-  ONLY think, dearest Louisa, what fearful scenes we have 							witnessed!— 
 						-  * * * * * 
 						- George has just seen Garibaldi, dressed up in a long white cloak, on 
 						- Horseback, riding by, with his mounted negro behind him; 
 						- This is a man, you know, who came from America with him, 
 						- Out of the woods, I suppose, and uses a *lasso* in 							fighting, 
 						- Which is, I don't quite know, but a sort of noose, I imagine; 
 						- This he throws on the heads of the enemy's men in a battle, 
 						- Pulls them into his reach, and then most cruelly kills them: 
 						- Mary does not believe, but we heard it from an Italian. 
 						- Mary allows she was wrong about Mr. Claude *being selfish*; 
 						- He was *most* useful and kind on the terrible 							thirtieth of April. 
 						- Do not write here any more; we are starting directly for 							Florence: 
 						- We should be off to-morrow, if only Papa could get horses; 
 						- All have been seized everywhere for the use of this dreadful Mazzini. 						
 					 					 						
## P.S.

 						-  Mary has seen thus far.—I am really so angry, 							Louisa,— 
 						- Quite out of patience, my dearest! What can the man be intending? 
 						- I am quite tired; and Mary, who might bring him to in a moment, 
 						- Lets him go on as he likes, and neither will help nor dismiss him. 
 					 				  				 					
## IX.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  IT is most curious to see what a power a few calm words (in 
 						- Merely a brief proclamation) appear to possess on the people. 
 						- Order is perfect, and peace; the city is utterly tranquil; 
 						- And one cannot conceive that this easy and *nonchalant* crowd, that 
 						- Flows like a quiet stream through street and market-place, entering 
 						- Shady recesses and bays of church, *osteria* and *caffe*, 
 						- Could in a moment be changed to a flood as of molten lava, 
 						- Boil into deadly wrath and wild homicidal delusion. 
 						- Ah, 'tis an excellent race,—and even in old 							degradation, 
 						- Under a rule that enforces to flattery, lying, and cheating, 
 						- E'en under Pope and Priest, a nice and natural people. 
 						- Oh, could they but be allowed this chance of redemption!—but 							clearly 
 						- That is not likely to be. Meantime, notwithstanding all journals, 
 						- Honor for once to the tongue and the pen of the eloquent writer! 
 						- Honor to speech! and all honor to thee, thou noble Mazzini! 
 					 				 				 					
## X.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  I AM in love, meantime, you think; no doubt, you would think so. 
 						- I am in love, you say; with those letters, of course, you would say so. 								 						
 						- I am in love, you declare. I think not so; yet I grant you 
 						- It is a pleasure, indeed, to converse with this girl. Oh, rare gift, 
 						- Rare felicity, this! she can talk in a rational way, can 
 						- Speak upon subjects that really are matters of mind and of thinking, 
 						- Yet in perfection retain her simplicity; never, one moment, 
 						- Never, however you urge it, however you tempt her, consents to 
 						- Step from ideas and fancies and loving sensations to those vain 
 						- Conscious understandings that vex the minds of man-kind. 
 						- No, though she talk, it is music; her fingers desert not the keys; 'tis 
 						- Song, though you hear in her song the articulate vocables sounded, 
 						- Syllabled singly and sweetly the words of melodious meaning. 
 					 				  				 					
## XI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  AH, let me look; let me watch, let me wait, unbiased, unprompted! 
 						- Bid me not venture on aught that could alter or end what is present! 
 						- Say not, Time flies, and occasion, that never returns, is departing! 
 						- Drive me not out, ye ill angels with fiery swords, from my Eden, 
 						- Waiting, and watching, and looking! Let love be its own inspiration! 
 						- Shall not a voice, if a voice there must be, from the airs that environ, 
 						- Yea, from the conscious heavens, without our knowledge or effort, 
 						- Break into audible words? Let love be its own inspiration! 
 					 				  				 					
##  XII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  WHEREFORE and how I am certain, I hardly can tell; but it *is* so. 
 						- She doesn't like me, Eustace; I think she never will like me. 
 						- Is it my fault, as it is my misfortune, my ways are not her ways? 
 						- Is it my fault, that my habits and modes are dissimilar wholly? 
 						- 'Tis not her fault, 'tis her nature, her virtue, to misapprehend them: 
 						- 'Tis not her fault, 'tis her beautiful nature, not even to know me. 
 						- Hopeless it seems,—yet I cannot, hopeless, determine to leave 							it: 
 						- She goes,—therefore I go; she moves,—I move, not to 							lose her. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  OH, 'tisn't manly, of course, 'tisn't manly, this method of wooing; 
 						- 'Tisn't the way very likely to win. For the woman, they tell you, 
 						- Ever prefers the audacious, the wilful, the vehement hero; 
 						- She has no heart for the timid, the sensitive soul; and for 							knowledge,— 
 						- Knowledge, O ye gods!—when did they appreciate knowledge? 
 						- Wherefore should they, either? I am sure I do not desire it. 
 						- Ah, and I feel too, Eustace, she cares not a tittle about 							me! 
 						- (Care about me, indeed! and do I really expect it?) 
 						- But my manner offends; my ways are wholly repugnant; 
 						- Every word that I utter estranges, hurts, and repels her; 
 						- Every moment of bliss that I gain, in her exquisite presence, 
 						- Slowly, surely, withdraws her, removes her, and severs her from me. 
 						- Not that I care very much!—any way, I escape from the boy's own 
 						- Folly, to which I am prone, of loving where it is easy. 
 						- Yet, after all, my Eustace, I know but little about it. 
 						- All I can say for myself, for present alike and for past, is,  						
 						- Mary Trevellyn, Eustace, is certainly worth your acquaintance. 
 						- You couldn't come, I suppose, as far as Florence, to see her? 
 					 				 				 					
##  XIV.—GEORGINA TREVELLYN TO LOUISA —

 					 						-  * * * To-morrow we're starting for Florence, 
 						- Truly rejoiced, you may guess, to escape from republican terrors; 
 						- Mr. C. and Papa to escort us; we by *vettura* 						
 						- Through Siena, and Georgy to follow and join us by Leghorn. 
 						- Then — Ah, what shall I say, my dearest? I tremble in thinking! 
 						- You will imagine my feelings,—the blending of hope and sorrow! 
 						- How can I bear to abandon Papa and Mamma and my sisters? 
 						- Dearest Louisa, indeed it is very alarming; but trust me 
 						- Ever, whatever may change, to remain your loving Georgina. 
 					 				 				 					
##  P. S. BY MARY TREVELLYN.

 					 						-  * * * "Do I like Mr. Claude any better?" 
 						- I am to tell you,—and, "Pray, is it Susan or I that attract 							him?" 
 						- This he never has told, but Georgina could certainly ask him. 
 						- All I can say for myself is, alas! that he rather repels me. 
 						- There! I think him agreeable, but also a little repulsive. 
 						- So be content, dear Louisa; for one satisfactory marriage 
 						- Surely will do in one year for the family you would establish, 
 						- Neither Susan nor I shall afford you the joy of a second. 
 					 				 				 					
##  P. S. BY GEORGINA TREVELLYN.

 					 						-  Mr. Claude, you must know, is behaving a little bit better; 
 						- He and Papa are great friends; but he really is too *shilly-shally*,— 
 						- So unlike George! Yet I hope that the matter is going on fairly. 
 						- I shall, however, get George, before he goes, to say something. 
 						- Dearest Louisa, how delightful, to bring young people together! 
 					  					 —

 				  				 					 					 						-  IS it to Florence we follow, or are we to tarry yet longer, 
 						- E'en amid clamor of arms, here in the city of old, 
 						- Seeking from clamor of arms in the Past and the Arts to be hidden, 
 						- Vainly 'mid Arts and the Past seeking our life to forget? 						
 					 					 						-  Ah, fair shadow, scarce seen, go forth! for anon he shall 							follow,— 
 						- He that beheld thee, anon, whither thou leadest, must go! 
 						- Go, and the wise, loving Muse, she also will follow and find thee! 
 						- She, should she linger in Rome, were not dissevered from 							thee! 
 					 					 [To be continued]

 				  			    			 				 				
# AMOURS DE VOYAGE.
 [Continued.]
 III.

  				 					  					 						-  YET to the wondrous St. Peter's, and yet to the solemn Rotunda, 
 						- Mingling with heroes and gods, yet to the Vatican walls, 
 						- Yet may we go, and recline, while a whole mighty world seems above us 
 						- Gathered and fixed to all time into one roofing supreme; 
 						- Yet may we, thinking on these things, exclude what is meaner around us; 
 						- Yet, at the worst of the worst, books and a chamber remain; 
 						- Yet may we think, and forget, and possess our souls in 							resistance.— 
 						- Ah, but away from the stir, shouting, and gossip of war, 
 						- Where, upon Apennine slope, with the chestnut the oak-trees immingle, 
 						- Where amid odorous copse bridle-paths wander and wind, 
 						- Where under mulberry-branches the diligent rivulet sparkles, 
 						- Or amid cotton and maize peasants their waterworks ply, 
 						- Where, over fig-tree and orange in tier upon tier still repeated, 
 						- Garden on garden upreared, balconies step to the 							sky,— 
 						- Ah, that I were, far away from the crowd and the streets of the city, 
 						- Under the vine-trellis laid, O my beloved, with thee! 
 					 				  				 					
##  I.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER,—*on 							the way to Florence.*

 					 						-  WHY doesn't Mr. Claude come with us? you ask.—We don't know. 
 						- You should know better than we. He talked of the Vatican marbles; 
 						- But I can't wholly believe that this was the actual reason,— 
 						- He was so ready before, when we asked him to come and escort us. 
 						- Certainly he is odd, my dear Miss Roper. To change so 
 						- Suddenly, just for a whim, was not quite fair to the party,— 
 						- Not quite right. I declare, I really am almost offended: 
 						- I, his great friend, as you say, have doubtless a title to be so. 
 						- Not that I greatly regret it, for dear Georgina distinctly 
 						- Wishes for nothing so much as to show her adroitness. But, oh, my 
 						- Pen will not write any more;—let us say nothing further about 							it. 
 					 					 * * * * * 

 					 						-  Yes, my dear Miss Roper, I certainly called him repulsive; 
 						- So I think him, but cannot be sure I have used the expression 
 						- Quite as your pupil should; yet he does most truly repel me. 
 						- Was it to you I made use of the word? or who was it told you? 
 						- Yes, repulsive; observe, it is but when he talks of ideas, 
 						- That he is quite unaffected, and free, and expansive, and easy; 
 						- I could pronounce him simply a cold intellectual being.— 
 						- When does he make advances?—He thinks that women should woo 							him; 
 						- Yet, if a girl should do so, would be but alarmed and disgusted. 
 						- She that should love him must look for small love in 							return,—like the ivy 
 						- On the stone wall, must expect but a rigid and niggard support, and 
 						- E'en to get that must go searching all round with her humble embraces. 								 						
 					 				 				 					
##  II.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 						Rome.*

 					 						-  TELL me, my friend, do you think that the grain would sprout in the 							furrow, 
 						- Did it not truly accept as its *summum et ultimum 							bonum* 						
 						- That mere common and may-be indifferent soil it is set in? 
 						- Would it have force to develope and open its young cotyledons, 
 						- Could it compare, and reflect, and examine one thing with another? 
 						- Would it endure to accomplish the round of its natural functions, 
 						- Were it endowed with a sense of the general scheme of existence? 
 						- While from Marseilles in the steamer we voyaged to Civita 							Vecchia, 
 						- Vexed in the squally seas as we lay by Capraja and Elba, 
 						- Standing, uplifted, alone on the heaving poop of the vessel, 
 						- Looking around on the waste of the rushing incurious billows, 
 						- "This is Nature," I said: "we are born as it were from her waters, 
 						- Over her billows that buffet and beat us, her offspring uncared-for, 
 						- Castling one single regard of a painful victorious knowledge, 
 						- Into her billows that buffet and beat us we sink and are swallowed." 
 						- This was the sense in my soul, as I swayed with the poop of the steamer; 
 						- And as unthinking I sat in the hall of the famed Ariadne, 
 						- Lo, it looked at me there from the face of a Triton in marble. 
 						- It is the simpler thought, and I can believe it the truer. 
 						- Let us not talk of growth; we are still in our Aqueous Ages. 
 					 				 				 					
##  III.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  FAREWELL, Politics, utterly! What can I do? I cannot 
 						- Fight, you know; and to talk I am wholly ashamed. And although I 
 						- Gnash my teeth when I look in your French or your English papers, 
 						- What is the good of that? Will swearing, I wonder, mend matters? 
 						- Cursing and scolding repel the assailants? No, it is idle; 
 						- No, whatever befalls, I will hide, will ignore or forget it. 
 						- Let the tail shift for itself; I will bury my head. And what's the 
 						- Roman Republic to me, or I to the Roman Republic? 
 						- Why not fight?—In the first place, I haven't so 							much as a musket. 
 						- In the next, if I had, I shouldn't know how I should use it. 
 						- In the third, just at present I'm studying ancient marbles. 
 						- In the fourth, I consider I owe my life to my country. 
 						- In the fifth,—I forget; but four good reasons are ample. 
 						- Meantime, pray, let 'em fight, and be killed. I delight in devotion. 
 						- So that I 'list not, hurrah for the glorious army of martyrs! 
 						- *Sanguis martyrum semen Ecclesiae;* though it would 							seem this 
 						- Church is indeed of the purely Invisible, Kingdom-Come kind: 
 						- Militant here on earth! Triumphant, of course, then, elsewhere! 
 						- Ah, good Heaven, but I would I were out far away from the pother! 
 					 				 				 					
##  IV.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  NOT, as we read in the words of the olden-time inspiration, 
 						- Are there two several trees in the place we are set to abide in; 
 						- But on the apex most high of the Tree of Life in the Garden, 
 						- Budding, unfolding, and falling, decaying and flowering ever, 
 						- Flowering is set and decaying the transient blossom of 							Knowledge,—  						
 						- Flowering alone, and decaying, the needless, unfruitful blossom. 
 						- Or as the cypress-spires by the fair-flowing stream Hellespontine, 
 						- Which from the mythical tomb of the godlike Protesilaus 
 						- Rose, sympathetic in grief, to his lovelorn Laodamia, 
 						- Evermore growing, and, when in their growth to the prospect attaining, 
 						- Over the low sea-banks, of the fatal Ilian city, 
 						- Withering still at the sight which still they upgrew to encounter. 
 						- Ah, but ye that extrude from the ocean your helpless faces, 
 						- Ye over stormy seas leading long and dreary processions, 
 						- Ye, too, brood of the wind, whose coming is whence we discern not, 
 						- Making your nest on the wave, and your bed on the crested billow, 
 						- Skimming rough waters, and crowding wet sands that the tide shall return 							to, 
 						- Cormorants, ducks, and gulls, fill ye my imagination! 
 						- Let us not talk of growth; we are still in our Aqueous Ages. 
 					 				 				 					
##  V.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER,—*from Florence.*

 					 						-  DEAREST MISS ROPER,—Alas, we are all at Florence quite safe, 							and 
 						- You, we hear, are shut up! indeed, it is sadly distressing! 
 						- We were most lucky, they say, to get off when we did from the troubles. 
 						- Now you are really besieged! They tell us it soon will be over; 
 						- Only I hope and trust without any fight in the city. 
 						- Do you see Mr. Claude?—I thought he might do something for you. 
 						- I am quite sure on occasion he really would wish to be useful. 
 						- What is he doing? I wonder;—still studying Vatican marbles? 
 						- Letters, I hope, pass through. We trust your brother is better. 
 					 				 				 					
##  VI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  JUXTAPOSITION, in fine; and what is juxtaposition? 
 						- Look you, we travel along in the railway-carriage, or steamer, 
 						- And, *pour passer le temps*, till the tedious 							journey be ended, 
 						- Lay aside paper or book, to talk with the girl that is next one; 
 						- And, *pour passer le temps*, with the terminus all 							but in prospect, 
 						- Talk of eternal ties and marriages made in heaven. 
 						- Ah, did we really accept with a perfect heart the illusion! 
 						- Ah, did we really believe that the Present indeed is the Only! 
 						- Or through all transmutation, all shock and convulsion of passion, 
 						- Feel we could carry undimmed, unextinguished, the light of our knowledge! 
 						- But for his funeral train which the bridegroom sees in the 							distance, 
 						- Would he so joyfully, think you, fall in with the marriage-procession? 
 						- But for that final discharge, would he dare to enlist in that service? 
 						- But for that certain release, ever sign to that perilous contract? 
 						- But for that exit secure, ever bend to that treacherous 							doorway?— 
 						- Ah, but the bride, meantime,—do you think she sees it as he 							does? 
 						- But for the steady fore-sense of a freer and larger 							existence, 
 						- Think you that man could consent to be circumscribed here into action? 
 						- But for assurance within of a limitless ocean divine, o'er 
 						- Whose great tranquil depths unconscious the wind-tost surface 
 						- Breaks into ripples of trouble that come and change and endure 							not,— 
 						- But that in this, of a truth, we have our being, and know it, 
 						- Think you we men could submit to live and move as we do here? 
 						- Ah, but the women,—God bless them!—they don't think 							at all about it.  						
 						- Yet we must eat and drink, as you say. And as limited 							beings 
 						- Scarcely can hope to attain upon earth to an Actual Abstract, 
 						- Leaving to God contemplation, to His hands knowledge confiding, 
 						- Sure that in us if it perish, in Him it abideth and dies not, 
 						- Let us in His sight accomplish our petty particular doings,— 
 						- Yes, and contented sit down to the victual that He has provided. 
 						- Allah is great, no doubt, and Juxtaposition his prophet. 
 						- Ah, but the women, alas, they don't look at it in that way! 
 						- Juxtaposition is great;—but, my friend, I fear 							me, the maiden 
 						- Hardly would thank or acknowledge the lover that sought to obtain her, 
 						- Not as the thing he would wish, but the thing he must even put up 							with,— 
 						- Hardly would tender her hand to the wooer that candidly told her 
 						- That she is but for a space, an *ad-interim* solace 							and pleasure,— 
 						- That in the end she shall yield to a perfect and absolute something, 
 						- Which I then for myself shall behold, and not another,— 
 						- Which, amid fondest endearments, meantime I forget not, forsake not. 
 						- Ah, ye feminine souls, so loving and so exacting, 
 						- Since we cannot escape, must we even submit to deceive you? 
 						- Since, so cruel is truth, sincerity shocks and revolts you, 
 						- Will you have us your slaves to lie to you, flatter and—leave 							you? 
 					 				 				 					
##  VII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						- JUXTAPOSITION is great,—but, you tell me, affinity greater. 
 						- Ah, my friend, there are many affinities, greater and lesser, 
 						- Stronger and weaker; and each, by the favor of juxtaposition, 
 						- Potent, efficient, in force,—for a time; but none, let me tell 							you, 
 						- Save by the law of the land and the ruinous force of the will, ah, 
 						- None, I fear me, at last quite sure to be final and perfect. 
 						- Lo, as I pace in the street, from the peasant-girl to the 							princess, 
 						-  							 								*Homo sum, nihil humani a me alienum 									puto,—* 							 						
 						-  								*Vir sum, nihil foeminei* 							,—and e'en to the uttermost circle, 
 						- All that is Nature's is I, and I all things that are Nature's. 
 						- Yes, as I walk, I behold, in a luminous, large intuition, 
 						- That I can be and become anything that I meet with or look at: 
 						- I am the ox in the dray, the ass with the garden-stuff panniers; 
 						- I am the dog in the doorway, the kitten that plays in the window, 
 						- Here on the stones of the ruin the furtive and fugitive lizard, 
 						- Swallow above me that twitters, and fly that is buzzing about me; 
 						- Yea, and detect, as I go, by a faint, but a faithful assurance, 
 						- E'en from the stones of the street, as from rocks or trees of the forest, 
 						- Something of kindred, a common, though latent vitality, greet me, 
 						- And, to escape from our strivings, mistakings, misgrowths, and 							perversions, 
 						- Fain could demand to return to that perfect and primitive silence, 
 						- Fain be enfolded and fixed, as of old, in their rigid embraces. 
 					 				 				 					
##  VIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  AND as I walk on my way, I behold them consorting and coupling; 
 						- Faithful it seemeth, and fond, very fond, very probably faithful; 
 						- And I proceed on my way with a pleasure sincere and unmingled. 
 						- Life is beautiful, Eustace, entrancing, enchanting to look 							at;  						
 						- As are the streets of a city we pace while the carriage is changing, 
 						- As is a chamber filled-in with harmonious, exquisite pictures, 
 						- Even so beautiful Earth; and could we eliminate only 
 						- This vile hungering impulse, this demon within us of craving, 
 						- Life were beautiful, living a perfect divine satisfaction. 
 					 				 				 					
##  IX.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  							*Mild monastic faces in quiet collegiate 							cloisters*: 
 						- So let me offer a single and celibatarian phrase a 
 						- Tribute to those whom perhaps you do not believe I can honor. 
 						- But, from the tumult escaping, 'tis pleasant, of drumming and shouting, 
 						- Hither, oblivious awhile, to withdraw, of the fact or the falsehood, 
 						- And amid placid regards and mildly courteous greetings 
 						- Yield to the calm and composure and gentle abstraction that reign o'er 
 						- *Mild monastic faces in quiet collegiate cloisters*. 
 						- Terrible word, Obligation! You should not, Eustace, you 							should not, 
 						- No, you should not have used it. But, O great Heavens, I repel it! 
 						- Oh, I cancel, reject, disavow, and repudiate wholly 
 						- Every debt in this kind, disclaim every claim, and dishonor, 
 						- Yea, my own heart's own writing, my soul's own signature! Ah, no! 
 						- I will be free in this; you shall not, none shall, bind me. 
 						- No, my friend, if you wish to be told, it was this above all things, 
 						- This that charmed me, ah, yes, even this, that she held me to nothing. 
 						- No, I could talk as I pleased; come close; fasten ties, as I fancied; 
 						- Bind and engage myself deep;—and lo, on the following morning 
 						- It was all e'en as before, like losings in games played for nothing. 
 						- Yes, when I came, with mean fears in my soul, with a semi-performance 
 						- At the first step breaking down in its pitiful role of evasion, 
 						- When to shuffle I came, to compromise, not meet, engagements, 
 						- Lo, with her calm eyes there she met me and knew nothing of 							it,— 
 						- Stood unexpecting, unconscious. *She* spoke not of 							obligations, 
 						- Knew not of debt,—ah, no, I believe you, for excellent reasons. 						
 					 				 				 					
##  X.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

  					 						-  HANG this thinking, at last! what good is it? oh, and what evil! 
 						- Oh, what mischief and pain! like a clock in a sick man's chamber, 
 						- Ticking and ticking, and still through each covert of slumber pursuing. 
 						- What shall I do to thee, O thou Preserver of Men? Have 							compassion! 
 						- Be favorable, and hear! Take from me this regal knowledge! 
 						- Let me, contented and mute, with the beasts of the field, my brothers, 
 						- Tranquilly, happily lie,—and eat grass, like Nebuchadnezzar! 						
 					 				 				 					
##  XI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  TIBUR is beautiful, too, and the orchard slopes, and the Anio 
 						- Falling, falling, yet, to the ancient lyrical cadence; 
 						- Tibur and Anio's tide; and cool from Lucretilis ever, 
 						- With the Digentian stream, and with the Bandusian fountain, 
 						- Folded in Sabine recesses, the valley and villa of Horace:— 
 						- So not seeing I sung; so seeing and listening say I,  						
 						- Here as I sit by the stream, as I gaze at the cell of the Sibyl, 
 						- Here with Albunea's home and the grove of Tiburnus beside me.* 
 						- Tivoli beautiful is, and musical, O Teverone, 
 						- Dashing from mountain to plain, thy parted impetuous waters! 
 						- Tivolli's waters and rocks; and fair under Monte Gennaro, 
 						- (Haunt even yet, I must think, as I wonder and gaze, of the shadows, 
 						- Faded and pale, yet immortal, of Faunus, the Nymphs, and the Graces,) 
 						- Fair in itself, and yet fairer with human completing creations, 
 						- Folded in Sabine recesses the valley and villa of Horace:— 
 						- So not seeing I sung; so now,—nor seeing, nor hearing, 
 						- Neither by waterfall lulled, nor folded in sylvan embraces, 
 						- Neither by cell of the Sibyl, not stepping the Monte Gennaro, 
 						- Seated on Anio's bank, nor sipping Bandusian waters, 
 						- But on Montorio's height, looking down on the tile-clad streets, the 
 						- Cupolas, crosses, and domes, the bushes and kitchen-gardens, 
 						- Which, by the grace of the Tiber, proclaim themselves Rome of the 							Romans,— 
 						- But on Montorio's height, looking forth to the vapory mountains, 
 						- Cheating the prisoner Hope with illusions of vision and fancy,— 
 						- But on Montorio's height, with these weary soldiers by me, 
 						- Waiting till Oudinot enter, to reinstate Pope and Tourist. 
 					 					 						-  							 *—domus Albuneae resonantis,  						
 						-  							Et praeceps Anio, et Tiburni lucus, et uda  						
 						-  							Mobilibus pomaria rivis.  						
 					 				 				 					
##  XII.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER.

 					 						-  DEAR MISS ROPER,—It seems, George Vernon, before we left Rome, 							said 
 						- Something to Mr. Claude about what they call his attentions. 
 						- Susan, two nights ago, for the first time, heard this from Georgina. 
 						- It is *so* disagreeable, and *so* annoying, to think of! 
 						- If it could only be known, though we never may meet him again, that 
 						- It was all George's doing and we were entirely unconscious, 
 						- It would extremely relieve—Your ever affectionate Mary. 
 					 					 						
## P.S.(1).

 						-  Here is your letter arrived this moment, just as I wanted. 
 						- So you have seen him,—indeed,—and 							guessed,—how dreadfully clever! 
 						- What did he really say? and what was your answer exactly? 
 						- Charming!—but wait for a moment, I have not read through the 							letter. 
 					 					 						
## P.S.(2)

 						-  Ah, my dearest Miss Roper, do just as you fancy about it. 
 						- If you think it sincerer to tell him I know of it, do so. 
 						- Though I should most extremely dislike it, I know I could manage. 
 						- It is the simplest thing, but surely wholly uncalled for. 
 						- Do as you please; you know I trust implicitly to you. 
 						- Say whatever is right and needful for ending the matter. 
 						- Only don't tell Mr. Claude, what I will tell you as a secret, 
 						- That I should like very well to show him myself I forget it. 
 					 					 						
## P.S.(3)

 						-  I am to say that the wedding is finally settled for 							Tuesday. 
 						- Ah, my dear Miss Roper, you surely, surely can manage  						
 						- Not to let it appear that I know of that odious matter. 
 						- It would be pleasanter far for myself to treat it exactly 
 						- As if it had not occurred; and I do not think he would like it. 
 						- I must remember to add, that as soon as the wedding is over 
 						- We shall be off, I believe, in a hurry, and travel to Milan, 
 						- There to meet friends of Papa's, I am told, at the Croce di Malta; 
 						- Then I cannot say whither, but not at present to England. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  YES, on Montorio's height for a last farewell of the 							city,— 
 						- So it appears; though then I was quite uncertain about it. 
 						- So, however, it was. And now to explain the proceeding. 
 						- I was to go, as I told you, I think, with the people to 							Florence. 
 						- Only the day before, the foolish family Vernon 
 						- Made some uneasy remarks, as we walked to our lodging together, 
 						- As to intentions, forsooth, and so forth. I was astounded, 
 						- Horrified quite; and obtaining just then, as it chanced, an offer 
 						- (No common favor) of seeing the great Ludovisi collection, 
 						- Why, I made this a pretence, and wrote that they must excuse me. 
 						- How could I go? Great Heaven! to conduct a permitted flirtation 
 						- Under those vulgar eyes, the observed of such observers! 
 						- Well, but I now, by a series of fine diplomatic inquiries, 
 						- Find from a sort of relation, a good and sensible woman, 
 						- Who is remaining at Rome with a brother too ill for removal, 
 						- That it was wholly unsanctioned, unknown,—not, I think, by 							Georgina: 
 						- She, however, ere this,—and that is the best of the 							story,— 
 						- She and the Vernon, thank Heaven, are wedded and 							gone—honey-mooning. 
 						- So—on Montorio's height for a last farewell of the city. 
 						- Tibur I have not seen, nor the lakes that of old I had dreamt of; 
 						- Tibur I shall not see, nor Anio's waters, nor deep en-
 						- Folded in Sabine recesses the valley and villa of Horace; 
 						- Tibur I shall not see;—but something better I shall see. 
 						- Twice I have tried before, and failed in getting the 							horses; 
 						- Twice I have tried and failed: this time it shall not be a failure. 
 					 					 —

 				 				 					  					 						-  THEREFORE farewell, ye hills, and ye, ye envineyarded ruins! 
 						- Therefore farewell, ye walls, palaces, pillars, and domes! 
 						- Therefore farewell, far seen, ye peaks of the mythic Albano, 
 						- Seen from Montorio's height, Tibur and AEsula's hills! 
 						- Ah, could we once, ere we go, could we stand, while, to ocean descending, 
 						- Sinks o'er the yellow dark plain slowly the yellow broad 							sun, 
 						- Stand, from the forest emerging at sunset, at once in the champaign, 
 						- Open, but studded with trees, chestnuts umbrageous and old, 
 						- E'en in those fair open fields that incurve to thy beautiful hollow, 
 						- Nemi, imbedded in wood, Nemi, inurned in the 							hill!— 
 						- Therefore farewell, ye plains, and ye hills, and the City Eternal! 
 						- Therefore farewell! We depart, but to behold you again! 						
 					 					 [To be continued]

 				 			   			 				 				
#  					AMOURS DE VOYAGE.
 [Concluded.]
 IV.

  				 					  					 						-  EASTWARD, or Northward, or West? I wander, and ask as I wander, 
 						- Weary, yet eager and sure, Where shall I come to my love? 
 						- Whitherward hasten to seek her? Ye daughters of Italy, tell me, 
 						- Graceful and tender and dark, is she consorting with you? 
 						- Thou that out-climbest the torrent, that tendest thy goats to the summit, 
 						- Call to me, child of the Alp, has she been seen on the 							heights? 
 						- Italy, farewell I bid thee! for, whither she leads me, I follow. 
 						- Farewell the vineyard! for I, where I but guess her, must 							go. 
 						- Weariness welcome, and labor, wherever it be, if at last it 
 						- Bring me in mountain or plain into the sight of my love. 						
 					 				  				 					
##  I.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 							Florence.*

 					 						-  GONE from Florence; indeed; and that is truly provoking;— 
 						- Gone to Milan, it seems; then I go also to Milan. 
 						- Five days now departed; but they can travel but slowly;— 
 						- I quicker far; and I know, as it happens, the house they will go 							to.— 
 						- Why, what else should I do? Stay here and look at the pictures, 
 						- Statues, and churches? Alack, I am sick of the statues and 							pictures!— 
 						- No, to Bologna, Parma, Piacenza, Lodi, and Milan, 
 						- Off go we to-night,—and the Venus go to the Devil! 
 					 				  				 					
##  II.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 							Bellaggio.*

 					 						-  GONE to Como, they said; and I have posted to Como. 
 						- There was a letter left, but the *cameriere* had 							lost it. 
 						- Could it have been for me? They came, however, to Como, 
 						- And from Como went by the boat,—perhaps to the 							Splugen,— 
 						- Or to the Stelvio, say, and the Tyrol; also it might be 
 						- By Porlezza across to Lugano, and so to the Simplon 
 						- Possibly, or the St. Gothard,—or possibly, too, to Baveno, 
 						- Orta, Turin, and elsewhere. Indeed, I am greatly bewildered. 
 					 				 				 					
##  III.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 							Bellaggio.*

  					 						-  I HAVE been up the Splugen, and on the Stelvio also: 
 						- Neither of these can I find they have followed; in no one inn, and 
 						- This would be odd, have they written their names. I have been to 							Porlezza. 
 						- There they have not been seen, and therefore not at Lugano. 
 						- What shall I do? Go on through the Tyrol, Switzerland, Deutschland, 
 						- Seeking, an inverse Saul, a kingdom, to find only asses? 
 						- There is a tide, at least in the *love* affairs of mortals, 
 						- Which, when taken at flood, leads on to the happiest fortune,— 
 						- Leads to the marriage-morn and the orange-flowers and the altar,  						
 						- And the long lawful line of crowned joys to crowned joys 							succeeding.— 
 						- Ah, it has ebbed with me! Ye gods, and when it was flowing, 
 						- Pitiful fool that I was, to stand fiddle-faddling in that way! 
 					 				 				 					
##  IV.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 							Bellaggio.*

 					 						-  I HAVE returned and found their names in the book at Como. 
 						- Certain it is I was right, and yet I am also in error. 
 						- Added in feminine hand, I read, *By the boat to 								Bellaggio*.— 
 						- So to Bellaggio again, with the words of her writing, to aid me. 
 						- Yet at Bellaggio I find no trace, no sort of remembrance. 
 						- So I am here, and wait, and know every hour will remove them. 
 					 				 				 					
##  V.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 							Bellaggio.*

 					 						-  I HAVE but one chance left,—and that is, going to Florence. 
 						- But it is cruel to turn. The mountains seem to demand me,— 
 						- Peak and valley from far to beckon and motion me onward. 
 						- Somewhere amid their folds she passes whom fain I would follow; 
 						- Somewhere among those heights she haply calls me to seek her. 
 						- Ah, could I hear her call! could I catch the glimpse of her raiment! 
 						- Turn, however, I must, though it seem I turn to desert her; 
 						- For the sense of the thing is simply to hurry to Florence, 
 						- Where the certainty yet may be learnt, I suppose, from the Ropers 
 					 				 				 					
##  VI.—MARY TREVELLYN, *from Lucerne*, TO 						MISS ROPER, *at Florence.*

 					 						-  DEAR MISS ROPER,—By this you are safely away, we are hoping, 
 						- Many a league from Rome; ere long we trust we shall see you. 
 						- How have you travelled? I wonder;—was Mr. Claude your 							companion? 
 						- As for ourselves, we went from Como straight to Lugano; 
 						- So by the Mount St. Gothard;—we meant to go by Porlezza, 
 						- Taking the steamer, and stopping, as you had advised, at Bellaggio, 
 						- Two or three days or more; but this was suddenly altered, 
 						- After we left the hotel, on the very way to the steamer. 
 						- So we have seen, I fear, not one of the lakes in perfection. 
 						- Well, he is not come; and now, I suppose, he will not come. 
 						- What will you think, meantime?—and yet I must really confess 							it;— 
 						- What will you say? I wrote him a note. We left in a hurry, 
 						- Went from Milan to Como three days before we expected. 
 						- But I thought, if he came all the way to Milan, he really 
 						- Ought not to be disappointed; and so I wrote three lines to 
 						- Say I had heard he was coming, desirous of joining our party;— 
 						- If so, then I said, we had started for Como, and meant to 
 						- Cross the St. Gothard, and stay, we believed, at Lucerne, for the summer. 
 						- Was it wrong? and why, if it was, has it failed to bring him? 
 						- Did he not think it worth while to come to Milan? He knew (you 
 						- Told him) the house we should go to. Or may it, perhaps, have miscarried? 
 						- Any way, now, I repent, and am heartily vexed that I wrote it  						
 					 					 —

 				 				 					  					 						-  THERE is a home on the shore of the Alpine sea, that upswelling 
 						- High up the mountain-sides spreads in the hollow between; 
 						- Wilderness, mountain, and snow from the land of the olive conceal it; 
 						- Under Pilatus's hill low by its river it lies: 
 						- Italy, utter one word, and the olive and vine will allure not,— 
 						- Wilderness, forest, and snow will not the passage impede; 
 						- Italy, unto thy cities receding, the clue to recover, 
 						- Hither, recovered the clue, shall not the traveller haste? 						
 					 					 —

 				 			  			 				
# V.

  				 					  					 						-  THERE is a city, upbuilt on the quays of the turbulent Arno, 
 						- Under Fiesole's heights,—thither are we to 							return? 
 						- There is a city that fringes the curve of the inflowing waters, 
 						- Under the perilous hill fringes the beautiful 							bay,— 
 						- Parthenope do they call thee?—the Siren, Neapolis, seated 
 						- Under Vesevus's hill,—thither are we to 							proceed?— 
 						- Sicily, Greece, will invite, and the Orient;—or are we to turn 							to 
 						- England, which may after all be for its children the best? 						
 					 				 				 					
##  I.—MARY TREVELLYN, *at Lucerne*, TO MISS 						ROPER, *at Florence.*

 					 						-  SO you are really free, and living in quiet at Florence; 
 						- That is delightful news;—you travelled slowly and safely 
 						- Mr. Claude got you out; took rooms at Florence before you; 
 						- Wrote from Milan to say so; had left directly for Milan, 
 						- Hoping to find us soon;—*if he could, he 								would, you are certain*.— 
 						- Dear Miss Roper, your letter has made me exceedingly happy. 
 						- You are quite sure, you say, he asked you about our 							intentions; 
 						- You had not heard of Lucerne as yet, but told him of Como.— 
 						- Well, perhaps he will come;—however, I will not expect it. 
 						- Though you say you are sure,—if he can, he will, *you are certain*. 
 						- O my dear, many thanks from your ever affectionate Mary. 
 					 				 				 					
##  II.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.


 					Florence.

 					 						-  							*Action will furnish belief*,—but will 							that belief be the true one? 
 						- This is the point, you know. However, it doesn't much matter 
 						- What one wants, I suppose, is to predetermine the action, 
 						- So as to make it entail, not a chance-belief, but the true one. 
 						- *Out of the question*, you say, *if 								a thing isn't wrong, we may do it*. 
 						- Ah! but this *wrong*, you see;—but I do 							not know that it matters. 
 						- Eustace, the Ropers are gone, and no one can tell me about 							them. 
 					 					Pisa.

 					 						-  Pisa, they say they think; and so I follow to Pisa, 
 						- Hither and thither inquiring. I weary of making inquiries; 
 						- I am ashamed, I declare, of asking people about it.— 
 						- Who are your friends? You said you had friends who would certainly know 							them.  						
 						- But it is idle, moping, and thinking, and trying to fix her 
 						- Image more and more in, to write the old perfect inscription 
 						- Over and over again upon every page of remembrance. 
 						- I have settled to stay at Florence to wait for your answer. 
 						- Who are your friends? Write quickly and tell me. I wait for your answer. 						
 					 				 				 					
##  III.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER, *at Lucca 							Baths.*

 					 						-  YOU are at Lucca Baths, you tell me, to stay for the summer; 
 						- Florence was quite too hot; you can't move further at present. 
 						- Will you not come, do you think, before the summer is over? 
 						- Mr. C. got you out with very considerable trouble; 
 						- And he was useful and kind, and seemed so happy to serve you; 
 						- Didn't stay with you long, but talked very openly to you; 
 						- Made you almost his confessor, without appearing to know it,— 
 						- What about?—and you say you didn't need his confessions. 
 						- Will he come, do you think? I am really so sorry for him! 
 						- They didn't give him my letter at Milan, I feel pretty certain. 
 						- You had told him Bellaggio. We didn't go to Bellaggio; 
 						- So he would miss our track, and perhaps never come to Lugano, 
 						- Where we were written in full, *To Lucerne, across the 								St. Gothard*. 
 						- But he could write to you;—you would tell him where you were 							going. 
 					 				 				 					
##  IV.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  LET me, then, bear to forget her. I will not cling to her falsely; 
 						- Nothing factitious or forced shall impair the old happy relation. 
 						- I will let myself go, forget, not try to remember; 
 						- I will walk on my way, accept the chances that meet me, 
 						- Freely encounter the world, imbibe these alien airs, and 
 						- Never ask if new feelings and thoughts are of her or of others. 
 						- Is she not changing, herself?—the old image would only delude 							me. 
 						- I will be bold, too, and change,—if it must be. Yet if in all 							things, 
 						- Yet if I do but aspire evermore to the Absolute only, 
 						- I shall be doing, I think, somehow, what she will be doing;— 
 						- I shall be thine, O my child, some way, though I know not in what way. 
 						- Let me submit to forget her; I must; I already forget her. 
 					 				 				 					
##  V.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  UTTERLY vain is, alas, this attempt at the Absolute,—wholly! 
 						- I, who believed not in her, because I would fain believe nothing, 
 						- Have to believe as I may, with a wilful, unmeaning acceptance. 
 						- I, who refused to enfasten the roots of my floating existence 
 						- In the rich earth, cling now to the hard, naked rock that is left 							me.— 
 						- Ah! she was worthy, Eustace,—and that, indeed, is my 							comfort,— 
 						- Worthy a nobler heart than a fool such as I could have given. 
 					 					  				 				 					
##  VI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  YES, it relieves me to write, though I do not send; and the chance that 
 						- Takes may destroy my fragments. But as men pray, without asking 
 						- Whether One really exist to hear or do anything for them,— 
 						- Simply impelled by the need of the moment to turn to a Being 
 						- In a conception of whom there is freedom from all limitation,— 
 						- So in your image I turn to an *ens rationis* of 							friendship. 
 						- Even to write in your name I know not to whom nor in what wise. 
 					 				  				 					
##  VII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  THERE was a time, methought it was but lately departed, 
 						- When, if a thing was denied me, I felt I was bound to attempt it; 
 						- Choice alone should take, and choice alone should surrender. 
 						- There was a time, indeed, when I had not retired thus early, 
 						- Languidly thus, from pursuit of a purpose I once had adopted. 
 						- But it is over, all that! I have slunk from the perilous field in 
 						- Whose wild struggle of forces the prizes of life are contested. 
 						- It is over, all that! I am a coward, and know it. 
 						- Courage in me could be only factitious, unnatural, useless. 
 					 				 				 					
##  VIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  ROME is fallen, I hear, the gallant Medici taken, 
 						- Noble Manara slain, and Garibaldi has lost *il 							Moro*;— 
 						- Rome is fallen; and fallen, or falling, heroical Venice. 
 						- I, meanwhile, for the loss of a single small chit of a girl, sit 
 						- Moping and mourning here,—for her, and myself much smaller. 
 						- Whither depart the souls of the brave that die in the 							battle, 
 						- Die in the lost, lost fight, for the cause that perishes with them? 
 						- Are they upborne from the field on the slumberous pinions of angels 
 						- Unto a far-off home, where the weary rest from their labor, 
 						- And the deep wounds are healed, and the bitter and burning moisture 
 						- Wiped from the generous eyes? or do they linger, unhappy, 
 						- Pining, and haunting the grave of their by-gone hope and endeavor? 
 						- All declamation, alas! though I talk, I care not for Rome, 							nor 
 						- Italy; feebly and faintly, and but with the lips, can lament the 
 						- Wreck of the Lombard youth and the victory of the oppressor. 
 						- Whither depart the brave?—God knows; I certainly do not. 
 					 				 				 					
##  IX.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER.

 					 						-  HE has not come as yet; and now I must not expect it. 
 						- You have written, you say, to friends at Florence, to see him, 
 						- If he perhaps should return;—but that is surely unlikely. 
 						- Has he not written to you?—he did not know your direction. 
 						- Oh, how strange never once to have told him where you were going! 
 						- Yet if he only wrote to Florence, that would have reached you. 
 						- If what you say he said was true, why has he not done so? 
 						- Is he gone back to Rome, do you think, to his Vatican marbles?— 
 						- O my dear Miss Roper, forgive me! do not be angry!— 
 						- You have written to Florence;—your friends would certainly find 							him.  						
 						- Might you not write to him?—but yet it is so little likely! 
 						- I shall expect nothing more.—Ever yours, your affectionate 							Mary. 
 					 				 				 					
##  X.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  I CANNOT stay at Florence, not even to wait for a letter. 
 						- Galleries only oppress me. Remembrance of hope I had cherished 
 						- (Almost more than as hope, when I passed through Florence the first time) 
 						- Lies like a sword in my soul. I am more a coward than ever, 
 						- Chicken-hearted, past thought. The *caffes* and 							waiters distress me. 
 						- All is unkind, and, alas, I am ready for any one's kindness. 
 						- Oh, I knew it of old, and knew it, I thought, to perfection, 
 						- If there is any one thing in the world to preclude all kindness, 
 						- It is the need of it,—it is this sad self-defeating dependence. 
 						- Why is this, Eustace? Myself, were I stronger, I think I could tell you. 
 						- But it is odd when it comes. So plumb I the deeps of depression, 
 						- Daily in deeper, and find no support, no will, no purpose. 
 						- All my old strengths are gone. And yet I shall have to do something. 
 						- Ah, the key of our life, that passes all wards, opens all locks, 
 						- Is not *I will*, but *I must*. 							I must,—I must,—and I do it. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XI.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  AT the last moment I have your letter, for which I was waiting. 
 						- I have taken my place, and see no good in inquiries. 
 						- Do nothing more, good Eustace, I pray you. It only will vex me. 
 						- Take no measures. Indeed, should we meet, I could not be certain; 
 						- All might be changed, you know. Or perhaps there was nothing to be 							changed. 
 						- It is a curious history, this; and yet I foresaw it; 
 						- I could have told it before. The Fates, it is clear, are against us; 
 						- For it is certain enough that I met with the people you mention; 
 						- They were at Florence the day I returned there, and spoke to me even; 
 						- Staid a week, saw me often; departed, and whither I know not. 
 						- Great is Fate, and is best. I believe in Providence, partly. 
 						- What is ordained is right, and all that happens is ordered. 
 						- Ah, no, that isn't it. But yet I retain my conclusion: 
 						- I will go where I am led, and will not dictate to the chances. 
 						- Do nothing more, I beg. If you love me, forbear interfering. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.

 					 						-  SHALL we come out of it all, some day, as one does from a tunnel? 
 						- Will it be all at once, without our doing or asking, 
 						- We shall behold clear day, the trees and meadows about us, 
 						- And the faces of friends, and the eyes we loved looking at us? 
 						- Who knows? Who can say? It will not do to suppose it. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XIII.—CLAUDE TO EUSTACE,—*from 						Rome.*

 					 						-  ROME will not suit me, Eustace; the priests and soldiers possess it; 
 						- Priests and soldiers;—and, ah! which is worst, the priest or 							the soldier? 
 						- Politics farewell, however! For what could I do? with 							inquiring,  						
 						- Talking, collating the journals, go fever my brain about things o'er 
 						- Which I can have no control. No, happen whatever may happen, 
 						- Time, I suppose, will subsist; the earth will revolve on its axis; 
 						- People will travel; the stranger will wander as now in the city; 
 						- Rome will be here, and the Pope the *custode* of 							Vatican marbles. 
 						- I have no heart, however, for any marble or fresco; 
 						- I have essayed it in vain; 'tis vain as yet to essay it: 
 						- But I may haply resume some day my studies in this kind. 
 						- Not as the Scripture says, is, I think, the fact. Ere our 							death-day, 
 						- Faith, I think, does pass, and Love; but Knowledge abideth. 
 						- Let us seek Knowledge;—the rest must come and go as it happens. 
 						- Knowledge is hard to seek, and harder yet to adhere to. 
 						- Knowledge is painful often; and yet when we know, we are happy. 
 						- Seek it, and leave mere Faith and Love to come with the chances. 
 						- As for Hope,—to-morrow I hope to be starting for Naples. 
 						- Rome will not do, I see, for many very good reasons. 
 						- Eastward, then, I suppose, with the coming of winter, to Egypt. 
 					 				 				 					
##  XIV.—MARY TREVELLYN TO MISS ROPER.

 					 						-  YOU have heard nothing; of course, I know you can have heard nothing. 
 						- Ah, well, more than once I have broken my purpose, and sometimes, 
 						- Only too often, have looked for the little lake-steamer to bring him. 
 						- But it is only fancy,—I do not really expect it. 
 						- Oh, and you see I know so exactly how he would take it: 
 						- Finding the chances prevail against meeting again, he would banish 
 						- Forthwith every thought of the poor little possible hope, which 
 						- I myself could not help, perhaps, thinking only too much of; 
 						- He would resign himself, and go. I see it exactly. 
 						- So I also submit, although in a different manner. 
 						- Can you not really come? We go very shortly to England. 						
 					 					 —

 				 				 					  					 						-  So go forth to the world, to the good report and the evil! 
 						- Go, little book! thy tale, is it not evil and good? 
 						- Go, and if strangers revile, pass quietly by without answer. 
 						- Go, and if curious friends ask of thy rearing and age, 
 						- Say, *I am flitting about many years from brain unto 								brain of* 						
 						-  							*Feeble and restless youths born to inglorious 							days;* 						
 						- *But*, so finish the word, *I was 								writ in a Roman chamber,* 						
 						- *When from Janiculum heights thundered the 								cannon of France*.
