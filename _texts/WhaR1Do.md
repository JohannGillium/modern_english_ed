# *The Decoration of Houses*.  By Edith Wharton and Ogden        Codman, Jr. Charles Scribner's Sons.  1897.

   One opens a new book on decoration with a weary anticipation,   remembering how much has been lately written on the subject for   Americans, and to how little purpose; but now the whole style and   practice of decoration has changed, and the teaching of the last   generation has become obsolete.  'The Decoration of Houses,' a   handsome, interesting, and well-written book, not only is an   example of the recent reversion to quasi-classic styles and   methods, but signalizes the complete reaction that has thrown to   the winds, even before the public discovered it, perhaps, the   lately accepted doctrine of constructive virtue, sincerity, and the   beauty of use.  The authors take the new ground uncompromisingly,   snap their fingers at sincerity, have no horror of shams, and stand   simply on proportion, harmony of lines, and other architectural   qualities.  "Any *trompe-d'oeil* is permissible in decorative   design," they say, "if it gives an impression of pleasure."  To   this have we already come; yet it seems not to have produced   harmony between the outside and the inside of their volume.   

The thread of their discussion is historical.  Its fifty   illustrations, taken from Italian, French, and English interiors,   with a somewhat omnivorous appetite, are of various interest; but   the book is the fruit of study, and of a larger knowledge of   examples than has commonly been the case with its predecessors.  It   is aimed, not at professional readers, but at the public, whom it   instructs with many intelligent criticisms and sensible directions,   calling their attention to artistic aspects of decoration which   have been neglected by writers of the last dispensation.  It   touches the root of present difficulty when it says, in the   preface, that "the vulgarity of current decoration has its source   in the indifference of the wealthy to architectural fitness."  But,   to the authors, architectural fitness means agreeable proportions   and combination of lines, and no more.   

The temptation of the literature that we have left behind was   that any ready-witted writer could discourse magisterially about   decoration; and, inasmuch as his material was pure theory, it   called for neither experience nor knowledge, nor yet for artistic   or technical acquirement; in truth, after the beginning, the   writers were mainly literary men and amateurs.  Nevertheless there   were valuable truths in their writings, and principles which, under   due limitation, should have infused freshness, vitality, and   manliness into decorative work.  If these have been forgotten   before they have borne their due fruit, the fault may have been in   the narrowness, vehemence, and want of technical enlightenment with   which they were urged.  But whether we are morally wise, or   historically, the things we need for decorative work are taste and   instinct for formâ€”qualities which still wait their development   among Americans.  Till these are evolved, we must either intrust   ourselves to professional hands, or be left to vibrate between the   dicta of dilettanti on the one hand and doctrinaires on the other.
