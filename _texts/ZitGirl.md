# THE SCHOOL DAYS OF AN INDIAN GIRL.
 *Atlantic Monthly* 85 (1900): 185-94.

     
#  THE LAND OF RED APPLES.

   THERE were eight in our party of bronzed children who were  going East with the missionaries.  Among us were three young  braves, two tall girls, and we three little ones, Judewin, Thowin,  and I.  

We had been very impatient to start on our journey to the Red  Apple Country, which, we were told, lay a little beyond the great  circular horizon of the Western prairie.  Under a sky of rosy  apples we dreamt of roaming as freely and happily as we had chased  the cloud shadows on the Dakota plains.  We had anticipated much  pleasure from a ride on the iron horse, but the throngs of staring  palefaces disturbed and troubled us.  

On the train, fair women, with tottering babies on each arm,  stopped their haste and scrutinized the children of absent mothers.   Large men, with heavy bundles in their hands, halted near by, and  riveted their glassy blue eyes upon us.  

I sank deep into the corner of my seat, for I resented being  watched.  Directly in front of me, children who were no larger than  I hung themselves upon the backs of their seats, with their bold  white faces toward me.  Sometimes they took their forefingers out  of their mouths and pointed at my moccasined feet.  Their mothers,  instead of reproving such rude curiosity, looked closely at me, and  attracted their children's further notice to my blanket.  This  embarrassed me, and kept me constantly on the verge of tears.  

I sat perfectly still, with my eyes downcast, daring only now  and then to shoot long glances around me.  Chancing to turn to the  window at my side, I was quite breathless upon seeing one familiar  object.  It was the telegraph pole which strode by at short paces.   Very near my mother's dwelling, along the edge of a road thickly  bordered with wild sunflowers, some poles like these had been  planted by white men.  Often I had stopped, on my way down the  road, to hold my ear against the pole, and, hearing its low  moaning, I used to wonder what the paleface had done to hurt it.   Now I sat watching for each pole that glided by to be the last one.  

In this way I had forgotten my uncomfortable surroundings,  when I heard one of my comrades call out my name.  I saw the  missionary standing very near, tossing candies and gums into our  midst.  This amused us all, and we tried to see who could catch the  most of the sweetmeats.  The missionary's generous distribution of  candies was impressed upon my memory by a disastrous result which  followed.  I had caught more than my share of candies and gums, and  soon after our arrival at the school I had a chance to disgrace  myself, which, I am ashamed to say, I did.  

Though we rode several days inside of the iron horse, I do not  recall a single thing about our luncheons.  

It was night when we reached the school grounds.  The lights  from the windows of the large buildings fell upon some of the  icicled trees that stood beneath them.  We were led toward an open  door, where the brightness of the lights within flooded out over  the heads of the excited palefaces who blocked the way.  My body  trembled more from fear than from the snow I trod upon.  

Entering the house, I stood close against the wall.  The  strong glaring light in the large whitewashed room dazzled my eyes.   The noisy hurrying of hard shoes upon a bare wooden floor    increased the whirring in my ears.  My only safety seemed to be in  keeping next to the wall.  As I was wondering in which direction to  escape from all this confusion, two warm hands grasped me firmly,  and in the same moment I was tossed high in midair.  A rosy-cheeked  paleface woman caught me in her arms.  I was both frightened and  insulted by such trifling.  I stared into her eyes, wishing her to  let me stand on my own feet, but she jumped me up and down with  increasing enthusiasm.  My mother had never made a plaything of her  wee daughter.  Remembering this I began to cry aloud.  

They misunderstood the cause of my tears, and placed me at a  white table loaded with food.  There our party were united again.   As I did not hush my crying, one of the older ones whispered to me,  "Wait until you are alone in the night."  

It was very little I could swallow besides my sobs, that  evening.  

"Oh, I want my mother and my brother Dawee!  I want to go to  my aunt!" I pleaded; but the ears of the palefaces could not hear  me.  

From the table we were taken along an upward incline of wooden  boxes, which I learned afterward to call a stairway.  At the top  was a quiet hall, dimly lighted.  Many narrow beds were in one  straight line down the entire length of the wall.  In them lay  sleeping brown faces, which peeped just out of the coverings.  I  was tucked into bed with one of the tall girls, because she talked  to me in my mother tongue and seemed to soothe me.  

I had arrived in the wonderful land of rosy skies, but I was  not happy, as I had thought I should be.  My long travel and the  bewildering sights had exhausted me.  I fell asleep, heaving deep,  tired sobs.  My tears were left to dry themselves in streaks,  because neither my aunt nor my mother was near to wipe them away.    

    
#  THE CUTTING OF MY LONG HAIR.

    The first day in the land of apples was a bitter-cold one; for  the snow still covered the ground, and the trees were bare.  A  large bell rang for breakfast, its loud metallic voice crashing  through the belfry overhead and into our sensitive ears.  The  annoying clatter of shoes on bare floors gave us no peace.  The  constant clash of harsh noises, with an undercurrent of many voices  murmuring an unknown tongue, made a bedlam within which I was  securely tied.  And though my spirit tore itself in struggling for  its lost freedom, all was useless.  

A paleface woman, with white hair, came up after us.  We were  placed in a line of girls who were marching into the dining room.   These were Indian girls, in stiff shoes and closely clinging  dresses.  The small girls wore sleeved aprons and shingled hair.   As I walked noiselessly in my soft moccasins, I felt like sinking  to the floor, for my blanket had been stripped from my shoulders.   I looked hard at the Indian girls, who seemed not to care that they  were even more immodestly dressed than I, in their tightly fitting  clothes.  While we marched in, the boys entered at an opposite  door.  I watched for the three young braves who came in our party.   I spied them in the rear ranks, looking as uncomfortable as I felt.  

A small bell was tapped, and each of the pupils drew a chair  from under the table.  Supposing this act meant they were to be  seated, I pulled out mine and at once slipped into it from one  side.  But when I turned my head, I saw that I was the only one  seated, and all the rest at our table remained standing.  Just as  I began to rise, looking shyly around to see how chairs were to be  used, a second bell was sounded.  All were seated at last, and I  had to crawl     back into my chair again.  I heard a man's  voice at one end of the hall, and I looked around to see him.  But  all the others hung their heads over their plates.  As I glanced at  the long chain of tables, I caught the eyes of a paleface woman  upon me.  Immediately I dropped my eyes, wondering why I was so  keenly watched by the strange woman.  The man ceased his  mutterings, and then a third bell was tapped.  Every one picked up  his knife and fork and began eating.  I began crying instead, for  by this time I was afraid to venture anything more.  

But this eating by formula was not the hardest trial in that  first day.  Late in the morning, my friend Judewin gave me a  terrible warning.  Judewin knew a few words of English, and she had  overheard the paleface woman talk about cutting our long, heavy  hair.  Our mothers had taught us that only unskilled warriors who  were captured had their hair shingled by the enemy.  Among our  people, short hair was worn by mourners, and shingled hair by  cowards!  

We discussed our fate some moments, and when Judewin said, "We  have to submit, because they are strong," I rebelled.  

"No, I will not submit!  I will struggle first!" I answered.  

I watched my chance, and when no one noticed I disappeared.   I crept up the stairs as quietly as I could in my squeaking shoes,--my moccasins had been exchanged for shoes.  Along the hall I  passed, without knowing whither I was going.  Turning aside to an  open door, I found a large room with three white beds in it.  The  windows were covered with dark green curtains, which made the room  very dim.  Thankful that no one was there, I directed my steps  toward the corner farthest from the door.  On my hands and knees I  crawled under the bed, and cuddled myself in the dark corner.  

From my hiding place I peered out, shuddering with fear  whenever I heard footsteps near by.  Though in the hall loud voices  were calling my name, and I knew that even Judewin was searching  for me, I did not open my mouth to answer.  Then the steps were  quickened and the voices became excited.  The sounds came nearer  and nearer.  Women and girls entered the room.  I held my breath,  and watched them open closet doors and peep behind large trunks.   Some one threw up the curtains, and the room was filled with sudden  light.  What caused them to stoop and look under the bed I do not  know.  I remember being dragged out, though I resisted by kicking  and scratching wildly.  In spite of myself, I was carried  downstairs and tied fast in a chair.  

I cried aloud, shaking my head all the while until I felt the  cold blades of the scissors against my neck, and heard them gnaw  off one of my thick braids.  Then I lost my spirit.  Since the day  I was taken from my mother I had suffered extreme indignities.   People had stared at me.  I had been tossed about in the air like  a wooden puppet.  And now my long hair was shingled like a  coward's!  In my anguish I moaned for my mother, but no one came to  comfort me.  Not a soul reasoned quietly with me, as my own mother  used to do; for now I was only one of many little animals driven by  a herder.    

    
#  THE SNOW EPISODE.

    A short time after our arrival we three Dakotas were playing  in the snowdrifts.  We were all still deaf to the English language,  excepting Judewin, who always heard such puzzling things.  One  morning we learned through her ears that we were forbidden to fall  lengthwise in the snow, as we had been doing, to see our own  impressions.  However,    before many hours we had forgotten  the order, and were having great sport in the snow, when a shrill  voice called us.  Looking up, we saw an imperative hand beckoning  us into the house.  We shook the snow off ourselves, and started  toward the woman as slowly as we dared.  

Judewin said: "Now the paleface is angry with us.  She is  going to punish us for falling into the snow.  If she looks  straight into your eyes and talks loudly, you must wait until she  stops.  Then, after a tiny pause, say, 'No.'"  The rest of the way  we practiced upon the little word "no."  

As it happened, Thowin was summoned to judgment first.  The  door shut behind her with a click.  

Judewin and I stood silently listening at the keyhole.  The  paleface woman talked in very severe tones.  Her words fell from  her lips like crackling embers, and her inflection ran up like the  small end of a switch.  I understood her voice better than the  things she was saying.  I was certain we had made her very  impatient with us.  Judewin heard enough of the words to realize  all too late that she had taught us the wrong reply.  

"Oh, poor Thowin!" she gasped, as she put both hands over her  ears.  

Just then I heard Thowin's tremulous answer, "No."  

With an angry exclamation, the woman gave her a hard spanking.   Then she stopped to say something.  Judewin said it was this: "Are  you going to obey my word the next time?"  

Thowin answered again with the only word at her command, "No."  

This time the woman meant her blows to smart, for the poor  frightened girl shrieked at the top of her voice.  In the midst of  the whipping the blows ceased abruptly, and the woman asked another  question: "Are you going to fall in the snow again?"  

Thowin gave her bad password another trial.  We heard her say  feebly, "No!  No!"  

With this the woman hid away her half-worn slipper, and led  the child out, stroking her black shorn head.  Perhaps it occurred  to her that brute force is not the solution for such a problem.   She did nothing to Judewin nor to me.  She only returned to us our  unhappy comrade, and left us alone in the room.  

During the first two or three seasons misunderstandings as  ridiculous as this one of the snow episode frequently took place,  bringing unjustifiable frights and punishments into our little  lives.  

Within a year I was able to express myself somewhat in broken  English.  As soon as I comprehended a part of what was said and  done, a mischievous spirit of revenge possessed me.  One day I was  called in from my play for some misconduct.  I had disregarded a  rule which seemed to me very needlessly binding.  I was sent into  the kitchen to mash the turnips for dinner.  It was noon, and  steaming dishes were hastily carried into the dining room.  I hated  turnips, and their odor which came from the brown jar was offensive  to me.  With fire in my heart, I took the wooden tool that the  paleface woman held out to me.  I stood upon a step, and, grasping  the handle with both hands, I bent in hot rage over the turnips.   I worked my vengeance upon them.  All were so busily occupied that  no one noticed me.  I saw that the turnips were in a pulp, and that  further beating could not improve them; but the order was, "Mash  these turnips," and mash them I would!  I renewed my energy; and as  I sent the masher into the bottom of the jar, I felt a satisfying  sensation that the weight of my body had gone into it.  

Just here a paleface woman came up to my table.  As she looked  into the jar she shoved my hands roughly aside.  I stood fearless  and angry.  She placed her red hands upon the rim of the jar.  Then  she gave one lift and a stride away from the table.  But lo! the  pulpy contents fell through the crumbled bottom    to the  floor!  She spared me no scolding phrases that I had earned.  I did  not heed them.  I felt triumphant in my revenge, though deep within  me I was a wee bit sorry to have broken the jar.  

As I sat eating my dinner, and saw that no turnips were  served, I whooped in my heart for having once asserted the  rebellion within me.    

    
#  THE DEVIL.

    Among the legends the old warriors used to tell me were many  stories of evil spirits.  But I was taught to fear them no more  than those who stalked about in material guise.  I never knew there  was an insolent chieftain among the bad spirits, who dared to array  his forces against the Great Spirit, until I heard this white man's  legend from a paleface woman.  

Out of a large book she showed me a picture of the white man's  devil.  I looked in horror upon the strong claws that grew out of  his fur-covered fingers.  His feet were like his hands.  Trailing  at his heels was a scaly tail tipped with a serpent's open jaws.   His face was a patchwork: he had bearded cheeks, like some I had  seen palefaces wear; his nose was an eagle's bill, and his sharp-pointed ears were pricked up like those of a sly fox.  Above them  a pair of cow's horns curved upward.  I trembled with awe, and my  heart throbbed in my throat, as I looked at the king of evil  spirits.  Then I heard the paleface woman say that this terrible  creature roamed loose in the world, and that little girls who  disobeyed school regulations were to be tortured by him.  

That night I dreamt about this evil divinity.  Once again I  seemed to be in my mother's cottage.  An Indian woman had come to  visit my mother.  On opposite sides of the kitchen stove, which  stood in the centre of the small house, my mother and her guest  were seated in straight-backed chairs.  I played with a train of  empty spools hitched together on a string.  It was night, and the  wick burned feebly.  Suddenly I heard some one turn our door-knob  from without.  

My mother and the woman hushed their talk, and both looked  toward the door.  It opened gradually.  I waited behind the stove.   The hinges squeaked as the door was slowly, very slowly pushed  inward.  

Then in rushed the devil!  He was tall!  He looked exactly  like the picture I had seen of him in the white man's papers.  he  did not speak to my mother, because he did not know the Indian  language, but his glittering yellow eyes were fastened upon me.  He  took long strides around the stove, passing behind the woman's  chair.  I threw down my spools, and ran to my mother.  He did not  fear her, but followed closely after me.  Then I ran round and  round the stove, crying aloud for help.  But my mother and the  woman seemed not to know my danger.  They sat still, looking  quietly upon the devil's chase after me.  At last I grew dizzy.  My  head revolved as on a hidden pivot.  My knees became numb, and  doubled under my weight like a pair of knife blades without a  spring.  Beside my mother's chair I fell in a heap.  Just as the  devil stooped over me with outstretched claws my mother awoke from  her quiet indifference, and lifted me on her lap.  Whereupon the  devil vanished, and I was awake.  

On the following morning I took my revenge upon the devil.   Stealing into the room where a wall of shelves was filled with  books, I drew forth The Stories of the Bible.  With a broken slate  pencil I carried in my apron pocket, I began by scratching out his  wicked eyes.  A few moments later, when I was ready to leave the  room, there was a ragged hole in the page where the picture of the  devil had once been. 

         
#  IRON ROUTINE.

     A loud-clamoring bell awakened us at half past six in the cold  winter mornings.  From happy dreams of Western rolling lands and  unlassoed freedom we tumbled out upon chilly bare floors back again  into a paleface day.  We had short time to jump into our shoes and  clothes, and wet our eyes with icy water, before a small hand bell  was vigorously rung for roll call.  

There were too many drowsy children and too numerous orders  for the day to waste a moment in any apology to nature for giving  her children such a shock in the early morning.  We rushed  downstairs, bounding over two high steps at a time, to land in the  assembly room.  

A paleface woman, with a yellow-covered roll book open on her  arm and a gnawed pencil in her hand, appeared at the door.  Her  small, tired face was coldly lighted with a pair of large gray  eyes.  

She stood still in a halo of authority, while over the rim of  her spectacles her eyes pried nervously about the room.  Having  glanced at her long list of names and called out the first one, she  tossed up her chin and peered through the crystals of her  spectacles to make sure of the answer "Here."  

Relentlessly her pencil black-marked our daily records if we  were not present to respond to our names, and no chum of ours had  done it successfully for us.  No matter if a dull headache or the  painful cough of slow consumption had delayed the absentee, there  was only time enough to mark the tardiness.  It was next to  impossible to leave the iron routine after the civilizing machine  had once begun its day's buzzing; and as it was inbred in me to  suffer in silence rather than to appeal to the ears of one whose  open eyes could not see my pain, I have many times trudged in the  day's harness heavy-footed, like a dumb sick brute.  

Once I lost a dear classmate.  I remember well how she used to  mope along at my side, until one morning she could not raise her  head from her pillow.  At her deathbed I stood weeping, as the  paleface woman sat near her moistening the dry lips.  Among the  folds of the bedclothes I saw the open pages of the white man's  Bible.  The dying Indian girl talked disconnectedly of Jesus the  Christ and the paleface who was cooling her swollen hands and feet.  

I grew bitter, and censured the woman for cruel neglect of our  physical ills.  I despised the pencils that moved automatically,  and the one teaspoon which dealt out, from a large bottle, healing  to a row of variously ailing Indian children.  I blamed the hard-working, well-meaning, ignorant woman who was inculcating in our  hearts her superstitious ideas.  Though I was sullen in all my  little troubles, as soon as I felt better I was ready again to  smile upon the cruel woman.  Within a week I was again actively  testing the chains which tightly bound my individuality like a  mummy for burial.  

The melancholy of those black days has left so long a shadow  that it darkens the path of years that have since gone by.  These  sad memories rise above those of smoothly grinding school days.   Perhaps my Indian nature is the moaning wind which stirs them now  for their present record.  But, however tempestuous this is within  me, it comes out as the low voice of a curiously colored sea-shell,  which is only for those ears that are bent with compassion to hear  it.    

    
#  FOUR STRANGE SUMMERS.

    After my first three years of school, I roamed again in the  Western country through four strange summers. 

      During this time I seemed to hang in the heart of chaos,  beyond the touch or voice of human aid.  My brother, being almost  ten years my senior, did not quite understand my feelings.  My  mother had never gone inside of a schoolhouse, and so she was not  capable of comforting her daughter who could read and write.  Even  nature seemed to have no place for me.  I was neither a wee girl  nor a tall one; neither a wild Indian nor a tame one.  This  deplorable situation was the effect of my brief course in the East,  and the unsatisfactory "teenth" in a girl's years.  

It was under these trying conditions that, one bright  afternoon, as I sat restless and unhappy in my brother's cabin, I  caught the sound of the spirited step of my brother's pony on the  road which passed by our dwelling.  Soon I heard the wheels of a  light buckboard, and Dawee's familiar "Ho!" to his pony.  He  alighted upon the bare ground in front of our house.  Tying his  pony to one of the projecting corner logs of the low-roofed  cottage, he stepped upon the wooden doorstep.  

I met him there with a hurried greeting, and as I passed by,  he looked a quiet "What?" into my eyes.  

When he began talking with my mother, I slipped the rope from  the pony's bridle.  Seizing the reins and bracing my feet against  the dashboard, I wheeled around in an instant.  The pony was ever  ready to try his speed.  Looking backward, I saw Dawee waving his  hand to me.  I turned with the curve in the road and disappeared.   I followed the winding road which crawled upward between the bases  of little hillocks.  Deep water-worn ditches ran parallel on either  side.  A strong wind blew against my cheeks and fluttered my  sleeves.  The pony reached the top of the highest hill, and began  an even race on the level lands.  There was nothing moving within  that great circular horizon of the Dakota prairies save the tall  grasses, over which the wind blew and rolled off in long, shadowy  waves.  

Within this vast wigwam of blue and green I rode reckless and  insignificant.  It satisfied my small consciousness to see the  white foam fly from the pony's mouth.  

Suddenly, out of the earth a coyote came forth at a swinging  trot that was taking the cunning thief toward the hills and the  village beyond.  Upon the moment's impulse, I gave him a long chase  and a wholesome fright.  As I turned away to go back to the  village, the wolf sank down upon his haunches for rest, for it was  a hot summer day; and as I drove slowly homeward, I saw his sharp  nose still pointed at me, until I vanished below the margin of the  hilltops.  

In a little while I came in sight of my mother's house.  Dawee  stood in the yard, laughing at an old warrior who was pointing his  forefinger, and again waving his whole hand, toward the hills.   With his blanket drawn over one shoulder, he talked and motioned  excitedly.  Dawee turned the old man by the shoulder and pointed me  out to him.  

"Oh han!" (Oh yes) the warrior muttered, and went his way.  He  had climbed the top of his favorite barren hill to survey the  surrounding prairies, when he spied my chase after the coyote.  His  keen eyes recognized the pony and driver.  At once uneasy for my  safety, he had come running to my mother's cabin to give her  warning.  I did not appreciate his kindly interest, for there was  an unrest gnawing at my heart.  

As soon as he went away, I asked Dawee about something else.  

"No, my baby sister, I cannot take you with me to the party  to-night," he replied.  Though I was not far from fifteen, and I  felt that before long I should enjoy all the privileges of my tall  cousin, Dawee persisted in calling me his baby sister.  

That moonlight night, I cried in my mother's presence when I  heard the jolly young people pass by our cottage.  They     were no more young braves in blankets and eagle plumes, nor Indian  maids with prettily painted cheeks.  They had gone three years to  school in the East, and had become civilized.  The young men wore  the white man's coat and trousers, with bright neckties.  The girls  wore tight muslin dresses, with ribbons at neck and waist.  At  these gatherings they talked English.  I could speak English almost  as well as my brother, but I was not properly dressed to be taken  along.  I had no hat, no ribbons, and no close-fitting gown.  Since  my return from school I had thrown away my shoes, and wore again  the soft moccasins.  

While Dawee was busily preparing to go I controlled my tears.   But when I heard him bounding away on his pony, I buried my face in  my arms and cried hot tears.  

My mother was troubled by my unhappiness.  Coming to my side,  she offered me the only printed matter we had in our home.  It was  an Indian Bible, given her some years ago by a missionary.  She  tried to console me.  "Here, my child, are the white man's papers.   Read a little from them," she said most piously.  

I took it from her hand, for her sake; but my enraged spirit  felt more like burning the book, which afforded me no help, and was  a perfect delusion to my mother.  I did not read it, but laid it  unopened on the floor, where I sat on my feet.  The dim yellow  light of the braided muslin burning in a small vessel of oil  flickered and sizzled in the awful silent storm which followed my  rejection of the Bible.  

Now my wrath against the fates consumed my tears before they  reached my eyes.  I sat stony, with a bowed head.  My mother threw  a shawl over her head and shoulders, and stepped out into the  night.  

After an uncertain solitude, I was suddenly aroused by a loud  cry piercing the night.  It was my mother's voice wailing among the  barren hills which held the bones of buried warriors.  She called  aloud for her brothers' spirits to support her in her helpless  misery.  My fingers grew icy cold, as I realized that my  unrestrained tears had betrayed my suffering to her, and she was  grieving for me.  

Before she returned, though I knew she was on her way, for she  had ceased her weeping, I extinguished the light, and leaned my  head on the window sill.  

Many schemes of running away from my surroundings hovered  about in my mind.  A few more moons of such a turmoil drove me away  to the Eastern school.  I rode on the white man's iron steed,  thinking it would bring me back to my mother in a few winters, when  I should be grown tall, and there would be congenial friends  awaiting me.    

    
#  INCURRING MY MOTHER'S DISPLEASURE.

    In the second journey to the East I had not come without some  precautions.  I had a secret interview with one of our best  medicine men, and when I left his wigwam I carried securely in my  sleeve a tiny bunch of magic roots.  This possession assured me of  friends wherever I should go.  So absolutely did I believe in its  charms that I wore it through all the school routine for more than  a year.  Then, before I lost my faith in the dead roots, I lost the  little buckskin bag containing all my good luck.  

At the close of this second term of three years I was the  proud owner of my first diploma.  The following autumn I ventured  upon a college career against my mother's will.  

I had written for her approval, but in her reply I found no  encouragement.  She called my notice to her neighbors' children,  who had completed their education in three years.  They had       returned to their homes, and were then talking English with the  frontier settlers.  Her few words hinted that I had better give up  my slow attempt to learn the white man's ways, and be content to  roam over the prairies and find my living upon wild roots.  I  silenced her by deliberate disobedience.  

Thus, homeless and heavy-hearted, I began anew my life among  strangers.  

As I hid myself in my little room in the college dormitory,  away from the scornful and yet curious eyes of the students, I  pined for sympathy.  Often I wept in secret, wishing I had gone  West, to be nourished by my mother's love, instead of remaining  among a cold race whose hearts were frozen hard with prejudice.  

During the fall and winter seasons I scarcely had a real  friend, though by that time several of my classmates were courteous  to me at a safe distance.  

My mother had not yet forgiven my rudeness to her, and I had  no moment for letter-writing.  By daylight and lamplight, I spun  with reeds and thistles, until my hands were tired from their  weaving, the magic design which promised me the white man's  respect.  

At length, in the spring term, I entered an oratorical contest  among the various classes.  As the day of competition approached,  it did not seem possible that the event was so near at hand, but it  came.  In the chapel the classes assembled together, with their  invited guests.  The high platform was carpeted, and gayly  festooned with college colors.  A bright white light illumined the  room, and outlined clearly the great polished beams that arched the  domed ceiling.  The assembled crowds filled the air with pulsating  murmurs.  When the hour for speaking arrived all were hushed.  But  on the wall the old clock which pointed out the trying moment  ticked calmly on.  

One after another I saw and heard the orators.  Still, I could  not realize that they longed for the favorable decision of the  judges as much as I did.  Each contestant received a loud burst of  applause, and some were cheered heartily.  Too soon my turn came,  and I paused a moment behind the curtains for a deep breath.  After  my concluding words, I heard the same applause that the others had  called out.  

Upon my retreating steps, I was astounded to receive from my  fellow students a large bouquet of roses tied with flowing ribbons.   With the lovely flowers I fled from the stage.  This friendly token  was a rebuke to me for the hard feelings I had borne them.  

Later, the decision of the judges awarded me the first place.   Then there was a mad uproar in the hall, where my classmates sang  and shouted my name at the top of their lungs; and the disappointed  students howled and brayed in fearfully dissonant tin trumpets.  In  this excitement, happy students rushed forward to offer their  congratulations.  And I could not conceal a smile when they wished  to escort me in a procession to the students' parlor, where all  were going to calm themselves.  Thanking them for the kind spirit  which prompted them to make such a proposition, I walked alone with  the night to my own little room.  

A few weeks afterward, I appeared as the college  representative in another contest.  This time the competition was  among orators from different colleges in our state.  It was held at  the state capital, in one of the largest opera houses.  

Here again was a strong prejudice against my people.  In the  evening, as the great audience filled the house, the student bodies  began warring among themselves.  Fortunately, I was spared  witnessing any of the noisy wrangling before the contest began.   The slurs against the Indian that stained the lips of our opponents  were already burning like a dry fever within my breast.  

But after the orations were delivered a deeper burn awaited  me.  There,     before that vast ocean of eyes, some college  rowdies threw out a large white flag, with a drawing of a most  forlorn Indian girl on it.  Under this they had printed in bold  black letters words that ridiculed the college which was  represented by a "squaw."  Such worse than barbarian rudeness  embittered me.  While we waited for the verdict of the judges, I  gleamed fiercely upon the throngs of palefaces.  My teeth were hard  set, as I saw the white flag still floating insolently in the air.  

Then anxiously we watched the man carry toward the stage the  envelope containing the final decision.  

There were two prizes given, that night, and one of them was  mine!  

The evil spirit laughed within me when the white flag dropped  out of sight, and the hands which furled it hung limp in defeat.  

Leaving the crowd as quickly as possible, I was soon in my  room.  The rest of the night I sat in an armchair and gazed into  the crackling fire.  I laughed no more in triumph when thus alone.   The little taste of victory did not satisfy a hunger in my heart.   In my mind I saw my mother far away on the Western plains, and she  was holding a charge against me.
