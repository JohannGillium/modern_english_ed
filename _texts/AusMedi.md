       	  MEDICINE SONG  TO BE SUNG IN TIME OF EVIL FORTUNE  *From the Paiute Indian Dialect, Done into English by Mary Austin)*        	   - MEDICINE me,
 - O Friend-of-the-Soul-of-Man,
 - With purging waters!
 - For my soul festers
 - And an odor of corruption
 - Betrays me to disaster.
  - As a place of carrion
 - Where buzzards are gathered,
 - So is my path
 - Overshadowed by evil adventures;
 - Meanness, betrayal, and spite
 - Flock under heaven
 - To make me aware
 - Of sickness and death within me.
  - Medicine my soul, O friend,
 - With waters of cleansing;
 - Then shall my way shine,
 - And my nights no longer
 - Be full of the dreadful sound
 - Of the wings of unsuccesses.
