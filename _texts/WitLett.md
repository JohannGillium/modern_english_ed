# HER LETTER TO HIM

     - WHAT shall I say to him, heart of my heart?
  - How shall I write to the dear one I love?
    - The thoughts that I send must form cloth of gold,
  - Both warp and woof, of words throbbing with life.
  - Sweet must they be, yet not too sweet.  Oh, no!
  - Just the faint memory of other days
  - Must they suggest; happy, too, must they be;
  - Yet a fine sadness must read 'tween the lines.
  - Not, like a child, say crudely I miss him,
  - My heart is aching to hear his dear voice;
  - Yet must he see the sad curve of my lips.
  - He must hope that he is breaking my heart
  - By his absence — hope, not be sure.  Oh, no!
    - Oh, this letter!  It must blow hot and cold,
  - Demure, a bit impish be, shy and gay;
  - Frank, too, yet not too frank — not one small word
  - May be said that would face me and shame me.
  - It must hold lips to be kissed, yet not hint — 
  - Yet not hint that I — how can I say it?
  - It must make him fly to me, tell his love,
  - Clasp me close in his arms; yet not reveal
  - One word of my secret.  Oh, this letter!
  - Was there e'er such a task as this of mine — 
  - To write my heart's message to my beloved?
                                     *Laura Withrow*
