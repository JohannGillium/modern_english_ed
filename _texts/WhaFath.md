##                           I  

    AFTER his wife's death Mason Grew took the momentous step of  selling out his business and moving from Wingfield, Connecticut, to  Brooklyn.  

For years he had secretly nursed the hope of such a change,  but had never dared to suggest it to Mrs. Grew, a woman of  immutable habits.  Mr. Grew himself was attached to Wingfield,  where he had grown up, prospered, and become what the local press  described as "prominent."  He was attached to his ugly brick house  with sandstone trimmings and a cast-iron area-railing neatly sanded  to match; to the similar row of houses across the street, the  "trolley" wires forming a kind of aerial pathway between, and the  sprawling vista closed by the steeple of the church which he and  his wife had always attended, and where their only child had been  baptized.  

It was hard to snap all these threads of association, visual  and sentimental; yet still harder, now that he was alone, to live  so far from his boy.  Ronald Grew was practising law in New York,  and there was no more chance of returning to live at Wingfield than  of a river's flowing inland from the sea.  Therefore to be near him  his father must move; and it was characteristic of Mr. Grew, and of  the situation generally, that the translation, when it took place,  was to Brooklyn, and not to New York.  

"Why you bury yourself in that hole I can't think," had been  Ronald's comment; and Mr. Grew simply replied that rents were lower  in Brooklyn, and that he had heard of a house that would suit him.   In reality he had said to himself—being the only recipient of his  own confidences—that if he went to New York he might be on the  boy's mind; whereas, if he lived in Brooklyn, Ronald would always  have a good excuse for not popping over to see him every other day.   The sociological isolation of Brooklyn, combined with its  geographical nearness, presented in fact the precise conditions for  Mr. Grew's case.  He wanted to be near enough to New York to go  there often, to feel under his feet the same pavement that Ronald  trod, to sit now and then in the same theatres, and find on his  breakfast-table the journals which, with increasing frequency,  inserted Ronald's name in the sacred bounds of the society column.   It had always been a trial to Mr. Grew to have to wait twenty-four  hours to read that "among those present was Mr. Ronald Grew."  Now  he had it with his coffee, and left it on the breakfast-table to  the perusal of a "hired girl" cosmopolitan enough to do it justice.   In such ways Brooklyn attested the advantages of its propinquity to  New York, while remaining, as regards Ronald's duty to his father,  as remote and inaccessible as Wingfield.  

It was not that Ronald shirked his filial obligations, but  rather because of his heavy sense of them, that Mr. Grew so  persistently sought to minimize and lighten them.  It was he who  insisted, to Ronald, on the immense difficulty of getting from New  York to Brooklyn.  

"Any way you look at it, it makes a big hole in the day; and  there's not much use in the ragged rim left.  You say you're dining  out next Sunday?  Then I forbid you to come over here for lunch.   Do you understand me, sir?  You disobey at the risk of your  father's malediction!  Where did you say you were dining?  With the  Waltham Bankshires again?  Why, that's the second time in three  weeks, ain't it?  Big blow-out, I suppose?  Gold plate and  orchids—opera singers in afterward?  Well, you'd be in a nice box  if there was a fog on the river, and you got hung up half-way over.   That'd be a handsome return for the attention Mrs. Bankshire has  shown you—singling out a whipper-snapper like you twice in three  weeks!  (What's the daughter's name—Daisy?)  No, * sir*—don't  you come fooling round here next Sunday, or I'll set the dogs on  you.  And you wouldn't find me in anyhow, come to think of it.  I'm  lunching out myself, as it happens—yes sir, * lunching out*.  Is  there anything especially comic in   my lunching out?  I  don't often do it, you say?  Well, that's no reason why I never  should.  Who with?  Why, with—with old Dr. Bleaker: Dr. Eliphalet  Bleaker.  No, you wouldn't know about him—he's only an old friend  of your mother's and mine."  

Gradually Ronald's insistence became less difficult to  overcome.  With his customary sweetness and tact (as Mr. Grew put  it) he began to "take the hint," to give in to "the old  gentleman's" growing desire for solitude.  

"I'm set in my ways, Ronny, that's about the size of it; I  like to go tick-ticking along like a clock.  I always did.  And  when you come bouncing in I never feel sure there's enough for  dinner—or that I haven't sent Maria out for the evening.  And I  don't want the neighbors to see me opening my own door to my son.   That's the kind of cringing snob I am.  Don't give me away, will  you?  I want 'em to think I keep four or five powdered flunkeys in  the hall day and night—same as the lobby of one of those Fifth  Avenue hotels.  And if you pop over when you're not expected, how  am I going to keep up the bluff?"  

Ronald yielded after the proper amount of resistance—his  intuitive sense, in every social transaction, of the proper amount  of force to be expended, was one of the qualities his father most  admired in him.  Mr. Grew's perceptions in this line were probably  more acute than his son suspected.  The souls of short thick-set  men, with chubby features, mutton-chop whiskers, and pale eyes  peering between folds of fat like almond kernels in half-split  shells—souls thus encased do not reveal themselves to the casual  scrutiny as delicate emotional instruments.  But in spite of the  dense disguise in which he walked Mr. Grew vibrated exquisitely in  response to every imaginative appeal; and his son Ronald was  perpetually stimulating and feeding his imagination.  

Ronald in fact constituted his father's one escape from the  impenetrable element of mediocrity which had always hemmed him in.   To a man so enamoured of beauty, and so little qualified to add to  its sum total, it was a wonderful privilege to have bestowed on the  world such a being.  Ronald's resemblance to Mr. Grew's early  conception of what he himself would have liked to look might have  put new life into the discredited theory of pre-natal influences.   At any rate, if the young man owed his beauty, his distinction and  his winning manner to the dreams of one of his parents, it was  certainly to those of Mr. Grew, who, while outwardly devoting his  life to the manufacture and dissemination of Grew's Secure  Suspender Buckle, moved in an enchanted inward world peopled with  all the figures of romance.  In this high company Mr. Grew cut as  brilliant a figure as any of its noble phantoms; and to see his  vision of himself suddenly projected on the outer world in the  shape of a brilliant popular conquering son, seemed, in retrospect,  to give to that image a belated objective reality.  There were even  moments when, forgetting his physiognomy, Mr. Grew said to himself  that if he'd had "half a chance" he might have done as well as  Ronald; but this only fortified his resolve that Ronald should do  infinitely better.  

Ronald's ability to do well almost equalled his gift of  looking well.  Mr. Grew constantly affirmed to himself that the boy  was "not a genius"; but, barring this slight deficiency, he was  almost everything that a parent could wish.  Even at Harvard he had  managed to be several desirable things at once—writing poetry in  the college magazine, playing delightfully "by ear," acquitting  himself honorably in his studies, and yet holding his own in the  fashionable sporting set that formed, as it were, the gateway of  the temple of Society.  Mr. Grew's idealism did not preclude the  frank desire that his son should pass through that gateway; but the  wish was not prompted by material considerations.  It was Mr.  Grew's notion that, in the rough and hurrying current of a new  civilization, the little pools of leisure and enjoyment must  nurture delicate growths, material graces as well as moral  refinements, likely to be uprooted and swept away by the rush of  the main torrent.  He based his theory on the fact that he had  liked the few "society" people he had met—had found their manners  simpler, their voices more agreeable, their views more consonant  with his own, than those of the leading citizens of Wingfield.  But  then he had met very few.  

Ronald's sympathies needed no urging in the same direction.   He took naturally, dauntlessly, to all the high and exceptional  things about which his father's imagina- tion had so long  sheepishly and ineffectually hovered—from the start he * was*  what Mr. Grew had dreamed of being.  And so precise, so detailed,  was Mr. Grew's vision of his own imaginary career, that as Ronald  grew up, and began to travel in a widening orbit, his father had an  almost uncanny sense of the extent to which that career was  enacting itself before him.  At Harvard, Ronald had done exactly  what the hypothetical Mason Grew would have done, had not his  actual self, at the same age, been working his way up in old  Slagden's button factory—the institution which was later to  acquire fame, and even notoriety, as the birthplace of Grew's  Secure Suspender Buckle.  Afterward, at a period when the actual  Grew had passed from the factory to the bookkeeper's desk, his  invisible double had been reading law at Columbia—precisely again  what Ronald did!  But it was when the young man left the paths laid  out for him by the parental hand, and cast himself boldly on the  world, that his adventures began to bear the most astonishing  resemblance to those of the unrealized Mason Grew.  It was in New  York that the scene of this hypothetical being's first exploits had  always been laid; and it was in New York that Ronald was to achieve  his first triumph.  There was nothing small or timid about Mr.  Grew's imagination; it had never stopped at anything between  Wingfield and the metropolis.  And the real Ronald had the same  cosmic vision as his parent.  He brushed aside with a contemptuous  laugh his mother's tearful entreaty that he should stay at  Wingfield and continue the dynasty of the Grew Suspender Buckle.   Mr. Grew knew that in reality Ronald winced at the Buckle, loathed  it, blushed for his connection with it.  Yet it was the Buckle that  had seen him through Groton, Harvard and the Law School, and had  permitted him to enter the office of a distinguished corporation  lawyer, instead of being enslaved to some sordid business with  quick returns.  The Buckle had been Ronald's fairy godmother—yet  his father did not blame him for abhorring and disowning it.  Mr.  Grew himself often bitterly regretted having bestowed his own name  on the instrument of his material success, though, at the time, his  doing so had been the natural expression of his romanticism.  When  he invented the Buckle, and took out his patent, he and his wife  both felt that to bestow their name on it was like naming a battle-ship or a peak of the Andes.  

Mrs. Grew had never learned to know better; but Mr. Grew had  discovered his error before Ronald was out of school.  He read it  first in a black eye of his boy's.  Ronald's symmetry had been  marred by the insolent fist of a fourth former whom he had  chastised for alluding to his father as "Old Buckles;" and when Mr.  Grew heard the epithet he understood in a flash that the Buckle was  a thing to blush for.  It was too late then to dissociate his name  from it, or to efface from the hoardings of the entire continent  the picture of two gentlemen, one contorting himself in the abject  effort to repair a broken brace, while the careless ease of the  other's attitude proclaimed his trust in the Secure Suspender  Buckle.  These records were indelible, but Ronald could at least be  spared all direct connection with them; and from that day Mr. Grew  resolved that the boy should not return to Wingfield.  

"You'll see," he had said to Mrs. Grew, "he'll take right hold  in New York.  Ronald's got my knack for taking hold," he added,  throwing out his chest.  

"But the way you took hold was in business," objected Mrs.  Grew, who was large and literal.  

Mr. Grew's chest collapsed, and he became suddenly conscious  of his comic face in its rim of sandy whiskers.  "That's not the  only way," he said, with a touch of wistfulness which escaped his  wife's analysis.  

"Well, of course you could have written beautifully," she  rejoined with admiring eyes.  

*" Written?*  Me!"  Mr. Grew became sardonic.  

"Why, those letters—weren't * they* beautiful, I'd like to  know?"  

The couple exchanged a glance, innocently allusive and amused  on the wife's part, and charged with a sudden tragic significance  on the husband's.  

"Well, I've got to be going along to the office now," he  merely said, dragging himself out of his rocking-chair.   

This had happened while Ronald was still at school; and now  Mrs. Grew slept in the Wingfield cemetery, under a life-size theo- logical virtue of her own choosing, and Mr. Grew's  prognostications as to Ronald's ability to "take right hold" in New  York were being more and more brilliantly fulfilled.  

      
##                           II  

   RONALD obeyed his father's injunction not to come to luncheon  on the day of the Bankshires' dinner; but in the middle of the  following week Mr. Grew was surprised by a telegram from his son.  

"Want to see you important matter.  Expect me to-morrow  afternoon."  

Mr. Grew received the telegram after breakfast.  To peruse it  he had lifted his eye from a paragraph of the morning paper  describing a fancy-dress dinner which had taken place the night  before at the Hamilton Gliddens' for the house-warming of their new  Fifth Avenue palace.  

"Among the couples who afterward danced in the Poets'  Quadrille were Miss Daisy Bankshire, looking more than usually  lovely as Laura, and Mr. Ronald Grew as the young Petrarch."  

Petrarch and Laura!  Well—if * anything* meant anything, Mr.  Grew supposed he knew what that meant.  For weeks past he had  noticed how constantly the names of the young people appeared  together in the society notes he so insatiably devoured.  Even the  soulless reporter was getting into the habit of coupling them in  his lists.  And this Laura and Petrarch business was almost an  announcement. . .  

Mr. Grew dropped the telegram, wiped his eye-glasses, and re-read the paragraph.  "Miss Daisy Bankshire . . . more than usually  lovely. . ."  Yes; she * was* lovely.  He had often seen her  photograph in the papers—seen her represented in every conceivable  attitude of the mundane game: fondling her prize bull-dog, taking  a fence on her thoroughbred, dancing a * gavotte*, all patches and  plumes, or fingering a guitar, all tulle and lilies; and once he  had caught a glimpse of her at the theatre.  Hearing that Ronald  was going to a fashionable first-night with the Bankshires, Mr.  Grew had for once overcome his repugnance to following his son's  movements, and had secured for himself, under the shadow of the  balcony, a stall whence he could observe the Bankshire box without  fear of detection.  Ronald had never known of his father's presence  at the play; and for three blessed hours Mr. Grew had watched his  boy's handsome dark head bent above the dense fair hair and white  averted shoulder that were all he could catch of Miss Bankshire's  beauties.  

He recalled the vision now; and with it came, as usual, its  ghostly double: the vision of his young self bending above such a  white shoulder and such shining hair.  Needless to say that the  real Mason Grew had never found himself in so enviable a situation.   The late Mrs. Grew had no more resembled Miss Daisy Bankshire than  he had looked like the happy victorious Ronald.  And the mystery  was that from their dull faces, their dull endearments, the miracle  of Ronald should have sprung.  It was almost—fantastically—as if  the boy had been a changeling, child of a Latmian night, whom the  divine companion of Mr. Grew's early reveries had secretly laid in  the cradle of the Wingfield bedroom while Mr. And Mrs. Grew slept  the deep sleep of conjugal indifference.  

The young Mason Grew had not at first accepted this astral  episode as the complete cancelling of his claims on romance.  He  too had grasped at the high-hung glory; and, with his fatal  tendency to reach too far when he reached at all, had singled out  the prettiest girl in Wingfield.  When he recalled his stammered  confession of love his face still tingled under her cool bright  stare.  The wonder of his audacity had struck her dumb; and when  she recovered her voice it was to fling a taunt at him.  

"Don't be too discouraged, you know—have you ever thought of  trying Addie Wicks?"  

All Wingfield would have understood the gibe: Addie Wicks was  the dullest girl in town.  And a year later he had married Addie  Wicks. . .   

He looked up from the perusal of Ronald's telegram with this  memory in his mind.  Now at last his dream was coming true!  His  boy would taste of the joys that had mocked his thwarted youth and  his dull gray middle-age.  And it was fitting that they should be  realized in Ronald's destiny.  Ronald was made to take happiness  boldly by the hand and lead it home like a bridegroom.  He had the  carriage, the confidence, the high faith in his fortune, that     compel the wilful stars.  And, thanks to the Buckle, he would  have the exceptional setting, the background of material elegance,  that became his conquering person.  Since Mr. Grew had retired from  business his investments had prospered, and he had been saving up  his income for just such a contingency.  His own wants were few: he  had transferred the Wingfield furniture to Brooklyn, and his  sitting-room was a replica of that in which the long years of his  married life had been spent.  Even the florid carpet on which  Ronald's tottering footsteps had been taken was carefully matched  when it became too threadbare.  And on the marble centre-table,  with its chenille-fringed cover and bunch of dyed pampas grass, lay  the illustrated Longfellow and the copy of Ingersoll's lectures  which represented literature to Mr. Grew when he had led home his  bride.  In the light of Ronald's romance, Mr. Grew found himself  re-living, with a strange tremor of mingled pain and tenderness,  all the poor prosaic incidents of his own personal history.   Curiously enough, with this new splendor on them they began to emit  a small faint ray of their own.  His wife's armchair, in its usual  place by the fire, recalled her placid unperceiving presence,  seated opposite to him during the long drowsy years; and he felt  her kindness, her equanimity, where formerly he had only ached at  her obtuseness.  And from the chair he glanced up at the large  discolored photograph on the wall above, with a brittle brown  wreath suspended on a corner of the frame.  The photograph  represented a young man with a poetic necktie and untrammelled  hair, leaning negligently against a Gothic chair-back, a roll of  music in his hand; and beneath was scrawled a bar of Chopin, with  the words: *" Adieu, Adele*."  

The portrait was that of the great pianist, Fortune  Dolbrowski; and its presence on the wall of Mr. Grew's sitting-room  commemorated the only exquisite hour of his life save that of  Ronald's birth.  It was some time before the latter memorable  event, a few months only after Mr. Grew's marriage, that he had  taken his wife to New York to hear the great Dolbrowski.  Their  evening had been magically beautiful, and even Addie, roused from  her habitual inexpressiveness, had quivered into a momentary  semblance of life.  "I never—I never—" she gasped out helplessly  when they had regained their hotel bedroom, and sat staring back  entranced at the evening's evocations.  Her large immovable face  was pink and tremulous, and she sat with her hands on her knees,  forgetting to roll up her bonnet-strings and prepare her curl-papers.  

"I'd like to * write* him just how I felt—I wisht I knew  how!" she burst out suddenly in a final effervescence of emotion.  

Her husband lifted his head and looked at her.  

"Would you?  I feel that way too," he said with a sheepish  laugh.  And they continued to stare at each other shyly through a  transfiguring mist of sound.  

Mr. Grew recalled the scene as he gazed up at the pianist's  faded photograph.  "Well, I owe her that anyhow—poor Addie!" he  said, with a smile at the inconsequences of fate.  With Ronald's  telegram in his hand he was in a mood to count his mercies.  

      
##                            III  

   "A CLEAR twenty-five thousand a year: that's what you can tell  'em with my compliments," said Mr. Grew, glancing complacently  across the centre-table at his boy's charming face.  

It struck him that Ronald's gift for looking his part in life  had never so romantically expressed itself.  Other young men, at  such a moment, would have been red, damp, tight about the collar;  but Ronald's cheek was only a shade paler, and the contrast made  his dark eyes more expressive.  

"A clear twenty-five thousand; yes, sir—that's what I always  meant you to have."  

Mr. Grew leaned back, his hands thrust carelessly in his  pockets, as though to divert attention from the agitation of his  features.  He had often pictured himself rolling out that phrase to  Ronald, and now that it was actually on his lips he could not  control their tremor.  

Ronald listened in silence, lifting a nervous hand to his  slight dark moustache, as though he, too, wished to hide some  involuntary betrayal of emotion.  At first Mr. Grew took his  silence for an expression of gratified surprise; but as it  prolonged itself it became less easy to interpret.  

"I—see here, my boy; did you expect more?  Isn't it enough?"   Mr. Grew   cleared his throat.  "Do * they* expect more?' he  asked nervously.  He was hardly able to face the pain of inflicting  a disappointment on Ronald at the very moment when he had counted  on putting the final touch to his felicity.  

Ronald moved uneasily in his chair and his eyes wandered  upward to the laurel-wreathed photograph of the pianist above his  father's head.  

*" Is* it that, Ronald?  Speak out, my boy.  We'll see, we'll  look round—I'll manage somehow."  

"No, no," the young man interrupted, abruptly raising his hand  as though to silence his father.  

Mr. Grew recovered his cheerfulness.  "Well, what's the matter  than, if * she's* willing?"  

Ronald shifted his position again, and finally rose from his  seat.  

"Father—I—there's something I've got to tell you.  I can't  take your money."  

Mr. Grew sat speechless a moment, staring blankly at his son;  then he emitted a puzzled laugh.  "My money?  What are you talking  about?  What's this about my money?  Why, it ain't * mine*, Ronny;  it's all yours—every cent of it!" he cried.  

The young man met his tender look with a gaze of tragic  rejection.  

"No, no, it's not mine—not even in the sense you mean.  Not  in any sense.  Can't you understand my feeling so?"  

"Feeling so?  I don't know how you're feeling.  I don't know  what you're talking about.  Are you too proud to touch any money  you haven't earned?  Is that what you're trying to tell me?"  

"No.  It's not that.  You must know—"  

Mr. Grew flushed to the rim of his bristling whiskers.  "Know?   Know * what?*  Can't you speak?"  

Ronald hesitated, and the two men faced each other for a long  strained moment, during which Mr. Grew's congested countenance grew  gradually pale again.  

"What's the meaning of this?  Is it because you've done  something . . . something you're ashamed of . . . ashamed to tell  me?" he suddenly gasped out; and walking around the table he laid  his hand on his son's shoulder.  "There's nothing you can't tell  me, my boy."  

"It's not that.  Why do you make it so hard for me?" Ronald  broke out with passion.  "You must have known this was sure to  happen sooner or later."  

"Happen?  What was sure to hap—?"  Mr. Grew's question  wavered on his lip and passed into a tremulous laugh.  "Is it  something * I've* done that you don't approve of?  Is it—is it  *  the Buckle* you're ashamed of, Ronald Grew?"  

Ronald laughed too, impatiently.  "The Buckle?  No, I'm not  ashamed of the Buckle; not any more than you are," he returned with  a sudden bright flush.  "But I'm ashamed of all I owe to it—all I  owe to you—when—when—"  He broke off and took a few distracted  steps across the room.  "You might make this easier for me," he  protested, turning back to his father.  

"Make what easier?  I know less and less what you're driving  at," Mr. Grew groaned.  

Ronald's walk had once more brought him beneath the photograph  on the wall.  He lifted his head for a moment and looked at it;  then he looked again at Mr. Grew.  

"Do you suppose I haven't always known?"  

"Known—?"  

"Even before you gave me those letters—after my mother's  death—even before that, I suspected.  I don't know how it began .  . . perhaps from little things you let drop . . . you and she . .  . and resemblances that I couldn't help seeing . . . in myself . .  .  How on earth could you suppose I shouldn't guess?  I always  thought you gave me the letters as a way of telling me—"  

Mr. Grew rose slowly from his chair.  "The letters?   Dolbrowski's letters?"  

Ronald nodded with white lips.  "You must remember giving them  to me the day after the funeral."  

Mr. Grew nodded back.  "Of course.  I wanted you to have  everything your mother valued."  

"Well—how could I help knowing after that?"  

"Knowing * what?"*  Mr. Grew stood staring helplessly at his  son.  Suddenly his look caught at a clue that seemed to confront it  with a deeper bewilderment.  "You thought—you thought those  letters . . . Dolbrowski's letters . . . you thought they meant .  . ."  

"Oh, it wasn't only the letters.  There were so many other  signs.  My love of   music—my—all my feelings about life .  . . and art. . .  And when you gave me the letters I thought you  must mean me to know."  

Mr. Grew had grown quiet.  His lips were firm, and his small  eyes looked out steadily from their creased lids.  

"To know that you were Fortune Dolbrowski's son?"  

Ronald made a mute sign of assent.  

"I see.  And what did you mean to do?"  

"I meant to wait till I could earn my living, and then repay  you . . . as far as I can ever repay you. . .  But now that there's  a chance of my marrying . . . and your generosity overwhelms me .  . . I'm obliged to speak."  

"I see," said Mr. Grew again.  He let himself down into his  chair, looking steadily and not unkindly at the young man.  "Sit  down, Ronald.  Let's talk."  

Ronald made a protesting movement.  "Is anything to be gained  by it?  You can't change me—change what I feel.  The reading of  those letters transformed my whole life—I was a boy till then:  they made a man of me.  From that moment I understood myself."  He  paused, and then looked up at Mr. Grew's face.  "Don't imagine I  don't appreciate your kindness—your extraordinary generosity.  But  I can't go through life in disguise.  And I want you to know that  I have not won Daisy under false pretences—"  

Mr. Grew started up with the first expletive Ronald had ever  heard on his lips.  

"You damned young fool, you, you haven't * told* her—?"  

Ronald raised his head quickly.  "Oh, you don't know her, sir!   She thinks no worse of me for knowing my secret.  She is above and  beyond all such conventional prejudices.  She's * proud* of my  parentage—" he straightened his slim young shoulders—"as I'm  proud of it . . . yes, sir, proud of it. . ."  

Mr. Grew sank back into his seat with a dry laugh.  "Well, you  ought to be.  You come of good stock.  And you're father's son,  every inch of you!"  He laughed again, as though the humor of the  situation grew on him with its closer contemplation.  

"Yes, I've always felt that," Ronald murmured, flushing.  

"Your father's son, and no mistake."  Mr. Grew leaned forward.   "You're the son of as big a fool as yourself.  And here he sits,  Ronald Grew."  

The young man's flush deepened to crimson; but Mr. Grew  checked his reply with a decisive gesture.  "Here he sits, with all  your young nonsense still alive in him.  Don't you see the  likeness?  If you don't, I'll tell you the story of those letters."  

Ronald stared.  "What do you mean?  Don't they tell their own  story?"  

"I supposed they did when I gave them to you; but you've given  it a twist that needs straightening out."  Mr. Grew squared his  elbows on the table, and looked at the young man across the gift-books and the dyed pampas grass.  "I wrote all the letters that  Dolbrowski answered."  

Ronald gave back his look in frowning perplexity.  "You wrote  them?  I don't understand.  His letters are all addressed to my  mother."  

"Yes.  And he thought he was corresponding with her."  

"But my mother—what did she think?"  

Mr. Grew hesitated, puckering his thick lids.  "Well, I guess  she kinder thought it was a joke.  Your mother didn't think about  things much."  

Ronald continued to bend a puzzled frown on the question.  "I  don't understand," he reiterated.  

Mr. Grew cleared his throat with a nervous laugh.  "Well, I  don't know as you ever will—* quite*.  But this is the way it  came about.  I had a toughish time of it when I was young.  Oh, I  don't mean so much the fight I had to put up to make my way—there  was always plenty of fight in me.  But inside of myself it was  kinder lonesome.  And the outside didn't attract callers."  He  laughed again, with an apologetic gesture toward his broad blinking  face.  "When I went round with the other young fellows I was always  the forlorn hope—the one that had to eat the drumsticks and dance  with the left-overs.  As sure as there was a blighter at a picnic  I had to swing her, and feed her, and drive her home.  And all the  time I was mad after all the things you've got—poetry and music  and all the joy-forever business.  So there were the pair of us—my  face and my imagination—chained together, and fighting, and hating  each other like poison.  

"Then your mother came along and took pity on me.  It sets up  a gawky fellow to   find a girl who ain't ashamed to be seen  walking with him Sundays.  And I was grateful to your mother, and  we got along first-rate.  Only I couldn't say things to her—and  she couldn't answer.  Well—one day, a few months after we were  married, Dolbrowski came to New York, and the whole place went wild  about him.  I'd never heard any good music, but I'd always had an  inkling of what it must be like, though I couldn't tell you to this  day how I knew.  Well, your mother read about him in the papers  too, and she thought it'd be the swagger thing to go to New York  and hear him play—so we went. . .  I'll never forget that evening.   Your mother wasn't easily stirred up—she never seemed to need to  let off steam.  But that night she seemed to understand the way I  felt.  And when we got back to the hotel she said suddenly: 'I'd  like to tell him how I feel.  I'd like to sit right down and write  to him.'  

"'Would you?' I said.  'So would I.'  

"There was paper and pens there before us, and I pulled a  sheet toward me, and began to write.  'Is this what you'd like to  say to him?' I asked her when the letter was done.  And she got  pink and said: 'I don't understand it, but it's lovely.'  And she  copied it out and signed her name to it, and sent it."  

Mr. Grew paused, and Ronald sat silent, with lowered eyes.  

That's how it began; and that's where I thought it would end.   But it didn't, because Dolbrowski answered.  His first letter was  dated January 10, 1872.  I guess you'll find I'm correct.  Well, I  went back to hear him again, and I wrote him after the performance,  and he answered again.  And after that we kept it up for six  months.  Your mother always copied the letters and signed them.   She seemed to think it was a kinder joke, and she was proud of his  answering my letters.  But she never went back to New York to hear  him, though I saved up enough to give her the treat again.  She was  too lazy, and she let me go without her.  I heard him three times  in New York; and in the spring he came to Wingfield and played once  at the Academy.  Your mother was sick and couldn't go; so I went  alone.  After the performance I meant to get one of the directors  to take me in to see him; but when the time came, I just went back  home and wrote to him instead.  And the month after, before he went  back to Europe, he sent your mother a last little note, and that  picture hanging up there. . ."  

Mr. Grew paused again, and both men lifted their eyes to the  photograph.  

"Is that all?" Ronald slowly asked.  

"That's all—every bit of it," said Mr. Grew.  

"And my mother—my mother never even spoke to Dolbrowski?"  

"Never.  She never even saw him but that once in New York at  his concert."  

"The blood crept again to Ronald's face.  "Are you sure of  that, sir?" he asked in a trembling voice.  

"Sure as I am that I'm sitting here.  Why, she was too lazy to  look at his letters after the first novelty wore off.  She copied  the answers just to humor me—but she always said she couldn't  understand what we wrote."  

"But how could you go on with such a correspondence?  It's  incredible!"  

Mr. Grew looked at his son thoughtfully.  "I suppose it is, to  you.  You've only had to put out your hand and get the things I was  starving for—music, and good talk, and ideas.  Those letters gave  me all that.  You've read them, and you know that Dolbrowski was  not only a great musician but a great man.  There was nothing  beautiful he didn't see, nothing fine he didn't feel.  For six  months I breathed his air, and I've lived on it ever since.  Do you  begin to understand a little now?"  

"Yes—a little.  But why write in my mother's name?  Why make  it a sentimental correspondence?"  

Mr. Grew reddened to his bald temples.  "Why, I tell you it  began that way, as a kinder joke.  And when I saw that the first  letter pleased and interested him, I was afraid to tell him—* I  couldn't* tell him.  Do you suppose he'd gone on writing if he'd  ever seen me, Ronny?"  

Ronald suddenly looked at him with new eyes.  "But he must  have thought your letters very beautiful—to go on as he did," he  broke out.  

"Well—I did my best," said Mr. Grew modestly.  

Ronald pursued his idea.  "Where * are* all your letters, I  wonder?  Weren't they returned to you at his death?"  

Mr. Grew laughed.  "Lord, no.  I guess he had trunks and  trunks full of better ones.   I guess Queens and Empresses  wrote to him."  

"I should have liked to see your letters," the young man  insisted.  

"Well, they weren't bad," said Mr. Grew drily.  "But I'll tell  you one thing, Ronny," he added suddenly.  Ronald raised his head  with a quick glance, and Mr. Grew continued: "I'll tell you where  the best of those letters is—it's in * you*.  If it hadn't been  for that one look at life I couldn't have made you what you are.   Oh, I know you've done a good deal of your own making—but I've  been there behind you all the time.  And you'll never know the work  I've spared you and the time I've saved you.  Fortune Dolbrowski  helped me do that.  I never saw things in little again after I'd  looked at 'em with him.  And I tried to give you the big view from  the stars. . .  So that's what became of my letters."  

Mr. Grew paused, and for a long time Ronald sat motionless,  his elbows on the table, his face dropped on his hands.  

Suddenly Mr. Grew's touch fell on his shoulder.  

"Look at here, Ronald Grew—do you want me to tell you how  you're feeling at this minute?  Just a mite let down, after all, at  the idea that you ain't the romantic figure you'd got to think  yourself. . .  Well, that's natural enough, too; but I'll tell you  what it proves.  It proves you're my son right enough, if any more  proof was needed.  For it's just the kind of fool nonsense I used  to feel at your age—and if there's anybody here to laugh at it's  myself, and not you.  And you can laugh at me just as much as you  like. . ."
