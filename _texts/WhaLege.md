#   *TALES OF MEN*  
  THE LEGEND  

    
## I

  ARTHUR BERNALD could never afterward recall just when the first  conjecture flashed on him: oddly enough, there was no record of it  in the agitated jottings of his diary.  But, as it seemed to him in  retrospect, he had always felt that the queer man at the Wades'  must be John Pellerin, if only for the negative reason that he  couldn't imaginably be any one else.  It was impossible, in the  confused pattern of the century's intellectual life, to fit the  stranger in anywhere, save in the big gap which, some five and  twenty years earlier, had been left by Pellerin's unaccountable  disappearance; and conversely, such a man as the Wades' visitor  couldn't have lived for sixty years without filling, somewhere in  space, a nearly equivalent void.  

At all events, it was certainly not to Doctor Wade or to his  mother that Bernald owed the hint: the good unconscious Wades, one  of whose chief charms in the young man's eyes was that they  remained so robustly untainted by Pellerinism, in spite of the fact  that Doctor Wade's younger brother, Howland, was among its most  impudently flourishing high-priests.  

The incident had begun by Bernald's running across Doctor  Robert Wade one hot summer night at the University Club, and by  Wade's saying, in the tone of unprofessional laxity which the  shadowy stillness of the place invited: "I got hold of a queer fish  at St. Martin's the other day — case of heat-prostration picked up  in Central Park.  When we'd patched him up I found he had nowhere  to go, and not a dollar in his pocket, and I sent him down to our  place at Portchester to re-build."  

The opening roused his hearer's attention.  Bob Wade had an  odd unformulated sense of values that Bernald had learned to trust.  

"What sort of chap?  Young or old?"  

"Oh, every age — full of years, and yet with a lot left.  He  called himself sixty on the books."  

"Sixty's a good age for some kinds of living.  And age is of  course purely subjective.  How has he used his sixty years?"  

"Well — part of them in educating himself, apparently.  He's a  scholar — humanities, languages, and so forth."  

"Oh — decayed gentleman," Bernald murmured, disappointed.  

"Decayed?  Not much!" cried the doctor with his accustomed  literalness.  "I only mentioned that side of Winterman — his name's  Winterman — because it was the side my mother noticed first.  I  suppose women generally do.  But it's only a part — a small part.   The man's the big thing."  

"Really big?"  

"Well — there again. . . .  When I took him down to the  country, looking rather like a tramp from a 'Shelter,' with an  untrimmed beard, and a suit of reach-me-downs he'd slept round the  Park in for a week, I felt sure my mother'd carry the silver up to  her room, and send for the gardener's dog to sleep in the hall the  first night.  But she didn't."  

"I see.  'Women and children love him.'  Oh, Wade!" Bernald  groaned.  

"Not a bit of it!  You're out again.  We don't love him,  either of us.  But we *feel* him — the air's charged with him.   You'll see."  

And Bernald agreed that he *would* see, the following  Sunday.  Wade's inarticulate attempts to characterize the stranger  had struck his friend.  The human revelation had for Bernald a  poignant and ever-renewed interest, which his trade, as the  dramatic critic of a daily paper, had hitherto failed to  discourage.  And he knew that Bob Wade, simple and undefiled by  literature — Bernald's specific affliction — had a free and personal  way of judging men, and the diviner's knack of reaching their  hidden   springs.  During the days that followed, the young  doctor gave Bernald farther details about John Winterman: details  not of fact — for in that respect his visitor's reticence was  baffling — but of impression.  It appeared that Winterman, while  lying insensible in the Park, had been robbed of the few dollars he  possessed; and on leaving the hospital, still weak and half-blind,  he had quite simply and unprotestingly accepted the Wades' offer to  give him shelter till such time as he should be strong enough to go  to work.  

"But what's his work?" Bernald interjected.  "Hasn't he at  least told you that?"  

"Well, writing.  Some kind of writing."  Doctor Bob always  became vague and clumsy when he approached the confines of  literature.  "He means to take it up again as soon as his eyes get  right."  

Bernald groaned.  "Oh, Lord — that finishes him; and *me!*   He's looking for a publisher, of course — he wants a 'favourable  notice.'  I won't come!"  

"He hasn't written a line for twenty years."  

"A line of *what?*  What kind of literature can one keep  corked up for twenty years?"  

Wade surprised him.  "The real kind, I should say.  But I  don't know Winterman's line," the doctor added.  "He speaks of the  things he used to write merely as 'stuff that wouldn't sell.'  He  has a wonderfully confidential way of *not* telling one things.   But he says he'll have to do something for his living as soon as  his eyes are patched up, and that writing is the only trade he  knows.  The queer thing is that he seems pretty sure of selling  *now*.  He even talked of buying the bungalow of us, with an acre or  two about it."  

"The bungalow?  What's that?"  

"The studio down by the shore that we built for Howland when  he thought he meant to paint."  (Howland Wade, as Bernald knew, had  experienced various "calls.")  "Since he's taken to writing  nobody's been near it.  I offered it to Winterman, and he camps  there — cooks his meals, does his own house-keeping, and never comes  up to the house except in the evenings, when he joins us on the  verandah, in the dark, and smokes while my mother knits."  

"A discreet visitor, eh?"  

"More than he need be.  My mother actually wanted him to stay  on in the house — in her pink chintz room.  Think of it!  But he  says houses smother him.  I take it he's lived for years in the  open."  

"In the open where?"  

"I can't make out, except that it was somewhere in the East.   'East of everything — beyond the day-spring.  In places not on the  map.'  That's the way he put it; and when I said: 'You've been an  explorer, then?' he smiled in his beard, and answered: 'Yes; that's  it — an explorer.'  Yet he doesn't strike me as a man of action:  hasn't the hands or the eyes."  

"What sort of hands and eyes has he?"  

Wade reflected.  His range of observation was not large, but  within its limits it was exact and could give an account of itself.  

"He's worked a lot with his hands, but that's not what they  were made for.  I should say they were extraordinarily delicate  conductors of sensation.  And his eye — his eye too.  He hasn't used  it to dominate people: he didn't care to.  He simply looks through  'em all like windows.  Makes me feel like the fellows who think  they're made of glass.  The mitigating circumstance is that he  seems to see such a glorious landscape through me."  Wade grinned  at the thought of serving such a purpose.  

"I see.  I'll come on Sunday and be looked through!" Bernald  cried.  

      
##                                   II  

  BERNALD came on two successive Sundays; and the second time he  lingered till the Tuesday.  

"Here he comes!" Wade had said, the first evening, as the two  young men, with Wade's mother sat in the sultry dusk, with the  Virginian creeper drawing, between the verandah arches, its black  arabesques against a moon-lined sky.  

In the darkness Bernald heard a step on the gravel, and saw  the red flit of a cigar through the shrubs.  Then a loosely-moving  figure obscured the patch of sky between the creepers, and the red  spark became the centre of a dim bearded face, in which Bernald  discerned only a broad white gleam of forehead.  

It was the young man's subsequent impression that Winterman  had not spoken   much that first evening; at any rate,  Bernald himself remembered chiefly what the Wades had said.  And  this was the more curious because he had come for the purpose of  studying their visitor, and because there was nothing to divert him  from that purpose in Wade's halting communications or his mother's  artless comments.  He reflected afterward that there must have been  a mysteriously fertilizing quality in the stranger's silence: it  had brooded over their talk like a large moist cloud above a dry  country.  

Mrs. Wade, apparently apprehensive lest her son should have  given Bernald an exaggerated notion of their visitor's importance,  had hastened to qualify it before the latter appeared.  

"He's not what you or Howland would call  intellectual — "(Bernald writhed at the coupling of the names) — "not  in the least *literary;* though he told Bob he used to write.  I  don't think, though, it could have been what Howland would call  writing."  Mrs. Wade always mentioned her younger son with a  reverential drop of the voice.  She viewed literature much as she  did Providence, as an inscrutably mystery; and she spoke of Howland  as a dedicated being, set apart to perform secret rites within the  veil of the sanctuary.  

"I shouldn't say he had a quick mind," she continued,  reverting apologetically to Winterman.  "Sometimes he hardly seems  to follow what we're saying.  But he's got such sound ideas — when  he does speak he's never silly.  And clever people sometimes  *are*, don't you think so?"  Bernald groaned an unqualified assent.   "And he's so capable.  The other day something went wrong with the  kitchen range, just as I was expecting some friends of Bob's for  dinner; and do you know, when Mr. Winterman heard we were in  trouble, he came and took a look, and knew at once what to do?  I  told him it was a dreadful pity he wasn't married!"    

Close on midnight, when the session on the verandah ended, and  the two young men were strolling down to the bungalow at  Winterman's side, Bernald's mind reverted to the image of the  fertilizing cloud.  There was something brooding, pregnant, in the  silent presence beside him: he had, in place of any circumscribing  impression of the individual, a large hovering sense of manifold  latent meanings.  And he felt a distinct thrill of relief when,  half-way down the lawn, Doctor Bob was checked by a voice that  called him back to the telephone.  

"Now I'll be with him alone!" thought Bernald, with a throb  like a lover's.  

In the low-ceilinged bungalow Winterman had to grope for the  lamp on his desk, and as its light struck up into his face  Bernald's sense of the rareness of his opportunity increased.  He  couldn't have said why, for the face, with its ridged brows, its  shabby greyish beard and blunt Socratic nose, made no direct appeal  to the eye.  It seemed rather like a stage on which remarkable  things might be enacted, like some shaggy moorland landscape  dependent for form and expression on the clouds rolling over it,  and the bursts of light between; and one of these flashed out in  the smile with which Winterman, as if in answer to his companion's  thought, said simply, as he turned to fill his pipe: "Now we'll  talk."  

So he'd known all along that they hadn't yet — and had guessed  that, with Bernald, one might!  

The young man's glow of pleasure was so intense that it left  him for a moment unable to meet the challenge; and in that moment  he felt the brush of something winged and summoning.  His spirit  rose to it with a rush; but just as he felt himself poised between  the ascending pinions, the door opened and Bob Wade plunged in.  

"Too bad!  I'm so sorry!  It was from Howland, to say he can't  come to-morrow after all."  The doctor panted out his news with  honest grief.  

"I tried my best to pull it off for you; and my brother  *wants* to come — he's keen to talk to you and see what he can do.   But you see he's so tremendously in demand.  He'll try for another  Sunday later on."  

Winterman nodded with a whimsical gesture.  "Oh, he'll find me  here.  I shall work my time out slowly."  He pointed to the  scattered sheets on the kitchen table which formed his writing  desk.  

"Not slowly enough to suit us," Wade answered hospitably.   "Only, if Howland could have come he might have given you a tip or  two — put you on the right track — shown you how to get in touch with  the public."  

Winterman, his hands in his sagging   pockets, lounged  against the bare pine walls, twisting his pipe under his beard.   "Does your brother enjoy the privilege of that contact?" he  questioned gravely.  

Wade stared a little.  "Oh, of course Howland's not what you'd  call a *popular* writer; he despises that kind of thing.  But  whatever he says goes with — well, with the chaps that count; and  every one tells me he's written *the* book on Pellerin.  You must  read it when you get back your eyes."  He paused, as if to let the  name sink in, but Winterman drew at his pipe with a blank face.   "You must have heard of Pellerin, I suppose?" the doctor continued.   "I've never read a word of him myself: he's too big a proposition  for *me*.  But one can't escape the talk about him.  I have him  crammed down my throat even in hospital.  The internes read him at  the clinics.  He tumbles out of the nurses' pockets.  The patients  keep him under their pillows.  Oh, with most of them, of course,  it's just a craze, like the last new game or puzzle: they don't  understand him in the least.  Howland says that even now, twenty-five years after his death, and with his books in everybody's  hands, there are not twenty people who really understand Pellerin;  and Howland ought to know, if anybody does.  He's — what's their  great word? — *interpreted* him.  You must get Howland to put you  through a course of Pellerin."  

And as the young men, having taken leave of Winterman,  retraced their way across the lawn, Wade continued to develop the  theme of his brother's accomplishments.  

"I wish I *could* get Howland to take an interest in  Winterman: this is the third Sunday he's chucked us.  Of course he  does get bored with people consulting him about their writings — but  I believe if he could only talk to Winterman he'd see something in  him, as we do.  And it would be such a god-send to the poor man to  have some one to advise him about his work.  I'm going to make a  desperate effort to get Howland here next Sunday."    

It was then that Bernald vowed to himself that he would return  the next Sunday at all costs.  He hardly knew whether he was  prompted by the impulse to shield Winterman from Howland Wade's  ineptitude, or by the desire to see the latter abandon himself to  the full shamelessness of its display; but of one fact he was  blissfully assured — and that was of the existence in Winterman of  some quality which would provoke Howland to the amplest exercise of  his fatuity.  "How he'll draw him — how he'll draw him!" Bernald  chuckled, with a security the more unaccountable that his one  glimpse of Winterman had shown the latter only as a passive subject  for experimentation; and he felt himself avenged in advance for the  injury of Howland Wade's existence.  

      
##   III  

  THAT this hope was to be frustrated Bernald learned from  Howland Wade's own lips, the day before the two young men were to  meet at Portchester.  

"I can't really, my dear fellow," the Interpreter lisped,  passing a polished hand over the faded smoothness of his face.   "Oh, an authentic engagement, I assure you: otherwise, to oblige  old Bob I'd submit cheerfully to looking over his foundling's  literature.  But I'm pledged this week to the Pellerin Society of  Kenosha: I had a hand in founding it, and for two years now they've  been patiently waiting for a word from me — the *Fiat Lux*, so to  speak.  You see it's a ministry, Bernald — I assure you, I look upon  my calling quite religiously."  

As Bernald listened, his disappointment gradually changed to  relief.  Howland, on trial, always turned out to be too  insufferable, and the pleasure of watching his antics was  invariably lost in the impulse to put a sanguinary end to them.  

"If he'd only keep his beastly pink hands off Pellerin,"  Bernald groaned, thinking of the thick manuscript condemned to  perpetual incarceration in his own desk by the publication of  Howland's "definitive" work on the great man.  One couldn't,  * after * Howland Wade, expose one's self to the derision of writing  about Pellerin: the eagerness with which Wade's book had been  devoured proved, not that the public had enough appetite for  another, but simply that, for a stomach so undiscriminating,  anything better than Wade had given it would be too good.  And  Bernald, in the confidence that his own work was open to this  objection, had stoically locked it up.  Yet if he had resigned his  exasperated intelligence to the fact that Wade's book existed,       and was already passing into the immortality of  perpetual republication, he could not, after repeated trials,  adjust himself to the author's talk about Pellerin.  When Wade  wrote of the great dead he was egregious, but in conversation he  was familiar and fond.  It might have been supposed that one of the  beauties of Pellerin's hidden life and mysterious taking off would  have been to guard him from the fingering of anecdote; but  biographers like Howland Wade were born to rise above such  obstacles.  He might be vague or inaccurate in dealing with the few  recorded events of his subject's life; but when he left fact for  conjecture no one had a firmer footing.  Whole chapters in his  volume were constructed in the conditional mood and packed with  hypothetical detail; and in talk, by the very law of the process,  hypothesis became affirmation, and he was ready to tell you  confidentially the exact circumstances of Pellerin's death, and of  the "distressing incident" leading up to it.  Bernald himself not  only questioned the form under which this incident was shaping  itself before posterity, but the mere radical fact of its  occurrence: he had never been able to discover any break in the  dense cloud enveloping Pellerin's later life and its mysterious  termination.  He had gone away — that was all that any of them knew:  he who had so little, at any time, been with them or of them; and  his going had so slightly stirred the public consciousness that  even the subsequent news of his death, laconically imparted from  afar, had dropped unheeded into the universal scrap-basket, to be  long afterward fished out, with all its details missing, when some  enquiring spirit first became aware, by chance encounter with a  two-penny volume in a London book-stall, not only that such a man  as John Pellerin had died, but that he had ever lived, or written.  

It need hardly be noted that Howland Wade had not been the  pioneer in question: his had been the wiser part of swelling the  chorus when it rose, and gradually drowning the other voices by his  own insistent note.  He had pitched the note so screamingly, and  held it so long, that he was now the accepted authority on  Pellerin, not only in the land which had given birth to his genius  but in the Europe which had first acclaimed it; and it was the  central point of pain in Bernald's sense of the situation that a  man who had so yearned for silence as Pellerin should have his  grave piped over by such a voice as Wade's.  

Bernald's talk with the Interpreter had revived this ache to  the momentary exclusion of other sensations; and he was still sore  with it when, the next afternoon, he arrived at Portchester for his  second Sunday with the Wades.  

At the station he had the surprise of seeing Winterman's face  on the platform, and of hearing from him that Doctor Bob had been  called away to assist at an operation in a distant town.  

"Mrs. Wade wanted to put you off, but I believe the message  came too late; so she sent me down to break the news to you," said  Winterman, holding out his hand.  

Perhaps because they were the first conventional words that  Bernald had heard him speak, the young man was struck by the relief  his intonation gave them.  

"She wanted to send a carriage," Winterman added, "but I told  her we'd walk back through the woods."  He looked at Bernald with  a sudden kindness that flushed the young man with pleasure.  

"Are you strong enough?  It's not too far?"  

"Oh, no.  I'm pulling myself together.  Getting back to work  is the slowest part of the business: not on account of my eyes — I  can use them now, though not for reading; but some of the links  between things are missing.  It's a kind of broken spectrum . . .  here, that boy will look after your bag."  

The walk through the woods remained in Bernald's memory as an  enchanted hour.  He used the word literally, as descriptive of the  way in which Winterman's contact changed the face of things, or  perhaps restored them to their primitive meanings.  And the scene  they traversed — one of those little untended woods that still, in  America, fringe the tawdry skirts of civilization — acquired, as a  background to Winterman, the hush of a spot aware of transcendent  visitings.  Did he talk, or did he make Bernald talk?  The young  man never knew.  He recalled only a sense of lightness and  liberation, as if the hard walls of individuality had melted, and  he were merged in the poet's deeper interfusion, yet without losing  the least sharp edge of self.  This general impression resolved  itself afterward into the   sense of Winterman's wide  elemental range.  His thought encircled things like the horizon at  sea.  He didn't, as it happened, touch on lofty themes — Bernald was  gleefully aware that, to Howland Wade, their talk would hardly have  been Talk at all — but Winterman's mind, applied to lowly topics,  was like a powerful lens that brought out microscopic delicacies  and differences.  

The lack of Sunday trains kept Doctor Bob for two days on the  scene of his surgical duties, and during those two days Bernald  seized every moment of communion with his friend's guest.   Winterman, as Wade had said, was reticent as to his personal  affairs, or rather as to the practical and material conditions to  which the term is generally applied.  But it was evident that, in  Winterman's case, the usual classification must be reversed, and  that the discussion of ideas carried one much farther into his  intimacy than any specific acquaintance with the incidents of his  life.  

"That's exactly what Howland Wade and his tribe have never  understood about Pellerin: that it's much less important to know  how, or even why, he disapp — "  

Bernald pulled himself up with a jerk, and turned to look full  at his companion.  It was late on the Monday evening, and the two  men, after an hour's chat on the verandah to the tune of Mrs.  Wade's knitting-needles, had bidden their hostess good-night and  strolled back to the bungalow together.  

"Come and have a pipe before you turn in," Winterman had said;  and they had sat on together till midnight, with the door of the  bungalow open on a heaving moonlit bay, and summer insects bumping  against the chimney of the lamp.  Winterman had just bent down to  re-fill his pipe from the jar on the table, and Bernald, jerking  about to catch him in the yellow circle of lamplight, sat  speechless, staring at a fact that seemed suddenly to have  substituted itself for Winterman's face, or rather to have taken on  its features.  

"No, they never saw that Pellerin's ideas *were* Pellerin.  . . ."  He continued to stare at Winterman.  "Just as this man's  ideas are — why, *are* Pellerin!"  

The thought uttered itself in a kind of inner shout, and  Bernald started upright with the violent impact of his conclusion.   Again and again in the last forty-eight hours he had exclaimed to  himself: "This is as good as Pellerin."  Why hadn't he said till  now: "This *is* Pellerin"? . . .  Surprising as the answer was,  he had no choice but to take it.  He hadn't said so simply because  Winterman was *better than Pellerin* — that there was so much more  of him, so to speak.  Yes; but — it came to Bernald in a flash —   wouldn't there by this time have been any amount more of Pellerin?  . . .  The young man felt actually dizzy with the thought.  That  was it — there was the solution of the haunting problem!  This man  was Pellerin, and more than Pellerin!  It was so fantastic and yet  so unanswerable that he burst into a sudden startled laugh.  

Winterman, at the same moment, brought his palm down with a  sudden crash on the pile of manuscript covering the desk.  

"What's the matter?" Bernald gasped.  

"My match wasn't out.  In another minute the destruction of  the library of Alexandria would have been a trifle compared to what  you'd have seen."  Winterman, with his large deep laugh, shook out  the smouldering sheets.  "And I should have been a pensioner on  Doctor Bob the Lord knows how much longer!"  

Bernald pulled himself together.  "You've really got going  again?  The thing's actually getting into shape?"  

"This particular thing *is* in shape.  I drove at it hard  all last week, thinking our friend's brother would be down on  Sunday, and might look it over."  

Bernald had to repress the tendency to another wild laugh.  

"Howland — you meant to show *Howland* what you've done?"  

Winterman, looming against the moonlight, slowly turned a  dusky shaggy head toward him.  

"Isn't it a good thing to do?"  

Bernald wavered, torn between loyalty to his friends and the  grotesqueness of answering in the affirmative.  After all, it was  none of his business to furnish Winterman with an estimate of  Howland Wade.  

"Well, you see, you've never told me what your line *is*,"  he answered, temporizing.  

"No, because nobody's ever told *me*.  It's exactly what I  want to find out," said the other genially.  

"And you expect Wade — ?"    

"Why, I gathered from our good Doctor that it's his trade.   Doesn't he explain — interpret?"  

"In his own domain — which is Pellerinism."  

Winterman gazed out musingly upon the moon-touched dusk of  waters.  "And what *is* Pellerinism?" he asked.  

Bernald sprang to his feet with a cry.  "Ah, I don't know — but  you're Pellerin!"  

They stood for a minute facing each other, among the uncertain  swaying shadows of the room, with the sea breathing through it as  something immense and inarticulate breathed through young Bernald's  thoughts; then Winterman threw up his arms with a humorous gesture.  

"Don't shoot!" he said.  

      
##                                   IV  

  DAWN found them there, and the risen sun laid its beams on the  rough floor of the bungalow, before either of the men was conscious  of the passage of time.  Bernald, vaguely trying to define his own  state in retrospect, could only phrase it: "I floated . . .  floated. . . ."  

The gist of fact at the core of the extraordinary experience  was simply that John Pellerin, twenty-five years earlier, had  voluntarily disappeared, causing the rumour of his death to be  reported to an inattentive world; and that now he had come back to  see what that world had made of him.  

"You'll hardly believe it of me; I hardly believe it of  myself; but I went away in a rage of disappointment, of wounded  pride — no, vanity!  I don't know which cut deepest — the sneers or  the silence — but between them, there wasn't an inch of me that  wasn't raw.  I had just the one thing in me: the message, the cry,  the revelation.  But nobody saw and nobody listened.  Nobody wanted  what I had to give.  I was like a poor devil of a tramp looking for  shelter on a bitter night, in a town with every door bolted and all  the windows dark.  And suddenly I felt that the easiest thing would  be to lie down and go to sleep in the snow.  Perhaps I'd a vague  notion that if they found me there at daylight, frozen stiff, the  pathetic spectacle might produce a reaction, a feeling of remorse.  . . .  So I took care to be found!  Well, a good many thousand  people die every day on the face of the globe; and I soon  discovered that I was simply one of the thousands; and when I made  that discovery I really died — and stayed dead a year or two. . . .   When I came to life again I was off on the under side of the world,  in regions unaware of what we know as 'the public.'  Have you any  notion how it shifts the point of view to wake under new  constellations?  I advise any who's been in love with a woman under  Cassiopeia to go and think about her under the Southern Cross. . .  .  It's the only way to tell the pivotal truths from the others. .  . .  I didn't believe in my theory any less — there was my triumph  and my vindication!  It held out, resisted, measured itself with  the stars.  But I didn't care a snap of my finger whether anybody  else believed in it, or even knew it had been formulated.  It  escaped out of my books — my poor still-born books — like Psyche from  the chrysalis and soared away into the blue, and lived there.  I  knew then how it frees an idea to be ignored; how apprehension  circumscribes and deforms it. . . .  Once I'd learned that, it was  easy enough to turn to and shift for myself.  I was sure now that  my idea would live: the good ones are self-supporting.  I had to learn to be so; and I tried my hand at a  number of things . . . adventurous, menial, commercial. . . .  It's  not a bad thing for a man to have to live his life — and we nearly  all manage to dodge it.  Our first round with the Sphinx may strike  something out of us — a book or a picture or a symphony; and we're  amazed at our feat, and go on letting that first work breed others,  as some animal forms reproduce each other without renewed  fertilization.  So there we are, committed to our first guess at  the riddle; and our works look as like as successive impressions of  the same plate, each with the lines a little fainter; whereas they  ought to be — if we touch earth between times — as different from  each other as those other creatures — jellyfish, aren't they, of a  kind? — where successive generations produce new forms, and it takes  a zoologist to see the hidden likeness. . . .  

"Well, I proved my first guess, off there in the wilds, and it  lived, and grew, and took care of itself.  And I said 'Some day it  will make itself heard; but by that time my atoms will have waltzed  into a new pattern.'   Then, in Cashmere one day, I met a  fellow in a caravan, with a dog-eared book in his pocket.  He said  he never stirred without it — wanted to know where I'd been, never  to have heard of it.  It was *my guess* — in its twentieth  edition! . . .  The globe spun round at that, and all of a sudden  I was under the old stars.  That's the way it happens when the  ballast of vanity shifts!  I'd lived a third of a life out there,  unconscious of human opinion — because I supposed it was unconscious  of *me*.  But now — now!  Oh, it was different.  I wanted to know  what they said. . . .  Not exactly that, either: I wanted to know  *what I'd made them say*.  There's a difference. . . .  And here  I am," said John Pellerin, with a pull at his pipe.  

So much Bernald retained of his companion's actual narrative;  the rest was swept away under the tide of wonder that rose and  submerged him as Pellerin — at some indefinitely later stage of  their talk — picked up his manuscript and began to read.  Bernald  sat opposite, his elbows propped on the table, his eyes fixed on  the swaying waters outside, from which the moon gradually faded,  leaving them to make a denser blackness in the night.  As Pellerin  read, this density of blackness — which never for a moment seemed  inert or unalive — was attenuated by imperceptible degrees, till a  greyish pallour replaced it; then the pallour breathed and  brightened, and suddenly dawn was on the sea.  

Something of the same nature went on in the young man's mind  while he watched and listened.  He was conscious of a gradually  withdrawing light, of an interval of obscurity full of the stir of  invisible forces, and then of the victorious flush of day.  And as  the light rose, he saw how far he had travelled and what wonders  the night had prepared.  Pellerin had been right in saying that his  first idea had survived, had borne the test of time; but he had  given his hearer no hint of the extent to which it had been  enlarged and modified, of the fresh implications it now unfolded.   In a brief flash of retrospection Bernald saw the earlier books  dwindle and fall into their place as mere precursors of this fuller  revelation; then, with a leap of helpless rage, he pictured Howland  Wade's pink hands on the new treasure, and his prophetic feet upon  the lecture platform.

  "IT won't do — oh, he let him down as gently as possible; but  it appears it simply won't do."  

Doctor Bob imparted the ineluctable fact to Bernald while the  two men, accidentally meeting at their club a few nights later, sat  together over the dinner they had immediately agreed to consume in  company.  

Bernald had left Portchester the morning after his strange  discovery, and he and Bob Wade had not seen each other since.  And  now Bernald, moved by an irresistible instinct of postponement, had  waited for his companion to bring up Winterman's name, and had even  executed several conversational diversions in the hope of delaying  its mention.  For how could one talk of Winterman with the thought  of Pellerin swelling one's breast?  

"Yes; the very day Howland got back from Kenosha I brought the  manuscript to town, and got him to read it.  And yesterday evening  I nailed him, and dragged an answer out of him."  

"Then Howland hasn't seen Winterman yet?"  

"No.  He said: 'Before you let him loose on me I'll go over  the stuff, and see if it's at all worth while.'"  

Bernald drew a freer breath.  "And he found it wasn't?"  

"Between ourselves, he found it was of no account at all.   Queer, isn't it, when the *man* . . . but of course literature's  another proposition.  Howland says it's one of the cases where an  idea might seem original and striking if one didn't happen to be  able to trace its descent.  And this is straight out of bosh — by  Pellerin. . . .  Yes: Pellerin.  It seems that everything in the  article that isn't pure nonsense is just Pellerinism.  Howland  thinks poor Winterman must have been tremendously struck by  Pellerin's writings, and have lived too much out of the world to  know that they've become the text-books of modern thought.   Otherwise, of course, he'd have taken more trouble to disguise his  plagiarisms."  

"I see," Bernald mused.  "Yet you say there *is* an original  element?"  

"Yes; but unluckily it's no good."  

"It's not — conceivably — in any sense a development of  Pellerin's idea: a logical step farther?"    

*"Logical?*  Howland says it's twaddle at white heat."  

Bernald sat silent, divided between the fierce satisfaction of  seeing the Interpreter rush upon his fate, and the despair of  knowing that the state of mind he represented was indestructible.   Then both emotions were swept away on a wave of pure joy, as he  reflected that now, at last, Howland Wade had given him back John  Pellerin.  

The possession was one he did not mean to part with lightly;  and the dread of its being torn from him constrained him to  extraordinary precautions.  

"You've told Winterman, I suppose?  How did he take it?"  

"Why, unexpectedly, as he does most things.  You can never  tell which way he'll jump.  I thought he'd take a high tone, or  else laugh it off; but he did neither.  He seemed awfully cast  down.  I wished myself well out of the job when I saw how cut up he  was."  Bernald thrilled at the words.  Pellerin had shared his  pang, then — the "old woe of the world" at the perpetuity of human  dulness!  

"But what did he say to the charge of plagiarism — if you made  it?"  

"Oh, I told him straight out what Howland said.  I thought it  fairer.  And his answer to that was the rummest part of all."  

"What was it?" Bernald questioned, with a tremor.  

"He said: 'That's queer, for I've never read Pellerin.'"  

Bernald drew a deep breath of ecstasy.  "Well — and I suppose  you believed him?"  

"I believed him, because I know him.  But the public won't —   the critics won't.  And if it's a pure coincidence it's just as bad  for him as if it were a straight steal — isn't it?"  

Bernald sighed his acquiescence.  

"It bothers me awfully," Wade continued, knitting his kindly  brows, "because I could see what a blow it was to him.  He's got to  earn his living, and I don't suppose he knows how to do anything  else.  At his age it's hard to start fresh.  I put that to  Howland — asked him if there wasn't a chance he might do better if  he only had a little encouragement.  I can't help feeling he's got  the essential thing in him.  But of course I'm no judge when it  comes to books.  And Howland says it would be cruel to give him any  hope."  Wade paused, turned his wineglass about under a meditative  stare, and then leaned across the table toward Bernald.  "Look  here — do you know what I've proposed to Winterman?  That he should  come to town with me to-morrow and go in the evening to hear  Howland lecture to the Uplift Club.  They're to meet at Mrs.  Beecher Bain's, and Howland is to repeat the lecture that he gave  the other day before the Pellerin Society at Kenosha.  It will give  Winterman a chance to get some notion of what Pellerin *was:*  he'll get it much straighter from Howland than if he tried to  plough through Pellerin's books.  And then afterward — as if  accidentally — I thought I might bring him and Howland together.  If  Howland could only see him and hear him talk, there's no knowing  what might come of it.  He couldn't help feeling the man's force,  as we do; and he might give him a pointer — tell him what line to  take.  Anyhow, it would please Winterman, and take the edge off his  disappointment.  I saw that as soon as I proposed it."    

"Some one who's never heard of Pellerin?"  

Mrs. Beecher Bain, large, smiling, diffuse, reached out  parenthetically from the incoming throng on her threshold to waylay  Bernald with the question as he was about to move past her in the  wake of his companion.  

"Oh, keep straight on, Mr. Winterman!" she interrupted herself  to call after the latter.  "Into the back drawing-room, please!   And remember, you're to sit next to me — in the corner on the left,  close under the platform."  

She renewed her interrogative clutch on Bernald's sleeve.   "Most curious!  Doctor Wade has been telling me all about him — how  remarkable you all think him.  And it's actually true that he's  never heard of Pellerin?  Of course as soon as Doctor Wade told me  *that*, I said 'Bring him!'  It will be so extraordinarily  interesting to watch the first impression. — Yes, do follow him,  dear Mr. Bernald, and be sure that you and he secure the seats next  to me.  Of course Alice Fosdick insists on being with us.  She was  wild with excitement when I told her she was to meet some one who'd  never heard of Pellerin!"  

On the indulgent lips of Mrs. Beecher Bain conjecture speedily  passed into affirmation;    and as Bernald's companion, broad  and shaggy in his visibly new evening clothes, moved down the  length of the crowded rooms, he was already, to the ladies drawing  aside their skirts to let him pass, the interesting Huron of the  fable.  

How far he was aware of the character ascribed to him it was  impossible for Bernald to discover.  He was as unconscious as a  tree or a cloud, and his observer had never known any one so alive  to human contacts and yet so secure from them.  But the scene was  playing such a lively tune on Bernald's own sensibilities that for  the moment he could not adjust himself to the probable effect it  produced on his companion.  The young man, of late, had made but  rare appearances in the group of which Mrs. Beecher Bain was one of  the most indefatigable hostesses, and the Uplift Club the chief  medium of expression.  To a critic, obliged by his trade to  cultivate convictions, it was the essence of luxury to leave them  at home in his hours of ease; and Bernald gave his preference to  circles in which less finality of judgment prevailed, and it was  consequently less embarrassing to be caught without an opinion.  

But in his fresher days he had known the spell of the Uplift  Club and the thrill of moving among the Emancipated; and he felt an  odd sense of rejuvenation as he looked at the rows of faces packed  about the embowered platform from which Howland Wade was presently  to hand down the eternal verities.  Many of these countenances  belonged to the old days, when the gospel of Pellerin was unknown,  and it required considerable intellectual courage to avow one's  acceptance of the very doctrines he had since demolished.  The  latter moral revolution seemed to have been accepted as  submissively as a change in hair-dressing; and it even struck  Bernald that, in the case of many of the assembled ladies, their  convictions were rather newer than their clothes.  

One of the most interesting examples of this facility of  adaptation was actually, in the person of Miss Alice Fosdick,  brushing his elbow with exotic amulets, and enveloping him in  Arabian odours, as she leaned forward to murmur her sympathetic  sense of the situation.  Miss Fosdick, who was one of the most  advanced exponents of Pellerinism, had large eyes and a plaintive  mouth, and Bernald had always fancied that she might have been  pretty if she had not been perpetually explaining things.  

"Yes, I know — Isabella Bain told me all about him.  (He can't  hear us, can he?)  And I wonder if you realize how remarkably  interesting it is that we should have such an opportunity *now* —   I mean the opportunity to see the impression of Pellerinism on a  perfectly fresh mind.  (You must introduce him as soon as the  lecture's over.)  I explained that to Isabella as soon as she  showed me Doctor Wade's note.  Of course you see why, don't you?"   Bernald made a faint motion of acquiescence, which she instantly  swept aside.  "At least I think I can *make you see why*.  (If  you're sure he can't hear?)  Why, it's just this — Pellerinism is in  danger of becoming a truism.  Oh, it's an awful thing to say!  But  then I'm not afraid of saying awful things!  I rather believe it's  my mission.  What I mean is, that we're getting into the way of  taking Pellerin for granted — as we do the air we breathe.  We don't  sufficiently lead our *conscious life* in him — we're gradually  letting him become subliminal."  She swayed closer to the young  man, and he saw that she was making a graceful attempt to throw her  explanatory net over his companion, who, evading Mrs. Bain's  hospitable signal, had cautiously wedged himself into a seat  between Bernald and the wall.  

*"Did* you hear what I was saying, Mr. Winterman?  (Yes, I  know who you are, of course!)  Oh, well, I don't really mind if you  did.  I was talking about you — about you and Pellerin.  I was  explaining to Mr. Bernald that what we need at this very minute is  a Pellerin revival; and we need some one like you — to whom his  message comes as a wonderful new interpretation of life — to lead  the revival, and rouse us out of our apathy. . . .  

"You see," she went on winningly, "it's not only the big  public that needs it (of course *their* Pellerin isn't ours!)   It's we, his disciples, his interpreters, who discovered him and  gave him to the world — we, the Chosen People, the Custodians of the  Sacred Books, as Howland Wade calls us — it's *we*, who are in  perpetual danger of sinking back into the old stagnant ideals, and  practising the Seven Deadly Virtues; it's *we* who need to count  our mercies, and realize anew what he's done for us, and what we  ought to do for him!  And it's for   that reason that I urged  Mr. Wade to speak here, in the very inner sanctuary of Pellerinism,  exactly as he would speak to the uninitiated — to repeat, simply,  his Kenosha lecture, 'What Pellerinism means'; and we ought all, I  think, to listen to him with the hearts of little children — just as  *you* will, Mr. Winterman — as if he were telling us new things,  and we — "  

"Alice, *dear* — " Mrs. Bain murmured with a deprecating  gesture; and Howland Wade, emerging between the palms, took the  centre of the platform.  

A pang of commiseration shot through Bernald as he saw him  there, so innocent and so exposed.  His plump pulpy body, which  made his evening dress fall into intimate and wrapper-like folds,  was like a wide surface spread to the shafts of irony; and the mild  ripples of his voice seemed to enlarge the vulnerable area as he  leaned forward, poised on confidential finger-tips, to say  persuasively: "Let me try to tell you what Pellerinism means."  

Bernald moved restlessly in his seat.  He had the obscure  sense of being a party to something not wholly honourable.  He  ought not to have come; he ought not to have let his companion  come.  Yet how could he have done otherwise?  John Pellerin's  secret was his own.  As long as he chose to remain John Winterman  it was no one's business to gainsay him; and Bernald's scruples  were really justifiable only in respect of his own presence on the  scene.  But even in this connection he ceased to feel them as soon  as Howland Wade began to speak.  

      
##   VI  

  IT had been arranged that Pellerin, after the meeting of the  Uplift Club, should join Bernald at his rooms and spend the night  there, instead of returning to Portchester.  The plan had been  eagerly elaborated by the young man, but he had been unprepared for  the alacrity with which his wonderful friend accepted it.  He was  beginning to see that it was a part of Pellerin's wonderfulness to  fall in, quite simply and naturally, with any arrangements made for  his convenience, or tending to promote the convenience of others.   Bernald felt that his extreme docility in such matters was  proportioned to the force of resistance which, for nearly half a  life-time, had kept him, with his back to the wall, fighting alone  against the powers of darkness.  In such a scale of values how  little the small daily alternatives must weigh!  

At the close of Howland Wade's discourse, Bernald, charged  with his prodigious secret, had felt the need to escape for an  instant from the liberated rush of talk.  The interest of watching  Pellerin was so perilously great that the watcher felt it might, at  any moment, betray him.  He lingered in the crowded drawing-room  long enough to see his friend enclosed in a mounting tide, above  which Mrs. Beecher Bain and Miss Fosdick actively waved their  conversational tridents; then he took refuge, at the back of the  house, in a small dim library where, in his younger days, he had  discussed personal immortality and the problem of consciousness  with beautiful girls whose names he could not remember.  

In this retreat he surprised Mr. Beecher Bain, a quiet man  with a mild brow, who was smoking a surreptitious cigar over the  last number of the *Strand*.  Mr. Bain, at Bernald's approach,  dissembled the *Strand* under a copy of the *Hibbert Journal*,  but tendered his cigar-case with the remark that stocks were heavy  again; and Bernald blissfully abandoned himself to this unexpected  contact with reality.  

On his return to the drawing-room he found that the tide had  set toward the supper-table, and when it finally carried him  thither it was to land him in the welcoming arms of Bob Wade.  

"Hullo, old man!  Where have you been all this time? —   Winterman?  Oh, *he's* talking to Howland: yes, I managed it  finally.  I believe Mrs. Bain has steered them into the library, so  that they shan't be disturbed.  I gave her an idea of the  situation, and she was awfully kind.  We'd better leave them alone,  don't you think?  I'm trying to get a croquette for Miss Fosdick."  

Bernald's secret leapt in his bosom, and he devoted himself to  the task of distributing sandwiches and champagne while his pulses  danced to the tune of the cosmic laughter.  The vision of Pellerin  and his Interpreter, face to face at last, had a Cyclopean grandeur  that dwarfed all other comedy.  "And I shall hear of it presently;  in an hour or two he'll be telling me about it.  And that hour will  be all mine — mine and his!"  The dizziness of the thought made it    difficult for Bernald to preserve the balance of the  supper-plates he was distributing.  Life had for him at that moment  the completeness which seems to defy disintegration.  

The throng in the dining-room was thickening, and Bernald's  efforts as purveyor were interrupted by frequent appeals, from  ladies who had reached repleteness, that he should sit down a  moment and tell them all about his interesting friend.  Winterman's  fame, trumpeted abroad by Miss Fosdick, had reached the four  corners of the Uplift Club, and Bernald found himself fabricating  *de toutes pieces* a Winterman legend which should in some degree  respond to the Club's demand for the human document.  When at  length he had acquitted himself of this obligation, and was free to  work his way back through the lessening groups into the drawing-room, he was at last rewarded by a glimpse of his friend, who,  still densely encompassed, towered in the centre of the room in all  his sovran ugliness.  

Their eyes met across the crowd; but Bernald gathered only  perplexity from the encounter.  What were Pellerin's eyes saying to  him?  What orders, what confidences, what indefinable apprehension  did their long look impart?  The young man was still trying to  decipher their complex message when he felt a tap on the arm, and  turned to encounter the rueful gaze of Bob Wade, whose meaning lay  clearly enough on the surface of his good blue stare.  

"Well, it won't work — it won't work," the doctor groaned.  

"What won't?"  

"I mean with Howland.  Winterman won't.  Howland doesn't take  to him.  Says he's crude — frightfully crude.  And you know how  Howland hates crudeness."  

"Oh, I know," Bernald exulted.  It was the word he had waited  for — he saw it now!  Once more he was lost in wonder at Howland's  miraculous faculty for always, as the naturalists said, being true  to type.  

"So I'm afraid it's all up with his chance of writing.  At  least *I* can do no more," said Wade, discouraged.  

Bernald pressed him for farther details.  "Does Winterman seem  to mind much?  Did you hear his version?"  

"His version?"  

"I mean what he said to Howland."  

"Why no.  What the deuce was there for him to say?"  

"What indeed?  I think I'll take him home," said Bernald  gaily.  

He turned away to join the circle from which, a few minutes  before, Pellerin's eyes had vainly and enigmatically signalled to  him; but the circle had dispersed, and Pellerin himself was not in  sight.  

Bernald, looking about him, saw that during his brief aside  with Wade the party had passed into the final phase of dissolution.   People still delayed, in diminishing groups, but the current had  set toward the doors, and every moment or two it bore away a few  more lingerers.  Bernald, from his post, commanded the clearing  perspective of the two drawing-rooms, and a rapid survey of their  length sufficed to assure him that Pellerin was not in either.   Taking leave of Wade, the young man made his way back to the  drawing-room, where only a few hardened feasters remained, and then  passed on to the library which had been the scene of the late  momentous colloquy.  But the library too was empty, and drifting  back uncertainly to the inner drawing-room Bernald found Mrs.  Beecher Bain domestically putting out the wax candles on the  mantel-piece.  

"Dear Mr. Bernald!  Do sit down and have a little chat.  What  a wonderful privilege it has been!  I don't know when I've had such  an intense impression."  

She made way for him, hospitably, in a corner of the sofa to  which she had sunk; and he echoed her vaguely: "You *were*  impressed, then?"  

"I can't express to you how it affected me!  As Alice said, it  was a resurrection — it was as if John Pellerin were actually here  in the room with us!"  

Bernald turned on her with a half-audible gasp.  "You felt  that, dear Mrs. Bain?"  

"We all felt it — every one of us!  I don't wonder the Greeks —   it *was* the Greeks? — regarded eloquence as a supernatural power.   As Alice says, when one looked at Howland Wade one understood what  they meant by the Afflatus."  

Bernald rose and held out his hand.  "Oh, I see — it was  Howland who made you feel as if Pellerin were in the room?  And he  made Miss Fosdick feel so too?"  

"Why, of course.  But why are you rushing off?"    

"Because I must hunt up my friend, who's not used to such late  hours."  

"Your friend?"  Mrs. Bain had to collect her thoughts.  "Oh,  Mr. Winterman, you mean?  But he's gone already."  

"Gone?" Bernald exclaimed, with an odd twinge of foreboding.   Remembering Pellerin's signal across the crowd, he reproached  himself for not having answered it more promptly.  Yet it was  certainly strange that his friend should have left the house  without him.  

"Are you quite sure?" he asked, with a startled glance at the  clock.  

"Oh, perfectly.  He went half an hour ago.  But you needn't  hurry home on his account, for Alice Fosdick carried him off with  her.  I saw them leave together."  

"Carried him off?  She took him home with her, you mean?"  

"Yes.  You know what strange hours she keeps.  She told me she  was going to give him a Welsh rabbit, and explain Pellerinism to  him."  

"Oh, *if* she's going to explain — " Bernald murmured.  But  his amazement at the news struggled with a confused impatience to  reach his rooms in time to be there for his friend's arrival.   There could be no stranger spectacle beneath the stars than that of  John Pellerin carried off by Miss Fosdick, and listening, in the  small hours, to her elucidation of his doctrines; but Bernald knew  enough of his sex to be aware that such an experiment may present  a less humorous side to its subject than to an impartial observer.   Even the Uplift Club and its connotations might benefit by the  attraction of the unknown; and it was conceivable that to a  traveller from Mesopotamia Miss Fosdick might present elements of  interest which she had lost for the frequenters of Fifth Avenue.   There was, at any rate, no denying that the affair had become  unexpectedly complex, and that its farther development promised to  be rich in comedy.  

In the charmed contemplation of these possibilities Bernald  sat over his fire, listening for Pellerin's ring.  He had arranged  his modest quarters with the reverent care of a celebrant awaiting  the descent of his deity.  He guessed Pellerin to be unconscious of  visual detail, but sensitive to the happy blending of sensuous  impressions: to the intimate spell of lamplight on books, and of a  deep chair placed where one could watch the fire.  The chair was  there, and Bernald, facing it across the hearth, already saw it  filled by Pellerin's lounging figure.  The autumn dawn came late,  and even now they had before them the promise of some untroubled  hours.  Bernald, sitting there alone in the warm stillness of his  room, and in the profounder hush of his expectancy, was conscious  of gathering up all his sensibilities and perceptions into one  exquisitely-adjusted instrument of notation.  Until now he had  tasted Pellerin's society only in unpremeditated snatches, and had  always left him with a sense, on his own part, of waste and  shortcoming.  Now, in the lull of this dedicated hour, he felt that  he should miss nothing, and forget nothing, of the initiation that  awaited him.  And catching sight of Pellerin's pipe, he rose and  laid it carefully on a table by the arm-chair.    

"No.  I've never had any news of him," Bernald heard himself  repeating.  He spoke in a low tone, and with the automatic  utterance that alone made it possible to say the words.  

They were addressed to Miss Fosdick, into whose neighbourhood  chance had thrown him at a dinner, a year or so later than their  encounter at the Uplift Club.  Hitherto he had successfully, and  intentionally, avoided Miss Fosdick, not from any animosity toward  that unconscious instrument of fate, but from an intense reluctance  to pronounce the words which he knew he should have to speak if  they met.  

Now, as it turned out, his chief surprise was that she should  wait so long to make him speak them.  All through the dinner she  had swept him along on a rapid current of talk which showed no  tendency to linger or turn back upon the past.  At first he  ascribed her reserve to a sense of delicacy with which he  reproached himself for not having previously credited her; then he  saw that she had been carried so far beyond the point at which they  had last faced each other, that it was by the merest hazard of  associated ideas that she was now finally borne back to it.  For it  appeared that the very next evening, at Mrs. Beecher Bain's, a  Hindu Mahatma was to lecture to the Uplift Club on the Limits of  the Subliminal; and it was owing to no less a person than Howland  Wade that this exceptional privilege had been obtained.    

"Of course Howland's known all over the world as the  interpreter of Pellerinism, and the Aga Gautch, who had absolutely  declined to speak anywhere in public, wrote to Isabella that he  could not refuse anything that Mr. Wade asked.  Did you know that  Howland's lecture, 'What Pellerinism Means,' has been translated  into twenty-two languages, and gone into a fifth edition in  Icelandic?  Why, that reminds me," Miss Fosdick broke off — "I've  never heard what became of your queer friend — what was his name? —   whom you and Bob Wade accused me of spiriting away after that very  lecture.  And I've never seen *you* since you rushed into the  house the next morning, and dragged me out of bed to know what I'd  done with him!"  

With a sharp effort Bernald gathered himself together to have  it out.  "Well, what *did* you do with him?" he retorted.  

She laughed her appreciation of his humour.  "Just what I told  you, of course.  I said good-bye to him on Isabella's door-step."  

Bernald looked at her.  "It's really true, then, that he  didn't go home with you?"  

She bantered back: "Have you suspected me, all this time, of  hiding his remains in the cellar?"  And with a droop of her fine  lids she added: "I wish he *had* come home with me, for he was  rather interesting, and there were things I think I could have  explained to him."  

Bernald helped himself to a nectarine, and Miss Fosdick  continued on a note of amused curiosity: "So you've really never  had any news of him since that night?"  

"No — I've never had any news of him."  

"Not the least little message?"  

"Not the least little message."  

"Or a rumour or report of any kind?"  

"Or a rumour or report of any kind."  

Miss Fosdick's interest seemed to be revived by the  strangeness of the case.  "It's rather creepy, isn't it?  What *could*   have happened?  You don't suppose he could have been waylaid  and murdered?" she asked with brightening eyes.  

Bernald shook his head serenely.  "No.  I'm sure he's safe —   quite safe."  

"But if you're sure, you must know something."  

"No.  I know nothing," he repeated.  

She scanned him incredulously.  "But what's your theory — for  you must have a theory?  What in the world can have become of him?"  

Bernald returned her look and hesitated.  "Do you happen to  remember the last thing he said to you — the very last, on the door-step, when he left you?"
