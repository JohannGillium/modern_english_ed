## 1

  -  A Rock, A River, A Tree  
 -  Hosts to species long since departed,  
 -  Marked the mastodon,  
 -  The dinosaur, who left dried tokens  
 -  Of their sojourn here  
 -  On our planet floor,  
 -  Any broad alarm of their hastening doom  
 -  Is lost in the gloom of dust and ages.  
   
##  2

 -  But today, the Rock cries out to us, clearly, forcefully,  
 -  Come, you may stand upon my  
 -  Back and face your distant destiny,  
 -  But seek no haven in my shadow.  
 -  I will give you no hiding place down here. 
   
##  3

 -  You, created only a little lower than  
 -  The angels, have crouched too long in  
 -  The bruising darkness  
 -  Have lain too long  
 -  Face down in ignorance.  
 -  Your mouths spilling words 
   
##  4

 -  Armed for slaughter.  
 -  The Rock cries out to us today, you may stand upon me,  
 -  But do not hide your face. 
   
##  5

 -  Across the wall of the world,  
 -  A River sings a beautiful song.  It says,  
 -  Come, rest here by my side. 
   
##  6

 -  Each of you, a bordered country,  
 -  Delicate and strangely made proud,  
 -  Yet thrusting perpetually under siege.  
 -  Your armed struggles for profit  
 -  Have left collars of waste upon  
 -  My shore, currents of debris upon my breast.  
 -  Yet today I call you to my riverside,  
 -  If you will study war no more.  Come,  
 -  Clad in peace, and I will sing the songs  
 -  The Creator gave to me when I and the  
 -  Tree and the rock were one.  
 -  Before cynicism was a bloody sear across your  
 -  Brow and when you yet knew you still  
 -  Knew nothing.  
 -  The River sang and sings on. 
      
##  7

  -  There is a true yearning to respond to  
 -  The singing River and the wise Rock.  
 -  So say the Asian, the Hispanic, the Jew  
 -  The African, the Native American, the Sioux,  
 -  The Catholic, the Muslim, the French, the Greek  
 -  The Irish, the Rabbi, the Priest, the Sheik,  
 -  The Gay, the Straight, the Preacher,  
 -  The privileged, the homeless, the Teacher.  
 -  They hear.  They all hear  
 -  The speaking of the Tree. 
   
##  8

 -  They hear the first and last of every Tree  
 -  Speak to humankind today.  Come to me, here beside the River. 
 -  Plant yourself beside the River. 
   
##  9

 -  Each of you, descendant of some passed  
 -  On traveller, has been paid for.  
 -  You, who gave me my first name, you,  
 -  Pawnee, Apache, Seneca, you  
 -  Cherokee Nation, who rested with me, then  
 -  Forced on bloody feet,  
 -  Left me to the employment of  
 -  Other seekers — desperate for gain,  
 -  Starving for gold.  
 -  You, the Turk, the Arab, the Swede, the German, the Eskimo,  the Scot,  
 -  You the Ashanti, the Yoruba, the Kru, bought,  
 -  Sold, stolen, arriving on the nightmare  
 -  Praying for a dream.  
 -  Here, root yourselves beside me.  
 -  I am that Tree planted by the River,  
 -  Which will not be moved.  
 -  I, the Rock, I the River, I the Tree  
 -  I am yours — your passages have been paid.  
 -  Lift up your faces, you have a piercing need  
 -  For this bright morning dawning for you.  
 -  History, despite its wrenching pain  
 -  Cannot be unlived, but if faced  
 -  With courage, need not be lived again. 
    
##  10

  -  Lift up your eyes upon  
 -  This day breaking for you.  
 -  Give birth again  
 -  To the dream. 
   
##  11

 -  Women, children, men,  
 -  Take it into the palms of your hands,  
 -  Mold it into the shape of your most  
 -  Private need.  Sculpt it into  
 -  The image of your most public self.  
 -  Lift up your hearts  
 -  Each new hour holds new chances  
 -  For a new beginning.  
 -  Do not be wedded forever  
 -  To fear, yoked eternally  
 -  To brutishness. 
   
##  12

 -  The horizon leans forward,  
 -  Offering you space to place new steps of change.  
 -  Here, on the pulse of this fine day  
 -  You may have the courage  
 -  To look up and out and upon me, the  
 -  Rock, the River, the Tree, your country.  
 -  No less to Midas than the mendicant.  
 -  No less to you now than the mastodon then. 
   
## 13

 -  Here, on the pulse of this new day  
 -  You may have the grace to look up and out  
 -  And into your sister's eyes, and into  
 -  Your brother's face, your country  
 -  And say simply  
 -  Very simply  
 -  With hope —  
 -  Good morning.
