# The Printer to the Reader.

          That to haue wel written in verse, yea & in small   parcelles, deserueth great praise, the workes of   diuers Latines, Italians, and other, doe proue   sufficiently. That our tong is able in that kynde   to do as praiseworthely as [the] rest, the honorable stile   of the noble earle of Surrey, and the weightinesse of   the depewitted sir Thomas Wyat the elders verse,   with seuerall graces in sondry good Englishe writers,   doe show abundantly. It resteth nowe (gentle   reder) that thou thinke it not euill doon, to publish,   to the honor of the Englishe tong, and for profit of   the studious of Englishe eloquence, those workes   which the vngentle hordera[^]: horders

   vp of such treasure haue   heretofore enuied thee. And for this point (good reder)   thine own profit and pleasure, in these presently,   and in moe hereafter, shal answere for my defence. If   parhappes some mislike the statelinesse of stile remoued   from the rude skill of common eares: I aske help   of the learned to defend their learned frender,   [^]: frendes

 the authors   of this work: And I exhort the vnlearned, by   reding to learne to be more skilfull, and to purge   that swinelike grossenesse, that maketh the swete   maierome not to smell to their delight.

## The sonne hath twise brought furth

    Descripcion of the restlesse state of a louer, with sute to his   ladie, to rue on his diyng hart.   

    - The sonne hath twise brought furth his tender grene,   
- And clad the earth in liuely lustinesse:   
- Ones haue the windes the trees despoiled clene,   
- And new again begins their cruelnesse,   
- Since I haue hid vnder my brest the harm   
- That neuer shall recouer healthfulnesse.   
- The winters hurt recouers with the warm:   
- The parched grene restored is with shade.   
- What warmth (alas) may serue for to disarm   
- The frosen hart that mine in flame hath made?   
- What colde againe is able to restore   
- My fresh grene yeares, that wither thus and fade?   
- Alas, I se, nothing hath hurt so sore,   
- But time in time reduceth a returne:   
- In time my harm increaseth more and more,   
- And semes to haue my cure alwaies in scorne.   
- Strange kindes of death, in life that I doe trie,   
- At hand to melt, farre of in flame to burne.   
- And like as time list to my cure aply,   
- So doth eche place my comfort cleane refuse.   
- All thing aliue, that seeth the heauens with eye,   
- With cloke of night may couer, and excuse   
- It self from trauail of the dayes vnrest,   
- Saue I, alas, against all others vse,   
- That then stirre vp the tormentes of my brest,   
- And curse eche sterre as causer of my fate.   
- And when the sonne hath eke the dark opprest,   
- And brought the day, it doth nothing abate   
- The trauailes of mine endles smart and payn,   
- For then, as one that hath the light in hate,   
- I wish for night, more couertly to playn,   
- And me withdraw from euery haunted place,   
- Lest by my chere my chance appere to playn:   
- And in my minde I measure pace by pace,       
- To seke the place where I my self had lost,   
- That day that I was tangled in the lace,   
- In semyng slack that knitteth euer most:   
- But neuer yet the trauaile of my thought   
- Of better state coulde catche a cause to bost.   
- For if I found sometime that I haue sought,   
- Those sterres by whome I trusted of the porte,   
- My sayles doe fall, and I aduance right nought,   
- As ankerd fast, my spretes doe all resorte   
- To stande agazed, and sinke in more and more   
- The deadly harme which she dothe take in sport.   
- Lo, if I seke, how I doe finde my sore:   
- And yf I flee I carie with me still   
- The venomde shaft, whiche dothe his force restore   
- By hast of flight, and I may plaine my fill   
- Vnto my selfe, vnlesse this carefull song   
- Printe in your harte some parcell of my tene   
- For I, alas, in silence all to long   
- Of myne olde hurte yet fele the wounde but grene.   
- Rue on my life: or els your cruell wronge   
- Shall well appere, and by my death be sene.   
     
## The soote season

  Description of Spring, wherin eche thing renewes, saue onelie the louer.   

  - The soote season, that bud and blome furth bringes,   
- With grene hath clad the hill and eke the vale:   
- The nightingale with fethers new she singes:   
- The turtle to her make hath tolde her tale:   
- Somer is come, for euery spray nowe springes,   
- The hart hath hong his olde hed on the pale:   
- The buck in brake his winter cote he flinges:   
- The fishes flote with newe repaired scale:   
- The adder all her sloughe awaye she slinges:   
- The swift swalow pursueth the flyes smale:   
- The busy bee her honye now she minges:   
- Winter is worne that was the flowers bale:   
- And thus I see among these pleasant thinges   
- Eche care decayes, and yet my sorow springes.       
    
## When youth had led me

  Descripcion of the restlesse state of a louer.   

  - When youth had led me halfe the race,   
- That Cupides scourge me causde to ronne,   
- I loked back to mete the place,   
- From whence my wery course begonne.   
-   And then I sawe how my desire   
- Misguiding me had led the way:   
- Mine eyen to gredy of their hire,   
- Had made me lose a better pray.   
-   For when in sighes I spent the day,   
- And could not cloke my griefe with game,   
- The boiling smoke did still bewray   
- The persaunt heate of secrete flame.   
-   And when salt teares doe bayne my brest,   
- Where loue his pleasant traines hath sowen   
- Her bewty hath the fruites opprest,   
- Ere that the buds were spronge and blowen.   
-   And when myne eyen dyd styll pursue   
- The flying chace that was their quest,   
- Their gredy lokes dyd oft renewe.   
- the hidden wound within my brest.   
-   When euery loke these chekes might staine,   
- From deadly pale to glowing red:   
- By outwarde signes appered plaine,   
- The woe wherin my hart was fed.   
-   But all to late loue learneth me,   
- To painte all kinde of colours new,   
- To blinde their eyes that els shoulde see,   
- My specled chekes with Cupides hewe.   
-   And no we[^]: nowe

 the couert brest I claime,   
- That worshipt Cupide secretely:   
- And norished his sacred flame,   
- From whence no blasing sparkes doe flye.   
    
## Svche waiward waies hath loue

  Description of the fickle affections panges and sleightes of loue.       

  - Svche waiward waies hath loue, that most part in discord   
- Our willes do stand, whereby our hartes but seldom doe accord.   
-   Disceit is his delight, and to begile, and mock   
- The simple hartes whom he doth strike w[ith] froward diuers strok.   
-   H e[^]: He

 makes the one to rage with golden burning dart,   
- And doth alay with leaden colde agayn the other hart.   
-   Whote glemes of burnyng fire, and easy sparkes of flame   
- In balance of vnegall weight he pondereth by aime.   
-   From easy forde, where I might wade and passe ful wel,   
- He me withdrawes, and doth me driue into a depe dark hel,   
-   And me withholdes where I am calde and offred place,   
- And willes me that my mortall foe I doe beseke of grace:   
-   He lettes me to pursue a conquest welnere wonne,   
- To folow where my paines were lost ere that my suite begonne.   
-   So by this meanes I know how soone a hart may turne   
- From warre to peace, from truce to strife, and so again returne,   
-   I know how to content my self in others lust,   
- Of litle stuffe vnto my self to weaue a webbe of trust:   
-   And how to hide my harmes with soft dissembling chere,   
- When in my face the painted thoughtes would outwardly apere.   
-   I know how that the blood forsakes the face for dred:   
- And how by shame it staines again the chekes with flaming red.   
-   I know vnder the grene the serpent how he lurkes.   
- The hammer of the restles forge I wote eke how it wurkes.   
-   I know and can by roate the tale that I would tel:   
- But oft the wordes come furth awrie of him that loueth wel.   
-   I know in heat and colde the louer how he shakes:   
- In singing how he doth complain, in slepyng how he wakes:   
-   To languish without ache, sicklesse for to consume:   
- A thousand thinges for to deuise resoluing all in fume.   
-   And though he list to se his ladies grace ful sore,   
- Such pleasures as delight the eye doe not his health restore.   
-   I know to seke the track of my desired foe,   
- And feare to finde that I do seke. But chiefly this I know,   
-   That louers must transforme into the thing beloued,   
- And liue (alas who would beleue?) with sprite from life remoued,   
-   I know in harty sighes, and laughters of the splene   
- At once to change my state, my wyll, and eke my coloure clene.   
-   I know how to deceaue my self with others help:   
- And how the Lion chastised is by beating of the whelp.   
-   In standyng nere my fire I know how that I freze.   
- Farre of I burne, in both I wast, and so my life I leze.       
-   I know how loue doth rage vpon a yelding mynde:   
- How smal a net may take and meash a hart of gentle kinde:   
-   Or els with seldom swete to season heapes of gall,   
- Reuiued with a glimse of grace olde sorowes to let fall,   
-   The hidden traines I know, and secret snares of loue:   
- How soone a loke wil printe a thought, that neuer may remoue.   
-   The slipper state I know, the sodain turnes from wealth,   
- The doubtful hope, the certain woe, and sure despeire of health.   
    
## When somer toke in hand

  Complaint of a louer, that defied loue, and was by loue   after the more tormented.   

  - When so[m]mer toke in hand the winter to assail,   
- With force of might, & vertue gret, his stormy blasts to quail,   
-   And when he clothed faire the earth about with grene,   
- And euery tree new garmented, that pleasure was to sene:   
-   Mine hart gan new reuiue, and changed blood dyd stur   
- Me to withdraw my winter woe, that kept within the dore.   
-   Abrode, quod my desire: assay to set thy fote,   
- Where thou shalt finde the sauour swete: for sprong is euery rote.   
-   And to thy health, if thou were sick in any case,   
- Nothing more good, than in the spring the aire to fele a space.   
-   There shalt thou here and se all kindes of birdes ywrought,   
- Well tune their voice w[ith] warble smal, as nature hath them tought.   
-   Thus pricked me my lust the sluggish house to leaue:   
- And for my health I thought it best suche counsail to receaue.   
-   So on a morow furth, vnwist of any wight,   
- I went to proue how well it would my heauy burden light.   
-   And when I felt the aire so pleasant round about,   
- Lorde, to my self how glad I was that I had gotten out.   
-   There might I se how Ver had euery blossom hent:   
- And eke the new betrothed birdes ycoupled how they went.   
-   And in their songes me thought they thanked nature much,   
- That by her lycence all that yere to loue their happe was such,   
-   Right as they could deuise to chose them feres throughout:   
- With much reioysing to their Lord thus flew they all about,   
-   Which when I gan resolue, and in my head conceaue,   
- What pleasant life, what heapes of ioy these litle birdes receaue,       
-   And sawe in what estate I wery man was brought,   
- By want of that they had at will, and I reiect at nought:   
-   Lorde how I gan in wrath vnwisely me demeane.   
- I curssed loue, and him defied: I thought to turne the streame.   
-   But whan I well behelde he had me vnder awe,   
- I asked mercie for my fault, that so transgrest his law.   
-   Thou blinded god (quod I) forgeue me this offense,   
- Vnwillingly I went about to malice thy pretense.   
-   Wherewith he gaue a beck, and thus me thought he swore,   
- Thy sorow ought suffice to purge thy faulte, if it were more.   
-   The vertue of which sounde mine hart did so reuiue,   
- That I, me thought, was made as hole as any man aliue.   
-   But here ye may perceiue mine errour all and some,   
- For that I thought that so it was: yet was it still vndone:   
-   And all that was no more but mine empressed mynde,   
- That fayne woulde haue some good relefe of Cupide wel assinde.   
-   I turned home forthwith, and might perceiue it well,   
- That he agreued was right sore with me for my rebell.   
-   My harmes haue euer since increased more and more,   
- And I remaine, without his help, vndone for euer more,   
-   A miror let me be vnto ye louers all:   
- Striue not with loue: for if ye do, it will ye thus befall,   
    
## Loue, that liueth, and reigneth

  Complaint of a louer rebuked.   

  - Loue, that liueth, and reigneth in my thought,   
- That built his seat within my captiue brest,   
- Clad in the armes, wherin with me he fought,   
- Oft in my face he doth his banner rest.   
- She, that me taught to loue, and suffer payne,   
- My doutfull hope, and eke my hote desyre,   
- With shamefast cloke to shadowe, and refraine,   
- Her smilyng grace conuerteth straight to yre.   
- And cowarde Loue then to the hart apace   
- Taketh his flight, whereas he lurkes, and plaines   
- His purpose lost, and dare not shewe his face.   
- For my lordes gilt thus faultlesse byde I paynes.   
- Yet from my lorde shall not my foote remoue.   
- Swete is his death, that takes his end by loue.       
    
## In Ciprus, springes

  Complaint of the louer disdained.   

  - In Ciprus, springes (whereas dame Venus dwelt)   
- A well so hote, that whoso tastes thesame,[^]: the same

  
- Were he of stone, as thawed yse should melt,   
- And kindled fynde his brest with fired flame.   
- Whose moyst poyson dissolued hath my hate.   
- This creeping fire my colde lims so opprest,   
- That in the hart that harborde freedome late,   
- Endlesse despeyre longe thraldome hath imprest.   
- An other so colde in frozen yse is founde,   
- Whose chilling venom of repugnant kynde   
- The feruent heat doth quenche of Cupides wounde:   
- And with the spot of change infectes the minde:   
- Whereof my dere hath tasted, to my paine.   
- My seruice thus is growen into disdaine.   
    
## From Tuskane

  Description and praise of his loue Geraldine.   

  - From Tuskane came my Ladies worthy race:   
- Faire Florence was sometyme her auncient seate:   
- The Western yle, whose pleasaunt shore dothe face   
- Wilde Cambers clifs, did geue her liuely heate:   
- Fostered she was with milke of Irishe brest:   
- Her sire, an Erle: her dame, of princes blood.   
- From tender yeres, in Britain she doth rest,   
- With kinges childe, where she tasteth costly food.   
- Honsdon did first present her to mine yien:   
- Bright is her hewe, and Geraldine she hight.   
- Hampton me taught to wishe her first for mine:   
- And Windsor, alas, dothe chase me from her sight.   
- Her beauty of kind her vertues from aboue.   
- Happy is he, that can obtaine her loue.   
    
## Brittle beautie

  The frailtie and hurtfulnes of beautie.   

  - Brittle beautie, that nature made so fraile,   
- Wherof the gift is small, and short the season,       
- Flowring to day, to morowe apt to faile,   
- Tickell treasure abhorred of reason,   
- Daungerous to dele with, vaine, of none auaile,   
- Costly in keping, past not worthe two peason,   
- Slipper in sliding as is an eles taile,   
- Harde to attaine, once gotten not geason,   
- Iewel of ieopardie that perill dothe assaile,   
- False and vntrue, enticed oft to treason,   
- Enmy to youth: that moste may I bewaile.   
- Ah bitter swete infecting as the poyson:   
- Thou farest as frute that with the frost is taken,   
- To day redy ripe, to morowe all to shaken.   
    
## Alas so all thinges nowe

  A complaint by night of the louer not beloued.   

  - Alas so all thinges nowe doe holde their peace.   
- Heauen and earth disturbed in nothing:   
- The beastes, the ayer, the birdes their song doe cease:   
- The nightes chare the starres aboute dothe bring:   
- Calme is the Sea, the waues worke lesse and lesse:   
- So am not I, whom loue alas doth wring,   
- Bringing before my face the great encrease   
- Of my desires, whereat I wepe and syng,   
- In ioye and wo, as in a doutfull ease.   
- For my swete thoughtes sometyme doe pleasure bring:   
- But byandby[^]: by and by

 the cause of my disease   
- Geues me a pang, that inwardly dothe sting,   
- When that I thinke what griefe it is againe,   
- To liue and lacke the thing should ridde my paine.   
    
## When Windsor walles susteyned

  How eche thing saue the louer in spring reuiueth to pleasure.   

  - When Windsor walles susteyned my wearied arme,   
- My hande my chin, to ease my restlesse hed:   
- The pleasant plot reuested green with warme,   
- The blossomd bowes with lusty Ver yspred,       
- The flowred meades, the wedded birdes so late   
- Mine eyes discouer: and to my mynde resorte   
- The ioly woes, the hatelesse shorte debate,   
- The rakehell lyfe that longes to loues disporte.   
- Wherewith (alas) the heauy charge of care   
- Heapt in my brest breakes forth against my will,   
- In smoky sighes, that ouercast the ayer.   
- My vapord eyes suche drery teares distill,   
- The tender spring whiche quicken where they fall,   
- And I halfebent to throwe me downe withall.   
    
## Set me wheras the sunne

  Vow to loue faithfully howsoeuer he be rewarded.   

  - Set me wheras the sunne doth parche the grene,   
- Or where his beames do not dissolue the yse:   
- In temperate heate where he is felt and sene:   
- In presence prest of people madde or wise.   
- Set me in hye, or yet in lowe degree:   
- In longest night, or in the shortest daye:   
- In clearest skye, or where clowdes thickest be:   
- In lusty youth, or when my heeres are graye.   
- Set me in heauen, in earth, or els in hell,   
- In hyll, or dale, or in the fomyng flood:   
- Thrall, or at large, aliue where so I dwell:   
- Sicke, or in health: in euyll fame, or good.   
- Hers will I be, and onely with this thought   
- Content my selfe, although my chaunce be nought.   
    
## I neuer sawe my Ladye

  Complaint that his ladie after she knew of his loue kept her face   alway hidden from him.   

  - I Neuer sawe my Ladye laye apart   
- Her cornet blacke, in colde nor yet in heate,   
- Sith first she knew my griefe was growen so great,       
- Which other fansies driueth from my hart   
- That to my selfe I do the thought reserue,   
- The which vnwares did wounde my wofull brest:   
- But on her face mine eyes mought neuer rest,   
- Yet, sins she knew I did her loue and serue   
- Her golden tresses cladde alway with blacke,   
- Her smilyng lokes that hid thus euermore,   
- And that restraines whiche I desire so sore.   
- So dothe this cornet gouerne me alacke:   
- In somer, sunne: in winters breath, a frost:   
- Wherby the light of her faire lokes I lost.   
    
## The golden gift

  Request to his loue to ioyne bountie with beautie.   

  - The golden gift that nature did thee geue,   
- To fasten frendes, and fede them at thy wyll,   
- With fourme and fauour, taught me to beleue,   
- How thou art made to shew her greatest skill.   
- Whose hidden vertues are not so vnknowen,   
- But liuely domes might gather at the first   
- Where beautye so her perfect seede hath sowen,   
- Of other graces folow nedes there must.   
- Now certesse Ladie, sins all this is true,   
- That from aboue thy gyftes are thus elect:   
- Do not deface them than with fansies newe,   
- Nor chaunge of mindes let not thy minde infect:   
- But mercy him thy frende, that doth thee serue,   
- Who seekes alway thine honour to preserue.   
    
## So cruell prison

  Prisoned in windsor, he recounteth his pleasure there passed.   

  - So cruell prison how coulde betide, alas,   
- As proude Windsor? where I in lust and ioye,   
- With a kinges sonne, my childishe yeres did passe,   
- In greater feast than Priams sonnes of Troy:   
- Where eche swete place returns a taste full sower,       
- The large grene courtes, where we were wont to houe,   
- With eyes cast vp into the maydens tower.   
- And easie sighes, suche as folke drawe in loue:   
- The stately seates, the ladies bright of hewe:   
- The daunces shorte, longe tales of great delight:   
- With wordes and lokes, that tygers coulde but rewe,   
- Where eche of vs did pleade the others right:   
- The palme play, where, dispoyled for the game,   
- With dazed eies oft we by gleames of loue,   
- Haue mist the ball, and got sight of our dame,   
- To baite her eyes, whiche kept the leads aboue:   
- The grauell grounde, with sleues tyed on the helme:   
- On fomynge horse, with swordes and frendlye hartes:   
- With cheare, as though one should another whelme:   
- Where we haue fought, and chased oft with dartes,   
- With siluer droppes the meade yet spred for ruthe,   
- In actiue games of nimblenes, and strength,   
- Where we did straine, trayned with swarmes of youth.   
- Our tender lymmes, that yet shot vp in length:   
- The secrete groues, which oft we made resounde   
- Of pleasaunt playnt, and of our ladies prayse,   
- Recordyng ofte what grace eche one had founde,   
- What hope of spede, what dreade of long delayes:   
- The wilde forest, the clothed holtes with grene:   
- With rayns auailed, and swift ybreathed horse,   
- With crye of houndes, and mery blastes betwene,   
- Where we did chase the fearfull harte of force,   
- The wide vales eke, that harborde vs ech night,   
- Wherwith (alas) reuiueth in my brest   
- The swete accorde: such slepes as yet delight,   
- The pleasant dreames, the quiet bed of rest:   
- The secrete thoughtes imparted with such trust:   
- The wanton talke, the diuers change of play:   
- The frendship sworne, eche promise kept so iust:   
- Wherwith we past the winter night away.   
- And, with this thought, the bloud forsakes the face,   
- The teares berayne my chekes of deadly hewe:   
- The whiche as sone as sobbyng sighes (alas)   
- Vpsupped haue, thus I my plaint renewe:   
- O place of blisse, renuer of my woes,   
- Geue me accompt, where is my noble fere:   
- Whom in thy walles thou doest eche night enclose,       
- To other leefe, but vnto me most dere.   
- Eccho (alas) that dothe my sorow rewe,   
- Returns therto a hollow sounde of playnte.   
- Thus I alone, where all my fredome grewe,   
- In prison pyne, with bondage and restrainte,   
- And with remembrance of the greater greefe   
- To banishe the lesse, I find my chief releefe.   
    
## When ragyng loue

  The louer comforteth himself with the worthinesse of his loue.   

  - When ragyng loue with extreme payne   
- Most cruelly distrains my hart:   
- When that my teares, as floudes of rayne,   
- Beare witnes of my wofull smart:   
- When sighes haue wasted so my breath,   
- That I lye at the poynte of death:   
-   I call to minde the nauye greate,   
- That the Grekes brought to Troye towne:   
- And how the boysteous windes did beate   
- Their shyps, and rente their sayles adowne,   
- Till Agamemnons daughters bloode   
- Appeasde the goddes, that them withstode.   
-   And how that in those ten yeres warre,   
- Full many a bloudye dede was done,   
- And many a lord, that came full farre,   
- There caught his bane (alas) to sone:   
- And many a good knight ouerronne,   
- Before the Grekes had Helene wonne.   
-   Then thinke I thus: sithe suche repayre,   
- So longe time warre of valiant men,   
- Was all to winne a ladye fayre:   
- Shall I not learne to suffer then,   
- And thinke my life well spent to be,   
- Seruyng a worthier wight than she?   
-   Therfore I neuer will repent,   
- But paynes contented stil endure.   
- For like as when, rough winter spent,   
- The pleasant spring straight draweth in vre:       
- So after ragyng stormes of care   
- Ioyful at length may be my fare.   
    
## O happy dames

  Complaint of the absence of her louer being vpon the sea.   

  - O Happy dames, that may embrace   
- The frute of your delight,   
- Help to bewaile the wofull case,   
- And eke the heauy plight   
- Of me, that wonted to reioyce   
- The fortune of my pleasant choyce:   
- Good Ladies, help to fill my moorning voyce.   
-   In ship, freight with rememberance   
- Of thoughts, and pleasures past,   
- He sailes that hath in gouernance   
- My life, while it wil last:   
- With scalding sighes, for lack of gale,   
- Furdering his hope, that is his sail   
- Toward me, the swete port of his auail.   
-   Alas, how oft in dreames I se   
- Those eyes, that were my food,   
- Which somtime so delited me,   
- That yet they do me good.   
- Wherwith I wake with his returne,   
- Whose absent flame did make me burne.   
- But when I find the lacke, Lord how I mourne?   
-   When other louers in armes acrosse,   
- Reioyce their chiefe delight:   
- Drowned in teares to mourne my losse,   
- I stand the bitter night,   
- In my window, where I may see,   
- Before the windes how the cloudes flee.   
- Lo, what a mariner loue hath made me.   
-   And in grene waues when the salt flood   
- Doth rise, by rage of winde:   
- A thousand fansies in that mood   
- Assayle my restlesse mind.   
- Alas, now drencheth my swete fo,   
- That with the spoyle of my hart did go,       
- And left me but (alas) why did he so?   
-   And when the seas waxe calme againe,   
- To chase fro me annoye.   
- My doutfull hope doth cause me plaine:   
- So dreade cuts of my ioye.   
- Thus is my wealth mingled with wo,   
- And of ech thought a dout doth growe,   
- Now he comes, will he come? alas, no no.   
    
## In winters iust returne

  Complaint of a diyng louer refused vpon his ladies iniust   mistaking of his writyng.   

  - In winters iust returne, when Boreas gan his raigne,   
- And euery tree vnclothed fast, as nature taught them plaine:   
-   In misty morning darke, as sheepe are then in holde,   
- I hyed me fast, it sat me on, my sheepe for to vnfolde.   
-   And as it is a thing, that louers haue by fittes,   
- Vnder a palm I heard one crye, as he had lost hys wittes.   
-   Whose voice did ring so shrill, in vttering of his plaint,   
- That I amazed was to hear, how loue could hym attaint.   
-   Ah wretched man (quod he) come death, and ridde thys wo:   
- A iust reward, a happy end, if it may chaunce thee so.   
-   Thy pleasures past haue wrought thy wo, without redresse.   
- If thou hadst neuer felt no ioy, thy smart had bene the lesse.   
-   And retchlesse of his life, he gan both sighe and grone,   
- A rufull thing me thought, it was, to hear him make such mone.   
-   Thou cursed pen (sayd he) wo worth the bird thee bare,   
- The man, the knife, and all that made thee, wo be to their share.   
-   Wo worth the time, and place, where I so could endite.   
- And wo be it yet once agayne, the pen that so can write.   
-   Vnhappy hand, it had ben happy time for me,   
- If, when to writethou[^]: write thou

 learned first, vnioynted hadst thou be.   
-   Thus cursed he himself, and euery other wight,   
- Saue her alone whom loue him bound to serue both day & night.   
-   Which when I heard, and saw, how he himselfe fordid,   
- Against the ground with bloudy strokes, himself euen there to rid:   
-   Had ben my heart of flint, it must haue melted tho:       
- For in my life I neuer saw a man so full of wo.   
-   With teares, for his redresse, I rashly to him ran,   
- And in my armes I caught him fast, and thus I spake hym than.   
-   What wofull wight art thou, that in such heauy case   
- Tormentes thy selfe with such despite, here in this desert place?   
-   Wherwith, as all agast, fulfild wyth ire, and dred,   
- He cast on me a staring loke, with colour pale, and ded.   
-   Nay, what art thou (quod he) that in this heauy plight,   
- Doest finde me here, most wofull wretch, that life hath in despight?   
-   I am (quoth I) but poore, and simple in degre:   
- A shepardes charge I haue in hand, vnworthy though I be.   
-   With that he gaue a sighe, as though the skye should fall:   
- And lowd (alas) he shryked oft, and Shepard, gan he call,   
-   Come, hie the fast at ones, and print it in thy hart:   
- So thou shalt know, and I shall tell the, giltlesse how I smart.   
-   His backe against the tree, sore febled all with faint,   
- With weary sprite he stretcht him vp: and thus hee told his plaint.   
-   Ones in my hart (quoth he) it chanced me to loue   
- Such one, in whom hath nature wrought, her cu[n]ning for to proue.   
-   And sure I can not say, but many yeres were spent,   
- With such good will so recompenst, as both we were content.   
-   Wherto then I me bound, and she likewise also,   
- The sonne should runne his course awry, ere we this faith forgo.   
-   Who ioied then, but I? who had this worldes blisse?   
- Who might compare a life to mine, that neuer thought on this?   
-   But dwelling in thys truth, amid my greatest ioy,   
- Is me befallen a greater losse, than Priam had of Troy.   
-   She is reuersed clene: and beareth me in hand,   
- That my desertes haue giue[n] her cause to break thys faithful band.   
-   And for my iust excuse auaileth no defense.   
- Now knowest thou all: I can no more, but shepard, hye the hense:   
-   And giue him leaue to die, that may no lenger liue:   
- Whose record lo I claime to haue, my death, I doe forgiue.   
-   And eke when I am gone, be bolde to speake it plain:   
- Thou hast seen dye the truest man, that euer loue did pain.   
-   Wherwith he turned him round, and gasping oft for breath,   
- Into his armes a tree he raught, and sayd, welcome my death:   
-   Welcome a thousand fold, now dearer vnto me,   
- Than should, without her loue to liue, an emperour to be.   
-   Thus, in this wofull state, he yelded vp the ghost:   
- And little knoweth his lady, what a louer she hath lost.   
-   Whose death when I beheld, no maruail was it, right       
- For pitie though my heart did blede, to see so piteous sight.   
-   My blood from heat to colde oft changed wonders sore:   
- A thousand troubles there I found I neuer knew before.   
-   Twene dread, and dolour so my sprites were brought in feare,   
- That long it was ere I could call to minde, what I did there,   
-   But, as eche thing hath end, so had these paynes of mine:   
- The furies past, and I my wits restord by length of time.   
-   Then, as I could deuise, to seke I thought it best,   
- Where I might finde some worthy place, for such a corse to rest.   
-   And in my mind it came: from thence not farre away,   
- Where Chreseids loue, king Priams so[n]ne, [the] worthy Troilus lay.   
-   By him I made his tomb, in token he was treew:   
- And, as to him belonged well, I couered it with bleew.   
-   Whose soule, by Angels power, departed not so sone,   
- But to the heauens, lo it fled, for to receiue his dome.   
    
## Good Ladies

  Complaint of the absence of her louer being vpon the sea.   

  - Good Ladies, ye that haue your pleasures in exile,   
- Step in your foote, come take a place, & moorne with me a while   
-   And such as by their lordes do set but little price,   
- Let them sit still: it skilles them not what chance come on [the] dice.   
-   But ye whom loue hath bound by ordre of desire   
- To loue your lords, whose good desertes none other wold require:   
-   Come ye yet ones again, and set your foote by mine,   
- Whose wofull plight and sorrowes great no tong may wel define.   
-   My loue an d[^]: and

 lord, alas, in whom consistes my wealth,   
- Hath fortune sent to passe the seas in hazarde of his health.   
-   Whome I was wont tembrace with well contented minde   
- Is now amidde the foming floods at pleasure of the winde.   
-   Where God well him preserue, and sone him home me send.   
- Without which hope, my life (alas) wer shortly at an end.   
-   Whose absence yet, although my hope doth tell me plaine,   
- With short returne he comes anon, yet ceasith not my payne.   
-   The fearfull dreames I haue, oft times do greue me so:   
- That when I wake, I lye in doute, where they be true, or no.   
-   Sometime the roring seas (me semes) do grow so hye:   
- That my dere Lord (ay me alas) me thinkes I se him die.   
-   Another time the same doth tell me: he is cumne:       
- And playeng, where I shall him find with his faire little sonne.   
-   So forth I go apace to se that leefsom sight.   
- And with a kisse, me think, I say: welcome my lord, my knight:   
-   Welcome my swete, alas, the stay of my welfare.   
- Thy presence bringeth forth a truce atwixt me, & my care.   
-   Then liuely doth he loke, and salueth me againe,   
- And saith: my dere, how is it now, that you haue all thys paine?   
-   Wherwith the heauy cares: that heapt are in my brest,   
- Breake forth, and me dischargen clene of all my huge vnrest.   
-   But when I me awake, and finde it but a dreme,   
- The anguishe of my former wo beginneth more extreme:   
-   And me tormenteth so, that vnneath may I finde   
- Sum hidden place, wherein to slake the gnawing of my mind.   
-   Thus euery way you se, with absence how I burn:   
- And for my wound no cure I find, but hope of good return.   
-   Saue whan I think, by sowre how swete is felt the more:   
- It doth abate som of my paines, that I abode before.   
-   And then vnto my self I say: when we shal meete.   
- But litle while shall seme this paine, the ioy shal be so sweete.   
-   Ye windes, I you coniure in chiefest of your rage,   
- That ye my lord me safely sende, my sorowes to asswage:   
-   And that I may not long abide in this excesse.   
- Do your good will, to cure a wight, that liueth in distresse.   
    
## Geue place ye louers

  A praise of his loue: wherin he   teproueth[^]: reproueth

 them that compare   their Ladies with his.   

  - Geue place ye louers, here before   
- That spent your bostes and bragges in vaine:   
- My Ladies beawtie passeth more   
- The best of yours, I dare well sayen,   
- Than doth the sonne, the candle light:   
- Or brightest day, the darkest night.   
-   And thereto hath a trothe as iust,   
- As had Penelope the fayre.   
- For what she saith, ye may it trust,   
- As it by writing sealed were.   
- And vertues hath she many moe,   
- Than I with pen haue skill to showe.   
-   I coulde rehearse, if that I wolde,   
- The whole effect of natures plaint,       
- When she had lost the perfit mold,   
- The like to whom she could not paint:   
- With wringyng handes howe she dyd cry,   
- And what she said, I know it, I.   
-   I knowe, she swore with ragyng mynd:   
- Her kingdom onely set apart,   
- There was no losse, by lawe of kind,   
- That could haue gone so nere her hart.   
- And this was chiefly all her payne:   
- She coulde not make the lyke agayne.   
-   Sith nature thus gaue her the prayse,   
- To be the chiefest worke she wrought:   
- In faith, me thinke, some better waies   
- On your behalfe might well be sought,   
- Then to compare (as ye haue done)   
- To matche the candle with the sonne.   
    
## Although I had a check

  To the Ladie that scorned her louer.   

  - Although I had a check,   
- To geue the mate is hard.   
- For I haue found a neck,   
- To kepe my men in gard.   
- And you that hardy ar   
- To geue so great assay   
- Vnto a man of warre,   
- To driue his men away,   
- I rede you, take good hede,   
- And marke this foolish verse:   
- For I will so prouide,   
- That I will haue your ferse.   
- And when your ferse is had,   
- And all your warre is done:   
- Then shall your selfe be glad   
- To ende that you begon.   
- For yf by chance I winne   
- Your person the in feeld:   
- To late then come you in       
- your selfe to me to yeld.   
- For I will vse my power,   
- As captain full of might,   
- And such I will deuour,   
- As vse to shew me spight.   
-   And for because you gaue   
- Me checke in such degre,   
- This vantage loe I haue:   
- Now checke, and garde to the.   
-   Defend it, if thou may:   
- Stand stiffe, in thine estate.   
- For sure I will assay,   
- If I can giue the mate.   
    
## To dearely had I bought

  A warning to the louer how he is abused by his loue.   

  - To dearely had I bought my grene and youthfull yeres,   
- If in mine age I could not finde when craft for loue apperes.   
-   And seldom though I come in court among the rest:   
- Yet can I iudge in colours dim as depe as can the best.   
-   Where grefe tormentes the man that suffreth secret smart,   
- To breke it forth vnto som frend it easeth well the hart.   
-   So standes it now with me for my beloued frend.   
- This case is thine for whom I fele such torment of my minde.   
-   And for thy sake I burne so in my secret brest   
- That till thou know my hole disseyse my hart can haue no rest.   
-   I see how thine abuse hath wrested so thy wittes,   
- That all it yeldes to thy desire, and folowes the by fittes.   
-   Where thou hast loued so long with hart and all thy power.   
- I se thee fed with fayned wordes, thy fredom to deuour.   
-   I know, (though she say nay, and would it well withstand)   
- When in her grace thou held the most, she bare the but in hand.   
-   I see her pleasant chere in chiefest of thy suite:   
- Whan thou art gone, I se him come, that gathers vp the fruite.   
-   And eke in thy respect I se the base degre   
- Of him to whom she gaue the hart that promised was to the.,   
-   I se (what would you more) stode neuer man so sure   
- On womans word, but wisedome would mistrust it to endure.       
    
## O lothsome place where I

  The forsaken louer describeth & forsaketh loue.   

  - O Lothsome place where I   
- Haue sene and herd my dere,   
- When in my hert her eye   
- Hath made her thought appere,   
- By glsiming[^]: glimsing

 with such grace   
- As fortune it ne would,   
- That lasten any space   
- Betwene vs lenger should.   
-   As fortune did auance,   
- To further my desire:   
- Euen so hath fortunes chance   
- Throwen all ammiddes the myre.   
- And that I haue deserued   
- With true and faithful hart,   
- Is to his handes reserued   
- That neuer felt the smart.   
-   But happy is that man,   
- That scaped hath the griefe   
- That loue well teche him can   
- By wanting his reliefe.   
- A scourge to quiet mindes   
- It is, who taketh hede,   
- A comon plage that bindes,   
- A trauell without mede.   
-   This gift it hath also,   
- Who so enioies it most,   
- A thousand troubles grow   
- To vexe his weried ghost.   
- And last it may not long   
- The truest thing of all   
- And sure the greatest wrong   
- That is within this thrall.   
-   But sins thou desert place   
- Canst giue me no accompt   
- Of my desired grace   
- That I to haue was wont,   
- farewel thou hast me tought       
- To thinke me not the furst,   
- That loue hath set aloft.   
- And casten in the dust.   
    
## As oft as I behold and se

  The louer describes his restlesse state.   

  - As oft as I behold and se   
- The soueraigne bewtie that me bound:   
- The nier my comfort is to me,   
- Alas the fresher is my wound.   
-   As flame doth quenche by rage of fire,   
- And running slremes[^]: stremes

 consume by raine:   
- So doth the sight, that I desire,   
- Appease my grief and deadely paine,   
-   First when I saw those cristall streames,   
- whose bewtie made my mortall wound:   
- I little thought within her beames   
- So swete a venom to haue found.   
-   But wilfull will did prick me forth,   
- And blind Cupide did whippe and guide:   
- Force made me take my griefe in worth:   
- My fruitles hope my harme did hide.   
-   As cruell waues full oft be found   
- Against the rockes to rore and cry:   
- So doth my hart full oft rebound   
- Ageinst my brest full bitterly.   
-   I fall, and se mine own decay,   
- As on that beares flame in hys brest,   
- Forgets in paine to put away   
- The thing that bredeth mine vnrest.   
    
## Though I regarded not 

  The louer excuseth himself of suspected change.   

  - Though I regarded not   
- The promise made by me,   
- or passed not to spot   
- My faith and honeste:       
- Yet were my fancie strange,   
- And wilfull will to wite,   
- If I sought now to change   
- A falkon for a kite.   
-  All men might well dispraise   
- My wit and enterprise,   
- If I estemed a pese   
- Aboue a perle in price:   
- Or iudged the oule in sight   
- The sparehauke to excell,   
- which flieth but in the night,   
- As all men know right well:   
-   Or if I sought to saile   
- Into the brittle port,   
- where anker hold doth faile,   
- To such as doe resort,   
- And leaue the hauen sure,   
- where blowes no blustring winde,   
- Nor fickelnesse in vre   
- So farforth as I finde.   
-   No, thinke me not so light,   
- Nor of so chorlish kinde,   
- Though it lay in my might   
- My bondage to vnbinde,   
- That I would leue the hinde   
- To hunt the ganders fo.   
- No no I haue no minde   
- To make exchanges so:   
-   Nor yet to change at all.   
- For think it may not be   
- That I should seke to fall   
- From my felicite,   
- Desyrous for to win,   
- And loth for to forgo,   
- Or new change to begin:   
- How may all this be so?   
-   The fire it can not freze:   
- For it is not his kinde,   
- Nor true loue cannot lese   
- The constance of the minde.   
- Yet as sone shall the fire   
- want heat to blaze and burn,       
- As I in such desire,   
- Haue once a thought to turne.   
    
## Wrapt in my carelesse cloke

  A carelesse man, scorning and   describing, the suttle vsage of women towarde their louers.   

  - Wrapt in my carelesse cloke, as I walke to and fro:   
- I se, how loue ca[n] shew, what force there reigneth in his bow   
-   And how he shoteth eke, a hardy hart to wound:   
- And where he glanceth by agayne, that litle hurt is found.   
-   For seldom is it sene, he woundeth hartes alike.   
- The tone may rage, when tothers loue is often farre to seke.   
-   All this I se, with more: and wonder thinketh me:   
- Howe he can strike the one so sore, and leaue the other fre.   
-   I se, that wounded wight, that suffreth all this wrong:   
- How he is fed with yeas, and nayes, and liueth all to long.   
-   In silence though I kepe such secretes to my self:   
- Yet do I se, how she somtime doth yeld a loke by stelth:   
-   As though it seemd, ywys I will not lose the so.   
- When in her hart so swete a thought did neuer truely go.   
-   Then say I thus: alas, that man is farre from blisse:   
- That doth receiue for his relief none other gayn, but this.   
-   And she, that fedes him so, I fele, and finde it plain:   
- Is but to glory in her power, that ouer such can reign.   
-   Nor are such graces spent, but when she thinkes, that he,   
- A weried man is fully bent such fansies to let flie:   
-   Then to.[^]: to

 retain him stil she wrasteth new her grace,   
- And smileth lo, as though she would forthwith the man embrace.   
-   But when the proofe is made to try such lokes withall:   
- He findeth then the place all voyde, and fraighted full of gall.   
-   Lorde what abuse is this? who can such women praise?   
- That for their glory do deuise to vse such crafty wayes.   
-   I, that among the rest do sit, and mark the row,   
- Fynde, that in her is greater craft, then is in twenty mo.   
-   Whose tender yeres, alas, with wyles so well are spedde:   
- What will she do, when hory heares are powdred in her hedde?       
    
## Martiall, the thinges

  The meanes to attain happy life.   

  - Martiall, the thinges that do attayn   
- The happy life, be these, I finde.   
- The richesse left, not got with pain:   
- The frutefull ground: the quiet mynde:   
- The egall frend, no grudge, no strife:   
- No charge of rule, nor gouernance:   
- Without disease the healthfull lyfe:   
- The houshold of continuance:   
- The meane diet, no delicate fare:   
- Trew wisdom ioyned with simplenesse:   
- The night discharged of all care,   
- Where wine the wit may not oppresse:   
- The faithful wife, without debate:   
- Suche slepes, as may begyle the night:   
- Contented with thine owne estate,   
- Ne wish for death, ne feare his might.   
    
## Of thy lyfe, Thomas

  Praise of meane and constant estate.   

  - Of thy lyfe, Thomas, this compasse well mark:   
- Not aye with full sayles the hye seas to beat:   
- Ne by coward dred, in shonning stormes dark,   
- On shalow shores thy keel in perill freat.   
- Who so gladly halseth the golden meane,   
- Voyde of dangers aduisdly hath his home   
- Not with lothsom muck, as a den vncleane:   
- Nor palacelyke, wherat disdayn may glome.   
- The lofty pyne the great winde often riues:   
- With violenter swey falne turrets stepe:   
- Lightninges assault the hye mountains, and cliues,   
- A hart well stayd, in ouerthwartes depe,   
- Hopeth amendes: in swete, doth feare the sowre.   
- God, that sendeth, withdraweth winter sharp.   
- Now ill, not aye thus: once Phebus to lowre   
- With bow vnbent shall cesse, and frame to harp.   
- His voyce. In straite estate appere thou stout:   
- And so wisely, when lucky gale of winde       
- All thy puft sailes shall fil, loke well about:   
- Take in a ryft: hast is wast, profe doth finde.   
    
## The great Macedon

  Praise of certain psalmes of Dauid, translated by   sir. T. w. the elder.   

  - The great Macedon, that out of Persie chased   
- Darius, of whose huge power all Asie rong,   
- In the rich ark dan Homers rimes he placed,   
- Who fayned gestes of heathen princes song.   
- What holy graue? what worthy sepulture   
- To Wiattes Psalmes should Christians then purchase?   
- Where he doth paint the liuely faith, and pure,   
- The stedfast hope, the swete returne to grace   
- Of iust Dauid, by perfite penitence.   
- Where rulers may se in a mirrour clere   
- The bitter frute of false concupiscence:   
- How Iewry bought Vrias death full dere.   
- In princes hartes gods scourge imprinted depe,   
- Ought them awake, out of their sinfull slepe.   
    
## Dyuers thy death

  Of the death of the same sir. T. w.   

  - Dyuers thy death doe diuersly bemone.   
- Some, that in presence of thy liuelyhed   
- Lurked, whose brestes enuy with hate had swolne,   
- Yeld Ceasars teares vpon Pompeius hed.   
- Some, that watched with the murdrers knife,   
- With egre thirst to drink thy giltlesse blood,   
- Whose practise brake by happy ende of lyfe,   
- Wepe enuious teares to heare thy fame so good.   
- But I, that knew what harbred in that hed:   
- What vertues rare were temperd in that brest:   
- Honour the place, that such a iewell bred,   
- And kisse the ground, whereas thy corse doth rest,   
- With vapord eyes: from whence such streames auayl,   
- As Pyramus dyd on Thisbes brest bewail.       
    
## W. resteth here

  Of the same.   

  - W. resteth here, that quick could neuer rest:   
- Whose heauenly giftes encreased by disdayn,   
- And vertue sank the deper in his brest.   
- Such profit he by enuy could obtain.   
-   A hed, where wisdom misteries did frame:   
- Whose hammers bet styll in that liuely brayn,   
- As on a stithe: where that some work of fame   
- Was dayly wrought, to turne to Britaines gayn.   
-   A visage, stern, and myld: where bothe did grow,   
- Vice to contemne, in vertue to reioyce:   
- Amid great stormes, whom grace assured so,   
- To lyue vpright, and smile at fortunes choyce.   
-   A hand, that taught, what might be sayd in ryme:   
- That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit:   
- A mark, the which (vnparfited, for time)   
- Some may approche, but neuer none shall hit.   
-   A toung, that serued in forein realmes his king:   
- Whose courteous talke to vertue did enflame.   
- Eche noble hart: a worthy guide to bring   
- Our English youth, by trauail, vnto fame.   
-   An eye, whose iudgement none affect could blinde,   
- Frendes to allure, and foes to reconcile:   
- Whose persing loke did represent a mynde   
- With vertue fraught, reposed, voyd of gyle.   
-   A hart, where drede was neuer so imprest,   
- To hyde the thought, that might the trouth auance:   
- In neyther fortune loft, nor yet represt,   
- To swell in wealth, or yeld vnto mischance.   
-   A valiant corps, where force, and beawty met:   
- Happy, alas, to happy, but for foes:   
- Liued, and ran the race, that nature set:   
- Of manhodes, shape where she the molde did lose.   
-   But to the heauens that simple soule is fled:   
- Which left with such, as couet Christ to know,   
- Witnesse of faith, that neuer shall be ded:   
- Sent for our helth, but not receiued so.   
- Thus, for our gilte, this iewel haue we lost:   
- The earth his bones, the heauens possesse his gost.       
    
## Thassirian king in peace

  Of Sardinapalus dishonorable life, and miserable death.   

  - Thassirian king in peace, with foule desire,   
- And filthy lustes, that staynd his regall hart   
- In warre that should set princely hartes on fire:   
- Did yeld, vanquisht for want of marciall art.   
- The dint of swordes from kisses semed strange:   
- And harder, than his ladies syde, his targe:   
- From glutton feastes, to souldiars fare a change:   
- His helmet, farre aboue a garlands charge.   
- Who scace the name of manhode did retayn   
- Drenched in slouth, and womanish delight,   
- Feble of sprite, impacient of pain:   
- When he had lost his honor, and his right:   
- Proud, time of wealth, in stormes appalled with drede,   
- Murthered himself, to shew some manful dede.   
    
## Layd in my quiet bed

  How no age is content with his own estate, & how the age of   children is the happiest, if they had skill to vnderstand it.   

  - Layd in my quiet bed, in study as I were,   
- I saw within my troubled head, a heape of thoughtes appere:   
-   And euery thought did shew so liuely in myne eyes,   
- That now I sighed, & the[n] I smilde, as cause of thought doth ryse.   
-   I saw the lytle boy in thought, how oft that he   
- Did wish of god, to scape the rod, a tall yongman to be.   
-   The yongman eke that feles, his bones with paines opprest,   
- How he would be a rich olde man, to lyue, and lye at rest.   
-   The rich oldman that sees his end draw on so sore,   
- How he would be a boy agayn, to liue somuch[^]: so much

 the more.   
-   Wherat full oft I smilde, to se, how all these three,   
- From boy to man, from man to boy, would chop & change degree.       
-   And musyng thus I thynk, the case is very strange,   
- That man from welth, to lyue in wo, doth euer seke to change.   
-   Thus thoughtfull as I lay, I saw my wytherd skyn,   
- How it doth show my dented chewes, the flesh was worne so thyn:   
-   And eke my tothelesse chaps, the gates of my rightway,   
- That opes and shuts, as I do speake, doe thus vnto me say:   
-   Thy white and hoarish heares, the messengers of age,   
- That shew, like lines of true belief, that this life doth asswage,   
-   Byds thee lay hand, and fele them hanging on thy chin:   
- The whiche do write two ages past, the third now comming in.   
-   Hang vp therfore the bit of thy yong wanton tyme:   
- And thou that therin beaten art, the happiest life define.   
-   Wherat I sighed, and sayd, farewell, my wonted ioy:   
- Trusse vp thy pack, and trudge from me to euery litle boy:   
-   And tell them thus from me, theyr tyme most happy is:   
- If, to their time, they reason had to know the trueth of this.   
    
## The stormes are past

  Bonum est mihi quod humiliasti me.   

  - The stormes are past these cloudes are ouerblowne,   
- And humble chere great rygour hath represt:   
- For the defaute is set a paine foreknowne,   
- And pacience graft in a determed brest.   
- And in the hart where heapes of griefes were growne,   
- The swete reuenge hath planted mirth and rest,   
- No company so pleasant as myne owne.   
- Thraldom at large hath made this prison fre,   
- Danger well past remembred workes delight:   
- Of lingring doutes such hope is sprong pardie,   
- That nought I finde displeasaunt in my sight:   
- But when my glasse presented vnto me.   
- The curelesse wound that bledeth day and nyght,   
- To think (alas) such hap should graunted be   
- Vnto a wretch that hath no hart to fight,   
- To spill that blood that hath so oft bene shed,   
- For Britannes sake (alas) and now is ded.   
    
## My Ratclif

  Exhortacion to learne by others trouble.       

  - My Ratclif, when thy rechlesse youth offendes:   
- Receue thy scourge by others chastisement.   
- For such callyng, when it workes none amendes:   
- Then plages are sent without aduertisement.   
- Yet Salomon sayd, the wronged shall recure:   
- But Wiat said true, the skarre doth aye endure.   
    
## The fansy, which that I

  The fansie of a weried louer.   

  - The fansy, which that I haue serued long,   
- That hath alway bene enmy to myne ease,   
- Semed of late to rue vpon my wrong,   
- And bad me flye the cause of my misease.   
- And I forthwith dyd prease out of the throng,   
- That thought by flight my painfull hart to please   
- Som other way: tyll I saw faith more strong:   
- And to my self I sayd: alas, those dayes   
- In vayn were spent, to runne the race so long.   
- And with that thought, I met my guyde, that playn   
- Out of the way wherin I wandred wrong,   
- Brought me amiddes the hylles, in base Bullayn:   
- Where I am now, as restlesse to remayn,   
- Against my will, full pleased with my payn.

# Tottel — Songes and Sonettes — 1557

      
# Songes.

  by   Thomas Wyatt    
## The longe loue

  The louer for shamefastnesse hideth his desire within his faithfull hart.   

  - The longe loue, that in my thought I harber,   
- And in my hart doth kepe his residence,   
- Into my face preaseth with bold pretence,   
- And there campeth, displaying his banner.   
- She that me learns to loue, and to suffer,   
- And willes that my trust, and lustes negligence   
- Be reined by reason, shame, and reuerence,   
- With his hardinesse takes displeasure.   
- Wherwith loue to the hartes forest he fleeth,   
- Leauyng his enterprise with paine and crye,   
- And there him hideth and not appeareth.   
- What may I do? when my maister feareth,   
- But in the field with him to liue and dye,   
- For good is the life, endyng faithfully.   
    
## Yet was I neuer

  The louer waxeth wiser, and will not die for affection   

  - Yet was I neuer of your loue agreued,   
- Nor neuer shall, while that my life doth last:   
- But of hatyng my self, that date is past,   
- And teares continual sore haue me weried.   
- I will not yet in my graue be buried,   
- Nor on my tombe your name haue fixed fast,   
- As cruel cause, that did my sprite sone hast.   
- From thunhappy boones by great sighes stirred.   
- Then if an hart of amorous fayth and will   
- Content your minde withouten doyng grief:   
- Please it you so to this to do relief.   
- If otherwise you seke for to fulfill   
- Your wrath: you erre, and shal not as you wene,   
- And you your self the cause therof haue bene.       
    
## Was neuer file yet half

  The abused louer seeth his foly, and entendeth to trust no more.   

  - Was neuer file yet half so well yfiled,   
- To file a file for any smithes intent,   
- As I was made a filyng instrument,   
- To frame other, while that I was begiled.   
- But reason, loe, hath at my foly smiled,   
- And pardoned me, sins that I me repent   
- Of my lost yeres, and of my time mispent.   
- For youth led me, and falshod me misguided.   
- Yet, this trust I haue of great apparence:   
- Sins that disceit is ay returnable,   
- Of verye force it is agreable,   
- That therwithall be done the recompence.   
- Then gile begiled playnd should be neuer,   
- And the reward is little trust for euer.   
    
## The liuely sparkes

  The louer describeth his being striken with sight of his loue.   

  - The liuely sparkes, that issue from those eyes,   
- Against the which there vaileth no defence,   
- Haue perst my hart, and done it none offence,   
- With quakyng pleasure, more then once or twise.   
- Was neuer man could any thing deuise,   
- Sunne beames to turne with so great vehemence   
- To dase mans sight, as by their bright presence   
- Dased am I, much like vnto the gise   
- Of on striken with dint of lightenyng,   
- Blind with the stroke, and erryng here and there.   
- So call I for helpe, I not when, nor where,   
- The payne of my fall paciently bearyng.   
- For streight after the blase (as is no wonder)   
- Of deadly noyse heare I the fearfull thunder.       
    
## Svch vain thought

  The waueryng louer wylleth, and dreadeth, to moue his desire.   

  - Svch vain thought, as wonted to mislead me   
- In desert hope by well assured mone,   
- Makes me from company to liue alone,   
- In folowyng her whom reason bids me fle.   
- And after her my hart would faine be gone:   
- But armed sighes my way do stop anone,   
- Twixt hope and dread lockyng my libertie.   
- So fleeth she by gentle crueltie.   
- Yet as I gesse vnder disdainfull brow   
- One beame of ruth is in her cloudy loke:   
- Which comfortes the mind, that erst for fear shoke.   
- That bolded straight the way then seke I how   
- To vtter forth the smart I bide within:   
- But such it is, I not how to begyn.   
    
## Vnstable dreame

  The louer hauing dreamed enioying of his loue, complaineth that   the dreame is not either longer or truer.   

  - Vnstable dreame, accordyng to the place,   
- Be stedfast ones, or els at least be true.   
- By tasted swetenesse, make me not to rew   
- The soden losse of thy false fained grace.   
- By good respect in such a dangerous case   
- Thou broughtest not her into these tossing seas,   
- But madest my sprite to liue my care tencrease,   
- My body in tempest her delight timbrace.   
- The body dead, the sprite had his desire.   
- Painelesse was thone, the other in delight.   
- Why then alas did it not kepe it right,   
- But thus return to leape in to the fire:   
- And where it was at wishe, could not remayne?   
- Such mockes of dreames do turne to deadly payne.       
    
## Ye that in loue finde luck

  The louer vnhappy biddeth happy louers reioice in Maie, while he   waileth that moneth to him most vnlucky.   

  - Ye that in loue finde luck and swete abundance,   
- And lyue in lust of ioyfull iolitie,   
- Aryse for shame, doway[^]: do way

 your sluggardy:   
- Arise I say, do May some obseruance:   
- Let me in bed lye, dreamyng of mischance.   
- Let me remember my missehappes vnhappy,   
- That me betide in May most commonly:   
- As one whom loue list little to aduance.   
- Stephan said true, that my natiuitie   
- Mischanced was with the ruler of May.   
- He gest (I proue) of that the veritie.   
- In May my wealth, and eke my wittes, I say,   
- Haue stand so oft in such perplexitie.   
- Ioye: let me dreame of your felicitie.   
    
## If waker care

  The louer confesseth him in loue with Phillis.   

  - If waker care: if sodayn pale colour:   
- If many sighes, with litle speach to plaine:   
- Now ioye, now wo: if they my chere distayne:   
- For hope of small, if much to fear therfore,   
- To haste, or slack: my pace to lesse, or more:   
- Be signe of loue: then do I loue agayne.   
- If thou aske whom: sure sins I did refrayne   
- Brunet, that set my welth in such a rore,   
- Thunfayned chere of Phillis hath the place,   
- That Brunet had: she hath, and euer shall:   
- She from my self now hath me in her grace:   
- She hath in hand my wit, my will, and all:   
- My hart alone welworthy she doth stay,   
- Without whose helpe skant do I liue a day.       
    
## Cesar, when that the

  Of others fained sorrow, and the louers fained mirth.   

  - Cesar, when that the traytour of Egypt   
- With thonorable hed did him present,   
- Coueryng his hartes gladnesse, did represent   
- Plaint with his teares outward, as it is writ.   
- Eke Hannibal, when fortune him outshyt   
- Clene from his reigne, and from all his entent,   
- Laught to his folke, whom sorow did torment,   
- His cruel despite for to disgorge and quit.   
- So chanceth me, that euery passion   
- The minde hideth by colour contrary,   
- With fayned visage, now sad, now mery.   
- Wherby, if that I laugh at any season:   
- It is because I haue none other way   
- To cloke my care, but vnder sport and play.   
    
## Eche man me telth

  Of change in minde.   

  - Eche man me telth, I change most my deuise:   
- And, on my faith, me thinke it good reason   
- To change purpose, like after the season.   
- For in ech case to kepe still one guise   
- Is mete for them, that would be taken wise.   
- And I am not of such maner condicion:   
- But treated after a diuers fashion:   
- And therupon my diuersnesse doth rise.   
- But you, this diuersnesse that blamen most,   
- Change you no more, but still after one rate   
- Treat you me well: and kepe you in that state.   
- And while with me doth dwell this weried gost,   
- My word nor I shall not be variable,   
- But alwaies one, your owne both firme and stable.   
    
## Some fowles there be

  How the louer perisheth in his delight, as the flie in the fire.       

  - Some fowles there be, that haue so perfit sight   
- Against the sunne their eies for to defend:   
- And some, because the light doth them offend,   
- Neuer appeare, but in the darke, or night.   
- Other reioyce, to se the fire so bryght,   
- And wene to play in it, as they pretend:   
- But find contrary of it, that they intend.   
- Alas, of that sort may I be, by right.   
- For to withstand her loke I am not able:   
- Yet can I not hide me in no dark place:   
- So foloweth me remembrance of that face:   
- That with my teary eyn, swolne, and vnstable,   
- My desteny to beholde her doth me lead:   
- And yet I knowe, I runne into the glead.   
    
## Because I still kept thee

  Against his tong that failed to vtter his sutes.   

  - Because I still kept thee fro lyes, and blame,   
- And to my power alwayes thee honoured,   
- Vnkind tongue, to yll hast thou me rendred,   
- For such desert to do me wreke and shame.   
- In nede of succour most when that I am,   
- To aske reward: thou standst like one afraied,   
- Alway most cold: and if one word be sayd,   
- As in a dreame, vnperfit is the same.   
- And ye salt teares, agaynst my wyll eche nyght,   
- That are wyth me, when I would be alone:   
- Then are ye gone, when I should make my mone.   
- And ye so ready sighes, to make me shright,   
- Then are ye slacke, when that ye should outstart.   
- And onely doth my loke declare my hart.   
    
## I find no peace

  Description of the contrarious passions in a louer.   

  - I Find no peace, and all my warre is done:   
- I feare, and hope: I burne, and frese like yse:       
- I flye aloft, yet can I not arise:   
- And nought I haue, and all the worlde I season.   
- That lockes nor loseth, holdeth me in pryson,   
- And holdes me not, yet can I scape no wise:   
- Nor lettes me lyue, nor dye, at my deuise,   
- And yet of death it geueth me occasion.   
- Without eye I se, without tong I playne:   
- I wish to perysh, yet I aske for helth:   
- I loue another, and thus I hate my selfe.   
- I fede me in sorow, and laugh in all my payne.   
- Lo, thus displeaseth me both death and life.   
- And my delight is causer of this strife.   
    
## My galley charged

  The louer compareth his state to a shippe in perilous storme   tossed on the sea.   

  - My galley charged with forgetfulnesse,   
- Through sharpe seas, in winter nightes doth passe,   
- Twene rocke, and rocke: and eke my fo (alas)   
- That is my lord, stereth with cruelnesse:   
- And euery houre, a thought in readinesse,   
- As though that death were light, in such a case.   
- An endlesse wynd doth teare the sayle apace   
- Of forced sighes, and trusty fearfulnesse.   
- A rayne of teares, a clowde of darke disdayne   
- Haue done the weried coardes great hinderance,   
- Wrethed with errour, and wyth ignorance.   
- The starres be hidde, that leade me to this payne.   
- Drownde is reason that should be my comfort:   
- And I remayne, dispearyng of the port.   
    
## Avisyng the bright beames

  Of douteous loue.   

  - Avisyng the bright beames of those fayre eyes,   
- Where he abides that mine oft moistes and washeth:   
- The weried mynd streight from the hart departeth,   
- To rest within hys worldly Paradise,       
- And bitter findes the swete, vnder this gyse.   
- What webbes there he hath wrought, well he perceaueth   
- Wherby then with him self on loue he playneth,   
- That spurs wyth fire, and brydleth eke with yse.   
- In such extremity thus is he brought:   
- Frosen now cold, and now he standes in flame:   
- Twixt wo, and welth: betwixt earnest, and game:   
- With seldome glad, and many a diuers thought:   
- In sore repentance of hys hardinesse.   
- Of such a roote lo cometh frute frutelesse.   
    
## They flee from me

  The louer sheweth how he is forsaken of such as he somtime enioyed.   

  - They flee from me, that somtime did me seke   
- With naked fote stalkyng within my chamber.   
- Once haue I seen them gentle, tame, and meke,   
- That now are wild, and do not once remember   
- That sometyme they haue put them selues in danger,   
- To take bread at my hand, and now they range,   
- Busily sekyng in continuall change.   
-   Thanked be fortune, it hath bene otherwise   
- Twenty tymes better: but once especiall,   
- In thinne aray, after a pleasant gyse,   
- When her loose gowne did from her shoulders fall,   
- And she me caught in her armes long and small,   
- And therwithall, so swetely did me kysse,   
- And softly sayd: deare hart, how like you this?   
-   It was no dreame: for I lay broade awakyng.   
- But all is turnde now through my gentlenesse.   
- Into a bitter fashion of forsakyng:   
- And I haue leaue to go of her goodnesse,   
- And she also to vse newfanglenesse.   
- But, sins that I vnkyndly so am serued:   
- How like you this, what hath she now deserued?   
    
## Madame, withouten many wordes

  To a ladie to answere directly with yea or nay.       

  - Madame, withouten many wordes:   
- Once I am sure, you will, or no.   
- And if you will: then leaue your boordes,   
- And vse your wit, and shew it so:   
- For with a beck you shall me call.   
- And if of one, that burns alway,   
- Ye haue pity or ruth at all:   
- Answer hym fayer with yea, or nay.   
- If it be yea: I shall be faine.   
- Yf it be nay: frendes, as before.   
- You shall another man obtayn:   
- And I mine owne, and yours nomore.[^]: no more

  
    
## Alas, Madame

  To his loue whom he had kissed against her will.   

  - Alas, Madame, for stealing of a kisse,   
- Haue I so much your mynde therin offended?   
- Or haue I done so greuously amisse:   
- That by no meanes, it may not be amended?   
- Reuenge you then, the rediest way is this:   
- Another kisse my life it shall haue ended.   
- For, to my mouth the first my hart did suck:   
- The next shall clene out of my brest it pluck.   
    
## The wandring gadling

  Of the Ielous man that loued the same woman and espied   this other sitting with her.   

  - The wandring gadling, in the sommer tyde,   
- That findes the Adder with his rechlesse foote   
- Startes not dismaid so sodeinly aside,   
- As iealous despite did, though there were no boote,   
- When that he saw me sitting by her syde,   
- That of my health is very crop, and roote.       
- It pleased me then to haue so fayre a grace,   
- To styng the hart, that would haue had my place.   
    
## What nedes these threatnyng woordes

  To his loue from whom he hadd her gloues.   

  - What nedes these threatnyng woordes, and wasted wynd?   
- All this can not make me restore my pray,   
- To robbe your good ywis is not my minde:   
- Nor causelesse your faire hand did I display.   
- Let loue be iudge: or els whom next we finde:   
- That may both hear, what you and I can say.   
- She reft my hart: and I a gloue from her:   
- Let vs se then if one be worth the other.   
    
## Right true it is

  Of the fained frend.   

  - Right true it is, and sayd full yore ago:   
- Take hede of him, that by the backe thee claweth.   
- For, none is worse, then is a frendly fo.   
- Thought he seme good, all thing that thee deliteth,   
- Yet know it well, that in thy bosome crepeth.   
- For, many a man such fire oft times he kindleth:   
- That with the blase his berd him self he singeth.   
    
## It may be good

  The louer taught, mistrusteth allurementes.   

  - It may be good like it who list:   
- But I do dout, who can me blame?   
- For oft assured, yet haue I mist:   
- And now againe I fear the same.   
- The wordes, that from your mouth last came,   
- Of sodayn change make me agast.   
- For dread to fall, I stand not fast.   
-   Alas I tread an endlesse mase:   
- That seke taccord two contraries:   
- And hope thus styll, and nothing hase:       
- Imprisoned in liberties,   
- As one vnheard, and styll that cryes:   
- Alwayes thirsty, and naught doth taste,   
- For dreade to fall, I stand not fast.   
-   Assured I dout I be not sure,   
- Should I then trust vnto such suretie?   
- That oft haue put the proufe in vre,   
- And neuer yet haue found it trustie?   
- Nay syr in fayth, it were great folly.   
- And yet my life thus do I waste,   
- For dreade to fall I stand not fast.   
    
## Resownde my voyce ye woodes

  The louer complayneth that his loue doth not pitie him.   

  -  Resownde my voyce ye woodes, that heare me plaine:   
-  Both hilles and vales causyng reflexion   
-  And riuers eke, record ye of my paine:   
-  Which haue oft forced ye by compassion,   
-  As iudges lo to heare my exclamacion.   
-  Amonge whom, such (I finde) yet doth remaine.   
-  Where I it seke, alas, there is disdaine.   
-  Oft ye riuers, to hear my wofull sounde,   
-  Haue stopt your cours, and plainely to expresse,   
- Many a teare by moisture of the grounde   
- The earth hath wept to hear my heauinesse:   
- Which causelesse I endure without redresse.   
- The hugy okes haue rored in the winde,   
- Ech thing me thought complayning in their kinde.   
-   Why then alas doth not she on me rew,   
- Or is her hart so hard that no pitie   
- May in it sinke, my ioye for to renew?   
- O stony hart who hath thus framed thee   
- So cruell? that art cloked with beauty,   
- That from thee may no grace to me procede,   
- But as reward death for to be my mede.   
    
## In fayth I wot not what to say

  The louer reioyseth against fortune that by hindering his sute had   happily made him forsake his folly.       

  - In fayth I wot not what to say,   
- Thy chaunces ben so wonderous,   
- Thou fortune with thy diuers play   
- That makst the ioyfull dolourous,   
- And eke the same right ioyous.   
- Yet though thy chayne hath me enwrapt,   
- Spite of thy hap, hap hath well hapt.   
-   Though thou hast set me for a wonder,   
- And sekest by change to do me payne:   
- Mens mindes yet mayst thou not so order,   
- For honestie if it remayne,   
- Shall shine for all thy cloudy rayne.   
- In vayne thou sekest to haue me trapt,   
- Spite of thy hap, hap hath well hapt.   
-   In hindryng me, me didst thou further,   
- And made a gap where was a style.   
- Cruell willes ben oft put vnder,   
- Wenyng to lower, then didst thou smile.   
- Lord, how thy selfe thou didst begyle,   
- That in thy cares wouldst me haue wrapt?   
- But spite of thy hap, hap hath well hapt.   
    
## Farewell the hart of crueltie

  A renouncing of hardly escaped loue.   

  -  Farewell the hart of crueltie.   
-  Though that with payne my libertie   
-  Deare haue I bought, and wofully   
-  Finisht my fearfull tragedy.   
-  Of force I must forsake such pleasure:   
-  A good cause iust, sins I endure   
-  Therby my wo, whiche be ye sure,   
-  Shall therwith go me to recure.   
-  I fare as one escapt that fleeth,   
- Glad he is gone, and yet styll feareth   
- Spied to be caught, and so dredeth   
- That he for nought his paine leseth.   
- In ioyfull payne reioyce my hart,   
- Thus to sustaine of ech a part.       
- Let not this song from thee astart.   
- Welcome among my pleasant smart.   
    
## The restfull place

  The louer to his bed, with describing of his vnquiet state.   

  - The restfull place, renewer of my smart:   
- The labours salue, encreasyng my sorow:   
- The bodyes ease, and troubler of my hart:   
- Quieter of minde, myne vnquiet fo:   
- Forgetter of payne, remembrer of my wo:   
- The place of slepe, wherin I do but wake:   
- Besprent with teares, my bed, I thee forsake.   
-   The frosty snowes may not redresse my heat:   
- Nor heat of sunne abate my feruent cold.   
- I know nothing to ease my paynes so great.   
- Ech cure causeth encrease by twenty fold,   
- Renewyng cares vpon my sorowes old.   
- Such ouerthwart effectes in me they make.   
- Besprent with teares my bedde for to forsake.   
-   But all for nought: I finde no better ease   
- In bed, or out. This most causeth my paine:   
- Where I do seke how best that I may please,   
- My lost labour (alas) is all in vaine.   
- My hart once set, I can not it refrayne.   
- No place from me my grief away can take.   
- Wherfore with teares, my bed, I thee forsake.   
    
## From these hie hilles

  Comparison of loue to a streame falling from the Alpes.   

  - From these hie hilles as when a spring doth fall,   
- It trilleth downe with still and suttle course,   
- Of this and that it gathers ay and shall,   
- Till it haue iust downflowed to streame and force:   
- Then at the fote it rageth ouer all.   
- So fareth loue, when he hath tane a sourse.   
- Rage is his raine. Resistance vayleth none.   
- The first eschue is remedy alone.       
    
## Myne olde dere enmy

  wiates complaint vpon Loue, to Reason: with Loues answer.   

  - Myne olde dere enmy, my froward maister,   
- Afore that Quene, I causde to be accited,   
- Which holdeth the diuine part of our nature,   
- That, like as golde, in fire he mought be tryed.   
- Charged with dolour, there I me presented   
- With horrible feare, as one that greatly dredeth   
- A wrongfull death, and iustice alway seketh.   
-   And thus I sayd: once my left foote, Madame,   
- When I was yong, I set within his reigne:   
- Wherby other than fierly burning flame   
- I neuer felt, but many a greuous pain.   
- Torment I suffred, angre, and disdain:   
- That mine oppressed pacience was past,   
- And I mine owne life hated, at the last.   
-   Thus hitherto haue I my time passed   
- In pain and smart. What wayes profitable:   
- How many pleasant dayes haue me escaped,   
- In seruing this false lyer so deceauable?   
- What wit haue wordes so prest, and forceable,   
- That may conteyn my great mishappinesse,   
- And iust complaintes of his vngentlenesse?   
-   So small hony, much aloes, and gall,   
- In bitternesse, my blinde life hath ytasted.   
- His false semblance, that turneth as a ball:   
- With fair and amorous daunce, made me be traced,   
- And, where I had my thought, and mynde araced,   
- From earthly frailnesse, and from vayn pleasure,   
- Me from my rest he toke, and set in errour:   
-   God made he me regard lesse, than I ought,   
- And to my self to take right litle hede:   
- And for a woman haue I set at nought   
- All other thoughtes: in this onely to spede.   
- And he was onely counseler of this dede:   
- Whettyng alwayes my youthly frayle desire   
- On cruell whetston, tempered with fire.   
-   But (Oh alas) where, had I euer wit?       
- Or other gift, geuen to me of nature?   
- That sooner shalbe changed my weried sprite:   
- Then the obstinate wyll, that is my ruler.   
- So robbeth he my fredom with displeasure,   
- This wicked traytour, whom I thus accuse:   
- That bitter life hath turned in pleasant vse.   
-   He hath me hasted, thorough diuers regions:   
- Through desert wodes, and sharp hye mountaines:   
- Through froward people, and through bitter passions:   
- Through rocky seas, and ouer hilles and plaines:   
- With wery trauell, and with laborous paynes:   
- Alwayes in trouble and in tediousnesse:   
- All in errour, and dangerous distresse,   
-   But nother he, nor she, my tother fo,   
- For all my flight, dyd euer me forsake:   
- That though my timely death hath been to slow   
- That me as yet, it hath not ouertake:   
- The heauenly goddes of pity doe it slake.   
- And, note they this his cruell tiranny,   
- That fedes him, with my care, and misery.   
-   Since I was his, hower rested I neuer,   
- Nor loke to do: and eke the waky nightes   
- The banished slepe may in no wise recouer.   
- By guile, and force, ouer my thralled sprites,   
- He is ruler: since which bel neuer strikes,   
- That I heare not as sounding to renue   
- My plaintes. Himself, he knoweth, that I say true.   
-   For, neuer wormes olde rotten stocke haue eaten:   
- As he my hart, where he is resident,   
- And doth thesame[^]: the same

 with death dayly threaten.   
- Thence come the teares, and thence the bitter torment:   
- The sighes: the wordes, and eke the languishment:   
- That noy both me, and parauenture other.   
- Iudge thou: that knowest the one, and eke the tother.   
-   Mine aduersair, with such greuous reproofe,   
- Thus he began. Heare Lady, thother part:   
- That the plain troth, from which he draweth aloofe,   
- This vnkinde man may shew, ere that I part.   
- In his yong age, I toke him from that art,   
- That selleth wordes, and makes a clatteryng Knight:   
- And of my wealth I gaue him the delight.   
-   Now shames he not on me for to complain,       
- That held him euermore in pleasant gain,   
- From his desyre, that might haue been his payn.   
- Yet therby alone I brought him to some frame:   
- Which now, as wretchednes, he doth so blame:   
- And towarde honor quickned I his wit:   
- Where:as a daskard els he mought haue sit.   
-   He knoweth, how grete Atride that made Troy freat,   
- And Hanniball, to Rome so troubelous:   
- Whom Homer honored, Achilles that great,   
- And Thaffricane Scipion the famous:   
- And many other, by much nurture glorious:   
- Whose fame, and honor did bring them aboue:   
- I did let fall in base dishonest loue.   
-   And vnto him, though he vnworthy were:   
- I chose the best of many a Milion:   
- That, vnder sonne yet neuer was her pere,   
- Of wisdom, womanhod, and of discrecion:   
- And of my grace I gaue her such a facion,   
- And eke such way I taught her for to teache,   
- That neuer base thought his hart so hye might reche,   
-   Euermore thus to content his maistresse,   
- That was his onely frame of honesty,   
- I stirred him still, toward gentlenesse:   
- And causde him to regard fidelity.   
- Pacience I taught him in aduersity.   
- Such vertues learned, he in my great schole:   
- Wherof repenteth, now the ignorant foole.   
-   These, were the same deceites, and bitter gall,   
- That I haue vsed, the torment, and the anger:   
- Sweter, then euer dyd to other fall,   
- Of right good sede yll frute loe thus I gather.   
- And so shall he, that the vnkinde dothe further.   
- A Serpent nourish I vnder my wing:   
- And now of nature, ginneth he to styng.   
-   And for to tell, at last, my great seruise.   
- From thousand dishonesties haue I him drawen:   
- That, by my meanes, him in no maner wyse.   
- Neuer vile pleasure once hath ouerthrowen.   
- Where, in his dede, shame hath him alwaies gnawen:   
- Doutyng report, that should come to her eare:   
- Whom now he blames, her wonted he to feare.   
-   What euer he hath of any honest custome:       
- Of her, and me: that holdes he euerywhit,   
- But, lo, yet neuer was there nightly fantome   
- So farre in errour, as he is from his wit.   
- To plain on vs, he striueth with the bit,   
- Which may rule him, and do him ease, and pain:   
- And in one hower, make all his grief his gayn.   
-   But, one thing yet there is, aboue all other:   
- I gaue him winges, wherwith he might vpflie   
- To honor, and fame: and if he would to higher   
- Than mortall thinges, aboue the starry skie:   
- Considering the pleasure, that an eye   
- Might geue in earth, by reason of the loue:   
- What should that be that lasteth still aboue?   
-   And he the same himself hath sayd, ere this.   
- But, now, forgotten is both that and I,   
- That gaue her him, his onely wealth and blisse.   
- And, at this word, with dedly shreke and cry:   
- Thou gaue her once: quod I, but by and by,   
- Thou toke her ayen from me: that wo worth the.   
- Not I but price: more worth than thou (quod he.)   
-   At last: eche other for himself, concluded:   
- I, trembling still: but he, with small reuerence.   
- Lo, thus, as we eche other haue accused:   
- Dere Lady: now we waite thyne onely sentence.   
- She smiling, at the whisted audience:   
- It liketh me (quod she) to haue hard your question:   
- But, lenger time doth ask a resolucion.   
    
## Maruell no more altho

  - Maruell nomore[^]: no more

 altho   
- The songes, I sing do mone:   
- For other lyfe then wo,   
- I neuer proued none.   
-   And in my hart, also,   
- Is grauen with letters depe   
- A thousand sighes and mo:   
- A flood of teares to wepe.       
-   How may a man in smart   
- Finde matter to reioyce?   
- How may a moornyng hart   
- Set foorth a pleasant voice.   
-   Play who so can, that part:   
- Nedes must in me appere:   
- How fortune ouerthwart   
- Doth cause my moorning chere.   
-   Perdy there is no man,   
- If he saw neuer sight:   
- That perfitly tell can   
- The nature of the light.   
-   Alas: how should I than,   
- That neuer taste but sowre:   
- But do, as I began,   
- Continually to lowre.   
-   But yet, perchance some chance   
- May chance to change my tune:   
- And, when (Souch) chance doth chance:   
- Then, shall I thank fortune?   
-   And if I haue (Souch) chance:   
- Perchance ere it be long:   
- For (Souch) a pleasant chance,   
- To sing some pleasant song.   
    
## Where shall I haue

  The louer complaineth himself forsaken.   

  - Where shall I haue, at myne owne wyll,   
- Teares to complain? Where shall I fet   
- Such sighes? that I may sigh my fyll:   
- And then agayne my plaintes repete.   
- For, though my plaint shall haue none end:   
- My teares cannot suffise my wo.   
- To mone my harm, haue I no frend.   
- For fortunes frend is mishaps fo.   
- Comfort (God wot) els haue I none:   
- But in the winde to wast my wordes,   
- Nought moueth you my dedly mone:   
- But stil you turne it into bordes.       
- I speake not, now, to moue your hart,   
- That you should rue vpon my payn:   
- The sentence geuen may not reuert:   
- I know, such labour were but vayn.   
- But since that I for you (my dere)   
- Haue lost that thyng, that was my best:   
- A right small losse it must appere,   
- To lese these wordes, and all the rest.   
- But, though they sparcle in the winde:   
- Yet, shall they shew your falsed faith:   
- Which is returned to his kynde:   
- For lyke to like: the prouerb sayeth,   
- Fortune, and you did me auance.   
- Me thought, I swam, and could not drowne:   
- Happiest of all, but my mischance   
- Did lift me vp, to throw me downe.   
- And you, with her, of cruelnesse,   
- Dyd set your foote vpon my neck,   
- Me, and my welfare to oppresse:   
- Without offence, your hart to wreck,   
- Where are your pleasant wordes? alas:   
- Where is your faith? your stedfastnesse?   
- There is no more: but all doth passe:   
- And I am left all comfortlesse.   
- But since so much it doth you greue,   
- And also me my wretched life:   
- Haue here my troth: Nought shall releue,   
- But death alone my wretched strife.   
- Therfore, farewell my life, my death,   
- My gayn, my losse: my salue, my sore:   
- Farewell also, with you my breath:   
- For, I am gone for euermore.

- Had prickt my hart, for to encrease my sore.

- Broken she hath: and yet, she bydeth sure,   
- Right at her ease, and litle thee she dredeth.   
- Weaponed thou art, and she vnarmed sitteth:

- That meanes no gyle, and faithfull doth remayn   
- Within the trap, without help or redresse.   
- But for to loue (lo) such a sterne maistresse,   
- Where cruelty dwelles, alas it were in vain.   
    
## Somtime I fled the fire

  The louer that fled loue now folowes it with his harme.   

  - Somtime I fled the fire, that me so brent,   
- By sea, by land, by water, and by wynde:   
- And now, the coales I folow, that be quent,   
- From Douer to Calais, with willing minde,   
- Lo, how desire is both furth sprong, and spent:   
- And he may see, that whilom was so blinde:   
- And all his labour, laughes he now to scorne,   
- Meashed in the breers, that erst was onely torne.   
    
## He is not dead

  The louer hopeth of better chance.   

  - He is not dead, that somtime had a fall.   
- The Sonne returnes, that hid was vnder clowd.   
- And when Fortune hath spit out all her gall,   
- I trust, good luck to me shall be alowd.   
- For, I haue seen a ship in hauen fall,   
- After that storme hath broke both maste, and shroude.   
- The willowe eke, that stoupeth with the winde,   
- Doth rise againe, and greater wood doth binde.       
    
## The furious goonne

  The louer compareth his hart to the ouercharged gonne.   

  - The furious goonne, in his most ragyng yre,   
- When that the boule is rammed in to sore:   
- And that the flame cannot part from the fire,   
- Crackes in sunder: and in the ayer doe rore   
- The sheuered peces. So doth my desyre,   
- Whose flame encreaseth ay from more to more.   
- Which to let out, I dare not loke, nor speake:   
- So inward force my hart doth all to breake.   
    
## Accused though I be

  The louer suspected of change praieth that it be not beleued against him.   

  - Accused though I be, without desert:   
- Sith none can proue, beleue it not for true.   
- For neuer yet, since that you had my hert,   
- Intended I to false, or be vntrue.   
- Sooner I would of death sustayn the smart,   
- Than breake one word of that I promised you.   
- Accept therfore my seruice in good part.   
- None is alyue, that can yll tonges eschew.   
- Hold them as false: and let not vs depart   
- Our frendship olde, in hope of any new.   
- Put not thy trust in such as vse to fayn,   
- Except thou mynde to put thy frend to payn.   
    
## My loue to skorne

  The louer abused renownseth loue.   

  - My loue to skorne, my seruice to retayne,   
- Therin (me thought) you vsed crueltie.       
- Since with good will I lost my libertie,   
- Might neuer wo yet cause me to refrain,   
- But onely this, which is extremitie,   
- To geue me nought (alas) nor to agree,   
- That as I was, your man I might remain.   
- But synce that thus ye list to order me,   
- That would haue bene your seruant true, and fast:   
- Displease you not: my doting time is past.   
- And with my losse to leaue I must agree.   
- For as there is a certayn time to rage:   
- So is there time such madnes to aswage.   
    
## Within my brest

  The louer professeth himself constant.   

  - Within my brest I neuer thought it gain,   
- Of gentle mynde the fredom for to lose.   
- Nor in my hart sanck neuer such disdain,   
- To be a forger, faultes for to disclose.   
- Nor I can not endure the truth to glose,   
- To set a glosse vpon an earnest pain.   
- Nor I am not in nomber one of those,   
- That list to blow retrete to euery train.   
    
## Passe forth my wonted cryes

  The louer sendeth his complaintes and teares to sue for grace.   

  - Passe forth my wonted cryes,   
- Those cruell eares to pearce,   
- Which in most hatefull wyse   
- Doe styll my plaintes reuerse.   
- Doe you, my teares, also   
- So wet her barrein hart:   
- That pitye there may grow,   
- And crueltie depart.   
-   For though hard rockes among       
- She semes to haue bene bred:   
- And of the Tigre long   
- Bene nourished, and fed.   
- Yet shall that nature change,   
- If pitie once win place.   
- Whom as vnknowen, and strange,   
- She now away doth chase.   
-   And as the water soft,   
- Without forcyng or strength,   
- Where that it falleth oft,   
- Hard stones doth perse at length:   
- So in her stony hart   
- My plaintes at last shall graue,   
- And, rygour set apart,   
- Winne grant of that I craue.   
-   Wherfore my plaintes, present   
- Styll so to her my sute,   
- As ye, through her assent,   
- May bring to me some frute.   
- And as she shall me proue,   
- So bid her me regarde,   
- And render loue for loue:   
- Which is a iust reward.   
    
## Your lokes so often cast

  The louers case can not be hidden how euer he dissemble.   

  - Your lokes so often cast,   
- Your eyes so frendly rolde,   
- Your sight fixed so fast,   
- Alwayes one to behold.   
- Though hyde it fayn ye would:   
- It plainly doth declare,   
- Who hath your hart in hold,   
- And where good will ye bare,   
-   Fayn would ye finde a cloke   
- Your brennyng fire to hyde:   
- Yet both the flame, and smoke   
- Breakes out on euery syde.       
- Yee can not loue so guide,   
- That it no issue winne.   
- Abrode nedes must it glide,   
- That brens so hote within.   
-   For cause your self do wink,   
- Ye iudge all other blinde:   
- And secret it you think,   
- Which euery man doth finde.   
- In wast oft spend ye winde   
- Your self in loue to quit:   
- For agues of that kinde   
- Will show, who hath the fit.   
-   Your sighes yow fet from farre,   
- And all to wry your wo:   
- Yet are ye nere the narre,   
- Men ar not blinded so.   
- Depely oft swere ye no:   
- But all those othes ar vaine.   
- So well your eye doth showe,   
- Who puttes your hert to paine.   
-   Thinke not therfore to hide,   
- That still it selfe betrayes:   
- Nor seke meanes to prouide   
- To darke the sunny daies.   
- Forget those wonted waies:   
- Leaue of such frowning chere:   
- There will be found no stayes   
- To stoppe a thing so clere.   
    
## Disdaine me not without desert

  The louer praieth not to be disdained, refused, mistrusted, nor forsaken.   

  - Disdaine me not without desert:   
- Nor leaue me not so sodenly:   
- Sins well ye wot, that in my hert   
- I meane ye not but honestly.   
-   Refuse me not without cause why:   
- Nor think me not to be vniust:       
- Sins that by lotte of fantasy,   
- This carefull knot neades knit I must.   
-   Mistrust me not, though some there be,   
- That faine would spot my stedfastnesse:   
- Beleue them not, sins that ye se,   
- The profe is not, as they expresse.   
-   Forsake me not, till I deserue:   
- Nor hate me not, tyll I offend.   
- Destroy me not, tyll that I swerue.   
- But sins ye know what I intend:   
-   Disdaine me not that am your owne:   
- Refuse me not that am so true:   
- Mistrust me not till all be knowne:   
- Forsake me not, ne for no new.   
    
## For want of will

  The louer lamenteth his estate with sute for grace.   

  - For want of will, in wo I playne:   
- Vnder colour of sobernesse.   
- Renewyng with my sute my payne,   
- My wanhope with your stedfastnesse.   
- Awake therfore of gentlenesse.   
- Regard at length, I you require,   
- The sweltyng paynes of my desire.   
-   Betimes who geueth willingly,   
- Redoubled thankes aye doth deserue.   
- And I that sue vnfaynedly,   
- In frutelesse hope (alas) do sterue.   
- How great my cause is for to swerue:   
- And yet how stedfast is my sute:   
- Lo, here ye see, where is the frute?   
-   As hounde that hath his keper lost,   
- Seke I your presence to obtayne:   
- In which my hart deliteth most,   
- And shall delight though I be slayne.   
- You may release my band of payne.   
- Lose then the care that makes me crye,   
- For want of helpe or els I dye.       
-   I dye, though not incontinent,   
- By processe yet consumingly   
- As waste of fire, which doth relent.   
- If you as wilfull wyll denye.   
- Wherfore cease of such crueltye:   
- And take me wholy in your grace:   
- Which lacketh will to change his place.   
    
## If euer man might him auaunt

  The louer waileth his changed ioyes.   

  - If euer man might him auaunt   
- Of fortunes frendly chere:   
- It was my selfe I must it graunt,   
- For I haue bought it dere.   
- And derely haue I helde also   
- The glory of her name:   
- In yelding her such tribute, lo,   
- As did set forth her fame.   
-   Sometyme I stode so in her grace:   
- That as I would require,   
- Ech ioy I thought did me imbrace,   
- That furdered my desire.   
- And all those pleasures (lo) had I,   
- That fansy might support:   
- And nothing she did me denye,   
- That was to my comfort.   
-   I had (what would you more perdee?)   
- Ech grace that I did craue.   
- Thus fortunes will was vnto me   
- All thing that I would haue.   
- But all to rathe alas the while,   
- She built on such a ground:   
- In little space, to great a guyle   
- In her now haue I found.   
-   For she hath turned so her whele:   
- That I vnhappy man   
- May waile the time that I did fele   
- Wherwith she fedde me than.   
- For broken now are her behestes:   
- And pleasant lokes she gaue:       
- And therfore now all my requestes,   
- From perill can not saue.   
-   Yet would I well it might appere   
- To her my chiefe regard:   
- Though my desertes haue ben to dere   
- To merite such reward.   
- Sith fortunes will is now so bent   
- To plage me thus pore man:   
- I must my selfe therwith content:   
- And beare it as I can.   
    
## Some men would thinke of right

  The louer lamenteth other to haue the frutes of his seruice.   

  - Some men would thinke of right to haue   
- For their true meaning some reward.   
- But while that I do crye and craue:   
- I se that other be preferd.   
- I gape for that I am debard.   
- I fare as doth the hounde at hatch:   
- The worse I spede, the lenger I watch.   
-   My wastefull will is tried by trust:   
- My fond fansie is mine abuse.   
- For that I would refrayne my lust:   
- For mine auayle I can not chuse,   
- A will, and yet no power to vse.   
- A will, no will by reason iust,   
- Sins my will is at others lust.   
-   They eat the hony, I hold the hyue.   
- I sowe the sede, they reape the corne.   
- I waste, they winne, I draw, they driue.   
- Theirs is the thanke, mine is the skorne.   
- I seke, they spede, in waste my winde is worne.   
- I gape, they get, and gredely I snatch:   
- Till wurse I spede, the lenger I watch.   
-   I fast, they fede: they drynke, I thurst.   
- They laugh, I wayle: they ioye, I mourne.   
- They gayne, I lose: I haue the worst.   
- They whole, I sicke: they cold, I burne.       
- They leape, I lye: they slepe, I tosse and turne,   
- I would, they may: I craue, they haue at will.   
- That helpeth them, lo, cruelty doth me kyll.   
    
## The answere that ye made

  To his loue that had geuen him answere of refusell.   

  - The answere that ye made to me my deare,   
- When I did sue for my pore hartes redresse:   
- Hath so appalde my countenance and my chere:   
- That in this case, I am all comfortlesse:   
- Sins I of blame no cause can well expresse.   
-   I haue no wrong, where I can clayme no right.   
- Nought tane me fro, where I haue nothing had.   
- Yet of my wo, I can not so be quite.   
- Namely, sins that another may be glad   
- With that, that thus in sorow makes me sad.   
-   Yet none can claime (I saie) by former graunt,   
- That knoweth not of any graunt at all.   
- And by desert, I dare well make auaunt,   
- Of faithfull will, there is no where that shall   
- Bear you more trouth, more ready at your call.   
-   Now good then, call againe that bitter word:   
- That toucht your frende so nere with panges of paine:   
- And saie my dere that it was sayd in bord.   
- Late, or tosone,[^]: to sone

 let it not rule the gaine,   
- Wherwith free will doth true desert retayne.   
    
## Svch is the course

  To his ladie cruel ouer her yelden louer.   

  - Svch is the course, that natures kinde hath wrought,   
- That snakes haue time to cast away their stynges.   
- Ainst chainde prisoners what nede defence be sought:   
- The fierce lyon will hurt no yelden thinges:   
- Why shoulde such spite be nursed then in thy thought?   
- Sith all these powers are prest vnder thy winges:       
- And eke thou seest, and reason thee hath taught:   
- What mischief malice many waies it bringes.   
- Consider eke, that spight auaileth naught,   
- Therfore this song thy fault to thee it singes:   
- Displease thee not, for saiyng thus (me thought.)   
- Nor hate thou him from whom no hate forth springes,   
- Nor furies, that in hell be execrable,   
- For that they hate, are made most miserable.   
    
## The enmy of life

  The louer complaineth that deadlie sicknesse can not helpe his affeccion.   

  - The enmy of life, decayer of all kinde,   
- That with his cold wythers away the grene:   
- This other night, me in my bed did finde:   
- And offerd me to ryd my feuer clene.   
- And I did graunt: so did dispayre me blinde.   
- He drew his bow, with arrowes sharpe and kene:   
- And strake the place, where loue had hit before:   
- And draue the first dart deper more and more.   
    
## Once as me thought

  The louer reioiceth the enioying of his loue.   

  - Once as me thought, fortune me kist:   
- And bade me aske, what I thought best:   
- And I should haue it as me list,   
- Therewith to set my hart in rest.   
-   I asked but my ladies hart   
- To haue for euermore myne owne:   
- Then at an end were all my smart:   
- Then should I nede no more to mone.   
-   Yet for all that a stormy blast   
- Had ouerturnde this goodly day:   
- And fortune semed at the last,   
- That to her promise she said nay.   
-   But like as one out of dispayre   
- To sodain hope reuiued I.       
- Now fortune sheweth her selfe so fayre,   
- That I content me wondersly.   
-   My most desire my hand may reach:   
- My will is alway at my hand.   
- Me nede not long for to beseche   
- Her, that hath power me to commaunde.   
-   What earthly thing more can I craue?   
- What would I wishe more at my will?   
- Nothing on earth more would I haue,   
- Saue that I haue, to haue it styll.   
-   For fortune hath kept her promesse,   
- In grauntyng me my most desire.   
- Of my soueraigne I haue redresse,   
- And I content me with my hire.   
    
## My lute awake

  The louer complayneth the vnkindnes of his loue.   

  - My lute awake performe the last   
- Labour that thou and I shall waste:   
- And end that I haue now begonne:   
- And when this song is song and past:   
- My lute be styll for I haue done.   
-   As to be heard where eare is none:   
- As lead to graue in marble stone:   
- My song may pearse her hart as sone.   
- Should we then sigh? or singe, or mone?   
- No, no, my lute for I haue done.   
-   The rockes do not so cruelly   
- Repulse the waues continually,   
- As she my sute and affection:   
- So that I am past remedy,   
- Wherby my lute and I haue done.   
-   Proude of the spoile that thou hast gotte   
- Of simple hartes through loues shot:   
- By whom vnkinde thou hast them wonne,   
- Thinke not he hath his bow forgot,   
- Although my lute and I haue done.   
-   Vengeaunce shall fall on thy disdaine   
- That makest but game on earnest payne.       
- Thinke not alone vnder the sunne   
- Vnquit to cause thy louers plaine:   
- Although my lute and I haue done.   
-   May chance thee lie witherd and olde,   
- In winter nightes that are so colde,   
- Playning in vaine vnto the mone:   
- Thy wishes then dare not be tolde.   
- Care then who list, for I haue done.   
-   And then may chance thee to repent   
- The time that thou hast lost and spent   
- To cause thy louers sigh and swowne.   
- Then shalt thou know beauty but lent,   
- And wish and want as I haue done.   
-   Now cease my lute this is the last,   
- Labour that thou and I shall wast,   
- And ended is that we begonne.   
- Now is this song both song and past,   
- My lute be still for I haue done.   
    
## Nature that gaue the Bee

  How by a kisse he found both his life and death.   

  - Nature that gaue the Bee so feat a grace,   
- To finde hony of so wondrous fashion:   
- Hath taught the spider out of the same place   
- To fetch poyson by strange alteracion.   
- Though this be strange, it is a stranger case,   
- With one kisse by secrete operacion,   
- Both these at once in those your lippes to finde,   
- In change wherof, I leaue my hart behinde.   
    
## Vnwarely so was neuer

  The louer describeth his being taken with sight of his loue.   

  - Vnwarely so was neuer no man caught,   
- With stedfast loke vpon a goodly face:   
- As I of late: for sodainely me thought,   
- My hart was torne out of his proper place.   
-   Thorow mine eye the stroke from hers did slide,   
- Directly downe into my hart it ranne:       
- In helpe wherof the blood therto did glide,   
- And left my face both pale and wanne.   
-   Then was I like a man for wo amased:   
- Or like the fowle that fleeth into the fire.   
- For while that I vpon her beauty gased:   
- The more I burnde in my desire.   
-   Anone the bloud start in my face agayne,   
- Inflamde with heat, that it had at my hart.   
- And brought therwith through out in euery vaine,   
- A quakyng heat with pleasant smart.   
-   Then was I like the straw, when that the flame   
- Is driuen therin, by force, and rage of winde.   
- I can not tell, alas, what I shall blame:   
- Nor what to seke, nor what to finde.   
-   But well I wot: the griefe doth hold me sore   
- In heat and cold, betwixt both hope and dreade:   
- That, but her helpe to health do me restore:   
- This restlesse life I may not lead.   
    
## Al in thy loke my life

  To his louer to loke vpon him.   

  - Al in thy loke my life doth whole depende.   
- Thou hydest thy self, and I must dye therfore.   
- But sins thou mayst so easily helpe thy frend:   
- Why doest thou stick to salue that thou madest sore?   
- Why do I dye? sins thou mayst me defend?   
- And if I dye, thy life may last no more.   
- For ech by other doth liue and haue reliefe,   
- I in thy loke, and thou most in my griefe.   
    
## Perdy I sayd it not

  The louer excuseth him of wordes wherwith he was vniustly charged.   

  - Perdy I sayd it not:   
- Nor neuer thought to do.       
- As well as I ye wot:   
- I haue no power therto,   
- And if I did, the lot,   
- That first did me enchayne:   
- May neuer slake the knot,   
- But strayght it to my payne.   
-   And if I did ech thing,   
- That may do harme or wo:   
- Continually may wring   
- My hart where so I go.   
- Report may alwayes ring   
- Of shame on me for aye:   
- If in my hart did spring   
- The wordes that you do say   
-   And if I did ech starre,   
- That is in heauen aboue,   
- May frowne on me to marre   
- The hope I haue in loue.   
- And if I did such warre,   
- As they brought vnto Troye,   
- Bring all my life as farre   
- From all his lust and ioye.   
-   And if I did so say:   
- The beautie that me bounde,   
- Encrease from day to day   
- More cruell to my wounde:   
- With all the mone that may,   
- To plaint may turne my song:   
- My life may sone decay,   
- Without redresse by wrong.   
-   If I be cleare from thought,   
- Why do you then complayne?   
- Then is this thing but sought.   
- To turne my hart to payne,   
- Then this that you haue wrought,   
- You must it now redresse,   
- Of right therfore you ought   
- Such rigour to represse.   
-   And as I haue deserued:   
- So graunt me now my hire:   
- You know I neuer swerued,   
- You neuer founde me lyer.       
- For Rachel haue I serued,   
- For Lea cared I neuer:   
- And her I haue reserued   
- Within my hart for euer.   
    
## Lvx, my faire fawlcon

  Of such as had forsaken him.   

  - Lvx, my faire fawlcon, and thy felowes all:   
- How wel pleasant it were your libertie:   
- Ye not forsake me, that faire mought you fall.   
- But they that sometime liked my company:   
- Like lice away from dead bodies they crall.   
- Loe, what a proufe in light aduersitie?   
- But ye my birdes, I sweare by all your belles,   
- Ye be my frendes, and very few elles.   
    
## A face that should content

  A description of such a one as he would loue.   

  - A Face that should content me wonderous well,   
- Should not be faire, but louely to beholde:   
- Of liuely loke, all griefe for to repell:   
- With right good grace, so would I that it should   
- Speake without word, such wordes as none can tell.   
- The tresse also should be of crisped gold.   
- With wit, and these perchance I might be tryde,   
- And knit againe with knot, that should not slide.   
    
## Ever my hap is slack

  How vnpossible it is to finde quiet in his loue.   

  - Ever my hap is slack and slowe in commyng   
- Desire encreasyng ay my hope vncertaine:   
- That loue or wait it, alike doth me payne.   
- And Tygre like so swift it is in partyng.   
- Alas the snow black shal it be and scalding,   
- The sea waterles, and fishe vpon the mountaine:   
- The Temis shal backe returne into his fountaine:   
- And where he rose the sunne shall take his lodgyng.       
- Ere I in this finde peace or quietnesse.   
- Or that loue or my lady rightwisely   
- Leaue to conspire against me wrongfully.   
- And if I haue after such bitternesse,   
- Any thing swete, my mouth is out of taste:   
- That all my trust and trauell is but waste.   
    
## Loue, Fortune, and my minde

  Of Loue, Fortune, and the louers minde.   

  - Loue, Fortune, and my minde which do remember   
- Eke that is now, and that that once hath bene:   
- Torment my hart so sore that very often   
- I hate and enuy them beyonde all measure.   
- Loue sleeth my hart while Fortune is depriuer   
- Of all my comfort: the folishe minde than:   
- Burneth and playneth: as one that sildam   
- Liueth in rest. Still in dispeasure[^]: displeasure

  
- My pleasant daies they flete away and passe.   
- And dayly doth myne yll change to the worse.   
- While more then halfe is runne now of my course.   
- Alas not of stele, but of brittle glasse,   
- I se that from my hand falleth my trust:   
- And all my thoughtes are dasshed into dust.   
    
## How oft haue I

  The louer prayeth his offred hart to be receiued.   

  - How oft haue I, my deare and cruell fo:   
- With my great pain to get som peace or truce,   
- Geuen you my hart? but you do not vse,   
- In so hie thinges, to cast your minde so low.   
- If any other loke for it, as you trow,   
- Their vaine weake hope doth greatly them abuse.   
- And that thus I disdayne, that you refuse.   
- It was once mine, it can no more be so.   
- If you it chase, that it in you can finde,   
- In this exile, no maner of comfort:   
- Nor liue alone, nor where he is calde, resort,   
- He may wander from his naturall kinde.       
- So shall it be great hurt vnto vs twayne,   
- And yours the losse, and mine the deadly payne.   
    
## Lyke vnto these

  The louers life compared to the Alpes.   

  - Lyke vnto these vnmesurable mountaines,   
- So is my painefull life, the burden of yre.   
- For hye be they, and hye is my desire.   
- And I of teares, and they be full of fountaines.   
- Vnder craggy rockes they haue barren plaines,   
- Hard thoughtes in me my wofull minde doth tyre,   
- Small frute and many leaues their toppes do attire,   
- With small effect great trust in me remaines.   
- The boystous windes oft their hye boughes do blast:   
- Hote sighes in me continually be shed.   
- Wilde beastes in them, fierce loue in me is fed.   
- Vnmoueable am I: and they stedfast.   
- Of singing birdes they haue the tune and note:   
- And I alwaies plaintes passing through my throte.   
    
## If amourous fayth

  Charging of his loue as vnpiteous and louing other.   

  - If amourous fayth, or if an hart vnfained   
- A swete languor, a great louely desire:   
- If honest will, kindled in gentle fire:   
- If long errour in a blinde mase chained,   
- If in my visage ech thought distayned:   
- Or if my sparkelyng voyce, lower, or hier,   
- Which fear and shame, so wofully doth tyre:   
- If pale colour, which loue alas hath stayned:   
- If to haue another then my self more dere,   
- If wailyng or sighyng continually,   
- With sorowfull anger fedyng busily,   
- If burnyng a farre of, and fre syng[^]: fresyng

 nere,   
- Are cause that by loue my selfe I stroy:   
- Yours is the fault, and mine the great annoy.       
    
## Farewell, Loue

  A renouncing of loue.   

  - Farewell, Loue, and all thy lawes for euer.   
- Thy bayted hokes shall tangle me no more.   
- Senec, and Plato call me from thy lore:   
- To parfit wealth my wit for to endeuer.   
- In blinde errour when I dyd parseuer:   
- Thy sharp repulse, that pricketh aye so sore:   
- Taught me in trifles that I set no store:   
- But scape forth thence: since libertie is leuer.   
- Therfore, farewell: go trouble yonger hartes:   
- And in me claime no more auctoritie.   
- With ydle youth go vse thy propartie:   
- And theron spend thy many brittle dartes.   
- For, hytherto though I haue lost my tyme:   
- Me lyst no lenger rotten bowes to clime.   
    
## My hart I gaue thee

  The louer forsaketh his vnkinde loue,   

  - My hart I gaue thee, not to do it pain:   
- But, to preserue, lo it to thee was taken.   
- I serued thee not that I should be forsaken:   
- But, that I should receiue reward again,   
- I was content thy seruant to remain:   
- And, not to be repayd after this fashion.   
- Now, since in thee is there none nother reason:   
- Displease thee not, if that I do refrain.   
- Vnsaciat of my wo, and thy desyre.   
- Assured by craft for to excuse thy fault.   
- But, since it pleaseth thee to fain defaut:   
- Farewell, I say, departing from the fire.   
- For, he, that doth beleue bearyng in hand:   
- Ploweth in the water: and soweth in the sand.   
    
## The flaming sighes

  The louer describeth his restlesse state.       

  - The flaming sighes that boyle within my brest   
- Sometime breake forth and they can well declare   
- The hartes vnrest and how that it doth fare,   
- The pain therof the grief and all the rest.   
- The watred eyen from whence the teares doe fall,   
- Do fele some force or els they would be drye:   
- The wasted flesh of colour ded can trye,   
- and somthing tell what swetenesse is in gall.   
- And he that lust to see and to disarne,   
- How care can force within a weried minde:   
- Come he to me I am that place assinde.   
- But for all this no force it doth no harme.   
- The wound alas happe in some other place:   
- From whence no toole away the skar can race.   
-   But you that of such like haue had your part,   
- Can best be iudge wherfore my frend so deare:   
- I thought it good my state should now appeare,   
- To you and that there is no great desart.   
- And wheras you in weighty matters great:   
- Of fortune saw the shadow that you know,   
- For trifling thinges I now am striken so   
- That though I fele my hart doth wound and beat:   
- I sit alone saue on the second day:   
- My feuer comes with whom I spend my time,   
- In burning heat while that she list assigne.   
- And who hath helth and libertie alway:   
- Let him thank god and let him not prouoke,   
- To haue the like of this my painfull stroke.   
    
## The piller perisht

  The louer lamentes the death of his loue.   

  - The piller perisht is wherto I lent,   
- The strongest stay of mine vnquiet minde:   
- The like of it no man again can finde:   
- From East to West still seking though he went,   
- To mine vnhappe for happe away hath rent,   
- Of all my ioy the very bark and rynde:   
- And I (alas) by chance am thus assinde.   
- Daily to moorne till death do it relent,   
- But since that thus it is by desteny,       
- What can I more but haue a wofull hart,   
- My penne, in plaint, my voyce in carefull crye:   
- My minde in wo, my body full of smart.   
- And I my self, my selfe alwayes to hate,   
- Till dreadfull death do ease my dolefull state.   
    
## Go burning sighes

  The louer sendeth sighes to mone his sute.   

  - Go burning sighes vnto the frosen hart,   
- Go breake the yse which pities painfull dart.   
- Myght neuer perce and yf that mortall prayer,   
- In heauen be herd, at lest yet I desire.   
- That death or mercy end my wofull smart.   
- Take with thee payn, wherof I haue my part,   
- And eke the flame from which I cannot start,   
- And leaue me then in rest, I you require:   
- Go burning sighes fulfil that I desire.   
- I must go worke I see by craft and art,   
- For truth and faith in her is laid apart:   
- Alas, I can not therfore assaile her,   
- With pitefull complaint and scalding fier,   
- That from my brest disceiuably doth start.   
    
## So feble is the threde

  Complaint of the absence of his loue.   

  - So feble is the threde, that doth the burden stay,   
- Of my poore life: in heauy plight, that falleth in decay:   
- That, but it haue elswhere some ayde or some succours:   
- The running spindle of my fate anone shall end his course.   
- For since thunhappy hower, that dyd me to depart,   
- From my swete weale: one onely hope hath stayed my life, apart:   
- Which doth perswade such wordes vnto my sored minde:   
- Maintain thy self, O wofull wight, some better luck to finde.   
- For though thou be depriued from thy desired sight:   
- Who can thee tell, if thy returne be for thy more delight?       
- Or, who can tell, thy losse if thou mayst once recouer?   
- Some pleasant hower thy wo may wrappe: & thee defend, & couer.   
- Thus in this trust as yet it hath my life sustained:   
- But now (alas) I see it faint: and I, by trust, am trayned.   
- The tyme doth flete, and I se how the howers, do bend   
- So fast: that I haue scant the space to mark my commyng end.   
- Westward the sonne from out the East scant shewes his light:   
- When in the West he hides him strayt, within the dark of nyght.   
- And comes as fast, where he began, his path awry.   
- From Fast to West, from West to East so doth his iourney ly.   
- The life so short, so fraile, that mortall men liue here:   
- So great a weight, so heauy charge the bodies, that we bere:   
- That, when I think vpon the distaunce, and the space:   
- That doth so farre deuide me from my dere desired face:   
- I know not, how tattain the winges, that I require,   
- To lift me vp: that I might flie, to folow my desyre.   
- Thus of that hope, that doth my life somethyng sustayne,   
- Alas: I feare, and partly fele: full litle doth remain.   
- Eche place doth bring me griefe: where I do not behold   
- Those liuely eyes: which of my thoughts wer wont [the] keys to hold   
- Those thoughtes were pleasa[n]t swete: whilst I enioyed that grace:   
- My pleasure past, my present pain, when I might well embrace.   
- And, for because my want should more my wo encrease:   
- In watch, and slepe, both day, and night, my will doth neuer cease   
- That thing to wish: wherof since I did leese the sight:   
- Was neuer thing that mought in ought my woful hart delight,   
- Thunesy lyfe, I lead, doth teach me for to mete   
- The floodes, the seas, the land, the hylles: that doth the[m] entermete   
- Twene me, and those shene lightes: that wonted for to clere   
- My darked panges of cloudy thoughts, as bright as Pheb[es] spere,   
- It teacheth me, also, what was my pleasant state:   
- The more to fele, by such record, how that my wealth doth bate.   
- If such record (alas) prouoke thenflamed mynde:   
- Which sprong that day, that I did leaue the best of me behynde:   
- If loue forget himself, by length of absence, let:   
- Who doth me guyde (O wofull wretch) vnto this bayted net?   
- Where doth encrease my care: much better wer for me,   
- As dumme, as stone, all thyng forgot, still absent for to be.   
- Alas: the clere cristall, the bright transplendant glasse   
- Doth not bewray the colours hidde, which vnderneth it hase:   
- As doth thaccumbred sprite the thoughtfull throwes discouer,   
- Of feares delite, of feruent loue: that in our hartes we couer.   
- Out by these eyes, it sheweth that euermore delight.       
- In plaint, and teares to seke redresse: and eke both day and night.   
- These kindes of pleasures most wherein men so reioyce,   
- To me they do redubble still of stormy sighes the voyce.   
- For, I am one of them, whom playnt doth well content:   
- It sits me well: myne absent wealth me semes for to lament:   
- And with my teares, tassay to charge myne eies twayn:   
- Lyke as my hart aboue the brink is fraughted full of payn.   
- And forbecause, therto, of those fair eyes to treate   
- Do me prouoke: I wyll returne, my plaint thus to repeate.   
- For, there is nothing els, that toucheth me so within:   
- Where they rule all: and I alone nought but the case, or skin.   
- Wherefore, I shall returne to them, as well, or spring:   
- From whom descendes my mortall wo, aboue all other thing.   
- So shall myne eyes in pain accompany my hart:   
- That were the guides, that did it lead of loue to fele the smart.   
- The crisped golde, that doth surmount Apollos pride:   
- The liuely streames of pleasant starres that vnder it doth glyde:   
- Wherein the beames of loue doe styll encrease theyr heate:   
- Which yet so farre touch me so nere, in colde to make me sweate.   
- The wyse and pleasant talk, so rare, orels[^]: or els

 alone:   
- That gaue to me the curteis gift, that erst had neuer none:   
- Be farre from me, alas: and euery other thyng   
- I might forbeare with better wyll: then this that dyd me bryng,   
- With pleasant worde and chere, redresse of lingred pain:   
- And wonted oft in kindled will to vertue me to trayn.   
- Thus, am I forst to heare, and harken after newes.   
- My comfort scant my large desire in doutfull trust renewes.   
- And yet with more delite to mone my wofull case:   
- I must complain those handes, those armes: [that] firmely do embrace   
- Me from my self: and rule the sterne of my poore lyfe:   
- The swete disdaines, the pleasant wrathes, and eke [the] louely strife:   
- That wonted well to tune in temper iust, and mete,   
- The rage: that oft dyd make me erre, by furour vndiscrete.   
- All this is hydde me fro, with sharp, and ragged hylles:   
- At others will, my long abode my depe dispaire fullfils.   
- And if my hope sometime ryse vp, by some redresse:   
- It stumbleth straite, for feble faint: my feare hath such excesse.   
- Such is the sort of hope: the lesse for more desyre:   
- And yet I trust ere that I dye to see that I require:   
- The restyng place of loue: where vertue dwelles and growes   
- There I desire, my wery life, somtime, may take repose.   
- My song: thou shalt attain to finde that pleasant place:       
- Where she doth lyue, by who[m] I liue: may chance, to haue this grace   
- When she hath red, and sene the grief, wherin I serue:   
- Betwene her brestes she shall thee put: there, shall she thee reserue   
- Then, tell her, that I cumme: she shall me shortly see:   
- And if for waighte the body fayle, the soule shall to her flee.   
    
## Svffised not (madame)

  The louer blameth his loue for renting of the letter he sent her.   

  - Svffised not (madame) that you did teare,   
- My wofull hart, but thus also to rent:   
- The weping paper that to you I sent.   
- Wherof eche letter was written with a teare.   
- Could not my present paines, alas suffise,   
- Your gredy hart? and that my hart doth fele,   
- Tormentes that prick more sharper then the stele,   
- But new and new must to my lot arise.   
- Vse then my death. So shal your cruelty:   
- Spite of your spite rid me from all my smart,   
- And I no more such tormentes of the hart:   
- Fele as I do. This shalt thou gain thereby.   
    
## When first mine eyes

  The louer curseth the tyme when first he fell in loue.   

  - When first mine eyes did view, and marke,   
- Thy faire beawtie to beholde:   
- And when mine eares listned to hark:   
- The pleasant wordes, that thou me tolde:   
- I would as then, I had been free,   
- From eares to heare, and eyes to see.   
- And when my lips gan first to moue,   
- Wherby my hart to thee was knowne:   
- And when my tong did talk of loue,   
- To thee that hast true loue down throwne:   
- I would, my lips, and tong also:       
- Had then bene dum, no deale to go.   
- And when my handes haue handled ought,   
- That thee hath kept in memorie:   
- And when my fete haue gone, and sought   
- To finde and geat thy company:   
- I would, eche hand a foote had bene,   
- And I eche foote a hand had sene.   
- And when in mynde I did consent   
- To folow this my fansies will:   
- And when my hart did first relent,   
- To tast such bayt, my life to spyll:   
- I would, my hart had bene as thyne:   
- Orels[^]: or els

 thy hart had bene, as mine.   
    
## Synce loue wyll nedes

  The louer determineth to serue faithfully.   

  - Synce loue wyll nedes, that I shall loue:   
- Of very force I must agree.   
- And since no chance may it remoue:   
- In welth, and in aduersitie,   
- I shall alway my self apply   
- To serue, and suffer paciently.   
-   Though for good will I finde but hate:   
- And cruelty my life to wast:   
- And though that still a wretched state   
- Should pine my dayes vnto the last:   
- Yet I professe it willingly.   
- To serue, and suffer paciently.   
-   For since my hart is bound to serue:   
- And I not ruler of mine owne:   
- What so befall, tyll that I sterue.   
- By proofe full well it shall be knowne:   
- That I shall still my selfe apply   
- To serue, and suffer paciently.   
-   Yea though my grief finde no redresse:   
- But still increase before mine eyes:   
- Though my reward be cruelnesse,   
- With all the harme, happe can deuise:   
- Yet I professe it willingly       
- To serue, and suffer paciently.   
-   Yea though fortune her pleasant face   
- Should shew, to set me vp a loft:   
- And streight, my wealth for to deface,   
- Should writhe away, as she doth oft:   
- Yet would I styll my self apply   
- To serue and suffer paciently.   
-   There is no grief, no smart, no wo:   
- That yet I fele, or after shall:   
- That from this mynde may make me go,   
- And whatsoeuer me befall:   
- I do professe it willingly   
- To serue and suffer paciently.   
    
## Mystrustfull mindes be moued

  The louer suspected blameth yll tonges.   

  - Mystrustfull mindes be moued   
- To haue me in suspect.   
- The troth it shalbe proued:   
- Which time shall once detect.   
-   Though falshed go about   
- Of crime me to accuse:   
- At length I do not doute,   
- But truth shall me excuse.   
-   Such sawce, as they haue serued   
- To me without desart:   
- Euen as they haue deserued:   
- Therof god send them part.

- [La:] What is the thing, that hath inflamde thy hert?   
- [Lo:]  A certain point, as feruent, as the fyre.   
- [La:] The heate shall cease, if that thou wilt conuert.   
- [Lo:]  I cannot stoppe the feruent raging yre.       
- La. What may I do, if thy self cause thy smart?   
- Lo.   Heare my request, alas, with weping chere.   
- La. With right good wyll, say on: lo, I thee here.   
- Lo.   That thing would I, that maketh two content.   
- La. Thou sekest, perchance, of me, that I may not.   
- Lo.   Would god, thou wouldst, as thou maist, well assent.   
- La. That I may not, thy grief is mine: God wot.   
- Lo.   But I it fele, what so thy wordes haue ment.

- La. I see no time to answer, yea, but no.   
- Lo.   Say ye, dere hart: and stand no more in dout.   
- La. I may not grant a thing, that is so dere.   
- Lo.   Lo, with delayes thou drieues me still about.   
- La. Thou wouldest my death: it plainly doth appere.   
- Lo.   First, may my hart his bloode, and life blede out.   
- La. Then for my sake, alas, thy will forbere.   
- Lo.   From day to day, thus wastes my life away.   
- La. Yet, for the best, suffer some small delay.   
- Lo.   Now, good, say yea: do once so good a dede.   
- La. If I sayd yea: what should therof ensue?   
- Lo.   An hart in pain of succour so should spede,   
-     Twixt yea, and nay, my doute shall styll renew.   
-       My swete, say yea: and do away this drede.   
- La. Thou wilt nedes so: be it so: but then be trew.   
- Lo.   Nought would I els, nor other treasure none.   
-     Thus, hartes be wonne, by loue, request and mone.   
    
## Of purpose, loue chose first

  why loue is blinde.   

  - Of purpose, loue chose first for to be blinde:   
- For, he with sight of that, that I beholde,   
- Vanquisht had been, against all godly kinde.   
- His bow your hand, and trusse should haue vnfolde.   
- And he with me to serue had bene assinde.   
- But, for he blinde, and recklesse would him holde:   
- And still, by chance, his dedly strokes bestowe:   
- With such, as see, I serue, and suffer wo.   
    
## What rage is this?

  To his vnkinde loue.       

  - What rage is this? what furor? of what kinde?   
- What power, what plage doth wery thus my minde:   
- Within my bones to rankle is assinde   
- What poyson pleasant swete?   
-   Lo, see, myne eyes flow with continuall teares:   
- The body still away slepelesse it weares:   
- My foode nothing my fainting strength repayres,   
- Nor doth my limmes sustain.   
-   In depe wide wound, the dedly stroke doth turne:   
- To cureles skarre that neuer shall returne.   
- Go to: triumph: reioyce thy goodly turne:   
- Thy frend thou doest oppresse.   
-   Oppresse thou doest: and hast of him no cure:   
- Nor yet my plaint no pitie can procure.   
- Fierce Tigre, fell, hard rock without recure:   
- Cruell rebell to Loue,   
-   Once may thou loue, neuer beloued again:   
- So loue thou styll, and not thy loue obtain:   
- So wrathfull loue, with spites of iust disdain,   
- May thret thy cruell hart.   
    
## Desire (alas) my master

  The louer blameth hs[^]: his

 instant desyre.   

  - Desire (alas) my master, and my fo:

- By forced law, and mutabilitie.

- Once to refrain, but still agree,

- And other haue, that I deserue.   
-   Such is the fortune, that I haue   
- To loue them most, that loue me lest:   
- And to my pain to seke, and craue   
- The thing, that other haue possest.   
- So thus in vain alway I serue.   
- And other haue, that I deserue.   
-   And till I may apease the heate:   
- If that my happe will happe so well:   
- To waile my wo my hart shall freate:   
- Whose pensif pain my tong can tell.   
- Yet thus vnhappy must I serue:   
- And other haue, that I deserue.

## My mothers maides

  Of the meane and sure estate written to Iohn Poins.   

  - My mothers maides when they do sowe and spinne:   
- They sing a song made of the feldishe mouse:   
- That forbicause her liuelod was but thinne,   
- Would nedes go se her townish sisters house,   
- She thought, her selfe endured to greuous payne,   
- The stormy blastes her caue so sore did sowse:   
- That when the furrowes swimmed with the rayne:   
- She must lie colde, and wet in sory plight.   
- And worse then that, bare meat there did remaine   
- To comfort her, when she her house had dight:   
- Sometime a barly corne: sometime a beane:       
- For which she laboured hard both day and night,   
- In haruest tyme, while she might go and gleane.   
- And when her store was stroyed with the floode:   
- Then weleaway for she vndone was cleane.   
- Then was she faine to take in stede of fode,   
- Slepe if she might, her honger to begyle.   
- My sister (quod she) hath a liuyng good:   
- And hence from me she dwelleth not a myle.   
- In colde and storme, she lieth warme and dry,   
- In bed of downe: the durt doth not defile   
- Her tender fote, she labours not as I,   
- Richely she fedes, and at the richemans cost:   
- And for her meat she nedes not craue nor cry.   
- By sea, by land, of delicates the most   
- Her cater sekes, and spareth for no perill:   
- She fedes on boyle meat, bake meat, and on rost:   
- And hath therfore no whit of charge nor trauell.   
- And when she list the licour of the grape   
- Doth glad her hart, till that her belly swell.   
- And at this iourney makes she but a iape:   
- So forth she goes, trusting of all this wealth,   
- With her sister her part so for to shape:   
- That if she might there kepe her self in health:   
- To liue a Lady while her life doth last.   
- And to the dore now is she come by stealth:   
- And with her fote anone she scrapes full fast.   
- Thother for fear, durst not well scarse appere:   
- Of euery noyse so was the wretch agast.   
- At last, she asked softly who was there.   
- And in her language as well as she could,   
- Pepe (quod the other) sister I am here.   
- Peace (quod the towne mouse) why speakest thou so loude?   
- And by the hand she toke her fayre and well.   
- Welcome (quod she) my sister by the rode.   
- She feasted her that ioye it was to tell   
- The fare they hadde, they dranke the wine so clere:   
- And as to purpose now and then it fell:   
- She chered her, with how sister what chere?   
- Amid this ioye be fell a sory chance:   
- That (weleaway) the stranger bought full dere   
- The fare she had. For as she lookt a scance:   
- Vnder a stole she spied two stemyng eyes.       
- In a rounde head, with sharpe eares: in Fraunce   
- Was neuer mouse so ferde, for the vnwise   
- Had not ysene such a beast before.   
- Yet had nature taught her after her gise,   
- To know her fo: and dread him euermore.   
- The townemouse fled: she knew whither to go:   
- The other had no shift, but wonders sore   
- Ferde of her life, at home she wisht her tho:   
- And to the dore (alas) as she did skippe:   
- The heauen it would, lo: and eke her chance was so:   
- At the threshold her sely fote did trippe:   
- And ere she might recouer it agayne:   
- The traytour cat had caught her by the hippe:   
- And made her there against hir will remayne:   
- That had forgot her power, surety and rest,   
- For semyng welth, wherin she thought to raine.   
- Alas (my Poyns) how men do seke the best,   
- And finde the worst, by errour as they stray,   
- And no maruell, when sight is so opprest,   
- And blindes the guide, anone out of the way   
- Goeth guide and all in seking quiet life.   
- O wretched mindes, there is no golde that may   
- Graunt that you seke, no warre, no peace, no strife.   
- No, no, although thy head were hoopt with golde,   
- Sergeant with mace, with hawbart, sword, nor knife,   
- Can not repulse the care that folow should.   
- Ech kinde of life hath with him his disease.   
- Liue in delite, euen as thy lust would:   
- And thou shalt finde, when lust doth most thee please:   
- It irketh straight, and by it selfe doth fade.   
- A small thing is it, that may thy minde appease.   
- None of you al there is, that is so madde,   
- To seke for grapes on brambles, or on bryers:   
- Nor none I trow that hath his witte so badde,   
- To set his haye for conies ouer riuers:   
- Nor ye set not a dragge net for an hare.   
- And yet the thing, that most is your desire,   
- You do misseke, with more trauell and care.   
- Make plaine thine hart, that it be not knotted   
- With hope or dreade, and se thy will be bare   
- From all affectes, whom vice hath euer spotted.   
- Thy selfe content with that is thee assinde:       
- And vse it well that is to thee alotted.   
- Then seke no more out of thy selfe to finde   
- The thing that thou hast sought so long before.   
- For thou shalt feele it stickyng in thy minde,   
- Madde if ye list to continue your sore.   
- Let present passe, and gape on time to come:   
- And depe your selfe in trauell more and more.   
- Henceforth (my Poins) this shalbe all and summe   
- These wretched foles shall haue nought els of me:   
- But, to the great God and to his dome,   
- None other paine pray I for them to be:   
- But when the rage doth leade them from the right:   
- That lokyng backward, Vertue they may se,   
- Euen as she is, so goodly fayre and bright.   
- And whilst they claspe their lustes in armes a crosse:   
- Graunt them good Lord, as thou maist of thy might,   
- To freate inward, for losyng such a losse.   
    
## Myne owne Iohn Poyns

  Of the Courtiers life written to Iohn Poins.   

  - Myne owne Iohn Poyns: sins ye delite to know   
- The causes why that homeward I me draw,   
- And fle the prease of courtes, where so they go:   
- Rather then to liue thrall vnder the awe,   
- Of lordly lokes, wrapped within my cloke,   
- To will and lust learnyng to set a law:   
- It is not, because I scorne or mocke   
- The power of them: whom fortune here hath lent   
- Charge ouer vs, of ryght to strike the stroke.   
- But true it is that I haue alwayes ment   
- Lesse to esteme them, then the common sort   
- Of outward thinges: that iudge in their entent,   
- Without regard, what inward doth resort.   
- I graunt, sometime of glory that the fire   
- Doth touch my hart. Me list not to report   
- Blame by honour, and honour to desire.   
- But how may I this honour now attaine?   
- That can not dye the colour blacke a lyer.   
- My Poyns, I can not frame my tune to fayne:   
- To cloke the truth, for prayse without desert,   
- Of them that list all nice for to retaine.       
- I can not honour them, that set their part   
- With Venus, and Bacchus, all their life long:   
- Nor holde my peace of them, although I smart.   
- I can not crouch nor knele to such a wrong:   
- To worship them like God on earth alone:   
- That are as wolues these sely lambes among.   
- I can not with my wordes complaine and mone,   
- And suffer nought: nor smart without complaynt:   
- Nor turne the worde that from my mouth is gone.   
- I can not speake and loke like as a saynt:   
- Vse wiles for wit, and make disceyt a pleasure:   
- Call craft counsaile, for lucre still to paint.   
- I can not wrest the law to fill the coffer:   
- With innocent bloud to fede my selfe fatte:   
- And do most hurt: where that most helpe I offer.   
- I am not he, that can alowe the state   
- Of hye Ceasar, and damne Cato to dye:   
- That with his death did scape out of the gate,   
- From Ceasars handes, if Liuye doth not lye:   
- And would not liue, where libertie was lost,   
- So did his hart the common wealth apply.   
- I am not he, such eloquence to bost:   
- To make the crow in singyng, as the swanne:   
- Nor call the lyon of coward beastes the most.   
- That can not take a mouse, as the cat can.   
- And he that dieth for honger of the golde,   
- Call him Alexander, and say that Pan   
- Passeth Appollo in musike manifold:   
- Praise syr Topas for a noble tale,   
- And scorne the story that the knight tolde:   
- Prayse him for counsell, that is dronke of ale:   
- Grinne when he laughes, that beareth all the sway:   
- Frowne, when he frownes: and grone when he is pale:   
- On others lust to hang both night and day.   
- None of these poyntes would euer frame in me.   
- My wit is nought, I can not learne the way.   
- And much the lesse of thinges that greater be,   
- That asken helpe of colours to deuise   
- To ioyne the meane with ech extremitie:   
- With nearest vertue ay to cloke the vice.   
- And as to purpose likewise it shall fall:   
- To presse the vertue that it may not rise.       
- And as to purpose likewise it shall fall,   
- To presse the vertue that it may not rise.   
- As dronkennesse good felowship to call:   
- The frendly foe, with his faire double face,   
- Say he is gentle and curties therewithall.   
- Affirme that fauell hath a goodly grace,   
- In eloquence: And cruelty to name   
- Zeale of Iustice: And change in time and place.   
- And he that suffreth offence withoutt blame:   
- Call him pitifull, and him true and plaine,   
- That rayleth rechlesse vnto ech mans shame.   
- Say he is rude, that can not lye and faine:   
- The letcher a louer, and tyranny   
- To be the right of a Prynces rayghne.   
- I can not, I no, no, it will not be.   
- This is the cause that I could neuer yet   
- Hang on their sleues, that weygh (as thou mayst se)   
- A chippe of chance more then a pounde of wit.   
- This maketh me at home to hunt and hauke:   
- And in fowle wether at my boke to sit:   
- In frost and snow, then with my bow to stalke.   
- No man doth marke where so I ride or go.   
- In lusty leas at libertie I walke:   
- And of these newes I fele nor weale nor wo:   
- Saue that a clogge doth hang yet at my heele.   
- No force for that, for it is ordred so:   
- That I may leape both hedge and dike full wele,   
- I am not now in Fraunce, to iudge the wine:   
- With savry sauce those delicates to fele.   
- Nor yet in Spaine where one must him incline,   
- Rather then to be, outwardly to seme.   
- I meddle not with wyttes that be so fine,   
- Nor Flaunders chere lettes not my syght to deme   
- Of blacke and white, nor takes my wittes away   
- With beastlinesse: such do those beastes esteme.   
- Nor I am not, where truth is geuen in pray,   
- For money, poyson, and treason: of some   
- A common practise, vsed nyght and day.   
- But I am here in kent and christendome:   
- Among the Muses, where I reade and ryme,   
- Where if thou list myne owne Iohn Poyns to come:   
- Thou shalt be iudge, how I do spende my time.       
    
## A spendyng hand

  How to vse the court and him selfe therin, written to syr Fraunces Bryan.   

  - A Spendyng hand that alway powreth out,   
- Had nede to haue a bringer in as fast.   
- And on the stone that styll doth turne about,   
- There groweth no mosse. These prouerbes yet do last:   
- Reason hath set them in so sure a place:   
- That length of yeres their force can neuer waste.   
- When I remember this, and eke the case,   
- Wherin thou standst: I thought forthwith to write   
- (Brian) to thee? who knowes how great a grace   
- In writyng is to counsaile man the right.   
- To thee therfore that trottes still vp and downe:   
- And neuer restes, but runnyng day and night,   
- From realme to realme, from citye strete, and towne.   
- Why doest thou weare thy body to the bones?   
- And mightest at home slepe in thy bedde of downe:   
- And drinke good ale so noppy for the nones:   
- Fede thy selfe fatte, and heape vp pounde by pounde.   
- Likest thou not this? No. Why? For swine so groines   
- In stye, and chaw dung moulded on the ground.   
- And driuell on pearles with head styll in the manger,   
- So of the harpe the asse doth heare the sound.   
- So sackes of durt be filde. The neate courtier   
- So serues for lesse, then do these fatted swine.   
- Though I seme leane and drye, withouten moysture:   
- Yet will I serue my prince, my lord and thine.   
- And let them liue to fede the paunch that lyst:   
- So I may liue to fede both me and myne.   
- By God well said. But what and if thou wist   
- How to bring in, as fast as thou doest spend.   
- That would I learne. And it shall not be mist,   
- To tell thee how. Now harke what I intende.   
- Thou knowest well first, who so can seke to please,   
- Shall purchase frendes: where trouth, shall but offend.   
- Flee therefore truth, it is both welth and ease.   
- For though that trouth of euery man hath prayse:   
- Full neare that winde goeth trouth in great misease.       
- Vse vertue, as it goeth now a dayes:   
- In worde alone to make thy language swete:   
- And of the dede, yet do not as thou saies.   
- Els be thou sure: thou shalt be farre vnmete   
- To get thy bread, ech thing is now so skant.   
- Seke still thy profite vpon thy bare fete.   
- Lende in no wise: for feare that thou do want:   
- Vnlesse it be, as to a calfe a chese:   
- By which returne be sure to winne a cant   
- Of halfe at least. It is not good to leese.   
- Learne at the ladde, that in a long white cote,   
- From vnder the stall, withouten landes or feese,   
- Hath lept into the shoppe: who knowes by rote   
- This rule that I haue told thee here before.   
- Sometime also riche age beginnes to dote,   
- Se thou when there thy gaine may be the more.   
- Stay him by the arme, whele so he walke or go:   
- Be nere alway, and if he coughe to sore:   
- What he hath spit treade out, and please him so.   
- A diligent knaue that pikes his masters purse,   
- May please him so, that he withouten mo   
- Executour is. And what is he the wurs?   
- But if so chance, thou get nought of the man:   
- The wydow may for all thy charge deburs.   
- A riueld skynne, a stinkyng breath, what than?   
- A tothelesse mouth shall do thy lippes no harme.   
- The golde is good, and though she curse or banne:   
- Yet where thee list, thou mayest lye good and warme.   
- Let the olde mule bite vpon the bridle:   
- Whilst there do lye a sweter in thine arme.   
- In this also se thou be not idle:   
- Thy nece, thy cosyn, thy sister, or thy daughter,   
- If she bee faire: if handsome be her middle:   
- If thy better hath her loue besought her:   
- Auaunce his cause, and he shall helpe thy nede.   
- It is but loue, turne it to a laughter.   
- But ware I say, so gold thee helpe and spede:   
- That in this case thou be not so vnwise,   
- As Pandar was in such a like dede.   
- For he the fole of conscience was so nice:   
- That he no gaine would haue for all his payne.   
- Be next thy selfe for frendshyp beares no price.       
- Laughest thou at me, why? do I speake in vaine?   
- No not at thee, but at thy thrifty iest.   
- Wouldest thou, I should for any losse or gayne,   
- Change that for golde, that I haue tane for best   
- Next godly thinges: to haue an honest name?   
- Should I leaue that? then take me for a beast.   
- Nay then farewell, and if thou care for shame:   
- Content thee then with honest pouertie:   
- With free tong, what thee mislikes, to blame.   
- And for thy trouth sometime aduersitie.   
- And therwithall this thing I shall thee giue,   
- In this world now litle prosperitie:   
- And coyne to kepe, as water in a siue.

- That mighty Atlas taught, the supper lastyng long,   
- With crisped lockes on golden harpe, Iopas sang in song.   
- That same (quod he) that we the world do call and name:   
- Of heauen and earth with all contents, it is the very frame.   
- Or thus, of heauenly powers by more power kept in one   
- Repungnant kindes, in mids of who[m] the earth hath place alone:   
- Firme, round, of liuing thinges, the mother place and nourse:   
- Without the which in egal weight, this heuen doth hold his course   
- And it is callde by name, the first and mouyng heauen,   
- The firmament is placed next, conteinyng other seuen,   
- Of heauenly powers that same is planted full and thicke:   
- As shinyng lightes which we call stars, that therin cleue & sticke.   
- With great swift sway, the first, & with his restlesse sours,   
- Carieth it self, and al those eyght, in euen continuall cours.   
- And of this world so round within that rollyng case,   
- Two points there be that neuer moue, but firmely kepe their place   
- The tone we see alway, the tother standes obiect   
- Against the same, deuidyng iust the grounde by line direct.   
- Which by imaginacion, drawen from the one to thother   
- Toucheth the centre of the earth, for way there is none other.   
- And these be callde the Poles, discriyde by starres not bright.   
- Artike the one northward we see: Antartike thother hyght.       
- The line, that we deuise from thone to thother so:   
- As axel is, vpon the which the heauens about do go   
- Which of water nor earth, of ayre nor fire haue kinde.   
- Therfore the substance of those same were harde for man to finde.   
- But they bene vncorrupt, simple and pure vnmixt:   
- And so we say been all those starres, that in those same be fixt.   
- And eke those erryng seuen, in circle as they stray:   
- So calld, because agaynst that first they haue repungnant way:   
- And smaller bywayes to, skant sensible to man:   
- To busy worke for my pore harpe: let sing them he, that can.   
- The wydest saue the first, of all these nine aboue   
- One hundred yere doth aske of space, for one degree to moue.   
- Of which degrees we make, in the first moouyng heauen,   
- Three hundred and threscore in partes iustly deuided euen.   
- And yet there is another betwene those heauens two:   
- Whose mouyng is so sly so slack: I name it not for now.   
- The seuenth heauen or the shell, next to the starry sky,   
- All those degrees that gatherth vp, with aged pase so sly:   
- And doth performe the same, as elders count hath bene,   
- In nine and twenty yeres complete, and daies almost sixtene:   
- Doth cary in his bowt the starre of Saturne old:   
- A threatner of all liuyng things, with drought & with his cold.   
- The sixt whom this conteyns, doth stalke with yoonger pase:   
- And in twelue yere doth somwhat more then thothers viage was.   
- And this in it doth bear the starre of Ioue benigne,   
- Twene Saturns malice and vs men, frendly defendyng signe.   
- The fift bears bloudy Mars, that in three hundred daies,   
- And twise eleuen with one full yere, hath finisht all those wayes.   
- A yere doth aske the fourth, and howers therto sixe,   
- And in the same the dayes eie the sunne, therin her styckes.   
- The third, that gouernd is by that, that gouerns mee:   
- And loue for loue, and for no loue prouokes: as oft we see:   
- In like space doth performe that course, that did the tother.   
- So dothe the next vnto the same, that second is in order.   
- But it doth bear the starre, that calld is Mercury:   
- That many a crafty secrete steppe doth tread, as Calcars try.   
- That sky is last, and fixt next vs, those wayes hath gone,   
- In seuen and twenty co[m]mon dayes, and eke the third of one:   
- And beareth with his sway, the diuers Moone about:   
- Now bright, now brown, now be[n]t, now ful, & now her light is out   
- Thus haue they of their owne two mouynges al these seuen   
- One, wherin they be caried still, ech in his seueral heuen.       
- An other of them selues, where their bodyes be layed   
- In bywayes, and in lesser rowndes, as I afore haue sayd.   
- Saue of them all the sunne doth stray lest from the straight,   
- The starry sky hath but one cours, that we haue calde the eight.   
- And all these moouynges eight are ment from west to the east:   
- Although they seme to clime aloft, I say from east to west.   
- But that is but by force of the first mouyng sky:   
- In twise twelue houres fro[m] east to east [that] carieth the[m] by and by.   
- But marke we well also, these mouinges of these seuen,   
- Be not about the axell tree of the first mouyng heuen.   
- For they haue their two poles directly tone tothe  [^]: to the

 tother. &c.

## What sweet releef

  A trueloue.   

  - What sweet releef the showers to thirstie plants we see:   
- What dere delite, the blooms to beez: my trueloue is to mee.   
-   As fresh, and lusty vere foule winter doth exceed:   
- As morning bright, with scarlet sky, doth passe the euenings weed:   
-   As melow peares aboue the crabs esteemed be:   
- So doth my loue surmount them all, whom yet I hap to se.   
-   The oke shall oliues bear: the lamb, the lion fray:   
- The owle shall match the nightingale, in tuning of her lay:   
-   Or I my loue let slip out of mine entiere hert:   
- So deep reposed in my brest is she, for her desert.   
-   For many blessed giftes, O happy, happy land:   
- Where Mars, and Pallas striue to make their glory most to stand   
-   Yet, land, more is thy blisse: that, in this cruell age,   
- A Venus ymp, thou hast brought forth, so stedfast, and so sage.   
-   Among the Muses nyne, a tenth yf Ioue would make:   
- And to the Graces three, a fourth: her would Apollo take.   
-   Let some for honour hoont, and hourd the massy golde:   
- With her so I may liue, and dye, my weal cannot be tolde.   
    
## Phebe twise took her horns

  The louer to his dear, of his exceding loue.   

  - Phebe twise took her horns, twise layd them by:   
- I, all the while, on thee could set no yie.   
- Yet doo I liue: if life you may it call,   
- Which onely holds my heauy hert, as thrall.   
- Certesse for death doo I ful often pray,   
- To rid my wo, and pull these pangs away.   
- So plaines Prometh, his womb no time to faile:   
- And, ayelife left, had leefer, he might quaile.   
- I erre, orels[^]: or els

 who this deuise first found,   
- By that gripes name he cleped loue vnsound.   
- In all the town, what streat haue I not seen?   
- In all the town, yet hath not Carie been.   
- Eyther thy sier restraines thy free outgate,   
- O woman, worthy of farre better state:       
- Or peeplepesterd London lykes thee nought,   
- But pleasant ayr, in quiet countrie sought.   
- Perchaunce, in olds our loue thou doest repeat,   
- And in sure place woldst euery thing retreat.   
- Forth shall I go, ne will I stay for none,   
- Vntyll I may somwhere finde thee alone.   
- Therwhile, keep you of hands, and neck the heew:   
- Let not your cheeks becoom or black, or bleew.   
- Go with welcouerd hed: for you incase[^]: in case

  
- Apollo spied, burn wold he on your face.   
- Daphne, in groue, clad with bark of baytree:   
- Ay mee, if such a tale should ryse of thee.   
- Calisto found, in woods, Ioues force to fell:   
- I pray you, let him not like you so well.   
- Eigh, how much dreed? Here lurks of theeus a haunt:   
- Whoso thou beest, preyseeker prowd, auaunt.   
- Acteon may teach thee Dictynnaes ire:   
- Of trouth, this goddesse hath as fiers a fire.   
- What doo I speak? O chief part of my minde,   
- Vnto your eares these woords no way doo finde.   
- Wold god, when you read this, obserue I might   
- Your voyce, and of your countinaunce haue sight,   
- Then, for our loue, good hope were not to seek:   
- I mought say with myself, she will be meek.   
- Doutlesse I coom, what euer town you keep,   
- Or where you woon, in woods, or mountanes steep:   
- I coom, and if all pear not in my face,   
- Myself will messenger be of my case.   
- If to my prayer all deaf, you dare saye, no:   
- Streight of my death agilted shall you go.   
- Yet in mid death, this same shall ease my hart:   
- That Carie, thou wert cause of all the smart.   
    
## Louers men warn the corps

  The louer asketh pardon of his dere, for fleeyng from her.       

  - Louers men warn the corps beloued to flee,   
- From the blinde fire in case they wold liue free.   
- Ay mee, how oft haue I fled thee, my Day?   
- I flee, but loue bides in my brest alway.   
- Lo yet agayn, I graunt, I gan remoue:   
- But both I could, and can say still, I loue.   
- If woods I seek, cooms to my thought Adone:   
- And well the woods do know my heauy mone.   
- In gardens if I walk: Narcissus there   
- I spy, and Hyacints with weepyng chere:   
- If meads I tred, O what a fyre I feel?   
- In flames of loue I burn from hed to heel.   
- Here I behold dame Ceres ymp in flight:   
- Here bee, methynk, black Plutoes steeds in sight.   
- Stronds if I look vpon, the Nymphs I mynde:   
- And, in mid sea, oft feruent powrs I fynde.   
- The hyer that I clyme, in mountanes wylde,   
- The nearer mee approcheth Venus chylde.   
- Towns yf I haunt: in short, shall I all say?   
- There soondry fourms I view, none to my pay.   
- Her fauour now I note, and now her yies:   
- Her hed, amisse: her foot, her cheeks, her guyse.   
- In fyne, where mater wants, defautes I fayn:   
- Whom other, fayr: I deem, she hath soom stayn.   
- What boots it then to flee, sythe in nightyde,   
- And daytyme to, my Day is at my side?   
- A shade therfore mayst thou be calld, by ryght:   
- But shadowes, derk, thou, Day, art euer bright.   
- Nay rather, worldly name is not for thee:   
- Sithe thou at once canst in twoo places bee.   
- Forgiue me, goddesse, and becoom my sheeld:   
- Euen Venus to Anchise herself dyd yeeld.   
- Lo, I confesse my flight: bee good therfore:   
- Ioue, oftentimes, hath pardond mee for more.   
- Next day, my Day, to you I coom my way:   
- And, yfyou[^]: yf you

 suffer mee, due payns wyll pay.

- Orels,[^]: or els

 of face indifferent: (they say,   
- Face but indifferent will soone decay.)

- Ne can you say, she is all holly mine.   
- And be she chaste (if noman[^]: no man

 chaunce to sew)

- Hereto heap vp vndaunted hed, stif hart,   
- And all the rest: eche spouse can tell a part.   
- Leaue then, this way, to hope for happy life:

- If faire me fayle, with one indifferent.   
- Fair, you alledge, a thousand will applie:   
- But, nere so oft requirde, she will denie.   
- Meane beautie doth soone fade: therof playn hee,   
- Who nothing loues in woman, but her blee.   
- Frute if she bring, of frute is ioyfull sight:   
- If none, what then? our burden is but light.   
- The rest, you ming, certesse, we graunt, be great:   
- Stif hert, vndaunted hed cause soom to freat.   
- But, in all thinges, inborne displeasures be:   
- Yea pleasure we, full of displeasure, se.   
- And maruail you, I looke for good estate,   
- Hereafter if a woman be my mate?       
- Oh straight is vertues path, if sooth men say:   
- And likewise, that I seek, straight is the way.

  The Muses.   

  - Imps of king Ioue, and quene Remembrance lo,

- Fine Erato, whose look a liuely chere   
- Presents, in dauncyng keeps a comely grace.   
- With semely gesture doth Polymnie stere:   
- Whose wordes holle routes of renkes doo rule in place,   
- Vranie, her globes to view all bent,   
- The ninefolde heauen obserues with fixed face.   
- The blastes Euterpe tunes of instrument,

- In workyng wrong, if pleasure you attaine:   
- The pleasure soon shall vade, and uoide,[^]: voide

 as vaine:       
- But of the deed, throughout the life, the shame   
- Endures, defacyng you with fowl defame:   
- And stil torments the minde, bothe night and daye:   
- Scant length of time the spot can wash awaye.   
- Flee then ylswading pleasures baits vntreew:

- With dayly vse, hee may the metall wear,   
- And bothe the strength, and hardnesse eke impaire.   
- Again, in case his yron hee cast aside,   
- And carelesse long let it vntoucht abide:   
- Sythe, cankerd rust inuades the mettall sore,   
- And her fowl teeth there fastneth more and more.   
- So man, incase[^]: in case

 his corps hee tyre, and faint   
- With labor long: his strength it shall attaint.   
- But if in sluggard slothe the same dothe lye:   
- That manly might will fall away, and dye:   
- That bodies strength, that force of wit remooue:   
- Hee shall, for man, a weaklyng woman prooue.   
- Wherfore, my childe, holde twene these twaine the waye:   
- Nother with to much toyl thy lyms decaye,   
- In idle ease nor giue to vices place:   
- In bothe who measure keeps, hee hath good grace.

- Depe dumps do nought, but dull, not meet for man but beast:   
- A mery hert sage Salomon countes his continuall feast.   
- Sad soll, before thy time, brings thee vnto deaths dore:   
- That fond condicions haue bereft, late daye can not restore.

- Fayr Titan, with his leam of light, returns a goodly grace:   
- So, when our burdened brest is whelmd with clowdy thought,   
- A pleasant calm throughout the corps, by chereful hart is brought   
- Enioye we then our ioyes, and in the lorde reioyce:

- While latine you, and french frequent: while English tales you tel:   
- Italian whiles, and Spanish you do hear, and know full well:

- Wherfore the glory got maintayne, maintayne the honour great.   
- So shal the world my doom approue, and set you in that seat,   
- Where Graces, Muses, and Ioues ymp, the ioyful Venus, raigne:

 but heauen, and erth, to make,   
- Throughout the world, this greef his rigor take.

- Woorthy to lyue olde Nestors yeres thou wert.

- Than those conceits, that from your mouth did passe.

- Battail for peas, free raign for bondage bad.   
- These wretched erthly stounds who can compare   
- To heanenly[^]: heauenly

 seats, and those delites moste rare?   
- We frayl, you firm: we with great trouble tost,   
- You bathe in blisse, that neuer shall bee lost.

- Her doolfull tunes my chered Muse now stayes.

- Or, did the dreed of wretched world driue thee   
- Leste thou this afterfall should hap to see:   
- Mauortian moods, Saturnian furies fell,   
- Of tragicall turmoyls the haynous hell?

- The hartiest mate, that euer trod the mold:

- For what is hee, can quietly sustayn   
- So great a grief, with mouth as styll, as stone?   
- My loue, my lyfe, of ioye my ieewell is gone.   
- This harty zeale if any wight disprooue,   
- As womans work, whom feeble minde doth mooue:   
- Hee neither knowes the mighty natures laws,   
- Nor touching elders deeds hath seen old saws.   
- Martius, to vanquish Rome, was set on fire:   
- But vanquisht fell, at moothers boon, his ire.   
- Into Hesperian land Sertorius fled,   
- Of parent aye cheef care had in his hed.   
- Dear weight on shoulders Sicil brethren bore,   
- While Etnaes gyant spouted flames full sore.   
- Not more of Tyndars ymps hath Sparta spoke,   
- Than Arge of charged necks with parents yoke.   
- Nor onely them thus dyd foretyme entreat:   
- Then, was the noorsse also in honour great.   
- Caiet the Phrygian from amid fireflame   
- Rescued, who gaue to Latine stronds the name.   
- Acca, in dubble sense Lupa ycleaped,   
- To Romane Calendars a feast hath heaped.   
- His Capra Ioue among the sterres hath pight:   
- In welkin clere yet lo she shineth bryght.   
- Hyades as gratefully Lyai did place,       
- Whom, in primetide, supports the Bulls fayr face.   
- And should not I expresse my inward wo,   
- When you, most louyng dam, so soon hence go?   
- I, in your frutefull woomb conceyued, born was,   
- Whyle wanderyng moon ten moonths did ouerpasse.   
- Mee, brought to light, your tender arms sustaynd:   
- And, with my lips, your milky paps I straynd.   
- You mee embraced, in bosom soft you mee   
- Cherished, as I your onely chylde had bee.   
- Of yssue fayr with noombers were you blest:   
- Yet I, the bestbeloued of all the rest.   
- Good luck, certayn forereadyng moothers haue,   
- And you of mee a speciall iudgement gaue.   
- Then, when firm pase I fixed on the ground:   
- When toung gan cease to break the lispyng sound:   
- You mee streightway did too the Muses send,   
- Ne suffered long a loytervng lyfe to spend,   
- What gayn the wooll, what gayn the wed had braught,   
- It was his meed, that me there dayly taught.   
- When with Minerue I had acquaintance woon:   
- And Phebus seemd to loue mee, as his soon:   
- Browns hold I bad, at parents hest, farewell:   
- And gladly there in schools I gan to dwell:   
- Where Granta giues the ladies nyne such place,   
- That they reioyse to see theyr blisfull case.   
- With ioyes at hert, in this pernasse I bode,   
- Whyle, through his signes, fiue tymes great Titan glode:   
- And twyse as long, by that fayr foord, whereas   
- Swanfeeder Temms no furder course can passe.   
- O, what desire had you, therwhile, of mee?   
- Mid doutfull dreeds, what ioyes were wont to bee?   
- Now linnen clothes, wrought with those fyngers fyne,   
- Now other thynges of yours dyd you make myne:   
- Tyll your last thredes gan Clotho to vntwyne,   
- And of your dayes the date extreem assygne.   
- Hearyng the chaunce, your neybours made much mone:   
- A dearworth dame, they thought theyr coomfort gone.   
- Kinswoomen wept: your charge, the maydens wept:   
- Your daughters wept, whom you so well had kept.   
- But my good syre gaue, with soft woords, releef:   
- And clokes, with outward chere, his inward greef:   
- Leste, by his care, your sicknes should augment,       
- And on his case your thoughtfull hert be bent.   
- You, not forgetting yet a moothers mood,   
- When at the dore dartthirling death there stood,   
- Did saye: Adeew, dear spouse, my race is roon:   
- Wher so he bee, I haue left you a soon,   
- And Nicolas you naamd, and naamd agayn:   
- With other speech, aspiring heauenly raign:   
- When into ayre your sprite departed fled,   
- And left the corps a cold in lukewarm bed.   
- Ah, could you thus, deare mother, leaue vs all?   
- Now, should you liue: that yet, before your fall,   
- My songs you might haue soong, haue heard my voyce,   
- And in commodities of your own reioyce.   
- My sisters yet vnwedded who shall guide?   
- With whose good lessons shall they bee applyed?   
- Haue, mother, monumentes of our sore smart:   
- No costly tomb, areard with curious art:   
- Nor Mausolean masse, hoong in the ayre:   
- Nor loftie steeples, that will once appayre:   
- But waylful verse, and doolfull song accept.   
- By verse, the names of auncient peres be kept:   
- By verse, liues Hercules: by verse, Achil:   
- Hector, Ene, by verse, be famous still.   
- Such former yeres, such death hath chau[n]ced thee:   
- Closde, with good end, good life is woont to bee.   
- But now, my sacred parent, fare you well:   
- God shall cause vs agayn togither dwell,   
- What time this vniuersall globe shall hear   
- Of the last troomp the rynging voyce: great fear   
- To soom, to such as you a heauenly chear.   
- Til then, reposde rest you in gentle sleep:   
- While hee, whom to you are bequeathd, you keep.   
    
## The noble Henry

  Vpon the death of the lord Mautrauers, out of doctor Haddons latine.   

  - The noble Henry, he, that was the lord Mautrauers named:   
- Heyr to the house of thArundels, so long a time now famed:       
- Who from Fitzalens doth recount discent of worthy race,   
- Fitzalens, earls of hye estate, men of a goodly grace:   
- Whom his renowmed father had seen florish, and excell,   
- In arms, in arts, in witt, in skill, in speaking wonders well:   
- Whose yeres, to timely vertue had, and manly grauenesse caught:   
- With soden ruine is downfalln, and into ashes braught:   
- While glory his coragious hert enflames to trauail great:   
- And, in his youthly brest ther raigns an ouerferuent heat.   
- The perelesse princesse, Mary quene, her message to present,   
- This Britan lord, as one moste meet, to Cesars broother sent.   
- On coursing steeds hee rids the waye: in ship hee fleeteth fast:   
- To royall Cesars court he comes, the payns, and perils past:   
- His charge enioynd perfourmeth hee, attaind exceeding prayse:   
- His name, and fame so fully spred, it dures for afterdayes.   
- But lo, a feruent feeuer doth, amid his triumphs, fall:   
- And, with hertgripyng greef, consumes his tender lyms and all.   
- O rufull youth, thy helth too far forgot, and too much heed   
- To countrie, and too parent yeuen: why makest thou such speed?   
- O, staye your self: your country so to serue dothe right require,   
- That often serue you may: and then, at length, succeed your sire.   
- But thee perchaunce it likes, thy life the price of praise to paye:   
- Nor deth doest dreed, where honor shines, as bright, as sonny day.   
- Certesse no greater glory could, than this, to thee betide:   
- Though Ioue, six hundred yeres, had made thy fatall thread abide   
- Of iourneys, and of trauails huge the cause thy country was:   
- Thy funerall to honour, forth great Cesars court gan passe.   
- And thus, O thus (good lord) this ymp, of heue[n] most worthy wight   
- His happy life with blisfull death concluded hath aright:   
- When, in fourt yere quene Maries raign proceeded: & what day,   
- Was last of Iulie moneth, the same his last took him awaye.   
- From yeres twise ten if you in count wil but one yere abate:   
- The very age then shall you finde of lord Mautrauers fate.   
- Likewise, was Titus Cesar hence withdrawn, in his prime yeres:   
- Likewise, the yong prince Edward went: and diuers other peres.   
- Father, forbear thy wofull tears, cease, England, too lament:   
- Fates fauour none, the enmie death to all alike is bent.   
- The onely mean, that now remains, with eloquence full fine,   
- Hath Shelley vsed, in setting forth this barons name diuine.   
- Your Haddon eke, who erst in your life time, bore you good hart,   
- Presenteth you this monument, of woonted zeal some part.   
- And now farewell: of English youth most chosen gem, farewell:   
- A worthyer wight, saue Edward, did in England neuer dwell.       
    
## Mee thought, of late

  Vpon the sayd lord Mautrauers death.   

  - Mee thought, of late when lord Mautrauers dyed,   
- Our common weal, thus, by her self shee cryed:   
- Oft haue I wept for mine, so layd a sleep,   
- Yet neuer had I iuster cause to weep.   
    
## Now clattering arms

  The death of Zoroas, an Egiptian Astronomer, in the first fight,   that Alexander had with the Persians.   

  - Now clattering arms, now ragyng broyls of warr   
- Gan passe the noyes of taratantars clang:   
- Shrowded with shafts, the heuen: with clowd of darts,   
- Couered, the ayre: against fulfatted bulls,   
- As forceth kindled ire the Lions keen:   
- Whose greedy gutts the gnawing hoonger pricks:   
- So Macedoins against the Persians fare.   
- Now corpses hide the purpurde soyl with blood:   
- Large slaughter, on ech side: but Perses more   
- Moyst feelds bebledd: their herts, and noombers bate.   
- Fainted while they giue back, and fall to flight:   
- The lightning Macedon, by swoords, by gleaus,   
- By bands, and trowps, of fotemen with his garde,   
- Speeds to Darie: but him, his nearest kyn,   
- Oxate preserues, with horsemen on a plump   
- Before his cart: that none the charge could giue.   
- Here grunts, here grones, echwhere strong youth is spent:   
- Shaking her bloody hands, Bellone, among   
- The Perses, soweth all kindes of cruel death.   
- With throte ycutt, hee roores: hee lyeth along,   
- His entrails with a launce through girded quite:   
- Him down the club, him beats farstryking bowe,   
- And him the slyng, and him the shinand swoord:   
- Hee dieth, hee is all dedd, hee pants, hee rests.   
- Right ouer stood, in snowwhite armour braue,       
- The Memphite Zoroas, a cooning clerk:   
- To whom the heauen lay open, as his book:   
- And in celestiall bodyes hee could tell   
- The moouyng, meetyng, light, aspect, eclyps,   
- And influence, and constellations all:   
- What earthly chaunces wold betide: what yere   
- Of plenty storde, what signe forwarned derth:   
- How winter gendreth snow: what temperature   
- In the primetide dothe season well the soyl:   
- Why soomer burns: why autum hath ripe grapes:   
- Whether the circle, quadrate may becoom:   
- Whether our tunes heauens harmony can yeeld:   
- Of fowr begynns, among them selues how great   
- Proportion is: what swaye the erring lightes   
- Dothe send in course gayn that first moouing heauen:   
- What grees, one from an other distant bee:   
- What sterr dothe lett the hurtfull fire to rage,   
- Or him more mylde what opposition makes:   
- What fire dothe qualifie Mauorses fire:   
- What house echone doth seek: what planet raigns   
- Within this hemisphere, or that: small things   
- I speak: holl heauen hee closeth in his brest.   
- This sage then, in the starrs had spied: the fates   
- Threatned him death, without delaye: and sithe   
- Hee saw, hee could not fatall order change:   
- Forward hee preast, in battayl that hee might   
- Meet with the ruler of the Macedoins:   
- Of his right hand desirous to be slayn,   
- The boldest beurn, and worthiest in the feeld:   
- And, as a wight now weary of his life,   
- And seeking death: in first front of his rage,   
- Cooms desperatly to Alisanders face:   
- At him, with darts, one after other, throwes:   
- With reckles woords, and clamour him prouokes:   
- And sayth, Nectanabs bastard, shameful stain   
- Of mothers bed: why losest thou thy strokes,   
- Cowards emong? Turn thee to mee, in case   
- Manhod ther bee so much left in thy hert:   
- Coom fight with mee: that on my helmet wear   
- Apolloes laurel, bothe for learnings laude,   
- And eke for Martiall prayse: that, in my shield,   
- The seuenfold sophie of Minerue contein:       
- A match, more meet, sir king, than any here.   
- The noble prince amoued, takes ruthe vpon   
- The wilfull wight: and, with soft woords, ayen,   
- O monstrous man (quod he) whatso thou art   
- I praye thee, lyue: ne do not, with thy death,   
- This lodge of lore, the Muses mansion marr.   
- That treasure house this hand shall neuer spoyl:   
- My swoord shall neuer bruze that skylfull brayn,   
- Longgatherd heapes of science soon to spyll.   
- O, how faire frutes may you to mortall men   
- From wisdoms garden, giue? How many may,   
- By you, the wyser, and the better proue?   
- What error, what mad moode, what phrenzey thee   
- Persuades to bee downsent to deep Auern:   
- Where no artes florish, nor no knowledge vails?   
- For all these sawes, when thus the souerain sayde,   
- Alighted Zoroas: with swoord vnsheathed,   
- The carelesse king there smote, aboue the greaue,   
- At thopening of his quishes: wounded him   
- So, that the blood down reyled on the ground   
- The Macedon, perceyuing hurt, gan gnash:   
- But yet his minde he bent, in any wyse,   
- Hym to forbear: set spurrs vnto his steed,   
- And turnd away: leste anger of the smart   
- Should cause reuenger hand deal balefull blowes.   
- But of the Macedonian chieftanes knights   
- One, Meleager, could not bear this sight:   
- But ran vpon the sayd Egyptian renk:   
- And cut him in both kneez: hee fell to ground:   
- Wherwith a hole route came of souldiours stern,   
- And all in peeces hewed the silly seg.   
- But happyly the soll fled to the sterres:   
- Where, vnder him, he hath full sight of all,   
- Wherat hee gazed here, with reaching looke.   
- The Persians wayld such sapience to forgo:   
- The very fone, the Macedonians wisht,   
- Hee wold haue lyued: kyng Alisander self   
- Deemd him a man, vnmeet to dye at all:   
- Who woon lyke prayse, for conquest of his ire,   
- As for stout men in feeld that daye subdeewd:   
- Who princes taught, how to discern a man,       
- That in his hed so rare a iewell beares.   
- But ouer all, those same Camenes, those same   
- Diuine Camenes, whose honour he procurde,   
- As tender parent dothe his daughters weal:   
- Lamented: aud,[^]: and

 for thanks, all that they can,   
- Do cherish him deceast, and set hym free   
- From derk obliuion of deuouryng death.   
    
## Therfore, when restlesse rage

  Marcus Tullius Ciceroes death.   

  - Therfore, when restlesse rage of wynde, and waue   
- Hee saw: By fates, alas calld for (quod hee)   
- Is haplesse Cicero: sayl on, shape course   
- To the next shore, and bryng me to my death.   
- Perdie these thanks, reskued from ciuil swoord,   
- Wilt thou, my countrey, paye? I see mine end:   
- So powrs diuine, so bid the gods aboue,   
- In citie saued that Consul Marcus shend.   
- Speakyng nomore,[^]: no more

 but drawyng from deep hert   
- Great grones, euen at the name of Room reherst:   
- His yies, and cheeks, with showrs of teares, hee washt.   
- And (though a route in dayly daungers worn)   
- With forced face, the shipmen held theyr teares:   
- And, striuyng long the seas rough floods to passe,   
- In angry wyndes, and stormy stowrs made waye:   
- And at the last, safe anchord in the rode.   
- Came heauy Cicero a land: with payn,   
- His faynted lyms the aged sire dothe draw:   
- And, round about their master, stood his band:   
- Nor greatly with theyr own hard hap dismayd,   
- Nor plighted fayth, prone in sharp time to break:   
- Soom swoords prepare: soom theyr deare lord assist:   
- In littour layd, they lead hym vnkouth wayes:   
- If so deceaue Antonius cruell gleaus   
- They might, and threats of folowing routs escape.   
- Thus lo, that Tullie, went, that Tullius,   
- Of royall robe, and sacred Senate prince:   
- When hee afar the men approche espyeth,   
- And of his fone the ensignes dothe aknow:   
- And, with drawn swoord, Popilius threatnyng death:   
- Whose life, and holl estate, in hazard once,       
- Hee had preserud: when Room as yet to free   
- Herd hym, and at his thundryng voyce amazde.   
- Herennius eek, more eyger than the rest,   
- Present enflamde with furie, him purseews.   
- What might hee doo? Should hee vse in defense   
- Disarmed hands? or pardon ask, for meed?   
- Should hee with woords attempt to turn the wrath   
- Of tharmed knyght, whose safegard hee had wrought?   
- No, age, forbids, and fixt within deep brest   
- His countreys loue, and falling Rooms image.   
- The charret turn, sayth hee, let loose the rayns:   
- Roon to the vndeserued death: mee, lo,   
- Hath Phebus fowl, as messanger, forwarnd:   
- And Ioue desires a neew heauensman to make.   
- Brutus, and Cassius soulls, liue you in blisse:   
- In case yet all the fates gaynstriue vs not,   
- Neyther shall wee perchaunce dye vnreuenged.   
- Now haue I liued, O Room, ynough for mee:   
- My passed lyfe nought suffreth mee to dout   
- Noysom obliuion of the lothesom death.   
- Slea mee: yet all thofspring to coom shall know:   
- And this deceas shall bring eternall lyfe.   
- Yea and (onlesse I fayl, and all in vain   
- Room, I soomtyme thy Augur chosen was)   
- Not euermore shall frendly fortune thee   
- Fauour, Antonius: once the day shall coom:   
- When her deare wights, by cruell spight, thus slayn,   
- Victorious Room shall at thy hands require.   
- Mee likes, therwhyle, go see the hoped heauen.   
- Speech had he left: and therwith hee, good man,   
- His throte preparde, and held his hed vnmoued.   
- His hastyng too those fates the very knights   
- Be lothe to see: and, rage rebated, when   
- They his bare neck beheld, and his hore heyres:   
- Scant could they hold the teares, that forth gan burst:   
- And almost fell from bloody hands the swoords.   
- Onely the stern Herennius, with grym look,   
- Dastards, why stand you styll? he sayth: and streight,   
- Swaps of the hed, with his presumptuous yron.   
- Ne with that slaughter yet is hee not fild:   
- Fowl shame on shame to heap is his delyte.   
- Wherfore the hands also doth hee of smyte,       
- Which durst Antonius life so liuely paynt.   
- Him, yeldyng strayned goste, from welkin hye,   
- With lothly chere, lord Phebus gan behold:   
- And in black clowd, they saye, long hid his hed.   
- The latine Muses, and the Grayes, they wept:   
- And, for his fall, eternally shall weep.   
- And lo, hertpersyng Pitho (straunge to tell)   
- Who had to him suffisde bothe sense, and woords,   
- When so he spake: and drest, with nectar soote,   
- That flowyng toung: when his wyndpype disclosde,   
- Fled with her fleeyng frend: and (out alas)   
- Hath left the erth, ne wil nomore[^]: no more

 return.   
- Popilius flyeth, therwhyle: and, leauyng there   
- The senslesse stock, a gryzely sight doth bear   
- Vnto Antonius boord, with mischief fed.   
    
## For Tullie

  Of M. T. Cicero.   

  - For Tullie, late, a toomb I gan prepare:   
- When Cynthie, thus, bad mee my labour spare:   
- Such maner things becoom the ded, quoth hee:   
- But Tullie liues, and styll alyue shall bee.

## If euer wofull man

  The complaint of a louer with sute to his loue for pitye.   

  - If euer wofull man might moue your hartes to ruthe,   
- Good ladies here his woful plaint, whose deth shal try his truth   
-   And rightfull iudges be on this his true report:   
- If he deserue a louers name among the faithfull sort.   
-   Fiue hundred times the sonne hath lodged him in the West:   
- Since in my hart I harbred first of all the goodlyest gest.   
-   Whose worthinesse to shew my wittes are all to faint.   
- And I lack cunnyng of the scoles, in colours her to paynt.   
-   But this I briefly say in wordes of egall weight.   
- So void of vice was neuer none, nor with such vertues freyght.   
-   And for her beauties prayse, no wight, that with her warres.   
- For, where she comes, she shewes her self as sonne amo[n]g [the] starres.   
-   But Lord, thou wast to blame, to frame such parfitenesse:   
- And puttes no pitie in her hart, my sorowes to redresse.   
-   For yf ye knew the paynes, and panges, that I haue past:   
- A wonder would it be to you, how that my life hath last.   
-   When all the Goddes agreed, that Cupide with his bow   
- Should shote his arrowes fro[m] her eies, on me his might to show   
-   I knew it was in vain my force to trust vpon:   
- And well I wist, it was no shame, to yelde to such a one.   
-   Then did I me submit with humble hart, and minde,   
- To be her man for euermore: as by the Goddes assinde.   
-   And since that day, no wo, wherwith loue might torment,   
- Could moue me fro[m] this faithfull band: or make me once repent.   
-   Yet haue I felt full oft the hottest of his fire:   
- The bitter teares, the scalding sighes, the burning hote desyre.   
-   And with a sodain sight the trembling of the hart:   
- And how the blood doth come, and go, to succour euery part.   
-   When that a pleasant loke hath lift me in the ayer:   
- A frowne hath made me fall as fast into a depe despayer.   
-   And when that I, er this, my tale could well by hart:   
- And that my tong had learned it, so that no worde might start:   
-   The sight of her hath set my wittes in such a stay:   
- That to be lord of all the world, one word I could not say.   
-   And many a sodayn cramp my hart hath pinched so:       
- That for the time, my senses all felt neither weale, nor wo.   
-   Yet saw I neuer thing, that might my minde content:   
- But wisht it hers, and at her will, if she could so consent.   
-   Nor neuer heard of wo: that did her will displease:   
- But wisht the same vnto my self, so it might do her ease.   
-   Nor neuer thought that fayre, nor neuer liked face:   
- Vnlesse it did resemble her, or some part of her grace.   
-   No distance yet of place could vs so farre deuide:   
- But that my hert, and my good will did still with her abide.   
-   Nor yet it neuer lay in any fortunes powre,   
- To put that swete out of my thought, one minute of an howre.   
-   No rage of drenching sea, nor woodenesse of the winde,   
- Nor canno[n]s w[ith] their thundryng cracks could put her fro[m] my minde   
-   For when bothe sea and land asunder had vs set:   
- My hole delite was onely then, my self alone to get.   
-   And thitherward to loke, as nere as I could gesse:   
- Where as I thought, that shee was then, [that] might my wo redresse.   
-   Full oft it did me good, that waies to take my winde:   
- So pleasant ayre in no place els, me thought I could not finde.   
-   I saying to my self, my life is yonder waye:   
- And by the winde I haue here sent, a thousand sighes a daye.   
-   And sayd vnto the sunne, great gifts are geuen thee:   
- For thou mayst see mine earthly blisse, where euer that she bee.   
-   Thou seest in euery place, wold God I had thy might:   
- And I the ruler of my self, then should she know no night.   
-   And thus from wish to wishe my wits haue been at strife:   
- And wantyng all that I haue wisht, thus haue I led my life.   
-   But long it can not last, that in such wo remaines.   
- No force for that: for death is swete to him, that feles such paines.   
-   Yet most of all me greues: when I am in my graue,   
- That she shall purchase by my death a cruell name to haue.   
-   Wherfore all you that heare this plaint, or shall it see:   
- Wish, that it may so perce her hert, that she may pitie mee.   
-   For and it were her will: for bothe it were the best,   
- To saue my life, to kepe her name, and set my hert at rest.   
    
## Who iustly may reioyce

  Of the death of master Deuerox the lord Ferres sonne.       

  - Who iustly may reioyce in ought vnder the skye?   
- As life, or lands: as frends, or frutes: which only liue to dye.   
- Or who dothe not well know all worldly works are vaine?   
- And geueth nought but to the lendes, to take the same againe.   
- For though it lift some vp: as wee long vpward all:   
- Such is the sort of slipper welth: all things do rise to fall.   
- Thuncertentie is such: experience teacheth so:   
- That what things men do couet most, them sonest they forgo.   
- Lo Deuorox where he lieth: whose life men heeld so deare   
- That now his death is sorowed so, that pitie it is to heare.   
- His birth of auncient blood: his parents of great fame:   
- And yet in vertue farre before the formost of the same.   
- His king, and countrye bothe he serued to so great gaine:   
- That with the Brutes record doth rest, and euer shall remaine.   
- No man in warre so mete, an enterprise to take:   
- No man in peace that pleasurd more of enmies frends to make.   
- A Cato for his counsell: his head was surely such.   
- Ne Theseus frenship was so great, but Deuorox was as much.   
- A graffe of so small grothe so much good frute to bring:   
- Is seldome heard, or neuer sene: it is so rare a thing.   
- A man sent vs from God, his life did well declare:   
- And now sent for by god again, to teach vs what we are.   
- Death, and the graue, that shall accompany all that liue,   
- Hath brought hi[m] heue[n], though so[m]ewhat sone, which life could neuer geue[^]: 1 from following line

  
- God graunt well all, that shall professe as he profest:   
- To liue so well, to dye no worse: and send his soule good rest.   
    
## If right be rackt

  They of the meane estate are happiest.   

  - If right be rackt, and ouerronne:   
- And power take part with open wrong:   
- If fear by force do yelde to soone,   
- The lack is like to last to long.   
-   If God for goodes shalbe vnplaced:   
- If right for riches lose his shape:   
- If world for wisdome be embraced:   
- The gesse is great, much hurt may happe.   
-   Among good things, I proue and finde,   
- The quiet life dothe most abound:       
- And sure to the contented minde   
- There is no riches may be found.   
-   For riches hates to be content:   
- Rule is enmy to quietnesse.   
- Power is most part impacient:   
- And seldom likes to liue in pease.   
-   I hard a herdman once compare:   
- That quiet nightes he had mo slept:   
- And had mo mery daies to spare:   
- Then he, which ought the beastes, he kept.   
-   I would not haue it thought hereby   
- The dolphin swimme I meane to teach:   
- Nor yet to learne the Fawcon flie:   
- I rowe not so farre past my reache.   
-   But as my part aboue the rest,   
- Is well to wish and well to will:   
- So till my breath shall fail my brest,   
- I will not ceasse to wish you styll.   
    
## The lyfe is long

  Comparison of lyfe and death.   

  - The lyfe is long, that lothsumly doth last:   
- The dolefull dayes draw slowly to theyr date:   
- The present panges, and paynfull plages forepast   
- Yelde griefe aye grene to stablish this estate.   
- So that I fele, in this great storme, and strife,   
- The death is swete that endeth such a life.   
-   Yet by the stroke of this strange ouerthrow,   
- At which conflict in thraldom I was thrust:   
- The Lord be praysed: I am well taught to know,   
- From whence man came, and eke whereto he must:   
- And by the way vpon how feble force   
- His term doth stand, till death doth end his course.   
-   The pleasant yeres that seme, so swifte that runne:   
- The mery dayes to end, so fast that flete:   
- The ioyfull nightes, of which day daweth so soone:   
- The happy howers, which mo do misse, then mete,   
- Doe all consume: as snow against the sunne:   
- And death wakes[^]: makes

 end of all, that life begunne.       
-   Since death shall dure, tyll all the world be wast.   
- What meaneth man to drede death then so sore?   
- As man might make, that life should alway last.   
- Without regard, the lord hath led before   
- The daunce of death, which all must runne on row:   
- Though how, or when, the lord alone doth know.   
-   If man would minde, what burdens life doth bring:   
- What greuous crimes to god he doth commit:   
- What plages, what panges, what perilles therby spring:   
- With no sure hower in all his dayes to sit:   
- He would sure think, as with great cause I do:   
- The day of death were better of the two.   
-   Death is a port, wherby we passe to ioy,   
- Life is a lake, that drowneth all in pain.   
- Death is so dere, it ceaseth all annoy.   
- Life is so leude, that all it yeldes is vayn.   
- And as by life to bondage man is braught:   
- Euen so likewise by death was fredome wraught.   
-   Wherfore with Paul let all men wish, and pray   
- To be dissolude of this foule fleshy masse:   
- Or at the least be armed against the day:   
- That they be found good souldiers, prest to passe   
- From life to death: from death to life agayn   
- To such a life, as euer shall remain.   
    
## In Grece somtime

  The tale of Pigmalion with conclusion vpon the beautye of his loue.   

  - In Grece somtime there dwelt a man of worthy fame:   
- To graue in stone his connyng was: Pygmalio[n] was his name.   
-   To make his fame endure, when death had him bereft:   
- He thought it good, of his owne hand some filed work were left.   
-   In secrete studie then such work he gan deuise,   
- As might his conning best commend, and please the lokers eyes.   
-   A courser faire he thought to graue, barbd for the field:   
- And on his back a semely knight, well armd with speare & shield:   
-   Orels[^]: Or els

 some foule, or fish to graue he did deuise:   
- And still, within his wandering thoughtes, new fansies did aryse.       
-   Thus varyed he in mynde, what enterprise to take:   
- Till fansy moued his learned hand a woman fayre to make.   
-   Whereon he stayde, and thought such parfite fourm to frame:   
- Whereby he might amaze all Greece, and winne immortall name.   
-   Of Yuorie white he made so faire a woman than:   
- That nature scornd her perfitnesse so taught by craft of man.   
-   Welshaped were her lyms, full cumly was her face:   
- Eche litle vayn most liuely coucht, eche part had semely grace.   
-   Twixt nature, & Pygmalion, there might appeare great stryfe.   
- So semely was this ymage wrought, it lackt nothyng but life.   
-   His curious eye beheld his own deuised work:   
- And, gasyng oft thereon, he found much venome there to lurke.   
-   For all the featurde shape so dyd his fansie moue:   
- That, with his idoll, whom he made, Pygmalion fell in loue.   
-   To whom he honour gaue, and deckt with garlandes swete,   
- And did adourn with iewels riche, as is for louers mete.   
-   Somtimes on it he fawnd: some time in rage would crye:   
- It was a wonder to beholde, how fansy bleard his eye.   
-   Since that this ymage dum enflamde so wyse a man:   
- My dere, alas since I you loue, what wonder is it than?   
-   In whom hath nature set the glory of her name:   
- And brake her mould, in great dispayre, your like she could not frame.[^]: 1 from previous line

  
    
## Lyke as the lark

  The louer sheweth his wofull state, and prayeth pitye.   

  - Lyke as the lark within the marlians foote   
- With piteous tunes doth chirp her yelden lay:   
- So syng I now, seyng none other boote,   
- My renderyng song, and to your wyll obey.   
- Your vertue mountes aboue my force so hye.   
- And with your beautie seased I am so sure:   
- That there auails resistance none in me,   
- But paciently your pleasure to endure   
- For on your wyll my fansy shall attend:   
- My lyfe, my death, I put both in your choyce:   
- And rather had this lyfe by you to end,   
- Than lyue, by other alwayes to reioyce.   
- And if your crueltie doe thirst my blood:   
- Then let it forth, if it may doe you good.       
    
## The lenger lyfe

  Vpon consideracion of the stat[^]: stat[e of]

  this lyfe he wisheth death.   

  - The lenger lyfe, the more offence:   
- The more offence, the greater payn:   
- The greater payn, the lesse defence:   
- The lesse defence, the lesser gayn.   
- The losse of gayn long yll doth trye:   
- Wherefore come death, and let me dye.   
-   The shorter life, lesse count I fynde:   
- The lesse account, th e[^]: the

 sooner made:   
- The count soon made, the mercer minde:   
- The mery minde doth thought euade.   
- Short lyfe in truth this thing doth trye:   
- Wherefore come death, and let me dye:   
-   Come gentle death, the ebbe of care,   
- The ebbe of care, the flood of lyfe,   
- The flood of lyfe, the ioyfull fare,   
- The ioyfull fare, the end of strife.   
- The end of strife, that thing wishe I:   
- Wherefore come death, and let me dye.   
    
## To this my song

  The louer that once disdained loue is now become subiect beyng   caught in his snare.   

  - To this my song geue eare, who list:   
- And mine intent iudge, as you wyll:   
- The tyme is cume, that I haue mist,   
- The thyng, wheron I hoped styll,   
- And from the top of all my trust,   
- Myshap hath throwen me in the dust.   
- The time hath been, and that of late:   
- My hart and I might leape at large.   
- And was not shut within the gate   
- Of loues desyre: nor toke no charge   
- Of any thyng, that dyd pertain       
- As touching loue in any payn.   
-   My thought was free, my hart was light:   
- I marked not, who lost, who saught.   
- I playde by day, I slept by night.   
- I forced not, who wept, who laught.   
- My thought from all such thinges was free:   
- And I my self at libertee.   
-   I toke no hede to tanntes,[^]: tauntes

 nor toyes:   
- As leefe to see them frowne as smile:   
- Where fortune laught I scorned their ioyes:   
- I found their fraudes and euery wile.   
- And to my self oft times I smiled:   
- To see, how loue had them begiled.   
-   Thus in the net of my conceit   
- I masked styll among the sort   
- Of such as fed vpon the bayt,   
- That Cupide laide for his disport.   
- Aud[^]: And

 euer as I saw them caught:   
- I them beheld, and therat laught.   
-   Till at the length when Cupide spied   
- My scornefull will and spitefull vse   
- And how I past not who was tied.   
- So that my self might still liue lose:   
- He set himself to lye in wait:   
- And in my way he threw a bait.   
-   Such one, as nature neuer made,   
- I dare well say saue she alone.   
- Such one she was as would inuade   
- A hart, more hard then marble stone.   
- Such one she is, I know, it right,   
- Her nature made to shew her might.   
-   Then as a man euen in a maze,   
- When vse of reason is away:   
- So I began to stare, and gaze.   
- And sodeinly, without delay,   
- Or euer I had the wit to loke:   
- I swalowed vp both bayt, and hoke.   
-   Which daily greues me more and more   
- By sondry sortes of carefull wo:   
- And none aliue may salue the sore,   
- But onely she, that hurt me so.   
- In whom my life doth now consist,       
- To saue or slay me as she list.   
-   But seing now that I am caught,   
- And bounde so fast, I cannot flee:   
- Be ye by mine ensample taught,   
- That in your fansies fele you free.   
- Despise not them, that louers are:   
- Lest you be caught within his snare.   
    
## The plage is great

  Of Fortune, and Fame.   

  - The plage is great, where fortune frownes:   
- One mischief bringes a thousand woes   
- Where trumpets geue their warlike sownes:   
- The weake sustain sharp ouerthrowes.   
- No better life they taste, and fele:   
- That subiect are to fortunes whele.   
-   Her happy chance may last no time:   
- Her pleasure threatneth paines to come.   
- She is the fall of those, that clime:   
- And yet her whele auanceth some.   
- No force, where that she hates, or loues:   
- Her ficle minde so oft remoues.   
-   She geues no gift, but craues as fast.   
- She soone repentes a thankful dede.   
- She turneth after euery blast.   
- She helpes them oft, that haue no nede.   
- Where power dwelles, and riches rest:   
- False fortune is a common gest,   
-   Yet some affirm, and proue by skyll:   
- Fortune is not as fleyng Fame,   
- She neither can do good, nor yll.   
- She hath no fourme, yet beares a name.   
- Then we but striue agaynst the streames,   
- To frame such toyes on fansies dreames.   
-   If she haue shape, or name alone:   
- If she do rule, or beare no sway:   
- If she haue bodie, lief, or none:   
- Be she a sprite I cannot say.   
- But well I wot, some cause there is:   
- That causeth wo, and sendeth blisse.   
-   The cause of thinges I will not blame:       
- Lest I offend the prince of peas.   
- But I may chide, and braule with Fame:   
- To make her crye, and neuer cease.   
- To blow the trump within her eares:   
- That may apease my wofull teares.   
    
## O euyll tonges

  Against wicked tonges.   

  - O Euyll tonges, which clap at euery winde:   
- Ye slea the quick, and eke the dead defame:   
- Those that liue well, som faute in them ye fynde.   
- Ye take no thought, in slaundring theyr good name.   
- Ye put iust men oft times to open shame.   
- Ye ryng so loude, ye sound vnto the skyes:   
- And yet in proofe ye sowe nothyng, but lyes.   
- Ye make great warre, where peace hath been of long,   
- Ye bring rich realmes to ruine, and decay.   
- Ye pluck down right: ye doe enhaunce the wrong.   
- Ye turne swete myrth to wo, and welaway   
- Of mischiefes all ye are the grounde, I say.   
- Happy is he, that liues on such a sort:   
- That nedes not feare such tonges of false report.   
    
## To walke on doubtfull ground

  Not to trust to much but beware by others calamaties.   

  - To walke on doubtfull ground, where danger is vnseen   
- Doth double men that carelesse be in depe dispaire I wene,   
- For as the blynde dothe feare, what footing he shall fynde:   
- So doth the wise before he speak, mistrust the strangers mynde.   
- For he that blontly runnes, may light among the breers,   
- And so be put vnto his plunge where danger least apperes:   
- The bird that selly foole, doth warn vs to beware,   
- Who lighteth not on euery bushe, he dreadeth so the snare.   
- The mouse that shonnes the trap, doth shew what harme doth ly:   
- Within the swete betraying bait, that oft disceiues the eye.   
- The fish auoides the hoke, though hunger byds him bite,   
- And houereth still about the worme, whereon is his delyte.   
- Yf birdes and beastes can see, where their vndoyng lies:       
- How should a mischief scape our heades, [that] haue both wit and eyes.   
- What madnesse may be more, then plow the barreyn field:   
- Or any frutefull wordes to sow, to eares that are vnwyld.   
- They here and than mislyke, they like and than they lothe,   
- Thei hate, thei loue, thei skorn, thei praise, yea sure thei ca[n] do both   
- We see what falles they haue, that clyme on trees vnknowne:   
- As they that truste to rotten bowes, must nedes be ouerthrowne.   
- A smart in silence kept, doth ease the hart much more,   
- Than for to plain where is no salue, for to recure the sore.   
- Wherfore my grief I hide, within a holow hart:   
- Vntill the smoke thereof be spied, by flaming of the smart.   
    
## The restlesse rage

  Hell tormenteth not the damned ghostes so sore as vnkindnesse the louer.   

  - The restlesse rage of depe deuouryng hell,   
- The blasing brandes, that neuer do consume,   
- The roryng route, in Plutoes den that dwell:   
- The fiery breath, that from those ymps doth fume:   
- The dropsy dryeth, that Tantale in the flood   
- Endureth aye, all hopelesse of relief:   
- He hongersteruen, where frute is ready food:   
- So wretchedly his soule doth suffer grief:   
- The liuer gnawne of gylefull Promethus,   
- Which Vultures fell with strayned talant tyre:   
- The labour lost of wearyed Sisiphus:   
- These hellish houndes, with paines of quenchlesse fyre,   
- Can not so sore the silly soules torment,   
- As her vntruth my hart hath alltorent.   
    
## By fortune as I lay in bed

  Of the mutabilitie of the world.   

  - By fortune as I lay in bed, my fortune was to fynde   
- Such fa[n]sies, as my carefull thought had brought into my minde   
- And when eche one was gone to rest, full soft in bed to lye:   
- I would haue slept: but then the watch did folow still myne eye.   
- And sodeinly I saw a sea of wofull sorowes prest:       
- Whose wicked wayes of sharp repulse bred mine vnquiet rest.   
- I saw this world: and how it went, eche state in his degree:   
- And that from wealth ygraunted is, both lyfe, and libertee.   
- I saw, how enuy it did rayne, and beare the greatest price:   
- Yet greater poyson is not found within the Cockatrice.   
- I saw also, how that disdayn oft times to forge my wo,   
- Gaue me the cup of bitter swete, to pledge my mortall fo.   
- I saw also, how that desire to rest no place could finde   
- But styll constrainde in endlesse pain to folow natures kynde.   
- I saw also most strauuge[^]: straunge

 of all how nature did forsake   
- The blood, that in her womb was wrought: as doth [the] lothed snake   
- I saw, how fansy would retayn no lenger then her lust:   
- And as the winde how she doth change: and is not for to trust.   
- I saw, how stedfastnesse did fly with winges of often change:   
- A fleyng birde, but seldom seen, her nature is so strange.   
- I saw, how pleasant times did passe, as flowers doe in the mede:   
- To day that ryseth red as rose: to morow falleth ded.   
- I saw, my tyme how it did runne, as sand out of the glasse.   
- Euen as eche hower appointed is from tyme, and tyde to passe.   
- I saw the yeares, that I had spent, and losse of all my gayn:   
- And how the sport of youthfull playes my foly dyd retayn.   
- I saw, how that the litle ant in somer still dothe runne   
- To seke her foode, wherby to liue in winter for to come.   
- I saw eke vertue, how she sat the threde of life to spinne.   
- Which sheweth the end of euery work, before it doth beginne.   
- And when all these I thus beheld with many mo pardy:   
- In me, me thought, eche one had wrought a parfite proparty.   
- And then I said vnto my self: a lesson this shalbe   
- For other: that shall after come, for to beware by me.   
- Thus, all the night I did deuise, which way I might constrayn.   
- To fourme a plot, that wit might work these branches in my brain.   
     
## Phylida was a fayer mayde

  Harpelus complaynt of Phillidaes loue bestowed on Corin, who   loued her not and denied him, that loued her.   

  - Phylida was a fayer mayde,   
- And fresh as any flowre:      
- Whom Harpalus the herdman prayed   
- To be his paramour.   
-   Harpalus and eke Corin   
- Were herdmen both yfere:   
- And Phillida could twist and spin   
- And therto sing full clere.   
-   But Phillida was all to coy   
- For Harpelus to winne.   
- For Corin was her onely ioye,   
- Who forst her not a pynne.   
-   How often would she flowers twine   
- How often garlandes make:   
- Of Couslippes and of Colombine,   
- And all for Corins sake.   
-   But Corin he had haukes to lure   
- And forced more the field:   
- Of louers lawe he toke no cure   
- For once he was begilde.   
-   Harpalus preualed nought   
- His labour all was lost:   
- For he was fardest from her thought   
- And yet he loued her most.   
-   Therfore waxt he both pale and leane   
- And drye as clot of clay:   
- His fleshe it was consumed cleane   
- His colour gone away.   
-   His beard it had not long be shaue,   
- His heare hong all vnkempt:   
- A man most fitte euen for the graue   
- Whom spitefull loue had spent.   
-   His eyes were red and all forewatched   
- His face besprent with teares:   
- It semde vnhap had him long hatched.   
- In middes of his dispayres.   
-   His clothes were blacke and also bare   
- As one forlorne was he:   
- Vpon his heade alwaies he ware,   
- A wreath of wilow tree.   
-   His beastes he kept vpon the hyll,   
- And he sate in the dale:   
- And thus with sighes and sorowes shryll,   
- He gan to tell his tale.       
-   O Harpelus thus would he say,   
- Vnhappiest vnder sunne:   
- The cause of thine vnhappy day   
- By loue was first begone.   
-   For thou wentest first by sute to seeke   
- A Tygre to make tame:   
- That sets not by thy loue a leke   
- But makes thy grefe her game.   
-   As easye it were, for to conuert   
- The frost into the flame:   
- As for to turne a froward hert   
- Whom thou so fain wouldst frame.   
-   Corin he liueth carelesse   
- He leapes among the leaues:   
- He eates the frutes of thy redresse   
- Thou reapes he takes the sheaues.   
-   My beastes a while your fode refrayne   
- And herken your herdmans sounde:   
- Whom spitefull loue alas hath slaine   
- Throughgirt with many a wounde.   
-   Oh happy be ye beastes wilde   
- That here your pasture takes:   
- I se that ye be not begylde   
- Of these your faythfull face.   
-   The Hart he fedeth by the Hynde   
- The Bucke hard by the Doo,   
- The Turtle Doue is not vnkinde   
- To him that loues her so.   
-   The Ewe she hath by her the Ramme   
- The yong Cow hath the Bulle:   
- The calf with many a lusty lamme   
- Do feede their honger full.   
-   But wellaway that nature wrought   
- Thee Phillida so faire:   
- For I may say that I haue bought   
- Thy beauty all to deare.   
-   What reason is it that cruelty   
- With beauty should haue part,   
- Or els that such great tyranny   
- Should dwell in womans hart.   
-   I see therfore to shape my death   
- She cruelly is prest:       
- To thend that I may want my breathe   
- My dayes been at the best.   
-   O Cupide graunt this my request   
- And do not stoppe thine eares:   
- That she may fele within her brest   
- The paynes of my dispayres.   
-   Of Corin that is carelesse   
- That she may craue her fee:   
- As I haue done in great distresse   
- That loued her faythfully.   
-   But sins that I shall die her slaue   
- Her slaue and eke her thrall:   
- Write you my frendes, vpon my graue   
- This chance that is befall.   
-   Here lieth vnhappy Harpelus   
- Whom cruell loue hath slayne:   
- By Phillida vniustly thus   
- Murdred with false disdaine.   
    
## Lo here the end of man

- Though earthed be his corps, yet florish shall his fame,   
- A gladsome thing it is that er he step vs fro,   
- Such mirrours he vs left our life therby to frame,   
- Wherfore his praise shall last aye freshe in Brittons sight,   
- Till sunne shall cease to shine, and lende the earth his light.   
    
## Who list to liue vpright

  Of the wretchednes in this world.   

  - Who list to liue vpright, and holde him self content,   
- Shall se such wonders in this world, as neuer erst was sent.   
- Such gropyng for the swete, such tastyng of the sower   
- Such wandryng here for wordly welth that lost is in one houre.   
- And as the good or badde gette vp in hye degre,   
- So wades the world in right or wrong it may none other be.   
- And loke what lawes they make, ech man must them obay,   
- And yoke himself with pacient hart to driue and draw [the] way.   
- For such as long ago, great rulers were assinde   
- Both liues & lawes are now forgot & worne clene out of minde   
- So that by this I se, no state on earth may last   
- But as their times appointed be, to rise and fall as fast.   
- The goodes that gotten be, by good and iust desart,   
- Yet vse them so that neady handes may helpe to spend the part   
- For loke what heape thou hordst, of rusty golde in store,   
- Thine enemies shall waste the same, that neuer swat therfore.   
    
## Vnto the liuyng Lord

  The repentant sinner in durance and aduersitie.   

  - Vnto the liuyng Lord for pardon do I pray,   
- From who[m] I graunt euen fro[m] the shell, I haue run styl astray.   
- And other liues there none (my death shall well declare)   
- On whom I ought to grate for grace, as faulty folkes do fare.   
- But thee O Lorde alone, I haue offended so,   
- That this small scourge is much to scant for mine offence I know   
- I ranne without returne, the way the world liekt best   
- And what I ought most to regard, that I respected lest   
- The throng wherin I thrust, hath throwen me in such case       
- That Lorde my soule is sore beset without thy greater grace   
- My giltes are growen so great, my power doth so appayre   
- That with great force they argue oft, and mercy much dispayre.   
- But then with fayth I flee to thy prepared store   
- Where there lieth help for euery hurt, and salue for euery sore.   
- My loste time to lament, my vaine waies to bewaile,   
- No day no night no place no houre no moment I shal faile   
- My soule shall neuer cease with an assured faith   
- To knock, to craue, to call to cry to thee for helpe which sayth   
- Knocke and it shalbe heard, but aske and geuen it is   
- And all that like to kepe this course, of mercy shall not misse   
- For when I call to minde how the one wandryng shepe,   
- Did bring more ioye with his returne, then all the flocke did kepe.   
- It yeldes full hope and trust my strayed and wandryng ghost   
- Shalbe receiued and held more dere then those were neuer lost.   
- O Lord my hope beholde, and for my helpe make haste   
- To pardon the forpassed race that carelesse I haue past.   
- And but the day draw neare that death must pay the det,   
- For lone of life which thou hast lent and time of payment set.   
- From this sharpe shower me shilde which threatened is at hand,   
- Wherby thou shalt great power declare & I the storme withstand.   
- Not my will lord but thyne, fulfilde be in ech case,   
- To whose gret wil & mighty power al powers shal once geue place   
- My fayth my hope my trust, my God and eke my guide   
- Stretch forth thy hand to saue the soule, what so the body bide.   
- Refuse not to receiue that thou so dere hast bought,   
- For but by thee alone I know all safety in vaine is sought.   
- I know and knowledge eke albeit very late,   
- That thou it is I ought to loue and dreade in ech estate.   
- And with repentant hart do laude thee Lord on hye,   
- That hast so gently set me straight, that erst walkt so awry.   
- Now graunt me grace my God to stand thine strong in sprite,   
- And let [the] world the[n] work such wayes, as to the world semes mete.   
    
## Sythe singyng gladdeth

  The louer here telleth of his diuers ioyes and aduersities in loue   and lastly of his ladies death.   

  - Sythe singyng gladdeth oft the hartes   
- Of them that fele the panges of loue:       
- And for the while doth ease their smartes:   
- My self I shall the same way proue.   
-   And though that loue hath smit the stroke,   
- Wherby is lost my libertie:   
- Which by no meanes I may reuoke:   
- Yet shall I sing, how pleasantly.   
-   Ny twenty yeres of youth I past:   
- Which all in libertie I spent:   
- And so from fyrst vnto the last,   
- Er aught I knew, what louing ment.   
-   And after shall I syng the wo,   
- The payne, the greefe, the deadly smart:   
- When loue this lyfe did ouerthrowe,   
- That hydden lyes within my hart.   
-   And then, the ioyes, that I did feele.   
- When fortune lifted after this,   
- And set me hye vpon her whele:   
- And changed my wo to pleasant blisse,   
-   And so the sodeyn fall agayne   
- From all the ioyes, that I was in.   
- All you, that list to heare of payne,   
- Geue eare, for now I doe beginne.   
-   Lo, fyrst of all, when loue began   
- With hote desyres my heart to burne:   
- Me thought, his might auailde not than   
- From libertie my heart to turne.   
-   For I was free: and dyd not knowe,   
- How much his might mannes hert may greue.   
- I had profest to be his fo:   
- His law I thought not to beleue.   
-   I went vntyed in lusty leas,   
- I had my wish alwayes at will:   
- Ther was no wo, might me displease:   
- Of pleasant ioyes I had my fill.   
-   No paynfull thought dyd passe my hart:   
- I spilt no teare to wet my brest:   
- I knew no sorow, sigh, nor smart.   
- My greatest grefe was quyet rest.   
-   I brake no slepe, I tossed not:   
- Nor dyd delyte to syt alone.   
- I felt no change of colde, and hote:   
- Nor nought a nightes could make me mone.       
-   For all was ioy that I did fele:   
- And of voide wandering I was free.   
- I had no clogge tied at my hele:   
- This was my life at libertie.   
-   That yet me thinkes it is a blisse,   
- To thinke vpon that pleasure past.   
- But forthwithall I finde the misse,   
- For that it might no lenger last.   
-   Those dayes I spent at my desire,   
- Without wo or aduersitie:   
- Till that my hart was set a fire,   
- With loue, with wrath, and ielousie.   
-   For on a day (alas the while)   
- Lo, hear my harme how it began:   
- The blinded Lord, the God of guile   
- Had list to end my fredome than.   
-   And through mine eye into my hart,   
- All sodenly I felt it glide.   
- He shot his sharped fiery dart,   
- So hard, that yet vnder my side   
-   The head (alas) dothe still remaine,   
- And yet since could I neuer know,   
- The way to wring it out againe:   
- Yet was it nye three yere ago.   
-   This soden stroke made me agast:   
- And it began to vexe me sore.   
- But yet I thought, it would haue past,   
- As other such had done before.   
-   But it did not that (wo is me)   
- So depe imprinted in my thought,   
- The stroke abode: that yet I see,   
- Me thynkes my harme how it was wrought.   
-   Kinde taught me streight that this was loue   
- And I perceiued it perfectlye.   
- Yet thought I thus: Nought shall me moue:   
- I will not thrall my libertie.   
-   And diuers waies I did assay,   
- By flight, by force, by frend, by fo,   
- This fyrye thought to put away.   
- I was so lothe for to forgo   
-   My libertie: that me was leuer,   
- Then bondage was, where I heard saie:       
- Who once was bounde, was sure neuer   
- Without great paine to scape away.   
-   But what for that, there is no choyce,   
- For my mishap was shapen so:   
- That those my dayes that did reioyce,   
- Should turne my blisse to bitter wo.   
-   For with that stroke my blisse toke ende.   
- In stede wherof forthwith I caught,   
- Hotte burnyng sighes, that sins haue brend,   
- My wretched hart almost to naught.   
-   And sins that day, O Lord my life   
- The misery that it hath felt.   
- That nought hath had, but wo and strife,   
- And hotte desires my hart to melt.   
-   O Lord how sodain was the change   
- From such a pleasant liberty?   
- The very thraldome semed strange:   
- But yet there was no remedy.   
-   But I must yeld, and geue vp all,   
- And make my guide my chiest[^]: chiefest

 fo.   
- And in this wise became I thrall.   
- Lo loue and happe would haue it so.   
-   I suffred wrong and helde my peace,   
- I gaue my teares good leaue to ronne:   
- And neuer would seke for redresse,   
- But hopt to liue as I begonne.   
-   For what it was that might me ease,   
- He liued not that might it know.   
- Thus dranke I all mine owne disease:   
- And all alone bewailde my wo.   
-   There was no sight that might mee please,   
- I fled from them that did reioyce.   
- And oft alone my hart to ease,   
- I would bewayle with wofull voyce   
-   My life, my state, my miserie,   
- And curse my selfe and all my dayes.   
- Thus wrought I with my fantasie,   
- And sought my helpe none other waies.   
-   Saue sometime to my selfe alone,   
- When farre of was my helpe God wot:   
- Lowde would I cry: My life is gone,   
- My dere, if that ye helpe me not.       
-   Then wisht I streight, that death might end   
- These bitter panges, and all this grief.   
- For nought, methought, might it amend.   
- Thus in dispaire to haue relief,   
-   I lingred forth: tyll I was brought   
- With pining in so piteous case:   
- That all, that saw me, sayd, methought:   
- Lo, death is painted in his face.   
-   I went no where: but by the way   
- I saw some sight before mine eyes:   
- That made me sigh, and oft times say:   
- My life, alas I thee despyse.   
-   This lasted well a yere, and more:   
- Which no wight knew, but onely I:   
- So that my life was nere forlore:   
- And I dispaired vtterly.   
-   Tyll on a day, as fortune would:   
- (For that, that shalbe, nedes must fall)   
- I sat me down, as though I should   
- Haue ended then my lyfe, and all.   
-   And as I sat to wryte my plaint,   
- Meaning to shew my great vnrest:   
- With quaking hand, and hart full faint,   
- Amid my plaintes, among the rest,   
-   I wrote with ynk, and bitter teares:   
- I am not myne, I am not mine:   
- Behold my lyfe, away that weares:   
- And if I dye the losse is thyne.   
-   Herewith a litle hope I caught:   
- That for a whyle my life did stay.   
- But in effect, all was for naught.   
- Thus liued I styll: tyll on a day,   
-   As I sat staring on those eyes:   
- I meane, those eyes, that first me bound:   
- My inward thought tho cryed: Aryse:   
- Lo, mercy where it may be found.   
-   And therewithall I drew me nere:   
- With feble hart, and at a braide,   
- (But it was softly in her eare)   
- Mercy, Madame, was all, I sayd.   
-   But wo was me, when it was tolde.   
- For therewithall fainted my breath.       
- And I sate still for to beholde,   
- And heare the iudgement of my death.   
-   But loue nor Hap would not consent,   
- To end me then, but welaway:   
- There gaue me blisse: that I repent   
- To thinke I liue to see this day.   
-   For after this I playned still   
- So long, and in so piteous wise:   
- That I my wish had at my will   
- Graunted, as I would it deuise.   
-   But Lord who euer heard, or knew   
- Of halfe the iove that I felt than?   
- Or who can thinke it may be true,   
- That so much blisse had euer man?   
-   Lo, fortune thus set me aloft:   
- And more my sorowes to releue,   
- Of pleasant ioyes I tasted oft:   
- As much as loue or happe might geue.   
-   The sorowes olde, I felt before   
- About my hart, were driuen thence:   
- And for eche greefe, I felt afore,   
- I had a blisse in recompence.   
-   Then thought I all the time well spent:   
- That I in plaint had spent so long.   
- So was I with my life content:   
- That to my self I sayd among.   
-   Sins thou art ridde of all thine yll:   
- To showe thy ioyes set forth thy voyce.   
- And sins thou hast thy wish at will:   
- My happy hart, reioyce, reioyce.   
-   Thus felt I ioyes a great deale mo,   
- Then by my song may well be tolde:   
- And thinkyng on my passed wo,   
- My blisse did double many folde.   
-   And thus I thought with mannes blood,   
- Such blisse might not be bought to deare.   
- In such estate my ioyes then stode:   
- That of a change I had no feare.   
-   But why sing I so long of blisse?   
- It lasteth not, that will away,   
- Let me therfore bewaile the misse:   
- And sing the cause of my decay.       
-   Yet all this while there liued none,   
- That led his life more pleasantly:   
- Nor vnder hap there was uot[^]: not

 one,   
- Me thought, so well at ease, as I.   
-   But O blinde ioye, who may thee trust?   
- For no estate thou canst assure?   
- Thy faithfull vowes proue all vniust:   
- Thy faire behestes be full vnsure.   
-   Good proufe by me: that but of late   
- Not fully twenty dayes ago:   
- Which thought my life was in such state:   
- That nought might worke my hart this wo.   
-   Yet hath the enemy of my ease,   
- Mishappe I meane, that wretched wight:   
- Now when my life did moste me please:   
- Deuised me such cruel spight.   
-   That from the hiest place of all,   
- As to the pleasyng of my thought,   
- Downe to the deepest am I fall,   
- And to my helpe auaileth nought,   
-   Lo, thus are all my ioyes gone:   
- And I am brought from happinesse,   
- Continually to waile, and mone.   
- Lo, such is fortunes stablenesse.   
-   In welth I thought such suretie,   
- That pleasure should haue ended neuer.   
- But now (alas) aduersitie,   
- Doth make my singyng cease for euer.   
-   O brittle ioye, O slidyng blisse,   
- O fraile pleasure, O welth vnstable:   
- Who feles thee most, he shall not misse   
- At length to be made miserable.   
-   For all must end as doth my blisse:   
- There is none other certentie.   
- And at the end the worst is his,   
- That most hath knowen prosperitie.   
-   For he that neuer blisse assaied,   
- May well away with wretchednesse:   
- But he shall finde that hath it sayd,   
- A paine to part from pleasantnesse:   
-   As I doe now, for er I knew   
- What pleasure was: I felt no griefe,       
- Like vnto this, and it is true,   
- That blisse hath brought me all this mischiefe.   
-   But yet I haue not songen, how   
- This mischiefe came: but I intend   
- With wofull voice to sing it now:   
- And therwithall I make an end.   
-   But Lord, now that it is begoon,   
- I feele, my sprites are vexed sore.   
- Oh, geue me breath till this be done:   
- And after let me liue no more,   
-   Alas, the enmy of my life,   
- The ender of all pleasantnesse:   
- Alas, he bringeth all this strife,   
- And causeth all this wretchednesse.   
-   For in the middes of all the welth,   
- That brought my hart to happinesse:   
- This wicked death he came by stelthe,   
- And robde me of my ioyfulnesse.   
-   He came, when that I little thought   
- Of ought, that might me vexe so sore:   
- And sodenly he brought to nought   
- My pleasantnesse for euermore,   
-   He slew my ioye (alas, the wretch)   
- He slew my ioye, or I was ware:   
- And now (alas) no might may stretch   
- To set an end to my great care.   
-   For by this cursed deadly stroke,   
- My blisse is lost, and I forlore:   
- And no help may the losse reuoke:   
- For lost it is for euermore.   
-   And closed vp are those faire eyes,   
- That gaue me first the signe of grace:   
- My faire swete foes, myne enemies,   
- And earth dothe hide her pleasant face.   
-   The loke which did my life vpholde:   
- And all my sorowes did confounde:   
- With which more blisse then may be tolde:   
- Alas, now lieth it vnder ground.   
-   But cease, for I will syng no more:   
- Since that my harme hath no redresse:   
- But as a wretche for euermore,   
- My life will waste with wretchednesse.       
-   And ending thys my wofull song,   
- Now that it ended is and past:   
- I wold my life were but as long:   
- And that this word might be my last.   
-   For lothsome is that life (men saye)   
- That liketh not the liuers minde:   
- Lo, thus I seke myne owne decaye,   
- And will, till that I may it finde   
    
## Fvll faire and white she is

  Of his loue named white.   

  - Fvll faire and white she is, and White by name:   
- Whose white doth striue, the lillies white to staine:   
- Who may contemne the blast of blacke defame:   
- Who in darke night, can bring day bright againe.   
- The ruddy rose inpreaseth, with cleare heew,   
- In lips, and chekes, right orient to behold:   
- That the nere gaser may that bewty reew,   
- And fele disparst in limmes the chilling cold:   
- For White, all white his bloodlesse face wil be:   
- The asshy pale so alter will his cheare.   
- But I that do possesse in full degree   
- The harty loue of this my hart so deare:   
- So oft to me as she presents her face,   
- For ioye do fele my hart spring from his place.   
    
## What thing is that

  Of the louers vnquiet state.   

  - What thing is that which I bothe haue and lacke,   
- With good will graunted yet it is denyed   
- How may I be receiued and put abacke   
- Alway doing and yet vnoccupied,   
- Most slow in that which I haue most applied,   
- Still thus to seke, and lese all that I winne,   
- And that was ready is newest to begyn.   
-   In riches finde I wilfull pouertie,   
- In great pleasure liue I in heauinesse,   
- In much freedome I lacke my libertie,       
- Thus am I bothe in ioye and in distresse.   
- And in few wordes, if that I shall be plaine,   
- In Paradise I suffer all this paine.   
    
## It is no fire

  where good will is some profe will appere.   

  - It is no fire that geues no heate,   
- Though it appeare neuer so hotte:   
- And they that runne and can not sweate,   
- Are very leane and dry God wot.   
-   A perfect leche applieth his wittes,   
- To gather herbes of all degrees:   
- And feuers with their feruent fittes,   
- Be cured with their contraries.   
-   New wine will search to finde a vent,   
- Although the caske be neuer so strong:   
- And wit will walke when will is bent,   
- Although the way be neuer so long.   
-   The rabbets runne vnder the rockes,   
- The snailes do clime the highest towers:   
- Gunpowder cleaues the sturdy blockes,   
- A feruent will all thing deuowers.   
-   When witt e[^]: witte

 with will and diligent   
- Apply them selues, and match as mates,   
- There can no want of resident,   
- From force defende the castell gates.   
-   Forgetfulnesse makes little haste,   
- And slouth delites to lye full soft:   
- That telleth the deaf, his tale dothe waste,   
- And is full drye that craues full oft.   
    
## Alas that euer death

  Verses written on the picture of sir Iames wilford.   

  - Alas that euer death such vertues should forlet,   
- As compast was within his corps, whose picture is here set.   
- Or that it euer laye in any fortunes might,   
- Through depe disdaine his life to traine [that] was so worthy a wight       
- For sith he first began in armour to be clad,   
- A worthier champion then he was yet Englande neuer had.   
- And though recure be past, his life to haue againe,   
- Yet would I wish his worthinesse in writyng to remaine.   
- That men to minde might call how farre he did excell,   
- At all assayes to wynne the praise, which were to long to tell.   
- And eke the restlesse race that he full oft hath runne,   
- In painfull plight fro[m] place to place, where seruice was to doon   
- Then should men well perceiue, my tale to be of trouth,   
- And he to be the worthiest wight that euer nature wrought.   
    
## Shall I thus euer long

  The ladye praieth the returne of of her louer abidyng on the seas.   

  - Shall I thus euer long, and be no whit the neare,   
- And shal I styll complayn to thee, the which me will not here?   
- Alas say nay, say nay, and be no more so dome,   
- But open thou thy manly mouth, and say that thou wilt come.   
- Wherby my hart may thinke, although I see not thee,   
- That thou wilt come thy word so sware, if thou a liues man be.   
- The roaryng hugy waues, they threaten my pore ghost,   
- And tosse thee vp and downe the seas, in daunger to be lost.   
- Shall they not make me feare that they haue swalowed thee,   
- But as thou art most sure aliue so wilt thou come to me.   
- Wherby I shall go see thy shippe ride on the strande   
- And thinke and say lo where he comes, and sure here will he land.   
- And then I shall lift vp to thee my little hande,   
- And thou shalt thinke thine hert in ease, in helth to se me stand.   
- And if thou come in dede (as Christ the send to do,)   
- Those armes which misse thee now shall then imbrace thee to.   
- Ech vaine to euery ioynt, the liuely bloud shall spred,   
- Which now for want of thy glad sight, doth show full pale & dead.   
- But if thou slip thy trouth and do not come at all,   
- As minutes in the clocke do strike so call for death I shall.   
- To please bothe thy false hart, and rid my self from wo,   
- That rather had to dye in trouth then liue forsaken so.   
    
## The doutfull man

  The meane estate is best.       

  - The doutfull man hath feuers strange   
- And constant hope is oft diseased,   
- Dispaire can not but brede a change,   
- Nor fletyng hartes can not be pleasde.   
- Of all these badde, the best I thinke,   
- Is well to hope, though fortune shrinke.   
-   Desired thinges are not ay prest,   
- Nor thinges denide left all vnsought,   
- Nor new things to be loued best,   
- Nor all offers to be set at nought,   
- Where faithfull hart hath bene refusde,   
- The chosers wit was there abusde.   
-   The woful shyppe of carefull sprite,   
- Fletyng on seas of wellyng teares,   
- With sayles of wishes broken quite,   
- Hangyng on waues of dolefull feares,   
- By surge of sighes at wrecke nere hand,   
- May fast no anker holde on land.   
-   What helps the dyall to the blinde,   
- Or els the clock without it sound,   
- Or who by dreames dothe hope to finde,   
- The hidden gold within the ground:   
- Shalbe as free from cares and feares,   
- As he that holds a wolfe by the eares.   
-   And how much mad is he that thinkes   
- To clime to heauen by the beames,   
- What ioye alas, hath he that winkes,   
- At Titan or his golden stremes,   
- His ioyes not subiect to reasons lawes,   
- That ioyeth more then he hath cause.   
-   For as the Phenix that climeth hye,   
- The sonne lightly in ashes burneth,   
- Againe, the Faulcon so quicke of eye,   
- Sone on the ground the net masheth.   
- Experience therfore the meane assurance,   
- Prefers before the doutfull pleasance.   
    
## Sith that the way

  The louer thinkes no payne to great, wherby he may obtaine his lady.       

  - Sith that the way to welth is woe,   
- And after paynes pleasure prest,   
- Whie should I than dispaire so.   
- Ay bewailling mine vnrest,   
- Or let to lede my liefe in paine,   
- So worthy a lady to obtayne,   
-   The fisher man doth count no care,   
- To cast hys nets to wracke or wast,   
- And in reward of eche mans share,   
- A gogen gift is much imbrast,   
- Sould[^]: Should

 I than grudge it grief or gall,   
- That loke at length to whelm a whall.   
-   The pore ma[n] ploweth his grou[n]d for graine,   
- And soweth his seede increase to craue,   
- And for thexpence of all hys paine.   
- Oft holdes it hap his seede to saue,   
- These pacient paines my part do show,   
- To long for loue er that I know.   
-   And take no skorne to scape from skill,   
- To spende my spirites to spare my speche,   
- To win for welth the want of will.   
- And thus for rest to rage I reche,   
- Running my race as rect vpright:   
- Till teares of truth appease my plight.   
-   And plant my plaint within her brest,   
- Who doubtles may restore againe,   
- My harmes to helth my ruthe to rest.   
- That laced is within her chayne,   
- For earst ne are the grieues so gret:   
- As is the ioy when loue is met.   
-   For who couets so high to clim,   
- As doth the birde that pitfoll toke,   
- Or who delightes so swift to swim.   
- As doth the fishe that scapes the hoke,   
- If these had neuer entred woe:   
- How mought they haue reioysed so.   
-   But yet alas ye louers all,   
- That here me ioy thus lesse reioyce,   
- Iudge not amys whatso befall.   
- In me there lieth no power of choyse,   
- It is but hope that doth me moue:   
- Who standerd bearer is to loue.       
-   On whose ensigne when I beholde,   
- I se the shadowe of her shape,   
- Within my faith so fast I folde:   
- Through dread I die, through hope I scape,   
- Thus ease and wo full oft I finde,   
- What will you more she knoweth my minde.   
    
## A student at his boke

  Of a new maried Student.   

  - A Student at his boke so plast,   
- That welth he might haue wonne:   
- From boke to wife did flete in haste,   
- From wealth to wo to runne.   
- Now, who hath plaied a feater cast,   
- Since iuglyng first begoon ?   
- In knittyng of him selfe so fast,   
- Him selfe he hath vndoon.   
    
## Who craftly castes to stere

  The meane estate is to be [^]: line preceded by a paragraph sign

  accompted the best.   

  - Who craftly castes to stere his boate   
-   and safely skoures the flattering flood:   
- He cutteth not the greatest waues   
-   for why that way were nothing good.   
- Ne fleteth on the crocked shore   
-   lest harme him happe awayting lest.   
- But wines away betwene the[m] both,   
-   as who would say the meane is best.   
- Who waiteth on the golde[n] meane,   
-   he put in point of sickernes:   
- Hides not his head in sluttishe coates,   
-   ne shroudes himself in filthines.   
- Ne sittes aloft in hye estate,   
-   where hatefull hartes enuie his chance:   
- But wisely walkes betwixt them twaine,   
-   ne proudly doth himself auance   
- The highest tree in all the woode   
-   is rifest rent with blustring windes:       
- The higher hall the greater fall   
-   such chance haue proude and lofty mindes.   
- When Iupiter from hie doth threat   
-   with mortall mace and dint of thunder   
- the highest hilles ben batrid eft   
-   when they stand still that stoden vnder   
- The man whose head with wit is fraught   
-   in welth will feare a worser tide   
- When fortune failes dispaireth nought   
-   but constantly doth stil abide   
- For he that sendith grisely stormes   
-   with whisking windes and bitter blastes   
- And fowlth with haile the winters face   
-   and frotes the soile with hory frostes   
- Euen he adawth the force of colde   
-   the spring in sendes with somer hote   
- The same full oft to stormy hartes   
-   is cause of bale: of ioye the roote.   
- Not always il though so be now   
-   when cloudes ben driuen then rides the racke   
- Phebus the fresh ne shoteth still   
-   sometime he harpes his muse to wake   
- Stand stif therfore pluck vp thy hart   
-   lose not thy port though fortune faile   
- Againe whan wind doth serue at will   
-   take hede to hye to hoyse thy saile.   
    
## I lent my loue to losse

  The louer refused lamen-[^]: line preceded by a paragraph sign

  teth his estate.   

  - I Lent my loue to losse and gaged my life in vaine,   
- If hate for loue and death for life of louers be the gaine.   
-   And curse I may by course the place eke time and howre   
- That nature first in me did forme to be a liues creature   
-   Sith that I must absent my selfe so secretly   
- In place desert where neuer man my secretes shall discrye   
-   In dolling of my dayes among the beastes so brute   
- Who with their tonges may not bewray the secretes of my sute   
-   Nor I in like to them may once to moue my minde   
- But gase on them aud[^]: and

 they on me as bestes are wont of kinde   
-   Thus ranging as refusde to reche some place of rest,       
- All ruff of heare, my nayles vnnocht, as to such semeth best.   
-   That wander by theyr wittes, deformed so to be,   
- That men may say, such one may curse the tyme he first gan se,   
-   The beauty of her face, her shape in such degree,   
- As god himself may not discerne, one place mended to be.   
-   Nor place it in lyke place, my fansy for to please,   
- Who would become a heardmans hyre one howre to haue of ease.   
-   Wherby I might restore, to me some stedfastnes,   
- That haue mo thoughts hept in my head then life may lo[n]g disges.   
-   As oft to throw me downe vpon the earth so cold,   
- Wheras with teares most rufully, my sorowes do vnfold.   
-   And in beholding them, I chiefly call to mynd,   
- What woman could find in her heart, such bondage for to bynd.   
-   Then rashly furth I yede, to cast me from that care,   
- Lyke as the byrd for foode doth flye, and lighteth in the snare.   
-   From whence I may not meue, vntil my race be roon,   
- So trayned is my truth through her, [that] thinkes my life well woon.   
-   Thus tosse I too and fro, in hope to haue reliefe,   
- But in the fine I fynd not so, it doubleth but my grief.   
-   Wherfore I will my want, a warning for to be,   
- Vnto all men, wishing that they, a myrrour make of me.   
    
## Whe[n] dredful swelling seas

  The felicitie of a mind imbracing vertue, that beholdeth the wretched   desyres of the worlde.   

  - Whe[n] dredful swelling seas, through boisterous windy blastes   
- So tosse the shippes, that al for nought, serues ancor sayle & mastes.[^]: 1 from following line

  
-   Who takes not pleasure then, safely on shore to rest,   
- And see with dreade & depe despayre, how shipmen are distrest.   
-   Not that we pleasure take, when others felen smart,   
- Our gladnes groweth to see their harmes, & yet to fele no parte.   
-   Delyght we take also, well ranged in aray,   
- When armies meete to see the fight, yet free be from the fray.   
-   But yet among the rest, no ioy may match with this,   
- Taspayre vnto the temple hye, where wisdom troned is.   
-   Defended with the saws of hory heades expert,   
- Which clere it kepe fro[m] errours myst, that myght the truth peruert.   
-   From whence thou mayst loke down, and see as vnder foote,   
- Mans wa[n]dring wil & doutful life, fro[m] whe[n]ce they take their roote.       
- How some by wit contend by prowes some to rise   
- Riches and rule to gaine and hold is all that men deuise.   
- O miserable mindes O hertes in folly drent   
- Why se you not what blindnesse in thys wretched life is spent.   
- Body deuoyde of grefe mynde free from care and dreede   
- Is all and some that nature craues wherwith our life to feede.   
- So that for natures turne few thinges may well suffice   
- Dolour and grief clene to expell and some delight surprice:   
- Yea and it falleth oft that nature more contente   
- Is with the lesse, then when the more to cause delight is spent.   
    
## The winter with his griesly

  All worldly pleasures fade.   

  - The winter with his griesly stormes no lenger dare abyde,   
- The plesant grasse, with lusty grene, the earth hath newly dyde.   
- The trees haue leues, [the] bowes don spred, new cha[n]ged is [the] yere.   
- The water brokes are cleane sonke down, the plesa[n]t ba[n]kes apere.   
- The spring is come, the goodly nimphes now dau[n]ce in euery place   
- Thus hath the yere most plesantly of late ychangde his face.   
- Hope for no immortalitie, for welth will weare away,   
- As we may learne by euery yere, yea howres of euery day.   
- For Zepharus doth mollifye the colde and blustering windes:   
- The somers drought doth take away [the] spryng out of our minds.   
- And yet the somer cannot last, but once must step asyde,   
- The[n] Autumn thinkes to kepe hys place, but Autumn ca[n]not bide.   
- For when he hath brought furth his fruits & stuft [the] barns w[ith] corn,   
- The winter eates & empties all, and thus is Autumn worne.   
- Then hory frostes possesse the place, the[n] te[m]pestes work much harm,   
- The[n] rage of stormes done make al colde whiche somer had made so warm[^]: 1 from following line

  
- Wherfore let no man put his trust in that, that will decay,   
- For slipper welth will not cu[n]tinue, plesure will weare away.   
- For when that we haue lost our lyfe, & lye vnder a stone,   
- What are we then, we are but earth, then is our pleasure gon.   
- No man can tell what god almight of euery wight doth cast,   
- No man can say to day I liue, till morne my lyfe shall last.   
- For when thou shalt before thy iudge stand to receiue thy dome,   
- What sentence Minos dothe pronounce that must of thee become.   
- Then shall not noble stock and blud redeme the fro[m] his handes,   
- Nor surged talke with eloquence shal lowse thee fro[m] his bandes.   
- Nor yet thy lyfe vprightly lead, can help thee out of hell,   
- For who descendeth downe so depe, must there abyde & dwell.       
- Diana could not thence deliuer chaste Hypolitus,   
- Nor Thes eus[^]: Theseus

 could not call to life his frende Periothous.   
    
## In sekyng rest

  A complaint of the losse of libertie by loue.   

  - In sekyng rest vnrest I finde,   
- I finde that welth is cause of wo:   
- Wo worth the time that I inclinde,   
- To fixe in minde her beauty so.   
-   That day be darkened as the night,   
- Let furious rage it cleane deuour:   
- Ne sunne nor moone therin geue light,   
- But it consume with storme and shower.   
-   Let no small birdes straine forth their voyce,   
- With pleasant tunes ne yet no beast:   
- Finde cause wherat he may reioyce,   
- That day when chaunced mine vnrest.   
-   Wherin alas from me was raught,   
- Mine owne free choyse and quiet minde:   
- My life my death in balance braught   
- And reason rasde through barke and rinde.   
-   And I as yet in flower of age,   
- Bothe witte and will did still aduaunce:   
- Ay to resist that burnyng rage:   
- But when I darte then did I glaunce.   
-   Nothing to me did seme so hye,   
- In minde I could it straight attaine:   
- Fansy persuaded me therby,   
- Loue to esteme a thing most vaine.   
-   But as the birde vpon the brier,   
- Dothe pricke and proyne her without care:   
- Not knowyng alas pore fole how nere   
- She is vnto the fowlers snare,   
-   So I amid disceitfull trust,   
- Did not mistrust such wofull happe:   
- Till cruell loue er that I wist   
- Had caught me in his carefull trappe.   
-   Then did I fele and partly know,   
- How little force in me did raigne:       
- So sone to yelde to ouerthrow,   
- So fraile to flit from ioye to paine.   
-   For when in welth will did me leade   
- Of libertie to hoyse my saile:   
- To hale at shete and cast my leade,   
- I thought free choise wold still preuaile   
-   In whose calme streames I sayld so farre   
- No ragyng storme had in respect:   
- Vntyll I raysde a goodly starre,   
- Wherto my course I did direct.   
-   In whose prospect in doolfull wise,   
- My tackle failde my compasse brake:   
- Through hote desires such stormes did rise,   
- That sterne and toppe went all to wrake.   
-   Oh cruell happe oh fatall chaunce,   
- O Fortune why were thou vnkinde:   
- Without regard thus in a traunce,   
- To reue fro me my ioyfull minde.   
-   Where I was free now must I serue,   
- Where I was lose now am I bounde:   
- In death my life I do preserue,   
- As one through girt with many a wound.   
    
## Geue place you Ladies

  A praise of his Ladye.   

  - Geue place you Ladies and be gon,   
- Boast not your selues at all:   
- For here at hande approcheth one   
- Whose face will staine you all.   
-   The vertue of her liuely lokes,   
- Excels the precious stone:   
- I wishe to haue none other bokes   
- To read or loke vpon.   
-   In eche of her two cristall eyes,   
- Smileth a naked boye:   
- It would you all in hart suffise   
- To see that lampe of ioye.   
-   I thinke nature hath lost the moulde,   
- Where she her shape did take:       
- Or els I doubt if nature could,   
- So faire a creature make.   
-   She may be well comparde   
- Vnto the Phenix kinde:   
- Whose like was neuer sene nor heard,   
- That any man can finde.   
-   In life she is Diana chast,   
- In trouth Penelopey:   
- In word and eke in dede stedfast,   
- What will you more we sey.   
-   If all the world were sought so farre,   
- Who could finde such a wight:   
- Her beauty twinkleth like a starre,   
- Within the frosty night.   
-   Her rosiall colour comes and goes,   
- With such a comely grace:   
- More redier to then doth the rose,   
- Within her liuely face.   
-   At Bacchus feast none shall her mete,   
- Ne at no wanton play:   
- Nor gasyng in an open strete,   
- Nor gaddyng as a stray.   
-   The modest mirth that she dothe vse,   
- Is mixt with shamefastnesse:   
- All vice she dothe wholy refuse,   
- And hateth ydlenesse.   
-   O lord it is a world to see,   
- How vertue can repaire:   
- And decke in her such honestie,   
- Whom nature made so fayre.   
-   Truely she dothe as farre excede,   
- Our women now adayes:   
- As dothe the Ielifloure a wede,   
- And more a thousande wayes.   
-   How might I do to get a graffe:   
- Of this vnspotted tree.   
- For all the rest are plaine but chaffe,   
- Which seme good corne to be.   
-   This gift alone I shall her geue   
- When death doth what he can:   
- Her honest fame shall euer liue,   
- Within the mouth of man.       
    
## Experience now doth shew

  The pore estate to be holden for best.   

  [^]: space after first letter of each line:  EDWARDE SOMERSE

  - Experience now doth shew what God vs taught before,   
- Desired pompe is vaine, and seldome dothe it last:   
- Who climbes to raigne with kinges, may rue his fate full sore.   
- Alas the wofull ende that comes with care full fast,   
- Reiect him dothe renowne his pompe full lowe is caste.   
- Deceiued is the birde by swetenesse of the call   
- Expell that pleasant taste, wherein is bitter gall.   
-   Such as with oten cakes in pore estate abides,   
- Of care haue they no cure, the crab with mirth they rost,   
- More ease fele they then those, that from their height downe slides   
- Excesse doth brede their wo, they saile in scillas cost,   
- Remainyng in the stormes till shyp and all be lost.   
- Serue God therfore thou pore, for lo, thou liues in rest,   
- Eschue the golden hall, thy thatched house is best.   
    
## Thestilis a sely man

  The complaint of Thestilis amid the desert wodde.   

  - Thestilis a sely man, when loue did him forsake,   
- In mourning wise, amid [the] woods thus gan his plaint to make.   
- Ah wofull man (quod he) fallen is thy lot to mone   
- And pyne away w[ith] carefull thoughts, vnto thy loue vnknowen.   
- Thy lady thee forsakes whom thou didst honor so   
- That ay to her thou wer a frend, and to thy self a foe.   
- Ye louers that haue lost your heartes desyred choyse,   
- Lament with me my cruell happe, & helpe my trembling voyce.   
- Was neuer man that stode so great in fortunes grace:   
- Nor with his swete alas to deare possest so high a place.   
- As I whose simple hart aye thought him selfe full sure,   
- But now I se hye springyng tides they may not aye endure.   
- She knowes my giltelesse hart, and yet she lets it pine,   
- Of her vntrue professed loue so feble is the twine.   
- What wonder is it than, if I berent my heeres,   
- And crauyng death continually do bathe my selfe in teares,   
- When Cresus king of Lide was cast in cruell bandes,   
- And yelded goodes and life also into his enemies handes.       
- What tong could tell hys wo yet was hys griefe much lesse:   
- Then mine for I haue lost my loue which might my woe redresse.   
- Ye woodes that shroud my limes giue now your holow sound,   
- That ye may helpe me to bewaile the cares that me confound.   
- Ye riuers rest a while and stay the stremes that runne,   
- Rew Thestilis most woful man that liueth vnder sunne.   
- Transport my sighes ye windes vnto my pleasant foe,   
- My trickling teares shall witnesse bear of this my cruell woe.   
- O happy man wer I if all the goddes agreed:   
- That now the susters three should cut in twaine my fatall threde.   
- Till life with loue shall ende I here resigne all ioy:   
- Thy pleasant swete I now lament whose lack bredes myne anoy   
- Farewell my deare therfore farewell to me well knowne   
- If that I die it shalbe sayd that thou hast slaine thine owne.   
    
## Nature that taught

  [^]: line preceded by a paragraph sign

  The louer praieth pity showing that nature hath taught his dog as it   were to sue for the same by kissing his ladies handes.   

  - Nature that taught my silly dog god wat:   
- Euen for my sake to like where I do loue,   
- Inforced him wheras my lady sat   
- With humble sute before her falling flat.   
- As in his sorte he might her play and moue   
- To rue vpon his lord and not forgete   
- The stedfast faith he beareth her and loue,   
- Kissing her hand whom she could not remoue.   
- Away that would for frowning nor for threte   
- As though he would haue sayd in my behoue.   
- Pity my lord your slaue that doth remaine   
- Lest by his death you giltles slay vs twaine.

- Since thou mayst speake where I must hold my peace.   
- Say vnto her that is my liues stay.   
- Grauen the within which I do here expresse:   
- That sooner shall the sonne not shine by day,   
- And with the raine the floodes shall waxen lesse.       
- Sooner the tree the hunter shall bewray,   
- Then I for change or choyce of other loue,   
- Do euer seke my fansy to remoue.   
    
## For that a restles head

  The changeable state of louers.   

  - For that a restles head must somewhat haue in vre   
- Wherwith it may acquaynted be, as falcon is with lure.   
-   Fansy doth me awake out of my drowsy slepe,   
- In seeing how the little mouse, at night begyns to crepe.   
-   So the desyrous man, that longes to catch hys pray,   
- In spying how to watch hys tyme, lyeth lurkyng styll by day.   
-   In hopyng for to haue, and fearyng for to fynde   
- The salue that should recure his sore, & soroweth but the mynde,   
-   Such is the guyse of loue, and the vncertain state,   
- That some should haue theyr hoped happe, and other hard estate.   
-   That some should seme to ioy in that they neuer had,   
- And some agayn shall frown as fast, where causeles they be sad.   
-   Such trades do louers vse when they be most at large,   
- That gyde the stere when they themselues lye fettred in [the] barge.   
-   The grenes of my youth cannot therof expresse   
- The proces, for by profe vnknowen, all this is but by gesse.   
-   Wherfore I hold it best, in tYme to hold my peace,   
- But wanton will it cannot hold, or make my pen to cease.   
-   A pen of no auayle, a fruitles labour eke,   
- My troubled head with fansies fraught, doth payn it self to seke.   
-   And if perhappes my wordes of none auayle do pricke,   
- Such as do fele the hidden harmes, I would not they shold kicke.   
-   As causeles me to blame which thinketh them no harme,   
- Although I seme by others fyre, sometime my self to warme.   
-   Which clerely I denye, as gyltles of that cryme,   
- And though wrong demde I be therin, truth it will trye in tyme.

  A praise of Audley.   

  - When Audley had runne out his race and ended wer his days,   
- His fame stept forth & bad me write of hi[m] some worthy praise.   
- What life he lad, what actes he did: his vertues & good name,   
- Wherto I calde for true report, as witnes of the same.       
- Wel born he was wel bent by kinde, whose mind did neuer swarue   
- A skilfull head, a valiant hert, a ready hand to serue.   
- Brought vp & trained in feats of war long time beyond the seas   
- Cald home again to serue his prince who[m] styll he sought to please.   
- What tornay was there he refusde, what seruice did he shone,   
- Where he was not nor his aduice, what great exploit was done,   
- In towne a lambe in felde full fierce a lyon at the nede,   
- In sober wit a Salomon, yet one of Hectors sede.   
- Then shame it were that any tong shold now defame his dedes   
- That in his life a mirror was to all that him succedes.   
- No pore estate nor hie renowne his nature could peruart,   
- No hard mischaunce that him befel could moue his constant hart.   
- Thus long he liued loued of all as one mislikt of none,   
- And where he went who cald him not the gentle Peragon.   
- But course of kinde doth cause eche frute to fall whe[n] it is ripe,   
- And spitefull death will suffer none to scape his greuous gripe.   
- Yet though the ground receiued haue his corps into her wombe,   
- This epitaphe ygraue in brasse, shall stand vpon his tombe.   
- Lo here he lies that hateth vice, and vertues life imbrast,   
- His name in earth his sprite aboue deserues to be well plast.

- And faithfulnesse is ful of frute, & fruteful thinges be sounde.   
- And sound is good at proufe, and proufe is prince of praise,   
- And precious praise is such a pearle as seldome ner decayes.   
- All these thinges time tries forth, which time I must abide,   
- How shold I boldly credite craue till time my truth haue tryed.   
- For as I found a time to fall in fansies frame,   
- So I do wishe a lucky time for to declare the same.   
- If hap may answere hope and hope may haue his hire,   
- Then shall my hart possesse in peace the time that I desire.

- Loe here you may beholde, aloft vpon his brest,

## I lothe that I did loue

  The aged louer renounceth loue.   

  - I Lothe that I did loue,   
- In youth that I thought swete:   
- As time requires for my behoue   
- Me thinkes they are not mete,   
-   My lustes they do me leaue,   
- My fansies all be fledde:   
- And tract of time begins to weaue,   
- Gray heares vpon my hedde.   
-   For age with stelyng steppes,   
- Hath clawed me with his cowche:   
- And lusty life away she leapes,   
- As there had bene none such.   
-   My muse dothe not delight   
- Me as she did before:   
- My hand and pen are not in plight,   
- As they haue bene of yore.   
-   For reason me denies,   
- This youthly idle rime:   
- And day by day to me she cryes,   
- Leaue of these toyes in time.   
-   The wrincles in my brow,   
- The furrowes in my face:       
- Say limpyng age will hedge him now,   
- Where youth must geue him place.   
-   The harbinger of death,   
- To me I see him ride:   
- The cough, the colde, the gaspyng breath,   
- Dothe bid me to prouide.   
-   A pikeax and a spade,   
- And eke a shrowdyng shete,   
- A house of claye for to be made,   
- For such a gest most mete.   
-   Me thinkes I heare the clarke,   
- That knols the careful knell:   
- And bids me leaue my wofull warke,   
- Er nature me compell.   
-   My kepers knit the knot,   
- That youth did laugh to scorne:   
- Of me that clene shalbe forgot,   
- As I had not ben borne.   
-   Thus must I youth geue vp,   
- Whose badge I long did weare:   
- To them I yelde the wanton cup   
- That better may it beare.   
-   Loe here the bared scull,   
- By whose balde signe I know:   
- That stoupyng age away shall pull,   
- Which youthfull yeres did sowe.   
-   For beauty with her bande   
- These croked cares hath wrought:   
- And shipped me into the lande,   
- From whence I first was brought.   
-   And ye that bide behinde,   
- Haue ye none other trust:   
- As ye of claye were cast by kinde,   
- So shall ye waste to dust.

- The loue and all I owe to thee,   
- Here I renounce and make me free.   
-   Which fredome I haue by thy guilt,

- Since so vnconstantly thou wilt,   
- Not loue, but still be swaruyng.   
- To leue me oft which was thine owne,   
- Without cause why as shalbe knowen.   
-   The frutes were faire the which did grow,   
- Within thy garden planted,   
- The leaues were grene of euery bough,   
- And moysture nothing wanted,   
- Yet or the blossoms gan to fall,   
- The caterpiller wasted all.   
-   Thy body was the garden place,   
- And sugred wordes it beareth,   
- The blossomes all thy faith it was,   
- Which as the canker wereth.   
- The cater piller is the same,   
- That hath wonne thee and lost thy name.       
-   I meane thy louer loued now,   
- By thy pretended folye,   
-   Which will proue lyke, thou shalt fynd how,   
- Vnto a tree of holly:   
- That barke and bery beares alwayes,   
- The one, byrdes feedes, the other slayes.   
-   And right well mightest thou haue thy wish   
- Of thy loue new acquaynted:   
- For thou art lyke vnto the dishe   
- That Adrianus paynted:   
- Wherin wer grapes portrayd so fayre   
- That fowles for foode did there repayre.   
-   But I am lyke the beaten fowle   
- That from the net escaped,   
- And thou art lyke the rauening owle   
- That all the night hath waked.   
- For none intent but to betray   
- The sleping fowle before the day.   
-   Thus hath thy loue been vnto me   
- As pleasant and commodious,   
- As was the fyre made on the sea   
- By Naulus hate so odious.   
- Therwith to trayn the grekish host   
- From Troyes return where they wer lost.   
    
## As Cypres tree that rent

  The louer for want of his desyre, sheweth his death at hand.   

  - As Cypres tree that rent is by the roote.   
- As branch or slyppe bereft from whe[n]ce it growes   
- As well sowen seede for drought that can not sproute   
- As gaping ground that raineles can not close   
- As moules that want the earth to do them bote   
- As fishe on lande to whom no water flowes,   
- As Chameleon that lackes the ayer so sote.   
- As flowers do fade when Phebus rarest showes.   
- As salamandra repulsed from the fyre:   
- So wanting my wishe I dye for my desyre       
    
## The shinyng season

  - O Petrarke hed and prince of poets all,   
- Whose liuely gift of flowyng eloquence,   
- Wel may we seke, but finde not how or whence   
- So rare a gift with thee did rise and fall,   
- Peace to thy bones, and glory immortall   
- Be to thy name, and to her excellence.   
- Whose beauty lighted in thy time and sence   
- So to be set forth as none other shall.   
- Why hath not our pens rimes so p[er]fit wrought   
- Ne why our time forth bringeth beauty such   
- To trye our wittes as golde is by the touche,       
- If to the stile the matter aided ought.   
- But therwas[^]: ther was

 neuer Laura more then one,   
- And her had petrarke for his paragone,   
    
## With petrarke to compare

  That petrark cannot be passed but notwithstanding that   Lawra is far surpassed.   

  - With petrarke to compare there may no wight,   
- Nor yet attain vnto so high a stile,   
- But yet I wote full well where is a file.,   
- To frame a learned man to praise aright:   
- Of stature meane of semely forme and shap,   
- Eche line of iust proporsion to her height:   
- Her colour freshe and mingled with such sleight:   
- As though the rose sate in the lilies lap.   
- In wit and tong to shew what may be sed,   
- To euery dede she ioynes a parfit grace,   
- If Lawra liude she would her clene deface.   
- For I dare say and lay my life to wed   
- That Momus could not if he downe discended,   
- Once iustly say lo this may be amended.

- Darke den of disceite that right doth still refuse,   
- Causles vnkinde that carieth vnder cloke   
- Cruelty and craft me onely to abuse,   
- Statelye and stubberne withstanding cupides stroke,   
- Thou merueilouse mase that makest men to muse,       
- Solleyn by selfe will, most stony stiffe and straunge,   
- What causeth thee thus causelesse for to chaunge.   
- Slipper and secrete where surety can not sowe   
- Net of newelty, neast of newfanglenesse,   
- Spring of very spite, from whence whole fluddes do flow,   
- Thou caue and cage of care and craftin esse[^]: craftinesse

  
- Waueryng willow that euery blast dothe blowe

- I would not wishe to clime to princely hye astate,   
- which slipper is and slides so oft, and hath so fickle fate.   
- Nor yet to conquere realmes with cruell sworde in hande,   
- And so to shede the giltlesse bloude of such as would withstand.   
- Nor I would not desire in worldly rule to raigne,   
- Whose frute is all vnquietnesse, and breakyng of the braine.   
- Nor richesse in excesse of vertue so abhorde,   
- I would not craue which bredeth care and causeth all discorde.   
- But my request should be more worth a thousand folde:   
- That I might haue and her enioye that hath my hart in holde.   
- Oh God what lusty life should we liue then for euer,   
- In pleasant ioy and perfect blisse, to length our liues together.   
- With wordes of frendlye chere, and lokes of liuely loue,   
- To vtter all our hotte desires, which neuer should remoue.       
- But grose and gredie wittes which grope but on the ground.   
- To gather muck of worldly goodes which oft do them confounde.   
- Can not attaine to knowe the misteries deuine   
- Of perfite loue wherto hie wittes of knowledge do incline   
- A nigard of his gold suche ioye can neuer haue   
- which gettes w[ith] toile and kepes with care and is his money slaue.   
- As they enioy alwayes that taste loue in his kinde,   
- For they do holde continually a heauen in their minde.   
- No worldly goodes could bring my hart so great an ease,   
- As for to finde or do the thing that might my ladye please.   
- For by her onely loue my hart should haue all ioye,   
- And with the same put care away, and all that coulde annoy.   
- As if that any thyng shold chance to make me sadde,   
- The touching of her corall lippes would straighteways make me gladde,[^]: 1 from following line

  
- And when that in my heart I fele that dyd me greue   
- With one imbracing of her armes she might me sone releue:   
- And as the Angels all which sit in heauen hye   
- With presence and the sight of god haue theyr felicitie.   
- So lykewyse I in earth, should haue all earthly blis,   
- With presence of that paragon, my god in earth that is.   
    
## To loue, alas

  The lady forsaken of her louer, prayeth his returne, or the end   of her own life.   

  - To loue, alas, who would not feare   
- That seeth my wofull state,   
- For he to whom my heart I beare   
- Doth me extremely hate,   
- And why therfore I cannot tell,   
- He will no lenger with me dwell.   
-   Did you not sewe and long me serue   
- Ere I you graunted grace?   
- And will you this now from me swarue   
- That neuer did trespace?   
- Alas poore woman then alas,   
- A wery lyfe here must I passe.   
-   And is there now no remedy   
- But that you will forgeat her,   
- Ther was a tyme when that perdy       
- You would haue heard her better.   
- But now that time is gone and past,   
- And all your loue is but a blast.   
-   And can you thus breake your behest   
- In dede and can you so?   
- Did you not sweare you loude me best,   
- And can you now say no?   
- Remember me poore wight in payne,   
- And for my sake turne once agayne.   
-   Alas poore Dido now I fele   
- Thy present paynful state,   
- When salse[^]: false

 Eneas did hym stele   
- From thee at Carthage gate.   
- And left thee sleapyng in thy bedde,   
- Regardyng not what he had sayd.   
-   Was neuer woman thus betrayed,   
- Nor man so false forsworne,   
- His faith and trouth so strongly tayed,   
- Vntruth hath alltotorne:   
- And I haue leaue for my good will,   
- To waile and wepe alone my fill.   
-   But since it will not better be,   
- My teares shall neuer blyn:   
- To moist the earth in such degree,   
- That I may drowne therin:   
- That by my death all men may saye,   
- Lo women are as true as they.   
-   By me all women may beware,   
- That see my wofull smart,   
- To seke true loue let them not spare,   
- Before they set their hart.   
- Or els they may become as I,   
- Which for my truth am like to dye.   
    
## In fredome was my fantasie

  The louer yelden into his ladies handes, praieth mercie.   

  - In fredome was my fantasie   
- Abhorryng bondage of the minde,       
- But now I yelde my libertie,   
- And willingly my selfe I binde.   
- Truely to serue with all my hart,   
- Whiles life doth last not to reuart.   
-   Her beauty bounde me first of all   
- And forst my will for to consent:   
- And I agree to be her thrall,   
- For as she list I am content.   
- My will is hers in that I may,   
- And where she biddes I will obey.   
-   It lieth in her my wo or welth,   
- She may do that she liketh best,   
- If that she list I haue my helth,   
- If she list not in wo I rest.   
- Sins I am fast within her bandes,   
- My wo and welth lieth in her handes.   
-   She can no lesse then pitie me,   
- Sith that my faith to her is knowne,   
- It were to much extremitie,   
- With cruelty to vse her owne.   
- Alas a sinnefull enterprice,   
- To slay that yeldes at her deuice.   
-   But I thinke not her hart so harde,   
- Nor that she hath such cruell lust:   
- I doubt nothing of her reward,   
- For my desert but well I trust,   
- As she hath beauty to allure,   
- So hath she a hart that will recure.   
    
## Among dame natures workes

  That nature which worketh al thinges for our behofe, hath made women   also for our comfort and delite.   

  - Among dame natures workes such perfite lawe is wrought,   
- That things be ruled by course of kinde in order as they ought   
- And serueth in their state, in such iust frame and sorte,   
-   That slender wits may iudge the same, & make therof report.   
- Beholde what secrete force the winde dothe easely showe,   
-   Which guides the shippes amid the seas if he his bellowes blow       
- The waters wax en[^]: waxen

 wilde where blustering blastes do rise,   
-   Yet seldome do they passe their bond es[^]: bondes

 for nature that deuise.   
- The fire which boiles the leade and trieth out the golde:   
-   Hath in his power both help and hurt if he his force vnfolde.   
- The frost which kilth the fruite doth knit the brused bones:   
-   And is a medecin of kind prepared for the nones.   
- The earth in whose entrails the foode of man doth liue,

- The aier which life desires and is to helth so swete   
-   Of nature yeldes such liuely smelles that co[m]fortes euery sprete.   
- The sonne through natures might doth draw away the dew,   
-   And spredes [the] flowers where he is wo[n]t his princely face to shew   
- The Mone which may be cald the lanterne of the night,   
-   Is halfe a guide to traueling men such vertue hath her light.   
- The sters not vertuelesse are bewtie to the eies,   
-   A lodes man to the mariner a signe of calmed skies.   
- The flowers and fruitefull trees to man doe tribute pay,   
-   And when they haue their duety done by course they fade away.   
- Eche beast both fishe and foule, doth offer lief and all,   
-   To norishe man and do him ease yea serue him at his call.   
- The serpentes venemous, whose vglye shapes we hate,   
-   Are soueraigne salues for sondry sores, & nedefull in their state.   
- Sith nature shewes her power, in eche thing thus at large,   
-   Why should not man submit hymself to be in natures charge   
- Who thinkes to flee her force, at length becomes her thrall,   
-   The wysest cannot slip her snare, for nature gouernes all.   
- Lo, nature gaue vs shape, lo nature fedes our lyues:   
-   The[n] they are worse the[n] mad I think, against her force [that] striues.   
- Though some do vse to say, which can do nought but fayne,   
-   Women were made for this intent, to put vs men to payne.   
- Yet sure I think they are a pleasure to the mynde,   
-   A ioy which man can neuer want, as nature hath assynde.   
    
## To my mishap alas I fynde

  when aduersitie is once fallen, it is to late to beware.   

  - To my mishap alas I fynde   
- That happy hap is daungerous:   
- And fortune worketh but her kynd   
- To make the ioyfull dolorous.       
- But all to late it comes to minde,   
- To waile the want that makes me blinde,   
-   Amid my mirth and pleasantnesse,   
- Such chaunce is chaunced sodainly,   
- That in dispaire without redresse,   
- I finde my chiefest remedy.   
- No new kinde of vnhappinesse,   
- Should thus haue left me comfortlesse.   
-   Who wold haue thought that my request,   
- Should bring me forth such bitter frute:   
- But now is hapt that I feard lest,   
- And all this harme comes by my sute,   
- For when I thought me happiest,   
- Euen then hapt all my chiefe vnrest.   
-   In better case was neuer none   
- And yet vnwares thus am I trapt,   
- My chiefe desire doth cause me mone,   
- And to my harme my welth is hapt,   
- There is no man but I alone,   
- That hath such cause to sigh and mone.   
-   Thus am I taught for to beware   
- And trust no more such pleasant chance,   
- My happy happe bred me this care,   
- And brought my mirth to great mischance.   
- There is no man whom happe will spare,   
- But when she list his welth is bare.   
    
## Al you that frendship

  Of a louer that made his onelye God of his loue.   

  - Al yon[^]: you

 that frendship do professe,   
- And of a frende present the place:   
- Geue eare to me that did possesse,   
- As frendly frutes as ye imbrace.   
- And to declare the circumstaunce,   
- There were them selues that did auaunce:   
- To teache me truely how to take,   
- A faithfull frende for vertues sake.       
-   But I as one of little skill,   
- To know what good might grow therby,   
- Vnto my welth I had no will,   
- Nor to my nede I had none eye,   
- But as the childe dothe learne to go,   
- So I in time did learne to know.   
- Of all good frutes the worlde brought forth,   
- A faythfull frende is thing most worth.   
-   Then with all care I sought to finde,   
- One worthy to receiue such trust:   
- One onely that was riche in minde,   
- One secrete, sober, wise, and iust.   
- Whom riches coulde not raise at all,   
- Nor pouertie procure to fall:   
- And to be short in few wordes plaine,   
- One such a frend I did attaine.   
-   And when I did enioy this welth,   
- Who liued Lord in such a case,   
- For to my frendes it was great helth,   
- And to my foes a fowle deface,   
- Aad[^]: And

 to my selfe a thing so riche   
- As seke the worlde and finde none sich   
- Thus by this frende I set such store,   
- As by my selfe I set no more.   
-   This frende so much was my delight   
- When care had clene orecome my hart,   
- One thought of her rid care as quite,   
- As neuer care had caused my smarte   
- Thus ioyed I in my frende so dere   
- Was neuer frende sate man so nere,   
- I carde for her so much alone,   
- That other God I carde for none.   
-   But as it dothe to them befall,   
- That to them selues respect haue none:   
- So my swete graffe is growen to gall,   
- Where I sowed mirthe I reaped mone   
- This ydoll that I honorde so,   
- Is now transformed to my fo.   
- That me most pleased me most paynes,   
- And in dispaire my hart remaines.   
-   And for iust scourge of such desart,   
- Thre plages I may my selfe assure,       
- First of my frende to lose my parte,   
- And next my life may not endure,   
- And last of all the more to blame,   
- My soule shall suffer for the same,   
- Wherfore ye frendes I warne you all,   
- Sit faste for feare of such a fall,

- The king gaue welth but fadyng and vnsure,   
- Death brought him blisse that euer shall endure.

-   Euen so since band dothe cause my deadly griefe,   
- That made me so my wofull chaunce lament,   
- Like thing hath brought me into paine and mischiefe,   
- Saue willingly to it I did assent.   
- To binde the thing in fredome which was free,   
- That now full sore alas repenteth me.       
    
## Svche grene to me

  Of a Rosemary braunche sente.

- As you by proofe haue alwaies sene,   
- To liue your owne and alwayes grene.

  To his loue of his constant hart.   

  - As I haue bene so will I euer be,   
- Vnto my death and lenger yf I might.   
- Haue I of loue the frendly lokyng eye,   
- Haue I of fortune the fauour or the spite,   
- I am of rock by proofe as you may see:   
- Not made of waxe nor of no metall light,   
- As leefe to dye, by chaunge as to deceaue,   
- Or breake the promise made. And so I leaue.   
    
## The golden apple

  Of the token which his loue sent him.   

  - The golden apple that the Troyan boy,   
- Gaue to Venus the fayrest of the thre,   
- Which was the cause of all the wrack of Troy,   
- Was not receiued with a greater ioye,   
- Then was the same (my loue) thou sent to me,   
- It healed my sore it made my sorowes free,   
- It gaue me hope it banisht mine annoy:   
- Thy happy hand full oft of me was blist,   
- That can geue such a salue when that thou list.       
    
## Tho Cowerd oft

  Manhode auaileth not without good Fortune.   

  - Tho Cowerd oft whom deinty viandes fed,   
- That bosted much his ladies eares to please,   
- By helpe of them whom vnder him he led   
- Hath reapt the palme that valiance could not cease.   
- The vnexpert that shoores vnknowen neare sought,   
- Whom Neptune yet apaled not with feare:   
- In wandryng shippe on trustlesse seas hath tought,   
- The skill to fele that time to long doth leare.   
- The sportyng knight that scorneth Cupides kinde,   
- With faned chere the payned cause to brede:   
- In game vnhides the leden sparkes of minde,   
- And gaines the gole, where glowyng flames should spede,   
- Thus I see proufe that trouth and manly hart,   
- May not auayle, if fortune chaunce to start.   
    
## Though in the waxe

  That constancy of all vertues is most worthy.   

  - Though in the waxe a perfect picture made,   
- Dothe shew as fayre as in the marble stone,   
- Yet do we see it is estemed of none,   
- Because that fire or force the forme dothe fade.   
- Wheras the marble holden is full dere,   
- Since that endures the date of lenger dayes.   
- Of Diamondes it is the greatest prayse,   
- So long to last and alwayes one tappere.   
- Then if we do esteme that thing for best,   
- Which in perfection lengest time dothe last:   
- And that most vayne that turnes with euery blast   
- What iewell then with tonge can be exprest.   
- Like to that hart where loue hath framed such fethe,   
- That can not fade but by the force of dethe.   
    
## Thestilis thou sely man

  - Thestilis thou sely man, why dost thou so complaine,   
- If nedes thy loue will thee forsake, thy mourning is in vaine.   
- For none can force the streames against their course to ronne,   
- Nor yet vnwillyng loue with teares or wailyng can be wonne.   
- Cease thou therfore thy plaintes, let hope thy sorowes ease,   
- The shipmen though their sailes be rent yet hope to scape the seas   
- Though straunge she seme a while, yet thinke she will not chau[n]ge   
- Good causes driue a ladies loue, sometime to seme full straunge.   
- No louer that hath wit, but can forsee such happe,   
- That no wight can at wish or will slepe in his ladies lappe.   
- Achilles for a time fayre Brises did forgo,   
- Yet did they mete with ioye againe, then thinke thou maist do so.   
- Though he and louers al in loue sharpe stormes do finde,   
- Dispaire not thou pore Thestilis though thy loue seme vnkinde.   
- Ah thinke her graffed loue can not so sone decay,   
- Hie springes may cease from swellyng styll, but neuer dry away   
- Oft stormes of louers yre, do more their loue encrease:   
- As shinyng sunne refreshe the frutes whe[n] rainyng gins to cease.   
- When springes are waxen lowe, then must they flow againe,   
- So shall thy hart aduaunced be, to pleasure out of paine.   
- When lacke of thy delight most bitter griefe apperes,   
- Thinke on Etrascus worthy loue that lasted thirty yeres,   
- Which could not long atcheue his hartes desired choyse,   
- Yet at the ende he founde rewarde that made him to reioyce.   
- Since he so long in hope with pacience did remaine,   
- Can not thy feruent loue forbeare thy loue a moneth or twaine.   
- Admit she minde to chaunge and nedes will thee forgo,   
- Is there no mo may thee delight but she that paynes thee so?   
- Thestilis draw to the towne and loue as thou hast done,   
- In time thou knowest by faythfull loue as good as she is wonne.   
- And leaue the desert woodes and waylyng thus alone   
- And seke to salue thy sore els where, if all her loue be gonne.   
    
## Lyke as the rage of raine

  The vncertaine state of a louer.   

  - Lyke as the rage of raine,   
- Filles riuers with excesse,   
- And as the drought againe,   
- Dothe draw them lesse and lesse.       
- So I bothe fall and clyme,   
- With no and yea sometime.   
-   As they swell hye and hye,   
- So dothe encrease my state,   
- As they fall drye and drye   
- So doth my wealth abate,   
- As yea is mixt with no,   
- So mirthe is mixt with wo.   
-   As nothing can endure,   
- That liues and lackes reliefe,   
- So nothing can stande sure,   
- Where chaunge dothe raigne as chiefe.   
- Wherfore I must intende,   
- To bowe when others bende.   
-   And when they laugh to smile,   
- And when they wepe to waile,   
- And when they craft, begile,   
- And when they fight, assayle,   
- And thinke there is no chaunge,   
- Can make them seme to straunge.   
-   Oh most vnhappy slaue,   
- What man may leade this course,   
- To lacke he would faynest haue,   
- Or els to do much worse.   
- These be rewardes for such,   
- As liue and loue to much.   
    
## At libertie I sit and see

  The louer in libertie smileth at them in thraldome, that sometime   scorned his bondage.   

  - At libertie I sit and see,   
- Them that haue erst laught me to scorne:   
- Whipt with the whip that scourged me,   
- And now they banne that they were borne.   
-   I see them sit full soberlye,   
- And thinke their earnest lokes to hide:   
- Now in them selues they can not spye,   
- That they or this in me haue spied.       
-   I see them sittyng all alone,   
- Markyng the steppes ech worde and loke:   
- And now they treade where I haue gone   
- The painfull pathe that I forsoke.   
-   Now I see well I saw no whit,   
- When they saw well that now are blinde   
- But happy hap hath made me quit,   
- And iust iudgement hath them assinde.   
-   I see them wander all alone,   
- And trede full fast in dredfull dout:   
- The selfe same pathe that I haue gone,   
- Blessed be hap that brought me out.   
-   At libertie all this I see,   
- And say no worde but erst among:   
- Smiling at them that laught at me,   
- Lo such is hap marke well my song.   
    
## I read how Troylus

  A comparison of his loue wyth the faithfull and painful loue   of Troylus to Creside.   

  - I Read how Troylus serued in Troy,   
- A lady long and many a day,   
- And how he bode so great anoy,   
- For her as all the stories saye.   
- That halfe the paine had neuer man,   
- Which had this wofull Troyan than.   
-   His youth, his sport, his pleasant chere,   
- His courtly state and company,   
- In him so straungly altred were,   
- With such a face of contrary.   
- That euery ioye became a wo,   
- This poyson new had turned him so.   
-   And what men thought might most him ease   
- And most that for his comfort stode,   
- The same did most his minde displease,   
- And set him most in furious mode,   
- For all his pleasure euer lay,   
- To thinke on her that was away,       
-   His chamber was his common walke,   
- Wherin he kept him seretely,[^]: secretely

  
- He made his bedde the place of talke,   
- To heare his great extremitie.   
- In nothing els had he delight,   
- But euen to be a martyr right.   
-   And now to call her by her name   
- And straight therwith to sigh and throbbe:   
- And when his fansyes might not frame,   
- Then into teares and so to sobbe,   
- All in extreames and thus he lyes   
- Making two fountayns of his eyes.   
-   As agues haue sharpe shiftes of fittes   
- Of colde and heat successiuely:   
- So had his head like chaunge of wittes:   
- His pacience wrought so diuersly.   
- Now vp, now downe, now here, now there,   
- Like one that was he wist not where.   
-   And thus though he were Pryams sonne   
- And commen of the kinges hie bloude,   
- This care he had er he her wonne.   
- Till shee that was his maistresse good,   
- And lothe to see her seruaunt so,   
- Became Phisicion to his wo.   
-   And toke him to her handes and grace,   
- And said she would her minde apply,   
- To helpe him in his wofull case,   
- If she might be his remedy.   
- And thus they say to ease his smart,   
- She made him owner of her hart.   
-   And truth it is except they lye,   
- From that day forth her study went,   
- To shew to loue him faithfully,   
- And his whole minde full to content.   
- So happy a man at last was he,   
- And eke so worthy a woman she.   
-   Lo lady then iudge you by this,   
- Mine ease and how my case dothe fall,   
- For sure betwene my life and his,   
- No difference there is at all.   
- His care was great so was his paine,   
- And mine is not the lest of twaine.       
-   For what he felt in seruice true   
- For her whom that he loued so,   
- The same I fele as large for you,   
- To whom I do my seruice owe,   
- There was that time in him no payne,   
- But now the same in me dothe raine.   
-   Which if you can compare and waye,   
- And how I stande in euery plight,   
- Then this for you I dare well saye,   
- Your hart must nedes remorce of right   
- To graunt me grace and so to do,   
- As Creside then did Troylus to.   
-   For well I wot you are as good   
- And euen as faire as euer was shee,   
- And commen of as worthy bloode,   
- And haue in you as large pitie.   
- To tender me your owne true man,

- Was neuer seen so fearce a fight, I scarce could scape with life.   
- Resist so long I did, till death approched so nye,   
- To saue my selfe I thought it best, with spede away to fly.   
- In daunger still I fled, by flight I thought to scape   
- From my dere foe, it vailed not, alas it was to late.   
- For venus from her campe brought Cupide with hys bronde,   
- Who sayd now yelde, or els desire shall chace the in euery londe.   
- Yet would I not straite yelde, till fansy fiersly stroke,   
- Who from my will did cut the raines and charged me w[ith] this yoke   
- Then all the dayes and nightes mine eare might heare the sound,   
- What carefull sighes my heart would steale to fele it self so bound   
- For though within my brest, thy care I worke he sayd,   
- Why for good wyll didest thou behold her persing iye displayde.   
- Alas the fishe is caught, through baite, that hides the hoke,   
- Euen so her eye me trained hath, and tangled with her loke.   
- But or that it be long, my hart thou shalt be faine,   
- To stay my life pray her furththrowe swete lokes wha[n] I co[m]plaine   
- When that she shall deny, to doe me that good turne,   
- Then shall she see to asshes gray, by flames my body burne.   
- Desearte of blame to her, no wight may yet impute,   
- For feare of nay I neuer sought, the way to frame my sute.   
- Yet hap that what hap shall, delay I may to long,   
- Assay I shall for I here say, the still man oft hath wrong.

- And wretched life for to amende.   
-   Yet goeth the mill within my hart,   
- Which gryndeth nought but paine and wo:   
- And turneth all my ioye to smart,

-   Though Venus smile with yeldyng eyes,

- Begin in game and ende in wo.   
-   And now by vse so swift it goeth,   
- That nothing can mine eares so fil:   
- But that the clacke it ouergoeth,   
- And plucketh me backe into the myll.   
-   But since the mill will nedes about,   
- The pinne wheron the whele dothe go:   
- I wyll assaye to strike it out,   
- And so the myll to ouerthrow.

## Svch waiward waies

  Of the sutteltye of craftye louers.   

  - Svch waiward waies haue some when folly stirres their braines   
- To fain & plaine full oft of loue when lest they fele his paynes.   
- And for to shew a griefe such craft haue they in store,   
- That they can halt and lay a salue wheras they fele no sore.   
- As hounde vnto the fote, or dogge vnto the bow,   
- So are they made to vent her out whom bent to loue they know   
- That if I should discribe on hundred of their driftes   
- Two hu[n]dred witts beside mine owne I should put to their shiftes   
- No woodman better knowes how for to lodge his dere,   
- Nor shypman on the sea that more hath skill to guide the stere   
- Nor beaten dogge to herd can warer chose his game,   
- Nor scholeman to his fansy can a scholer better frame.   
- Then one of these which haue olde Ouids art in vre,   
- Can seke the wayes vnto their minde a woman to allure.   
- As rounde about a hiue the bees do swarme alway,   
- So rounde about [the] house they prease wherin they seke their pray.   
- And whom they so besege, it is a wonderous thing,   
- What crafty engins to assault these wily warriers bring.   
- The eye as scout and watch to stirre both to and fro,       
- Doth serue to stale her here & there where she doth come and go,   
- The tonge doth plede for right as herauld of the hart:   
- And both the handes as oratours do serue to point theyr part.   
- So shewes the countinaunce then with these fowre to agree,   
- As though in witnes with the rest it wold hers sworne be.   
- But if she then mistrust it would turne black to whyte,   
- For that the woorrier lokes most smoth whe[n] he wold fainest bite.   
- Then wit as counsellor a help for this to fynde:   
- Straight makes [the] hand as secretayr forthwith to write his minde   
- And so the letters straight embassadours are made,   
- To treate in hast for to procure her to a better trade.   
- Wherin if she do think all this is but a shewe,   
- Or but a subtile masking cloke to hyde a craft ye[^]: craftye

 shrewe.   
- Then come they to the larme, then shew they in the fielde,   
- Then muster they in colours strange that wayes to make her yeld   
- Then shoote they batrye of, then compasse they her in,   
- At tilte and turney oft they striue this selly soule to win.   
- Then sound they on their Lutes then strain they forth their so[n]ge,   
- Then romble they with instrumentes to laye her quite a long.   
- Then borde they her with giftes then doe they woe and watche,   
- Then night and day they labour hard this simple holde to catche.   
- As pathes within a woode, or turnes within a mase:   
- So then they shewe of wyles & craftes they can a thousand wayes

- Shall fynd wher playnesse semes to hau[n]t nothing but craft appere   
- For with indifferent eyes my self can well discerne,   
- How some to guide a ship in stormes seke for to take the sterne.   
- Whose practise yf were proued in calme to stere a barge,   
- Assuredly beleue it well it were to great a charge.   
- And some I see agayne sit styll and saye but small,   
- That could do ten tymes more than they that saye they can do all.   
- Whose goodly giftes are such the more they vnderstande,   
- The more they seke to learne and knowe & take lesse charge in ha[n]d   
- And to declare more plain the tyme fletes not so fast:   
- But I can beare full well in minde the songe now sou[n]ge and past.   
- The authour wherof came wrapt in a craftye cloke:       
- With will to force a flamyng fire where he could raise no smoke.   
- If power and will had ioynde as it appeareth plaine,   
- The truth nor right had tane no place their vertues had ben vain.   
- So that you may perceiue, and I may safely se,   
- The innocent that giltlesse is, condemned should haue be.

  - As Lawrell leaues that cease not to be grene,   
- From parching sunne, nor yet from winters thrette:   
- As hardened oke that fearth no sworde so kene,   
- As flint for toole in twaine that will not frette.   
- As fast as rocke or piller surely set   
- So fast am I to you and aye haue bene.   
- Assuredly whom I can not forget,   
- For ioy, for paine, for torment nor for tene.   
- For losse, for gayne, for frownyng, nor for thret.   
- But euer one, yea bothe in calme or blast,   
- Your faithfull frende, and will be to my last.   
    
## False may he be

  Against him that had slaundered a gentlewoman with him selfe   

  - False may he be, and by the powers aboue,   
- Neuer haue he good spede or lucke in loue.   
- That so can lye or spot the worthy fame,   
- Of her for whom thou .R. art to blame.   
- For chaste Diane that hunteth still the chase,   
- And all her maides that sue her in the race.   
- With faire bowes bent and arrowes by their side,   
- Can saye that thou in this hast falsely lied.   
- For neuer honge the bow vpon the wall,   
- Of Dianes temple no nor neuer shall.   
- Of broken chaste the sacred vowe to spot,   
- Of her whom thou doste charge so large I wot.   
- But if ought be wherof her blame may rise,   
- It is in that she did not well aduise   
- To marke the right as now she dothe thee know,   
- False of thy dedes false of thy talke also.   
- Lurker of kinde like serpent layd to bite,       
- As poyson hid vnder the suger white.   
- What daunger suche? So was the house defilde,   
- Of Collatiue: so was the wife begilde.   
- So smarted she, and by a trayterous force,   
- The Cartage quene so she fordid her corse.   
- So strangled was the R. so depe can auoyde,   
- Fye traytour fye, to thy shame be it sayd,   
- Thou dunghyll crowe that crokest agaynst the rayne,   
- Home to thy hole, brag not with Phebe agayne.   
- Carrion for the and lothsome be thy voyce,   
- Thy song is fowle I wery of thy noyce.   
- Thy blacke fethers, which are thy wearyng wede.   
- Wet them with teares and sorowe for thy dede.   
- And in darke caues, where yrkesome wormes do crepe,   
- Lurke thou all daye, and flye when thou shouldest slepe.   
- And neuer light where liuyng thing hath life,   
- But eat and drinke where stinche and filthe is rife.   
- For she that is a fowle of fethers bryght,   
- Admit she toke some pleasure in thy sight.   
- As fowle of state sometimes delight to take,   
- Fowle of meane sort their flight with them to make.   
- For play of winge or solace of their kinde:   
- But not in sort as thou dost breke thy mynde.   
- Not for to treade with such foule fowle as thou,   
- No no I swere and I dare it here auowe.   
- Thou neuer settest thy fote within her nest,   
- Boast not so broade then to thine owne vnrest.   
- But blushe for shame for in thy face it standes,   
- And thou canst not vnspot it with thy handes.   
- For all the heauens against thee recorde beare,   
- And all in earth against thee eke will sweare.   
- That thou in this art euen none other man,   
- But as the iudges were to Susan than.   
- Forgers of that where to their lust them prickt,   
- Bashe, blaser then the truth hath thee conuict.   
- And she a woman of her worthy fame,   
- Vnspotted standes, and thou hast caught the shame.   
- And there I pray to God that it may rest,   
- False as thou art, as false as is the best,   
- That so canst wrong the noble kinde of man,   
- In whom all trouth furst floorist and began.   
- And so hath stande till now the wretched part,       
- Hath spotted vs of whose kinde one thou art.   
- That all the shame that euer rose or may,   
- Of shamefall dede on thee may light I saye.   
- And on thy kinde, and thus I wishe thee rather,   
- That all thy sede may like be to their father.   
- Vntrue as thou, and forgers as thou art,   
- So as all we be blamelesse of thy part.   
- And of thy dede. And thus I do thee leaue,   
- Still to be false, and falsely to deceaue.   
    
## I heard when Fame

  A praise of maistresse Ryce.   

  - I Heard when Fame with thundryng voice did sommon to appere   
- The chiefe of natures children all that kinde had placed here.   
- To view what brute by vertue got their liues could iustly craue,   
- And bade the[m] shew what praise by truth they worthy were to haue   
- Wherwith I saw how Venus came and put her selfe in place,   
- And gaue her ladies leue at large to stand and pleade their case.   
- Eche one was calde by name arowe, in that assemble there,   
- That hence are gone or here remaines in court or otherwhere.   
- A solemne silence was proclaimde, the iudges sate and heard,   
- What truth could tell or craft could faine, & who should be preferd.   
- Then beauty stept before the barre, whose brest and neck was bare   
- With heare trust vp and on her head a caule of gold she ware.   
- Thus Cupides thralles began to flock whose hongry eyes did say   
- That she had stayned all the dames that present were that day.   
- For er she spake w[ith] whispring words, the prease was filde through-out[^]: 1 syllable from following line

  
- And fansy forced common voyce therat to geue a shoute.   
- Which cried to fame take forth thy trump, & sound her praise on hie   
- That glads the hart of euery wight that her beholdes with eye.   
- What stirre and rule (quod order than) do these rude people make,   
- We holde her best that shall deserue a praise for vertues sake.   
- This sentence was no soner said but beauty therewith blusht,   
- The audience ceased with the same, and euery thing was whusht.   
- Then finenesse thought by trainyng talke to win that beauty lost,   
- And whet her tonges with ioly wordes, and spared for no cost.   
- Yet wantonnesse could not abide, but brake her tale in haste,   
- And peuishe pride for pecockes plumes wold nedes be hiest plast.   
- And therwithall came curiousnesse and carped out of frame.       
- The audience laught to here the strife as they beheld the same.   
- Yet reason sone appesde the brute, her reuerence made and don,   
- She purchased fauour for to speake and thus her tale begoon,   
- Sins bountye shall the garland were and crowned be by fame,   
- O happy iudges call for her for she deserues the same.   
- Where te[m]perance gouernes bewtyes flowers & glory is not sought   
- And shamefast mekenes mastreth pride & vertue dwels in thought   
- Byd her come forth and shew her face or els assent eche one,   
- That true report shall graue her name in gold or marble stone.   
- For all the world to rede at will what worthines doth rest,   
- In perfect pure vnspotted life which she hath here possest.   
- Then skill rose vp and sought the preace to find if [that] he might   
- A person of such honest name that men should praise of right.   
- This one I saw full sadly sit and shrinke her self a side,   
- Whose sober lokes did shew what gifts her wiefly grace did hide   
- Lo here (quod skill, good people all) is Lucrece left aliue,   
- And she shall most excepted be that lest for praise did striue.   
- No lenger fame could hold her peace, but blew a blast so hye,   
- That made an eckow in the ayer and sowning through the sky.   
- The voice was loude & thus it sayd come Rise with happy daies,   
- Thy honest life hath wonne the fame & crowned thee with praies.   
- And when I heard my maistres name I thrust amids the throng.   
- And clapt my handes and wisht of god [that] she might prosper long.

- But he haue other fele then outward sight,   
- The lack wherof doth hate and spite to trie   
- Thus kind thy craft is let of vertues light:   
- See how the outward shew the wittes may dull:   
- Not of the wise but as the most entend,   
- Minerua yet might neuer perce their scull,   
- That Circes cup and Cupides brand hath blend.       
- Whose fonde affects now sturred haue their braine,   
- So dothe thy hap thy hue with colour staine.   
- Beauty thy foe thy shape doubleth thy sore,   
- To hide thy wit and shewe thy vertue vayne,   
- Fell were thy fate, if wisdome were not more.   
- I meane by thee euen G. by name,   
- Whom stormy windes of enuy and disdaine,   
- Do tosse with boisteous blastes of wicked fame.   
- Where stedfastnesse as chiefe in thee dothe raigne,   
- Pacience thy setled minde dothe guide and stere,   
- Silence and shame with many resteth there.   
- Till time thy mother list them forth to call,

- Which merite not a heauens gift to kepe)   
- Thou must with me bewaile that fate hath reuen,   
- From earth a iewell laied in earth to slepe.   
-   A iewell, yea a gemme of womanhed,   
- Whose perfect vertues linked as in chaine:   
- So did adorne that humble wiuelyhed,   
- As is not rife to finde the like againe.   
-   For wit and learnyng framed to obey,   
- Her husbandes will that willed her to vse   
- The loue he bare her chiefely as a staye,   
- For all her frendes that would her furtherance chuse.   
-   Well sayd therfore a heauens gift she was,   
- Because the best are sonest hence bereft:   
- And though her selfe to heauen hence did passe,   
- Her spoyle to earth from whence it came she left.   
-   And to vs teares her absence to lament,   
- And eke his chance that was her make by lawe:

-   So fine was neuer yet the cloth,   
- No smith so harde his yron did beate:   
- But thone consumed was with mothe,   
- Thother with canker all to fret.   
-   The knotty oke and weinscot old,   
- Within dothe eat the silly worme:   
- Euen so a minde in enuy rold,   
- Alwayes within it self doth burne.   
-   Thus euery thing that nature wrought,   
- Within it self his hurt doth beare:

## Walkyng the pathe

  The dispairyng louer lamenteth.   

  - Walkyng the pathe of pensiue thought,   
- I askt my hart how came this wo.   
- Thine eye (quod he) this care me brought.   
- Thy minde, thy witte, thy will also   
- Enforceth me to loue her euer,   
- This is the cause ioye shall I neuer.   
-   And as I walkt as one dismayde,   
- Thinkyng that wrong this wo me lent:   
- Right, sent me worde by wrath, which sayd,   
- This iust iudgement to thee is sent:   
- Neuer to dye, but diyng euer,   
- Till breath thee faile, ioy shalt thou neuer.   
-   Sithe right doth iudge this wo tendure,   
- Of health, of wealth, of remedy:   
- As I haue done so be she sure,   
- Of fayth and trouth vntill I dye.   
- And as this payne cloke shall I euer,   
- So inwardly ioye shall I neuer.   
-   Gripyng of gripes greue not so sore,   
- Nor serpentes styng causeth such smarte,   
- Nothing on earth may payne me more,   
- Then sight that perst my wofull hart.   
- Drowned with cares styll to perseuer,   
- Come death betimes, ioye shall I neuer.   
-   O libertie why doest thou swarue,   
- And steale away thus all at ones:   
- And I in pryson like to sterue,   
- For lacke of fode do gnaw on bones.   
- My hope and trust in thee was euer,   
- Now thou art gone ioye shall I neuer.   
-   But styll as one all desperate,   
- To leade my life in miserie:   
- Sith feare from hope hath lockt the gate,   
- Where pity should graunt remedye.       
- Dispaire this lotte assignes me euer,   
- To liue in payne. Ioee shall I neuer.   
    
## From worldly wo

  An epitaph of maister Henry williams.   

  - From worldly wo the mede of misbeliefe,   
- From cause of care that leadeth to lament,   
- From vaine delight the grounde of greater griefe,   
- From feare from frendes, from matter to repent,   
- From painfull panges last sorow that is sent.   
- From drede of death sithe death dothe set vs free,   
- With it the better pleased should we be.   
-   This lothsome life where likyng we do finde,   
- Thencreaser of our crimes: dothe vs beriue,   
- Our blisse that alway ought to be in minde.   
- This wyly worlde whiles here we breath aliue,   
- And fleshe our fayned fo, do stifely striue   
- To flatter vs assuryng here the ioye,   
- Where we alas do finde but great annoy.   
-   Vntolde heapes though we haue of worldly welth,   
- Though we possesse the sea and frutefull grounde,   
- Strength, beauty, knowledge, and vnharmed helth,   
- Though at our wishe all pleasure do abound.   
- It were but vaine, no frendship can be founde,   
- When death assaulteth with his dredfull dart.   
- No raunsome can stay the home hastyng hart.   
-   And sithe thou hast cut the liues line in twaine,   
- Of Henry, sonne to sir Iohn Williams knight,   
- Whose manly hart and prowes none coulde stayne.   
- Whose godly life to vertue was our light,   
- Whose worthy fame shall florishe long by right.   
- Though in this life so cruell mightest thou be,   
- His spirite in heauen shall triumph ouer thee.   
    
## To false report

  Against a gentlewoman by whom he was refused.   

  - To false report and flying fame,   
- While erst my minde gaue credite light,       
- Beleuyng that her bolstred name   
- Had stuffe to shew that praise did hight.   
- I finde well now I did mistake,   
- Vpon report my gounde[^]: grounde

 to make.   
-   I hearde it sayd such one was she,   
- As rare to finde as parragon,   
- Of lowly cheare of heart so free,   
- As her for bounty could passe none.   
- Such one sofaire[^]: so faire

 though forme and face,   
- Were meane to passe in seconde place.   
-   I sought it neare thinkyng to finde,   
- Report and dede both to agree:   
- But chaunge had tride her suttell minde,   
- Of force I was enforced to see,   
- That she in dede was nothing so,   
- Which made my will my hart forgo.   
-   For she is such as geason none,   
- And what she most may bost to be:   
- I finde her matches mo then one,   
- What nede she so to deale with me?   
- Ha flering face with scornefull harte,   
- So yll rewarde for good desert?   
-   I will repent that I haue done,   
- To ende so well the losse is small,   
- I lost her loue, that lesse hath wonne,   
- To vaunt she had me as her thrall.   
- What though a gyllot sent that note,   
- By cocke and pye I meant it not.   
    
## Lo here lieth G.

  An epitaphe written by w. G.  to be set vpon his owne graue.   

  - Lo here lieth G. vnder the grounde,   
- Emong the greedy wormes:   
- Which in his life time neuer founde,   
- But strife and sturdy stormes.   
-   And namely through a wicked wife,   
- As to the worlde apperes:       
- She was the shortnyng of his life   
- By many daies and yeres.   
-   He might haue liued long god wot,   
- His yeres they were but yong:   
- Of wicked wiues this is the lot,   
- To kill with spitefull tong.   
-   Whose memory shall still remaine,   
- In writyng here with me:   
- That men may know whom she hath slaine.   
- And say this same is she.   
    
## If that thy wicked wife

  An aunswere.   

  - If that thy wicked wife had spon the thred,   
- And were the weauer of thy wo:   
- Then art thou double happy to be dead,   
-   As happily dispatched so.   
- If rage did causelesse cause thee to complaine,   
-   And mad moode mouer of thy mone:   
- If frensy forced on thy testy braine:   
-   Then blist is she to liue alone.   
- So, whether were the ground of others griefe,   
-   Because so doutfull was the dome:   
- Now death hath brought your payne a right reliefe,   
-   And blessed be ye bothe become:   
- She that she liues no lenger bounde to beare   
-   The rule of such a frowarde hed:   
- Thou that thou liuest no lenger faine to feare   
-   The restlesse ramp that thou hadst wedde.   
- Be thou as glad therfore that thou art gone,   
-   As she is glad she dothe abide.   
- For so ye be a sonder, all is one:   
-   A badder match cad[^]: can

 not betide.   
    
## A man may liue

  Against women either good or badde.   

  - A Man may liue thrise Nestors life,   
- Thrise wander out Vlisses race:       
- Yet neuer finde Vlisses wife.   
- Such chaunge hath chanced in this case.   
-   Lesse age will serue than Paris had,   
- Small peyn (if none be small inough)   
- To finde good store of Helenes trade.   
- Such sap the rote dothe yelde the bough.   
-   For one good wife Vlisses slew   
- A worthy knot of gentle blood:   
- For one yll wife Grece ouerthrew   
- The towne of Troy. Sith bad and good   
- Bring mischiefe: Lord, let be thy will,   
- To kepe me free from either yll.   
    
## The vertue of Vlisses wife

  An answere.   

  - The vertue of Vlisses wife   
- Dothe liue, though she hath ceast her race,   
- And farre surmountes old Nestors life:   
- But now in moe than then it was.   
- Such change is chanced in this case.   
-   Ladyes now liue in other trade:   
- Farre other Helenes now we see,   
- Than she whom Troyan Paris had.   
- As vertue fedes the roote, so be   
- The sap and frute of bough and tree.   
-   Vlisses rage, not his good wife,   
- Spilt gentle blood. Not Helenes face,   
- But Paris eye did rayse the strife,   
- That did the Troyan buildyngs race.   
- Thus sithe ne good, ne bad do yll:   
- Them all, O Lord, maintain my will,   
- To serue with all my force and skyll.   
    
## Procryn that some tyme

  The louer praieth his seruice to be accepted and his defaultes pardoned.       

  - Procryn that some tyme serued Cephalus,   
- With hart as true as any louer might,   
- Yet her betyd in louyng this vnright.   
- That as in hart with loue surprised thus,   
- She on a daye to see this Cephalus,   
- Where he was wont to shrowde him in the shade,   
- When of his huntyng he an ende had made.   
- Within the woddes with dredfull fote she stalketh,   
- So busily loue in her hedde it walketh.   
- That she to sene him may her not restrayne.   
- This Cephalus that heard one shake the leaues,   
- Vprist all egre thrustyng after pray,   
- With darte in hande him list no further dayne,   
- To see his loue but slew her in the greues,   
- That ment to him but perfect loue alway.   
-   So curious bene alas the rites all,   
- Of mighty loue that vnnethes may I thinke,   
- In his high seruice how to loke or winke,   
- Thus I complaine that wrechedest am of all.   
- To you my loue and souerayne lady dere,   
- That may myne hart with death or life stere   
- As ye best list. That ye vouchsafe in all   
- Mine humble seruice. And if that me misfall,   
- By negligence, or els for lacke of witte,   
- That of your mercy you do pardon it,   
- And thinke that loue made Procrin shake the leaues,   
- When with vnright she slayne was in the greues.   
    
## Lyke the Phenix

  Description and praise of his loue.   

  - Lyke the Phenix a birde most rare in sight   
- With golde and purple that nature hath drest:   
- Such she me semes in whom I most delight,   
- If I might speake for enuy at the least.   
- Nature I thinke first wrought her in despite,   
- Of rose and lillye that sommer bringeth first,       
- In beauty sure excedyng all the rest,   
- Vnder the bent of her browes iustly pight:   
- As polisht Diamondes, or Saphires at the least:   
- Her glistryng lightes the darkenesse of the night.   
- Whose little mouth and chinne like all the rest.   
- Her ruddy lippes excede the corall quite.   
- Her yuery teeth where none excedes the rest.   
- Faultlesse she is from fote vnto the waste.   
- Her body small and straight as mast vpright.   
- Her armes long in iust proporcion cast,   
- Her handes depaint with veines all blew and white.   
- What shall I say for that is not in sight?   
- The hidden partes I iudge them by the rest.   
- And if I were the forman of the quest,   
- To geue a verdite of her beauty bright,   
- Forgeue me Phebus, thou shouldst be dispossest,   
- Which doest vsurpe my ladies place of right.   
- Here will I cease lest enuy cause dispite.   
- But nature when she wrought so fayre a wight,   
- In this her worke she surely did entende,   
- To frame a thing that God could not amende.   
    
## To trust the fayned face

  An answere to a song before imprinted beginnyng. To walke on doutfull   grounde.   

  - To trust the fayned face, to rue on forced teares,   
- To credit finely forged tales, wherin there oft appeares   
-   And breathes as from the brest a smoke of kindled smart,   
- Where onely lurkes a depe deceit within the hollow hart,   
-   Betrayes the simple soule, whom plaine deceitlesse minde   
- Taught not to feare that in it self it self did neuer finde.   
-   Not euery tricklyng teare doth argue inward paine:   
- Not euery sigh dothe surely shewe the sigher not to fayne:   
-   Not euery smoke dothe proue a presence of the fire:   
- Not euery glistring geues the golde, that gredy folke desire:   
-   Not euery wailyng word is drawen out of the depe:       
- Not griefe for want of graunted grace enforceth all to wepe.   
-   Oft malice makes the minde to shed the boyled brine:   
- And enuies humor oft vnlades by conduites of the eyen.   
-   Oft craft can cause the man to make a semyng show   
- Of hart with dolour all distreined, where griefe did neuer grow.   
-   As cursed Crocodile most cruelly can toll.   
- With truthlesse teares, vnto his death, the silly pitiyng soule.   
-   Blame neuer those therfore, that wisely can beware   
- The guillful man, that suttly sayth him selfe to dread the snare.   
-   Blame not the stopped eares against the Syrenes song:   
- Blame not the mind not moued w[ith] mone of falsheds flowing tong.   
-   If guile do guide your wit by silence so to speake,   
- By craft to craue and faine by fraude the cause [that] you wold breake:   
-   Great harme your suttle soule shall suffer for the same:   
- And mighty loue will wreke the wrong so cloked with his name.   
-   But we, whom you haue warnde, this lessor[^]: lesson

 learne by you:   
- To know the tree before we clime, to trust no rotten bowe,   
-   To view the limed bushe, to loke afore we light,   
- To shunne the perilous bayted hoke, and vse a further sight.   
-   As do the mouse, the birde, the fishe, by sample fitly show,   
- That wyly wittes and ginnes of men do worke the simples wo:   
-   So, simple sithe we are, and you so suttle be,   
- God help the mouse, the birde, [the] fishe, & vs your sleights to fle.

## Syns fortunes wrath

  The constant louer lamenteth. 

  - Syns fortunes wrath enuieth the welth,   
- Wherin I raygned by the sight:   
- Of that that fed mine eyes by stelth,   
- With sower swete, dreade, and delight.   
- Let not my griefe moue you to mone,   
- For I will wepe and wayle alone.   
-   Spite draue me into Borias raigne,   
- Where hory frostes the frutes do bite,   
- When hilles were spred and euery playne:   
- With stormy winters mantle white.   
- And yet my deare such was my heate,   
- When others frese then did I swete.   
-   And now though on the sunne I driue,   
- Whose feruent flame all thinges decaies,   
- His beames in brightnesse may not striue,   
- With light of your swete golden rayes,   
- Nor from my brest this heate remoue,   
- The frosen thoughtes grauen by loue.   
-   Ne may the waues of the salt floode,   
- Quenche that your beauty set on fire,   
- For though mine eyes forbere the fode,   
- That did releue the hote desire.   
- Such as I was such will I be,   
- Your owne, what would ye more of me.   
    
## In the rude age

  A praise of sir Thomas wyate thelder for his excellent learning.   

  - In the rude age when knowledge was not rife,   
- If Ioue in Create and other were that taught,   
- Artes to conuert to profite of our life,   
- Wende after death to haue their temples sought,   
- If vertue yet no voyde vnthankefull time,       
- Failed of some to blast her endles fame,   
- A goodly meane both to deterre from crime:   
- And to her steppes our sequele to enflame,   
- In dayes of truth if wyates frendes then wayle,   
- The only det that dead of quick may claime:   
- That rare wit spent employd to our auaile.   
- Where Christ is taught we led to vertues traine.   
- His liuely face their brestes how did it freat,   
- Whose cindres yet with enuye they do eate.   
    
## Eche beast can chose

  [^]: line preceded by a paragraph sign

  A song written by the earle of Surrey by a lady that refused to   daunce with him.   

  - Eche beast can chose hys fere according to his minde,   
- And eke can shew a frendly chere like to their beastly kinde.   
-   A Lion saw I late as white as any snow,   
- Which semed well to lead the race his port the same did show.   
-   Vpon the gentle beast to gaze it pleased me,   
- For still me thought he semed well of noble blood to be.   
-   And as he praunced before, still seking for a make,   
- As who wold say there is none here I trow will me forsake.   
-   I might parceiue a wolfe as white as whales bone,   
- A fairer beast of fresher hue beheld I neuer none.   
-   Saue that her lokes were coy, and froward eke her grace,   
- Vnto the which this gentle beast gan him aduance apace.   
-   And with a beck full low he bowed at herfeete,[^]: her feete

  
- In humble wise as who would say I am to farre vnmete.   
-   But such a scornefull chere wherwith she him rewarded,   
- Was neuer sene I trow the like to such as well deserued.   
-   With that she start aside welnere a fote or twaine,   
- And vnto him thus gan she say with spite and great disdaine.   
-   Lyon she sayd if thou hadst knowen my mind before,   
- Thou hadst not spent thy trauail thus nor al thy paine forlore.   
-   Do way I let the wete thou shalt not play with me,   
- Go range about where thou mayst finde some meter fere for the:   
-   With that he bet his taile, his eyes began to flame,   
- I might perceiue hys noble hart much moued by the same.   
-   Yet saw I him refraine and eke his wrath aswage,   
- And vnto her thus gan he say when he was past his rage.       
-   Cruell, you do me wrong to set me thus so light,   
- Without desert for my good will to shew me such despight.   
-   How can ye thus entreat a Lion of the race,   
- That with his pawes a crowned king deuoured in the place:   
-   Whose nature is to pray vpon no simple food,   
- As long as he may suck the fleshe, and drink of noble blood.   
-   If you be faire and fresh, am I not of your hue?   
- And for my vaunt I dare well say my blood is not vntrue.   
-   For you your self haue heard it is not long agoe,   
- Sith that for loue one of the race did end his life in woe   
-   In tower strong and hie for his assured truthe,   
- Where as in teares he spent his breath, alas the more the ruthe.   
-   This gentle beast likewise whom nothing could remoue,   
- But willingly to lese his life for losse of his true loue.   
-   Other there be whose liues doe lingre still in paine,   
- Against their willes preserued ar that would haue died faine.   
-   But now I doe perceue that nought it moueth you,   
- My good entent, my gentle hart, nor yet my kind so true.   
-   But that your will is such to lure me to the trade,   
- As other some full many yeres to trace by craft ye made.   
-   And thus behold our kyndes how that we differ farre.   
- I seke my foes: and you your frendes do threten still with warre.   
-   I fawne where I am fled: you slay that sekes to you,   
- I can deuour no yelding pray: you kill where you subdue.   
-   My kinde is to desire the honoure of the field:   
- And you with blood to slake your thirst on such as to you yeld.   
-   Wherfore I would you wist that for your coyed lokes,   
- I am no man that will be trapt nor tangled with such hokes.   
-   And though some lust to loue where blame full well they might   
- And to such beasts of currant sort that should haue trauail bright.   
-   I will obserue the law that nature gaue to me,   
- To conquer such as will resist and let the rest goe fre.   
-   And as a faucon free that soreth in the ayre,   
- Which neuer fed on hand nor lure, nor for no stale doth care,   
-   While that I liue and breath such shall my custome be,   
- In wildnes of the woodes to seke my pray where pleseth me.   
-   Where many one shal ruse, that neuer made offense.   
- This your refuse against my power shall bode them ne defence.   
-   And for reuenge therof I vow and swere therto,   
- I thousand spoiles I shall commit I neuer thought to do.   
-   And if to light on you my luck so good shall be,   
- I shall be glad to fede on that that would haue fed on me.       
-   And thus farewell vnkinde to whom I bent and bow,   
- I would ye wist the ship is safe that bare his sailes so low.   
-   Sith that a lions hart is for a wolfe no pray,   
- With bloody mouth go slake your thirst on simple shepe I say.   
-   With more dispite and ire than I can now expresse,   
- Which to my pain though I refraine the cause you may wel gesse.   
-   As for because my self was aucthor of the game,   
- It bootes me not that for my wrath I should disturbe the same.   
    
## If care do cause men cry

  The faithfull louer declareth his paines and his vncertein ioies, and with   only hope recomforteth somwhat his wofull heart.   

  - If care do cause men cry, why do not I complaine?   
- If eche man do bewaile his wo, why shew I not my paine?   
-   Since that amongest them all I dare well say is none,   
- So farre from weale, so full of wo, or hath more cause to mone.   
-   For all thynges hauing life sometime haue quiet rest.   
- The bering asse, the drawing oxe, and euery other beast.   
-   The peasant and the post, that serue at al assayes,   
- The shyp boy and the galley slaue haue time to take their ease,   
-   Saue I alas whom care of force doth so constraine   
- To waile the day and wake the night continually in paine,   
-   From pensiuenes to plaint, from plaint to bitter teares,   
- From teares to painfull plaint againe: and thus my life it wears.   
-   No thing vnder the sunne that I can here or se,   
- But moueth me for to bewaile my cruell destenie.   
-   For wher men do reioyce since that I can not so,   
- I take no pleasure in that place, it doubleth but my woe.   
-   And when I heare the sound of song or instrument,   
- Me thinke eche tune there dolefull is and helpes me to lament.   
-   And if I se some haue their most desired sight,   
- Alas think I eche man hath weal saue I most wofull wight.   
-   Then as the striken dere withdrawes him selfe alone,   
- So doe I seke some secrete place where I may make my mone.   
-   There do my flowing eyes shew forth my melting hart,   
- So [that] the stremes of those two welles right wel declare my smart       
-   And in those cares so colde I force my selfe a heate,   
- As sick men in their shaking fittes procure them self to sweate,   
-   With thoughtes that for the time do much appease my paine.   
- But yet they cause a ferther fere and brede my woe agayne.   
-   Me thinke within my thought I se right plaine appere,   
- My hartes delight my sorowes leche mine earthly goddesse here.   
-   With euery sondry grace that I haue sene her haue,   
- Thus I within my wofull brest her picture paint and graue.   
-   And in my thought I roll her bewties to and fro,   
- Her laughing chere her louely looke my hart that perced so.   
-   Her strangenes when I sued her seruant for to be,   
- And what she sayd and how she smiled when that she pitied me.   
-   Then comes a sodaine feare that riueth all my rest   
- Lest absence cause forgetfulnes to sink within her brest.   
-   For when I thinke how far this earth doth vs deuide.   
- Alas me semes loue throwes me downe I fele how that I slide.   
-   But then I thinke againe why should I thus mistrust,   
- So swete a wight so sad and wise that is so true and iust.   
-   For loth she was to loue, and wauering is she not.   
- The farther of the more desirde thus louers tie their knot.   
-   So in dispaire and hope plonged am I both vp an doune,   
- As is the ship with wind and waue when Neptune list to froune.   
-   But as the watry showers delay the raging winde,   
- So doth good hope clene put away dispayre out of my minde.   
-   And biddes me for to serue and suffer pacientlie,   
- For what wot I the after weale that fortune willes to me.   
-   For those that care do knowe and tasted haue of trouble,   
- When passed is their woful paine eche ioy shall seme them double.   
-   And bitter sendes she now to make me tast the better,   
- The plesant swete when that it comes to make it seme the sweter.   
-   And so determine I to serue vntill my brethe.   
- Ye rather dye a thousand times then once to false my feithe.   
-   And if my feble corps through weight of wofull smart.   
- Do fayle or faint my will it is that still she kepe my hart.   
-   And when thys carcas here to earth shalbe refarde,   
- I do bequeth my weried ghost to serue her afterwarde.

## What word is that

  Of his loue called.  Anna.   

  - What word is that, that changeth not,   
- Though it be turned and made in twaine:   
- It is mine Anna god it wot.   
- The only causer of my paine:   
- My loue that medeth with disdaine.   
- Yet is it loued what will you more,   
- It is my salue, and eke my sore.   
    
## Venemous thornes

  That pleasure is mixed with euery paine.   

  - Venemous thornes that are so sharp and kene,   
- Beare flowers we se full fresh and faire of hue:   
- Poison is also put in medicine.   
- And vnto man his helth doth oft renue.   
- The fier that all thinges eke consumeth cleane   
- May hurt and heale: then if that this be true.   
- I trust sometime my harme may be my health,   
- Sins euery woe is ioyned with some wealth.   
    
## A lady gaue me a gift

  A riddle of a gift geuen by a Ladie. 

  - A Lady gaue me a gift she had not,   
- And I receyued her gift which I toke not,   
- She gaue it me willingly, and yet she would not,   
- and I receiued it, albeit, I could not,   
- If she giue it me, I force not,   
- And if she take it againe she cares not.   
- Conster what this is and tell not,   
- For I am fast sworne I may not.       
    
## Speake thou and spede

  That speaking or profering bringes alway speding.   

  - Speake thou and spede where will or power ought helpthe,   
- Where power dothe want will must be wonne by welth.   
- For nede will spede, where will workes not his kinde,   
- And gayne, thy foes thy frendes shall cause thee finde.   
- For sute and golde, what do not they obtaine,   
- Of good and bad the triers are these twaine.   
    
## If thou wilt mighty be

  He ruleth not though he raigne ouer realmes that is subiect to   his owne lustes.   

  - If thou wilt mighty be, flee from the rage   
- Of cruell wyll, and see thou kepe thee free   
- From the foule yoke of sensuall bondage,   
- For though thy empyre stretche to Indian sea,   
- And for thy feare trembleth the fardest Thylee,   
- If thy desire haue ouer thee the power,   
- Subiect then art thou and no gouernour.   
-   If to be noble and high thy minde be meued,   
- Consider well thy grounde and thy beginnyng:   
- For he that hath eche starre in heanen[^]: heauen

 fixed,   
- And geues the Moone her hornes and her eclipsyng:   
- Alike hath made the noble in his workyng,   
- So that wretched no way thou may bee,   
- Except foule lust and vice do conquere thee.   
-   All were it so thou had a flood of golde,   
- Vnto thy thirst yet should it not suffice.   
- And though with Indian stones a thousande folde,   
- More precious then can thy selfe deuise,   
- Ycharged were thy backe: thy couitise   
- And busye bytyng yet should neuer let,   
- Thy wretchid life ne do thy death profet.       
      
## Lyke as the birde

    whether libertie by losse of life,   or life in prison and thraldome be to be preferred.   

    - Lyke as the birde within the cage enclosed,   
- The dore vnsparred, her foe the hawke without,   
- Twixt death and prison piteously oppressed,   
- Whether for to chose standeth in doubt,   
- Lo, so do I, which seke to bryng about,   
- Which should be best by determinacion,   
- By losse of life libertie, or lyfe by pryson.   
-   O mischiefe by mischiefe to be redressed.   
- Where payne is best there lieth but little pleasure.   
- By short death better to be deliuered,   
- Than bide in paynefull life, thraldome, and dolore.   
- Small is the pleasure where much payne we suffer.   
- Rather therfore to chuse me thinketh wisdome,   
- By losse of life libertye, then life by prison.   
-   And yet me thinkes although I liue and suffer,   
- I do but wait a time and fortunes chance:   
- Oft many thinges do happen in one houre.   
- That which oppressed me now may me aduance.   
- In time is trust which by deathes greuance   
- Is wholy lost. Then were it not reason,   
- By death to chuse libertie, and not life by pryson.   
-   But death were deliuerance where life lengthes paine.   
- Of these two euyls let se now chuse the best:   
- This birde to deliuer that here dothe playne,   
- What saye ye louers? whiche shall be the best?   
- In cage thraldome, or by the hawke opprest.   
- And whiche to chuse make plaine conclusion,   
- By losse of life libertie, or life by pryson.
