                                   I 

           MRS. RANSOM, when the front door had closed on her visitor,   passed with a spring from the drawing-room to the narrow hall,  and   thence up the narrow stairs to her bedroom. 

       Though slender, and still light of foot, she did not always   move so quickly: hitherto, in her life, there had not been much  to   hurry for, save the recurring domestic tasks that compel haste   without fostering elasticity; but some impetus of youth revived,   communicated to her by her talk with Guy Dawnish, now found   expression in her girlish flight upstairs, her girlish impatience    to bolt herself into her room with her throbs and her blushes.  

       Her blushes?  Was she really blushing? 

       She approached the cramped "Colonial" mirror above her plain    prim dressing-table: just such a meagre concession to the  weakness   of the flesh as every old-fashioned house in Wentworth counted   among its heirlooms.  The face reflected in this unflattering   surface—for even the mirrors of Wentworth erred on the side of   depreciation—did not seem, at first sight, a suitable theatre  for   the display of the tenderer emotions, and its owner blushed more   deeply as the fact was forced upon her. 

       Her fair hair had grown too thin—it no longer quite hid the    blue veins in her candid forehead—a forehead that one seemed to   see turned toward professorial desks, in large bare halls where a    snowy winter light fell uncompromisingly on rows of "thoughtful   women."  Her mouth was thin, too, and a little strained; her lips    were too pale; and there were lines in the corners of her eyes.   It   was a face which had grown middle-aged while it waited for the  joys   of youth. 

       Well—but if she could still blush?  Instinctively she drew   back a little, so that her scrutiny became less microscopic, and   the pretty lingering pink threw a veil over her pallor, the  hollows   in her temples, the faint wrinkles of inexperience about her lips    and eyes.  How a little colour helped!  It made her eyes so deep   and shining.  She saw now why bad women rouged. . . .  Her  redness   deepened at the thought. 

       But suddenly she noticed for the first time that the collar  of   her dress was cut too low.  It showed the shrunken lines of the   throat.  She rummaged feverishly in a tidy scentless drawer, and   snatching out a bit of black velvet, bound it about her neck.    Yes—that was better.  It gave her the relief she needed.    Relief—contrast—that was it!  She had never had any, either in   her appearance or in her setting.  She was as flat as the pattern    of the wall-paper—and so was her life.  And all the people about    her had the same look.  Wentworth was the kind of place where   husbands and wives gradually grew to resemble each other—one or   two of her friends, she remembered, had told her lately that she   and Ransom were beginning to look alike. . . . 

       But why had she always, so tamely, allowed her aspect to   conform to her situation?  Perhaps a gayer exterior would have   provoked a brighter fate.  Even now—she turned back to the  glass,   loosened the tight strands of hair above her brow, ran the fine  end   of the comb under them with a rapid frizzing motion, and then   disposed them, more lightly and amply, above her eager face.   Yes—   it was really better; it made a difference.  She smiled at  herself   with a timid coquetry, and her lips seemed rosier as she smiled.     Then she laid down the comb and the smile faded.  It made a   difference, certainly—but was it right to try to make one's hair    look thicker and wavier than it really was?  Between that and   rouging the ethical line seemed almost impalpable, and the  spectre   of her rigid New England ancestry rose reprovingly before her.   She   was sure that none of her grandmothers had ever simulated a curl  or   encouraged a blush.    A blush, indeed!  What  had any of them   ever had to blush for in all their frozen lives?  And what, in   Heaven's name, had she?  She sat down in the stiff mahogany   rocking-chair beside her work-table and tried to collect herself.     >From childhood she had been taught to "collect herself"—but  never   before had her small sensations and aspirations been so widely   scattered, diffused over so vague and uncharted an expanse.    Hitherto they had lain in neatly sorted and easily accessible   bundles on the high shelves of a perfectly ordered moral   consciousness.  And now—now that for the first time they    * needed* collecting—now that the little winged and  scattered bits   of self were dancing madly down the vagrant winds of fancy, she   knew no spell to call them to the fold again.  The best way, no   doubt—if only her bewilderment permitted—was to go back to the   beginning—the beginning, at least, of to-day's visit—to   recapitulate, word for word and look for look. . . . 

       She clasped her hands on the arms of the chair, checked its   swaying with a firm thrust of her foot, and fixed her eyes upon  the   inward vision. . . . 

       To begin with, what had made to-day's visit so different  from   the others?  It became suddenly vivid to her that there had been   many, almost daily, others, since Guy Dawnish's coming to   Wentworth.  Even the previous winter—the winter of his arrival   from England—his visits had been numerous enough to make  Wentworth   aware that—very naturally—Mrs. Ransom was "looking after" the   stray young Englishman committed to her husband's care by an   eminent Q. C. whom the Ransoms had known on one of their brief   London visits, and with whom Ransom had since maintained   professional relations.  All this was in the natural order of   things, as sanctioned by the social code of Wentworth.  Every one    was kind to Guy Dawnish—some rather importunately so, as  Margaret   Ransom had smiled to observe—but it was recognized as fitting  that   she should be kindest, since he was in a sense her property,  since   his people in England, by profusely acknowledging her kindness,  had   given it the domestic sanction without which, to Wentworth, any   social relation between the sexes remained unhallowed and to be   viewed askance.  Yes!  And even this second winter, when the  visits   had become so much more frequent, so admitted a part of the day's    routine, there had not been, from any one, a hint of surprise or  of   conjecture. . . . 

       Mrs. Ransom smiled with a faint bitterness.  She was  protected   by her age, no doubt—her age and her past, and the image her   mirror gave back to her. . . . 

       Her door-handle turned suddenly, and the bolt's resistance  was   met by an impatient knock. 

       "Margaret!" 

       She started up, her brightness fading, and unbolted the door    to admit her husband. 

       "Why are you locked in?  Why, you're not dressed yet!" he   exclaimed. 

       It was possible for Ransom to reach his dressing-room by a   slight circuit through the passage; but it was characteristic of   the relentless domesticity of their relation that he chose, as a   matter of course, the directer way through his wife's bedroom.   She   had never before been disturbed by this practice, which she   accepted as inevitable, but had merely adapted her own habits to   it, delaying her hasty toilet till he was safely in his room, or   completing it before she heard his step on the stair; since a   scrupulous traditional prudery had miraculously survived this   massacre of all the privacies. 

       "Oh, I shan't dress this evening—I shall just have some tea    in the library after you've gone," she answered absently.  "Your   things are laid out," she added, rousing herself. 

       He looked surprised.  "The dinner's at seven.  I suppose the    speeches will begin at nine.  I thought you were coming to hear   them." 

       She wavered.  "I don't know.  I think not.  Mrs. Sperry's  ill,   and I've no one else to go with." 

       He glanced at his watch.  "Why not get hold of Dawnish?    Wasn't he here just now?  Why didn't you ask him?" 

       She turned toward her dressing-table, and straightened the   comb and brush with a nervous hand.  Her husband had given her,   that morning, two tickets for the ladies' gallery in Hamblin  Hall,   where the great public dinner of the evening was to take place—a    banquet offered by the faculty of Wentworth to visitors of aca- demic eminence—and she had meant to ask  Dawnish to go with   her: it had seemed the most natural thing to do, till the end of   his visit came, and then, after all, she had not spoken. . . .  

       "It's too late now," she murmured, bending over her pin   cushion. 

       "Too late?  Not if you telephone him." 

       Her husband came toward her, and she turned quickly to face   him, lest he should suspect her of trying to avoid his eye.  To   what duplicity was she already committed! 

       Ransom laid a friendly hand on her arm: "Come along,  Margaret.    You know I speak for the bar."  She was aware, in his voice, of a    little note of surprise at his having to remind her of this.  

       "Oh, yes.  I meant to go, of course—" 

       "Well, then—"  He opened his dressing-room door, and caught    a glimpse of the retreating house-maid's skirt.  "Here's Maria  now.    Maria!  Call up Mr. Dawnish—at Mrs. Creswell's, you know.  Tell   him Mrs. Ransom wants him to go with her to hear the speeches  this   evening—the * speeches*, you understand?—and he's to call  for   her at a quarter before nine." 

       Margaret heard the Irish "Yessir" on the stairs, and stood   motionless, while her husband added loudly: "And bring me some   towels when you come up."  Then he turned back into his wife's   room. 

       "Why, it would be a thousand pities for Guy to miss this.    He's so interested in the way we do things over here—and I don't    know that he's ever heard me speak in public."  Again the slight   note of fatuity!  Was it possible that Ransom was a fatuous man?  

       He paused in front of her, his short-sighted unobservant   glance concentrating itself unexpectedly on her face. 

       "You're not going like that, are you?" he asked, with  glaring   eye-glasses. 

       "Like what?" she faltered, lifting a conscious hand to the   velvet at her throat. 

       "With your hair in such a fearful mess.  Have you been   shampooing it?  You look like the Brant girl at the end of a   tennis-match." 

       The Brant girl was their horror—the horror of all right-thinking Wentworth; a laced, whale-boned, frizzle-headed, high-heeled daughter of iniquity, who came—from New York, of  course—on   long, disturbing, tumultuous visits to a Wentworth aunt, working   havoc among the freshmen, and leaving, when she departed, an  angry   wake of criticism that ruffled the social waters for weeks.     * She*, too, had tried her hand at Guy—with ludicrous  unsuccess.    And now, to be compared to her—to be accused of looking "New   Yorky!"  Ah, there are times when husbands are obtuse; and  Ransom,   as he stood there, thick and yet juiceless, in his dry legal  middle   age, with his wiry dust-coloured beard, and his perpetual *  pince-nez*, seemed to his wife a sudden embodiment of this  traditional   attribute.  Not that she had ever fancied herself, poor soul, a  *"   femme incomprise*."  She had, on the contrary, prided herself  on   being understood by her husband, almost as much as on her own   complete comprehension of him.  Wentworth laid a good deal of   stress on "motives"; and Margaret Ransom and her husband had  dwelt   in a complete community of motive.  It had been the proudest day  of   her life when, without consulting her, he had refused an offer of    partnership in an eminent New York firm because he preferred the   distinction of practising in Wentworth, of being known as the  legal   representative of the University.  Wentworth, in fact, had always    been the bond between the two; they were united in their  veneration   for that estimable seat of learning, and in their modest yet  vivid   consciousness of possessing its tone.  The Wentworth "tone" is   unmistakable: it permeates every part of the social economy, from    the * coiffure* of the ladies to the preparation of the  food.  It   has its sumptuary laws as well as its curriculum of learning.  It    sits in judgment not only on its own townsmen but on the rest of   the world—enlightening, criticising, ostracizing a heedless   universe—and non-conformity to Wentworth standards involves   obliteration from Wentworth's consciousness. 

       In a world without traditions, without reverence, without   stability, such little expiring centres of prejudice and  precedent   make an irresistible appeal to those instincts for which a   democracy has neglected to provide.  Wentworth, with its "tone,"   its backward references, its inflexible aversions and   condemnations, its hard moral outline preserved intact against a   whirling background of experiment, had been all the poetry and   history of Margaret Ransom's life.  Yes, what she had really      esteemed in her husband was the fact of his  being so intense   an embodiment of Wentworth; so long and closely identified, for   instance, with its legal affairs, that he was almost a part of  its   university existence, that of course, at a college banquet, he   would inevitably speak for the bar! 

       It was wonderful of how much consequence all this had seemed    till now. . . .       

      
#                                   II 

         WHEN, punctually at ten minutes to seven, her husband had   emerged from the house, Margaret Ransom remained seated in her   bedroom, addressing herself anew to the difficult process of  self-collection.  As an aid to this endeavour, she bent forward and   looked out of the window, following Ransom's figure as it receded    down the elm-shaded street.  He moved almost alone between the  prim   flowerless grass-plots, the white porches, the protrusion of   irrelevant shingled gables, which stamped the empty street as  part   of an American college town.  She had always been proud of living    in Hill Street, where the university people congregated, proud to    associate her husband's retreating back, as he walked daily to  his   office, with backs literary and pedagogic, backs of which it was   whispered, for the edification of duly-impressed visitors: "Wait   till that old boy turns—that's so-and-so." 

       This had been her world, a world destitute of personal   experience, but filled with a rich sense of privilege and   distinction, of being not as those millions were who, denied the   inestimable advantage of living at Wentworth, pursued elsewhere   careers foredoomed to futility by that very fact. 

       And now—! 

       She rose and turned to her work-table where she had dropped,    on entering, the handful of photographs that Guy Dawnish had left    with her.  While he sat so close, pointing out and explaining,  she   had hardly taken in the details; but now, on the full tones of  his   low young voice, they came back with redoubled distinctness.   This   was Guise Abbey, his uncle's place in Wiltshire, where, under his    grandfather's rule, Guy's own boyhood had been spent: a long  gabled   Jacobean facade, many-chimneyed, ivy-draped, overhung (she felt   sure) by the boughs of a venerable rookery.  And in this other   picture—the walled garden at Guise—that was his uncle, Lord   Askern, a hale gouty-looking figure, planted robustly on the   terrace, a gun on his shoulder and a couple of setters at his  feet.    And here was the river below the park, with Guy "punting" a girl  in   a flapping hat—how Margaret hated the flap that hid the girl's   face!  And here was the tennis-court, with Guy among a jolly  cross-legged group of youths in flannels, and pretty girls about the  tea-table under the big lime: in the centre the curate handing bread   and butter, and in the middle distance a footman approaching with    more cups. 

       Margaret raised this picture closer to her eyes, puzzling,  in   the diminished light, over the face of the girl nearest to Guy   Dawnish—bent above him in profile, while he laughingly lifted  his   head.  No hat hid this profile, which stood out clearly against  the   foliage behind it. 

       "And who is that handsome girl?" Margaret had said,  detaining   the photograph as he pushed it aside, and struck by the fact  that,   of the whole group, he had left only this member unnamed. 

       "Oh, only Gwendolen Matcher—I've always known her—.  Look  at   this: the almshouses at Guise.  Aren't they jolly?" 

       And then—without her having had the courage to ask if the   girl in the punt were also Gwendolen Matcher—they passed on to   photographs of his rooms at Oxford, of a cousin's studio in   London—one of Lord Askern's grandsons was "artistic"—of the  rose-hung cottage in Wales to which, on the old Earl's death, his   daughter-in-law, Guy's mother, had retired. 

       Every one of the photographs opened a window on the life   Margaret had been trying to picture since she had known him—a  life   so rich, so romantic, so packed—in the mere casual vocabulary of    daily life—with historic reference and poetic allusion, that she    felt almost oppressed by this distant whiff of its air.  The very    words he used fascinated and bewildered her.  He seemed to have   been born into all sorts of connections, political, historical,   official, that made the Ransom situation at Wentworth as   featureless as the top shelf of a dark closet.  Some one in the   family had "asked for the Chiltern Hundreds"—one uncle was an   Elder Brother of the Trinity House—some    one  else was the   Master of a College—some one was in command at Devonport—the   Army, the Navy, the House of Commons, the House of Lords, the  most   venerable seats of learning, were all woven into the dense   background of this young man's light unconscious talk.  For the   unconsciousness was unmistakable.  Margaret was not without   experience of the transatlantic visitor who sounds loud names and    evokes reverberating connections.  The poetry of Guy Dawnish's   situation lay in the fact that it was so completely a part of  early   associations and accepted facts.  Life was like that in  England—in   Wentworth of course (where he had been sent, through his uncle's   influence, for two years' training in the neighbouring electrical    works at Smedden)—in Wentworth, though "immensely jolly," it was    different.  The fact that he was qualifying to be an electrical   engineer—with the hope of a secretaryship at the London end of  the   great Smedden Company—that, at best, he was returning home to a   life of industrial "grind," this fact, though avowedly a bore,  did   not disconnect him from that brilliant pinnacled past, that many-  faceted life in which the brightest episodes of the whole body of    English fiction seemed collectively reflected.  Of course he  would   have to work—younger sons' sons almost always had to—but his   uncle Askern (like Wentworth) was "immensely jolly," and Guise   always open to him, and his other uncle, the Master, a capital  old   boy too—and in town he could always put up with his clever aunt,    Lady Caroline Duckett, who had made a "beastly marriage" and was   horribly poor, but who knew everybody jolly and amusing, and had   always been particularly kind to him. 

       It was not—and Margaret had not, even in her own thoughts,  to   defend herself from the imputation—it was not what Wentworth  would   have called the "material side" of her friend's situation that   captivated her.  She was austerely proof against such appeals:  her   enthusiasms were all of the imaginative order.  What subjugated  her   was the unexampled prodigality with which he poured for her the   same draught of tradition of which Wentworth held out its little   teacupful.  He besieged her with a million Wentworths in one—   saying, as it were: "All these are mine for the asking—and I   choose you instead!" 

       For this, she told herself somewhat dizzily, was what it  came   to—the summing-up toward which her conscientious efforts at  self-collection had been gradually pushing her: with all this in  reach,   Guy Dawnish was leaving Wentworth reluctantly. 

       "I * was* a bit lonely here at first—but * now!"*   And   again: "It will be jolly, of course, to see them all again—but   there are some things one doesn't easily give up. . . ." 

       If he had known only Wentworth, it would have been wonderful    enough that he should have chosen her out of all Wentworth—but  to   have known that other life, and to set her in the balance against    it—poor Margaret Ransom, in whom, at the moment, nothing seemed  of   weight but her years!  Ah, it might well produce, in nerves and   brain, and poor unpractised pulses, a flushed tumult of  sensation,   the rush of a great wave of life, under which memory struggled in    vain to reassert itself, to particularize again just what his  last   words—the very last—had been. . . .    

       When consciousness emerged, quivering, from this  retrospective   assault, it pushed Margaret Ransom—feeling herself a mere leaf  in   the blast—toward the writing-table from which her innocent and   voluminous correspondence habitually flowed.  She had a letter to    write now—much shorter but more difficult than any she had ever   been called on to indite. 

       "Dear Mr. Dawnish," she began, "since telephoning you just  now   I have decided not—" 

       Maria's voice, at the door, announced that tea was in the   library: "And I s'pose it's the brown silk you'll wear to the   speaking?" 

       In the usual order of the Ransom existence, its mistress's   toilet was performed unassisted; and the mere enquiry—at once   friendly and deferential—projected, for Margaret, a strong light    on the importance of the occasion.  That she should answer: "But  I   am not going," when the going was so manifestly part of a  household   solemnity about which the thoughts below stairs fluttered in  proud   participation; that in face of such participation she should  utter   a word implying indifference or hesitation—nay, revealing  herself   the transposed, uprooted thing she had been on the verge of   becoming; to do this was—well! infinitely harder    than to   perform the alternative act of tearing up the sheet of note-paper    under her reluctant pen. 

       Yes, she said, she would wear the brown silk. . . .       

    
#                                   III

         ALL the heat and glare from the long illuminated table, about   which the fumes of many courses still hung in a savoury fog, seemed   to surge up to the ladies' gallery, and concentrate themselves in   the burning cheeks of a slender figure withdrawn behind the   projection of a pillar. 

       It never occurred to Margaret Ransom that she was sitting in    the shade.  She supposed that the full light of the chandeliers  was  beating on her face—and there were moments when it seemed as   though all the heads about the great horse-shoe below, bald,   shaggy, sleek, close-thatched, or thinly latticed, were equipped   with an additional pair of eyes, set at an angle which enabled  them   to rake her face as relentlessly as the electric burners. 

       In the lull after a speech, the gallery was fluttering with   the rustle of programmes consulted, and Mrs. Sheff (the Brant   girl's aunt) leaned forward to say enthusiastically: "And now  we're   to hear Mr. Ransom!" 

       A louder buzz rose from the table, and the heads (without   relaxing their upward vigilance) seemed to merge, and flow   together, like an attentive flood, toward the upper end of the   horse-shoe, where all the threads of Margaret Ransom's   consciousness were suddenly drawn into what seemed a small speck,   no more—a black speck that rose, hung in air, dissolved into   gyrating gestures, became distended, enormous,  preponderant—became   her husband "speaking." 

       "It's the heat—" Margaret gasped, pressing her handkerchief    to her whitening lips, and finding just strength enough left to   push back farther into the shadow. 

       She felt a touch on her arm.  "It * is* horrible—shall  we   go?" a voice suggested; and, "Yes, yes, let us go," she  whispered,   feeling, with a great throb of relief, * that* to be the  only   possible, the only conceivable, solution.  To sit and listen to  her   husband * now*—how could she ever have thought she could  survive   it?  Luckily, under the lingering hubbub from below, his opening   words were inaudible, and she had only to run the gauntlet of   sympathetic feminine glances, shot after her between waving fans   and programmes, as, guided by Guy Dawnish, she managed to reach  the   door.  It was really so hot that even Mrs. Sheff was not much   surprised—till long afterward. . . .    

       The winding staircase was empty, half dark and blessedly   silent.  In a committee room below Dawnish found the inevitable   water jug, and filled a glass for her, while she leaned back,   confronted only by a frowning college President in an emblazoned   frame.  The academic frown descended on her like an anathema when    she rose and followed her companion out of the building. 

       Hamblin Hall stands at the end of the long green "Campus"  with   its sextuple line of elms—the boast and the singularity of   Wentworth.  A pale spring moon, rising above the dome of the   University library at the opposite end of the elm-walk, diffused  a   pearly mildness in the sky, melted to thin haze the shadows of  the   trees, and turned to golden yellow the lights of the college   windows.  Against this soft suffusion of light the Library cupola    assumed a Bramantesque grace, the white steeple of the   congregational church became a campanile topped by a winged  spirit,   and the scant porticoes of the older halls the colonnades of   classic temples. 

       "This is better—" Dawnish said, as they passed down the  steps   and under the shadow of the elms. 

       They moved on a little way in silence before he began again:    "You're too tired to walk.  Let us sit down a few minutes."  

       Her feet, in truth, were leaden, and not far off a group of   park benches, encircling the pedestal of a patriot in bronze,   invited them to rest.  But Dawnish was guiding her toward a  lateral   path which bent, through shrubberies, toward a strip of turf   between two of the buildings. 

       "It will be cooler by the river," he said, moving on without    waiting for a possible protest.  None came: it seemed easier, for    the moment, to let herself be led without any conventional feint  of   resistance.  And besides, there was nothing wrong about *  this*—   the wrong would have been in sitting up there in the glare,   pretending to listen to her husband, a dutiful wife among her  kind.   . . .   

       The path descended, as both knew, to the chosen, the   inimitable spot of Wentworth: that fugitive curve of the river,   where, before hurrying on to glut the brutal industries of South   Wentworth and Smedden, it simulated for a few hundred yards the   leisurely pace of an ancient university stream, with willows on  its   banks and a stretch of turf extending from the grounds of Hamblin    Hall to the boat houses at the farther bend.  Here too were   benches, beneath the willows, and so close to the river that the   voice of its gliding softened and filled out the reverberating   silence between Margaret and her companion, and made her feel  that   she knew why he had brought her there. 

       "Do you feel better?" he asked gently as he sat down beside   her. 

       "Oh, yes.  I only needed a little air." 

       "I'm so glad you did.  Of course the speeches were   tremendously interesting—but I prefer this.  What a good night!"  

       "Yes." 

       There was a pause, which now, after all, the soothing   accompaniment of the river seemed hardly sufficient to fill.  

       "I wonder what time it is.  I ought to be going home,"   Margaret began at length. 

       "Oh, it's not late.  They'll be at it for hours in there—   yet." 

       She made a faint inarticulate sound.  She wanted to say:  "No—   Robert's speech was to be the last—" but she could not bring   herself to pronounce Ransom's name, and at the moment no other  way   of refuting her companion's statement occurred to her. 

       The young man leaned back luxuriously, reassured by her   silence. 

       "You see it's my last chance—and I want to make the most of    it." 

       "Your last chance?"  How stupid of her to repeat his words  on   that cooing note of interrogation!  It was just such a lead as  the   Brant girl might have given him. 

       "To be with you—like this.  I haven't had so many.  And   there's less than a week left." 

       She attempted to laugh.  "Perhaps it will sound longer if  you   call it five days." 

       The flatness of that, again!  And she knew there were people    who called her intelligent.  Fortunately he did not seem to  notice   it; but her laugh continued to sound in her own ears—the   coquettish chirp of middle age!  She decided that if he spoke   again—if he * said anything*—she would make no farther  effort at   evasion: she would take it directly, seriously, frankly—she  would   not be doubly disloyal. 

       "Besides," he continued, throwing his arm along the back of   the bench, and turning toward her so that his face was like a  dusky   bas-relief with a silver rim—"besides, there's something I've  been   wanting to tell you." 

       The sound of the river seemed to cease altogether: the whole    world became silent. 

       Margaret had trusted her inspiration farther than it  appeared   likely to carry her.  Again she could think of nothing happier  than   to repeat, on the same witless note of interrogation: "To tell  me?" 

       "You only." 

       The constraint, the difficulty, seemed to be on his side  now:   she divined it by the renewed shifting of his attitude—he was   capable, usually, of such fine intervals of immobility—and by a   confusion in his utterance that set her own voice throbbing in  her   throat. 

       "You've been so perfect to me," he began again.  "It's not  my   fault if you've made me feel that you would understand  everything—   make allowances for everything—see just how a man may have held   out, and fought against a thing—as long as he had the strength.  .   . .  This may be my only chance; and I can't go away without   telling you." 

       He had turned from her now, and was staring at the river, so    that his profile was projected against the moonlight in all its   beautiful young dejection. 

       There was a slight pause, as though he waited for her to   speak; then she leaned forward and laid her hand on his. 

       "If I have really been—if I have done for you even the  least   part of what you say . . . what you imagine . . . will you do for    me, now, just one thing in return?" 

       He sat motionless, as if fearing to frighten away the shy   touch on his hand, and she left it there, conscious of her  gesture   only as part of the high ritual of their farewell. 

       "What do you want me to do?" he asked in a low tone. 

       *" Not* to tell me!" she breathed on a deep note of  entreaty. 

       *" Not* to tell you—?"   

       "Anything—* anything*—just to leave our . . . our   friendship . . . as it has been—as—as a painter, if a friend   asked him, might leave a picture—not quite finished, perhaps . .    . but all the more exquisite. . . ." 

       She felt the hand under hers slip away, recover itself, and   seek her own, which had flashed out of reach in the same  instant—   felt the start that swept him round on her as if he had been  caught   and turned about by the shoulders. 

       "You—* you*—?" he stammered, in a strange voice full  of   fear and tenderness; but she held fast, so centred in her   inexorable resolve that she was hardly conscious of the effect  her   words might be producing. 

       "Don't you see," she hurried on, "don't you * feel* how  much   safer it is—yes, I'm willing to put it so!—how much safer to   leave everything undisturbed . . . just as . . . as it has grown  of   itself . . . without trying to say: 'It's this or that' . . . ?    It's what we each choose to call it to ourselves, after all,  isn't   it?  Don't let us try to find a name that . . . that we should  both   agree upon . . . we probably shouldn't succeed."  She laughed   abruptly.  "And ghosts vanish when one names them!" she ended  with   a break in her voice. 

       When she ceased her heart was beating so violently that  there   was a rush in her ears like the noise of the river after rain,  and   she did not immediately make out what he was answering.  But as  she   recovered her lucidity she said to herself that, whatever he was   saying, she must not hear it; and she began to speak again, half   playfully, half appealingly, with an eloquence of entreaty, an   ingenuity in argument, of which she had never dreamed herself   capable.  And then, suddenly, strangling hands seemed to reach up    from her heart to her throat, and she had to stop. 

       Her companion remained motionless.  He had not tried to  regain   her hand, and his eyes were away from her, on the river.  But his    nearness had become something formidable and exquisite—something    she had never before imagined.  A flush of guilt swept over her—    vague reminiscences of French novels and of opera plots.  This  was   what such women felt, then . . . this was "shame." . . .  Phrases    of the newspaper and the pulpit danced before her. . . .  She  dared   not speak, and his silence began to frighten her.  Had ever a  heart   beat so wildly before in Wentworth? 

       He turned at last, and taking her two hands, quite simply,   kissed them one after the other. 

       "I shall never forget—" he said in a confused voice, unlike    his own. 

       A return of strength enabled her to rise, and even to let  her   eyes meet his for a moment. 

       "Thank you," she said, simply also. 

       She turned away from the bench, regaining the path that led   back to the college buildings, and he walked beside her in  silence.    When they reached the elm walk it was dotted with dispersing   groups.  The "speaking" was over, and Hamblin Hall had poured its    audience out into the moonlight.  Margaret felt a rush of relief,    followed by a receding wave of regret.  She had the distinct   sensation that her hour—her one hour—was over. 

       One of the groups just ahead broke up as they approached,  and   projected Ransom's solid bulk against the moonlight. 

       "My husband," she said, hastening forward; and she never   afterward forgot the look of his back—heavy, round-shouldered,  yet   a little pompous—in a badly fitting overcoat that stood out at  the   neck and hid his collar.  She had never before noticed how he   dressed.       

    
#                                   IV 

         THEY met again, inevitably, before Dawnish left; but the  thing   she feared did not happen—he did not try to see her alone.  

       It even became clear to her, in looking back, that he had   deliberately avoided doing so; and this seemed merely an added   proof of his "understanding," of that deep undefinable communion   that set them alone in an empty world, as if on a peak above the   clouds. 

       The five days passed in a flash; and when the last one came,    it brought to Margaret Ransom an hour of weakness, of profound   disorganization, when old barriers fell, old convictions faded—   when to be alone with him for a moment became, after all, the one    craving of her heart.  She knew he was coming that afternoon to  say   "good-by"—and she knew also that Ransom was to be away at South   Wentworth.  She waited alone in her pale little drawing- room, with its scant kakemonos, its one or two  chilly   reproductions from the antique, its slippery Chippendale chairs.     At length the bell rang, and her world became a rosy  blur—through   which she presently discerned the austere form of Mrs. Sperry,  wife   of the Professor of palaeontology, who had come to talk over with    her the next winter's programme for the Higher Thought Club.   They   debated the question for an hour, and when Mrs. Sperry departed   Margaret had a confused impression that the course was to deal  with   the influence of the First Crusade on the development of European    architecture—but the sentient part of her knew only that Dawnish    had not come. 

       He "bobbed in," as he would have put it, after  dinner—having,   it appeared, run across Ransom early in the day, and learned that    the latter would be absent till evening.  Margaret was in the  study   with her husband when the door opened and Dawnish stood there.    Ransom—who had not had time to dress—was seated at his desk, a   pile of shabby law books at his elbow, the light from a hanging   lamp falling on his grayish stubble of hair, his sallow forehead   and spectacled eyes.  Dawnish, towering higher than usual against    the shadows of the room, and refined by his unusual pallor, hung  a   moment on the threshold, then came in, explaining himself   profusely—laughing, accepting a cigar, letting Ransom push an  arm-chair forward—a Dawnish she had never seen, ill at ease,   ejaculatory, yet somehow more mature, more obscurely in command  of   himself. 

       Margaret drew back, seating herself in the shade, in such a   way that she saw her husband's head first, and beyond it their   visitor's, relieved against the dusk of the book shelves.  Her   heart was still—she felt no throbbing in her throat or temples:   all her life seemed concentrated in the hand that lay on her  knee,   the hand he would touch when they said good-by.    

       Afterward her heart rang all the changes, and there was a  mood   in which she reproached herself for cowardice—for having   deliberately missed her one moment with him, the moment in which   she might have sounded the depths of life, for joy or anguish.   But   that mood was fleeting and infrequent.  In quieter hours she   blushed for it—she even trembled to think that he might have   guessed such a regret in her.  It seemed to convict her of a lack    of fineness that he should have had, in his youth and his power,  a   tenderer, surer sense of the peril of a rash touch—should have   handled the case so much more delicately. 

       At first her days were fire and the nights long solemn  vigils.    Her thoughts were no longer vulgarized and defaced by any notion  of   "guilt," of mental disloyalty.  She was ashamed now of her shame.     What had happened was as much outside the sphere of her marriage  as   some transaction in a star.  It had simply given her a secret  life   of incommunicable joys, as if all the wasted springs of her youth    had been stored in some hidden pool, and she could return there  now   to bathe in them. 

       After that there came a phase of loneliness, through which  the   life about her loomed phantasmal and remote.  She thought the  dead   must feel thus, repeating the vain gestures of the living beside   some Stygian shore.  She wondered if any other woman had lived to    whom * nothing had ever happened?*  And then his first  letter   came. . . . 

       It was a charming letter—a perfect letter.  The little  touch   of awkwardness and constraint under its boyish spontaneity told  her   more than whole pages of eloquence.  He spoke of their  friendship—   of their good days together. . . .  Ransom, chancing to come in   while she read, noticed the foreign stamps; and she was able to   hand him the letter, saying gaily: "There's a message for you,"  and   knowing all the while that * her* message was safe in her  heart. 

       On the days when the letters came the outlines of things  grew   indistinct, and she could never afterward remember what she had   done or how the business of life had been carried on.  It was   always a surprise when she found dinner on the table as usual,  and   Ransom seated opposite to her, running over the evening paper.  

       But though Dawnish continued to write, with all the English   loyalty to the outward observances of friendship, his   communications came only at intervals of several weeks, and  between   them she had time to repossess herself, to regain some sort of   normal contact with life.  And the customary, the recurring,   gradually reclaimed her, the net of habit tightened again—her      daily life became real, and her one momentary  escape from it   an exquisite illusion.  Not that she ceased to believe in the   miracle that had befallen her: she still treasured the reality of    her one moment beside the river.  What reason was there for   doubting it?  She could hear the ring of truth in young Dawnish's    voice: "It's not my fault if you've made me feel that you would   understand everything. . . ."  No! she believed in her miracle,  and   the belief sweetened and illumined her life; but she came to see   that what was for her the transformation of her whole being might    well have been, for her companion, a mere passing explosion of   gratitude, of boyish good-fellowship touched with the pang of   leave-taking.  She even reached the point of telling herself that    it was "better so": this view of the episode so defended it from   the alternating extremes of self-reproach and derision, so   enshrined it in a pale immortality to which she could make her   secret pilgrimages without reproach. 

       For a long time she had not been able to pass by the bench   under the willows—she even avoided the elm walk till autumn had   stripped its branches.  But every day, now, she noted a step  toward   recovery; and at last a day came when, walking along the river,  she   said to herself, as she approached the bench: "I used not to be   able to pass here without thinking of him; * and now I am not   thinking of him at all!"* 

       This seemed such convincing proof of her recovery that she   began, as spring returned, to permit herself, now and then, a  quiet   session on the bench—a dedicated hour from which she went back   fortified to her task. 

       She had not heard from her friend for six weeks or more—the    intervals between his letters were growing longer.  But that was   "best" too, and she was not anxious, for she knew he had obtained    the post he had been preparing for, and that his active life in   London had begun.  The thought reminded her, one mild March day,   that in leaving the house she had thrust in her reticule a letter    from a Wentworth friend who was abroad on a holiday.  The  envelope   bore the London post mark, a fact showing that the lady's face  was   turned toward home.  Margaret seated herself on her bench, and   drawing out the letter began to read it. 

       The London described was that of shops and museums—as  remote   as possible from the setting of Guy Dawnish's existence.  But   suddenly Margaret's eye fell on his name, and the page began to   tremble in her hands. 

       "I heard such a funny thing yesterday about your friend Mr.   Dawnish.  We went to a tea at Professor Bunce's (I do wish you  knew   the Bunces—their atmosphere is so * uplifting*), and there  I met   that Miss Bruce-Pringle who came out last year to take a course  in   histology at the Annex.  Of course she asked about you and Mr.   Ransom, and then she told me she had just seen Mr. Dawnish's  aunt—   the clever one he was always talking about, Lady Caroline   something—and that they were all in a dreadful state about him.     I wonder if you knew he was engaged when he went to America?  He   never mentioned it to * us*.  She said it was not a positive    engagement, but an understanding with a girl he has always been   devoted to, who lives near their place in Wiltshire; and both   families expected the marriage to take place as soon as he got   back.  It seems the girl is an heiress (you know * how low*  the   English ideals are compared with ours), and Miss Bruce-Pringle  said   his relations were perfectly delighted at his 'being provided  for,'   as she called it.  Well, when he got back he asked the girl to   release him; and she and her family were furious, and so were his    people; but he holds out, and won't marry her, and won't give a   reason, except that he has 'formed an unfortunate attachment.'   Did   you ever hear anything so peculiar?  His aunt, who is quite wild   about it, says it must have happened at Wentworth, because he   didn't go anywhere else in America.  Do you suppose it *  could*   have been the Brant girl?  But why 'unfortunate' when everybody   knows she would have jumped at him?" 

       Margaret folded the letter and looked out across the river.     It was not the same river, but a mystic current shot with   moonlight.  The bare willows wove a leafy veil above her head,  and   beside her she felt the nearness of youth and tempestuous   tenderness.  It had all happened just here, on this very seat by   the river—it had come to her, and passed her by, and she had not    held out a hand to detain it. . . . 

       Well!  Was it not, by that very abstention, made more deeply    and ineffaceably hers?  She could argue thus while she had         thought the episode, on his side, a mere transient effect of   propinquity; but now that she knew it had altered the whole  course   of his life, now that it took on substance and reality, asserted  a   separate existence outside of her own troubled consciousness—now    it seemed almost cowardly to have missed her share in it. 

       She walked home in a dream.  Now and then, when she passed  an   acquaintance, she wondered if the pain and glory were written on   her face.  But Mrs. Sperry, who stopped her at the corner of   Maverick Street to say a word about the next meeting of the  Higher   Thought Club, seemed to remark no change in her. 

       When she reached home Ransom had not yet returned from the   office, and she went straight to the library to tidy his writing-  table.  It was part of her daily duty to bring order out of the   chaos of his papers, and of late she had fastened on such small   recurring tasks as some one falling over a precipice might snatch    at the weak bushes in its clefts. 

       When she had sorted the letters she took up some pamphlets  and   newspapers, glancing over them to see if they were to be kept.    Among the papers was a page torn from a London * Times* of  the   previous month.  Her eye ran down its columns and suddenly a   paragraph flamed out. 

       "We are requested to state that the marriage arranged  between   Mr. Guy Dawnish, son of the late Colonel the Hon. Roderick  Dawnish,   of Malby, Wilts, and Gwendolen, daughter of Samuel Matcher, Esq.  of   Armingham Towers, Wilts, will not take place." 

       Margaret dropped the paper and sat down, hiding her face   against the stained baize of the desk.  She remembered the   photograph of the tennis-court at Guise—she remembered the   handsome girl at whom Guy Dawnish looked up, laughing.  A gust of    tears shook her, loosening the dry surface of conventional  feeling,   welling up from unsuspected depths.  She was sorry—very sorry,  yet   so glad—so ineffably, impenitently glad.     

   
#                                    V 

         THERE came a reaction in which she decided to write to him.     She even sketched out a letter of sisterly, almost motherly,   remonstrance, in which she reminded him that he "still had all  his   life before him."  But she reflected that so, after all, had she;    and that seemed to weaken the argument. 

       In the end she decided not to send the letter.  He had never    spoken to her of his engagement to Gwendolen Matcher, and his   letters had contained no allusion to any sentimental disturbance  in   his life.  She had only his few broken words, that night by the   river, on which to build her theory of the case.  But illuminated    by the phrase "an unfortunate attachment" the theory towered up,   distinct and immovable, like some high landmark by which  travellers   shape their course.  She had been loved—extraordinarily loved.    But he had chosen that she should know of it by his silence  rather   than by his speech.  He had understood that only on those terms   could their transcendant communion continue—that he must lose  her   to keep her.  To break that silence would be like spilling a cup  of   water in a waste of sand.  There would be nothing left for her   thirst. 

       Her life, thenceforward, was bathed in a tranquil beauty.   The   days flowed by like a river beneath the moon—each ripple caught   the brightness and passed it on.  She began to take a renewed   interest in her familiar round of duties.  The tasks which had  once   seemed colourless and irksome had now a kind of sacrificial   sweetness, a symbolic meaning into which she alone was initiated.     She had been restless—had longed to travel; now she felt that  she   should never again care to leave Wentworth.  But if her desire to    wander had ceased, she travelled in spirit, performing invisible   pilgrimages in the footsteps of her friend.  She regretted that  her   one short visit to England had taken her so little out of  London—   that her acquaintance with the landscape had been formed chiefly   through the windows of a railway carriage.  She threw herself  into   the architectural studies of the Higher Thought Club, and   distinguished herself, at the spring meetings, by her fluency,  her   competence, her inexhaustible curiosity on the subject of the   growth of English Gothic.  She ransacked the shelves of the  college   library, she borrowed photographs of the cathedrals, she pored  over   the folio pages of "The Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen."  She  was   like some banished princess who learns that she     has inherited a domain in her own country, who knows that she will   never see it, yet feels, wherever she walks, its soil beneath her    feet. 

       May was half over, and the Higher Thought Club was to hold  its   last meeting, previous to the college festivities which, in early    June, agreeably disorganized the social routine of Wentworth.   The   meeting was to take place in Margaret Ransom's drawing-room, and  on   the day before she sat upstairs preparing for her dual duties as   hostess and orator—for she had been invited to read the final   paper of the course.  In order to sum up with precision her   conclusions on the subject of English Gothic she had been  rereading   an analysis of the structural features of the principal English   cathedrals; and she was murmuring over to herself the phrase:  "The   longitudinal arches of Lincoln have an approximately elliptical   form," when there came a knock on the door, and Maria's voice   announced: "There's a lady down in the parlour." 

       Margaret's soul dropped from the heights of the shadowy   vaulting to the dead level of an afternoon call at Wentworth.  

       "A lady?  Did she give no name?" 

       Maria became confused.  "She only said she was a lady—" and    in reply to her mistress's look of mild surprise: "Well, ma'am,  she   told me so three or four times over." 

       Margaret laid her book down, leaving it open at the   description of Lincoln, and slowly descended the stairs.  As she   did so, she repeated to herself: "The longitudinal arches are   elliptical." 

       On the threshold below, she had the odd impression that her   bare and inanimate drawing-room was brimming with life and  noise—   an impression produced, as she presently perceived, by the  resolute   forward dash—it was almost a pounce—of the one small figure   restlessly measuring its length. 

       The dash checked itself within a yard of Margaret, and the   lady—a stranger—held back long enough to stamp on her hostess a    sharp impression of sallowness, leanness, keenness, before she   said, in a voice that might have been addressing an unruly   committee meeting: "I am Lady Caroline Duckett—a fact I found it    impossible to make clear to the young woman who let me in."  

       A warm wave rushed up from Margaret's heart to her throat  and   forehead.  She held out both hands impulsively.  "Oh, I'm so  glad—   I'd no idea—" 

       Her voice sank under her visitor's impartial scrutiny.  

       "I don't wonder," said the latter drily.  "I suppose she   didn't mention, either, that my object in calling here was to see    Mrs. Ransom?" 

       "Oh, yes—won't you sit down?"  Margaret pushed a chair   forward.  She seated herself at a little distance, brain and  heart   humming with a confused interchange of signals.  This dark sharp   woman was his aunt—the "clever aunt" who had had such a hard  life,   but had always managed to keep her head above water.  Margaret   remembered that Guy had spoken of her kindness—perhaps she would    seem kinder when they had talked together a little.  Meanwhile  the   first impression she produced was of an amplitude out of all   proportion to her somewhat scant exterior.  With her small flat   figure, her shabby heterogeneous dress, she was as dowdy as any   Professor's wife at Wentworth; but her dowdiness (Margaret  borrowed   a literary analogy to define it), her dowdiness was somehow "of  the   centre."  Like the insignificant emissary of a great power, she  was   to be judged rather by her passports than her person. 

       While Margaret was receiving these impressions, Lady  Caroline,   with quick bird-like twists of her head, was gathering others  from   the pale void spaces of the drawing-room.  Her eyes, divided by a    sharp nose like a bill, seemed to be set far enough apart to see  at   separate angles; but suddenly she bent both of them on Margaret.  

       "This * is* Mrs. Ransom's house?" she asked, with an  emphasis   on the verb that gave a distinct hint of unfulfilled  expectations. 

       Margaret assented. 

       "Because your American houses, especially in the provincial   towns, all look so remarkably alike, that I thought I might have   been mistaken; and as my time is extremely limited—in fact I'm   sailing on Wednesday—" 

       She paused long enough to let Margaret say: "I had no idea  you   were in this country." 

       Lady Caroline made no attempt to take this up.  "And so much    of it," she carried    on her sentence, "has  been wasted in   talking to people I really hadn't the slightest desire to see,  that   you must excuse me if I go straight to the point." 

       Margaret felt a sudden tension of the heart.  "Of course,"  she   said while a voice within her cried: "He is dead—he has left me  a   message." 

       There was another pause; then Lady Caroline went on, with   increasing asperity: "So that—in short—if I * could* see  Mrs.   Ransom at once—" 

       Margaret looked up in surprise.  "I am Mrs. Ransom," she  said. 

       The other stared a moment, with much the same look of  cautious   incredulity that had marked her inspection of the drawing-room.    Then light came to her. 

       "Oh, I beg your pardon.  I should have said that I wished to    see Mrs. * Robert* Ransom, not Mrs. Ransom.  But I  understood that   in the States you don't make those distinctions."  She paused a   moment, and then went on, before Margaret could answer: "Perhaps,    after all, it's as well that I should see you instead, since  you're   evidently one of the household—your son and his wife live with   you, I suppose?  Yes, on the whole, then, it's better—I shall be    able to talk so much more frankly."  She spoke as if, as a rule,   circumstances prevented her giving rein to this propensity.  "And    frankness, of course, is the only way out of this—this extremely    tiresome complication.  You know, I suppose, that my nephew  thinks   he's in love with your daughter-in-law?" 

       Margaret made a slight movement, but her visitor pressed on   without heeding it.  "Oh, don't fancy, please, that I'm  pretending   to take a high moral ground—though his mother does, poor dear!   I   can perfectly imagine that in a place like this—I've just been   driving about it for two hours—a young man of Guy's age would    * have* to provide himself with some sort of distraction,  and he's   not the kind to go in for anything objectionable.  Oh, we quite   allow for that—we should allow for the whole affair, if it  hadn't   so preposterously ended in his throwing over the girl he was   engaged to, and upsetting an arrangement that affected a number  of   people besides himself.  I understand that in the States it's   different—the young people have only themselves to consider.  In    England—in our class, I mean—a great deal may depend on a young    man's making a good match; and in Guy's case I may say that his   mother and sisters (I won't include myself, though I might) have   been simply stranded—thrown overboard—by his freak.  You can   understand how serious it is when I tell you that it's that and   nothing else that has brought me all the way to America.  And my   first idea was to go straight to your daughter-in-law, since her   influence is the only thing we can count on now, and put it to  her   fairly, as I'm putting it to you.  But, on the whole, I dare say   it's better to see you first—you might give me an idea of the  line   to take with her.  I'm prepared to throw myself on her mercy!"  

       Margaret rose from her chair, outwardly rigid in proportion  to   her inward tremor. 

       "You don't understand—" she began. 

       Lady Caroline brushed the interruption aside.  "Oh, but I  do—   completely!  I cast no reflection on your daughter-in-law.  Guy  has   made it quite clear to us that his attachment is—has, in short,   not been rewarded.  But don't you see that that's the worst part  of   it?  There'd be much more hope of his recovering if Mrs. Robert   Ransom had—had—" 

       Margaret's voice broke from her in a cry.  "I am Mrs. Robert    Ransom," she said. 

       If Lady Caroline Duckett had hitherto given her hostess the   impression of a person not easily silenced, this fact added   sensibly to the effect produced by the intense stillness which  now   fell on her. 

       She sat quite motionless, her large bangled hands clasped   about the meagre fur boa she had unwound from her neck on  entering,   her rusty black veil pushed up to the edge of a "fringe" of   doubtful authenticity, her thin lips parted on a gasp that seemed    to sharpen itself on the edges of her teeth.  So overwhelming and    helpless was her silence that Margaret began to feel a motion of   pity beneath her indignation—a desire at least to facilitate the    excuses which must terminate their disastrous colloquy.  But when    Lady Caroline found voice she did not use it to excuse herself.  

       "You * can't* be," she said, quite simply. 

       "Can't be?" Margaret stammered, with a flushing cheek.  

       "I mean, it's some mistake.  Are there * two* Mrs.  Robert   Ransoms in the same town?  Your family arrangements are so   extremely puzzling."  She had a farther   rush  of   enlightenment.  "Oh, I * see!*  I ought of course to have  asked   for Mrs. Robert Ransom 'Junior'!" 

       The idea sent her to her feet with a haste which showed her   impatience to make up for lost time. 

       "There is no other Mrs. Robert Ransom at Wentworth," said   Margaret. 

       "No other—no 'Junior'?  Are you * sure?"*  Lady  Caroline   fell back into her seat again.  "Then I simply don't see," she   murmured helplessly. 

       Margaret's blush had fixed itself on her throbbing forehead.     She remained standing, while her strange visitor continued to  gaze   at her with a perturbation in which the consciousness of   indiscretion had evidently as yet no part. 

       "I simply don't see," she repeated. 

       Suddenly she sprang up, and advancing to Margaret laid an   inspired hand on her arm.  "But, my dear woman, you can help us  out   all the same; you can help us to find out * who it is*—and  you   will, won't you?  Because, as it's not you, you can't in the  least   mind what I've been saying—" 

       Margaret, freeing her arm from her visitor's hold, drew back    a step; but Lady Caroline instantly rejoined her. 

       "Of course, I can see that if it * had* been, you might  have   been annoyed: I dare say I put the case stupidly—but I'm so   bewildered by this new development—by his using you all this  time   as a pretext—that I really don't know where to turn for light on    the mystery—" 

       She had Margaret in her imperious grasp again, but the  latter   broke from her with a more resolute gesture. 

       "I'm afraid I have no light to give you," she began; but  once   more Lady Caroline caught her up. 

       "Oh, but do please understand me!  I condemn Guy most  strongly   for using your name—when we all know you'd been so amazingly  kind   to him!  I haven't a word to say in his defence—but of course  the   important thing now is: * who is the woman, since you're  not?"* 

       The question rang out loudly, as if all the pale puritan   corners of the room flung it back with a shudder at the speaker.     In the silence that ensued Margaret felt the blood ebbing back to    her heart; then she said, in a distinct and level voice: "I know   nothing of the history of Mr. Dawnish." 

       Lady Caroline gave a stare and a gasp.  Her distracted hand   groped for her boa and she began to wind it mechanically about  her   long neck. 

       "It would really be an enormous help to us—and to poor   Gwendolen Matcher," she persisted pleadingly.  "And you'd be  doing   Guy himself a good turn." 

       Margaret remained silent and motionless while her visitor  drew   on one of the worn gloves she had pulled off to adjust her veil.     Lady Caroline gave the veil a final twitch. 

       "I've come a tremendously long way," she said, "and, since  it   isn't you, I can't think why you won't help me. . . ."    

       When the door had closed on her visitor Margaret Ransom went    slowly up the stairs to her room.  As she dragged her feet from  one   step to another, she remembered how she had sprung up the same   steep flight after that visit of Guy Dawnish's when she had  looked   in the glass and seen on her face the blush of youth. 

       When she reached her room she bolted the door as she had  done   that day, and again looked at herself in the narrow mirror above   her dressing-table.  It was just a year since then—the elms were    budding again, the willows hanging their green veil above the  bench   by the river.  But there was no trace of youth left in her face—    she saw it now as others had doubtless always seen it.  If it   seemed as it did to Lady Caroline Duckett, what look must it have    worn to the fresh gaze of young Guy Dawnish? 

       A pretext—she had been a pretext.  He had used her name to   screen some one else—or perhaps merely to escape from a  situation   of which he was weary.  She did not care to conjecture what his   motive had been—everything connected with him had grown so  remote   and alien.  She felt no anger—only an unspeakable sadness, a   sadness which she knew would never be appeased. 

       She looked at herself long and steadily; she wished to clear    her eyes of all illusions.  Then she turned away and took her  usual   seat beside her work-table.  From where she sat she could look  down   the empty elm-shaded street, up which, at this hour every day,  she   was sure to see her husband's figure advancing.  She would see it    presently—she would see it for many years to come.  She had a   sudden aching sense of the length    of the  years that   stretched before her.  Strange that one who was not young should   still, in all likelihood, have so long to live! 

       Nothing was changed in the setting of her life, perhaps   nothing would ever change in it.  She would certainly live and  die   in Wentworth.  And meanwhile the days would go on as usual,   bringing the usual obligations.  As the word flitted through her   brain she remembered that she had still to put the finishing   touches to the paper she was to read the next afternoon at the   meeting of the Higher Thought Club.  The book she had been  reading   lay face downward beside her, where she had left it an hour ago.     She took it up, and slowly and painfully, like a child  laboriously   spelling out the syllables, she went on with the rest of the   sentence: 

       —"and they spring from a level not much above that of the   springing of the transverse and diagonal ribs, which are so   arranged as to give a convex curve to the surface of the vaulting  conoid."
