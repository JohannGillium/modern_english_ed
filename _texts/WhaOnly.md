# *ONLY A CHILD.*

         "The *Press* of May 27 publishes an account of  the suicide in the House of Refuge at Philadelphia  of a boy who was only twelve years old.  He was  locked up in solitary confinement.  They found him  hanging by the neck dead and cold.  Tired of wait-ing for the release that never came, he had at last  escaped—from that House of Refuge!"—THE  WORLD.

    - They found him hanging dead, you know,
  -    In the cell where he had lain
  - Through many a day of restless woe
  -    And night of sleepless pain.
  - The heart had ceased its beating,
  -    The little hands were numb,
  - And the piteous voice entreating
  -    In death at last was dumb.
    - No doubt it was a painful fact
  -    For them to contemplate;
  - They felt the horror of the act,
  -    But felt it rather late.
  - There was none to lay the blame to—
  -    That, each one understands;
  - And the jury found—he came to
  -    His death by his own hands!
    - Poor little hands! that should have known
  -    No subtler arts than these—
  - To seek for violets newly blown
  -    Beneath the April breeze,
  - Or gaily bind unchidden
  -    The daisies into sheaves,
  - Or reach the bird's nest hidden
  -    Among the budding leaves.
    - Poor little hands!  And little heart
  -    That ached so long alone,
  - With none to ease its secret smart
  -    And none to hear its moan;
  - As he lay where they had cast him
  -    In the dark upon the floor,
  - And heard the feet go past him
  -    Outside his prison door.
    - Think of him, you whose children lie
  -    Soft sleeping overhead;
  - All day he could not see the sky,
  -    All night he had no bed.
  - Your walls of brick and mortar
  -    To shut the child's soul in,
  - And starving on bread and water
  -    For—some little childish sin!
    - So in the darkness there he lay
  -    While the hours crawled along,
  - And thought of the woodlands far away
  -    Awake with the robin's song;
  - And thought of the green grass growing
  -    And the boys at play outside,
  - And the breath of heaven blowing
  -    O'er the country far and wide.
    - Perhaps he saw his mother's face
  -    Bend o'er him in the gloom;
  - But when he leaned to catch her dress
  -    She vanished from the room;
  - And though he tried to remember
  -    The prayer he used to say,
  - In a pitiful, broken stammer
  -    On his lips it died away.
    - His little hands had nought to do
  -    But beat against the wall,
  - Until at last too tired they grew—
  -    Poor little hands—so small!
  - And so he lay there voiceless,
  -    Alone upon the ground;
  - If he wept, his tears were noiseless,
  -    For he feared to hear their sound.
    - At last perhaps the silence grew
  -    Too deep—it dazed his head—
  - And his little hands had naught to do;
  -    And so—they found him dead!
  - In a Christian town it happened,
  -    In a home for children built,
  - And God knows whose soul shall answer
  -    For the burden of this guilt!
    - But He who bade the children come
  -    And not be turned away,
  - Has surely taken the homeless home,
  -    And we need not mourn to-day;
  - For our lives are all God-given,
  -    The poorest to him is dear,
  - And the Father has room in heaven
  -    For the children we don't want here!
    New York, May 29                 EADGYTH.
