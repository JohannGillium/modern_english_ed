# NOTE ON AOI NO UYE.

      At the age of twelve Prince Genji went through the ceremony of marriage  with Aoi no Uye (Princess Hollyhock), the Prime Minister's daughter. She  continued to live at her father's house and Genji at his palace. When he  was about sixteen he fell in love with Princess Rokujō, the widow of  the Emperor's brother; she was about eight years older than himself. He  was not long faithful to her. The lady Yūgao next engaged his  affections. He carried her one night to a deserted mansion on the  outskirts of the City. "The night was far advanced and they had both  fallen asleep. Suddenly the figure of a woman appeared at the bedside. "I  have found you!" it cried. "What stranger is this that lies beside you?  What treachery is this that you flaunt before my eyes?" And with these  words the apparition stooped over the bed, and made as though to drag away  the sleeping girl from Genji's side."  [^n143.1]  

      Before dawn Yūgao was dead, stricken by the "living phantom" of  Rokujō, embodiment of her baleful jealousy.  

      Soon after this, Genji became reconciled with his wife Aoi, but continued  to visit Rokujō. One day, at the Kamo Festival, Aoi's way was  blocked by another carriage. She ordered her attendants to drag it aside.  A scuffle ensued between her servants and those of Rokujō (for she  was the occupant of the second carriage) in which Aoi's side prevailed.  Rokujō's carriage was broken and Aoi's pushed into the front place.  After the festival was over Aoi returned to the Prime Minister's house in  high spirits.  

      Soon afterwards she fell ill, and it is at this point that the play  begins.  

      There is nothing obscure or ambiguous in the situation. Fenollosa seems to  have misunderstood the play and read into it complications and confusions  which do not exist. He also changes the sex of the Witch, though the  Japanese word, *miko*, always  has a feminine meaning. The "Romance of Genji" (*Genji  Monogatari*) was written by Lady Murasaki Shikibu and was finished  in the year 1004 A. D. Of its fifty-four chapters only seventeen have been  translated.  [^n143.2]   It furnished the plots of many Nō plays, of which *Suma  Genji* (Genji's exile         at Suma), *No no Miya* (his visit to Rokujō after she  became a nun), *Tamakatsura* (the story of Yūgao's  daughter), and *Hajitomi* (in which Yūgao's ghost  appears) are the best known.  

      There is some doubt about the authorship of the play. Seami saw it acted  as a Dengaku by his father's contemporary Inūo. He describes  Inūo's entry on to the stage in the role of Rukujō and quotes  the first six lines of her opening speech. These lines correspond exactly  with the modern text, and it is probable that the play existed in  something like its present form in the middle of the fourteenth century.  Kwanze Nagatoshi, the great-grandson of Seami, includes it in a list of  Seami's works; while popular tradition ascribes it to Seami's son-in-law  Zenchiku.

  - Chorus.
     (A folded cloak laid in front of the stage symbolizes the sickbed of Aoi.)  

        Courtier:     I am a courtier in the service of the Emperor Shujaku. You must know that  the Prime Minister's daughter, Princess Aoi, has fallen sick. We have sent  for abbots and high-priests, of the Greater School and of the Secret  School, but they could not cure her.  

      And now, here at my side, stands the witch of Teruhi,  [^n145.1]   a famous diviner with the bow-string. My lord has been told that by  twanging her bow-string she can make visible an evil spirit and tell if it  be the spirit of a living man or a dead. So he bade me send for her and  let her pluck her string.     *  Turning to the Witch, who has been waiting motionless.  *    Come, sorceress, we are ready!  

         Witch:     *  comes forward beating a little drum and reciting a mystic formula.  *      - *Ten shōjō; chi shōjō*.
  - *Naige shōjō; rokon shōjō*.
        - Pure above; pure below.
  - Pure without; pure within.
  - Pure in eyes, ears, heart and tongue.
      *  She plucks her bow-string, reciting the spell.  *      - You whom I call
  - Hold loose the reins
           - On your grey colt's neck
  - As you gallop to me
  - Over the long sands!
        *  The living phantasm of Rokujō appears at the back of the stage.  *       Rokujō:     - In the Three Coaches
  - That travel on the Road of Law
  - I drove out of the Burning House . . .  [^n146.1]
  - Is there no way to banish the broken coach
  - That stands at Yūgao's door?  [^n146.2]
    - This world
  - Is like the wheels of the little ox-cart;
  - Round and round they go. . . till vengeance comes.
    - The Wheel of Life turns like the wheel of a coach;
  - There is no escape from the Six Paths and Four Births.
  - We are brittle as the leaves of the *bashō*;
  - As fleeting as foam upon the sea.
  - Yesterday's flower, to-day's dream.
  - From such a dream were it not wiser to wake?
  - And when to this is added another's scorn
  - How can the heart have rest?
  - So when I heard the twanging of your bow
  - For a little while, I thought, I will take my pleasure;
  - And as an angry ghost appeared.
    - Oh! I am ashamed!
    *  She veils her face.  *      - This time too I have come secretly  [^n146.3]
         - In a closed coach.
   - Though I sat till dawn and watched the moon,
  - Till dawn and watched,
  - How could I show myself,
  - That am no more than the mists that tremble over the fields?
  - I am come, I am come to the notch of your bow
  - To tell my sorrow.
   - Whence came the noise of the bow-string?
           Witch:     Though she should stand at the wife-door of the mother-house of the square  court . . .  [^n147.1]  

          Rokujō:     Yet would none come to me, that am not in the flesh.  [^n147.2]  

        Witch:     How strange! I see a fine lady whom I do not know riding in a broken  coach. She clutches at the shafts of another coach from which the oxen  have been unyoked. And in the second coach sits one who seems a new wife.  [^n147.3]   The lady of the broken coach is weeping, weeping. It is a piteous sight.  

       Can this be she?  

        Courtier:     It would not be hard to guess who such a one might be. Come, spirit, tell  us your name!  

        Rokujō:     - In this Sahā World  [^n147.4]   where days fly like the lightning's flash
  - None is worth hating and none worth pitying.
  - This I knew. Oh when did folly master me?
      You would know who I am that have come drawn by the twanging of your bow?  I am the angry ghost of Rokujō, Lady of the Chamber.  

    - Long ago I lived in the world.
  - I sat at flower-feasts among the clouds.  [^n147.5]
         - On spring mornings I rode out
  - In royal retinue and on autumn nights
  - Among the red leaves of the Rishis' Cave
  - I sported with moonbeams,
  - With colours and perfumes
  - My senses sated.
  - I had splendour then;
  - But now I wither like the Morning Glory
  - Whose span endures not from dawn to midday.
  - I have come to clear my hate.
      *  She then quotes the Buddhist saying, "Our sorrows in this world are not  caused by others; for even when others wrong us we are suffering the  retribution of our own deeds in a previous existence."  *     *  But while singing these words she turns towards Aoi's bed; passion again  seizes her and she cries:  *      - I am full of hatred.
  - I must strike; I must strike.
        *  She creeps towards the bed.  *       Witch:     You, Lady Rokujō, you a Lady of the Chamber! Would you lay wait and  strike as peasant women do?  [^n148.1]  How can this be? Think and forbear!  

       Rokujō:     Say what you will, I must strike. I must strike now.    *  Describing her own action.  *    "And as she said this, she went over to the pillow and struck at it."    *  She strikes at the head of the bed with her fan.  *  

        Witch:     She is going to strike again.  *  To Rokujō.  *  You shall pay for this!  

        Rokujō:     And this hate too is payment for past hate.  

               Witch:     "The flame of anger  

         Rokujō:     Consumes itself only."  [^n149.1]  

         Witch:     Did you not know?  

        Rokujō:     Know it then now.  

        Chorus:     - O Hate, Hate!
  - Her  [^n149.2]   hate so deep that on her bed
  - Our lady  [^n149.3]   moans.
  - Yet, should she live in the world again,  [^n149.4]
  - He would call her to him, her Lord
  - The Shining One, whose light
  - Is brighter than fire-fly hovering
  - Over the slime of an inky pool.
           Rokujō:     - But for me
    - There is no way back to what I was,
  - No more than to the heart of a bramble-thicket.
  - The dew that dries on the bramble-leaf
  - Comes back again;
  - But love (and this is worst)
  - That not even in dream returns,   —   
  - That is grown to be an old tale,   —   
  - Now, even now waxes,
  - So that standing at the bright mirror
  - I tremble and am ashamed.
      I am come to my broken coach.  *  She throws down her fan and begins to slip off her embroidered robe.  *  I will hide you in it and carry you away!  

      *  She stands right over the bed, then turns away and at the back of the  stage throws of her robe, which is held by         two attendants in such a way that she cannot be seen. She changes her  "deigan" mask for a female demon's mask and now carries a mallet in her  hand.  *    *  Meanwhile the Courtier, who has been standing near the bed:  *      Courtier:     Come quickly, some one! Princess Aoi is worse. Every minute she is worse.  Go and fetch the Little Saint of Yokawa.  [^n150.1]  

         Messenger:     I tremble and obey.  

    *  He goes to the wing and speaks to some one off the stage.  *      May I come in?  

         Saint:   *  speaking from the wing.  *    Who is it that seeks admittance to a room washed by the moonlight of the  Three Mysteries, sprinkled with the holy water of Yoga? Who would draw  near to a couch of the Ten Vehicles, a window of the Eight Perceptions?  

         Messenger:     I am come from the Court. Princess Aoi is ill. They would have you come to  her.  

         Saint:     It happens that at this time I am practising particular austerities and go  nowhere abroad. But if you are a messenger from the Court, I will follow  you.  

      *  He comes on the stage.  *       Courtier:     We thank you for coming.  

         Saint:     I wait upon you. Where is the sick person?  

          Courtier:     On the bed here.  

         Saint:     Then I will begin my incantations at once.  

               Courtier:     Pray do so.  

          Saint:     - He said: "I will say my incantations."
  - Following in the steps of En no Gyōja,  [^n151.1]
  - Clad in skirts that have trailed the Peak of the Two Spheres,  [^n151.2]
  - That have brushed the dew of the Seven Precious Trees,
  - Glad in the cope of endurance
  - That shields from the world's defilement,
  - "Sarari, sarari," with such sound
  - I shake the red wooden beads of my rosary
  - And say the first spell:
  - *Namaku Samanda Basarada*
  - *Namaku Samanda Basarada*.  [^n151.3]
            Rokujō:   *  during the incantation she has cowered at the back of the stage wrapped in  her Chinese robe, which she has picked up again.  *    Go back, Gyōja, go back to your home; do not stay and be vanquished!  

         Saint:     Be you what demon you will, do not hope to overcome the Gyōja's  subtle power. I will pray again.  

    *  He shakes his rosary whilst the Chorus, speaking for him, invokes the  first of the Five Kings.  *         Chorus:     - In the east Gō Sanze, Subduer of the Three Worlds.
            Rokujō:   *  counter-invoking.  *    - In the south Gundari Yasha.
            Speaker:     - In the west Dai-itoku.
                 Rokujō:     - In the north Kongō
           Chorus:     - Yasha, the Diamond King.
            Rokujō:     - In the centre the Great Holy
            Chorus:     - Fudō Immutable.
  - *Namaku Samanda Basarada*
  - *Senda Makaroshana*
  - *Sohataya Untaratakarman.*
  - "They that hear my name shall get Great Enlightenment;
  - They that see my body shall attain to Buddhahood."  [^n152.1]
           Rokujō:   *  suddenly dropping her mallet and pressing her hands to her ears.  *    The voice of the Hannya Book! I am afraid. Never again will I come as an  angry ghost.  

         Ghost:     - When she heard the sound of Scripture
  - The demon's raging heart was stilled,
  - Shapes of Pity and Sufferance,
  - The Bodhisats descend.
  - Her soul casts off its bonds,
  - She walks in Buddha's Way.

    [^n146.1]:  I drove out of the Burning House. . .] Rokujō  has left the "Burning House," i. e. her material body. The "Three Coaches"  are those of the famous "Burning House" parable in the  *Hokkekyō*. Some children were in a burning house.  Intent on their play, they could not be induced to leave the building;  till their father lured them out by the promise that they would find those  little toy coaches awaiting them. So Buddha, by partial truth, lures men  from the "burning house" of their material lives. Owing to the episode at  the Kamo Festival, Rokujō is obsessed by the idea of "carriages,"  "wheels" and the like.

    [^n146.2]:  the broken coach / That stands at Yūgao's  door] One day Rokujō saw a coach from which all badges and  distinctive decorations had been purposely stripped (hence, in a sense, a  "broken coach") standing before Yūgao's door. She found out that it  was Genji's. For Yūgao, see p. 142.

    [^n146.3]:  I have come secretly] Rokujō went secretly to  the Kamo Festival in a closed carriage.

    [^n147.1]:  Though she should stand. . .] Words from an old  dance-song or "saibara."

    [^n147.4]:  Sahā World] A Sanskrit name for the "world of  appearances."

    [^n149.1]:  "The flame of anger consumes itself only] From the  Sutrālankära Shāstra (Cat. No. 1182).

    [^n149.2]:  Her] Rokujō's.

    [^n149.3]:  Our lady] Aoi.

    [^n149.4]:  live in the world again] I. e. recover.

    [^n150.1]:  Little Saint of Yokawa] The hero of the "Finding of  Ukifune," a later episode in the *Genji Monogatari*.

    [^n151.1]:  En no Gyōja] Founder of the sect of the  ascetics called Yamabushi Mountaineers.

    [^n151.2]:  the Peak of the Two Spheres] Mount ōmine,  near Yoshino, ritual ascents of which were made by Yamabushi.

    [^n151.3]:  *Namaku Samanda  Basarada*] Known as the Lesser Spell of Fudō. The longer  one which follows is the Middle Spell. They consist of corrupt Sanskrit  mixed with meaningless magic syllables.
