# VOICES OF THE PAST
 WRITTEN FOR THE NATIONAL LIBRARY BY HORATIO ALGER, JR

   - The  solemn voices of the past 
-    Fall on our ear in accent low, 
- And many an ancient record tells 
-    The frailty of all things below  
- The proudest monument of art, 
-    Man fondly thought would live alway, 
- When many a year shall pass, will fall 
-    And yield at length to sure decay.  
- Where is thy power, imperial Rome, — 
-    The power which thou wert wont to boast, 
- When through thy street in triumph marched 
-    Thy generals win an armed host?  
- Eternal city!  whose vast sway 
-    Extended o'er a conquered world, 
- While every nation suppliant saw 
- 	Thy banner to the breeze unfurled!  
- No longer shall they streets resound 
-    With a victorious army's tread,— 
- No longer at they chariot wheels 
-    Shall foreign kings be suppliant led.  
- Gone is each vestige of thy pomp, 
-    Thou wast, but art no longer great: 
- In thee we see of human pride 
-    And human power the common fate.
