# THE CRYSTAL EGG

       There was, until a year ago, a little and very grimy-looking shop near  Seven Dials over which, in weather-worn yellow lettering, the name of  "C. Cave, Naturalist and Dealer in Antiquities," was inscribed.  The  contents of its window were curiously variegated.  They comprised  some elephant tusks and an imperfect set of chessmen, beads and  weapons, a box of eyes, two skulls of tigers and one human, several  moth-eaten stuffed monkeys (one holding a lamp), an old-fashioned  cabinet, a flyblown ostrich egg or so, some fishing-tackle, and an   extraordinarily dirty, empty glass fish tank.  There was also, at the  moment the story begins, a mass of crystal, worked into the shape of  an egg and brilliantly polished.  And at that two people, who stood  outside the window, were looking, one of them a tall, thin clergyman,  the other a black-bearded young man of dusky complexion and   unobtrusive costume.  The dusky young man spoke with eager   gestulation, and seemed anxious for his companion to purchase the article.  

While they were there, Mr. Cave came into his shop, his beard still  wagging with the bread and butter of his tea.  When he saw these men  and the object of their regard, his countenance fell.  He glanced  guiltily over his shoulder, and softly shut the door.  He was a little  old man, with pale face and peculiar watery blue eyes; his hair was a  dirty grey, and he wore a shabby blue frock-coat, an ancient silk hat,  and carpet slippers very much down at heel.  He remained watching  the two men as they talked.  The clergyman went deep into his trouser  pocket, examined a handful of money, and showed his teeth in an  agreeable smile.  Mr. Cave seemed still more depressed when they came  into the shop.         

The clergyman, without any ceremony, asked the price of the  crystal egg.  Mr. Cave glanced nervously towards the door leading into  the parlour, and said five pounds.  The clergyman protested that the  price was high, to his companion as well as to Mr. Cave—it was,  indeed, very much more than Mr. Cave had intended to ask, when  he had stocked the article—and an attempt at bargaining ensued.  Mr.  Cave stepped to the shop-door, and held it open.  "Five pounds is  my price," he said, as though he wished to save himself the trouble of  unprofitable discussion.  As he did so, the upper portion of a woman's  face appeared above the blind in the glass upper panel of the door  leading into the parlour, and stared curiously at the two customers.   "Five pounds is my price," said Mr. Cave, with a quiver in his voice.  

The swarthy young man had so far remained a spectator, watching  Cave keenly.  Now he spoke.  "Give him five pounds," he said.  The  clergyman glanced at him to see if he were in earnest, and, when he  looked at Mr. Cave again, he saw that the latter's face was white.  "It's  a lot of money," said the clergyman, and, diving into his pocket,   began counting his resources.  He had little more than thirty shillings,  and he appealed to his companion, with whom he seemed to be on  terms of considerable intimacy.  This gave Mr. Cave an opportunity of  collecting his thoughts, and he began to explain in an agitated manner  that the crystal was not, as a matter of fact, entirely free for sale.  His  two customers were naturally surprised at this, and inquired why  he had not thought of that before he began to bargain.  Mr. Cave  became confused, but he stuck to his story, that the crystal was not  in the market that afternoon, that a probable purchaser of it had  already appeared.  The two, treating this as an attempt to raise the  price still further, made as if they would leave the shop.  But at this  point the parlour door opened, and the owner of the dark fringe and  the little eyes appeared.  

She was a coarse-featured, corpulent woman, younger and very  much larger than Mr. Cave; she walked heavily, and her face was  flushed.  "That crystal is for sale, she said.  "And five pounds is a  good enough price for it.  I can't think what you're about, Cave, not  to take the gentleman's offer!"  

Mr. Cave, greatly perturbed by the irruption, looked angrily at  her over the rims of his spectacles, and, without excessive assurance,  asserted his right to manage his business in his own way.  An   altercation began.  The two customers watched the scene with interest  and some amusement, occasionally assisting Mrs. Cave with suggestions.  Mr. Cave, hard driven, persisted in a confused and impossible  story of an enquiry for the crystal that morning, and his agitation  became painful.  But he stuck to his point with extraordinary   persistence.         It was the young Oriental who ended this curious controversy.  He proposed that they should call again in the course of two  days—so as to give the alleged enquirer a fair chance.  "And then we  must insist," said the clergyman.  "Five pounds." Mrs. Cave took it on  herself to apologise for her husband, explaining that he was sometimes  "a little odd," and as the two customers left, the couple prepared for  a free discussion of the incident in all its bearings.  

Mrs. Cave talked to her husband with singular directness.  The poor  little man, quivering with emotion, muddled himself between his  stories, maintaining on the one hand that he had another customer  in view, and on the other asserting that the crystal was honestly worth  ten guineas.  "Why did you ask five pounds?" said his wife.  "Do let  me manage my business my own way!" said Mr. Cave.  

Mr. Cave had living with him a step-daughter and a step-son, and  at supper that night the transaction was re-discussed.  None of them  had a high opinion of Mr. Cave's business methods, and this action  seemed a culminating folly.  

"It's my opinion he's refused that crystal before," said the step-son,  a loose-limbed lout of eighteen.  

"But Five Pounds!" said the step-daughter, an argumentative young  woman of six-and-twenty.  

Mr. Cave's answers were wretched; he could only mumble weak  assertions that he knew his own business best.  They drove him from  his half-eaten supper into the shop, to close it for the night, his ears  aflame and tears of vexation behind his spectacles.  "Why had he  left the crystal in the window so long? The folly of it!" That was the  trouble closest in his mind.  For a time he could see no way of evading  sale.  

After supper his step-daughter and step-son smartened themselves  up and went out and his wife retired upstairs to reflect upon the   business aspects of the crystal, over a little sugar and lemon and so  forth in hot water.  Mr. Cave went into the shop, and stayed there  until late, ostensibly to make ornamental rockeries for gold-fish cases  but really for a private purpose that will be better explained later.   The next day Mrs. Cave found that the crystal had been removed  from the window, and was lying behind some second-hand books on  angling.  She replaced it in a conspicuous position.  But she did not  argue further about it, as a nervous headache disinclined her from  debate.  Mr. Cave was always disinclined.  The day passed disagreeably.  Mr. Cave was, if anything, more absent-minded than usual, and  uncommonly irritable withal.  In the afternoon, when his wife was   taking her customary sleep, he removed the crystal from the window  again.         

The next day Mr. Cave had to deliver a consignment of dog-fish  at one of the hospital schools, where they were needed for dissection.   In his absence Mrs. Cave's mind reverted to the topic of the crystal,  and the methods of expenditure suitable to a windfall of five pounds.   She had already devised some very agreeable expedients, among others  a dress of green silk for herself and a trip to Richmond, when a  jangling of the front door bell summoned her into the shop.  The   customer was an examination coach who came to complain of the non-delivery of certain frogs asked for the previous day.  Mrs. Cave did  not approve of this particular branch of Mr. Cave's business, and  the gentleman, who had called in a somewhat aggressive mood,  retired after a brief exchange of words—entirely civil so far as he  was concerned.  Mrs. Cave's eye then naturally turned to the window;  for the sight of the crystal was an assurance of the five pounds and  of her dreams.  What was her surprise to find it gone!  

She went to the place behind the locker on the counter, where  she had discovered it the day before.  It was not there; and she   immediately began an eager search about the shop.  

When Mr. Cave returned from his business with the dog-fish, about  a quarter to two in the afternoon, he found the shop in some   confusion, and his wife, extremely exasperated and on her knees behind  the counter, routing among his taxidermic material.  Her face came  up hot and angry over the counter, as the jangling bell announced  his return, and she forthwith accused him of "hiding it."  

"Hid what?" asked Mr. Cave.  

"The crystal!"  

At that Mr. Cave, apparently much surprised, rushed to the window.   "Isn't it here?" he said.  "Great Heavens! what has become of it?"  

Just then, Mr. Cave's step-son re-entered the shop from the inner  room—he had come home a minute or so before Mr. Cave—and he  was blaspheming freely.  He was apprenticed to a second-hand furniture  dealer down the road, but he had his meals at home, and he was   naturally annoyed to find no dinner ready.  

But, when he heard of the loss of the crystal, he forgot his meal,  and his anger was diverted from his mother to his step-father.  Their  first idea, of course, was that he had hidden it.  But Mr. Cave stoutly  denied all knowledge of its fate—freely offering his bedabbled   affidavit in the matter—and at last was worked up to the point of   accusing, first, his wife and then his step-son of having taken it with a  view to a private sale.  So began an exceedingly acrimonious and   emotional discussion, which ended for Mrs. Cave in a peculiar nervous  condition midway between hysterics and amuck, and caused the step-son to be half-an-hour late at the furniture establishment in the   afternoon.       Mr. Cave took refuge from his wife's emotions in the shop.  

In the evening the matter was resumed, with less passion and in  a judicial spirit, under the presidency of the step-daughter.  The supper  passed unhappily and culminated in a painful scene.  Mr. Cave gave  way at last to extreme exasperation, and went out banging the front  door violently.  The rest of the family, having discussed him with  the freedom his absence warranted, hunted the house from garret to  cellar, hoping to light upon the crystal.  

The next day the two customers called again.  They were received  by Mrs. Cave almost in tears.  It transpired that no one could imagine  all that she had stood from Cave at various times in her married   pilgrimage. . . .   She also gave a garbled account of the disappearance.   The clergyman and the Oriental laughed silently at one another, and  said it was very extraordinary.  As Mrs. Cave seemed disposed to give  them the complete history of her life they made to leave the shop.   Thereupon Mrs. Cave, still clinging to hope, asked for the clergyman's  address, so that, if she could get anything out of Cave, she might  communicate it.  The address was duly given, but apparently was  afterwards mislaid.  Mrs. Cave can remember nothing about it.  

In the evening of that day, the Caves seem to have exhausted their  emotions, and Mr. Cave, who had been out in the afternoon, supped  in a gloomy isolation that contrasted pleasantly with the impassioned  controversy of the previous days.  For some time matters were very  badly strained in the Cave household, but neither crystal nor   customer reappeared.  

Now, without mincing the matter, we must admit that Mr. Cave was  a liar.  He knew perfectly well where the crystal was.  It was in the  rooms of Mr. Jacoby Wace, Assistant Demonstrator at St. Catherine's  Hospital, Westbourne Street.  It stood on the sideboard partially   covered by a black velvet cloth, and beside a decanter of American  whisky.  It is from Mr. Wace, indeed, that the particulars upon  which this narrative is based were derived.  Cave had taken off the  thing to the hospital hidden in the dog-fish sack, and there had pressed  the young investigator to keep it for him.  Mr. Wace was a little   dubious at first.  His relationship to Cave was peculiar.  He had a taste  for singular characters, and he had more than once invited the old  man to smoke and drink in his rooms, and to unfold his rather   amusing views of life in general and of his wife in particular.  Mr. Wace  had encountered Mrs. Cave, too, on occasions when Mr. Cave was  not at home to attend to him.  He knew the constant interference to  which Cave was subjected, and having weighed the story judicially, he  decided to give the crystal a refuge.  Mr. Cave promised to explain  the reasons for his remarkable affection for the crystal more fully         on a later occasion, but he spoke distinctly of seeing visions therein.   He called on Mr. Wace the same evening.  

He told a complicated story.  The crystal he said had come into his  possession with other oddments at the forced sale of another   curiosity dealer's effects, and not knowing what its value might be, he  had ticketed it at ten shillings.  It had hung upon his hands at that  price for some months, and he was thinking of "reducing the figure,"  when he made a singular discovery.  

At that time his health was very bad—and it must be borne in mind  that, throughout all this experience, his physical condition was one of  ebb—and he was in considerable distress by reason of the negligence,  the positive ill-treatment even, he received from his wife and step-children.  His wife was vain, extravagant, unfeeling and had a growing  taste for private drinking; his step-daughter was mean and over-reaching;  and his step-son had conceived a violent dislike for him, and  lost no chance of showing it.  The requirements of his business pressed  heavily upon him, and Mr. Wace does not think that he was   altogether free from occasional intemperance.  He had begun life in a  comfortable position, he was a man of fair education, and he suffered,  for weeks at a stretch, from melancholia and insomnia.  Afraid to   disturb his family, he would slip quietly from his wife's side, when his  thoughts became intolerable, and wander about the house.  And about  three o'clock one morning, late in August, chance directed him into  the shop.  

The dirty little place was impenetrably black except in one spot,  where he perceived an unusual glow of light.  Approaching this, he  discovered it to be the crystal egg, which was standing on the corner  of the counter towards the window.  A thin ray smote through a crack  in the shutters, impinged upon the object, and seemed as it were to  fill its entire interior.  

It occurred to Mr. Cave that this was not in accordance with the  laws of optics as he had known them in his younger days.  He could  understand the rays being refracted by the crystal and coming to a  focus in its interior, but this diffusion jarred with his physical   conceptions.  He approached the crystal nearly, peering into it and round  it, with a transient revival of the scientific curiosity that in his youth  had determined his choice of a calling.  He was surprised to find the  light not steady, but writhing within the substance of the egg, as  though that object was a hollow sphere of some luminous vapour.   In moving about to get different points of view, he suddenly found  that he had come between it and the ray, and that the crystal none  the less remained luminous.  Greatly astonished, he lifted it out of  the light ray and carried it to the darkest part of the shop.  It   remained         bright for some four or five minutes, when it slowly faded  and went out.  He placed it in the thin streak of daylight, and its  luminousness was almost immediately restored.  

So far, at least, Mr. Wace was able to verify the remarkable story  of Mr. Cave.  He has himself repeatedly held this crystal in a ray  of light (which had to be of a less diameter than one millimetre).   And in a perfect darkness, such as could be produced by velvet   wrapping, the crystal did undoubtedly appear very faintly phosphorescent.   It would seem, however, that the luminousness was of some exceptional  sort, and not equally visible to all eyes; for Mr. Harbinger—  whose name will be familiar to the scientific reader in connection  with the Pasteur Institute—was quite unable to see any light   whatever.  And Mr. Wace's own capacity for its appreciation was out of  comparison inferior to that of Mr. Cave's.  Even with Mr. Cave the  power varied very considerably: his vision was most vivid during  states of extreme weakness and fatigue.  

Now, from the outset this light in the crystal exercised a curious  fascination upon Mr. Cave.  And it says more for his loneliness of soul  than a volume of pathetic writing could do, that he told no human  being of his curious observations.  He seems to have been living in  such an atmosphere of petty spite that to admit the existence of a  pleasure would have been to risk the loss of it.  He found that as  the dawn advanced, and the amount of diffused light increased, the  crystal became to all appearance non-luminous.  And for some time  he was unable to see anything in it, except at night-time, in dark  corners of the shop.  

But the use of an old velvet cloth, which he used as a background  for a collection of minerals, occurred to him, and by doubling this,  and putting it over his head and hands, he was able to get a sight of  the luminous movement within the crystal even in the day-time.  He  was very cautious lest he should be thus discovered by his wife, and  he practised this occupation only in the afternoons, while she was  asleep upstairs, and then circumspectly in a hollow under the counter.   And one day, turning the crystal about in his hands, he saw   something.  It came and went like a flash, but it gave him the impression  that the object had for a moment opened to him the view of a wide  and spacious and strange country; and, turning it about, he did, just  as the light faded, see the same vision again.  

Now, it would be tedious and unnecessary to state all the phases of  Mr. Cave's discovery from this point.  Suffice that the effect was this:  the crystal, being peered into at an angle of about 137 degrees from  the direction of the illuminating ray, gave a clear and consistent   picture of a wide and peculiar country-side.  It was not dream-like  at         all: it produced a definite impression of reality, and the better the  light the more real and solid it seemed.  It was a moving picture:  that is to say, certain objects moved in it, but slowly in an orderly  manner like real things, and, according as the direction of the lighting  and vision changed, the picture changed also.  It must, indeed, have  been like looking through an oval glass at a view, and turning the  glass about to get at different aspects.  

Mr. Cave's statements, Mr. Wace assures me, were extremely   circumstantial, and entirely free from any of that emotional quality that  taints hallucinatory impressions.  But it must be remembered that  all the efforts of Mr. Wace to see any similar clarity in the faint   opalescence of the crystal were wholly unsuccessful, try as he would.  The  difference in intensity of the impressions received by the two men  was very great, and it is quite conceivable that what was a view to  Mr. Cave was a mere blurred nebulosity to Mr. Wace.  

The view, as Mr. Cave described it, was invariably of an extensive  plain, and he seemed always to be looking at it from a considerable  height, as if from a tower or a mast.  To the east and to the west  the plain was bounded at a remote distance by vast reddish cliffs,  which reminded him of those he had seen in some picture; but what  the picture was Mr. Wace was unable to ascertain.  These cliffs passed  north and south—he could tell the points of the compass by the stars  that were visible of a night—receding in an almost illimitable   perspective and fading into the mists of the distance before they met.  He  was nearer the eastern set of cliffs, on the occasion of his first vision  the sun was rising over them, and black against the sunlight and pale  against their shadow appeared a multitude of soaring forms that Mr.  Cave regarded as birds.  A vast range of buildings spread below him;  he seemed to be looking down upon them; and, as they approached  the blurred and refracted edge of the picture, they became indistinct.   There were also trees curious in shape, and in colouring, a deep mossy  green and an exquisite grey, beside a wide and shining canal.  And  something great and brilliantly coloured flew across the picture.  But  the first time Mr. Cave saw these pictures he saw only in flashes, his  hands shook, his head moved, the vision came and went, and grew  foggy and indistinct.  And at first he had the greatest difficulty in   finding the picture again once the direction of it was lost.  

His next clear vision, which came about a week after the first, the  interval having yielded nothing but tantalising glimpses and some   useful experience, showed him the view down the length of the valley.  The view was different, but he had a curious persuasion, which his  subsequent observations abundantly confirmed, that he was regarding  this strange world from exactly the same spot, although he was   looking         in a different direction.  The long facade of the great building,  whose roof he had looked down upon before, was now receding in  perspective.  He recognised the roof.  In the front of the facade was  a terrace of massive proportions and extraordinary length, and down  the middle of the terrace, at certain intervals, stood huge but very  graceful masts, bearing small shiny objects which reflected the setting  sun.  The import of these small objects did not occur to Mr. Cave  until some time after, as he was describing the scene to Mr. Wace.   The terrace overhung a thicket of the most luxuriant and graceful  vegetation, and beyond this was a wide grassy lawn on which certain  broad creatures, in form like beetles but enormously larger, reposed.   Beyond this again was a richly decorated causeway of pinkish stone;  and beyond that, and lined with dense red weeds, and passing up  the valley exactly parallel with the distant cliffs, was a broad and  mirror-like expanse of water.  The air seemed full of squadrons of  great birds, manoeuvring in stately curves; and across the river was a  multitude of splendid buildings, richly coloured and glittering with  metallic tracery and facets, among a forest of moss-like and lichenous  trees.  And suddenly something flapped repeatedly across the vision, like  the fluttering of a jewelled fan or the beating of a wing, and a face, or  rather the upper part of a face with very large eyes, came as it were  close to his own and as if on the other side of the crystal.  Mr. Cave  was so startled and so impressed by the absolute reality of these eyes,  that he drew his head back from the crystal to look behind it.  He  had become so absorbed in watching that he was quite surprised to  find himself in the cool darkness of his little shop, with its familiar  odour of methyl, mustiness, and decay.  And, as he blinked about him,  the glowing crystal faded, and went out.  

Such were the first general impressions of Mr. Cave.  The story is  curiously direct and circumstantial.  From the outset, when the valley  first flashed momentarily on his senses, his imagination was strangely  affected, and, as he began to appreciate the details of the scene he  saw, his wonder rose to the point of a passion.  He went about his  business listless and distraught, thinking only of the time when he  should be able to return to his watching.  And then a few weeks  after his first sight of the valley came the two customers, the stress and  excitement of their offer, and the narrow escape of the crystal  from sale, as I have already told.  

Now, while the thing was Mr. Cave's secret, it remained a mere  wonder, a thing to creep to covertly and peep at, as a child might  peep upon a forbidden garden.  But Mr. Wace has, for a young scientific  investigator, a particularly lucid and consecutive habit of mind.   Directly the crystal and its story came to him, and he had satisfied         himself, by seeing the phosphorescence with his own eyes, that there  really was a certain evidence for Mr. Cave's statements, he proceeded  to develop the matter systematically.  Mr. Cave was only too eager to  come and feast his eyes on this wonderland he saw, and he came  every night from half-past eight until half-past ten, and sometimes,  in Mr. Wace's absence, during the day.  On Sunday afternoons, also,  he came.  From the outset Mr. Wace made copious notes, and it was  due to his scientific method that the relation between the direction  from which the initiating ray entered the crystal and the orientation  of the picture were proved.  And, by covering the crystal in a box  perforated only with a small aperture to admit the exciting ray, and  by substituting black holland for his buff blinds, he greatly improved  the conditions of the observations; so that in a little while they were  able to survey the valley in any direction they desired.  

So having cleared the way, we may give a brief account of this  visionary world within the crystal.  The things were in all cases seen  by Mr. Cave, and the method of working was invariably for him to  watch the crystal and report what he saw, while Mr. Wace (who as  a science student had learnt the trick of writing in the dark) wrote a  brief note of his report.  When the crystal faded, it was put into  its box in the proper position and the electric light turned on.  Mr.  Wace asked questions, and suggested observations to clear up difficult  points.  Nothing, indeed, could have been less visionary and more  matter-of-fact.  

The attention of Mr. Cave had been speedily directed to the bird-like creatures he had seen so abundantly present in each of his earlier  visions.  His first impression was soon corrected, and he considered  for a time that they might represent a diurnal species of bat.  Then he  thought, grotesquely enough, that they might be cherubs.  Their heads  were round, and curiously human, and it was the eyes of one of them  that had so startled him on his second observation.  They had broad,  silvery wings, not feathered, but glistening almost as brilliantly as  new-killed fish and with the same subtle play of colour, and these  wings were not built on the plan of a bird-wing or bat, Mr. Wace  learned, but supported by curved ribs radiating from the body. (A sort  of butterfly wing with curved ribs seems best to express their   appearance.) The body was small, but fitted with two bunches of prehensile  organs, like long tentacles, immediately under the mouth.  Incredible as  it appeared to Mr. Wace, the persuasion at last became irresistible,  that it was these creatures which owned the great quasi-human buildings  and the magnificent garden that made the broad valley so  splendid.  And Mr. Cave perceived that the buildings, with other   peculiarities, had no doors, but that the great circular windows, which         opened freely, gave the creatures egress and entrance.  They would  alight upon their tentacles, fold their wings to a smallness almost rod-like, and hop into the interior.  But among them was a multitude of  smaller-winged creatures, like great dragon-flies and moths and flying  beetles, and across the greensward brilliantly-coloured gigantic ground-beetles crawled lazily to and fro.  Moreover, on the causeways and  terraces, large-headed creatures similar to the greater winged flies, but  wingless, were visible, hopping busily upon their hand-like tangle of  tentacles.  

Allusion has already been made to the glittering objects upon masts  that stood upon the terrace of the nearer building.  It dawned upon  Mr. Cave, after regarding one of these masts very fixedly on one  particularly vivid day, that the glittering object there was a crystal  exactly like that into which he peered.  And a still more careful  scrutiny convinced him that each one in a vista of nearly twenty  carried a similar object.  

Occasionally one of the large flying creatures would flutter up to  one, and, folding its wings and coiling a number of its tentacles about  the mast, would regard the crystal fixedly for a space,—sometimes for  as long as fifteen minutes.  And a series of observations, made at the  suggestion of Mr. Wace, convinced both watchers that, so far as this  visionary world was concerned, the crystal into which they peered  actually stood at the summit of the end-most mast on the terrace, and  that on one occasion at least one of these inhabitants of this other  world had looked into Mr. Cave's face while he was making these  observations.  

So much for the essential facts of this very singular story.  Unless we  dismiss it all as the ingenious fabrication of Mr. Wace, we have to  believe one of two things: either that Mr. Cave's crystal was in two  worlds at once, and that, while it was carried about in one, it   remained stationary in the other, which seems altogether absurd; or  else that it had some peculiar relation of sympathy with another and  exactly similar crystal in this other world, so that what was seen  in the interior of the one in this world, was, under suitable conditions,  visible to an observer in the corresponding crystal in the other  world; and vice versa.  At present, indeed, we do not know of any  way in which two crystals could so come en rapport, but nowadays  we know enough to understand that the thing is not altogether   impossible.  This view of the crystals as en rapport was the supposition  that occurred to Mr. Wace, and to me at least it seems extremely   plausible. . . .  

And where was this other world? On this, also, the alert intelligence  of Mr. Wace speedily threw light.  After sunset, the sky darkened         rapidly—there was a very brief twilight interval indeed—and the stars  shone out.  They were recognisably the same as those we see, arranged  in the same constellations.  Mr. Cave recognised the Bear, the Pleiades,  Aldebaran, and Sirius: so that the other world must be somewhere in  the solar system, and, at the utmost, only a few hundreds of millions  of miles from our own.  Following up this clue, Mr. Wace learned that  the midnight sky was a darker blue even than our midwinter sky,  and that the sun seemed a little smaller.  And there were two small  moons! "like our moon but smaller, and quite differently marked" one  of which moved so rapidly that its motion was clearly visible as one  regarded it.  These moons were never high in the sky, but vanished  as they rose: that is, every time they revolved they were eclipsed   because they were so near their primary planet.  And all this answers  quite completely, although.  Mr. Cave did not know it, to what must  be the condition of things on Mars.  

Indeed, it seems an exceedingly plausible conclusion that peering  into this crystal Mr. Cave did actually see the planet Mars and its  inhabitants.  And, if that be the case, then the evening star that shone  so brilliantly in the sky of that distant vision, was neither more nor  less than our own familiar earth.  

For a time the Martians—if they were Martians—do not seem to have  known of Mr. Cave's inspection.  Once or twice one would come to  peer, and go away very shortly to some other mast, as though the  vision was unsatisfactory.  During this time Mr. Cave was able to  watch the proceedings of these winged people without being disturbed  by their attentions, and, although his report is necessarily vague and  fragmentary, it is nevertheless very suggestive.  Imagine the impression  of humanity a Martian observer would get who, after a difficult   process of preparation and with considerable fatigue to the eyes, was  able to peer at London from the steeple of St. Martin's Church for  stretches, at longest, of four minutes at a time.  Mr. Cave was unable  to ascertain if the winged Martians were the same as the Martians  who hopped about the causeways and terraces, and if the latter could  put on wings at will.  He several times saw certain clumsy bipeds, dimly  suggestive of apes, white and partially translucent, feeding among  certain of the lichenous trees, and once some of these fled before one  of the hopping, round-headed Martians.  The latter caught one in its  tentacles, and then the picture faded suddenly and left Mr. Cave most  tantalisingly in the dark.  On another occasion a vast thing, that Mr.  Cave thought at first was some gigantic insect, appeared advancing  along the causeway beside the canal with extraordinary rapidity.  As  this drew nearer Mr. Cave perceived that it was a mechanism of   shining       metals and of extraordinary complexity.  And then, when he looked  again, it had passed out of sight.  

After a time Mr. Wace aspired to attract the attention of the   Martians, and the next time that the strange eyes of one of them   appeared close to the crystal Mr. Cave cried out and sprang away, and  they immediately turned on the light and began to gesticulate in a  manner suggestive of signalling.  But when at last Mr. Cave examined  the crystal again the Martian had departed.  

Thus far these observations had progressed in early November, and  then Mr. Cave, feeling that the suspicions of his family about the  crystal were allayed, began to take it to and fro with him in order  that, as occasion arose in the daytime or night, he might comfort  himself with what was fast becoming the most real thing in his  existence.  

In December Mr. Wace's work in connection with a forthcoming   examination became heavy, the sittings were reluctantly suspended for  a week, and for ten or eleven days—he is not quite sure which—he saw  nothing of Cave.  He then grew anxious to resume these investigations,  and, the stress of his seasonal labours being abated, he went down to  Seven Dials.  At the corner he noticed a shutter before a bird fancier's  window, and then another at a cobbler's.  Mr. Cave's shop was closed.  

He rapped and the door was opened by the step-son in black.  He  at once called Mrs. Cave, who was, Mr. Wace could not but observe,  in cheap but ample widow's weeds of the most imposing pattern.   Without any very great surprise Mr. Wace learnt that Cave was dead  and already buried.  She was in tears, and her voice was a little thick.   She had just returned from Highgate.  Her mind seemed occupied with  her own prospects and the honourable details of the obsequies, but  Mr. Wace was at last able to learn the particulars of Cave's death.   He had been found dead in his shop in the early morning, the day  after his last visit to Mr. Wace, and the crystal had been clasped  in his stone-cold hands.  His face was smiling, said Mrs. Cave, and  the velvet cloth from the minerals lay on the floor at his feet.  He  must have been dead five or six hours when he was found.  

This came as a great shock to Wace, and he began to reproach   ho,self bitterly for having neglected the plain symptoms of the old man's  ill-health.  But his chief thought was of the crystal.  He approached  that topic in a gingerly manner, because he knew Mrs. Cave's   peculiarities.  He was dumbfoundered to learn that it was sold.  

Mrs. Cave's first impulse, directly Cave's body had been taken   upstairs, had been to write to the mad clergyman who had offered five  pounds for the crystal, informing him of its recovery; but after a  violent hunt in which her daughter joined her, they were convinced         of the loss of his address.  As they were without the means required  to mourn and bury Cave in the elaborate style the dignity of an old  Seven Dials inhabitant demands, they had appealed to a friendly   fellow-tradesman in Great Portland Street.  He had very kindly taken  over a portion of the stock at a valuation.  The valuation was his own  and the crystal egg was included in one of the lots.  Mr. Wace, after  a few suitable consolatory observations, a little offhandedly proffered  perhaps, hurried at once to Great Portland Street.  But there he  learned that the crystal egg had already been sold to a tall, dark man  in grey.  And there the material facts in this curious, and to me at  least very suggestive, story come abruptly to an end.  The Great   Portland Street dealer did not know who the tall dark man in grey was,  nor had he observed him with sufficient attention to describe him  minutely.  He did not even know which way this person had gone  after leaving the shop.  For a time Mr. Wace remained in the shop,  trying the dealer's patience with hopeless questions, venting his own  exasperation.  And at last, realising abruptly that the whole thing had  passed out of his hands, had vanished like a vision of the night, he  returned to his own rooms, a little astonished to find the notes he  had made still tangible and visible upon his untidy table.  

His annoyance and disappointment were naturally very great.  He  made a second call (equally ineffectual) upon the Great Portland  Street dealer, and he resorted to advertisements in such periodicals  as were likely to come into the hands of a bric-a-brac collector.  He  also wrote letters to The Daily Chronicle and Nature, but both those  periodicals, suspecting a hoax, asked him to reconsider his action  before they printed, and he was advised that such a strange story,   unfortunately so bare of supporting evidence, might imperil his reputation  as an investigator.  Moreover, the calls of his proper work were  urgent.  So that after a month or so, save for an occasional reminder  to certain dealers, he had reluctantly to abandon the quest for the  crystal egg, and from that day to this it remains undiscovered.  Occasionally, however, he tells me, and I can quite believe him, he has  bursts of zeal, in which he abandons his more urgent occupation and  resumes the search.  

Whether or not it will remain lost for ever, with the material and  origin of it, are things equally speculative at the present time.  If the  present purchaser is a collector, one would have expected the   enquiries of Mr. Wace to have readied him through the dealers.  He has  been able to discover Mr. Cave's clergyman and "Oriental"—no other  than the Rev. James Parker and the young Prince of Bosso-Kuni in  Java.  I am obliged to them for certain particulars.  The object of the  Prince was simply curiosity—and extravagance.  He was so eager to buy,         because Cave was so oddly reluctant to sell.  It is just as possible that  the buyer in the second instance was simply a casual purchaser and  not a collector at all, and the crystal egg, for all I know, may at the  present moment be within a mile of me, decorating a drawing-room  or serving as a paper-weight—its remarkable functions all unknown.   Indeed, it is partly with the idea of such a possibility that I have  thrown this narrative into a form that will give it a chance of being  read by the ordinary consumer of fiction.  

My own ideas in the matter are practically identical with those of  Mr. Wace.  I believe the crystal on the mast in Mars and the crystal  egg of Mr. Cave's to be in some physical, but at present quite   inexplicable, way en rapport, and we both believe further that the   terrestrial crystal must have been—possibly at some remote date—sent  hither from that planet, in order to give the Martians a near view of  our affairs.  Possibly the fellows to the crystals in the other masts are  also on our globe.  No theory of hallucination suffices for the facts.  

           
# THE MAN WHO COULD WORK MIRACLES; A PANTOUM IN   PROSE

    It is doubtful whether the gift was innate.  For my own part, I think it  came to him suddenly.  Indeed, until he was thirty he was a sceptic,  and did not believe in miraculous powers.  And here, since it is the  most convenient place, I must mention that he was a little man, and  had eyes of a hot brown, very erect red hair, a moustache with ends  that he twisted up, and freckles.  His name was George McWhirter  Fotheringay—not the sort of name by any means to lead to any   expectation of miracles—and he was clerk at Gomshott's.  He was greatly  addicted to assertive argument.  It was while he was asserting the   impossibility of miracles that he had his first intimation of his extraordinary  powers.  This particular argument was being held in the bar of the  Long Dragon, and Toddy Beamish was conducting the opposition by  a monotonous but effective "So you say," that drove Mr. Fotheringay  to the very limit of his patience.  

There were present, besides these two, a very dusty cyclist, landlord  Cox, and Miss Maybridge, the perfectly respectable and rather portly  barmaid of the Dragon.  Miss Maybridge was standing with her back  to Mr. Fotheringay, washing glasses; the others were watching him,  more or less amused by the present ineffectiveness of the assertive  method.  Goaded by the Torres Vedras tactics of Mr. Beamish, Mr.  Fotheringay determined to make an unusual rhetorical effort.  "Looky  here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Let us clearly understand  what a miracle is.  It's something contrariwise to the course of nature  done by power of Will, something what couldn't happen without being  specially willed."  

"So you say," said Mr. Beamish, repulsing him.             

Mr. Fotheringay appealed to the cyclist, who had hitherto been a  silent auditor, and received his assent—given with a hesitating cough  and a glance at Mr. Beamish.  The landlord would express no opinion,  and Mr. Fotheringay, returning to Mr. Beamish, received the unexpected  concession of a qualified assent to his definition of a miracle.  

"For instance," said Mr. Fotheringay, greatly encouraged.  "Here  would be a miracle.  That lamp, in the natural course of nature,  couldn't burn like that upsy-down, could it, Beamish?"  

"You say it couldn't," said Beamish.  

"And you?" said Fotheringay.  "You don't mean to say—eh?"  

"No," said Beamish reluctantly.  "No, it couldn't."  

"Very well," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Then here comes someone, as  it might be me, along here, and stands as it might be here, and says  to that lamp, as I might do, collecting all my will—Turn upsy-down  without breaking, and go on burning steady, and—Hullo!"  

It was enough to make anyone say "Hullo!" The impossible, the  incredible, was visible to them all.  The lamp hung inverted in the  air, burning quietly with its flame pointing down.  It was as solid, as  indisputable as ever a lamp was, the prosaic common lamp of the  Long Dragon bar.  

Mr. Fotheringay stood with an extended forefinger and the knitted  brows of one anticipating a catastrophic smash.  The cyclist, who was  sitting next the lamp, ducked and jumped across the bar.  Everybody  jumped, more or less.  Miss Maybridge turned and screamed.  For nearly  three seconds the lamp remained still.  A faint cry of mental distress  came from Mr. Fotheringay.  "I can't keep it up," he said, "any  longer." He staggered back, and the inverted lamp suddenly flared,  fell against the corner of the bar, bounced aside, smashed upon the  floor, and went out.  

It was lucky it had a metal receiver, or the whole place would have  been in a blaze.  Mr. Cox was the first to speak, and his remark, shorn  of needless excrescences, was to the effect that Fotheringay was a fool.   Fotheringay was beyond disputing even so fundamental a proposition  as that! He was astonished beyond measure at the thing that  had occurred.  The subsequent conversation threw absolutely no light  on the matter so far as Fotheringay was concerned; the general opinion  not only followed Mr. Cox very closely but very vehemently.  Everyone  accused Fotheringay of a silly trick, and presented him to himself  as a foolish destroyer of comfort and security.  His mind was in a  tornado of perplexity, he was himself inclined to agree with them, and  he made a remarkably ineffectual opposition to the proposal of his  departure.  

He went home flushed and heated, coat-collar crumpled, eyes   smarting         and ears red.  He watched each of the ten street lamps nervously as  he passed it. lt was only when he found himself alone in his little  bed-room in Church Row that he was able to grapple seriously with  his memories of the occurrence, and ask, "What on earth happened?"  

He had removed his coat and boots, and was sitting on the bed with  his hands in his pockets repeating the text of his defence for the  seventeenth time, "I didn't want the confounded thing to upset,"  when it occurred to him that at the precise moment he had said  the commanding words he had inadvertently willed the thing he said,  and that when he had seen the lamp in the air he had felt it depended  on him to maintain it there without being clear how this was to be  done.  He had not a particularly complex mind, or he might have  stuck for a time at that "inadvertently willed," embracing, as it does,  the abstrusest problems of voluntary action; but as it was, the idea  came to him with a quite acceptable haziness.  And from that, following,  as I must admit, no clear logical path, he came to the test of  experiment.  

He pointed resolutely to his candle and collected his mind, though  he felt he did a foolish thing.  "Be raised up," he said.  But in a  second that feeling vanished.  The candle was raised, hung in the air  one giddy moment, and as Mr. Fotheringay gasped, fell with a smash  on his toilet-table, leaving him in darkness save for the expiring glow  of its wick.  

For a time Mr. Fotheringay sat in the darkness, perfectly still.  "It  did happen, after all," he said.  "And 'ow I'm to explain it I don't  know." He sighed heavily, and began feeling in his pockets for a  match.  He could find none, and he rose and groped about the toilet-table.  "I wish I had a match," he said.  He resorted to his coat, and  there was none there, and then it dawned upon him that miracles  were possible even with matches.  He extended a hand and scowled  at it in the dark.  "Let there be a match in that hand," he said.  He felt  some light object fall across his palm, and his fingers closed upon a  match.  

After several ineffectual attempts to light this, he discovered it was a  safety-match.  He threw it down, and then it occurred to him that he  might have willed it lit.  He did, and perceived it burning in the midst  of his toilet-table mat.  He caught it up hastily, and it went out.  His  perception of possibilities enlarged, and he felt for and replaced the  candle in its candlestick.  "Here! you be lit," said Mr. Fotheringay,  and forthwith the candle was flaring, and he saw a little black hole  in the toilet-cover, with a wisp of smoke rising from it.  For a time he  stared from this to the little flame and back, and then looked up and         met his own gaze in the looking glass.  By this help he communed with  himself in silence for a time.  

"How about miracles now?" said Mr. Fotheringay at last, addressing  his reflection.  

The subsequent meditations of Mr. Fotheringay were of a severe  but confused description.  So far, he could see it was a case of pure  willing with him.  The nature of his experiences so far disinclined  him for any further experiments, at least until he had reconsidered  them.  But he lifted a sheet of paper, and turned a glass of water pink  and then green, and he created a snail, which he miraculously   annihilated, and got himself a miraculous new tooth-brush.  Somewhen  in the small hours he had reached the fact that his will-power must  be of a particularly rare and pungent quality, a fact of which he had  certainly had inklings before, but no certain assurance.  The scare and  perplexity of his first discovery was now qualified by pride in this  evidence of singularity and by vague intimations of advantage.  He   became aware that the church clock was striking one, and as it did  not occur to him that his daily duties at Gomshott's might be   miraculously dispensed with, he resumed undressing, in order to get to bed  without further delay.  As he struggled to get his shirt over his head,  he was struck with a brilliant idea.  "Let me be in bed," he said, and  found himself so.  "Undressed," he stipulated; and, finding the sheets  cold, added hastily, "and in my nightshirt—no, in a nice soft woollen  nightshirt.  Ah!" he said with immense enjoyment.  "And now let me  be comfortably asleep. . . . ."  

He awoke at his usual hour and was pensive all through breakfast-time, wondering whether his overnight experience might not be a  particularly vivid dream.  At length his mind turned again to cautious  experiments.  For instance, he had three eggs for breakfast; two his  landlady had supplied, good, but shoppy, and one was a delicious fresh  goose-egg, laid, cooked, and served by his extraordinary will.  He   hurried off to Gomshott's in a state of profound but carefully concealed  excitement, and only remembered the shell of the third egg when his  landlady spoke of it that night.  All day he could do no work because  of this astonishingly new self-knowledge, but this caused him no   inconvenience, because he made up for it miraculously in his last ten  minutes.  

As the day wore on his state of mind passed from wonder to elation,   albeit the circumstances of his dismissal from the Long Dragon  were still disagreeable to recall, and a garbled account of the matter  that had reached his colleagues led to some badinage.  It was evident  he must be careful how he lifted frangible articles, but in other ways  his gift promised more and more as he turned it over in his mind.         He intended among other things to increase his personal property  by unostentatious acts of creation.  He called into existence a pair of  very splendid diamond studs, and hastily annihilated them again as  young Gomshott came across the counting-house to his desk.  He was  afraid young Gomshott might wonder how he had come by them.  He  saw quite clearly the gift required caution and watchfulness in its  exercise, but so far as he could judge the difficulties attending its  mastery would be no greater than those he had already faced in the  study of cycling.  It was that analogy, perhaps, quite as much as the  feeling that he would be unwelcome in the Long Dragon, that drove  him out after supper into the lane beyond the gas-works, to   rehearse a few miracles in private.  

There was possibly a certain want of originality in his attempts,  for apart from his will-power Mr. Fotheringay was not a very   exceptional man.  The miracle of Moses' rod came to his mind, but  the night was dark and unfavourable to the proper control of large  miraculous snakes.  Then he recollected the story of "Tannhauser" that  he had read on the back of the Philharmonic programme.  That seemed  to him singularly attractive and harmless.  He stuck his walking-stick—a very nice Poona-Penang lawyer—into the turf that edged the  footpath, and commanded the dry wood to blossom.  The air was   immediately full of the scent of roses, and by means of a match he saw  for himself that this beautiful miracle was indeed accomplished.  His  satisfaction was ended by advancing footsteps.  Afraid of a premature  discovery of his powers, he addressed the blossoming stick hastily: "Go  back." What he meant was "Change back;" but of course he was  confused.  The stick receded at a considerable velocity, and   incontinently came a cry of anger and a bad word from the approaching  person.  "Who are you throwing brambles at, you fool?" cried a voice.   "That got me on the shin."  

"I'm sorry, old chap," said Mr. Fotheringay, and then realising  the awkward nature of the explanation, caught nervously at his  moustache.  He saw Winch, one of the three Immering constables,   advancing.  

"What d'yer mean by it?" asked the constable.  "Hullo! it's you, is it?  The gent that broke the lamp at the Long Dragon!"  

"I don't mean anything by it," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Nothing at  all."  

"What d'yer do it for then?"  

"Oh, bother!" said Mr. Fotheringay.  

"Bother indeed! D'yer know that stick hurt? What d'yer do it for,  eh?"  

For the moment Mr. Fotheringay could not think what he had         done it for.  His silence seemed to irritate Mr. Winch.  "You've been  assaulting the police, young man, this time.  That's what you done."  

"Look here, Mr. Winch," said Mr. Fotheringay, annoyed and   confused, "I'm very sorry.  The fact is—"  

"Well?"  

He could think of no way but the truth.  "I was working a miracle."  He tried to speak in an off-hand way, but try as he would he couldn't.  

'—Working a—! 'Ere, don't you talk rot.  Working a miracle, indeed!  Miracle! Well, that's downright funny! Why, you's the chap that don't  believe in miracles. . . . .    Fact is, this is another of your silly   conjuring tricks—that's what this is.  Now, I tell you—"  

But Mr. Fotheringay never heard what Mr. Winch was going to  tell him.  He realised he had given himself away, flung his valuable  secret to all the winds of heaven.  A violent gust of irritation swept  him to action.  He turned on the constable swiftly and fiercely.  "Here,"  he said, "I've had enough of this, I have! I'll show you a silly   conjuring trick, I will! Go to Hades! Go, now!"  

He was alone!  

Mr. Fotheringay performed no more miracles that night nor did  he trouble to see what had become of his flowering stick.  He returned  to the town, scared and very quiet, and went to his bed-room.  "Lord!"  he said, "it's a powerful gift—an extremely powerful gift.  I didn't  hardly mean as much as that.  Not really. . . . I wonder what Hades  is like!"  

He sat on the bed taking off his boots.  Struck by a happy thought  he transferred the constable to San Francisco, and without any more  interference with normal causation went soberly to bed.  In the night  he dreamt of the anger of Winch.  

The next day Mr. Fotheringay heard two interesting items of news.   Someone had planted a most beautiful climbing rose against the elder  Mr. Gomshott's private house in the Lullaborough Road, and the  river as far as Rawling's Mill was to be dragged for Constable Winch.  

Mr. Fotheringay was abstracted and thoughtful all that day, and  performed no miracles except certain provisions for Winch, and the  miracle of completing his day's work with punctual perfection in spite  of all the bee-swarm of thoughts that hummed through his mind.  And  the extraordinary abstraction and meekness of his manner was   remarked by several people, and made a matter for jesting.  For the  most part he was thinking of Winch.  

On Sunday evening he went to chapel and oddly enough, Mr.  Maydig, who took a certain interest in occult matters, preached about  "things that are not lawful." Mr. Fotheringay was not a regular chapel  goer, but the system of assertive scepticism, to which I have already         alluded, was now very much shaken.  The tenor of the sermon threw  an entirely new light on these novel gifts, and he suddenly decided  to consult Mr. Maydig immediately after the service.  So soon as that  was determined, he found himself wondering why he had not done  so before.  

Mr. Maydig, a lean, excitable man with quite remarkably long wrists  and neck, was gratified at a request for a private conversation from  a young man whose carelessness in religious matters was a subject for  general remark in the town.  After a few necessary delays, he conducted  him to the study of the Manse, which was contiguous to the dispel,  seated him comfortably, and, standing in front of a cheerful fire—  his legs threw a Rhodian arch of shadow on the opposite wall—  requested Mr. Fotheringay to state his business.  

At first Mr. Fotheringay was a little abashed, and found some  difficulty in opening the matter.  "You will scarcely believe me, Mr.  Maydig, I am afraid"—and so forth for some time.  He tried a question  at last, and asked Mr. Maydig his opinion of miracles.  

Mr. Maydig was still saying "Well" in an extremely judicial tone,  when Mr. Fotheringay interrupted again: "You don't believe, I   suppose, that some common sort of person—like myself, for instance—as  it might be sitting here now, might have some sort of twist inside him  that made him able to do things by his will."  

"It's possible," said Mr. Maydig.  "Something of the sort, perhaps,  is possible."  

"If I might make free with something here, I think I might show  you by a sort of experiment," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Now, take that  tobacco-jar on the table, for instance.  What I want to know is  whether what I am going to do with it is a miracle or not.  Just half  a minute, Mr. Maydig, please."  

He knitted his brows, pointed to the tobacco-jar and said: "Be  a bowl of violets."  

The tobacco-jar did as it was ordered.  

Mr. Maydig started violently at the change, and stood looking  from the thaumaturgist to the bowl of flowers.  He said nothing.   Presently he ventured to lean over the table and smell the violets; they  were fresh-picked and very fine ones.  Then he stared at Mr.  Fotheringay again.  

"How did you do that?" he asked.  

Mr. Fotheringay pulled his moustache.  "Just told it—and there you  are.  Is that a miracle, or is it black art, or what is it? And what do  you think's the matter with me? That's what I want to ask."  

"It's a most extraordinary occurrence."  

"And this day last week I knew no more that I could do things like         that than you did.  It came quite sudden.  It's something odd about my  will, I suppose, and that's as far as I can see."  

"Is that—the only thing? Could you do other things besides that?"  

"Lord, yes! said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Just anything." He thought, and  suddenly recalled a conjuring entertainment he had seen.  "Here!" He  pointed.  "Change into a bowl of fish—no, not that—change into a  glass bowl full of water with goldfish swimming in it.  That's better!  You see that, Mr. Maydig?"  

"It's astonishing.  It's incredible.  You are either a most extraordinary  . . .  But no—"  

"I could change it into anything," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Just  anything.  Here! be a pigeon, will you?"  

In another moment a blue pigeon was fluttering round the room  and making Mr. Maydig duck every time it came near him.  "Stop  there, will you," said Mr. Fotheringay; and the pigeon hung motionless  in the air.  "I could change it back to a bowl of flowers," he said, and  after replacing the pigeon on the table worked that miracle.  "I   expect you will want your pipe in a bit," he said, and restored the   tobacco-jar.  

Mr. Maydig had followed all these later changes in a sort of   ejaculatory silence.  He stared at Mr. Fotheringay and, in a very gingerly  manner, picked up the tobacco-jar, examined it, replaced it on the  table.  "Well!" was the only expression of his feelings.  

"Now, after that it's easier to explain what I came about," said  Mr. Fotheringay; and proceeded to a lengthy and involved narrative of  his strange experiences, beginning with the affair of the lamp in the  Long Dragon and complicated by persistent allusions to Winch.  As  he went on, the transient pride Mr. Maydig's consternation had  caused passed away; he became the very ordinary Mr. Fotheringay of  everyday intercourse again.  Mr. Maydig listened intently, the tobacco-jar in his hand, and his bearing changed also with the course of  the narrative.  Presently, while Mr. Fotheringay was dealing with the  miracle of the third egg, the minister interrupted with a fluttering  extended hand—  

"It is possible," he said.  "It is credible.  It is amazing, of course, but  it reconciles a number of amazing difficulties.  The power to work  miracles is a gift—a peculiar quality like genius or second sight—  hitherto it has come very rarely and to exceptional people.  But in  this case . . . I have always wondered at the miracles of Mahomet,  and at Yogi's miracles, and the miracles of Madame Blavatsky.  But, of  course! Yes, it is simply a gift! It carries out so beautifully the   arguments of that great thinker"—Mr.  Maydig's voice sank—"his   Grace the         Duke of Argyll.  Here we plumb some profounder law—deeper than  the ordinary laws of nature.  Yes—yes.  Go on.  Go on!"  

Mr. Fotheringay proceeded to tell of his misadventure with Winch,  and Mr. Maydig, no longer overawed or scared, began to jerk his  limbs about and interject astonishment.  "It's this what troubled me  most," proceeded Mr. Fotheringay; "it's this I'm most mijitly in want  of advice for; of course he's at San Francisco—wherever San Francisco  may be—but of course it's awkward for both of us, as you'll see, Mr.  Maydig.  I don't see how he can understand what has happened, and  I daresay he's scared and exasperated something tremendous, and  trying to get at me.  I daresay he keeps on starting off to come here.   I send him back, by a miracle, every few hours, when I think of it.   And of course, that's a thing he won't be able to understand, and it's  bound to annoy him; and, of course, if he takes a ticket every time  it will cost him a lot of money.  I done the best I could for him, but  of course it's difficult for him to put himself in my place.  I thought  afterwards that his clothes might have got scorched, you know—if  Hades is all it's supposed to be—before I shifted him.  In that case I  suppose they'd have locked him up in San Francisco.  Of course I  willed him a new suit of clothes on him directly I thought of it.   But, you see, I'm already in a deuce of a tangle—"  

Mr. Maydig looked serious.  "I see you are in a tangle.  Yes, it's a  difficult position.  How you are to end it . . ."  He became diffuse and  inconclusive.  

"However, we'll leave Winch for a little and discuss the larger  question.  I don't think this is a case of the black art or anything of  the sort.  I don't think there is any taint of criminality about it at  all, Mr. Fotheringay—none whatever, unless you are suppressing   material facts.  No, it's miracles—pure miracles—miracles, if I may say so,  of the very highest class."  

He began to pace the hearthrug and gesticulate, while Mr.  Fotheringay sat with his arm on the table and his head on his arm, looking  worried.  "I don't see how I'm to manage about Winch," he said.  

"A gift of working miracles—apparently a very powerful gift," said  Mr. Maydig, "will find a way about Winch—never fear.  My dear  Sir, you are a most important man—a man of the most astonishing  possibilities.  As evidence, for example! And—in other ways, the things  you may do . . . ."  

"Yes, I've thought of a thing or two," said Mr. Fotheringay— "But  —some of the things came a bit twisty.  You saw that fish at first?  Wrong sort of bowl and wrong sort of fish.  And I thought I'd ask  someone."  

"A proper course," said Mr. Maydig, "a very proper course—  altogether       the proper course." He stopped and looked at Mr. Fotheringay.   "It's practically an unlimited gift.  Let us test your powers, for   instance.  If they really are . . . If they really are all they seem to be."  

And so, incredible as it may seem, in the study of the little house  behind the Congregational Chapel, on the evening of Sunday, Nov.  10, 1896, Mr. Fotheringay, egged on and inspired by Mr. Maydig,  began to work miracles.  The reader's attention is specially and   definitely called to the date.  He will object, probably has already   objected, that certain points in this story are improbable, that if any  things of the sort already described had indeed occurred, they would  have been in all the papers a year ago.  The details immediately   following he will find particularly hard to accept, because among other  things they involve the conclusion that he or she, the reader in  question, must have been killed in a violent and unprecedented   manner more than a year ago.  Now a miracle is nothing if not improbable,  and as a matter of fact the reader was killed in a violent and  unprecedented manner a year ago.  In the subsequent course of this  story that will become perfectly clear and credible, as every right-minded and reasonable reader will admit.  But this is not the place  for the end of the story, being but little beyond the hither side of  the middle.  And at first the miracles worked by Mr. Fotheringay were  timid little miracles—little things with the cups and parlour fitments—  as feeble as the miracles of Theosophists, and, feeble as they were,  they were received with awe by his collaborator.  He would have  preferred to settle the Winch business out of hand, but Mr. Maydig  would not let him.  But after they had worked a dozen of these  domestic trivialities, their sense of power grew, their imagination  began to show signs of stimulation, and their ambition enlarged.  Their  first larger enterprise was due to hunger and the negligence of Mrs.  Minchin, Mr. Maydig's housekeeper.  The meal to which the minister  conducted Mr. Fotheringay was certainly ill-laid and uninviting as  refreshment for two industrious miracle-workers; but they were seated,  and Mr. Maydig was descanting in sorrow rather than in anger upon  his housekeeper's shortcomings, before it occurred to Mr. Fotheringay  that an opportunity lay before him.  "Don't you think, Mr. Maydig,"  he said; "if it isn't a liberty, I—"  

"My dear Mr. Fotheringay! Of course! No—I didn't think."  

Mr. Fotheringay waved his hand.  "What shall we have?" he said,  in a large, inclusive spirit, and, at Mr. Maydig's order, revised the  supper very thoroughly.  "As for me," he said, eyeing Mr. Maydig's  selection, "I am always particularly fond of a tankard of stout and a  nice Welsh rarebit, and I'll order that.  I ain't much given to   Burgundy," and forthwith stout and Welsh rarebit promptly appeared         at his command.  They sat long at their supper, talking like equals,  as Mr. Fotheringay presently perceived, with a glow of surprise and  gratification, of all the miracles they would presently do.  "And, by  the bye, Mr. Maydig," said Mr. Fotheringay, "I might perhaps be able  to help you—in a domestic way."  

"Don't quite follow," said Mr. Maydig pouring out a glass of   miraculous old Burgundy.  

Mr. Fotheringay helped himself to a second Welsh rarebit out of  vacancy, and took a mouthful.  "I was thinking," he said, "I might  be able (chum, chum) to work (chum, chum) a miracle with Mrs.  Minchin (chum, chum)—make her a better woman."  

Mr. Maydig put down the glass and looked doubtful.  "She's—  She strongly objects to interference, you know, Mr. Fotheringay.   And—as a matter of fact—it's well past eleven and she's probably in  bed and asleep.  Do you think, on the whole—"  

Mr. Fotheringay considered these objections.  "I don't see that it  shouldn't be done in her sleep."  

For a time Mr. Maydig opposed the idea, and then he yielded.   Mr. Fotheringay issued his orders, and a little less at their ease,   perhaps, the two gentlemen proceeded with their repast.  Mr. Maydig  was enlarging on the changes he might expect in his housekeeper  next day, with an optimism that seemed even to Mr. Fotheringay's  supper senses a little forced and hectic, when a series of confused  noises from upstairs began.  Their eyes exchanged interrogations,  and Mr. Maydig left the room hastily.  Mr. Fotheringay heard him  calling up to his housekeeper and then his footsteps going softly up  to her.  

In a minute or so the minister returned, his step light, his face  radiant.  "Wonderful!" he said, "and touching! Most touching!"  

He began pacing the hearthrug.  "A repentance—a most touching  repentance—through the crack of the door.  Poor woman! A most  wonderful change! She had got up.  She  must have got up at once.  She  had got up out of her sleep to smash  a private bottle of brandy in  her box.  And to confess it tool . . . But this gives us—it opens—a  most amazing vista of possibilities.  If  we can work this miraculous  change in her. . . ."  

"The thing's unlimited seemingly,"  said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And  about Mr. Winch—"  

"Altogether unlimited." And from  the hearthrug Mr. Maydig,  waving the Winch difficulty aside, unfolded a series of wonderful  proposals—proposals he invented as he went along.  

Now what those proposals were does not concern the essentials  of this story.  Suffice it that they were designed in a spirit of infinite         benevolence, the sort of benevolence that used to be called post-prandial.  Suffice it, too, that the problem of Winch remained   unsolved.  Nor is it necessary to describe how far that series got to its  fulfilment.  There were astonishing changes.  The small hours found  Mr. Maydig and Mr. Fotheringay careering across the chilly market-square under the still moon, in a sort of ecstasy of thaumaturgy, Mr.  Maydig all flap and gesture, Mr. Fotheringay short and bristling, and  no longer abashed at his greatness.  They had reformed every drunkard  in the Parliamentary division, changed all the beer and alcohol  to water (Mr.  Maydig had overruled Mr. Fotheringay on this point);  they had, further, greatly improved the railway communication of  the place, drained Flinder's swamp, improved the soil of One Tree  Hill, and cured the Vicar's wart.  And they were going to see what  could be done with the injured pier at South Bridge.  "The place,"  gasped Mr. Maydig, "won't be the same place to-morrow.  How   surprised and thankful everyone will be!" And just at that moment the  church clock struck three.  

"I say," said Mr. Fotheringay, "that's three o'clock! I must be getting  back.  I've got to be at business by eight.  And besides, Mrs. Wimms—"  

"We're only beginning," said Mr. Maydig, full of the sweetness of  unlimited power.  "We're only beginning.  Think of all the good we're  doing.  When people wake—"  

"But—," said Mr. Fotheringay.  

Mr. Maydig gripped his arm suddenly.  His eyes were bright and  wild.  "My dear chap," he said, "there's no hurry.  "Look"—he pointed  to the moon at the zenith—"Joshua!"  

"Joshua?" said Mr. Fotheringay.  

"Joshua," said Mr. Maydig.  "Why not? Stop it."  

Mr. Fotheringay looked at the moon.  

"That's a bit tall," he said after a pause.  

"Why not?" said Mr. Maydig.  "Of course it doesn't stop.  You stop  the rotation of the earth, you know.  Time stops.  It isn't as if we were  doing harm."  

"H'm!" said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Well." He sighed.  "I'll try.  Here—"  

He buttoned up his jacket and addressed himself to the habitable  globe, with as good an assumption of confidence as lay in his power.   "Jest stop rotating, will you," said Mr. Fotheringay.  

Incontinently he was flying head over heels through the air at  the rate of dozens of miles a minute.  In spite of the innumerable  circles he was describing per second, he thought; for thought is   wonderful—sometimes as sluggish as flowing pitch, sometimes as   instantaneous as light.  He thought in a second, and willed.  "Let me come         down safe and sound.  Whatever else happens, let me down safe and  sound."  

He willed it only just in time, for his clothes, heated by his rapid  flight through the air, were already beginning to singe.  He came  down with a forcible, but by no means injurious bump in what  appeared to be a mound of fresh-turned earth.  A large mass of metal  and masonry, extraordinarily like the clock-tower in the middle of  the market-square, hit the earth near him, ricochetted over him, and  flew into stonework, bricks, and masonry, like a bursting bomb.  A  hurtling cow hit one of the larger blocks and smashed like an egg.   There was a crash that made all the most violent crashes of his past  life seem like the sound of falling dust, and this was followed by a  descending series of lesser crashes.  A vast wind roared throughout  earth and heaven' so that he could scarcely lift his head to look.   For a while he was too breathless and astonished even to see where  he was or what had happened.  And his first movement was to feel his  head and reassure himself that his streaming hair was still his own.  

"Lord!" gasped Mr. Fotheringay, scarce able to speak for the gale,  "I've had a squeak! What's gone wrong? Storms and thunder.  And  only a minute ago a fine night.  It's Maydig set me on to this sort of  thing.  What a wind! If I go on fooling in this way I'm bound to  have a thundering accident! . . .  

"Where's Maydig?  

"What a confounded mess everything's in!"  

He looked about him so far as his flapping jacket would permit.   The appearance of things was really extremely strange.  "The sky's  all right anyhow," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And that's about all that  is all right.  And even there it looks like a terrific gale coming up.   But there's the moon overhead. just as it was just now.  Bright as  midday.  But as for the rest—Where's the village? Where's—where's  anything? And what on earth set this wind ablowing? I didn't order  no wind."  

Mr. Fotheringay struggled to get to his feet in vain, and after one  failure, remained on all fours, holding on.  He surveyed the moonlit  world to leeward, with the tails of his jacket streaming over his  head.  "There's something seriously wrong," said Mr. Fotheringay.   "And what it is—goodness knows."  

Far and wide nothing was visible in the white glare through the  haze of dust that drove before a screaming gale but tumbled masses  of earth and heaps of inchoate ruins, no trees, no houses, no familiar  shapes, only a wilderness of disorder vanishing at last into the   darkness beneath the whirling columns and streamers, the lightnings and  thunderings of a swiftly rising storm.  Near him in the livid glare         was something that might once have been an elm-tree, a smashed  mass of splinters, shivered from boughs to base, and further a  twisted mass of iron girders—only too evidently the viaduct—rose  out of the piled confusion.  

You see when Mr. Fotheringay had arrested the rotation of the  solid globe, he had made no stipulation concerning the trifling  movables upon its surface.  And the earth spins so fast that the   surface at its equator is travelling at rather more than a thousand miles  an hour, and in these latitudes at more than half that pace.  So that  the village, and Mr. Maydig, and Mr. Fotheringay, and everybody  and everything had been jerked violently forward at about nine miles  per second—that is to say, much more violently than if they had been  fired out of a cannon.  And every human being, every living creature,  every house, and every tree—all the world as we know it—had been  so jerked and smashed and utterly destroyed.  That was all.  

These things Mr. Fotheringay did not, of course, fully appreciate.   But he perceived that his miracle had miscarried, and with that a  great disgust of miracles came upon him.  He was in darkness now,  for the clouds had swept together and blotted out his momentary  glimpse of the moon, and the air was full of fitful struggling tortured  wraiths of hail.  A great roaring of wind and waters filled earth and  sky, and, peering under his hand through the dust and sleet to   windward, he saw by the play of the lightnings a vast wall of water   pouring towards him.  

"Maydig!" screamed Mr. Fotheringay's feeble voice amid the   elemental uproar.  "Here!—Maydig!"  

"Stop!" cried Mr. Fotheringay to the advancing water.  "Oh, for  goodness' sake, stop!"  

"Just a moment," said Mr. Fotheringay to the lightnings and   thunder.  "Stop jest a moment while I collect my thoughts. . . . And now  what shall I do?" he said.  "What shall I do? Lord! I wish Maydig  was about."  

"I know," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "And for goodness' sake let's have  it right this time."  

He remained on all fours, leaning against the wind, very intent  to have everything right.  

"Ah!" he said.  "Let nothing what I'm going to order happen until  I say 'Off!' . . . Lord! I wish I'd thought of that before!"  

He lifted his little voice against the whirlwind, shouting louder and  louder in the vain desire to hear himself speak.  "Now then!—here  goes! Mind about that what I said just now.  In the first place, when  all I've got to say is done, let me lose my miraculous power, let my  will become just like anybody else's will, and all these dangerous         miracles be stopped.  I don't like them.  I'd rather I didn't work 'em.   Ever so much.  That's the first thing.  And the second is—let me be  back just before the miracles begin; let everything be just as it was  before that blessed lamp turned up.  It's a big job, but it's the last.   Have you got it? No more miracles, everything as it was—me back in  the Long Dragon just before I drank my half-pint.  That's it! Yes."  

He dug his fingers into the mould, closed his eyes, and said "Off!"  

Everything became perfectly still.  He perceived that he was standing  erect.  

"So you say," said a voice.  

He opened his eyes.  He was in the bar of the Long Dragon,   arguing about miracles with Toddy Beamish.  He had a vague sense of  some great thing forgotten that instantaneously passed.  You see,  except for the loss of his miraculous powers, everything was back as  it had been; his mind and memory therefore were now just as they  had been at the time when this story began.  So that he knew   absolutely nothing of all that is told here, knows nothing of all that is  told here to this day.  And among other things, of course, he still  did not believe in miracles.  

"I tell you that miracles, properly speaking, can't possibly happen,"  he said, "whatever you like to hold.  And I'm prepared to prove it up  to the hilt."  

"That's what you think," said Toddy Beamish, and "Prove it if  you can."  

"Looky here, Mr. Beamish," said Mr. Fotheringay.  "Let us clearly  understand what a miracle is.  It's something contrariwise to the  course of nature done by power of Will . . ."  

               
# THE PLATTNER STORY

    Whether the story of Gottfried Plattner is to be credited or not, is  a pretty question in the value of evidence.  On the one hand, we have  seven witnesses—to be perfectly exact, we have six and a half pairs of  eyes, and one undeniable fact; and on the other we have—what is it?  —prejudice, common sense, the inertia of opinion.  Never were there  seven more honest-seeming witnesses; never was there a more undeniable,  fact than the inversion of Gottfried Plattner's anatomical structure,  and—never was there a more preposterous story than the one they  have to tell! The most preposterous part of the story is the worthy  Gottfried's contribution (for I count him as one of the seven).  Heaven  forbid that I should be led into giving countenance to superstition  by a passion for impartiality, and so come to share the fate of   Eusapia's patrons! Frankly, I believe there is something crooked about  this business of Gottfried Plattner; but what that crooked factor is,  I will admit as frankly, I do not know.  I have been surprised at the  credit accorded to the story in the most unexpected and authoritative  quarters.  The fairest way to the reader, however, will be for me to  tell it without further comment.  

Gottfried Plattner is, in spite of his name, a freeborn Englishman.   His father was an Alsatian who came to England in the Sixties,   married a respectable English girl of unexceptionable antecedents, and  died, after a wholesome and uneventful life (devoted, I understand,  chiefly to the laying of parquet flooring), in 1887.  Gottfried's age is  seven-and-twenty.  He is, by virtue of his heritage of three languages,  Modern Languages Master in a small private school in the South of  England.  To the casual observer he is singularly like any other   Modern         Languages Master in any other small private school.  His costume  is neither very costly nor very fashionable, but, on the other hand,  it is not markedly cheap or shabby; his complexion, like his height  and his bearing, is inconspicuous.  You would notice, perhaps, that,  like the majority of people, his face was not absolutely symmetrical,  his right eye a little larger than the left, and his jaw a trifle heavier  on the right side.  If you, as an ordinary careless person, were to bare  his chest and feel his heart beating, you would probably find it quite  like the heart of any one else.  But here you and the trained observer  would part company.  If you found his heart quite ordinary, the  trained observer would find it quite otherwise.  And once the thing  was pointed out to you, you too would perceive the peculiarity easily  enough.  It is that Gottfried's heart beats on the right side of his  body.  

Now, that is not the only singularity of Gottfried's structure,   although it is the only one that would appeal to the untrained mind.   Careful sounding of Gottfried's internal arrangements, by a well-known surgeon, seems to point to the fact that all the other   unsymmetrical parts of his body are similarly misplaced.  The right lobe of  his liver is on the left side, the left on his right; while his lungs,  too, are similarly contraposed.  What is still more singular, unless  Gottfried is a consummate actor, we must believe that his right hand  has recently become his left.  Since the occurrences we are about to  consider (as impartially as possible), he has found the utmost difficulty  in writing, except from right to left across the paper with his left  hand.  He cannot throw with his right hand, he is perplexed at meal  times between knife and fork, and his ideas of the rule of the road—  he is a cyclist—are still a dangerous confusion.  And there is not a  scrap of evidence to show that before these occurrences Gottfried  was at all left-handed.  

There is yet another wonderful fact in this preposterous business.   Gottfried produces three photographs of himself.  You have him at  the age of five or six, thrusting fat legs at you from under a plaid  frock, and scowling.  In that photograph his left eye is a little larger  than his right, and his jaw is a. trifle heavier on the left side.  This is  the reverse of his present living conditions.  The photograph of   Gottfried at fourteen seems to contradict these facts, but that is because  it is one of those cheap "Gem" photographs that were then in vogue,  taken direct upon metal, and therefore reversing things just as a  looking-glass would.  The third photograph represents him at one-and-twenty, and confirms the record of the others.  There seems here  evidence of the strongest confirmatory character that Gottfried has  exchanged his left side for his right.  Yet how a human being can be so         changed, short of a fantastic and pointless miracle, it is exceedingly  hard to suggest.  

In one way, of course, these facts might be explicable on the   supposition that Plattner has undertaken an elaborate mystification, on  the strength of his heart's displacement.  Photographs may be fudged,  and left-handedness imitated.  But the character of the man does  not lend itself to any such theory.  He is quiet, practical, unobtrusive,  and thoroughly sane, from the Nordau standpoint.  He likes beer,  and smokes moderately, takes walking exercise daily, and has a healthily  high estimate of the value of his teaching.  He has a good but  untrained tenor voice, and takes a pleasure in singing airs of a   popular and cheerful character.  He is fond, but not morbidly fond, of  reading,—chiefly fiction pervaded with a vaguely pious optimism,—  sleeps well, and rarely dreams.  He is, in fact, the very last person  to evolve a fantastic fable.  Indeed, so far from forcing this story  upon the world, he has been singularly reticent on the matter.  He  meets enquirers with a certain engaging—bashfulness is almost the  word, that disarms the most suspicious.  He seems genuinely ashamed  that anything so unusual has occurred to him.  

It is to be regretted that Plattner's aversion to the idea of post-mortem dissection may postpone, perhaps for ever, the positive proof  that his entire body has had its left and right sides transposed.  Upon  that fact mainly the credibility of his story hangs.  There is no way of  taking a man and moving him about in space, as ordinary people  understand space, that will result in our changing his sides.  Whatever  you do, his right is still his right, his left his left.  You can do that  with a perfectly thin and flat thing, of course.  If you were to cut a  figure out of paper, any figure with a right and left side, you could  change its sides simply by lifting it up and turning it over.  But with  a solid it is different.  Mathematical theorists tell us that the only way  in which the right and left sides of a solid body can be changed is  by taking that body clean out of space as we know it,—taking it out  of ordinary existence, that is, and turning it somewhere outside space.   This is a little abstruse, no doubt, but any one with any knowledge  of mathematical theory will assure the reader of its truth.  To put  the thing in technical language, the curious inversion of Plattner's  right and left sides is proof that he has moved out of our space into  what is called the Fourth Dimension, and that he has returned again  to our world.  Unless we choose to consider ourselves the victims of  an elaborate and motiveless fabrication, we are almost bound to   believe that this has occurred.  

So much for the tangible facts.  We come now to the account of the  phenomena that attended his temporary disappearance from the         world.  It appears that in the Sussexville Proprietary School Plattner  not only discharged the duties of Modern Languages Master, but also  taught chemistry, commercial geography, book-keeping, shorthand,  drawing, and any other additional subject to which the changing  fancies of the boys' parents might direct attention.  He knew little  or nothing of these various subjects, but in secondary as distinguished  from Board or elementary schools, knowledge in the teacher is, very  properly, by no means so necessary as high moral character and   gentlemanly tone.  In chemistry he was particularly deficient, knowing,  he says, nothing beyond the Three Gases (whatever the three gases  may be).  As, however, his pupils began by knowing nothing, and  derived all their information from him, this caused him (or any one)  but little inconvenience for several terms.  Then a little boy named  Whibble joined the school, who had been educated (it seems) by some  mischievous relative into an enquiring habit of mind.  This little boy  followed Plattner's lessons with marked and sustained interest, and  in order to exhibit his zeal on the subject, brought, at various times,  substances for Plattner to analyse.  Plattner, flattered by this evidence  of his power of awakening interest, and trusting to the boy's ignorance,  analysed these, and even made general statements as to their   composition.  Indeed, he was so far stimulated by his pupil as to obtain  a work upon analytical chemistry and study it during his supervision  of the evening's preparation.  He was surprised to find chemistry  quite an interesting subject.  

So far the story is absolutely commonplace.  But now the greenish  powder comes upon the scene.  The source of that greenish powder  seems, unfortunately, lost.  Master Whibble tells a tortuous story of  finding it done up in a packet in a disused limekiln near the downs.  It would have been an excellent thing for Plattner, and possibly for  Master Whibble's family, if a match could have been applied to that  powder there and then.  The young gentleman certainly did not bring  it to school in a packet, but in a common eight-ounce graduated  medicine bottle, plugged with masticated newspaper.  He gave it to  Plattner at the end of the afternoon school.  Four boys had been   detained after school prayers in order to complete some neglected tasks,  and Plattner was supervising these in the small classroom in which  the chemical teaching was conducted.  The appliances for the practical  teaching of chemistry in the Sussexville Proprietary School, as  in most small schools in this country, are characterised by a severe  simplicity.  They are kept in a small cupboard standing in a recess,  and having about the same capacity as a common travelling trunk.   Plattner, being bored with his passive superintendence, seems to have  welcomed the intervention of Whibble with his green powder as an         agreeable diversion, and, unlocking this cupboard, proceeded at once  with his analytical experiments.  Whibble sat, luckily for himself, at  a safe distance, regarding him.  The four malefactors, feigning a   profound absorption in their work, watched him furtively with the keenest  interest.  For even within the limits of the Three Gases, Plattner's   practical chemistry was, I understand, temerarious.  

They are practically unanimous in their account of Plattner's   proceedings.  He poured a little of the green powder into a test-tube, and  tried the substance with water, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, and   sulphuric acid in succession.  Getting no result, he emptied out a little  heap—nearly half the bottleful, in fact—upon a slate and tried a  match.  He held the medicine bottle in his left hand.  The stuff began  to smoke and melt, and then—exploded with deafening violence and  a blinding flash.  

The five boys, seeing the flash and being prepared for catastrophes,  ducked below their desks, and were none of them seriously hurt.  The  window was blown out into the playground, and the blackboard on  its easel was upset.  The slate was smashed to atoms.  Some plaster fell  from the ceiling.  No other damage was done to the school edifice or  appliances, and the boys at first, seeing nothing' of Plattner, fancied  he was knocked down and lying out of their sight below the desks.   They jumped out of their places to go to his assistance, and were  amazed to find the space empty.  Being still confused by the sudden  violence of the report, they hurried to the open door, under the  impression that he must have been hurt, and have rushed out of the  room.  But Carson, the foremost, nearly collided in the doorway with  the principal, Mr. Lidgett.  

Mr. Lidgett is a corpulent, excitable man with one eye.  The boys  describe him as stumbling into the room mouthing some of those  tempered expletives irritable schoolmasters accustom themselves to use  —lest worse befall.  "Wretched mumchancer!" he said.  "Where's Mr.  Plattner?" The boys are agreed on the very words. ("Wobbler,"   "snivelling puppy," and "mumchancer" are, it seems, among the ordinary  small change of Mr. Lidgett's scholastic commerce.)  

Where's Mr. Plattner? That was a question that was to be repeated  many times in the next few days.  It really seemed as though that  frantic hyperbole, "blown to atoms," had for once realised itself.  There  was not a visible particle of Plattner to be seen; not a drop of blood  nor a stitch of clothing to be found.  Apparently he had been blown  clean out of existence and left not a wrack behind.  Not so much as  would cover a sixpenny piece, to quote a proverbial expression! The  evidence of his absolute disappearance, as a consequence of that   explosion, is indubitable.         

It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the commotion excited in  the Sussexville Proprietary School, and in Sussexville and elsewhere,  by this event.  It is quite possible, indeed, that some of the readers  of these pages may recall the hearing of some remote and dying   version of that excitement during the last summer holidays.  Lidgett, it  would seem, did everything in his power to suppress and minimise  the story.  He instituted a penalty of twenty-five lines for any mention  of Plattner's name among the boys, and stated in the schoolroom that  he was clearly aware of his assistant's whereabouts.  He was afraid,  he explains, that the possibility of an explosion happening, in spite of  the elaborate precautions taken to minimise the practical teaching  of chemistry, might injure the reputation of the school; and so might  any mysterious quality in Plattner's departure.  Indeed, he did   everything in his power to make the occurrence seem as ordinary as   possible.  In particular, he cross-examined the five eye-witnesses of the  occurrence so searchingly that they began to doubt the plain evidence  of their senses.  But, in spite of these efforts, the tale, in a magnified  and distorted state, made a nine days' wonder in the district, and  several parents withdrew their sons on colourable pretexts.  Not the  least remarkable point in the matter is the fact that a large number  of people in the neighbourhood dreamed singularly vivid dreams of  Plattner during the period of excitement before his return, and that  these dreams had a curious uniformity.  In almost all of them   Plattner was seen, sometimes singly, sometimes in company, wandering  about through a coruscating iridescence.  In all cases his face was  pale and distressed, and in some he gesticulated towards the dreamer.   One or two of the boys, evidently under the influence of nightmare,  fancied that Plattner approached them with remarkable swiftness, and  seemed to look closely into their very eyes.  Others fled with Plattner  from the pursuit of vague and extraordinary creatures of a globular  shape.  But all these fancies were forgotten in enquiries and   speculations when, on the Wednesday next but one after the Monday of  the explosion, Plattner returned.  

The circumstances of his return were as singular as those of his  departure.  So far as Mr. Lidgett's somewhat choleric outline can be  filled in from Plattner's hesitating statements, it would appear that  on Wednesday evening, towards the hour of sunset, the former  gentleman, having dismissed evening preparation, was engaged in his  garden, picking and eating strawberries, a fruit of which he is   inordinately fond.  It is a large old-fashioned garden, secured from   observation, fortunately, by a high and ivy-covered red-brick wall. just  as he was stooping over a particularly prolific plant, there was a  flash in the air and a heavy thud, and before he could look round,         some heavy body struck him violently from behind.  He was pitched  forward, crushing the strawberries he held in his hand, and that so  roughly, that his silk hat—Mr. Lidgett adheres to the older ideas of  scholastic costume—was driven violently down upon his forehead, and  almost over one eye.  This heavy missile, which slid over him sideways  and collapsed into a sitting posture among the strawberry plants,  proved to be our long-lost Mr. Gottfried Plattner, in an extremely  dishevelled condition.  He was collarless and hatless, his linen was  dirty, and there was blood upon his hands.  Mr. Lidgett was so   indignant and surprised that he remained on all-fours, and with his hat  jammed down on his eye, while he expostulated vehemently with  Plattner for his disrespectful and unaccountable conduct.  

This scarcely idyllic scene completes what I may call the exterior  version of the Plattner story—its exoteric aspect.  It is quite   unnecessary to enter here into all the details of his dismissal by Mr. Lidgett.   Such details, with the full names and dates and references, will be  found in the larger report of these occurrences that was laid before  the Society for the Investigation of Abnormal Phenomena.  The singular  transposition of Plattner's right and left sides was scarcely observed  for the first day or so, and then first in connection with his disposition  to write from right to left across the blackboard.  He concealed  rather than ostended this curious confirmatory circumstance, as he  considered it would unfavourably affect his prospects in a new  situation.  The displacement of his heart was discovered some months  after, when he was having a tooth extracted under anaesthetics.  He  then, very unwillingly, allowed a cursory surgical examination to be  made of himself, with a view to a brief account in the  Journal of  Anatomy.  That exhausts the statement of the material facts; and  we may now go on to consider Plattner's account of the matter.  

But first let us clearly differentiate between the preceding portion  of this story and what is to follow.  All I have told thus far is   established by such evidence as even a criminal lawyer would approve.   Every one of the witnesses is still alive; the reader, if he have the  leisure, may hunt the lads out to-morrow, or even brave the terrors  of the redoubtable Lidgett, and cross-examine and trap and test to  his heart's content; Gottfried Plattner, himself, and his twisted  heart and his three photographs are producible.  It may be taken as  proved that he did disappear for nine days as the consequence of an  explosion; that he returned almost as violently, under circumstances  in their nature annoying to Mr. Lidgett, whatever the details of  those circumstances may be; and that he returned inverted, just as  a reflection returns from a mirror.  From the last fact, as I have  already stated, it follows almost inevitably that Plattner, during those         nine days, must have been in some state of existence altogether out  of space.  The evidence to these statements is, indeed, far stronger  than that upon which most murderers are hanged.  But for his own  particular account of where he had been, with its confused explanations  and well-nigh self-contradictory details, we have only Mr. Gottfried  Plattner's word.  I do not wish to discredit that, but I must point  out—what so many writers upon obscure psychic phenomena fail to  do—that we are passing here from the practically undeniable to that  kind of matter which any reasonable man is entitled to believe or  reject as he thinks proper.  The previous statements render it plausible;  its discordance with common experience tilts it towards the incredible.  I would prefer not to sway the beam of the reader's  judgment either way, but simply to tell the story as Plattner told it me.  

He gave me his narrative, I may state, at my house at Chislehurst,  and so soon as he had left me that evening, I went into my study and  wrote down everything as I remembered it.  Subsequently he was good  enough to read over a type-written copy, so that its substantial   correctness is undeniable.  

He states that at the moment of the explosion he distinctly thought  he was killed.  He felt lifted off his feet and driven forcibly backward.   It is a curious fact for psychologists that he thought clearly during his  backward flight, and wondered whether he should hit the chemistry  cupboard or the blackboard easel.  His heels struck ground, and he  staggered and fell heavily into a sitting position on something soft  and firm.  For a moment the concussion stunned him.  He became aware  at once of a vivid scent of singed hair, and he seemed to hear the  voice of Lidgett asking for him.  You will understand that for a time  his mind was greatly confused.  

At first he was distinctly under the impression that he was still  in the classroom.  He perceived quite distinctly the surprise of the  boys and the entry of Mr. Lidgett.  He is quite positive upon that  score.  He did not hear their remarks; but that he ascribed to the  deafening effect of the experiment.  Things about him seemed curiously  dark and faint, but his mind explained that on the obvious but   mistaken idea that the explosion had engendered a huge volume of dark  smoke.  Through the dimness the figures of Lidgett and the boys  moved, as faint and silent as ghosts.  Plattner's face still tingled with  the stinging heat of the flash.  He was, he says, "all muddled." His  first definite thoughts seem to have been of his personal safety.  He  thought he was perhaps blinded and deafened.  He felt his limbs and  face in a gingerly manner.  Then his perceptions grew clearer, and  he was astonished to miss the old familiar desks and other schoolroom  furniture about him.  Only dim, uncertain, grey shapes stood in the         place of these.  Then came a thing that made him shout aloud, and  awoke his stunned faculties to instant activity.  Two of the boys,   gesticulating, walked one after the other clean through him! Neither  manifested the slightest consciousness of his presence.  It is difficult to  imagine the sensation he felt.  They came against him, he says, with  no more force than a wisp of mist.  

Plattner's first thought after that was that he was dead.  Having  been brought up with thoroughly sound views in these matters, however,  he was a little surprised to find his body still about him.  His  second conclusion was that he was not dead, but that the others were:  that the explosion had destroyed the Sussexville Proprietary School  and every soul in it except himself.  But that, too, was scarcely   satisfactory.  He was thrown back upon astonished observation.  

Everything about him was extraordinarily dark: at first it seemed  to have an altogether ebony blackness.  Overhead was a black firmament.  The only touch of light in the scene was a faint greenish glow  at the edge of the sky in one direction, which threw into prominence  a horizon of undulating black hills.  This, I say, was his impression at  first.  As his eye grew accustomed to the darkness, he began to   distinguish a faint quality of differentiating greenish colour in the  circumambient night.  Against this background the furniture and  occupants of the classroom, it seems, stood out like phosphorescent  spectres, faint and impalpable.  He extended his hand, and thrust it  without an effort through the wall of the room by the fireplace.  

He describes himself as making a strenuous effort to attract   attention.  He shouted to Lidgett, and tried to seize the boys as they went  to and fro.  He only desisted from these attempts when Mrs. Lidgett,  whom he (as an Assistant Master) naturally disliked, entered the room.   He says the sensation of being in the world, and yet not a part of it,  was an extraordinarily disagreeable one.  He compared his feelings,  not inaptly, to those of a cat watching a mouse through a window.   Whenever he made a motion to communicate with the dim, familiar  world about him, he found an invisible, incomprehensible barrier   preventing intercourse.  

He then turned his attention to his solid environment.  He found  the medicine bottle still unbroken in his hand, with the remainder  of the green powder therein.  He put this in his pocket, and began  to feel about him.  Apparently, he was sitting on a boulder of rock  covered with a velvety moss.  The dark country about him he was   unable to see, the faint, misty picture of the schoolroom blotting it out,  but he had a feeling (due perhaps to a cold wind) that he was  near the crest of a hill, and that a steep valley fell away beneath his         feet.  The green glow along the edge of the sky seemed to be growing  in extent and intensity.  He stood up, rubbing his eyes.  

It would seem that he made a few steps, going steeply downhill, and  then stumbled, nearly fell, and sat down again upon a jagged mass  of rock to watch the dawn.  He became aware that the world about him  was absolutely silent.  It was as still as it was dark, and though there  was a cold wind blowing up the hill-face, the rustle of grass, the  soughing of the boughs that should have accompanied it, were absent.   He could hear, therefore, if he could not see, that the hillside upon  which he stood was rocky and desolate.  The green grew brighter every  moment, and as it did so, a faint, transparent blood-red mingled with,  but did not mitigate, the blackness of the sky overhead and the  rocky desolations about him.  Having regard to what follows, I am  inclined to think that that redness may have been an optical effect due  to contrast.  Something black fluttered momentarily against the livid  yellow-green of the lower sky, and then the thin and penetrating voice  of a bell rose out of the black gulf below him.  An oppressive   expectation grew with the growing light.  

It is probable that an hour or more elapsed while he sat there, the  strange green light growing brighter every moment, and spreading  slowly, in flamboyant fingers, upward towards the zenith.  As it grew,  the spectral vision of our world became relatively or absolutely fainter.   Probably both, for the time must have been about that of our earthly  sunset.  So far as his vision of our world went, Plattner, by his few  steps downhill, had passed through the floor of the classroom, and  was now, it seemed, sitting in mid-air in the larger schoolroom   downstairs.  He saw the boarders distinctly, but much more faintly than  he had seen Lidgett.  They were preparing their evening tasks, and  he noticed with interest that several were cheating with their Euclid  riders by means of a crib, a compilation whose existence he had  hitherto never suspected.  As the time passed, they faded steadily,  as steadily as the light of the green dawn increased.  

Looking down into the valley, he saw that the light had crept far  down its rocky sides, and that the profound blackness of the abyss  was now broken by a minute green glow, like the light of a glowworm.   And almost immediately the limb of a huge heavenly body of blazing  green rose over the basaltic undulations of the distant hills, and the  monstrous hill-masses about him came out gaunt and desolate, in  green light and deep, ruddy black shadows.  He became aware of a  vast number of ball-shaped objects drifting as thistledown drifts over  the high ground.  There were none of these nearer to him than the  opposite side of the gorge.  The bell below twanged quicker and  quicker, with something like impatient insistence, and several lights         moved hither and thither.  The boys at work at their desks were now  almost imperceptibly faint.  

This extinction of our world, when the green sun of this other  universe rose, is a curious point upon which Plattner insists.  During  the Other-World night, it is difficult to move about, on account of the  vividness with which the things of this world are visible.  It becomes  a riddle to explain why, if this is the case, we in this world catch no  glimpse of the Other-World.' It is due, perhaps, to the comparatively  vivid illumination of this world of ours.  Plattner describes the midday  of the Other-World, at its brightest, as not being nearly so bright as  this world at full moon, while its night is profoundly black.   Consequently, the amount of light, even in an ordinary dark room, is   sufficient to render the things of the Other-World invisible, on the same  principle that faint phosphorescence is only visible in the profoundest  darkness.  I have tried, since he told me his story, to see something  of the Other-World by sitting for a long space in a photographer's  dark room at night.  I have certainly seen indistinctly the form of  greenish slopes and rocks, but only, I must admit, very indistinctly  indeed.  The reader may possibly be more successful.  Plattner tells  me that since his return he has dreamt and seen and recognised places  in the Other-World, but this is probably due to his memory of these  scenes.  It seems quite possible that people with unusually keen   eyesight may occasionally catch a glimpse of this strange Other-World  about us.  

However, this is a digression.  As the green sun rose, a long street  of black buildings became perceptible, though only darkly and   indistinctly, in the gorge, and, after some hesitation, Plattner began to  clamber down the precipitous descent towards them.  The descent was  long and exceedingly tedious, being so not only by the extraordinary  steepness, but also by reason of the looseness of the boulders with  which the whole face of the hill was strewn.  The noise of his   descent—now and then his heels struck fire from the rocks—seemed now  the only sound in the universe, for the beating of the bell had ceased.   As he drew nearer, he perceived that the various edifices had a  singular resemblance to tombs and mausoleums and monuments,  saving only that they were all uniformly black instead of being white,  as most sepulchres are.  And then he saw, crowding out of the largest  building, very much as people disperse from church, a number of  pallid, rounded, pale-green figures.  These dispersed in several   directions about the broad street of the place, some going through side  alleys and reappearing upon the steepness of the hill, others entering  some of the small black buildings which lined the way.  

At the sight of these things drifting up towards him, Plattner         stopped, staring.  They were not walking, they were indeed limbless,  and they had the appearance of human heads, beneath which a tadpole-like body swung.  He was too astonished at their strangeness, too full,  indeed, of strangeness, to be seriously alarmed by them.  They drove  towards him, in front of the chill wind that was blowing uphill,  much as soap-bubbles drive before a draught.  And as he looked at  the nearest of those approaching, he saw it was indeed a human head,  albeit with singularly large eyes, and wearing such an expression of  distress and anguish as he had never seen before upon mortal countenance.  He was surprised to find that it did not turn to regard him,  but seemed to be watching and following some unseen moving thing.   For a moment he was puzzled, and then it occurred to him that this  creature was watching with its enormous eyes something that was  happening in the world he had just left.  Nearer it came, and nearer,  and he was too astonished to cry out.  It made a very faint fretting  sound as it came close to him.  Then it struck his face with a gentle  pat,—its touch was very cold,—and drove past him, and upward   towards the crest of the hill.  

An extraordinary conviction flashed across Plattner's mind that this  head had a strong likeness to Lidgett.  Then he turned his attention  to the other heads that were now swarming thickly up the hillside.   None made the slightest sign of recognition.  One or two, indeed, came  close to his head and almost followed the example of the first, but he  dodged convulsively out of the way.  Upon most of them he saw the  same expression of unavailing regret he had seen upon the first,  and heard the same faint sounds of wretchedness from them.  One  or two wept, and one rolling swiftly uphill wore an expression of  diabolical rage.  But others were cold, and several had a look of  gratified interest in their eyes.  One, at least, was almost in an ecstasy  of happiness.  Plattner does not remember that he recognised any more  likenesses in those he saw at this time.  

For several hours, perhaps, Plattner watched these strange things  dispersing themselves over the hills, and not till long after they had  ceased to issue from the clustering black buildings in the gorge, did  he resume his downward climb.  The darkness about him increased  so much that he had a difficulty in stepping true.  Overhead the sky  was now a bright, pale green.  He felt neither hunger nor thirst.  Later,  when he did, he found a chilly stream running down the centre of  the gorge, and the rare moss upon the boulders, when he tried it at  last in desperation, was good to eat.  

He groped about among the tombs that ran down the gorge, seeking  vaguely for some clue to these inexplicable things.  After a long time  he came to the entrance of the big mausoleum-like building from         which the heads had issued.  In this he found a group of green lights  burning upon a kind of basaltic altar, and a bell-rope from a belfry  overhead hanging down into the centre of the place.  Round the wall  ran a lettering of fire in a character unknown to him.  While he was  still wondering at the purport of these things, he heard the receding  tramp of heavy feet echoing far down the street.  He ran out into  the darkness again, but he could see nothing.  He had a mind to pull  the bell-rope, and finally decided to follow the footsteps.  But, although  he ran far, he never overtook them; and his shouting was of no avail.   The gorge seemed to extend an interminable distance.  It was as dark  as earthly starlight throughout its length, while the ghastly green  day lay along the upper edge of its precipices.  There were none of  the heads, now, below.  They were all, it seemed, busily occupied along  the upper slopes.  Looking up, he saw them drifting hither and  thither, some hovering stationary, some flying swiftly through the air.   It reminded him, he said, of "big snowflakes;" only these were black  and pale green.  

In pursuing the firm, undeviating footsteps that he never overtook,  in groping into new regions of this endless devil's dyke, in clambering  up and down the pitiless heights, in wandering about the summits,  and in watching the drifting faces, Plattner states that he spent the  better part of seven or eight days.  He did not keep count, he says.   Though once or twice he found eyes watching him, he had word with  no living soul.  He slept among the rocks on the hillside.  In the gorge  things earthly were invisible, because, from the earthly standpoint,  it was far underground.  On the altitudes, so soon as the earthly day  began, the world became visible to him.  He found himself sometimes  stumbling over the dark-green rocks, or arresting himself on a   precipitous brink, while all about him the green branches of the   Sussexville lanes were swaying; or, again, he seemed to be walking  through the Sussexville streets, or watching unseen the private   business of some household.  And then it was he discovered, that to almost  every human being in our world there pertained some of these drifting  heads: that every one in the world is watched intermittently by these  helpless disembodiments.  

What are they—these Watchers of the Living? Plattner never learned.   But two, that presently found and followed him, were like his   childhood's memory of his father and mother.  Now and then other faces  turned their eyes upon him: eyes like those of dead people who had  swayed him, or injured him, or helped him in his youth and manhood.    Whenever they looked at him, Plattner was overcome with a  strange sense of responsibility.  To his mother he ventured to speak;         but she made no answer.  She looked sadly, steadfastly, and tenderly—  a little reproachfully, too, it seemed—into his eyes.  

He simply tells this story: he does not endeavour to explain.  We  are left to surmise who these Watchers of the Living may be, or  if they are indeed the Dead, why they should so closely and passionately   watch a world they have left for ever.  It may be—indeed to my  mind it seems just—that, when our life has closed, when evil or good  is no longer a choice for us, we may still have to witness the working  out of the train of consequences we have laid.  If human souls continue   after death, then surely human interests continue after death.   But that is merely my own guess at the meaning of the things seen.   Plattner offers no interpretation, for none was given him.  It is well  the reader should understand this clearly.  Day after day, with his  head reeling, he wandered about this strange-lit world outside the  world, weary and, towards the end, weak and hungry.  By day—by our  earthly day, that is—the ghostly vision of the old familiar scenery of  Sussexville, all about him, irked and worried him.  He could not see  where to put his feet, and ever and again with a chilly touch one  of these Watching Souls would come against his face.  And after dark  the multitude of these Watchers about him, and their intent distress,  confused his mind beyond describing.  A great longing to return to  the earthly life that was so near and yet so remote consumed him.   The unearthliness of things about him produced a positively painful  mental distress.  He was worried beyond describing by his own   particular followers.  He would shout at them to desist from staring at  him, scold at them, hurry away from them.  They were always mute  and intent.  Run as he might over the uneven ground, they followed  his destinies.  

On the ninth day, towards evening, Plattner heard the invisible  footsteps approaching, far away down the gorge.  He was then wandering   over the broad crest of the same hill upon which he had fallen  in his entry into this strange Other-World of his.  He turned to hurry  down into the gorge, feeling his way hastily, and was arrested by the  sight of the thing that was happening in a room in a back street  near the school.  Both of the people in the room he knew by sight.   The windows were open, the blinds up, and the setting sun shone  clearly into it, so that it came out quite brightly at first, a vivid   oblong of room, lying like a magic-lantern picture upon the black   landscape and the livid green dawn.  In addition to the sunlight, a candle  had just been lit in the room.  

On the bed lay a lank man, his ghastly white face terrible upon  the tumbled pillow.  His clenched hands were raised above his head.   A little table beside the bed carried a few medicine bottles, some         toast and water, and an empty glass.  Every now and then the lank  man's lips fell apart, to indicate a word he could not articulate.  But  the woman did not notice that he wanted anything, because she was  busy turning out papers from an old-fashioned bureau in the opposite  corner of the room.  At first the picture was very vivid indeed, but  as the green dawn behind it grew brighter and brighter, so it became  fainter and more and more transparent.  

As the echoing footsteps paced nearer and nearer, those footsteps  that sound so loud in that Other-World and come so silently in this,  Plattner perceived about him a great multitude of dim faces gathering  together out of the darkness and watching the two people in the  room.  Never before had he seen so many of the Watchers of the  Living.  A multitude had eyes only for the sufferer in the room, another  multitude, in infinite anguish, watched the woman as she hunted with  greedy eyes for something she could not find.  They crowded about  Plattner, they came across his sight and buffeted his face, the noise of  their unavailing regrets was all about him.  He saw clearly only now  and then.  At other times the picture quivered dimly, through the veil  of green reflections upon their movements.  In the room it must have  been very still, and Plattner says the candle flame streamed up into  a perfectly vertical line of smoke, but in his ears each footfall and its  echoes beat like a clap of thunder.  And the faces! Two, more   particularly near the woman's: one a woman's also, white and clear-featured, a face which might have once been cold and hard, but  which was now softened by the touch of a wisdom strange to earth.   The other might have been the woman's father.  Both were evidently  absorbed in the contemplation of some act of hateful meanness, so  it seemed, which they could no longer guard against and prevent.    Behind were others, teachers, it may be, who had taught ill, friends  whose influence had failed.  And over the man, too—a multitude, but  none that seemed to be parents or teachers! Faces that might once  have been coarse, now purged to strength by sorrow! And in the   fore-front one face, a girlish one, neither angry nor remorseful, but merely  patient and weary, and, as it seemed to Plattner, waiting for relief.   His powers of description fail him at the memory of this multitude  of ghastly countenances.  They gathered on the stroke of the bell.  He  saw them all in the space of a second.  It would seem that he was so  worked on by his excitement that, quite involuntarily, his restless  fingers took the bottle of green powder out of his pocket and held it  before him.  But he does not remember that.  

Abruptly the footsteps ceased.  He waited for the next, and there  was silence, and then suddenly, cutting through the unexpected   stillness like a keen, thin blade, came the first stroke of the bell.   At that         the multitudinous faces swayed to and fro and a louder crying began  all about him.  The woman did not hear; she was burning something  now in the candle flame.  At the second stroke everything grew dim,  and a breath of wind, icy cold, blew through the host of watchers.   They swirled about him like an eddy of dead leaves in the spring,  and at the third stroke something was extended through them to the  bed.  You have heard of a beam of light.  This was like a beam of  darkness, and looking again at it, Plattner saw that it was a shadowy  arm and hand.  

The green sun was now topping the black desolations of the horizon,  and the vision of the room was very faint.  Plattner could see that  the white of the bed struggled, and was convulsed; and that the woman  looked round over her shoulder at it, startled.  

The cloud of watchers lifted high like a puff of green dust before  the wind, and swept swiftly downward towards the temple in the  gorge.  Then suddenly Plattner understood the meaning of the   shadowy black arm that stretched across his shoulder and clutched its  prey.  He did not dare turn his head to see the Shadow behind the  arm.  With a violent effort, and covering his eyes, he set himself  to run, made, perhaps, twenty strides, then slipped on a boulder, and  fell.  He fell forward on his hands; and the bottle smashed and   exploded as he touched the ground.  

In another moment he found himself, stunned and bleeding, sitting  face to face with Lidgett in the old walled garden behind the school.    

There the story of Plattner's experiences ends.  I have resisted, I  believe successfully, the natural disposition of a writer of fiction to  dress up incidents of this sort.  I have told the thing as far as possible  in the order in which Plattner told it to me.  I have carefully avoided  any attempt at style, effect, or construction.  It would have been easy,  for instance, to have worked the scene of the death-bed into a kind  of plot in which Plattner might have been involved.  But, quite apart  from the objectionableness of falsifying a most extraordinary true  story, any such trite devices would spoil, to my mind, the peculiar  effect of this dark world, with its livid green illumination and its  drifting Watchers of the Living, which, unseen and unapproachable  to us, is yet lying all about us.  

It remains to add, that a death did actually occur in Vincent   Terrace, just beyond the school garden, and, so far as can be proved,  at the moment of Plattner's return.  Deceased was a rate-collector and  insurance agent.  His widow, who was much younger than himself,  married last month a Mr. Whymper, a veterinary surgeon of Allbeeding.   As the portion of this story given here has in various forms         circulated orally in Sussexville, she has consented to my use of her  name, on condition that I make it distinctly known that she emphatically   contradicts every detail of Plattner's account of her husband's  last moments.  She burnt no will, she says, although Plattner never  accused her of doing so; her husband made but one will, and that just  after their marriage.  Certainly, from a man who had never seen it,  Plattner's account of the furniture of the room was curiously accurate.  

One other thing, even at the risk of an irksome repetition, I must  insist upon, lest I seem to favour the credulous, superstitious view.   Plattner's absence from the world for nine days is, I think, proved.   But that does not prove his story.  It is quite conceivable that even  outside space hallucinations may be possible.  That, at least, the  reader must bear distinctly in mind.  

             
# THE STRANGE ORCHID

    The buying of orchids always has in it a certain speculative flavour.   You have before you the brown shrivelled lump of tissue, and for the  rest you must trust your judgment, or the auctioneer, or your good-luck, as your taste may incline.  The plant may be moribund or dead,  or it may be just a respectable purchase, fair value for your money,  or perhaps—for the thing has happened again and again—there slowly  unfolds before the delighted eyes of the happy purchaser, day after  day, some new variety, some novel richness, a strange twist of the  labellum, or some subtler colouration or unexpected mimicry.  Pride,  beauty, and profit blossom together on one delicate green spike, and  it may be, even immortality.  For the new miracle of Nature may  stand in need of a new specific name, and what so convenient as that  of its discoverer? "Johnsmithia"! There have been worse names.  

It was perhaps the hope of some such happy discovery that made  Winter-Wedderburn such a frequent attendant at these sales—that  hope, and also, maybe, the fact that he had nothing else of the slightest  interest to do in the world.  He was a shy, lonely, rather ineffectual  man, provided with just enough income to keep off the spur of necessity,   and not enough nervous energy to make him seek any exacting  employments.  He might have collected stamps or coins, or translated  Horace, or bound books, or invented new species of diatoms.  But,  as it happened, he grew orchids, and had one ambitious little   hot-house.  

"I have a fancy," he said over his coffee, "that something is going  to happen to me to-day." He spoke—as he moved and thought—  slowly.         

"Oh, don't say that!" said his housekeeper—who was also his remote  cousin.  For "something happening" was a euphemism that meant only  one thing to her.  

"You misunderstand me.  I mean nothing unpleasant—though what  I do mean I scarcely know.  

"To-day," he continued after a pause, "Peters are going to sell a  batch of plants from the Andamans and the Indies.  I shall go up  and see what they have.  It may be I shall buy something good,   unawares.  That may be it."  

He passed his cup for his second cupful of coffee.  

"Are these the things collected by that poor young fellow you told  me of the other day?" asked his cousin as she filled his cup.  

"Yes," he said, and became meditative over a piece of toast.  

"Nothing ever does happen to me," he remarked presently,   beginning to think aloud.  "I wonder why? Things enough happen to  other people.  There is Harvey.  Only the other week, on Monday he  picked up sixpence, on Wednesday his chicks all had the staggers, on  Friday his cousin came home from Australia, and on Saturday he  broke his ankle.  What a whirl of excitement!—compared to me."  

"I think I would rather be without so much excitement," said his  housekeeper.  "It can't be good for you."  

"I suppose it's troublesome.  Still—you see, nothing ever happens  to me.  When I was a little boy I never had accidents.  I never fell in  love as I grew up.  Never married—I wonder how it feels to have   something happen to you, something really remarkable.  

"That orchid-collector was only thirty-six—twenty years younger  than myself—when he died.  And he had been married twice and divorced   once; he had had malarial fever four times, and once he broke  his thigh.  He killed a Malay once, and once he was wounded by a  poisoned dart.  And in the end he was killed by jungle-leeches.  It  must have all been very troublesome, but then it must have been  very interesting, you know—except, perhaps, the leeches."  

"I am sure it was not good for him," said the lady, with conviction.  

"Perhaps not." And then Wedderburn looked at his watch.   "Twentythree minutes past eight.  I am going up by the quarter to twelve train,  so that there is plenty of time.  I think I shall wear my alpaca jacket  —it is quite warm enough—and my grey felt hat and brown shoes.  I  suppose—"  

He glanced out of the window at the serene sky and sunlit garden,  and then nervously at his cousin's face.  

"I think you had better take an umbrella if you are going to   London," she said in a voice that admitted of no denial.  "There's all  between here and the station coming back."         

When he returned he was in a state of mild excitement.  He had  made a purchase.  It was rare that he could make up his mind  quickly enough to buy, but this time he had done so.  

"There are Vandas," he said, "and a Dendrobe and some Palaeonophis."   He surveyed his purchases lovingly as he consumed his soup.   They were laid out on the spotless tablecloth before him, and he was  telling his cousin all about them as he slowly meandered through  his dinner.  It was his custom to live all his visits to London over  again in the evening for her and his own entertainment.  

"I knew something would happen to-day.  And I have bought all  these.  Some of them—some of them—I feel sure, do you know, that  some of them will be remarkable.  I don't know how it is, but I feel  just as sure as if some one had told me that some of these will turn  out remarkable.  

"That one"—he pointed to a shrivelled rhizome—"was not identified.   It may be a Palaeonophis—or it may not.  It may be a new species, or  even a new genus.  And it was the last that poor Batten ever collected."  

"I don't like the look of it," said his housekeeper.  "It's such an ugly  shape."  

"To me it scarcely seems to have a shape."  

"I don't like those things that stick out," said his housekeeper.  

"It shall be put away in a pot to-morrow."  

"It looks," said the housekeeper, "like a spider shamming dead."  

Wedderburn smiled and surveyed the root with his head on one  side.  "It is certainly not a pretty lump of stuff.  But you can never  judge of these things from their dry appearance.  It may turn out  to be a very beautiful orchid indeed.  How busy I shall be to-morrow!  I must see tonight just exactly what to do with these things, and  to-morrow I shall set to work.  

"They found poor Batten lying dead, or dying, in a mangrove  swamp—I forget which," he began again presently, "with one of these  very orchids crushed up under his body.  He had been unwell for  some days with some kind of native fever, and I suppose he fainted.   These mangrove swamps are very unwholesome.  Every drop of blood,  they say, was taken out of him by the jungle-leeches.  It may be that  very plant that cost him his life to obtain."  

"I think none the better of it for that."  

"Men must work though women may weep," said Wedderburn,  with profound gravity.  

"Fancy dying away from every comfort in a nasty swamp! Fancy  being ill of fever with nothing to take but chlorodyne and quinine  —if men were left to themselves they would live on chlorodyne and  quinine—and no one round you but horrible natives! They say the         Andaman islanders are most disgusting wretches—and, anyhow, they  can scarcely make good nurses, not having the necessary training.  And  just for people in England to have orchids!"  

"I don't suppose it was comfortable, but some men seem to enjoy  that kind of thing," said Wedderburn.  "Anyhow, the natives of his  party were sufficiently civilised to take care of all his collection until  his colleague, who was an ornithologist, came back again from the   interior; though they could not tell the species of the orchid, and had  let it wither.  And it makes these things more interesting."  

"It makes them disgusting.  I should be afraid of some of the malaria  clinging to them.  And just think, there has been a dead body lying  across that ugly thing! I never thought of that before.  There! I   declare I cannot eat another mouthful of dinner."  

"I will take them off the table if you like, and put them in the  window-seat.  I can see them just as well there."  

The next few days he was indeed singularly busy in his steamy  little hothouse, fussing about with charcoal, lumps of teak, moss, and  all the other mysteries of the orchid cultivator.  He considered he was  having a wonderfully eventful time.  In the evening he would talk  about these new orchids to his friends, and over and over again he  reverted to his expectation of something strange.  

Several of the Vandas and the Dendrobium died under his care,  but presently the strange orchid began to show signs of life.  He was  delighted, and took his housekeeper right away from jam-making to  see it at once, directly he made the discovery.  

"That is a bud," he said, "and presently there will be a lot of leaves  there, and those little things coming out here are aerial rootlets."  

"They look to me like little white fingers poking out of the brown.   I don't like them," said his housekeeper.  

"Why not?"  

"I don't know.  They look like fingers trying to get at you.  I can't  help my likes and dislikes."  

"I don't know for certain, but I don't think there are any orchids  I know that have aerial rootlets quite like that.  It may be my fancy,  of course.  You see they are a little flattened at the ends."  

"I don't like 'em," said his housekeeper, suddenly shivering and  turning away.  "I know it's very silly of me—and I'm very sorry,   particularly as you like the thing so much.  But I can't help thinking of  that corpse."  

"But it may not be that particular plant.  That was merely a guess  of mine."  

His housekeeper shrugged her shoulders.  

"Anyhow I don't like it," she said.         

Wedderburn felt a little hurt at her dislike to the plant.  But that  did not prevent his talking to her about orchids generally, and this  orchid in particular, whenever he felt inclined.  

"There are such queer things about orchids," he said one day;  "such possibilities of surprises.  You know, Darwin studied their   fertilisation, and showed that the whole structure of an ordinary orchid-flower was contrived in order that moths might carry the pollen from  plant to plant.  Well, it seems that there are lots of orchids known  the flower of which cannot possibly be used for fertilisation in that  way.  Some of the Cypripediums, for instance; there are no insects  known that can possibly fertilise them, and some of them have never  been found with seed."  

"But how do they form new plants?"  

"By runners and tubers, and that kind of outgrowth.  That is easily  explained.  The puzzle is, what are the flowers for?  

"Very likely," he added, "my orchid may be something extraordinary   in that way.  If so, I shall study it.  I have often thought of making  researches as Darwin did.  But hitherto I have not found the time,  or something else has happened to prevent it.  The leaves are   beginning to unfold now.  I do wish you would come and see them!"  

But she said that the orchid-house was so hot it gave her the   headache.  She had seen the plant once again, and the aerial rootlets,  which were now some of them more than a foot long, had unfortunately   reminded her of tentacles reaching out after something; and  they got into her dreams, growing after her with incredible rapidity.   So that she had settled to her entire satisfaction that she would not  see that plant again, and Wedderburn had to admire its leaves alone.   They were of the ordinary broad form, and a deep glossy green, with  splashes and dots of deep red towards the base.  He knew of no other  leaves quite like them.  The plant was placed on a low bench near  the thermometer, and close by was a simple arrangement by which a  tap dripped on the hot-water pipes and kept the air steamy.  And he  spent his afternoons now with some regularity meditating on the  approaching flowering of this strange plant.  

And at last the great thing happened.  Directly he entered the little  glass house he knew that the spike had burst out, although his great  Palaeonophis Lowii hid the corner where his new darling stood.  There  was a new odour in the air, a rich, intensely sweet scent, that over-powered every other in that crowded, steaming little greenhouse.  

Directly he noticed this he hurried down to the strange orchid.   And, behold! the trailing green spikes bore now three great splashes  of blossom, from which this overpowering sweetness proceeded.  He  stopped before them in an ecstasy of admiration.         

The flowers were white, with streaks of golden orange upon the  petals; the heavy labellum was coiled into an intricate projection,  and a wonderful bluish purple mingled there with the gold.  He could  see at once that the genus was altogether a new one.  And the   insufferable scent! How hot the place was! The blossoms swam before his  eyes.  

He would see if the temperature was right.  He made a step towards  the thermometer.  Suddenly everything appeared unsteady.  The bricks  on the floor were dancing up and down.  Then the white blossoms,  the green leaves behind them, the whole greenhouse, seemed to  sweep sideways, and then in a curve upward.    

At half-past four his cousin made the tea, according to their   invariable custom.  But Wedderburn did not come in for his tea.  

"He is worshipping that horrid orchid," she told herself, and  waited ten minutes.  "His watch must have stopped.  I will go and  call him."  

She went straight to the hothouse, and, opening the door, called  his name.  There was no reply.  She noticed that the air was very  close, and loaded with an intense perfume.  Then she saw something  lying on the bricks between the hot-water pipes.  

For a minute, perhaps, she stood motionless.  

He was lying, face upward, at the foot of the strange orchid.  The  tentacle-like aerial rootlets no longer swayed freely in the air, but were  crowded together, a tangle of grey ropes, and stretched tight with  their ends closely applied to his chin and neck and hands.  

She did not understand.  Then she saw from under one of the   exultant tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.  

With an inarticulate cry she ran towards him, and tried to pull  him away from the leech-like suckers.  She snapped two of these  tentacles, and their sap dripped red.  

Then the overpowering scent of the blossom began to make her  head reel.  How they clung to him! She tore at the tough ropes, and  he and the white inflorescence swam about her.  She felt she was   fainting, knew she must not.  She left him and hastily opened the nearest  door, and, after she had panted for a moment in the fresh air, she had  a brilliant inspiration.  She caught up a flower-pot and smashed in the  windows at the end of the greenhouse.  Then she re-entered.  She  tugged now with renewed strength at Wedderburn's motionless body,  and brought the strange orchid crashing to the floor.  It still clung  with the grimmest tenacity to its victim.  In a frenzy, she lugged it  and him into the open air.  

Then she thought of tearing through the sucker rootlets one by         one,  and in another minute she had released him and was dragging  him away from the horror.  

He was white and bleeding from a dozen circular patches.  

The odd-job man was coming up the garden, amazed at the   smashing of glass, and saw her emerge, hauling the inanimate body with  red-stained hands.  For a moment he thought impossible things.  

"Bring some water!" she cried, and her voice dispelled his fancies.   When, with unnatural alacrity, he returned with the water, he found  her weeping with excitement, and with Wedderburn's head upon her  knee, wiping the blood from his face.  

"What's the matter?" said Wedderburn, opening his eyes feebly,  and closing them again at once.  

"Go and tell Annie to come out here to me, and then go for Dr.  Haddon at once," she said to the odd-job man so soon as he brought  the water; and added, seeing he hesitated, "I will tell you all about  it when you come back."  

Presently Wedderburn opened his eyes again, and, seeing that he  was troubled by the puzzle of his position, she explained to him, "You  fainted in the hothouse."  

"And the orchid?"  

"I will see to that," she said.  

Wedderburn had lost a good deal of blood, but beyond that he  had suffered no very great injury.  They gave him brandy mixed with  some pink extract of meat, and carried him upstairs to bed.  His   housekeeper told her incredible  story in fragments to Dr. Haddon.  "Come to the orchid-house and see," she said.  

The cold outer air was blowing in through the open door, and  the sickly perfume was almost dispelled.  Most of the torn aerial  rootlets lay already withered amidst a number of dark stains upon  the bricks.  The stem of the inflorescence was broken by the fall of  the plant, and the flowers were growing limp and brown at the edges  of the petals.  The doctor stooped towards it, then saw that one of the  aerial rootlets still stirred feebly, and hesitated.  

The next morning the strange orchid still lay there, black now and  putrescent.  The door banged intermittingly in the morning breeze,  and all the array of Wedderburn's orchids was shrivelled and   prostrate.  But Wedderburn himself was bright and garrulous   upstairs in the glory of his strange adventure.  

               
# THE NEW ACCELERATOR

    Certainly, if ever a man found a guinea when he was looking for a  pin it is my good friend Professor Gibberne.  I have heard before of  investigators overshooting the mark, but never quite to the extent  that he has done.  He has really, this time at any rate, without any  touch of exaggeration in the phrase, found something to revolutionise  human life.  And that when he was simply seeking an all-round  nervous stimulant to bring languid people up to the stresses of these  pushful days.  I have tasted the stuff now several times, and I cannot  do better than describe the effect the thing had on me.  That there  are astonishing experiences in store for all in search of new   sensations will become apparent enough.  

Professor Gibberne, as many people know, is my neighbour in  Folkestone.  Unless my memory plays me a trick, his portrait at various  ages has already appeared in The Strand Magazine—I think late in  1899; but I am unable to look it up because I have lent that volume  to some one who has never sent it back.  The reader may, perhaps,  recall the high forehead and the singularly long black eyebrows  that give such a Mephistophelian touch to his face.  He occupies one  of those pleasant little detached houses in the mixed style that make  the western end of the Upper Sandgate Road so interesting.  His is  the one with the Flemish gables and the Moorish portico, and it is  in the little room with the mullioned bay window that he works when  he is down here, and in which of an evening we have so often smoked  and talked together.  He is a mighty jester, but, besides, he likes to  talk to me about his work; he is one of those men who find a help  and stimulus in talking, and so I have been able to follow the   conception       of the New Accelerator right up from a very early stage.   Of course, the greater portion of his experimental work is not done  in Folkestone, but in Gower Street, in the fine new laboratory next  to the hospital that he has been the first to use.  

As every one knows, or at least as all intelligent people know, the  special department in which Gibberne has gained so great and deserved   a reputation among physiologists is the action of drugs upon  the nervous system.  Upon soporifics, sedatives, and anaesthetics he is,  I am told, unequalled.  He is also a chemist of considerable eminence,  and I suppose in the subtle and complex jungle of riddles that  centres about the ganglion cell and the axis fibre there are little  cleared places of his making, little glades of illumination, that, until  he sees fit to publish his results, are still inaccessible to every other  living man.  And in the last few years he has been particularly   assiduous upon this question of nervous stimulants, and already, before  the discovery of the New Accelerator, very successful with them.   Medical science has to thank him for at least three distinct and absolutely   safe invigorators of unrivalled value to practising men.  In  cases of exhaustion the preparation known as Gibberne's B Syrup  has, I suppose, saved more lives already than any lifeboat round the  coast.  

"But none of these little things begin to satisfy me yet," he told  me nearly a year ago.  "Either they increase the central energy   without affecting the nerves or they simply increase the available energy  by lowering the nervous conductivity; and all of them are unequal  and local in their operation.  One wakes up the heart and viscera  and leaves the brain stupefied, one gets at the brain champagne   fashion and does nothing good for the solar plexus, and what I want—  and what, if it's an earthly possibility, I mean to have—is a stimulant  that stimulates all round, that wakes you up for a time from the  crown of your head to the tip of your great toe, and makes you  go two—or even three to everybody else's one.  Eh? That's the thing  I'm after."  

"It would tire a man," I said.  

"Not a doubt of it.  And you'd eat double or treble—and all that.   But just think what the thing would mean.  Imagine yourself with  a little phial like this"—he held up a little bottle of green glass and  marked his points with it—"and in this precious phial is the power  to think twice as fast, move twice as quickly, do twice as much work  in a given time as you could otherwise do."  

"But is such a thing possible?"  

"I believe so.  If it isn't, I've wasted my time for a year.  These  various preparations of the hypophosphites, for example, seem to         show that something of the sort . . . Even if it was only one and  a half times as fast it would do."  

"It would do," I said.  

"If you were a statesman in a corner, for example, time rushing  up against you, something urgent to be done, eh?"  

"He could dose his private secretary," I said.  

"And gain-double time.  And think if you, for example, wanted to  finish a book."  

"Usually," I said, "I wish I'd never begun 'em."  

"Or a doctor, driven to death, wants to sit down and think out a  case.  Or a barrister—or a man cramming for an examination."  

"Worth a guinea a drop," said I, "and more—to men like that."  

"And in a duel, again," said Gibberne, "where it all depends on  your quickness in pulling the trigger."  

"Or in fencing," I echoed.  

"You see," said Gibberne, "if I get it as an all-round thing it will  really do you no harm at all—except perhaps to an infinitesimal degree   it brings you nearer old age.  You will just have lived twice to  other people's once—"  

"I suppose," I meditated, "in a duel—it would be fair?"  

"That's a question for the seconds," said Gibberne.  

I harked back further.  "And you really think such a thing is   possible?" I said.  

"As possible," said Gibberne, and glanced at something that went  throbbing by the window, "as a motor-bus.  As a matter of fact—"  

He paused and smiled at me deeply, and tapped slowly on the  edge of his desk with the green phial.  "I think I know the stuff. . . .  Already I've got something coming." The nervous smile upon his  face betrayed the gravity of his revelation.  He rarely talked of his  actual experimental work unless things were very near the end.  "And  it may be, it may be—I shouldn't be surprised—it may even do the  thing at a greater rate than twice."  

"It will be rather a big thing," I hazarded.  

"It will be, I think, rather a big thing."  

But I don't think he quite knew what a big thing it was to be, for  all that.  

I remember we had several talks about the stuff after that.  "The  New Accelerator" he called it, and his tone about it grew more  confident on each occasion.  Sometimes he talked nervously of unexpected   physiological results its use might have, and then he would  get a little unhappy; at others he was frankly mercenary, and we   debated long and anxiously how the preparation might be turned to  commercial account.  "It's a good thing," said Gibberne, "a tremendous         thing.  I know I'm giving the world something, and I think it only  reasonable we should expect the world to pay.  The dignity of science  is all very well, but I think somehow I must have the monopoly of  the stuff for, say, ten years. I don't see why all the fun in life should  go to the dealers in ham."  

My own interest in the coming drug certainly did not wane in the  time.  I have always had a queer little twist towards metaphysics in  my mind.  I have always been given to paradoxes about space and  time, and it seemed to me that Gibberne was really preparing no  less than the absolute acceleration of life.  Suppose a man repeatedly  dosed with such a preparation: he would live an active and record  life indeed, but he would be an adult at eleven, middle-aged at  twenty-five, and by thirty well on the road to senile decay.  It seemed  to me that so far Gibberne was only going to do for any one who  took his drug exactly what Nature has done for the Jews and Orientals,   who are men in their teens and aged by fifty, and quicker in  thought and act than we are all the time.  The marvel of drugs has  always been great to my mind; you can madden a man, calm a man,  make him incredibly strong and alert or a helpless log, quicken this  passion and allay that, all by means of drugs, and here was a new  miracle to be added to this strange armoury of phials the doctors  use! But Gibberne was far too eager upon his technical points to  enter very keenly into my aspect of the question.  

It was the 7th or 8th of August when he told me the distillation  that decide his failure or success for a time was going forward as we  talked, and it was on the 10th that he told me the thing was done  and the New Accelerator a tangible reality in the world.  I met him  as I was going up the Sandgate Hill towards Folkestone—I think  I was going to get my hair cut, and he came hurrying down to meet  me—I suppose he was coming to my house to tell me at once of his  success.  I remember that his eyes were unusually bright and his face  flushed, and I noted even the swift alacrity of his step.  

"It's done," he cried, and gripped my hand, speaking very fast;  "it's more than done.  Come up to my house and see."  

"Really?"  

"Really!" he shouted.  "Incredibly! Come up and see."  

"And it does—twice?"  

"It does more, much more.  It scares me.  Come up and see the  stuff.  Taste it! Try it! It's the most amazing stuff on earth." He  gripped my arm and, walking at such a pace that he forced me into  a trot, went shouting with me up the hill.  A whole char-a-banc-ful of  people turned and stared at us in unison after the manner of people  in chars-a-banc.  It was one of those hot, clear days that Folkestone         sees so much of, every colour incredibly bright. and every outline hard.   There was a breeze, of course, but not so much breeze as sufficed  under these conditions to keep me cool and dry.  I panted for mercy.  

"I'm not walking fast, am I?" cried Gibberne, and slackened his  pace to a quick march.  

"You've been taking some of this stuff," I puffed.  

"No," he said.  "At the utmost a drop of water that stood in a beaker  from which I had washed out the last traces of the stuff.  I took some  last night, you know.  But that is ancient history, now."  

"And it goes twice?" I said, nearing his doorway in a grateful   perspiration.  

"It goes a thousand times, many thousand times!" cried Gibberne,  with a dramatic gesture, flinging open his Early English carved oak  gate.  

"Phew!" said I, and followed him to the door.  

"I don't know how many times it goes," he said, with his latch-key  in his hand.  

"And you—"  

"It throws all sorts of light on nervous physiology, it kicks the  theory of vision into a perfectly new shape! . . . Heaven knows how  many thousand times.  We'll try all that after— The thing is to try  the stuff now."  

"Try the stuff?" I said, as we went along the passage.  

"Rather," said Gibberne, turning on me in his study.  "There it  is in that little green phial there! Unless you happen to be afraid?"  

I am a careful man by nature, and only theoretically adventurous.  I was afraid.  But on the other hand there is pride.  

"Well," I haggled.  "You say you've tried it?"  

"I've tried it," he said, "and I don't look hurt by it, do I? I don't  even look livery and I feel—"  

I sat down.  "Give me the potion," I said.  "If the worst comes to  the worst it will save having my hair cut, and that I think is one  of the most hateful duties of a civilised man.  How do you take the  mixture?"  

"With water," said Gibberne, whacking down a carafe.  

He stood up in front of his desk and regarded me in his easy  chair; his manner was suddenly affected by a touch of the Harley  Street specialist.  "It's rum stuff, you know," he said.  

I made a gesture with my hand.  

"I must warn you in the first place as soon as you've got it down  to shut your eyes, and open them very cautiously in a minute or so's  time.  One still sees.  The sense of vision is a question of length of  vibration, and not of multitude of impacts; but there's a kind of         shock to the retina, a nasty giddy confusion just at the time, if the  eyes are open.  Keep 'em shut."  

"Shut," I said.  "Good!"  

"And the next thing is, keep still.  Don't begin to whack about.  You  may fetch something a nasty rap if you do.  Remember you will be  going several thousand times faster than you ever did before, heart,  lungs, muscles, brain—everything—and you will hit hard without  knowing it.  You won't know it, you know.  You'll feel just as you do  now.  Only everything in the world will seem to be going ever so  many thousand times slower that it ever went before.  That's what  makes it so deuced queer."  

"Lor'," I said.  "And you mean—"  

"You'll see," said he, and took up a little measure.  He glanced  at the material on his desk.  "Glasses," he said, "water.  All here.   Mustn't take too much for the first attempt."  

The little phial glucked out its precious contents.  "Don't forget  what I told you," he said, turning the contents of the measure into  a glass in the manner of an Italian waiter measuring whisky.  "Sit  with the eyes tightly shut and in absolute stillness for two minutes,"  he said.  "Then you will hear me speak."  

He added an inch or so of water to the little dose in each glass.   

"By-the-by," he said, "don't put your glass down.  Keep it in your  hand and rest your hand on your knee.  Yes—so.  And now—"  

He raised his glass.  

"The New Accelerator," I said.  

"The New Accelerator," he answered, and we touched glasses and  drank, and instantly I closed my eyes.  

You know that blank non-existence into which one drops when  one has taken "gas." For an indefinite interval it was like that.  Then  I heard Gibberne telling me to wake up, and I stirred and opened  my eyes.  There he stood as he had been standing, glass still in hand.   It was empty, that was all the difference.  

"Well?" said I.  

"Nothing out of the way?"  

"Nothing.  A slight feeling of exhilaration, perhaps.  Nothing more."  

"Sounds?"  

"Things are still," I said.  "By Jove! yes! They are still.  Except  the sort of faint pat, patter, like rain falling on different things.   What is it?"  

"Analysed sounds, I think he said, but I am not sure.  He glanced  at the window.  "Have you ever seen a curtain before a window fixed  in that way before?"  

I followed his eyes, and there was the end of the curtain, frozen,         as it were, corner high, in the act of flapping briskly in the breeze.  

"No," said I; "that's odd."  

"And here," he said, and opened the hand that held the glass.   Naturally I winced, expecting the glass to smash.  But so far from  smashing it did not even seem to stir; it hung in mid-air—motionless.   "Roughly speaking," said Gibberne, "an object in these latitudes  falls 16 feet in the first second.  This glass is falling 16 feet in a  second now.  Only, you see, it hasn't been falling yet for the hundredth  part of a second.  That gives you some idea of the pace of my Accelerator."   And he waved his hand round and round, over and under  the slowly sinking glass.  Finally he took it by the bottom, pulled it  down, and placed it very carefully on the table.  "Eh?" he said to me,  and laughed.  

"That seems all right," I said, and began very gingerly to raise   myself from my chair.  I felt perfectly well, very light and comfortable,  and quite confident in my mind.  I was going fast all over.  My heart,  for example, was beating a thousand times a second, but that caused  me no discomfort at all.  I looked out of the window.  An immovable  cyclist, head down and with a frozen puff of dust behind his driving-wheel, scorched to overtake a galloping char-a-banc that did not stir.   I gaped in amazement at this incredible spectacle.  "Gibberne," I  cried, "how long will this confounded stuff last?"  

"Heaven knows!" he answered.  "Last time I took it I went to bed  and slept it off.  I tell you, I was frightened.  It must have lasted some  minutes, I think—it seemed like hours.  But after a bit it slows down  rather suddenly, I believe."  

I was proud to observe that I did not feel frightened—I suppose  because there were two of us.  "Why shouldn't we go out?" I asked.  

"Why not?"  

"They'll see us."  

"Not they.  Goodness, no! Why, we shall be going a thousand times  faster than the quickest conjuring trick that was ever done.  Come  along! Which way shall we go? Window, or door?"  

And out by the window we went.  

Assuredly of all the strange experiences that I have ever had, or  imagined, or read of other people having or imagining, that little raid  I made with Gibberne on the Folkestone Leas, under the influence  of the New Accelerator, was the strangest and maddest of all.  We  went out by his gate into the road, and there we made a minute  examination of the statuesque passing traffic.  The tops of the wheels  and some of the legs of the horses of this char-a-banc, the end of  the whip-lash and the lower jaw of the conductor—who was just   beginning to yawn—were perceptibly in motion, but all the rest of the         lumbering conveyance seemed still.  And quite noiseless except for  a faint rattling that came from one man's throat! And as parts of  this frozen edifice there were a driver, you know, and a conductor, and  eleven people! The effect as we walked about the thing began by  being madly queer, and ended by being—disagreeable.  There they  were, people like ourselves and yet not like ourselves, frozen in careless  attitudes, caught in mid-gesture.  A girl and a man smiled at one  another, a leering smile that threatened to last for evermore; a woman  in a floppy capelline rested her arm on the rail and stared at   Gibberne's house with the unwinking stare of eternity; a man stroked  his moustache like a figure of wax, and another stretched a tiresome  stiff hand with extended fingers towards his loosened hat.  We stared  at them, we laughed at them, we made faces at them, and then a sort  of disgust of them came upon us, and we turned away and walked  round in front of the cyclist towards the Leas.  

"Goodness!" cried Gibberne, suddenly; "look there!"  

He pointed, and there at the tip of his finger and sliding down  the air with wings flapping slowly and at the speed of an   exceptionally languid snail—was a bee.  

And so we came out upon the Leas.  There the thing seemed  madder than ever.  The band was playing in the upper stand, though  all the sound it made for us was a low-pitched, wheezy rattle, a sort  of prolonged last sigh that passed at times into a sound like the slow,  muffled ticking of some monstrous clock.  Frozen people stood erect,  strange, silent, self-conscious-looking dummies hung unstably in   midstride, promenading upon the grass.  I passed close to a little poodle  dog suspended in the act of leaping, and watched the slow movement  of his legs as he sank to the earth.  "Lord, look here!" cried Gibberne,  and we halted for a moment before a magnificent person in white  faint-striped flannels, white shoes, and a Panama hat, who turned back  to wink at two gaily dressed ladies he had passed.  A wink, studied  with such leisurely deliberation as we could afford, is an unattractive  thing.  It loses any quality of alert gaiety, and one remarks that the  winking eye does not completely close, that under its drooping lid  appears the lower edge of an eyeball and a little line of white.   "Heaven give me memory," said I, "and I will never wink again."  

"Or smile," said Gibberne, with his eye on the lady's answering  teeth.  

"It's infernally hot, somehow," said I. "Let's go slower."  

"Oh, come along!" said Gibberne.  

We picked our way among the bath-chairs in the path.  Many of  the people sitting in the chairs seemed almost natural in their passive  poses, but the contorted scarlet of the bandsmen was not a restful         thing to see.  A purple-faced little gentleman was frozen in the midst of  a violent struggle to refold his newspaper against the wind; there  were many evidences that all these people in their sluggish way  were exposed to a considerable breeze, a breeze that had no existence  so far as our sensations went.  We came out and walked a little way  from the crowd, and turned and regarded it.  To see all that   multitude changed to a picture, smitten rigid, as it were, into the  semblance of realistic wax, was impossibly wonderful.  It was absurd,  of course; but it filled me with an irrational, an exultant sense of  superior advantage.  Consider the wonder of it! All that I had said,  and thought, and done since the stuff had begun to work in my  veins had happened, so far as those people, so far as the world in  general went, in the twinkling of an eye.  "The New Accelerator—"  I began, but Gibberne interrupted me.  

"There's that infernal old woman!" he said.   

"What old woman?"  

"Lives next door to me," said Gibberne.  "Has a lapdog that yaps.   Gods! The temptation is strong!"  

There is something very boyish and impulsive about Gibberne at  times.  Before I could expostulate with him he had dashed forward,  snatched the unfortunate animal out of visible existence, and was  running violently with it towards the cliff of the Leas.  It was most  extraordinary.  The little brute, you know, didn't bark or wriggle or  make the slightest sign of vitality.  It kept quite stiffly in an attitude  of somnolent repose, and Gibberne held it by the neck.  It was like  running about with a dog of wood.  "Gibberne," I cried, "put it  down!" Then I said something else.  "If you run like that, Gibberne,"  I cried, "you'll set your clothes on fire.  Your linen trousers are  going brown as it is!"  

He clapped his hand on his thigh and stood hesitating on the verge.   "Gibberne," I cried, coming up, "put it down.  This heat is too much!  It's our running so! Two or three miles a second! Friction of the air!"  

"What?" he said, glancing at the dog.  

"Friction of the air," I shouted.  "Friction of the air.  Going too fast.   Like meteorites and things.  Too hot.  And, Gibberne! Gibberne!  I'm all over pricking and a sort of perspiration.  You can see people  stirring slightly.  I believe the stuff's working off! Put that dog down."  

"Eh?" he said.  

"It's working off," I repeated.  "We're too hot and the stuff's working  off! I'm wet through."  

He stared at me.  Then at the band, the wheezy rattle of whose  performance was certainly going faster.  Then with a tremendous  sweep of the arm he hurled the dog away from him and it went         spinning upward, still inanimate, and hung at last over the grouped  parasols of a knot of chattering people.  Gibberne was gripping my  elbow.  "By Jove!" he cried.  "I believe it is! A sort of hot pricking  and—yes.  That man's moving his pocket-handkerchief! Perceptibly.   We must get out of this sharp."  

But we could not get out of it sharply enough.  Luckily, perhaps!  For we might have run, and if we had run we should, I believe, have  burst into flames.  Almost certainly we should have burst into flames!  You know we had neither of us thought of that. . . . But before  we could even begin to run the action of the drug had ceased.  It was  the business of a minute fraction of a second.  The effect of the  New Accelerator passed like the drawing of a curtain, vanished in the  movement of a hand.  I heard Gibberne's voice in infinite alarm.   "Sit down," he said, and flop, down upon the turf at the edge of the  Leas I sat—scorching as I sat.  There is a patch of burnt grass there  still where I sat down.  The whole stagnation seemed to wake up as  I did so, the disarticulated vibration of the band rushed together  into a blast of music, the promenaders put their feet down and  walked their ways, the papers and flags began flapping, smiles passed  into words, the winker finished his wink and went on his way   complacently, and all the seated people moved and spoke.  

The whole world had come alive again, was going as fast as we  were, or rather we were going no faster than the rest of the world.   It was like slowing down as one comes into a railway station.  Everything seemed to spin round for a second or two, I had the most  transient feeling of nausea, and that was all.  And the little dog which  had seemed to hang for a moment when the force of Gibberne's arm  was expended fell with a swift acceleration clean through a lady's  parasol!  

That was the saving of us.  Unless it was for one corpulent old  gentleman in a bath-chair, who certainly did start at the sight of us  and afterwards regarded us at intervals with a darkly suspicious eye,  and, finally, I believe, said something to his nurse about us, I doubt  if a solitary person remarked our sudden appearance among them.   Plop! We must have appeared abruptly.  We ceased to smoulder  almost at once, though the turf beneath me was uncomfortably hot.   The attention of every one—including even the Amusements' Association   band, which on this occasion, for the only time in its history,  got out of tune—was arrested by the amazing fact, and the still more  amazing yapping and uproar caused by the fact that a respectable,  over-fed lap-dog sleeping quietly to the east of the bandstand should  suddenly fall through the parasol of a lady on the west—in a slightly  singed condition due to the extreme velocity of its movements through         the air.  In these absurd days, too, when we are all trying to be as  psychic, and silly, and superstitious as possible! People got up and  trod on other people, chairs were overturned, the Leas policeman  ran.  How the matter settled itself I do not know—we were much  too anxious to disentangle ourselves from the affair and get out of  range of the eye of the old gentleman in the bath-chair to make  minute inquiries.  As soon as we were sufficiently cool and sufficiently  recovered from our giddiness and nausea and confusion of mind to do  so we stood up and, skirting the crowd, directed our steps back along  the road below the Metropole towards Gibberne's house.  But amidst  the din I heard very distinctly the gentleman who had been sitting  beside the lady of the ruptured sunshade using quite unjustifiable  threats and language to one of those chair-attendants who have   "Inspector" written on their caps.  "If you didn't throw the dog," he said,  "who did?"  

The sudden return of movement and familiar noises, and our  natural anxiety about ourselves (our clothes were still dreadfully hot,  and the fronts of the thighs of Gibberne's white trousers were  scorched a drabbish brown), prevented the minute observations I  should have liked to make on all these things.  Indeed, I really made  no observations of any scientific value on that return.  The bee, of  course, had gone.  I looked for that cyclist, but he was already out of  sight as we came into the Upper Sandgate Road or hidden from us  by traffic; the char-a-banc, however, with its people now all alive  and stirring, was clattering along at a spanking pace almost abreast  of the nearer church.  

We noted, however, that the window-sill on which we had stepped  in getting out of the house was slightly singed, and that the   impressions of our feet on the gravel of the path were unusually deep.    

So it was I had my first experience of the New Accelerator.    Practically we had been running about and saying and doing all sorts of  things in the space of a second or so of time.  We had lived half an  hour while the band had played, perhaps, two bars.  But the effect it  had upon us was that the whole world had stopped for our convenient   inspection.  Considering all things, and particularly considering  our rashness in venturing out of the house, the experience might  certainly have been much more disagreeable than it was.  It showed,  no doubt, that Gibberne has still much to learn before his preparation   is a manageable convenience, but its practicability it certainly  demonstrated beyond all cavil.  

Since that adventure he has been steadily bringing its use under  control, and I have several times, and without the slightest bad result,         taken measured doses under his direction; though I must confess I  have not yet ventured abroad again while under its influence.  I may  mention, for example, that this story has been written at one sitting  and without interruption, except for the nibbling of some chocolate,  by its means.  I began at 6:25, and my watch is now very nearly at  the minute past the half-hour.  The convenience of securing a long,  uninterrupted spell of work in the midst of a day full of engagements  cannot be exaggerated.  Gibberne is now working at the quantitative  handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its distinctive  effects upon different types of constitution.  He then hopes to find a  Retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency.   The Retarder will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator;  used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over  many hours of ordinary time, and so to maintain an apathetic  inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated  or irritating surroundings.  The two things together must necessarily  work an entire revolution in civilised existence.  It is the beginning  of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks.   While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with  tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our  utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us to pass in passive  tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium.  Perhaps I am a  little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still to be  discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of  doubt whatever.  Its appearance upon the market in a convenient,  controllable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few  months.  It will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small  green bottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities,  by no means excessive price.  Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will  be called, and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one  in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink,  and white labels respectively.  

No doubt its use renders a great number of very extraordinary  things possible; for, of course, the most remarkable and, possibly,  even criminal proceedings may be effected with impunity by thus  dodging, as it were, into the interstices of time.  Like all potent   preparations it will be liable to abuse.  We have, however, discussed this  aspect of the question very thoroughly, and we have decided that  this is purely a matter of medical jurisprudence and altogether outside  our province.  We shall manufacture and sell the Accelerator, and,  as for the consequences—we shall see.  

           
# THE DIAMOND MAKER

    Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane until nine in  the evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was  disinclined either for entertainment or further work.  So much of the  sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canyon of traffic left visible spoke  of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the   Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the   variegated lights upon the river.  Beyond comparison the night is the  best time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the  waters, and the lights of this transition age, red, glaring orange,  gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every  possible shade between grey and deep purple.  Through the arches of  Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the  Embankment and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster,  warm grey against the starlight.  The black river goes by with only a  rare ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the  lights that swim upon its surface.  

"A warm night," said a voice at my side.  

I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning  over the parapet beside me.  It was a refined face, not unhandsome,  though pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and  pinned round the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a  uniform.  I felt I was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast  if I answered him.  

I looked at him curiously.  Would he have anything to tell me  worth the money, or was he the common incapable—incapable even  of telling his own story? There was a quality of intelligence in his         forehead and eyes, and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that  decided me.  

"Very warm," said I; "but not too warm for us here."  

"No," he said, still looking across the water, "it is pleasant enough  here . . . just now.  

"It is good," he continued after a pause, "to find anything so  restful as this in London.   After one has been fretting about business  all day, about getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers,  I do not know what one would do if it were not for such pacific  corners." He spoke with long pauses between the sentences.  "You  must know a little of the irksome labour of the world, or you would  not be here.  But I doubt if you can be so brain-weary and footsore  as I am . . . Bah! Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle.   I feel inclined to throw the whole thing over—name, wealth, and  position—and take to some modest trade.  But I know if I abandoned  my ambition—hardly as she uses me—I should have nothing but   remorse left for the rest of my days."  

He became silent.  I looked at him in astonishment.  If ever I saw  a man hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me.  He was  ragged and he was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though  he had been left in a dust-bin for a week.  And he was talking to me  of the irksome worries of a large business.  I almost laughed outright.   Either he was mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty.  

"If high aims and high positions,", said I, "have their drawbacks of  hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. influence, the  power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than our-selves;   and there is even a certain gratification in display . . . ."  

My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste.  I spoke  on the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech.  I was sorry  even while I was speaking.  

He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me.  Said he:  "I forget myself.  Of course you would not understand."  

He measured me for a moment.  "No doubt it is very absurd.  You  will not believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to  tell you.  And it will be a comfort to tell someone.  I really have a big  business in hand, a very big business.  But there are troubles just now.   The fact is . . . I make diamonds."  

"I suppose," said I, "you are out of work just at present?"  

"I am sick of being disbelieved," he said impatiently, and suddenly  unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that  was hanging by a cord round his neck.  From this he produced a  brown pebble.  "I wonder if you know enough to know what that  is?" He handed it to me.         

Now, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a   London science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and   mineralogy.  The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort,  though far too large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb.   I took it, and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the  curved faces peculiar to the most precious of minerals.  I took out  my penknife and tried to scratch it—vainly.  Leaning forward towards  the gas-lamp, I tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white  line across that with the greatest ease.  

I looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity.  "It certainly is  rather like a diamond.  But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds.   Where did you get it?"  

"I tell you I made it," he  said.  "Give it back to me."  

He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket.  "I will sell it you for  one hundred pounds," he suddenly whispered eagerly.  With that  my suspicions returned.  The thing might, after all, be merely a lump  of that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental  resemblance in shape to the diamond.  Or if it was a diamond, how  came he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds?  

We looked into one another's eye.  He seemed eager, but honestly  eager.  At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to  sell.  Yet I am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible  gap in my fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gas-light   from a ragged tramp on his personal warranty only.  Still,  a diamond that size conjured up a vision of many thousands of  pounds.  Then, thought I, such a stone could scarcely exist without  being mentioned in every book on gems, and again I called to mind  the stories of contraband and lightfingered Kaffirs at the Cape.  I put  the question of purchase on one side.  

"How did you get it?" said I.  

"I made it."  

I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial   diamonds were very small.  I shook my head.  

"You seem to know something of this kind of thing.  I will tell you  a little about myself.  Perhaps then you may think better of the  purchase." He turned round with his back to the river, and put his  hands in his pockets.  He sighed.  "I know you will not believe me.  

"Diamonds," he began—and as he spoke his voice lost its faint  flavour of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an  educated man—"are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination   in a suitable flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon  crystallises out, not as black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small   diamonds.  So much has been known to chemists for years, but no one         yet has hit upon exactly the right flux in which to melt up the carbon,  or exactly the right pressure for the best results.  Consequently the  diamonds made by chemists are small and dark, and worthless as  jewels.  Now I, you know, have given up my life to this problem—  given my life to it.  

"I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was  seventeen, and now I am thirty-two.  It seemed to me that it might  take all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty  years, but even if it did, the game was still worth the candle.  Suppose  one to have at last just hit the right trick, before the secret got out  and diamonds became as common as coal, one might realise millions.   Millions!"  

He paused and looked for my sympathy.  His eyes shone hungrily.   "To think," said he, "that I am on the verge of it all, and here!  

"I had," he proceeded, "about a thousand pounds when I was  twenty-one, and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would  keep my researches going.  A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin  chiefly, and then I continued on my own account.  The trouble was  the secrecy.  You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other  men might have been spurred on by my belief in the practicability  of the idea; and I do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been  sure of coming in first, in the case of a race for the discovery.  And  you see it was important that if I really meant to make a pile, people  should not know it was an artificial process and capable of turning  out diamonds by the ton.  So I had to work all alone.  At first I had  a little laboratory, but as my resources began to run out I had to  conduct my experiments in a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish  Town, where I slept at last on a straw mattress on the floor among all  my apparatus.  The money simply flowed away.  I grudged myself  everything except scientific appliances.  I tried to keep things going by  a little teaching, but I am not a very good teacher, and I have no   university degree, nor very much education except in chemistry, and I  found I had to give a lot of time and labour for precious little money.   But I got nearer and nearer the thing.  Three years ago I settled  the problem of the composition of the flux, and got near the pressure  by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon composition into  a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing tightly, and   heating."  

He paused.  

"Rather risky," said I.  

"Yes.  It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my   apparatus; but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless.  Following  out the problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture         from which the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some researches  of Daubree's at the Paris Laboratorie des Poudres et Salpetres.  He  exploded dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong  to burst, and I found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike  the South African bed in which diamonds are found.  It was a tremendous   strain on my resources, but I got a steel cylinder made for  my purpose after his pattern.  I put in all my stuff and my explosives,  built up a fire in my furnace, put the whole concern in, and—went  out for a walk."  

I could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner.  "Did you not  think it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the  place?"  

"It was in the interest of science," he said, ultimately.  "There was  a coster-monger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in  the room behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs.  Perhaps  it was a bit thoughtless.  But possibly some of them were out.  

"When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the  white-hot coals.  The explosive hadn't burst the case.  And then I had  a problem to face.  You know time is an important element in   crystallisation.  If you hurry the process the crystals   are small—it is only by prolonged standing that they grow to any size.    I resolved to let this apparatus cool for two years, letting   the temperature go down slowly during that time.  And I was now   quite out of money; and with a big fire and the rent of my room,   as well as my hunger to satisfy, I had scarcely a penny in the world.  

"I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making  the diamonds.  I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors.   For many weeks I addressed envelopes.  I had a place as assistant to  a man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the  road while he called down the other.  Once for a week I had absolutely  nothing to do, and I begged.  What a week that was! One day the fire  was going out and I had eaten nothing all day, and a little chap  taking his girl out gave me sixpence—to show-off.  Thank heaven for  vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went and spent it all on coals,  and had the furnace bright red again, and then—Well, hunger  makes a fool of a man.  

"At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out.  I took my cylinder  and unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands,  and I scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and  hammered it into a powder upon an iron plate.  And I found three  big diamonds and five small ones.  As I sat on the floor hammering, my  door opened, and my neighbour, the begging-letter writer, came in.   He was drunk—as he usually is.  "Nerchist,' said he.  'You're drunk,'         said I. "Structive scoundrel,' said he.  'Go to your father,' said I,  meaning the Father of Lies.  'Never you mind,' said he, and gave me  a cunning wink, and hiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with  his other eye against the door-post, began to babble of how he had  been prying in my room, and how he had gone to the police that  morning, and how they had taken down everything he had to say—  "siffiwas a ge'm,' said he.  Then I suddenly realised I was in a hole.   Either I should have to tell these police my little secret, and get  the whole thing blown upon, or be lagged as an Anarchist.  So I went  up to my neighbour and took him by the collar, and rolled him  about a bit, and then I gathered up my diamonds and cleared out.   The evening newspapers called my den the Kentish-Town Bomb  Factory.  And now I cannot part with the things for love or money.  

"If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go  and whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot  wait.  And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply  stuck to the one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it  back.  I am going about now with several hundred thousand pounds'  worth of diamonds round my neck, and without either food or shelter.   You are the first person I have taken into my confidence.  But I like  your face and I am hard-driven."  

He looked into my eyes.  

"It would be madness," said I, "for me to buy a diamond under  the circumstances.  Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about  in my pocket.  Yet I more than half believe your story.  I will,   if you  like, do this: come to my office to-morrow. . . ."  

"You think I am a thief!" said he keenly.  "You will tell the police.   I am not coming into a trap."  

"Somehow I am assured you are no thief.  Here is my card.  Take  that, anyhow.  You need not come to any appointment.  Come when  you will."  

He took the card, and an earnest of my good will.  

"Think better of it and come," said I.  

He shook his head doubtfully.  "I will pay back your half-crown  with interest some day—such interest as will amaze you," said he.   "Anyhow, you will keep the secret? . . .  Don't follow me."  

He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little  steps under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go.   And that was the last I ever saw of him.  

Afterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send banknotes—  not cheques—to certain addresses.  I weighed the matter over,  and took what I conceived to be the wisest course.  Once he called  upon me when I was out.  My urchin described him as a very thin,         dirty, and ragged man, with a dreadful cough.  He left no message.   That was the finish of him so far as my story goes.  I wonder   sometimes what has become of him.  Was he an ingenious monomaniac, or  a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has he really made diamonds as he  asserted? The latter is just sufficiently credible to make me think at  times that I have missed the most brilliant opportunity of my life.  He  may of course be dead, and his diamonds carelessly thrown aside—  one, I repeat, was almost as big as my thumb.  Or he may be still  wandering about trying to sell the things.  It is just possible he may  yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart my heavens in the  serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the well-advertised, reproach  me silently for my want of enterprise.  I sometimes think I might at  least have risked five pounds.  

               
# THE APPLE

    "I must get rid of it," said the man in the corner of the carriage,  abruptly breaking the silence.  

Mr. Hinchcliff looked up, hearing imperfectly.  He had been  lost in the rapt contemplation of the college cap tied by a string to  his portmanteau handles—the outward and visible sign of his newly-gained pedagogic position—in the rapt appreciation of the college cap  and the pleasant anticipations it excited.  For Mr. Hinchcliff had  just matriculated at London University, and was going to be junior  assistant at the Holmwood Grammar School—a very enviable position.   He stared across the carriage at his fellow-traveller.  

"Why not give it away?" said this person.  "Give it away! Why not?"  

He was a tall, dark, sunburnt man with a pale face.  His arms  were folded tightly, and his feet were on the scat in front of him.   He was pulling at a lank, black moustache.  He stared hard at his  toes.  

"Why not?" he said.  

Mr. Hinchcliff coughed.  

The stranger lifted his eyes—they were curious, dark-grey eyes—  and stared blankly at Mr. Hinchcliff for the best part of a minute,  perhaps.  His expression grew to interest.  

"Yes," he said slowly.  "Why not? And end it."  

"I don't quite follow you, I'm afraid," said Mr. Hinchcliff, with  another cough.  

"You don't quite follow me?" said the stranger, quite mechanically,  his singular eyes wandering from Mr. Hinchcliff to the bag with its  ostentatiously displayed cap, and back to Mr. Hinchcliff's downy face.         

"You're so abrupt, you know," apologised Mr. Hinchcliff.  

"Why shouldn't I?" said the stranger, following his thoughts.  "You  are a student?" he said, addressing Mr. Hinchcliff.  

"I am—by Correspondence—of the London University," said Mr.  Hinchcliff, with irrepressible pride, and feeling nervously at his tie.  

"In pursuit of knowledge," said the stranger, and suddenly took  his feet off the seat, put his fist on his knees, and stared at Mr.  Hinchcliff as though he had never seen a student before.  "Yes," he  said, and flung out an index finger.  Then he rose, took a bag from  the hat-rack, and unlocked it.  Quite silently, he drew out something  round and wrapped in a quantity of silver-paper, and unfolded this  carefully.  He held it out towards Mr. Hinchcliff,—a small, very smooth,  golden-yellow fruit.  

Mr. Hinchcliff's eyes and mouth were open.  He did not offer to take  this object—if he was intended to take it.  

"That," said this fantastic stranger, speaking very slowly, "is the  Apple of the Tree of Knowledge.  Look at it—small, and bright, and  wonderful—Knowledge—and I am going to give it to you."  

Mr. Hinchcliff's mind worked painfully for a minute, and then the  sufficient explanation, "Mad!" flashed across his brain, and illuminated  the whole situation.  One humoured madmen.  He put his head a little  on one side.  

"The Apple of the Tree of Knowledge, eigh!" said Mr. Hinchcliff,  regarding it with a finely assumed air of interest, and then looking  at the interlocutor.  "But don't you want to eat it yourself? And  besides—how did you come by it?"  

"It never fades.  I have had it now three months.  And it is ever  bright and smooth and ripe and desirable, as you see it." He laid  his hand on his knee and regarded the fruit musingly.  Then he began  to wrap it again in the papers, as though he had abandoned his   intention of giving it away.  

"But how did you come by it?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, who had his  argumentative side.  "And how do you know that it is the Fruit of  the Tree?"  

"I bought this fruit," said the stranger, "three months ago—for a  drink of water and a crust of bread.  The man who gave it to me—  because I kept the life in him—was an Armenian.  Armenia! that  wonderful country, the first of all countries, where the ark of the  Flood remains to this day, buried in the glaciers of Mount Ararat.   This man, I say, fleeing with others from the Kurds who had come  upon them, went up into desolate places among the mountains—places  beyond the common knowledge of men.  And fleeing from imminent  pursuit, they came to a slope high among the mountain-peaks,         green with a grass like knife-blades, that cut and slashed most  pitilessly at any one who went into it.  The Kurds were close behind,  and there was nothing for it but to plunge in, and the worst of it  was that the paths they made through it at the price of their blood  served for the Kurds to follow.  Every one of the fugitives was killed  save this Armenian and another.  He heard the screams and cries of  his friends, and the swish of the grass about those who were pursuing  them—it was tall grass rising overhead.  And then a shouting and   answers, and when presently he paused, everything was still.  He  pushed out again, not understanding, cut and bleeding, until he  came out on a steep slope of rocks below a precipice, and then  he saw the grass was all on fire, and the smoke of it rose like a veil   between him and his enemies."  

The stranger paused.  "Yes?" said Mr. Hinchcliff.  "Yes?"  

"There he was, all torn and bloody from the knife-blades of the  grass, the rocks blazing under the afternoon sun,—the sky molten brass,  —and the smoke of the fire driving towards him.  He dared not stay  there.  Death he did not mind, but torture! Far away beyond the  smoke he heard shouts and cries.  Women screaming.  So he went  clambering up a gorge in the rocks—everywhere were bushes with dry  branches that stuck out like thorns among the leaves—until he  clambered over the brow of a ridge that hid him.  And then he met  his companion, a shepherd, who had also escaped.  And, counting cold  and famine and thirst as nothing against the Kurds, they went on  into the heights, and among the snow and ice.  They wandered three  whole days.  

"The third day came the vision.  I suppose hungry men often do  see visions, but then there is this fruit." He lifted the wrapped globe  in his hand.  "And I have heard it, too, from other mountaineers who  have known something of the legend. it was in the evening time, when  the stars were increasing, that they came down a slope of polished  rock into a huge, dark valley all set about with strange, contorted  trees, and in these trees hung little globes like glow-worm spheres,  strange, round, yellow lights.  

"Suddenly this valley was lit far away, many miles away, far down  it, with a golden flame marching slowly athwart it, that made the  stunted trees against it black as night, and turned the slopes all about  them and their figures to the likeness of fiery gold.  And at the vision  they, knowing the legends of the mountains, instantly knew that it  was Eden they saw, or the sentinel of Eden, and they fell upon their  faces like men struck dead.  

"When they dared to look again, the valley was dark for a space,  and then the light came again—returning, a burning amber.         

"At that the shepherd sprang to his feet, and with a shout began  to run down towards the light; but the other man was too fearful  to follow him.  He stood stunned, amazed, and terrified, watching his  companion recede towards the marching glare.  And hardly had the  shepherd set out when there came a noise like thunder, the beating  of invisible wings hurrying up the valley, and a great and terrible fear;  and at that the man who gave me the fruit turned—if he might still  escape.  And hurrying headlong up the slope again, with that tumult  sweeping after him, he stumbled against one of these stunted bushes,  and a ripe fruit came off it into his hand.  This fruit.  Forthwith, the  wings and the thunder rolled all about him.  He fell and fainted,  and when he came to his senses, he was back among the blackened  ruins of his own village, and I and the others were attending to the  wounded.  A vision? But the golden fruit of the tree was still clutched  in his hand.  There were others there who knew the legend, knew  what that strange fruit might be." He paused.  "And this is it," he  said.  

It was a most extraordinary story to be told in a third-class carriage  on a Sussex railway. lt was as if the real was a mere veil to the  fantastic, and here was the fantastic poking through.  "Is it?" was all  Mr. Hinchcliff could say.  

"The legend," said the stranger, "tells that those thickets of dwarfed  trees growing about the garden sprang from the apple that Adam  carried in his hand when he 'and Eve were driven forth.  He felt  something in his hand, saw the half-eaten apple, and flung it   petulantly aside.  And there they grow, in that desolate valley, girdled  round with the everlasting snows; and there the fiery swords keep  ward against the Judgment Day."  

"But I thought these things were—" Mr. Hinchcliff paused—"fables  —parables rather.  Do you mean to tell me that there in Armenia—"  

The stranger answered the unfinished question with the fruit in his  open hand.  

"But you don't know," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "that that is the fruit of  the Tree of Knowledge.  The man may have had—a sort of mirage, say.   Suppose—"  

"Look at it," said the stranger.  

It was certainly a strange-looking globe, not really an apple, Mr.  Hinchcliff saw, and a curious glowing golden colour, almost as though  light itself was wrought into its substance.  As he looked at it, he began  to see more vividly the desolate valley among the mountains, the  guarding swords of fire, the strange antiquities of the story he had  just heard.  He rubbed a knuckle into his eye.  "But—" said he.         

"It has kept like that, smooth and full, three months.  Longer than  that it is now by some days.  No drying, no withering, no decay."  

"And you yourself," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "really believe that—"  

"Is the Forbidden Fruit."  

There was no mistaking the earnestness of the man's manner and  his perfect sanity.  "The Fruit of Knowledge," he said.  

"Suppose it was?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, after a pause, still staring at  it. "But after all," said Mr. Hinchcliff, "it's not my kind of knowledge  —not the sort of knowledge.  I mean, Adam and Eve have eaten it   already."  

"We inherit their sins—not their knowledge," said the stranger.   "That would make it all clear and bright again.  We should see  into everything, through everything, into the deepest meaning of  everything—"  

"Why don't you eat it, then?" said Mr. Hinchcliff, with an   inspiration.  

"I took it intending to eat it," said the stranger.  "Man has fallen.   Merely to eat again could scarcely—"  

"Knowledge is power," said Mr. Hinchcliff.  

"But is it happiness? I am older than you—more than twice as old.   Time after time I have held this in my hand, and my heart has failed  me at the thought of all that one might know, that terrible lucidity—  Suppose suddenly all the world became pitilessly clear?"  

"That, I think, would be a great advantage," said Mr. Hinchcliff,  "on the whole."  

Suppose you saw into the hearts and minds of every one about you,  into their most secret recesses—people you loved, whose love you  valued?"  

"You'd soon find out the humbugs," said Mr. Hinchcliff, greatly  struck by the idea.  

"And worse—to know yourself, bare of your most intimate illusions.   To see yourself in your place.  All that your lusts and weaknesses   prevented your doing.  No merciful perspective."  

"That might be an excellent thing too. 'Know thyself,' you know."  

"You are young," said the stranger.  

"If you don't care to eat it, and it bothers you, why don't you throw  it away?"  

"There again, perhaps, you will not understand me.  To me, how  could one throw away a thing like that, glowing, wonderful? Once one  has it, one is bound.  But, on the other hand, to give it away! To give  it away to some one who thirsted after knowledge, who found no  terror in the thought of that clear perception—"         

"Of course," said Mr. Hinchcliff, thoughtfully, "it might be some  sort of poisonous fruit."  

And then his eye caught something motionless, the end of a white  board black-lettered outside the carriage-window.  "-MWOOD," he  saw.  He started convulsively.  "Gracious!" said Mr. Hinchcliff.  "Holmwood!"—and the practical present blotted out the mystic realisations  that had been stealing upon him.  

In another moment he was opening the carriage-door, portmanteau  in hand.  The guard was already fluttering his green flag.  Mr.   Hinchcliff jumped out.  "Here!" said a voice behind him, and he saw the  dark eyes of the stranger shining and the golden fruit, bright and  bare, held out of the open carriage-door.  He took it instinctively,  the train was already moving.  

"No!" shouted the stranger, and made a snatch at it as if to take it  back.  

"Stand away," cried a country porter, thrusting forward to close  the door.  The stranger shouted something Mr. Hinchcliff did not  catch, head and arm thrust excitedly out of the window, and then  the shadow of the bridge fell on him, and in a trice he was hidden.   Mr. Hinchcliff stood astonished, staring at the end of the last waggon  receding round the bend, and with the wonderful fruit in his hand.   For the fraction of a minute his mind was confused, and then he  became aware that two or three people on the platform were   regarding him with interest.  Was he not the new Grammar School  master making his debut? It occurred to him that, so far as they could  tell, the fruit might very well be the naive refreshment of an orange.   He flushed at the thought, and thrust the fruit into his side pocket,  where it bulged undesirably.  But there was no help for it, so he went  towards them, awkwardly concealing his sense of awkwardness, to  ask the way to the Grammar School, and the means of getting his  portmanteau and the two tin boxes which lay up the platform thither.   Of all the odd and fantastic yarns to tell a fellow!  

His luggage could be taken on a truck for sixpence, he found, and  he could precede it on foot.  He fancied an ironical note in the  voices.  He was painfully aware of his contour.  

The curious earnestness of the man in the train, and the glamour  of the story he told, had, for a time, diverted the current of Mr.  Hinchcliff's thoughts.  It drove like a mist before his immediate   concerns.  Fires that went to and fro! But the preoccupation of his new  position, and the impression he was to produce upon Holmwood  generally, and the school people in particular, returned upon him  with reinvigorating power before he left the station and cleared his  mental atmosphere.  But it is extraordinary what an inconvenient         thing the addition of a soft and rather brightly-golden fruit, not  three inches in diameter, may prove to a sensitive youth on his  best appearance.  In the pocket of his black jacket it bulged dreadfully,   spoilt the lines altogether.  He passed a little old lady in black,  and he felt her eye drop upon the excrescence at once.  He was wearing  one glove and carrying the other, together with his stick, so that to  bear the fruit openly was impossible.  In one place, where the road  into the town seemed suitably secluded, he took his encumbrance  out of his pocket and tried it in his hat.  It was just too large, the  hat wobbled ludicrously, and just as he was taking it out again, a  butcher's boy came driving round the corner.  

"Confound it!" said Mr. Hinchcliff.  

He would have eaten the thing, and attained omniscience there  and then, but it would seem so silly to go into the town sucking a  juicy fruit—and it certainly felt juicy. if one of the boys should  come by, it might do him a serious injury with his discipline so to  be seen.  And the juice might make his face sticky and get upon his  cuffs—or it might be an acid juice as potent as lemon, and take all  the colour out of his clothes.  

Then round a bend in the lane came two pleasant, sunlit, girlish  figures.  They were walking slowly towards the town and chattering  —at any moment they might look round and see a hot-faced young  man behind them carrying a kind of phosphorescent yellow tomato!  They would be sure to laugh.  

"Hang!" said Mr. Hinchcliff, and with a swift jerk sent the   encumbrance flying over the stone wall of an orchard that there abutted  on the road.  As it vanished, he felt a faint twinge of loss that lasted  scarcely a moment.  He adjusted the stick and glove in his hand, and  walked on, erect and self-conscious, to pass the girls.    

But in the darkness of the night Mr. Hinchcliff had a dream, and  saw the valley, and the flaming swords, and the contorted trees, and  knew that it really was the Apple of the Tree of Knowledge that  he had thrown regardlessly away.  And he awoke very unhappy.  

In the morning his regret had passed, but afterwards it returned  and troubled him; never, however, when he was happy or busily  occupied.  At last, one moonlight night about eleven, when all   Holmwood was quiet, his regrets returned with redoubled force, and   therewith an impulse to adventure.  He slipped out of the house and  over the playground wall, went through the silent town to Station  Lane, and climbed into the orchard where he had thrown the fruit.   But nothing was to be found of it there among the dewy grass and  the faint intangible globes of dandelion down.  

               
# THE PURPLE PILEUS

    Mr. Coombes was sick of life.  He walked away from his unhappy  home, and, sick not only of his own existence, but of everybody  else's, turned aside down Gaswork Lane to avoid the town, and, crossing   the wooden bridge that goes over the canal to Starling's Cottages,  was presently alone in the damp pinewoods and out of sight and  sound of human habitation.  He would stand it no longer.  He repeated  aloud with blasphemies unusual to him that he would stand it no  longer.  

He was a pale-faced little man, with dark eyes and a fine and very  black moustache.  He had a very stiff, upright collar slightly frayed,  that gave him an illusory double chin, and his overcoat (albeit shabby)  was trimmed with astrachan.  His gloves were a bright brown with  black stripes over the knuckles, and split at the finger-ends.  His   appearance, his wife had said once in the dear, dead days beyond recall,  —before he married her, that is,—was military.  But now she called  him— It seems a dreadful thing to tell of between husband and wife,  but she called him "a little grub." It wasn't the only thing she had  called him, either.  

The row had arisen about that beastly Jennie again.  Jennie was  his wife's friend, and, by no invitation of Mr. Coombes, she came  in every blessed Sunday to dinner, and made a shindy all the afternoon.   She was a big, noisy girl, with a taste for loud colours and a strident  laugh; and this Sunday she had outdone all her previous intrusions  by bringing in a fellow with her, a chap as showy as herself.  And  Mr. Coombes, in a starchy, clean collar and his Sunday frock-coat, had  sat dumb and wrathful at his own table, while his wife and her guests         talked foolishly and undesirably, and laughed aloud.  Well, he stood  that, and after dinner (which, "as usual," was late), what must Miss  Jennie do but go to the piano and play banjo tunes, for all the world  as if it were a week-day! Flesh and blood could not endure such  goings-on.  They would hear next door; they would hear in the road;  it was a public announcement of their disrepute.  He had to speak.  

He had felt himself go pale, and a kind of rigour had affected  his respiration as he delivered himself.  He had been sitting on one  of the chairs by the window—the new guest had taken possession  of the arm-chair.  He turned his head.  "Sun Day!" he said over the  collar, in the voice of one who warns.  "Sun Day!" What people call  a "nasty" tone it was.  

Jennie had kept on playing; but his wife, who was looking through  some music that was piled on the top of the piano, had stared at him.   "What's wrong now?" she said; "can't people enjoy themselves?"  

"I don't mind rational 'njoyment, at all," said little Coombes;  "but I ain't a-going to have week-day tunes playing on a Sunday in  this house."  

"What's wrong with my playing now?" said Jennie, stopping and  twirling round on the music-stool with a monstrous rustle of flounces.  

Coombes saw it was going to be a row, and opened too vigorously,  as is common with your timid, nervous men all the world over.  "Steady  on with that music-stool!" said he; "it ain't made for 'eavy weights."  

"Never you mind about weights," said Jennie, incensed.  "What  was you saying behind my back about my playing?"  

"Surely you don't 'old with not having a bit of music on a Sunday,  Mr. Coombes?" said the new guest, leaning back in the arm-chair,  blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke and smiling in a kind of pitying  way.  And simultaneously his wife said something to Jennie about  "Never mind 'im.  You go on, Jinny."  

"I do," said Mr. Coombes, addressing the new guest.  

"May I arst why?" said the new guest, evidently enjoying both his  cigarette and the prospect of an argument.  He was, by-the-by, a  lank young man, very stylishly dressed in bright drab, and a white  cravat and a pearl and silver pin.  It had been better taste to come  in a black coat, Mr. Coombes thought.  

"Because," began Mr. Coombes, "it don't suit me.  I'm a business  man.  I 'ave to study my connection.  Rational 'njoyment  

"His connection!" said Mrs. Coombes, scornfully.  "That's what  he's always a-saying.  We got to do this, and we got to do that—"  

"If you don't mean to study my connection," said Mr. Coombes,  "what did you marry me for?"  

"I wonder," said Jennie, and turned back to the piano.         

"I never saw such a man as you," said Mrs. Coombes.  "You've   altered all round since we were married.  Before—"  

Then Jennie began at the tum, tum, tum again.  

"Look here!" said Mr. Coombes, driven at last to revolt, standing up  and raising his voice.  "I tell you I won't have that." The frock-coat  heaved with his indignation.  

"No vi'lence, now," said the long young man in drab, sitting up.  

"Who the juice are you?" said Mr. Coombes, fiercely.  

Whereupon they all began talking at once.  The new guest said  he was Jennie's "intended," and meant to protect her, and Mr.  Coombes said he was welcome to do so anywhere but in his (Mr.   Coombes') house; and Mrs. Coombes said he ought to be ashamed of  insulting his guests, and (as I have already mentioned) that he was  getting a regular little grub; and the end was, that Mr. Coombes   ordered his visitors out of the house, and they wouldn't go, and so he  said he would go himself.  With his face burning and tears of excitement   in his eyes, he went into the passage, and as he struggled with  his overcoat—his frock-coat sleeves got concertinaed up his arm—and  gave a brush at his silk hat, Jennie began again at the piano, and  strummed him insultingly out of the house.  Tum, tum, tum.  He slammed   the shop-door so that the house quivered.  That, briefly, was  the immediate making of his mood.  You will perhaps begin to   understand his disgust with existence.  

As he walked along the muddy path under the firs,—it was late  October, and the ditches and heaps of fir-needles were gorgeous with  clumps of fungi,—he recapitulated the melancholy history of his   marriage.  It was brief and commonplace enough.  He now perceived with  sufficient clearness that his wife had married him out of a natural  curiosity and in order to escape from her worrying, laborious, and  uncertain life in the workroom; and, like the majority of her class,  she was far too stupid to realise that it was her duty to co-operate  with him in his business.  She was greedy of enjoyment, loquacious, and  socially-minded, and evidently disappointed to find the restraints of  poverty still hanging about her.  His worries exasperated her, and  the slightest attempt to control her proceedings resulted in a charge  of "grumbling." Why couldn't he be nice—as he used to be? And  Coombes was such a harmless little man, too, nourished mentally on  "Self-Help," and with a meagre ambition of self-denial and   competition, that was to end in a "sufficiency." Then Jennie came in as a  female Mephistopheles, a gabbling chronicle of "fellers," and was al-ways wanting his wife to go to theatres, and "all that." And in   addition were aunts of his wife, and cousins (male and female), to eat  up capital, insult him personally, upset business arrangements, annoy         good customers, and generally blight his life.  It was not the first   occasion by many that Mr. Coombes had fled his home in wrath and   indignation, and something like fear, vowing furiously and even aloud  that he wouldn't stand it, and so frothing away his energy along the  line of least resistance.  But never before had he been quite so sick  of life as on this particular Sunday afternoon.  The Sunday dinner may  have had its share in his despair—and the greyness of the sky.    Perhaps, too, he was beginning to realise his unendurable frustration as  a business man as the consequence of his marriage.  Presently bankruptcy,  and after that— Perhaps she might have reason to repent when  it was too late.  And destiny, as I have already intimated, had planted  the path through the wood with evil-smelling fungi, thickly and  variously planted it, not only on the right side, but on the left.  

A small shopman is in such a melancholy position, if his wife turns  out a disloyal partner.  His capital is all tied up in his business, and  to leave her, means to join the unemployed in some strange part of  the earth.  The luxuries of divorce are beyond him altogether.  So that  the good old tradition of marriage for better or worse holds inexorably  for him, and things work up to tragic culminations.  Bricklayers kick  their wives to death, and dukes betray theirs; but it is among the  small clerks and shopkeepers nowadays that it comes most often to a  cutting of throats.  Under the circumstances it is not so very remarkable  —and you must take it as charitably as you can—that the mind of Mr.  Coombes ran for awhile on some such glorious close to his disappointed   hopes, and that he thought of razors, pistols, bread-knives,  and touching letters to the coroner denouncing his enemies by name,  and praying piously for forgiveness.  After a time his fierceness gave  way to melancholia.  He had been married in this very overcoat, in  his first and only frockcoat that was buttoned up beneath it.  He began   to recall their courting along this very walk, his years of penurious  saving to get capital, and the bright hopefulness of his marrying days.   For it all to work out like this! Was there no sympathetic ruler   anywhere in the world? He reverted to death as a topic.  

He thought of the canal he had just crossed, and doubted whether  he shouldn't stand with his head out, even in the middle, and it was  while drowning was in his mind that the purple pileus caught his  eye.  He looked at it mechanically for a moment, and stopped and  stooped towards it to pick it up, under the impression that it was  some such small leather object as a purse.  Then he saw that it was  the purple top of a fungus, a peculiarly poisonous-looking purple:  slimy, shiny, and emitting a sour odour.  He hesitated with his hand  an inch or so from it, and the thought of poison crossed his mind.         With that he picked the thing, and stood up again with it in his  hand.  

The odour was certainly strong—acrid, but by no means disgusting.   He broke off a piece, and the fresh surface was a creamy white, that  changed like magic in the space of ten seconds to a yellowish-green  colour.  It was even an inviting-looking change.  He broke off two  other pieces to see it repeated.  They were wonderful things, these  fungi, thought Mr. Coombes, and all of them the deadliest poisons,  as his father had often told him.  Deadly poisons!  

There is no time like the present for a rash resolve.  Why not here  and now? thought Mr. Coombes.  He tasted a little piece, a very  little piece indeed—a mere crumb.  It was so pungent that he almost  spat it out again, then merely hot and full-flavoured,—a kind of  German mustard with a touch of horse-radish and—well, mushroom.   He swallowed it in the excitement of the moment.  Did he like it  or did he not? His mind was curiously careless.  He would try another  bit.  It really wasn't bad—it was good.  He forgot his troubles in the  interest of the immediate moment.  Playing with death it was.  He took  another bite, and then deliberately finished a mouthful.  A curious  tingling sensation began in his finger-tips and toes.  His pulse began  to move faster.  The blood in his ears sounded like a millrace.  "Try  bi' more," said Mr. Coombes.  He turned and looked about him, and  found his feet unsteady.  He saw and struggled towards a little patch  of purple a dozen yards away.  "Jol' goo' stuff," said Mr. Coombes.  "E—lomore ye'" He pitched forward and fell on his face, his hands   outstretched towards the cluster of pilei.  But he did not eat any more  of them.  He forgot forthwith.  

He rolled over and sat up with a look of astonishment on his  face.  His carefully brushed silk hat had rolled away towards the ditch.   He pressed his hand to his brow.  Something had happened, but he  could not rightly determine what it was.  Anyhow, he was no longer  dull—he felt bright, cheerful.  And his throat was afire.  He laughed  in the sudden gaiety of his heart.  Had he been dull? He did not  know; but at any rate he would be dull no longer.  He got up and  stood unsteadily, regarding the universe with an agreeable smile.  He  began to remember.  He could not remember very well, because of a  steam roundabout that was beginning in his head.  And he knew he  had been disagreeable at home, just because they wanted to be happy.   They were quite right; life should be as gay as possible.  He would  go home and make it up, and reassure them.  And why not take some  of this delightful toadstool with him, for them to eat? A hatful, no  less.  Some of those red ones with white spots as well, and a few  yellow.  He had been a dull dog, an enemy to merriment; he would         make up for it.  It would be gay to turn his coat-sleeves inside out,  and stick some yellow gorse into his waist-coat pockets.  Then home—  singing—for a jolly evening.  

After the departure of Mr. Coombes, Jennie discontinued playing,  and turned round on the music-stool again.  "What a fuss about  nothing," said Jennie.  

"You see, Mr. Clarence, what I've got to put up with," said Mrs.  Coombes.  

"He is a bit hasty," said Mr. Clarence, judicially.  

"He ain't got the slightest sense of our position," said Mrs. Coombes;  "that's what I complain of.  He cares for nothing but his old shop;  and if I have a bit of company, or buy anything to keep myself decent,  or get any little thing I want out of the housekeeping money, there's  disagreeables.  'Economy,' he says; 'struggle for life,' and all that.  He  lies awake of nights about it, worrying how he can screw me out of  a shilling.  He wanted us to eat Dorset butter once.  If once I was  to give in to him—there!"  

"Of course," said Jennie.  

"If a man values a woman," said Mr. Clarence, lounging back in  the arm-chair, "he must be prepared to make sacrifices for her.  For  my own part," said Mr. Clarence, with his eye on Jennie, "I shouldn't  think of marrying till I was in a position to do the thing in style.   It's downright selfishness.  A man ought to go through the rough-and-tumble by himself, and not drag her—"  

"I don't agree altogether with that," said Jennie.  "I don't see why  a man shouldn't have a woman's help, provided he doesn't treat her  meanly, you know.  It's meanness—"  

"You wouldn't believe," said Mrs. Coombes.  "But I was a fool to  'ave 'im.  I might 'ave known.  If it 'adn't been for my father, we  shouldn't have had not a carriage to our wedding."  

"Lord! he didn't stick out at that?" said Mr. Clarence, quite shocked.  

"Said he wanted the money for his stock; or some such rubbish.   Why, he wouldn't have a woman in to help me once a week if it  wasn't for my standing out plucky.  And the fusses he makes about  money—comes to me, well pretty near crying, with sheets of paper  and figgers.  'If only we can tide over this year,' he says, 'the business  is bound to go.' 'If only we can tide over this year,' I says; 'then  it'll be, if only we can tide over next year.  I know you,' I says.  'And  you don't catch me screwing myself lean and ugly.  Why didn't you  marry a slavey,' I says, 'if you wanted one—instead of a respectable  girl?' I says."  

So Mrs. Coombes.  But we will not follow this unedifying   conversation       further.  Suffice it that Mr. Coombes was very satisfactorily disposed   of, and they had a snug little time round the fire.  Then Mrs.  Coombes went to get the tea, and Jennie sat coquettishly on the  arm of Mr. Clarence's chair until the tea-things clattered outside.   "What was that I heard?" asked Mrs. Coombes, playfully, as she  entered, and there was badinage about kissing.  They were just sitting  down to the little circular table when the first intimation of Mr.  Coombes' return was heard.  

This was a fumbling at the latch of the front door.  

"'Ere's my lord," said Mrs. Coombes.  "Went out like a lion and  comes back like a lamb, I'll lay."  

Something fell over in the shop: a chair, it sounded like.  Then  there was a sound as of some complicated step exercise in the   passage.  Then the door opened and Coombes appeared.  But it was  Coombes transfigured.  The immaculate collar had been torn carelessly  from his throat.  His carefully-brushed silk hat, half-full of a crush  of fungi, was under one arm; his coat was inside out, and his   waist-coat adorned with bunches of yellow-blossomed furze.  These little  eccentricities of Sunday costume, however, were quite overshadowed  by the change in his face; it was livid white, his eyes were unnaturally  large and bright, and his pale blue lips were drawn back in a cheerless  grin.  "Merry!" he said.  He had stopped dancing to open the door.   "Rational 'njoyment.  Dance." He made three fantastic steps into  the room, and stood bowing.  

"Jim!" shrieked Mrs. Coombes, and Mr. Clarence sat petrified,  with a dropping lower jaw.  

"Tea," said Mr. Coombes.  "Jol' thing, tea.  Tose-stools, too.  Brosher."  

"He's drunk," said Jennie, in a weak voice.  Never before had she  seen this intense pallor in a drunken man, or such shining, dilated  eyes.  

Mr. Coombes held out a handful of scarlet agario to Mr. Clarence.   "Jo' stuff," said he; "ta' some."  

At that moment he was genial.  Then at the sight of their startled  faces he charged, with the swift transition of insanity, into   overbearing fury.  And it seemed as if he had suddenly recalled the quarrel  of his departure.  In such a huge voice as Mrs. Coombes had never  heard before, he shouted, "My house.  I'm master 'ere.  Eat what I give  yer!" He bawled this, as it seemed, without an effort, without a violent  gesture, standing there as motionless as one who whispers, holding  out a handful of fungus.  

Clarence approved himself a coward.  He could not meet the mad  fury in Coombes' eyes; he rose to his feet, pushing back his chair,  and turned, stooping.  At that Coombes rushed at him.  Jennie saw         her opportunity, and, with the ghost of a shriek, made for the door.   Mrs. Coombes followed her.  Clarence tried to dodge.  Over went the  tea-table with a smash as Coombes clutched him by the collar and  tried to thrust the fungus into his mouth.  Clarence was content to  leave his collar behind him, and shot out into the passage with red  patches of fly agaric still adherent to his face.  "Shut 'im in!" cried  Mrs. Coombes, and would have closed the door, but her supports  deserted her; Jennie saw the shop-door open and vanished thereby,  locking it behind her, while Clarence went on hastily into the  kitchen.  Mr. Coombes came heavily against the door, and Mrs.  Coombes, finding the key was inside, fled upstairs and locked herself  in the spare bedroom.  

So the new convert to joie de vivre emerged upon the passage,  his decorations a little scattered, but that respectable hatful of fungi  still under his arm.  He hesitated at the three ways, and decided on  the kitchen.  Whereupon Clarence, who was fumbling with the key,  gave up the attempt to imprison his host, and fled into the scullery,  only to be captured before he could open the door into the yard.   Mr. Clarence is singularly reticent of the details of what occurred.   It seems that Mr. Coombes' transitory irritation had vanished again,  and he was once more a genial playfellow.  And as there were knives  and meat-choppers about, Clarence very generously resolved to humour  him and so avoid anything tragic.  It is beyond dispute that Mr.  Coombes played with Mr. Clarence to his heart's content; they could  not have been more playful and familiar if they had known each  other for years.  He insisted gaily on Clarence trying the fungi, and  after a friendly tussle, was smitten with remorse at the mess he was  making of his guest's face.  It also appears that Clarence was dragged  under the sink and his face scrubbed with the blacking-brush,—he  being still resolved to humour the lunatic at any cost,—and that  finally, in a somewhat dishevelled, chipped, and discoloured condition,  he was assisted to his coat and shown out by the back door, the  shopway being barred by Jennie.  Mr. Coombes' wandering thoughts  then turned to Jennie.  Jennie had been unable to unfasten the shop-door, but she shot the bolts against Mr. Coombes' latch-key, and   remained in possession of the shop for the rest of the evening.  It would appear that Mr. Coombes then returned to the kitchen,  still in pursuit of gaiety, and, albeit a strict Good Templar, drank  (or spilt down the front of the first and only frock-coat) no less than  five bottles of the stout Mrs. Coombes insisted upon having for her  health's sake.  He made cheerful noises by breaking off the necks  of the bottle with several of his wife's wedding-present dinner-plates,  and during the earlier part of this great drunk he sang divers merry         ballads. He cut his finger rather badly with one of the bottles,—the  only bloodshed in this story,—and what with that, and the systematic  convulsion of his inexperienced physiology by the liquorish brand of  Mrs. Coombes' stout, it may be the evil of the fungus poison was  somehow allayed.  But we prefer to draw a veil over the concluding  incidents of this Sunday afternoon.  They ended in the coal cellar,  in a deep and healing sleep.    

An interval of five years elapsed.  Again it was a Sunday afternoon  in October, and again Mr. Coombes walked through the pinewood  beyond the canal.  He was still the same dark-eyed, black-moustached  little man that he was at the outset of the story, but his double chin  was now scarcely so illusory as it had been.  His overcoat was new,  with a velvet lapel, and a stylish collar with turndown corners, free  of any coarse starchiness, had replaced the original all-round article.   His hat was glossy, his gloves newish—though one finger had split and  been carefully mended.  And a casual observer would have noticed  about him a certain rectitude of bearing, a certain erectness of head  that marks the man who thinks well of himself.  He was a master  now, with three assistants.  Beside him walked a larger sunburnt   parody of himself, his brother Tom, just back from Australia.  They were  recapitulating their early struggles, and Mr. Coombes had just been  making a financial statement.  

"It's a very nice little business, Jim," said brother Tom.  "In these  days of competition you're jolly lucky to have worked it up so.  And  you're jolly lucky, too, to have a wife who's willing to help like yours  does."  

"Between ourselves, said Mr. Coombes, "it wasn't always so.  It  wasn't always like this.  To begin with, the missus was a bit giddy.   Girls are funny creatures."  

"Dear me!"  

"Yes.  You'd hardly think it, but she was downright extravagant,  and always having slaps at me.  I was a bit too easy and loving, and  all that, and she thought the whole blessed show was run for her.   Turned the 'ouse into a regular caravansary, always having her   relations and girls from business in, and their chaps.  Comic songs a'  Sunday, it was getting to, and driving trade away.  And she was  making eyes at the chaps, too! I tell you, Tom, the place wasn't my  own."  

"Shouldn't 'a' thought it."  

"It was so.  Well—I reasoned with her.  I said, 'I ain't a duke, to keep  a wife like a pet animal.  I married you for 'elp and company.' I  said, 'You got to 'elp and pull the business through.' She wouldn't 'ear         of it.  'Very well,' I says; 'I'm a mild man till I'm roused,' I says, 'and  it's getting to that.' But she wouldn't 'ear of no warnings."  

"Well?"  

"It's the way with women.  She didn't think I 'ad it in me to be  roused.  Women of her sort (between ourselves, Tom) don't respect a  man until they're a bit afraid of him.  So I just broke out to show her.   In comes a girl named Jennie, that used to work with her, and her  chap.  We 'ad a bit of a row, and I came out 'ere—it was just such  another day as this—and I thought it all out.  Then I went back and  pitched into them."  

"You did?"  

"I did.  I was mad, I can tell you.  I wasn't going to 'it 'er, if I  could 'elp it, so I went back and licked into this chap, just to show  'er what I could do.  'E was a big chap, too.  Well, I chucked him, and  smashed things about, and gave 'er a scaring, and she ran up and  locked 'erself into the spare room."  

"Well?"  

"That's all.  I says to 'er the next morning, "Now you know,' I  says, "what I'm like when I'm roused.' And I didn't 'ave to say anything  more."  

"And you've been happy ever after, eh?"  

"So to speak.  There's nothing like putting your foot down with  them.  If it 'adn't been for that afternoon I should 'a' been tramping  the roads now, and she'd 'a' been grumbling at me, and all her  family grumbling for bringing her to poverty—I know their little  ways.  But we're all right now.  And it's a very decent little business,  as you say."  

They proceed on their way meditatively.  "Women are funny   creatures," said brother Tom.  

"They want a firm hand," says Coombes.  

'What a lot of these funguses there are about here!" remarked  brother Tom, presently.  "I can't see what use they are in the world."  

Mr. Coombes looked.  "I dessay they're sent for some wise purpose,  said Mr. Coombes.  

And that was as much thanks as the purple pileus ever got for  maddening this absurd little man to the pitch of decisive action, and  so altering the whole course of his life.
