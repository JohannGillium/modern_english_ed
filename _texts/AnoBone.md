  				*Interlocutor.* What are you thinking about, Mr. Bones? What 					is there on your mind this evening?

  				*Bones.* I was jis' thinking 'bout dat business I was in 					some time ago. I started in de â€” what you call dat business dat da hab 					free balls hanging out?

  				*Interlocutor.* Oh, you mean the pawnbroker.

  				*Bones.* Yes, I was a pawnbroker wen I went in de bis, but I 					was a dead broaker wen I came out.

  				*Interlocutor.* Let us hear of your experience as a 					pawnbroker.

  				*Bones.* Well, having nofing to do I fout I'd start de 					broaking business; so I rented a room, got free balls what I found laying around 					loose in a ten pin alley, and hung 'em out.

  				*Interlocutor.* And what success did you have?

  				*Bones.* I'll tell you. De fust man dat cum in had a big 					paper bundel under his arm; he looked all around, den begin to open de bundel, 					den he look all around agin.

  				 				*Interlocutor.* He was suspicious, I suspect.

  				*Bones.* Spec he was. At las' he open de bundel and took out 					a ole hammer, an' wanted two dollars on it.

  				*Interlocutor.* And what did you do about it then?

  				*Bones* Hammered him over de head wid a club. De next one 					dat come in was a Dutchman, wid a big hunk of Limburger cheese in his hand. He 					wanted to pawn it.

  				*Interlocutor.* What did you tell him?

  				*Bones.* Told him to "cheese it" an' go. And de next man had 					a push cart.

  				*Interlocutor.* A push cart! What did he want to do with 					that?

  				*Bones.* Wanted to pawn it; it was all broke, and he wanted 					'nuf on it to get a new one.

  				*Interlocutor.* What did you do with him?

  				*Bones.* Took him up on de roof, put him in de cart, an' 					pushed him off. De nex' man had he leg ob a stove.

  				*Interlocutor.* A leg of a stove! What did he want to do 					with that?

  				*Bones.* Wanted to pawn it.

  				*Interlocutor.* Wanted to pawn the leg of a stove? What did 					you do with him?

  				*Bones* Stove in his plug hat wid it. De nex' man dat come 					in was a woming.

  				*Interlocutor.* A lady, sir. And what did *she* want?

  				*Bones.* Wanted to pawn dem, an' he wanted nuf on dem 					fourteen ole suits to buy seven new suits.

  				*Interlocutor.* What is that? Do I hear right? He wanted 					enough on the fourteen old suits to buy seven new suits?

  				*Bones.* Dat's it.

  				*Interlocutor.* And what conclusion did you come to in 					regard to the clothes?

  				*Bones.* I concluded to close up shop, an' I did so, an' 				never ben in de biz sence.

 			  		 		 			  				Here are the two conversations between Jim and Huck that seem most clearly to 					echo these kinds of routines. Of course, these are not the only kinds of 					conversations the two runaways have, but they are the parts of the novel that MT 					first took with him on the "Twins of Genius" tour with Cable, and they helped 					shape the contemporary public's perception of the novel. Apparently when Richard 					Gilder heard MT perform Jim's account of his speculations and his diatribe 					against King Solomon, he talked MT into letting him publish additional 					installments of the novel in his *Century Magazine*. These 					colloquys not only made up the entire installment that appeared in the January 					issue of the *Century*; the punchline of Jim's account of 					his "speculatin'" was changed to make it sound even more like a minstrel show routine (see Prepublishing Huck):
