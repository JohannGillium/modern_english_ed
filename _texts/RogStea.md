# I

  Randolph Crosby's philosophy of life forbade his feeling or  expressing emotion, except for the slender, fair-haired girl who  stood beside him, and who had in a measure taken the place of the  wife whose memory she perpetuated.  Nevertheless, the sight of  the thoroughbreds as they filed past the club enclosure, their  jockeys perching like monkeys on their glossy backs, made the  muscles of his throat contract a little.  

Excitement was an almost forgotten sensation for this man who  had won as many as seven races in a day with horses he had bred  and trained himself.  It gave him a pleasurable feeling that  youth, with all its joys and enthusiasms, was not irrevocably  gone.  

"Steadfast looks in the pink of condition," remarked a tall  man standing beside him, and sufficiently like him to proclaim  their relationship.  

George Crosby was tall and straight like his brother, with  the erect, easy carriage for which the family had long been  noted.  It was in the expression of eye and mouth that the main  points of difference lay.  George's eyes were heavy, with thick  lids which gave them a languid, rather tired look, and dark-blue  shadows encircled them.  His lips were full, and drooped a little  at the corners.  

Randolph's eyes, on the contrary, looked out of an impassive,  almost cynical face with the cold, critical gaze of one who for  half a century had lived hard and, at times, fast.  In his desire  to experience every sensation that life could offer, he might  have followed paths that were shadowed and devious; but through  it all he had carried a sense of responsibility to the code of  his ancestors   —   "Play the game for all it's worth, but play it  square!"  

George, the younger of the brothers, maintained that  Randolph's feeling in regard to family tradition was an  obsession.  

"Your Uncle Randolph's a bit dotty on the subject, Norman,"  he had remarked to his son one evening, in the confidence of an  after-dinner chat, a slight sneer curling the corners of his  lips.  "Leans over backward when it comes to a point of what he  calls honor.  Personally, I don't see what difference it makes to  the family tree."  

Norman had replied ruefully:  

"Wish I had a thousand dollars for each of the dusty old  codgers!  It would come close to getting me out of debt."  

His father had eyed the dissipated young face sharply.  

"Just the same, don't hit it up too hard, my son.  The  paternal exchequer has its limitations, you know, and your dad  isn't too old to want some of the good things of life himself!"  

And Norman had laughed, and said he wouldn't.     

He was standing beside his father now, watching the horses  with a strained look on his white face.  

"Pat says he's in perfect shape," replied Randolph Crosby, in  answer to his brother's remark.  

His keen eyes softened as they lingered on the horse who  hitherto had always carried his colors to victory.  

"Are you backing him?" asked George, glancing at the card he  held in his hand.  

His brother nodded.  

"Went in rather deep this time.  It looks like such a sure  thing.  The odds are pretty heavy, and you have to plunge a bit  to make it worth while."  

He turned to listen to his daughter, who was calling his  attention to one of the other horses.  

"Dad!" said Norman in a low voice, from which he could not  entirely exclude the excitement he evidently felt.  "Steadfast  isn't going to win!"  

His father glanced at him quickly, his heavy eyes narrowing  as he concentrated his attention on Norman's subdued tone.  

"I've just left the stable," Norman went on; "and I tell you,  Steadfast is *not* going to win!"  

George Crosby scrutinized his son's face for a moment in  silence.  Then they moved quietly toward a thick-set man, with a  diamond horseshoe pin in his vivid tie, who was standing on the  outskirts of the crowd.  

A short, faultlessly dressed man with a military carriage put  his hand on Randolph Crosby's shoulder.  

"Steadfast going to win, Rand?" he asked in a well-modulated  voice.  

Randolph Crosby lowered the glasses through which he had been  following the string of horses as they moved'slowly up the  stretch, and turned toward the speaker.  

"Hope so, I'm sure, Tod," he answered.  

Major Barry smiled at him affectionately.  

"Advise my staking half my pay on him?" he asked.  

Crosby smiled back at him half seriously.  

"Betsy," he said, turning to his daughter, read your  godfather a lecture.  He's on the verge of succumbing to  temptation!"  

Elizabeth turned, her bright face illumined by the smile  which Major Barry always said made you feel that all nature had  suddenly burst into song, and shook her finger at him.  

"Really," she exclaimed, "if you boys don't behave, I shall  have to take you home!  It's bad enough having one of my fathers  plunging heavily; but if you both do, and Steadfast should lose,  who is going to keep me supplied with gardenias?"  

"Horrors!"  Major Barry raised his eyebrows in exaggerated  concern.  "What a ghastly suggestion!  I shall most certainly  refrain!"  

With a laugh, he walked away with his light, springy step.  

Randolph Crosby raised his glasses to his eyes and fixed them  on the shifting group of horses on the far side of the green  oval.  His hand was not as steady as usual as he readjusted the  lenses, but it was in an even, perfectly controlled voice that he  said "They're off!" as the barrier was sprung.  

The words were taken up by the people in the grand stand on  the other side of the railing, and simultaneously the crowd rose  to its feet.  

"Steadfast leads!  Steadfast leads!" came an exultant chorus  of voices.  

The horse had been a consistent winner ever since the season  opened, and consequently was high in popular favor.  His capture  of the richest stake of the year was taken almost as a foregone  conclusion, and a great crowd had turned out to see the race and  to bring home its share of the proceeds.  

The horses swept into the home-stretch with Steadfast well in  the van.  It looked as if the race was over, and Randolph Crosby  was about to lower his glasses when he saw Steadfast falter.  

It was only for a second.  The boy on the horse's back  tightened the rein, and then gave him his head; but in that  second before Steadfast regained his stride, Pursuit, who had  been playing second to him all the year, and now was following  close on his heels, gained perceptibly.  His nose crept up until  it was outlined against Steadfast's quarter.  Then it blotted out  Pat's white leg, and then it reached the band on the bridle.  

"What's wrong with Steadfast?"  

The question flashed through Randolph Crosby's mind.  Certainly there was a marked difference in his running.  It was  labored, forced, quite unlike the easy swing that had made him  famous.  

"Pursuit!  Pursuit!"  

The cry broke in upon him in an agony of apprehension as the  horses swept by the grand stand.   Pat was riding far forward,   urging Steadfast with hand and voice, and the jockey on  Pursuit's back was whipping his mount briskly.  

"Give Steadfast the whip!  The whip!" shouted the crowd in a  frenzy of excitement; but Pat did not heed them, and the horses  passed the judges' stand with Pursuit's nose a foot to the fore.  

An angry tumult of disappointment surged over the crowd.  Randolph Crosby's keen eyes were fixed on Pat's white face as he  trotted back to the weighing-stand.  As the jockey raised his  whip, Crosby's breath escaped through his lips in a little sigh,  as if insensibly he had been holding it in expectation of  something, he did not know quite what.  

The fair girl beside him turned her sweet, troubled face to  him.  

"Oh, father!" she exclaimed, her blue eyes limpid with  sympathy.  "I'm so sorry!"  

"All in the day's work, Betsy!" he answered with an attempt  at gaiety, looking fondly at her.  "Can't always win!  That would  be monotonous.  I think I'll go and speak to Pat; he looks a bit  cut up."  

He strolled off through the brightly colored groups scattered  over the lawn.  Elizabeth turned to the tall man beside her.  

"Poor dad!" she said.  "He *is* disappointed!  He idolizes  that horse, and I can see it has really hurt him to have him  beaten."  

"It's too bad!  I am sorry!" returned Fairfax Cary, with a  regretful glance at the erect gray head disappearing into the  crowd.  "Steadfast is a great horse, but   —   "  

"You thought so, too!" exclaimed Elizabeth, with a quick  glance at the clean-cut profile.  "I didn't want to say anything  to father, but"   —   she looked inquiringly into the gray eyes fixed  intently on her face   —   it seemed to me   —   "  

She stopped abruptly, and the delicate color slowly deepened  in her cheeks.  

"You're looking very lovely this afternoon," said Cary in a  low voice.  "I've been wanting to tell you so for two hours, but  there's always such a crowd around you!"  

Elizabeth laughed a little tremulously.  

"What a relief it must be to get it off your mind at last!"  she flashed back at him, with a look from under the broad brim of  her hat that made the expression in his eyes deepen dangerously.  

"It is," he assented seriously.  "That's a perfectly new  dimple you've developed just under your right eye.  How dare you  spring anything so distractingly   —   "  

"Where's your father, Elizabeth?" asked a full voice at the  girl's elbow.  

Elizabeth turned quickly and looked into the handsome,  carefully penciled face beside her, whose prominent eyes were  staring disapprovingly at Cary's lean, brown countenance.  

"Oh, Aunt Maude, is it you?  Father went to the stables to  speak to Pat.  He knew the boy would be heart-broken.  You  remember Mr. Cary?"  

She had introduced them numberless times before, but it  always seemed to be necessary to repeat the formality.  She had  adopted the habit of doing it immediately, in order to take away  as much strain as possible from a situation which was always  difficult when the two were together.  

Cary raised his hat with the quizzical look in his eyes that  Elizabeth had learned to expect, and bowed with an almost  imperceptible exaggeration of his usual courtly manner.  

Mrs. Crosby acknowledged the salutation mechanically, her  full eyes wandering indifferently past him.  

"Pat's not the only one who is heartbroken," she retorted  abruptly.  "Practically every one was backing Steadfast, and I  know several people who have been pretty hard hit."  The thin  line of her mouth hardened.  She herself had lost more than she  could afford on the race, and she was looking for some one on  whom to lay the blame.  "How about you, Mr. Cary?" she went on,  the vaguest suggestion of a sneer in the throaty voice.  "Or  don't you ever bet?"  

"Not often, Mrs. Crosby," answered Cary calmly.  "In the  first place, I can't afford to lose; in the second, I don't  follow the races closely enough to form an intelligent opinion on  the relative merits of the horses."  

Mrs. Crosby laughed a little unpleasantly.  

"Then it is something besides the horses that brings you  here?" she asked meaningly.  

A slight flush spread over Cary's sensitive face, and the  firm line of his chin stiffened.  

"Oh, don't put me  quite outside the pale," he answered  lightly.  "You know we Virginians love a good horse, and a race  is an inspiring sight, even to one who has never been in a  position to follow the sport   —   or  any other, for that  matter," he added whimsically, with a side glance at Elizabeth.  

She returned his look with a smile that caused Mrs. Crosby to  hunch her plump shoulders uncomfortably as she realized her  mistake.  

Fairfax Cary had left the family estate in the Shenandoah  Valley ten years before, and had come to New York with little  besides the clothes on his back, and practically nothing in them.  He had met Randolph Crosby in the settlement of an estate against  which Crosby had a claim.  Struck by the young man's ability,  Crosby had employed him in several minor cases of his own.  Gradually social intercourse had developed from business  relations, until Fairfax Cary became an acknowledged friend of  the family, and was in frequent attendance on Elizabeth.  

The intimacy had increased so fast that.  Mrs. Crosby had  undertaken to remonstrate with her brother-in-law one afternoon  when he had dropped in to tea.  

"Good Heavens, Maude!" he had retorted impatiently.  "The  girl isn't going to marry every man who takes her in to dinner!"  

"No, Randolph," answered Mrs. Crosby in the long-suffering  way that some women adopt when they feel that the men of their  family are deliberately obtuse.  "Of course not; but she's going  to marry one of them, and you know how easy it is to make a  mistake.  A girl with Elizabeth's prospects is very attractive,  especially to a man with none."  

"I don't agree with you that Cary has no prospects.  He's a  very able chap, and as straight as a string."  

Mrs. Crosby had raised her penciled eyebrows slightly.  

"Perhaps," she agreed unwillingly, "from a man's standpoint,  he may"   —   there was the faintest possible emphasis on the word   —     "be all that is desirable; but I'm sure, if Helen had lived, she  would have agreed with me that Elizabeth is too rare a girl to be  thrown away on an unknown."  

A slight quiver had passed over Randolph Crosby's face at the  mention of his wife's name.  For a moment he was silent, then he  said:  

"Better not call Fairfax Cary an unknown in Virginia!"  

Mrs. Crosby had shrugged her shoulders.  

"Virginia is not New York.  If you want Elizabeth to bury  herself in the country, why, of course, I have nothing to say."  She paused, then she added in a lowered voice:  "You know I've  always felt that I must take as far as I can her mother's place  to Elizabeth, and I can't see her sacrifice herself without a  word of protest.  I love the girl as dearly as if she were the  daughter who was denied to me."  

She raised a lace-trimmed handkerchief and dabbed her eyes  carefully.  

"Awfully good of you, Maude, I'm sure," replied Crosby,  uneasily moving his neatly incased foot.  "But I don't think we  need either of us worry about Elizabeth.  She's as level-headed a  young woman as I know, and when she makes up that mind of hers"   —     he looked whimsically at his sister-in-law, a smile, half of  pride, half of helplessness, spreading over his face   —   "I don't  think there's any power in heaven or on earth that will move  her!"  

Mrs. Crosby had spread out her plump, jeweled fingers and  raised her eyebrows meaningly, indicating that at least she had  done her duty, and the rest lay with him.  

She turned now to greet her husband and son as they emerged  from the throng about them.  There was an intangible atmosphere  of elation about them, and Norman's face was flushed.  

"Too bad, Betty," he remarked in a rather thick voice to his  cousin.  "Beastly hard luck!  Uncle Randolph's disappointed, I  guess   —   what?  Great race, though!"  

He pushed back his straw hat from his damp forehead, and  taking out his cigarette-case, offered it to Cary with a, hand  that shook perceptibly.  When Fairfax declined, he took out a  cigarette, struck the end of it once or twice on the gold lid,  lit it, and placed it between his loose lips.  

"A lot of money changed hands," he remarked confidentially to  Cary, his bloodshot eyes glistening.  

The lines of the other man's face hardened, and unconsciously  he drew himself up.  Turning to Elizabeth, he asked, in an  undertone that excluded the others, if she would care to go to  the paddock.  

Elizabeth glanced at him in quick gratitude, and after a few  words of explanation to her aunt they moved away.  

Randolph Crosby, in the mean time, had succeeded in making  his way through the groups of well-dressed men and women who,  eager to sympathize with him and hear his  explanation of the  defeat, were impeding his progress to the stable.  When he  reached his destination, he found Pat watching Jim, the  stable-boy, who was rubbing Steadfast down.  The boy's angry face  was flushed, and a white line encircled his mouth.  

"I tell ye it wa'n't no put-up game!" he was saying hotly to  another boy, who sat on the bottom of an overturned pail.  "I  rode a straight race!  What do ye take me fer, ye miserable  tout?"  

He turned threateningly toward the other.  The sneer that met  him seemed to drive away his last vestige of self-control.  Shaking his fist in the other boy's face, his little figure  trembling with rage, Pat shouted:  

"Ye're a low-mouthed, dirty, snivelin' liar, an' ye know  ye're lyin'   —   "  He stopped abruptly as his eyes fell on his  employer.  

"Well, Pat," remarked Mr. Crosby quietly, watching with a  half smile his jockey's tormentor as he slipped hastily away,  what's it all about?"  

The boy struggled vainly to regain his self-control.  

"The miserable, rotten little kike   —   "  

"Yes, yes," broke in Mr. Crosby coolly.  "Leave all that  out!"  

Pat raised his working face and looked full into the dark  eyes that somehow seemed to have lost their cynical expression.  

"He said I pulled Steadfast!" he exclaimed.  "Said I lost on  purpose!"  

He turned away abruptly and laid his hand, as if to steady  himself, on the horse's deep-breathing side.  

"The dirty hound!" he muttered under his breath.  "An' me  with every cart-wheel I could scrape together on the hoss!  If he knowed what that race meant to me!"  

Again Pat stopped, his voice trembling.  

"Ye don't risk what ye've been workin' fer since ye wuz a  kid, scrimpin' an' screwin' so as ye kin hev a place ter put yer  sister where she'll be safe from that"   —   his eyes glanced  significantly to the paddock, where flashily dressed men loitered  about the horses, discoursing on their points to the painted  women who accompanied them   —   It unless ye've got a dead-sure  thing.  It ain't no fault o' mine that Steadfast didn't win that  race   —   ye know that, don't ye, Mr. Crosby?"  

He drove his hands into the pockets of his breeches and  looked appealingly into the older man's face.  Mr. Crosby nodded.  

"Why did Steadfast lose, Pat?" he asked gravely.  

Pat shifted his position uneasily.  

"I dunno, sir   —   I swear I don't.  The hoss wuz goin' like a  bunch o' machinery, an' I thought I had the race won; an' then  all ter once I feels him give, sudden like, just like somethin'  inside him had broke down.  I done my best, but he'd lost his  spring, an' I knowed then he couldn't win; but what the matter  wuz   —   "  The boy shook his head despondently.  "Did ye hear the  crowd yellin' at me to give him the whip?  *Steadfast!*  Can ye  beat that?  Lot they know about hosses!"  Pat's voice was  brimming with scorn as he ran his hand over the animal's glossy  neck.  "Why, it would ha' broke his heart!"  

The horse turned his head and, fastening his great, velvety  eyes on the boy, laid his muzzle on Pat's shoulder.  The boy hid  his face quickly in the horse's mane, but not in time to prevent  Crosby's seeing the pitifully quivering chin.  For a moment all  that broke the silence was the stamping of the other horses in  their stalls and the far-off throb of the band.  

"Pat!" said Mr. Crosby at last.  "Come here, my lad   —   I want  to ask you a question."  They drew a little apart until they were  quite alone.  "Could any one have got at Steadfast?"  

The question was almost inaudible, but the jockey's sharp  ears caught it, and he shook his head in vehement denial.  

"I ain't lef' him day or night, Mr. Crosby," he answered  quickly.  "I even slep' In the stall   —   an' when I had ter go and  change me togs I lef' Mr. Norman an' Molly with him.  Surely he  couldn't ha' been no safer?"  

The lad looked interrogatively at his employer.  Mr. Crosby  shook his head, and after telling Pat not to worry any more about  the race, and giving him some instructions for the following day,  he walked back toward the clubhouse.  

As he passed the paddock a short, stocky man in a check suit  came toward him.  His deep-set eyes brightened as they caught  sight of Randolph Crosby, and he stretched out a thick, muscular  hand adorned with a large cameo ring.  

"How-do, Mr. Crosby?  How are you?" he asked, taking an  enormous unlighted cigar out of his mouth.  "What was wrong with  Steadfast?"     

His keen black eyes, under their shaggy eyebrows, fixed  themselves penetratingly on Crosby's face.  

Randolph Crosby raised his eyebrows.  

"Nothing, Tutney, as far as I know.  I've just been talking  to Pat.  He says the horse was in perfect shape until the middle  of the race; then he seemed to crumple up.  I can't understand  it."  

Tutney replaced the cigar in his mouth, and twisted it around  and around with his tongue.  The expression on his immovable face  never changed.  

"Were you backin' him?" he asked bluntly,  

Crosby nodded.  

"That race cost me quite a lot of money," he replied quietly.  " The odds were heavy, and it was a good purse."  

Tutney grunted.  

"Thought they were wrong!"  

"What do you mean?"  

The stocky man shifted his weight from one white-gaitered  foot to the other and gave the cigar another twist.  

"Oh, just some remarks I overheard.  Crowd's pretty sore   —     always is when it loses!"  

"What did you hear?" said Crosby, looking sharply at the  other.  

Tutney hesitated, and Crosby repeated his question in a  quiet, cold voice.  

"Why, they were sayin," the man began, lowering his voice,  "that the Crosbys had won a lot of money on the race."  

Crosby stared incredulously at the stolid face.  

"Are they saying that?" he asked in an undertone, as if  speaking to himself.  

Tutney scrutinized the cold, impassive face sharply.  He took  the cigar out of his mouth.  

"Mr. Crosby," he said at last, "you and I have known each  other for ten years   —   eleven, to be exact   —   haven't we?"  

Crosby inclined his head.  

"And we've had a good many deals together of one kind or  another."  Again Tutney waited for the other man's assent.  "And  in that time, in spite of the fact that there were plenty of  chances for shady practise, I want to go on record as sayin'  you're the squarest man I ever met, bar none!"  

He turned abruptly away, as if ashamed of the emotion that  had crept into his voice.  Randolph Crosby's keen eyes softened.  

"Thank you, Tutney," he said quietly.  "That means a great  deal, coming from you."  

He stretched out his hand, and Tutney grasped it firmly.  

"Good-by, Mr. Crosby," he said huskily.  He cleared his  throat loudly.  "I'm off to South Africa to-morrow.  Got to look  after things there a bit.  Let me know if at any time I can be of  service to you."  

Crosby thanked him again, and his eyes followed Tutney with  an expression almost of tenderness as the stocky man disappeared  into the crowd.  Then he resumed his walk toward the club  enclosure.  Unconsciously his shoulders had straightened and his  head gone up.  

At the entrance he saw the Porter Chadwicks, who, with the  Crosbys, had lunched at the clubhouse before the races.  Chadwick glanced in Randolph Crosby's direction and said  something in an undertone to his wife, and they passed quickly  through the wicket.  

A quiet smile played around the corners of Crosby's thin  lips, but the tired, cynical look in his eyes deepened.  He  stepped into the enclosure and almost ran into the arms of  Griswold Peyton, who had been a classmate of his at Harvard, and  was one of his most intimate friends.  Peyton started violently  and turned scarlet.  

"Too   —   too bad   —   about the   —   race, old man!" he stammered.  "Must speak to   —   to   —   Mrs. Phillips.  See you again!"  

He fled precipitately.  A slight frown contracted Crosby's  straight brows, and his lips tightened.  He walked to where  Elizabeth and Cary stood a little apart.  

"Are you ready to go?" he asked his daughter.  "I don't want  to hurry you, but as the races are over   —   "  

"Quite ready," answered Elizabeth.  

She smiled joyously at her father, and her voice seemed  brimming with the silver purity of the hermit-thrush.  She put  her hand through his arm, and they turned to leave the enclosure.  

"Oh, Betsy!"  A dark, vivacious face appeared at her  shoulder.  "I was so afraid you would leave before I had a chance  to speak to you!"  The speaker put out her hand to Randolph  Crosby.  *"So sorry* about the race!"  

"Thank you, Trixie"; and Crosby's hand closed warmly over  hers.     

"Beatrix! Beatrix!  Come here at once!"  

The words came almost in a wail from a small, much-corseted  woman in a purple *crepe de Chine*, heavily trimmed with Cluny  lace.    An expression of anguish shone through the powder on her  horrified face.  

"She only calls me that on occasions of great urgency!"  laughed Trixie.  "I shall have to go; but remember, Betsy   —     you're coming to me at Lawrence for a long visit this summer.  I  won't be put off again!"  

She pressed Elizabeth's hand, and with a nod to the men flew  off to rejoin her mother.  

"Mrs. Hunnewell seems rather upset," remarked Elizabeth  wonderingly.  

"Very much so," replied her father grimly. They started  toward the exit.  "Why, Humphrey!" he exclaimed, and then  stopped.  

A tall, fine-looking man with iron-gray hair and mustache  looked at him coldly and passed without speaking.  

Randolph Crosby's face whitened.  With muscles so tense that  they showed like cords through the skin, he walked to the waiting  automobile.  He stood back for Elizabeth to enter; then he got in  and dropped down beside her.  

"Coming, Fairfax?" he asked in a voice strangely unlike his  own.  "No?  Well, drop in soon.  All right, Foster   —   home, then!"  

He settled back in his corner.  

When the parlor-maid went into the library of the Crosbys'  apartment the next morning and pulled up the shade, the sun fell  full on the figure of Randolph Crosby, sunk deep in his big  armchair.  His head was turned a little to one side, as if trying  to catch a sound that eluded him, and over his lips hovered the  faint shadow of a smile, not cynical or sarcastic, but as if the  pettiness of life and its sordid estimates had passed him by  forever, and he had found again the one who had always  understood.  

      
# II

    Mrs. George Crosby sat at her desk in the morning-room, a  pile of unpaid bills before her and a thin line of worry between  her eyebrows.  An indescribable atmosphere of unrest and  weariness hovered about her, accentuating the traces of wear  which years of struggle had left behind.  The limp folds of her  tea-gown hanging dejectedly around her stressed her dispirited  appearance.  The room, with its worn rug, soiled,  cretonne-upholstered furniture and shabby hangings, seemed to  fasten upon her the imprint of hard usage, as if to revenge  itself for her neglect of it by proclaiming aloud, in the privacy  of the third-floor back, what she fought with desperate  determination to conceal from the critical eyes of the habitues  of her perfectly appointed drawing-room.  

She pushed away the papers petulantly is her husband entered  the room.  

"Really, George," she exclaimed irritably, turning toward  him, "I don't see how I'm going to meet this additional expense!  I've a pile of bills here now that there isn't the least prospect  in the world of my ever being able to pay, and some of the people  are positively uncivil in their demands.  Now, if I have to buy  an entire mourning outfit, I don't see where I'm coming out!"  

She looked at him in angry reproach.  

"Too bad, old girl," returned her husband nonchalantly,  sinking into a deep chair by the window and opening the newspaper  he held.  "But don't blame me   —   it isn't my fault!"  

"Don't be absurd, George!  Of course, Randolph's death isn't  your fault; but I won't go to the length of saying that our being  so strapped isn't!"  Her eyes ran impatiently over his relaxed  figure.  "And I assure you I haven't the slightest intention of  going to Newport this summer without the proper wardrobe.  If I  have to put on mourning   —   and I suppose I must, or people will  talk, and they're doing enough of that as it is   —   it's got to be  of the best.  Cheap mourning is impossible; so you'll have to  arrange to give me some money.  Remember, it's your brother, not  mine!"  

George Crosby lowered his paper irritably.  

"Upon my word, Maude," he exclaimed, "you might show a little  feeling!  The way you're acting is abominable.  One would think  Randolph had died on purpose!"  

"How do you know he didn't?" rejoined his wife with acerbity.  "No one seems to have the faintest idea why he died.  Even the  doctors can't agree.  Half of them say something about his heart,  and the rest talk vaguely about a stroke.  For my part, I think  the disgrace of that Steadfast affair was the cause."  

"You mean?"  

George Crosby gazed intently at his wife's face, haggard and  worn without its customary make-up.     

"Oh, George!  Why do you make me go into details?  You know  as well as I that there was something wrong with the horse on  Thursday, and it was pretty generally suspected that he had been  tampered with.  At all events, I saw some of Randolph's most  intimate friends cut him dead as he was leaving the grounds, and  Randolph was not the sort of man to stand that."  

She looked meaningly into her husband's startled face.  

"Poor old Rand!"  

George Crosby's voice shook.  He turned his heavy eyes toward  the window and stared, unseeing, at the backs of the houses  opposite.  

"It's horrid!  The whole thing is perfectly abominable!"  continued his wife in a tone of extreme exasperation.  "Here I've  gone to the expense of a complete outfit for the summer   —   "  

Her husband jumped to his feet.  

Yes, yes!" he exclaimed irritably.  "I'll get you the money  somehow; but you'll have to make it go as far as possible."  

"Trust me for that!" retorted his wife with a hard little  laugh.  "Years of training have taught me to get as much out of a  dollar as one hundred cents will buy, and maybe a little more,  I'm sick of it!  I'm tired to death of having to plan and scrimp  until even my fingers are beginning to look like claws!"  She  held out her crooked fingers before him.  "How is it that  Randolph had plenty of money and could live like a prince, while  we've always been pinched to the last degree?"  

George Crosby shrugged his shoulders and moved toward the  door.  It was not the first time the question had been put to  him, and it aroused, even now, a feeling of antagonism against  the brother whose inheritance had been the same as his own, but  who had increased his property tenfold, while George's had  steadily dwindled.  

"Perhaps an extravagant wife and son have had something to do  with it!" he flung back over his shoulder as he lingered on the  threshold.  "Well, poor Randolph can't enjoy his pile any more.  What did you decide about Elizabeth?"  

"She's coming to us, of course.  She can't live alone, and if  I have her under my eye I can perhaps keep away undesirables."  

She looked full at her husband, who nodded understandingly.  

"Quite right, Maude; the girl's a catch, and is bound to have  a lot of attention.  Much better to have her here.  Will she go  with you to Newport?"  

"Oh, yes; she needn't go out, and Norman will be there to  amuse her.  I want the boy to take a good long rest this summer;  he looks desperately thin."  

"You can't lay that to overwork! replied her husband with a  short laugh.  Almost the only thing that ever brings him to the  office is the urgent need of funds."  

"Like father, like son!" murmured his mother.  "I never  noticed a deep love of work in you, either!"  

"Maybe not, but my father wasn't so lenient as Norman's is,  and I had to work when I was his age.  You can't blame me for  wanting to take life a bit easy now."  He stretched luxuriously,  and a self-indulgent smile widened the full lips.  "After all,  one only lives once, and at my age there aren't so many years  left to enjoy."  

Mrs. Crosby shuddered.  

I wish you wouldn't everlastingly keep referring to that  extremely unpleasant subject.  It's positively gruesome!  We all  have to die some time, of course, but there's no use in  perpetually harping on the fact."  

Crosby laughed again, lazily.  

"Well, I'm off," he said, turning toward the stairs.  "I want  to get Randolph's affairs straightened out as far as I can before  the hot weather comes."  He paused once more.  "Tell Norman I  expect him at twelve   —   that is, unless it's too early for him," he  added with an exaggerated air of concern.  

But when Norman finally appeared in his father's office,  George Crosby foresaw at once, from the haggardness of the boy's  face, what the interview portended.  These heated scenes had  occurred with increasing frequency since Norman was fifteen, and  were to be dreaded even more than the hardly less stormy  encounters with the boy's mother.  

Norman sank into the deep leather armchair that stood at the  corner of his father's writing-table.  Swinging one leg over the  other, he began nursing his slender, silk-incased ankle.  

"I'm in the devil of a hole, dad!" he began moodily,  

"You always are, aren't you?" retorted his father, with a  scornful look from under his thick eyelids.     

Norman laughed uneasily.  

"More or less," he admitted; "but this time it's no merry  jest!"  

"I have never found it so at any time," returned his father  coldly.  

Norman shifted his position uncomfortably.  His bloodshot  eyes were wandering about the room; finally they came back to his  father's face.  

"I've had hard luck," he began with an effort; "deuced hard  luck."  

"Yes?"  George Crosby's tone was hardly encouraging.  

Norman's eyes dropped to the Turkish rug which covered the  floor.  

"Well, what's the demnition total?" asked his father after a  pause, attempting a facetiousness which the tone of his voice  indicated he was far from feeling.  

"Fifty thousand," said the boy desperately.  

"Fifty thousand!  Good Heavens, boy, are you crazy?"  

George Crosby leaned far out of his chair, his hands gripping  the arms, his wide eyes for once alight, gazing incredulously  into the sullen face before him.  

Norman shook his head resentfully.  

"Not yet, but I soon shall be, if this keeps on!"  

"You   —   *you!"* retorted his father, his face ablaze with  anger.  "You'll have us all, your mother and me included, in the  madhouse or in jail   —   I don't know which!  And it's only yourself  you stop to think of!  Fifty thousand dollars!  Do you realize  what that means to me?"  

The boy's face blanched, and his sullen expression deepened.  

How did it happen?" asked his father in a low voice, which he  was evidently exerting his utmost will-power to control.  

"Playing auction."  

"Auction!  What stake?"  

"Fifty cents."  

"Fifty cents a point?"  An incredulous look stole over George  Crosby's face.  "You say you were playing auction for fifty cents  a *point*?"  Then, as no answer was vouchsafed, he added, as if  to himself:  "Just ten times my limit!"  

For a moment neither spoke.  A tense, living silence wrapped  itself about them, which the monotonous hum of the city booming  in through the open window seemed to accentuate.  

"How do you expect to pay this debt of   —   er   —   honor?" queried  his father at last, a sneer curling the corners of his mouth.  

The boy crouched back in his chair, as if for support, and  raised miserable, hunted eyes to his father's grim face.  

"I don't know, dad," he whispered huskily, "unless   —   "  

"Unless what?"  

Norman swallowed hard.  He roused himself from his  half-reclining position, and his slender figure suddenly became  tense with energy.  

"See here, dad!" he began.  "I've just heard of a wonderful  proposition, perfectly safe, and a dead-sure thing,"  

His father looked at him suspiciously from under lowered  lids.  

"You've told me before of dead-sure things!" he retorted  scornfully.  

"But this one is absolutely on the level," Norman reiterated.  "I happen to know the man who is at the head of it, and he swears  that you would double your money in three months.  What's more,  he proved it to me."  

"How?" asked his father laconically.  

"It's a rubber company, formed to take over the Belgian  interests in the Congo.  At present prices rubber is a veritable  goldmine, and the demand for it is unlimited.  They can't get  enough on the other side, and you know how it's gone up here."  

The color had come back into the boy's face, and his voice  was quick and sharp.  George Crosby eyed him in silence.  

"How much money does he want?" he asked at last.  "Oh, a hundred thousand or so."  

"My Heavens, boy!  You talk as if I were made of money!"  

Norman's eyes dropped from his father's to the writing-table  before which he sat.  It was strewn with papers.  They lingered  there for a moment; then he looked back at his father  significantly.  

"I thought   —   perhaps," he hesitated, "you might   —   be willing to  invest some   —   of   —   Uncle Randolph's money   —   in it."  

George Crosby turned violently toward the boy, who was  tensely awaiting the result of his suggestion.  "Do you realize that that would be a State's prison offense?" he  asked bluntly.  

Norman's white face quivered.  

"It's probably State's prison if you don't!" be retorted  desperately.     

"What do you mean?"  The question came in a harsh voice  strangely unlike George Crosby's usual suave tones.  

"I mean this."  The boy was evidently goaded to desperation.  "I raised the check you gave me for five hundred to fifty  thousand to pay Henry Armstrong, and I gave it to him last  night."  

George Crosby turned slowly back to the writing-table, and  his gray head dropped into his hands.  Lower and lower it sank  until it fell on his outstretched arms, resting on the table.  

Again that black silence folded itself about them.  Once or  twice a deep sigh broke from the bowed figure, and the broad  shoulders shuddered.  

"Good God!"  The words seemed to have been wrung from him in  spite of his efforts at restraint.  "Good God!"  

A frightened look stole over Norman's face.  

"Don't, dad, don't!" he whispered huskily, rising and laying  a shaking hand on the older man's shoulder.  

"Don't touch me!"  His father sprang to his feet, his eyes  blazing, his drawn face working.  "You thief!"  

Norman swayed back as if his father had struck him, and a  look as of an animal at bay crept into his face.  

"You   —   *you* call me   —   that!" he breathed hoarsely.  *"You!*  Why, you don't know the meaning of the word honesty!  Don't talk  to me!"  The words were tumbling out of his mouth in a frenzy of  anger.  "Why, ever since I was a kid I've heard you and mother  planning and arranging how you were going to get out of paying  your bills!  And now *you* call *me* a thief!"  The young man's  voice rose almost to a shriek.  "How do you expect me to be  honest when I've been brought up never to pay for anything unless  I had to?"  

"Silence!"  

George Crosby raised his hand as if to quell the torrent of  words by force, if necessary.  For a moment father and son glared  angrily into each other's face; then, with a catch in his breath  that was almost a sob, the young man's slight figure crumpled up  and fell into the chair behind him.  

His father sank into his armchair, and his face fell forward  on his chest.  His eyes, no longer languid, stared vacantly out  of his strained, white face at the litter of papers before him.    It seemed as if some unseen spirit had cast a spell over him,  robbing him forever of the atmosphere of youth which had long  been the wonder and envy of his friends.  

The consequences of the boy's act loomed dark and sinister  over him; his son's words stung him with unanswerable force.  

 He passed his hands in a dazed way across his eyes, as if  attempting to brush away a mist that obscured them, and the  papers scattered on the table began to assume shape.  Mechanically he stretched out his hand and took up a neat bundle  secured by a rubber band.  He listlessly read the name on the  wrapper.  

Once more his head sank forward, and his eyes stared out  before him, as if trying to penetrate the granite wall that  concealed the future.  A hunted look crept into them, and the  grip on the packet tightened.  He turned his head, but not his  eyes, in the direction of the youth cowering in the depths of the  big chair.  

"You say you know the head of this   —   er   —   rubber concern?" he  asked coldly.  

The tense look on Norman Crosby's face lifted.  

"Yes, sir," he answered.  "It's Henry C. Hargis."  

"Hargis!  I know him.  If you should happen to run across  him, tell him I should like to talk to him."  

He turned again to the table.  

Norman rose.  It seemed as if a heavy weight which had been  crushing him had been removed, and he walked quickly to the door.  With a backward glance toward the silent figure so absorbed as to  be apparently oblivious to his existence, he slipped noiselessly  out.  

      
# III

    In the tasteful library in which her father's presence still  seemed to linger Elizabeth Crosby wandered about, stopping now  and again to touch tenderly some object that had been especially  closely associated with him.  In the week that had elapsed since  his death she had emerged from girlhood into the fuller estate of  woman, but there still lingered about her that exquisite  trustfulness of childhood, produced by the protecting arm of a  love that had enveloped her like a garment.  

She picked up a photograph of her father,  the look of  sad tenderness deepening on her pale face.  

"My precious dad!" she whispered, passing her hand  caressingly over the face.  "I wonder if you know how I miss you!  It's very lonely without you, dear."  

She replaced the photograph on the table, her eyes blinded by  tears, and groped her way to the armchair in which the last night  of her father's life had been spent.  Sinking down on the arm,  she laid her cheek against the spot where his head had rested.  

"If only I could   —   have been with you   —   through it   —   all!" she  murmured brokenly.  "I can't bear to think that you had to face  it all alone, with no one that you loved to help you and say  good-by.  Oh, that's the bitterest part of it all!  To think that  you had to go without my being able to give you even a kiss, or  one word to tell you how I love you!  If only I could let you  know how grateful I am for all the happiness you gave me, and all  the sacrifices you made for me!  And now you'll never know!  Oh,  darling, couldn't you come back for just one little minute, just  long enough to let me hold you in my arms and kiss you good-by?"  

A great sob shook her slender form.  She sat up resolutely  and pushed back the heavy golden coils of hair that had fallen  over her forehead.  A watery little smile played over the pale  face.  

"Father wouldn't like me to give way like this," she thought  self-reproachfully.  

She got up and walked toward the door, glancing at the clock  on the mantel as she passed it.  

"Nearly five!" she exclaimed under her breath.  "I must  hurry.  Fairfax is due now!"  

It still lacked a few minutes of the hour when the portieres  which separated the drawing-room from the library parted, and  Fairfax Cary stepped into the room.  In an instant Elizabeth's  light footsteps sounded on the stairs, and she came into the  library holding out both hands in warm welcome.  

"How glad I am to see you!" she exclaimed as their hands met.  

"It's so good of you to let me come!" he answered, his eyes  devouring her face.  Major Barry gave me your message."  

"Dear Uncle Tod!" Elizabeth led the way to a roomy sofa and  sank down into the corner.  "He has been very good to me."  

Cary dropped down beside her.  

"He naturally would be.  He idolized your father, and I know  there isn't anything on earth he wouldn't do for him or for you.  But tell me how you are."  

"Oh, very well," she answered indifferently.  The thrushlike  lilt had gone out of her voice and great shadows lay under her  eyes.  "I'm a little tired, naturally; there's so much to be  done."  She glanced wearily around the room.  "I'm giving up the  apartment, you know."  

Cary nodded sympathetically.  

"That's a wrench, I'm sure."  

"Yes," assented Elizabeth.  "We've been here so long   —   ever  since I was a little girl; and although it's only rented,  everything is so associated with   —   father that I feel as if I were  living in a perpetual parting with him."  She resolutely forced  back the great tears which had sprung to her eyes.  "But Aunt  Maude thinks I'm too young to live alone, so I'm to go to them.  Uncle George is my guardian until I'm twenty-eight.  I suppose  they're right, but   —   "  She sighed.  Then she added in a sudden  burst of confidence:  "I wish the three years were over!  You  see, our ideas of what is worth while in life don't agree.  It's  going to be hard for me to see my friends, too; and I detest  Newport!"  

"It isn't just the thing for you this summer," agreed Cary.  "Can't you persuade Mrs. Crosby to go to a quieter place?"  

"Dear me, no! I shouldn't think of asking her.  Imagine Aunt  Maude cut off from her Newport season!  She'd be like a caged  lion!"  A wistful look had crept into the girl's blue eyes.  "Will you be coming down, do you think?"  

Certainly not to stay with the Crosbys," he replied, a smile  twitching at the corners of his lips.  

Elizabeth laughed a little uncertainly.  

"I don't understand it," she said thoughtfully.  "I don't see  why aunt dislikes you; you are always so nice to her."  

"She naturally thinks none but the most gorgeous butterflies  should flutter around such a brilliant little candle."  

A delicate flush crept into the girl's thin checks.  

"How silly!" she exclaimed.  "I don't think even Aunt Maude  could be so absurd!  No one could possibly think of you as a  butterfly, and some day we shall all be trying to bask in the  rays of your glory!"     

Fairfax Cary laughed.  Her praise and faith were very sweet  to him, coming as they did after years of combat with obstacles  the difficulties of which none but he had half realized.  

"When that day comes   —   if it ever does," he said in a voice  vibrant with feeling, "the glory will all be yours to do with as  you like; for any success I may achieve will be entirely due to  your faith in me and to your father's help."  

Elizabeth raised her hand in protest.  

"Oh, no," she denied vehemently.  "It was your ability that  first attracted father's notice; and as for my faith in you, if  you had not had the qualities, the faith would never have been  inspired."  

She looked at him triumphantly, as if defying him to refute  her argument.  

An overpowering desire to catch her in his arms and tell her  of the place she held in his life took hold of Fairfax; but she  looked so young, so unprotected, as she half reclined among the  cushions of the deep corner, surrounded by the evidences of  wealth, that he crushed it back.  

"What right have I to ask her to marry me?" he thought  savagely.  "She's lonely now, poor little girl, and she sees in  me a man in whom her father believed, and who consequently has a  sort of temporary glamour for her.  Wait until you have something  real to offer her, man!  Even if she cares, it isn't right to  take so much and give so little."  

When do you go to Newport?" he asked aloud.  

"Next week.  There are some legal matters to attend to and  clothes to get."  She looked significantly at her black frock,  "There are always so many things to do after   —   "  

"Yes, I know," Cary assented sympathetically.  "If there is  anything I can do, I'm sure you'll remember that I would consider  it a privilege to be allowed to help you."  

Elizabeth thanked him with a wan little smile.  

"And I want to tell you," he went on gently, "that I shall  always think of your father as `one who dared do all that may  become a man'   —   a man too fine to stoop to a meanness, too great  of heart to profit through another's hurt."  

Elizabeth looked at him gratefully, her eyes brimming with  tears.  Impulsively she laid her hand on his arm.  

"Ah," she murmured, "you were one of the few who really knew  him for what he was!"  Her chin quivered.  "The rest"   —   she  shrugged her shoulders sadly   —   "they mean to be consoling, but  you   —   you're the first who has really comforted me."  

Cary's hand closed warmly over her fingers, and his eyes  looked fixedly into hers, as if trying to convey a message which  the firm lips resolutely withheld.  

"I shall miss you," she said sadly, withdrawing her hand.  

Afraid to trust himself further, Fairfax rose.  

"If at any time you need me," he said gently in his deep,  even voice, "promise me that you will send for me!"  

"I promise," answered Elizabeth readily.  

"I want you to feel that you can call on me for anything at  any time.  Will you remember?"  

"Yes," replied the girl, putting her hand in his.  "Good-by!"  

Her eyes followed the straight, thin figure, with its dark,  proudly held head, as it disappeared into the hall, and a wave of  desolate loneliness swept over her.  Unconsciously she took a  quick step after him and held out her hands, but the outside door  closed softly.  She stopped, and her hands fell to her sides.  

      
# IV

    Notwithstanding Elizabeth's forebodings, the weeks that  followed the Crosbys' move to Windy Bluff, their place at  Newport, passed rapidly and almost happily for her.  Of course  there were times when the realization of what she had lost by her  father's death overcame her with almost unbearable pain; but as  day followed day she became more or less accustomed to the  loneliness which at first seemed insupportable.  She learned to  watch the gay life about her with eyes that no longer shrank from  the sight as from an overpowering light,  

At first Mrs. Crosby had declined the invitations showered  upon her, but by degrees she slipped back into the social swing,  encouraged by the fact that Elizabeth seemed to take her going  out as a matter of course.  But the girl resolutely refused to  enter into the pastimes of her aunt's pleasure-loving friends.  She spent her time at the grand piano in the music-room, with a  book on the  ocean-lapped rocks in front of the Crosbys'  house, or working at the Red Cross branch which had been  organized in town by Mrs. Maitland Andrews.  

Her uncle and aunt treated her with affectionate  consideration, not pressing her too hard when they found that she  was adamant in her desire for seclusion, but making her feel that  her presence was at all times a pleasure to them.  It was only  when Norman, after much letter-writing and telegraphing on the  part of his mother, at last appeared at Windy Bluff that Mrs.  Crosby interfered with the girl's wish for solitude.  

"It isn't right, dear, for a girl of your age to spend so  much time alone," she expostulated one afternoon when, after  careful manipulation, she had succeeded in persuading Norman to  ask Betty to take a sail with him in his sloop   —   an invitation  which Betty bad politely declined.  "And then, too, Betty dear,  Norman is very fond of you, and I think you might try to make his  vacation pleasant.  It's so long since he's had a chance to get  any outdoor sport, and he needs the fresh air."  

So Betty pinned on a wide-brimmed hat and accompanied her  cousin to the little white boat bobbing serenely on the sparkling  waters of the harbor.  

"Betty," said Norman, after the sails had been raised and the  boat had slipped away from her moorings, "do you like that?"  

He indicated the fast-retreating shore with a toss of his  head.  

"What?" asked Betty innocently.  

"That," and again he gave the contemptuous toss.  

"Do you mean Newport?"  

An amused look crinkled the corners of her eyes.  Norman  nodded and glanced up at the white sail stretching like a great  wing above them.  

"I do and   —   I don't," replied Betty thoughtfully.  "As a  specimen of social life, it's perfection; as a specimen of human  life, it's   —   "  She paused, and her face assumed an expression of  deep seriousness.  

"Rotten!" supplemented Norman understandingly.  "Just what I  think.  How the mater can be so daffy about it is more than I can  see.  Dad, too   —   he's not so bad, of course; but in his inmost  heart, in spite of the fact that he pretends it bores him, he  loves it, too.  Look out!  You're going to jibe!"  

Betty shifted the tiller, and the boat danced along on her  course, leaving two curling white waves bubbling behind her.  The  rush of the exhilarating air on her face, the feeling of the boat  under her controlling hand, brought a bright flush to her cheeks,  and at least temporarily lightened the heavy burden of her  sorrow.  

"Now this   —   this is great!" exclaimed Norman enthusiastically.  "You feel as if you were doing something!  Gee, Betty, it's fine  having you to play with!"  

In the few days he had been with them his eyes had partly  lost their hunted, bloodshot look, and his pasty cheeks had begun  to fill out and glow with a semblance of health.  

"You're such a bully sort," he went on.  "You've a way about  you that gets me   —   as if you had plenty of ballast aboard, and a  gust of wind wouldn't be apt to capsize you!"  

Betty laughed.  In spite of his dissipations, she was fond of  her cousin, for she realized intuitively that his weakness of  character was largely due to his defective bringing up.  

Immersed in the social life about them, his pleasure-loving  parents had left the boy to the care of servants during the early  part of his life, and to even less desirable companions, most of  whom were unknown to them, as the lad grew into manhood.  It was  hardly to be wondered at that, with plenty of money, an inherited  taste for excitement, and practically no supervision or  restraining influence, he should have succumbed to the  temptations which surrounded him.  

"I suppose it's due to father," she answered.  "He was so  wonderful   —   so keen for a good time, and yet he always seemed to  know just when to stop.  `Drink the top and leave the dregs,' he  used to say; and, after all"   —   she looked brightly into the face  beside her, with its weak chin and loose lips   —   "the top is good  enough, without the nastiness of the dregs!"  

"It's so hard to stop, though, when you once get started."  

"I know," assented Betty gravely; "but that's where you show  the stuff you're made of   —   whether you're just sand, or sand and  cement."  

She smiled gently into the boy's troubled face.  

"But suppose   —   suppose the cement has been entirely left out  of your make-up!   Suppose you're just sand, and shifting  sand at that, and suppose you don't even want to be anything  else!"  

Norman moved restlessly and wound the sheet he held around  his thin hand.  

"I can't imagine any one, even if he doesn't acknowledge it,  not wanting to stand up against what he knows will sooner or  later be his ruin.  Father used to say that life was like any  other business.  Everything we do goes down in the day-book on  either the debit or the credit side.  Every once in a while we  have to balance the book to find out how we stand in our  bank-account.  It must be a horrid experience to find one has  overdrawn!"  

The boy did not reply, and kept his head resolutely turned  away.  

"Betty," he said at last, "if you found out that some one you  thought was on the level had played you a dirty trick, what would  you do?"  

"Some one I really cared for?"  

Betty's eyes searched his face thoughtfully.  Norman nodded,  his eyes still fixed on the glistening expanse of water.  

"Why, I don't know, I'm sure." Betty hesitated.  "You'd have  to take so many things into consideration   —   the reason the person  had for wronging you, the motives, I mean.  If it were done  simply to injure you, why, of course, it would be hard; but if it  were the result of some overwhelming force, some terrible  temptation that had swept him off his feet, that would be  different, and much easier to forgive.  Why do you ask?"  

She looked at him curiously.  Norman moistened his dry lips.  

"Oh, nothing!  I was just wondering," he replied evasively.  

When they got back to the house they found Mr. and Mrs.  Crosby on the broad veranda, Mrs. Crosby busying herself with the  tea things, which had just been brought in.  In their absence  George Crosby had returned from a flying trip to New York.  

He looked unusually worn and exhausted.  In the past few  weeks he had lost weight, and his skin hung loosely on his  cheeks.  His eyes were hollow, and unnaturally bright and  restless; and he had acquired a habit of tearing stray bits of  paper, which his wife found extremely trying.  

"There's a letter for you on the table, Betty," remarked her  aunt, after a searching glance at the faces of the two young  people.  

Elizabeth picked up the letter, which was addressed in  Beatrix Hunnewell's handwriting, and moved toward the steps  leading to the ocean path.  

"No tea?" called Mrs. Crosby.  

"Not this afternoon, thank you, aunt."  

A little flush had crept into her face, and her eyes were  luminous.  She walked quickly down the gravel path to her  favorite spot among the rocks and, sinking down on a smooth  stone, opened the letter.  It ran:    DEAR BETSY:  

When are you coming to us?  I'm longing to see you, for I  have so much to tell you that I can't very well write.  

As I told you in my last letter, your friend, Fairfax Cary,  has joined the club, and I'm seeing a great deal of him.  We play  tennis together nearly every afternoon, and he very often comes  back with me to dinner.  I don't know when I've met a man I  admire so much.  He's so entirely free from all meannesses, and  has such a wonderfully broad outlook!  He's coming this afternoon  to take me for a ride in his new car, for he says it's too hot  for me to play tennis.  

I must stop now to dress.  I want to look my best, for I find  Fairfax very *exigeant!*  Write soon.          As ever, affectionately,                              TRIXIE.    

As if scorched by a devastating heat, Elizabeth drooped  against the rock behind her.  The flush ebbed out of her face,  and her eyes took on the pained look of a wounded fawn.  The hand  which held the letter fell into her lap, and she turned her eyes  toward the harbor, where the gorgeous lights of the sunset lay  reflected in molten masses of color.  Great angry clouds obscured  the sun, without entirely hiding it, as it sank slowly into their  embrace; and a silence breathless with sinister expectancy  hovered over the waters.  

The scene before her accorded perfectly with Betty's mood,  and a very passion of revolt seized her.  Slowly her mind grasped  the import of the letter.  Its air of joyous possession of a  new-found  happiness stole over her like the insidious poison of  a tropical plant, benumbing her senses, but leaving her brain  alert.  With it came the feeling that Trixie, in spite of her  protestations of friendship, had taken advantage of her absence  to appropriate that which she knew Betty prized above all else.     

But did she know?  A thin frown of perplexity fluttered over  Betty's straight brows.  Had even Betty herself known?  

Scene after scene of her intercouse{sic} with Fairfax Cary  sprang up vivid and lifelike before her, culminating in the hour  that he had spent with her after her father's death.  With a  little start of surprise, she was forced to admit that even she  herself had not guessed the nature of her feeling for him.  

"What a fool!  What a fool!" she murmured, clenching her  hands impotently.  "And now it's too late!"  

A wild desire to test the sincerity of his promise to come to  her at any time or place swept over her; but even as she planned  the meeting she knew it would never take place.  

For a long time she sat motionless, her pale face turned  toward the fading light.  Little by little the flaming brilliance  softened into cool pinks and lilacs, melting at last into blue  and neutral gray.  And then, out of the shadows, as if hung by an  invisible hand, shone the light of the evening star.  Clearer and  clearer it burned, with a steady effulgence that acted like balm  on her wound; and at last a semblance of peace settled down upon  her.  With a little sigh she roused herself and walked listlessly  back to the house.  

In the privacy of Mrs. Crosby's boudoir a stormy scene had  been taking place.  

The International and Congo Rubber Company, in which, at  Norman's suggestion, George Crosby had invested heavily, was not  proving the gold-mine of promise.  It was more like a bottomless  pit which swallowed with avidity the funds fed to it, and  demanded more with ever-increasing insistence.  To save what he  had already invested, George Crosby desperately staked all that  he could lay hands on.  

The last statement of the concern had been the reason for his  hurried trip to New York, and the unsatisfactory conditions that  he found on his arrival at the company's offices had caused his  worst fears to be realized.  Nearly all of Betty's fortune was  already swept away.  

He was pacing up and down the floor now, his face drawn, his  eyes staring wildly from beneath his contracted brows.  Mrs.  Crosby sat tense and rigid in a big chair by the window, and her  son leaned against the mantelpiece.  Their faces were ghastly,  and a frightened look lurked in Norman's eyes.  

"George!  How could you have been so foolish?" demanded his  wife, her angry eyes fixed on her husband.  

George Crosby turned furiously to her.  

"For Heaven's sake, Maude," he exclaimed between his teeth,  "try not to make it any harder for me than it already is!  You  know perfectly well why I did it   —   it was to save this young  scoundrel from State's prison!"  He pointed a trembling finger at  Norman, who cowered under the lash of his words.  "And now," he  went on bitterly, "it looks as if I should have to take his  place!"  

"Can nothing be done?"  

George Crosby spread out his hands hopelessly.  

"I don't see any way out," he groaned, sinking into a deep  chair.  

The sight of his collapse galvanized Mrs. Crosby into action.  

"Very well, then, I'll find a way!" she exclaimed grimly.  "If you think I'm going to sit calmly by and accept the ruin you  two men have brought on me, you have a very inadequate conception  of my character.  I decline to be either the wife or the mother  of a jailbird!"  

Both men shrank from the scorn in her voice, but neither  answered her.  Her husband took up an empty envelope and began  feverishly tearing it to pieces, but at her "George, put that  down!" he obediently laid the scraps in a neat little pile on the  table at his elbow.  

"How much of Randolph's money is gone?" she asked in a voice  like ice.  

"Practically all."  

"You put everything into this rubber speculation?"  

"All but the fifty thousand I had to refund the firm."  

Norman shivered under the biting contempt in his father's  voice and eyes.  

"Well, Norman," said his mother coldly, "as far as I can see,  as you are the one responsible for this catastrophe, you'll have  to be the one to get us out!"  

"How?"  The word came in a husky whisper, barely audible.  

"By marrying Betty."  

Norman gave a hoarse, mirthless laugh and looked for an  instant with haggard eyes into his mother's face.  

"Marry Betty!" he jeered.  "Why, that girl would as soon  think of marrying me as  she would   —   "  The words trailed off  into nothingness, and his head sank forward on his chest.  

"Why?" demanded his mother.  

"Why?  Because she knows I'm not fit to sit in the same room  with her, much less marry her!"  

"How does she know?  Have you been such a fool as to confide  your   —   er   —   escapades to her?"  

"Hardly!"  A sneer curled the boy's lips.  

Give me credit for some sense!"  

"You haven't led us to believe you had overmuch!" retorted  his mother contemptuously.  

The muscles of the boy's mouth tightened, and he glared for a  moment at the pitiless face below him.  Then he shrugged his  shoulders impatiently and returned to his moody contemplation of  the rug.  

"There is nothing," Mrs. Crosby went on impressively, "that a  girl of Betty's temperament likes better than to reform a man.  I  think if you could impress on her how much her influence could do  for you, you would find that she was far from averse to marrying  you.  I know she's extremely fond of you.  In fact, she told me  so only this morning."  

Evidently Norman doubted the truth of his mother's words;  but, taught by long experience, he refrained from arguing the  point with her.  

"Did you ever stop to think that it's a pretty bum deal we're  giving her?" he asked grimly.  

"It's no time to think of that now," answered his mother  impatiently.  "She will surely marry some one, and there's no  reason on earth why she shouldn't be as happy with you as with  any one else   —   that is, if you choose to make her so."  

"Perhaps she would," assented the young man dubiously.  "But I can't help feeling sorry for her."  

"Sorry for her!  Sorry for her!  Naturally I'm sorry for her,  too; but   —   how about your mother?" broke in Mrs. Crosby hotly.  "Aren't you sorry for her?"  

Norman was silent.  He knew that even the comparatively few  years he had lived had made him unfit to be the husband of any  woman.  Genuinely fond as he was of Elizabeth, the idea of  injuring her beyond what he had already done was repellent to  him, realizing as he did that even her influence could not wean  him from the life that had ensnared him.  

He was on the point of declining to fall in with his mother's  plans when his eyes fell on the stricken figure of his father,  huddled in the big chair, George Crosby's face was gray with the  unearthly pallor of a mortal illness, and Norman stared at him in  remorseful silence.  

"All right, mother," he said huskily.  "I'll do my best."  He hastily left the room.

    It was an unusually silent party that gathered around the  softly lighted table for dinner that evening, and the  conversation, in spite of Mrs. Crosby's efforts to enliven it,  dragged perceptibly.  Dish after dish left the room practically  untouched, each one being so bent on concealing his or her lack  of appetite that the same condition of the others passed  unnoticed.  But of the frequency with which Norman's wine-glass  was refilled his mother was more observant; and at last she  indicated, with an imperious gesture that brought immediate  compliance, that he had had enough.  

It was with a distinct feeling of relief that, the meal being  ended, Mrs. Crosby rose and, drawing Elizabeth's hand through her  arm, led the girl to the veranda, which was lighted by the  uncertain rays of a swinging lantern.  Sinking back among the  cushions of a wicker sofa, she drew her niece down beside her.  

"I feel as if I hadn't half told you how happy it makes me to  have you here with us," she murmured, pressing Betty's arm  gently.  "You're very dear to me, child!"  

A rush of tenderness swept over Elizabeth.  Her parched soul,  craving love with the intense desire begot by long denial,  reached out with an inarticulate cry for the first demonstration  of affection she had received since her father's death.  

"Dear aunty!" she whispered brokenly, her hand clinging to  the older woman's arm.  "You're very good to me.  I can never  thank you enough!"  

"No, dear," remonstrated her  aunt; "it is I who should be  the grateful one.  You are filling the place in my heart of the  little daughter I have always longed for.  Sons are very nice,  Betty, but a mother's heart is always empty, and her life  incomplete, until  she has the warm sympathy of a daughter  who understands in a way impossible to a man.  I should love to  feel that you were going to be with us always, that no one could  ever take you away."  

"No one ever will, aunty," whispered the girl tremulously.  

The ache in her heart was becoming more and more unendurable,  and she grasped eagerly at the home that she had accepted so  reluctantly a few weeks before.  

Mrs. Crosby gave her arm a gentle pat and then released her.  

"That's right!" she exclaimed warmly; then, as the men came  through the doorway, she added:  "Now let Norman take you on the  rocks; the moonlight is gorgeous on the water to-night.  Norman, fetch a wrap for Betty."  

Norman threw a scarf over Betty's bare shoulders, rising  white and smooth out of the filmy black of her gown.  She  reluctantly accompanied him to the water's edge and sank down on  the rock over which he had spread a rug.  He dropped down beside  her, and for a while neither spoke.  

Betty's eyes were fixed on the path of moonlight which  wavered on the dark waters.  Her mind, wandering off to the  Hunnewells' home, pictured Trixie and Fairfax Cary strolling  along the paths of the rose-scented garden, or watching this same  moon from the pagoda, with its curtain of fragrant honeysuckle.  

Norman, too, seemed content to sit in silence, and puffed  away vigorously at the cigar which apparently absorbed his  attention.  At last he spoke.  

"Betty," he began hesitatingly, " could you   —   love   —   a man you  didn't   —   respect?"  

"I don't know, I'm sure, Norman," replied Elizabeth  uncertainly.  "Why do you ask?"  

"Oh, I was just wondering how a girl like you would feel  about that sort of thing   —   marriage, I mean, with a man who hadn't  always   —   kept straight."  

"Marriage!" breathed Betty almost fiercely.  "I'm never going  to marry!"  

Norman gave a little snort of incredulity.  

"Ha!  That's what almost all girls say   —   generally just before  they announce their engagements!"  

"Well, in this case it's true," insisted Betty finally.  "I  haven't the least intention of marrying   —   ever!"  

"If you thought it would help some one   —   help him to keep out  of trouble, and all that   —   wouldn't you?"  

There was a wistful note in his voice.  Betty turned her  eyes, in which the hurt look still lingered, to the recumbent  figure of the boy beside her, his flushed face dimly visible in  the uncertain light.  

"Why do you ask?" she questioned wonderingly.  

Norman turned impulsively to her.  

"Just this, Betty.  I can't seem to be able to   —   keep  straight.  I've tried my best, and I just can't do it; and I  thought perhaps, if you could bring yourself to take me on   —     you're so strong, I know   —   I could stand out against it all.  I'm  sure I could!  Oh, Betty, don't you think you could bring  yourself to marry me?"  

The words came out in a torrent of desperation.  Betty looked  at him as if, in spite of the fact that she heard them, their  meaning had passed her by.  

"Marry you?" she repeated vaguely.  

"Yes, Betty   —   darling, I love you!"  

He roused himself from his reclining position and, putting  his arm around her, bent his head down to hers.  His breath,  heavy with wine and the smell of the cigar, sickened her, and she  pushed him away almost violently.  

"Don't, Norman, don't!"  

Norman took away his arm and, leaning his elbows on his  drawn-up knees, stared gloomily before him.  

"Well, I can't say I blame you," he remarked morosely.  

Something in the boy's humility turned Betty's feeling of  resentment into one of contrition.  

"But, Norman," she exclaimed, "it isn't that!  Oh, please  believe me!  I'd do anything in the world to help you, but I  couldn't marry any one I didn't love.  Norman dear, you know I'm  fond of you   —   really fond of you, but it isn't the same!"  

"Do you think if I gave up drinking, and kept away from  trouble generally, you could ever   —   "  

But Betty shook her head emphatically.  

"No, dear; it isn't the kind of feeling which, no matter how  strong it grew, could ever turn into the love I must have for the  man I'm going to marry."  

For a moment neither spoke; then Norman said curiously:     

"Have you ever known a man you could love like that?"  

Betty did not reply, and nothing but the splash of the waves  as they dashed impotently against the rocks at their feet broke  the silence.  

"Who was it, Betty?" asked Norman at last.  "Was it Fairfax  Cary?"  

Betty started violently.  

"Fairfax Cary?" she repeated in a startled voice.  "Oh, no!"  

"I'll bet it was!" declared Norman.  

He's just the sort of guy who would get a girl like you.  Well, I wish you joy of him!  Awful prig, but he wouldn't keep  you up nights worrying!"  He got up and stretched himself lazily.  "Well, me for bed!  How about it, fair coz?"  

Betty rose quickly to her feet and put her hand on Norman's  shoulder.  

"You're all wrong about my loving Mr. Cary, Norman," she said  emphatically.  "It's absolutely untrue.  I don't care for him at  all, except as a friend; but he isn't a prig, Norman.  He's the  finest   —   "  

"All right!" agreed Norman indifferently, stooping to pick up  the rug.  "But don't get so stewed about it!  I didn't say he  wasn't."  

They turned toward the house.  

"It's no use, mater," he announced sullenly to his mother,  after Betty had bid them good night.  "Just as I thought, she's  in love with that Cary chap."  

"Did she tell you so?" asked his mother sharply.  

"Not in so many words, but she showed it pretty plainly.  He's just the kind of man she would fall for   —   always gassing  about ideals and uplift and all that hot air.  Any one could  see   —   "  

"Well," ruminated his mother, half to herself, "perhaps when  Elizabeth learns that her father did not leave behind him the  savory reputation she sets such store by, she will realize that  his daughter may not hold the same attraction as she did for a  man of Cary's stamp."  

"What do you mean?" asked the boy fearfully.  

"Never mind what I mean, Normie.  Go to bed!  I think before  long your pretty cousin will be thankful to marry you!"  

But it was well past midnight before Mrs. Crosby followed the  advice she gave her son, and even then it was not to sleep.  Hour  after hour she lay staring at the moonlight filtering in through  the filmy curtains, and causing the familiar objects in the room  to assume grotesque and, to Mrs. Crosby's tortured mind,  vindictive shapes.  

Enraged at finding herself entangled in a net which wrapped  itself tighter and tighter about her, threatening her very  existence, she groped about blindly, feverishly, to find the  means of escape which she insisted must exist.  It couldn't be  that she, Maude Crosby, after all these years of comparative  immunity   —   due to skilful manipulation on her part, she reminded  herself   —   should come to grief because a girl, a mere child,  opposed her will!  

Keyed to its highest pitch, her mind reviewed the conditions  that confronted her.  Plan after plan formulated itself, only to  crumble away at the fancied touch of the girl's hand.  But at  last a course of action presented itself which she thought would  solve her difficulties, and she dropped off into a fitful doze.  

The broad sunlight was streaming in through the open windows  when she awoke and found her French maid standing by her bedside,  a dainty tray containing Mrs. Crosby's breakfast in the girl's  hands.  

      
# VI

    The sultry atmosphere that had enveloped the Crosby household  during dinner lasted throughout the next morning, but Elizabeth  did not suspect that she was even remotely the cause of it.  Accustomed to her aunt's moods, which succeeded one another with  such frequency and rapidity that Betty had learned to regard them  with a more or less amused tolerance, she avoided Mrs. Crosby by  spending the morning at the Red Cross rooms.  But when the  feeling of oppression lasted through luncheon, she began to fear  that Norman had confided her rebuff of him to his parents, and  that their changed attitude toward her was the evidence of their  resentment.  

When the meal was over she followed her uncle into his den,  where he was generally to be found at times of domestic unrest.  

"Uncle George," she began, pausing on the threshold.  

"Come in, Betty," he replied from the depths of his leather  chair.  "Come in   —   I want to talk to you."  

Betty dropped down among the cushions on the window-seat.     

"That sounds nice!" she said with her bright smile.  

Her uncle's likeness to her father had increased as the  younger man lost weight, and with it his air of indolent ease;  and in the months she had passed in his home, when she had  learned something of the burden under which he labored, her  affection for him had increased fourfold.  

She watched him fondly as he reclined in his big chair, his  head resting against the back, his half-closed eyes following the  rings of smoke from the cigar that he had just taken from his  mouth.  Betty waited for him to begin; but as he did not seem  inclined to open the conversation she remarked quietly:  

"Uncle George, will you please give me five hundred dollars?"  

The hand that held the cigar dropped nervelessly on the arm  of the chair, and the cigar fell to the floor.  Muttering  something about inexcusable carelessness, her uncle stooped down  and picked it up.  When he straightened, and Betty saw his face,  she was shocked at its appearance.  

"Uncle, are you ill?" she asked, coming to him and bending  solicitously over him.  

"I'm all right, thank you," he replied huskily, and reached  with a trembling hand for the match-box.  

Betty leaned against the edge of the table beside him, and  watched him doubtfully as he unsteadily applied the light to his  cigar.  Then she went on:  

"Mrs. Maitland Andrews, the chairman of our Red Cross branch,  is raising money for an ambulance to be sent to France, and I  promised her five hundred dollars."  

Betty made the announcement with the calm assurance of one  who, never having been denied money in reasonable amounts, did  not consider a refusal possible.  George Crosby settled even  deeper in his chair.  

"Betty, I'm sorry," he began at last, but until I get your  father's affairs straightened out, I'm   —   I'm afraid   —   it's  impossible, quite impossible for   —   me to let you have so   —   much  money."  

Betty looked at him, her blue eyes round with wonder.  

"But, uncle," she expostulated, " father told me just before  he died that he always kept several thousand dollars on deposit  for emergencies, and that he never drew on that account."  

"There have been some pretty heavy drafts on it lately,  however   —   funeral expenses and outstanding bills that you asked me  to pay at once," he reminded her.  

"Yes, I know, Uncle George, but they couldn't have exceeded a  couple of thousand dollars, and there must have been some income  from the estate during the past months."  

George Crosby's eyes fell before the girl's steady gaze.  He  examined the end of his cigar carefully.  

"Betty," he said at last in a strained, hard voice, "I've  been meaning to tell you about it for a long time, but I thought  I would wait until   —   well, until you had got your strength back  after the shock and grief of your father's death.  There isn't  any estate."  

"No estate!" echoed Betty incredulously, bending toward him  the better to see his face.  

Her uncle shook his head, his eyes still fixed on his cigar.  

"No," he went on.  "Your father made unfortunate investments  before he died, and practically his entire fortune was lost.  It  was thought that the shock and disappointment, and all that, were  the cause of his death."  

He replaced the cigar between his lips and drew deeply on it.  

"I can't see how it is possible!" exclaimed Betty, clasping  her hands piteously.  

"My dear child"   —   George Crosby turned his haggard, twitching  face toward her   —   "when you've lived as long as I, you'll realize  that in the financial world it's generally the impossible that  happens, especially in times such as these.  Your father had the  reputation of being a clever, hard-headed business man, but since  I've been going over his affairs I've been surprised, and I may  say shocked, to find the number of wildcat investments he made.  Of course, in time some of them may be worth something, but at  present   —   "  He paused significantly, and for a fleeting instant  his eyes sought hers.  

"Then I'm a   —   pauper" faltered Betty, her face white and  frightened.  

"Don't say that, dear child!  You'll always have a home with  us, of course, and the best we can give you; but I'm afraid  five-hundred-dollar subscriptions will have to be cut out for the  present at least.  You understand, I know, that it isn't because  I  don't want you to have the money, don't you, Betty?   —   but  simply because it isn't there!"  

He rose and put his arm around the drooping figure.  Betty  raised her white face to him.  

"Thank you, Uncle George," she whispered tremulously.  "You've always been very good to me, and I'm very grateful; but  what hurts me"   —   her voice broke   —   "is that any one should think  that father was involved in transactions that weren't   —   quite   —   "  

"Don't let that worry you, my dear.  The world is so used to  heavy jolts after men die that such a thing is no longer even a  nine days' wonder."  

"Oh, but   —   but father was   —   different!" interrupted Betty  almost fiercely.  "He was not like that!  Any one who knew him at  all must have realized that he wasn't that kind of man.  Why, he  had the biggest heart and soul of any one I knew!"  

"Bigness of heart and soul don't necessarily mean fulness of  pocket, though," her uncle hastened to assure her, with a dubious  shake of his head.  "Quite the reverse!  Well, I'll do the best I  can, and perhaps, as I say, some of the investments will turn out  better than we anticipate; but in the mean time we'll have to go  a bit slow."  

As if in a dream, Betty crept up to the seclusion of her room  and sank into a rocking-chair in the deep bay window.  She gazed  out at the expanse of water roughened into whitecaps under the  lash of a strong south wind.  Benumbed and heavy-limbed, she  watched the gulls as they poised against the currents of air,  hanging suspended and almost motionless for an instant, and then  with unerring precision swooping down into the dark water and  reappearing with their prey dangling in their beaks.  

Hour after hour she sat as motionless as if a freezing breath  had turned her into ice.  The shadows crept across the lawn to  the water's edge, and still she sat with the look of pain  deepening in her eyes.  

It was almost dark when Mrs. Crosby knocked at the door, and  without waiting for Betty's "Come in!" opened it and entered the  room.  She had just returned from a bridge-party at Mrs. Peyton  Grenville's, and an air of antagonism emanated from her, as if  the afternoon had not been a profitable one.  

Mrs. Crosby was one of those people who lay their winnings to  their own skill and their losings to the malice of fate, against  which they protest long and loudly.  This afternoon luck had been  decidedly against her.  She had come directly from the motor to  her niece's room, and was unaware of Elizabeth's interview with  her husband; but she had definitely made up her mind that the  only way out of the difficulties which were closing in about them  was through the marriage of Elizabeth and Norman.  As Betty had  long since learned, it was not well to frustrate Mrs. Crosby's  plans.  

"I want to talk to you a little, Betty," she began, sinking  into the chair that her niece drew up for her and pulling off her  long, white gloves.  

Betty fixed her great eyes on her aunt's face in an almost  visible effort to concentrate on her words.  Inwardly she shrank  from what she realized was in store for her; for Mrs. Crosby's  face had the implacable look that meant:  

"There's only one path to follow, and that follows me!"  

"It's about Norman, dear," Mrs. Crosby went on.  She was  trying to untie the dotted veil which so cunningly hid the marks  that time and worry had left on her face, and Betty jumped to her  assistance.  "Thank you, dear; you're such a helpful little  daughter!"  

She patted the girl's hand as she took the veil from her.  Then she continued:  "You know that boy is simply infatuated with  you, child; he talks of nothing else, and this afternoon, before  I left for Mrs. Grenville's, he told me again how much your  influence has done for him."  

"I'm very glad, Aunt Maude," murmured Betty dully.  

"Men are strange creatures, Betty," her aunt went on.  "Although they call us the weaker sex, it seems as if we women  are continually obliged to make allowance for their failings, and  to strengthen them in their hours of temptation.  And, Betty  dear, I don't suppose there is any higher vocation for a woman  than that of saving a man from the purgatory in which he would  end if it were not for her help."  She stopped to study the  serious face before her, and added playfully:  "Don't look so  solemn, child!  A man's love ought to bring joy, happiness, and  not sadness!"     

The lines of Betty's face obediently relaxed into a pitiful  attempt at a smile.  

"I am glad, Aunt Maude," she reiterated.  

"Then will you let me tell the dear boy so, Betty?" asked  Mrs. Crosby, an exultant look stealing over her face.  "He thinks  you don't care.  In fact, he told me so; and I should love to be  the one to bring him the news that he's wrong!"  

"He knows that I care for him, aunt, but   —   "  

"But what?"  

The question was like the crack of a gun.  

"But"   —   it seemed as if the girl's white lips could not frame  the words, but after a pleading look into her aunt's relentless  face Betty went on desperately   —   "Norman asked me to marry him,  and I   —   I can't!"  

"Why not?"  

Mrs. Crosby's voice was like ice.  

"Oh, aunt!" Betty clasped her trembling hands piteously.  "It's quite impossible   —   quite; you must see that!"  

"I see nothing," answered her aunt uncompromisingly, "except  that the boy loves you, and you are the one woman who could save  him from   —   ruin!"  

Mrs. Crosby's voice broke over the last word.  This sign of  unwonted emotion brought a throb of pity into Betty's throat and  made her task even more difficult.  

"But, Aunt Maude," she faltered, "before he   —   died, father  made me promise that I would never marry a man I wasn't sure of  or that he wouldn't have approved of.  I don't think   —   in fact, he  would not have I'm quite certain that wanted me to marry Norman."  

"Your father was hardly one to assume the position of judge  of men, my dear!"  

The words came with a cutting emphasis that pierced the  girl's brain like a knife.  

"What do you mean?" she asked hoarsely.  

"Just what I say.  Your father's life was not so exemplary  that he could afford to criticise those who were simply entering  on the paths that he had already trod!"  

Betty shrank back as if seared by a flame.  

"Do you mean to insinuate that my father was dishonorable?"  

"I insinuate nothing.  I *state"*   —   Mrs. Crosby paused for an  instant so that the full force of her words should strike home   —     "that Randolph Crosby, before he died, was publicly cut by his  most intimate friends!"  

As if unable fully to grasp the import of her aunt's words,  Betty stared wide-eyed into her face.  

"My, father?" she gasped at last, a quiver of incredulous  pain passing over her ashen face.  "I don't believe it!"  

Mrs. Crosby looked at her curiously.  Such suffering as the  girl exhibited at the assault on her father's name was  incomprehensible to her.  After all, what did it matter?  But she  was quick to see the advantage it gave her, and she followed it  up with ruthless celerity.  

"Well, whether you believe it or not, the fact remains that  after Steadfast was so disgracefully beaten for the Withers Stake  there was a great deal of talk about foul play, and I myself saw  Humphrey Welsh and several others refuse to speak to your father.  It was suspected that he had won a great deal of money on the  race   —   much more than enough to offset the loss of the purse!"  

All the rancor of the past months over her loss on the race,  for which she had always blamed Randolph Crosby, came out in the  bitterness of Mrs. Crosby's words.  

Elizabeth drooped further into her chair, and the line of  pain between her eyebrows deepened.  As a flash of lightning  reveals a scene in the darkness of the night, the picture of the  club enclosure after the race rose before her.  She recalled her  own and Fairfax Cary's doubts as to Steadfast's running, and her  father's tense face when he came back from his interview with  Pat.  

As a logical sequence came the remembrance of Mrs.  Hunnewell's peculiar behavior when Trixie had joined them, and  her insistence that the girl should return to her at once.  There  was evidently some truth behind her aunt's words, but that her  father was in any way connected with anything that bore the least  resemblance to crookedness she resolutely refused to believe.  

Mrs. Crosby evidently realized that she had said enough, for  her manner softened almost to tenderness.  

"Forgive me, child, if I've hurt you," she said gently; "but  your words struck me in a very vulnerable place.  When her only  son is attacked, a mother naturally resents it.  Your reflections  on Norman's character goaded me into doing what I long ago  decided I would never do   —   let you know the estimation in which  the world   held your father before his death.  You see, it  would hardly be possible, under the circumstances, for him to  object to Norman as a son-in-law!"  

She smiled sweetly at the girl; but Betty, her face drawn and  rigid, continued staring fixedly at her aunt.  She did not relax  when the older woman rose, and, laying her hand on her niece's  shoulder, leaned over her and said:  

"Well, may I take a little ray of hope to the dear boy?"  

In a voice that sounded as if it came from a great distance,  Betty responded:  

"I shall never marry any one   —   now!"  

Mrs. Crosby raised her eyebrows despairingly.  She withdrew  her hand and moved toward the door.  

"I hope in time you'll feel differently," she remarked.  "By  the bye, Mrs. Goodhue has just returned from Lawrence, and she  told me this afternoon that your little friend Trixie Hunnewell  is engaged to Fairfax Cary."  

Betty did not reply, so Mrs. Crosby passed out into the hall,  the perplexed frown lingering around her eyes.  

      
# VII

    Like a wounded thing stricken unto death, Betty sat alone,  hardly aware that her aunt had gone.  Her great eyes, distended  and dark with pain, gazed out into the fading twilight.  She was  forcing her mind back over the events which just preceded her  father's death.  

Scene after scene presented itself vividly to her, like  little pieces of mosaic which fitted accurately into one another;  and at last a completed picture was disclosed which solved  problems hitherto inexplicable.  The sudden falling away of  people whom she had thought her friends, and whose unsympathetic  bearing at the time of her sorrow had puzzled and hurt her beyond  words; the coolness of others with whom she had unavoidably been  brought into contact   —   the revelations of the afternoon explained  it all.  

The twilight deepened into night, and still she sat  motionless, staring out into the dark, her brain groping through  the maze of memories for the image of her father.  Her brow  contracted as she struggled to visualize the presence that always  seemed to linger near her.  When at last she succeeded, and the  cold, keen-eyed, rather cynical face was outlined against the  dark clouds of doubt that her uncle and aunt had raised, her lips  trembled into a happy smile of restored confidence.  

She rose stiffly and switched on the light.  Going to the  writing-table, on which stood the large picture of her father,  she took it up and looked tenderly into the stern face.  Unflinchingly the keen eyes returned her gaze until the  questioning expression in her eyes turned into one of perfect  trust, and the taut lines of her face relaxed.  

"No matter what they say," she whispered softly, "I shall  always believe you were as true as steel!"  

At her words the eyes seemed to soften into the look of  tenderness they had always held for her.  

Her eyes wandered from the photograph to the dainty things  about her   —   the flowered chintses, the tasteful furnishings, the  pretty French prints, their wires concealed by shirred ribbons  surmounted by a bow; the glass-topped dressing-table with its  array of silver-backed toilet articles; the inviting bed where  she had passed so many restful nights.  The conviction came over  her that she could no longer remain a member of that household.  

But where to go?  She knew her world too well not to  understand that the homes where the daughter of the prosperous  Randolph Crosby was so eagerly welcomed would be closed to the  child of the discredited outcast.  But though no alternative  suggested itself to her, the fact remained glaringly apparent  that it was impossible for her to stay at Windy Bluff.  

A knock sounded at the door, and Marie, the French maid,  asked if she could be of any assistance to *mademoiselle*.  Betty  replied that as she had a headache she did not want any dinner  and would not need her again that night.  Then she locked the  door quietly, drew out a suit-case from the depths of the closet,  placed the photograph of her father carefully in it, and began  hurriedly packing it with things from the closet and drawers.  Every now and then she glanced at the little gilt clock on the  mantel, feverishly ticking the minutes away.  

She took off the white muslin she had worn all day, and put  on a black suit and a hat, over which she tied a heavy veil.  Then, with a final lingering look about the room,  she turned  off the lights, picked up the suitcase, and opened the door.  

After listening intently for a moment, she stole along the  corridor and down the stairs to the large hall below.  Subdued  voices came from the dining-room, but the drawing-rooms were  deserted, and Betty made her way unnoticed to the front door.  Opening it softly, she crept out into the friendly darkness.  Fearful lest the gravel of the drive should betray her flying  footsteps, she sped across the lawn toward the entrance gates,  and with a deep sigh of relief passed between them into the  highway beyond.  

The moisture-laden wind was blowing in fitful gusts that gave  promise of rain in the near future, and Betty quickened her pace  once more.  She kept her eyes anxiously alert for a conveyance  that would take her to her destination, for the suit-case  increased in weight with every step and seriously impeded her  progress; but at that hour all the public hacks were in demand to  take diners-out to the homes of their respective hosts, and Betty  did not dare to ask a lift in any of the returning private  motors, for fear that the chauffeurs might recognize her.  

Notwithstanding the fact that she was thankful for the  protection the darkness gave her, she started violently at every  unusual sound.  Once or twice she had to stop, rest her suit-case  on the ground, and lean for support against a railing or tree  until she recovered her breath sufficiently to be able to go on.  

It was with an involuntary "Thank Heaven!" that she at last  spied the bright lights of the wharf, which revealed the shadowy  hulk of the boat alongside.  A continuous ebbing and flowing  stream of dark figures passed up and down the gangway, and Betty,  realizing that not many minutes remained before the hour for  starting, hastily made her way to the ticket-office and procured  her passage for New York.  

As she passed down the corridor   —   through which white-coated  stewards were hurrying, calling vociferously, "All ashore!  All  ashore!"   —   she came face to face with Mrs. Maitland Andrews.  Mrs.  Andrews stared at her doubtfully for a moment, trying to  penetrate the heavy veil.  Then, as Betty tried to edge past to  her stateroom, she exclaimed, laying her hand on the girl's  shoulder:  

"Aren't you   —   why, yes, you *are* Betty Crosby!"  

Realizing that it was impossible to escape recognition, and  anxious to explain to Mrs. Andrews her inability to make good her  promise in regard to a donation for the ambulance, Betty drew the  older woman into her stateroom.  

"Would you mind coming in for a minute?" she pleaded.  "I  want to tell you   —   "  

Perceiving from the tremulous tones of the faltering voice  that something was amiss, Mrs. Andrews readily accompanied the  girl.  

"Why, of course, dear," she responded heartily.   "We'll have  a nice talk   —   not a soul to interrupt us!"  

Betty untied her veil and took it off before she spoke again.  

Mrs. Andrews's role of confidante to every sort and condition  of man occupied almost all the time that she did not spend at the  board-meetings of the many societies she practically ran and  supported.  Bishops and newsboys, great financiers and debutant  girls, poured their difficulties into her sympathetic ears, and  went away strengthened by her sound counsel.  Betty had always  been an especial favorite with her, and with open arms she had  welcomed the girl into the Red Cross work, knowing that it was  the most effectual means of alleviating her sorrow.  

It was with deep concern that she noted the ghastliness of  the young face and the tightly compressed lips.  She settled  herself comfortably on the lounge and, in order to give Betty  time to compose herself   —   for she saw that the girl had difficulty  in beginning   —   remarked beamingly:  

"I'm going to New York to order the ambulance.  Isn't it  splendid?  All the money has been promised, and I want to get it  off at once."  

A tremor passed over Betty's face.  

"That's what I want to tell you," she began impulsively,  laying her hand on Mrs. Andrews's arm.  "I can't   —   it's impossible  for me to give you the money I promised this morning."  

Mrs. Andrews placed her hand gently over the girl's.  

"That's all right, dear; it won't matter in the least.  It  'll come in from somewhere   —   it always does.  Please don't fret  about it!"     

Two great tears overflowed Betty's eyes and rolled down her  cheeks.  

"I was afraid you wouldn't understand," she whispered  tremulously.  "I was afraid you might think I wanted to pose as  being very generous before all those women this morning and then  back out in private; but I thought I had the money, and   —   and it  isn't there!"  

She caught her lower lip in her teeth in an attempt to still  its trembling.  Mrs. Andrews took the girl's hand between hers  and began stroking it gently.  

"Tell me all about it, dear; perhaps I can help you."  

But Betty shook her head hopelessly.  

"No one can help, as far as the money goes.  It's all gone   —     every penny of it.  Apparently father made investments that  didn't turn out well, and instead of being a rich man he was  quite the reverse.  I'm on my way to New York now to look for  something to do."  

"Have you left your uncle's for good?"  

Betty nodded.  

"I couldn't possibly stay   —   there were conditions that made it  quite out of the question.  Not that Uncle George wasn't  perfectly sweet, and told me that they allways expected me to  make my home with them, but   —   "  

"I understand," answered Mrs. Andrews gravely.  "You don't  want to be under obligations to them.  Sometimes it's like that,  and the obligations keep mounting up and mounting up until it  seems as if they would crush you, no matter what you do in  return.  It's much pleasanter to stand on your own feet, even  though it means hard work.  What sort of place are you thinking  of taking?"  

Betty turned a wan little face, over which flickered a watery  smile, to the older woman.  

"Beggars can't be choosers," she said bravely.  "I'm ready to  take anything."  

"Have you had any training?" asked Mrs. Andrews.  "Stenography, typewriting, or any of those things?  So many of  the girls have been taking them up lately as a sort of fad."  

Betty shook her head dispiritedly.  

"Father wouldn't let me take up anything like that.  He said  that I would never have to use it, and that it was a waste of  time and energy.  The only thing he let me do was a course in Red  Cross first aid and home nursing, which was a thing he said every  woman should know; but, of course, that's just the thing that  won't be of any use to me now, with so many trained nurses  about!"  

A look of deep dejection settled over her, and for a moment  they sat silent, listening to the ceaseless pulse of the engines  as the boat forged its way into the dark.  

Mrs. Andrews rose and, placing her hands on Elizabeth's  shoulders as she stood beside her, said gently:  

"I'm very glad I ran across you.  I want you to go to bed  now, and to sleep, mind you   —   no lying awake thinking and  worrying!  To-morrow things will look brighter   —   they always do.  Promise me!"  

Elizabeth's face darkened as if a dense cloud, the forerunner  of a storm, had passed over it.  

"Ah," she said passionately, "you tell me not to worry, but  how can I help it when people are saying such dreadful things  about my father?"  

"Are they?" asked Mrs. Andrews thoughtfully.  "I haven't  heard anything, but then I don't often hear slander.  People know  it isn't exactly in my line."  The even tones were a trifle  contemptuous.  "Or perhaps," she added whimsically, "they knew it  wouldn't be any use.  You see, child, I happened to know your  father!"  

She stooped and kissed the girl impulsively.  Betty clung to  her a moment, unable to speak; then her arms dropped, and she  smiled bravely into the other's face.  

"Good night," she whispered tremulously, "and thank you again  and again!"  

"Now remember, no worrying!"  

Mrs. Andrews shook her finger playfully as she disappeared  through the door.  And, strange to relate, Betty, worn out and  exhausted, followed her advice and slept peacefully throughout  the night, a pitiful little smile hovering over her lips.  

      
# VIII

    It was fully a month after Elizabeth's return to New York  when Fairfax Cary ran across Major Barry in the Pennsylvania  Station as they were hurrying to their respective trains.  At the  risk of missing his connection, the major laid an arresting hand  on Cary's arm.  

"Have you seen Betty Crosby lately?"  he asked hurriedly.  Then, as Fairfax shook his head, he added:  "She's disappeared   —     can't be found anywhere.  Her uncle's nearly distracted.  When  can I see you?"  

"To-morrow at eleven, at my office," responded Fairfax, and  they parted precipitately.  

It was only when Fairfax was speeding through the cool tunnel  under the river that he began to grasp the full import of the  major's words.  Betty Crosby gone!  Without a trace!  It was  inconceivable!  Things like that didn't happen in the set in  which she moved.  After her promise to him, too!  No, he  absolutely refused to believe it.  

But the more he dwelt on the major's news, the deeper grew  his concern.  That she should leave the uncongenial atmosphere of  the Crosby home did not surprise him, but that she should go  without telling any one of her destination gave him, in spite of  his determination not to credit the report, a feeling of extreme  disquietude.  

"There must have been an upheaval of some sort," he thought  grimly.  "Mrs. Crosby's a pretty difficult proposition at best,  and she probably played on the child's nerves like a rasp.  Can't  say I blame her for cutting it all; but why in thunder didn't she  let the rest of us know?"  

It was this same question that he put to Trixie Hunnewell  when they met on the club veranda as soon as he had succeeded in  drawing her away from the group of people with whom he found her;  for, as he speedily learned, she was in as deep ignorance as  Major Barry and himself as to Elizabeth's whereabouts.  

"She promised me before she left town that she would call on  me if she was ever in trouble," he said, adding ruefully, half to  himself:  "As I knew mighty well she would be before long!  And  Betty Crosby's not one to break a promise."  

Trixie eyed the tense, troubled face thoughtfully, and a  feeling came over her that perhaps, in some way, she had been the  cause of that broken promise.  She realized that her letters to  Betty had been full of Fairfax Cary.  It was highly probable that  Betty had imagined, as she herself had believed, that Cary's  attentions were of a different significance from what it now  appeared was their real character.  For Trixie had come to see  that her attraction for him lay in the fact that she was  Elizabeth's friend and in constant communication with her.  

"If it were really that way with them," she thought  self-reproachfully, "I'm afraid Betsy felt that I wasn't very  true to her; but why didn't they tell me?  I certainly had no way  of guessing!"  

But her contrition only added to her concern, and made her  even more desirous of aiding in the search.  

"I shall depend on you to let me know how I can help," she  told Fairfax when he left her.  "I shall be on tenter-hooks until  I hear what Major Barry has to tell you to-morrow."  

That the intervening hours had been trying for Fairfax, too,  was evident from the alacrity with which he rose to greet the  major on his entrance into Cary's private office as the clock  struck eleven the following morning.  

"Sit here, major," he said, indicating a chair on the other  side of his flat desk.  

Major Barry laid his hat and cane carefully on the desk and  sat down.  His usual cheery expression had given place to one of  deep seriousness, and he nervously fingered his eye-glasses on  their broad black ribbon.  

"The first intimation I had of this," he began without  preliminary, "was two days ago, when I met George Crosby at  Delmonico's.  He looks like an old man.  Have you seen him?"  Fairfax shook his head, and the major went on:  "You know how the  Crosbys have always held themselves   —   as if there wasn't any one  quite good enough   —   you know   —   just manner, of course, but   —   well,  it's all gone as far as George is concerned.  He has positively  crumpled up!  I thought he'd been ill, and stopped to hear about  it, but he insisted he was all right.  It was only when I  inquired for Elizabeth   —   you know I'm her godfather, always was  very intimate with Randolph and his wife   —   you knew, of course?"  

He fixed his kind, candid eyes on Cary's face.  Fairfax  nodded understandingly.  He had heard of the major's romance   —   how  the two men had loved and courted the beautiful Helen Rogers, and  how, when Crosby had succeeded in winning her, the major   —   or  captain, as he then was   —   had laid his hand on Randolph's shoulder  and said:  

"You win, old man!  Just as well, I guess; an army post's no  place for a girl  like that!  But if you don't make her  happy, by gad, sir, you'll have to answer for it to me!"  

And when at the end of a year she had died, leaving the  little flaxen-haired miniature of herself to take her place, the  two men had accepted the trust that was confided to them and  lavished the deepest tenderness and care on the little maid.  

"She isn't quite sure which is her real father," chuckled  Randolph when, on her third birthday, Barry had "dropped in as he  happened to be passing," as he put it, and Betty held out her  arms to him with a gurgle of delight.  He "happened to be  passing" so often those days that it had come to be a joke  between the two men.  

"All right, old man, I understand   —   you just keep on,"  Randolph had said with a slap on the back as he handed the major  his glass of whisky-and-seltzer.  "Between the two of us she may  get one fairly decent father!"  

And Tod Barry had laughed, and said that he was willing and  anxious to contribute his share.  So it was evident from the  major's manner, as he sat in Cary's big chair and twirled his  eye-glasses, that Betty's lack of confidence had hurt him to the  quick.  

"It is strange she didn't communicate with you," mused  Fairfax.  

"I can't understand it   —   it makes me afraid the child has come  to some harm."  

Barry moved uneasily, and began beating a tattoo on the edge  of the desk with his carefully kept nails.  

"Did you find out the reason for her leaving?" asked Fairfax  anxiously.  

"Some family trouble, as far as I can make out from what  George said.  I couldn't really get at the facts, but George  hinted something about Norman's wanting to marry her.  Evidently  Betty wouldn't have it   —   you know what a miserable, dissipated  little cur he is, and I suppose Mrs. George cut up rusty and made  it unpleasant for her; so she just left one night, taking a  suit-case full of clothes, and they haven't heard of her since."  

"Well, at all events, there's satisfaction in the knowledge  that she has plenty of money," commented Cary.  

That's just the rub!  Has she? put in the major impatiently.  "George as good as told me that Randolph's affairs were pretty  well involved when he died.  He intimated that Elizabeth had gone  off with the idea of supporting herself.  Imagine   —   Betty! "  

"But I don't understand!" Fairfax exclaimed.  "Randolph  Crosby's fortune gone?  Why, it's impossible!  I know too well   —   "  

The major looked at him attentively.  

"Did you know anything about his investments?"  

"Well, not such a great deal.  Mr. Crosby was too reticent a  man, too self-reliant, to confide anything more than was  absolutely necessary, even to his lawyer, and of course I did  only a small part of his legal work.  But, from what I saw of his  holdings and from my knowledge of the man, I should say that what  you suggest is a rank impossibility."  

The two men eyed each other thoughtfully.  

"Is George Crosby sole trustee?"  

In his effort to make it unconcerned, the major's voice  sounded strained and unnatural.  

"Sole trustee and guardian, so Miss Crosby told me."  

"Humph!"  The major was carefully examining the spring of his  eye-glasses.  "Cary," he said at last, looking directly into the  dark, keen face across the desk, "I think it's time Elizabeth  Crosby's friends took a hand.  As her godfather, I feel a certain  responsibility in regard to her, and I ask you to assist me in  whatever search it is necessary to make to determine the child's  whereabouts and the condition of her affairs."  

"I will gladly do anything in my power, Major Barry.  As you  know, or perhaps you don't know, everything that concerns Miss  Crosby concerns me very deeply."  

Major Barry looked at him sharply.  

"Why the dickens, man, didn't you tell her so?" he exclaimed.  Then all this would have been avoided!  

But Fairfax shook his head positively.  

"She knew, or at all events she must have guessed; but I  couldn't ask her to marry me when I had practically nothing to  offer her."  

"Good Lord, Cary, you had a fine young man and a fine old  name to offer her!  What more could any girl want?"  

"Thank you, major.  It's very kind of  you; but even if  it were true, that's not enough for a girl like Elizabeth  Crosby!"  

"It's enough for any girl, especially for one of Betty's  stamp.  Why, every bit of this would have been avoided!"  

"You speak as if you think she would have taken me!"  

There was a badly concealed tremor in Cary's voice, and the  hand that held the pencil with which he was scrawling illegible  words on the pad before him shook visibly.  

"Take you!  Why, man, are you blind?  Self-depreciation is  one thing, but imbecility   —   there, there   —   "  

He stopped and looked quickly at Cary, evidently afraid that  he had gone too far; but the radiant expression on Cary's face  told him that he could have continued indefinitely in the same  strain.  

"Cary," he asked abruptly, "have you heard anything  derogatory to Randolph Crosby since he died?"  

Fairfax Cary paused for a moment before answering, his eyes  wandering to the tall buildings pressing closely in on his only  window, a look of seriousness driving away the happy light in the  dark eyes.  He turned back to the major and nodded regretfully.  

"I was with them when they left the race-track that  afternoon, and I saw several of Mr. Crosby's friends refuse to  speak to him.  Afterward I tried to find out the reason for it.  As far as I could learn, it was pretty generally conceded that  his horse, Steadfast, had been doctored   —   "  

The major inclined his head.  

"And of course the blame was laid on him, in spite of the  fact that he lost the purse  

"They claimed that he had more than offset that."  

Again Major Barry nodded.  

"Well, of course I don't believe a word of it   —   don't see how  any one could who knew the man; but the question is, how can we  prove it's false?  I'm not satisfied to let the good name of my  best friend and the father of that child go down to posterity  blackened.  We've got to clear it, and we've got to find  Elizabeth!  Now, what do you suggest?"  

"Have any steps been taken?"  

"George Crosby has employed a private detective, but they're  so afraid of people's talking, and of a scandal, that they're  tremendously handicapped.  You see how it was with me   —   I only  learned by chance."  

"I think I'll go and have a talk with Pat," ruminated  Fairfax.  "The boy may be able to tell us something.  You know,  one of the last things Mr. Crosby did before he died was to send  the boy enough money to make up what he lost on the race.  Pat  told me about it just after the funeral.  He was all broken up.  It seems he has a sister who is a bit of a high-flier, from all I  hear, and he's very anxious to establish her somewhere away from  the track influences.  He had saved enough money to give her a  start, but he lost most of it when Steadfast was beaten, so you  can imagine his gratitude at Mr. Crosby's generosity."  

"Just like Rand!"  The major's face twitched.  "Well, let me  know what you learn."  

He rose and took up his hat and stick.  

"I will, Major Barry.  Could you meet me at the Sussex Club  to-night at, say, eleven o'clock?  I can't tell just when I can  see Pat."  

The major assented, and the hands of the two men met in a  firm clasp.  

      
# IX

    As soon as he was alone, Fairfax despatched a letter to the  jockey's headquarters at Sheepshead Bay, and spent the rest of  the day in impatient perturbation awaiting his reply; but when  the answer came, it was a hurried scrawl from his sister.

     DEAR MR. CARY:
  

Pat's been hurt awful bad in the steeplechase this afternoon.  Come as quickly as you can.                          MOLLY DELANEY.


   Fairfax grasped his hat and rushed to the elevator.  When he  reached the street he jumped into a taxi and told the chauffeur  he would double the fare if he reached the Pennsylvania Station  in time for the six seventeen train.  Fairfax got his train and  the man his fare, and the young lawyer settled himself with as  much patience as he could command to pass the interval which must  elapse before he could reach Pat.  

Molly had evidently left word at the office of his coming,  for when Cary reached the cheap hotel where the Delaneys had  their rooms a small boy took him in charge.  The guide conducted  him at once up the  steep stairs and down the narrow hall  lighted by a flaring gas-jet which disclosed the gilt and green  wall-paper disfigured by great spots of mold.  The boy indicated  a door on the right.  

"He's in there!" he said in a hoarse, terror-stricken whisper  and fled precipitately.  

Cary knocked softly, and the door was immediately opened by a  thin youth with furtive eyes.  

"It's him!" said this individual in a sepulchral voice and  disappeared into the corridor.  

Cary stepped into the dim room and closed the door.  On the  iron bedstead he could just distinguish the indistinct outline of  the jockey's figure.  Out of the bandages that swathed his head  burned two bright eyes, feverishly restless.  He pressed the  boy's hand as it lay motionless on the counterpane.  

"I'm very sorry for this, Pat!" he said gently.  

A little smile stole over the blanched, freckled face.  

"The jig's up, I guess, Mr. Cary.  That steeplechasin's  pretty sure ter git us sooner or later.  Mr. Crosby wouldn't  never let me do it, but   —     Well, I'm mighty glad ye got here in  time.  I've been wantin' ter see ye."  

A spasm of pain passed over his face.  

"Are they doing everything they can for you?" asked Cary,  bending solicitously over him.  

"Oh, yep!  Sit down, Mr. Cary.  I told Jim ter put a chair  fer ye; ain't he done it?"  Then, as Cary sat down, Pat went on  faintly:  "They had a couple of doctors here, an' they patched me  up some, but there ain't nothin' ter be done, I guess.  Kind o'  tough, ain't it?  I'd 'most got me pile tergether fer that little  home fer Molly.  I don't like the way things is goin'!"  

For a moment he searched the sympathetic face before him, and  then, as if satisfied with what he saw, he continued  confidentially:  

"Mr. Norman's begun hangin' round again.  He's in there with  her now."  With a quick glance of his eyes he indicated the door  opposite the bed, whence issued the low rumble of a man's voice  punctuated by the shrill tones of a woman. I  don't like it!" he  concluded hoarsely.  When gents like him comes followin' up girls  like Molly, ye kin jest betcher sweet life it ain't fer no good!"  

"Has it been going on for long?" asked Cary.  

"Off an' on.  He went ter Newport fer a while, an' I wuz  hopin' it wuz all off, but fer the  past few weeks he ain't  hardly lef' her fer a minute.  Now ye kin see why I wuz so set on  gettin' a quiet little place off somewhere.  Race-tracks ain't no  place fer a girl.  If I could only ha' got that fixed, an' ha'  felt Steadfast under me once agin, it wouldn't ha' been so hard  ter go.  Gee, Mr. Cary!"  A film came over the bright eyes.  "Ye  don't know how I felt ter see that lout Burns ridin' that hoss!  Why, he's got hands like a plowman!"  

"I'm sure it must have been hard," Cary said softly.  "I want  to ask you about Steadfast and that race for the Withers Stake,  Pat.  Have you ever suspected that there was anything wrong with  the horse that day?"  

"Yer mean he'd been doped?  I didn't think so then, Mr. Cary;  but lately, from things Molly's let drop, I've kind o'  suspicioned   —   well, I dunno.  Ye see, when a girl gits jealous,  she says all kinds o' things.  When Mr. Norman went off ter  Newport, Molly got it inter her nut that he wuz rushin' some  queen there, an' one night she had sort o' high-strikes, an' she  said if he wuzn't goin' ter make good she'd peach.  Then she said  somethin' about what happened before the Withers race; but all of  a sudden she stopped, an' I couldn't git nuttin' more out o'  her."  

The weak voice trailed off and stopped, and the eyes closed.  

A feeling of compunction came over Cary.  He could see that  the boy's strength was ebbing very fast, but he felt that he must  do all that he could to get some clue to the mystery of  Elizabeth's hiding-place.  

"Pat," he said, bending over the limp form, "do you know  where Miss Crosby is now?"  

"Miss Crosby?  Miss Betty?"  The blue eyes opened suddenly  and stared into his.  

"Why, ain't she at Newport?"  

Cary shook his head.  

"She left about a month ago."  

"That's queer!  Don't he know?"  

Pat glanced meaningly at the door between the two rooms.  Again Cary shook his head.  Pat stared thoughtfully at him.     

"Well," he said at last, "it ain't fer the likes o' me ter be  sizin' up gents like Mr. George Crosby an' Mr. Norman; but in me  own mind I allays puts 'em in a pretty low class, an' I knows Mr.  Tutney thinks the same.  I ain't a bit surprised she couldn't  stan' 'em! "  

"Tutney?" repeated Cary.  Barney Tutney?"  

"Yep; owns them big diamond-mines in South Africky   —   least,  him an' Mr. Crosby does together."  

"Where can I find him?"  

"Dunno jes' where; he's down there now, wherever they are."  

"I wonder how I can get hold of him!" mused Cary.  

The boy's head moved restlessly on the pillow.  The short  twilight had darkened into night, and the little room was  shrouded in shadows.  Outside, an indistinct murmur of voices  floated up from the group of youths that Cary had noticed  standing on the bedraggled plot of grass before the hotel steps,  but the words were indistinguishable.  

"Mr. Cary!" came in a frightened whisper.  "Mr. Cary!  Are ye  there?"  

"Yes, Pat; what is it?"  

Cary's hand closed over the cold fingers.  

"I thought ye'd gone!"  There was a world of relief in the  weak voice.  "It's all right   —   only I wuz kin' o' lonesome.  I  s'pose I wuz light-headed fer a minute, an' I thought I wuz  alone.  It's kind o' hard ter die when ye ain't never really  lived!"  

Cary bent over the slight figure, motionless in the glow of  the electric light which flickered up from the street below.  

"Is there anything you'd like me to do for you, Pat?" he  asked gently.  

"If ye could   —   I don' hardly like ter ask it o' ye, but ye're  so kind   —   if ye *could"*   —   there was infinite entreaty in the ashen  face   —   "look after Molly a bit?  Ye see, there won't be any one  after   —   after   —   "  

With a lump in his throat, Fairfax promised to do everything  in his power for the girl.  

"I've got to go now, Pat," he added regretfully.  "I told  Major Barry I would meet him at eleven o'clock in town.  He's  trying to find Miss Betty, too, but I'll be down again the first  thing in the morning."  

The boy's fingers tightened for a moment around the sinewy  hand; then he released it.  

Good-by!" he whispered huskily. "Ye're on the level   —   I kin  trust ye.  I've tried ter be straight, too," he added wistfully.  

"You've tried, and you've succeeded, Pat!"  Cary stooped over  him, his voice deep with feeling.  "That's what Mr. Crosby used  to say   —   `That boy's as straight as a string; I'd trust him  anywhere!'"  

"Did he say that?" came in a hoarse, eager whisper.  

"Often."  

"He ain't never said it ter me   —   "  

"He will soon, Pat.  I know he's waiting now to tell you."  

A slow smile flitted over the boy's face.  

"It's kind o' comfortin', ain't it," he faltered, "ter think  there's some one ye know out there?"  He raised his eyes to the  window, open at the top to admit as much as possible of the night  air.  The new moon shone through the blackness, and Pat fixed his  eyes on it.  "Do ye really think he is?"  

"I'm sure of it," answered Cary confidently.  "Now shall I  call Molly?"  

"All right, an' thank ye fer comin'!"  

Cary knocked at the door between the two rooms, told Molly  Delaney that he had to leave, and with a last clasp of Pat's limp  hand let himself out into the hall.  He glanced at his watch as  he passed the gas-jet, and, startled at the lateness of the hour,  hurried down the stairs and through the group of loungers still  loitering in the front yard.  Jumping into a hack that stood at  the curb, he directed the driver to make all possible speed to  the station.  

"Wonder if Pat's dead?" remarked one of the group in a hushed  voice.  "That cove's just lef' him.  Mike said his name is Cary,  an' he took him up ter see Pat."  

"He looked kind o' cut up," answered another of the crowd.  "I guess he's pretty close ter gone, poor old Pat!"  

Cary, in the mean time, was hurrying to the train, which was  just pulling out as they reached the station.  He darted across  the platform and swung upon the last car.  He was still panting a  little when he walked down the aisle and came face to face with  George Crosby, who had entered the car from the other end.  

"Oh   —   ah   —   Cary   —   how-do?" he hesitated and held out his hand.  "Was it you I saw making that flying leap for the train?"  

Crosby was evidently trying to speak with his old-time  lightness.     

"Close shave!" replied Cary laconically.  

"Come and speak to Mrs. Crosby," continued the other, and  Fairfax followed him somewhat reluctantly to where Maude Crosby  sat.  

"I thought it was you," she exclaimed as she put out her  hand; " but I've never seen you in such mad haste before, and I  couldn't quite reconcile it   —   "  

"With my usual Southern laziness?" supplemented Cary, with a  little laugh.  

As usual when he was with Mrs. Crosby, he was possessed by an  intense desire to irritate her by voicing her insinuations, and  then watching her discomfiture; but in his present frame of mind  the mood did not last long.  

"I've just come from Pat Delaney," he said quietly to Mr.  Crosby.  "He's been dreadfully smashed up in a steeplechase, and  I'm afraid he's done for, poor little chap!"  

He looked past Mrs. Crosby to the dim outlines of the plain,  stretching unbroken and dark to meet the star-flecked sky.  

"Too bad!" ejaculated Crosby.  "He was a nice boy."  

"Who's that   —   Randolph's jockey?" asked Mrs. Crosby of her  husband.  

He nodded and sank down beside her.  

"How's Miss Crosby?" asked Fairfax in as careless a voice as  he could command.  

"Quite well, thank you," answered Mrs. Crosby quickly.  She  looked straight into the keen, dark eyes, and added with the  least possible quiver of her eyelashes:  "It has been a great  pleasure to have her with us this summer."  

"I'm sure of it," agreed Fairfax.  "Will she be with you this  winter?"  

He experienced a curious sensation, almost of admiration, as  he watched the skill with which she met his thrusts.  Crosby, on  the contrary, had sunk farther into his seat, and the unnatural  pallor of his skin had become more accentuated.  

"Yes, indeed!" replied Mrs. Crosby.  "We're devoted to the  child, and can't possibly get along without her!"  

"Please remember me to her," said Cary gravely.  

With a word of farewell he walked through the car into the  one ahead, in search of a vacant seat.  He settled himself in it  with the thought:  

"The major's right   —   George Crosby looks twenty years older  than he did in June.  Too bad!  Well, it happens that way  sometimes.  Mrs. Crosby, too, doesn't look quite as youthful as  she did.  I wonder if they're really so worried over Betty's  disappearance!  I wouldn't have given them credit for so much  heart.  They weren't going to let me in on the secret.  They  evidently thought I didn't know!"  

The muscles of the firm chin tightened, and unconsciously he  straightened his shoulders.  

"Well, they're right   —   I don't know much; but I'm going to  know more before long!  I'll find Betty Crosby, if I have to  search every inch of the way between here and San Francisco; and  when I do, there won't be any more shilly-shallying!  There isn't  any reason for it, now that the money's gone.  I'm almost glad of  it!"  A half smile curved the proud lips.  "And if what the major  says is true, then   —   "  

It still lacked a few minutes to eleven when Cary entered the  door of the Sussex Club, but, knowing the major's unusual  punctuality, he went at once to the room where they had arranged  to meet.

    When Fairfax Cary entered the lounge of the Sussex Club he  found young Tony Page, who had just returned from France after  three months' service as a stretcher-bearer in connection with  the American Ambulance, holding forth to a good-sized audience.  

"But the peach experience of them all," Fairfax heard him  remark as he passed on his way to the corner where he was to meet  Major Barry, "was the time I got wounded."  He glanced at his  arm, which he carried in a sling.  "It was before Verdun, and  every one had been working his heart out day and night trying to  get the wounded back.  It was some job, for there were so many  that every hospital was overflowing, and we stretcher-bearers  thought we were lucky if we got three hours' sleep out of the  twenty-four.  Every once in a while one of us would be knocked  out, and then there would be the dickens, and all to find a man  to take his place.  Well, that night it seemed as if all Hades  was let loose.  Generally they talk about a curtain of fire  behind the force attacked, but this time it seemed as if we were  in the center of it.  The shrapnel had been falling round us like  hail, and finally a  splinter struck Tom Strawbridge   —   you  know Tom   —   Philadelphia man   —   polo-player?"  

He paused and looked interrogatively at Lindlay Strong, who  nodded.  

"We had a man on the stretcher," Tony went on, "and of course  we had to take him in; but when we reached the hospital we made  up our minds we'd get Tom or die in the attempt.  We knew it  would be frightfully difficult, if not impossible, but we weren't  going to let that stop us if we could get the extra man.  Apparently there wasn't one to be found for love or money.  Small  wonder, too, for it looked like almost certain death to go back  into that inferno.  Then some one tapped me on the arm.  I turned  and saw a boy   —   little chap he was; young, too, from his voice.  It was dark; I couldn't really get a good look at him, but he  asked me if he might go with us.  Of course I snapped him up, and  we jumped on the ambulance and drove like mad to the place where  we'd left Tom.  That sure was some ride!  The road was all torn  to bits by heavy traffic and by the shells, and every once in a  while we would jounce into a pit that seemed as if we would never  get out of it.  All the time those great, screeching Jack  Johnsons were crashing around us, exploding with a fury that  seemed to tear the very insides out of the earth.  It was awful!"  

Tony Page stopped and shuddered, and then, as if to emphasize  the reality of his present surroundings, shook the ice against  the side of the glass he held in his hand.  

"Did you get Tom?" asked Strong anxiously.  

"Yes, finally.  He was about all in, but we put him on the  stretcher and started back to the ambulance.  Those beastly  shells never let up for a minute, and at last one exploded about  fifty yards from us, and a great piece of it caught me in the  arm.  I felt a gush of blood, and knew that a  big vein had been  cut.  Fortunately we were close to the ambulance,  so we shoved  Tom in, and then the little chap we'd picked up started to put a  tourniquet on my arm.  His hands looked awfully small for a  boy's, and he had the most wonderful touch!  I tried to see his  face, but his cap was pulled down over his eyes, and I was sort  of dazed from the shock, so I didn't really care much; but when  we got back to the hospital, and I was taken into the ward, I  took a good look at him.  Fellows, who do you suppose it was?"  

There was a tense silence, while Tony Page's quick eyes ran  over the eager faces about him.  Major Barry had come in, and he  and Fairfax stood a little to one side, listening to the young  man's story.  

"Who?" asked some one.  

"Elizabeth Crosby!"  

Fairfax Cary caught the back of the armchair behind which he  stood, as if to steady himself.  Major Barry stepped impulsively  toward Tony Page.  

"Randolph Crosby's daughter?" he ejaculated.  

"The same," acquiesced Tony cheerfully.  "She's been working  in the hospital.  Mrs. Maitland Andrews sent her over and paid  her expenses; and when Betty heard we were short a man, she took  the clothes of one of the wounded soldiers and went out with us.  Pretty sandy, wasn't it?"  

"Are you sure?"  

Horrified incredulity shone on Major Barry's face, from which  the ruddy color had fled.  

"Am I sure?  Am I sure I'm alive?"  Tony looked significantly  at his arm.  "Why, of course I'm sure!  That girl saved my life,"  he asserted gratefully.  "I've always known Betty; used to play  tennis with her a lot at the Country Club and different places.  I always knew she had grit; but believe me, that night was enough  to make the nerve of the strongest man crack, much less a  woman's.  She didn't seem to care, though; she walked through  that Hades as quietly as if she'd been strolling along Fifth  Avenue.  I tell you, there was some commotion in that hospital  when what she'd done got out!"  

Fairfax Cary was hanging on every word, his face livid, his  eyes like coals of fire.  Tony took up a cigarette and held it  against the match that some one lit for him.  

"Paul Townsend's at the head of the hospital.  You remember  him, don't you?  Big, strapping fellow, looks like Adonis, fair  hair, very bright blue eyes.  He's a fiend for work, simply eats  it up, has that hospital humming day and night, and no matter  what time you bring in a poor wretch he's always on the job.  Well, he's in love with Betty   —   absolutely dotty about her.  I  think it began long before he went to France.  At all events,  when he found out what she'd done, he went right up in the air   —     said he was responsible for the nurses under him, and  such a  thing must never happen, again.  Betty stood there with a quiet  little smile on her face and asked him what it mattered.  Gee,  that girl has sand!  You ought to have seen old Paul's face!  He  was fairly sputtering with rage and excitement!"  Tony chuckled  delightedly.  "But he made her promise not to do it again.  He  told her he'd send her home if she did, and that settled it."  

Fairfax Cary walked to an armchair in the corner and dropped  into it.  He covered his eyes with his hand, and Major Barry  heard him gasp under his breath.  

The major laid his hand on Cary's shoulder.  

"It's all right, my boy," he said quietly.  She's safe  enough!"  

Cary's hand dropped, and he raised tortured eyes to the  major.  

"But think of her going through that!"  

The major's eyebrows were twitching nervously.  He nodded.  

"Frightful!  It never should have happened.  I don't know  what Mrs. Andrews was thinking about.  The front's no place for a  girl like Betty.  Never stops to think of herself.  She's just as  apt as not to do it again!" he concluded fearfully, forgetting  his consoling counsel of a moment before.  

Fairfax agreed disconsolately, and they stared anxiously into  each other's face.  

"Tell you what, old man!"  The major emphasized his words by  bringing down his clenched fist into his open palm.  "One or the  other of us   —   or both of us, if necessary   —   must go over and bring  that child back!"  

Cary nodded gloomily, but his eyes brightened at the  suggestion.  

"Now which shall it be?" the major went on thoughtfully.  "I'd give half my life to go, but"   —   a quizzical, rather wistful  light gleamed in his kind eyes   —   "I think, Fairfax, perhaps you'd  have more influence."  

It was the first time the major had called him by his  Christian name, and it seemed to Cary as if in some way it  brought him nearer to Elizabeth, and gave him a part ownership in  her.  He impulsively put out his hand and grasped the major's.  

"Thank you, major!" be exclaimed a little huskily.  

The light in Major Barry's eyes increased until it illumined  his whole face.  

"And, Fairfax," he went on whimsically, "if Betty wants to  stop in Paris and get her trousseau, tell her it will be my  wedding-present."  He hesitated before he added softly:  "They  tell me the Bermudas make an ideal wedding-trip at this time of  the year!"  

The color mounted into Cary's face.  

"I'm afraid it isn't going to be as easy as all that," he  answered with a rueful shake of his head.  

"You can't tell, my boy; you can't tell!"  Then the major  asked abruptly:  "How about this fellow Townsend?"  

The flush died out of Cary's face, and was replaced by an  anxious frown.  

"He was at the head of the Rockefeller Institute for a while.  He's always been a great admirer of Betty."  

"Well, the sooner you get off the better."  Major Barry  reached for the evening paper, which lay on a table near them,  and, adjusting his eye-glasses carefully, turned to the shipping  news.  "The Touraine sails tomorrow morning at six thirty.  Can  you make it?"  

"I can!" declared Fairfax so emphatically that the major  chuckled.  

"I'll give you some letters.  It would be useless going  without the proper credentials.  By the way, did you see Pat?"  

"Yes; I've just come back from Sheepshead Bay.  The poor  little chap met with a bad accident this afternoon, and I'm  afraid he's done for," Fairfax said sadly.  

"Too bad!  I'm sorry to hear that!"  The major's face  expressed real concern.  "What happened?"  

"He got smashed up in a steeplechase.  He was nearly gone  when I left."  

"Too bad!  He was a nice little lad.  Good sort   —   absolutely  straight.  No chance for him?"  

He looked interrogatively at Fairfax, who shook his head.  

"I'm afraid not."  

"Shame!  Randolph never would let him ride in those  steeplechases   —   said he was too light, and also too good a boy."  The major paused for a moment before asking:  "Did he say  anything about the race?"  

"Nothing definite; but be seemed to suspect that something  was wrong with Steadfast, and he intimated that Molly   —   his  sister, you know   —   had information that would throw light on it."  

The major raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips under the  gray mustache.     

"So?" he asked thoughtfully.  

Fairfax went on.  

"Norman Crosby seems to be running her pretty hard.  Pat's  been a good deal worried over it."  

"I don't wonder!" commented the major grimly.  

"He also told me that Mr. Crosby was interested in some  diamond-mines in South Africa with a man by the name of Tutney   —     do you know him?"  

"Tutney?  Oh, yes, I know Tutney.  Randolph was in a lot of  schemes with him.  He's a keener, all right, but I guess he's  honest without any question; and he thought a lot of Randolph   —     that I'm sure of.  Did Pat say where he was to be found?"  

Fairfax shook his head.  

"South Africa, somewhere   —   that was all the information he  could give me."  

"Rather a large order, eh?  Well, all right, old man; I'll  hunt up the address and cable it to you.  Perhaps that would be  as good a wedding-trip as the other," he added chaffingly.  

Fairfax smiled uncertainly.  

"I hope you're a good prophet," he replied, rising and  pushing back his chair.  "Will you write those letters here or at  my diggings?"  

"I'll come with you, I guess."  

The two men walked out of, the room, stopping on the way to  get the number of Betty's hospital from Tony.  

      
# XI

    The sun was just rising behind the tall buildings in Brooklyn  the next morning when Fairfax jumped from a taxi at the wharf of  the French line.  Picking his way through the bustling throng of  porters, he boarded the vessel, went at once to his stateroom,  undressed, and went to bed.  They were well past Fire Island when  he awoke, to hear the rhythmic throb of the engines as the boat  plowed her way through the deep waters.  

With a feeling that for the present he had done as much as  lay in his power, he turned over and went to sleep again.  He  dreamed that the boat had been sunk by a torpedo, and that Betty,  dressed in a torn, bloodstained khaki uniform, was standing on a  miraculously floating stretcher, holding out her hands in an  effort to save him as he struggled in the water.  

In a base hospital somewhere in France, Betty, oblivious to  the commotion her disappearance had caused, toiled night and day,  stilling the pain of her heart by the ministrations of her hands.  It was trying, nerve-racking work, which made demands on heart  and sympathies as well as on muscles, and which sent her to bed  so nervously and physically exhausted that she perforce must  sleep.  But at times, when she was on night duty, and the  occupants of her ward were quiet, a feeling of desolation crept  over her that made her gaze almost enviously at some gaunt form  in a near-by bed on whose face dwelt that expression of aloofness  which showed that he was nearing the shadow-land.  

It was after one of those night-watches that Dr. Townsend  stopped her in the corridor as she was on her way to her room.  

As Cary had said, she had known the doctor well in New York,  and the fact that he was in charge of the hospital had been one  of the reasons for her acceptance of Mrs. Andrews's suggestion.  It had also influenced Mrs. Andrews in making the offer to Betty;  for, knowing the man and his admiration for Betty, she realized  that the girl would be well looked after.  Indeed, she hoped  that, in time, in the close association of the work, the feeling  which she knew existed at least on Townsend's side might develop  into a stronger attachment which would solve the girl's  difficulties.  

That she had been right in her predictions was apparent from  the look of concern on the doctor's face as he laid a detaining  hand on Betty's arm.  

"Are we working you too hard, Miss Crosby?" he asked  solicitously.  

"No, indeed"; she answered with an attempt at lightness.  "Work is what I came over for!"  

"I know, but we don't want to overdo it.  You look mighty  thin to me!"  His eye ran over the almost ethereal lightness of  the girl's figure.  

"I wasn't exactly portly when I arrived!" laughed Betty.  

"No, I know," he said sympathetically.  His eyes came back to  hers with a look of more than concern.  "But I can't run any risk  of your breaking down."  

Betty's eyes dropped.  

"No fear of that," she answered resolutely. "I wouldn't allow  myself to give out,  after seeing the wonderful way in which  you work."  

"It's been play since you came!" answered Townsend softly.  "You've filled the whole place with sunshine, and it seems now as  if I couldn't get tired.  You've been an inspiration as well as a  help!"  

A deep flush spread over Betty's face.  

"It's awfully good of you to be so encouraging," she answered  gratefully; "for, of course, I realize that I must have failed  horribly in my work."  

"Failed nothing!" retorted Townsend emphatically.  "I can  tell you that your deft ways and the sight of your sweet face  have helped many a man to endure without a word tortures that  have wrung his soul!  And I   —   well, I simply can't get along  without you! "  

The words sounded extravagant, and Betty raised her eyes with  a little laugh to his; but the expression on his face caused the  laugh to die on her lips.  

"Tell me I won't have to do without you!" he entreated,  coming a step nearer to her.  

But Betty shrank from him and put out her hand, palm outward.  

"Oh, please   —   please!" she pleaded.  

"But, my darling"   —   the strong hand closed over hers   —   "I love  you!  Don't you think in time you could   —   "  

Elizabeth quickly drew away her hand.  

"Oh, not now, not now!" she breathed tremulously.  "I  couldn't possibly, yet!"  

She sped up the stairs to her room and, flinging herself face  down on her bed, sobbed convulsively.    

With the assistance of Major Barry's letters, which seemed to  have the effect of magic in making difficult paths straight,  Fairfax, one afternoon about ten days later, found himself  wending a tortuous way from Paris in the direction of a great  smoke-cloud which hung pendent from the sky.  In and out of the  many vehicles that blocked the road, his chauffeur picked a way  past huge sign-posts, devastated fields marked with mounds  bearing little wooden crosses and soldiers' caps, streams  swarming with bathing soldiers, their horses lining the banks and  drinking their fill.  

The air was choking with dust, white and fine, that sifted  through and into everything, covering all, yet never seeming to  rest.  Nearer and nearer to the great smoke-cloud they drew, an  incessant booming as of thunder roaring in their ears.  Under the  cloud Fairfax could see the flash of mighty guns, whose  concussion shook the earth with terrific power.  

A sharp scream rang in their ears, and a great black object  hurled itself past them and buried itself violently in a deep,  self-made grave.  Cary involuntarily ducked and grasped the side  of the car, while the chauffeur grinned sardonically at him over  his shoulder.  

They entered the remains of a village.  Tom houses, piles of  brick and mortar, debris of every kind lay scattered about.  Desolation and ruin even more marked than that of the forlorn  countryside through which they had passed emphasized the  destruction the war had brought.  

The chauffeur stopped the car before a long, low building  over which floated the Red Cross flag.  Fairfax jumped out and,  entering the doorway, arrested a young man who was dashing  through the hall.  His hands were full of dressings, and he  hardly paused long enough to hear Cary out.  

"Miss Crosby?" he repeated breathlessly. "Can't say, I'm  sure, whether you can see her or not.  We're rushed to death this  morning.  Three hundred wounded came in last night, and we've  none of us had any sleep.  I'll see  if she can be spared for a  few minutes."  

He vanished up the steep stairs, leaving Fairfax waiting  impatiently in the bare hall, breathing that indescribable  atmosphere of suffering induced by the pungent smell of  anesthetics and disinfectants.  Through half-closed doors he saw  endless rows of closely packed beds, and in each a figure swathed  in bandages, the same look of patient suffering carved on each  face.  Outside, the continuous bursting of shells   —   dangerously  near, Fairfax thought   —   caused his nerves to twitch spasmodically.  

He heard a light step behind him, and, turning, saw a slender  figure in the uniform of a Red Cross nurse coming toward him.  At  first he did not recognize the pale face that looked out from  under the white head-dress with its little red emblem.  It was  only when Betty smiled and stretched out her hand that he saw  that it was she.  

"Betty!" he exclaimed, clasping her hand in both of his.     

"How did you find me?" she asked quietly.  

"I learned from Tony Page, at the Sussex Club.  He was  telling how you saved his life.  I was waiting for the major and  happened to overhear him   —   it was by the merest chance.  Betty,  why did you do it?"  

"What?" asked Betty innocently, the shadow of a smile  flitting over her face.  

Cary dropped her hand abruptly.  

"Why did you go off like that and not let any of us know?"  

"I didn't think any one would care particularly."  

Her tone was hard and cold.  

"Care?" repeated Fairfax in a puzzled way.  "Care?  Why, what  do you mean?"  

"Come in here." Betty turned to a little room, half office,  half reception-room, which happened to be empty.  "Just as I say,  I didn't think any one would care."  

Fairfax looked at her gravely.  Great shadows encircled her  eyes, and her shoulders drooped wearily.  

"Not your uncle or aunt, or Major Barry"   —   he paused   —   "or I?"  

Betty's chin quivered.  

"Dear Uncle Tod!" she murmured regretfully.  "Did he worry?"  

Fairfax took a restless turn up and down the room.  

"Really, Betty," he said severely, "I don't think you've been  overkind!"  

Betty looked out of the window at the ruins on every side.  Then she turned back to Fairfax.  

"If I'd told Uncle Tod, he would have told Uncle George, who  would have insisted on my coming back to New York, and that I'm  not going to do!"  Again she looked out of the window, a  rebellious light in her eyes.  "I suppose he knows all about it  now?" she asked impatiently.  

"I don't know what the major has done since I left," answered  Cary stiffly.  "I started a few hours after I heard   —   "  

"Why did you come?" asked Betty calmly; but behind the quiet  words and tone lay an inexorable resolve.  

The face before her was like stone.  

"To take you home!"  

"Home?  Home?" answered Betty.  "I have no home!"  

The stern face softened, and Cary came toward her  impetuously.  

"Let me make one for you, Betty!"  

Instinctively Betty recoiled from him, and a dark flush  spread over her face.  "You!" she exclaimed in a horrified voice.  "You!"  

For a moment Fairfax studied the condemning face.  That she  would refuse him, in spite of the major's predictions, he had  fully expected; but that she should show such repugnance startled  him.  Outside the thunder rolled ceaselessly, punctuated now and  again by the screech of a shell as it tore its way through the  air.  

Betty broke the awkward silence by remarking coldly:  

"It was very good of you to come so far, and I assure you I'm  very grateful for your interest, but it's quite useless.  I'm  happy here, and Dr. Townsend seems to find me useful, which is  something   —   "  

"Betty," broke in Fairfax impulsively, are you going to marry  Townsend?"  

An expression of anger crossed the girl's face.  

"What right have you to ask me that?"  She looked at him in  cold defiance.  

"The right my love for you gives me," retorted Fairfax  steadily.  

"Your love!" repeated Betty scornfully.  

"Yes," reiterated Fairfax gravely, "my love   —   the love I've  had for you ever since we first met, when I had as little hope of  ever being able to tell you of it as if you were on a different  planet.  When conditions changed I thought that perhaps, after  all, I did have something to offer you that you might be willing  to accept; and I know that your innate generosity will prompt you  to tell me whether you have already pledged yourself to another  man."  

The straightforward sincerity of his words caught Betty's  attention.  She looked long and fixedly into his eyes.  

"How is it with you and Beatrix Hunnewell?" she asked at  last.  

"Miss Hunnewell?" repeated Fairfax wonderingly.  "Why, we're  very good friends   —   that's all."  

Betty took a step nearer to him, her eyes still searching his  face.  

"I heard you were engaged," she said in a low voice.  

"Engaged!"  A look of incredulity leaped into the dark eyes.  "Who told you that?"  

"My aunt," answered Betty calmly, her eyes never leaving his  face.  

Well, it's a lie!" The strong jaw  snapped.  "There has  never been anything of that kind between us.  I admire Miss  Hunnewell beyond words, but   —   "  

He shrugged his shoulders impatiently.  Betty drew another  step nearer.  

"But"   —   there was a note almost of pleading in her voice   —     "you've been seeing a great deal of her this summer?"  

"Yes," assented Fairfax gravely, "I have. When you're  separated from the one who is more to you than life itself, it  sometimes makes existence easier if once in a while you hear  something about that person, and Miss Hunnewell was in touch with  you."  

"Oh!" said Betty faintly.  

Her face had turned very white, and her lips trembled.  Fairfax was watching her intently, a hurt look in his sensitive  eyes.  

"What a cad you think me!" he exclaimed bitterly, walking to  the window, where he stood gazing out, his hands thrust deep in  his pockets.  

Betty impulsively took a step after him.  Her breast, under  the white kerchief, was rising and falling tumultuously.  

"Fairfax!" she whispered timidly.  

But the man's shoulders squared themselves resolutely, and  the dark head proudly refused to turn.  Betty walked quietly  across the room and slipped her hand through his arm.  

"Fairfax, forgive me!" she pleaded softly.  

He turned quickly and caught her in his arms.  

"Darling!" he whispered passionately, pressing her to him.  "Don't you care for me just a little?  I love you, dear; I love  you   —   "  

But Betty struggled to free herself.  

"Let me go!  Let me go!" she breathed.  "I mustn't   —   oh,  please let me go!"  

Fairfax released her reluctantly.  

"But some day, Betty?"  

Betty stepped back.  

"Perhaps some day   —   perhaps when my father's name is cleared,"  she whispered brokenly.  "I shall never marry any one while any  stain rests on it."  

"Why, Betty!" exclaimed Fairfax impatiently.  "No one  believes   —   "  

"They *do!"* she interrupted vehemently.  "A great many  people believe that he was involved in something dishonorable  before he died!  When it's proved to be false, then I may think  of marrying.  Until then   —   "  

She shook her head resolutely.  A nurse appeared in the  doorway.  

"Miss Crosby," she said with a glance at Fairfax, "Dr.  Townsend wants you."  

Betty turned to Fairfax and held out her hand.  

"Good-by," she said hurriedly.  "Thank you again for coming  so far, and give my love to Uncle Tod!"  

Fairfax grasped her hand.  

"You had better write it to him; I sha'n't see him for some  time."  

"Why, aren't you going back?"  

She paused on her way to the door and looked back at him over  her shoulder.  

"By way of South Africa.  I'm going there to see Barney  Tutney.  He may be able to give me some points."  

"Barney Tutney?  Yes!" she mused.  "He would know.  You're  taking a great deal of trouble," she added softly.  

Fairfax laughed.  

"Trouble!" he repeated happily.  "Nothing is trouble that I  do for you.  I consider it a privilege to be able to do any  service for you or for your father.  You remember, I told you  that once before."  

"I remember.  Thank you again!"  

Once more Betty held out her hand; then she passed through  the door and sped along the hall and up the stairs.  

Fairfax got into the motor and hurried back to Paris.  His  firm mouth was drawn in a straight line, and his keen eyes looked  unseeing at the tragic scenes through which they passed.  

      
# XII

    A few days after Cary's visit a number of letters and papers  reached Elizabeth.  Except for an occasional note from Mrs.  Andrews, they brought the first news she had had from home since  her arrival in France, and she took them and ran to her room with  a little throb of excitement.  

Seating herself by the table which stood before the window,  she spread them out before her.  The letters were from Mrs.  Crosby, Beatrix Hunnewell, Major Barry, and Fairfax Cary.  

Cary's hastily scrawled line, written on the train, she read  first.  It was very short, and simply stated that he had started  for Cape Town, and would see her on his way home.  She slipped it  back into its envelope, a little smile parting her lips, and  picked up   one addressed in Mrs. Crosby's rather bold hand.  

Unconsciously Betty steeled herself.  She opened the letter,  and at the first words the smiling lips compressed themselves  into a straight line.  An angry flush spread over her face, and a  horrified expression widened her blue eyes.  Her face blanched,  and she turned the page with a hand that trembled.  

"Fairfax Cary!" she gasped.  "Never!  It's impossible!  It's  so inconceivable that it's ridiculous!"  

The letter had ended with the sentence:    

Your uncle and I met him on the train the evening of the  murder, and he told us he had just left the Delaneys.  His own  words are an absolutely conclusive proof.  Could any evidence be  more convincing?    

Elizabeth unfolded a newspaper clipping which her aunt had  enclosed, and in great black letters the words jumped at her:    

Sister of Well-Known jockey Found Murdered in Sheepshead Bay  Hotel   —   Prominent Lawyer Suspected   —   Patrick Delaney Dies in  Adjoining Room.    

Her eyes devoured the column of small type which described  how Molly Delaney's body had been discovered early on Saturday  morning by the doctor who had come to see Pat.  The boy was dead,  and Molly was found lying half on the bed, half on the floor of  her room, a bullet through her heart.  Although the room was in  great disorder, apparently nothing had been removed, for money  and jewelry lay scattered about, showing that burglary had not  been the motive for the crime.  

Various clues had been followed, the most conclusive  centering around Fairfax Cary, who had been seen by a number of  persons hurriedly leaving the hotel.  That he had been with the  Delaneys was testified by Michael Frost, the hall-boy, who had  conducted Cary to Pat Delaney's room shortly after seven o'clock.     To make the evidence doubly convincing, a letter from  Molly Delaney, written on the afternoon before the murder, and  requesting him to call as soon as possible, had been found in  Cary's office.  

Cary, in the mean time, had disappeared, and no trace of him  could be found.  It was not thought, however, that he would be  able to elude the police for very long, for descriptions of him  had been sent broadcast throughout the country, and his  apprehension was only a matter of time.  

With a gasp of dismay Betty let the paper flutter to the  table before her.  She rested her elbows on it, and her head  dropped into her hands.  In spite of the newspaper report, in  spite of her aunt's biting words, not even the shadow of a doubt  of Cary's innocence entered her mind.  It was impossible for her  to believe that the man who had left her so recently, whom her  father had respected and trusted, could be guilty of this  atrocious crime.  A hot burst of rage surged over her.  

"How could any one connect a man like that with murder?  It's  wicked!  Brutal!"  Her hands clenched, and she raised her head  defiantly.  "It's a lie!"  

But how to prove it?  

Her eves fell on the other letters which had come in the same  mail.  She opened the major's first and,  glancing hurriedly  through the first pages filled with tender reproaches,  concentrated her attention on the words that followed:    

Fairfax Cary has been implicated in a nasty scandal, out of  which I'm doing my best to extricate him.  The evidence against  him, however, is very strong, and I don't know how we're coming  out.  Whoever murdered Molly Delaney covered his tracks with  incredible cunning, and now that Pat is gone, it seems almost  impossible to get at the facts.  

Whether or not the boy died before the murder was committed,  we have been unable to ascertain.  We only know that Cary left  the hotel at about half past nine.  The question is, was the girl  alive when he went away?  This only Cary can answer.  Can you  tell me his whereabouts?  I've cabled to his address in Paris,  but have had no reply.  We need him and all the help we can get.  

Won't you please come home?    

"Dear Uncle Tod!" thought Betty penitently.  "He's a trump!  I'm afraid I haven't been very good to him."  

She picked up Trixie's note.  It was short and to the point:    DEAR BETSY:  

You must come home at once.  We need you to help us to clear  Fairfax Cary from this dreadful charge that's been brought  against him.  We shall expect you to stay with us.      As ever, affectionately,                              TRIXIE.    

Elizabeth gathered up the papers, dropped  them into a  drawer, and went in search of Dr. Townsend.  Hurriedly, and it  must be confessed rather incoherently, she explained to him that  she must return to New York at once.  

He gave his consent without comment.  It was only when he  stood by the motor which was to take her back to Paris that he  showed what it was costing him to let her go.  

"Good-by," he said gently, as he held her hand closely in his  big clasp.  "Will you come back to us?"  

"I want to, and I'll do my best," answered Betty; "but it all  depends   —   "  

"If you don't, I'll come to you," he declared, with a look  that sent the blood into Betty's face.  "This horror must be over  soon."  

"I hope so," agreed Betty fervently.  "Good-by, and thank you  again for being so good to me!"  

The motor started, and Betty, turning to wave her hand, saw  him as he stood before the low building, the sunlight glinting on  the gold of his hair and bringing into high relief the outlines  of his muscular frame.  

"That is a man!" she thought, and a feeling of self-reproach  came over her at the thought that she was deserting the post of  duty at the time of greatest need.  "I will surely come back!"  she hastened to assure herself.  "Only now it seems as if I must  go home!"  

Never before had the trip across the Atlantic seemed of such  interminable length, and it was almost in a frenzy of impatience  that Betty stood on the deck as the steamer passed through the  Narrows into New York Harbor and caught the first glimpse of the  jagged outlines of the city emerging from the golden October  haze.  She had cabled Major Barry when to expect her, and as the  vessel slipped smoothly into its berth, she scanned the waiting  crowd eagerly for the erect figure and jovial face.  

When she at last discovered him, in spite of his expression  of glad welcome, she saw at once from the anxious look that  lurked in his eyes that the situation had not improved.   But it  was not until they were seated in the Hunnewell motor, which  Trixie had sent for her, that Betty asked the question which she  had been restraining with difficulty ever since she landed.  

"Has the murderer been found?"  

Major Barry shook his head gloomily.  

"No, I'm sorry to say!"  

"And suspicion still rests on   —   "  

The major nodded, and the lips under the close-trimmed  mustache tightened.  

"It's outrageous!" he asserted savagely.  "The evidence is  purely circumstantial, but they've piled it up, and piled it up,  until really   —   "  He shook his head dubiously.  

"Have you engaged a lawyer?" asked Betty.  

"Oh, yes, of course, right away   —   Sturgis and Fellows, capital  men, both of them, and we're not leaving a stone unturned; but if  I could only get in touch with Cary!  Every minute that he's away  seems to strengthen the case against him."  

"How long will it take him to go to Cape Town and come back?"  asked Betty.  

The conviction was creeping over her that if it had not been  for her Fairfax could have cleared himself long ago.  

It may be a couple of months.  Everything is so unsettled now  that you can't tell how he'll be delayed."  

"Is there any chance of his being arrested there?"  

The major shrugged his shoulders.  

"You can't tell.  Sometimes, especially when you don't want  them to be, these detectives are deuced clever at finding things  out!"  

"I wish they'd devote their energies to the situation here!"  said Betty.  

The motor turned into Fifth Avenue and fell into line with  the endless procession of hurrying cars.  Betty looked at the  familiar scene with the eyes of an alien.  The well-known faces  framed in the windows of the swiftly passing limousines, smiling  and nodding to her in recognition when the traffic paused, gave  her a feeling of surprise that she should be remembered after the  long interval which had elapsed since she took her part in the  drama.  It seemed as if she were looking at the spectacle from a  great distance, as if it were being presented to her sight  through the wrong end of an opera-glass.  

The hurrying throngs on the streets passing in and out of the  handsome shops, the same intent, strained look on the faces as  the swinging doors swallowed or ejected them, forced themselves  on her consciousness, and a helpless feeling of futility seized  her.  So lately removed from the scenes of combat where men with  the courage born  of high resolve struggled desperately to  preserve the highest ideals of civilization   —   where they fought  and died that liberty, the most precious heritage of man, might  be transmitted as of old to the generations yet unborn   —   the  picture before her looked crude and cruel in its selfish luxury  and self-indulgence.  

"No one seems to care!" she breathed at last with a little  catch in her voice.  

"It isn't good form to show one's feelings," the major  reminded her whimsically, perceiving at once the trend of her  thoughts.  "But they're really not so heartless.  They're most of  them doing their bit; only, of course, they must have their good  times, too!" he added indulgently.  

"Are Uncle George and Aunt Maude in town?"  

"I imagine so.  I saw your uncle at the club yesterday."  

"Did he know I was coming back from France?"  An anxious look  crept into the blue eyes.  

"I told him."  

I'm not going back to them!" exclaimed Betty, the fire of  battle in her eyes.  

The major looked at her with eyes full of tender interest.  

"What are you going to do, my child?" he asked softly.  

They had reached the park, and Betty's eyes wandered to the  avenue of elms stretching their arms high above the path to clasp  those outstretched to them from the other side.  

"I don't know, Uncle Tod.  I can always go back to France."  

"Is France more alluring than home just now?" he asked  anxiously.  

"Well, not just now," admitted Betty slowly.  "When some one  who is sacrificing himself to do something for you gets into  difficulties himself, you naturally want to do your best to help  him out; but when it's all straightened out, why, then I'm going  back."  

A frown of disappointment appeared between the major's eyes.  

"Well, here we are," he remarked as the motor stopped before  the broad steps of the Hunnewells' house.  "I think I see Trixie  at the window."  

They passed up the steps and into the hall, and Trixie caught  Betty in her arms.  

"Oh, Betsy!" she exclaimed, a little break in her voice.  "How could you give us such a scare?"  

Betty put her arm around the girl, surprised and touched by  her exhibition of feeling.  

"I never thought it would make such a commotion," she said,  while a smile which was almost as bright as of old played over  her face.  

"Imagine!" exclaimed Trixie.  "Didn't you know we would care?  Have you heard anything new?" she asked, turning to the major.  

"Not a thing," he replied.  "I'm going down to see Sturgis  now."  

"But you'll come back?" asked Betty anxiously.  

"Yes, about five o'clock.  I may have something more to tell  you then"; and be ran briskly down the steps.  

"Come to your room," said Beatrix, drawing Betty toward the  stairs.  

They stopped to speak to Mrs. Hunnewell, who came out of her  boudoir to greet Elizabeth.  Contrary to Betty's expectations,  she gave the girl a warm welcome, and seemed to be delighted to  have her with them.  

"We've been hearing your praises sung so loudly for the past  month," she said, with a teasing glance at Beatrix, " that we're  overjoyed to have a visit from you."  

Elizabeth looked wonderingly at her, but Beatrix drew her up  the stairs without giving her time to reply.  

"Betsy's tired to death," she explained to her mother over  her shoulder.  "And Major Barry's coming back to tea.  She simply  must rest!"  

But when they reached Elizabeth's room Trixie's solicitude  for her friend's health seemed to vanish.  After having helped  Elizabeth to divest herself of her hat and coat, she drew her  into her own room and closed the door.  

"Betsy," she began abruptly, " is Tony Page in love with  you?"  

"Tony Page!  In love with me!" repeated Betty wonderingly.  "Mercy, no!  What ever put such an idea into your head?"  

"Oh, well, I wanted to be sure this time.  He talks  incessantly about you   —   how you saved his life and how brave you  are."  

Elizabeth laughed softly.  

"Ridiculous!  Even if I did, that doesn't mean he's in love  with me!  And as to the  bravery   —   "  She paused, and the  light died suddenly out of her face.  "Trixie, when your life  isn't worth two cents to you, it doesn't take more than two  cents' worth of courage to risk it.  And sometimes it takes all  the courage in the world   —   much more than you possess   —   to face the  prospect the future holds.  No, Trixie, it wasn't courage that  night; it was just the desire to end it all.  You see, I didn't  want to live."  The thrushlike voice faltered.  

"Is it different now, dear?"  

Elizabeth considered for a moment before answering.  

"Y-e-s," she hesitated.  " I don't want to die now; at least  not just yet."  

"What changed you, Betsy?"  

"I have something to do now   —   something that I *must* do!  

"And that?"  

"I'm determined to clear the names of my father and Fairfax  Cary.  I may be wrong, but the conviction is with me day and  night that when Molly Delaney's murderer is found, the stain on  my father's memory will be wiped away."  

Trixie came very close to Elizabeth and looked earnestly into  her eyes.  

"Betsy, who do you think did it?"  

"I don't know, Trixie; I haven't the faintest idea.  But one  thing I *do* know   —   I know it wasn't Fairfax Cary!"  

Beatrix nodded.  

"I know that, too," she agreed softly.  

Elizabeth looked at her intently.  

"Trixie," she said quickly, putting a hand through Trixie's  arm and drawing her to the lounge, "will you forgive me if I ask  you something?"  

"Why, of course, Betsy, ask anything you like.  I haven't  anything to hide   —   at least not yet!  

The bright color deepened under the cream of Trixie's skin,  and unconsciously her eyes strayed to a large photograph that  stood on her dressing-table.  Betty's eyes followed hers, and she  looked into Tony Page's smiling face.  For the first time since  her father's death her vivid smile played over her face.  

"I think, on the whole"   —   the flutelike cadence of her laugh  rang through the room   —   "I'll wait till then before I ask you!"  

"Why, Betsy!" began Beatrix, startled at the change in the  girl beside her.  "What do you mean?"  

Oh, nothing," replied Betty happily.  Only it's heavenly  being here with you, Trix!"  

"I know it's heavenly having you!"  

Trixie leaned over and kissed her warmly.  

      
# XIII

    Major Barry noticed the change as soon as he entered the  drawing-room at five o'clock and found the girls busily engaged  with the tea things.  

"What have you been doing to my goddaughter?" he asked,  smiling at Beatrix as he shook hands.  

The intervening hours had apparently had their effect on him,  too, for he had regained some of his old-time cheeriness.  

"Why, nothing special," replied Trixie wonderingly.  

"Well, she looks like a different girl, almost as if she had  anticipated the good news that reached me only a few minutes ago.  Cary's on his way home," he added joyfully, turning to Elizabeth.  

"Oh!" exclaimed Betty, coming eagerly to him.  "When will he  arrive?"  

"That I don't know, but I had a letter from Bordeaux, saying  that he would sail on the following day on the Rochambeau.  He  said he ran across Tutney at Madeira.  Odd, wasn't it?  And he  intimated that he had had a most satisfactory interview with  him."  

"That was strange," agreed Elizabeth.  

"Is Tutney coming back, too?"  

"I hardly think so   —   at least not just yet.  He expects to  come over before long, however, for he wants to make  investigations himself.  I gleaned from Cary's letter that things  are not quite to his liking."  

"I wonder when the Rochambeau is due?"  

Beatrix rang, and when the butler appeared she told him, to  bring the evening paper.  When it arrived Major Barry took it to  a lamp on a near-by table.  

"She's been sighted off Fire Island!" he exclaimed joyfully.  

"That means she'll dock early to-morrow morning."  

"You'll be there to meet him, won't you, Uncle Tod?" Betty  asked anxiously.  

"Don't worry your pretty head about that, my dear!  I'll be  there, if I have to camp out all night on the wharf.  I've kept  my campaigning outfit and am prepared for all emergencies," he  added whimsically.     

He folded the paper carefully and placed it behind the lamp.  A head-line had caught his eye which he did not care to have  Betty see.  Evidently the detectives, too, were aware of Cary's  proximity, and his arrival would doubtless be simultaneous with  his arrest; but this the major did not think it necessary for  Betty to know.  As it was, either apprehension or fatigue had  driven the happy light from her face.  

"Have the lawyers learned anything more?" she asked  fearfully.  

The major shook his head.  

"Not a thing.  As far as I can make out, it's all up to Cary.  If he can prove that Molly Delaney was alive when he left the  hotel, we're all right.  If he can't   —   "  

"Well?"  The word was hardly more than a breath.  

The major spread out his hands significantly.  

"Well!"  He hesitated a moment, then his eyes fell on her  troubled face.  "We'll have to establish his innocence in some  other way," he concluded with a hopefulness that he was far from  feeling.  

True to his word, the next morning found Major Barry waiting  impatiently, in the crisp air that was blowing in from the sea,  for the great black vessel creeping up the teeming river.  Near  him stood unobtrusively two men, who evidently considered him an  object of unusual interest, for they kept him constantly in  sight.  When he was joined by a short man with quick, alert eyes  and a pointed nose, they evinced ever-increasing satisfaction.  

"That's Sturgis, the lawyer," one of the men remarked in an  undertone to his companion.  

"I guess that settles it!" answered the other, a gleam of  triumph lighting his keen eyes.  

It was he who, when Fairfax Cary came quickly down the  gangway, stepped forward and said quietly:  

"We want you, Mr. Cary,"  

Fairfax stopped abruptly, and the hand that he had stretched  out in greeting to Major Barry fell to his side.  He looked at  the face at his shoulder inquiringly.  The second man appeared on  the other side.  

"Better come quietly, Mr. Cary," he remarked, turning back  his coat and revealing the shield pinned on his waistcoat.  "We'll explain later."  

Fairfax looked in a perplexed way at Major Barry.  

"It's a mistake, Fairfax, my boy, of course; but we'll just  jump into the taxi with these two gentlemen and talk it over on  the way.  This is Mr. Sturgis," he added, indicating the man  beside him.  

Fairfax bowed in a dazed way and accompanied the men as they  led the way to the street.  

"What's it all about, major?" he asked as they passed through  the crowd.  

"Something to do with Molly Delaney's murder," answered the  major, eying him keenly.  

"Molly Delaney!  Murdered!" gasped Fairfax.  "Why   —   who   —   "  

"Here we are!" exclaimed the major as they reached the curb.  "Will you meet us there, Sturgis?" he asked.  

A satisfied expression rested on his face, and his voice was  almost jovial.  

The short man assented, and the four took their places in the  taxi.  

When the major walked into the Hunnewells' drawing-room, two  hours later, he was rubbing his hands delightedly.  

"Just as we thought, Betty dear   —   that boy is no more  implicated in the murder than I am," he announced joyfully to  Elizabeth, who had left her seat on the sofa and came to meet  him.  "Whether he can prove it is another story.  He's convinced  that Molly was alive when he left.  He says he could distinctly  hear her talking."  

"To whom?" asked Betty quickly.  

"Ah, that he didn't say!"  

"Does he know?"  

"I imagine so, but he didn't tell us."  

"Why didn't he?  It may have been   —   probably was   —   the man who  killed her."  

The major shrugged his shoulders impatiently.  

"Yes, I know; but you know what quixotic ideas of honor Cary  has, and he didn't actually see the man, couldn't even recognize  his voice."  

Betty wrung her hands desperately.  

"When can I see him?" she asked suddenly.  

The major started.  

"See him?" he ejaculated.  

"Yes."  

"Oh, you could hardly do that!"  

"Why not?"  

Betty's fair head went up defiantly.     

"Why, because   —   my dear child, he's been arrested!  He's in  the Tombs!"  

"What difference does that make?"  

Betty's face was very white, but her eyes gazed unflinchingly  into the major's.  

"Why, you could hardly go there, you know!"  The major  paused; then he added:  "Of course, if you were his sister or his  wife, that would be different."  

"How different?" argued Betty rebelliously.  "He got into  this trouble doing something for me, and I insist on seeing him.  If you won't take me, I shall have to go alone!"  

The major groaned inwardly.  The determined expression on  Betty's face indicated that she was in deadly earnest.  

"Well, some time," he temporized.  

"This afternoon!" declared Betty emphatically.  "I'm going  this afternoon!"  

"Sturgis is trying to arrange about bail.  Couldn't you wait  until Cary's out?" pleaded the major.  

"I'm going this afternoon," repeated Elizabeth quietly.  "Now  will you take me?"  

The major acquiesced reluctantly.  

"Have you seen your aunt and uncle?" he asked on his way to  the door.  

Betty shook her head.  

"My dear child," expostulated the major,  

I really don't think you're treating them quite right.  After  all, you know, he's your father's brother, and they were very  good to you last summer."  

"I know," agreed Betty remorsefully.  "I must go.  I'll go  this afternoon, late.  Now go down and tell Fairfax I'm coming."  She took hold of the lapels of his coat and, raising herself on  her toes, kissed his cheek.  "You're such a dear!" she whispered  tremulously.  "I don't know what I should do without you!"  

Major Barry stroked her hair gently.  

"There, there," he said tenderly.  "I'm doing nothing at all,  nothing at all; but don't worry   —   I'm sure we shall be able to  straighten things out before long."  

But his optimism was all on the surface; for as he sped  down-town to hear the result of Sturgis's efforts to get Cary out  on bail, he gave himself over unreservedly to the depression that  had gradually been closing in on him.  

"No matter how hard one may try to put a cheerful face on  it," he thought gloomily, "the fact remains that the situation is  extremely grave."  

And in this Sturgis agreed when he met him in front of the  Tombs and they stopped for a few minutes' talk before going in.  Bail had been refused, and the outlook was far from reassuring.  

      
# XIV

    But Major Barry had thrown off his air of depression by the  time he and Sturgis reached Cary's cell.  He patted Fairfax on  the shoulder as he rose to meet them.  

"Well," he began cheerily, "luck's against us for the time  being, my boy!  The powers that be won't listen to any talk of  bail."  

A quiver passed over the finely chiseled features.  Major  Barry went on:  

"So there's nothing to do but to establish your innocence as  quickly as possible.  Now, how are we going to do it?"  

He and Sturgis sat down on the chairs, and Fairfax dropped  down on the cot.  Fairfax shrugged his shoulders hopelessly.  

"I only know that the girl was alive when I left the hotel.  As to conjecturing who killed her, you can do that as well as I."  

He pressed his hand wearily against the back of his head.  

"Who was with her when you left, Mr. Cary?" asked the lawyer.  

"That I can't tell you."  

"It may give us the clue that will enable us to exonerate  you."  

Cary considered for a moment in silence, while the two men  searched his face anxiously.  

"I prefer not to express an opinion as to who it was," he  replied at last, "I didn't see the man or recognize his voice."  

"Well," said Sturgis, rising, "I know Major Barry has other  matters to discuss with you, so I'll leave you."  

He called to a guard who was passing and disappeared into the  corridor.  

"Now," began the major, drawing his chair closer to Cary,  "tell me about Tutney.  It was extraordinary your finding him as  you did!"  

Fairfax came out of the abstraction that had fallen on him  and fixed his dark, penetrating eyes on the major's face.  

"Yes," he assented, "it was great luck.  He had just arrived  from Cape Town, and was, I think, as glad to see me as I was to   run across him.  He asked me at once about Randolph Crosby's  affairs.  It seems that he and Mr. Crosby and a number of other  men had formed a syndicate to develop this diamond-mine, with an  agreement that no one should sell his interest without first  giving the other directors a chance to buy it.  Shortly after Mr.  Crosby's death a large block of the stock was offered at public  sale.  Tutney, when he heard of it, was naturally a good deal  upset, and immediately suspected that the stock was Mr. Crosby's.  He evidently felt pretty badly about it, for he realizes what the  future of the property will be, and he knew what a mistake it was  to sell before its true value was reached.  He's a great admirer  of Miss Crosby, and I know he felt that if his supposition were  correct, and the stock was her father's, that her executor didn't  have her best interests at heart."  

The major nodded, and remarked ironically:  

"He's a man of much perception!"  

"He asked me who the trustees were," continued Fairfax; "and  when I told him that George Crosby was sole executor, he didn't  seem overpleased.  He said he thought it was a mistake to entrust  a big estate like that to any one man, even though you had  unlimited confidence in him.  The chances for mistakes in  judgment alone were too great."  

"Then he thought the property was a large one?" queried the  major quickly.  

"Yes; he said he knew it was.  He scoffed at the idea that  Mr. Crosby had made unwise investments.  He said any one who knew  Randolph Crosby at all knew him for a sagacious business man,  keen, and of remarkable acuteness, while at the same time he had  an unusual sense of obligation and honor."  

"Did you tell him that the entire fortune was gone, and that  Crosby's daughter was working to support herself?"  

Fairfax nodded.  

"I asked him if it were possible, and he said not unless the  trustee had mishandled the estate."  

"Just as I thought!"  The major leaned forward and tapped  Fairfax lightly on the knee.  "Mark my words, boy, George Crosby  and that precious son of his have made away with that child's  money!  Now, it's going to be my business to find out where and  how it has gone."  He straightened up.  "Betty wants to see you,"  he concluded abruptly.  

Fairfax started.  He glanced around the bare cell, at the  stone walls, the iron door, and barred window through which a  shaft of light slanted and lay in stripes across the cold floor.  

"Here?" he breathed, a look of distress coming into his  haggard eyes.  

"Insists on it, my boy," continued the major briskly.  "And,  Fairfax, when you've known Betty as long as I have, you'll  realize that when she makes up her mind   —   "  He spread out his  hands and shook his head helplessly, an indulgent smile twitching  at the corners of his mouth.  "You know what an old fool I am  about her   —   simply can't refuse her anything.  I don't have to  tell you that I'm not particularly anxious to have her come here.  No reflection on you, of course, but   —   well, it isn't just the  thing under the circumstances   —   you understand?"  

He looked a little pleadingly into the younger man's face.  

"Of course," Fairfax assented gravely.  "I understand  perfectly."  

"Well, she's coming, just the same.  Says she has something  of the utmost importance to tell you."  

"When will she come?" Cary asked huskily.  

"This afternoon, about three."  

Cary took a turn up and down the cell and stopped before the  major.  

"Has what she is going to tell me got anything to do with Dr.  Townsend?"  

His voice sounded harsh and strained.  

"Don't know, I'm sure."  

The major looked sympathetically at him.  He did not add that  Betty had said that she intended shortly to return to France.  

"If that's what she's coming to tell him, he'll know it soon  enough," he thought pityingly.  "I know what the poor boy's going  through, and suspense, hard as it is to bear, is better than  despair."  

He patted Fairfax on the shoulder and bade him good-by,  promising to return after luncheon.  

If Elizabeth experienced any feelings of trepidation as she  left the warm sunshine and entered the ominous chill of the  massive gray building, Major Barry, who was watching her closely,  failed to detect it.   Even when the door was unlocked and  they entered the long passage where tier upon tier of cells  looked down upon them, each with its tragic-faced inmate tense  with suppressed revolt or huddled in passive lethargy, she  retained her expression of calm.  

The guard stopped before a door and inserted the key.  It  opened, and Betty stepped into the cell.  The door clanged back  into place and the lock clicked.  

Fairfax rose and turned quickly toward her.  His face was  very white, but there still clung to him his air of proud  reserve, and the dark eyes looked out fearless and unashamed from  under the straight brows.  

Betty came quickly to him and held out her hand.  He  hesitated for a moment, and then, taking it, held it closely in  his.  

"It was very good of you to come," he said in a hushed voice.  

Betty laughed a little tremulously.  

"Now we're quits!" she exclaimed.  That's what I said to you  in the hospital!"  

A semblance of a smile parted the sensitive lips.  He  indicated the chair beside which they stood.  After Betty had  seated herself, he sank once more on the cot and fixed his eyes  on the shifting bars of light.  

Betty pressed her hands tightly together in her lap, and a  lump rose in her throat.  Her eyes rested pitifully on the bowed,  dark head.  She swallowed hard; then, rising suddenly, she ran to  the cot, seated herself beside him, and put her arm around his  neck.  

"Oh, my dear, my dear!" she whispered brokenly, laying her  cheek against his.  "I didn't tell you the truth that time in  France.  I do care, Fairfax.  I love you, dear!"  

A tremor passed over Fairfax.  He clenched his hands until  the knuckles showed white.  

"Don't!" he breathed hoarsely.  "Don't, for God's sake!"  

"Don't what?" Betty drew back, and her great eyes,  pansy-black in the uncertain light, rested on the white, averted  face.  

"You don't realize what you're doing!"  

Betty looked relieved.  

"Oh, yes, I do," she asserted.  "I realize perfectly what I'm  doing.  I'm telling the man I honor above everything on earth  that I love him.  It's high time that he knew, for I've suddenly  discovered that I've loved him for a very long time   —   much longer  than I had any idea of!"  

Cary got up suddenly and, walking with quick, nervous steps  to the door of his cell, placed his hands on the grating.  He  shook it slightly; then he turned back to Betty, who had taken a  step after him.  

"It's real!" he whispered huskily.  "Sometimes I think it  must be a dream, and I have actually to go and feel the locked  door before I can believe it.  "But now," he went on, the look of  pain deepening in his eyes, "those bars have begun to press in on  me closer and closer, until I can feel them on my forehead.  I  know in time they'll reach my soul, and then I shall never be  able to wipe away the taint!"  

He strode past her and, sinking once more on the cot, buried  his face in his hands.  

"Fairfax!" Betty ran to him, sat down beside him, and put her  arm around his shoulder.  "You mustn't have such dreadful  thoughts!  Nothing can taint your soul but sin, and, darling,  your friends know how far that is from you!"  

Again a tremor passed over him.  

"You don't know, no one knows until he's been locked in, what  it means to be caged in a place like this, with the knowledge  that no power on your part can get you out!  It's hideous,  horrible!" he whispered hoarsely.  "The iron eats into your  soul!"  

Betty laid her hand on his head and drew it gently to her  until it rested on her shoulder.  Stooping over, she pressed her  lips to his forehead.  

"Darling," she whispered, "I love you!"  

A great sob shook Fairfax.  He raised himself and drew  resolutely away.  

"I should deserve to be kicked if I took what your pity and  gratitude are prompting you to give!" he said.  "No; I love you  too dearly to allow you to sacrifice yourself for a man who has  passed through an ordeal like this!"  

Once more the dark head sank into his hands.  

"Fairfax, that's absurd!  You wanted to marry me when a stain  rested on my name   —   "  

"That's very different," he broke in.  "The discredit in no  way reflected on you."  

"And if it had, would it have prevented you from loving me?"  

"Never!"  The word was sharp and decisive.  

"Well," exclaimed Betty, with a little laugh of triumph,  "then that's settled!"     

"What's settled?"  

"That we're to be married!"  

"Miss Crosby, don't you understand   —   "  

"Don't call me Miss Crosby!" interrupted Betty imperiously.  "And as to understanding, why"   —   her voice softened   —   "the big fact  remains that we love each other, dear, and after that nothing  matters.  Dear heart, you do love me, don't you?"  

Fairfax groaned and pressed his hands closer over his eyes.  

"You're the most difficult man I ever proposed to," remarked  Betty, with a tremulous little laugh.  "Well, if you won't be  nice, I'm going to ask you a question.  Who was in the room with  Molly Delaney that night when you were talking to Pat?"  

Fairfax did not answer.  

"Answer me, Fairfax!"  

"I don't know.  At least, I'm not sure."  

"But you have a strong suspicion?"  

"You can't implicate a man in a crime like this on a  suspicion."  

"But if that suspicion led to a correct solution?"  

"It might not, and then it would bring unnecessary pain to  innocent people.  I know too much about that to be willing to  inflict it on others," he concluded bitterly.  

Betty sat for a moment wrapped in thought.  

"If we could only get at the motive," she said, half to  herself, "it might be a clue!  Why should any one want to kill  the girl?  Do you know any reason?"  

Fairfax moved restlessly.  

"It's hard to tell," he answered evasively.  "With people  like that there are so many reasons.  It might have been  jealousy, fear of exposure, any one of half a dozen things."  

"Well, I sha'n't rest night or day till I find out."  Betty  rose as the guard inserted his key in the lock.  "I'll see you  again soon."  

"Did you learn anything?" asked Major Barry anxiously, when  she joined him in the waiting-room.  

Betty shook her head dejectedly.  

"He absolutely refuses to tell who it was.  Uncle Tod, I want  to go down to Sheepshead Bay and look through those rooms.  I'm  convinced that there must be something there that will give us a  clue."  

"But, my dear child, the detectives have searched them  thoroughly."  

"Yes, I know," Betty assented obstinately.  "But it may be  the only chance of saving him!"  

She was very pale, but her chin was firm and resolute.  

"I'll try to arrange it, but I'm afraid there isn't much  hope.  Where are you going now?"  

"To the Crosbys'.  I want to tell them of my engagement to  Fairfax."  

"What?"  

The major stopped in the crowded street along which they were  walking on their way to the Elevated train and looked aghast at  the girl's calm face.  

"Why, Uncle Tod," she exclaimed, "you don't mean to tell me  you didn't know?"  

"Know!  Know what?"  

"Why, that we love each other!"  

"I knew that Cary loved you, and I suspected that you cared  for him; but really, Betty, I hardly think that   —   at present, if I  were you   —   I would   —   "  

"You hardly think that now's the time for me to tell the  world of my belief in Fairfax's innocence?" she said defiantly.  "You'll have to forgive me for differing with you.  I can't  imagine any time more appropriate!"  

The major looked at her with a gleam of admiration in his  eyes.  The color had mounted in her cheeks, and her eyes shone  bright under the level brows.  

"Of course, my dear," he answered in a conciliatory voice,  "we all believe that Fairfax is innocent.  Tell me, how does Cary  feel about it?"  

The dimple under Betty's eye came into play, and she broke  into a little laugh.  

"Oh, he says he won't marry me!"  

The major looked relieved.  

"He means, of course, not till this mess is straightened  out."  

They crossed the street and passed up the steps to the  Elevated.  When they were seated in the train Betty answered.  

"I don't know what he means," she said.  "I only know that  I'm going to marry him as soon as possible."  

"Well, you modern girls certainly know your own minds!"  remarked the major.  "Now, in my day if was customary   —   "  

"To wait until we were asked?" interposed Betty merrily.  "Well, things have changed, Uncle Tod; now  it's the other way  round.  You men don't realize it, but it's  really the women  who do the proposing.  We let the men think the old custom is  still in force.  It makes them happier, and doesn't alter the  fact!"  

      
# XV

    But after she had said good-by to the major at her uncle's  door and had entered the hall, the happy look faded from  Elizabeth's face, and was replaced by one of firm resolve.  She  foresaw a struggle, and with characteristic energy determined to  have it over as quickly as possible.  

She went into the familiar drawing-room, and a slight feeling  of surprise came over her at finding it exactly as it had been in  the spring.  The furniture stood in its accustomed places; the  same photographs looked at her from their silver frames; the same  copy of Omar Khayyam lay on the table by the same vase, which was  filled as of old with pink carnations.  Everything was just as  she had left it; but, in spite of its familiarity, a different  spirit brooded over the room, subtly conveying an impression of  suspense, of dread.  

"Absurd!" thought Betty, with a little shake of her  shoulders.  "I'm getting abnormally imaginative!  It's I who have  changed!"  

She heard a step in the hall, and Mrs. Crosby parted the  portieres and walked into the room.  In spite of the carefully  shaded light, in spite of her elaborate mauve tea-gown and  artistic make-up, Betty was shocked at her aunt's appearance.  

"Aunt Maude," she exclaimed, deep concern in her voice,  "you've been ill!"  

Mrs. Crosby kissed the girl's cheek mechanically and  dismissed the question with a wave of her jeweled hand.  

"Come into the library," she said.  "Your uncle is there."  

They crossed the hall and entered the luxurious room.  George  Crosby rose from a deep chair by the fire and came slowly toward  Betty.  He kissed her affectionately and, turning back to the  fire, dropped again into his seat.  

He held out his hands to the blaze.  They were thin and  wrinkled, and twitched spasmodically, and in the light of the  fire his face showed gray and haggard.  

"You've been gone a long time, Elizabeth," began Mrs. Crosby  in a curiously restrained voice.  She had seated herself in the  corner of a sofa, on the other side of the fire, and Betty sank  down beside her.  "Do you think you have been very kind to us?"  

Betty moved uneasily, and did not answer her aunt's question.  

"Your uncle has hardly slept or eaten since you left," Mrs.  Crosby went on plaintively; " and I   —   "  She paused significantly.  

"Oh, I'm so sorry!" exclaimed Betty penitently.  "I had no  idea you would care!"  

George Crosby turned his sunken eyes to her.  

"Care?" he repeated dully.  

What made you think we wouldn't care?" asked Mrs. Crosby  reproachfully.  "It has been a dreadful six weeks!  I only hope  you will never know such suffering and anxiety as you have caused  us!"  

Betty's lip trembled.  

"Oh, Aunt Maude," she whispered, "I wasn't happy, either; but  I couldn't stay   —   I had to do something!"  

"You might at least have told us where you were.  We had no  idea, and it isn't safe for young girls   —   "  

"Yes, I know, aunt.  Believe me, I'm very sorry."  

A silence fell on them, broken only by the crackling of the  flames and the subdued snap of a log as it broke in the middle  and parted in a shower of sparks.  

"Where are you stopping?" asked Mrs. Crosby at last.  

"With the Hunnewells."  

"Oh!" Mrs. Crosby glanced furtively at the girl's pure  profile as she gazed past her into the fire.  "I can imagine that  Mrs. Hunnewell is very happy over Beatrix's escape."  

"Escape?" repeated Betty in a bewildered voice and with an  inquiring look at her aunt.  

"Yes   —   from her engagement to Fairfax Cary."  

"Oh!" said Betty slowly.  "That never existed."  

"How do you know?" asked Mrs. Crosby sharply.  

"Both Trixie and Fairfax told me," answered Betty.  "I am  going to marry Fairfax Cary," she added quietly.  

"What?" exclaimed her uncle and aunt simultaneously.  

A happy smile illumined the girl's face.     

"Yes," she went on, the thrushlike lilt ringing in her voice,  "he came to see me in France, and asked me to marry him."  

"Was this after the murder?"  

Betty nodded.  

"Yes; he sailed early the following morning, before he knew  about it."  

"Before any one else knew about it," interposed Mrs. Crosby  bitingly.  "But of course he has absolved you of your promise  now?"  

Betty laughed.  

"Oh, I refused to marry him when he asked me; but later I  found that I loved him and couldn't live without him, so this  afternoon I told him so."  

"Where did you see him?" asked George Crosby.  

"At the Tombs," replied Betty calmly.  Uncle Tod took me."  

"Tod Barry took you to the Tombs!" exclaimed Mrs. Crosby  incredulously.  

Betty nodded, and again her face was illumined by a bright  smile.  

"So now we're engaged," she concluded happily at least I am  to him.  I suppose he isn't engaged to me, for he refuses to  marry me!"  

"I'm glad he has some sense of honor left!"  

George Crosby sank back into his chair, a relieved expression  stealing over his face.  Betty's eyes dilated, but her voice was  quiet and controlled as she replied:  

"That's the trouble   —   he has an exaggerated sense of honor.  If it were not for that we should know, or at least have a very  definite idea, who Molly Delaney's murderer is.  Fairfax knows  who was with her while he was talking to Pat, but he won't tell!  

A step had been coming along the hall, and when she finished  speaking Betty looked up into Norman's livid face.  

"Hello, Betty!" he exclaimed in a voice which he was  evidently struggling to make sound natural.  "So you've left your  wounded soldiers?"  

"Yes," answered Betty gravely, looking searchingly at the  shrunken figure and restless, glittering eyes.  "I thought just  now I was needed more here."  

"That nursing business has been run into the ground, anyway",  observed Norman{sic}  He lit a cigarette and inhaled a deep  breath of the smoke.  "Just a fad!"  

"You wouldn't think so if you had ever been in one of those  hospitals and seen the need!" retorted Betty quickly.  "It's  terrible!  All that unspeakable agony   —   sorrow   —   death   —   "  

The boy started nervously.  

"Death!" he exclaimed passionately.  "The whole world's gone  mad on the subject!  Can't we keep away from it?"  He paced the  room with quick, short steps.  "It's got to a point where it's a  morbid obsession with people.  You hear it talked about wherever  you go!  You read it in every book, magazine, newspaper.  It  positively jumps at you from every street corner until your  brain's fairly reeling!  I should think at least in one's own  home one could keep it out!"  

He stopped at a mahogany chest that stood on a small table  and, taking out a bottle, poured whisky into a glass.  Raising  the glass high above his head, his eyes burning feverishly, he  exclaimed hoarsely:  "To hell with death!" and gulped down the  yellow liquid.  

Norman!" exclaimed his mother in a horrified voice.  "What  *is* the matter with you?  I've never seen any one change as you  have in the past few weeks!"  She looked meaningly at Elizabeth.  "It's been like this ever since you left us at Newport!"  

Norman dropped heavily into a chair by the table.  

"Let's go away, mater, somewhere where it's warm and sunny.  This beastly chill has got into my bones."  

He shivered and drove his hands deep into his  trouser-pockets.  

"Come to the fire, dear," urged his mother.  "Where would you  like to go?"  

Don't care, only let's start soon   —   tomorrow, if you can get  off."  

"Well, hardly to-morrow, dear; there isn't such desperate  haste as all that, surely.  The next day, perhaps."  She  considered thoughtfully for a moment and added:  "We might go to  the Hot Springs."  

"For Heaven's sake, don't go where there are a lot of prying,  gossiping people!" exclaimed Norman hastily.  "Can't we take a  sea trip to Rio, or some place like that?"  

"Mercy!" expostulated Mrs. Crosby.  "That's an interminable  way off!"  

"That's just what I want   —   an interminable way off.  Come with  us, Betty!"  

Betty shook her head.     

"No; I've important work to do here," she announced.  

"What?"  

The boy eyed her narrowly.  

"I'm going to find Molly Delaney's murderer."  

For a moment no one spoke, and a tense stillness settled over  the room.  Then, as if unable to bear it, Norman jumped up.  

"Well, I wish you luck!" he said huskily and disappeared  through the door.  

"He's been like that ever since you refused to marry him,"  said Mrs. Crosby, looking reproachfully at the pale face beside  her.  "As I told you at Newport, you could have done everything  in the world for him, Betty; and now there are times when I'm  really anxious about him.  Don't you think you could come with us  on this trip?  It might mean saving the boy from   —   "  She stopped.  

Betty stared into the many-colored flames as they darted up  the chimney, a feeling of apprehension clutching at her heart.  This, then, and not the worry over her disappearance, was the  reason for the atmosphere of anxiety and suspense that hung over  the household.  But, in spite of the fact that her heart was  swelling with sympathy, she could not bring herself to leave New  York just now.  

"I'm sorry, Aunt Maude," she faltered.  "If you'll only  postpone the trip a little I might, but now   —   it's absolutely  impossible.  You must see that."  

She looked pleadingly at her aunt.  

"Do you think yourself cleverer than the police?" asked her  uncle suddenly.  

Betty spread out her hands desperately.  

"I don't know, Uncle George.  I only know that I've got to  stay and do what I can.  You see, I have a feeling that I may be  able to discover why father   —   "  

"Why father what?" asked George Crosby sharply.  

"Why people were so unkind to him just before he died, and  how he came to make such unfortunate investments.  It's all so  confused and unexplainable now, and I do so want to straighten it  out!  You must understand how I feel, don't you, Uncle George?"  

She turned to him, eager for his sympathy and indorsement;  but George Crosby did not reply.  He sank deeper into his chair  and covered his eyes with his shaking hand.  

The tall clock in the corner struck six in silvery tones, and  Betty rose quickly.  

"I must go," she announced hurriedly.  "I had no idea it was  so late!"  

"Shall I order the motor for you?" asked her aunt.  

"Oh, no, thank you, aunt.  It's only a step to Trixie's."  

She kissed them both and passed out into the hall.  Norman  came out of the drawing-room.  

"I'll walk back with you," he said, taking his hat and gloves  from the hall table.  

He opened the door, and they stepped out into the sharp night  air.  

"Betty," he began, as soon as they reached the sidewalk, " I  wouldn't get mixed up in this Fairfax Cary mess if I were you.  It won't do any good; and you can't afford   —   no girl can   —   to have  your name connected with a scandal like that."  

Betty straightened herself stiffly.  

"As I'm going to change my name to Cary before long, I'm  naturally more anxious to get Fairfax out of this trouble than I  am to guard the name of Crosby!" she retorted bruskly.  

"Betty," exclaimed Norman, stopping abruptly and staring at  her, "you're *not* you're not going to marry that   —   "  

"I am," interposed Betty calmly; "so don't make too many  derogatory remarks about your future cousin!"  

"Well, if that's the case, I've nothing further to say!"  

They walked on to the Hunnewells' house in silence, and  Norman rang the bell.  The door was opened, and with a hurried  good night he raised his hat and ran down the steps, leaving  Betty to enter the luxurious warmth.

    It was with steps heavy from fatigue that Major Barry entered  the dark hall of his little apartment that evening, at about half  past nine o'clock, and switched on the light.  He took off his  hat and coat in the tiny hall and, going into the sitting-room,  lit the lamp.  In his hand he held several letters.  He settled  himself in the comfortable chair by the table and, raising the  lid of the humidor, took up his pipe and filled it leisurely.  

"It certainly is good to have a little quiet at last," he  said half aloud.  "You must be  getting old, Tod; you can't  stand the pace the way you used to.  This last month has taken it  out of you, my boy!"  

He lit his pipe and, placing his glasses, with their broad,  black ribbon, on his nose, took up the pile of letters and ran  over the addresses.  

"Wonder whose writing this is?" he soliloquized, gazing  thoughtfully at one addressed in a tight, cramped hand.  He broke  open the flap and took out the folded sheet.  It was a short note  from Barney Tutney, written from the Rossmore Hotel, asking when  he might see the major.  

Major Barry's hand shot out toward the telephone on the table  beside him.  He gave the number of Tutney's hotel, and in five  minutes had arranged an immediate interview with him at the  apartment.  He hung up the receiver, a look of grim resolve on  his face.  

When the bell rang, a little later, he jumped to the door,  all trace of his fatigue gone.  He grasped Tutney's hand in  cordial welcome, helped him off with his coat, and drew him into  the cozy room.  

"Sit down, Tutney," he said.  "Do you smoke?"  He opened the  humidor, and Tutney selected a cigar.  "I'm smoking a pipe," he  went on.  "I find it great company when I'm alone."  

The major held a match to the other man's cigar and studied  his face as he drew in the smoke.  

"I'm very glad you decided to come over so soon," he  remarked, settling himself back in his chair.  

Tutney took the cigar from his mouth and examined the lighted  end critically.  

"I thought it was about time," he answered slowly.  "By the  bye, I'm mighty sorry about Cary."  He looked sharply at the  major from under his shaggy eyebrows.  

"A bad business!" admitted the major.  He puffed a moment in  silence, then he added quietly:  "Of course, he had absolutely no  connection with the murder."  

"Of course not," agreed Tutney.  "But, just the same, I guess  there are people who are glad to have him where he is   —   out of  mischief!"  

"Perhaps those same people won't be overjoyed to hear of your  return," remarked the major grimly.  

"Probably not   —   probably not!"  The keen eyes snapped.  "Things weren't goin' exactly right, and it don't do to let 'em  get away from you.  It's much better to take a hand in the  beginnin', and oftentimes you can prevent a landslide."  

"Yes," assented the major gravely.  "But in this instance I'm  afraid we're too late.  I blame myself   —   "  

"You couldn't do nothin', Major Barry," interposed the man,  replacing the cigar in his mouth.  He took a long puff and  watched the smoke float off into the shadows.  "How could you  know how things were goin'?  Now, if I'd been here, instead of in  South Africa, things might have been different.  When that stock  was put up for sale I could have stepped right in."  

"Are you sure it was Crosby's?"  

"There ain't no doubt of it.  The transaction was pretty well  covered up, but I've managed to trace the brokers, and now I have  my proofs.  George Crosby's been speculatin' pretty heavily the  last three months; and, besides, he got mixed up in a shyster  rubber scheme, and from what I can learn, lost a pile of money in  it."  

Tutney stopped, and a great cloud of smoke rose around his  head.  

"Do you think there is any possibility of getting the  estate   —   what is left of it   —   out of his hands?"  

"Well, of course that's a question for a lawyer; but from the  evidence I've been able to gather, I think Miss Crosby has a  mighty strong case against her uncle.  To my mind, there ain't no  question but what she can force him to make good.  There'd have  to be a lawsuit, of course."  

"That's the trouble; I don't know whether she would consent  to it."  

"She'll make a big mistake if she don't.  If she waits for  the three years to be up before she demands an accounting, there  won't be anything left.  It don't seem possible," Tutney  ruminated, "that Randolph Crosby's pile should all be gone in  four months and his daughter workin' for a livin'!  Well, it's  the first and last time, to my knowledge, that Mr. Crosby got  fooled in his man.  He thought an awful sight of his brother."  

"Which makes George Crosby's behavior just that much more  reprehensible," said Major Barry indignantly.  

Tutney agreed and rose to go, promising to have his testimony  ready at any time it was needed if a lawsuit were decided upon.     

For a long while after Tutney left Major Barry sat puffing at  his pipe and staring into the shadows.  On his usually genial  face was the expression it had worn when he and his command  pursued Red Wolf's band after the massacre of Pine Notch.  If the major had been the judge, in spite of his kindly heart,  there would be as little clemency shown in this as in the other  case.  

However, he decided to postpone telling Betty of his  discovery until the web which entangled Fairfax Cary was  untangled.  

"The poor child has quite enough to worry her," he thought  regretfully as he rose and switched off the light; "and she's  really fond of her uncle."  

Contrary to the major's predictions, he did obtain permission  to visit the Delaneys' rooms, and the next morning he and Betty  motored down to the hotel at Sheepshead Bay, where a detective  met them.  They mounted the steep stairs and passed down the  narrow hallway, with its unwholesome wall-paper and threadbare  carpet.  There was a portentous chill in the stale air, and  Elizabeth shivered a little as the detective stopped before one  of the closed doors and inserted the key.  

The door opened, and they entered the jockey's room,  evidently untouched since the day after his death.  It looked  neglected and desolate, with its unmade bed, half-open bureau  drawers, and scattered papers.  In one corner lay a crumpled  red-silk shirt next to a stained pair of riding-breeches, and  standing near was a riding-boot, its mate lying beside it.  By  the bed stood a small table, its baize cover gray with dust.  In  the mirror of the ash chiffonier was a snap-shot picture of  Randolph Crosby.  

A sob clutched at Betty's throat, but she resolutely forced  it back.  She glanced at the door, slightly ajar, which led into  the adjoining room.  

"I should like to go in there first," she said to the  detective.  

"Very well, Miss Crosby!"  

He pushed back the door and let her pass.  The men followed,  and instinctively the major took off his hat.  

The room was in great disorder.  A trunk half filled with a  motley array of garments stood in front of the window.  On a  chair gaped a suit-case, out of which trailed a worn shirt-waist.  On the top of the bureau was a mass of toilet articles,  cosmetics, ribbons, veils, and gloves.  

The mantel was littered with photographs of actors and  actresses, jockeys and trainers.  On one corner of it, on a  stand, rested Molly's best hat.  It was the one she had worn at  the races on the afternoon before Randolph Crosby's death, and  Betty saw once more the girl's audacious face sparkling under the  crimson feather and purple rose.  

The remembrance of that last happy afternoon brought the hot  tears of regret into Betty's eyes, and to hide them she turned  quickly to the mantel.  She took up the hat and with gentle  fingers brushed off the dust which lay thick on the drooping  feather.  A large photograph that stood behind the stand fell  forward, disclosing a small, round object set in the wall.  

"Why, what is that?" asked Betty.  

Grimes, the detective, who had been idly turning over some  old newspapers on a table near the window, came quickly to her  side.  Betty pointed to the wall.  

"Well, if that don't beat all!" he said under his breath.  "How do you suppose we came to pass that up?"  

"What is it?"  

The major left his place by the door, where he had lingered,  and the expression of extreme distaste which had fixed itself on  his face turned to one of liveliest interest.  

Grimes's fingers ran lovingly over the little round disk.  

"That's a dictograph.  I wonder who put it there, and why he  done it!  

The sharp, gray eyes narrowed, and he stepped toward the door  that led into Pat's room, the major following.  

Betty took an irresolute step after them and stopped.  Her  eyes fell upon the bed against which Molly had been found, and as  if drawn by a power she could not resist, she walked slowly to  it.  She stood for a moment gazing down upon it, her imagination  painting in vivid colors the last scene in the girl's life.  

In the weeks of her hospital work, death had in a measure  lost its horror for her, but this was different; this was death  in its most revolting form, without the nobility of  self-sacrifice.  It was sordid, hideous, repulsive!  A shudder  passed over her, and she turned quickly, as if to rid herself of  the  room and its associations, when her eye was caught by  the glint of something bright in the space between the mattress  and the wooden side of the bed.  

She stooped down and saw, lying on the slats, a small  glittering object.  From the other room came the indistinct  murmur of the men's voices, broken once by an exclamation from  the detective.  Betty hastily put her hand into the narrow space;  when she drew it out it held a gold cigarette-case.  The case was  half open, and the cigarettes under the gold bar were stained and  dark.  Betty looked at it, her eyes widening in horror.  

Steps sounded behind her.  

"That was a great find you made, Miss Crosby," said a voice  at her shoulder.  "Now, if we can discover why it was put there,  and what went through it the night of the murder, I guess we'll  have our man, all right!"  

Elizabeth started violently and turned quickly, involuntarily  keeping the hand that held the cigarette-case behind her.  

The detective eyed her curiously.  

"Have you found anything else?" he asked.  

"Oh, no," answered Betty faintly.  

Major Barry had joined them, and was standing beside her.  At the man's words he, too, fastened his eyes on the girl's  strained face.  

"What have you in your hand?" demanded Grimes.  

The blood receded from Betty's face, and she turned  pleadingly to the major.  

"Oh, nothing   —   nothing!  Tell him it isn't anything!" she  begged piteously.  

"Miss Crosby"   —   the detective spoke impressively   —   "in the name  of the law, I ask you to tell me what you have found."  

He stepped toward her, and Betty, slowly drawing her hand  from behind her back, held out the cigarette-case.  Grimes seized  it and examined it closely.  

"Blood!" he exclaimed under his breath.  

Where did you find it?"  

"There," replied Betty in a hardly audible whisper, pointing  to the bed.  

"Slipped out of his pocket when he stooped over the girl!"  mused Grimes.  He turned the case over, searching for a mark on  it.  A monogram stood out in bold relief on the cover.  "C," he  ruminated.  "Cary   —   "  

"No!  Not Cary!" Betty's words rang sharply through the room.  

"Who, then?" asked Grimes quickly, his keen eyes fixed on her  face.  

Elizabeth did not answer, and the detective went back to his  study of the letters.  

"N, R, it looks to me; but I can't make it out for sure."  

He held out the case to Major Barry for his corroboration;  but the major shook his head.  

"I haven't my glasses," he explained; "but I can see enough  to know that the initials don't stand for Fairfax, which is Mr.  Cary's name.  I think this discovery will let him out, don't  you?"  

Grimes shook his head doubtfully, evidently loath to let a  victim escape out of his net until he had another to take the  vacant place.  

"Maybe," he assented; "but it ain't for me to say.  I'll take  this to headquarters right off.  You're sure you don't know who  it belongs to?"  

He looked distrustingly at Betty, who shook her head.  

"Will this be used as evidence?" she asked.  

The detective nodded.  

"It's mighty important evidence.  This and the dictograph are  the best clues we've had yet, and we have you to thank for both  of them, Miss Crosby.  I dare say they'll clear everything up."  

The major put his hand through Betty's arm.  

"Come," he said gently.  "Don't you think we might go now?"  

      
# XVII

    With a hurried good-by to the detective, they passed into the  hall.  Neither spoke as they walked through the deserted  corridor, their footsteps echoing desolately against the closed  doors.  It was only when they were alone in the taxi that Betty's  self-control gave way.  She clutched the major's arm, her  horror-stricken eyes devouring his face.  

"Oh, Uncle Tod," she gasped, " did you recognize the  cigarette-case?"  

The major took her hand and began stroking it tenderly.  

"There, there, my child," he said soothingly.  "You mustn't  take it so to heart!  You'll make yourself ill!"     

"Oh, Uncle Tod, don't stop to think about me!  Do you know to  whom it belongs?"  

"Yes, I knew the initials."  

Betty's hand tightened on his.  

"What shall we do?  Oh, why did it have to be I who found  it?"  

"Nonsense, child; some one was bound to find it sooner or  later.  As it happens, it is fortunate that it was you, for now  we may be able to get the boy away before suspicion fastens on  him.  Will you tell the Crosbys, or shall I?"  

"I will, of course," replied Betty hurriedly.  "Oh, how  ghastly, how awful for them!  Do you really think he did it?"  

She looked almost pleadingly into the candid face beside her.  The major pursed up his lips and stroked his gray mustache  thoughtfully.  

"It's hard to say positively, Betty, but the boy's record is  against him."  

Betty nodded, and once again a tremor passed over her.  

"Poor Uncle George!"  

Her eyes filled with tears.  Major Barry continued to stroke  her hand, and began to tell her of the best course to be pursued  to get Norman away.  He drew a glowing picture of the openings  for young men in faroff lands, where the boy would be cut off  from his old associates and temptations.  Gradually he led  Betty's thoughts away from the horror of the situation, and she  regained her self-possession.  

But it was a very white, tremulous Betty who ascended the  steps of her uncle's house, before which stood Norman's motor.  As the major saw her disappear into the hall, he decided that he  would follow her as soon as he had telephoned his discovery to  Sturgis, who would convey the news to Cary.  

Elizabeth went at once to the library, where she found Norman  seated in a big chair with newspapers scattered around him.  At  the sight of her white face he jumped to his feet and came  quickly to her.  

"Betty!" he exclaimed hoarsely.  "What is it?"  

Steps sounded in the hall, and Norman glanced fearfully  toward the door.  A look of relief came into his face as his  father and mother appeared.  

"Has anything been found?" he faltered in a low voice, his  eyes fixed on Betty's face.  

"You must go   —   quick, Norman, quick!  Don't stop to talk!"  She was pushing him toward the door.  "Your cigarette-case   —   it  was found in Molly Delaney's room.  Oh, Norman, hurry!  Hurry!"  

He started toward the door, but Mrs. Crosby laid a  restraining band on his arm.  

"Norman!" she cried.  "What is it?"  

He shook her off violently.  

"Don't keep me!  They've found   —   they'll be here for   —   for   —   "  

He vanished up the stairs.  

"Who are they, and what are they coming for?" asked George  Crosby irascibly, coming toward Betty.  

Elizabeth pressed her hands tightly together, and her lips  quivered.  

"Oh, Uncle George!" she moaned, going to him and laying her  hand gently on his arm.  "It's about Molly Delaney   —   "  

Her voice trailed away into silence.  

"Molly Delaney!  Do they connect my son with that?"  

Betty did not answer, but the expression on her face seemed  to give him all the information he needed.  He turned from her  and, sinking into a big armchair, buried his head in his hands.  Betty ran to him and put her hand on his shoulder.  

"Oh, uncle dear!" she whispered.  

A hurried step sounded in the hall, and Mrs. Crosby flew to  the door.  

"Good-by, my boy!" they heard her say.  

George Crosby rose and with uncertain feet followed her.  Betty walked beside him, watching him anxiously.  When they  reached the hall be put his hand into his breast pocket and,  drawing out his wallet, took out the money it contained.  

"You'll need this," he said huskily, and thrust it into  Norman's hand.  

There was a hurried good-by, the front door opened and  slammed, and the feverish throb of the motor sounded in their  ears.  Swaying slightly, George Crosby turned again toward the  library.  Betty put her arm through his and guided him back to  the chair by the fire.  He fell into it, and his gray head  dropped against the back.  Mrs. Crosby followed them and stopped  beside them.  

"What does it all mean?" she asked harshly, turning to Betty.  

As gently as she could, Betty told them of the search of  Molly's room and the resulting discovery.     

"Who found the cigarette-case?"  

Mrs. Crosby's tone was sharp and quick.  Betty hesitated, and  it seemed as if every drop of blood in her body had flowed back  to her heart, leaving her numb and cold.  George Crosby raised  his head and fixed haggard eyes upon her.  The silence closed in  upon them like the crushing walls of an inquisitional room.  

"Was it *you?"*  

Mrs. Crosby stepped menacingly toward Betty, who shrank from  the look of implacable rage and hatred in her aunt's face.  

"It *was* you!" she breathed fiercely.  

You   —   you   —   traitor!  Living in our house, taking advantage of  information you got while we were saving you from starvation!  And now   —   now"   —   her voice rose almost to a shriek   —   "you've hounded  my boy out of his home!  God only knows where he can go!  Why did  you do it?  You've brought nothing but misery to us!"  

Under the lash of her aunt's words, Betty's eyes had widened  until they looked like pools of dark water reflecting the  storm-clouds above.  She wrung her hands piteously.  

"I never thought   —   " she faltered.  

"Never thought!  Never thought!" repeated her aunt angrily.  "No, you never think of any one but yourself and that precious  lover of yours!"  

The scorn in her voice was biting, and it stung Betty beyond  control.  

"And my father!" she supplemented passionately.  

"Your father?" sneered Mrs. Crosby.  

"Yes!" repeated Betty in a strained voice which she hardly  recognized as her own.  "If it had not been for the stigma on my  father's name, I should never have felt justified in entering on  this search.  As it was   —   "  

"And what did you find?"  

Mrs. Crosby's thin lips were drawn back in a derisive smile.  Betty hesitated, and her eyes wandered to the gray head resting  on the back of the chair.  Her chin trembled a little.  

"What did you find?" demanded Mrs. Crosby once more.  "In  spite of the ruin you've brought on us, you've found nothing that  clears your father's name, or ever will!"  

Major Barry's immaculate figure appeared in the doorway.  

"I think you're wrong there," he remarked quietly, after a  searching look at Elizabeth's quivering face.  "We've been  looking into Randolph's affairs a bit lately   —   some of his  business associates and I   —   and we've discovered quite a number of  things."  

Mrs. Crosby's face blanched, the two brilliant spots of color  standing out grotesquely on her cheeks.  George Crosby's eyes  fixed themselves feverishly on the major's face.  

"What do you mean?"  

"I mean this, Mrs. Crosby   —   when Randolph died he left some  very valuable stock, which has since been sold   —   "  

George Crosby's hand tightened on the arm of his chair until  even the nails showed white.  His face was livid.  

"How do you know?"  

"I know through one of the other directors of the concern, in  which Randolph held a large interest.  This man has traced the  sale of the stock."  He turned suddenly to George Crosby.  "Do  you deny it?"  

George Crosby sank even deeper into the big chair, and his  hand went up to his sagging mouth.  Unable to meet the accusing  eyes fixed on him, his head fell forward until his chin rested on  his chest.  Betty took a hurried step forward.  

"Uncle Tod, what is it?  I don't quite understand   —   "  

"My dear, it's simply this   —   your father died, as we all  believed, a very rich man.  It is since his death that his money  has been dissipated."  

"Oh!"  The word was hardly more than a sigh.  "Who   —   "  

"That's just it; who could have sacrificed your interests and  betrayed your father's confidence?  Who had the power?"  

Again the major's condemning eyes sought George Crosby's  stricken figure.  

"Uncle George, did you do this thing?"  Betty drew nearer and  nearer to him, her eyes wide, her mouth quivering.  "You, whom my  father loved and trusted?  Oh, tell me it isn't true!"  

She sank down on her knees beside him and clutched his arm.  There was a long silence.  

"It is true!" came at length, in hollow tones, from the bowed  head.  

Betty drew back slowly, as if still loath to believe what she  heard.     

"My father's brother!"  The words seemed drawn from her.  "And he loved you!  

The man before her shuddered.  

"Betty!" he groaned.  "I didn't mean   —   "  

As if in hope that he was about to disclaim his culpability,  Betty stooped eagerly toward him; but he stopped abruptly, and  once more the gray head fell forward.  A heavy silence wrapped  itself about them, which at last Mrs. Crosby's harsh voice broke.  

"Well, it's all out now!" she said violently.  "I suppose  you'll send your uncle to join Norman in prison!"  

Betty looked at her aunt as if her words were husks void of  the grain of meaning.  Bending over her uncle's huddled form, she  stroked his gray head tenderly; then she stooped over and kissed  him.  

"Uncle George, don't worry about it!" she whispered so softly  that the words hardly reached the others.  "I'm sure it was all a  mistake.  I don't believe it was for yourself you took the money.  At all events, it will never make any difference between you and  me."  

A great sob shook the bent shoulders.  George Crosby caught  her hand and held it to his lips.  Betty kissed him again, and  then, holding out her hand to Major Barry, drew him out of the  house.  

      
# XVIII

    Major Barry's face was glowing with satisfaction as he sat in  Cary's cell the next morning and rehearsed for his benefit the  search in the Delaneys' rooms.  

"I tell you, that little girl's a wonder, Fairfax!" he  exclaimed.  "She was in a nasty fix there, with the evidence of  her cousin's guilt, which she had found herself, in her hand.  She naturally didn't want to implicate him, and yet she had to  exonerate you.  I was sorry for the child."  

The taut lines of Cary's face had relaxed in a tender smile.  

"But you say she wouldn't let it go when the detective  suggested that the `C' on the case stood for my name?"  

The major laughed boyishly.  

"No, sir!  She spoke up loud and clear then, all right!  Now,  the next thing is to discover what was heard through that  dictograph."  

"That seems like an almost hopeless quest, now that Pat's  gone," answered Fairfax gloomily.  

Can't tell, my boy; luck's begun running for us now, and I  wouldn't be surprised at anything.  It was too bad Sturgis  couldn't arrange about bail yesterday.  I had hoped, when I  telephoned, that you would be out last night."  

"Apparently it couldn't be done.  There's always so much red  tape in a case like this."  

"I wanted to come down and tell you all about the discovery  myself, but I knew Sturgis would give you the facts, and I really  felt that I must go to the Crosbys'.  It was fortunate that I  did, for that fiend, Maude Crosby, was at poor little Betty neck  and crop, and, I think, would have rent her asunder if I hadn't  turned up when I did.  She's a devil, that woman!"  The major's  shoulders stiffened and his jaw snapped.  "I should like to see  her brought to her knees!"  

Again the tender smile stole over Cary's face.  

"And Betty isn't going to bring action against her uncle?"  

"Won't consider it for a minute," returned the major.  "Nothing I could say or do would convince her that she is making  a mistake.  She won't hear of a lawsuit."  

"Well, after all, it's Betty's money, and she's the one to  decide.  It isn't as if she will really need it now."  

"No; there's comfort in that thought.  You're not going to  let her go back to France, are you, Fairfax?" asked the major,  eying the other man's face anxiously.  

"She's not going out of this country for some time, if I have  anything to say about it, and she seems to think I have,  unless"   —   a light spread over Cary's face   —   "I can persuade her to  take that trip to Bermuda that you suggested a while ago!"  

"That would be great!  The sooner the better."  Major Barry  glanced restlessly at his watch.  "It seems to me that Sturgis  ought to be along pretty soon now."  

A guard appeared at the door and unlocked it; but the man who  was with him was not the alert, keen-eyed lawyer, but a slender  youth with slack shoulders and narrow, furtive eyes.  The major  looked inquiringly at Fairfax, who shook his head in answer to  the unspoken question.  The boy slouched into the cell and  touched the brim of his hat awkwardly.     

"Mr.  Cary," he began in a high, shrill voice, "you don't  remember me, but I'm Jim   —   Jim Murphy.  I used ter work fer Mr.  Crosby."  

A sudden flash illumined Cary's memory, and he held out his  hand cordially.  

"Why, Jim!" he exclaimed.  "Of course I remember you!  You  used to take care of Steadfast."  

The boy grasped his hand and wrung it.  

"I sure did, Mr. Cary!"  

"Sit down, Jim, sit down; of course I remember you, and so  does Major Barry, I'm sure."  The major nodded pleasantly to the  boy, and Fairfax went on:  "Weren't you with Pat the night he  died?  I seem to recall seeing you at the hotel."  

He looked searchingly into Jim's face.  

"Yes, sir; that's what I come ter see ye about.  I wuz with  Pat till late that night."  

Jim was sitting on the edge of his chair, nervously twisting  his hat around in his big-knuckled hands.  

"Then you came back after I went away?"  

"Yes, sir."  

"Was Molly alive when you left?"  The major asked the  question eagerly, leaning far out of his seat.  

"Yes, sir; she came in two or three times ter see how Pat wuz  gettin' along."  

Mr. Sturgis had arrived in time to hear the boy's words, and  the three men looked at one another in undisguised pleasure.  

"Well," exclaimed the major triumphantly to Fairfax, "that  lets you out!  I wish we had known this before," he added,  turning to Murphy.  

"I'm sorry, sir, but I didn't know nothin' about what  happened after I lef' till about a week ago.  The night Pat got  smashed up I went to Texas with Mr. Vinton's horses.  We wuz on a  ranch, and didn't often get the newspapers.  I wuz kind o'  surprised that Molly didn't let me know how Pat wuz, but she an'  I had had a row, and I s'posed she wuz too mad to write.  It wuz  only when I had a letter from a friend of mine that I knew"   —   his  voice faltered   —   "that they wuz both dead."  

The muscles of his face twitched, and he put his big hand  over his mouth.  

"This is most important evidence!" announced the lawyer.  

"I knowed it would be, sir.  I felt awful bad when I heard  Mr. Cary wuz up fer murder, and I sez ter meself, `You fer the  Great White Way, Jim!' an' I beats it right on. I should think  any guy would know *he* ain't done it   —   that is, if they knew him  at all."  

"Who did do it, Jim?" The major's voice was like cold steel.  

"Well, when I went away, Mr. Crosby   —   Mr. Norman Crosby   —   was  in the next room with Molly.  He'd been there all evenin', an'  they'd been havin' it out hot an' heavy.  We could hear 'em, Pat  an' I, even with the door shut, but we couldn't make out what  they wuz sayin'.  Fer a long time Pat hadn't liked the way things  wuz goin', so he rigged up one o' them dictograph things in  Molly's room and strung the wires into his."  

"What was it he suspected?"  

The boy moistened his lips.  

"He wanted ter find out about the Withers Stake   —   ye know,  when Steadfast got licked?"  He glanced interrogatively at Major  Barry, who nodded.  "Well," he went on, "I'd been givin' Pat some  dope about what happened just before that race, when he went off  ter dress, an' then Molly had let drop enough ter put him wise  that somethin' wuz wrong.  I wuz in the stable all the time Pat  wuz gone.  Mr. Norman an' Molly didn't know it, but I wuz in the  stall just the other side of Steadfast's."  

He stopped, and his face became ghastly.  

"Why did you think   —   "  

Jim swallowed hard.  

"Molly an' me had been pals since we wuz kids, an' I wuz kind  o' sore when she dropped me," he half whispered.  "I knowed Mr.  Norman wuz rushin' her, an' I wanted ter find out how far things  had gone, so I hid an' listened."  

Jim's big hand clenched, and a red light gleamed in the  deep-set eyes.  

He wuz tellin' her that he loved her, an' he kissed her.  Then he went inter Steadfast's stall, an' I heard Molly askin'  him what he wuz doin'.  He said he wuz fixin' things so that he  an' Molly could go off on a trip an' have a bang-up time.  It wuz  after I told Pat that that he got the  dictograph; an' the night  Pat died we heard the whole thing.  Molly told him that she'd  seen him dope Steadfast, an' there wasn't no use in his denyin'  it, an' she'd fix him, all right, if he didn't do as he'd  promised an' marry her.  Pat made me write it all down.  He wuz  pretty far in, an' he wuz  afraid he'd forget somethin'.  He  said Mr. Cary had promised ter come back in the mornin', an' he  wanted ter have it fer him.  So I wrote it down an' hid the paper  under the cover o' the table by the bed, where Pat could reach  it, an' where Molly wouldn't be apt ter find it.  Then I had ter  go.  As it was, I nearly missed my train."  

"Your testimony will be invaluable in clearing Mr. Cary,"  remarked Sturgis.  "We shall want you to repeat this in court."  

"Yes, sir; that's what I come on fer.  I wasn't goin' ter let  Mr. Cary be put out o' bizness fer what he ain't done.  Mr.  Cary's on the level, sir!   He's all right, an' I couldn't stand  by an' see him takin' what ought ter be comin' ter that   —   "  

Jim stopped, and his nostrils quivered.

    It was about four o'clock that afternoon that Fairfax Cary  ran up the front steps of the Hunnewells' house.  When he entered  the hall the air was vibrant with the rich chords of the  "Nocturne in F."  He stood for a moment drinking in its tender  harmonies.  Wave after wave of the music passed over him, pulsing  through his veins into his heart, until at last it seemed as if  his soul had been washed white from the prison taint which, even  after he left the Tombs, had hovered over him with a sickening  sense of impurity.  

Stronger and more penetrating rose the music, with its  swelling chords and haunting melody.  Fairfax pushed aside the  portieres and stepped into the room.  The music stopped abruptly,  and Betty, with a little cry, rose from the piano.  Her face  turned very white.  

"I didn't know   —   " she faltered.  

He strode across the room and caught her in his arms.  

"My dear, my dear!" she sobbed, clinging to him.  

He held her to him, and kissed her hungrily with the pent-up  passion of long months of waiting.  When he half released her to  gaze into her eyes, he found them full of tears.  

"Darling," he expostulated, "you're crying!"  

The tears overflowed, and Betty buried her face in his  shoulder.  

"Of course I am!" she cried.  

"Will you tell me why?"  

"I haven't had time to cry in weeks," answered Betty  tremulously.  "You don't suppose I could stop to cry when there  was anything to do, do you?"  

Cary's arms tightened around her, and he tenderly kissed the  drops away.  

"My darling!" he whispered.  "Tell me that you love me! "  

But she pushed him away with a tremulous little laugh.  

"I've been telling you so for weeks.  If you don't believe it  now, you never will!"  

She took his hand and led him to the sofa.  

"I sha'n't feel sure of you until we're married," answered  Fairfax.  "We can be very soon, can't we, dear?"  

"I told you in France that I wouldn't marry any one till  father's name had been cleared."  

"Darling, it has been!  Jim Murphy, your father's stable-boy,  came to see me this morning.  He saw Norman dope Steadfast before  the Withers race.  Jim will swear to it in court."  

"Norman!" exclaimed Betty.  "How dreadful!"  

"Molly was with him, and it was after her threat to expose  the whole thing that he killed her."  

"How ghastly, Fairfax!  How perfectly dreadful!  Poor Uncle  George!"  

"So now, darling, you won't keep me waiting any longer, will  you?"  

Betty snuggled closer to him and laid her head on his  shoulder.  

"I'm ready now, as far I can be," she whispered softly.  "I  can't get a big trousseau, Fairfax.  You know why, don't you,  dear?  I haven't a cent in the world.  Do you realize that you're  getting a penniless bride?"  

She raised troubled eyes and anxiously studied his face.  

Fairfax laughed boyishly.  

"Really?" he teased.  "Then I can't marry you, my pretty  maid!"  

"I hate you!" and Betty pressed her lips to his.
