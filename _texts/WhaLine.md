# THE LINE OF LEAST RESISTANCE
                       
  * By Edith Wharton*  
  * Author of "The Greater Inclination"*

               
## I.

    MILLICENT was late—as usual.  Mr. Mindon, returning unexpectedly  from an interrupted yacht-race, reached home with the legitimate  hope of finding her at luncheon; but she was still out.  "Was she  lunching out then?" he asked the butler, who replied, with the air  of making an uncalled-for concession to his master's curiosity,  that Mrs. Mindon had given no orders about luncheon.

       Mr. Mindon, on this negative information (it was the kind from  which his knowledge of his wife's movements was mainly drawn), sat  down to the grilled cutlet and glass of Vichy that represented his  share in the fabulous daily total of the chef's book.  Mr. Mindon's  annual food-consumption probably amounted to about half of one per  cent. on his cook's perquisites, and of the other luxuries of his  complicated establishment he enjoyed considerably less than this  fraction.  Of course, it was nobody's fault but his own.  As  Millicent pointed out, she couldn't feed her friends on mutton-chops and Vichy because of his digestive difficulty, nor could she  return their hospitality by asking them to play croquet with the  children because that happened to be Mr. Mindon's chosen pastime.   If that was the kind of life he wanted to lead he should have  married a dyspeptic governess, not a young confiding girl, who  little dreamed what marriage meant when she passed from her  father's roof into the clutches of a tyrant with imperfect gastric  secretions.

       It was his fault, of course, but then Millicent had faults  too, as she had been known to concede when she perceived that the  contemplation of her merits was beginning to pall; and it did seem  unjust to Mr. Mindon that their life should be one long adaptation  to Millicent's faults at the expense of his own.  Millicent was  unpunctual—but that gave a sense of her importance to the people  she kept waiting; she had nervous attacks—but they served to  excuse her from dull dinners and family visits; she was bad-tempered—but that merely made the servants insolent to Mr. Mindon;  she was extravagant—but that simply necessitated Mr. Mindon's  curtailing his summer holiday and giving a     closer attention to business.  If ever a woman had the qualities of her faults, that  woman was Millicent.  Like the legendary goose, they laid golden  eggs for her, and she nurtured them tenderly in return.  If  Millicent had been a perfect wife and mother, she and Mr. Mindon  would probably have spent their summer in the depressing  promiscuity of hotel piazzas.  Mr. Mindon was shrewd enough to see  that he reaped the advantages of his wife's imperfect domesticity,  and that if her faults were the making of her, she was the making  of him.  It was therefore unreasonable to be angry with Millicent,  even if she were late for luncheon, and Mr. Mindon, who prided  himself on being a reasonable man, usually found some other outlet  for his wrath.

       On this occasion it was the unpunctuality of the little girls.   They came in with their governess some minutes after he was seated:  two small Millicents, with all her arts in miniature.  They  arranged their frocks carefully before seating themselves and  turned up their little Greek noses at the food.  Already they  showed signs of finding fault with as much ease and discrimination  as Millicent; and Mr. Mindon knew that this was an accomplishment  not to be undervalued.  He himself, for example, though Millicent  charged him with being a discontented man, had never acquired her  proficiency in depreciation; indeed, he sometimes betrayed a  mortifying indifference to trifles that afforded opportunity for  the display of his wife's fastidiousness.  Mr. Mindon, though no  biologist, was vaguely impressed by the way in which that  accomplished woman had managed to transmit an acquired  characteristic to her children: it struck him with wonder that  traits of which he had marked the incipience in Millicent should  have become intuitions in her offspring.  To rebuke such costly  replicas of their mother seemed dangerously like scolding  Millicent—and Mr. Mindon's hovering resentment prudently settled  on the governess.

       He pointed out to her that the children were late for  luncheon.

       The governess was sorry, but Gladys was always unpunctual.   Perhaps her papa would speak to her.

       Mr. Mindon changed the subject.  "What's that at my feet?   There's a dog in the room!"

       He looked round furiously at the butler, who gazed impartially  over his head.  Mr. Mindon knew that it was proper for him to  ignore his servants, but was not sure to what extent they ought to  reciprocate his treatment.

       The governess explained that it was Gwendolen's puppy.

       "Gwendolen's puppy?  Who gave Gwendolen a puppy?"

       "Fwank Antwim," said Gwendolen through a mouthful of mushroom  souffle.

       "Mr. Antrim," the governess suggested, in a tone that  confessed the futility of the correction.

          *" We* don't call him Mr. Antrim; we call him Frank; he likes  us to," said Gladys icily.

       "You'll do no such thing!" her father snapped.

       A soft body came in contact with his toe.  He kicked out  viciously, and the room was full of yelping.

       "Take the animal out instantly!" he stormed: dogs were animals  to Mr. Mindon.  The butler continued to gaze over his head, and the  two footmen took their cue from the butler.

       "I won't—I won't—I won't let my puppy go!" Gwendolen  violently lamented.

       But she should have another, her father assured her—a much  handsomer and more expensive one; his darling should have a prize  dog; he would telegraph to New York on the instant.

       "I don't want a pwize dog; I want Fwank's puppy!"

       Mr. Mindon laid down his fork and walked out of the room,  while the governess, cutting up Gwendolen's nectarine, said, as  though pointing out an error in syntax, "You've vexed your papa  again."

       "I don't mind vexing papa—nothing happens," said Gwendolen,  hugging her puppy; while Gladys, disdaining the subject of dispute,  contemptuously nibbled caramels.  Gladys was two years older than  Gwendolen and had outlived the first freshness of her enthusiasm  for Frank Antrim, who, with the notorious indiscrimination of the  grown-up, always gave the nicest presents to Gwendolen.

       Mr. Mindon, crossing his marble hall between goddesses whose  dishabille was still slightly disconcerting to his traditions,  stepped out on the terrace above the cliffs.  The lawn looked as  expensive as a velvet carpet woven in one piece; the flower-borders  contained only exotics; and the stretch of blue-satin Atlantic had  the air of being furrowed only by the keels of pleasure-boats.  The  scene, to Mr. Mindon's imagination, never lost the keen edge of its  costliness; he had yet to learn Millicent's trick of regarding a  Newport villa as a mere pied à terre; but he could not help  reflecting that, after all, it was to him she owed her fine sense  of relativity.  There are certain things one must possess in order  not to be awed by them, and it was he who had enabled Millicent to  take a Newport villa for granted.  And still she was not satisfied!   She had reached the point where taking the exceptional as a matter  of course becomes in itself a matter of course; and Millicent could  not live without novelty.  That was the worst of it: she discarded  her successes as rapidly as her gowns; Mr. Mindon felt a certain  breathlessness in retracing her successive manifestations.  And yet  he had always made allowances: literally and figuratively, he had  gone on making larger and larger allowances, till his whole income,  as well as his whole point of view, was practically at Millicent's  disposal.  But, after all, there was a principle of give and take—  if only Millicent could     have been brought to see it!  One  of Millicent's chief sources of strength lay in her magnificent  obtuseness: there were certain obligations that simply didn't exist  for her, because she couldn't be brought to see them, and the  principle of give and take (a favorite principle of Mr. Mindon's)  was one of them.

       There was Frank Antrim, for instance.  Mr. Mindon, who had a  high sense of propriety, had schooled himself, not without  difficulty, into thinking Antrim a charming fellow.  No one was  more alive than Mr. Mindon to the expediency of calling the Furies  the Eumenides.  He knew that as long as he chose to think Frank  Antrim a charming fellow, everything was as it should be and his  home a temple of the virtues.  But why on earth did Millicent let  the fellow give presents to the children?  Mr. Mindon was dimly  conscious that Millicent had been guilty of the kind of failure she  would least have liked him to detect—a failure in taste,—and a  certain exultation tempered his resentment.  To anyone who had  suffered as Mr. Mindon had from Millicent's keenness in noting such  lapses in others, it was not unpleasant to find that she could be  "bad form."  A sense of unwonted astuteness fortified Mr. Mindon's  wrath.  He felt that he had every reason to be angry with  Millicent, and decided to go and scold the governess; then he  remembered that it was bad for him to lose his temper after eating,  and, drawing a small phial from his pocket, he took a pepsin tablet  instead.

       Having vented his wrath in action, he felt calmer, but  scarcely more happy.  A marble nymph smiled at him from the  terrace; but he knew how much nymphs cost, and was not sure that  they were worth the price.  Beyond the shrubberies he caught a  glimpse of domed glass.  His green-houses were the finest in  Newport; but since he neither ate fruit nor wore orchids, they  yielded at best an indirect satisfaction.  At length he decided to  go and play with the little girls; but on entering the nursery he  found them dressing for a party, with the rapt gaze and fevered  cheeks with which Millicent would presently perform the same rite.   They took no notice of him, and he crept downstairs again.

       His study table was heaped with bills, and as it was bad for  his digestion to look over them after luncheon, he wandered on into  the other rooms.  He did not stay long in the drawing-room: it  evoked too vividly the evening hours when he delved for platitudes  under the inattentive gaze of listeners who obviously resented his  not being somebody else.  Much of Mr. Mindon's intercourse with  ladies was clouded by the sense of this resentment, and he  sometimes avenged himself by wondering if they supposed he would  talk to them if he could help it.  The sight of the dining-room  door increased his depression by recalling the long dinners where,  with the pantry-draught on his neck, he languished between the  dullest women of the evening.  He turned away; but the ball-room  beyond roused even more disturbing associations: an orchestra  playing all night (Mr. Mindon crept to bed at eleven), carriages  shouted for under his windows, and a morrow like the day after an  earthquake.

       In the library he felt less irritated but not more cheerful.   Mr. Mindon had never quite known what the library was for: it was  like one of those mysterious ruins over which archaeology endlessly  disputes.  It could not have been intended for reading, since no  one in the house ever read, except an under-housemaid charged with  having set fire to her bed in her surreptitious zeal for fiction;  and smoking was forbidden there, because the hangings held the odor  of tobacco.  Mr. Mindon felt a natural pride in being rich enough  to permit himself a perfectly useless room; but not liking to take  the bloom from its inutility by sitting in it, he passed on to  Millicent's boudoir.

       Here at least was a room of manifold purposes, the centre of  Millicent's complex social system.  Mr. Mindon entered with the awe  of the modest investor treading the inner precincts of finance.  He  was proud of Millicent's social activities and liked to read over  her daily list of engagements and the record of the invitations she  received in a season.  The number was perpetually swelling, like a  rising stock.  Mr. Mindon had a vague sense that she would soon be  declaring an extra dividend.  After all, one must be lenient to a  woman as hard-working as Millicent.  All about him were the  evidences of her toil: her writing-table disappeared under an  avalanche of notes and cards; the waste-paper basket overflowed  with torn correspondence; and, glancing down, Mr. Mindon saw a  crumpled letter at his feet.  Being a man of neat habits, he was  often tried by Millicent's genial disorder; and his customary  rebuke was the act of restoring the strayed object to its place.

       He stooped to gather the bit of paper from the floor.  As he  picked it up his eye caught a word; he smoothed the page and read  on. . . .

                                     
## II.

         HE seemed to be cowering on the edge of a boiling flood,  watching his small thinking faculty spin round out of reach on the  tumult of his sensations.  Then a fresh wave of emotion swept the  tiny object—the quivering imperceptible ego—back to shore, and it  began to reach out drowned tentacles in a faint effort after  thought.

       He sat up and glanced about him.  The room looked back at him,  coldly, unfamiliarly, as he had seen Millicent look when he asked  her to be reasonable.  And who are you? the walls seemed to say.   Who am I? Mr. Mindon heard himself retorting.  I'll tell you, by  God!  I'm the man that paid for you—paid for every scrap of you:  silk hangings, china rubbish, glasses, chandeliers,—every  Frenchified rag of you.     Why, if it weren't for me and my  money you'd be nothing but a brick-and-plaster shell, naked as the  day you were built—no better than a garret or a coal-hole.  Why,  you wouldn't * be* at all if I chose to tear you down.  I could  tear the whole house down, if I chose.

       He paused, suddenly aware that his eyes were on a photograph  of Millicent, and that it was his wife he was apostrophizing.  Her  lips seemed to shape a "hush:" when he said things she didn't like  she always told him not to talk so loud.  Had he been talking loud?   Well, who was to prevent him?  Wasn't the house his and everything  in it?  Who was Millicent, to bid him hush?

       Mr. Mindon felt a sudden increase of stature.  He strutted  across the room.  Why, of course, the room belonged to him, the  house belonged to him, and he belonged to himself!  That was the  best of it!  For years he had been the man that Millicent thought  him, the mere projection of her disdain; and now he was himself.

       It was odd how the expression of her photograph changed,  melting, as her face did, from contempt to cajolery, in one of  those transitions that hung him breathless on the skirts of her  mood.  She was looking at him gently now, sadly almost, with the  little grieved smile that seemed always to anticipate and pardon  his obtuseness.  Ah, Millicent!  The clock struck and Mr. Mindon  stood still.  Perhaps she was smiling so now—or the other way.  He  could have told the other fool where each of her smiles led.  There  was a fierce enjoyment in his sense of lucidity.  He saw it all  now.  Millicent had kept him for years in bewildered subjection to  exigencies as inscrutable as the decrees of Providence; but now his  comprehension of her seemed a mere incident in his omniscience.

       His sudden translation to the absolute gave him a curious  sense of spectatorship: he seemed to be looking on at his own  thoughts.  His brain was like a brightly lit factory, full of  flying wheels and shuttles.  All the machinery worked with the  greatest rapidity and precision.  He was planning, reasoning,  arguing, with unimagined facility: words flew out like sparks from  each revolving thought.  But suddenly he felt himself caught in the  wheels of his terrific logic, and swept round, red and shrieking,  till he was flung off into space.  

       The acuter thrill of one sobbing nerve detached itself against  his consciousness.  What was it that hurt so?  Someone was  speaking: a voice probed to the central pain,—

       "Any orders for the stable, sir?"

       And Mr. Mindon found himself the mere mouth-piece of a roving  impulse that replied,—

       "No; but you may telephone for a cab for me—at once."

                                       
## III.

      HE drove to one of the hotels.    He was breathing more easily  now, restored to the safe level of conventional sensation.  His  late ascent to the rarefied heights of the unexpected had left him  weak and exhausted; but he gained reassurance from the way in which  his thoughts were slipping back of themselves into the old grooves.   He was feeling, he was sure, just as a gentleman ought to feel; all  the consecrated phrases—"outraged honor," "a father's heart," "the  sanctity of home"—were flocking glibly at his call.  He had the  self-confidence that comes of knowing one has on the right clothes.   He had certainly done the proper thing in leaving the house at  once; but, too weak and tired to consider the next step, he yielded  himself to one of those soothing intervals of abeyance when life  seems to wait submissively at the door.

       As his cab breasted the current of the afternoon drive he  caught the greeting of the lady with whom he and Millicent were to  have dined.  He was troubled by the vision of that disrupted  dinner.  He had not yet reached the point of detachment at which  offending Mrs. Targe might become immaterial, and again he felt  himself jerked out of his grooves.  What ought he to do?   Millicent, now, could have told him—if only he might have  consulted Millicent!  He pulled himself together and tried to think  of his wrongs.

       At the hotel, the astonished clerk led him upstairs, unlocking  the door of a room that smelt of cheap soap.  The window had been  so long shut that it opened with a jerk, sending a shower of dead  flies to the carpet.  Out along the sea-front, at that hour, the  south-wind was hurrying the waters, but the hotel stood in one of  the sheltered streets, where in midsummer there is little life in  the air.  Mr. Mindon sat down in the provisional attitude of a  visitor who is kept waiting.  Over the fireplace hung a print of  the Landing of Columbus; a fly-blown portrait of General Grant  faced it from the opposite wall.  The smell of soap was  insufferable, and hot noises came up irritatingly from the street.   He looked at his watch: it was just four o'clock.

       He wondered if Millicent had come in yet, and if she had read  his letter.  The occupation of picturing how she would feel when  she read it proved less exhilarating than he had expected, and he  got up and wandered about the room.  He opened a drawer in the  dressing-table, and seeing in it some burnt matches and a fuzz of  hair, shut it with disgust; but just as he was ringing to rebuke  the house-maid he remembered that he was not in his own house.  He  sat down again, wondering if the afternoon post were in, and what  letters it had brought.  It was annoying not to get his letters.   What would be done about them?  Would they be sent after him?  Sent  where?  It suddenly occurred to him that he didn't in the least  know where he was going.  He must be     going somewhere, of  course; he hadn't left home to settle down in that stifling room.   He supposed he should go to town, but with the heat at ninety the  prospect was not alluring.  He might decide on Lenox or Saratoga;  but a doubt as to the propriety of such a course set him once more  adrift on a chartless sea of perplexities.  His head ached horribly  and he threw himself on the bed.  

       When he sat up, worn out with his thoughts, the room was  growing dark.  Eight o'clock!  Millicent must be dressing—but no;  to-night at least, he grimly reflected, she was condemned to the  hateful necessity of dining alone; unless, indeed, her audacity  sent her to Mrs. Targe's in the always-acceptable role of the  pretty woman whose husband has been "called away."  Perhaps Antrim  would be asked to fill his place!

       The thought flung him on his feet, but its impetus carried him  no farther.  He was borne down by the physical apathy of a  traveller who has a week's journey in his bones.  He sat down and  thought of the little girls, who were just going to bed.  They  would have welcomed him at that hour: he was aware that they  cherished him chiefly as a pretext, a sanctuary from bed-time and  lessons.  He had never in his life been more than an alternative to  anyone.

       A vague sense of physical apprehension resolved itself into  hunger stripped of appetite, and he decided that he ought to urge  himself to eat.  He opened his door on a rising aroma of stale  coffee and fry.

       In the dining-room, where a waiter offered him undefinable  food in thick-lipped saucers, Mr. Mindon decided to go to New York.   Retreating from the heavy assault of a wedge of pie, he pushed back  his chair and went upstairs.  He felt hot and grimy in the  yachting-clothes he had worn since morning, and the Fall River boat  would at least be cool.  Then he remembered the playful throngs  that held the deck, the midnight hilarity of the waltz-tunes, the  horror of the morning coffee.  His stomach was still tremulous from  its late adventure into the unknown, and he shrank from further  risks.  He had never before realized how much he loved his home.

       He grew soft at the vision of his vacant chair.  What were  they doing and saying without him?  His little ones were  fatherless—and Millicent?  Hitherto he had evaded the thought of  Millicent, but now he took a doleful pleasure in picturing her in  ruins at his feet.  Involuntarily he found himself stooping to her  despair; but he straightened himself and said aloud, "I'll take the  night-train, then."  The sound of his voice surprised him, and he  started up.  Was that a footstep outside?—a message, a note?  Had  they found out where he was, and was his wretched wife mad enough  to sue for mercy?  His ironical smile gave the measure of her  madness; but the step passed on, and he sat down rather blankly.   The impressiveness of his attitude was being gradually sapped by  the sense that no one knew where he was.  He had reached the point  where he could not be sure of remaining inflexible unless someone  asked him to relent.

                                     
## IV.

     AT the sound of a knock he clutched his hat and bag.

       "Mindon, I say!" a genial voice adjured him; and before he  could take counsel with his newly acquired dignity, which did not  immediately respond to a first summons, the door opened on the  reassuring presence of Laurence Meysy.

       Mr. Mindon felt the relief of a sufferer at the approach of  the eminent specialist.  Laurence Meysy was the past tense of a  dangerous man: though time-worn, still a favorite; a circulating-library romance, dog-eared by many a lovely hand, and still perused  with pleasure, though, alas! no longer on the sly.  He was said to  have wrought much havoc in his youth; and it being now his innocent  pleasure to repair the damage done by others, he had become the  consulting physician of injured husbands and imprudent wives.

       Two gentlemen followed him: Mr. Mindon's uncle and senior  partner, the eminent Ezra Brownrigg, and the Reverend Doctor  Bonifant, rector of the New York church in which Mr. Mindon owned  a pew that was almost as expensive as his opera-box.

       Mr. Brownrigg entered silently: to get at anything to say he  had to sink an artesian well of meditation; but he always left  people impressed by what he would have said if he had spoken.  He  greeted his nephew with the air of a distinguished mourner at a  funeral—the mourner who consciously overshadows the corpse; and  Doctor Bonifant did justice to the emotional side of the situation  by fervently exclaiming, "Thank Heaven, we are not too late!"

       Mr. Mindon looked about him with pardonable pride.  The scene  suggested something between a vestry-meeting and a conference of  railway-directors; and the knowledge that he himself was its  central figure, that even his uncle was an accessory, an incident,  a mere bit of still-life brushed in by the artist Circumstance to  throw Mr. Mindon into fuller prominence, gave that gentleman his  first sense of equality with his wife.  Equality?  In another  moment he towered above her, picturing her in an attitude of  vaguely imagined penance at Doctor Bonifant's feet.  Mr. Mindon had  always felt about the clergy much as he did about his library: he  had never quite known what they were for; but, with the pleased  surprise of the pious naturalist, he now saw that they had their  uses, like every other object in the economy of nature.

       "My dear fellow," Meysy persuasively went on, "we've come to  have a little chat with you."

       Mr. Brownrigg and the Rector seated themselves.  Mr. Mindon        mechanically followed their example, and Meysy, asking the  others if they minded his cigarette, cheerfully accommodated  himself to the edge of the bed.

       From the life-long habit of taking the chair, Mr. Brownrigg  coughed and looked at Doctor Bonifant.  The Rector leaned forward,  stroking his cheek with a hand on which a massive intaglio seemed  to be rehearsing the part of the episcopal ring; then his  deprecating glance transferred the burden of action to Laurence  Meysy.  Meysy seemed to be surveying the case through the  mitigating medium of cigarette-smoke.  His view was that of the  professional setting to rights the blunders of two amateurs.  It  was his theory that the art of carrying on a love affair was very  nearly extinct; and he had a far greater contempt for Antrim than  for Mr. Mindon.

       "My dear fellow," he began, "I've seen Mrs. Mindon—she sent  for me."

       Mr. Brownrigg, peering between guarded lids, here interposed  a "Very proper."

       Of course Millicent had done the proper thing!  Mr. Mindon  could not repress a thrill of pride at her efficiency.

       "Mrs. Mindon," Meysy continued, "showed me your letter."  He  paused.  "She was perfectly frank—she throws herself on your  mercy."

       "That should be remembered in her favor," Doctor Bonifant  murmured in a voice of absolution.

       "It's a wretched business, Mindon—the poor woman's crushed—  crushed.  Your uncle here has seen her."

       Mr. Brownrigg glanced suspiciously at Meysy, as though not  certain whether he cared to corroborate an unauthorized assertion;  then he said, "Mrs. Brownrigg has * not*."

       Doctor Bonifant sighed: Mrs. Brownrigg was one of his most  cherished parishioners.

       "And the long and short of it is," Meysy summed up, "that  we're here as your friends—and as your wife's friends—to ask you  what you mean to do."

       There was a pause.  Mr. Mindon was disturbed by finding the  initiative shifted to his shoulders.  He had been talking to  himself so volubly for the last six hours that he seemed to have  nothing left to say.

       "To do—to do?" he stammered.  "Why, I mean to go away—leave  her—"

       "Divorce her?"

       "Why,—y-yes—yes—"

       Doctor Bonifant sighed again, and Mr. Brownrigg's lips stirred  like a door being cautiously unbarred.

       Meysy knocked the ashes off his cigarette.  "You've quite made  up your mind, eh?"    

       Mr. Mindon faltered another assent.  Then, annoyed at the  uncertain sound of his voice, he repeated loudly, "I mean to  divorce her."

       The repetition fortified his resolve; and his declaration  seemed to himself against entreaty: their mere presence was a  pedestal for his wrongs.  The words flocked of themselves, building  up his conviction like a throng of masons buttressing a weak wall.

       Mr. Brownrigg spoke upon his first pause.  "There's the  publicity—it's the kind of thing that's prejudicial to a man's  business interests.

       An hour earlier the words would have turned Mr. Mindon cold;  now he brushed them aside.  His business interests, forsooth!  What  good had his money ever done him?  What chance had he ever had of  enjoying it?  All his toil hadn't made him a rich man—it had  merely made Millicent a rich woman.

       Doctor Bonifant murmured, "The children must be considered."

       "They've never considered me!" Mr. Mindon retorted—and turned  afresh upon his uncle.  Mr. Brownrigg listened impassively.  He was  a very silent man, but his silence was not a receptacle for the  speech of others—it was a hard convex surface on which argument  found no footing.  Mr. Mindon reverted to the Rector.  Doctor  Bonifant's attitude towards life was full of a benignant  receptivity; as though, logically, a man who had accepted the  Thirty-nine Articles was justified in accepting anything else that  he chose.  His attention had therefore an absorbent quality  peculiarly encouraging to those who addressed him.  He listened  affirmatively, as it were.

       Mr. Mindon's spirits rose.  It was the first time that he had  ever had an audience.  He dragged his hearers over every stage of  his wrongs, losing sight of the vital injury in the enumeration of  incidental grievances.  He had the excited sense that at last  Millicent would know what he had always thought of her.

       Mr. Brownrigg looked at his watch, and Doctor Bonifant bent  his head as though under the weight of a pulpit peroration.  Meysy,  from the bed, watched the three men with the air of an expert who  holds the solution of the problem.

       He slipped to his feet as Mr. Mindon's speech flagged.

       "I suppose you've considered, Mindon, that it rests with you  to proclaim the fact that you're no longer—well, the chief object  of your wife's affection?"

       Mr. Mindon raised his head irritably; interrogation impeded  the flow of his diatribe.

       "That you—er—in short, create the situation by making it  known?" Meysy glanced at the Rector.  "Am I right, Bonifant?"

       The Rector took meditative counsel of his finger-tips; then  slowly,     as though formulating a dogma, "Under certain  conditions," he conceded, "what is unknown may be said to be non-existent."

       Mr. Mindon looked from one to the other.

       "Damn it, man—before it's too late," Meysy followed up,  "can't you see that * you're* the only person who can make you  ridiculous?"

       Mr. Brownrigg rose, and Mr. Mindon had the desperate sense  that the situation was slipping out of his grasp.

       "It rests with you," Doctor Bonifant murmured, "to save your  children from even the shadow of obloquy."

       "You can't stay here, at any rate," said Mr. Brownrigg  heavily.

       Mr. Mindon, who had risen, dropped weakly into his chair.  His  three counsellors were now all on their feet, taking up their hats  with the air of men who have touched the limit of duty.  In another  moment they would be gone, and with them Mr. Mindon's audience, his  support, his confidence in the immutability of his resolve.  He  felt himself no more than an evocation of their presence; and, in  dread of losing the identity they had created, he groped for a  detaining word.  "I sha'n't leave for New York till to-morrow."

       "To-morrow everything will be known," said Mr. Brownrigg, with  his hand on the door.

       Meysy glanced at his watch with a faint smile.  "It's to-morrow now," he added.

       He fell back, letting the older men pass out; but, turning as  though to follow, he felt a drowning clutch upon his arm.

       "It's for the children," Mr. Mindon stammered.
