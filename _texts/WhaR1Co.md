#                  "THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY"

      Three husbands seem to be the customary allowance granted by  novelists to the pushing, climbing, heartless type of American  woman, who will sacrifice everything to her social ambitions and  insatiable love of pleasure.  Three husbands, it will be  remembered, were given by Robert Grant to Selma White, the heroine  of *Unleavened Bread;* three also by Winston Churchill to the  heroine   of *A Modern Chronicle;* and similarly, Mrs.  Wharton is equally generous to Undine Spragg, the central figure of  her latest volume, *The Custom of the Country*.  It is a  brilliantly cynical picture of feminine ruthlessness, and a  fundamental inability to conceive of father, mother, friends and  husbands having been created for any other purpose than to gratify  every passing whim of this one beautiful and utterly spoiled young  woman.  Mrs. Wharton has painted Undine Spragg with an unsparing  mercilessness that almost makes the reader wince.  It is a splendid  and memorable piece of work, a portrait to form a worthy contrast  to the equally unforgettable one of Lily Bart.  But there is little  object in analysing in detail the separate episodes which make Miss  Spragg successively Mrs. Ralph Marvell, the Marquise de Chelles,  and Mrs. Elmer Moffatt.  They are of a nature that cannot be  adequately conveyed at second hand; it is not what happens that  matters, it is the play of human motives and human limitations  behind the happenings that makes this volume one of Mrs. Wharton's  finest achievements.  And the final touch of the closing paragraph  is a perfect climax, a crowning touch of comprehension of  monumental and perennial dissatisfaction:  

  Under all the dazzle a tiny black cloud remained.  She had  learned there was something she could never get, something that  neither beauty nor influence nor millions could ever buy for her.   She could never be an ambassador's wife; and as she advanced to  receive her first guests, she said to herself that it was the one  part she was really made for.
