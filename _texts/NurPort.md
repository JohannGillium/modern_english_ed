 For Rebecca Nurse 

    *This undated statement concerns a visit made to the Francis and Rebecca Nurse home sometime prior to March 23. The four visitors included Rebecca's sister Sarah's husband Peter Cloyce, as well as three prominent village inhabitants. They wanted to warn Rebecca that her name was being mentioned by some of the afflicted persons. Her reaction, and sincerity were poignant.*
