# LEAVES OF GRASS. 

     
## 1 — Poem of Walt Whitman, an American. 

     - I CELEBRATE myself,  
     And what I assume you shall assume, 
  - For every atom belonging to me, as good belongs  
     to you. 
      - I loafe and invite my soul, 
  - I lean and loafe at my ease, observing a spear of  
     summer grass. 
       - Houses and rooms are full of perfumes — the  
     shelves are crowded with perfumes, 
  - I breathe the fragrance myself, and know it and  
     like it, 
  - The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I  
     shall not let it. 
      - The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste  
     of the distillation, it is odorless, 
      - It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it, 
  - I will go to the bank by the wood, and become  
     undisguised and naked, 
  - I am mad for it to be in contact with me. 
       - The smoke of my own breath, 
  - Echoes, ripples, buzzed whispers, love-root, silk-
     thread, crotch, vine, 
  - My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my  
     heart, the passing of blood and air through  
     my lungs, 
  - The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of  
     the shore and dark-colored sea-rocks, and of  
     hay in the barn, 
  - The sound of the belched words of my voice,  
     words loosed to the eddies of the wind, 
  - A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching  
     around of arms, 
  - The play of shine and shade on the trees as the  
     supple boughs wag, 
  - The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or  
     along the fields and hill-sides, 
  - The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song  
     of me rising from bed and meeting the sun. 
       - Have you reckoned a thousand acres much?  
     have you reckoned the earth much? 
  - Have you practiced so long to learn to read? 
  - Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of  
     poems? 
      - Stop this day and night with me, and you shall  
     possess the origin of all poems, 
  - You shall possess the good of the earth and sun —  
     there are millions of suns left, 
  - You shall no longer take things at second or third  
     hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead,  
     nor feed on the spectres in books, 
  - You shall not look through my eyes either, nor  
     take things from me, 
  - You shall listen to all sides, and filter them from  
     yourself. 
       - I have heard what the talkers were talking, the  
     talk of the beginning and the end, 
  - But I do not talk of the beginning or the end. 
       - There was never any more inception than there is  
     now, 
  - Nor any more youth or age than there is now, 
  - And will never be any more perfection than there  
     is now, 
  - Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now. 
       - Urge, and urge, and urge, 
  - Always the procreant urge of the world. 
       - Out of the dimness opposite equals advance —  
     always substance and increase, always sex, 
  - Always a knit of identity, always distinction,  
     always a breed of life. 
            - To elaborate is no avail — learned and unlearned  
     feel that it is so. 
       - Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the  
     uprights, well entretied, braced in the  
     beams, 
  - Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical, 
  - I and this mystery here we stand. 
       - Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet  
     is all that is not my soul. 
       - Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved  
     by the seen, 
  - Till that becomes unseen, and receives proof in its  
     turn. 
       - Showing the best and dividing it from the worst,  
     age vexes age, 
  - Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of  
     things, while they discuss I am silent, and go  
     bathe and admire myself. 
       - Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and  
     of any man hearty and clean, 
  - Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and  
     none shall be less familiar than the rest. 
       - I am satisfied — I see, dance, laugh, sing; 
      - As the hugging and loving Bed-fellow sleeps at  
     my side through the night, and withdraws at  
     the peep of the day, 
  - And leaves for me baskets covered with white  
     towels, swelling the house with their plenty, 
  - Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization,  
     and scream at my eyes, 
  - That they turn from gazing after and down the  
     road, 
  - And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent, 
  - Exactly the contents of one, and exactly the con-
     tents of two, and which is ahead? 
       - Trippers and askers surround me, 
  - People I meet — the effect upon me of my early  
     life, of the ward and city I live in, of the  
     nation, 
  - The latest news, discoveries, inventions, societies,  
     authors old and new, 
  - My dinner, dress, associates, looks, work, compli-
     ments, dues, 
  - The real or fancied indifference of some man or  
     woman I love, 
  - The sickness of one of my folks, or of myself, or  
     ill-doing, or loss or lack of money, or depress-
     ions or exaltations, 
  - They come to me days and nights and go from  
     me again, 
  - But they are not the Me myself. 
             - Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I
     am, 
  - Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle,  
     unitary, 
  - Looks down, is erect, bends an arm on an  
     impalpable certain rest, 
  - Looks with its side-curved head, curious what will  
     come next, 
  - Both in and out of the game, and watching and  
     wondering at it. 
       - Backward I see in my own days where I sweated  
     through fog with linguists and contenders, 
  - I have no mockings or arguments — I witness and  
     wait. 
       - I believe in you, my soul — the other I am must  
     not abase itself to you, 
  - And you must not be abased to the other. 
       - Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from  
     your throat, 
  - Not words, not music or rhyme I want — not cus-
     tom or lecture, not even the best, 
  - Only the lull I like, the hum of your valved voice. 
       - I mind how we lay in June, such a transparent  
     summer morning, 
  - You settled your head athwart my hips, and gently  
     turned over upon me, 
      - And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and  
     plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, 
  - And reached till you felt my beard, and reached  
     till you held my feet. 
       - Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace  
     and joy and knowledge that pass all the art  
     and argument of the earth, 
  - And I know that the hand of God is the promise  
     of my own, 
  - And I know that the spirit of God is the brother  
     of my own, 
  - And that all the men ever born are also my bro-
     thers, and the women my sisters and lovers, 
  - And that a kelson of the creation is love, 
  - And limitless are leaves, stiff or drooping in the  
     fields, 
  - And brown ants in the little wells beneath them, 
  - And mossy scabs of the worm-fence, heaped stones,  
     elder, mullen, pokeweed. 
       - A child said, What is the grass? fetching it to me  
     with full hands; 
  - How could I answer the child? I do not know  
     what it is any more than he. 
       - I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out  
     of hopeful green stuff woven. 
       - Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, 
      - A scented gift and remembrancer, designedly  
     dropped, 
  - Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners,  
     that we may see and remark, and say Whose? 
       - Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced  
     babe of the vegetation. 
       - Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic, 
  - And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and  
     narrow zones, 
  - Growing among black folks as among white, 
  - Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give  
     them the same, I receive them the same. 
       - And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair  
     of graves. 
       - Tenderly will I use you, curling grass, 
  - It may be you transpire from the breasts of young  
     men, 
  - It may be if I had known them I would have loved  
     them, 
  - It may be you are from old people, and from  
     women, and from offspring taken soon out of  
     their mothers' laps, 
  - And here you are the mothers' laps. 
       - This grass is very dark to be from the white heads  
     of old mothers, 
      - Darker than the colorless beards of old men, 
  - Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of  
     mouths. 
       - O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues! 
  - And I perceive they do not come from the roofs  
     of mouths for nothing. 
       - I wish I could translate the hints about the dead  
     young men and women, 
  - And the hints about old men and mothers, and the  
     offspring taken soon-out of their laps. 
       - What do you think has become of the young and  
     old men? 
  - And what do you think has become of the women  
     and children? 
       - They are alive and well somewhere, 
  - The smallest sprout shows there is really no  
     death, 
  - And if ever there was, it led forward life, and does  
     not wait at the end to arrest it, 
  - And ceased the moment life appeared. 
       - All goes onward and outward — nothing collapses, 
  - And to die is different from what any one sup-
     posed, and luckier. 
           - Has any one supposed it lucky to be born? 
  - I hasten to inform him or her, it is just as lucky to  
     die, and I know it. 
       - I pass death with the dying, and birth with the  
     new-washed babe, and am not contained be-
     tween my hat and boots, 
  - And peruse manifold objects, no two alike, and  
     every one good, 
  - The earth good, and the stars good, and their ad-
     juncts all good. 
       - I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth, 
  - I am the mate and companion of people, all just  
     as immortal and fathomless as myself; 
  - They do not know how immortal, but I know. 
       - Every kind for itself and its own — for me mine,  
     male and female, 
  - For me those that have been boys and that love  
     women, 
  - For me the man that is proud, and feels how it  
     stings to be slighted, 
  - For me the sweetheart and the old maid — for me  
     mothers and the mothers of mothers, 
  - For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed  
     tears, 
  - For me children and the begetters of children. 
           - Who need be afraid of the merge? 
  - Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale, nor  
     discarded, 
  - I see through the broadcloth and gingham, whether  
     or no, 
  - And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless,  
     and can never be shaken away. 
       - The little one sleeps in its cradle, 
  - I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently  
     brush away flies with my hand. 
       - The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside  
     up the bushy hill, 
  - I peeringly view them from the top. 
       - The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the  
     bedroom, 
  - It is so — I witnessed the corpse — there the  
     pistol had fallen. 
       - The blab of the pave, the tires of carts, sluff of  
     boot-soles, talk of the promenaders, 
  - The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogat-
     ing thumb, the clank of the shod horses on  
     the granite floor, 
  - The snow-sleighs, the clinking, shouted jokes,  
     pelts of snow-balls, 
  - The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of  
     roused mobs, 
       - The flap of the curtained litter, the sick man in-
     side, borne to the hospital, 
  - The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the  
     blows and fall, 
  - The excited crowd, the policeman with his star,  
     quickly working his passage to the centre of  
     the crowd, 
  - The impassive stones that receive and return so  
     many echoes, 
  - The souls moving along — are they invisible,  
     while the least of the stones is visible? 
  - What groans of over-fed or half-starved who fall  
     sun-struck, or in fits, 
  - What exclamations of women taken suddenly, who  
     hurry home and give birth to babes, 
  - What living and buried speech is always vibrating  
     here, what howls restrained by decorum, 
  - Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers  
     made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips, 
  - I mind them or the resonance of them — I come  
     and I depart. 
       - The big doors of the country-barn stand open and  
     ready, 
  - The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the  
     slow-drawn wagon, 
  - The clear light plays on the brown gray and green  
     intertinged, 
  - The armfuls are packed to the sagging mow; 
       - I am there, I help, I came stretched atop of the  
     load, 
  - I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other; 
  - I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover  
     and timothy, 
  - And roll head over heels, and tangle my hair full  
     of wisps. 
       - Alone, far in the wilds and mountains, I hunt, 
  - Wandering, amazed at my own lightness and glee, 
  - In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass  
     the night, 
  - Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-killed game, 
  - Soundly falling asleep on the gathered leaves, my  
     dog and gun by my side. 
       - The Yankee clipper is under her three sky-sails,  
     she cuts the sparkle and scud, 
  - My eyes settle the land — I bend at her prow or  
     shout joyously from the deck. 
       - The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and  
     stopped for me, 
  - I tucked my trowser-ends in my boots and went  
     and had a good time, 
  - You should have been with us that day round the  
     chowder-kettle. 
       - I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air  
     in the far-west — the bride was a red girl, 
       - Her father and his friends sat near, cross-legged  
     and dumbly smoking — they had moccasins to  
     their feet and large thick blankets hanging  
     from their shoulders, 
  - On a bank lounged the trapper, he was dressed  
     mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls  
     protected his neck, 
  - One hand rested on his rifle, the other hand held  
     firmly the wrist of the red girl, 
  - She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her  
     coarse straight locks descended upon her  
     voluptuous limbs and reached to her feet. 
       - The runaway slave came to my house and  
     stopped outside, 
  - I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the  
     wood-pile, 
  - Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw  
     him limpsy and weak, 
  - And went where he sat on a log, and led him in  
     and assured him, 
  - And brought water and filled a tub for his sweated  
     body and bruised feet, 
  - And gave him a room that entered from my own,  
     and gave him some coarse clean clothes, 
  - And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes  
     and his awkwardness, 
  - And remember putting plasters on the galls of his  
     neck and ankles; 
       - He staid with me a week before he was recuper-
     ated and passed north, 
  - I had him sit next me at table — my fire-lock  
     leaned in the corner. 
       - Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore, 
  - Twenty-eight young men, and all so friendly, 
  - Twenty-eight years of womanly life, and all so  
     lonesome. 
       - She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank, 
  - She hides, handsome and richly drest, aft the  
     blinds of the window. 
       - Which of the young men does she like the best? 
  - Ah, the homeliest of them is beautiful to her. 
       - Where are you off to, lady? for I see you, 
  - You splash in the water there, yet stay stock  
     still in your room. 
       - Dancing and laughing along the beach came the  
     twenty-ninth bather, 
  - The rest did not see her, but she saw them and  
     loved them. 
       - The beards of the young men glistened with wet,  
     it ran from their long hair, 
  - Little streams passed all over their bodies. 
       - An unseen hand also passed over their bodies,
         - It descended tremblingly from their temples and
     ribs.
       - The young men float on their backs, their white  
     bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who  
     seizes fast to them, 
  - They do not know who puffs and declines with  
     pendant and bending arch, 
  - They do not think whom they souse with spray. 
       - The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or  
     sharpens his knife at the stall in the mar-
     ket, 
  - I loiter, enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and  
     break-down. 
       - Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ  
     the anvil, 
  - Each has his main-sledge — they are all out —  
     there is a great heat in the fire. 
       - From the cinder-strewed threshold I follow their  
     movements, 
  - The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with  
     their massive arms, 
  - Overhand the hammers roll, overhand so slow,  
     overhand so sure, 
  - They do not hasten, each man hits in his place. 
            - The negro holds firmly the reins of his four  
     horses, the block swags underneath on its  
     tied-over chain, 
  - The negro that drives the huge dray of the stone-
     yard, steady and tall he stands poised on one  
     leg on the string-piece, 
  - His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast,  
     and loosens over his hip-band, 
  - His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the  
     slouch of his hat away from his forehead, 
  - The sun falls on his crispy hair and moustache,  
     falls on the black of his polish'd and perfect  
     limbs. 
       - I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and  
     I do not stop there, 
  - I go with the team also. 
       - In me the caresser of life wherever moving, back-
     ward as well as forward slueing, 
  - To niches aside and junior bending. 
       - Oxen that rattle the yoke or halt in the shade!  
     what is that you express in your eyes? 
  - It seems to me more than all the print I have read  
     in my life. 
       - My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck,  
     on my distant and day-long ramble, 
  - They rise together, they slowly circle around; 
  - I believe in those winged purposes, 
       - And acknowledge, red, yellow, white, playing  
     within me, 
  - And consider green and violet, and the tufted  
     crown, intentional, 
  - And do not call the tortoise unworthy because  
     she is not something else, 
  - And the mocking-bird in the swamp never studied  
     the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me, 
  - And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out  
     of me. 
       - The wild gander leads his flock through the cool  
     night, 
  - Ya-honk! he says, and sounds it down to me like  
     an invitation; 
  - The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listen  
     close, 
  - I find its purpose and place up there toward the  
     November sky. 
       - The sharp-hoofed moose of the north, the cat on  
     the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog, 
  - The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her  
     teats, 
  - The brood of the turkey-hen, and she with her  
     half-spread wings, 
  - I see in them and myself the same old law. 
       - The press of my foot to the earth springs a hun-
     dred affections, 
       - They scorn the best I can do to relate them.
    - I am enamoured of growing outdoors, 
  - Of men that live among cattle, or taste of the  
     ocean or woods, 
  - Of the builders and steerers of ships, of the wield-
     ers of axes and mauls, of the drivers of  
     horses, 
  - I can eat and sleep with them week in and week  
     out. 
       - What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is  
     Me, 
  - Me going in for my chances, spending for vast  
     returns, 
  - Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that  
     will take me,

     works at his case, 
  - He turns his quid of tobacco, his eyes get blurred  
     with the manuscript; 
  - The malformed limbs are tied to the anatomist's  
     table, 
  - What is removed drops horribly in a pail; 
  - The quadroon girl is sold at the stand — the

     the wise, 
  - Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,

     man, 
  - Stuffed with the stuff that is coarse, and stuffed  
     with the stuff that is fine,

     nations, the smallest the same, the largest  
     the same, 
  - A southerner soon as a northerner, a planter non-
     chalant and hospitable,

     my joints the limberest joints on earth and  
     the sternest joints on earth, 
  - A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in  
     my deer-skin leggings, 
  - A boatman over lakes or bays, or along coasts —  
     a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye, 
  - A Louisianian or Georgian, a Poke-easy from  
     sand-hills and pines, 
  - At home on Canadian snow-shoes, or up in the  
     bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland, 
  - At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the

     sons, 
       - Of every hue, trade, rank, of every caste and re-
     ligion, 
  - Not merely of the New World, but of Africa,  
     Europe, Asia — a wandering savage, 
  - A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor,  
     lover, quaker, 
  - A prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician,  
     priest. 
       - I resist anything better than my own diversity, 
  - And breathe the air, and leave plenty after me, 
  - And am not stuck up, and am in my place. 
       - The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place, 
  - The suns I see, and the suns I cannot see, are  
     in their place, 
  - The palpable is in its place, and the impalpable  
     is in its place. 
       - These are the thoughts of all men in all ages  
     and lands, they are not original with me, 
  - If they are not yours as much as mine, they are  
     nothing, or next to nothing, 
  - If they do not enclose everything, they are next  
     to nothing, 
  - If they are not the riddle and the untying of the  
     riddle, they are nothing, 
  - If they are not just as close as they are distant,  
     they are nothing. 
            - This is the grass that grows wherever the land  
     is and the water is, 
  - This is the common air that bathes the globe. 
       - This is the breath of laws, songs, behaviour, 
  - This is the tasteless water of souls, this is the  
     true sustenance, 
  - It is for the illiterate, it is for the judges of the  
     supreme court, it is for the federal capitol  
     and the state capitols, 
  - It is for the admirable communes of literats,  
     composers, singers, lecturers, engineers, sa-
     vans, 
  - It is for the endless races of work-people, farm-
     ers, seamen. 
       - These are trills of thousands of clear cornets,  
     screams of octave flutes, strike of triangles. 
       - I play not a march for victors only, I play great  
     marches for conquered and slain persons. 
       - Have you heard that it was good to gain the day? 
  - I also say it is good to fall — battles are lost in  
     the same spirit in which they are won. 
       - I beat triumphal drums for the dead, I blow through  
     my embouchures my loudest and gayest music  
     to them, 
       - Vivas to those who have failed! and to those  
     whose war-vessels sank in the sea! and  
     those themselves who sank in the sea! 
  - And to all generals that lost engagements! and all  
     overcome heroes! and the numberless un-
     known heroes, equal to the greatest heroes  
     known! 
       - This is the meal pleasantly set, this is the meat  
     and drink for natural hunger, 
  - It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous  
      — I make appointments with all, 
  - I will not have a single person slighted or left  
     away, 
  - The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby in-
     vited — the heavy-lipped slave is invited,  
     the venerealee is invited, 
  - There shall be no difference between them and  
     the rest. 
       - This is the press of a bashful hand, this is the  
     float and odor of hair, 
  - This is the touch of my lips to yours, this is the  
     murmur of yearning, 
  - This is the far-off depth and height reflecting my  
     own face, 
  - This is the thoughtful merge of myself, and the  
     outlet again. 
       - Do you guess I have some intricate purpose? 
       - Well, I have — for the April rain has, and the mica  
     on the side of a rock has. 
       - Do you take it I would astonish? 
  - Does the daylight astonish? Does the early red-
     start, twittering through the woods? 
  - Do I astonish more than they? 
       - This hour I tell things in confidence, 
  - I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you. 
       - Who goes there! hankering, gross, mystical, nude? 
  - How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat? 
       - What is a man anyhow? What am I? What  
     are you? 
       - All I mark as my own, you shall offset it with  
     your own, 
  - Else it were time lost listening to me. 
       - I do not snivel that snivel the world over, 
  - That months are vacuums. and the ground but  
     wallow and filth, 
  - That life is a suck and a sell, and nothing remains  
     at the end but threadbare crape and tears. 
       - Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for  
     invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-
     removed, 
         - I cock my hat as I please, indoors or out.
    - Shall I pray? Shall I venerate and be cere-
     monious? 
  - I have pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, 
  - Counselled with doctors, calculated close, found no  
     sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones. 
       - In all people I see myself — none more, not one a  
     barleycorn less, 
  - And the good or bad I say of myself I say of  
     them. 
       - And I know I am solid and sound, 
  - To me the converging objects of the universe per-
     petually flow, 
  - All are written to me, and I must get what the  
     writing means. 
       - I know I am deathless, 
  - I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a  
     carpenter's compass, 
  - I know I shall not pass like a child's carlacue cut  
     with a burnt stick at night. 
       - I know I am August, 
  - I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be  
     understood, 
       - I see that the elementary laws never apologize, 
  - I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I  
     plant my house by, after all. 
       - I exist as I am, that is enough, 
  - If no other in the world be aware, I sit content, 
  - And if each and all be aware, I sit content. 
       - One world is aware, and by far the largest to me,  
     and that is myself, 
  - And whether I come to my own today, or in ten  
     thousand or ten million years, 
  - I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheer-
     fulness I can wait. 
       - My foothold is tenoned and mortised in granite, 
  - I laugh at what you call dissolution, 
  - And I know the amplitude of time. 
       - I am the poet of the body, 
  - And I am the poet of the soul. 
       - The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the  
     pains of hell are with me, 
  - The first I graft and increase upon myself, the  
     latter I translate into a new tongue. 
       - I am the poet of the woman the same as the man, 
  - And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a  
     man, 
       - And I say there is nothing greater than the mother  
     of men. 
       - I chant the chant of dilation or pride, 
  - We have had ducking and deprecating about  
     enough, 
  - I show that size is only development. 
       - Have you outstript the rest? are you the  
     President? 
  - It is a trifle — they will more than arrive there  
     every one, and still pass on. 
       - I am he that walks with the tender and growing  
     night, 
  - I call to the earth and sea, half-held by the night. 
       - Press close, bare-bosomed night! press close,  
     magnetic, nourishing night! 
  - Night of south winds! night of the large few  
     stars! 
  - Still, nodding night! med, naked, summer night! 
       - Smile, O voluptuous, cool-breathed earth! 
  - Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees! 
  - Earth of departed sunset! earth of the moun-
     tains, misty-topt! 
  - Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon, just  
     tinged with blue! 
            - Earth of shine and dark, mottling the tide of the  
     river! 
  - Earth of the limpid gray of clouds, brighter and  
     clearer for my sake! 
  - Far-swooping elbowed earth! rich, apple-blos-
     somed earth! 
  - Smile, for your lover comes! 
       - Prodigal, you have given me love! therefore I  
     to you give love! 
  - O unspeakable passionate love! 
       - Thruster holding me tight, and that I hold tight! 
  - We hurt each other as the bridegroom and the  
     bride hurt each other. 
       - You sea! I resign myself to you also, I guess  
     what you mean, 
  - I behold from the beach your crooked inviting  
     fingers, 
  - I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of  
     me, 
  - We must have a turn together — I undress —  
     hurry me out of sight of the land, 
  - Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse, 
  - Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you. 
       - Sea of stretched ground-swells! 
  - Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths! 
         - Sea of the brine of life! sea of unshovelled and
     always-ready graves! 
  - Howler and scooper of storms! capricious and  
     dainty sea! 
  - I am integral with you — I too am of one phase,  
     and of all phases. 
       - Partaker of influx and efflux, extoller of hate and  
     conciliation, 
  - Extoller of amies, and those that sleep in each  
     others' arms. 
       - I am he attesting sympathy, 
  - Shall I make my list of things in the house, and  
     skip the house that supports them? 
       - I am the poet of commonsense, and of the demon-
     strable, and of immortality, 
  - And am not the poet of goodness only — I do not  
     decline to be the poet of wickedness also. 
       - Washes and razors for foofoos — for me freckles  
     and a bristling beard. 
       - What blurt is this about virtue and about vice? 
  - Evil propels me, and reform of evil propels me —  
     I stand indifferent, 
  - My gait is no fault-finder's or rejecter's gait, 
  - I moisten the roots of all that has grown. 
            - Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging  
     pregnancy? 
  - Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be  
     worked over and rectified? 
       - I step up to say that what we do is right, and  
     what we affirm is right, and some is only the  
     ore of right, 
  - Witnesses of us, one side a balance, and the anti-
     podal side a balance, 
  - Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine, 
  - Thoughts and deeds of the present, our rouse and  
     early start. 
       - This minute that comes to me over the past de-
     cillions, 
  - There is no better than it and now. 
       - What behaved well in the past, or behaves well  
     today, is not such a wonder, 
  - The wonder is always and always how can there  
     be a mean man or an infidel. 
       - Endless unfolding of words of ages! 
  - And mine a word of the modern — a word en-
     masse, 
  - A word of the faith that never balks, 
  - One time as good as another time — here or  
     henceforward it is all the same to me, 
       - A word of reality, materialism first and last im-
     bueing. 
       - Hurrah for positive science! long live exact  
     demonstration! 
  - Fetch stonecrop, mix it with cedar and branches  
     of lilac, 
  - This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this  
     made a grammar of the old cartouches, 
  - These mariners put the ship through dangerous  
     unknown seas, 
  - This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel,  
     and this is a mathematician. 
       - Gentlemen, I receive you and attach and clasp  
     hands with you, 
  - The facts are useful and real — they are not my  
     dwelling — I enter by them to an area of the  
     dwelling. 
       - I am less the reminder of property or qualities,  
     and more the reminder of life, 
  - And go on the square for my own sake and for  
     other's sakes, 
  - And make short account of neuters and geldings,  
     and favor men and women fully equipped, 
  - And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugi-
     tives and them that plot and conspire. 
              - Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs,  
     a kosmos, 
  - Disorderly, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking, breed-
     ing, 
  - No sentimentalist, no stander above men and wo-
     men, or apart from them — no more modest  
     than immodest. 
       - Unscrew the locks from the doors! 
  - Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs! 
       - Whoever degrades another degrades me, and  
     whatever is done or said returns at last to  
     me, 
  - And whatever I do or say, I also return. 
       - Through me the afflatus surging and surging —  
     through me the current and index. 
       - I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign  
     of democracy, 
  - By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot  
     have their counterpart of on the same terms. 
       - Through me many long dumb voices, 
  - Voices of the interminable generations of slaves, 
  - Voices of prostitutes, and of deformed persons, 
  - Voices of the diseased and despairing, and of  
     thieves and dwarfs, 
  - Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, 
       - And of the threads that connect the stars, and of  
     wombs, and of the fatherstuff, 
  - And of the rights of them the others are down  
     upon, 
  - Of the trivial, flat, foolish, despised, 
  - Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung. 
       - Through me forbidden voices, 
  - Voices of sexes and lusts — voices veiled, and I  
     remove the veil, 
  - Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured. 
       - I do not press my finger across my mouth, 
  - I keep as delicate around the bowels as around  
     the head and heart, 
  - Copulation is no more rank to me than death is. 
       - I believe in the flesh and the appetites, 
  - Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each  
     part and tag of me is a miracle. 
       - Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy  
     whatever I touch or am touched from, 
  - The scent of these arm-pits is aroma finer than  
     prayer, 
  - This head is more than churches, bibles, creeds. 
       - If I worship any particular thing, it shall be some  
     of the spread of my own body, 
       - Translucent mould of me, it shall be you! 
  - Shaded ledges and rests, firm masculine coulter, it  
     shall be you! 
  - Whatever goes to the tilth of me, it shall be you! 
  - You my rich blood! your milky stream, pale strip-
     pings of my life! 
  - Breast that presses against other breasts, it shall  
     be you! 
  - My brain, it shall be your occult convolutions! 
  - Root of washed sweet-flag, timorous pond-snipe,  
     nest of guarded duplicate eggs, it shall be  
     you! 
  - Mixed tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall  
     be you! 
  - Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it  
     shall be you! 
  - Sun so generous, it shall be you! 
  - Vapors lighting and shading my face, it shall be  
     you! 
  - You sweaty brooks and dews, it shall be you! 
  - Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against  
     me, it shall be you! 
  - Broad muscular fields, branches of live-oak, loving  
     lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you! 
  - Hands I have taken, face I have kissed, mortal I  
     have ever touched, it shall be you! 
       - I dote on myself, there is that lot of me, and all so  
     luscious, 
       - Each moment, and whatever happens, thrills me  
     with joy. 
       - I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the  
     cause of my faintest wish, 
  - Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the  
     cause of the friendship I take again. 
       - To walk up my stoop is unaccountable, I pause to  
     consider if it really be, 
  - That I eat and drink is spectacle enough for the  
     great authors and schools, 
  - A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more  
     than the metaphysics of books. 
       - To behold the day-break! 
  - The little light fades the immense and diaphanous  
     shadows, 
  - The air tastes good to my palate. 
       - Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols,  
     silently rising, freshly exuding, 
  - Scooting obliquely high and low. 
       - Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous  
     prongs, 
  - Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven. 
       - The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close  
     of their junction, 
       - The heaved challenge from the east that moment  
     over my head, 
  - The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall  
     be master! 
       - Dazzling and tremendous, how quick the sun-rise  
     would kill me, 
  - If I could not now and always send sun-rise out  
     of me. 
       - We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the  
     sun, 
  - We found our own, my soul, in the calm and cool  
     of the day-break. 
       - My voice goes after what my eyes cannot  
     reach, 
  - With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds,  
     and volumes of worlds. 
       - Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to  
     measure itself. 
       - It provokes me forever, 
  - It says sarcastically, Walt, you understand  
     enough, why don't you let it out then? 
       - Come now, I will not be tantalized, you conceive  
     too much of articulation. 
            - Do you not know how the buds beneath are  
     folded? 
  - Waiting in gloom, protected by frost, 
  - The dirt receding before my prophetical screams, 
  - I underlying causes, to balance them at last, 
  - My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with  
     the meaning of things, 
  - Happiness, which, whoever hears me, let him or  
     her set out in search of this day. 
       - My final merit I refuse you — I refuse putting  
     from me the best I am. 
       - Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass  
     me, 
  - I crowd your noisiest talk by looking toward you. 
       - Writing and talk do not prove me, 
  - I carry the plenum of proof, and every thing else,  
     in my face, 
  - With the hush of my lips I confound the topmost  
     skeptic. 
       - I think I will do nothing for a long time but listen, 
  - To accrue what I hear into myself, to let sounds  
     contribute toward me. 
       - I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat,  
     gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my  
     meals. 
            - I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human  
     voice, 
  - I hear all sounds as they are tuned to their uses,  
     sounds of the city and sounds out of the city,  
     sounds of the day and night, 
  - Talkative young ones to those that like them, the  
     recitative of fish-pedlars and fruit-pedlars, the  
     loud laugh of work-people at their meals, 
  - The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint  
     tones of the sick, 
  - The judge with hands tight to the desk, his  
     shaky lips pronouncing a death-sentence, 
  - The heave'e'yo of stevedores unlading ships by the  
     wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters, 
  - The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the  
     whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-
     carts, with premonitory tinkles and colored  
     lights, 
  - The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of  
     approaching cars, 
  - The slow-march played at night at the head of the  
     association, 
  - They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are  
     draped with black muslin. 
       - I hear the violincello or man's heart's complaint, 
  - I hear the keyed cornet, it glides quickly in  
     through my ears, it shakes mad-sweet pangs  
     through my belly and breast. 
            - I hear the chorus, it is a grand-opera — this in-
     deed is music! 
       - A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me, 
  - The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling  
     me full. 
       - I hear the trained soprano, she convulses me like  
     the climax of my love-grip, 
  - The orchestra wrenches such ardors from me, I  
     did not know I possessed them, 
  - It throbs me to gulps of the farthest down horror, 
  - It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are licked  
     by the indolent waves, 
  - I am exposed, cut by bitter and poisoned hail, 
  - Steeped amid honeyed morphine, my windpipe  
     squeezed in the fakes of death, 
  - Let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles, 
  - And that we call Being. 
       - To be in any form, what is that? 
  - If nothing lay more developed, the quahaug in its  
     callous shell were enough. 
       - Mine is no callous shell, 
  - I have instant conductors all over me, whether I  
     pass or stop, 
  - They seize every object and lead it harmlessly  
     through me. 
            - I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am  
     happy, 
  - To touch my person to some one else's is about  
     as much as I can stand. 
       - Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new  
     identity, 
  - Flames and ether making a rush for my veins, 
  - Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to  
     help them, 
  - My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike  
     what is hardly different from myself, 
  - On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my  
     limbs, 
  - Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld  
     drip, 
  - Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial, 
  - Depriving me of my best, as for a purpose, 
  - Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare  
     waist, 
  - Deluding my confusion with the calm of the  
     sun-light and pasture-fields, 
  - Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away, 
  - They bribed to swap off with touch, and go and  
     graze at the edges of me, 
  - No consideration, no regard for my draining  
     strength or my anger, 
  - Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them  
     awhile, 
         - Then all uniting to stand on a head-land and  
     worry me. 
       - The sentries desert every other part of me, 
  - They have left me helpless to a red marauder, 
  - They all come to the head-land, to witness and  
     assist against me. 
       - I am given up by traitors! 
  - I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody  
     else am the greatest traitor, 
  - I went myself first to the head-land, my own hands  
     carried me there. 
       - You villain touch! what are you doing? my  
     breath is tight in its throat, 
  - Unclench your floodgates! you are too much for  
     me. 
       - Blind, loving, wrestling touch! sheathed, hooded,  
     sharp-toothed touch! 
  - Did it make you ache so, leaving me? 
       - Parting, tracked by arriving — perpetual payment  
     of the perpetual loan, 
  - Rich showering rain, and recompense richer after-
     ward. 
       - Sprouts take and accumulate — stand by the curb  
     prolific and vital, 
  - Landscapes, projected, masculine, full-sized, golden. 
            - All truths wait in all things, 
  - They neither hasten their own delivery, nor resist  
     it, 
  - They do not need the obstetric forceps of the  
     surgeon, 
  - The insignificant is as big to me as any, 
  - What is less or more than a touch? 
       - Logic and sermons never convince, 
  - The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul. 
       - Only what proves itself to every man and woman  
     is so, 
  - Only what nobody denies is so. 
       - A minute and a drop of me settle my brain, 
  - I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and  
     lamps, 
  - And a compend of compends is the meat of a man  
     or woman, 
  - And a summit and flower there is the feeling they  
     have for each other, 
  - And they are to branch boundlessly out of that  
     lesson until it becomes omnific, 
  - And until every one shall delight us, and we  
     them. 
       - I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journcy-
     work of the stars, 
       - And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of  
     sand, and the egg of the wren, 
  - And the tree-toad is a chef-d'ouvre for the highest, 
  - And the running blackberry would adorn the  
     parlors of heaven, 
  - And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn  
     all machinery, 
  - And the cow crunching with depressed head sur-
     passes any statue, 
  - And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sex-
     tillions of infidels, 
  - And I could come every afternoon of my life to  
     look at the farmer's girl boiling her iron tea-
     kettle and baking short-cake. 
       - I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded  
     moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots, 
  - And am stucco'd with quadrupeds and birds all over, 
  - And have distanced what is behind me for good  
     reasons, 
  - And call any thing close again, when I desire it. 
       - In vain the speeding or shyness, 
  - In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat  
     against my approach, 
  - In vain the mastadon retreats beneath its own  
     powdered bones, 
  - In vain objects stand leagues off, and assume  
     manifold shapes, 
       - In vain the ocean settling in hollows, and the great  
     monsters lying low, 
  - In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky, 
  - In vain the snake slides through the creepers and  
     logs, 
  - In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the  
     woods, 
  - In vain the razor-billed auk sails far north to  
     Labrador, 
  - I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure  
     of the cliff. 
       - I think I could turn and live with animals, they  
     are so placid and self-contained, 
  - I stand and look at them sometimes half the day  
     long. 
       - They do not sweat and whine about their condi-
     tion, 
  - They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for  
     their sins, 
  - They do not make me sick discussing their duty  
     to God, 
  - No one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with  
     the mania of owning things, 
  - Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that  
     lived thousands of years ago, 
  - Not one is respectable or industrious over the  
     whole earth. 
            - So they show their relations to me, and I accept  
     them, 
  - They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them  
     plainly in their possession. 
       - I do not know where they got those tokens, 
  - I may have passed that way untold times ago and  
     negligently dropt them, 
  - Myself moving forward then and now and forever, 
  - Gathering and showing more always and with  
     velocity, 
  - Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these  
     among them, 
  - Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my re-
     membrancers, 
  - Picking out here one that I love, choosing to go  
     with him on brotherly terms. 
       - A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and respon-
     sive to my caresses, 
  - Head high in the forehead, wide between the  
     ears, 
  - Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground, 
  - Eyes well apart, full of sparkling wickedness, ears  
     finely cut, flexibly moving. 
       - His nostrils dilate, my heels embrace him, his  
     well-built limbs tremble with pleasure, we  
     speed around and return. 
            - I but use you a moment, then I resign you stal-
     lion, do not need your paces, out-gallop them, 
  - Myself, as I stand or sit, passing faster than you. 
       - Swift wind! space! my soul! now I know it is  
     true, what I guessed at, 
  - What I guessed when I loafed on the grass, 
  - What I guessed while I lay alone in my bed, and  
     again as I walked the beach under the paling  
     stars of the morning. 
       - My ties and ballasts leave me — I travel, I sail,  
     my elbows rest in the sea-gaps, 
  - I skirt the sierras, my palms cover continents, 
  - I am afoot with my vision. 
       - By the city's quadrangular houses, in log-huts,  
     camping with lumber-men, 
  - Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch  
     and rivulet bed, 
  - Weeding my onion-patch, hoeing rows of carrots  
     and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in  
     forests, 
  - Prospecting, gold-digging, girdiing the trees of a  
     new purchase, 
  - Scorched ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my  
     boat down the shallow river, 
  - Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb  
     overhead, where the buck turns furiously at  
     the hunter, 
       - Where the rattle-snake suns his flabby length on  
     a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish, 
  - Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps  
     by the bayou, 
  - Where the black bear is searching for roots or  
     honey, where the beaver pats the mud with  
     his paddle-tail, 
  - Over the growing sugar, over the cotton-plant,  
     over the rice in its low moist field, 
  - Over the sharp-peaked farm-house, with its scal-
     loped scum and slender shoots from the gut-
     ters, 
  - Over the western persimmon, over the long-leaved  
     corn, over the delicate blue-flowered flax, 
  - Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer  
     and buzzer there with the rest, 
  - Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and  
     shades in the breeze, 
  - Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up,  
     holding on by low scragged limbs, 
  - Walking the path worn in the grass and beat  
     through the leaves of the brush, 
  - Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods  
     and the wheat-lot, 
  - Where the bat flies in the July eve, where the  
     great gold-bug drops through the dark, 
  - Where the flails keep time on the barn floor, 
  - Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old  
     tree and flows to the meadow, 
       - Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the  
     tremulous shuddering of their hides, 
  - Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where  
     andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cob-
     webs fall in festoons from the rafters, 
  - Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is  
     whirling its cylinders, 
  - Wherever the human heart beats with terrible  
     throes out of its ribs, 
  - Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft,  
     floating in it myself and looking composedly  
     down, 
  - Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose,  
     where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in  
     the dented sand, 
  - Where the she-whale swims with her calves and  
     never forsakes them, 
  - Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long  
     pennant of smoke, 
  - Where the ground-shark's fin cuts like a black  
     chip out of the water, 
  - Where the half-burned brig is riding on unknown  
     currents, 
  - Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the  
     dead are corrupting below, 
  - Where the striped and starred flag is borne at the  
     head of the regiments, 
  - Approaching Manhattan, up by the long-stretching  
     island, 
         - Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil  
     over my countenance, 
  - Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard  
     wood outside, 
  - Upon the race-course, or enjoying pic-nics or jigs,  
     or a good game of base-ball, 
  - At he-festivals, with blackguard jibes, ironical li-
     cense, bull-dances, drinking, laughter, 
  - At the cider-mill, tasting the sweet of the brown  
     sqush, sucking the juice through a straw, 
  - At apple-peelings, wanting kisses for all the red  
     fruit I find, 
  - At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings,  
      
  - Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gur-
     gles, cackles, screams, weeps, 
  - Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where  
     the dry-stalks are scattered, where the brood  
     cow waits in the hovel, 
  - Where the bull advances to do his masculine  
     work, where the stud to the mare, where the  
     cock is treading the hen, 
  - Where heifers browse, where geese nip their food  
     with short jerks, 
  - Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limit-
     less and lonesome prairie, 
  - Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread  
     of the square miles far and near, 
       - Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the  
     neck of the long-lived swan is curving and  
     winding, 
  - Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore,  
     where she laughs her near-human laugh, 
  - Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the  
     garden, half-hid by the high weeds, 
  - Where band-necked partridges roost in a ring on  
     the ground with their heads out, 
  - Where burial coaches enter the arched gates of a  
     cemetery, 
  - Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow  
     and icicled trees, 
  - Where the yellow-crowned heron comes to the  
     edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon  
     small crabs, 
  - Where the splash of swimmers and divers cool  
     the warm noon, 
  - Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on  
     the walnut-tree over the well, 
  - Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with  
     silver-wired leaves, 
  - Through the salt-lick or orange glade, under coni-
     cal firs, 
  - Through the gymnasium, through the curtained  
     saloon, through the office or public hall, 
  - Pleased with the native, pleased with the foreign,  
     pleased with the new and old, 
       - Pleased with women, the homely as well as the  
     handsome, 
  - Pleased with the quakeress as she puts off her  
     bonnet and talks melodiously, 
  - Pleased with the tunes of the choir of the white-
     washed church, 
  - Pleased with the earnest words of the sweating  
     Methodist preacher, or any preacher — look-
     ing seriously at the camp-meeting, 
  - Looking in at the shop-windows in Broadway the  
     whole forenoon, pressing the flesh of my nose  
     to the thick plate-glass, 
  - Wandering the same afternoon with my face  
     turned up to the clouds, 
  - My right and left arms round the sides of two  
     friends, and I in the middle; 
  - Coming home with the bearded and dark-cheeked  
     bush-boy, riding behind him at the drape of  
     the day, 
  - Far from the settlements, studying the print of  
     animals' feet, or the moccasin print, 
  - By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a  
     feverish patient, 
  - By the coffined corpse when all is still examin-
     ing with a candle, 
  - Voyaging to every port to dicker and adven-
     ture, 
  - Hurrying with the modern crowd, as eager and  
     fickle as any, 
       - Hot toward one I hate ready in my madness to  
     knife him, 
  - Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts  
     gone from me a long while, 
  - Walking the old hills of Judea, with the beautiful  
     gentle god by my side, 
  - Speeding through space, speeding through heaven  
     and the stars, 
  - Speeding amid the seven satellites, and the broad  
     ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand  
     miles, 
  - Speeding with tailed meteors, throwing fire-balls  
     like the rest, 
  - Carrying the crescent child that carries its own  
     full mother in its belly, 
  - Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, 
  - Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing, 
  - I tread day and night such roads. 
       - I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the  
     product, 
  - And look at quintillions ripened, and look at quin-
     tillions green. 
       - I fly the flight of the fluid and swallowing soul, 
  - My course runs below the soundings of plummets. 
       - I help myself to material and immaterial, 
  - No guard can shut me off, no law can prevent me. 
            - I anchor my ship for a little while only, 
  - My messengers continually cruise away, or bring  
     their returns to me. 
       - I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping  
     chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to  
     topples of brittle and blue. 
       - I ascend to the fore-truck, I take my place late at  
     night in the crow's-nest, we sail through the  
     arctic sea, it is plenty light enough, 
  - Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on  
     the wonderful beauty, 
  - The enormous masses of ice pass me and I  
     pass them, the scenery is plain in all direc-
     tions, 
  - The white-topped mountains show in the dis-
     tance, I fling out my fancies toward them, 
  - We are approaching some great battle-field in  
     which we are soon to be engaged, 
  - We pass the colossal out-posts of the encamp-
     ments, we pass with still feet and caution, 
  - Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast  
     and ruined city, the blocks and fallen archi-
     tecture more than all the living cities of the  
     globe. 
       - I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading  
     watchfires. 
            - I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with  
     the bride myself, 
  - I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips. 
       - My voice is the wife's voice, the screech by the  
     rail of the stairs, 
  - They fetch my man's body up, dripping and  
     drowned. 
       - I understand the large hearts of heroes, 
  - The courage of present times and all times, 
  - How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless  
     wreck of the steam-ship, and death chasing it  
     up and down the storm, 
  - How he knuckled tight, and gave not back one  
     inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of  
     nights, 
  - And chalked in large letters, Be of good cheer,  
     We will not desert you, 
  - How he saved the drifting company at last, 
  - How the lank loose-gowned women looked when  
     boated from the side of their prepared graves, 
  - How the silent old-faced infants, and the lifted  
     sick, and the sharp-lipped unshaved men, 
  - All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it  
     becomes mine, 
  - I am the man, I suffered, I was there. 
       - The disdain and calmness of martyrs, 
       - The mother, condemned for a witch, burnt with  
     dry wood, her children gazing on, 
  - The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by  
     the fence, blowing, covered with sweat, 
  - The twinges that sting like needles his legs and  
     neck, the murderous buck-shot and the bullets, 
  - All these I feel or am. 
       - I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the  
     dogs, 
  - Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again  
     crack the marksmen, 
  - I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs,  
     thinned with the ooze of my skin, 
  - I fall on the weeds and stones, 
  - The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close, 
  - Taunt my dizzy ears, beat me violently over the  
     head with whip-stocks. 
       - Agonies are one of my changes of garments, 
  - I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I  
     myself become the wounded person, 
  - My hurt turns livid upon me as I lean on a cane  
     and observe. 
       - I am the mashed fireman with breastbone broken,  
     tumbling walls buried me in their debris, 
  - Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling  
     shouts of my comrades, 
       - I heard the distant click of their picks and shov-
     els, 
  - They have cleared the beams away, they tenderly  
     life me forth. 
       - I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading  
     hush is for my sake. 
  - Painless after all I lie, exhausted but not so un-
     happy, 
  - White and beautiful are the faces around me, the  
     heads are bared of their fire-caps, 
  - The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the  
     torches. 
       - Distant and dead resuscitate, 
  - They show as the dial or move as the hands of  
     me — I am the clock myself. 
       - I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort's bombard-
     ment, I am there again. 
       - Again the reveille of drummers, again the attack-
     ing cannon, mortars, howitzers, 
  - Again the attacked send cannon responsive; 
  - I take part, I see and hear the whole, 
  - The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aimed  
     shots, 
  - The ambulanza slowly passing, trailing its red  
     drip, 
       - Workmen searching after damages, making indis-
     pensable repairs, 
  - The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the  
     fan-shaped explosion, 
  - The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron,  
     high in the air. 
       - Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he  
     furiously waves with his hand, 
  - He gasps through the clot, Mind not me — mind —  
     the entrenchments. 
       - I tell not the fall of Alamo, not one escaped to tell  
     the fall of Alamo, 
  - The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo. 
       - Hear now the tale of a jet-black sunrise, 
  - Hear of the murder in cold-blood of four hundred  
     and twelve young men. 
       - Retreating, they had formed in a hollow square,  
     with their baggage for breast-works, 
  - Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy's,  
     nine times their number, was the price they  
     took in advance, 
  - Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition  
     gone, 
  - They treated for an honorable capitulation, re-
     ceived writing and seal, gave up their arms,  
     marched back prisoners of war. 
            - They were the glory of the race of rangers, 
  - Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, court-
     ship, 
  - Large, turbulent, brave, handsome, generous,  
     proud, affectionate, 
  - Bearded, sunburnt, dressed in the free costume of  
     hunters, 
  - Not a single one over thirty years of age. 
       - The second Sunday morning they were brought  
     out in squads and massacred — it was beauti-
     ful early summer, 
  - The work commenced about five o'clock and was  
     over by eight. 
       - None obeyed the command to kneel, 
  - Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood  
     stark and straight, 
  - A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the  
     living and dead lay together, 
  - The maimed and mangled dug in the dirt, the  
     new-comers saw them there, 
  - Some, half-killed, attempted to crawl away, 
  - These were dispatched with bayonets, or battered  
     with the blunts of muskets, 
  - A youth not seventeen years old seized his assas-
     sin, till two more came to release him, 
  - The three were all torn, and covered with the  
     boy's blood. 
            - At eleven o'clock began the burning of the bodies; 
  - That is the tale of the murder of the four hun-
     dred and twelve young men, 
  - And that was a jet-black sunrise. 
       - Did you read in the sea-books of the old-fashioned  
     frigate-fight? 
  - Did you learn who won by the light of the moon  
     and stars? 
       - Our foe was no skulk in his ship, I tell you, 
  - His was the English pluck, and there is no tougher  
     or truer, and never was, and never will be, 
  - Along the lowered eve he came, horribly raking  
     us. 
       - We closed with him, the yards entangled, the can-
     non touched, 
  - My captain lashed fast with his own hands. 
       - We had received some eighteen-pound shots un-
     der the water, 
  - On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst  
     at the first fire, killing all around and blowing  
     up overhead. 
       - Ten o'clock at night and the full moon shining,  
     and the leaks on the gain, and five feet of  
     water reported, 
       - The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined  
     in the after-hold, to give them a chance for  
     themselves. 
       - The transit to and from the magazine was now  
     stopped by the sentinels, 
  - They saw so many strange faces that they did not  
     know whom to trust. 
       - Our frigate was afire, the other asked if we de-
     manded quarter? if our colors were struck  
     and the fighting done? 
       - I laughed content when I heard the voice of my  
     little captain, 
  - We have not struck, he composedly cried, We  
     have just begun our part of the fighting. 
       - Only three guns were in use, 
  - One was directed by the captain himself against  
     the enemy's main-mast, 
  - Two, well served with grape and canister,  
     silenced his musketry and cleared his  
     decks. 
       - The tops alone seconded the fire of this little bat-
     tery, especially the main-top, 
  - They all held out bravely during the whole of the  
     action. 
       - Not a moment's cease, 
       - The leaks gained fast on the pumps, the fire eat  
     toward the powder-magazine, 
  - One of the pumps was shot away, it was generally  
     thought we were sinking. 
       - Serene stood the little captain, 
  - He was not hurried, his voice was neither high  
     nor low, 
  - His eyes gave more light to us than our battle-
     lanterns. 
       - Toward twelve at night, there in the beams of the  
     moon they surrendered to us. 
       - Stretched and still lay the midnight, 
  - Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the  
     darkness, 
  - Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, prepara-
     tions to pass to the one we had conquered, 
  - The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his  
     orders through a countenance white as a  
     sheet, 
  - Near by, the corpse of the child that served in the  
     cabin, 
  - The dead face of an old salt with long white hair  
     and carefully curled whiskers, 
  - The flames, spite of all that could be done, flicker-
     ing aloft and below, 
  - The husky voices of the two or three officers yet  
     fit for duty, 
       - Formless stacks of bodies, bodies by them-
     selves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and  
     spars, 
  - Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of  
     the soothe of waves, 
  - Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels,  
     strong scent, 
  - Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass  
     and fields by the shore, death-messages  
     given in change to survivors, 
  - The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth  
     of his saw, 
  - Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild  
     scream, long dull tapering groan, 
  - These so, these irretrievable. 
       - O Christ! My fit is mastering me! 
  - What the rebel said, gaily adjusting his throat to  
     the rope-noose, 
  - What the savage at the stump, his eye-sockets  
     empty, his mouth spirting whoops and defi-
     ance, 
  - What stills the traveler come to the vault at  
     Mount Vernon, 
  - What sobers the Brooklyn boy as he looks down  
     the shores of the Wallabout and remembers  
     the prison ships, 
  - What burnt the gums of the red-coat at Saratoga  
     when he surrendered his brigades, 
       - These become mine and me every one, and they  
     are but little, 
  - I become as much more as I like. 
       - I become any presence or truth of humanity here, 
  - And see myself in prison shaped like another  
     man, 
  - And feel the dull unintermitted pain. 
       - For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their  
     carbines and keep watch, 
  - It is I let out in the morning and barred at night. 
       - Not a mutineer walks hand-cuffed to the jail, but I  
     am hand-cuffed to him and walk by his side, 
  - I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent  
     one, with sweat on my twitching lips. 
       - Not a youngster is taken for larceny, but I go up  
     too, and am tried and sentenced. 
       - Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp, but I  
     also lie at the last gasp, 
  - My face is ash-colored, my sinews gnarl, away  
     from me people retreat. 
       - Askers embody themselves in me, and I am em-
     bodied in them, 
  - I project my hat, sit shame-faced, beg. 
            - I rise extatic through all, sweep with the true  
     gravitation, 
  - The whirling and whirling is elemental within  
     me. 
       - Somehow I have been stunned. Stand back! 
  - Give me a little time beyond my cuffed head,  
     slumbers, dreams, gaping, 
  - I discover myself on the yerge of a usual mistake. 
       - That I could forget the mockers and insults! 
  - That I could forget the trickling tears, and the  
     blows of the bludgeons and hammers! 
  - That I could look with a separate look on my own  
     crucifixion and bloody crowning! 
       - I remember, I resume the overstaid fraction, 
  - The grave of rock multiplies what has been con-
     fided to it, or to any graves, 
  - The corpses rise, the gashes heal, the fastenings  
     roll away. 
       - I troop forth replenished with supreme power,  
     one of an average unending procession, 
  - We walk the roads of Ohio, Massachusetts, Vir-
     ginia, Wisconsin, Manhattan Island, New  
     Orleans, Texas, Montreal, San Francisco,  
     Charleston, Havana, Mexico, 
  - Inland and by the sea-coast and boundary lines,  
     and we pass all boundary lines. 
              - Our swift ordinances are on their way over the  
     whole earth, 
  - The blossoms we wear in our hats are the growth  
     of two thousand years. 
       - Eleves, I salute you! 
  - I see the approach of your numberless gangs, I  
     see you understand yourselves and me, 
  - And know that they who have eyes are divine,  
     and the blind and lame are equally divine, 
  - And that my steps drag behind yours, yet go be-
     fore them, 
  - And are aware how I am with you no more than  
     I am with everybody. 
       - The friendly and flowing savage, Who is he? 
  - Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mas-
     tering it? 
       - Is he some south-westerner, raised out-doors?  
     Is he Canadian? 
  - Is he from the Mississippi country? from Iowa,  
     Oregon, California? from the mountains?  
     prairie-life, bush-life? from the sea? 
  - Wherever he goes men and women accept and  
     desire him; 
  - They desire he should like them, touch them  
     speak to them, stay with them. 
            - Behaviour lawless as snow-flakes, words simple  
     as grass, uncombed head, laughter, naivete, 
  - Slow-stepping feet, common features, common  
     modes and emanations, 
  - They descend in new forms from the tips of his  
     fingers, 
  - They are wafted with the odor of his body or  
     breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes. 
       - Flaunt of the sun-shine, I need not your bask, lie  
     over! 
  - You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and  
     depths also. 
       - Earth! you seem to look for something at my  
     hands, 
  - Say old top-knot! what do you want? 
       - Man or woman! I might tell how I like you, but  
     cannot, 
  - And might tell what it is in me, and what it is in  
     you, but cannot, 
  - And might tell the pinings I have, the pulse of my  
     nights and days. 
       - Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity, 
  - What I give I give out of myself. 
       - You there, impotent, loose in the knees, open your  
     scarfed chops till I blow grit within you, 
       - Spread your palms, and lift the flaps of your  
     pockets, 
  - I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores  
     plenty and to spare, 
  - And any thing I have I bestow; 
  - I do not ask who you are, that is not important to  
     me, 
  - You can do nothing, and be nothing, but what I  
     will infold you. 
       - To a drudge of the cotton-fields or cleaner of  
     privies I lean — on his right cheek I put the  
     family kiss, 
  - And in my soul I swear, I never will deny him. 
       - On women fit for conception I start bigger and  
     nimbler babes, 
  - This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arro-
     gant republics. 
       - To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the  
     knob of the door, 
  - Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed, 
  - Let the physician and the priest go home. 
       - I seize the descending man, I raise him with re-
     sistless will. 
       - O despairer, here is my neck, 
       - By God! you shall not go down! hang your  
     whole weight upon me. 
       - I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you  
     up, 
  - Every room of the house do I fill with an armed  
     force, lovers of me, bafflers of graves, 
  - Sleep! I and they keep guard all night, 
  - Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger  
     upon you, 
  - I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you  
     to myself, 
  - And when you rise in the morning you will find  
     what I tell you is so. 
       - I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant  
     on their backs, 
  - And for strong upright men I bring yet more  
     needed help. 
       - I heard what was said of the universe, 
  - Heard it and heard it of several thousand years; 
  - It is middling well as far as it goes, but is that  
     all? 
       - Magnifying and applying come I, 
  - Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters, 
  - The most they offer for mankind and eternity less  
     than a spirt of my own seminal wet, 
       - Taking myself the exactdimensions of Jehovah —  
     lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, Hercules  
     his grandson — buying drafts of Osiris, Isis,  
     Belus, Brahma, Buddha — in my portfolio  
     placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the  
     crucifix engraved — with Odin, and the  
     hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and  
     image, 
  - Taking them all for what they are worth, and not  
     a cent more, 
  - Admitting they were alive and did the work of  
     their day, 
  - Admitting they bore mites, as for unfledged birds,  
     who have now to rise and fly and sing for  
     themselves, 
  - Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out bet-
     ter in myself — bestowing them freely on  
     each man and woman I see, 
  - Discovering as much, or more, in a framer framing  
     a house, 
  - Putting higher claims for him there with his  
     rolled-up sleeves, driving the mallet and  
     chisel, 
  - Not objecting to special revelations, considering a  
     curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my  
     hand just as curious as any revelation, 
  - Those ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder  
     ropes no less to me than the gods of the  
     antique wars, 
       - Minding their voices peal through the crash of  
     destruction, 
  - Their brawny limbs passing safe over charred  
     laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt  
     out of the flames, 
  - By the mechanic's wife with her babe at her  
     nipple interceding for every person born, 
  - Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from  
     three lusty angels with shirts bagged out at  
     their waists, 
  - The sang-toothed hostler with red hair redeeming  
     sins past and to come, 
  - Selling all he possesses, travelling on foot to fee  
     lawyers for his brother, and sit by him while  
     he is tried for forgery; 
  - What was strewn in the amplest strewing the  
     square rod about me, and not filling the square  
     rod then, 
  - The bull and the bug never worshipped half  
     enough, 
  - Dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamed, 
  - The supernatural of no account — myself waiting  
     my time to be one of the supremes, 
  - The day getting ready for me when I shall do  
     as much good as the best, and be as pro-
     digious, 
  - Guessing when I am it will not tickle me much  
     to receive puffs out of pulpit or print; 
  - By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator! 
       - Putting myself here and now to the ambushed  
     womb of the shadows! 
       - A call in the midst of the crowd, 
  - My own voice, orotund, sweeping, final. 
       - Come my children, 
  - Come my boys and girls, my women, household,  
     intimates, 
  - Now the performer launches his nerve, he has  
     passed his prelude on the reeds within. 
       - Easily written, loose-fingered chords! I feel the  
     thrum of their climax and close. 
       - My head slues round on my neck, 
  - Music rolls, but not from the organ — folks are  
     around me, but they are no household of mine. 
       - Ever the hard unsunk ground, 
  - Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and  
     downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless  
     tides, 
  - Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing,  
     wicked, real, 
  - Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorned  
     thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts, 
  - Ever the vexer's hoot! hoot! till we find where  
     the sly one hides, and bring him forth; 
       - Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life, 
  - Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the tressels  
     of death. 
       - Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking, 
  - To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally  
     spooning, 
  - Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast  
     never once going, 
  - Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then  
     the chaff for payment receiving, 
  - A few idly owning, and they the wheat continu-
     ally claiming. 
       - This is the city, and I am one of the citizens, 
  - Whatever interests the rest interests me — poli-
     tics, markets, newspapers, schools, benevolent  
     societies, improvements, banks, tariffs, steam-
     ships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate,  
     personal estate. 
       - They who piddle and patter here in collars and  
     tailed coats, I am aware who they are — they  
     are not worms or fleas, 
  - I acknowledge the duplicates of myself — the weak-
     est and shallowest is deathless with me, 
  - What I do and say, the same waits for them; 
  - Every thought that flounders in me, the same  
     flounders in them. 
              - I know perfectly well my own egotism, 
  - I know my omnivorous words, and cannot say any  
     less, 
  - And would fetch you, whoever you are, flush with  
     myself. 
       - My words are words of a questioning, and to in-
     dicate reality; 
  - This printed and bound book — but the printer,  
     and the printing-office boy? 
  - The marriage estate and settlement — but the  
     body and mind of the bridegroom? also those  
     of the bride? 
  - The panorama of the sea — but the sea itself? 
  - The well-taken photographs — but your wife or  
     friend close and solid in your arms? 
  - The fleet of ships of the line, and all the modern  
     improvements — but the craft and pluck of  
     the admiral? 
  - The dishes and fare and furniture — but the host  
     and hostess, and the look out of their  
     eyes? 
  - The sky up there — yet here, or next door, or  
     across the way? 
  - The saints and sages in history — but you your-
     self? 
  - Sermons, creeds, theology — but the human brain,  
     and what is called reason, and what is called  
     love, and what is called life? 
            - I do not despise you, priests, 
  - My faith is the greatest of faiths, and the least of  
     faiths, 
  - Enclosing all worship ancient and modern, and all  
     between ancient and modern, 
  - Believing I shall come again upon the earth after  
     five thousand years, 
  - Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the  
     gods, saluting the sun, 
  - Making a fetish of the first rock or stump, powow-
     ing with sticks in the circle of obis, 
  - Helping the lama or brahmin as he trims the  
     lamps of the idols, 
  - Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic pro-
     cession — rapt and austere in the woods, a  
     gymnosophist, 
  - Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to shastas and  
     vedas admirant, minding the koran, 
  - Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the  
     stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum, 
  - Accepting the gospels, accepting him that was  
     crucified, knowing assuredly that he is di-
     vine, 
  - To the mass kneeling, to the puritan's prayer ris-
     ing, sitting patiently in a pew, 
  - Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, waiting  
     dead-like till my spirit arouses me, 
  - Looking forth on pavement and land, and outside  
     of pavement and land, 
       - Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
    - One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang, I  
     turn and talk like a man leaving charges be-
     fore a journey. 
       - Down-hearted doubters, dull and excluded, 
  - Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dis-
     heartened, atheistical, 
  - I know évery one of you, I know the unspoken  
     interrogatories, 
  - By experience I know them. 
       - How the flukes splash! 
  - How they contort, rapid as lightning, with spasms  
     and spouts of blood! 
       - Be at peace, bloody flukes of doubters and sullen  
     mopers, 
  - I take my place among you as much as among  
     any, 
  - The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the  
     same, 
  - Day and night are for you, me, all, 
  - And what is yet untried and afterward is for you,  
     me, all, precisely the same. 
       - I do not know what is untried and afterward, 
  - But I know it is sure, alive, sufficient. 
            - Each who passes is considered, each who stops is  
     considered, not a single one can it fail. 
       - It cannot fail the young man who died and was  
     buried, 
  - Nor the young woman who died and was put by  
     his side, 
  - Nor the little child that peeped in at the door,  
     and then drew back and was never seen  
     again, 
  - Nor the old man who has lived without purpose,  
     and feels it with bitterness worse than gall, 
  - Nor him in the poor-house tubercled by rum and  
     the bad disorder, 
  - Nor the numberless slaughtered and wrecked, nor  
     the brutish koboo called the ordure of  
     humanity, 
  - Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths  
     for food to slip in, 
  - Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest  
     graves of the earth, 
  - Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor  
     one of the myriads of myriads that inhabit  
     them, 
  - Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known. 
       - It is time to explain myself — let us stand up.
    - What is known I strip away, I launch all men and  
     women forward with me into the unknown. 
            - The clock indicates the moment, but what does  
     eternity indicate? 
       - Eternity lies in bottomless reservoirs, its buckets  
     are rising forever and ever, 
  - They pour, they pour, and exhale away. 
       - We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters  
     and summers, 
  - There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of  
     them. 
       - Births have brought us richness and variety, 
  - And other births will bring us richness and  
     variety. 
       - I do not call one greater and one smaller, 
  - That which fills its period and place is equal to  
     any. 
       - Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my  
     brother, my sister? 
  - I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or  
     jealous upon me, 
  - All has been gentle with me, I keep no account  
     with lamentation; 
  - What have I to do with lamentation? 
       - I am an acme of things accomplished, and I an  
     encloser of things to be. 
            - My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs, 
  - On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches  
     between the steps, 
  - All below duly traveled, and still I mount and  
     mount. 
       - Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me, 
  - Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I  
     was even there, 
  - I waited unseen and always, and slept through the  
     lethargic mist, 
  - And took my time, and took no hurt from the fœtid  
     carbon. 
       -   Long I was hugged close — long and long. 
    - Immense have been the preparations for me, 
  - Faithful and friendly the arms that have helped me. 
       - Cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like  
     cheerful boatmen, 
  - For room to me stars kept aside in their own  
     rings, 
  - They sent influences to look after what was to  
     hold me. 
       - Before I was born out of my mother generations  
     guided me, 
  - My embryo, has never been torpid, nothing could.  
     overlay it, 
       - For it the nebula cohered to an orb, the long slow  
     strata piled to rest it on, vast vegetables gave  
     it sustenance, 
  - Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths,  
     and deposited it with care. 
       - All forces have been steadily employed to com-
     plete and delight me, 
  - Now I stand on this spot with my soul. 
       - Span of youth! ever-pushed elasticity! manhood,  
     balanced, florid, full! 
       - My lovers suffocate me! 
  - Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin, 
  - Jostling me through streets and public halls,  
     coming naked to me at night, 
  - Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river,  
     swinging and chirping over my head, 
  - Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled  
     under-brush, 
  - Or while I swim in the bath, or drink from the  
     pump at the corner, or the curtain is down at  
     the opera, or I glimpse at a woman's face in  
     the rail-road car, 
  - Lighting on every moment of my life, 
  - Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses, 
  - Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts  
     and giving them to be mine. 
            - Old age superbly rising! Ineffable grace of dying  
     days! 
       - Every condition promulges not only itself, it pro-
     mulges what grows after and out of itself, 
  - And the dark hush promulges as much as  
     any. 
       - I open my scuttle at night and see the far-
     sprinkled systems, 
  - And all I see, multiplied as high as I can cipher,  
     edge but the rim of the farther systems. 
       - Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always  
     expanding, 
  - Outward, outward, forever outward. 
       - My sun has his sun, and round him obediently  
     wheels, 
  - He joins with his partners a group of superior  
     circuit, 
  - And greater sets follow, making specks of the  
     greatest inside them. 
       - There is no stoppage, and never can be stoppage, 
  - If I, you, the worlds, all beneath or upon their  
     surfaces, and all the palpable life, were this  
     moment reduced back to a pallid float, it  
     would not avail in the long run, 
       - We should surely bring up again where we now  
     stand, 
  - And as surely go as much farther, and then far-
     ther and farther. 
       - A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of  
     cubic leagues, do not hazard the span, or  
     make it impatient, 
  - They are but parts, any thing is but a part. 
       - See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of  
     that, 
  - Count ever so much, there is limitless time around  
     that. 
       - My rendezvous is appointed, 
  - The Lord will be there and wait till I come on  
     perfect terms. 
       - I know I have the best of time and space, and  
     was never measured, and never will be  
     measured. 
       - I tramp a perpetual journey, 
  - My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a  
     staff cut from the woods, 
  - No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair, 
  - I have no chair, no church, no philosophy, 
  - I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange, 
       - But each man and each woman of you I lead upon  
     a knoll, 
  - My left hand hooks you round the waist, 
  - My right hand points to landscapes of continents,  
     and a plain public road. 
       - Not I, not any one else, can travel that road for  
     you, 
  - You must travel it for yourself. 
       - It is not far, it is within reach, 
  - Perhaps you have been on it since you were born,  
     and did not know, 
  - Perhaps it is every where on water and on  
     land. 
       - Shoulder your duds, I will mine, let us hasten  
     forth, 
  - Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch  
     as we go. 
       - If you tire, give me both burdens and rest the  
     chuff of your hand on my hip, 
  - And in due time you shall repay the same ser-
     vice to me, 
  - For after we start we never lie by again. 
       - This day before dawn I ascended a hill and  
     looked at the crowded heaven, 
       - And I said to my spirit, When we become the  
     enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and  
     knowledge of every thing in them, shall we  
     be filled and satisfied then? 
  - And my spirit said No, we level that lift to pass  
     and continue beyond. 
       - You are also asking me questions, and I hear you, 
  - I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out  
     for yourself. 
       - Sit a while wayfarer, 
  - Here are biscuits to eat, here is milk to drink, 
  - But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in  
     sweet clothes, I will certainly kiss you with  
     my good-bye kiss, and open the gate for your  
     egress hence. 
       - Long enough have you dreamed contemptible  
     dreams, 
  - Now I wash the gum from your eyes, 
  - You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light,  
     and of every moment of your life. 
       - Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by  
     the shore, 
  - Now I will you to be a bold swimmer, 
  - To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod  
     to me, shout, laughingly dash with your hair. 
        - I am the teacher of athletes, 
  - He that by me spreads a wider breast than my  
     own proves the width of my own, 
  - He most honors my style who learns under it to  
     destroy the teacher. 
       - The boy I love, the same becomes a man, not  
     through derived power, but in his own right, 
  - Wicked, rather than virtuous out of conformity of  
     fear, 
  - Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak, 
  - Unrequited love, or a slight, cutting him worse  
     than a wound cuts, 
  - First rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull's eye,  
     to sail a skiff, to sing a song, or play on the  
     banjo, 
  - Preferring scars, and faces pitted with small-pox,  
     over all latherers and those that keep out of  
     the sun. 
       - I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from  
     me? 
  - I follow you, whoever you are, from the present  
     hour, 
  - My words itch at your ears till you understand  
     them. 
       - I do not say these things for a dollar, or to fill up  
     the time while I wait for a boat, 
       - It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as  
     the tongue of you, 
  - It was tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be  
     loosened. 
       - I swear I will never mention love or death inside  
     a house, 
  - And I swear I never will translate myself at all,  
     only to him or her who privately stays with  
     me in the open air. 
       - If you would understand me, go to the heights or  
     water-shore, 
  - The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or  
     motion of waves a key, 
  - The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words. 
       - No shuttered room or school can commune with  
     me, 
  - But roughs and little children better than they. 
       - The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows  
     me pretty well, 
  - The wood-man that takes his axe and jug with  
     him, shall take me with him all day, 
  - The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at  
     the sound of my voice, 
  - In vessels that sail my words sail — I go with  
     fishermen and seamen, and love them, 
       - My face rubs to the hunter's face when he lies  
     down alone in his blanket, 
  - The driver thinking of me does not mind the  
     jolt of his wagon, 
  - The young mother and old mother comprehend  
     me, 
  - The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment,  
     and forget where they are, 
  - They and all would resume what I have told them. 
       - I have said that the soul is not more than the  
     body, 
  - And I have said that the body is not more than  
     the soul, 
  - And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one's-
     self is, 
  - And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy,  
     walks to his own funeral, dressed in his  
     shroud, 
  - And I or you, pocketless of a dime, may pur-
     chase the pick of the earth, 
  - And to glance with an eye, or show a bean in its  
     pod, confounds the learning of all times, 
  - And there is no trade or employment but the  
     young man following it may become a hero, 
  - And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub  
     for the wheeled universe, 
  - And any man or woman shall stand cool and  
     supercilious before a million universes. 
        - And I call to mankind, Be not curious about God, 
  - For I, who am curious about each, am not curious  
     about God, 
  - No array of terms can say how much I am at  
     peace about God, and about death. 
       - I hear and behold God in every object, yet I  
     understand God not in the least, 
  - Nor do I understand who there can be more won-
     derful than myself. 
       - Why should I wish to see God better than this  
     day? 
  - I see something of God each hour of the twenty-
     four, and each moment then, 
  - In the faces of men and women I see God, and  
     in my own face in the glass, 
  - I find letters from God dropped in the street, and  
     every one is signed by God's name, 
  - And I leave them where they are, for I know  
     that others will punctually come forever and  
     ever. 
       - And as to you death, and you bitter hug of mor-
     tality, it is idle to try to alarm me. 
       - To his work without flinching the accoucheur  
     comes, 
       - I see the elder-hand, pressing, receiving, support-
     ing, 
  - I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible  
     doors, mark the outlet, mark the relief and  
     escape. 
       - And as to you corpse, I think you are good  
     manure, but that does not offend me, 
  - I smell the white roses sweet-scented and grow-
     ing, 
  - I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polished  
     breasts of melons. 
       - And as to you life, I reckon you are the leavings  
     of many deaths, 
  - No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times  
     before. 
       - I hear you whispering there, O stars of heaven, 
  - O suns, O grass of graves, O perpetual trans-
     fers and promotions, if you do not say any-
     thing, how can I say anything? 
       - Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest, 
  - Of the moon that descends the steeps of the  
     soughing twilight, 
  - Toss, sparkles of day and dusk! Toss on the  
     black stems that decay in the muck! 
  - Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs! 
            - I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night, 
  - And perceive of the ghastly glimmer the sun-
     beams reflected, 
  - And debouch to the steady and central from the  
     offspring great or small. 
       - There is that in me — I do not know what it is —  
     but I know it is in me. 
       - Wrenched and sweaty, calm and cool then my  
     body becomes, 
  - I sleep — I sleep long. 
       - I do not know it — it is without name — it is a  
     word unsaid, 
  - It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol. 
       - Something it swings on more than the earth I  
     swing on, 
  - To it the creation is the friend whose embracing  
     awakes me. 
       - Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for  
     my brothers and sisters. 
       - Do you see, O my brothers and sisters? 
  - It is not chaos or death — it is form, union, plan  
      — it is eternal life — it is happiness. 
       - The past and present wilt — I have filled them,  
     emptied them, 
       - And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
 - Listener up there! here you! what have you to  
     confide to me? 
  - Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of  
     evening, 
 - Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay  
     only a minute longer. 
      - Do I contradict myself? 
 - Very well then, I contradict myself, 
 - I am large, I contain multitudes. 
      - I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on  
     the door-slab. 
      - Who has done his day's work? who will soonest  
     be through with his supper? 
 - Who wishes to walk with me? 
      - Will you speak before I am gone? will you  
     prove already too late? 
      - The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me —  
     he complains of my gab and my loitering. 
      - I too am not a bit tamed — I too am untrans-
     latable, 
    - I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the  
     world. 
      - The last send of day holds back for me, 
 - It flings my likeness, after the rest, and true as  
     any, on the shadowed wilds, 
 - It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk. 
      - I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the  
     run-away sun, 
  - I effuse my flash in eddies, and drift it in lacy  
     jags. 
       - I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the  
     grass I love, 
  - If you want me again, look for me under your  
     boot-soles. 
       - You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean, 
  - But I shall be good health to you nevertheless, 
  - And filter and fibre your blood. 
       - Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged, 
  - Missing me one place, search another, 
  - I stop some where waiting for you. 
          
## 2 — Poem of Women. 

     - UNFOLDED only out of the folds of the  
     woman, man comes unfolded, and is always  
     to come unfolded, 
  - Unfolded only out of the superbest woman of the  
     earth is to come the superbest woman of the  
     earth, 
  - Unfolded out of the friendliest woman is to come  
     the friendliest man, 
  - Unfolded only out of the perfect body of a  
     woman, can a man be formed of perfect body, 
  - Unfolded only out of the inimitable poem of  
     the woman can come the poems of man —  
     only thence have my poems come, 
  - Unfolded out of the strong and arrogant woman  
     I love, only thence can appear the strong  
     and arrogant man I love, 
  - Unfolded by brawny embraces from the well-
     muscled woman I love, only thence come the  
     brawny embraces of the man, 
  - Unfolded out of the folds of the woman's brain,  
     come all the folds of the man's brain, duly  
     obedient, 
       - Unfolded out of the justice of the woman, all jus-
     tice is unfolded, 
  - Unfolded out of the sympathy of the woman is all  
      
  - A man is a great thing upon the earth, and  
     through eternity — but every jot of the great-
     ness of man is unfolded out of woman, 
  - First the man is shaped in the woman, he can  
     then be shaped in himself. 
          
## 3 — Poem of Salutation. 

     - O TAKE my hand, Walt Whitman!  
     Such gliding wonders! Such sights and  
     sounds! 
  - Such joined unended links, each hooked to the  
     next! 
  - Each answering all, each sharing the earth  
     with all. 
       - What widens within you, Walt Whitman? 
  - What waves and soils exuding? 
  - What climes? what persons and lands are  
     here? 
  - Who are the infants? some playing, some slum-
     bering? 
  - Who are the girls? Who are the married  
     women? 
  - Who are the three old men going slowly with  
     their arms about each others' necks? 
  - What rivers are these? What forests and fruits  
     are these? 
  - What are the mountains called that rise so high  
     in the mists? 
            - What myriads of dwellings are they, filled with  
     dwellers? 
       - Within me latitude widens, longitude lengthens, 
  - Asia, Africa, Europe, are to the east — America is  
     provided for in the west, 
  - Banding the bulge of the earth winds the hot  
     equator, 
  - Curiously north and south turn the axis-ends; 
  - Within me is the longest day, the sun wheels in  
     slanting rings, it does not set for months, 
  - Stretched in due time within me the midnight sun  
     just rises above the horizon, and sinks again; 
  - Within me zones, seas, cataracts, plains, volca-
     noes, groups, 
  - Oceanica, Australasia, Polynesia, and the great  
     West Indian islands. 
       - What do you hear, Walt Whitman? 
    - I hear the workman singing, and the farmer's wife  
     singing, 
  - I hear in the distance the sounds of children, and  
     of animals early in the day, 
  - I hear the inimitable music of the voices of  
     mothers, 
  - I hear the persuasions of lovers, 
  - I hear quick rifle-cracks from the riflemen of East  
     Tennessee and Kentucky, hunting on hills, 
       - I hear emulous shouts of Australians, pursuing the  
     wild horse, 
  - I hear the Spanish dance with castanets, in  
     the chestnut shade, to the rebeck and  
     guitar, 
  - I hear continual echoes from the Thames, 
  - I hear fierce French liberty songs, 
  - I hear of the Italian boat-sculler the musical reci-
     tative of old poems, 
  - I hear the Virginia plantation chorus of negroes,  
     of a harvest night, in the glare of pine  
     knots, 
  - I hear the strong baritone of the 'long-shore-men  
     of Manahatta — I hear the stevedores unlad-
     ing the cargoes, and singing, 
  - I hear the screams of the water-fowl of solitary  
     northwest lakes, 
  - I hear the rustling pattering of locusts, as they  
     strike the grain and grass with the showers  
     of their terrible clouds, 
  - I hear the Coptic refrain toward sun-down pen-
     sively falling on the breast of the black ven-
     erable vast mother, the Nile, 
  - I hear the bugles of raft-tenders on the streams  
     of Canada, 
  - I hear the chirp of the Mexican muleteer, and  
     the bells of the mule, 
  - I hear the Arab muezzin, calling from the top of  
     the mosque, 
         - I hear Christian priests at the altars of their  
     churches — I hear the responsive base and  
     soprano, 
  - I hear the wail of utter despair of the white-
     haired Irish grand-parents, when they learn  
     the death of their grand-son, 
  - I hear the cry of the Cossack, and the sailor's  
     voice, putting to sea at Okotsk, 
  - I hear the wheeze of the slave-coffle, as the  
     slaves march on, as the husky gangs pass on  
     by twos and threes, fastened together with  
     wrist-chains and ankle-chains, 
  - I hear the entreaties of women tied up for punish-
     ment, I hear the sibilant whisk of thongs  
     through the air, 
  - I hear the appeal of the greatest orator, he that  
     turns states by the tip of his tongue, 
  - I hear the Hebrew reading his records and  
     psalms, 
  - I hear the rhythmic myths of the Greeks, and  
     the strong legends of the Romans, 
  - I hear the tale of the divine life and bloody death  
     of the beautiful god, the Christ, 
  - I hear the Hindoo teaching his favorite pupil the  
     loves, wars, adages, transmitted safely to this  
     day from poets who wrote three thousand  
     years ago. 
       - What do you see, Walt Whitman? 
       - Who are they you salute, and that one after  
     another salute you? 
       - I see a great round wonder rolling through the  
     air, 
  - I see diminute farms, hamlets, ruins, grave-yards,  
     jails, factories, palaces, hovels, huts of barba-
     rians, tents of nomads, upon the surface, 
  - I see the shaded part on one side where the  
     sleepers are sleeping, and the sun-lit part on  
     the other side, 
  - I see the curious silent change of the light and  
     shade, 
  - I see distant lands, as real and near to the  
     inhabitants of them as my land is to me. 
       - I see plenteous waters, 
  - I see mountain peaks — I see the sierras of  
     Andes and Alleghanies, I see where they  
     range,

       - I behold the mariners of the world, 
  - Some are in storms, some in the night, with  
     the watch on the look-out, some drifting  
     helplessly, some with contagious diseases. 
       - I behold the steam-ships of the world, 
  - Some double the Cape of Storms, some Cape

            - I see the tracks of the rail-roads of the earth, 
  - I see them welding state to state, county to  
     county, city to city, through North America, 
  - I see them in Great Britain, I see them in Eu-
     rope, 
  - I see them in Asia and in Africa. 
       - I see the electric telegraphs of the earth, 
  - I see the filaments of the news of the wars,  
     deaths, losses, gains, passions, of my race.

     gods, I see the old signifiers, 
  - I see Christ once more eating the bread of his last  
     supper in the midst of youths and old persons, 
  - I see where the strong divine young man, the Her-
     cules, toiled faithfully and long, and then died, 
  - I see the place of the innocent rich life and hap-
     less fate of the beautiful nocturnal son, the  
     full-limbed Bacchus, 
  - I see Kneph, blooming, dressed in blue, with the  
     crown of feathers on his head, 
  - I see Hermes, unsuspected, dying, well-beloved,  
     saying to the people, Do not weep for me,  
     this is not my true country, I have lived  
     banished from my true country, I now go  
     back there, I return to the celestial sphere  
     where every one goes in his turn. 
       - I see the battle-fields of the earth — grass grows  
     upon them, and blossoms and corn, 
  - I see the tracks of ancient and modern expedi-
     tions. 
            - I see the nameless masonries, venerable messages

     when they wearied of their quiet graves,  
     might rise up through the mounds, and gaze  
     on the tossing billows, and be refreshed by  
     storms, immensity, liberty, action.

       - I see the little and large sea-dots, some inhabited,  
     some uninhabited; 
  - I see two boats with nets, lying off the shore of  
     Paumanok, quite still, 
  - I see ten fishermen waiting — they discover now  
     a thick school of mossbonkers, they drop  
     the joined seine-ends in the water, 
  - The boats separate, they diverge and row off,  
     each on its rounding course to the beach,  
     enclosing the mossbonkers, 
  - The net is drawn in by a windlass by those  
     who stop ashore, 
  - Some of the fishermen lounge in the boats,  
     others stand negligently ankle-deep in the  
     water, poised on strong legs, 
  - The boats are partly drawn up, the water slaps  
     against them, 
       - On the sand, in heaps and winrows, well out from  
     the water, lie the green-backed spotted moss-
     bonkers. 
       - I see the despondent red man in the west,  
     lingering about the banks of Moingo, and  
     about Lake Pepin,

     sadly prepared to depart.

     of the South Pacific and the North Atlantic, 
  - I see the cliffs, glaciers, torrents, valleys, of Switz-
     erland — I mark the long winters and the  
     isolation. 
       - I see the cities of the earth, and make myself a  
     part of them, 
  - I am a real Londoner, Parisian, Viennese, 
  - I am a habitan of St. Petersburgh, Berlin, Con-
     stantinople, 
  - I am of Adelaide, Sidney, Melbourne,

       - I am of Madrid, Cadiz, Barcelona, Oporto, Lyons,  
     Brussels, Berne, Frankfort, Stuttgart, Turin,  
     Florence, 
  - I belong in Moscow, Cracow, Warsaw — or north-
     ward in Christiana or Stockholm — or in  
     some street in Iceland, 
  - I descend upon all those cities, and rise from them  
     again. 
       - I see vapors exhaling from unexplored coun-
     tries, 
  - I see the savage types, the bow and arrow, the  
     poisoned splint, the fetish and the obi. 
       - I see African and Asiatic towns, 
  - I see Algiers, Tripoli, Derne, Mogadore, Timbuc-
     too, Monrovia, 
  - I see the swarms of Pekin, Canton, Benares,  
     Delhi, Calcutta, 
  - I see the Kruman in his hut, and the Dahoman  
     and Ashantee-man in their huts, 
  - I see the Turk smoking opium in Aleppo, 
  - I see the picturesque crowds at the fairs of Khiva,  
     and those of Herat, 
  - I see Teheran, I see Muscat and Medina, and the  
     intervening sands — I see the caravans toil-
     ing onward; 
  - I see Egypt and the Egyptians, I see the pyramids  
     and obelisks, 
       - I look on chiselled histories, songs, philosophies,  
     cut in slabs of sand-stone or granite blocks, 
  - I see at Memphis mummy-pits, containing mum-
     mies, embalmed, swathed in linen cloth, lying  
     there many centuries, 
  - I look on the fall'n Theban, the large-ball'd eyes,  
     the side-drooping neck, the hands folded  
     across the breast. 
       - I see the menials of the earth, laboring, 
  - I see the prisoners in the prisons, 
  - I see the defective human bodies of the earth, 
  - I see the blind, the deaf and dumb, idiots, hunch-
     backs, lunatics, 
  - I see the pirates, thieves, betrayers, murderers,  
     slave-makers of the earth, 
  - I see the helpless infants, and the helpless old  
     men and women. 
       - I see male and female everywhere, 
  - I see the serene brotherhood of philosophs, 
  - I see the constructiveness of my race, 
  - I see the results of the perseverance and industry  
     of my race, 
  - I see ranks, colors, barbarisms, civilizations — I  
     go among them, I mix indiscriminately, 
  - And I salute all the inhabitants of the earth. 
       - You, inevitable where you are! 
  - You daughter or son of England! 
            - You free man of Australia! you of Tasmania! you

     saddle, shooting arrows to the mark!

     Tartar of Tartary! 
  - You women of the earth, subordinated at your  
     tasks! 
  - You Jew journeying in your old age through every  
     risk to stand once on Syrian ground! 
  - You other Jews waiting in all lands for your  
     Messiah! 
  - You thoughtful Armenian pondering by some  
     stream of the Euphrates! you peering amid  
     the ruins of Nineveh! you ascending Mount  
     Ararat! 
  - You foot-worn pilgrim welcoming the far-away  
     sparklè of the minarets of Mecca! 
  - You sheiks along the stretch from Suez to Babel-
     mandel, ruling your families and tribes! 
  - You olive-grower tending your fruit on fields off  
     Nazareth, Damascus, or Lake Tiberias! 
  - You Thibet trader on the wide inland, or bargain-
     ing in the shops of Lassa! 
  - You Japanese man or woman! you liver in  
     Madagascar, Ceylon, Sumatra, Borneo! 
  - All you continentals of Asia, Africa, Europe,  
     Australia, indifferent of place! 
  - All you on the numberless islands of the archi-
     pelagoes of the sea! 
  - And you of centuries hence, when you listen to me! 
  - And you everywhere whom I specify not, but in-
     clude just the same! 
       - I salute you for myself and for America.
    - Each of us inevitable, 
  - Each of us limitless — each of us with his or her  
     right upon the earth, 
  - Each of us allowed the eternal purport of the earth, 
  - Each of us here as divinely as any is here. 
       - You Hottentot with clicking palate! 
  - You woolly-haired hordes! you white or black  
     owners of slaves!

       - My spirit has passed in compassion and deter-
     mination around the whole earth, 
  - I have looked for brothers, sisters, lovers, and  
     found them ready for me in all lands. 
       - I think I have risen with you, you vapors, and  
     moved away to distant continents, and fallen  
     down there, for reasons, 
  - I think I have blown with you, you winds, 
  - I think, you waters, I have fingered every shore  
     with you, 
  - I think I have run through what any river or strait  
     of the globe has run through, 
  - I think I have taken my stand on the bases of  
     peninsulas, and on imbedded rocks. 
       - What cities the light or warmth penetrates, I  
     penetrate those cities myself, 
  - All islands to which birds wing their way, I  
     wing my way myself, 
  - I find my home wherever there are any homes of  
     men. 
           
## 4 — Poem of The Daily Work of The Workmen and Workwomen of These  States. 

     - COME closer to me,  
     Push close, my lovers, and take the best I  
     possess, 
  - Yield closer and closer, and give me the best you  
     possess. 
       - This is unfinished business with me — How is it  
     with you? 
  - I was chilled with the cold types, cylinder, wet  
     paper between us. 
       - I pass so poorly with paper and types, I must pass  
     with the contact of bodies and souls. 
       - I do not thank you for liking me as I am, and  
     liking the touch of me — I know that it is  
     good for you to do so. 
       - Were all educations practical and ornamental well  
     displayed out of me, what would it amount to? 
              - Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor,  
     wise statesman, what would it amount to? 
  - Were I to you as the boss employing and paying  
     you, would that satisfy you? 
       - The learned, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual  
     terms, 
  - A man like me, and never the usual terms. 
       - Neither a servant nor a master am I, 
  - I take no sooner a large price than a small price  
      — I will have my own, whoever enjoys me, 
  - I will be even with you, and you shall be even  
     with me. 
       - If you are a workman or workwoman, I stand as  
     nigh as the nighest that works in the same  
     shop, 
  - If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest  
     friend, I demand as good as your brother or  
     dearest friend, 
  - If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day  
     or night, I must be personally as welcome, 
  - If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I  
     become so for your sake, 
  - If you remember your foolish and outlawed deeds,  
     do you think I cannot remember my own  
     foolish and outlawed deeds? plenty of them? 
  - If you carouse at the table, I carouse at the  
     opposite side of the table, 
       - If you meet some stranger in the street, and love  
     him or her, do I not often meet strangers in  
     the street and love them? 
  - If you see a good deal remarkable in me, I see  
     just as much, perhaps more, in you. 
       - Why what have you thought of yourself? 
  - Is it you, then, that thought yourself less? 
  - Is it you that thought the President greater than  
     you? or the rich better off than you? or the  
     educated wiser than you? 
       - Because you are greasy or pimpled, or that you  
     was once drunk, or a thief, or diseased, or  
     rheumatic, or a prostitute, or are so now, or  
     from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no  
     scholar, and never saw your name in print,  
     do you give in that you are any less  
     immortal? 
       - Souls of men and women! it is not you I call  
     unseen, unheard, untouchable and untouch-
     ing, 
  - It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to  
     settle whether you are alive or no, 
  - I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns  
      — I see and hear you, and what you give and  
     take, 
  - What is there you cannot give and take? 
       - I see not merely that you are polite or white-faced,  
     married, single, citizens of old states, citizens  
     of new states, eminent in some profession, a  
     lady or gentleman in a parlor, or dressed in  
     the jail uniform, or pulpit uniform, 
  - Not only the free Utahan, Kansian, Arkansian —  
     not only the free Cuban, not merely the slave,  
     not Mexican native, Flatfoot, negro from  
     Africa, 
  - Iroquois eating the war-flesh, fish-tearer in his lair  
     of rocks and sand, Esquimaux in the dark  
     cold snow-house, Chinese with his transverse  
     eyes, Bedowee, wandering nomad, taboun-
     schik at the head of his droves, 
  - Grown, half-grown, and babe, of this country and  
     every country, indoors and outdoors, I see —  
     and all else is behind or through them. 
       - The wife, and she is not one jot less than the  
     husband! 
  - The daughter, and she is just as good as the  
     son! 
  - The mother, and she is every bit as much as the  
     father! 
       - Offspring of those not rich, boys apprenticed to  
     trades, 
  - Young fellows working on farms, and old fellows  
     working on farms, 
       - The naive, the simple and hardy, he going to the  
     polls to vote, he who has a good time, and he  
     who has a bad time, 
  - Mechanics, southerners, new arrivals, laborers  
     sailors, mano'warsmen, merchantmen, coast-
     ers, 
  - All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I  
     see, 
  - None shall escape me, and none shall wish to  
     escape me. 
       - I bring what you much need, yet always have, 
  - Not money, amours, dress, eating, but as good, 
  - I send no agent or medium, offer no representative  
     of value, but offer the value itself. 
       - There is something that comes home to one now  
     and perpetually, 
  - It is not what is printed, preached, discussed — it  
     eludes discussion and print, 
  - It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this  
     book, 
  - It is for you, whoever you are — it is no farther  
     from you than your hearing and sight are  
     from you, 
  - It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest — it  
     is not them, though it is endlessly provoked  
     by them — what is there ready and near you  
     now? 
            - You may read in many languages, yet read nothing  
     about it, 
  - You may read the President's message, and read  
     nothing about it there, 
  - Nothing in the reports from the State department  
     or Treasury department, or in the daily  
     papers or the weekly papers, 
  - Or in the census returns, assessors' returns, prices  
     current, or any accounts of stock. 
       - The sun and stars that float in the open air — the  
     apple-shaped earth, and we upon it, surely  
     the drift of them is something grand! 
  - I do not know what it is, except that it is grand,  
     and that it is happiness, 
  - And that the enclosing purport of us here  
     is not a speculation, or bon-mot, or recon-
     noissance, 
  - And that it is not something which by luck may  
     turn out well for us, and without luck must be  
     a failure for us, 
  - And not something which may yet be retracted in  
     a certain contingency. 
       - The light and shade, the curious sense of body  
     and identity, the greed that with perfect  
     complaisance devours all things, the endless  
     pride and out-stretching of man, unspeakable  
     joys and sorrows, 
       - The wonder every one sees in every one else he  
     sees, and the wonders that fill each minute  
     of time forever, and each acre of surface and  
     space forever, 
  - Have you reckoned them for a trade or farm-work?  
     or for the profits of a store? or to achieve  
     yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman's  
     leisure, or a lady's leisure? 
       - Have you reckoned the landscape took substance  
     and form that it might be painted in a  
     picture? 
  - Or men and women that they might be written of,  
     and songs sung? 
  - Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws  
     and harmonious combinations, and the fluids  
     of the air, as subjects for the savans? 
  - Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and  
     charts? 
  - Or the stars to be put in constellations and  
     named fancy names? 
  - Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural ta-
     bles, or agriculture itself? 
       - Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends,  
     collections, and the practice handed along  
     in manufactures, will we rate them so high? 
  - Will we rate our cash and business high? I have  
     no objection, 
       - I rate them high as the highest, then a child born  
     of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate. 
       - We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution  
     grand, 
  - I do not say they are not grand and good, for they  
     are, 
  - I am this day just as much in love with them as  
     you, 
  - Then I am eternally in love with you, and with  
     all my fellows upon the earth. 
       - We consider bibles and religions divine — I do not  
     say they are not divine, 
  - I say they have all grown out of you, and may  
     grow out of you still, 
  - It is not they who give the life, it is you who give  
     the life, 
  - Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees  
     from the earth, than they are shed out of  
     you. 
       - The sum of all known reverence I add up in you,  
     whoever you are, 
  - The President is there in the White House for  
     you, it is not you who are here for him, 
  - The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not  
     you here for them, 
  - The Congress convenes every December for you, 
       - Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters  
     of cities, the going and coming of commerce  
     and mails, are all for you. 
       - All doctrines, all politics and civilization, exurge  
     from you, 
  - All sculpture and monuments, and anything in-
     scribed anywhere, are tallied in you, 
  - The gist of histories and statistics as far back as  
     the records reach, is in you this hour, and  
     myths and tales the same, 
  - If you were not breathing and walking here,  
     where would they all be? 
  - The most renowned poems would be ashes, ora-
     tions and plays would be vacuums. 
       - All architecture is what you do to it when you  
     look upon it, 
  - Did you think it was in the white or gray stone?  
     or the lines of the arches and cornices? 
       - All music is what awakes from you, when you  
     are reminded by the instruments, 
  - It is not the violins and the cornets — it is not the  
     oboe nor the beating drums, nor the score of  
     the baritone singer singing his sweet ro-
     manza, nor that of the men's chorus, nor that  
     of the women's chorus, 
  - It is nearer and farther than they. 
              - Will the whole come back then? 
  - Can each see signs of the best by a look in the  
     looking-glass? is there nothing greater or  
     more? 
  - Does all sit there with you, and here with me? 
       - The old, forever-new things — you foolish child!  
     the closest, simplest things, this moment with  
     you, 
  - Your person, and every particle that relates to  
     your person, 
  - The pulses of your brain, waiting their chance  
     and encouragement at every deed or sight, 
  - Anything you do in public by day, and anything  
     you do in secret between-days, 
  - What is called right and what is called wrong,  
     what you behold or touch, what causes your  
     anger or wonder, 
  - The ankle-chain of the slave, the bed of the bed-
     house, the cards of the gambler, the plates  
     of the forger, 
  - What is seen or learnt in the street, or intui-
     tively learnt, 
  - What is learnt in the public school, spelling,  
     reading, writing, ciphering, the black-board,  
     the teacher's diagrams, 
  - The panes of the windows, all that appears  
     through them, the going forth in the morning,  
     the aimless spending of the day, 
       - (What is it that you made money? what is it that  
     you got what you wanted?) 
  - The usual routine, the work-shop, factory, yard,  
     office, store, desk, 
  - The jaunt of hunting or fishing, the life of hunt-
     ing or fishing, 
  - Pasture-life, foddering, milking, herding, all the  
     personnel and usages, 
  - The plum-orchard, apple-orchard, gardening,  
     seedlings, cuttings, flowers, vines, 
  - Grains, manures, marl, clay, loam, the subsoil  
     plough, the shovel, pick, rake, hoe, irrigation,  
     draining, 
  - The curry-comb, the horse-cloth, the halter, bridle,  
     bits, the very wisps of straw, 
  - The barn and barn-yard, the bins, mangers, mows,  
     racks, 
  - Manufactures, commerce, engineering, the build-
     ing of cities, every trade carried on there,  
     the implements of every trade,

     work,

     air-pump, boiler, beam, pulley, hinge, flange,  
     band, bolt, throttle, governors, up and down  
     rods, 
       - The ship's compass, the sailor's tarpaulin, the  
     stays and lanyards, the ground tackle for  
     anchoring or mooring, the life-boat for  
     wrecks, 
  - The sloop's tiller, the pilot's wheel and bell, the  
     yacht or fish-smack, the great gay-pennanted  
     three-hundred-foot steamboat under full head-
     way, with her proud fat breasts and her deli-
     cate swift-flashing paddles, 
  - The trail, line, hooks, sinkers, the seine, hauling  
     the seine,

     police — the dishes of breakfast, dinner, sup-
     per, 
  - The bunk-room, the fire-engine, the string-term,  
     the car or truck behind, 
  - The paper I write on or you write on, every word  
     we write, every cross and twirl of the pen,  
     and the curious way we write what we think,  
     yet very faintly, 
       - The directory, the detector, the ledger, the books  
     in ranks on the book-shelves, the clock at-
     tached to the wall,

     coal-kiln and brick-kiln, 
  - Coal-mines, all that is down there, the lamps in  
     the darkness, echoes, songs, what medita-
     tions, what vast native thoughts looking  
     through smutch'd faces, 
  - Iron-works, forge-fires in the mountains or by  
     river-banks, men around feeling the melt  
     with huge crowbars — lumps of ore, the due  
     combining of ore, limestone, coal — the blast-
     furnace and the puddling-furnace, the loup-
       - 
     lump at the bottom of the melt at last —  
     the rolling-mill, the stumpy bars of pig-iron,  
     the strong clean-shaped T rail for rail-
     roads, 
  - Oil-works, silk-works, white-lead-works, the

     formed out of the sheets, and all the work in  
     forming it, 
  - Stone-cutting, shapely trimmings for facades,  
     or window or door lintels — the mallet,  
     the tooth-chisel, the jib to protect the  
     thumb, 
  - Oakum, the oakum-chisel, the caulking-iron — the  
     kettle of boiling vault-cement, and the fire  
     under the kettle,

     buck of the sawyer, the screen of the coal-
     screener, the mould of the moulder, the

     and all the work with ice, 
  - The four-double cylinder press, the hand-press,

     maker,

     and flat-iron,

     chines, ploughing-machines, thrashing-ma-
     chines, steam-wagons, 
       - The cart of the carman, the omnibus, the ponder-
     ous dray, 
  - The wires of the electric telegraph stretched on  
     land, or laid at the bottom of the sea, and  
     then the message in an instant from ten  
     thousand miles off, 
  - The snow-plough and two engines pushing it, the  
     ride in the express-train of only one car, the  
     swift go through a howling storm — the locomo-
     tive, and all that is done about a locomotive, 
  - The bear-hunt or coon-hunt, the bonfire of shav-
     ings in the open lot in the city, the crowd of  
     children watching, 
  - The blows of the fighting-man, the upper-cut and  
     one-two-three, 
  - Pyrotechny, letting off colored fire-works at  
     night, fancy figures and jets, 
  - Shop-windows, coffins in the sexton's ware-room,  
     fruit on the fruit-stand — beef in the butcher's  
     stall, the slaughter-house of the butcher,  
     the butcher in his killing-clothes, 
  - The area of pens of live pork, the killing-hammer,  
     the hog-hook, the scalder's tub, gutting, the  
     cutter's cleaver, the packer's maul, and the  
     plenteous winter-work of pork-packing, 
  - Flour-works, grinding of wheat, rye, maize, rice  
      — the barrels and the half and quarter barrels,  
     the loaded barges, the high piles on wharves  
     and levees, 
       - Bread and cakes in the bakery, the milliner's rib-
     bons, the dress-maker's patterns, the tea-table,  
     the home-made sweetmeats; 
  - Coins and medals, the ancient bronze coin, bust,  
     inscription, date, ring-money, the copper  
     cent, the silver dime, the five-dime piece, the  
     gold dollar, the fifty-dollar piece — Modern  
     coins, and all the study and reminiscence of  
     old coins, 
  - Cheap literature, maps, charts, lithographs, daily  
     and weekly newspapers, 
  - The column of wants in the one-cent paper,  
     the news by telegraph, amusements, operas,  
     shows, 
  - The business parts of a city, the trottoirs of a  
     city when thousands of well-dressed people  
     walk up and down, 
  - The cotton, woolen, linen you wear, the money  
     you make and spend, 
  - Your room and bed-room, your piano-forte, the  
     stove and cook-pans, 
  - The house you live in, the rent, the other tenants,  
     the deposite in the savings-bank, the trade at  
     the grocery, 
  - The pay on Saturday night, the going home, and  
     the purchases; 
  - In them the heft of the heaviest — in them far  
     more than you estimated, and far less also, 
       - In them, not yourself — you and your soul enclose  
     all things, regardless of estimation, 
  - In them your themes, hints, provokers — if not,  
     the whole earth has no themes, hints, pro-
     vokers, and never had. 
       - I do not affirm what you see beyond is futile — I  
     do not advise you to stop, 
  - I do not say leadings you thought great are not  
     great, 
  - But I say that none lead to greater, sadder, hap-
     pier, than those lead to. 
       - Will you seek afar off? you surely come back at  
     last, 
  - In things best known to you, finding the best, or  
     as good as the best, 
  - In folks nearest to you finding also the sweetest,  
     strongest, lovingest, 
  - Happiness not in another place, but this place —  
     not for another hour, but this hour, 
  - Man in the first you see or touch, always in your  
     friend, brother, nighest neighbor — Woman in  
     your mother, lover, wife, 
  - The popular tastes and occupations taking prece-
     dence in poems or anywhere, 
  - You workwomen and workmen of These States  
     having your own divine and strong life —  
     looking the President always sternly in the     
     face, unbending, nonchalant, understanding  
     that he is to be kept by you to short and  
     sharp account of himself, 
  - And all else thus far giving place to men and  
     women. 
       - When the psalm sings instead of the singer, 
  - When the script preaches instead of the preacher, 
  - When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the  
     carver that carved the supporting-desk, 
  - When I can touch the body of books, by night or  
     by day, and when they touch my body back  
     again, 
  - When the sacred vessels, or the bits of the eucha-
     rist, or the lath and plast, procreate as effec-
     tually as the young silver-smiths or bakers, or  
     the masons in their over-alls, 
  - When a university course convinces like a slum-
     bering woman and child convince, 
  - When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the  
     night-watchman's daughter, 
  - When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite,  
     and are my friendly companions, 
  - I intend to reach them my hand, and make as  
     much of them as I do of men and women. 
           
## 5 — Broad-Axe Poem. 

     - BROAD-AXE, shapely, naked, wan!  
     Head from the mother's bowels drawn! 
  - Wooded flesh and metal bone! limb only one and  
     lip only one! 
  - Gray-blue leaf by red-heat grown! helve produced  
     from a little seed sown! 
  - Resting, the grass amid and upon, 
  - To be leaned, and to lean on. 
       - Strong shapes, and attributes of strong shapes,  
     masculine trades, sights and sounds, 
  - Long varied train of an emblem, dabs of music, 
  - Fingers of the organist skipping staccato over the  
     keys of the great organ. 
       - Welcome are all earth's lands, each for its kind, 
  - Welcome are lands of pine and oak, 
  - Welcome are lands of the lemon and fig, 
  - Welcome are lands of gold, 
  - Welcome are lands of wheat and maize — welcome  
     those of the grape, 
  - Welcome are lands of sugar and rice, 
       - Welcome the cotton-lands — welcome those of the  
     white potato and sweet potato, 
  - Welcome are mountains, flats, sands, forests, prai-
     ries, 
  - Welcome the rich borders of rivers, table-lands,  
     openings, 
  - Welcome the measureless grazing lands — wel-
     come the teeming soil of orchards, flax,  
     honey, hemp, 
  - Welcome just as much the other more hard-faced  
     lands, 
  - Lands rich as lands of gold, or wheat and fruit  
     lands, 
  - Lands of mines, lands of the manly and rugged ores, 
  - Lands of coal, copper, lead, tin, zinc, 
  - Lands of iron! lands of the make of the axe! 
       - The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it, 
  - The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the  
     space cleared for a garden, 
  - The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves,  
     after the storm is lulled, 
  - The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought  
     of the sea, 
  - The thought of ships struck in the storm, and put  
     on their beam-ends, and the cutting away of  
      
  - The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashioned  
     houses and barns; 
       - The remembered print or narrative, the voyage at  
     a venture of men, families, goods, 
  - The disembarcation, the founding of a new city, 
  - The voyage of those who sought a New England  
     and found it, 
  - The Year 1 of These States, the weapons that year  
     began with, scythe, pitch-fork, club, horse-
     pistol, 
  - The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa,  
     Willamette, 
  - The slow progress, the scant fare, the axe, rifle,  
      
  - The beauty of all adventurous and daring per-
     sons, 
  - The beauty of wood-boys and wood-men, with  
     their clear untrimmed faces, 
  - The beauty of independence, departure, actions  
     that rely on themselves, 
  - The American contempt for statutes and cere-
     monies, the boundless impatience of restraint, 
  - The loose drift of character, the inkling through  
     random types, the solidification; 
  - The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands  
     aboard schooners and sloops, the rafts-man,  
     the pioneer, 
  - Lumber-men in their winter camp, day-break in the  
     woods, stripes of snow on the limbs of trees,  
     the occasional snapping, 
       - The glad clear sound of one's own voice, the  
     merry song, the natural life of the woods, the  
     strong day's work, 
  - The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper,  
     the talk, the bed of hemlock boughs, and the  
      
  - The house-builder at work in cities or anywhere, 
  - The preparatory jointing, squaring, sawing, mor-
     tising, 
  - The hoist-up of beams, the push of them in their  
     places, laying them regular, 
  - Setting the studs by their tenons in the mortises,  
     according as they were prepared, 
  - The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes  
     of the men, their curved limbs, 
  - Bending, standing, astride the beams, driving in  
     pins, holding on by posts and braces, 
  - The hooked arm over the plate, the other arm  
     wielding the axe, 
  - The floor-men forcing the planks close, to be  
     nailed, 
  - Their postures bringing their weapons downward  
     on the bearers, 
  - The echoes resounding through the vacant building; 
  - The huge store-house carried up in the city, well  
     under way, 
  - The six framing-men, two in the middle and two  
     at each end, carefully bearing on their  
     shoulders a heavy stick for a cross-beam, 
       - The crowded line of masons with trowels in their  
     right hands rapidly laying the long side-wall,  
     two hundred feet from front to rear, 
  - The flexible rise and fall of backs, the continual  
     click of the trowels and bricks, 
  - The bricks, one after another, each laid so work-
     man-like in its place, and set with a knock of  
     the trowel-handle, 
  - The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-
     boards, and the steady replenishing by the  
      
  - Spar-makers in the spar-yard, the swarming row  
     of well-grown apprentices, 
  - The swing of their axes on the square-hewed  
     log, shaping it toward the shape of a  
     mast, 
  - The brisk short crackle of the steel driven slant-
     ingly into the pine, 
  - The butter-colored chips flying off in great flakes  
     and slivers, 
  - The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips  
     in easy costumes; 
  - The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-
     heads, floats, stays against the sea; 
  - The city fire-man — the fire that suddenly bursts  
     forth in the close-packed square, 
  - The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the  
     nimble stepping and daring, 
       - The strong command through the fire-trumpets,  
     the forming in line, the echoed rise and fall  
     of the arms forcing the water, 
  - The slender, spasmic blue-white jets — the bring-
     ing to bear of the hooks and ladders, and  
     their execution, 
  - The crash and cut away of connecting wood-work,  
     or through floors, if the fire smoulders under  
     them, 
  - The crowd with their lit faces, watching — tho  
     glare and dense shadows; 
  - The forger at his forge-furnace, and the user of  
     iron after him, 
  - The maker of the axe large and small, and the  
     welder and temperer, 
  - The chooser breathing his breath on the cold  
     steel and trying the edge with his thumb, 
  - The one who clean-shapes the handle and sets it  
     firmly in the socket, 
  - The shadowy processions of the portraits of the  
     past users also, 
  - The primal patient mechanics, the architects and  
     engineers, 
  - The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice, 
  - The Roman lictors preceding the consuls, 
  - The antique European warrior with his axe in  
     combat, 
  - The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the  
     helmeted head, 
         - The death-howl, the limpsey tumbling, the  
     rush of friend and foe thither, 
  - The siege of revolted lieges determined for lib-
     erty, 
  - The summons to surrender, the battering at castle  
     gates, the truce and parley, 
  - The sack of an old city in its time, 
  - The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumult-
     uously and disorderly, 
  - Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness, 
  - Goods freely rifled from houses and temples,  
     screams of women in the gripe of brigands, 
  - Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running,  
     old persons despairing, 
  - The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds, 
  - The list of all executive deeds and words, just or  
     unjust, 
  - The power of personality, just or unjust. 
       - Muscle and pluck forever! 
  - What invigorates life, invigorates death, 
  - And the dead advance as much as the living  
     advance, 
  - And the future is no more uncertain than the  
     present, 
  - And the roughness of the earth and of man en-
     closes as much as the delicatesse of the earth  
     and of man, 
  - And nothing endures but personal qualities. 
            - What do you think endures? 
  - Do you think the greatest city endures? 
  - Or a teeming manufacturing state? or a prepared  
     constitution? or the best built steam-ships? 
  - Or hotels of granite and iron? or any chef-
     d'oeuvres of engineering, forts, armaments? 
       - Away! These are not to be cherished for them-
     selves, 
  - They fill their hour, the dancers dance, the musi-
     cians play for them, 
  - The show passes, all does well enough of course, 
  - All does very well till one flash of defiance. 
       - The greatest city is that which has the greatest  
     man or woman, 
  - If it be a few ragged huts, it is still the greatest  
     city in the whole world. 
       - The place where the greatest city stands is not  
     the place of stretched wharves, docks, manu-
     factures, deposites of produce, 
  - Nor the place of ceaseless salutes of new-comers,  
     or the anchor-lifters of the departing, 
  - Nor the place of the tallest and costliest build-
     ings, or shops selling goods from the rest of  
     the earth, 
  - Nor the place of the best libraries and schools,  
     nor the place where money is plentiest, 
       - Nor the place of the most numerous population.
    - Where the city stands with the brawniest breed  
     of orators and bards, 
  - Where the city stands that is beloved by these,  
     and loves them in return, and understands  
     them, 
  - Where these may be seen going every day in the  
     streets, with their arms familiar to the shoul-
     ders of their friends, 
  - Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the  
     common words and deeds, 
  - Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its  
     place, 
  - Where behavior is the finest of the fine arts, 
  - Where the men and women think lightly of the  
     laws, 
  - Where the slave ceases and the master of slaves  
     ceases, 
  - Where the populace rise at once against the auda-
     city of elected persons, 
  - Where fierce men and women pour forth as the  
     sea to the whistle of death pours its sweeping  
     and unript waves, 
  - Where outside authority enters always after the  
     precedence of inside authority, 
  - Where the citizen is always the head and ideal,  
     and President, Mayor, Governor, and what  
     not, are agents for pay, 
       - Where children are taught from the jump that  
     they are to be laws to themselves, and to  
     depend on themselves, 
  - Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs, 
  - Where speculations on the soul are encouraged, 
  - Where women walk in public processions in the  
     streets the same as the men, 
  - Where they enter the public assembly and take  
     places the same as the men, and are appealed  
     to by the orators the same as the men, 
  - Where the city of the faithfulest friends stands, 
  - Where the city of the cleanliness of the sexes  
     stands, 
  - Where the city of the healthiest fathers stands, 
  - Where the city of the best-bodied mothers stands, 
  - There the greatest city stands. 
       - How beggarly appear poems, arguments, orations,  
     before an electric deed! 
  - How the floridness of the materials of cities  
     shrivels before a man's or woman's look! 
       - All waits, or goes by default, till a strong being  
      
  - A strong being is the proof of the race, and of the  
     ability of the universe, 
  - When he or she appears, materials are over-
     awed, 
  - The dispute on the soul stops, 
       - The old customs and phrases are confronted,  
     turned back, or laid away. 
       - What is your money-making now? What can it  
     do now? 
  - What is your respectability now? 
  - What are your theology, tuition, society, traditions,  
     statute-books now? 
  - Where are your jibes of being now? 
  - Where are your cavils about the soul now? 
       - Was that your best? Were those your vast and  
     solid? 
  - Riches, opinions, politics, institutions, to part obe-
     diently from the path of one man or woman! 
  - The centuries, and all authority, to be trod under  
     the foot-soles of one man or woman! 
       -  — A sterile landscape covers the ore — there is as good as the best, for all the forbidding  
     appearance, 
  - There is the mine, there are the miners, 
  - The forge-furnace is there, the melt is accom-
     plished, the hammers-men are at hand with  
     their tongs and hammers, 
  - What always served and always serves, is at hand. 
    - Than this nothing has better served — it has served  
     all, 
       - Served the fluent-tongued and subtle-sensed  
     Greek, and long ere the Greek, 
  - Served in building the buildings that last longer  
     than any, 
  - Served the Hebrew, the Persian, the most ancient  
     Hindostanee, 
  - Served the mound-raiser on the Mississippi,  
     served those whose relics remain in Central  
     America, 
  - Served Albic temples in woods or on plains, with  
     unhewn pillars, and the druids, and the  
     bloody body laid in the hollow of the great  
     stone, 
  - Served the artificial clefts, vast, high, silent, on  
     the snow-covered hills of Scandinavia, 
  - Served those who, time out of mind, made on the  
     granite walls rough sketches of the sun,  
     moon, stars, ships, ocean-waves, 
  - Served the paths of the irruptions of the Goths,  
     served the pastoral tribes and nomads, 
  - Served the incalculably distant Celt, served the  
     hardy pirates of the Baltic, 
  - Served before any of those, the venerable and  
     harmless men of Ethiopia, 
  - Served the making of helms for the galleys  
     of pleasure, and the making of those for  
     war, 
  - Served all great works on land, and all great  
     works on the sea, 
       - For the medieval ages, and before the medieval  
     ages, 
  - Served not the living only, then as now, but  
     served the dead. 
       - I see the European headsman, 
  - He stands masked, clothed in red, with huge legs,  
     and strong naked arms, 
  - And leans on a ponderous axe. 
       - Whom have you slaughtered lately, European  
     headsman? 
  - Whose is that blood upon you, so wet and  
     sticky? 
       - I see the clear sun-sets of the martyrs, 
  - I see from the scaffolds the descending  
     ghosts, 
  - Ghosts of dead princes, uncrowned ladies, im-
     peached ministers, rejected kings, 
  - Rivals, traitors, poisoners, disgraced chieftains,  
     and the rest. 
       - I see those who in any land have died for the  
     good cause, 
  - The seed is spare, nevertheless the crop shall  
     never run out, 
  - Mind you, O foreign kings, O priests, the crop  
     shall never run out. 
            - I see the blood washed entirely away from the  
     axe, 
  - Both blade and helve are clean, 
  - They spirt no more the blood of European nobles,  
      — they clasp no more the necks of queens. 
       - I see the headsman withdraw and become use-
     less, 
  - I see the scaffold untrodden and mouldy, I see no  
     longer any axe upon it, 
  - I see the mighty and friendly emblem of the power  
     of my own race, the newest largest race. 
       - America! I do not vaunt my love for you, 
  - I have what I have. 
       - The axe leaps! 
  - The solid forest gives fluid utterances, 
  - They tumble forth, they rise and form, 
  - Hut, tent, landing, survey, 
  - Flail, plough, pick, crowbar, spade, 
  - Shingle, rail, prop, wainscot, jamb, lath, panel,  
     gable, 
  - Citadel, ceiling, saloon, academy, organ, exhibi-
     tion-house, library, 
  - Cornice, trellis, pilaster, balcony, window, shutter,  
     turret, porch, 
  - Hoe, rake, pitch-fork, pencil, wagon, staff, saw,  
     jackplane, mallet, wedge, rounce, 
         - Chair, tub, hoop, table, wicket, vane, sash, floor, 
  - Work-box, chest, stringed instrument, boat, frame,  
     and what not, 
  - Capitols of States, and capitol of the nation of  
     States, 
  - Long stately rows in avenues, hospitals for or-
     phans or for the poor or sick, 
  - Manhattan steamboats and clippers, taking the  
     measure of all seas. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - Shapes of the using of axes anyhow, and the  
     users, and all that neighbors them, 
  - Cutters down of wood, and haulers of it to the  
     Penobscot, or St. John's, or Kennebec, 
  - Dwellers in cabins among the Californian moun-
     tains, or by the little lakes, 
  - Dwellers south on the banks of the Gila or Rio  
     Grande — friendly gatherings, the characters  
     and fun, 
  - Dwellers up north in Minnesota and by the  
     Yellowstone river, dwellers on coasts and  
     off coasts, 
  - Seal-fishers, whalers, arctic seamen breaking pas-
     sages through the ice. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - Shapes of factories, arsenals, foundries, markets, 
  - Shapes of the two-threaded tracks of railroads, 
       - Shapes of the sleepers of bridges, vast frame-
     works, girders, arches, 
  - Shapes of the fleets of barges, tows, lake craft,  
     river craft. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - Ship-yards and dry-docks along the Atlantic and  
     Pacific, and in many a bay and by-place, 
  - The live-oak kelsons, the pine planks, the spars,  
     the hackmatuck-roots for knees, 
  - The ships themselves on their ways, the tiers of  
     scaffolds, the workmen busy outside and in-
     side, 
  - The tools lying around, the great augur and little  
     augur, the adze, bolt, line, square, gouge,  
     bead-plane. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - The shape measured, sawed, jacked, joined,  
     stained, 
  - The coffin-shape for the dead to lie within in his  
      
  - The shape got out in posts, in the bedstead posts,  
     in the posts of the bride's-bed, 
  - The shape of the little trough, the shape of the  
     rockers beneath, the shape of the babe's  
     cradle, 
  - The shape of the floor-planks, the floor-planks for  
     dancers' feet, 
       - The shape of the planks of the family home, the  
     home of the friendly parents and children, 
  - The shape of the roof of the home of the happy  
     young man and woman, the roof over the well-
     married young man and woman, 
  - The roof over the supper joyously cooked by the  
     chaste wife, and joyously eaten by the chaste  
     husband, content after his day's work. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - The shape of the prisoner's place in the court-
     room, and of him or her seated in the place, 
  - The shape of the pill-box, the disgraceful oint-
     ment-box, the nauseous application, and him  
     or her applying it, 
  - The shape of the liquor-bar leaned against by the  
     young rum-drinker and the old rum-drinker, 
  - The shape of the shamed and angry stairs, trod  
     by sneaking footsteps, 
  - The shape of the sly settee, and the adulterous  
     unwholesome couple, 
  - The shape of the gambling board with its devilish  
     winnings and losings, 
  - The shape of the slats of the bed of a corrupted  
     body, the bed of the corruption of gluttony or  
     alcoholic drinks, 
  - The shape of the step-ladder for the convicted  
     and sentenced murderer, the murderer with  
     haggard face and pinioned arms, 
       - The sheriff at hand with his deputies, the silent  
     and white-lipped crowd, the sickening dan-
     gling of the rope. 
       - The shapes arise! 
  - Shapes of doors giving so many exits and  
     entrances, 
  - The door passing the dissevered friend, flushed,  
     and in haste, 
  - The door that admits good news and bad news, 
  - The door whence the son left home, confident and  
     puffed up, 
  - The door he entered from a long and scandalous  
     absence, diseased, broken down, without in-
     nocence, without means. 
       - Their shapes arise, the shapes of full-sized men! 
  - Men taciturn yet loving, used to the open air, and  
     the manners of the open air, 
  - Saying their ardor in native forms, saying the old  
     response, 
  - Take what I have then, (saying fain,) take the pay  
     you approached for, 
  - Take the white tears of my blood, if that is what  
     you are after. 
       - Her shape arises! 
  - She, less guarded than ever, yet more guarded  
     than ever, 
       - The gross and soiled she moves among do not  
     make her gross and soiled, 
  - She knows the thoughts as she passes, nothing is  
     concealed from her, 
  - She is none the less considerate or friendly there-
     fore, 
  - She is the best-beloved, it is without exception,  
     she has no reason to fear, and she does not  
     fear, 
  - Oaths, quarrels, hiccuped songs, smutty expres-
     sions, are idle to her as she passes, 
  - She is silent, she is possessed of herself, they do  
     not offend her, 
  - She receives them as the laws of nature receive  
     them, she is strong, 
  - She too is a law of nature, there is no law greater  
     than she is. 
       - His shape arises! 
  - Arrogant, masculine, naive, rowdyish, 
  - Laugher, weeper, worker, idler, citizen, country-
     man, 
  - Saunterer of woods, stander upon hills, summer  
     swimmer in rivers or by the sea, 
  - Or pure American breed, of reckless health, his  
     body perfect, free from taint from top to toe,  
     free forever from headache and dyspepsia,  
     clean-breathed, 
       - Ample-limbed, a good feeder, weight a hundred  
     and eighty pounds, full-blooded, six feet high,  
     forty inches round the breast and back, 
  - Countenance sun-burnt, bearded, calm, unrefined, 
  - Reminder of animals, meeter of savage and gen-
     tleman on equal terms, 
  - Attitudes lithe and erect, costume free, neck open,  
     of slow movement on foot, 
  - Passer of his right arm round the shoulders of his  
     friends, companion of the street, 
  - Persuader always of people to give him their  
     sweetest touches, and never their meanest, 
  - A Manhattanese bred, fond of Brooklyn, fond of  
     Broadway, fond of the life of the wharves  
     and the great ferries, 
  - Enterer everywhere, welcomed everywhere, eas-
     ily understood after all, 
  - Never offering others, always offering himself,  
     corroborating his phrenology, 
  - Voluptuous, inhabitive, combative, conscientious,  
     alimentive, intuitive, of copious friendship,  
     sublimity, firmness, self-esteem, comparison,  
     individuality, form, locality, eventuality, 
  - Avowing by life, manners, works, to contributo  
     illustrations of results of The States, 
  - Teacher of the unquenchable creed, namely,  
     egotism, 
  - Inviter of others continually henceforth to try  
     their strength against his. 
            - The shapes arise! 
  - Shapes of America, shapes of centuries, 
  - Shapes of those that do not joke with life, but are  
     in earnest with life, 
  - Shapes ever projecting other shapes, 
  - Shapes of a hundred Free States, begetting  
     another hundred north and south, 
  - Shapes of the turbulent manly cities, 
  - Shapes of the untamed breed of young men and  
     natural persons, 
  - Shapes of women fit for These States, 
  - Shapes of the composition of all the varieties of  
     the earth, 
  - Shapes of the friends and home-givers of the  
     whole earth, 
  - Shapes bracing the whole earth, and braced with  
     the whole earth. 
           
## 6 — Poem of a Few Greatnesses. 

     - GREAT are the myths, I too delight in them,  
     Great are Adam and Eve, I too look back and  
     accept them, 
  - Great the risen and fallen nations, and their poets,  
     women, sages, inventors, rulers, warriors,  
     priests. 
       - Great is liberty! Great is equality! I am their  
     follower, 
  - Helmsmen of nations, choose your craft! where  
     you sail, I sail! 
  - Yours is the muscle of life or death, yours is the  
     perfect science, in you I have absolute faith. 
       - Great is today, and beautiful, 
  - It is good to live in this age, there never was any  
     better. 
       - Great are the plunges, throes, triumphs, falls of  
     democracy, 
  - Great the reformers, with their lapses and screams, 
  - Great the daring and venture of sailors on new  
     explorations. 
            - Great are yourself and myself, 
  - We are just as good and bad as the oldest and  
     youngest or any, 
  - What the best and worst did, we could do, 
  - What they felt, do not we feel it in ourselves? 
  - What they wished, do we not wish the same? 
       - Great is youth, equally great is old age — great are  
     the day and night, 
  - Great is wealth, great is poverty, great is expres-
     sion, great is silence, 
       - Youth, large, lusty, loving — youth, full of grace,  
     force, fascination, 
  - Do you know that old age may come after you,  
     with equal grace, force, fascination? 
       - Day, full-blown and splendid — day of the im-
     mense sun, action, ambition, laughter, 
  - The night follows close, with millions of suns,  
     and sleep, and restoring darkness. 
       - Wealth with the flush hand, fine clothes, hospi-
     tality, 
  - But then the soul's wealth, which is candor,  
     kncwledge, pride, enfolding love; 
  - (Who goes for men and women showing poverty  
     richer than wealth?) 
       - Expression of speech! in what is written or said,  
     forget not that silence is also expressive, 
  - That anguish as hot as the hottest, and contempt  
     as cold as the coldest, may be without words, 
  - That the true adoration is likewise without words,  
     and without kneeling. 
       - Great is the greatest nation! the nation of clus-
     ters of equal nations! 
       - Great is the earth, and the way it became what it  
     is, 
  - Do you imagine it is stopped at this? the increase  
     abandoned? 
  - Understand then that it goes as far onward from  
     this, as this is from the times when it lay in  
     covering waters and gases. 
       - Great is the quality of truth in man, 
  - The quality of truth in man supports itself  
     through all changes, 
  - It is inevitably in the man — he and it are in love,  
     and never leave each other. 
       - The truth in man is no dictum, it is vital as eye-
     sight, 
  - If there be any soul, there is truth — if there be  
     man or woman, there is truth — if there be  
     physical or moral, there is truth, 
       - If there be equilibrium or volition, there is truth  
      — if there be things at all upon the earth,  
     there is truth. 
       - O truth of the earth! O truth of things! I am  
     determined to press the whole way toward  
     you, 
  - Sound your voice! I scale mountains, or dive in  
     the sea after you. 
       - Great is language — it is the mightiest of the  
     sciences, 
  - It is the fulness, color, form, diversity of the  
     earth, and of men and women, and of all  
     qualities and processes, 
  - It is greater than wealth — it is greater than  
     buildings, ships, religions, paintings, music. 
       - Great is the English speech — what speech is so  
     great as the English? 
  - Great is the English brood — what brood has so  
     vast a destiny as the English? 
  - It is the mother of the brood that must rule the  
     earth with the new rule, 
  - The new rule shall rule as the soul rules, and as  
     the love, justice, equality in the soul, rule. 
       - Great in the law — great are the old few land-
     marks of the law, 
       - They are the same in all times, and shall not be  
     disturbed. 
       - Great are marriage, commerce, newspapers,  
     books, free-trade, rail-roads, steamers, interna-
     tional mails, telegraphs, exchanges. 
       - Great is justice! 
  - Justice is not settled by legislators and laws — it  
     is in the soul, 
  - It cannot be varied by statutes, any more than  
     love, pride, the attraction of gravity, can, 
  - It is immutable — it does not depend on major-
     ities — majorities or what not come at last  
     before the same passionless and exact tri-
     bunal. 
       - For justice are the grand natural lawyers and per-
     fect judges, it is in their souls, 
  - It is well assorted, they have not studied for noth-
     ing, the great includes the less, 
  - They rule on the highest grounds, they oversee  
     all eras, states, administrations. 
       - The perfect judge fears nothing, he could go front  
     to front before God, 
  - Before the perfect judge all shall stand back —  
     life and death shall stand back — heaven and  
     hell shall stand back. 
            - Great is goodness! 
  - I do not know what it is any more than I know  
     what health is, but I know it is great. 
       - Great is wickedness — I find I often admire it just  
     as much as I admire goodness, 
  - Do you call that a paradox? It certainly is a par-
     adox. 
       - The eternal equilibrium of things is great, and the  
     eternal overthrow of things is great, 
  - And there is another paradox. 
       - Great is life, real and mystical, wherever and  
     whoever, 
  - Great is death — sure as life holds all parts to-
     gether, death holds all parts together, 
  - Death has just as much purport as life has, 
  - Do you enjoy what life confers? you shall enjoy  
     what death confers, 
  - I do not understand the realities of death, but I  
     know they are great, 
  - I do not understand the least reality of life —  
     how then can I understand the realities of  
     death? 
           
## 7 — Poem of The Body. 

     - THE bodies of men and women engirth me, and  
     I engirth them, 
  - They will not let me off, nor I them, till I go with  
     them, respond to them, love them. 
       - Was it doubted if those who corrupt their own live  
     bodies conceal themselves? 
  - And if those who defile the living are as bad as  
     they who defile the dead? 
  - And if the body does not do as much as the soul? 
  - And if the body were not the soul, what is the  
     soul? 
       - The expression of the body of man or woman  
     balks account, 
  - The male is perfect, and that of the female is per-
     fect. 
       - The expression of a well-made man appears not  
     only in his face, 
  - It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in  
     the joints of his hips and wrists, 
       - It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex  
     of his waist and knees — dress does not  
     hide him, 
  - The strong, sweet, supple quality he has, strikes  
     through the cotton and flannel, 
  - To see him pass conveys as much as the best  
     poem, perhaps more, 
  - You linger to see his back, and the back of his  
     neck and shoulder-side. 
       - The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and  
     heads of women, the folds of their dress,  
     their style as we pass in the street, the con-
     tour of their shape downwards, 
  - The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen  
     as he swims through the transparent green-
     shine, or lies with his face up, and rolls  
     silently in the heave of the water, 
  - The bending forward and backward of rowers in  
     row-boats, the horseman in his saddle, 
  - Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their per-
     formances, 
  - The group of laborers seated at noon-time with  
     their open dinner-kettles, and their wives  
     waiting, 
  - The female soothing a child, the farmer's daughter  
     in the garden or cow-yard, 
  - The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver  
     guiding his six horses through the crowd, 
       - The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys,  
     quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born,  
     out on the vacant lot at sun-down, after work, 
  - The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of  
     love and resistance, 
  - The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled  
     over and blinding the eyes; 
  - The march of firemen in their own costumes, the  
     play of masculine muscle through clean-set-
     ting trowsers and waist-straps, 
  - The slow return from the fire, the pause when the  
     bell strikes suddenly again, the listening on  
     the alert, 
  - The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent  
     head, the curved neck, the counting, 
  - Such-like I love, I loosen myself, pass freely,  
     am at the mother's breast with the little  
     child, 
  - Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers,  
     march in line with the firemen, pause, listen,  
     count. 
       - I knew a man, he was a common farmer, he was  
     the father of five sons, and in them were the  
     fathers of sons, and in them were the fathers  
     of sons. 
       - This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness,  
     beauty of person, 
         - The shape of his head, the richness and breadth  
     of his manners, the pale yellow and white  
     of his hair and beard, the immeasurable  
     meaning of his black eyes, 
  - These I used to go and visit him to see — he was  
     wise also, 
  - He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years  
     old — his sons were massive, clean, bearded,  
     tan-faced, handsome, 
  - They and his daughters loved him, all who saw  
     him loved him, they did not love him by  
     allowance, they loved him with personal  
     love, 
  - He drank water only, the blood showed like scar-
     let through the clear brown skin of his face, 
  - He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sailed his  
     boat himself, he had a fine one presented to  
     him by a ship-joiner — he had fowling-pieces,  
     presented to him by men that loved him, 
  - When he went with his five sons and many grand-
     sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out  
     as the most beautiful and vigorous of the  
     gang, 
  - You would wish long and long to be with him —  
     you would wish to sit by him in the boat,  
     that you and he might touch each other. 
       - I have perceived that to be with those I like is  
     enough, 
       - To stop in company with the rest at evening is  
     enough, 
  - To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breath-
     ing, laughing flesh is enough, 
  - To pass among them, to touch any one, to rest  
     my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck  
     for a moment — what is this, then? 
  - I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it, as in  
     a sea. 
       - There is something in staying close to men and  
     women, and looking on them, and in the con-
     tact and odor of them, that pleases the soul  
     well, 
  - All things please the soul, but these please the  
     soul well. 
       - This is the female form! 
  - A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, 
  - It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, 
  - I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more  
     than a helpless vapor — all falls aside but  
     myself and it, 
  - Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth,  
     the atmosphere and the clouds, what was  
     expected of heaven or feared of hell, are now  
     consumed, 
  - Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it,  
     the response likewise ungovernable, 
       - Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling  
     hands, all diffused — mine too diffused, 
  - Ebb stung by the flow, and flow stung by the ebb,  
     love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, 
  - Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous,  
     quivering jelly of love, white-blow and deliri-
     ous juice, 
  - Bridegroom-night of love, working surely and  
     softly into the prostrate dawn, 
  - Undulating into the willing and yielding day, 
  - Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-
     fleshed day. 
       - This is the nucleus — after the child is born of  
     woman, the man is born of woman, 
  - This is the bath of birth — this is the merge of  
     small and large, and the outlet again. 
       - Be not ashamed, women! your privilege encloses  
     the rest, it is the exit of the rest, 
  - You are the gates of the body, and you are the  
     gates of the soul! 
       - The female contains all qualities, and tempers  
     them — she is in her place, she moves with  
     perfect balance, 
  - She is all things duly veiled, she is both passive  
     and active — she is to conceive daughters as  
     well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. 
            - As I see my soul reflected in nature, as I see  
     through a mist, one with inexpressible com-
     pleteness and beauty — see the bent head and  
     arms folded over the breast, the female I  
     see, 
  - I see the bearer of the great fruit which is im-
     mortality — the good thereof is not tasted  
     by roues, and never can be. 
       - The male is not less the soul, nor more — he too  
     is in his place, 
  - He too is all qualities, he is action and power, the  
     flush of the known universe is in him, 
  - Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defi-
     ance become him well, 
  - The fiercest largest passions, bliss that is utmost,  
     sorrow that is utmost, become him well —  
     pride is for him, 
  - The full-spread pride of man is calming and ex-
     cellent to the soul, 
  - Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he  
     brings everything to the test of himself, 
  - Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the  
     sail, he strikes soundings at last only here, 
  - Where else does he strike soundings, except  
     here? 
       - The man's body is sacred, and the woman's body  
     is sacred — it is no matter who, 
       - Is it a slave? Is it one of the dull-faced immi-
     grants just landed on the wharf? 
  - Each belongs here or anywhere, just as much as  
     the well-off, just as much as you, 
  - Each has his or her place in the procession. 
       - All is a procession! 
  - The universe is a procession, with measured and  
     beautiful motion! 
       - Do you know so much, that you call the slave or  
     the dull-face ignorant? 
  - Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight,  
     and he or she has no right to a sight? 
  - Do you think matter has cohered together from its  
     diffused float, and the soil is on the surface,  
     and water runs, and vegetation sprouts, for  
     you, and not for him and her? 
       - A man's body at auction! 
  - I help the auctioneer — the sloven does not half  
     know his business. 
       - Gentlemen, look on this wonder! 
  - Whatever the bids of the bidders, they cannot be  
     high enough for it, 
  - For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years,  
     without one animal or plant, 
  - For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily  
     rolled. 
            - In this head the all-baffling brain, 
  - In it and below it the making of the attributes of  
     heroes. 
       - Examine these limbs, red, black, or white — they  
     are so cunning in tendon and nerve, 
  - They shall be stript that you may see them. 
       - Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, 
  - Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant back-bone and  
     neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and  
     legs, 
  - And wonders within there yet. 
       - Within there runs blood — the same old blood!  
     the same red running blood! 
  - There swells and jets a heart — there all passions,  
     desires, reachings, aspirations, 
  - Do you think they are not there because they are  
     not expressed in parlors and lecture-rooms? 
       - This is not only one man — this is the father of  
     those who shall be fathers in their turns, 
  - In him the start of populous states and rich re-
     publics, 
  - Of him countless immortal lives, with countless  
     embodiments and enjoyments. 
       - How do you know who shall come from the off-
     spring of his offspring through the centuries? 
       - Who might you find you have come from yourself,  
     if you could trace back through the cen-
     turies? 
       - A woman's body at auction! 
  - She too is not only herself, she is the teeming  
     mother of mothers, 
  - She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be  
     mates to the mothers. 
       - Her daughters, or their daughters' daughters —  
     who knows who shall mate with them? 
  - Who knows through the centuries what heroes  
     may come from them? 
       - In them, and of them, natal love — in them  
     the divine mystery, the same old beautiful  
     mystery. 
       - Have you ever loved the body of a woman? 
  - Have you ever loved the body of a man? 
  - Your father, where is your father? 
  - Your mother, is she living? Have you been  
     much with her? and has she been much  
     with you? 
  - Do you not see that these are exactly the same  
     to all, in all nations and times, all over the  
     earth? 
            - If any thing is sacred, the human body is sacred, 
  - And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of  
     manhood untainted, 
  - And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred  
     body, is beautiful as the most beautiful face. 
       - Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live  
     body? or the fool that corrupted her own live  
     body? 
  - For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot  
     conceal themselves. 
       - O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in  
     other men and women, nor the likes of the  
     parts of you! 
  - I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with  
     the likes of the soul, 
  - I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with  
     my poems — for they are poems, 
  - Man's, woman's, child's, youth's, wife's, husband's,  
     mother's, father's, young man's, young woman's  
     poems, 
  - Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the  
     ears, 
  - Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eye-brows, and  
     the waking or sleeping of the lids, 
  - Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth,  
     jaws, and the jaw-hinges, 
  - Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, 
         - Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of  
     the neck, neck-slue, 
  - Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-
     shoulders, and the ample side-round of the  
     chest, 
  - Upper-arm, arm-pit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-
     sinews, arm-bones, 
  - Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles,  
     thumb, forefinger, finger-balls, finger-joints,  
     finger-nails, 
  - Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast,  
     breast-bone, breast-side, 
  - Ribs, belly, back-bone, joints of the back-bone, 
  - Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and out-
     ward round, man-balls, man-root, 
  - Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk  
     above, 
  - Leg-fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, 
  - Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel, 
  - All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings  
     of my or your body, or of any one's body,  
     male or female, 
  - The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels  
     sweet and clean, 
  - The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, 
  - Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality  
     maternity, 
  - Womanhood, and all that is a woman — and the  
     man that comes from woman, 
       - The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears,  
     laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturba-
     tions and risings, 
  - The voice, articulation, language, whispering,  
     shouting aloud, 
  - Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walk-
     ing, swimming, 
  - Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing,  
     arm-curving, and tightening, 
  - The continual changes of the flex of the mouth,  
     and around the eyes, 
  - The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair, 
  - The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling  
     with the hand the naked meat of his own  
     body or another person's body, 
  - The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in  
     and out, 
  - The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips,  
     and thence downward toward the knees, 
  - The thin red jellies within you, or within me —  
     the bones, and the marrow in the bones, 
  - The exquisite realization of health, 
  - O I think these are not the parts and poems of  
     the body only, but of the soul, 
  - O I think these are the soul! 
  - If these are not the soul, what is the soul? 
           
## 8 — Poem of Many In One. 

     - A NATION announcing itself,  
     I myself make the only growth by which I  
     can be appreciated, 
  - I reject none, accept all, reproduce all in my own  
     forms. 
       - A breed whose testimony is behaviour, 
  - What we are, we are — nativity is answer enough  
     to objections; 
  - We wield ourselves as a weapon is wielded, 
  - We are powerful and tremendous in ourselves, 
  - We are executive in ourselves — we are sufficient  
     in the variety of ourselves, 
  - We are the most beautiful to ourselves and in our-
     selves, 
  - Nothing is sinful to us outside of ourselves, 
  - Whatever appears, whatever does not appear, we  
     are beautiful or sinful in ourselves. 
       - Have you thought there could be but a single  
     Supreme? 
            - There can be any number of Supremes — one  
     does not countervail another any more than  
     one eye-sight countervails another, or one life  
     countervails another. 
       - All is eligible to all, 
  - All is for individuals — all is for you, 
  - No condition is prohibited, not God's or any, 
  - If one is lost, you are inevitably lost. 
       - All comes by the body — only health puts you  
     rapport with the universe. 
       - Produce great persons, the rest follows.
    - How dare a sick man, or an obedient man, write  
     poems? 
  - Which is the theory or book that is not diseased? 
       - Piety and conformity to them that like! 
  - Peace, obesity, allegiance, to them that like! 
  - I am he who tauntingly compels men, women,  
     nations, to leap from their seats and contend  
     for their lives! 
       - I am he who goes through the streets with a  
     barbed tongue, questioning every one I meet  
      — questioning you up there now, 
  - Who are you, that wanted only to be told what  
     you knew before? 
       - Who are you, that wanted only a book to join you  
     in your nonsense? 
       - Are you, or would you be, better than all that has  
     ever been before? 
  - If you would be better than all that has ever been  
     before, come listen to me, and I will to you. 
       - Fear grace! Fear delicatesse! 
  - Fear the mellow sweet, the sucking of honey-
     juice! 
  - Beware the advancing mortal ripening of nature! 
  - Beware what precedes the decay of the rugged-
     ness of states and men! 
       - Ages, precedents, poems, have long been accumu-
     lating undirected materials, 
  - America brings builders, and brings its own styles. 
       - Mighty bards have done their work, and passed to  
     other spheres, 
  - One work forever remains, the work of surpassing  
     all they have done. 
       - America, curious toward foreign characters,  
     stands sternly by its own, 
  - Stands removed, spacious, composite, sound, 
  - Sees itself promulger of men and women, initiates  
     the true use of precedents, 
       - Does not repel them or the past, or what they  
     have produced under their forms, or amid  
     other politics, or amid the idea of castes, or  
     the old religions, 
  - Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the  
     corpse slowly borne from the eating and  
     sleeping rooms of the house, 
  - Perceives that it waits a little while in the door,  
     that it was fittest for its days, that its life has  
     descended to the stalwart and well-shaped  
     heir who approaches, and that he shall be fit-
     test for his days. 
       - Any period, one nation must lead, 
  - One land must be the promise and reliance of the  
     future. 
       - These States are the amplest poem, 
  - Here is not merely a nation, but a teeming nation  
     of nations, 
  - Here the doings of men correspond with the  
     broadcast doings of the day and night, 
  - Here is what moves in magnificent masses, care-
     lessly faithful of particulars, 
  - Here are the roughs, beards, friendliness, com-
     bativeness, the soul loves, 
  - Here the flowing trains, here the crowds, equality,  
     diversity, the soul loves. 
       - Race of races, and bards to corroborate! 
       - Of them, standing among them, one lifts to the  
     light his west-bred face, 
  - To him the hereditary countenance bequeathed,  
     both mother's and father's, 
  - His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees, 
  - Built of the common stock, having room for far  
     and near, 
  - Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this  
     land, 
  - Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on  
     its neck with incomparable love, 
  - Plunging his semitic muscle into its merits and  
     demerits, 
  - Making its geography, cities, beginnings, events,  
     glories, defections, diversities, vocal in him, 
  - Making its rivers, lakes, bays, embouchure in him, 
  - Mississippi with yearly freshets and changing  
     chutes, Missouri, Columbia, Ohio, St. Law-
     rence, Hudson, spending themselves lovingly  
     in him, 
  - The blue breadth over the sea off Massachusetts  
     and Maine, or over the Virginia and Maryland  
     sea, or over inland Champlain, Ontario, Erie,  
     Huron, Michigan, Superior, or over the  
     Texan, Mexican, Cuban, Floridian seas, or  
     over the seas off California and Oregon, not  
     tallying the breadth of the waters below,  
     more than the breadth of above and below is  
     tallied in him, 
       - If the Atlantic coast stretch, or the Pacific coast  
     stretch, he stretching with them north or south, 
  - Spanning between them east and west, and touch-
     ing whatever is between them, 
  - Growths growing from him to offset the growth of  
     pine, cedar, hemlock, live-oak, locust, chest-
     nut, cypress, hickory, lime-tree, cotton-wood,  
     tulip-tree, cactus, tamarind, orange, magnolia,  
     persimmon, 
  - Tangles as tangled in him as any cane-brake or  
     swamp, 
  - He likening sides and peaks of mountains, forests  
     coated with transparent ice, and icicles hang-
     ing from the boughs, 
  - Off him pasturage sweet and natural as savannah,  
     upland, prairie, 
  - Through him flights, songs, screams, answering  
     those of the wild-pigeon, high-hold, orchard-
     oriole, coot, surf-duck, red-shouldered-hawk,  
     fish-hawk, white-ibis, indian-hen, cat-owl,  
     water-pheasant, qua-bird, pied-sheldrake,  
     mocking-bird, buzzard, condor, night-heron,  
      
  - His spirit surrounding his country's spirit, unclosed  
     to good and evil, 
  - Surrounding the essences of real things, old times  
     and present times, 
  - Surrounding just found shores, islands, tribes of  
     red aborigines, 
       - Weather-beaten vessels, landings, settlements, the  
     rapid stature and muscle, 
  - The haughty defiance of the Year 1 — war, peace,  
     the formation of the Constitution, 
  - The separate States, the simple, elastic scheme,  
     the immigrants, 
  - The Union, always swarming with blatherers, and  
     always calm and impregnable, 
  - The unsurveyed interior, log-houses, clearings,  
     wild animals, hunters, trappers; 
  - Surrounding the multiform agriculture, mines,  
     temperature, the gestation of new States, 
  - Congress convening every December, the mem-
     bers duly coming up from the uttermost  
      
  - Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and  
     farmers, especially the young men, 
  - Responding their manners, speech, dress, friend-
     ships — the gait they have of persons who  
     never knew how it felt to stand in the  
     presence of superiors, 
  - The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the  
     copiousness and decision of their phrenology, 
  - The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their  
     deathless attachment to freedom, their fierce-
     ness when wronged, 
  - The fluency of their speech, their delight in  
     music, their curiosity, good-temper, open-
     handedness, 
       - The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large  
     amativeness, 
  - The perfect equality of the female with the male,  
     the fluid movement of the population, 
  - The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries,  
     whaling, gold-digging, 
  - Wharf-hemm'd cities, railroad and steamboat lines,  
     intersecting all points, 
  - Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery,  
     the north-east, north-west, south-west, 
  - Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern  
     plantation life, 
  - Slavery, the tremulous spreading of hands to  
     shelter it — the stern opposition to it, which  
     ceases only when it ceases. 
       - For these, and the like, their own voices! For  
     these, space ahead! 
  - Others take finish, but the republic is ever con-
     structive, and ever keeps vista; 
  - Others adorn the past — but you, O, days of the  
     present, I adorn you! 
  - O days of the future, I believe in you! 
  - O America, because you build for mankind, I build  
     for you! 
  - O well-beloved stone-cutters! I lead them who  
     plan with decision and science, 
  - I lead the present with friendly hand toward the  
     future. 
            - Bravas to states whose semitic impulses send  
     wholesome children to the next age! 
  - But damn that which spends itself on flaunters and  
     dallyers, with no thought of the stains, pains,  
     dismay, feebleness, it is bequeathing! 
       - By great bards only can series of peoples and  
     States be fused into the compact organism of  
     one nation. 
       - To hold men together by paper and seal, or by  
     compulsion, is no account, 
  - That only holds men together which is living  
     principles, as the hold of the limbs of the  
     body, or the fibres of plants. 
       - Of all races and eras, These States, with veins full  
     of poetical stuff, most need poets, and are to  
     have the greatest, and use them the greatest, 
  - Their Presidents shall not be their common ref-
     eree so much as their poets shall. 
       - Of mankind, the poet is the equable man, 
  - Not in him, but off from him, things are grotesque,  
     eccentric, fail of their full returns, 
  - Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its  
     place is bad, 
  - He bestows on every object or quality its fit pro-
     portions, neither more nor less, 
  - He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key, 
       - He is the equalizer of his age and land 
  - He supplies what wants supplying — he checks  
     what wants checking, 
  - In peace, out of him speaks the spirit of peace,  
     large, rich, thrifty, building populous towns,  
     encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce,  
     lighting the study of man, the soul, health,  
     immortality, government, 
  - In war he is the best backer of the war — he  
     fetches artillery as good as the engineer's, he  
     can make every word he speaks draw blood; 
  - The years straying toward infidelity he withholds  
     by his steady faith, 
  - He is no arguer, he is judgment, 
  - He judges not as the judge judges, but as the sun  
     falling round a helpless thing, 
  - As he sees the farthest he has the most faith, 
  - His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things, 
  - In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent, 
  - He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue  
     and denouement, 
  - He sees eternity in men and women — he does  
     not see men and women as dreams or dots. 
       - An American literat fills his own place, 
  - He justifies science — did you think the demon-
     strable less divine than the mythical? 
  - He stands by liberty according to the compact of  
     the first day of the first year of These States, 
       - He concentres in the real body and soul, and in  
     the pleasure of things, 
  - He possesses the superiority of genuineness over  
     fiction and romance; 
  - As he emits himself, facts are showered over with  
     light, 
  - The day-light is lit with more volatile light — the  
     deep between the setting and rising sun goes  
     deeper many fold, 
  - Each precise object, condition, combination, pro-
     cess, exhibits a beauty — the multiplication-
     table its, old age its, the carpenter's trade  
     its, the grand-opera its, 
  - The huge-hulled clean-shaped Manhattan clipper  
     at sea, under steam or full sail, gleams with  
     unmatched beauty, 
  - The national circles and large harmonies of gov-
     ernment gleam with theirs, 
  - The commonest definite intentions and actions  
     with theirs. 
       - Of the idea of perfect individuals, the idea of  
     These States, their bards walk in advance,  
     leaders of leaders, 
  - The attitudes of them cheer up slaves and horrify  
     despots. 
       - Without extinction is liberty! Without retrograde  
     is equality! 
            - They live in the feelings of young men, and the  
     best women, 
  - Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the  
     earth been always ready to fall for liberty! 
       - Language-using controls the rest; 
  - Wonderful is language! 
  - Wondrous the English language, language of live  
     men, 
  - Language of ensemble, powerful language of re-
     sistance, 
  - Language of a proud and melancholy stock, and  
     of all who aspire, 
  - Language of growth, faith, self-esteem, rudeness,  
     justice, friendliness, amplitude, prudence, de-
     cision, exactitude, courage, 
  - Language to well-nigh express the inexpressible, 
  - Language for the modern, language for America. 
       - Who would use language to America may well  
     prepare himself, body and mind, 
  - He may well survey, ponder, arm, fortify, harden,  
     make lithe, himself, 
  - He shall surely be questioned beforehand by me  
     with many and stern questions. 
       - Who are you that would talk to America? 
  - Have you studied out my land, its idioms and  
     men? 
            - Have you learned the physiology, phrenology,  
     politics, geography, pride, freedom, friendship,  
     of my land? its substratums and objects? 
  - Have you considered the organic compact of the  
     first day of the first year of the independence  
     of The States? 
  - Have you possessed yourself of the Federal Con-
     stitution? 
  - Do you acknowledge liberty with audible and  
     absolute acknowledgment, and set slavery at  
     naught for life and death? 
  - Do you see who have left described processes and  
     poems behind them, and assumed new ones? 
  - Are you faithful to things? Do you teach what-
     ever the land and sea, the bodies of men,  
     womanhood, amativeness, angers, excesses,  
     crimes, teach? 
  - Have you sped through customs, laws, popu-
     larities? 
  - Can you hold your hand against all seductions,  
     follies, whirls, fierce contentions? 
  - Are you not of some coterie? some school or  
     religion? 
  - Are you done with reviews and criticisms of life?  
     animating to life itself? 
  - Have you possessed yourself with the spirit of the  
     maternity of These States? 
  - Have you sucked the nipples of the breasts of the  
     mother of many children? 
            - Have you too the old, ever-fresh, forbearance and  
     impartiality? 
  - Do you hold the like love for those hardening to  
     maturity? for the last-born? little and big?  
     and for the errant? 
  - What is this you bring my America? 
  - Is it uniform with my country? 
  - Is it not something that has been better told or  
     done before? 
  - Have you imported this, or the spirit of it, in some  
     ship? 
  - Is it a mere tale? a rhyme? a prettiness? 
  - Has it never dangled at the heels of the poets,  
     politicians, literats, of enemies' lands? 
  - Does it not assume that what is notoriously gone  
     is still here? 
  - Does it answer universal needs? Will it improve  
     manners? 
  - Can your performance face the open fields and the  
     sea-side? 
  - Will it absorb into me as I absorb food, air,  
     nobility, meanness — to appear again in my  
     strength, gait, face? 
  - Have real employments contributed to it? original  
     makers, not amanuenses? 
  - Does it meet modern discoveries, calibers, facts,  
     face to face? 
  - Does it respect me? America? the soul? to-
     day? 
               - What does it mean to me? to American persons, pro-
     gresses, cities? Chicago, Canada, Arkansas?  
     the planter, Yankee, Georgian, native, immi-
     grant, sailors, squatters, old States, new States? 
  - Does it encompass all The States, and the  
     unexceptional rights of all men and women,  
     the genital impulse of The States? 
  - Does it see behind the apparent custodians, the  
     real custodians, standing, menacing, silent,  
     the mechanics, Manhattanese, western men,  
     southerners, significant alike in their apathy  
     and in the promptness of their love? 
  - Does it see what befals and has always befallen  
     each temporiser, patcher, outsider, partialist,  
     alarmist, infidel, who has ever asked any-
     thing of America? 
  - What mocking and scornful negligence? 
  - The track strewed with the dust of skeletons? 
  - By the road-side others disdainfully tossed? 
       - Rhymes and rhymers pass away — poems dis-
     tilled from other poems pass away, 
  - The swarms of reflectors and the polite pass, and  
     leave ashes, 
  - Admirers, importers, obedient persons, make the  
     soil of literature; 
  - America justifies itself, give it time — no disguise  
     can deceive it or conceal from it — it is im-
     passive enough, 
       - Only toward the likes of itself will it advance to  
     meet them, 
  - If its poets appear, it will advance to meet them,  
     there is no fear of mistake, 
  - The proof of a poet shall be sternly deferred till  
     his country absorbs him as affectionately as  
     he has absorbed it. 
       - He masters whose spirit masters — he tastes  
     sweetest who results sweetest, 
  - The blood of the brawn beloved of time is uncon-
     straint, 
  - In the need of poems, philosophy, politics,  
     manners, engineering, an appropriate native  
     grand-opera, ship-craft, any craft, he or she  
     is greatest who contributes the greatest  
     original practical example. 
       - Already a nonchalant breed silently fills the  
     houses and streets, 
  - People's lips salute only doers, lovers, satisfiers,  
     positive knowers; 
  - There will shortly be no more priests — their  
     work is done, 
  - Death is without emergencies here, but life is per-
     petual emergencies here, 
  - Are your body, days, manners, superb? after death  
     you shall be superb, 
       - Friendship, self-esteem, justice, health, clear the  
     way with irresistible power. 
       - Give me the pay I have served for! 
  - Give me to speak beautiful words! take all the  
      
  - I have loved the earth, sun, animals — I have de-
     spised riches, 
  - I have given alms to every one that asked, stood  
     up for the stupid and crazy, devoted my in-
     come and labor to others, 
  - I have hated tyrants, argued not concerning God,  
     had patience and indulgence toward the peo-
     ple, taken off my hat to nothing known or  
     unknown, 
  - I have gone freely with powerful uneducated per-
     sons, and with the young, and with the  
     mothers of families, 
  - I have read these leaves to myself in the open air,  
     I have tried them by trees, stars, rivers, 
  - I have dismissed whatever insulted my own soul  
     or defiled my body, 
  - I have claimed nothing to myself which I have  
     not carefully claimed for others on the same  
     terms, 
  - I have studied my land, its idioms and men, 
  - I am willing to wait to be understood by the  
     growth of the taste of myself, 
  - I reject none, I permit all, 
       - Whom I have staid with once I have found long-
     ing for me ever afterwards. 
       - I swear I begin to see the meaning of these  
     things! 
  - It is not the earth, it is not America who is so  
     great, 
  - It is I who am great, or to be great — it is you, or  
     any one, 
  - It is to walk rapidly through civilizations, govern-
     ments, theories, nature, poems, shows, to in-
     dividuals. 
       - Underneath all are individuals, 
  - I swear nothing is good that ignores individuals! 
  - The American compact is with individuals, 
  - The only government is that which makes minute  
     of individuals. 
       - Underneath all is nativity, 
  - I swear I will stand by my own nativity — pious  
     or impious, so be it! 
  - I swear I am charmed with nothing except  
     nativity! 
  - Men, women, cities, nations, are only beautiful  
     from nativity. 
       - Underneath all is the need of the expression of  
     love for men and women, 
       - I swear I have had enough of mean and impotent  
     modes of expressing love for men and  
     women, 
  - After this day I take my own modes of express-
     ing love for men and women. 
       - I swear I will have each quality of my race in  
     myself, 
  - Talk as you like, he only suits These States  
     whose manners favor the audacity and sub-
     lime turbulence of These States. 
       - Underneath the lessons of things, spirits, nature,  
     governments, ownerships, I swear I perceive  
     other lessons, 
  - Underneath all to me is myself — to you, your-
     self, 
  - If all had not kernels for you and me, what were  
     it to you and me? 
       - O I see now that this America is only you and  
     me, 
  - Its power, weapons, testimony, are you and me, 
  - Its roughs, beards, haughtiness, ruggedness, are  
     you and me, 
  - Its ample geography, the sierras, the prairies,  
     Mississippi, Huron, Colorado, Boston, To-
     ronto, Releigh, Nashville, Havana, are you  
     and me, 
       - Its settlements, wars, the organic compact, peace,  
     Washington, the Federal Constitution, are  
     you and me, 
  - Its young men's manners, speech, dress, friend-
     ships, are you and me, 
  - Its crimes, lies, thefts, defections, slavery, are you  
     and me, 
  - Its Congress is you and me, the officers, capitols,  
     armies, ships, are you and me, 
  - Its endless gestations of new States are you and  
     me, 
  - Its inventions, science, schools, are you and me, 
  - Its deserts, forests, clearings, log-houses, hunters,  
     are you and me, 
  - The perpetual arrivals of immigrants are you and  
     me, 
  - Natural and artificial are you and me, 
  - Freedom, language, poems, employments, are you  
     and me, 
  - Failures, successes, births, deaths, are you and me, 
  - Past, present, future, are only you and me. 
       - I swear I dare not shirk any part of myself, 
  - Not America, nor any part of America, 
  - Not my body, not friendship, hospitality, pro-
     creation, 
  - Not my soul, not the last explanation of prudence, 
  - Not the similitude that interlocks me with all  
     identities that exist, or ever have existed, 
       - Not faith, sin, defiance, nor any disposition or duty  
     of myself, 
  - Not the promulgation of liberty, not to cheer up  
     slaves and horrify despots, 
  - Not to build for that which builds for mankind, 
  - Not to balance ranks, complexions, creeds, and  
     the sexes, 
  - Not to justify science, not the march of equality, 
  - Not to feed the arrogant blood of the brawn  
     beloved of time. 
       - I swear I am for those that have never been  
     mastered! 
  - For men and women whose tempers have never  
     been mastered, 
  - For those whom laws, theories, conventions, can  
     never master. 
       - I swear I am for those who walk abreast with  
     America and with the earth! 
  - Who inaugurate one to inaugurate all. 
       - I swear I will not be outfaced by irrational things! 
  - I will penetrate what it is in them that is sarcastic  
     upon me! 
  - I will make cities and civilizations defer to me! 
  - I will confront these shows of the day and night! 
  - I will know if I am to be less than they! 
  - I will see if I am not as majestic as they! 
       - I will see if I am not as subtle and real as they! 
  - I will see if I am to be less generous than they! 
  - I will see if I have no meaning, and the houses  
     and ships have meaning! 
  - I will see if the fishes and birds are to be enough  
     for themselves, and I am not to be enough for  
     myself! 
       - I match my spirit against yours, you orbs, growths,  
     mountains, brutes, 
  - I will learn why the earth is gross, tantalizing,  
     wicked, 
  - I take you to be mine, you beautiful, terrible, rude  
     forms. 
            
## 9 — Poem of Wonder at The Resurrection of The Wheat. 

     - SOMETHING startles me where I thought I  
     was safest, 
  - I withdraw from the still woods I loved, 
  - I will not go now on the pastures to walk, 
  - I will not strip my clothes from my body to meet  
     my lover the sea, 
  - I will not touch my flesh to the earth, as to other  
     flesh, to renew me. 
       - How can the ground not sicken of men? 
  - How can you be alive, you growths of spring? 
  - How can you furnish health, you blood of herbs,  
     roots, orchards, grain? 
  - Are they not continually putting distempered  
     corpses in the earth? 
  - Is not every continent worked over and over with  
     sour dead? 
  - Where have you disposed of those carcasses of  
     the drunkards and gluttons of so many gen-
     erations? 
            - Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and  
     meat? 
  - I do not see any of it upon you today — or per-
     haps I am deceived, 
  - I will run a furrow with my plough — I will press  
     my spade through the sod, and turn it up  
     underneath, 
  - I am sure I shall expose some of the foul meat. 
       - Behold! 
  - This is the compost of billions of premature  
     corpses, 
  - Perhaps every mite has once formed part of a  
     sick person, 
  - Yet Behold! 
  - The grass covers the prairies, 
  - The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in  
     the garden, 
  - The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward, 
  - The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-
     branches, 
  - The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale  
     visage out of its graves, 
  - The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the  
     mulberry-tree, 
  - The he-birds carol mornings and evenings, while  
     the she-birds sit on their nests, 
  - The young of poultry break through the hatched  
     eggs, 
       - The new-born of animals appear, the calf is  
     dropt from the cow, the colt from the mare, 
  - Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato's  
     dark green leaves, 
  - Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk; 
  - The summer growth is innocent and disdainful  
     above all those strata of sour dead. 
       - What chemistry! 
  - That the winds are really not infectious! 
  - That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash  
     of the sea, which is so amorous after me! 
  - That it is safe to allow it to lick my naked  
     body all over with its tongues! 
  - That it will not endanger me with the fevers that  
     have deposited themselves in it! 
  - That all is clean, forever and forever! 
  - That the cool drink from the well tastes so good! 
  - That blackberries are so flavorous and juicy! 
  - That the fruits of the apple-orchard, and of the  
     orange-orchard — that melons, grapes, peaches,  
     plums, will none of them poison me! 
  - That when I recline on the grass I do not catch  
     any disease! 
  - Though probably every spear of grass rises out  
     of what was once a catching disease. 
       - Now I am terrified at the earth! it is that calm  
     and patient, 
       - It grows such sweet things out of such corrup-
     tions, 
  - It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with  
     such endless successions of diseased corpses, 
  - It distils such exquisite winds out of such infused  
     fetor, 
  - It renews with such unwitting looks, its prodigal,  
     annual, sumptuous crops, 
  - It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts  
     such leavings from them at last. 
             
## 10 — Poem of You, Whoever You Are. 

     - WHOEVER you are, I fear you are walking  
     the walks of dreams, 
  - I fear those realities are to melt from under your  
     feet and hands; 
  - Even now, your features, joys, speech, house,  
     trade, manners, troubles, follies, costume,  
     crimes, dissipate away from you, 
  - Your true soul and body appear before me, 
  - They stand forth out of affairs — out of commerce,  
     shops, law, science, work, farms, clothes, the  
     house, medicine, print, buying, selling, eating,  
     drinking, suffering, begetting, dying, 
  - They receive these in their places, they find these  
     or the like of these, eternal, for reasons, 
  - They find themselves eternal, they do not find that  
     the water and soil tend to endure forever —  
     and they not endure. 
       - Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you,  
     that you be my poem, 
  - I whisper with my lips close to your ear, 
       - I have loved many women and men, but I love  
     none better than you. 
       - O I have been dilatory and dumb, 
  - I should have made my way straight to you long  
     ago, 
  - I should have blabbed nothing but you, I should  
     have chanted nothing but you. 
       - I will leave all, and come and make the hymns  
     of you; 
  - None have understood you, but I understand you, 
  - None have done justice to you, you have not done  
     justice to yourself, 
  - None but have found you imperfect, I only find no  
     imperfection in you, 
  - None but would subordinate you, I only am he  
     who will never consent to subordinate you, 
  - I only am he who places over you no master,  
     owner, better, god, beyond what waits intrin-
     sically in yourself. 
       - Painters have painted their swarming groups, and  
     the centre figure of all, 
  - From the head of the centre figure spreading a  
     nimbus of gold-colored light, 
  - But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head  
     without its nimbus of gold-colored light, 
  - From my hand, from the brain of every man and  
     woman it streams, effulgently flowing forever. 
            - O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about  
     you! 
  - You have not known what you are — you have  
     slumbered upon yourself all your life, 
  - Your eye-lids have been as much as closed most  
     of the time, 
  - What you have done returns already in mock-
     eries, 
  - Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not  
     return in mockeries, what is their return? 
       - The mockeries are not you, 
  - Underneath them, and within them, I see you lurk, 
  - I pursue you where none else has pursued you, 
  - Silence, the desk, the flippant expression, the  
     night, the accustomed routine, if these con-
     ceal you from others, or from yourself, they  
     do not conceal you from me, 
  - The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure  
     complexion, if these balk others, they do  
     not balk me, 
  - The pert apparel, the deformed attitude, drunken-
     ness, greed, premature death, all these I part  
     aside, 
  - I track through your windings and turnings — I  
     come upon you where you thought eye should  
     never come upon you. 
       - There is no endowment in man or woman that is  
     not tallied in you, 
       - There is no virtue, no beauty, in man or woman  
     but as good is in you, 
  - No pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is  
     in you, 
  - No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal plea-
     sure waits for you. 
       - As for me, I give nothing to any one, except I  
     give the like carefully to you, 
  - I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God,  
     sooner than I sing the songs of the glory of  
     you. 
       - Whoever you are, you are to hold your own at  
     any hazard, 
  - These shows of the east and west are tame com-
     pared to you, 
  - These immense meadows, these interminable riv-
     ers — you are immense and interminable as  
     they, 
  - These furies, elements, storms, motions of nature,  
     throes of apparent dissolution — you are he  
     or she who is master or mistress over them, 
  - Master or mistress in your own right over nature,  
     elements, pain, passion, dissolution. 
       - The hopples fall from your ankles! you find an  
     unfailing sufficiency! 
            - Old, young, male, female, rude, low, rejected by  
     the rest, whatever you are promulges itself, 
  - Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are  
     provided, nothing is scanted, 
  - Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance,  
     ennui, what you are picks its way. 
             
## 11 — Sun-Down Poem. 

     - FLOOD-TIDE of the river, flow on! I watch  
     you, face to face, 
  - Clouds of the west! sun half an hour high! I see  
     you also face to face. 
       - Crowds of men and women attired in the usual  
     costumes, how curious you are to me! 
  - On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds  
     that cross are more curious to me than you  
     suppose, 
  - And you that shall cross from shore to shore  
     years hence, are more to me, and more in my  
     meditations, than you might suppose. 
       - The impalpable sustenance of me from all things  
     at all hours of the day, 
  - The simple, compact, well-joined scheme — my-
     self disintegrated, every one disintegrated,  
     yet part of the scheme, 
  - The similitudes of the past and those of the  
     future, 
       - The glories strung like beads on my smallest  
     sights and hearings — on the walk in the  
     street, and the passage over the river, 
  - The current rushing so swiftly, and swimming  
     with me far away, 
  - The others that are to follow me, the ties between  
     me and them, 
  - The certainty of others — the life, love, sight,  
     hearing of others. 
       - Others will enter the gates of the ferry, and cross  
     from shore to shore, 
  - Others will watch the run of the flood-tide, 
  - Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north  
     and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the  
     south and east, 
  - Others will see the islands large and small, 
  - Fifty years hence others will see them as they  
     cross, the sun half an hour high, 
  - A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred  
     years hence, others will see them, 
  - Will enjoy the sun-set, the pouring in of the flood-
     tide, the falling back to the sea of the ebb-
     tide. 
       - It avails not, neither time or place — distance  
     avails not, 
  - I am with you, you men and women of a genera-
     tion, or ever so many generations hence, 
       - I project myself, also I return — I am with you,  
     and know how it is. 
       - Just as you feel when you look on the river and  
     sky, so I felt, 
  - Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was  
     one of a crowd, 
  - Just as you are refreshed by the gladness  
     of the river, and the bright flow, I was  
     refreshed, 
  - Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry  
     with the swift current, I stood, yet was hur-
     ried, 
  - Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships,  
     and the thick-stemmed pipes of steamboats, I  
     looked. 
       - I too many and many a time crossed the river,  
     the sun half an hour high, 
  - I watched the December sea-gulls, I saw them  
     high in the air floating with motionless  
     wings oscillating their bodies, 
  - I saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of  
     their bodies, and left the rest in strong  
     shadow, 
  - I saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual  
     edging toward the south. 
       - I too saw the reflection of the summer-sky in the  
     water. 
            - Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of  
     beams, 
  - Looked at the fine centrifugal spokes of light  
     round the shape of my head in the sun-lit  
     water, 
  - Looked on the haze on the hills southward and  
     southwestward, 
  - Looked on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged  
     with violet, 
  - Looked toward the lower bay to notice the arriv-
     ing ships, 
  - Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were  
     near me, 
  - Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw  
     the ships at anchor, 
  - The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride  
     the spars, 
  - The round masts, the swinging motion of the  
     hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, 
  - The large and small steamers in motion, the pi-
     lots in their pilot-houses, 
  - The white wake left by the passage, the quick  
     tremulous whirl of the wheels, 
  - The flags of all nations, the falling of them at  
     sun-set, 
  - The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the  
     ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glisten-
     ing, 
       - The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the  
     gray walls of the granite store-houses by the  
     docks, 
  - On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-
     tug closely flanked on each side by the  
     barges — the hay-boat, the belated lighter, 
  - On the neighboring shore the fires from the foun-
     dry chimneys burning high and glaringly into  
     the night, 
  - Casting their flicker of black, contrasted with wild  
     red and yellow light, over the tops of houses,  
     and down into the clefts of streets. 
       - These and all else were to me the same as they  
     are to you, 
  - I project myself a moment to tell you — also I  
     return. 
       - I loved well those cities, 
  - I loved well the stately and rapid river, 
  - The men and women I saw were all near to me, 
  - Others the same — others who look back on me,  
     because I looked forward to them, 
  - The time will come, though I stop here today and  
     tonight. 
       - What is it, then, between us? What is the  
     count of the scores or hundreds of years  
     between us? 
            - Whatever it is, it avails not — distance avails not,  
     and place avails not. 
       - I too lived, 
  - I too walked the streets of Manhattan Island, and  
     bathed in the waters around it; 
  - I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir with-
     in me, 
  - In the day, among crowds of people, sometimes  
     they came upon me, 
  - In my walks home late at night, or as I lay in my  
     bed, they came upon me. 
       - I too had been struck from the float forever held  
     in solution, 
  - I too had received identity by my body, 
  - That I was, I knew was of my body, and what I  
     should be, I knew I should be of my body. 
       - It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, 
  - The dark threw patches down upon me also, 
  - The best I had done seemed to me blank and sus-
     picious, 
  - My great thoughts, as I supposed them, were they  
     not in reality meagre? Would not people  
     laugh at me? 
       - It is not you alone who know what it is to be  
     evil, 
       - I am he who knew what it was to be evil, 
  - I too knitted the old knot of contrariety, 
  - Blabbed, blushed, resented, lied, stole, grudged, 
  - Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not  
     speak, 
  - Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, a solitary  
     committer, a coward, a malignant person, 
  - The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, 
  - The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adul-
     terous wish, not wanting, 
  - Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, lazi-
     ness, none of these wanting. 
       - But I was a Manhattanese, free, friendly, and  
     proud! 
  - I was called by my nighest name by clear loud  
     voices of young men as they saw me ap-
     proaching or passing, 
  - Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the neg-
     ligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat, 
  - Saw many I loved in the street, or ferry-boat, or  
     public assembly, yet never told them a word, 
  - Lived the same life with the rest, the same old  
     laughing, gnawing, sleeping, 
  - Played the part that still looks back on the actor  
     or actress, 
  - The same old role, the role that is what we make  
     it, as great as we like, or as small as we  
     like, or both great and small. 
              - Closer yet I approach you, 
  - What thought you have of me, I had as much of  
     you — I laid in my stores in advance, 
  - I considered long and seriously of you before you  
     were born. 
       - Who was to know what should come home to me? 
  - Who knows but I am enjoying this? 
  - Who knows but I am as good as looking at you  
     now, for all you cannot see me? 
       - It is not you alone, nor I alone, 
  - Not a few races, not a few generations, not a few  
     centuries, 
  - It is that each came, or comes, or shall come,  
     from its due emission, without fail, either  
     now, or then, or henceforth. 
       - Every thing indicates — the smallest does, and  
     the largest does, 
  - A necessary film envelops all, and envelops the  
     soul for a proper time. 
       - Now I am curious what sight can ever be more  
     stately and admirable to me than my mast-
     hemm'd Manhatta, my river and sun-set, and  
     my scallop-edged waves of flood-tide, the  
     sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat  
     in the twilight, and the belated lighter, 
       - Curious what gods can exceed these that clasp  
     me by the hand, and with voices I love call  
     me promptly and loudly by my nighest name  
     as I approach, 
  - Curious what is more subtle than this which ties  
     me to the woman or man that looks in my  
     face, 
  - Which fuses me into you now, and pours my  
     meaning into you. 
       - We understand, then, do we not? 
  - What I promised without mentioning it, have  
     you not accepted? 
  - What the study could not teach — what the  
     preaching could not accomplish is accom-
     plished, is it not? 
  - What the push of reading could not start is  
     started by me personally, is it not? 
       - Flow on, river! Flow with the flood-tide, and  
     ebb with the ebb-tide! 
  - Frolic on, crested and scallop-edged waves! 
  - Gorgeous clouds of the sun-set, drench with your  
     splendor me, or the men and women genera-
     tions after me! 
  - Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of  
     passengers! 
  - Stand up, tall masts of Manahatta! — stand up,  
     beautiful hills of Brooklyn! 
            - Bully for you! you proud, friendly, free Manhat-
     tanese! 
  - Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out ques-
     tions and answers! 
  - Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of  
     solution! 
  - Blab, blush, lie, steal, you or I or any one after  
     us! 
  - Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or  
     street or public assembly! 
  - Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and mu-
     sically call me by my nighest name! 
  - Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the  
     actor or actress! 
  - Play the old role, the role that is great or small,  
     according as one makes it! 
  - Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may  
     not in unknown ways be looking upon you! 
  - Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who  
     lean idly, yet haste with the hasting cur-
     rent! 
  - Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large  
     circles high in the air! 
  - Receive the summer-sky, you water! faithfully  
     hold it till all downcast eyes have time to  
     take it from you! 
  - Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of  
     my head, or any one's head, in the sun-lit  
     water! 
            - Come on, ships, from the lower bay! pass up  
     or down, white-sailed schooners, sloops,  
     lighters! 
  - Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lowered  
     at sun-set! 
  - Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast  
     black shadows at night-fall! cast red and  
     yellow light over the tops of the houses! 
  - Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what  
     you are! 
  - You necessary film, continue to envelop the  
     soul! 
  - About my body for me, and your body for you, be  
     hung our divinest aromas! 
  - Thrive, cities! Bring your freight, bring your  
     shows, ample and sufficient rivers! 
  - Expand, being than which none else is perhaps  
     more spiritual! 
  - Keep your places, objects than which none else is  
     more lasting! 
       - We descend upon you and all things, we arrest  
     you all, 
  - We realize the soul only by you, you faithful solids  
     and fluids, 
  - Through you color, form, location, sublimity,  
     ideality, 
  - Through you every proof, comparison, and all the  
     suggestions and determinations of ourselves. 
            - You have waited, you always wait, you dumb  
     beautiful ministers! you novices! 
  - We receive you with free sense at last, and are  
     insatiate henceforward, 
  - Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or with-
     hold yourselves from us, 
  - We use you, and do not cast you aside — we  
     plant you permanently within us, 
  - We fathom you not — we love you — there is  
     perfection in you also, 
  - You furnish your parts toward eternity, 
  - Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the  
     soul. 
          
## 12 — Poem of The Road. 

     - A FOOT and light-hearted I take to the open  
     road! 
  - Healthy, free, the world before me! 
  - The long brown path before me, leading wherever  
     I choose! 
       - Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I am good-
     fortune, 
  - Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more,  
     need nothing, 
  - Strong and content, I travel the open road. 
       - The earth — that is sufficient, 
  - I do not want the constellations any nearer, 
  - I know they are very well where they are, 
  - I know they suffice for those who belong to them. 
       - Still here I carry my old delicious burdens, 
  - I carry them, men and women — I carry them  
     with me wherever I go, 
  - I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them, 
  - I am filled with them, and I will fill them in  
     return. 
            - You road I travel and look around! I believe you  
     are not all that is here! 
  - I believe that something unseen is also here. 
       - Here is the profound lesson of reception, neither  
     preference or denial, 
  - The black with his woolly head, the felon, the  
     diseased, the illiterate person, are not de-
     nied, 
  - The birth, the hasting after the physician, the  
     beggar's tramp, the drunkard's stagger, the  
     laughing party of mechanics, 
  - The escaped youth, the rich person's carriage, the  
     fop, the eloping couple, 
  - The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of  
     furniture into the town, the return back from  
     the town, 
  - They pass, I also pass, any thing passes, none can  
     be interdicted, 
  - None but are accepted, none but are dear to me. 
       - You air that serves me with breath to speak! 
  - You objects that call from diffusion my meanings  
     and give them shape! 
  - You light that wraps me and all things in delicate  
     equable showers! 
  - You animals moving serenely over the earth! 
  - You birds that wing yourselves through the air!  
     you insects! 
            - You sprouting growths from the farmers' fields!  
     you stalks and weeds by the fences! 
  - You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the  
     road-sides! 
  - I think you are latent with curious existences —  
     you are so dear to me. 
       - You flagged walks of the cities! you strong curbs  
     at the edges! 
  - You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves!  
     you timber-lined sides! you distant ships! 
  - You rows of houses! you window-pierced facades!  
     you roofs! 
  - You porches and entrances! you copings and iron  
     guards! 
  - You windows whose transparent shells might  
     expose so much! 
  - You doors and ascending steps! you arches! 
  - You gray stones of interminable pavements! you  
     trodden crossings! 
  - From all that has been near you I believe you  
     have imparted to yourselves, and now would  
     impart the same secretly to me, 
  - From the living and the dead I think you have  
     peopled your impassive surfaces, and the  
     spirits thereof would be evident and ami-
     cable with me. 
       - The earth expanding right hand and left hand, 
         - The picture alive, every part in its best light, 
  - The music falling in where it is wanted, and  
     stopping where it is not wanted, 
  - The cheerful voice of the public road — the gay  
     fresh sentiment of the road. 
       - O highway I travel! O public road! do you say  
     to me, Do not leave me? 
  - Do you say, Venture not? If you leave me, you  
     are lost? 
  - Do you say, I am already prepared — I am well-
     beaten and undenied — Adhere to me? 
       - O public road! I say back, I am not afraid to  
     leave you — yet I love you, 
  - You express me better than I can express myself, 
  - You shall be more to me than my poem. 
       - I think heroic deeds were all conceived in the  
     open air, 
  - I think I could stop here myself, and do miracles, 
  - I think whatever I meet on the road I shall like,  
     and whatever beholds me shall like me, 
  - I think whoever I see must be happy. 
       - From this hour, freedom! 
  - From this hour, I ordain myself loosed of limits  
     and imaginary lines! 
  - Going where I list — my own master, total and  
     absolute, 
       - Listening to others, and considering well what  
     they say, 
  - Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating, 
  - Gently but with undeniable will divesting myself  
     of the holds that would hold me. 
       - I inhale great draughts of air, 
  - The east and the west are mine, and the north  
     and the south are mine. 
       - I am larger than I thought! 
  - I did not know I held so much goodness! 
       - All seems beautiful to me, 
  - I can repeat over to men and women, You have  
     done such good to me, I would do the same  
     to you. 
       - I will recruit for myself and you as I go, 
  - I will scatter myself among men and women as  
     I go, 
  - I will toss the new gladness and roughness among  
      
  - Whoever denies me, it shall not trouble me, 
  - Whoever accepts me, he or she shall be blessed,  
     and shall bless me. 
       - Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear,  
     it would not amaze me, 
       - Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women ap-
     peared, it would not astonish me. 
       - Now I see the secret of the making of the best  
     persons, 
  - It is to grow in the open air, and to eat and  
     sleep with the earth. 
       - Here is space — here a great personal deed has  
     room, 
  - A great deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole  
     race of men, 
  - Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law,  
     and mocks all authority and all argument  
     against it. 
       - Here is the test of wisdom, 
  - Wisdom is not finally tested in schools, 
  - Wisdom cannot be passed from one having it, to  
     another not having it, 
  - Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof,  
     is its own proof, 
  - Applies to all stages and objects and qualities, and  
     is content, 
  - Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of  
     things, and the excellence of things, 
  - Something there is in the float of the sight of  
     things that provokes it out of the soul. 
            - Now I re-examine philosophics and religions, 
  - They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not  
     prove at all under the spacious clouds, and  
     along the landscape and flowing currents. 
       - Here is realization, 
  - Here is a man tallied — he realizes here what he  
     has in him, 
  - The animals, the past, the future, light, space,  
     majesty, love, if they are vacant of you, you  
     are vacant of them. 
       - Only the kernel of every object nourishes; 
  - Where is he who tears off the husks for you and  
     me? 
  - Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes  
     for you and me? 
       - Here is adhesiveness — it is not previously  
     fashioned, it is apropos; 
  - Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved  
     by strangers? 
  - Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls? 
       - Here is the efflux of the soul, 
  - The efflux of the soul comes through beautiful  
     gates of laws, provoking questions, 
  - These yearnings, why are they? these thoughts  
     in the darkness, why are they? 
            - Why are there men and women that while they  
     are nigh me the sun-light expands my blood? 
  - Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy  
     sink flat and lank? 
  - Why are there trees I never walk under but large  
     and melodious thoughts descend upon me? 
  - (I think they hang there winter and summer on  
     those trees, and always drop fruit as I pass;) 
  - What is it I interchange so suddenly with stran-
     gers? 
  - What with some driver as I ride on the seat by  
     his side? 
  - What with some fisherman, drawing his seine by  
     the shore, as I walk by and pause? 
  - What gives me to be free to a woman's or man's  
     good-will? What gives them to be free to  
     mine? 
       - The efflux of the soul is happiness — here is  
     happiness, 
  - I think it pervades the air, waiting at all times, 
  - Now it flows into us — we are rightly charged. 
       - Here rises the fluid and attaching character; 
  - The fluid and attaching character is the freshness  
     and sweetness of man and woman, 
  - The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and  
     sweeter every day out of the roots of them-
     selves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet contin-
     ually out of itself. 
            - Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes  
     the sweat of the love of young and old, 
  - From it falls distilled the charm that mocks beauty  
     and attainments, 
  - Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of  
     contact. 
       - Allons! Whoever you are, come travel with  
     me! 
  - Traveling with me, you find what never tires. 
       - The earth never tires! 
  - The earth is rude, silent, incomprehensible at  
     first — nature is rude and incomprehensible  
     at first, 
  - Be not discouraged — keep on — there are divine  
     things, well enveloped, 
  - I swear to you there are divine things more beau-
     tiful than words can tell! 
       - Allons! We must not stop here! 
  - However sweet these laid-up stores, however  
     convenient this dwelling, we cannot remain  
     here! 
  - However sheltered this port, however calm these  
     waters, we must not anchor here! 
  - However welcome the hospitality that surrounds  
     us, we are permitted to receive it but a little  
     while. 
            - Allons! the inducements shall be great to you, 
  - We will sail pathless and wild seas, 
  - We will go where winds blow, waves dash,  
     and the Yankee clipper speeds by under full  
     sail. 
       - Allons! With power, liberty, the earth, the  
     elements! 
  - Health, defiance, gaiety, self-esteem, curiosity! 
       - Allons! From all formulas! 
  - From your formulas, O bat-eyed and materialistic  
     priests! 
       - The stale cadaver blocks up the passage — the  
     burial waits no longer. 
       - Allons! Yet take warning! 
  - He traveling with me needs the best blood, thews,  
     endurance, 
  - None may come to the trial till he or she bring  
     courage and health. 
       - Come not here if you have already spent the best  
     of yourself! 
  - Only those may come who come in sweet and  
     determined bodies, 
  - No diseased person — no rum-drinker or venereal  
     taint is permitted here, 
       - I and mine do not convince by arguments,  
     similes, rhymes, 
  - We convince by our presence. 
       - Listen! I will be honest with you, 
  - I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer  
     rough new prizes, 
  - These are the days that must happen to you: 
  - You shall not heap up what is called riches, 
  - You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you  
     earn or achieve, 
  - You but arrive at the city to which you were  
     destined — you hardly settle yourself to satis-
     faction, before you are called by an irresistible  
     call to depart, 
  - You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and  
     mockings of those who remain behind you, 
  - What beckonings of love you receive, you shall  
     only answer with passionate kisses of parting, 
  - You shall not allow the hold of those who spread  
     their reached hands toward you. 
       - Allons! After the great companions! and to be-
     long to them! 
  - They too are on the road! they are the swift and  
     majestic men! they are the greatest women! 
       - Over that which hindered them, over that which  
     retarded, passing impediments large or small, 
       - Committers of crimes, committers of many beauti-
     ful virtues, 
  - Enjoyers of calms of seas, and storms of seas, 
  - Sailors of many a ship, walkers of many a mile of  
     land, 
  - Habitues of many different countries, habitues of  
     far-distant dwellings, 
  - Trusters of men and women, observers of cities,  
     solitary toilers, 
  - Pausers and contemplaters of tufts, blossoms, shells  
     of the shore, 
  - Dancers at wedding-dances, kissers of brides,  
     tender helpers of children, bearers of children, 
  - Soldiers of revolts, standers by gaping graves,  
     lowerers down of coffins, 
  - Journeyers over consecutive seasons, over the  
     years — the curious years, each emerging  
     from that which preceded it, 
  - Journeyers as with companions, namely, their own  
     diverse phases, 
  - Forth-steppers from the latent unrealized baby-
     days, 
  - Journeyers gaily with their own youth — journey-
     ers with their bearded and well-grained  
     manhood, 
  - Journeyers with their womanhood, ample, unsur-
     passed, content, 
  - Journeyers with their sublime old age of manhood  
     or womanhood, 
    - Old age, calm, expanded, broad with the haughty  
     breadth of the universe, 
  - Old age, flowing free with the delicious near-by  
     freedom of death. 
       - Allons! to that which is endless as it was  
     beginningless! 
  - To undergo much, tramps of days, rests of nights! 
  - To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the  
     days and nights they tend to! 
  - Again to merge them in the start of superior  
     journeys! 
  - To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach  
     it and pass it! 
  - To conceive no time, however distant, but what  
     you may reach it and pass it! 
  - To look up or down no road but it stretches and  
     waits for you! however long, but it stretches  
     and waits for you! 
  - To see no being, not God's or any, but you also  
     go thither! 
  - To see no possession but you may possess it!  
     enjoying all without labor or purchase —  
     abstracting the feast, yet not abstracting one  
     particle of it; 
  - To take the best of the farmer's farm and the rich  
     man's elegant villa, and the chaste blessings  
     of the well-married couple, and the fruits of  
     orchards and flowers of gardens! 
            - To take to your use out of the compact cities as  
     you pass through! 
  - To carry buildings and streets with you afterward  
     wherever you go! 
  - To gather the minds of men out of their brains as  
     you encounter them! to gather the love out  
     of their hearts! 
  - To take your own lovers on the road with  
     you, for all that you leave them behind  
     you! 
  - To know the universe itself as a road — as many  
     roads — as roads for traveling souls! 
       - The soul travels, 
  - The body does not travel as much as the soul, 
  - The body has just as great a work as the soul,  
     and parts away at last for the journeys of the  
     soul. 
       - All parts away for the progress of souls, 
  - All religion, all solid things, arts, governments —  
     all that was or is apparent upon this globe or  
     any globe, falls into niches and corners before  
     the processions of souls along the grand roads  
     of the universe, 
  - Of the progress of the souls of men and women  
     along the grand roads of the universe, all  
     other progress is the needed emblem and  
     sustenance. 
            - Forever alive, forever forward, 
  - Stately, solemn, sad, withdrawn, baffled, mad,  
     turbulent, feeble, dissatisfied, 
  - Desperate, proud, fond, sick, accepted by men,  
     rejected by men, 
  - They go! they go! I know that they go, but I  
     know not where they go, 
  - But I know that they go toward the best — 
  - toward something great. 
       - Allons! Whoever you are! come forth! 
  - You must not stay in your house, though you built  
     it, or though it has been built for you. 
       - Allons! out of the dark confinement! 
  - It is useless to protest — I know all, and expose it. 
       - Behold through you as bad as the rest! 
  - Through the laughter, dancing, dining, supping, of  
     people, 
  - Inside of dresses and ornaments, inside of those  
     washed and trimmed faces, 
  - Behold a secret silent loathing and despair! 
       - No husband, no wife, no friend, no lover, so  
     trusted as to hear the confession, 
  - Another self, a duplicate of every one, skulking and  
     hiding it goes, open and above-board it goes, 
  - Formless and wordless through the streets of the  
     cities, polite and bland in the parlors, 
       - In the cars of rail-roads, in steam-boats, in the  
     public assembly, 
  - Home to the houses of men and women, among  
     their families, at the table, in the bed-room,  
     every where, 
  - Smartly attired, countenance smiling, form upright,  
     death under the breast-bones, hell under the  
     skull-bones, 
  - Under the broad-cloth and gloves, under the  
     ribbons and artificial flowers, 
  - Keeping fair with the customs, speaking not a  
     syllable of itself, 
  - Speaking of anything else, but never of itself. 
       - Allons! through struggles and wars! 
  - The goal that was named cannot be counter-
     manded. 
  - Have the past struggles succeeded? 
  - What has succeeded? Yourself? Your nation?  
     Nature? 
  - Now understand me well — it is provided in the  
     essence of things, that from any fruition of  
     success, no matter what, shall come forth  
     something to make a greater struggle neces-
     sary. 
       - My call is the call of battle — I nourish active  
     rebellion, 
       - He going with me must go well armed, 
  - He going with me goes often with spare diet,  
     poverty, angry enemies, contentions. 
       - Allons! the road is before us! 
  - It is safe — I have tried it — my own feet have  
     tried it well. 
       - Allons! be not detained! 
  - Let the paper remain on the desk unwritten, and  
     the book on the shelf unopened! 
  - Let the tools remain in the work-shop! let the  
     money remain unearned! 
  - Let the school stand! mind not the cry of the  
     teacher! 
  - Let the preacher preach in his pulpit! let the  
     lawyer plead in the court, and the judge  
     expound the law! 
       - Mon enfant! I give you my hand! 
  - I give you my love, more precious than money, 
  - I give you myself, before preaching or law; 
  - Will you give me yourself? Will you come  
     travel with me? 
  - Shall we stick by each other as long as we live? 
             
## 13 — Poem of Procreation. 

     - A WOMAN waits for me — she contains all,  
     nothing is lacking, 
  - Yet all were lacking, if sex were lacking, or if  
     the moisture of the right man were lacking. 
       - Sex contains all, 
  - Bodies, souls, meanings, proofs, purities, delica-
     cies, results, promulgations, 
  - Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal  
     mystery, the semitic milk, 
  - All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, 
  - All the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the  
     earth, 
  - All the governments, judges, gods, followed per-
     sons of the earth, 
  - These are contained in sex, as parts of itself  
     and justifications of itself. 
       - Without shame the man I like knows and avows  
     the deliciousness of his sex, 
  - Without shame the woman I like knows and  
     avows hers. 
            - O I will fetch bully breeds of children yet! 
  - They cannot be fetched, I say, on less terms than  
     mine, 
  - Electric growth from the male, and rich ripe fibre  
     from the female, are the terms. 
       - I will dismiss myself from impassive women, 
  - I will go stay with her who waits for me, and  
     with those women that are warm-blooded and  
     sufficient for me, 
  - I see that they understand me, and do not deny  
     me, 
  - I see that they are worthy of me — so I will be  
     the robust husband of those women! 
  - They are not one jot less than I am, 
  - They are tanned in the face by shining suns and  
     blowing winds, 
  - Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and  
     strength, 
  - They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle,  
     shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist,  
     defend themselves, 
  - They are ultimate in their own right — they are  
     calm, clear, well-possessed of themselves. 
       - I draw you close to me, you women! 
  - I cannot let you go, I would do you good, 
  - I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our  
     own sake, but for others' sakes, 
         - Enveloped in you sleep greater heroes and bards, 
  - They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but  
     me. 
       - It is I, you women — I make my way, 
  - I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable — but I  
     love you, 
  - I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for  
     you, 
  - I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for  
     These States — I press with slow rude muscle, 
  - I brace myself effectually — I listen to no en-
     treaties, 
  - I dare not withdraw till I deposite what has so  
     long accumulated within me. 
       - Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself, 
  - In you I wrap a thousand onward years, 
  - On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of  
     me and of America, 
  - The drops I distil upon you are drops of fierce  
     and athletic girls, and of new artists, musi-
     cians, singers, 
  - The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in  
     their turn, 
  - I shall demand perfect men and women out of my  
     love-spendings, 
  - I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others,  
     as I and you interpenetrate now, 
       - I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers  
     of them, as I count on the fruits of the gush-
     ing showers I give now, 
  - I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life,  
     death, immortality I plant so lovingly now. 
               
## 14 — Poem of The Poet. 

     - A YOUNG man came to me with a message  
     from his brother, 
  - How should the young man know the whether and  
     when of his brother? 
  - Tell him to send me the signs. 
       - And I stood before the young man face to face,  
     and took his right hand in my left hand, and  
     his left hand in my right hand, 
  - And I answered for his brother, and for men, and  
     I answered for the poet, and sent these signs. 
       - Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is  
     decisive and final, 
  - Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive  
     themselves, as amid light, 
  - Him they immerse, and he immerses them. 
       - Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the  
     landscape, people, animals, 
  - The profound earth and its attributes, and the un-
     quiet ocean, 
       - All enjoyments and properties, and money, and  
     whatever money will buy, 
  - The best farms, others toiling and planting, and  
     he unavoidably reaps, 
  - The noblest and costliest cities, others grading  
     and building, and he domiciles there, 
  - Nothing for any one, but what is for him — near  
     and far are for him, 
  - The ships in the offing, the perpetual shows and  
     marches on land, are for him, if they are for  
     any body. 
       - He puts things in their attitudes, 
  - He puts today out of himself, with plasticity and  
     love, 
  - He places his own city, times, reminiscences,  
     parents, brothers and sisters, associations,  
     employment, politics, so that the rest never  
     shame them afterward, nor assume to com-
     mand them. 
       - He is the answerer, 
  - What can be answered he answers, and what  
     cannot be answered, he shows how it cannot  
     be answered. 
       - A man is a summons and challenge; 
  - It is vain to skulk — Do you hear that mocking  
     and laughter? Do you hear the ironical  
     echoes? 
            - Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action,  
     pleasure, pride, beat up and down, seeking to  
     give satisfaction, 
  - He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them  
     that beat up and down also. 
       - Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place,  
     he may go freshly and gently and safely, by  
     day or by night, 
  - He has the pass-key of hearts — to him the  
     response of the prying of hands on the  
     knobs. 
       - His welcome is universal — the flow of beauty is  
     not more welcome or universal than he is, 
  - The person he favors by day or sleeps with at  
     night is blessed. 
       - Every existence has its idiom, every thing has an  
     idiom and tongue, 
  - He resolves all tongues into his own, and bestows  
     it upon men, and any man translates, and any  
     man translates himself also, 
  - One part does not counteract another part — he is  
     the joiner, he sees how they join. 
       - He says indifferently and alike, How are you,  
     friend? to the President at his levee, 
  - And he says, Good-day, my brother! to Cudge that  
     hoes in the sugar-field, 
       - And both understand him, and know that his  
     speech is right. 
       - He walks with perfect ease in the capitol, 
  - He walks among the Congress, and one represen-
     tative says to another, Here is our equal  
     appearing and new. 
       - Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic, 
  - And the soldiers suppose him to be a captain, and  
     the sailors that he has followed the sea, 
  - And the authors take him for an author, and the  
     artists for an artist, 
  - And the laborers perceive he could labor with  
     them and love them. 
  - No matter what the work is, that he is the one to  
     follow it, or has followed it, 
  - No matter what the nation, that he might find his  
     brothers and sisters there. 
       - The English believe he comes of their English  
     stock, 
  - A Jew to the Jew he seems — a Russ to the Russ  
      — usual and near, removed from none. 
       - Whoever he looks at in the traveler's coffee-
     house claims him, 
  - The Italian or Frenchman is sure, and the  
     German is sure, and the Spaniard is sure,  
     and the island Cuban is sure. 
            - The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes,  
     or on the Mississippi, or St. Lawrence, or  
     Sacramento, or Hudson, or Delaware, claims  
     him. 
       - The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his  
     perfect blood, 
  - The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the  
     beggar, see themselves in the ways of him —  
     he strangely transmutes them, 
  - They are not vile any more — they hardly know  
     themselves, they are so grown. 
       - Do you think it would be good to be the writer  
     of melodious verses? 
  - Well, it would be good to be the writer of  
     melodious verses; 
  - But what are verses beyond the flowing char-
     acter you could have? or beyond beautiful  
     manners and behaviour? 
  - Or beyond one manly or affectionate deed of an  
     apprentice-boy? or old woman? or man that  
     has been in prison, or is likely to be in  
     prison? 
            
## 15 — Clef Poem. 

     - THIS night I am happy,  
     As I watch the stars shining, I think a  
     thought of the clef of the universes, and  
     of the future. 
       - What can the future bring me more than I have? 
  - Do you suppose I wish to enjoy life in other  
     spheres? 
  - I say distinctly I comprehend no better sphere  
     than this earth, 
  - I comprehend no better life than the life of my  
     body. 
    - I do not know what follows the death of my body, 
  - But I know well that whatever it is, it is best for  
     me, 
  - And I know well that what is really Me shall live  
     just as much as before. 
       - I am not uneasy but I shall have good housing to  
     myself, 
         - But this is my first — how can I like the rest any  
     better? 
  - Here I grew up — the studs and rafters are grown  
     parts of me. 
       - I am not uneasy but I am to be beloved by young  
     and old men, and to love them the same, 
  - I suppose the pink nipples of the breasts of women  
     with whom I shall sleep will taste the same  
     to my lips, 
  - But this is the nipple of a breast of my mother,  
     always near and always divine to me, her  
     true child and son. 
       - I suppose I am to be eligible to visit the stars, in  
     my time, 
  - I suppose I shall have myriads of new experiences  
      — and that the experience of this earth will  
     prove only one out of myriads; 
  - But I believe my body and my soul already  
     indicate those experiences, 
  - And I believe I shall find nothing in the stars  
     more majestic and beautiful than I have  
     already found on the earth, 
  - And I believe I have this night a clue through  
     the universes, 
  - And I believe I have this night thought a thought  
     of the clef of eternity. 
       - A vast similitude interlocks all, 
       - All spheres, grown, ungrown, small, large, suns,  
     moons, planets, comets, asteroids, 
  - All the substances of the same, and all that is  
     spiritual upon the same, 
  - All distances of place, however wide, 
  - All distances of time — all inanimate forms, 
  - All souls — all living bodies, though they be in  
     different worlds, 
  - All gaseous, watery, vegetable, mineral processes,  
     the fishes, the brutes, 
  - All men and women — me also, 
  - All nations, colors, barbarisms, civilizations, lan-
     guages, 
  - All identities that have existed or may exist on  
     this globe or any globe, 
  - All lives and deaths — all of past, present, future, 
  - This vast similitude spans them, and always has  
     spanned, and shall forever span them. 
                
## 16 — Poem of The Dead Young Men of Europe, The 72d and 73d Years of These States 

     - SUDDENLY out of its stale and drowsy lair,  
     the lair of slaves, 
  - Like lightning Europe le'pt forth, half startled at  
     itself, 
  - Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands  
     tight to the throats of kings. 
       - O hope and faith! O aching close of lives! O  
     many a sickened heart! 
  - Turn back unto this day, and make yourselves  
     afresh. 
       - And you, paid to defile the People! you liars,  
     mark! 
  - Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts, 
  - For court thieving in its manifold mean forms,  
     worming from his simplicity the poor man's  
     wages, 
  - For many a promise sworn by royal lips, and  
     broken, and laughed at in the breaking, 
       - Then in their power, not for all these did the  
     blows strike of personal revenge, or the heads  
     of the nobles fall, 
  - The People scorned the ferocity of kings. 
       - But the sweetness of mercy brewed bitter destruc-
     tion, and the frightened rulers come back, 
  - Each comes in state with his train, hangman,  
     priest, tax-gatherer, soldier, lawyer, jailer,  
     sycophant. 
       - Behind all, lo, a Shape, 
  - Vague as the night, draped interminably, head  
     front and form, in scarlet folds, 
  - Whose face and eyes none may see, 
  - Out of its robes only this — the red robes, lifted  
     by the arm, 
  - One finger, pointed high over the top, like the  
     head of a snake appears. 
       - Meanwhile, corpses lie in new-made graves —  
     bloody corpses of young men; 
  - The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets  
     of princes are flying, the creatures of power  
     laugh aloud, 
  - And all these things bear fruits, and they are  
     good. 
       - Those corpses of young men, 
       - Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those  
     hearts pierced by the gray lead, 
  - Cold and motionless as they seem, live elsewhere  
     with unslaughter'd vitality. 
       - They live in other young men, O kings! 
  - They live in brothers, again ready to defy you! 
  - They were purified by death — they were taught  
     and exalted. 
       - Not a grave of the murdered for freedom, but  
     grows seed for freedom, in its turn to bear  
     seed, 
  - Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the  
     rains and the snows nourish. 
       - Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of  
     tyrants let loose, 
  - But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering,  
     counseling, cautioning. 
       - Liberty! let others despair of you! I never despair  
     of you. 
       - Is the house shut? Is the master away? 
  - Nevertheless be ready — be not weary of watching, 
  - He will soon return — his messengers come anon. 
             
## 17 — Poem of The Heart of The Son of Manhattan Island. 

     - WHO has gone farthest? For I swear I will go  
      
  - And who has been just? For I would be the  
     most just person of the earth; 
  - And who most cautious? For I would be more  
      
  - And who has been happiest? O I think it is I!  
     I think no one was ever happier than I; 
  - And who has lavished all? For I lavish con-
     stantly the best I have; 
  - And who has been firmest? For I would be  
      
  - And who proudest? For I think I have reason to  
     be the proudest son alive — for I am the son  
     of the brawny and tall-topt city; 
  - And who has been bold and true? For I would  
     be the boldest and truest being of the uni-
      
  - And who benevolent? For I would show more  
     benevolence than all the rest; 
       - And who has projected beautiful words through  
     the longest time? By God! I will outvie  
     him! I will say such words, they shall  
     stretch through longer time! 
  - And who has received the love of the most  
     friends? For I know what it is to receive  
     the passionate love of many friends; 
  - And to whom has been given the sweetest from  
     women, and paid them in kind? For I will  
     take the like sweets, and pay them in kind; 
  - And who possesses a perfect and enamored body?  
     For I do not believe any one possesses a  
     more perfect or enamored body than mine; 
  - And who thinks the amplest thoughts? For I  
     will surround those thoughts; 
  - And who has made hymns fit for the earth? For  
     I am mad with devouring ecstasy to make  
     joyous hymns for the whole earth! 
               
## 18 — Poem of The Last Explanation of Prudence. 

     - ALL day I have walked the city and talked with  
     my friends, and thought of prudence, 
  - Of time, space, reality — of such as these, and  
     abreast with them, prudence. 
       - After all, the last explanation remains to be made  
     about prudence, 
  - Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the  
     prudence that suits immortality. 
       - The soul is of itself, 
  - All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues, 
  - All that a person does, says, thinks, is of conse-
     quence, 
  - Not a move can a man or woman make, that  
     affects him or her in a day, month, any part  
     of the direct life-time, or the hour of death,  
     but the same affects him or her onward after-
     ward through the indirect life-time. 
       - The indirect is more than the direct, 
       - The spirit receives from the body just as much as  
     it gives to the body, if not more. 
       - Not one word or deed — not venereal sore, dis-
     coloration, privacy of the onanist, putridity of  
     gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning,  
     betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution, but  
     has results beyond death, as really as before  
     death. 
       - Charity and personal force are the only invest-
     ments worth anything. 
       - No specification is necessary — all that a male  
     or female does, that is vigorous, benevolent,  
     clean, is so much profit to him or her in the  
     unshakable order of the universe, and through  
     the whole scope of it forever. 
       - Who has been wise, receives interest, 
  - Savage, felon, President, judge, prostitute, farmer,  
     sailor, mechanic, young, old, it is the same, 
  - The interest will come round — all will come  
     round. 
       - Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time,  
     will forever affect, all of the past, and all of  
     the present, and all of the future, 
  - All the brave actions of war and peace, 
       - All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old,  
     sorrowful, young children, widows, the sick,  
     and to shunned persons, 
  - All furtherance of fugitives, and of the escape of  
     slaves, 
  - All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on  
     wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of the  
     boats, 
  - All offering of substance or life for the good old  
     cause, or for a friend's sake, or opinion's sake, 
  - All pains of enthusiasts, scoffed at by their neigh-
     bors, 
  - All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering  
     of mothers, 
  - All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unre-
     corded, 
  - All the grandeur and good of ancient nations  
     whose fragments we inherit, 
  - All the good of the hundreds of ancient nations  
     unknown to us by name, date, location, 
  - All that was ever manfully begun, whether it suc-
     ceeded or no, 
  - All suggestions of the divine mind of man, or the  
     divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of his  
     great hands; 
  - All that is well thought or said this day on any  
     part of the globe — or on any of the wander-
     ing stars, or on any of the fixed stars, by  
     those there as we are here, 
       - All that is henceforth to be thought or done by  
     you, whoever you are, or by any one, 
  - These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the  
     identities from which they sprang, or shall  
     spring. 
       - Did you guess anything lived only its moment? 
  - The world does not so exist — no parts palpable  
     or impalpable so exist, 
  - No consummation exists without being from some  
     long previous consummation, and that from  
     some other, without the farthest conceivable  
     one coming a bit nearer the beginning than  
     any. 
       - Whatever satisfies souls is true, 
  - Prudence satisfies the craving and glut of souls. 
       - Itself finally satisfies the soul, 
  - The soul has that measureless pride which re-
     volts from every lesson but its own. 
       - Now I give you an inkling, 
  - Now I breathe the word of the prudence that  
     walks abreast with time, space, reality, 
  - That answers the pride which refuses every les-
     son but its own. 
       - What is prudence, is indivisible, 
       - Declines to separate one part of life from every  
     part, 
  - Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous,  
     or the living from the dead, 
  - Matches every thought or act by its correlative, 
  - Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atone-
     ment, 
  - Knows that the young man who composedly  
     periled his life and lost it, has done exceeding  
     well for himself, without doubt, 
  - That he who never periled his life, but retains it  
     to old age in riches and ease, has probably  
     achieved nothing for himself worth men-
      
  - Knows that only the person has learned, who has  
     learned to prefer results, 
  - Who favors body and soul the same, 
  - Who perceives the indirect assuredly following  
     the direct, 
  - Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever  
     neither hurries or avoids death. 
             
## 19 — Poem of The Singers, and of The Words of Poems. 

     - PERFECT sanity shows the master among  
     philosophs, 
  - Time, always without flaw, indicates itself in  
     parts, 
  - What always indicates the poet, is the crowd of  
     the pleasant company of singers, and their  
     words, 
  - The words of the singers are the hours or min-
     utes of the light or dark — but the words of  
     the maker of poems are the complete light  
     and dark, 
  - The maker of poems settles justice, reality, im-
     mortality, 
  - His insight and power encircle things and the  
     human race, 
  - He is the glory and extract, thus far, of things  
     and of the human race. 
       - The singers do not beget — only the poet be-
     gets, 
       - The singers are welcomed, understood, appear  
     often enough — but rare has the day been,  
     likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker  
     of poems, 
  - Not every century, or every five centuries, has  
     contained such a day, for all its names. 
       - The singers of successive hours of centuries may  
     have ostensible names, but the name of each  
     of them is one of the singers, 
  - The name of each is, a heart-singer, eye-singer,  
     hymn-singer, law-singer, ear-singer, head-
     singer, sweet-singer, wise-singer, droll-
     singer, thrift-singer, sea-singer, wit-singer,  
     echo-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer, pas-
     sion-singer, mystic-singer, weeping-singer,  
     fable-singer, item-singer, or something else. 
       - All this time, and at all times, wait the words of  
      
  - The greatness of sons is the exuding of the great-
     ness of mothers and fathers, 
  - The words of poems are the tuft and final applause  
     of science. 
       - Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of  
     reason, health, rudeness of body, withdrawn-
     ness, gaiety, sun-tan, air-sweetness — such  
     are the words of poems. 
            - The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, 
  - The builder, geometer, mathematician, astronomer,  
     melodist, philosoph, chemist, anatomist,  
     spiritualist, language-searcher, geologist,  
     phrenologist, artist — all these underlie the  
     maker of poems. 
       - The words of poems give you more than poems, 
  - They give you to form for yourself poems,  
     religions, politics, war, peace, behaviour,  
     histories, essays, romances, and every thing  
     else, 
  - They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the  
     sexes, 
  - They do not seek beauty, they are sought —  
     forever touching them, or close upon them,  
     follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick; 
  - They are not the finish, but rather the outset, 
  - They bring none to his or her terminus, or to be  
     content and full, 
  - Whom they take, they take into space, to behold  
     the birth of stars, to learn one of the  
     meanings, 
  - To launch off with absolute faith — to sweep  
     through the ceaseless rings, and never be  
     quiet again. 
                
## 20 — Faith Poem. 

     - I NEED no assurances — I am a man who is  
     pre-occupied of his own soul; 
  - I do not doubt that whatever I know at a given  
     time, there waits for me more which I do not  
      
  - I do not doubt that from under the feet, and beside  
     the hands and face I am cognizant of, are  
     now looking faces I am not cognizant of —  
     calm and actual faces; 
  - I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the  
     world is latent in any iota of the world; 
  - I do not doubt there are realizations I have  
     no idea of, waiting for me through time  
     and through the universes — also upon this  
      
  - I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the uni-
     verses are limitless — in vain I try to think  
     how limitless; 
  - I do not doubt that the orbs, and the systems of  
     orbs, play their swift sports through the air             on purpose — and that I shall one day be  
     eligible to do as much as they, and more than  
      
  - I do not doubt there is far more in trivialities,  
     insects, vulgar persons, slaves, dwarfs, weeds,  
     rejected refuse, than I have supposed; 
  - I do not doubt there is more in myself than I have  
     supposed — and more in all men and women  
      — and more in my poems than I have  
      
  - I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and  
     on, millions of years; 
  - I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and  
     exteriors have their exteriors — and that the  
     eye-sight has another eye-sight, and the hear-
     ing another hearing, and the voice another  
      
  - I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths  
     of young men are provided for — and that the  
     deaths of young women, and the deaths of  
     little children, are provided for; 
  - I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter  
     what the horrors of them — no matter whose  
     wife, child, husband, father, lover, has gone  
     down — are provided for, to the minutest  
      
  - I do not doubt that shallowness, meanness, malig-
     nance, are provided for; 
       - I do not doubt that cities, you, America, the  
     remainder of the earth, politics, freedom,  
     degradations, are carefully provided for; 
  - I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen,  
     any where, at any time, is provided for, in  
     the inherences of things. 
                
## 21 — Liberty Poem for Asia, Africa, Europe, America, Australia, Cuba, and  The Archipelogoes of the Sea. 

     - COURAGE! my brother or my sister!  
     Keep on! Liberty is to be subserved, what-
     ever occurs; 
  - That is nothing, that is quelled by one or two fail-
     ures, or any number of failures, 
  - Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the  
     people, 
  - Or the show of the tushes of power — soldiers,  
     cannon, penal statutes. 
       - What we believe in waits latent forever through  
     Asia, Africa, Europe, America, Australia,  
     Cuba, and all the islands and archipelagoes  
     of the sea; 
  - What we believe in invites no one, promises  
     nothing, sits in calmness and light, is positive  
     and composed, knows no discouragement, 
  - Waits patiently its time — a year — a century —  
     a hundred centuries. 
            - The battle rages with many a loud alarm and  
     frequent advance and retreat, 
  - The infidel triumphs — or supposes he triumphs, 
  - The prison, scaffold, garrote, hand-cuffs, iron neck-
     lace and anklet, lead-balls, do their work, 
  - The named and unnamed heroes pass to other  
     spheres, 
  - The great speakers and writers are exiled — they  
     lie sick in distant lands, 
  - The cause is asleep — the strong throats are  
     choked with their own blood, 
  - The young men drop their eye-lashes toward the  
     ground when they meet, 
  - But for all this, liberty has not gone out of the  
     place, nor the infidel entered into pos-
     session. 
       - When liberty goes out of a place, it is not the  
     first to go, nor the second or third to go, 
  - It waits for all the rest to go — it is the last. 
       - When there are no more memories of the lovers  
     of the whole of the nations of the world, 
  - The lovers' names scouted in the public gatherings  
     by the lips of the orators, 
  - Boys not christened after them, but christened  
     after traitors and murderers instead, 
  - Laws for slaves sweet to the taste of people —  
     the slave-hunt acknowledged, 
       - You or I walking abroad upon the earth, elated  
     at the sight of slaves, no matter who they  
     are, 
  - And when all life and all the souls of men and  
     women are discharged from any part of the  
     earth, 
  - Then shall the instinct of liberty be discharged  
     from that part of the earth, 
  - Then shall the infidel and the tyrant come into  
     possession. 
                 
## 22 — Poem of Apparitions in Boston, The 78th Year of These States. 

     - CLEAR the way there, Jonathan!  
     Way for the President's marshal! Way for  
     the government cannon! 
  - Way for the federal foot and dragoons — and the  
     apparitions copiously tumbling. 
       - I rose this morning early to get betimes in Boston  
     town, 
  - Here's a good place at the corner, I must stand  
     and see the show. 
       - I love to look on the stars and stripes, I hope the  
     fifes will play Yankee Doodle. 
       - How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost  
     troops! 
  - Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff  
     through Boston town. 
       - A fog follows, antiques of the same come  
     limping, 
       - Some appear wooden-legged and some appear  
     bandaged and bloodless. 
       - Why this is a show! It has called the dead out  
     of the earth! 
  - The old grave-yards of the hills have hurried to  
     see! 
  - Uncountable phantoms gather by flank and rear  
     of it! 
  - Cocked hats of mothy mould! crutches made of  
     mist! 
  - Arms in slings! old men leaning on young men's  
     shoulders! 
       - What troubles you, Yankee phantoms? What is  
     all this chattering of bare gums? 
  - Does the ague convulse your limbs? Do you  
     mistake your crutches for fire-locks, and  
     level them? 
       - If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see  
     the President's marshal, 
  - If you groan such groans you might balk the  
     government cannon. 
       - For shame, old maniacs! Bring down those  
     tossed arms and let your white hair be, 
  - Here gape your smart grand-sons — their wives  
     gaze at them from the windows, 
       - See how well-dressed — see how orderly they  
     conduct themselves. 
       - Worse and worse! Can't you stand it? Are you  
     retreating? 
  - Is this hour with the living too dead for you? 
       - Retreat then! Pell-mell! Back to the hills, old  
     limpers! 
  - I do not think you belong here, anyhow. 
       - But there is one thing that belongs here — shall I  
     tell you what it is, gentlemen of Boston? 
       - I will whisper it to the Mayor — he shall send a  
     committee to England, 
  - They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go  
     with a cart to the royal vault, 
  - Dig out King George's coffin — unwrap him quick  
     from the grave-clothes — box up his bones for  
     a journey, 
  - Find a swift Yankee clipper — here is freight for  
     you, black-bellied clipper! 
  - Up with your anchor! shake out your sails! steer  
     straight toward Boston bay. 
       - Now call the President's marshal again, bring  
     out the government cannon, 
         - Fetch home the roarers from Congress, make  
     another procession, guard it with foot and  
     dragoons. 
       - This centre-piece for them: 
  - Look! all orderly citizens — look from the win-
     dows, women! 
       - The committee open the box, set up the regal  
     ribs, glue those that will not stay, 
  - Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a  
     crown on top of the skull. 
       - You have got your revenge, old buster! The  
     crown is come to its own, and more than its  
     own. 
       - Stick your hands in your pockets Jonathan — you  
     are a made man from this day, 
  - You are mighty cute, and here is one of your  
     bargains. 
              
## 23 — Poem of Remembrances for A Girl or A Boy of These States. 

     - REMEMBER the organic compact of These  
     States! 
  - Remember the pledge of the Old Thirteen thence-
     forward to the rights, life, liberty, equality, of  
     man! 
  - Remember what was promulged by the founders,  
     ratified by The States, signed in black and  
     white by the Commissioners, read by Wash-
     ington at the head of the army! 
  - Remember the purposes of the founders! — Re-
     member Washington! 
  - Remember the copious humanity streaming from  
     every direction toward America! 
  - Remember the hospitality that belongs to nations  
     and men! — (Cursed be nation, woman, man,  
     without hospitality!) 
  - Remember, government is to subserve individuals! 
  - Not any, not the President, is to have one jot more  
     than you or me, 
  - Not any habitan of America is to have one jot less  
     than you or me. 
            - Anticipate when the thirty or fifty millions are to  
     become the hundred, or two hundred, or five  
     hundred millions, of equal freemen and free-
     women, amicably joined. 
       - Recall ages — One age is but a part — ages are  
     but a part, 
  - Recall the angers, bickerings, delusions, supersti-
     tions of the idea of caste, 
  - Recall the bloody cruelties and crimes. 
       - Anticipate the best women! 
  - I say an unnumbered new race of hardy and well-
     defined women are to spread through all  
     These States, 
  - I say a girl fit for These States must be free,  
     capable, dauntless, just the same as a boy. 
       - Anticipate your own life — retract with merciless  
     power, 
  - Shirk nothing — retract in time — Do you see those  
     errors, diseases, weaknesses, lies, thefts? 
  - Do you see that lost character? — Do you see  
     decay, consumption, rum-drinking, dropsy,  
     fever, mortal cancer or inflammation? 
  - Do you see death, and the approach of death? 
       - Think of the soul! 
  - I swear to you that body of yours gives proportions  
     to your soul somehow to live in other spheres, 
       - I do not know how, but I know it is so.
    - Think of loving and being loved! 
  - I swear to you, whoever you are, you can interfuse  
     yourself with such things that everybody that  
     sees you shall look longingly upon you! 
       - Think of the past! 
  - I warn you that in a little while others will find  
     their past in you and your times. 
       - The race is never separated — nor man nor woman  
     escapes, 
  - All is inextricable — things, spirits, nature, nations,  
     you too — from precedents you come. 
       - Recall the ever-welcome defiers! (The mothers  
     precede them;) 
  - Recall the sages, poets, saviours, inventors, law-
     givers, of the earth, 
  - Recall Christ, brother of rejected persons —  
     brother of slaves, felons, idiots, and of insane  
     and diseased persons. 
       - Think of the time when you was not yet born! 
  - Think of times you stood at the side of the dying! 
  - Think of the time when your own body will be  
     dying! 
       - Think of spiritual results! 
       - Sure as the earth swims through the heavens,  
     does every one of its objects pass into  
     spiritual results! 
       - Think of manhood, and you to be a man! 
  - Do you count manhood, and the sweet of manhood,  
     nothing? 
       - Think of womanhood, and you to be a woman! 
  - The creation is womanhood, 
  - Have I not said that womanhood involves all? 
  - Have I not told how the universe has nothing  
     better than the best womanhood? 
                  
## 24 — Poem of Perfect Miracles. 

     - REALISM is mine, my miracles,  
     Take all of the rest — take freely — I keep  
     but my own — I give only of them, 
  - I offer them without end — I offer them to you  
     wherever your feet can carry you, or your  
     eyes reach. 
       - Why! who makes much of a miracle? 
  - As to me, I know of nothing else but miracles, 
  - Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan, 
  - Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward  
     the sky, 
  - Or wade with naked feet along the beach, just in  
     the edge of the water, 
  - Or stand under trees in the woods, 
  - Or talk by day with any one I love — or sleep in  
     the bed at night with any one I love, 
  - Or sit at the table at dinner with my mother, 
  - Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car, 
  - Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive, of an  
     August forenoon, 
  - Or animals feeding in the fields, 
       - Or birds — or the wonderfulness of insects in the  
     air, 
  - Or the wonderfulness of the sun-down — or of  
     stars shining so quiet and bright, 
  - Or the exquisite, delicate, thin curve of the new-
     moon in May, 
  - Or whether I go among those I like best, and that  
     like me best — mechanics, boatmen, farmers, 
  - Or among the savans — or to the soiree — or to  
     the opera, 
  - Or stand a long while looking at the movements  
     of machinery, 
  - Or behold children at their sports, 
  - Or the admirable sight of the perfect old man, or  
     the perfect old woman, 
  - Or the sick in hospitals, or the dead carried to  
     burial, 
  - Or my own eyes and figure in the glass, 
  - These, with the rest, one and all, are to me  
     miracles, 
  - The whole referring — yet each distinct and in its  
     place. 
       - To me, every hour of the light and dark is a  
     miracle, 
  - Every inch of space is a miracle, 
  - Every square yard of the surface of the earth is  
     spread with the same, 
       - Every cubic foot of the interior swarms with the  
      
  - Every spear of grass — the frames, limbs, organs,  
     of men and women, and all that concerns  
     them, 
  - All these to me are unspeakably perfect miracles. 
       - To me the sea is a continual miracle, 
  - The fishes that swim — the rocks — the motion  
     of the waves — the ships, with men in them  
      — what stranger miracles are there? 
              
## 25 — Poem of The Child That Went Forth, and Always Goes Forth, Forever and Forever 

     - THERE was a child went forth every day, 
  - And the first object he looked upon and re-
     ceived with wonder, pity, love, or dread,  
     that object he became, 
  - And that object became part of him for the day,  
     or a certain part of the day, or for many  
     years, or stretching cycles of years. 
       - The early lilacs became part of this child, 
  - And grass, and white and red morning-glories, and  
     white and red clover, and the song of the  
     phœbe-bird, 
  - And the March-born lambs, and the sow's pink-
     faint litter, and the mare's foal, and the cow's  
     calf, and the noisy brood of the barn-yard or  
     by the mire of the pond-side, and the fish  
     suspending themselves so curiously below  
     there, and the beautiful curious liquid, and the  
     water-plants with their graceful flat heads —  
     all became part of him. 
            - The field-sprouts of April and May became part  
     of him — winter-grain sprouts, and those of  
     the light-yellow corn, and of the esculent  
     roots of the garden, 
  - And the apple-trees covered with blossoms, and  
     the fruit afterward, and wood-berries, and the  
     commonest weeds by the road, 
  - And the old drunkard staggering home from the  
     out-house of the tavern whence he had lately  
     risen, 
  - And the school-mistress that passed on her way to  
     the school, and the friendly boys that passed,  
     and the quarrelsome boys, and the tidy and  
     fresh-cheeked girls, and the bare-foot negro  
     boy and girl, 
  - And all the changes of city and country, wherever  
     he went. 
       - His own parents — he that had propelled the  
     father-stuff at night and fathered him, and  
     she that conceived him in her womb and  
     birthed him — they gave this child more of  
     themselves than that, 
  - They gave him afterward every day — they and  
     of them became part of him. 
       - The mother at home, quietly placing the dishes on  
     the supper-table, 
       - The mother with mild words, clean her cap and  
     gown, a wholesome odor falling off her per-
     son and clothes as she walks by, 
  - The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean,  
     angered, unjust, 
  - The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain,  
     the crafty lure, 
  - The family usages, the language, the company, the  
     furniture — the yearning and swelling heart, 
  - Affection that will not be gainsayed — the sense  
     of what is real — the thought if, after all, it  
     should prove unreal, 
  - The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-
     time, the curious whether and how, 
  - Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all  
     flashes and specks? 
  - Men and women crowding fast in the streets — if  
     they are not flashes and specks what are  
     they? 
  - The streets themselves, and the facades of houses,  
     the goods in the windows, 
  - Vehicles, teams, the tiered wharves, the huge  
     crossing at the ferries, 
  - The village on the highland seen from afar at sun-
     set, the river between, 
  - Shadows, aureola and mist, light falling on roofs  
     and gables of white or brown, three miles off, 
  - The schooner near-by sleepily dropping down the  
     tide, the little boat slack-towed astern, 
       - The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests,  
     slapping, 
  - The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of ma-
     roon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread  
     of purity it lies motionless in, 
  - The horizon's edge, the flying sea-crow, the fra-
     grance of salt-marsh and shore-mud; 
  - These became part of that child who went forth  
     every day, who now goes, and will always  
     go forth every day, 
  - And these become of him or her that peruses  
     them now. 
               
## 26 — Night Poem. 

     - I WANDER all night in my vision,  
     Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noise-
     lessly stepping and stopping, 
  - Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of  
     sleepers, 
  - Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-
     assorted, contradictory, 
  - Pausing, gazing, bending, stopping. 
       - How solemn they look there, stretched and still! 
  - How quiet they breathe, the little children in their  
     cradles! 
       - The wretched features of ennuyees, the white  
     features of corpses, the livid faces of drunk-
     ards, the sick-gray faces of onanists, 
  - The gashed bodies on battle-fields, the insane in  
     their strong-doored rooms, the sacred idiots, 
  - The new-born emerging from gates, and the dying  
     emerging from gates, 
  - The night pervades them and enfolds them. 
            - The married couple sleep calmly in their bed —  
     he with his palm on the hip of the wife, and  
     she with her palm on the hip of the husband, 
  - The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their  
     bed, 
  - The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs, 
  - And the mother sleeps with her little child care-
     fully wrapped. 
       - The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep, 
  - The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the run-
     away son sleeps, 
  - The murderer that is to be hung next day — how  
     does he sleep? 
  - And the murdered person — how does he sleep? 
       - The female that loves unrequited sleeps, 
  - And the male that loves unrequited sleeps; 
  - The head of the money-maker that plotted all day  
     sleeps, 
  - And the enraged and treacherous dispositions  
     sleep. 
       - I stand with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering  
     and restless, 
  - I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few  
     inches from them, 
  - The restless sink in their beds — they fitfully  
     sleep. 
            - The earth recedes from me into the night, 
  - I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is  
     not the earth is beautiful. 
       - I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with  
     the other sleepers, each in turn, 
  - I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other  
     dreamers, 
  - And I become the other dreamers. 
       - I am a dance — Play up, there! the fit is whirling  
     me fast! 
  - I am the ever-laughing — it is new moon and  
     twilight, 
  - I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts  
     whichever way I look, 
  - Cache, and cache again, deep in the ground  
     and sea, and where it is neither ground  
     or sea. 
       - Well do they do their jobs, those journeymen  
     divine, 
  - Only from me can they hide nothing, and would  
     not if they could, 
  - I reckon I am their boss, and they make me a pet  
     besides, 
  - And surround me and lead me, and run ahead  
     when I walk, 
       - To lift their cunning covers, to signify me with  
     stretched arms, and resume the way; 
  - Onward we move! a gay gang of blackguards!  
     with mirth-shouting music and wild-flapping  
     pennants of joy! 
       - I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the poli-
     tician, 
  - The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that  
     stood in the box, 
  - He who has been famous, and he who shall be  
     famous after today, 
  - The stammerer, the well-formed person, the  
     wasted or feeble person. 
       - I am she who adorned herself and folded her hair  
     expectantly, 
  - My truant lover has come, and it is dark. 
       - Double yourself and receive me, darkness! 
  - Receive me and my lover too — he will not let me  
     go without him. 
       - I roll myself upon you, as upon a bed — I resign  
     myself to the dusk. 
       - He whom I call answers me and takes the place  
     of my lover, 
  - He rises with me silently from the bed. 
       - Darkness, you are gentler than my lover! his flesh  
     was sweaty and panting, 
         - I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.
    - My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all  
     directions, 
  - I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you  
     are journeying. 
       - Be careful, darkness! already, what was it touched  
     me? 
  - I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he  
     are one, 
  - I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away. 
       - O hot-cheeked and blushing! O foolish hectic! 
  - O for pity's sake, no one must see me now! my  
     clothes were stolen while I was abed, 
  - Now I am thrust forth, where shall I run? 
       - Pier that I saw dimly last night, when I looked  
     from the windows! 
  - Pier out from the main, let me catch myself with  
     you and stay! I will not chafe you, 
  - I feel ashamed to go naked about the world. 
       - I am curious to know where my feet stand — and  
     what this is flooding me, childhood or man-
     hood — and the hunger that crosses the bridge  
     between. 
            - The cloth laps a first sweet eating and drinking, 
  - Laps life-swelling yolks — laps ear of rose-corn,  
     milky and just ripened; 
  - The white teeth stay, and the boss-tooth advances  
     in darkness, 
  - And liquor is spilled on lips and bosoms by touch-
     ing glasses, and the best liquor afterward. 
       - I descend my western course, my sinews are  
     flaccid, 
  - Perfume and youth course through me, and I am  
     their wake. 
       - It is my face yellow and wrinkled, instead of the  
     old woman's, 
  - I sit low in a straw-bottom chair, and carefully darn  
     my grand-son's stockings. 
       - It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the  
     winter midnight, 
  - I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid  
     earth. 
       - A shroud I see, and I am the shroud — I wrap a  
     body and lie in the coffin, 
  - It is dark here underground, it is not evil or pain  
     here, it is blank here, for reasons. 
       - It seems to me that everything in the light and air  
     ought to be happy, 
       - Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave,  
     let him know he has enough. 
       - I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming  
     naked through the eddies of the sea, 
  - His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he  
     strikes out with courageous arms, he urges  
     himself with his legs, 
  - I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes, 
  - I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash  
     him head-foremost on the rocks. 
       - What are you doing, you ruffianly red-trickled  
     waves? 
  - Will you kill the courageous giant? Will you kill  
     him in the prime of his middle age? 
       - Steady and long he struggles, 
  - He is baffled, banged, bruised — he holds out while  
     his strength holds out, 
  - The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood —  
     they bear him away, they roll him, swing  
     him, turn him, 
  - His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies,  
     it is continually bruised on rocks, 
  - Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse. 
       - I turn, but do not extricate myself, 
  - Confused, a past-reading, another, but with dark-
     ness yet. 
            - The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the  
     wreck-guns sound, 
  - The tempest lulls — the moon comes floundering  
     through the drifts. 
       - I look where the ship helplessly heads end on — I  
     hear the burst as she strikes — I hear the howls  
     of dismay — they grow fainter and fainter. 
       - I cannot aid with my wringing fingers, 
  - I can but rush to the surf, and let it drench me  
     and freeze upon me. 
       - I search with the crowd — not one of the company  
     is washed to us alive; 
  - In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay  
     them in rows in a barn. 
       - Now of the old war-days, the defeat at Brooklyn, 
  - Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on  
     the entrenched hills amid a crowd of officers, 
  - His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the  
     weeping drops, he lifts the glass perpetually  
     to his eyes, the color is blanched from his  
     cheeks, 
  - He sees the slaughter of the southern braves con-
     fided to him by their parents. 
       - The same, at last and at last, when peace is  
     declared, 
       - He stands in the room of the old tavern — the  
     well-beloved soldiers all pass through, 
  - The officers speechless and slow draw near in  
     their turns, 
  - The chief encircles their necks with his arm, and  
     kisses them on the cheek, 
  - He kisses lightly the wet cheeks one after another  
      — he shakes hands, and bids good-bye to the  
     army. 
       - Now I tell what my mother told me today as we  
     sat at dinner together, 
  - Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home  
     with her parents on the old homestead. 
       - A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old  
     homestead, 
  - On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for  
     rush-bottoming chairs, 
  - Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse,  
     half-enveloped her face, 
  - Her step was free and elastic, her voice sounded  
     exquisitely as she spoke. 
       - My mother looked in delight and amazement at  
     the stranger, 
  - She looked at the beauty of her tall-borne face,  
     and full and pliant limbs, 
  - The more she looked upon her she loved her, 
       - Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty  
     and purity, 
  - She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the  
     fire-place, she cooked food for her, 
  - She had no work to give her, but she gave her  
     remembrance and fondness. 
        - The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward  
     the middle of the afternoon she went away, 
  - O my mother was loth to have her go away! 
  - All the week she thought of her — she watched  
     for her many a month, 
  - She remembered her many a winter and many a  
     summer, 
  - But the red squaw never came, nor was heard of  
     there again. 
       - Now Lucifer was not dead — or if he was, I am  
     his sorrowful terrible heir! 
  - I have been wronged — I am oppressed — I hate  
     him that oppresses me! 
  - I will either destroy him, or he shall release me. 
       - Damn him! how he does defile me! 
  - How he informs against my brother and sister,  
     and takes pay for their blood! 
  - How he laughs when I look down the bend, after  
     the steamboat that carries away my woman! 
            - Now the vast dusk bulk that is the whale's bulk,  
     it seems mine, 
  - Warily, sportsman! though I lie so sleepy and  
     sluggish, my tap is death. 
       - A show of the summer softness! a contact of  
     something unseen! an amour of the light and  
     air! 
  - I am jealous, and overwhelmed with friendli-
     ness, 
  - And will go gallivant with the light and air myself, 
  - And have an unseen something to be in contact  
     with them also. 
       - O love and summer! you are in the dreams, and  
     in me, 
  - Autumn and winter are in the dreams — the far-
     mer goes with his thrift, 
  - The droves and crops increase, the barns are  
     well-filled. 
       - Elements merge in the night, ships make tacks in  
     the dreams, the sailor sails, the exile returns  
     home, 
  - The fugitive returns unharmed, the immigrant is  
     back beyond months and years, 
  - The poor Irishman lives in the simple house of  
     his childhood with the well-known neighbors  
     and faces, 
       - They warmly welcome him, he is bare-foot again,  
     he forgets he is well-off; 
  - The Dutchman voyages home, and the Scotchman  
     and Welchman voyage home, and the native  
     of the Mediterranean voyages home, 
  - To every port of England, France, Spain, enter  
     well-filled ships, 
  - The Swiss foots it toward his hills, the Prussian  
     goes his way, the Hungarian his way, the  
     Pole his way, 
  - The Swede returns, and the Dane and Norwegian  
     return. 
       - The homeward bound, and the outward bound, 
  - The beautiful lost swimmer, the ennuyee, the  
     onanist, the female that loves unrequited, the  
     money-maker, 
  - The actor and actress, those through with their  
     parts, and those waiting to commence, 
  - The affectionate boy, the husband and wife, the  
     voter, the nominee that is chosen, and the  
     nominee that has failed, 
  - The great already known, and the great any-time  
     after today, 
  - The stammerer, the sick, the perfect-formed, the  
     homely, 
  - The criminal that stood in the box, the judge that  
     sat and sentenced him, the fluent lawyers, the  
     jury, the audience, 
         - The laugher and weeper, the dancer, the midnight  
     widow, the red squaw, 
  - The consumptive, the erysipalite, the idiot, he  
     that is wronged, 
  - The antipodes, and every one between this and  
     them in the dark, 
  - I swear they are averaged now — one is no better  
     than the other, 
  - The night and sleep have likened them and re-
     tored them. 
       - I swear they are all beautiful! 
  - Every one that sleeps is beautiful — every thing  
     in the dim light is beautiful, 
  - The wildest and bloodiest is over, and all is peace. 
       - Peace is always beautiful, 
  - The myth of heaven indicates peace and night. 
       - The myth of heaven indicates the soul; 
  - The soul is always beautiful — it appears more or  
     it appears less — it comes or it lags behind, 
  - It comes from its embowered garden, and looks  
     pleasantly on itself, and encloses the world, 
  - Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting,  
     and perfect and clean the womb cohering, 
  - The head well-grown, proportioned, plumb, and  
     the bowels and joints proportioned and  
     plumb. 
            - The soul is always beautiful, 
  - The universe is duly in order, every thing is in its  
     place, 
  - What is arrived is in its place, and what waits is  
     in its place; 
  - The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood  
     waits, 
  - The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long,  
     and the child of the drunkard waits long, and  
     the drunkard himself waits long, 
  - The sleepers that lived and died wait — the  
     far advanced are to go on in their turns,  
     and the far behind are to go on in their  
     turns, 
  - The diverse shall be no less diverse, but they shall  
     flow and unite — they unite now. 
       - The sleepers are very beautiful as they lie  
     unclothed, 
  - They flow hand in hand over the whole earth  
     from east to west as they lie unclothed, 
  - The Asiatic and African are hand in hand, the  
     European and American are hand in hand, 
  - Learned and unlearned are hand in hand, and male  
     and female are hand in hand, 
  - The bare arm of the girl crosses the bare breast  
     of her lover, they press close without lust, his  
     lips press her neck, 
       - The father holds his grown or ungrown son in his  
     arms with measureless love, and the son holds  
     the father in his arms with measureless love, 
  - The white hair of the mother shines on the white  
     wrist of the daughter, 
  - The breath of the boy goes with the breath of the  
     man, friend is inarmed by friend, 
  - The scholar kisses the teacher, and the teacher  
     kisses the scholar — the wronged is made  
     right, 
  - The call of the slave is one with the master's call,  
     and the master salutes the slave, 
  - The felon steps forth from the prison, the insane  
     becomes sane, the suffering of sick persons is  
     relieved, 
  - The sweatings and fevers stop, the throat that was  
     unsound is sound, the lungs of the con-
     sumptive are resumed, the poor distressed  
     head is free, 
  - The joints of the rheumatic move as smoothly as  
     ever, and smoother than ever, 
  - Stiflings and passages open, the paralysed become  
     supple, 
  - The swelled and convulsed and congested awake  
     to themselves in condition, 
  - They pass the invigoration of the night and the  
     chemistry of the night, and awake. 
       - I too pass from the night! 
       - I stay awhile away O night, but I return to you  
     again, and love you! 
       - Why should I be afraid to trust myself to you? 
  - I am not afraid — I have been well brought forward  
     by you, 
  - I love the rich running day, but I do not desert  
     her in whom I lay so long, 
  - I know not how I came of you, and I know not  
     where I go with you — but I know I came  
     well, and shall go well. 
       - I will stop only a time with the night, and rise  
     betimes, 
  - I will duly pass the day, O my mother, and duly  
     return to you. 
               
## 27 — Poem of Faces. 

     - SAUNTERING the pavement or riding the  
     country by-road, here then are faces! 
  - Faces of friendship, precision, caution, suavity,  
     ideality, 
  - The spiritual prescient face — the always welcome,  
     common, benevolent face, 
  - The face of the singing of music — the grand faces  
     of natural lawyers and judges, broad at the  
     back-top, 
  - The faces of hunters and fishers, bulged at the  
     brows — the shaved blanched faces of ortho-
     dox citizens, 
  - The pure, extravagant, yearning, questioning artist's  
     face, 
  - The ugly face of some beautiful soul, the hand-
     some detested or despised face, 
  - The sacred faces of infants, the illuminated face  
     of the mother of many children, 
  - The face of an amour, the face of veneration, 
  - The face as of a dream, the face of an immobile  
     rock, 
       - The face withdrawn of its good and bad, a cas-
     trated face, 
  - A wild hawk, his wings clipped by the clipper, 
  - A stallion that yielded at last to the thongs and  
     knife of the gelder. 
       - Sauntering the pavement or crossing the ceaseless  
     ferry, here then are faces! 
  - I see them, and complain not, and am content  
     with all. 
       - Do you suppose I could be content with all if I  
     thought them their own finale? 
       - This now is too lamentable a face for a man 
  - Some abject louse asking leave to be, cringing  
     for it, 
  - Some milk-nosed maggot blessing what lets it  
     wrig to its hole. 
       - This face is a dog's snout sniffing for garbage; 
  - Snakes nest in that mouth, I hear the sibilant  
     threat. 
       - This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea, 
  - Its sleepy and wobbling icebergs crunch as they  
     go. 
       - This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they  
     need no label, 
       - And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc,  
     or hog's-lard. 
       - This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives  
     out the unearthly cry, 
  - Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till  
     they show nothing but their whites, 
  - Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by  
     the turned-in nails, 
  - The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground  
     while he speculates well. 
       - This face is bitten by vermin and worms, 
  - And this is some murderer's knife with a half-
     pulled scabbard. 
       - This face owes to the sexton his dismalest fee, 
  - An unceasing death-bell tolls there. 
       - Those then are really men, the bosses and tufts  
     of the great round globe! 
       - Features of my equals, would you trick me with  
     your creased and cadaverous march? 
  - Well, you cannot trick me. 
       - I see your rounded never-erased flow, 
  - I see neath the rims of your haggard and mean  
     disguises. 
            - Splay and twist as you like — poke with the tan-
     gling fores of fishes or rats, 
  - You'll be unmuzzled, you certainly will. 
       - I saw the face of the most smeared and slobbering  
     idiot they had at the asylum, 
  - And I knew for my consolation what they knew  
     not, 
  - I knew of the agents that emptied and broke my  
     brother, 
  - The same wait to clear the rubbish from the fallen  
     tenement, 
  - And I shall look again in a score or two of  
     ages, 
  - And I shall meet the real landlord perfect  
     and unharmed, every inch as good as  
     myself. 
       - The Lord advances, and yet advances! 
  - Always the shadow in front! always the reached  
     hand bringing up the laggards! 
       - Out of this face emerge banners and horses — O  
     superb! I see what is coming, 
  - I see the high pioneer-caps — I see the staves of  
     runners clearing the way, 
  - I hear victorious drums. 
       - This face is a life-boat, 
       - This is the face commanding and bearded, it asks  
     no odds of the rest, 
  - This face is flavored fruit, ready for eating, 
  - This face of a healthy honest boy is the programme  
     of all good. 
       - These faces bear testimony slumbering or awake, 
  - They show their descent from the Master  
     himself. 
       - Off the word I have spoken I except not one —  
     red, white, black, all are deific, 
  - In each house is the ovum, it comes forth after a  
     thousand years. 
       - Spots or cracks at the windows do not disturb  
     me, 
  - Tall and sufficient stand behind and make signs  
     to me, 
  - I read the promise and patiently wait. 
       - This is a full-grown lily's face, 
  - She speaks to the limber-hipp'd man near the gar-
     den pickets, 
  - Come here, she blushingly cries — Come nigh to  
     me, limber-hipp'd man, and give me your finger  
     and thumb, 
  - Stand at my side till I lean as high as I can upon  
     you, 
       - Fill me with albescent honey, bend down to me, 
  - Rub to me with your chafing beard, rub to my  
     breast and shoulders. 
       - The old face of the mother of many children! 
  - Whist! I am fully content. 
       - Lulled and late is the smoke of the Sabbath  
     morning, 
  - It hangs low over the rows of trees by the  
     fences, 
  - It hangs thin by the sassafras, the wild-cherry,  
     and the cat-brier under them. 
       - I saw the rich ladies in full dress at the soiree, 
  - I heard what the singers were singing so long, 
  - Heard who sprang in crimson youth from the  
     white froth and the water-blue. 
       - Behold a woman! 
  - She looks out from her quaker cap — her face is  
     clearer and more beautiful than the sky. 
       - She sits in an arm-chair, under the shaded porch  
     of the farm-house, 
  - The sun just shines on her old white head. 
       - Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen, 
       - Her grand-sons raised the flax, and her grand-
     daughters spun it with the distaff and the  
     wheel. 
       - The melodious character of the earth! 
  - The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go,  
     and does not wish to go! 
  - The justified mother of men! 
            
## 28 — Bunch Poem. 

     - THE friend I am happy with,  
     The arm of my friend hanging idly over my  
     shoulder, 
  - The hill-side whitened with blossoms of the  
     mountain ash, 
  - The same, late in autumn — the gorgeous hues of  
     red, yellow, drab, purple, and light and dark  
     green, 
  - The rich coverlid of the grass — animals and  
     birds — the private untrimmed bank — the  
     primitive apples — the pebble-stones, 
  - Beautiful dripping fragments — the negligent list  
     of one after another, as I happen to call them  
     to me, or think of them, 
  - The real poems, (what we call poems being merely  
     pictures,) 
  - The poems of the privacy of the night, and of  
     men like me, 
  - This poem, drooping shy and unseen, that I al-
     ways carry, and that all men carry, 
  - (Know, once for all, avowed on purpose, wherever  
     are men like me, are our lusty, lurking, mas-
     culine poems,) 
       - Love-thoughts, love-juice, love-odor, love-yielding,  
     love-climbers, and the climbing sap, 
  - Arms and hands of love — lips of love — phallic  
     thumb of love — breasts of love — bellies,  
     pressed and glued together with love, 
  - Earth of chaste love — life that is only life after  
     love, 
  - The body of my love — the body of the woman I  
     love — the body of the man — the body of the  
     earth, 
  - Soft forenoon airs that blow from the south-west, 
  - The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up  
     and down — that gripes the full-grown lady-
     flower, curves upon her with amorous firm  
     legs, takes his will of her, and holds himself  
     tremulous and tight upon her till he is satis-
     fied, 
  - The wet of woods through the early hours, 
  - Two sleepers at night lying close together as they  
     sleep, one with an arm slanting down across  
     and below the waist of the other, 
  - The smell of apples, aromas from crushed sage-
     plant, mint, birch-bark, 
  - The boy's longings, the glow and pressure as he  
     confides to me what he was dreaming, 
  - The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl, and falling  
     still and content to the ground, 
  - The no-formed stings that sights, people, objects,  
     sting me with, 
       - The hubbed sting of myself, stinging me as much  
     as it ever can any one, 
  - The sensitive, orbic, underlapped brothers, that  
     only privileged feelers may be intimate where  
     they are, 
  - The curious roamer, the hand, roaming all over  
     the body — the bashful withdrawing of flesh  
     where the fingers soothingly pause and edge  
     themselves, 
  - The limpid liquid within the young man, 
  - The vexed corrosion, so pensive and so painful, 
  - The torment — the irritable tide that will not be  
     at rest, 
  - The like of the same I feel — the like of the same  
     in others, 
  - The young woman that flushes and flushes, and  
     the young man that flushes and flushes, 
  - The young man that wakes, deep at night, the hot  
     hand seeking to repress what would master  
     him — the strange half-welcome pangs, vis-
     ions, sweats — the pulse pounding through  
     palms and trembling encirling fingers — the  
     young man all colored, red, ashamed, angry; 
  - The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie  
     willing and naked, 
  - The merriment of the twin-babes that crawl over  
     the grass in the sun, the mother never turn-
     ing her vigilant eyes from them, 
       - The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripen-
     ing or ripened long-round walnuts, 
  - The continence of vegetables, birds, animals, 
  - The consequent meanness of me should I skulk  
     or find myself indecent, while birds and  
     animals never once skulk or find themselves  
     indecent, 
  - The great chastity of paternity, to match the great  
     chastity of maternity, 
  - The oath of procreation I have sworn, 
  - The greed that eats in me day and night with  
     hungry gnaw, till I saturate what shall pro-
     duce boys to fill my place when I am through, 
  - The wholesome relief, repose, content, 
  - And this bunch plucked at random from myself, 
  - It has done its work — I toss it carelessly to fall  
     where it may. 
             
## 29 — Lesson Poem. 

     - WHO learns my lesson complete?  
     Boss, journeyman, apprentice? churchman  
     and atheist? 
  - The stupid and the wise thinker? parents and  
     offspring? merchant, clerk, porter, and cus-
     tomer? editor, author, artist, and school-
     boy? 
  - Draw nigh and commence, 
  - It is no lesson, it lets down the bars to a good  
     lesson, 
  - And that to another, and every one to another  
     still. 
       - The great laws take and effuse without argument, 
  - I am of the same style, for I am their friend, 
  - I love them quits and quits — I do not halt and  
     make salaams. 
       - I lie abstracted and hear beautiful tales of things  
     and the reasons of things, 
  - They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen. 
              - I cannot say to any person what I hear — I  
     cannot say it to myself — it is very won-
     derful. 
       - It is no little matter, this round and delicious globe  
     moving so exactly in its orbit forever and  
     ever without one jolt or the untruth of a  
     single second, 
  - I do not think it was made in six days, nor  
     in ten thousand years, nor ten decillions of  
     years, 
  - Nor planned and built one thing after another, as  
     an architect plans and builds a house. 
       - I do not think seventy years is the time of a man  
     or woman, 
  - Nor that seventy millions of years is the time of a  
     man or woman, 
  - Nor that years will ever stop the existence of me  
     or any one else. 
       - Is it wonderful that I should be immortal? as  
     every one is immortal, 
  - I know it is wonderful — but my eye-sight is  
     equally wonderful, and how I was con-
     ceived in my mother's womb is equally  
     wonderful, 
  - And how I was not palpable once, but am now —  
     and was born on the last day of May in the  
     Year 43 of America — and passed from a 
       - babe, in the creeping trance of three summers  
     and three winters, to articulate and walk —  
     all this is equally wonderful, 
  - And that I grew six feet high, and that I have  
     become a man thirty-six years old in the Year  
     79 of America, and that I am here anyhow,  
     are all equally wonderful, 
  - And that my soul embraces you this hour, and we  
     affect each other without ever seeing each  
     other, and never perhaps to see each other,  
     is every bit as wonderful, 
  - And that I can think such thoughts as these is  
     just as wonderful, 
  - And that I can remind you, and you think them and  
     know them to be true, is just as wonderful, 
  - And that the moon spins round the earth, and on  
     with the earth, is equally wonderful, 
  - And that they balance themselves with the sun  
     and stars is equally wonderful. 
       - Come! I should like to hear you tell me what  
     there is in yourself that is not just as won-
     derful, 
  - And I should like to hear the name of anything  
     between Sunday morning and Saturday night  
     that is not just as wonderful. 
               
## 30 — Poem of The Propositions of Nakedness. 

     - RESPONDEZ! Respondez!  
     Let every one answer! Let all who sleep be  
     waked! Let none evade — not you, any  
     more than others! 
  - Let that which stood in front go behind! and let  
     that which was behind advance to the front  
     and speak! 
  - Let murderers, thieves, tyrants, bigots, unclean  
     persons, offer new propositions! 
  - Let the old propositions be postponed! 
  - Let faces and theories be turned inside out! Let  
     meanings be criminal as well as results!  
     (Say! can results be criminal, and meanings  
     not criminal?) 
  - Let there be no suggestion besides the suggestion  
     of drudgery! 
  - Let none be pointed toward his destination!  
     (Say! do you know your destination?) 
  - Let trillions of men and women be mocked with  
     bodies and mocked with souls! 
            - Let the love that waits in them, wait! Let it die,  
     or pass still-born to other spheres! 
  - Let the sympathy that waits in every man, wait!  
     or let it also pass, a dwarf, to other spheres! 
  - Let contradictions prevail! Let one thing con-
     tradict another! and let one line of my poem  
     contradict another! 
  - Let the people sprawl with yearning aimless  
     hands! Let their tongues be broken! Let their  
     eyes be discouraged! Let none descend into  
     their hearts with the fresh lusciousness of  
     love! 
  - Let the theory of America be management, caste,  
     comparison! (Say! what other theory would  
     you?) 
  - Let them that distrust birth and death lead the  
     rest! (Say! why shall they not lead you?) 
  - Let the crust of hell be neared and trod on! Let  
     the days be darker than the nights! Let  
     slumber bring less slumber than waking-time  
     brings! 
  - Let the world never appear to him or her for  
     whom it was all made! 
  - Let the heart of the young man exile itself from the  
     heart of the old man! and let the heart of the  
     old man be exiled from that of the young man! 
  - Let the sun and moon go! Let scenery take the  
     applause of the audience! Let there be  
     apathy under the stars! 
            - Let freedom prove no man's inalienable right!  
     Every one who can tyrannize, let him tyran-
     nize to his satisfaction! 
  - Let none but infidels be countenanced! 
  - Let the eminence of meanness, treachery,  
     sarcasm, hate, greed, indecency, impotence,  
     lust, be taken for granted above all! Let  
     poems, judges, governments, households,  
     religions, philosophies, take such for granted  
     above all! 
  - Let the worst men beget children out of the worst  
     women! 
  - Let priests still play at immortality! 
  - Let death be inaugurated! 
  - Let nothing remain upon the earth except  
     teachers, artists, moralists, lawyers, and  
     learned and polite persons! 
  - Let him who is without my poems be assas-
     sinated! 
  - Let the cow, the horse, the camel, the garden-bee  
      — Let the mud-fish, the lobster, the mussel,  
     eel, the sting-ray and the grunting pig-
     fish — Let these, and the like of these, be  
     put on a perfect equality with man and  
     woman! 
  - Let churches accommodate serpents, vermin, and  
     the corpses of those who have died of the  
     most filthy of diseases! 
            - Let marriage slip down among fools, and be for  
     none but fools! 
  - Let men among themselves talk obscenely of wo-
     men! and let women among themselves talk  
     obscenely of men! 
  - Let every man doubt every woman! and let every  
     woman trick every man! 
  - Let us all, without missing one, be exposed in pub-
     lic, naked, monthly, at the peril of our lives!  
     Let our bodies be freely handled and examined  
     by whoever chooses! 
  - Let nothing but love-songs, pictures, statues, ele-
     gant works, be permitted to exist upon the earth! 
  - Let the earth desert God, nor let there ever hence-
     forth be mentioned the name of God! 
  - Let there be no God! 
  - Let there be money, business, railroads, imports,  
     exports, custom, authority, precedents, pallor,  
     dyspepsia, smut, ignorance, unbelief! 
  - Let judges and criminals be transposed! Let the  
     prison-keepers be put in prison! Let those  
     that were prisoners take the keys! (Say!  
     why might they not just as well be trans-
     posed?) 
  - Let the slaves be masters! Let the masters  
     become slaves! 
  - Let the reformers descend from the stands where  
     they are forever bawling! Let an idiot or  
     insane person appear on each of the stands! 
            - Let the Asiatic, the African, the European, the  
     American and the Australian, go armed against  
     the murderous stealthiness of each other! Let  
     them sleep armed! Let none believe in good-
     will! 
  - Let there be no living wisdom! Let such be  
     scorned and derided off from the earth! 
  - Let a floating cloud in the sky — Let a wave of  
     the sea — Let one glimpse of your eye-sight  
     upon the landscape or grass — Let growing  
     mint, spinach, onions, tomatoes — Let these  
     be exhibited as shows at a great price for  
     admission! 
  - Let all the men of These States stand aside for a  
     few smouchers! Let the few seize on what  
     they choose! Let the rest gawk, giggle  
     starve, obey! 
  - Let shadows be furnished with genitals! Let  
     substances be deprived of their genitals! 
  - Let there be immense cities — but through any of  
     them, not a single poet, saviour, knower, lover! 
  - Let the infidels of These States laugh all faith  
     away! If one man be found who has faith,  
     let the rest set upon him! Let them affright  
     faith! Let them destroy the power of breed-
     ing faith! 
  - Let the she-hariots and the he-harlots be prudent!  
     Let them dance on, while seeming lasts! (O  
     seeming! seeming! seeming!) 
            - Let the preachers recite creeds! Let the preach-
     ers of creeds never dare to go meditate upon  
     the hills, alone, by day or by night! (If one  
     ever once dare, he is lost!) 
  - Let insanity have charge of sanity! 
  - Let books take the place of trees, animals, rivers,  
     clouds! 
  - Let the portraits of heroes supersede heroes! 
  - Let the manhood of man never take steps after  
     itself! Let it take steps after eunuchs, and  
     after consumptive and genteel persons! 
  - Let the white person tread the black person under  
     his heel! (Say! which is trodden under  
     heel, after all?) 
  - Let the reflections of the things of the world be  
     studied in mirrors! Let the things them-
     selves continue unstudied! 
  - Let a man seek pleasure everywhere except in  
     himself! Let a woman seek happiness  
     everywhere except in herself! (Say! what  
     real happiness have you had one single time  
     through your whole life?) 
  - Let the limited years of life do nothing for the  
     limitless years of death! (Say! what do  
     you suppose death will do, then?) 
             
## 31 — Poem of The Sayers of The Words of The Earth. 

     - EARTH, round, rolling, compact — suns, moons,  
     animals — all these are words, 
  - Watery, vegetable, sauroid advances — beings,  
     premonitions, lispings of the future — these  
     are vast words. 
       - Were you thinking that those were the words —  
     those upright lines? those curves, angles,  
     dots? 
  - No, those are not the words — the substantial  
     words are in the ground and sea, 
  - They are in the air — they are in you. 
       - Were you thinking that those were the words —  
     those delicious sounds out of your friends'  
     mouths? 
  - No, the real words are more delicious than they. 
       - Human bodies are words, myriads of words, 
  - In the best poems re-appears the body, man's or  
     woman's, well-shaped, natural, gay, 
       - Every part able, active, receptive, without shame  
     or the need of shame 
       - Air, soil, water, fire, these are words, 
  - I myself am a word with them — my qualities  
     interpenetrate with theirs — my name is noth-
     ing to them, 
  - Though it were told in the three thousand lan-
     guages, what would air, soil, water, fire,  
     know of my name? 
       - A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding  
     gesture, are words, sayings, meanings, 
  - The charms that go with the mere looks of some  
     men and women are sayings and meanings  
     also. 
       - The workmanship of souls is by the inaudible  
     words of the earth, 
  - The great masters, the sayers, know the earth's  
     words, and use them more than the audible  
     words. 
       - Syllables are not the earth's words, 
  - Beauty, reality, manhood, time, life — the realities  
     of such as these are the earth's words. 
       - Amelioration is one of the earth's words, 
  - The earth neither lags nor hastens, 
       - It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in it-
     self from the jump, 
  - It is not half beautiful only — defects and excres-
     cences show just as much as perfections  
     show. 
       - The earth does not withhold, it is generous  
     enough, 
  - The truths of the earth continually wait, they are  
     not so concealed either, 
  - They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print, 
  - They are imbued through all things, conveying  
     themselves willingly, 
  - Conveying a sentiment and invitation of the earth  
      — I utter and utter, 
  - I speak not, yet if you hear me not, of what avail  
     am I to you? 
  - To bear — to better — lacking these, of what  
     avail am I? 
       - Accouche! Accouchez! 
  - Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there? 
  - Will you squat and stifle there? 
       - The earth does not argue, 
  - Is not pathetic, has no arrangements, 
  - Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten,  
     promise, 
  - Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable  
     failures, 
       - Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out, 
  - Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts  
     none out. 
       - The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to  
     exhibit itself — possesses still underneath, 
  - Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august  
     chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves, 
  - Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying,  
     laughter of young people, accents of bar-
     gainers, 
  - Underneath these possessing the words that never  
     fail. 
       - To her children the words of the eloquent dumb  
     great mother never fail, 
  - The true words do not fail, for motion does not  
     fail, and reflection does not fail, 
  - Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage  
     we pursue does not fail. 
       - Of the interminable sisters, 
  - Of the ceaseless cotillions of sisters, 
  - Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder  
     and younger sisters, 
  - The beautiful sister we know dances on with the  
     rest. 
       - With her ample back toward every beholder, 
       - With the fascinations of youth and the equal fas-
     cinations of age, 
  - Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undis-
     turbed, 
  - Holding up in her hand what has the character 
  - of a mirror, her eyes glancing back from  
     it, 
  - Glancing thence as she sits, inviting none, denying  
     none, 
  - Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before  
     her own face. 
       - Seen at hand, or seen at a distance, 
  - Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day, 
  - Duly approach and pass with their companions, or  
     a companion, 
  - Looking from no countenances of their own, but  
     from the countenances of those who are with  
     them, 
  - From the countenances of children or women, or  
     the manly countenance, 
  - From the open countenances of animals, from in-
     animate things, 
  - From the landscape or waters, or from the exqui-
     site apparition of the sky, 
  - From our own countenances, mine and yours,  
     faithfully returning them, 
  - Every day in public appearing without fail, but  
     never twice with the same companions. 
            - Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three  
     hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the  
     sun, 
  - Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close  
     three hundred and sixty-five offsets of the  
     first, sure and necessary as they. 
       - Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading, 
  - Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding,  
     passing, carrying, 
  - The soul's realization and determination still in-
     heriting, 
  - The liquid vacuum around and ahead still entering  
     and dividing, 
  - No balk retarding, no anchor anchoring, on no  
     rock striking, 
  - Swift, glad, content, unbereaved, nothing losing, 
  - Of all able and ready at any time to give strict  
     account, 
  - The divine ship sails the divine sea. 
       - Whoever you are! motion and reflection are espe-
     cially for you, 
  - The divine ship sails the divine sea for you. 
       - Whoever you are! you are he or she for whom  
     the earth is solid and liquid, 
  - You are he or she for whom the sun and moon  
     hang in the sky, 
       - For none more than you are the present and the  
     past, 
  - For none more than you is immortality. 
       - Each man to himself, and each woman to herself,  
     is the word of the past and present, and the 
  - word of immortality, 
  - Not one can acquire for another — not one! 
  - Not one can grow for another — not one! 
       - The song is to the singer, and comes back most to  
     him, 
  - The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back  
     most to him, 
  - The murder is to the murderer, and comes back  
     most to him, 
  - The theft is to the thief, and comes back most to  
     him, 
  - The love is to the lover, and comes back most to  
     him, 
  - The gift is to the giver, and comes back most to  
     him — it cannot fail, 
  - The oration is to the orator, and the acting is to  
     the actor and actress, not to the audience, 
  - And no man understands any greatness or good-
     ness but his own, or the indication of his  
     own. 
       - I swear the earth shall surely be complete to him  
     or her who shall be complete! 
            - I swear the earth remains broken and jagged only  
     to him or her who remains broken and  
     jagged! 
       - I swear there is no greatness or power that does  
     not emulate those of the earth! 
  - I swear there can be no theory of any account,  
     unless it corroborate the theory of the earth! 
  - No politics, art, religion, behaviour, or what not, is  
     of account, unless it compare with the ampli-
     tude of the earth, 
  - Unless it face the exactness, vitality, impartiality,  
     rectitude of the earth. 
       - I swear I begin to see love with sweeter spasms  
     than that which responds love! 
  - It is that which contains itself, which never in-
     vites and never refuses. 
       - I swear I begin to see little or nothing in audible  
     words! 
  - I swear I think all merges toward the presentation  
     of the unspoken meanings of the earth! 
  - Toward him who sings the songs of the body, and  
     of the truths of the earth, 
  - Toward him who makes the dictionaries of the  
     words that print cannot touch. 
       - I swear I see what is better than to tell the best, 
  - It is always to leave the best untold. 
            - When I undertake to tell the best, I find I can-
     not, 
  - My tongue is ineffectual on its pivots, 
  - My breath will not be obedient to its organs, 
  - I become a dumb man. 
       - The best of the earth cannot be told anyhow — all  
     or any is best, 
  - It is not what you anticipated, it is cheaper, easier,  
     nearer, 
  - Things are not dismissed from the places they  
     held before, 
  - The earth is just as positive and direct as it was  
     before, 
  - Facts, religions, improvements, politics, trades, are  
     as real as before, 
  - But the soul is also real, it too is positive and  
     direct, 
  - No reasoning, no proof has established it, 
  - Undeniable growth has established it. 
       - This is a poem for the sayers of the earth —  
     these are hints of meanings, 
  - These are they that echo the tones of souls, and  
     the phrases of souls; 
  - If they did not echo the phrases of souls, what  
     were they then? 
  - If they had not reference to you in especial, what  
     were they then? 
            - I swear I will never henceforth have to do with  
     the faith that tells the best! 
  - I will have to do with that faith only that leaves  
     the best untold. 
       - Say on, sayers of the earth! 
  - Delve! mould! pile the substantial words of the  
     earth! 
  - Work on, age after age! nothing is to be lost, 
  - It may have to wait long, but it will certainly come  
     in use, 
  - When the materials are all prepared, the archi-
     tects shall appear, 
  - I swear to you the architects shall appear without  
     fail! I announce them and lead them! 
  - I swear to you they will understand you and justify  
     you! 
  - I swear to you the greatest among them shall be  
     he who best knows you, and encloses all, and  
     is faithful to all! 
  - I swear to you, he and the rest shall not forget  
     you! they shall perceive that you are not an  
     iota less than they! 
  - I swear to you, you shall be glorified in them! 
               
## 32 — Burial Poem. 

     - To think of time! to think through the retro-
     spection! 
  - To think of today, and the ages continued hence-
     forward! 
       - Have you guessed you yourself would not con-
     tinue? Have you dreaded those earth-
     beetles? 
  - Have you feared the future would be nothing to  
     you? 
       - Is today nothing? Is the beginningless past  
     nothing? 
  - If the future is nothing, they are just as surely  
     nothing. 
       - To think that the sun rose in the east! that men  
     and women were flexible, real, alive! that  
     every thing was alive! 
  - To think that you and I did not see, feel, think,  
     nor bear our part! 
            - To think that we are now here, and bear our part!
    - Not a day passes, not a minute or second, without  
     an accouchement! 
  - Not a day passes, not a minute or second, without  
     corpse! 
       - The dull nights go over, and the dull days also, 
  - The soreness of lying so much in bed goes over, 
  - The physician, after long putting off, gives the  
     silent and terrible look for an answer, 
  - The children come hurried and weeping, and the  
     brothers and sisters are sent for, 
  - Medicines stand unused on the shelf — the cam-
     phor-smell has pervaded the rooms, 
  - The faithful hand of the living does not desert the  
     hand of the dying, 
  - The twitching lips press lightly on the forehead  
     of the dying, 
  - The breath ceases and the pulse of the heart  
     ceases, 
  - The corpse stretches on the bed, and the living  
     look upon it, 
  - It is palpable as the living are palpable. 
       - The living look upon the corpse with their eye-
     sight, 
  - But without eye-sight lingers a different living,  
     and looks curiously on the corpse. 
              - To think that the rivers will come to flow, and the  
     snow fall, and fruits ripen, and act upon others  
     as upon us now — yet not act upon us! 
  - To think of all these wonders of city and country,  
     and others taking great interest in them — and  
     we taking no interest in them! 
       - To think how eager we are in building our houses! 
  - To think others shall be just as eager, and we  
     quite indifferent! 
       - I see one building the house that serves him a few  
     years, or seventy or eighty years at most, 
  - I see one building the house that serves him longer  
     than that. 
       - Slow-moving and black lines creep over the whole  
     earth — they never cease — they are the  
     burial lines, 
  - He that was President was buried, and he that is  
     now President shall surely be buried. 
       - Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf — posh and  
     ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets,  
     a gray discouraged sky overhead, the short  
     last daylight of December, 
  - A hearse and stages, other vehicles give place —  
     the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver,  
     the cortege mostly drivers. 
            - Rapid the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the  
     death-bell, the gate is passed, the grave is  
     halted at, the living alight, the hearse  
     uncloses, 
  - The coffin is lowered and settled, the whip is laid  
     on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovelled in  
      — a minute, no one moves or speaks — it is  
     done, 
  - He is decently put away — is there anything  
     more? 
       - He was a good fellow, free-mouthed, quick-tem-
     pered, not bad-looking, able to take his own  
     part, witty, sensitive to a slight, ready with  
     life or death for a friend, fond of women,  
     played some, ate hearty, drank hearty, had  
     known what it was to be flush, grew low-
     spirited toward the last, sickened, was helped  
     by a contribution, died aged forty-one years —  
     and that was his funeral. 
       - Thumb extended, finger uplifted, apron, cape,  
     gloves, strap, wet-weather clothes, whip care-
     fully chosen, boss, spotter, starter, hostler,  
     somebody loafing on you, you loafing on  
     somebody, head-way, man before and man  
     behind, good day's work, bad day's work, pet  
     stock, mean stock, first out, last out, turning  
     in at night, 
       - To think that these are so much and so nigh to  
     other drivers — and he there takes no interest  
     in them! 
       - The markets, the government, the working-man's  
     wages — to think what account they are  
     through our nights and days! 
  - To think that other working-men will make just as  
     great account of them — yet we make little  
     or no account! 
       - The vulgar and the refined, what you call sin and  
     what you call goodness — to think how wide  
     a difference! 
  - To think the difference will still continue to oth-
     ers, yet we lie beyond the difference! 
       - To think how much pleasure there is! 
  - Have you pleasure from looking at the sky?  
     have you pleasure from poems? 
  - Do you enjoy yourself in the city? or engaged in  
     business? or planning a nomination and elec-
     tion? or with your wife and family? 
  - Or with your mother and sisters? or in womanly  
     house-work? or the beautiful maternal cares? 
  - These also flow onward to others — you and I  
     flow onward, 
  - But in due time you and I shall take less interest  
     in them. 
            - Your farm, profits, crops — to think how engrossed  
     you are! 
  - To think there will still be farms, profits, crops —  
     yet for you, of what avail? 
       - What will be, will be well — for what is, is well, 
  - To take interest is well, and not to take interest  
     shall be well. 
       - The sky continues beautiful, the pleasure of men  
     with women shall never be sated, nor the  
     pleasure of women with men, nor the pleas-
     ure from poems, 
  - The domestic joys, the daily house-work or busi-
     ness, the building of houses — these are not  
     phantasms, they have weight, form, location; 
  - Farms, profits, crops, markets, wages, government,  
     are none of them phantasms, 
  - The difference between sin and goodness is no  
     delusion, 
  - The earth is not an echo — man and his life, and  
     all the things of his life, are well-considered. 
       - You are not thrown to the winds — you gather  
     certainly and safely around yourself, 
  - Yourself! Yourself! Yourself, forever and ever! 
       - It is not to diffuse you that you were born of your  
     mother and father — it is to identify you, 
         - It is not that you should be undecided, but that  
     you should be decided; 
  - Something long preparing and formless is arrived  
     and formed in you, 
  - You are thenceforth secure, whatever comes or  
     goes. 
       - The threads that were spun are gathered, the weft  
     crosses the warp, the pattern is systematic. 
       - The preparations have every one been justified, 
  - The orchestra have tuned their instruments suffi-
     ciently, the baton has given the signal. 
       - The guest that was coming — he waited long for  
     reasons — he is now housed, 
  - He is one of those who are beautiful and happy —  
     he is one of those that to look upon and be  
     with is enough. 
       - The law of the past cannot be eluded! 
  - The law of the present and future cannot be  
     eluded! 
  - The law of the living cannot be eluded — it is  
     eternal! 
  - The law of promotion and transformation cannot  
     be eluded! 
  - The law of heroes and good-doers cannot be  
     eluded! 
            - The law of drunkards, informers, mean persons,  
     cannot be eluded! 
       - Slow-moving and black lines go ceaselessly over  
     the earth, 
  - Northerner goes carried, and southerner goes car-
     ried, and they on the Atlantic side, and they  
     on the Pacific, and they between, and all  
     through the Mississippi country, and all over  
     the earth. 
       - The great masters and kosmos are well as they  
     go — the heroes and good-doers are well, 
  - The known leaders and inventors, and the rich  
     owners and pious and distinguished, may be  
     well, 
  - But there is more account than that — there is  
     strict account of all. 
       - The interminable hordes of the ignorant and  
     wicked are not nothing, 
  - The barbarians of Africa and Asia are not nothing, 
  - The common people of Europe are not nothing —  
     the American aborigines are not nothing, 
  - The infected in the immigrant hospital are not  
     nothing — the murderer or mean person is  
     not nothing, 
  - The perpetual successions of shallow people are  
     not nothing as they go, 
       - The prostitute is not nothing — the mocker of re-
     ligion is not nothing as he goes. 
       - I shall go with the rest — we have satisfaction, 
  - I have dreamed that we are not to be changed so  
     much, nor the law of us changed, 
  - I have dreamed that heroes and good-doers shall  
     be under the present and past law, 
  - And that murderers, drunkards, liars, shall be  
     under the present and past law, 
  - For I have dreamed that the law they are under  
     now is enough. 
       - And I have dreamed that the satisfaction is not so  
     much changed, and that there is no life  
     without satisfaction; 
  - What is the earth? what are body and soul, with-
     out satisfaction? 
       - I shall go with the rest, 
  - We cannot be stopped at a given point — that is  
     no satisfaction, 
  - To show us a good thing, or a few good things,  
     for a space of time — that is no satisfaction, 
  - We must have the indestructible breed of the best,  
     regardless of time. 
       - If otherwise, all these things came but to ashes  
     of dung, 
       - If maggots and rats ended us, then suspicion,  
     treachery, death. 
       - Do you suspect death? If I were to suspect  
     death, I should die now, 
  - Do you think I could walk pleasantly and well-
     suited toward annihilation? 
       - Pleasantly and well-suited I walk, 
  - Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is  
     good, 
  - The whole universe indicates that it is good, 
  - The past and the present indicate that it is good. 
       - How beautiful and perfect are the animals! How  
     perfect is my soul! 
  - How perfect the earth, and the minutest thing  
     upon it! 
  - What is called good is perfect, and what is called  
     bad is just as perfect, 
  - The vegetables and minerals are all perfect, and  
     the imponderable fluids are perfect; 
  - Slowly and surely they have passed on to this,  
     and slowly and surely they yet pass on. 
       - My soul! if I realize you, I have satisfaction, 
  - Animals and vegetables! if I realize you, I have  
     satisfaction, 
  - Laws of the earth and air! if I realize you, I  
     have satisfaction. 
            - I cannot define my satisfaction, yet it is so, 
  - I cannot define my life, yet it is so. 
       - O I swear I think now that every thing has an  
     eternal soul! 
  - The trees have, rooted in the ground! the weeds  
     of the sea have! the animals! 
       - I swear I think there is nothing but immortality! 
  - That the exquisite scheme is for it, and the nebu-
     lous float is for it, and the cohering is for it! 
  - And all preparation is for it! and identity is for  
     it! and life and death are for it!

## Correspondence.

     
###  *LETTER TO WALT WHITMAN.*

      CONCORD. MASSACHUSETTS,  21 *July,* 1855.    DEAR SIR —      I am not blind to the worth of the wonderful gift of "LEAVES OF GRASS." I find it  the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed. I am very  happy in reading it, as great power makes us happy. It meets the demand I am always making of  what seemed the sterile and stingy nature, as if too much handiwork, or too much lymph in the  temperament, were making our western wits fat and mean.  

   I give you joy of your free and brave thought. I have great joy in it. I find incomparable things  said incomparably well, as they must be. I find the courage of treatment which so delights us, and  which large perception only can inspire.  

   I greet you at the beginning of a great career, which yet must have had a long foreground  somewhere, for such a start. I rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion; but  the solid sense of the book is a sober certainty. It has the best merits, namely, of fortifying and  encouraging.  

   I did not know until I last night saw the book advertised in a newspaper that I could trust the  name as real        and available for a post-office. I wish to see my benefactor, and have felt much like striking my  tasks and visiting New York to pay you my respects.  

    R. W. EMERSON.         
###  *LETTER TO RALPH WALDO EMERSON.* 

      BROOKLYN,  *August,* 1656.       HERE are thirty-two Poems, which I send you, dear Friend and Master, not having found how I  could satisfy myself with sending any usual acknowledgment of your letter. The first edition, on  which you mailed me that till now unanswered letter, was twelve poems — I printed a thousand  copies, and they readily sold; these thirty-two Poems I stereotype, to print several thousand  copies of. I much enjoy making poems. Other work I have set for myself to do, to meet people  and The States face to face, to confront them with an American rude tongue; but the work of my  life is making poems. I keep on till I make a hundred, and then several hundred — perhaps a  thousand. The way is clear to me. A few years, and the average annual call for my Poems is ten  or twenty thousand copies — more, quite likely. Why should I hurry or compromise? In poems or  in speeches I say the word or two that has got to be said, adhere to the body, step with the  countless common footsteps, and remind every man and woman of something.  

   Master, I am a man who has perfect faith. Master, we have not come through centuries, caste,  heroisms, fables, to halt in this land today. Or I think it is to collect a ten-fold impetus that any  halt is made. As nature, inexorable, onward, resistless, impassive amid the threats and sereams of  disputants, so America. Let all defer. Let all      attend respectfully the leisure of These States, their politics, poems, literature, manners, and their  free-handed modes of training their own offspring. Their own comes, just matured, certain,  numerous and capable enough, with egotistical tongues, with sinewed wrists, seizing openly  what belongs to them. They resume Personality, too long left out of mind. Their shadows are  projected in employments, in books, in the cities, in trade; their feet are on the flights of the steps  of the Capitol; they dilate, a larger, brawnier, more candid, more democratic, lawless, positive  native to The States, sweet-bodied, completer, dauntless, flowing, masterful, beard-faced, new  race of men.  

   Swiftly, on limitless foundations, the United States too are founding a literature. It is all as well  done, in my opinion, as could be practicable. Each element here is in condition. Every day I go  among the people of Manhattan Island, Brooklyn, and other cities, and among the young men, to  discover the spirit of them, and to refresh myself. These are to be attended to; I am myself more  drawn here than to those authors, publishers, importations, reprints, and so forth. I pass coolly  through those, understanding them perfectly well. and that they do the indispensable service,  outside of men like me, which nothing else could do. In poems, the young men of The States  shall be represented, for they out-rival the best of the rest of the earth.  

   The lists of ready-made literature which America inherits by the mighty inheritance of the  English language — all the rich repertoire of traditions, poems, historics, metaphysics, plays,  classics, translations, have made, and still continue, magnificent preparations for that other  plainly signified literature, to be our own, to be electric, fresh, lusty, to express the full-sized  body, male and female — to give the modern meanings of things, to grow up beautiful, lasting,  commensurate with America, with all the passions of home, with the inimitable sympathies of  having been      boys and girls together, and of parents who were with our parents.  

   What else can happen The States, even in their own despite? That huge English flow, so sweet,  so undeniable, has done incalculable good here, and is to be spoken of for its own sake with  generous praise and with gratitude. Yet the price The States have had to lie under for the same  has not been a small price. Payment prevails; a nation can never take the issues of the needs of  other nations for nothing. America, grandest of lands in the theory of its politics, in popular  reading, in hospitality, breadth, animal beauty, cities, ships, machines, money, credit, collapses  quick as lightning at the repeated, admonishing, stern words, Where are any mental expressions  from you, beyond what you have copied or stolen? Where the born throngs of poets, literats,  orators, you promised? Will you but tag after other nations? They struggled long for their  literature, painfully working their way, some with deficient languages, some with priest-craft,  some in the endeavor just to live — yet achieved for their times, works, poems, perhaps the only  solid consolation left to them through ages afterward of shame and decay. You are young, have  the perfectest of dialects, a free press, a free government, the world forwarding its best to be with  you. As justice has been strictly done to you, from this hour do strict justice to yourself. Strangle  the singers who will not sing you loud and strong. Open the doors of The West. Call for new  great masters to comprehend new arts, new perfections, new wants. Submit to the most robust  bard till he remedy your barrenness. Then you will not need to adopt the heirs of others; you will  have true heirs, begotten of yourself, blooded with your own blood.  

   With composure I see such propositions, seeing more and more every day of the answers that  serve. Expressions do      not yet serve, for sufficient reasons; but that is getting ready, beyond what the earth has hitherto  known, to take home the expressions when they come, and to identify them with the populace of  The States, which is the schooling cheaply procured by any outlay any number of years. Such  schooling The States extract from the swarms of reprints, and from the current authors and  editors. Such service and extract are done after enormous, reckless, free modes, characteristic of  The States. Here are to be attained results never elsewhere thought possible; the modes are very  grand too. The instincts of the American people are all perfect, and tend to make heroes. It is a  rare thing in a man here to understand The States.  

   All current nourishments to literature serve. Of authors and editors I do not know how many  there are in The States, but there are thousands, each one building his or her step to the stairs by  which giants shall mount. Of the twenty-four modern mammoth two-double, three-double, and  four-double cylinder presses now in the world, printing by steam, twenty-one of them are in  These States. The twelve thousand large and small shops for dispensing books and  newspapers — the same number of public libraries, any one of which has all the reading wanted to  equip a man or woman for American reading — the three thousand different newspapers, the  nutriment of the imperfect ones coming in just as usefully as any — the story papers, various, full  of strong-flavored romances, widely circulated — the onecent and two-cent journals — the political  ones, no matter what side — the weeklies in the country — the sporting and pictorial papers — the  monthly magazines, with plentiful imported feed — the sentimental novels, numberless copies of  them — the low-priced flaring tales, adventures, biographies — all are prophetic; all waft rapidly on.  I see that they swell wide, for reasons. I am not troubled at the movement of them, but greatly  pleased. I see plying       shuttles, the active ephemeral myriads of books also, faithfully weaving the garments of a  generation of men, and a generation of women, they do not perceive or know. What a progress  popular reading and writing has made in fifty years! What a progress fifty years hence! The time  is at hand when inherent literature will be a main part of These States, as general and real as  steam-power, iron, corn, beef, fish. First-rate American persons are to be supplied. Our perennial  materials for fresh thoughts, histories, poems, music, orations, religions, recitations, amusements,  will then not be disregarded, any more than our perennial fields, mines, rivers, seas. Certain   things are established, and are immovable; in those things millions of years stand justified. The  mothers and fathers of whom modern centuries have come, have not existed for nothing; they too  had brains and hearts. Of course all literature, in all nations and years, will share marked  attributes in common, as we all, of all ages, share the common human attributes. America is to be  kept coarse and broad. What is to be done is to withdraw from precedents, and be directed to men  and women — also to The States in their federalness; for the union of the parts of the body is not  more necessary to their life than the union of These States is to their life.  

   A profound person can easily know more of the people than they know of themselves. Always  waiting untold in the souls of the armies of common people, is stuff better than anything that can  possibly appear in the leadership of the same. That gives final verdicts. In every department of  These States, he who travels with a coterie, or with selected persons, or with imitators, or with  infidels, or with the owners of slaves, or with that which is ashamed of the body of a man, or  with that which is ashamed of the body of a woman, or with any thing less than the bravest and  the openest, travels straight for the      slopes of dissolution. The genius of all foreign literature is clipped and cut small, compared to  our genius, and is essentially insulting to our usages, and to the organic compacts of These  States. Old forms, old poems, majestic and proper in their own lands here in this land are exiles;  the air here is very strong. Much that stands well and has a little enough place provided for it in  the small scales of European kingdoms, empires, and the like, here stands haggard, dwarfed,  ludicrous, or has no place little enough provided for it. Authorities, poems, models, laws, names,  imported into America, are useful to America today to destroy them, and so move disencumbered  to great works, great days.  

   Just so long, in our country or any country, as no revolutionists advance, and are backed by the  people, sweeping off the swarms of routine representatives, officers in power, book-makers,  teachers, ecclesiastics, politicians, just so long, I perceive, do they who are in power fairly  represent that country, and remain of use, probably of very great use. To supersede them, when it  is the pleasure of These States, full provision is made; and I say the time has arrived to use it  with a strong hand. Here also the souls of the armies have not only overtaken the souls of the  officer, but passed on, and left the souls of the officers behind out of sight many weeks' journey;  and the souls of the armies now go en-masse without officers. Here also formulas, glosses,  blanks, minutiæ, are choking the throats of the spokesmen to death. Those things most listened  for, certainly those are the things least said. There is not a single History of the World. There is  not one of America, or of the organic compacts of These States, or of Washington, or of  Jefferson, nor of Language, nor any Dictionary of the English Language. There is no great  author; every one has demeaned himself to some etiquette or some impotence. There is no  manhood or life-power in poems; there are shoats and      geldings more like. Or literature will be dressed up, a fine gentleman, distasteful to our instincts,  foreign to our soil. Its neck bends right and left wherever it goes. Its costumes and jewelry prove  how little it knows Nature. Its flesh is soft; it shows less and less of the indefinable hard  something that is Nature. Where is any thing but the shaved Nature of synods and schools?  Where is a savage and luxuriant man? Where is an overseer? In lives, in poems, in codes of law,  in Congress, in tuitions, theatres, conversations, argumentations, not a single head lifts itself  clean out, with proof that it is their master, and has subordinated them to itself, and is ready to try  their superiors. None believes in These States, boldly illustrating them in himself. Not a man  faces round at the rest with terrible negative voice, refusing all terms to be bought off from his  own eye-sight, or from the soul that he is, or from friendship, or from the body that he is, or from  the soil and sea. To creeds, literature, art, the army, the navy, the executive, life is hardly  proposed, but the sick and dying are proposed to cure the sick and dying. The churches are one  vast lie; the people do not believe them, and they do not believe themselves; the priests are  continually telling what they know well enough is not so, and keeping back what they know is  so. The spectacle is a pitiful one. I think there can never be again upon the festive earth more  bad-disordered persons deliberately taking seats, as of late in These States, at the heads of the  public tables — such corpses' eyes for judges — such a rascal and thief in the Presidency.  

   Up to the present, as helps best, the people, like a lot of large boys, have no determined tastes,  are quite unaware of the grandeur of themselves, and of their destiny, and of their immense  strides — accept with voracity whatever is presented them in novels, histories, newspapers, poems,  schools, lectures, every thing. Pretty soon, through these      and other means, their development makes the fibre that is capable of itself, and will assume  determined tastes. The young men will be clear what they want, and will have it. They will  follow none except him whose spirit leads them in the like spirit with themselves. Any such man  will be welcome as the flowers of May. Others will be put out without ceremony. How much is  there anyhow, to the young men of These States, in a parcel of helpless dandies, who can neither  fight, work, shoot, ride, run, command — some of them devout, some quite insane, some  castrated — all second-hand, or third, fourth, or fifth hand — waited upon by waiters, putting not this  land first, but always other lands first, talking of art, doing the most ridiculous things for fear of  being called ridiculous, smirking and skipping along, continually taking off their hats — no one  behaving, dressing, writing, talking, loving, out of any natural and manly tastes of his own, but  each one looking cautiously to see how the rest behave, dress, write, talk, love — pressing the  noses of dead books upon themselves and upon their country — favoring no poets, philosophs,  literats here, but dog-like danglers at the heels of the poets, philosophs, literats, of  enemies'lands — favoring mental expressions, models of gentlemen and ladies, social habitudes in  These States, to grow up in sneaking defiance of the popular substratums of The States? Of  course they and the likes of them can never justify the strong poems of America. Of course no  feed of theirs is to stop and be made welcome to muscle the bodies, male and female, for  Manhattan Island, Brooklyn, Boston, Worcester, Hartford, Portland, Montreal, Detroit, Buffalo,  Cleaveland, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Indianapolis, Chicago, Cincinnati, Iowa City, Philadelphia,  Baltimore, Releigh, Savannah, Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, Brownsville, San  Francisco, Havana, and a thousand equal cities, present and to come. Of course what they and the  likes of them have been used for, draws toward its close,      after which they will all be discharged, and not one of them will ever be heard of any more.  

   America, having duly conceived, bears out of herself offspring of her own to do the  workmanship wanted. To freedom, to strength, to poems, to personal greatness, it is never  permitted to rest, not a generation or part of a generation. To be ripe beyond further increase is to  prepare to die. The architects of These States laid their foundations, and passed to further,  spheres. What they laid is a work done; as much more remains. Now are needed other architects,  whose duty is not less difficult, but perhaps more difficult. Each age forever needs architects.  America is not finished, perhaps never will be; now America is a divine true sketch. There are  Thirty-Two States sketched — the population thirty millions. In a few years there will be Fifty  States. Again in a few years there will be A Hundred States, the population hundreds of millions,  the freshest and freest of men. Of course such men stand to nothing less than the freshest and  freest expression.  

   Poets here, literats here, are to rest on organic different bases from other countries; not a class set  apart, circling only in the circle of themselves, modest and pretty, desperately scratching for  rhymes, pallid with white paper, shut off, aware of the old pictures and traditions of the race, but  unaware of the actual race around them — not breeding in and in among each other till they all  have the scrofula. Lands of ensemble, bards of ensemble! Walking freely out from the old  traditions, as our politics has walked out, American poets and literats recognize nothing behind  them superior to what is present with them — recognize with joy the sturdy living forms of the  men and women of These States, the divinity of sex, the perfect eligibility of the female with the  male, all The States, liberty and equality, real articles, the different trades, mechanics, the      young fellows of Manhattan Island, customs, instincts, slang, Wisconsin, Georgia, the noble  Southern heart, the hot blood, the spirit that will be nothing less than master, the filibuster spirit,  the Western man, native-born perceptions, the eye for forms, the perfect models of made things,  the wild smack of freedom, California, money, electrictelegraphs, free-trade, iron and the iron  mines — recognize without demur those splendid resistless black poems, the steam-ships of the  sea-board states, and those other resistless splendid poems, the locomotives, followed through  the interior states by trains of rail-road cars.  

   A word remains to be said, as of one ever present, not yet permitted to be acknowledged,  discarded or made dumb by literature, and the results apparent. To the lack of an avowed,  empowered, unabashed development of sex, (the only salvation for the same,) and to the fact of  speakers and writers fraudulently assuming as always dead what every one knows to be always  alive, is attributable the remarkable non-personality and indistinctness of modern productions in  books, art, talk; also that in the scanned lives of men and women most of them appear to have  béen for some time past of the neuter gender; and also the stinging fact that in orthodox society  today. if the dresses were changed, the men might easily pass for women and the women for  men.  

   Infidelism usurps most with fœtid polite face; among the rest infidelism about sex. By silence or  obedience the pens of savans, poets, historians, biographers, and the rest, have long connived at  the filthy law, and books enslaved to it, that what makes the manhood of a man, that sex,  womanhood, maternity, desires, lusty animations, organs, acts, are unmentionable and to be  ashamed of, to be driven to skulk out of literature with whatever belongs to them. This filthy law  has to be repealed — it stands in the way of great reforms. Of women just as much as      men, it is the interest that there should not be infidelism about sex, but perfect faith. Women in  These States approach the day of that organic equality with men, without which, I see, men  cannot have organic equality among themselves. This empty dish, gallantry, will then be filled  with something. This tepid wash, this diluted deferential love, as in songs, fictions, and so forth,  is enough to make a man vomit; as to manly friendship, everywhere observed in The States, there  is not the first breath of it to be observed in print. I say that the body of a man or woman, the  main matter, is so far quite unexpressed in poems; but that the body is to be expressed, and sex  is. Of bards for These States, if it come to a question, it is whether they shall celebrate in poems  the eternal decency of the amativeness of Nature, the motherhood of all, or whether they shall be  the bards of the fashionable delusion of the inherent nastiness of sex, and of the feeble and  querulous modesty of deprivation. This is important in poems, because the whole of the other  expressions of a nation are but flanges out of its great poems. To me, henceforth, that theory of  any thing, no matter what, stagnates in its vitals, cowardly and rotten, while it cannot publicly  accept, and publicly name, with specific words, the things on which all existence, all souls, all  realization, all decency, all health, all that is worth being here for, all of woman and of man, all  beauty, all purity, all sweetness, all friendship, all strength, all life, all immortality depend. The  courageous soul, for a year or two to come, may be proved by faith in sex, and by disdaining  concessions.  

   To poets and literats — to every woman and man, today or any day, the conditions of the present,  needs, dangers, prejudices, and the like, are the perfect conditions on which we are here, and the  conditions for wording the future with undissuadable words. These States, receivers of      the stamina of past ages and lands, initiate the outlines of repayment a thousand fold. They fetch  the American great masters, waited for by old worlds and new, who accept evil as well as good,  ignorance as well as erudition, black as soon as white, foreign-born materials as well as  home-born, reject none, force discrepancies into range, surround the whole, concentrate them on  present periods and places, show the application to each and any one's body and soul, and show  the true use of precedents. Always America will be agitated and turbulent. This day it is taking  shape, not to be less so, but to be more so, stormily, capriciously, on native principles, with such  vast proportions of parts! As for me, I love screaming, wrestling, boiling-hot days.  

   Of course, we shall have a national character, an identity. As it ought to be, and as soon as it  ought to be, it will be. That, with much else, takes care of itself, is a result, and the cause of  greater results. With Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Oregon — with the states around the Mexican  sea — with cheerfully welcomed immigrants from Europe, Asia, Africa — with Connecticut,  Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island — with all varied interests, facts, beliefs, parties,  genesis — there is being fused a determined character, fit for the broadest use for the freewomen  and freemen of Tho States, accomplished and to be accomplished, without any exception  whatever — each indeed free, each idiomatic, as becomes live states and men, but each adhering to  one enclosing general form of politics, manners, talk, personal style, as the plenteous varieties of  the race adhere to one physical form. Such character is the brain and spine to all, including  literature, including poems. Such character, strong, limber, just, open-mouthed,  American-blooded, full of pride, full of ease, of passionate friendliness, is to stand compact upon  that vast basis of the supremacy of Individuality — that new moral      American continent without which, I see, the physical continent remained incomplete, may-be a  carcass, a bloat — that newer America, answering face to face with The States, with ever-satisfying  and ever-unsurveyable seas and shores.  

   Those shores you found. I say you have led The States there — have led Me there. I say that none  has ever done, or ever can do, a greater deed for The States, than your deed. Others may line out  the lines, build cities, work mines, break up farms; it is yours to have been the original true  Captain who put to sea, intuitive, positive, rendering the first report, to be told less by any report,  and more by the mariners of a thousand bays, in each tack of their arriving and departing, many  years after you.  

   Receive, dear Master, these statements and assurances through me, for all the young men, and for  an earnest that we know none before you, but the best following you; and that we demand to take  your name into our keeping, and that we understand what you have indicated, and find the same  indicated in ourselves, and that we will stick to it and enlarge upon it through These States.  

    WALT WHITMAN.                
## Opinions. 1855-6.

     
###     *From the London  Weekly Dispatch*. (*London,  England*.)  LEAVES OF GRASS. By Walt Whitman. Horsell, Oxford Street.  

   WE have before us one of the most extraordinary specimens of Yankee intelligence and  American eccentricity in authorship, it is possible to conceive. It is of a *genus* so peculiar  as to embarrass us, and has an air at once so novel, so audacious, and so strange as to verge upon  absurdity, and yet it would be an injustice to pronounce it so, as the work is saved from this  extreme by a certain mastery over diction not very easy of definition. What Emerson has  pronounced to be good must not be lightly treated, and before we pronounce upon the merits of  this performance it is but right to examine them. We have, then, a series of pithy prose sentences  strung together — forming twelve grand divisions in all, but which, having a rude rhymical  cadence about them, admit of the designation poetical being applied. They are destitute of rhyme,  measure of feet, and the like, every condition under which poetry is generally understood to exist  being absent; but in their strength of expression, their fervor, hearty wholesomeness, their  originality, mannerism, and freshness, one finds in them a singular harmony and flow, as if by  reading, they gradually formed themselves into melody, and adopted characteristics peculiar and  appropriate to themselves alone. If, however, some sentences be fine, there are others altogether  laughable; nevertheless, in the bare strength, the unhesitating frankness of a man who "believes  in the flesh and the appetites," and who dares to call simplest things by their plainest names,  conveying also a large sense of the beautiful, and with an emphasis which gives a clearer  conception of what manly modesty really is than any thing we have, in all conventional forms of  word, deed, or act so far known of, that we rid ourselves, little by little, of the      strangeness with which we greet this bluff new-comer, and, beginning to understand him better,  appreciate him in proportion as he becomes more known. He will soon make his way into the  confidence of his readers, and his poems in time will become a pregnant text-book, out of which  quotation as sterling as the minted gold will be taken and applied to every form and phase of the  "inner" or the "outer" life; and we express our pleasure in making the acquaintance of Walt  Whitman, hoping to know more of him in time to come.  

       
###       *From the Brooklyn Daily Times*.      LEAVES OF GRASS. A volume of Poems, just published.    

   To give judgment on real poems, one needs an account of the poet himself. Very devilish to  some, and very divine to some, will appear the poet of these new poems, the "LEAVES OF  GRASS," an attempt, as they are, of a naive, masculine, affectionate, contemplative, sensual,  imperious person, to cast into literature not only his own grit and arrogance, but his own flesh  and form, undraped, regardless of models, regardless of modesty or law, and ignorant or silently  scornful, as at first appears, of all except his own presence and experience, and all outside the  fiercely loved land of his birth, and the birth of his parents and their parents for several  generations before him. Politeness this man has none, and regulation he has none. A rude child of  the people! — No imitation — No foreigner — but a growth and idiom of America. No discontented — a  careless slouch, enjoying to-day. No dilletant democrat — a man who is art-and-part with the  commonalty, and with immediate life — loves the streets — loves the docks — loves the free rasping  talk of men — likes to be called by his given name, and nobody at all need Mr him — can laugh with  laughers — likes the cheap ways of laborers — is not prejudiced one mite against the Irish — talks  readily with them — talks readily with niggers — does not make a stand on being a gentleman, nor  on learning or manners — eats cheap fare, likes the strong-flavored coffee of the coffee-stands in  the market, at sunrise — likes a supper of oysters fresh from the oyster-smack — likes to make one at  the crowded table among sailors and workpeople — would leave a select soiree of elegant people  any time to go with tumultuous men,      roughs, receive their caresses and welcome, listen to their noise, oaths, smut, fluency, laughter,  repartee — and can preserve his presence perfectly among these, and the like of these. The effects  he produces in his poems are no effects of artists or the arts, but effects of the original eye or  arm, or the actual atmosphere or tree or bird. You may feel the unconscious teaching of a fine  brute, but will never feel the teaching of a fine writer or speaker.  

   Other poets celebrate great events, personages, romances, wars, loves, passions, the victories and  power of their country, or some real or imagined incident — and polish their work, and come to  conclusions, and satisfy the reader. This poet celebrates himself; and that is the way he celebrates  all. He comes to no conclusions, and does not satisfy the reader. He certainly leaves him what the  serpent left the woman and the man, the taste of the Paradisaic tree of the knowledge of good and  evil, never to be erased again.  

   What good is it to argue about egotism? There can be no two thoughts on Walt Whitman's  egotism. That is avowedly what he steps out of the crowd and turns and faces them for. Mark,  critics! Otherwise is not used for you the key that leads to the use of the other keys to this  well-enveloped man. His whole work, his life, manners, friendships, writings, all have among  their leading purposes an evident purpose to stamp a new type of character, namely his own, and  indelibly fix it and publish it, not for a model but an illustration, for the present and future of  American letters and American young men, for the south the same as the north, and for the  Pacific and Mississippi country, and Wisconsin and Texas and Kansas and Canada and Havana  and Nicaragua, just as much as New York and Boston. Whatever is needed toward this  achievement he puts his hand to, and lets imputations take their time to die.  

   First be yourself what you would show in your poem — such seems to be this man's example and  inferred rebuke to the schools of poets. He makes no allusions to books or writers; their spirits do  not seem to have touched him; he has not a word to say for or against them, or their theories or  ways. He never offers others; what he continually offers is the man whom our Brooklynites know  so well. Of pure American breed, large and lusty — age thirty-six years, (1855,) — never once using  medicine — never dressed in black, always dressed freely and clean in strong clothes —        neck open, shirt-collar flat and broad, countenance tawny transparent red, beard well-mottled  with white, hair like hay after it has been mowed in the field and lies tossed and streaked — his  physiology corroborating a rugged phrenology   — a spirit  that mixes cheerfully with the world — a person singularly beloved and looked toward, especially  by young men and the illiterate — one who has firm attachments there, and associates there — one  who does not associate with literary people — a man never called upon to make speeches at public  dinners, never on platforms amid the crowds of clergymen, or professors, or aldermen, or  congressmen — rather down in the bay with pilots in their pilot-boat — or off on a cruise with  fishers in a fishing smack — or with a band of loungers over the open grounds of the country — fond  of New York and Brooklyn — fond of the life of the great ferries, or along Broadway, observing  the endless wonders of that thoroughfare of the world — One whom, if you would meet, you need  not expect to meet an extraordinary person — one in whom you will see the singularity which  consists in no singularity — whose contact is no dazzle or fascination, nor requires any deference,  but has the easy fascination of what is homely and accustomed — of something you knew before,  and was waiting for — of natural pleasures, and well-known places, and welcome familiar  faces — there you have Walt Whitman, the begetter of a new offspring out of literature, taking with  easy nonchalance the chances of      its present reception, and, through all misunderstandings and distrusts, the chances of its future  reception — preferring always to speak for himself rather than have others speak for him.  

       
###       *From the Christian Spiritualist*.      LEAVES OF GRASS.  

   Carlyle represents a cotemporary reviewer taking leave of the Belles-Lettres department  somewhat in this abrupt manner: "The end having come, it is fit that we end — Poetry having  ceased to be read, or published, or written, how can it continue to be reviewed? With your Lake  Schools, and Border-Thief Schools, and Cockney and Satanic Schools, there has been enough to  do; and now, all these Schools having burnt or smouldered themselves out, and left nothing but a  wide-spread wreck of ashes, dust, and cinders — or perhaps dying embers, kicked to and fro under  the feet of innumerable women and children in the magazines, and at best blown here and there  into transient sputters, what remains but to adjust ourselves to circumstances? Urge me not,"  continues this desperate *Literateur,* "with considerations that Poetry, as the inward Voice  of Life, must be perennial, only dead in one form to become alive in another; that this still  abundant deluge of Metre, seeing there must needs be fractions of Poetry floating, scattered in it,  ought still to be net-fished, at all events, surveyed and taken note of. The survey of English  metre, at this epoch, perhaps transcends the human faculties; to hire out the reading of it by  estimate, at a remunerative rate per page, would, in a few quarters, reduce the cashbox of any  extant review to the verge of insolvency."  

   Such is the humorous but essentially truthful picture of the condition and product of the creative  faculties during the second quarter of the present century. The great poets, Byron, Shelley,  Wordsworth, Goethe, and Schiller, had fulfilled their tasks and gone to other spheres; and all that  remained, with few exceptions, were weak and feeble echoes of their dying strains, caught up  and repeated by numerous imitators and pretenders. And so has it ever been; the visions and  perceptions of one man become the creed and superficial life-element of other minds.  Swedenborg is worthy to be enrolled among the master-minds of the world, because he entered  for himself into the Arcana      of the profoundest mysteries that can concern human intelligences; his great thoughts are  revolved, quoted, and represented in all "New Church" publications, but very rarely digested and  assimilated by those who claim to be his followers. Still more rare is it to find any receiver of  "the heavenly doctrines" determined to enter for himself into the very interiors of all that  Swedenborg taught — to see, not the mighty reflections that Swedenborg was able to give of  interior realities, but their originals, as they stand constellated in the heavens!  

   But Divine Providence, leading forth the race, as a father the tottering steps of his children,  causes the outward form on which all men are prone to rely, to be forever changing and passing  away before their eyes. The seeds of death are ever found lurking in the fairest external  appearances, till those externals become the mere correspondences and representatives of interior  realities, and then, though enduring as the fadeless garments of the blest, they are ever-varying,  as those robes of light change with each changing state. The Coming Age will recognize the  profoundest truths in the internal thought of the Swedish sage, while his most tenacious  adherents will be forced to admit that, in externals, he often erred, and was not unfrequently  deceived. But the discovered error will not only wean them from a blind and bigoted reliance  upon frail man, but confirm the sincere lovers of truth in loyalty to her standard. So, also, the  Spiritualists are being taught a severe but salutary lesson, that if they will penetrate into the  heavenly Arcana of the Inner Life, they must do so by purifying and elevating their own minds,  and not by "sitting in circles" or ransacking town and country to find the most "reliable  Mediums." Still no step in human progress and development is in vain; even the falls of the child  are essential to its discipline. The mistakes and errors of men are needful while in their present  imperfect state. They are to the seekers of truth what trials and losses are to those in the pursuit  of wealth; they but enhance the value of the prize, and confirm the devotion of the true aspirant,  as frowns rekindle the ardor of lovers.  

   Moreover, as man must ever enter into the kingdom of a new unfolding truth with the simplicity  and teachableness of little children, it is well that the outer form of the old disappear, that the  new may stand alone in its place. It seems also to be a Law that when a change entire and  universal      is to be outwrought, the means preparatory to its introduction shall be equally wide-spreads, and  ultimated to the lowest possible plane. Hence the Spiritual manifestations meet the most external  minds; and allow even the unregenerate to know by experience the fact and process of Spiritual  inspiration; so that skepticism becomes impossible to the candid and living mind. The second  step will be, after such have been convinced that Spiritual intercourse is possible, that they learn  that it is worse than useless for the purpose of attaining any thing desirable, beyond this  conviction — except so far as is orderly and directed, not by the will of man, but of God. But as the  old form of poetic inspiration died out with Byron and Shelley, Wordsworth and Goethe, and as  the miscellaneous Spirit-intercourse itself, also as quickly passes away, there will, we apprehend,  spring up forms of mediatorial inspiration, of which there will be two permanent types. The first  and highest, as it seems to us, will be the opening of the interiors to direct influx to the inspiring  sources of love and wisdom. The heavens will flow down into the hearts and lives, into the  thought and speech of harmonic natures, as the silent dews impregnate the patient earth. Men  will live in heaven, hence they must be inspired by that breath of life that fills its ethereal  expanse. A second class of Media will be used for the ultimation, for ends of use and in  accordance with Laws of Order, of the creative thoughts and hymns, the Epics and Lyrics, of  individual Spirits and societies of Spirits. These will be to the former Media as the youthful artist  who copies the work of a master to the Angelos and Raphaels, who both design and execute their  plans, though they themselves, in their deepest interiors, are instructed and sustained from  above.  

   But in the transition period in which we now are, many varieties of Mediumship must be  expected. There are those who stand in rapport with the diseased mentalities of the past and  present, and pour forth as Divine Revelations the froth and scum of a receding age; they are the  sponges who absorb the waste and impurities of humanity. They are also like running sores that  gather the corrupt humors and drain the body of its most noxious fluids. There are others who  come in contact with the outmost portion of the Spirit-life. These give crude, and in themselves,  false notions of the state of man after death; yet they prepare the way for more truthful  disclosures; if in no other way      by stimulating the appetite for more substantial nourishment. There are those also who are lifted  by genial inspirations to receive influxes from the upper mind-sphere of the age. They stand, as it  were, on clear mountains of intellectual elevation, and with keenest perception discern the purer  forms of new unfolding truths ere they become sufficiently embodied to be manifest to the  grosser minds of the race. Of these, Ralph Waldo Emerson is the highest type. He sees the future  of truths as our Spirit-seers discern the future of man; he welcomes those impalpable forms, as  Spiritualists receive with gladdened minds the returning hosts of Spirit-friends.  

   There are other mediatorial natures who are in mental and heart-sympathy with man, as he now  is, struggling to free himself from the tyranny of the old and effete, and to grasp and retain the  new life flowing down from the heavens. And as the kindling rays at first produce more smoke  than fire, so their lay is one of promise rather than performance. Such we conceive to be the  interior condition of the author of "LEAVES OF GRASS." He accepts man as he is as to his  whole nature, and all men as his own brothers. The lambent flame of his genius encircles the  world — nor does he clearly discern between that which is to be preserved and that which is but as  fuel for the purification of the ore from its dross. There is a wild strength, a Spartan simplicity  about the man, and he stalks among the dapper gentlemen of this generation, like a drunken  Hercules amid the dainty dancers. That his song is highly mediatorial, he himself asserts, though  probably he is unacquainted with the Spiritual developments of the age.  

   - "Through me," he sings, "many long dumb voices, 
  - Voices of the interminable generations of slaves, 
  - Voices of the diseased and despairing, 
  - Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion, 
  - And of threads that connect the stars, 
  - And of the rights of them the others are down upon. 
  - Through me forbidden voices — voices velled, 
  - Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigured." 
     We omit much even in this short extract, for the book abounds in passages that can not be quoted  in drawing-rooms, and expressions that fall upon the tympanums of ears polite, with a terrible  dissonance. His very gait, as he walks through the world, makes dainty people nervous, and  conservatives regard him as a social revolution. His      style is everywhere graphic and strong, and he sings many things before untouched in prose or  rhyme, in an idiom that is neither prose nor rhyme, nor yet orthodox blank verse. But it serves his  purpose well. He wears his strange garb, cut and made by himself, as gracefully as a South  American cavalier his poncho. We will continue our quotations.  

   (*Extract of several pages*)  

   Such are the graphic pictures which this new world-painter flings from his easel and dashes upon  the moving panorama of life. His night-thoughts are not less striking, as, borne by the Muse, he  looks into every chamber, and hears the quiet breathing of slumbering humanity.  

   As the volume advances toward its conclusion, the Spirit of the poet becomes calmer and more  serenely elevated. But everywhere his sympathy is with *man,* and not with  conventionalisms.  

   We can not take leave of this remarkable volume without advising our friends, who are not too  delicately nerved, to study the work as a sign of the times, written, as we perceive, under  powerful influxes; a prophecy and promise of much that awaits all who are entering with us into  the opening doors of a new Era. A portion of that thought, which broods over the American  nation, is here seized and bodied forth by a son of the people, rudely, wildly, and with some  perversions, yet strongly and genuinely, according to the perception of this bold writer. He is the  young Hercules who has seized the serpents that would make him and us their prey; but instead  of strangling, he would change them to winged and beautiful forms, who shall become the  servants of mankind.

   WALT WHITMAN'S LEAVES OF GRASS. — Our account of the last month's literature would  be incomplete without some notice of a curious and lawless collection of poems, called  "LEAVES OF GRASS," and issued in a thin quarto, without the name of publisher or author.  The poems, twelve in number, are neither in rhyme nor blank verse, but in a sort of excited prose  broken into lines without any attempt at measure or regularity, and, as many readers will perhaps  think, without any idea of sense or reason. The writer's      scorn for the wonted usages of good writing, extends to the vocabulary he adopts; words usually  banished from polite society are here employed without reserve and with perfect indifference as  to their effect on the reader's mind; and not only is the book one not to be read aloud to a mixed  audience, but the introduction of terms, never before heard or seen, and of slang expressions,  often renders an otherwise striking passage altogether laughable. But, as the writer is a new light  in poetry, it is only fair to let him state his theory for himself. We extract from the preface:  

  (*Extract*.)  

   The application of these principles, and of many others equally peculiar, which are expounded in  a style equally oracular throughout the long preface — is made *passim,* and often with  comical success, in the poems themselves, which may briefly be described as a compound of the  New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy. A fireman or omnibus driver, who had  intelligence enough to absorb the speculations of that school of thought which culminated at  Boston some fifteen or eighteen years ago, and resources of expression to put them forth again in  a form of his own, with sufficient self-conceit and contempt for public taste to affront all usual  propriety of diction, might have written this gross yet elevated, this superficial yet profound, this  preposterous yet somehow fascinating book. As we say, it is a mixture of Yankee  transcendentalism and New York rowdyism, and, what must be surprising to both these  elements, they here seem to fuse and combine with the most perfect harmony. The vast and  vague conceptions of the one, lose nothing of their quality in passing through the coarse and odd  intellectual medium of the other; while there is an original perception of nature, a manly brawn,  and an epic directness in our new poet, which belong to no other adept of the transcendental  school. But we have no intention of regularly criticizing this very irregular production; our aim is  rather to coll, from the rough and ragged thicket of its pages, a few passages equally remarkable  in point of thought and expression. Of course we do not select those which are the most  transcendental or the most bold.  

  (*Extracts*.)  

   As seems very proper in a book of transcendental poetry, the author withholds his name from the  title-page, and     presents his portrait, neatly engraved on steel, instead. This no doubt, is upon the principle that  the name is morely accidental; while the portrait affords an idea of the essential being from  whom these utterances proceed. We must add, however, that this significant reticence does not  prevail throughout the volume, for we learn on p. 29, that our poet is "Walt Whitman, an  American, one of the roughs, a kosmos." That he was an American, we knew before, for, aside  from America, there is no quarter of the universe where such a production could have had a  genesis. That he was one of the roughs was also tolerably plain; but that he was a kosmos, is a  piece of news we were hardly prepared for. Precisely what a kosmos is, we hope Walt Whitman  will take early occasion to inform the impatient public.

     LEAVES OF GRASS. Poems by WALT WHITMAN. Brooklyn, 1855. MAUD, and other  Poems. By ALFEED TENNYSON. London, 1855.    

   It is always reserved for second-rate poems immediately to gratify. As first-rate or natural  objects, in their perfect simplicity and proportion, do not startle or strike, but appear no more  than matters of course, so probably natural poetry does not, for all its being the rarest, and telling  of the longest and largest work. The artist or writer whose talent is to please the connoisseurs of  his time, may obey the laws of his time, and achieve the intense and elaborated beauty of parts.  The perfect poet cannot afford any special beauty of parts, or to limit himself by any laws less  than those universal ones of the great masters, which include all times, and all men and women,  and the living and the dead. For from the study of the universe is drawn this irrefragable truth,  that the law of the requisites of a grand poem, or any other complete workmanship, is originality,  and the average and superb beauty of the ensemble. Possessed with this law, the fitness of aim,  time, persons, places, surely follows. Possessed with this law, and doing justice to it, no poet or  any one else will make anything ungraceful or mean, any more than any emanation of nature  is.  

   The poetry of England, by the many rich geniuses of      that wonderful little island, has grown out of the facts of the English race, the monarchy and  aristocracy prominent over the rest, and conforms to the spirit of them. No nation ever did or  ever will receive with national affection any poets except those born of its national blood. Of  these, the writings express the finest infusions of government, traditions, faith, and the  dependence or independence of a people, and even the good or bad physiognomy, and the ample  or small geography. Thus what very properly fits a subject of the British crown may fit very ill  an American freeman. No fine romance, no inimitable delineation of character, no grace of  delicate illustrations, no rare picture of shore or mountain or sky, no deep thought of the intellect,  is so important to a man as his opinion of himself is; every thing receives its tinge from that. In  the verse of all those undoubtedly great writers, Shakspeare just as much as the rest, there is the  air which to America is the air of death. The mass of the people, the laborers and all who serve,  are slag, refuse. The countenances of kings and great lords are beautiful; the countenances of  mechanics are ridiculous and deformed. What play of Shakspeare, represented in America, is not  an insult to America, to the marrow in its bones? How can the tone never silent in their plots and  characters be applauded, unless Washington should have been caught and hung, and Jefferson  was the most enormous of liars, and common persons north and south should bow low to their  betters, and to organic superiority of blood? Sure as the heavens envelop the earth, if the  Americans want a race of bards worthy of 1855, and of the stern reality of this republic, they  must cast around for men essentially different from the old poets, and from the modern  successions of jinglers and snivellers and fops.  

   English versification is full of these danglers, and America follows after them. Every body writes  poetry, and yet there is not a single poet. An age greater than the proudest of the past is swiftly  slipping away, without one lyric voice to seize its greatness and speak it as an encouragement  and onward lesson. We have heard, by many grand announcements, that he was to come; but will  he come?  

   - A mighty Poet whom this age shall choose 
  - To be its spokesman to all coming times. 
  - In the ripe full-blown season of his soul, 
  - He shall go forward in his spirit's strength,
         

      - And grapple with the questions of all time, 
  - And wring from them their meanings. As King Saul 
  - Called up the buried prophet from his grave 
  - To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king 
  - Call up the dread past from its awful grave 
  - To tell him of our future. As the air 
  - Doth sphere the world, so shall his heart of love — 
  - Loving mankind, not peoples. As the lake 
  - Reflects the flower, tree, rock, and bending heaven, 
  - Shall he reflect our great humanity; 
  - And as the young Spring breathes with living breath 
  - On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly 
  - Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life 
  - Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty 
  - And Poetry forever like the stars. (*Alexander Smith*.) 
      The best of the school of poets at present received in Great Britain and America is Alfred  Tennyson. He is the bard of ennui and of the aristocracy and their combination into love. This  love is the old stock love of playwrights and romancers, Shakspeare the same as the rest. It is  possessed of the same unnatural and shocking passion for some girl or woman, that wrenches it  from its manhood, emasculated and impotent, without strength to hold the rest of the objects and  goods of life in their proper positions. It seeks nature for sickly uses. It goes screaming and  weeping after the facts of the universe, in their calm beauty and equanimity, to note the  occurrence of itself, and to sound the news, in connection with the charms of the neck, hair, or  complexion of a particular female.  

   Poetry, to Tennyson and his British and American eleves, is a gentleman of the first degree,  boating, fishing, and shooting genteelly through nature, admiring the ladies, and talking to them  in company with that elaborate halfchoked deference that is to be made up by the terrible license  of men among themselves. The spirit of the burnished society of upper-class England fills this  writer and his effusions from top to toe. Like that, he does not ignore courage and the superior  qualities of men, but all is to show forth through dandified forms. He meets the nobility and  gentry half-way. The models are the same both to the poet and the parlors. Both have the same  supercilious elegance, both love the reminiscences which extol caste, both agree on the topics  proper for mention and discussion, both hold the same undertone of church and state, both have  the same languishing melancholy and irony, both indulge largely in persiflage, both are marked  by the contour of high blood and a constitutional a version to anything cowardly      and mean, both accept the love depicted in romances as the great business of a life or a poem,  both seem unconscious of the mighty truths of eternity and immortality, both are silent on the  presumptions of liberty and equality, and both devour themselves in solitary lassitude. Whatever  may be said of all this, it harmonizes and represents facts. The present phases of high-life in  Great Britain are as natural a growth there as Tennyson and his poems are a natural growth of  those phases. It remains to be distinctly admitted that this man is a real poet, notwithstanding his  ennui and his aristocracy.  

   Meanwhile a strange voice parts others aside and demands for its owner that position that is only  allowed after the seal of many returning years has stamped with approving stamp the claims of  the loftiest leading genius. Do you think the best honors of the earth are won so easily, Walt  Whitman? Do you think city and country are to fall before the vehement egotism of your  recitative of yourself?  

     - I am the poet of the body, 
  - And I am the poet of the soul. 
      - The pleasures of heaven are with me, and the pains of hell are with  
     me, 
  - The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a  
     new tongue. 
      - I am the poet of the woman the same as the man, 
  - And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man, 
  - And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men. 
  - I chant a new chant of dilation or pride, 
  - We have had ducking and deprecating about enough, 
  - I show that size is only development. 
      It is indeed a strange voice! Critics and lovers and readers of poetry as hitherto written, may well  be excused the chilly and unpleasant shudders which will assuredly run through them, to their  very blood and bones, when they first read Walt Whitman's poems. If this is poetry, where must  its foregoers stand! And what is at once to become of the ranks of rhymsters, melancholy and  swallow-tailed, and of all the confectioners and upholsterers of verse, if the tan-faced man here  advancing and claiming to speak for America and the nineteenth hundred of the Christian list of  years, typifies indeed the natural and proper hard?  

   The theory and practice of poets have hitherto been to select certain ideas or events or  personages, and then      describe them in the best manner they could, always with as much ornament as the case allowed.  Such are not the theory and practice of the new poet. He never presents for perusal a poem  ready-made on the old models, and ending when you come to the end of it; but every sentence  and every passage tells of an interior not always seen, and exudes an impalpable something  which sticks to him that reads, and pervades and provokes him to tread the half-invisible road  where the poet, like an apparition, is striding fearlessly before. If Walt Whitman's premises are  true, then there is a subtler range of poetry than that of the grandeur and life of events, as in  Homer, or of characters, as in Shakspeare — poetry to which all other writing is subservient, and  which confronts the very meanings of the works of nature and competes with them. It is the  direct bringing of occurrences and persons and things to bear on the listener or beholder, to  re-appear through him or her; and it offers the best way of making them a part of him and her as  the right aim of the greatest poet.  

   Of the spirit of life in visible forms — of the spirit of the seed growing out of the ground — of the  spirit of the resistless motion of the globe passing unsuspected but quick as lightning along its  orbit — of them is the spirit of this man's poetry. Like them it eludes and mocks criticism, and  appears unerringly in results. Things, facts, events, persons, days, ages, qualities, tumble  pell-mell, exhaustless and copious, with what appear to be the same disregard of parts and the  same absence of special purpose, as in nature. But the voice of the few rare and controlling  critics, and the voice of more than one generation of men or two generations of men, must speak  for the inexpressible purposes of nature, and for this haughtiest of writers that has ever yet  written and printed a book. His is to prove either the most lamentable of failures or the most  glorious of triumphs, in the known history of literature. And after all we have written we confess  our brain-felt and heart-felt inability to decide which we think it is likely to be.  

       
###       *From the Critic. (London, England.)*        LEAVES OF GRASS. New York, 1855. London: Horsell.      

   We had ceased, we imagined to be surprised at anything that America could produce. We had  become stoically indifferent      to her Woolly Horses, her Mermaids, her Sea Serpents, her Barnums, and her Fanny Ferns; but  the last monstrous importation from Brooklyn, New York, has scattered our indifference to the  winds. Here is a thin quarto volume without an author's name on the title-page; but to atone for  which we have a portrait engraved on steel of the notorious individual who is the poet  presumptive. This portrait expresses all the features of the hard democrat, and none of the flexile  delicacy of the civilized poet. The damaged hat, the rough beard, the naked throat, the shirt  exposed to the waist, are each and all presented to show that the man to whom these articles  belong scorns the delicate arts of civilization. The man is the true impersonation of his  book — rough, uncouth, vulgar. It was by the merest accident that we discovered the name of this  erratic and newest wonder; but at page 29 we find that he is —

    - Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs, a kosmos, 
  - Disorderly, fleshly, and sensual. 
    The words "an American" are a surplusage, "one of the roughs" too painfully apparent; but what  is intended to be conveyed by "a kosmos" we cannot tell, unless it means a man who thinks that  the fine essence of poetry consists in writing a book which an American reviewer is compelled to  declare is "not to be read aloud to a mixed audience." We should have passed over this book,  "LEAVES OF GRASS," with indignant contempt, had not some few Transatlantic critics  attempted to "fix" this Walt Whitman as the poet who shall give a new and independent literature  to America — who shall form a race of poets as Banquo's issue formed a line of kings. Is it  possible that the most prudish nation in the world will adopt a poet whose indecencies stink in  the nostrils? We hope not; and yet there is a probability, and we will show why, that this Walt  Whitman will not meet with the stern rebuke which he so richly deserves. America has felt,  oftener perhaps than we have declared, that she has no national poet — that each one of her  children of song has relied too much on European inspiration, and clung too fervently to the old  conventionalities. It is therefore not unlikely that she may believe in the dawn of a thoroughly  original literature, now there has arisen a man who scorns the Hellenic deities, who has no belief  in, perhaps because he has no knowledge of, Homer and      Shakspeare; who relies on his own rugged nature, and trusts to his own rugged language, being  himself what he shows in his poems. Once transfix him as the genesis of a new era, and the  manner of the man may be forgiven or forgotten. But what claim has this Walt Whitman to be  thus considered, or to be considered a poet at all? We grant freely enough that he has a strong  relish for nature and freedom, just as an animal has; may, further, that his crude mind is capable  of appreciating some of nature's beauties; but it by no means follows that, because nature is  excellent, therefore art is contemptible. Walt Whitman is as unacquainted with art, as a hog is  with mathematics. His poems — we must call them so for convenience — twelve in number, are  innocent of rhythm. and resemble nothing so much as the war-cry of the Red Indians. Indeed,  Walt Whitman has had near and ample opportunities of studying the vociferations of a few  amiable savages. Or rather, perhaps, this Walt Whitman reminds us of Caliban flinging down his  logs, and setting himself to write a poem. In fact, Caliban, and not Walt Whitman, might have  written this:  

     - I too am not a bit tamed — I too am untranslatable, 
  - I sound my *barbaric yawp* over the roofs of the world. 
      Is this man with the "barbaric yawp" to push Long-fellow into the shade, and he meanwhile to  stand and "make mouths" at the sun? The chance of this might be formidable were it not  ridiculous. That object or that act which most develops the ridiculous element carries in its  bosom the seeds of decay, and is wholly powerless to trample out of God's universe one spark of  the beautiful. We do not, then, fear this Walt Whitman, who gives us slang in the place of  melody, and rowdyism in the place of regularity. The depth of his indecencies will be the grave  of his fame, or ought to be if all proper feeling is not extinct. The very nature of this man's  compositions excludes us from proving by extracts the truth of our remarks; but we, who are not  prudish, emphatically declare that the man who wrote page 79 of the "LEAVES OF GRASS"  deserves nothing so richly as the public executioner's whip. Walt Whitman libels the highest type  of humanity, and calls his free speech the true utterance of *a man:* we, who may have  been misdirected by civilization, call it the expression of *a beast*.  

   The leading idea of Walt Whitman's poems is as old as      the hills. It is the doctrine of universal sympathy which the first poet maintained, and which the  last on earth will maintain also. He says:  

     - Not a mutineer walks handcuffed to the jail but I am handcuffed to  
     him and walk by his side, 
  - Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last  
     gasp. 
      To show this sympathy he instances a thousand paltry, frivolous, and obscene circumstances.  Herein we may behold the difference between a great and a contemptible poet. What  Shakspeare — mighty shade of the mightiest bard, forgive us the comparison! — expressed in a  single line,

   - One touch of nature makes the whole world kin, 
    this Walt Whitman has tortured into scores of pages. A single extract will show what we mean.  This miserable spinner of words declares that the earth has "no themes, or hints, or provokers,"  and never had, if you cannot find such themes, or hints, or provokers  in — 

   *(Extract.)* 

   Can it be possible that its author intended this as a portion of a poem? Is it not more reasonable  to suppose that Walt Whitman has been learning to write, and that the compositor has got hold of  his copy-book? The American critics are, in the main, pleased with this man because he is  self-reliant, and because he assumes all the attributes of his country. If Walt Whitman has really  assumed those attributes, America should hasten to repudiate them, be they what they may. The  critics are pleased also because he talks like a man unaware that there was ever such a production  as a book, or ever such a being as a writer. This in the present day is a qualification exceedingly  rare, and *may* be valuable, so we wish those gentlemen joy of their GREAT  UNTAMED.  

   We must not neglect to quote an unusual passage, which may be suggestive to writers of the Old  World. To silence our incredulous readers, we assure them that the passage may be found at page  92.  

   *(Extract.)*  

   The transformation and the ethereal nature of Walt Whitman is marvellous to us, but perhaps not  so to a nation from which the spirit-rappers sprung.   

        - I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun; 
  - I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags; 
  - I bequeath myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love, 
  - If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles. 
      Here is also a sample of the man's slang and vulgarity:  

  *(Extract.)*  

   And here a spice of his republican insolence, his rank Yankeedom, and his audacious trifling  with death:  

     - Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-
     clothes, box up his bones for a journey, 
  - Find a swift Yankee clipper: here is freight for you, black-belled  
     clipper, 
  - Up with your anchor! shake out your sails, steer straight toward  
     Boston Bay. 
       - The committee open the box and set up the regal ribs, and glue those  
     that will not stay, 
  - And clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the  
     skull. 
      We will neither weary nor insult our readers with more extracts from this notable book. Emerson  *has praised it,* and called it the "most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom America has  yet contributed." Because Emerson has grasped substantial fame, he can afford to be generous;  but Emerson's generosity must not be mistaken for justice. If this work is really a work of  genius — if the principles of those poems, their free language, their amazing and andacious  egotism, their animal vigor, be real poetry and the divinest evidence of the true poet — then our  studies have been in vain, and vainer still the homage which we have paid the monarchs of Saxon  intellect, Shakspeare, and Milton, and Byron. This Walt Whitman holds that his claim to be a  poet lies in his robust and rude health. He is, in fact, as he declares, "the poet of the body." Adopt  this theory, and Walt Whitman is a Titan; Shelley and Keats the merest pigmies. If we had  commenced a notice of "LEAVES OF GRASS" in anger, we could not but dismiss it in grief, for  its author, we have just discovered, is conscious of his affliction. He says, at page 33,  

     -  *I am given up by traitors;* 
  - *I talk wildly, I am mad.* 
               
###     *From the Examiner*. (*London, England*.)      LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York.   

   We have too long overlooked in this country the great poet who has recently arisen in America,  of whom some of his countrymen speak in connection with Bacon and Shakspeare, whom others  compare with Tennyson — much to the disadvantage of our excellent laureate — and to whom Mr.  Emerson writes that he finds in his book. "incomparable things, said incomparably well." The  book he pronounces "the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet  contributed;" at which, indeed, says Mr. Emerson in the printed letter sent to us — "I  rubbed my eyes a little, to see if this sunbeam were no illusion."  

   No illusion truly is Walt Whitman, the new American prodigy, who, as he is himself candid  enough to intimate, sounds his barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world. He is described by one  of his own local papers as "a tenderly, affectionate, rowdyish, contemplative, sensual, moral,  susceptible, and imperious person," who aspires to cast some of his own grit, whatever that may  be, into literature. We have ourselves been disposed to think there is in literature grit enough,  according to the ordinary sense, but decidedly Walt Whitman tosses in some more. The author  describes himself as "one of the roughs, a kosmos;" indeed, he seems to be very much impressed  with the fact that he is a kosmos, and repeats it frequently. A kosmos we may define, from the  portrait of it on the front of the book, as a gentleman in his shirt-sleeves, with one hand in a  pocket of his pantaloons, and his wide-awake cocked with a dammee-sir air over his  forehead.  

   On the other hand, according to an American review that flatters Walt Whitman, this kosmos is  "a compound of the New England transcendentalist and New York rowdy."  

   But as such terms of compliment may not be quite clear to English readers, we must be content,  in simpler fashion, to describe to them this Brooklyn boy as a wild Tupper of the West. We can  describe him perfectly by a few suppositions. Suppose that Mr. Tupper had been brought up to  the business of an auctioneer, then banished to the backwoods, compelled to live for a long time  as a backwoodsman, and thus contracting a passion for the reading of Emerson and Carlyle?  Suppose him maddened by this course of      reading, and fancying himself not only an Emerson but a Carlyle and an American Shakspeare to  boot when the fits come on, and putting forth his notion of that combination in his own  self-satisfied way, and in his own wonderful cadences? In that state he would write a book  exactly like Walt Whitman's "LEAVES OF GRASS."  

  (*Extracts and Interlineated remarks*.)  

   We must be just to Walt Whitman in allowing that he has one positive merit. His verse has a  purpose. He desires to assert the pleasure that a man has in himself, his body and its sympathies,  his mind (in a lesser degree, however) and its sympathies. He asserts man's right to express his  delight in animal enjoyment, and the harmony in which he should stand, body and soul, with  fellow-men and the whole universe. To express this, and to declare that the poet is the highest  manifestation of this, generally also to suppress shams, is the purport of these "LEAVES OF  GLASS." Perhaps it might have been done as well, however, without being always so purposely  obscene, and intentionally foulmouthed, as Walt Whitman is.  

  (*Extracts and Interlineations*.)  

   In the construction of our artificial Whitman, we began with the requirement that a certain  philosopher should have been bred to the business of an auctioneer. We must add now, to  complete the imitation of Walt Whitman, that the wild philosopher and poet, as conceived by us,  should be perpetually haunted by the delusion that he has a catalogue to make. Three-fourths of  Walt Whitman's book is poetry as catalogues of auctioneers are poems. Whenever any general  term is used, off the mind wanders on this fatal track, and an attempt is made to specify all lots  included under it. Does Walt Whitman speak of a town, he is at once ready with pages of town  lots. Does he mention the American country, he feels bound thereupon to draw up a list of barns,  waggons, wilds, mountains, animals, trees, people, "a Hoosier, a Badger, a Buckeye, a  Louisianian, or Georgian, a poke-easy from sand-hills and pines,"  &c., &c. We will give an  illustration of this form of lunacy. The subject from which the patient starts off is equivalent to  things in general, and we can spare room only for half the catalogue. It will be enough, however,  to show how there      arises catalogue within catalogue, and how sorely the paroxysm is aggravated by the incidental  mention of any one particular that is itself again capable of subdivision into lots.  

     - The usual routine, the workshop, factory, yard, office, store, or desk; 
  - The jaunt of hunting or fishing, or the life of hunting or fishing. 
  - Pasture-life, foddering, milking and herding, and all the personnel and  
      
  - The plum-orchard and apple-orchard, gardening, seedlings, cuttings,  
     flowers and vines, 
  - Grains and manures, marl, clay, loam, the subeoil plough, the shovel  
     and pick and rake and hoe, irrigation and draining; 
  - The currycomb, the horse-cloth, the halter and bridle and bits, the  
     very wisps of straw, 
  - The barn and barn-yard, the bins and mangers, the mows and racks; 
  - Manufactures, commerce, engineering, the building of cities, and 
  - every trade carried on there, and the implements of every  trade.
     (*Extract continued*.)

   Now let us compare with this a real auctioneer's catalogue. We will take that of Goldsmith's  chambers, by way of departing as little as we can from the poetical. For, as Walt Whitman would  say (and here we quote quite literally, prefixing only a verse of our own, from "A Catalogue of  the Household Furniture with the select collection of scarce, curious, and valuable books of Dr.  Goldsmith, deceased, which, by order of the admr, will be sold by auction, &c.,  &c.)

  (*The Examiner's burlesque of Walt Whitman*.)  

      - Surely the house of a poet is a poem, and behold a poet in the  
     auctioneer who tells you the whole lot of it — 
  - The bath stone, compass front, open border, fender, shovel, tongs,  
     and poker, 
  - The blue moreen festoon window-curtain, the mahogany dining-table  
     on the floor, 
  - The six ditto hollow seat chairs covered with blue moreen, 
  - Covered with blue moreen and finished with a double row of brass  
     nails and check cases, 
  - The Wilton carpet, sun shade, line and pulleys, the deal sideboard  
     stained, 
  - The teapot, five coffee cups, sugar basin and cover, four saucers and  
     six cups, 
  - Two quart decanters and stoppers, one plain ditto, eleven glasses, one  
     wine and water glass, 
  - A pair of bellows and a brush, a footman, copper tea-kettle and coal-
     scuttle. 
  - Two pairs of plated candiestieka. 
  - A mahogany teaboard, a pet bordered ditto, a large round Japanese  
     ditto and two waiters. 
  - The Tragic Muse in a gold frame. 
             After all, we are not sure whether the poetry of that excellent Mr. Good, the auctioneer who, at  his Great Room, No. 121 Fleet Street, sold the household furniture of Oliver Goldsmith in the  summer of 1774, does not transcend in wisdom and in wit "the most extraordinary piece of wit  and wisdom that" (according to Mr. Emerson) "America has yet contributed."  

       
###     *From the London Leader*.    TRANSATLANTIC LATTER-DAY POETRY.  

      LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York, 1855. London:  Horsell  

   "Latter-day poetry" in America is of a very different character from the same manifestation in the  old country. Here, it is occupied for the most part with dreams of the middle ages, of the old  knightly and religious times; in America it is employed chiefly with the present, except when it  travels out into the undiscovered future. Here our latter-day poets are apt to whine over the times,  as if heaven were perpetually betraying the earth with a show of progress that is in fact  retrogression, like the backward advance of crabs; there, the minstrels of the stars and stripes  blow a loud note of exultation before the grand new epoch, and think the Greeks and Romans,  the early Oriental races, and the later men of the middle centuries, of small account before the  onward tramping of these present generations. Of this latter sect is a certain phenomenon who  has recently started up in Brooklyn, New York — one Walt Whitman, author of "LEAVES OF  GRASS," who has been received by a section of his countrymen as a sort of prophet, and by  Englishmen as a kind of fool. For ourselves, we are not disposed to accept him as the one, having  less faith in latter-day prophets than in latter-day poets; but assuredly we cannot regard him as  the other. Walt is one of the most amazing, one of the most startling, one of the most perplexing  creations of the modern American mind; but he is no fool, though abundantly eccentric, nor is his  book mere food for laughter, though undoubtedly containing much that may easily and fairly be  turned into ridicule.  

   The singularity of the author's mind — his utter disregard of ordinary forms and modes — appears in  the very title-page and frontispicce of his work. Not only is there      no author's name, (which in itself would not be singular) but there is no publisher's name — that of  the English bookseller being a London addition. Fronting the title is the portrait of a bearded  gentleman in his shirt-sleeves and a Spanish hat, with an all-pervading atmosphere of  Yankeedoodle about him; but again there is no patronymic, and we can only infer that this  roystering blade is the author of the book. Then follows a long prose treatise by way of preface  (and here once more the anonymous system is carried out, the treatise having no heading  whatever); and after that we have the poem, in the course of which a short autobiographical  discourse reveals to us the name of the author.  

   A passage from the Preface, if it may be so called, will give some insight into the character and  objects of the work.  

     Other states Indicate themselves in their deputies — but the genius of the United States is not best  or most in its executives or legislatures nor in its ambassadors, or authors, or colleges, or  churches, or pariors, nor even in its newspapers or inventors; but always most in the common  people. Their manners, speech, dress, friendships; the freshness and candor of their  physiognomy, the picturesque looseness of their carriage, their deathless attachment to freedom,  their aversion to any thing indecorous, or soft, or mean — the practical acknowledgment of the  citizens of one state by the citizens of all other states, the flerceness of their roused resentment,  their curiosity and welcome of novelty, their self-esteem and wonderful sympathy, their  susceptibility to a slight, the air they have of persons who never knew how it felt to stand in the  presence of superiors, the fluency of their speech, their delight in music, (the sure symptom of  manly tenderness and native elegance of soul,) their good temper and open-handedness, the  terrible significance of their elections, the President's taking off his hat to them, not they to  him — these too are unrhymed poetry. It awaits the gigantic and generous treatment worthy of  it.  

   This "gigantic and generous treatment," we presume, is offered in the pages which ensue. The  poem is written in wild, irregular, unrhymed, almost unmetrical "lengths," like the measured  prose of Mr. Martin Farquhar Tupper's *Proverbial Philosophy,* or some of the Oriental  writings. The external form, therefore, is startling, and by no means seductive, to English ears,  accustomed to the sumptuous music of ordinary metre; and the central principle of the poem is  equally staggering. It seems to resolve itself into an all-attracting egotism — an eternal presence of  the individual soul of Walt Whitman in all things, yet in such wise that this one soul shall be  presented as a type of all human souls whatsoever. He goes forth into the world, this rough,      devil-may-care Yankee; passionately identifies himself with all forms of being, sentient or  inanimate; sympathizes deeply with humanity; riots with a kind of Bacchanal fury in the force  and fervor of his own sensations; will not have the most vicious or abandoned shut out from final  comfort and reconciliation; is delighted with Broadway, New York, and equally in love with the  desolate back-woods, and the long stretch of the uninhabited prairie, where the wild beasts  wallow in the reeds, and the wilder birds start upward from their nests among the grass;  perceives a divine mystery wherever his feet conduct or his thoughts transport him; and beholds  all things tending toward the central and sovereign Me. Such, as we conceive, is the key to this  strange, grotesque, and bewildering book; yet we are far from saying that the key will unlock all  the quirks and oddities of the volume. Much remains of which we confess we can make nothing;  much that seems to us purely fantastical and preposterous; much that appears to our muddy  vision gratuitously prosaic, needlessly plain-speaking, disgusting without purpose, and singular  without result. There are so many evidences of a noble soul in Whitman's pages that we regret  these aberrations, which only have the effect of discrediting what is genuine by the show of  something false; and especially do we deplore the unnecessary openness with which Walt reveals  to us matters which ought rather to remain in sacred silence. It is good not to be ashamed of  Nature; it is good to have an allinclusive charity; but it is also good, sometimes, to leave the veil  across the Temple.  

       
###       *From the Boston Intelligencer, May 8d,* 1856      LEAVES OF GRASS. Brooklyn, New York, 1855.   

   We were attracted by the very singular title of the work, to seek the work itself. and what we  thought ridiculous in the title is eclipsed in the pages of this heterogeneous mass of bombast,  egotism, vulgarity, and nonsense. The beastliness of the author is set forth in his own description  of himself, and we can conceive no better reward than the lash for such a violation of decency as  we have before us. Speaking of "this mass of stupid filth," the *Criterion* says: "It is  impossible to imagine how any man's fancy      could have conceived it, unless he were possessed of the soul of a sentimental donkey that had  died of disappointed love."  

   This book should find no place where humanity urges any claim to respect, and the author should  be kicked from all decent society as below the level of the brute. There is neither wit nor method  in his disjointed babbling, and it seems to us he must be some escaped lunatic, raving in pitiable  delirium.
