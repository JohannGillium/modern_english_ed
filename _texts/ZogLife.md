# Zogbaum, Rufus F.  "Life at an Indian Agency."
 *Harper's Weekly* 34 (Jan. 1890): 10-11.

   THE treatment of the aboriginal inhabitants of the territories  over which the government of the United States has extended its  sway during the last twenty-five years has been — and still  continues to be — one of the most difficult problems ever  encountered in the development of any great nation.  Marching  eastward from the Pacific and westward from the turbid waters of  the Missouri, stretching in two thin blue threads from the "British  line" to the Mexican frontier, our gallant little army has steadily  closed in on the savages, "rounding up" the scattered tribes and  gathering them in upon the immense reservations of land set apart  for their use.  The government has established agencies to  represent it with the various tribes with which it has made  treaties, and it is the object of this paper simply to describe the  life at one of these agencies.  

The reservation allotted to the Southern cheyennes and  Arapahoes is situated in the Indian Territory, south of the so-called "Cherokee Strip" and west of the famous promised land of the  "Boomers," the Oklahoma country, and, according to General  Sheridan's report to the President in 1885, contains within its  limits 4,297,771 acres, "excellent for grazing, and most of the  land susceptible of the highest cultivation."  Extensive tracts of  timber — scrub-oak, cotton-wood, pecan, and walnut — line the streams  and the sides of many of the canons, and cover wide sections of  rolling prairie country; game — such as wild turkey, prairie-chicken, quail, and deer — abounds.  The enrolment taken during  General Sheridan's visit showed a total of 2169 Cheyennes and 1300  Arapahoes, distributed in "bands" over the reservation.  

Near the military post of Fort Reno, and on the North Fork of  the Canadian, lies the collection of government buildings forming  the agency for these Indians, and known to the post-office  officials and marked down on the maps under the name of Darlington.   Here the agent resides, and here — in a great brick building  fronting a wide unpaved plaza or square, on the various sides of  which stand the stores of the Indian traders, a hotel, and the  livery and stage stables, whence the stage line carries the mail  and passengers to the railroad, thirty miles away — is situated the  main office or agency for the two tribes mentioned.  On some  streets branching off from a park of rather ragged and forlorn  appearance, in which a few trees raise their crooked branches into  the air, are placed the residences of the employes, the schools,  and the saw-mill, the blacksmith, wagon, and tin shops.  

Driving out from Fort Reno, we rattle over the prairie past  the camp of the Indian scouts, their lodges pitched in military  order on a little rise overlooking the plain toward the agency;  past the cavalry horses on herd, scaring up great flocks of  blackbirds, and causing the little prairie-dogs to pop into their  burrows with shrill barks of anger and alarm; past some camps of  redskins who have come in to draw their rations, their wagons  standing near by, and their tough little horses "lariated" out to  graze; through great thickets of sunflowers, past Indians on  horseback, squaws and papooses in wagons, to the wooden bridge over  the river, where some more Indians, tall, wild-looking, handsome  fellows, are watering their horses, their figures reflected in the  clear shallow stream.  We move slowly over the not too firm-looking  structure, and then more rapidly on again over the wide dusty road,  skirted by the neat frame houses forming the residences of the  agent and some of the employes, until, swinging to the right, we  draw up at the door of the huge brick commissary building.  Groups  of shaggy, wiry ponies are tied to wagons, or held by waiting  squaws, whose lords pass in and out of the wide doorway, or stand  about in little knots chatting and smoking; now and then a mounted  "buck" or Indian policeman, in army blue, slouch-hatted, with  revolver swinging from belt bristling with cartridges, rides  briskly by, while, crossing the wide square, comes a train of  lumbering, creaking, heavily loaded freight wagons, their great  wheels grinding up the dry soil, which, driven in whirling clouds  through the air by the strong south wind, fills mouth and eyes with  gritty substance, and powders bright-hued savage finery and the  more soberly colored clothing of civilization alike with a thick  coating of brown dust.  Pushing our way through the motley crowd,  we ascend the wooden staircase on the outside of the building, and  enter the office, where we are most courteously received by the  agent.  

We have ample time to look about us here, for it is Monday,  the busiest day of the week, and while the agent is engaged in  listening to the various recitals of his tawny charges and in  answering their questions, we sit back in the easychair by the side  of his desk and leisurely "take in" the scene before us.  A number  of the Indians have evidently come in for a "talk," for they are  crowded into the room, some seated on the chairs lining the walls,  some lounging, blankets drawn in graceful folds about them, in the  doorways.  A few are clad in their picturesque native dress, but  almost all of them wear some articles of civilized clothing, and as  seen through the blue clouds of cigarette smoke they present an  interesting picture, with their wild but expressive and intelligent  faces, each in its setting of long, black, straight hair, their  bright eyes, and graceful gestures as they converse together in low  guttural tones.  Among them are some of the leading men of the  Cheyennes, but a short time ago the fiercest and most formidable of  the hostile tribes.[^note1]  Many of their most daring warriors and  skilful soldiers, however, finally overawed by the strong arm of  the government, and realizing the hopelessness of further armed  resistance against their white conquerors, are now the most eager  to learn how to travel "on the white man's road," and are rapidly  proving themselves apt pupils.  Some of them are quite well-to-do,  owning horses and wagons bought and paid for by themselves, and  following the occupation of "freighters," hauling all the supplies  for the agencies from the railroads, and receiving the same rates  of payment for the work as the white men engaged in the same  business.  Although under the treaty made with the Cheyennes and  Arapahoes $30,000 in clothing is distributed annually among them,  and supplies of food (rations) are issued to each head of a family  at regular intervals, every effort is being made to render the  Indians self-supporting, and although the attempt to induce them to  abandon their nomadic mode of life still meets with considerable  opposition, every encouragement is given to those among them who  have been persuaded to adopt some peaceful occupation as a means of  gaining their livelihood.  Two saw-mills are kept running for the  purpose of sawing native lumber to be used in building farm-houses,  about fifty of which have been erected at different points on the  reservation in the last year and a half, the Indians performing all  the unskilled labor in their construction, such as cutting and  hauling the lumber, etc., at their own expense.  The farms — of  which there are now about four hundred and fifty, running from five  to one hundred acres in extent under cultivation — are situated on  three-hundred-and-twenty-acre tracts, with a view to allotment  under the so-called "Severalty Bill."  The future owner of one of  these farms having selected his "location," it is staked out for  him by one of the white farmers employed by the government as  instructors, who encloses ten acres with a wire fence, the Indian  cutting and setting out a sufficient number of posts for the  purpose.  The ground is then broken at the expense of the  government; the necessary farming implements, seeds, etc., are  furnished gratuitously to the embryo agriculturist, who, under the  instruction of his white teachers, is left to work out his own  salvation by the sweat of his brow.

  [^note1]:   Mr. G. D. Williams, the agent at Darlington, in his report in  August, 1887, says: "But a little over two years ago one-eighth of  the entire force of the army was directed against the Cheyennes of  the agency, who in large numbers were then opposed to any  innovation tending toward civilization."  

  Wild, untutored, unaccustomed to restraint, and suspicious by  nature as the Indians are, the position of the government's agent  is a difficult one, requiring great patience, tact, and careful  judgment on the part of the official filling it.  He is often  called upon for advice even in matters concerning the family  affairs of individuals, must listen to their complaints, and  endeavor to see that all are treated with equal justice in their  dealings with the "Great Father," whose representative he is.  He  must superintend and hold to account the sub-agents and employes,  attend to the handling of the supplies intended for the use of the  Indians, the issuing of rations, the wants of the schools, the  enforcement of obedience to the local laws and rules of the  reservation through the Indian police, and is responsible for the  proper conduct of the whole of the complicated business of the  agency.  The employes at the Cheyenne and Arapahoe agency comprise  a chief clerk and two assistants in the office at Darlington, two  engineers for running two saw-mills, two carpenters, two  blacksmiths, a wagon-maker, and five farmers engaged as  instructors, and a large number of Indians, apprentices, drivers,  herders, etc.  The police force, divided into detachments at  different stations, numbers thirty rank and file and three  officers — a captain and two lieutenants — all full-blooded Indians,  owning their horses and under regular pay, the officers receiving  ten and the privates eight dollars monthly, and is composed of  representatives of both tribes.  The uniform, two suits of which  are furnished annually by the government to each member of the  force, is similar in cut and color to that worn by United States  troops, and consists of a dark blue blouse, light blue trousers,  and soft felt hat with a ribbon bearing the word "Police" in  silvered letters.  Officers and men are armed with revolvers, and  are faithful and efficient, Mr. Williams, the agent, assuring us  that they have never yet failed to make an arrest during his  administration.  

There are five sub-agencies at different points    on the  reservation, each under a sub-agent, at the largest of which,  Cantonment, an abandoned military post, one thousand savages are  rationed.  Four schools for Indian children, two of which are  mission schools and two of which are maintained at the expense of  the government, furnish education to three hundred and twenty red-skinned youngsters of both sexes, whose well-washed faces and clean  clothing, their excellent discipline and apparent docility, as they  sit behind the straightly aligned rows of desks in their school-rooms, are in strong contrast to the bands of half-clad, painted,  unkempt, and unmistakably unwashed little savages we have passed on  our way over from the "post."  But for an occasional untamed  glitter of their bright black eyes and a flash of white teeth in  relief against the dusky hue of their faces, as they stand singing  Sunday-school hymns for all the world like white children, it is  hard to realize that any one among them had been born and attained  the school age under the influence of savage life.  The  dormitories, refectories, kitchens, etc., are scrupulously clean,  and the schools can bear favorable comparison with similar  institutions in more populous and enlightened communities.  

As already mentioned, a fixed sum is expended annually for  clothing, etc., according to a treaty made with these tribes; and  in addition to this, regular supplies or rations of food are  distributed every seven days.  This weekly ration consists of  twenty-one pounds of beef, three and a half pounds of flour, half  a pound of sugar, three-eighths of a pound of coffee, and a certain  quantity of beans, salt, baking-powder, soap, etc., for each  individual Indian.  Heads of families are provided with tickets —   running for thirteen weeks, and on which numerals representing each  week are printed — which on presentation at the agency entitle the  holders to their share of the groceries, the issue clerk punching  out one of the numerals mentioned at each weekly delivery of the  supplies.  Beef is issued every Monday "on the hoof," and "on  block" at five different points, each band of forty-four Indians —   men, women, and children — receiving one steer.  

The distribution of beef at Darlington takes place at an  isolated spot on the prairie, some distance from the agency, and  the sights witnessed at a "big killing" present a scene at once  picturesque and exciting, if somewhat revolting to the finer  sensibilities in some of its details.  Long before the hour  appointed for the slaughter of the animals and the distribution of  the meat, bands of savages take up the march for the rendezvous  from all points of the adjacent country.  Wagons — sometimes of the  newest and most approved patterns, at others the veriest  rattletraps to be found on four wheels, filled with squaws, and  drawn by all kinds of teams, from the piebald, wall-eyed, pink-nosed ponies, to the patient and more or less broken-down mules,  occasionally both horses and mules hitched to the same outfit — are  crowded around the rough "corral" or fenced-in space on the prairie  where the cattle are herded together, and over which, far up in the  clear air, ragged-winged buzzards are circling.  Mounted Indians  gallop up, some armed with revolvers, others with carbines, and  perched high up on the backs of their horses, ready for the  exciting sport of pursuing and slaughtering the wild-eyed, long-horned Texan steers, that move restlessly about the narrow limits  of the corral, bellowing nervously as if in dread anticipation of  their doom.  A fire is burning near by in which the branding-irons  are being heated, and policemen and scouts, herders and agency  officials, move about in the rapidly increasing crowd, busily  preparing for the work of selecting and turning over the beeves  designed for slaughter to the waiting Indian butchers.  Descending  from the "ambulance" in which we have driven over from the "post,"  accompanying the young officer detailed to be present at the  "issue," we approach a rough log cabin, built close up to the  fence, in which are placed the scales for weighing each steer as it  is driven into the long narrow space connecting the corral with the  gates out of which the brutes are liberated, only to fall victims  to the eager savages awaiting them on the prairie.  Bounded by a  high fence on each side, this lane, so contracted in its width as  to admit of the passage of but one animal at a time, is crowded  with the frightened steers, who push and gore one another in  frantic efforts to escape from the torture of the branding-irons  and knives busily plied by the Indians perched on the top rail of  the fence, as each one marks in his particular manner the "beef"  intended for issue to his band.  

Rapidly following one another, the brutes are released one by  one through the gate opened at intervals by a single policeman, who  frequently has to exert all his agility to escape the angry  sideward thrust of their horns as the cattle rush through the  narrow opening.  Some of them dash frantically out over the plain,  bellowing furiously and throwing up the dirt and dust with the  sharp points of their cloven hoofs; others stop for a moment  bewildered, foaming at the mouth and snorting with fear and rage,  and then gallop away.  Indians mount rapidly and start after,  revolver or carbine in hand, and a regular hunt in all directions  over the rolling prairie in front of us begins, as the maddened  brutes vainly endeavor to escape from their ruthless pursuers.   Jumping into the ambulance, we too drive out to get a nearer view,  and we must confess that our participation in a sort of "Wild West"  hunt in a "spring wagon," instead of on horseback, is a decidedly  novel experience to us, particularly as the Indians are none too  expert as marksmen and are apt to shoot wildly, while an excited  Texan steer has no respect for government ambulances or "special  artists."  However, our object is to "git thar," to use an apt  Western expression, and to procure a good opportunity for making  our notes and sketches, so, under the circumstances, our means of  transportation is the best we could have desired.  

Under the pitiless shots of the butcher the victim falls to  the ground, and before its limbs have ceased to move in the  convulsions of death, the hunter has dismounted, and the long,  keen-bladed knife is plunged to the hilt in the still quivering  body of the dying brute.  With a yell the Indian signals to the  squaws, who, urging their horses on, come rapidly out in their  wagons from the corral, to begin the work of flaying and  butchering.  They swarm around the carcass with savage eagerness,  and the tidbits, such as the heart, liver, etc., are quickly cut  out, and sometimes devoured on the spot.  Every portion of the  "beef" — entrails and all — is used for food, and soon the wagons,  loaded with huge lumps of still warm meat, drops of blood oozing  through the cracks in their floors, move away from the scene of  slaughter, and the buzzards flock down to gather up such stray  bits — scanty fare indeed — as may have been left on the ground.
