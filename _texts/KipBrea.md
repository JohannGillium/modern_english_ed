#  Hymn of Breaking Strain. 

   - The careful text books measure
 -   (Let all who build beware!)
 - The load, the shock, the pressure
 -   Material can bear.
 - So, when the buckled girder
 -   Lets down the grinding span,
 - The blame of loss, or murder,
 -   Is laid upon the man.
 - *     Not on the Stuff — the Man!*
  - But in our daily dealing
 -   With stone and steel, we find
 - The Gods have no such feeling
 -   Of justice toward mankind.
 - To no set gauge they make us, — 
 -   For no laid course prepare — 
 - And presently o'ertake us
 -   With loads we cannot bear.
 - *   Too merciless to bear.*
  - The prudent text-books give it
 -   In tables at the end — 
 - The stress that shears a rivet
 -   Or makes a tie-bar bend — 
 - What traffic wrecks macadam — 
 -   What concrete should endure — 
 - But we, poor Sons of Adam,
 -   Have no such literature,
 - *   To warn us or make sure!*
  - We hold all Earth to plunder — 
 -   All Time and Space as well — 
 - Too wonder-stale to wonder
 -   At each new miracle;
  - Till, in mid-illusion
 -   Of Godhead 'neath our hand,
 - Falls multiple confusion
 -   On all we did or planned.
 - *    The mighty works we planned.*
  - We only of Creation
 - *(Oh, luckier bridge and rail!)*
 - Abide the twin-damnation — 
 -   To fail and know we fail.
 - Yet we — by which sole token
 -   We know we once were Gods — 
 - Take shame in being broken
 -   However great the odds — 
 - *   The Burden or the Odds.*
  - Oh, veiled and secret Power
 -   Whose paths we seek in vain,
 - Be with us in our hour
 -   Of overthrow and pain;
 - That we — by which sure token
 -   We know thy ways are true — 
 - In spite of being broken,
 - *Because of being broken*,
 - *      May rise and build anew.*
 - *      Stand up and build anew!*
