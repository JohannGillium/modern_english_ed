# The Tragedie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke.

  *Enter Barnardo, and Francisco, two Centinels.* Bar.:  - Whose there?  
  Fran.:  - Nay answere me. Stand and vnfolde your selfe. 
  Bar.:  - Long liue the King,  
  Fran.:  - *Barnardo*. 
  Bar.:  - Hee. 
  Fran.:  - You come most carefully vpon your houre, 
  Bar.:  - Tis now strooke twelfe, get thee to bed *Francisco.*
  Fran.:  - For this reliefe much thanks, tis bitter cold,  
 - And I am sick at hart.  
  Bar.:  - Haue you had quiet guard?  
  Fran.:  - Not a mouse stirring. 
  Bar.:  - Well, good night:  
 - If you doe meete *Horatio* and *Marcellus*, 
 - The riualls of my watch, bid them make hast. 
 *Enter Horatio, and Marcellus.*  Fran.:  - I thinke I heare them, stand ho, who is there?  
  Hora.:  - Friends to this ground. 
  Mar.:  - And Leedgemen to the Dane,  
  Fran.:  - Giue you good night. 
  Mar.:  - O, farwell honest souldiers, who hath relieu'd you? 
  Fran.:  - *Barnardo* hath my place; giue you good night. 
 *Exit Fran.*   Mar.:  - Holla, *Barnardo.*
  Bar.:  - Say, what is *Horatio* there?  
  Hora.:  - A peece of him. 
  Bar.:  - Welcome *Horatio*, welcome good *Marcellus*, 
  Hora.:  - What, ha's this thing appeard againe to night?  
  Bar.:  - I haue seene nothing. 
  Mar.:  - *Horatio* saies tis but our fantasie, 
 - And will not let beliefe take holde of him, 
 - Touching this dreaded sight twice seene of vs, 
 - Therefore I haue intreated him along, 
 - With vs to watch the minuts of this night, 
 - That if againe this apparision come, 
 - He may approoue our eyes and speake to it. 
  Hora.:  - Tush, tush, twill not appeare.  
  Bar.:  - Sit downe a while, 
 - And let vs once againe assaile your eares, 
 - That are so fortified against our story,  
 - What we haue two nights seene. 
  Hora.:  - Well, sit we downe,  
 - And let vs heare *Barnardo* speake of this. 
  Bar.:  - Last night of all,  
 - When yond same starre thats weastward from the pole, 
 - Had made his course t'illume that part of heauen 
 - Where now it burnes, *Marcellus* and my selfe 
 - The bell then beating one.  
 *Enter Ghost.*  Mar.:  - Peace, breake thee of, looke where it comes againe. 
  Bar.:  - In the same figure like the King thats dead. 
  Mar.:  - Thou art a scholler, speake to it *Horatio.*
  Bar.:  - Lookes a not like the King? marke it *Horatio.*
  Hora.:  - Most like, it horrowes me with feare and wonder. 
  Bar.:  - It would be spoke to.  
  Mar.:  - Speake to it *Horatio.*
  Hora.:  - What art thou that vsurpst this time of night, 
 - Together with that faire and warlike forme, 
 - In which the Maiestie of buried Denmarke 
 - Did sometimes march, by heauen I charge thee speake. 
  Mar.:  - It is offended.  
  Bar.:  - See it staukes away. 
   Hora.:  - Stay, speake, speake, I charge thee speake. 
 *Exit Ghost.*  Mar.:  - Tis gone and will not answere. 
  Bar.:  - How now *Horatio*, you tremble and looke pale, 
 - Is not this somthing more then phantasie? 
 - What thinke you ont?  
  Hora.:  - Before my God I might not this belieue, 
 - Without the sencible and true auouch  
 - Of mine owne eies. 
  Mar.:  - Is it not like the King?  
  Hora.:  - As thou art to thy selfe. 
 - Such was the very Armor he had on, 
 - When he the ambitious *Norway* combated, 
 - So frownd he once, when in an angry parle 
 - He smot the sleaded pollax on the ice.  
 - Tis strange. 
  Mar.:  - Thus twice before, and iump at this dead houre, 
 - With martiall stauke hath he gone by our watch. 
  Hora.:  - In what perticular thought, to worke I know not, 
 - But in the grosse and scope of mine opinion, 
 - This bodes some strange eruption to our state. 
  Mar.:  - Good now sit downe, and tell me he that knowes, 
 - Why this same strikt and most obseruant watch 
 - So nightly toiles the subiect of the land, 
 - And with such dayly cost of brazon Cannon 
 - And forraine marte, for implements of warre, 
 - Why such impresse of ship-writes, whose sore taske 
 - Does not deuide the Sunday from the weeke, 
 - What might be toward that this sweaty hast 
 - Doth make the night ioynt labourer with the day, 
 - Who ist that can informe mee?  
  Hora.:  - That can I. 
 - At least the whisper goes so; our last King, 
 - Whose image euen but now appear'd to vs, 
 - Was as you knowe by *Fortinbrasse* of *Norway*, 
 - Thereto prickt on by a most emulate pride 
 - Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant *Hamlet*, 
 - (For so this side of our knowne world esteemd him) 
 - Did slay this *Fortinbrasse*, who by a seald compact 
 - Well ratified by lawe and heraldy 
  - Did forfait (with his life) all these his lands 
 - Which he stood seaz'd of, to the conquerour. 
 - Against the which a moitie competent 
 - Was gaged by our King, which had returne  
 - To the inheritance of *Fortinbrasse*, 
 - Had he bin vanquisher; as by the same comart, 
 - And carriage of the article desseigne, 
 - His fell to Hamlet; now Sir, young *Fortinbrasse*  
 - Of vnimprooued mettle, hot and full, 
 - Hath in the skirts of *Norway* heere and there  
 - Sharkt vp a list of lawelesse resolutes 
 - For foode and diet to some enterprise 
 - That hath a stomacke in't, which is no other 
 - As it doth well appeare vnto our state 
 - But to recouer of vs by strong hand 
 - And tearmes compulsatory, those foresaid lands 
 - So by his father lost; and this I take it, 
 - Is the maine motiue of our preparations 
 - The source of this our watch, and the chiefe head 
 - Of this post hast and Romeage in the land. 
  Bar.:  - I thinke it be no other, but enso; 
 - Well may it sort that this portentous figure 
 - Comes armed through our watch so like the King 
 - That was and is the question of these warres. 
  Hora.:  - A moth it is to trouble the mindes eye: 
 - In the most high and palmy state of Rome, 
 - A little ere the mightiest *Iulius* fell 
 - The graues stood tenantlesse, and the sheeted dead 
 - Did squeake and gibber in the Roman streets 
 - As starres with traines of fier, and dewes of blood 
 - Disasters in the sunne; and the moist starre, 
 - Vpon whose influence *Neptunes* Empier stands, 
 - Was sicke almost to doomesday with eclipse. 
 - And euen the like precurse of feare euents 
 - As harbindgers preceading still the fates 
 - And prologue to the *Omen* comming on 
 - Haue heauen and earth together demonstrated 
 - Vnto our Climatures and countrymen. 
 *Enter Ghost.*  - But soft, behold, loe where it comes againe 
 - Ile crosse it though it blast mee: stay illusion, 
 *It spreads his armes.* - If thou hast any sound or vse of voyce, 
 - Speake to me, if there be any good thing to be done 
 - That may to thee doe ease, and grace to mee,  
 - Speake to me. 
 - If thou art priuie to thy countries fate 
 - Which happily foreknowing may auoyd  
 - O speake: 
 - Or if thou hast vphoorded in thy life 
 - Extorted treasure in the wombe of earth 
 - For which they say your spirits oft walke in death. 
 *The cocke crowes.* - Speake of it, stay and speake, stop it *Marcellus.*
  Mar.:  - Shall I strike it with my partizan?  
  Hor.:  - Doe if it will not stand.  
  Bar.:  - Tis heere.  
  Hor.:  - Tis heere.  
  Mar.:  - Tis gone. 
 - We doe it wrong being so Maiesticall  
 - To offer it the showe of violence, 
 - For it is as the ayre, invulnerable, 
 - And our vaine blowes malicious mockery. 
  Bar.:  - It was about to speake when the cocke crewe. 
  Hor.:  - And then it started like a guilty thing, 
 - Vpon a fearefull summons; I haue heard, 
 - The Cock that is the trumpet to the morne, 
 - Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding throat 
 - Awake the God of day, and at his warning 
 - Whether in sea or fire, in earth or ayre 
 - Th'extrauagant and erring spirit hies 
 - To his confine, and of the truth heerein 
 - This present obiect made probation. 
  Mar.:  - It faded on the crowing of the Cock. 
 - Some say that euer gainst that season comes 
 - Wherein our Sauiours birth is celebrated 
 - This bird of dawning singeth all night long, 
 - And then they say no spirit dare sturre abraode 
 - The nights are wholsome, then no plannets strike, 
 - No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charme 
  - So hallowed, and so gratious is that time. 
  Hora.:  - So haue I heard and doe in part belieue it, 
 - But looke the morne in russet mantle clad 
 - Walkes ore the dewe of yon high Eastward hill 
 - Breake we our watch vp and by my aduise 
 - Let vs impart what we haue seene to night 
 - Vnto young *Hamlet*, for vppon my life 
 - This spirit dumb to vs, will speake to him: 
 - Doe you consent we shall acquaint him with it 
 - As needfull in our loues, fitting our duty. 
  Mar.:  - Lets doo't I pray, and I this morning knowe 
 - Where we shall find him most conuenient. 
  *Exeunt.* *Florish. Enter Claudius, King of Denmarke, Gertrad the Queene, Counsaile: as Polonius, and his Sonne Laertes, Hamlet, Cum Alijs.* Claud.:  - Though yet of *Hamlet* our deare brothers death 
 - The memorie be greene, and that it vs befitted 
 - To beare our harts in griefe, and our whole Kingdome, 
 - To be contracted in one browe of woe 
 - Yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature, 
 - That we with wisest sorrowe thinke on him 
 - Together with remembrance of our selues: 
 - Therefore our sometime Sister, now our Queene 
 - Th'imperiall ioyntresse to this warlike state 
 - Haue we as twere with a defeated ioy  
 - With an auspitious, and a dropping eye, 
 - With mirth in funerall, and with dirdge in marriage, 
 - In equall scale waighing delight and dole 
 - Taken to wife: nor haue we heerein bard 
 - Your better wisdomes, which haue freely gone 
 - With this affaire along (for all our thankes) 
 - Now followes that you knowe young *Fortinbrasse*, 
 - Holding a weake supposall of our worth 
 - Or thinking by our late deare brothers death 
 - Our state to be disioynt, and out of frame 
 - Coleagued with this dreame of his aduantage 
 - He hath not faild to pestur vs with message 
  - Importing the surrender of those lands 
 - Lost by his father, with all bands of lawe 
 - To our most valiant brother, so much for him: 
 - Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting, 
 - Thus much the business is, we haue heere writ  
 - To *Norway* Vncle of young *Fortenbrasse*
 - Who impotent and bedred scarcely heares 
 - Of this his Nephewes purpose; to suppresse 
 - His further gate heerein, in that the leuies, 
 - The lists, and full proportions are all made 
 - Out of his subiect, and we heere dispatch  
 - You good *Cornelius*, and you *Valtemand*, 
 - For bearers of this greeting to old *Norway*, 
 - Giuing to you no further personall power 
 - To busines with the King, more then the scope  
 - Of these delated articles allowe: 
 - Farwell, and let your hast commend your dutie. 
  Cor. and Vol.:  - In that, and all things will we showe our dutie. 
  King.:  - We doubt it nothing, hartely farwell. 
 - And now *Laertes* whats the newes with you? 
 - You told vs of some sute, what ist *Laertes*? 
 - You cannot speake of reason to the Dane 
 - And lose your voyce; what wold'st thou begge *Laertes*,? 
 - That shall not be my offer, not thy asking, 
 - The head is not more natiue to the hart 
 - The hand more instrumentall to the mouth 
 - Then is the throne of Denmarke to thy father, 
 - What would'st thou haue *Laertes*?  
  Laer.:  - My dread Lord, 
 - Your leaue and fauour to returne to Fraunce, 
 - >From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke, 
 - To showe my dutie in your Coronation; 
 - Yet now I must confesse, that duty done 
 - My thoughts and wishes bend againe toward Fraunce 
 - And bowe them to your gracious leaue and pardon. 
  King.:  - Haue you your fathers leaue, what saies *Polonius*? 
  Polo.:  - Hath my Lord wroung from me my slowe leaue 
 - By laboursome petition, and at last 
 - Vpon his will I seald my hard consent, 
  - I doe beseech you giue him leaue to goe. 
  King.:  - Take thy faire houre *Laertes*, time be thine 
 - And thy best graces spend it at thy will: 
 - But now my Cosin *Hamlet*, and my sonne. 
  Ham.:  - A little more then kin, and lesse then kind. 
  King.:  - How is it that the clowdes still hang on you. 
  Ham.:  - Not so much my Lord, I am too much in the sonne. 
  Queene.:  - Good *Hamlet* cast thy nighted colour off 
 - And let thine eye looke like a friend on *Denmarke*, 
 - Doe not for euer with thy vailed lids 
 - Seeke for thy noble Father in the dust, 
 - Thou know'st tis common all that liues must die, 
 - Passing through nature to eternitie.  
  Ham.:  - I Maddam, it is common. 
  Quee.:  - If it be  
 - Why seemes it so perticuler with thee. 
  Ham.:  - Seemes Maddam, nay it is, I know not seemes, 
 - Tis not alone my incky cloake coold mother 
 - Nor customary suites of solembe blacke 
 - Nor windie suspiration of forst breath 
 - No, nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye, 
 - Nor the deiected hauior of the visage 
 - Together with all formes, moodes, chapes of griefe 
 - That can denote me truely, these indeede seeme, 
 - For they are actions that a man might play 
 - But I haue that within which passes showe 
 - These but the trappings and the suites of woe. 
  King.:  - Tis sweete and commendable in your nature *Hamlet*, 
 - To giue these mourning duties to your father 
 - But you must knowe your father lost a father, 
 - That father lost, lost his, and the suruiuer bound  
 - In filliall obligation for some tearme 
 - To doe obsequious sorrowe, but to perseuer  
 - In obstinate condolement,  is a course 
 - Of impious stubbornes, tis vnmanly griefe, 
 - It showes a will most incorrect to heauen  
 - A hart vnfortified, or minde impatient 
 - An vnderstanding simple and vnschoold 
 - For what we knowe must be, and is as common 
  - As any the most vulgar thing to sence, 
 - Why should we in our peuish opposition 
 - Take it to hart, fie, tis a fault to heauen, 
 - A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, 
 - To reason most absurd, whose common theame 
 - Is death of fathers, and who still hath cryed 
 - >From the first course, till he that died to day 
 - This must be so: we pray you throw to earth  
 - This vnpreuailing woe, and thinke of vs 
 - As of a father, for let the world take note 
 - You are the most imediate to our throne, 
 - And with no lesse nobilitie of loue 
 - Then that which dearest father beares his sonne, 
 - Doe I impart toward you for your intent 
 - In going back to schoole in *Wittenberg*, 
 - It is most retrogard to our desire, 
 - And we beseech you bend you to remaine 
 - Heere in the cheare and comfort of our eye, 
 - Our chiefest courtier, cosin, and our sonne. 
  Quee.:  - Let not thy mother loose her prayers *Hamlet*, 
 - I pray thee stay with vs, goe not to *Wittenberg.*
  Ham.:  - I shall in all my best obay you Madam. 
  King.:  - Why tis a louing and a faire reply, 
 - Be as our selfe in Denmarke, Madam come, 
 - This gentle and vnforc'd accord of *Hamlet*
 - Sits smiling to my hart, in grace whereof, 
 - No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day, 
 - But the great Cannon to the cloudes shall tell. 
 - And the Kings rowse the heauen shall brute againe, 
 - Respeaking earthly thunder; come away. 
  *Florish.* *Exeunt all, but Hamlet.* Ham.:  - O that this too too sallied flesh would melt, 
 - Thaw and resolue it selfe into a dewe, 
 - Or that the euerlasting had not fixt 
 - His cannon gainst seale slaughter, o God, God, 
 - How wary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable  
 - Seeme to me all the vses of this world? 
 - Fie on't, ah fie, tis an vnweeded garden 
 - That growes to seede, things rancke and grose in nature, 
 - Possesse it meerely that it should come thus 
  - But two months dead, nay not so much, not two, 
 - So excellent a King, that was to this  
 - Hiperion to a satire, so louing to my mother, 
 - That he might not beteeme the winds of heauen 
 - Visite her face too roughly, heauen and earth 
 - Must I remember, why she should hang on him 
 - As if increase of appetite had growne  
 - By what it fed on, and yet within a month, 
 - Let me not thinke on't; frailty thy name is woman 
 - A little month or ere those shooes were old 
 - With which she followed my poore fathers bodie  
 - Like *Niobe* all teares, why she 
 - O God, a beast that wants discourse of reason 
 - Would haue mourn'd longer, married with my Vncle, 
 - My fathers brother, but no more like my father  
 - Then I to *Hercules*, within a month, 
 - Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous teares, 
 - Had left the flushing in her gauled eyes 
 - She married, o most wicked speede; to post 
 - With such dexteritie to incestious sheets, 
 - It is not, nor it cannot come to good, 
 - But breake my hart, for I must hold my tongue. 
 *Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.*  Hora.:  - Haile to your Lordship. 
  Ham.:  - I am glad to see you well; *Horatio*, or I do forget my selfe. 
  Hora.:  - The same my Lord, and your poore seruant euer. 
  Ham.:  - Sir my good friend, Ile change that name with you, 
 - And what make you from *Wittenberg* *Horatio*? 
  *Marcellus.* Mar.:  - My good Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I am very glad to see you, (good euen sir) 
 - But what in faith make you from *Wittenberg*? 
  Hora.:  - A truant disposition good my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I would not heare your enimie say so, 
 - Nor shall you doe my eare that violence 
 - To make it truster of your owne report 
 - Against your selfe, I knowe you are no truant, 
 - But what is your affaire in *Elsonoure*? 
 - Weele teach you for to drinke ere you depart. 
   Hora.:  - My Lord, I came to see your fathers funerall. 
  Ham.:  - I prethee doe not mocke me fellowe studient, 
 - I thinke it was to my mothers wedding. 
  Hora.:  - Indeede my Lord it followed hard vppon. 
  Ham.:  - Thrift, thrift, *Horatio*, the funerall bak't meates 
 - Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables, 
 - Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen 
 - Or euer I had seene that day *Horatio*, 
 - My father, me thinkes I see my father. 
  Hora.:  - Where my Lord?  
  Ham.:  - In my mindes eye *Horatio.*
  Hora.:  - I saw him once, a was a goodly King. 
  Ham.:  - A was a man take him for all in all 
 - I shall not looke vppon his like againe. 
  Hora.:  - My Lord I thinke I saw him yesternight. 
  Ham.:  - Saw, who?  
  Hora.:  - My Lord the King your father. 
  Ham.:  - The King my father? 
  Hora.:  - Season your admiration for a while 
 - With an attent eare till I may deliuer 
 - Vppon the witnes of these gentlemen  
 - This maruile to you. 
  Ham.:  - For Gods loue let me heare? 
  Hora.:  - Two nights together had these gentlemen  
 - *Marcellus*, and *Barnardo*, on their watch 
 - In the dead wast and middle of the night 
 - Beene thus incountred, a figure like your father  
 - Armed at poynt, exactly *Capapea*
 - Appeares before them, and with solemne march, 
 - Goes slowe and stately by them; thrice he walkt  
 - By their opprest and feare surprised eyes 
 - Within his tronchions length, whil'st they distil'd 
 - Almost to gelly, with the act of feare 
 - Stand dumbe and speake not to him; this to me 
 - In dreadfull secresie impart they did, 
 - And I with them the third night kept the watch, 
 - Whereas they had deliuered both in time 
 - Forme of the thing, each word made true and good, 
 - The Apparision comes: I knewe your father, 
  - These hands are not more like. 
  Ham.:  - But where was this?  
  Mar.:  - My Lord vppon the platforme where we watch, 
  Ham.:  - Did you not speake to it?  
  Hora.:  - My Lord I did, 
 - But answere made it none, yet once me thought 
 - It lifted vp it head, and did addresse 
 - It selfe to motion like as it would speake: 
 - But euen then the morning Cock crewe loude, 
 - And at the sound it shrunk in hast away  
 - And vanisht from our sight. 
  Ham.:  - Tis very strange.  
  Hora.:  - As I doe liue my honor'd Lord tis true 
 - And we did thinke it writ downe in our dutie  
 - To let you knowe of it. 
  Ham.:  - Indeede Sirs but this troubles me, 
 - Hold you the watch to night?  
  All.:  - We doe my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Arm'd say you?  
  All.:  - Arm'd my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - >From top to toe?  
  All.:  - My Lord from head to foote. 
  Ham.:  - Then sawe you not his face.  
  Hora.:  - O yes my Lord, he wore his beauer vp. 
  Ham.:  - What look't he frowningly?  
  Hora.:  - A countenance more in sorrow then in anger. 
  Ham.:  - Pale, or red?  
  Hora.:  - Nay very pale. 
  Ham.:  - And fixt his eyes vpon you?  
  Hora.:  - Most constantly. 
  Ham.:  - I would I had beene there. 
  Hora.:  - It would haue much amaz'd you. 
  Ham.:  - Very like, stay'd it long? 
  Hora.:  - While one with moderate hast might tell a hundreth. 
  Both.:  - Longer, longer.  
  Hora.:  - Not when I saw't. 
  Ham.:  - His beard was grissl'd, no. 
  Hora.:  - It was as I haue seene it in his life  
 - A sable siluer'd. 
   Ham.:  - I will watch to night  
 - Perchaunce twill walke againe. 
  Hora.:  - I warn't it will. 
  Ham.:  - If it assume my noble fathers person, 
 - Ile speake to it though hell it selfe should gape 
 - And bid me hold my peace; I pray you all 
 - If you haue hetherto  conceald this sight 
 - Let it be tenable in your silence still, 
 - And what someuer els shall hap to night, 
 - Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue, 
 - I will requite your loues, so farre you well: 
 - Vppon the platforme twixt a leauen and twelfe  
 - Ile visite you. 
  All.:  - Our dutie to your honor. 
 *Exeunt.*  Ham.:  - Your loues, as mine to you, farwell. 
 - My fathers spirit (in armes) all is not well, 
 - I doubt some foule play, would the night were come, 
 - Till then sit still my soule, fonde deedes will rise 
 - Though all the earth ore-whelme them to mens eyes. 
 *Exit.* *Enter Laertes, and Ophelia his Sister.*  Laer.:  - My necessaries are inbarckt, farwell, 
 - And sister, as the winds giue benefit 
 - And conuay, in assistant doe not sleepe 
 - But let me heere from you.  
  Ophe.:  - Doe you doubt that? 
  Laer.:  - For *Hamlet*, and the trifling of his fauour, 
 - Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood 
 - A Violet in the youth of primy nature, 
 - Forward, not permanent, sweete, not lasting, 
 - The perfume and suppliance of a minute  
 - No more. 
  Ophe.:  - No more but so.  
  Laer.:  - Thinke it no more. 
 - For nature cressant does not growe alone 
 - In thewes and bulkes, but as this temple waxes 
 - The inward seruice of the minde and soule 
 - Growes wide withall, perhapes he loues you now, 
 - And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmirch 
 - The vertue of his will, but you must feare, 
  - His greatnes wayd, his will is not his owne, 
 - He may not as vnualewed persons doe, 
 - Carue for himselfe, for on his choise depends  
 - The safty and health of this whole state, 
 - And therefore must his choise be circumscribd 
 - Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that body 
 - Whereof he is the head, then if he saies he loues you, 
 - It fits your wisdome so farre to belieue it 
 - As he in his particuler act and place 
 - May giue his saying deede, which is no further 
 - Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall. 
 - Then way what losse your honor may sustaine 
 - If with too credent eare you list his songs 
 - Or loose your hart, or your chast treasure open  
 - To his vnmastred importunity.  
 - Feare it *Ophelia*, feare it my deare sister, 
 - And keepe you in the reare of your affection 
 - Out of the shot and danger of desire, 
 - The chariest maide is prodigall inough 
 - If she vnmaske her beutie to the Moone 
 - Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious strokes 
 - The canker gaules the infants of the spring 
 - Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd, 
 - And in the morne and liquid dewe of youth 
 - Contagious blastments are most iminent, 
 - Be wary then, best safety lies in feare, 
 - Youth to it selfe rebels, though non els neare. 
  Ophe.:  - I shall the effect of this good lesson keepe 
 - As watchman to my hart, but good my brother 
 - Doe not as some vngracious pastors doe, 
 - Showe me the steepe and thorny way to heauen 
 - Whiles a puft, and reckles libertine  
 - Himselfe the primrose path of dalience treads. 
 - And reakes not his owne reed. 
 *Enter Polonius.*  Laer.:  - O feare me not, 
 - I stay too long, but heere my father comes 
 - A double blessing, is a double grace, 
 - Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue. 
  Pol.:  - Yet heere *Laertes*? a bord, a bord for shame, 
  - The wind sits in the shoulder of your saile, 
 - And you are stayed for, there my blessing with thee, 
 - And these fewe precepts in thy memory 
 - Looke thou character, giue thy thoughts no tongue, 
 - Nor any vnproportion'd thought his act, 
 - Be thou familier, but by no meanes vulgar, 
 - Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried, 
 - Grapple them vnto thy soule with hoopes of steele, 
 - But doe not dull thy palme with entertainment 
 - Of each new hatcht vnfledgd courage, beware 
 - Of entrance to a quarrell, but being in, 
 - Bear't that th'opposed may beware of thee, 
 - Giue euery man thy eare, but fewe thy voyce, 
 - Take each mans censure, but reserue thy iudgement, 
 - Costly thy habite as thy purse can buy, 
 - But not exprest in fancy; rich not gaudy, 
 - For the apparrell oft proclaimes the man 
 - And they in Fraunce of the best ranck and station, 
 - Or of a most select and generous, chiefe in that: 
 - Neither a borrower nor a lender boy, 
 - For loue oft looses both it selfe, and friend, 
 - And borrowing dulleth edge of husbandry; 
 - This aboue all, to thine owne selfe be true 
 - And it must followe as the night the day 
 - Thou canst not then be false to any man: 
 - Farwell, my blessing season this in thee. 
  Laer.:  - Most humbly doe I take my leaue my Lord. 
  Pol.:  - The time inuests you goe, your seruants tend. 
  Laer.:  - Farwell *Ophelia*, and remember well  
 - What I haue sayd to you. 
  Ophe.:  - Tis in my memory lockt  
 - And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it. 
  Laer.:  - Farwell. 
 *Exit Laertes.*  Pol.:  - What ist *Ophelia* he hath sayd to you? 
  Ophe.:  - So please you, something touching the Lord *Hamlet.*  
  Pol.:  - Marry well bethought 
 - Tis tolde me he hath very oft of late 
 - Giuen priuate time to you, and you your selfe 
 - Haue of your audience beene most free and bountious, 
  - If it be so, as so tis put on me, 
 - And that in way of caution, I must tell you, 
 - You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely 
 - As it behooues my daughter, and your honor, 
 - What is betweene you giue me vp the truth, 
  Ophe.:  - He hath my Lord of late made many tenders  
 - Of his affection to me. 
  Pol.:  - Affection, puh, you speake like a greene girle 
 - Vnsifted in such perrilous circumstance, 
 - Doe you belieue his tenders as you call them? 
  Ophe.:  - I doe not knowe my Lord what I should thinke. 
  Pol.:  - Marry I will teach you, thinke your selfe a babie 
 - That you haue tane these tenders for true pay 
 - Which are not sterling, tender your selfe more dearely 
 - Or (not to crack the winde of the poore phrase 
 - Wrong it thus) you'l tender me a foole. 
  Ophe.:  - My Lord he hath importun'd me with loue  
 - In honorable fashion. 
  Pol.:  - I, fashion you may call it, go to,  go to. 
  Ophe.:  - And hath giuen countenance to his speech 
 - My Lord, with almost all the holy vowes of heauen. 
  Pol.:  - I, springs to catch wood-cockes, I doe knowe 
 - When the blood burnes, how prodigall the soule 
 - Lends the tongue vowes, these blazes daughter 
 - Giuing more light then heate, extinct in both 
 - Euen in their promise, as it is a making 
 - You must not take for fire, from this time 
 - Be something scanter of your maiden presence 
 - Set your intreatments at a higher rate 
 - Then a commaund to parle; for Lord *Hamlet*, 
 - Belieue so much in him that he is young, 
 - And with a larger tider may he walke 
 - Then may be giuen you; in fewe *Ophelia*, 
 - Doe not belieue his vowes, for they are brokers 
 - Not of that die which their inuestments showe 
 - But meere implorators of vnholy suites 
 - Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds 
 - The better to beguile; this is for all, 
 - I would not in plaine tearmes from this time foorth 
  - Haue you so slaunder any moment leasure 
 - As to giue words or talke with the Lord *Hamlet*, 
 - Looke too't I charge you, come your wayes. 
  Ophe.:  - I shall obey my Lord. 
 *Exeunt.* *Enter Hamlet, Horatio and Marcellus.*  Ham.:  - The ayre bites shroudly, it is very colde. 
  Hora.:  - It is nipping, and an eager ayre. 
  Ham.:  - What houre now?  
  Hora.:  - I thinke it lackes of twelfe. 
  Mar.:  - No, it is  strooke.  
  Hora.:  - Indeede; I heard it not, it then drawes neere the season, 
 - Wherein the spirit held his wont to walke. 
 *A florish of trumpets 2. peeces goes of.* - What does this meane my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - The King doth wake to night and takes his rowse. 
 - Keepes wassell and the swaggring vp-spring reeles: 
 - And as he draines his drafts of Rennish downe, 
 - The kettle drumme, and trumpet, thus bray out  
 - The triumph of his pledge. 
  Hora.:  - Is it a custome?  
  Ham.:  - I marry ist, 
 - But to my minde, though I am natiue heere 
 - And to the manner borne, it is a custome 
 - More honourd in the breach, then the obseruance. 
 - This heauy headed reueale east and west 
 - Makes vs tradust, and taxed of other nations, 
 - They clip vs drunkards, and with Swinish phrase 
 - Soyle our addition, and indeede it takes 
 - >From our atchieuements, though perform'd at height 
 - The pith and marrow of our attribute, 
 - So oft it chaunces in particuler men, 
 - That for some vicious mole of nature in them 
 - As in their birth wherein they are not guilty, 
 - (Since nature cannot choose his origin) 
 - By their ore-grow'th of some complextion 
 - Oft breaking downe the pales and forts of reason, 
 - Or by some habit, that too much ore-leauens 
 - The forme of plausiue manners, that these men 
 - Carrying I say the stamp of one defect 
  - Being Natures liuery, or Fortunes starre, 
 - His vertues els be they as pure as grace, 
 - As infinite as man may vndergoe, 
 - Shall in the generall censure take corruption 
 - >From that particuler fault: the dram of eale 
 - Doth all the noble substance of a doubt  
 - To his owne scandle. 
  *Enter Ghost.* Hora.:  - Looke my Lord it comes. 
  Ham.:  - Angels and Ministers of grace defend vs: 
 - Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd, 
 - Bring with thee ayres from heauen, of blasts from hell. 
 - Be thy intents wicked, or charitable, 
 - Thou com'st in such a questionable shape, 
 - That I will speake to thee, Ile call thee *Hamlet*, 
 - King, father, royall Dane, o answere mee, 
 - Let me not burst in ignorance, but tell 
 - Why thy canoniz'd bones hearsed in death 
 - Haue burst their cerements? why the Sepulcher, 
 - Wherein we saw thee quietly interr'd 
 - Hath op't his ponderous and marble iawes, 
 - To cast thee vp againe? what may this meane 
 - That thou dead corse, againe in compleat steele 
 - Reuisites thus the glimses of the Moone, 
 - Making night hideous, and we fooles of nature 
 - So horridly to shake our disposition 
 - With thoughts beyond the reaches of our soules, 
 - Say why is this, wherefore, what should we doe? 
  *Beckins.* Hora.:  - It beckins you to goe away with it 
 - As if it some impartment did desire ? To you alone. 
  Mar.:  - Looke with what curteous action 
 - It waues you to a more remooued ground, 
 - But doe not goe with it.  
  Hora.:  - No, by no meanes. 
  Ham.:  - It will not speake, then I will followe it.  
  Hora.:  - Doe not my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Why what should be the feare, 
 - I doe not set my life at a pinnes fee, 
  - And for my soule, what can it doe to that 
 - Being a thing immortall as it selfe; 
 - It waues me forth againe, Ile followe it. 
  Hora.:  - What if it tempt you toward the flood my Lord, 
 - Or to the dreadfull somnet of the cleefe 
 - That bettles ore his base into the sea, 
 - And there assume some other horrable forme 
 - Which might depriue your soueraigntie of reason. 
 - And draw you into madnes, thinke of it, 
 - The very place puts toyes of desperation 
 - Without more motiue, into euery braine 
 - That lookes so many fadoms to the sea 
 - And heares it rore beneath. 
  Ham.:  - It waues me still,  
 - Goe on, Ile followe thee. 
  Mar.:  - You shall not goe my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Hold of your hands. 
  Hora.:  - Be rul'd, you shall not goe. 
  Ham.:  - My fate cries out  
 - And makes each petty arture in this body 
 - As hardy as the Nemeon Lyons nerue; 
 - Still am I cald, vnhand me Gentlemen 
 - By heauen Ile make a ghost of him that lets me, 
 - I say away, goe on, Ile followe thee. 
 *Exit Ghost and Hamlet.*  Hora.:  - He waxes desperate with imagination. 
  Mar.:  - Lets followe, tis not fit thus to obey him. 
  Hora.:  - Haue after, to what issue will this come? 
  Mar.:  - Something is rotten in the state of Denmarke. 
  Hora.:  - Heauen will direct it.  
  Mar.:  - Nay lets follow him. 
 *Exeunt.* *Enter Ghost, and Hamlet.*  Ham.:  - Whether wilt thou leade me, speake, Ile goe no further. 
  Ghost.:  - Marke me. 
  Ham.:  - I will. 
  Ghost.:  - My houre is almost come 
 - When I to sulphrus and tormenting flames  
 - Must render vp my selfe. 
  Ham.:  - Alas poore Ghost. 
   Ghost.:  - Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing  
 - To what I shall vnfold. 
  Ham.:  - Speake, I am bound to heare. 
  Ghost.:  - So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare. 
  Ham.:  - What?  
  Ghost.:  - I am thy fathers spirit, 
 - Doomd for a certaine tearme to walke the night, 
 - And for the day confind to fast in fires, 
 - Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of nature 
 - Are burnt and purg'd away: but that I am forbid 
 - To tell the secrets of my prison house, 
 - I could a tale vnfolde whose lightest word 
 - Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood, 
 - Make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres, 
 - Thy knotted and combined locks to part, 
 - And each particuler haire to stand an end, 
 - Like quils vpon the fearefull Porpentine, 
 - But this eternall blazon must not be 
 - To eares of flesh and blood, list, list, o list: 
 - If thou did'st euer thy deare father loue.  
  Ham.:  - O God. 
  Ghost.:  - Reuenge his foule, and most vnnaturall murther. 
  Ham.:  - Murther.  
  Ghost.:  - Murther most foule, as in the best it is, 
 - But this most foule, strange and vnnaturall. 
  Ham.:  - Hast me to know't, that I with wings as swift 
 - As meditation, or the thoughts of loue  
 - May sweepe to my reuenge. 
  Ghost.:  - I find thee apt,  
 - And duller shouldst thou be then the fat weede 
 - That rootes it selfe in ease on *Lethe* wharffe, 
 - Would'st thou not sturre in this; now *Hamlet* heare, 
 - Tis giuen out, that sleeping in my Orchard, 
 - A Serpent stung me, so the whole eare of Denmarke 
 - Is by a forged processe of my death 
 - Ranckely abusde: but knowe thou noble Youth, 
 - The Serpent that did sting thy fathers life  
 - Now weares his Crowne. 
  Ham.:  - O my propheticke soule! my Vncle? 
   Ghost.:  - I that incestuous, that adulterate beast, 
 - With witchcraft of his wits, with trayterous gifts, 
 - O wicked wit, and giftes that haue the power 
 - So to seduce; wonne to his shamefull lust 
 - The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene; 
 - O *Hamlet*, what falling off was there 
 - >From me whose loue was of that dignitie 
 - That it went hand in hand, euen with the vowe 
 - I made to her in marriage, and to decline 
 - Vppon a wretch whose naturall gifts were poore, 
 - To those of mine; but vertue as it neuer will be mooued, 
 - Though lewdnesse court it in a shape of heauen 
 - So but though to a radiant Angle linckt, 
 - Will sort it selfe in a celestiall bed  
 - And pray on garbage. 
 - But soft, me thinkes I sent the morning ayre, 
 - Briefe let me be; sleeping within my Orchard, 
 - My custome alwayes of the afternoone, 
 - Vpon my secure houre, thy Vncle stole 
 - With iuyce of cursed Hebona in a viall, 
 - And in the porches of my eares did poure 
 - The leaprous distilment, whose effect 
 - Holds such an enmitie with blood of man, 
 - That swift as quicksiluer it courses through 
 - The naturall gates and allies of the body, 
 - And with a sodaine vigour it doth possesse 
 - And curde like eager droppings into milke, 
 - The thin and wholsome blood; so did it mine, 
 - And a most instant tetter barckt about 
 - Most Lazerlike with vile and lothsome crust  
 - All my smooth body. 
 - Thus was I sleeping by a brothers hand, 
 - Of life, of Crowne, of Queene at once dispatcht, 
 - Cut off euen in the blossomes of my sinne,  
 - Vnhuzled, disappointed, vnanueld, 
 - No reckning made, but sent to my account  
 - Withall  my imperfections on my head, 
 - O horrible, o horrible, most horrible. 
 - If thou hast nature in thee beare it not, 
  - Let not the royall bed of Denmarke be 
 - A couch for luxury and damned incest. 
 - But howsomeuer thou pursues this act, 
 - Tain't not thy minde, nor let thy soule contriue 
 - Against thy mother ought, leaue her to heauen, 
 - And to those thornes that in her bosome lodge 
 - To prick and sting her, fare thee well at once, 
 - The Gloworme shewes the matine to be neere 
 - And gins to pale his vneffectuall fire, 
 - Adiew, adiew, adiew, remember me. 
  Ham.:  - O all you host of heauen, o earth, what els, 
 - And shall I coupple hell, o fie, hold, hold my hart, 
 - And you my sinnowes, growe not instant old, 
 - But beare me swiftly vp; remember thee, 
 - I thou poore Ghost whiles memory holds a seate 
 - In this distracted globe, remember thee, 
 - Yea, from the table of my memory  
 - Ile wipe away all triuiall fond records, 
 - All sawes of bookes, all formes, all pressures past 
 - That youth and obseruation coppied there, 
 - And thy commandement all alone shall liue, 
 - Within the booke and volume of my braine 
 - Vnmixt with baser matter, yes by heauen, 
 - O most pernicious woman. 
 - O villaine, villaine, smiling damned villaine, 
 - My tables, meet it is I set it downe 
 - That one may smile, and smile, and be a villaine, 
 - At least I am sure it may be so in Denmarke. 
 - So Vncle, there you are, now to my word, 
 - It is adew, adew, remember me.  
 - I haue sworn't. 
 *Enter Horatio, and Marcellus.*  Hora.:  - My Lord, my Lord.  
  Mar.:  - Lord *Hamlet.*
  Hora.:  - Heauens secure him.  
  Ham.:  - So be it. 
  Mar.:  - Illo, ho, ho, my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Hillo, ho, ho, boy come, and come. 
   Mar.:  - How i'st my noble Lord? 
  Hora.:  - What newes my Lord?  
  Ham.:  - O, wonderfull. 
  Hora.:  - Good my Lord tell it.  
  Ham.:  - No, you will reueale it. 
  Hora.:  - Not I my Lord by heauen.  
  Mar.:  - Nor I my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - How say you then, would hart of man once thinke it, 
 - But you'le be secret. 
  Booth.:  - I by heauen. 
  Ham.:  - There's neuer a villaine,  
 - Dwelling in all Denmarke 
 - But hee's an arrant knaue. 
  Hora.:  - There needes no Ghost my Lord, come from the graue  
 - To tell vs this. 
  Ham.:  - Why right, you are in the right, 
 - And so without more circumstance at all 
 - I hold it fit that we shake hands and part, 
 - You, as your busines and desire shall poynt you, 
 - For euery man hath busines and desire 
 - Such as it is, and for my owne poore part  
 - I will goe pray. 
  Hora.:  - These are but wilde and whurling words my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I am sorry they offend you hartily, 
 - Yes faith hartily.  
  Hora.:  - There's no offence my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Yes by Saint *Patrick* but there is *Horatio*, 
 - And much offence to, touching this vision heere, 
 - It is an honest Ghost that let me tell you, 
 - For your desire to knowe what is betweene vs 
 - Oremastret as you may, and now good friends, 
 - As you are friends, schollers, and souldiers, 
 - Giue me one poore request.  
  Hora.:  - What i'st my Lord, we will. 
  Ham.:  - Neuer make knowne what you haue seene to night. 
  Booth.:  - My Lord we will not.  
  Ham.:  - Nay but swear't. 
  Hora.:  - In faith my Lord not I. 
  Mar.:  - Nor I my Lord in faith. 
   Ham.:  - Vppon my sword.  
  Mar.:  - We haue sworne my Lord already. 
  Ham.:  - Indeede vppon my sword, indeed. 
  *Ghost cries vnder the Stage.* Ghost.:  - Sweare. 
  Ham.:  - Ha, ha, boy, say'st thou so, art thou there trupenny? 
 - Come on, you heare this fellowe in the Sellerige,  
 - Consent to sweare. 
  Hora.:  - Propose the oath my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene  
 - Sweare by my sword. 
  Ghost.:  - Sweare. 
  Ham.:  - *Hic, & vbique*, then weele shift our ground: 
 - Come hether Gentlemen  
 - And lay your hands againe vpon my sword, 
 - Sweare by my sword  
 - Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard. 
  Ghost.:  - Sweare by his sword. 
  Ham.:  - Well sayd olde Mole, can'st work i'th earth so fast, 
 - A worthy Pioner, once more remooue good friends. 
  Hora.:  - O day and night, but this is wondrous strange. 
  Ham.:  - And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome, 
 - There are more things in heauen and earth *Horatio*
 - Then are dream't of in your philosophie, but come 
 - Heere as before, neuer so helpe you mercy, 
 - (How strange or odde so mere I beare my selfe, 
 - As I perchance heereafter  shall thinke meet, 
 - To put an Anticke disposition on 
 - That you at such times seeing me, neuer shall 
 - With armes incombred thus, or this head shake, 
 - Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull phrase, 
 - As well, well, we knowe, or we could and if we would, 
 - Or if we list to speake, or there be and if they might, 
 - Or such ambiguous giuing out, to note) 
 - That you knowe ought of me, this doe sweare, 
 - So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you. 
  Ghost.:  - Sweare.  
  Ham.:  - Rest, rest, perturbed spirit: so Gentlemen, 
 - Withall my loue I doe commend me to you, 
  - And what so poore a man as *Hamlet* is, 
 - May doe t'expresse his loue and frending to you 
 - God willing shall not lack, let vs goe in together, 
 - And still your fingers on your lips I pray, 
 - The time is out of ioynt, o cursed spight  
 - That euer I was borne to set it right. 
 - Nay come, lets goe together. 
 *Exeunt.* *Enter old Polonius, with his man or two.*  Pol.:  - Giue him this money, and these notes *Reynaldo.*  
  Rey.:  - I will my Lord. 
  Pol.:  - You shall doe meruiles wisely good *Reynaldo*, 
 - Before you visite him, to make inquire  
 - Of his behauiour. 
  Rey.:  - My Lord, I did intend it. 
  Pol.:  - Mary well said, very well said; looke you sir, 
 - Enquire me first what Danskers are in Parris, 
 - And how, and who, what meanes, and where they keepe, 
 - What companie, at what expence, and finding  
 - By this encompasment, and drift of question 
 - That they doe know my sonne, come you more neerer 
 - Then your perticular demaunds will tuch it, 
 - Take you as t'were some distant knowledge of him, 
 - As thus, I know his father, and his friends, 
 - And in part him, doe you marke this *Reynaldo*?  
  Rey.:  - I, very well my Lord. 
  Pol.:  - And in part him, but you may say, not well, 
 - But yf't be he I meane, hee's very wilde, 
 - Adicted so and so, and there put on him 
 - What forgeries you please, marry none so ranck 
 - As may dishonour him, take heede of that, 
 - But sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips, 
 - As are companions noted and most knowne  
 - To youth and libertie. 
  Rey.:  - As gaming my Lord.  
  Pol.:  - I, or drinking, fencing, swearing, 
 - Quarrelling, drabbing, you may goe so far. 
  Rey.:  - My Lord, that would dishonour him, 
  Pol.:  - Fayth as you may season it in the charge. 
  - You must not put another scandell on him, 
 - That he is open to incontinencie, 
 - That's not my meaning, but breath his faults so queintly 
 - That they may seeme the taints of libertie, 
 - The flash and out-breake of a fierie mind, 
 - A sauagenes in vnreclamed blood,  
 - Of generall assault. 
  Rey.:  - But my good Lord.  
  Pol.:  - Wherefore should you doe this? 
  Rey.:  - I my Lord, I would know that. 
  Pol.:  - Marry sir, heer's my drift, 
 - And I belieue it is a fetch of wit, 
 - You laying these slight sallies on my sonne 
 - As t'were a thing a little soyld with working, 
 - Marke you, your partie in conuerse, him you would sound 
 - Hauing euer seene in the prenominat crimes 
 - The youth you breath of guiltie, be assur'd 
 - He closes with you in this consequence, 
 - Good sir, (or so,) of friend, or gentleman, 
 - According to the phrase, or the addition  
 - Of man and country. 
  Rey.:  - Very good my Lord. 
  Pol.:  - And then sir doos a this, a doos, what was I about to say? 
 - By the masse I was about to say something,  
 - Where did I leaue? 
  Rey.:  - At closes in the consequence. 
  Pol.:  - At closes in the consequence, I marry, 
 - He closes thus, I know the gentleman, 
 - I saw him yesterday, or th'other day, 
 - Or then, or then, with such or such, and as you say, 
 - There was a gaming there, or tooke in's rowse, 
 - There falling out at Tennis, or perchance 
 - I saw him enter such a house of sale, 
 - Videlizet, a brothell, or so foorth, see you now, 
 - Your bait of falshood take this carpe of truth, 
 - And thus doe we of wisedome, and of reach, 
 - With windlesses, and with  assaies of bias,  
 - By indirections find directions out, 
 - So by my former lecture and aduise 
  - Shall you my sonne; you haue me, haue you not?  
  Rey.:  - My Lord, I haue. 
  Pol.:  - God buy ye, far ye well.  
  Rey.:  - Good my Lord. 
  Pol.:  - Obserue his inclination in your selfe.  
  Rey.:  - I shall my lord. 
  Pol.:  - And let him ply his musique.  
  Rey.:  - Well my Lord. 
 *Exit Rey.* *Enter Ophelia.*  Pol.:  - Farewell. How now *Ophelia*,  whats the matter? 
  Oph.:  - O my Lord, my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted. 
  Pol.:  - With what i'th name of God? 
  Ophe.:  - My Lord, as I was sowing in my closset, 
 - Lord *Hamlet* with his doublet all vnbrac'd, 
 - No hat vpon his head, his stockings fouled, 
 - Vngartred, and downe gyued to his ancle, 
 - Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, 
 - And with a looke so pittious in purport 
 - As if he had been loosed out of hell 
 - To speake of horrors, he comes before me. 
  Pol.:  - Mad for thy loue? 
  Oph.:  - My lord I doe not know,  
 - But truly I doe feare it. 
  Pol.:  - What said he?  
  Oph.:  - He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard, 
 - Then goes he to the length of all his arme, 
 - And with his other hand thus ore his brow, 
 - He falls to such perusall of my face 
 - As a would draw it, long stayd he so, 
 - At last, a little shaking of mine arme, 
 - And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe, 
 - He raisd a sigh so pittious and profound 
 - As it did seeme to shatter all his bulke, 
 - And end his beeing; that done, he lets me goe, 
 - And with his head ouer his shoulder turn'd 
 - Hee seem'd to find his way without his eyes, 
 - For out adoores he went without theyr helps, 
 - And to the last bended their light on me. 
   Pol.:  - Come, goe with mee, I will goe seeke the King, 
 - This is the very extacie of loue, 
 - Whose violent propertie fordoos it selfe, 
 - And leades the will to desperat vndertakings 
 - As oft as any passions vnder heauen 
 - That dooes afflict our natures: I am sorry, 
 - What, haue you giuen him any hard words of late? 
  Oph.:  - No my good Lord, but as you did commaund 
 - I did repell his letters, and denied  
 - His accesse to me. 
  Pol.:  - That hath made him mad. 
 - I am sorry, that with better heede and iudgement 
 - I had not coted him, I fear'd he did but trifle 
 - And meant to wrack thee, but beshrow my Ielousie: 
 - By heauen it is as proper to our age 
 - To cast beyond our selues in our opinions, 
 - As it is common for the younger sort 
 - To lack discretion; come, goe we to the King, 
 - This must be knowne, which beeing kept close, might moue 
 - More griefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue, 
 - Come. 
  *Exeunt.* *Florish.* *Enter King and Queene, Rosencraus and Guyldensterne.* King.:  - Welcome deere *Rosencraus*, and *Guyldensterne*,

 - Of *Hamlets* transformation, so call it,

 - Resembles that it was, what it should be, 
 - More then his fathers death, that thus hath put him 
 - So much from th'vnderstanding of himselfe 
 - I cannot dreame of: I entreate you both 
 - That beeing of so young dayes brought vp with him, 
 - And sith so nabored to his youth and hauior, 
 - That you voutsafe your rest heere in our Court 
 - Some little time, so by your companies 
 - To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather 
  - So much as from occasion you may gleane, 
 - Whether ought to vs vnknowne afflicts him thus, 
 - That opend lyes within our remedie. 
  Quee.:  - Good gentlemen, he hath much talkt of you, 
 - And sure I am, two men there is not liuing 
 - To whom he more adheres, if it will please you 
 - To shew vs so much gentry and good will, 
 - As to expend your time with vs a while, 
 - For the supply and profit of our hope, 
 - Your visitation shall receiue such thanks  
 - As fits a Kings remembrance. 
  Ros.:  - Both your Maiesties  
 - Might by the soueraigne power you haue of vs, 
 - Put your dread pleasures more into commaund  
 - Then to entreatie. 
  Guyl.:  - But we both obey,  
 - And heere giue vp our selues in the full bent,

 *Exeunt Ros. and Guyld.* *Enter Polonius.*  Pol.:  - Th'embassadors from *Norway* my good Lord,  
 - Are ioyfully returnd. 
  King.:  - Thou still hast been the father of good newes. 
  Pol.:  - Haue I my Lord? I assure my good Liege 
 - I hold my dutie as I hold my soule, 
 - Both to my God, and to my gracious King; 
 - And I doe thinke, or els this braine of mine 
 - Hunts not the trayle of policie so sure 
 - As it hath vsd to doe, that I haue found  
 - The very cause of *Hamlets* lunacie.  
  King.:  - O speake of that, that doe I long to heare. 
   Pol.:  - Giue first admittance to th'embassadors, 
 - My newes shall be the fruite to that great feast. 
  King.:  - Thy selfe doe grace to them, and bring them in. 
 - He tells me my deere *Gertrard* he hath found 
 - The head and source of all your sonnes distemper. 
  Quee.:  - I doubt it is no other but the maine 
 - His fathers death, and our hastie marriage. 
 *Enter Embassadors.*  King.:  - Well, we shall sift him, welcome my good friends, 
 - Say *Voltemand*, what from our brother *Norway*? 
  Vol.:  - Most faire returne of greetings and desires; 
 - Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse 
 - His Nephews leuies, which to him appeard  
 - To be a preparation gainst the *Pollacke*, 
 - But better lookt into, he truly found  
 - It was against your highnes, whereat greeu'd 
 - That so his sicknes, age, and impotence 
 - Was falsly borne in hand, sends out arrests 
 - On *Fortenbrasse*, which he in breefe obeyes, 
 - Receiues rebuke from *Norway*, and in fine, 
 - Makes vow before his Vncle neuer more 
 - To giue th'assay of Armes against your Maiestie: 
 - Whereon old *Norway* ouercome with ioy, 
 - Giues him threescore thousand crownes in anuall fee, 
 - And his commission to imploy those souldiers 
 - So leuied (as before) against the *Pollacke*, 
 - With an entreatie heerein further shone, 
 - That it might please you to giue quiet passe 
 - Through your dominions for this enterprise 
 - On such regards of safety and allowance  
 - As therein are set downe. 
  King.:  - It likes vs well,  
 - And at our more considered time, wee'le read, 
 - Answer, and thinke vpon this busines: 
 - Meane time, we thanke you for your well tooke labour, 
 - Goe to your rest, at night weele feast together, 
 - Most welcome home. 
 *Exeunt Embassadors.*  Pol.:  - This busines is well ended. 
  - My Liege and Maddam, to expostulate 
 - What maiestie should be, what dutie is, 
 - Why day is day, night, night, and time is time, 
 - Were nothing but to wast night, day, and time, 
 - Therefore breuitie is the soule of wit, 
 - And tediousnes the lymmes and outward florishes, 
 - I will be briefe, your noble sonne is mad: 
 - Mad call I it, for to define true madnes, 
 - What ist but to be nothing els but mad,  
 - But let that goe. 
  Quee.:  - More matter with lesse art. 
  Pol.:  - Maddam, I sweare I vse no art at all, 
 - That hee's mad tis true, tis true, tis pitty, 
 - And pitty tis tis true, a foolish figure, 
 - But farewell it, for I will vse no art. 
 - Mad let vs graunt him then, and now remaines 
 - That we find out the cause of this effect, 
 - Or rather say, the cause of this defect, 
 - For this effect defectiue comes by cause: 
 - Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus  
 - Perpend, 
 - I haue a daughter, haue while she is mine, 
 - Who in her dutie and obedience, marke, 
 - Hath giuen me this, now gather and surmise. 
 - *To the Celestiall and my soules Idoll, the most beau-tified*
 - Ophelia, *that's an ill phrase, a vile phrase*, 
 - *beautified is a vile phrase, but you shall heare: thus in*  
 - *her excellent white bosome, these &c.*
  Quee.:  - Came this from *Hamlet* to her? 
  Pol.:  - Good Maddam stay awhile, I will be faithfull, 
 *Letter.* - *Doubt thou the starres are fire*, 
 - *Doubt that the Sunne doth moue*, 
 - *Doubt truth to be a lyer*, 
 - *But neuer doubt I loue.*
 - O deere *Ophelia*, I am ill at these numbers, I haue not art to recken 
 - my grones, but that I loue thee best, o most best belieue it, adew. 
 - Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this machine is to him.  
 - (*Hamlet.*
  Pol.:  - This in obedience hath my daughter showne me, 
 - And more about hath his solicitings 
  - As they fell out by time, by meanes, and place,  
 - All giuen to mine eare. 
  King.:  - But how hath she receiu'd his loue? 
  Pol.:  - What doe you thinke of me?  
  King.:  - As of a man faithfull and honorable. 
  Pol.:  - I would faine proue so, but what might you thinke 
 - When I had seene this hote loue on the wing, 
 - As I perceiu'd it (I must tell you that) 
 - Before my daughter told me, what might you, 
 - Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere thinke, 
 - If I had playd the Deske, or Table booke, 
 - Or giuen my hart a working mute and dumbe, 
 - Or lookt vppon this loue with idle sight, 
 - What might you thinke? no, I went round to worke, 
 - And my young Mistris thus I did bespeake, 
 - Lord *Hamlet* is a Prince out of thy star, 
 - This must not be: and then I prescripts gaue her 
 - That she should locke her selfe from her resort, 
 - Admit no messengers, receiue no tokens, 
 - Which done, she tooke the fruites of my aduise: 
 - And he repell'd, a short tale to make, 
 - Fell into a sadnes, then into a fast, 
 - Thence to a watch, thence into a weakenes, 
 - Thence to lightnes, and by this declension, 
 - Into the madnes wherein now he raues,  
 - And all we mourne for. 
  King.:  - Doe you thinke this?  
  Quee.:  - It may be very like. 
  Pol.:  - Hath there been such a time, I would faine know that, 
 - That I haue positiuely said, tis so, 
 - When it proou'd otherwise?  
  King.:  - Not that I know. 
  Pol.:  - Take this, from this, if this be otherwise; 
 - If circumstances leade me, I will finde 
 - Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede  
 - Within the Center. 
  King.:  - How may we try it further? 
  Pol.:  - You know sometimes he walkes foure houres together 
 - Heere in the Lobby. 
   Quee.:  - So he dooes indeede. 
  Pol.:  - At such a time, Ile loose my daughter to him, 
 - Be you and I behind an Arras then, 
 - Marke the encounter, if he loue her not, 
 - And be not from his reason falne thereon 
 - Let me be no assistant for a state  
 - But keepe a farme and carters. 
  King.:  - We will try it. 
 *Enter Hamlet.*  Quee.:  - But looke where sadly the poore wretch comes reading. 
  Pol.:  - Away, I doe beseech you both away, 
 *Exit King and Queene.* - Ile bord him presently, oh giue me leaue, 
 - How dooes my good Lord *Hamlet*?  
  Ham.:  - Well, God a mercy. 
  Pol.:  - Doe you knowe me my Lord?  
  Ham.:  - Excellent well, you are a Fishmonger. 
  Pol.:  - Not I my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Then I would you were so honest a man. 
  Pol.:  - Honest my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - I sir to be honest as this world goes, 
 - Is to be one man pickt out of tenne thousand. 
  Pol.:  - That's very true my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - For if the sunne breede maggots in a dead dogge, being a  
 - good kissing carrion. Haue you a daughter? 
  Pol.:  - I haue my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Let her not walke i'th Sunne, conception is a blessing, 
 - But as your daughter may conceaue, friend looke to't. 
  Pol.:  - How say you by that, still harping on my daughter, yet hee 
 - knewe me not at first, a sayd I was a Fishmonger, a is farre gone, 
 - and truly in my youth, I suffred much extremity for loue, very 
 - neere this. Ile speake to him againe. What doe you reade my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Words, words, words. 
  Pol.:  - What is the matter my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Betweene who. 
  Pol.:  - I meane the matter that you reade my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Slaunders sir; for the satericall rogue sayes heere, that old 
 - men haue gray beards, that their faces are wrinckled, their eyes 
 - purging thick Amber, & plumtree gum, & that they haue a plen-tifull 
  - lacke of wit, together with most weake hams, all which sir 
 - though I most powerfully and potentlie belieue, yet I hold it not 
 - honesty to haue it thus set downe, for your selfe sir shall growe old 
 - as I am: if like a Crab you could goe backward. 
  Pol.:  - Though this be madnesse, yet there is method in't, will you  
 - walke out of the ayre my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - Into my graue. 
  Pol.:  - Indeede that's out of the ayre; how pregnant sometimes 
 - his replies are, a happines that often madnesse hits on, which reason 
 - and sanctity could not so prosperously be deliuered of. I will leaue 
 - him and my daughter. My Lord, I will take my leaue of you. 
  Ham.:  - You cannot take from mee any thing that I will not more 
 - willingly part withall: except my life, except my life, except my  
 - life. 
  *Enter Guyldersterne, and Rosencraus.* Pol.:  - Fare you well my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - These tedious old fooles. 
  Pol.:  - You goe to seeke the Lord *Hamlet*, there he is. 
  Ros.:  - God saue you sir. 
  Guyl.:  - My honor'd Lord.  
  Ros.:  - My most deere Lord. 
  Ham.:  - My extent good friends, how doost thou *Guyldersterne*? 
 - A *Rosencraus*, good lads how doe you both? 
  Ros.:  - As the indifferent children of the earth. 
  Guyl.:  - Happy, in that we are not euer happy on Fortunes lap, 
 - We are not the very button. 
  Ham.:  - Nor the soles of her shooe.  
  Ros.:  - Neither my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Then you liue about her wast, or in the middle of her fa-(uors. 
  Guyl.:  - Faith her priuates we. 
  Ham.:  - In the secret parts of Fortune, oh most true, she is a strumpet, 
 - What newes?  
  Ros.:  - None my Lord, but the worlds growne honest. 
  Ham.:  - Then is Doomes day neere, but your newes is not true; 
 - But in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at *Elsonoure*? 
  Ros.:  - To visit you my Lord, no other occasion. 
  Ham.:  - Begger that I am, I am euer poore in thankes, but I thanke 
 - you, and sure deare friends, my thankes are too deare a halfpeny: 
 - were you not sent for? is it your owne inclining? is it a free visitati-on? 
 - come, come, deale iustly with me, come, come, nay speake. 
  Guy.:  - What should we say my Lord? 
   Ham.:  - Any thing but to'th purpose: you were sent for, and there is 
 - a kind of confession in your lookes, which your modesties haue not 
 - craft enough to cullor, I know the good King and Queene haue  
 - sent for you. 
  Ros.:  - To what end my Lord?  
  Ham.:  - That you must teach me: but let me coniure you, by the 
 - rights of our fellowship,  by the consonancie of our youth, by the 
 - obligation of our euer preserued loue; and by what more deare a 
 - better proposer can charge you withall, bee euen and direct with 
 - me whether you were sent for or no.  
  Ros.:  - What say you. 
  Ham.:  - Nay then I haue an eye of you? if you loue me hold not of. 
  Guyl.:  - My Lord we were sent for. 
  Ham.:  - I will tell you why, so shall my anticipation preuent your 
 - discouery, your secrecie to the King & Queene moult no fea-ther, 
 - I haue of late, but wherefore I knowe not, lost all my mirth, 
 - forgon all custome of exercises: and indeede it goes so heauily with 
 - my disposition, that this goodly frame the earth, seemes to mee a 
 - sterill promontorie, this most excellent Canopie the ayre, looke 
 - you, this braue orechanging firmament, this maiesticall roofe fret-ted 
 - with golden fire, why it appeareth nothing to me but a foule 
 - and pestilent congregation of vapoures. What peece of worke is a 
 - man, how noble in reason, how infinit in faculties, in forme and 
 - moouing, how expresse and admirable in action, how like an An-gell 
 - in apprehension, how like a God: the beautie of the world; the 
 - paragon of Annimales; and yet to me, what is this Quintessence of 
 - dust: man delights not me, nor women neither, though by your  
 - smilling you seeme to say so. 
  Ros.:  - My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my thoughts. 
  Ham.:  - Why did yee laugh then, when I sayd man delights not me. 
  Ros.:  - To thinke my Lord if you delight not in man, what Lenton 
 - entertainment the players shall receaue from you, we coted them 
 - on the way, and hether are they comming to offer you seruice. 
  Ham.:  - He that playes the King shal be welcome, his Maiestie shal 
 - haue tribute on me, the aduenterous Knight shall vse his foyle and 
 - target, the Louer shall not sigh gratis, the humorus Man shall end 
 - his part in peace, and the Lady shall say her minde freely: or the 
 - blanck verse shall hault for't. What players are they? 
  Ros.:  - Euen those you were wont to take such delight in, the Trage-dians 
 - of the Citty. 
   Ham.:  - How chances it they trauaile? their residence both in repu-tation,and 
 - profit was better both wayes. 
  Ros.:  - I thinke their inhibition, comes by the meanes of the late  
 - innouasion. 
  Ham.:  - Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in  
 - the Citty; are they so followed. 
  Ros.:  - No indeede are they not. 
  Ham.:  - It is not very strange, for my Vncle is King of Denmarke, and 
 - those that would make mouths at him while my father liued, giue 
 - twenty, fortie, fifty, a hundred duckets a peece for his Picture 
 - in little, s'bloud there is somthing in this more then naturall, if 
 - Philosophie could find it out. 
  *A Florish.* Guyl.:  - There are the players. 
  Ham.:  - Gentlemen you are welcome to *Elsonoure*, your hands come 
 - then, th'appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremonie; let 
 - mee comply with you in this garb: let me extent to the players, 
 - which I tell you must showe fairely outwards, should more ap-peare 
 - like entertainment then yours? you are welcome: but my 
 - vncle-father, and Aunt-mother, are deceaued.  
  Guyl.:  - In what my deare Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I am but mad North North west; when the wind is Sou-therly, 
 - I knowe a Hauke, from a hand saw. 
  *Enter Polonius.* Pol.:  - Well be with you Gentlemen. 
  Ham.:  - Harke you *Guyldensterne*, and you to, at each eare a hearer, 
 - that great baby you see there is not yet out of his swadling clouts. 
  Ros.:  - Happily he is the second time come to them, for they say an  
 - old man is twice a child. 
  Ham.:  - I will prophecy, he comes to tell me of the players, mark it, 
 - You say right sir, a Monday morning, t'was  then indeede. 
  Pol.:  - My Lord I haue newes to tell you. 
  Ham.:  - My Lord I haue newes to tel you: when *Rossius* was an Actor  
 - in rome.  
  Pol.:  - The Actors are come hether my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Buz, buz.  
  Pol.:  - Vppon my honor. 
  Ham.:  - Then came each Actor on his Asse. 
  Pol.:  - The best actors in the world, either for Tragedie, Comedy, 
 - History, Pastorall, Pastorall Comicall, Historicall Pastorall, scene 
  - indeuidible, or Poem vnlimited, *Sceneca* cannot be too heauy, nor 
 - *Plautus* too light for the lawe of writ, and the liberty: these are the  
 - only men. 
  Ham.:  - O *Ieptha* Iudge of Israell, what a treasure had'st thou? 
  Pol.:  - What a treasure had he my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - Why one faire daughter and no more, the which he loued  
 - passing well. 
  Pol.:  - Still on my daughter. 
  Ham.:  - Am I not i'th right old *Ieptha*? 
  Pol.:  - If you call me *Ieptha* my Lord, I haue a daughter that I loue  
 - passing well. 
  Ham.:  - Nay that followes not. 
  Pol.:  - What followes then my lord? 
  Ham.:  - Why as by lot God wot, and then you knowe it came to 
 - passe, as most like it was; the first rowe of the pious chanson will 
 - showe you more, for looke where my abridgment comes. 
  *Enter the Players.* Ham.:  - You are welcome maisters, welcome all, I am glad to see thee 
 - well, welcome good friends, oh old friend, why thy face is va-lanct 
 - since I saw thee last, com'st thou to beard me in Denmark? 
 - what my young Lady and mistris, by lady your Ladishippe is 
 - nerer to heauen, then when I saw you last by the altitude of a 
 - chopine, pray God your voyce like a peece of vncurrant gold, 
 - bee not crackt within the ring: maisters you are all welcome, 
 - weele ento't like friendly Faukners, fly at any thing we see, 
 - weele haue a speech straite, come giue vs a tast of your quality, 
 - come a passionate speech. 
  Player.:  - What speech my good Lord? 
  Ham.:  - I heard thee speake me a speech once, but it was neuer acted, 
 - or if it was, not aboue once, for the play I remember pleasd not 
 - the million, t'was cauiary to the generall, but it was as I receaued 
 - it & others, whose iudgements in such matters cried in the top 
 - of mine, an excellent play, well digested in the scenes, set downe 
 - with as much modestie as cunning. I remember one sayd there 
 - were no sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory, nor no 
 - matter in the phrase that might indite the author of affection, 
 - but cald it an honest method, as wholesome as sweete, & by very 
 - much, more handsome then fine: one speech in't I chiefely loued, 
 - t'was *Aeneas* talke to *Dido*, & there about of it especially when he 
 - speakes of *Priams* slaughter, if it liue in your memory begin at 
 - this line, let me see, let me see, the rugged *Pirhus* like Th'ircanian 
  - beast, tis not so, it beginnes with *Pirrhus*, the rugged *Pirrhus*, he whose  
 - sable Armes, 
 - Black as his purpose did the night resemble, 
 - When he lay couched in th'omynous horse, 
 - Hath now this dread and black complection smeard, 
 - With heraldy more dismall head to foote, 
 - Now is he totall Gules horridly trickt 
 - With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sonnes, 
 - Bak'd and empasted with the parching streetes 
 - That lend a tirranus and a damned light 
 - To their Lords murther, rosted in wrath and fire, 
 - And thus ore-cised with coagulate gore, 
 - With eyes like Carbunkles, the hellish *Phirrhus*
 - old grandsire *Priam* seekes; so proceede you. 
  Pol.:  - Foregod my Lord well spoken, with good accent and good  
 - discretion. 
  Play.:  - Anon he finds him, 
 - Striking too short at Greekes, his anticke sword 
 - Rebellious to his arme, lies where it fals, 
 - Repugnant to commaund; vnequall matcht, 
 - *Pirrhus* at *Priam* driues, in rage strikes wide, 
 - But with the whiffe and winde of his fell sword,  
 - Th'vnnerued father fals: 
 - Seeming to feele this blowe, with flaming top 
 - Stoopes to his base; and with a hiddious crash 
 - Takes prisoner *Pirrhus* eare, for loe his sword 
 - Which was declining on the milkie head 
 - Of reuerent *Priam*, seemd i'th ayre to stick, 
 - So as a painted tirant *Pirrhus* stood 
 - Like a newtrall to his will and matter,  
 - Did nothing: 
 - But as we often see against some storme, 
 - A silence in the heauens, the racke stand still, 
 - The bold winds speechlesse, and the orbe belowe 
 - As hush as death, anon the dreadfull thunder 
 - Doth rend the region, so after *Pirrhus* pause, 
 - A rowsed vengeance sets him new a worke, 
 - And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall, 
 - On *Marses* Armor forg'd for proofe eterne, 
 - With lesse remorse then *Pirrhus* bleeding sword  
 - Now falls on *Priam.*
  - Out, out, thou strumpet Fortune, all you gods, 
 - In generall sinod take away her power, 
 - Breake all the spokes, and follies from her wheele, 
 - And boule the round naue downe the hill of heauen  
 - As lowe as to the fiends. 
  Pol.:  - This is too long. 
  Ham.:  - It shall to the barbers with your beard: prethee say on, he's 
 - for a Iigge, or a tale of bawdry, or he sleepes, say on, come to *Hecuba.*
  Play.:  - But who, a woe, had seene the mobled Queene, 
  Ham.:  - The mobled Queene.  
  Pol.:  - Thats good. 
  Play.:  - Runne barefoote vp and downe, threatning the flames 
 - With *Bison* rheume, a clout vppon that head 
 - Where late the Diadem stood, and for a robe, 
 - About her lanck and all ore-teamed loynes, 
 - A blancket in the alarme of feare caught vp, 
 - Who this had seene, with tongue in venom steept, 
 - Gainst fortunes state would treason haue pronounst; 
 - But if the gods themselues did see her then, 
 - When she saw *Pirrhus* make malicious sport 
 - In mincing with his sword her husband limmes, 
 - The instant burst of clamor that she made, 
 - Vnlesse things mortall mooue them not at all, 
 - Would haue made milch the burning eyes of heauen  
 - And passion in the gods. 
  Pol.:  - Looke where he has not turnd his cullour, and has teares in's  
 - eyes, prethee no more. 
  Ham.:  - Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest of this soone, 
 - Good my lord will you see the players well bestowed; doe you 
 - heare, let them be well vsed, for they are the abstract and breefe 
 - Chronicles of the time; after your death you were better haue a 
 - bad Epitaph then their ill report while you liue. 
  Pol.:  - My Lord, I will vse them according to their desert. 
  Ham.:  - Gods bodkin man, much better, vse euery man after his de-sert, 
 - & who shall scape whipping, vse them after your owne honor 
 - and dignity, the lesse they deserue the more merrit is in your boun-ty. 
 - Take them in.  
  Pol.:  - Come sirs. 
  Ham.:  - Follow him friends, weele heare a play to morrowe, dost thou 
  - heare me old friend, can you play the murther of *Gonzago*?  
  Play.:  - I my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Weele hate to morrowe night, you could for neede study 
 - a speech of some dosen lines, or sixteene lines, which I would set 
 - downe and insert in't, could you not?  
  Play.:  - I my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Very well, followe that Lord, & looke you mock him not. 
 - My good friends, Ile leaue you tell night, you are welcome to *Elson*-*oure*. 
  *Exeunt Pol. and Players.* Ros.:  - Good my Lord. 
 *Exeunt.*  Ham.:  - I so God buy to you, now I am alone, 
 - O what a rogue and pesant slaue am I. 
 - Is it not monstrous that this player heere 
 - But in a fixion, in a dreame of passion 
 - Could force his soule so to his owne conceit 
 - That from her working all the visage wand, 
 - Teares in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, 
 - A broken voyce, and his whole function suting 
 - With formes to his conceit; and all for nothing, 
 - For *Hecuba.*  
 - What's *Hecuba* to him, or he to her, 
 - That he should weepe for her? what would he doe 
 - Had he the motiue, and that for passion 
 - That I haue? he would drowne the stage with teares, 
 - And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech, 
 - Make mad the guilty, and appale the free, 
 - Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeede 
 - The very faculties of eyes and eares; yet I, 
 - A dull and muddy metteld raskall peake, 
 - Like Iohn-a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause, 
 - And can say nothing; no not for a King, 
 - Vpon whose property and most deare life, 
 - A damn'd defeate was made: am I a coward, 
 - Who cals me villaine, breakes my pate a crosse, 
 - Pluckes off my beard, and blowes it in my face, 
 - Twekes me by the nose, giues me the lie i'th thraote 
 - As deepe as to the lunges, who does me this, 
 - Hah s'wounds I should take it: for it cannot be 
 - But I am pidgion liuerd, and lack gall 
  - To make oppression bitter, or ere this 
 - I should a  fatted all the region kytes 
 - With this slaues offall,  bloody, baudy villaine, 
 - Remorslesse, trecherous, lecherous, kindlesse villaine. 
 - Why what an Asse am I, this is most braue, 
 - That I the sonne of a deere murthered, 
 - Prompted to my reuenge by heauen and hell, 
 - Must like a whore vnpacke my hart with words, 
 - And fall a  cursing like a very drabbe; a stallyon,  fie vppont, foh. 
 - About my braines; hum, I haue heard, 
 - That guilty creatures sitting at a play, 
 - Haue by the very cunning of the scene, 
 - Beene strooke so to the soule, that presently 
 - They haue proclaim'd their malefactions: 
 - For murther, though it haue no tongue will speake 
 - With most miraculous organ: Ile haue these Players 
 - Play something like the murther of my father 
 - Before mine Vncle, Ile obserue his lookes, 
 - Ile tent him to the quicke, if a  doe blench 
 - I know my course. The spirit that I haue seene 
 - May be a deale, and the deale hath power 
 - T'assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhaps, 
 - Out of my weakenes, and my melancholy, 
 - As he is very potent with such spirits, 
 - Abuses me to damne me; Ile haue grounds 
 - More relatiue then this, the play's the thing 
 - Wherein Ile catch the conscience of the King. 
 *Exit.* *Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencraus, Guyl-densterne, Lords.*  King.:  - And can you by no drift of conference 
 - Get from him why he puts on this confusion, 
 - Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet  
 - With turbulent and dangerous lunacie? 
  Ros.:  - He dooes confesse he feeles himselfe distracted, 
 - But from what cause, a  will by no meanes speake. 
  Guyl.:  - Nor doe we find him forward to be sounded, 
 - But with a craftie madnes keepes aloofe 
 - When we would bring him on to some confession 
  - Of his true state. 
  Quee.:  - Did he receiue you well?  
  Ros.:  - Most like a gentleman. 
  Guyl.:  - But with much forcing of his disposition. 
  Ros.:  - Niggard of question, but of our demaunds  
 - Most free in his reply. 
  Quee.:  - Did you assay him to any pastime? 
  Ros.:  - Maddam, it so fell out that certaine Players 
 - We ore-raught on the way, of these we told him, 
 - And there did seeme in him a kind of ioy 
 - To heare of it: they are heere about the Court, 
 - And as I thinke, they haue already order  
 - This night to play before him. 
  Pol.:  - Tis most true, 
 - And he beseecht me to intreat your Maiesties  
 - To heare and see the matter. 
  King.:  - With all my hart,  
 - And it doth much content me 
 - To heare him so inclin'd. 
 - Good gentlemen giue him a further edge, 
 - And driue his purpose into these delights. 
  Ros.:  - We shall my Lord. 
 *Exeunt Ros. & Guyl.*  King.:  - Sweet *Gertrard*, leaue vs two, 
 - For we haue closely sent for *Hamlet* hether, 
 - That he as t'were by accedent, may heere  
 - Affront *Ophelia*; her father and my selfe, 
 - Wee'le so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene, 
 - We may of their encounter franckly iudge, 
 - And gather by him as he is behau'd, 
 - Ift be th'affliction  of his loue or no  
 - That thus he suffers for. 
  Quee.:  - I shall obey you. 
 - And for your part *Ophelia*, I doe wish  
 - That your good beauties be the happy cause 
 - Of *Hamlets* wildnes, so shall I hope your vertues, 
 - Will bring him to his wonted way againe,  
 - To both your honours. 
  Oph.:  - Maddam, I wish it may. 
  Pol.:  - *Ophelia* walke you heere, gracious so please you, 
  - We will bestow our selues; reade on this booke, 
 - That show of such an exercise may cullour 
 - Your lowlines; we are oft too  blame in this, 
 - Tis too much proou'd, that with deuotions visage 
 - And pious action, we doe sugar ore  
 - The deuill himselfe. 
  King.:  - O tis too true, 
 - How smart a lash that speech doth giue my conscience. 
 - The harlots cheeke beautied with plastring art, 
 - Is not more ougly to the thing that helps it, 
 - Then is my deede to my most painted word:  
 - O heauy burthen. 
 *Enter Hamlet.*  Pol.:  - I heare him comming, with-draw my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - To be, or not to be, that is the question, 
 - Whether tis nobler in the minde to suffer 
 - The slings and arrowes of outragious fortune, 
 - Or to take Armes against a sea of troubles, 
 - And by opposing, end them, to die to sleepe 
 - No more, and by a sleepe, to say we end 
 - The hart-ake, and the thousand naturall shocks 
 - That flesh is heire to; tis a consumation 
 - Deuoutly to be wisht to die to sleepe, 
 - To sleepe, perchance to dreame, I there's the rub, 
 - For in that sleepe of death what dreames may come 
 - When we haue shuffled off this mortall coyle 
 - Must giue vs pause, there's the respect  
 - That makes calamitie of so long life:  
 - For who would beare the whips and scornes of time, 
 - Th'oppressors wrong, the proude mans contumely, 
 - The pangs of despiz'd loue, the lawes delay, 
 - The insolence of office, and the spurnes  
 - That patient merrit of th'vnworthy takes, 
 - When he himselfe might his quietas make 
 - With a bare bodkin; who would fardels beare,  
 - To grunt and sweat vnder a wearie life, 
 - But that the dread of something after death, 
 - The vndiscouer'd country, from whose borne 
  - No trauiler returnes, puzzels the will, 
 - And makes vs rather beare those ills we haue, 
 - Then flie to others that we know not of. 
 - Thus conscience dooes make cowards, 
 - And thus the natiue hiew of resolution 
 - Is sickled ore with the pale cast of thought, 
 - And enterprises of great pitch and moment, 
 - With this regard theyr currents turne awry, 
 - And loose the name of action. Soft you now, 
 - The faire *Ophelia*, Nimph in thy orizons  
 - Be all my sinnes remembred. 
  Oph.:  - Good my Lord,  
 - How dooes your honour for this many a day? 
  Ham.:  - I humbly thanke you well. 
  Oph.:  - My Lord, I haue remembrances of yours 
 - That I haue longed long to redeliuer, 
 - I pray you now receiue them. 
  Ham.:  - No, not I, I neuer gaue you ought. 
  Oph.:  - My honor'd Lord, you know right well you did, 
 - And with them words of so sweet breath composd 
 - As made these things more rich, their perfume lost, 
 - Take these againe, for to the noble mind 
 - Rich gifts wax poore when giuers prooue vnkind,  
 - There my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Ha, ha, are you honest.  
  Oph.:  - My Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Are you faire?  
  Oph.:  - What meanes your Lordship? 
  Ham.:  - That if you be honest & faire, you should admit  
 - no discourse to your beautie. 
  Oph.:  - Could beauty my Lord haue better comerse  
 - Then with honestie? 
  Ham.:  - I truly, for the power of beautie will sooner transforme ho-nestie 
 - from what it is to a bawde, then the force of honestie can trans-late 
 - beautie into his likenes, this was sometime a paradox, but now the  
 - time giues it proofe, I did loue you once. 
  Oph.:  - Indeed my Lord you made me belieue so. 
  Ham.:  - You should not haue beleeu'd me, for vertue cannot so 
 - enoculat our old stock, but we shall relish of it, I loued you not. 
   Oph.:  - I was the more deceiued. 
  Ham.:  - Get thee a Nunry, why would'st thou be a breeder of sin-ners, 
 - I am my selfe indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse mee of 
 - such things, that it were better my Mother had not borne mee: I am 
 - very proude, reuengefull, ambitious, with more offences at my beck, 
 - then  I haue thoughts to put them in, imagination to giue them shape, 
 - or time to act them in: what should such fellowes as I do crauling be-tweene 
 - earth and heauen, wee are arrant knaues, beleeue none of vs, 
 - goe thy waies to a Nunry. Where's your father?  
  Oph.:  - At home my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Let the doores be shut vpon him, 
 - That he may play foole no where but in's owne house,  
 - Farewell. 
  Oph.:  - O helpe him you sweet heauens. 
  Ham.:  - If thou doost marry, Ile giue thee this plague for thy dow-rie, 
 - be thou as chast as yce, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape ca-lumny; 
 - get thee to a Nunry, farewell. Or if thou wilt needes marry, 
 - marry a foole, for wise men knowe well enough what monsters you 
 - make of them: to a Nunry goe, and quickly to, farewell. 
  Oph.:  - Heauenly powers restore him. 
  Ham.:  - I haue heard of your paintings well enough, God hath gi-uen 
 - you one face, and you make your selfes another, you gig & am-ble, 
 - and you list you nickname Gods creatures, and make your wan-tonnes 
 - ignorance; goe to, Ile no more on't, it hath made me madde, 
 - I say we will haue no mo marriage, those that are married alreadie, all 
 - but one shall liue, the rest shall keep as they are: to a Nunry go. 
  *Exit.* Oph.:  - O what a noble mind is heere orethrowne! 
 - The Courtiers, souldiers, schollers, eye, tongue, sword, 
 - Th'expectation, and Rose of the faire state, 
 - The glasse of fashion, and the mould of forme, 
 - Th'obseru'd of all obseruers, quite quite downe, 
 - And I of Ladies most deiect and wretched, 
 - That suckt the honny of his musickt vowes, 
 - Now see what noble and most soueraigne reason 
 - Like sweet bells iangled out of time, and harsh, 
 - That vnmatcht forme, and stature of blowne youth  
 - Blasted with extacie, o woe is mee 
 - T'haue seene what I haue seene, see what I see. 
  *Exit.*  *Enter King and Polonius.* King.:  - Loue, his affections doe not that way tend, 
 - Nor what he spake, though it lackt forme a little, 
 - Was not like madnes, there's something in his soule 
 - Ore which his melancholy sits on brood, 
 - And I doe doubt, the hatch and the disclose  
 - Will be some danger; which for to preuent, 
 - I haue in quick determination  
 - Thus set it downe: he shall with speede to *England*, 
 - For the demaund of our neglected tribute, 
 - Haply the seas, and countries different,  
 - With variable obiects, shall expell 
 - This something setled matter in his hart, 
 - Whereon his braines still beating  
 - Puts him thus from fashion of himselfe. 
 - What thinke you on't?  
  Pol.:  - It shall doe well. 
 - But yet doe I belieue the origin and comencement of his greefe, 
 - Sprung from neglected loue: How now *Ophelia*? 
 - You neede not tell vs what Lord *Hamlet* said, 
 - We heard it all: my Lord, doe as you please, 
 - But if you hold it fit, after the play, 
 - Let his Queene-mother all alone intreate him 
 - To show his griefe, let her be round with him, 
 - And Ile be plac'd (so please you) in the eare 
 - Of all their conference, if she find him not, 
 - To *England* send him: or confine him where  
 - Your wisedome best shall thinke. 
  King.:  - It shall be so,  
 - Madnes in great ones must not vnmatcht goe. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter Hamlet, and three of the Players.* Ham.:  - Speake the speech I pray you as I pronounc'd it to you, trip-pingly 
 - on the tongue, but if you mouth it as many of our players do, 
 - I had as liue the towne cryer spoke my lines, nor doe not saw the ayre 
 - too much with your hand thus, but vse all gently, for in the very tor-rent 
 - tempest, and as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must 
 - acquire and beget a temperance, that may giue it smoothnesse, o it 
 - offends mee to the soule, to heare a robustious perwig-pated fellowe 
  - tere a passion to totters, to very rags, to spleet the eares of the ground-lings, 
 - who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplica-ble, 
 - dumbe showes, and noyse: I would haue such a fellow whipt for 
 - ore-dooing Termagant, it out Herods Herod, pray you auoyde  it. 
  Player.:  - I warrant your honour. 
  Hamlet.:  - Be not too tame neither, but let your owne discretion be 
 - your tutor, sute the action to the word, the word to the action, with 
 - this speciall obseruance, that you ore-steppe not the modestie of na-ture: 
 - For any thing so ore-doone, is from the purpose of playing, 
 - whose end both at the first, and nowe, was and is, to holde as twere 
 - the Mirrour vp to nature, to shew vertue her feature; scorne her own 
 - Image, and the very age and body of the time his forme and pressure: 
 - Now this ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it makes the vnskil-full 
 - laugh, cannot but make the iudicious greeue, the censure of 
 - which one, must in your allowance ore-weigh a whole Theater of o-thers. 
 - O there be Players that I haue seene play, and heard others 
 - praysd, and that highly, not to speake it prophanely, that neither ha-uing 
 - th'accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan, nor 
 - man, haue so strutted & bellowed, that I haue thought some of Na-tures 
 - Iornimen had made men, and not made them well, they imita-ted 
 - humanitie so abhominably. 
  Player.:  - I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with vs. 
  Ham.:  - O reforme it altogether, and let those that play your clownes 
 - speake no more then is set downe for them, for there be of them that 
 - wil themselues  laugh, to set on some quantitie of barraine spectators 
 - to laugh to, though in the meane time, some necessary question of 
 - the play be then to be considered, that's villanous, and shewes a most 
 - pittifull ambition in the foole that vses it: goe make you readie. How 
 - now my Lord, will the King heare this peece of worke? 
  *Enter Polonius, Guyldensterne, & Rosencraus.* Pol.:  - And the Queene to, and that presently. 
  Ham.:  - Bid the Players make hast. Will you two help to hasten the[m]. 
  Ros.:  - I my Lord. 
  *Exeunt they two.* *Enter Horatio.* Ham.:  - What howe, *Horatio.*
  Hora.:  - Heere sweet Lord, at your seruice, 
  Ham.:  - *Horatio*, thou art een as iust a man  
 - As ere my conuersation copt withall. 
  Hor.:  - O my deere Lord. 
  - Nay, doe not thinke I flatter, 
 - For what aduancement may I hope from thee 
 - That no reuenew hast but thy good spirits 
 - To feede and clothe thee, why should the poore be flatterd? 
 - No, let the candied tongue licke  absurd pompe, 
 - And crooke the pregnant hindges of the knee 
 - Where thrift may follow fauning; doost thou heare, 
 - Since my deare soule was mistris of her choice, 
 - And could of men distinguish her election, 
 - S'hath seald thee for herselfe, for thou hast been 
 - As one in suffring all that suffers nothing, 
 - A man that Fortunes buffets and rewards 
 - Hast tane with equall thanks; and blest are those 
 - Whose blood and iudgement are so well comedled, 
 - That they are not a pype for Fortunes finger 
 - To sound what stop she please: giue me that man 
 - That is not passions slaue, and I will weare him 
 - In my hearts core, I in my hart of hart 
 - As I doe thee. Something too much of this, 
 - There is a play to night before the King, 
 - One scene of it comes neere the circumstance 
 - Which I haue told thee of my fathers death, 
 - I prethee when thou seest that act a foote, 
 - Euen with the very comment of thy soule 
 - Obserue my Vncle, if his occulted guilt 
 - Doe not it selfe vnkennill in one speech, 
 - It is a damned ghost that we haue seene, 
 - And my imaginations are as foule 
 - As *Vulcans* stithy; giue him heedfull note, 
 - For I mine eyes will riuet to his face, 
 - And after we will both our iudgements ioyne  
 - In censure of his seeming. 
  Hor.:  - Well my lord.  
 - If a steale ought the whilst this play is playing 
 - And scape detected, I will pay the theft. 
  *Enter Trumpets and Kettle Drummes, King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia.* Ham.:  - They are comming to the play. I must be idle, 
  - Get you a place. 
  King.:  - How fares our cosin *Hamlet*?  
  Ham.:  - Excellent yfaith, 
 - Of the Camelions dish, I eate the ayre, 
 - Promiscram'd, you cannot feede Capons so. 
  King.:  - I haue nothing with this aunswer *Hamlet*, 
 - These words are not mine.  
  Ham.:  - No, nor mine now my Lord. 
 - You playd once i'th Vniuersitie you say, 
  Pol.:  - That did I my Lord, and was accounted a good Actor, 
  Ham.:  - What did you enact? 
  Pol.:  - I did enact *Iulius Caesar*, I was kild i'th Capitall, 
 - *Brutus* kild mee.  
  Ham.:  - It was a brute part of him to kill so capitall a calfe there, 
 - Be the Players readie?  
  Ros.:  - I  my Lord, they stay vpon your patience. 
  Ger.:  - Come hether my deere *Hamlet*, sit by me. 
  Ham.:  - No good mother, heere's mettle more attractiue. 
  Pol.:  - O ho, doe you marke that. 
  Ham.:  - Lady shall I lie in your lap?  
  Ophe.:  - No my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Doe you thinke I meant country matters?  
  Oph.:  - I thinke nothing my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - That's a fayre thought to lye betweene maydes  legs.  
  Oph.:  - What is my Lord?  
  Ham.:  - Nothing. 
  Oph.:  - You are merry my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Who I?  
  Oph.:  - I my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - O God your onely Iigge-maker, what should a man do but 
 - be merry, for looke you how cheerefully my mother lookes, and my 
 - father died within's two howres. 
  Oph.:  - Nay, tis twice two months my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - So long, nay then let the deule weare blacke, for Ile haue a 
 - sute of sables; o heauens, die two months agoe, and not forgotten yet, 
 - then there's hope a great mans memorie may out-liue his life halfe a 
 - yeere, but ber Lady a must build Churches then, or els shall a suffer 
 - not thinking on, with the Hobby-horse, whose Epitaph is, for o, for 
 - o, the hobby-horse is forgot. 
   *The Trumpets sounds.  Dumbe show followes. Enter a King and a Queene, the Queene embracing him, and he her, he takes her vp, and declines his head vpon her necke, he lyes him downe vp-pon a bancke of flowers, she seeing him asleepe, leaues him: anon come in another man, takes off his crowne, kisses it, pours poyson in the sleepers eares, and leaues him: the Queene returnes, finds the King dead, makes passionate action, the poysner with some three or foure come in againe, seeme to con-dole with her, the dead body is carried away, the poysner wooes the Queene with gifts, shee seemes harsh awhile, but in the end accepts loue.* Oph.:  - What meanes this my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - Marry this munching *Mallico*, it meanes mischiefe. 
  Oph.:  - Belike this show imports the argument of the play. 
  Ham.:  - We shall know by this fellow, 
 *Enter Prologue.* - The Players cannot keepe, they'le tell all. 
  Oph.:  - Will a tell vs what this show meant? 
  Ham.:  - I, or any show that you will show him, be not you asham'd 
 - to show, heele not shame to tell you what it meanes. 
  Oph.:  - You are naught, you are naught, Ile mark the play. 
  Prologue.:  - For vs and for our Tragedie, 
 - Heere stooping to your clemencie,  
 - We begge your hearing patiently. 
  Ham.:  - Is this a Prologue, or the posie of a ring? 
  Oph.:  - Tis breefe my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - As womans loue. 
  *Enter King and Queene.* King.:  - Full thirtie times hath *Phebus* cart gone round  
 - *Neptunes* salt wash, and *Tellus* orb'd the ground, 
 - And thirtie dosen Moones with borrowed sheene 
 - About the world haue times twelue thirties beene 
 - Since loue our harts, and *Hymen* did our hands  
 - Vnite comutuall in most sacred bands. 
  Quee.:  - So many iourneyes may the Sunne and Moone 
 - Make vs againe count ore ere loue be doone, 
 - But woe is me, you are so sicke of late, 
 - So farre from cheere, and from our former state, 
 - That I distrust you, yet though I distrust, 
 - Discomfort you my Lord it nothing must. 
  - For women feare too much, euen as they loue, 
 - And womens feare and loue hold quantitie, 
 - Eyther none, in neither ought, or in extremitie, 
 - Now what my Lord is proofe hath made you know, 
 - And as my loue is ciz'd, my feare is so, 
 - Where loue is great, the litlest doubts are feare, 
 - Where little feares grow great, great loue growes there. 
  King.:  - Faith I must leaue thee loue, and shortly to, 
 - My operant powers their functions leaue to do, 
 - And thou shalt liue in this faire world behind, 
 - Honord, belou'd, and haply one as kind,  
 - For husband shalt thou, 
  Quee.:  - O confound the rest, 
 - Such loue must needes be treason in my brest, 
 - In second husband let me be accurst, 
 - None wed the second, but who kild the first. 
  Ham.:  - That's wormwood 
  Quee.:  - The instances that second marriage moue 
 - Are base respects of thrift, but none of loue, 
 - A second time I kill my husband dead, 
 - When second husband kisses me in bed. 
  King.:  - I doe belieue you thinke what now you speake, 
 - But what we doe determine, oft we breake, 
 - Purpose is but the slaue to memorie, 
 - Of violent birth, but poore validitie, 
 - Which now the fruite vnripe sticks on the tree, 
 - But fall vnshaken when they mellow bee. 
 - Most necessary tis that we forget  
 - To pay our selues what to our selues is debt, 
 - What to our selues in passion we propose, 
 - The passion ending, doth the purpose lose, 
 - The violence of eyther, griefe, or ioy, 
 - Their owne ennactures with themselues  destroy, 
 - Where ioy most reuels, griefe doth most lament, 
 - Greefe ioy, ioy griefes, on slender accedent, 
 - This world is not for aye, nor tis not strange, 
 - That euen our loues should with our fortunes change: 
 - For tis a question left vs yet to proue, 
 - Whether loue lead fortune, or els fortune loue. 
 - The great man downe, you marke his fauourite flyes, 
  - The poore aduaunc'd, makes friends of enemies, 
 - And hetherto doth loue on fortune tend, 
 - For who not needes, shall neuer lacke a friend, 
 - And who in want a hollow friend doth try,  
 - Directly seasons him his enemy. 
 - But orderly to end where I begunne, 
 - Our wills and fates doe so contrary runne, 
 - That our deuises still are ouerthrowne, 
 - Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne, 
 - So thinke thou wilt no second husband wed, 
 - But die thy thoughts when thy first Lord is dead. 
  Quee.:  - Nor earth to me giue foode, nor heauen light, 
 - Sport and repose lock from me day and night, 
 - To desperation turne my trust and hope, 
 - And Anchors cheere in prison be my scope, 
 - Each opposite that blancks the face of ioy, 
 - Meete what I would haue well, and it destroy, 
 - Both heere and hence pursue me lasting strife, 
  Ham.:  - If she should breake it now. 
  Quee.:  - If once I be a widdow, euer I be a wife. 
  King.:  - Tis deeply sworne, sweet leaue me heere a while, 
 - My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile  
 - The tedious day with sleepe. 
  Quee.:  - Sleepe rock thy braine, 
 - And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine. 
  *Exeunt.* Ham.:  - Madam, how like you this play? 
  Quee.:  - The Lady doth protest too much mee thinks. 
  Ham.:  - O but shee'le keepe her word. 
  King.:  - Haue you heard the argument? is there no offence in't? 
  Ham.:  - No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no offence i'th world. 
  King.:  - What doe you call the play? 
  Ham.:  - The Mousetrap, mary how tropically, this play is the Image 
 - of a murther doone in *Vienna*, *Gonzago* is the Dukes name, his wife 
 - *Baptista*, you shall see anon, tis a knauish peece of worke, but what of 
 - that? your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches vs not, 
 - let the gauled Iade winch, our withers are vnwrong.  This is one *Lu*-*cianus*, 
 - Nephew to the King. 
  *Enter Lucianus.* Oph.:  - You are as good as a Chorus my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I could interpret betweene you and your loue 
  - If I could see the puppets dallying. 
  Oph.:  - You are keene my lord, you are keene. 
  Ham.:  - It would cost you a groning to take off mine edge. 
  Oph.:  - Still better and worse. 
  Ham.:  - So you mistake your husbands.  Beginne murtherer, leaue 
 - thy damnable faces and begin, come, the croking Rauen doth bellow  
 - for reuenge. 
  Luc.:  - Thoughts black, hands apt, drugges fit, and time agreeing, 
 - Considerat season els no creature seeing, 
 - Thou mixture ranck, of midnight weedes collected, 
 - With *Hecats* ban thrice blasted, thrice inuected, 
 - Thy naturall magicke, and dire property,  
 - On wholsome life vsurps immediatly. 
  Ham.:  - A poysons him i'th Garden for his estate, his names *Gonza*-*go*, 
 - the story is extant, and written in very choice Italian, you shall see 
 - anon how the murtherer gets the loue of *Gonzagoes* wife. 
  Oph.:  - The King rises. 
  Quee.:  - How fares my Lord? 
  Pol.:  - Giue ore the play. 
  King.:  - Giue me some light, away. 
  Pol.:  - Lights, lights, lights. 
  *Exeunt all but Ham. & Horatio.* Ham.:  - Why let the strooken Deere goe weepe,  
 - The Hart vngauled play, 
 - For some must watch while some must sleepe, 
 - Thus runnes the world away. 
 - Would not this sir & a forrest of fea-thers, 
 - if the rest of my fortunes turne Turk with me, with prouinciall 
 - Roses on my raz'd shooes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players? 
  Hora.:  - Halfe a share.  
  Ham.:  - A whole one I. 
 - For thou doost know oh *Damon* deere  
 - This Realme dismantled was 
 - Of *Ioue* himselfe, and now raignes heere  
 - A very very paiock. 
  Hora.:  - You might haue rym'd. 
  Ham.:  - O good *Horatio*, Ile take the Ghosts word for a thousand  
 - pound. Did'st perceiue? 
  Hora.:  - Very well my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Vpon the talke of the poysning. 
  Hor.:  - I did very well note him. 
   Ham.:  - Ah ha, come some musique, come the Recorders, 
 - For if the King like not the Comedie,  
 - Why then belike he likes it not perdy. 
 - Come, some musique. 
  *Enter Rosencraus and Guyldensterne.* Guyl.:  - Good my Lord, voutsafe me a word with you.  
  Ham.:  - Sir a whole historie. 
  Guyl.:  - The King sir.  
  Ham.:  - I sir, what of him? 
  Guyl.:  - Is in his retirement meruilous distempred. 
  Ham.:  - With drinke sir?  
  Guyl.:  - No my Lord, with choller. 
  Ham.:  - Your wisedome should shewe it selfe more richer to signifie 
 - this to the Doctor, for, for mee to put him to his purgation, would 
 - perhaps plunge him into more choller. 
  Guyl.:  - Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame, 
 - And stare not so wildly from my affaire. 
  Ham.:  - I am tame sir, pronounce. 
  Guyl.:  - The Queene your mother in most great affliction of spirit,  
 - hath sent me to you. 
  Ham.:  - You are welcome. 
  Guyl.:  - Nay good my Lord, this curtesie is not of the right breede, if 
 - it shall please you to make me a wholsome aunswere, I will doe your 
 - mothers commaundement, if not, your pardon and my returne, shall  
 - be the end of busines. 
  Ham.:  - Sir I cannot.  
  Ros.:  - What my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Make you a wholsome  answer, my wits diseasd, but sir, such 
 - answere as I can make, you shall commaund, or rather as you say, my 
 - mother, therefore no more, but to the matter, my mother you say. 
  Ros.:  - Then thus she sayes, your behauiour hath strooke her into a-mazement 
 - and admiration. 
  Ham.:  - O wonderful sonne that can so stonish a mother, but is there 
 - no sequell at the heeles of this mothers admiration, impart. 
  Ros.:  - She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed. 
  Ham.:  - We shall obey, were she ten times our mother, haue you any  
 - further trade with vs? 
  Ros.:  - My Lord, you once did loue me. 
  Ham.:  - And doe still by these pickers and stealers. 
   Ros.:  - Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper, you do sure-ly*barre 
 - the doore vpon your owne liberty if you deny your griefes to  
 - your friend. 
  Ham.:  - Sir I lacke aduauncement. 
  Ros.:  - How can that be, when you haue the voyce of the King him-selfe 
 - for your succession in Denmarke. 
  *Enter the Players with Recorders.* Ham.:  - I sir, but while the grasse growes, the prouerbe is something 
 - musty, o the Recorders, let mee see one, to withdraw with you, why 
 - doe you goe about to recouer the wind of mee, as if you would driue  
 - me into a toyle? 
  Guyl.:  - O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my loue is too vnmanerly. 
  Ham.:  - I do not wel vnderstand that, wil you play vpon this pipe? 
  Guyl.:  - My lord I cannot.  
  Ham.:  - I pray you. 
  Guyl.:  - Beleeue me I cannot.  
  Ham.:  - I doe beseech you. 
  Guyl.:  - I know no touch of it my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - It is as easie as lying; gouerne these ventages with your fin-gers, 
 - & the vmber, giue it breath with your mouth, & it wil discourse 
 - most eloquent musique, looke you, these are the stops. 
  Guil.:  - But these cannot I commaund to any vttrance of harmonie, I  
 - haue not the skill. 
  Ham.:  - Why looke you now how vnwoorthy a thing you make of 
 - me, you would play vpon mee, you would seeme to know my stops, 
 - you would plucke out the hart of my mistery, you would sound mee 
 - from my lowest note to my compasse, and there is much musique ex-cellent 
 - voyce in this little organ, yet cannot you make it speak, s'bloud 
 - do you think I am easier to be plaid on then a pipe, call mee what in-strument*you 
 - wil, though you fret me not, you cannot play vpon me. 
 - God blesse you sir. 
  *Enter Polonius.* Pol.:  - My Lord, the Queene would speake with you, & presently. 
  Ham.:  - Do you see yonder clowd that's almost in shape of a Camel? 
  Pol.:  - By'th masse and tis, like a Camell indeed. 
  Ham.:  - Mee thinks it is like a Wezell. 
  Pol.:  - It is backt like a Wezell. 
  Ham.:  - Or like a Whale.  
  Pol.:  - Very like a Whale. 
   Ham.:  - Then I will come to my mother by and by, 
 - They foole me to the top of my bent, I will come by & by, 
 - Leaue me friends. 
 - I will, say so. By and by is easily said, 
 - Tis now the very witching time of night, 
 - When Churchyards yawne, and hell it selfe breakes out 
 - Contagion to this world: now could I drinke hote blood, 
 - And doe such busines as the bitter day 
 - Would quake to looke on: soft, now to my mother, 
 - O hart loose not thy nature, let not euer  
 - The soule of *Nero* enter this firme bosome, 
 - Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall, 
 - I will speake daggers to her, but vse none, 
 - My tongue and soule in this be hypocrites, 
 - How in my words someuer she be shent, 
 - To giue them seales neuer my soule consent. 
  *Exit.* *Enter King, Rosencraus, and Guyldensterne.* King.:  - I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs 
 - To let his madnes range, therefore prepare you, 
 - I your commission will forth-with dispatch, 
 - And he to *England* shall along with you, 
 - The termes of our estate may not endure 
 - Hazerd so neer's as doth hourely grow  
 - Out of his browes. 
  Guyl.:  - We will our selues prouide, 
 - Most holy and religious feare it is  
 - To keepe those many many bodies safe 
 - That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie, 
  Ros.:  - The single and peculier life is bound 
 - With all the strength and armour of the mind 
 - To keepe it selfe from noyance, but much more 
 - That spirit, vpon whose weale depends and rests 
 - The liues of many, the cesse of Maiestie 
 - Dies not alone; but like a gulfe doth draw 
 - What's neere it, with it, or it is a massie wheele 
 - Fixt on the somnet of the highest mount, 
 - To whose hough spokes, tenne thousand lesser things 
 - Are morteist and adioynd, which when it falls, 
  - Each small annexment petty consequence 
 - Attends the boystrous raine, neuer alone 
 - Did the King sigh, but a generall grone. 
  King.:  - Arme you I pray you to this speedy voiage, 
 - For we will fetters put about this feare 
 - Which now goes too free-footed. 
  Ros.:  - We will hast vs. 
  *Exeunt Gent.* *Enter Polonius.* Pol.:  - My Lord, hee's going to his mothers closet, 
 - Behind the Arras I'le conuay my selfe, 
 - To heare the processe, I'le warrant shee'le tax him home, 
 - And as you sayd, and wisely was it sayd, 
 - Tis meete that some more audience then a mother, 
 - Since nature makes them parciall, should ore-heare 
 - The speech of vantage; farre you well my Leige, 
 - I'le call vpon you ere you goe to bed, 
 - And tell you what I knowe. 
  *Exit.* King.:  - Thankes deere my Lord. 
 - O my offence is ranck, it smels to heauen, 
 - It hath the primall eldest curse vppont, 
 - A brothers murther, pray can I not, 
 - Though inclination be as sharp as will, 
 - My stronger guilt defeats my strong entent, 
 - And like a man to double bussines bound, 
 - I stand in pause where I shall first beginne, 
 - And both neglect, what if this cursed hand 
 - Were thicker then it selfe with brothers blood, 
 - Is there not raine enough in the sweete Heauens 
 - To wash it white as snowe, whereto  serues mercy  
 - But to confront the visage of offence? 
 - And what's in prayer but this two fold force, 
 - To be forestalled ere we come to fall, 
 - Or pardon being downe, then I'le looke vp. 
 - My fault is past, but oh what forme of prayer 
 - Can serue my turne, forgiue me my foule murther, 
 - That cannot be since I am still possest 
 - Of those effects for which I did the murther; 
 - My Crowne, mine owne ambition, and my Queene; 
  - May one be pardond and retaine th'offence? 
 - In the corrupted currents of this world, 
 - Offences guilded hand may showe by iustice, 
 - And oft tis seene the wicked prize it selfe 
 - Buyes out the lawe, but tis not so aboue, 
 - There is no shufling, there the action lies 
 - In his true nature, and we our selues compeld 
 - Euen to the teeth and forhead of our faults 
 - To giue in euidence, what then, what rests, 
 - Try what repentance can, what can it not, 
 - Yet what can it, when one cannot repent? 
 - O wretched state, o bosome blacke as death, 
 - O limed soule, that struggling to be free, 
 - Art more ingaged; helpe Angels make assay, 
 - Bowe stubborne knees, and hart with strings of steale, 
 - Be soft as sinnewes of the new borne babe,  
 - All may be well. 
  *Enter Hamlet.* Ham.:  - Now might I doe it, but now a is a praying, 
 - And now Ile doo't, and so a goes to heauen, 
 - And so am I reuendge, that would be scand 
 - A villaine kills my father, and for that, 
 - I his sole sonne, doe this same villaine send  
 - To heauen. 
 - Why, this is base and silly, not reuendge, 
 - A tooke my father grosly full of bread, 
 - Withall his crimes braod blowne, as flush as May, 
 - And how his audit stands who knowes saue heauen, 
 - But in our circumstance and course of thought, 
 - Tis heauy with him: and am I then reuendged 
 - To take him in the purging of his soule, 
 - When he is fit and seasond for his passage?  
 - No. 
 - Vp sword, and knowe thou a more horrid hent, 
 - When he is drunke, a sleepe, or in his rage, 
 - Or in th'incestious pleasure of his bed, 
 - At game a swearing, or about some act 
 - That has no relish of saluation in't, 
  - Then trip him that his heels may kick at heauen, 
 - And that his soule may be as damnd and black 
 - As hell whereto it goes; my mother staies, 
 - This phisick but prolongs thy sickly daies. 
  *Exit.* King.:  - My words fly vp, my thoughts remaine belowe 
 - Words without thoughts neuer to heauen goe. 
  *Exit.* *Enter Gertrard and Polonius.* Pol.:  - A will come strait, looke you lay home to him, 
 - Tell him his prancks haue beene too braod to beare with, 
 - And that your grace hath screend and stood betweene 
 - Much heate and him, Ile silence me euen heere, 
 - Pray you be round. 
  *Enter Hamlet.* Ger.:  - Ile wait you, feare me not, 
 - With-drawe, I heare him comming. 
  Ham.:  - Now mother, what's the matter? 
  Ger.:  - *Hamlet*, thou hast thy father much offended. 
  Ham.:  - Mother, you haue my father much offended. 
  Ger.:  - Come, come, you answere with an idle tongue. 
  Ham.:  - Goe, goe, you question with a wicked tongue. 
  Ger.:  - Why how now *Hamlet*?  
  Ham.:  - What's the matter now? 
  Ger.:  - Haue you forgot me?  
  Ham.:  - No by the rood not so, 
 - You are the Queene, your husbands brothers wife, 
 - And would it were not so, you are my mother. 
  Ger.:  - Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake. 
  Ham.:  - Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not boudge, 
 - You goe not till I set you vp a glasse 
 - Where you may see the most part of you. 
  Ger.:  - What wilt thou doe, thou wilt not murther me, 
 - Helpe how.  
  Pol.:  - What how helpe. 
  Ham.:  - How now, a Rat, dead for a Duckat, dead. 
  Pol.:  - O I am slaine. 
  Ger.:  - O me, what hast thou done? 
  Ham.:  - Nay I knowe not, is it the King? 
   Ger.:  - O what a rash and bloody deede is this. 
  Ham.:  - A bloody deede, almost as bad, good mother 
 - As kill a King, and marry with his brother. 
  Ger.:  - As kill a King.  
  Ham.:  - I  Lady, it was my word. 
 - Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farwell, 
 - I tooke thee for thy better, take thy fortune, 
 - Thou find'st to be too busie is some danger, 
 - Leaue wringing of your hands, peace sit you downe, 
 - And let me wring your hart, for so I shall  
 - If it be made of penitrable stuffe, 
 - If damned custome haue not brasd it so, 
 - That it be proofe and bulwark against sence. 
  Ger.:  - What haue I done, that thou dar'st wagge thy tongue  
 - In noise so rude against me? 
  Ham.:  - Such an act  
 - That blurres the grace and blush of modesty, 
 - Cals vertue hippocrit, takes of the Rose 
 - >From the faire forhead  of an innocent loue, 
 - And sets a blister there, makes marriage vowes 
 - As false as dicers oathes, o such a deede, 
 - As from the body of contraction plucks 
 - The very soule, and sweet religion makes 
 - A rapsedy of words; heauens face dooes glowe  
 - Ore this solidity and compound masse 
 - With heated visage, as against the doome  
 - Is thought sick at the act 
  Quee.:  - Ay me, what act? 
  Ham.:  - That roares so low'd, and thunders in the Index, 
 - Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this, 
 - The counterfeit presentment of two brothers, 
 - See what a grace was seated on this browe, 
 - *Hiperions* curles, the front of *Ioue* himselfe, 
 - An eye like *Mars*, to threaten and command, 
 - A station like the herald *Mercury*, 
 - New lighted on a heaue, a kissing hill, 
 - A combination, and a forme indeede, 
 - Where euery God did seeme to set his seale 
 - To giue the world assurance of a man, 
  - This was your husband, looke you now what followes, 
 - Heere is your husband like a mildewed eare, 
 - Blasting his wholsome brother, haue you eyes, 
 - Could you on this faire mountaine leaue to feede, 
 - And batten on this Moore; ha, haue you eyes? 
 - You cannot call it loue, for at your age 
 - The heyday in the blood is tame, it's humble, 
 - And waits vppon the iudgement, and what iudgement 
 - Would step from this to this, sence sure youe haue 
 - Els could you not haue motion, but sure that sence 
 - Is appoplext, for madnesse would not erre 
 - Nor sence to extacie was nere so thral'd 
 - But it reseru'd some quantity of choise 
 - To serue in such a difference, what deuill wast 
 - That thus hath cosund you at hodman blind; 
 - Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight, 
 - Eares without hands, or eyes, smelling sance all, 
 - Or but a sickly part of one true sence 
 - Could not so mope: o shame where is thy blush?  
 - Rebellious hell, 
 - If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones, 
 - To flaming youth let vertue be as wax 
 - And melt in her owne fire, proclaime no shame 
 - When the compulsiue ardure giues the charge, 
 - Since frost it selfe as actiuely doth burne,  
 - And reason pardons will. 
  Ger.:  - O *Hamlet* speake no more, 
 - Thou turnst my very eyes into my soule, 
 - And there I see such blacke and greeued spots 
 - As will leaue there their tin'ct. 
  Ham.:  - Nay but to liue  
 - In the ranck sweat of an inseemed bed 
 - Stewed in corruption, honying, and making loue  
 - Ouer the nasty stie. 
  Ger.:  - O speake to me no more, 
 - These words like daggers enter in my eares, 
 - No more sweete *Hamlet.*
  Ham.:  - A murtherer and a villaine,  
 - A slaue that is not twentith part the tyth  
  - Of your precedent Lord, a vice of Kings, 
 - A cut-purse of the Empire and the rule, 
 - That from a shelfe the precious Diadem stole 
 - And put it in his pocket.  
  Ger.:  - No more. 
  *Enter Ghost.* Ham.:  - A King of shreds and patches, 
 - Saue me and houer ore me with your wings 
 - You heauenly gards: what would your gracious figure? 
  Ger.:  - Alas hee's mad. 
  Ham.:  - Doe you not come your tardy sonne to chide, 
 - That lap'st in time and passion lets goe by 
 - Th'important acting of your dread command, o say. 
  Ghost.:  - Doe not forget, this visitation 
 - Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose, 
 - But looke, amazement on thy mother sits, 
 - O step betweene her, and her fighting soule, 
 - Conceit in weakest bodies strongest workes, 
 - Speake to her *Hamlet.*  
  Ham.:  - How is it with you Lady? 
  Ger.:  - Alas how i'st with you? 
 - That you doe bend your eye on vacancie, 
 - And with th'incorporall ayre doe hold discourse, 
 - Foorth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep, 
 - And as the sleeping souldiers in th'alarme, 
 - Your bedded haire like life in excrements 
 - Start vp and stand an end, o gentle sonne 
 - Vpon the heat and flame of thy distemper 
 - Sprinckle coole patience, whereon doe you looke? 
  Ham.:  - On him, on him, looke you how pale he glares, 
 - His forme and cause conioynd, preaching to stones 
 - Would make them capable, doe not looke vpon me, 
 - Least with this pittious action you conuert  
 - My stearne effects, then what I haue to doe 
 - Will want true cullour, teares perchance for blood. 
  Ger.:  - To whom doe you speake this?  
  Ham.:  - Doe you see nothing there? 
  Ger.:  - Nothing at all, yet all that is I see. 
  Ham.:  - Nor did you nothing heare?  
  Ger.:  - No nothing but our selues. 
   Ham.:  - Why looke you there, looke how it steales away, 
 - My father in his habit as he liued, 
 - Looke where he goes, euen now out at the portall. 
  *Exit Ghost.* Ger.:  - This is the very coynage of your braine, 
 - This bodilesse creation extacie is very cunning in. 
  Ham.:  - My pulse as yours doth temperatly keepe time, 
 - And makes as healthfull musicke, it is not madnesse 
 - That I haue vttred, bring me to the test, 
 - And the matter will reword, which madnesse 
 - Would gambole from, mother for loue of grace, 
 - Lay not that flattering vnction to your soule 
 - That not your trespasse but my madnesse speakes, 
 - It will but skin and filme the vlcerous place 
 - Whiles ranck corruption mining all within 
 - Infects vnseene, confesse your selfe to heauen, 
 - Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come, 
 - And doe not spread the compost on the weedes 
 - To make them rancker, forgiue me this my vertue, 
 - For in the fatnesse of these pursie times 
 - Vertue it selfe of vice must pardon beg, 
 - Yea curbe and wooe for leaue to doe him good. 
  Ger.:  - O *Hamlet* thou hast cleft my hart in twaine. 
  Ham.:  - O throwe away the worser part of it, 
 - And leaue the purer with the other halfe, 
 - Good night, but goe not to my Vncles bed, 
 - Assume a vertue if you haue it not, 
 - That monster custome, who all sence doth eate 
 - Of habits deuill, is angell yet in this 
 - That to the vse of actions faire and good, 
 - He likewise giues a frock or Liuery 
 - That aptly is put on to refraine night, 
 - And that shall lend a kind of easines 
 - To the next abstinence, the next more easie: 
 - For vse almost can change the stamp of nature, 
 - And either the deuill, or throwe him out 
 - With wonderous potency: once more good night, 
 - And when you are desirous to be blest, 
 - Ile blessing beg of you, for this same Lord 
 - I doe repent; but heauen hath pleasd it so 
  - To punish me with this, and this with me, 
 - That I must be their scourge and minister, 
 - I will bestowe him and will answere well 
 - The death I gaue him; so againe good night 
 - I must be cruell only to be kinde, 
 - This bad beginnes, and worse remaines behind. 
 - One word more good Lady. 
  Ger.:  - What shall I doe?  
  Ham.:  - Not this by no meanes that I bid you doe, 
 - Let the blowt King temp't you againe to bed, 
 - Pinch wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse, 
 - And let him for a paire of reechie kisses, 
 - Or padling in your necke with his damn'd fingers. 
 - Make you to rouell all this matter out 
 - That I essentially am not in madnesse, 
 - But mad in craft, t'were good you let him knowe, 
 - For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise, 
 - Would from a paddack, from a bat, a gib, 
 - Such deare concernings hide, who would doe so, 
 - No, in dispight of sence and secrecy,  
 - Vnpeg the basket on the houses top, 
 - Let the birds fly, and like the famous Ape, 
 - To try conclusions in the basket creepe, 
 - And breake your owne necke downe. 
  Ger.:  - Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath 
 - And breath of life, I haue no life to breath  
 - What thou hast sayd to me. 
  Ham.:  - I must to *England*, you knowe that. 
  Ger.:  - Alack I had forgot. Tis so concluded on. 
  Ham.:  - Ther's letters seald, and my two Schoolefellowes, 
 - Whom I will trust as I will Adders fang'd, 
 - They beare the mandat, they must sweep my way 
 - And marshall me to knauery: let it worke, 
 - For tis the sport to haue the enginer 
 - Hoist with his owne petar, an't shall goe hard 
 - But I will delue one yard belowe their mines, 
 - And blowe them at the Moone: o tis most sweete 
 - When in one line two crafts directly meete, 
  - This man shall set me packing, 
 - Ile lugge the guts into the neighbour roome; 
 - Mother good night indeed, this Counsayler 
 - Is now most still, most secret, and most graue, 
 - Who was in life a most foolish prating knaue. 
 - Come sir, to draw toward an end with you. 
 - Good night mother. 
  *Exit.* *Enter King, and Queene, with Rosencraus and Guyldensterne.* King.:  - Ther's matter in these sighes, these profound heaues, 
 - You must translate, tis fit we vnderstand them, 
 - Where is your sonne? 
  Ger.:  - Bestow this place on vs a little while. 
 - Ah mine owne Lord, what haue I seene to night? 
  King.:  - What *Gertrard*, how dooes *Hamlet*? 
  Ger.:  - Mad as the sea and wind when both contend 
 - Which is the mightier, in his lawlesse fit, 
 - Behind the Arras hearing some thing stirre, 
 - Whyps out his Rapier, cryes a Rat, a Rat, 
 - And in this brainish apprehension kills  
 - The vnseene good old man. 
  King.:  - O heauy deede!  
 - It had beene so with vs had wee been there, 
 - His libertie is full of threates to all, 
 - To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one, 
 - Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answer'd? 
 - It will be layd to vs, whose prouidence  
 - Should haue kept short, restraind, and out of haunt 
 - This mad young man; but so much was our loue, 
 - We would not vnderstand what was most fit, 
 - But like the owner of a foule disease 
 - To keepe it from divulging, let it feede 
 - Euen on the pith of life: where is he gone? 
  Ger.:  - To draw apart the body he hath kild, 
 - Ore whom, his very madnes like some ore  
 - Among a minerall of mettals base, 
 - Showes it selfe pure, a weepes for what is done. 
  King.:  - O *Gertrard*, come away, 
  - The sunne no sooner shall the mountaines touch, 
 - But we will ship him hence, and this vile deede 
 - We must with all our Maiestie and skill 
 *Enter Ros. & Guild.* - Both countenaunce and excuse. Ho *Guyldensterne*, 
 - Friends both, goe ioyne you with some further ayde, 
 - *Hamlet* in madnes hath *Polonius* slaine, 
 - And from his mothers closet hath he dreg'd him, 
 - Goe seeke him out, speake fayre, and bring the body 
 - Into the Chappell; I pray you hast  in this, 
 - Come *Gertrard*, wee'le call vp our wisest friends, 
 - And let them know both what we meane to doe 
 - And whats vntimely doone, 
 - Whose whisper ore the worlds dyameter, 
 - As leuell as the Cannon to his blanck, 
 - Transports his poysned shot, may misse our Name, 
 - And hit the woundlesse ayre, o come away, 
 - My soule is full of discord and dismay. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter Hamlet, Rosencraus, and others.* Ham.:  - Safely stowd, but soft, what noyse, who calls on *Hamlet*? 
 - O heere they come. 
  Ros.:  - What haue you doone my Lord with the dead body? 
  Ham.:  - Compound it with dust whereto tis kin. 
  Ros.:  - Tell vs where tis that we may take it thence,  
 - And beare it to the Chappell. 
  Ham.:  - Doe not beleeue it.  
  Ros.:  - Beleeue what. 
  Ham.:  - That I can keepe your counsaile & not mine owne, besides 
 - to be demaunded of a spunge, what replycation  should be made by  
 - the sonne of a King. 
  Ros.:  - Take you me for a spunge my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - I  sir, that sokes vp the Kings countenaunce, his rewards, his 
 - authorities, but such Officers doe the King best seruice in the end, he 
 - keepes them like an apple in the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be 
 - last swallowed, when hee needs what you haue gleand, it is but squee-sing 
 - you, and spunge you shall be dry againe. 
  Ros.:  - I vnderstand you not my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I am glad of it, a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare. 
  Ros.:  - My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is, and goe with vs  
 - to the King. 
   Ham.:  - The body is with the King, but the King is not with the  
 - body. The King is a thing. 
  Guyl.:  - A thing my Lord.  
  Ham.:  - Of nothing, bring me to him. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter King, and two or three.* King.:  - I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the body. 
 - How dangerous is it that this man goes loose, 
 - Yet must not we put the strong Law on him, 
 - Hee's lou'd of the distracted multitude, 
 - Who like not in their iudgement, but theyr eyes, 
 - And where tis so, th'offenders scourge is wayed 
 - But neuer the offence: to beare all smooth and euen, 
 - This suddaine  sending him away must seeme 
 - Deliberate pause, diseases desperat growne,  
 - By desperat applyance are relieu'd 
 - Or not at all.  
  *Enter Rosencraus and all the rest.* King.:  - How now, what hath befalne? 
  Ros.:  - Where the dead body is bestowd my Lord  
 - We cannot get from him. 
  King.:  - But where is hee?  
  Ros.:  - Without my lord, guarded to know your pleasure. 
  King.:  - Bring him before vs. 
  Ros.:  - How, bring in the Lord. 
  *They enter.* King.:  - Now *Hamlet*, where's *Polonius*?  
  Ham.:  - At supper. 
  King.:  - At supper, where.  
  Ham.:  - Not where he eates, but where a is eaten, a certaine conua-cation 
 - of politique wormes are een at him: your worme is your onely 
 - Emperour for dyet, we fat all creatures els to fat vs, and wee fat our 
 - selues for maggots, your fat King and your leane begger is but varia-ble 
 - seruice, two dishes but to one table, that's the end. 
  King.:  - Alas, alas. 
  Ham.:  - A man may fish with the worme that hath eate of a King, & 
 - eate of the fish that hath fedde of that worme. 
  King.:  - What doost thou meane by this? 
  Ham.:  - Nothing but to shew you how a King may goe a progresse 
 - through the guts of a begger. 
   King.:  - Where is *Polonius*?  
  Ham.:  - In heauen, send thether to see, if your messenger finde him 
 - not there, seeke him i'th other place your selfe, but if indeed you find 
 - him not within this month, you shall nose him as you goe vp the  
 - stayres into the Lobby. 
  King.:  - Goe seeke him there. 
  Ham.:  - A will stay till you come. 
  King.:  - *Hamlet* this deede for thine especiall safety 
 - Which we do tender, as we deerely grieue 
 - For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence. 
 - Therefore prepare thy selfe, 
 - The Barck is ready, and the wind at helpe, 
 - Th'associats tend, and euery thing is bent  
 - For *England.*
  Ham.:  - For *England.*  
  King.:  - I  *Hamlet.*
  Ham.:  - Good.  
  King.:  - So is it if thou knew'st our purposes. 
  Ham.:  - I see a Cherub that sees the[m],  but come for *England*, 
 - Farewell deere Mother.  
  King.:  - Thy louing Father *Hamlet.*
  Ham.:  - My mother, Father and Mother is man and wife, 
 - Man and wife is one flesh, so my mother: 
 - Come for *England.*
  *Exit.* King.:  - Follow him at foote, 
 - Tempt him with speede abord, 
 - Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night. 
 - Away, for euery thing is seald and done 
 - That els leanes on th'affayre,  pray you make hast, 
 - And *England*, if my loue thou hold'st at ought, 
 - As my great power thereof may giue thee sence, 
 - Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red, 
 - After the Danish sword, and thy free awe 
 - Payes homage to vs, thou mayst not coldly set 
 - Our soueraigne processe, which imports at full  
 - By Letters congruing to that effect 
 - The present death of *Hamlet*, doe it *England*, 
 - For like the Hectique in my blood he rages, 
  - And thou must cure me; till I know tis done, 
 - How ere my haps, my ioyes will nere begin. 
  *Exit.* *Enter Fortinbrasse with his Army ouer the stage.* Fortin.:  - Goe Captaine, from me greet the Danish King, 
 - Tell him, that by his lycence *Fortinbrasse*
 - Craues the conueyance  of a promisd march 
 - Ouer his kingdome, you know the randeuous, 
 - If that his Maiestie would ought with vs, 
 - We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,  
 - And let him know so. 
  Cap.:  - I will doo't my Lord.  
  For.:  - Goe softly on. 
  *Enter Hamlet, Rosencraus, &c.* Ham.:  - Good sir whose powers are these? 
  Cap.:  - They are of *Norway* sir. 
  Ham.:  - How purposd sir I pray you? 
  Cap.:  - Against some part of *Poland.*
  Ham.:  - Who commaunds them sir? 
  Cap.:  - The Nephew to old *Norway*, *Fortenbrasse*, 
  Ham.:  - Goes it against the maine of *Poland* sir,  
 - Or for some frontire? 
  Cap.:  - Truly to speake, and with no addition, 
 - We goe to gaine a little patch of ground 
 - That hath in it no profit but the name 
 - To pay fiue duckets, fiue I would not farme it; 
 - Nor will it yeeld to *Norway* or the *Pole*
 - A rancker rate, should it be sold in fee. 
  Ham.:  - Why then the *Pollacke* neuer will defend it. 
  Cap.:  - Yes, it is already garisond. 
  Ham.:  - Two thousand soules, & twenty thousand duckets 
 - Will not debate the question of this straw, 
 - This is th'Imposthume of much wealth and peace, 
 - That inward breakes, and showes no cause without 
 - Why the man dies. I humbly thanke you sir. 
  Cap.:  - God buy you sir. 
  Ros.:  - Wil't  please you goe my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - Ile be with you straight, goe a little before. 
 - How all occasions doe informe against me, 
  - And spur my dull reuenge. What is a man 
 - If his chiefe good and market of his time 
 - Be but to sleepe and feede, a beast, no more: 
 - Sure he that made vs with such large discourse 
 - Looking before and after, gaue vs not 
 - That capabilitie and god-like reason 
 - To fust in vs vnvsd, now whether it be 
 - Bestiall obliuion, or some crauen scruple 
 - Of thinking too precisely on th'euent, 
 - A thought which quarterd hath but one part wisedom, 
 - And euer three parts coward, I doe not know 
 - Why yet I liue to say this thing's to doe, 
 - Sith I haue cause, and will, and strength, and meanes 
 - To doo't; examples grosse as earth exhort me, 
 - Witnes this Army of such masse and charge, 
 - Led by a delicate and tender Prince, 
 - Whose spirit with diuine ambition puft, 
 - Makes mouthes at the invisible euent, 
 - Exposing what is mortall, and vnsure, 
 - To all that fortune, death, and danger dare, 
 - Euen for an Egge-shell. Rightly to be great, 
 - Is not to stirre without great argument, 
 - But greatly to find quarrell in a straw 
 - When honour's at the stake, how stand I then 
 - That haue a father kild, a mother staind, 
 - Excytements of my reason, and my blood, 
 - And let all sleepe, while to my shame I see 
 - The iminent death of twenty thousand men, 
 - That for a fantasie and tricke of fame 
 - Goe to their graues like beds, fight for a plot 
 - Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause, 
 - Which is not tombe enough and continent 
 - To hide the slaine, o from this time forth, 
 - My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth. 
  *Exit.* *Enter Horatio, Gertrard, and a Gentleman.* Quee.:  - I will not speake with her.  
  Gent.:  - Shee is importunat, 
 - Indeede distract, her moode will needes be pittied. 
   Quee.:  - What would she haue?  
  Gent.:  - She speakes much of her father, sayes she heares 
 - There's tricks i'th world, and hems, and beates her hart, 
 - Spurnes enuiously at strawes, speakes things in doubt 
 - That carry but halfe sence, her speech is nothing, 
 - Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue  
 - The hearers to collection, they yawne at it, 
 - And botch the words vp fit to theyr owne thoughts, 
 - Which as her wincks, and nods, and gestures yeeld them, 
 - Indeede would make one thinke there might be thought 
 - Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily. 
  Hora.:  - Twere good she were spoken with, for shee may strew 
 - Dangerous coniectures in ill breeding mindes, 
 - Let her come in. 
  *Enter Ophelia.* Quee.:  - To my sicke soule, as sinnes true nature is, 
 - Each toy seemes prologue to some great amisse, 
 - So full of artlesse iealousie is guilt, 
 - It spills it selfe, in fearing to be spylt. 
  Oph.:  - Where is the beautious Maiestie of Denmarke? 
  Quee.:  - How now *Ophelia*? 
  *shee sings.* Oph.:  - How should I your true loue know from another one, 
 - By his cockle hat and staffe, and his Sendall shoone. 
  Quee.:  - Alas sweet Lady, what imports this song? 
  Oph.:  - Say you, nay pray you marke, 
 - He is dead & gone Lady, he is dead and gone, 
 *Song.* - At his head a grasgreene turph, at his heeles a stone.  
 - O ho. 
  Quee.:  - Nay but *Ophelia.*
  Oph.:  - Pray you marke. White his shrowd as the mountaine snow. 
  *Enter King.* Quee.:  - Alas looke heere my Lord. 
  Oph.:  - Larded all with sweet flowers,

  King.:  - How doe you pretty Lady? 
  Oph.:  - Well good dild you, they say the Owle was a Bakers daugh-ter, 
 - Lord we know what we are, but know not what we may be. 
 - God be at your table. 
   King.:  - Conceit vpon her Father. 
  Oph.:  - Pray lets haue no words of this, but when they aske you  
 - what it meanes, say you this. 
 *Song.* - To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, 
 - All in the morning betime, 
 - And I a mayde at your window  
 - To be your Valentine.

 - Let in the maide, that out a maide, neuer departed more. 
  King.:  - Pretty *Ophelia.*
  Oph.:  - Indeede without an oath Ile make an end on't, 
 - By gis and by Saint Charitie,  
 - alack and fie for shame, 
 - Young men will doo't if they come too't,  
 - by Cock they are too blame. 
 - Quoth she, Before you tumbled me, you promisd me to wed, 
 - (He answers.) So would I a  done by yonder sunne  
 - And thou hadst not come to my bed. 
  King.:  - How long hath she beene thus? 
  Oph.:  - I hope all will be well, we must be patient, but I cannot chuse 
 - but weepe to thinke they would lay him i'th cold ground, my brother 
 - shall know of it, and so I thanke you for your good counsaile. Come 
 - my Coach, God night Ladies, god night,  
 - Sweet Ladyes god night, god night. 
  King.:  - Follow her close, giue her good watch I pray you. 
 - O this is the poyson of deepe griefe, it springs 
 - All from her Fathers death, and now behold, o *Gertrard, Gertrard*, 
 - When sorrows come, they come not single spyes, 
 - But in battalians: first her Father slaine, 
 - Next, your sonne gone, and he most violent Author 
 - Of his owne iust remoue, the people muddied 
 - Thick and vnwholsome in thoughts, and whispers 
 - For good *Polonius* death: and we haue done but greenly 
 - In hugger mugger to inter him: poore *Ophelia*
 - Deuided from herselfe, and her faire iudgement, 
 - Without the which we are pictures, or meere beasts, 
 - Last, and as much contayning as all these, 
 - Her brother is in secret come from Fraunce, 
 - Feeds on this wonder, keepes himselfe in clowdes, 
  - And wants not buzzers to infect his eare 
 - With pestilent speeches of his fathers death, 
 - Wherein necessity of matter beggerd,  
 - Will nothing stick our person to arraigne 
 - In eare and eare: o my deare *Gertrard*, this

 - Then young *Laertes* in a riotous head  
 - Ore-beares your Officers: the rabble call him Lord, 
 - And as the world were now but to beginne, 
 - Antiquity forgot, custome not knowne, 
 - The ratifiers and props of euery word, 
 - The cry choose we, *Laertes* shall be King, 
 - Caps, hands, and tongues applau'd it to the clouds, 
 - *Laertes* shall be King, *Laertes* King. 
  Quee.:  - How cheerefully on the false traile they cry. 
 *A noise witstagen.* - O this is counter you false Danish dogges.

 - Euen heere betweene the chast vnsmirched browe  
 - Of my true mother. 
  King.:  - What is the cause *Laertes*  
 - That thy rebellion lookes so gyant like? 
  - Let him goe *Gertrard*, doe not feare our person, 
 - There's such diuinitie doth hedge a King, 
 - That treason can but peepe to what it would, 
 - Act's little of his will, tell me *Laertes*
 - Why thou art thus incenst, let him goe *Gertrard.*  
 - Speake man. 
  Laer.:  - Where is my father?  
  King.:  - Dead. 
  Quee.:  - But not by him.  
  King.:  - Let him demaund his fill. 
  Laer.:  - How came he dead, I'le not be iugled with, 
 - To hell allegiance, vowes to the blackest deuill, 
 - Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit 
 - I dare damnation, to this poynt I stand, 
 - That both the worlds I giue to negligence, 
 - Let come what comes, onely I'le be reueng'd  
 - Most throughly for my father. 
  King.:  - Who shall stay you?  
  Laer.:  - My will, not all the worlds: 
 - And for my meanes I'le husband them so well, 
 - They shall goe farre with little. 
  King.:  - Good *Laertes*, if you desire to know the certainty 
 - Of your deere Father, i'st writ in your reuenge, 
 - That soopstake, you will draw both friend and foe  
 - Winner and looser. 
  Laer.:  - None but his enemies,  
  King.:  - Will you know them then? 
  Laer.:  - To his good friends thus wide I'le ope my armes, 
 - And like the kind life-rendring Pelican,  
 - Repast them with my blood. 
  King.:  - Why now you speake 
 - Like a good child, and a true Gentleman. 
 - That I am guiltlesse of your fathers death, 
 - And am most sencibly in griefe for it,

 - Should be as mortall as a poore mans life. 
  Oph.:  *Song.* - They bore him bare-faste on the Beere, 
 - And in his graue rain'd many a teare, 
 - Fare you well my Doue. 
  Laer.:  - Hadst thou thy wits, and did'st perswade reuenge  
 - It could not mooue thus. 
  Oph.:  - You must sing a downe a downe, 
 - And you call him a downe a. O how the wheele becomes it, 
 - It is the false Steward that stole his Maisters daughter. 
  Laer.:  - This nothing's more then matter.

 - God a mercy on his soule, and of all Christians soules, 
 - God buy you. 
  Laer.:  - Doe you this o God. 
  King.:  - *Laertes*, I must commune with your griefe,

  Gent.:  - Sea-faring men sir, they say they haue Letters for you. 
  Hor.:  - Let them come in.

 - I should be greeted. If not from Lord *Hamlet.*
  *Enter Saylers.* Say.:  - God blesse you sir. 
  Hora.:  - Let him blesse thee to. 
  Say.:  - A shall sir and please him, there's a Letter for you sir, it came

 - I am let to know it is. 
  Ham.:  - *Horatio*, when thou shalt haue ouer-lookt this, giue these fel-lowes 
 - some meanes to the King, they haue Letters for him: Ere wee 
 - were two daies old at Sea, at Pyrat of very warlike appointment gaue 
 - vs chase, finding our selues too slow of saile, wee put on a compelled 
 - valour, and in the grapple I boorded them, on the instant they got 
 - cleere of our shyp, so I alone became theyr prisoner, they haue dealt 
 - with me like thieues of mercie, but they knew what they did, I am to 
 - doe a turne for them, let the King haue the Letters I haue sent, and 
 - repayre thou to me with as much speede as thou wouldest flie death, 
 - I haue wordes to speake in thine eare will make thee dumbe, yet are 
  - they much too light for the bord of the matter, these good fellowes 
 - will bring thee where I am, *Rosencraus* and *Guyldensterne* hold theyr 
 - course for *England*, of them I haue much to tell thee, farewell. 
 - *So that thou knowest thine Hamlet.*
  Hor.:  - Come I will you way for these your letters, 
 - And doo't the speedier that you may direct me 
 - To him from whom you brought them. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter King and Laertes.* King.:  - Now must your conscience my acquittance seale, 
 - And you must put me in your hart for friend, 
 - Sith you haue heard and with a knowing eare, 
 - That he which hath your noble father slaine  
 - Pursued my life. 
  Laer.:  - It well appeares: but tell mee 
 - Why you proceede not against these feates  
 - So criminall and so capitall in nature, 
 - As by your safetie, greatnes, wisdome, all things els  
 - You mainely were stirr'd vp. 
  King.:  - O for two speciall reasons  
 - Which may to you perhaps seeme much vnsinnow'd, 
 - But yet to mee tha'r strong, the Queene his mother 
 - Liues almost by his lookes, and for my selfe, 
 - My vertue or my plague, be it eyther which, 
 - She is so concliue to my life and soule, 
 - That as the starre mooues not but in his sphere  
 - I could not but by her, the other motiue, 
 - Why to a publique count I might not goe, 
 - Is the great loue the generall gender beare him, 
 - Who dipping all his faults in theyr affection, 
 - Worke like the spring that turneth wood to stone, 
 - Conuert his Giues to graces, so that my arrowes 
 - Too slightly tymberd for so loued Arm'd, 
 - Would haue reuerted to my bowe againe, 
 - But not where I haue aym'd them. 
  Laer.:  - And so haue I a noble father lost, 
 - A sister driuen into desprat termes, 
 - Whose worth, if prayses may goe backe againe 
  - Stood challenger on mount of all the age 
 - For her perfections, but my reuenge will come. 
  King.:  - Breake not your sleepes for that, you must not thinke 
 - That we are made of stuffe so flat and dull, 
 - That we can let our beard be shooke with danger, 
 - And thinke it pastime, you shortly shall heare more, 
 - I loued your father, and we loue our selfe, 
 - And that I hope will teach you to imagine. 
  *Enter a Messenger with Letters.* Messen.:  - These to your Maiestie, this to the Queene. 
  King.:  - >From *Hamlet*, who brought them? 
  Mess.:  - Saylers my Lord they say, I saw them not, 
 - They were giuen me by *Claudio*, he receiued them  
 - Of him that brought them. 
  King.:  - *Laertes* you shall heare them: leaue vs. 
 - High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your kingdom, 
 - to morrow shall I begge leaue to see your kingly eyes, when I shal first 
 - asking you pardon, there-vnto recount the occasion of my suddaine  
 - returne. 
  King.:  - What should this meane, are all the rest come backe, 
 - Or is it some abuse, and no such thing? 
  Laer.:  - Know you the hand? 
  King.:  - Tis *Hamlets* caracter. Naked,  
 - And in a postscript heere he sayes alone,Can you deuise me?  
  Laer.:  - I am lost in it my Lord, but let him come, 
 - It warmes the very sicknes in my hart 
 - That I liue and tell him to his teeth  
 - Thus didst thou. 
  King.:  - If it be so *Laertes*,  
 - As how should it be so, how otherwise, 
 - Will you be rul'd by me?  
  Laer.:  - I  my Lord, so you will not ore-rule me to a peace. 
  King.:  - To thine owne peace, if he be now returned 
 - As the King at his voyage, and that he meanes 
 - No more to vndertake it, I will worke him 
 - To an exployt, now ripe in my deuise, 
 - Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall: 
  - And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe, 
 - But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practise, 
 - And call it accedent. 
  Laer.:  - My Lord I will be rul'd, 
 - The rather if you could deuise it so 
 - That I might be the organ. 
  King.:  - It falls right, 
 - You haue beene talkt of since your trauaile much, 
 - And that in *Hamlets* hearing, for a qualitie 
 - Wherein they say you shine, your summe of parts 
 - Did not together plucke such enuie from him 
 - As did that one, and that in my regard 
 - Of the vnworthiest siedge. 
  Laer.:  - What part is that my Lord? 
  King.:  - A very riband in the cap of youth, 
 - Yet needfull to, for youth no lesse becomes 
 - The light and carelesse liuery that it weares 
 - Then setled age, his sables, and his weedes 
 - Importing health and grauenes; two months since 
 - Heere was a gentleman of *Normandy*, 
 - I haue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French, 
 - And they can well on horsebacke, but this gallant 
 - Had witch-craft in't, he grew vnto his seate, 
 - And to such wondrous dooing brought his horse, 
 - As had he beene incorp'st, and demy natur'd 
 - With the braue beast, so farre he topt me thought, 
 - That I in forgerie of shapes and tricks  
 - Come short of what he did. 
  Laer.:  - A Norman wast?  
  King.:  - A Norman. 
  Laer.:  - Vppon my life *Lamord.*  
  King.:  - The very same. 
  Laer.:  - I know him well, he is the brooch indeed  
 - And Iem of all the Nation. 
  King.:  - He made confession of you,  
 - And gaue you such a masterly report 
 - For art and exercise in your defence,  
 - And for your Rapier most especiall, 
 - That he cride out t'would be a sight indeed 
  - If one could match you; the Scrimures of their nation 
 - He swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye, 
 - If you opposd them; sir this report of his 
 - Did *Hamlet* so enuenom with his enuy, 
 - That he could nothing doe but wish and beg 
 - Your sodaine comming ore to play with you. 
 - Now out of this.  
  Laer.:  - What out of this my Lord? 
  King.:  - *Laertes* was your father deare to you? 
 - Or are you like the painting of a sorrowe,  
 - A face without a hart? 
  Laer.:  - Why aske you this?  
  King.:  - Not that I thinke you did not loue your father, 
 - But that I knowe, loue is begunne by time, 
 - And that I see in passages of proofe, 
 - Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it, 
 - There liues within the very flame of loue 
 - A kind of weeke or snufe that will abate it, 
 - And nothing is at a like goodnes still, 
 - For goodnes growing to a plurisie, 
 - Dies in his owne too much, that we would doe 
 - We should doe when we would: for this would changes, 
 - And hath abatements and delayes as many, 
 - As there are tongues, are hands, are accedents, 
 - And then this should is like a spend thrifts sigh, 
 - That hurts by easing; but to the quick of th'vlcer, 
 - *Hamlet* comes back, what would you vndertake 
 - To showe your selfe indeede your fathers sonne  
 - More then in words? 
  Laer.:  - To cut his thraot i'th Church. 
  King.:  - No place indeede should murther sanctuarise, 
 - Reuendge should haue no bounds: but good *Laertes*
 - Will you doe this, keepe close within your chamber, 
 - *Hamlet* return'd, shall knowe you are come home, 
 - Weele put on those shall praise your excellence, 
 - And set a double varnish on the fame 
 - The french man gaue you, bring you in fine together 
 - And wager ore your heads; he being remisse, 
 - Most generous, and free from all contriuing, 
  - Will not peruse the foyles, so that with ease, 
 - Or with a little shuffling, you may choose 
 - A sword vnbated, and in a pace of practise  
 - Requite him for your Father. 
  Laer.:  - I will doo't,  
 - And for purpose, Ile annoynt my sword. 
 - I bought an vnction of a Mountibanck 
 - So mortall, that but dippe a knife in it, 
 - Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare, 
 - Collected from all simples that haue vertue 
 - Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death 
 - That is but scratcht withall,  Ile tutch my point 
 - With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly, it may be death. 
  King.:  - Lets further thinke of this. 
 - Wey what conuenience both of time and meanes 
 - May fit vs to our shape if this should fayle, 
 - And that our drift looke through our bad performance, 
 - Twere better not assayd, therefore this proiect, 
 - Should haue a back or second that might hold 
 - If this did blast in proofe; soft let me see, 
 - Wee'le make a solemne wager on your cunnings, 
 - I hate, when in your motion you are hote and dry, 
 - As make your bouts more violent to that end, 
 - And that he calls for drinke, Ile haue prepard him 
 - A Challice for the nonce, whereon but sipping, 
 - If he by chaunce escape your venom'd stuck, 
 - Our purpose may hold there; but stay, what noyse? 
  *Enter Queene.* Quee.:  - One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele, 
 - So fast they follow; your Sisters drownd *Laertes.*
  Laer.:  - Drown'd, o where?  
  Quee.:  - There is a Willow growes ascaunt the Brooke 
 - That showes his horry leaues in the glassy streame, 
 - Therewith fantastique garlands did she make 
 - Of Crowflowers, Nettles, Daises, and long Purples 
 - That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name, 
 - But our cull-cold maydes doe dead mens fingers call them. 
 - There on the pendant boughes her cronet weedes 
  - Clambring to hang, an enuious sliuer broke, 
 - When downe her weedy trophies and her selfe 
 - Fell in the weeping Brooke, her clothes spred wide, 
 - And Marmaide like awhile  they bore her vp, 
 - Which time she chaunted snatches of old laudes, 
 - As one incapable of her owne distresse, 
 - Or like a creature natiue and indewed  
 - Vnto that elament, but long it could not be 
 - Till that her garments heauy with theyr drinke, 
 - Puld the poore wretch from her melodious lay  
 - To muddy death. 
  Laer.:  - Alas, then she is drownd.  
  Quee.:  - Drownd, drownd. 
  Laer.:  - Too much of water hast thou poore *Ophelia*, 
 - And therefore I forbid my teares; but yet 
 - It is our tricke, nature her custome holds, 
 - Let shame say what it will, when these are gone, 
 - The woman will be out. Adiew my Lord, 
 - I haue a speech a fire that faine would blase, 
 - But that this folly drownes it. 
  *Exit.* King.:  - Let's follow *Gertrard*, 
 - How much I had to doe to calme his rage, 
 - Now feare I this will giue it start againe, 
 - Therefore lets follow. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter two Clownes.* Clowne.:  - Is shee to be buried in Christian buriall, when she wilfully  
 - seekes her owne saluation? 
  Other.:  - I tell thee she is, therfore make her graue straight, the crow-ner 
 - hath sate on her, and finds it Christian buriall. 
  Clowne.:  - How can that be, vnlesse she drown'd herselfe in her owne  
 - defence.  
  Other.:  - Why tis found so. 
  Clowne.:  - It must be so offended, it cannot be els, for heere lyes the 
 - poynt, if I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues an act, & an act hath 
 - three branches, it is to act, to doe, to performe, or all; she drownd her  
 - selfe wittingly. 
  Other.:  - Nay, but heare you good man deluer. 
  Clowne.:  - Giue mee leaue, here lyes the water, good, here stands the 
 - man, good, if the man goe to this water & drowne himselfe, it is will 
 - he, nill he, he goes, marke you that, but if the water come to him, & 
 - drowne him, he drownes not himselfe, argall, he that is not guilty of  
 - his owne death, shortens not his owne life. 
  Other.:  - But is this law?  
  Clowne.:  - I  marry i'st, Crowners quest law. 
  Other.:  - Will you ha the truth an't, if this had not beene a gentlewo-man, 
 - she should haue been buried out a christian buriall. 
  Clowne.:  - Why there thou sayst, and the more pitty that great folke 
 - should haue countnaunce in this world to drowne or hang the[m]selues, 
 - more then theyr euen Christen: Come my spade, there is no aunci-ent 
 - gentlemen but Gardners, Ditchers, and Grauemakers, they hold  
 - vp Adams profession, 
  Other.:  - Was he a gentleman?  
  Clowne.:  - A  was the first that euer bore Armes. 
 - Ile put another question to thee, if thou answerest me not to the pur-pose, 
 - confesse thy selfe.  
  Other.:  - Goe to. 
  Clow.:  - What is he that builds stronger then eyther the Mason, the  
 - Shypwright, or the Carpenter. 
  Other.:  - The gallowes maker, for that out-liues a thousand tenants. 
  Clowne.:  - I like thy wit well in good fayth, the gallowes dooes well, 
 - but howe dooes it well? It dooes well to those that do ill, nowe thou 
 - doost ill to say the gallowes is built stronger then the Church, argall, 
 - the gallowes may doo well to thee. Too't againe, come. 
  Other.:  - Who buildes stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright, or a  
 - Carpenter. 
  Clowne.:  - I,  tell me that and vnyoke. 
  Other.:  - Marry now I can tell.  
  Clowne.:  - Too't. 
  Other.:  - Masse I cannot tell. 
  Clow.:  - Cudgell thy braines no more about it, for your dull asse wil 
 - not mend his pace with beating, and when you are askt this question 
 - next, say a graue-maker, the houses hee makes lasts till Doomesday. 
 - Goe get thee in, and fetch mee a stoope of liquer. 
 - In youth when I did loue did loue, 
 *Song.* - Me thought it was very sweet 
 - To contract o the time for a my behoue, 
 - O me thought there a was nothing a meet. 
   *Enter Hamlet and Horatio.* Ham.:  - Has this fellowe no feeling of his busines? a  sings in graue-making. 
  Hora.:  - Custome hath made it in him a propertie of easines. 
  Ham.:  - Tis een so, the hand of little imploiment hath the daintier sence 
  Clow.:  *Song.* - But age with his stealing steppes 
 - hath clawed me in his clutch, 
 - And hath shipped me into the land,  
 - as if I had neuer been such. 
  Ham.:  - That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once, how the 
 - knaue iowles it to the ground, as if twere Caines iawbone, that did the 
 - first murder, this might be the pate of a pollitician, which this asse now 
 - ore-reaches; one that would circumuent God, might it not?  
  Hora.:  - It might my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Or of a Courtier, which could say good morrow sweet lord, 
 - how doost thou sweet lord? This might be my Lord such a one, that 
 - praised my lord such a ones horse when a went to beg it, might it not?  
  Hor.:  - I  my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Why een so, & now my Lady wormes Choples, & knockt 
 - about the massene with a Sextens spade; here's fine reuolution and 
 - we had the tricke to see't, did these bones cost no more the breeding, 
 - but to play at loggits with them: mine ake to thinke on't. 
  Clow.:  *Song.* - A pickax and a spade a spade, 
 - for and a shrowding sheet, 
 - O a pit of Clay for to be made  
 - for such a guest is meet. 
  Ham.:  - There's another, why may not that be the skull of a Lawyer, 
 - where be his quiddities now, his quillites, his cases, his tenurs, and his 
 - tricks? why dooes he suffer this madde knaue now to knocke him a-bout 
 - the sconce with a durtie shouell, and will not tell him of his acti-on 
 - of battery, hum, this fellowe might be in's time a great buyer of 
 - Land, with his Statuts, his recognisances, his fines, his double vou-chers, 
 - his recoueries, to haue his fine pate full of fine durt, will vou-chers 
 - vouch him no more of his purchases & doubles then the length 
 - and breadth of a payre of Indentures? The very conueyances of his 
 - Lands will scarcely lye in this box, & must th'inheritor himselfe haue  
 - no more, ha. 
  Hora.:  - Not a iot more my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Is not Parchment made of sheepe-skinnes? 
   Hora.:  - I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes to. 
  Ham.:  - They are Sheepe and Calues which seeke out assurance in 
 - that, I wil speak to this fellow. Whose graue's this sirra? 
  Clow.:  - Mine sir, or a pit of clay for to be made. 
  Ham.:  - I thinke it be thine indeede, for thou lyest in't. 
  Clow.:  - You lie out ont sir, and therefore tis not yours; for my part I  
 - doe not lie in't, yet it is mine. 
  Ham.:  - Thou doost lie in't to be in't & say it is thine, tis for the dead, 
 - not for the quicke, therefore thou lyest. 
  Clow.:  - Tis a quicke lye sir, twill away againe from me to you. 
  Ham.:  - What man doost thou digge it for?  
  Clow.:  - For no man sir. 
  Ham.:  - What woman then?  
  Clow.:  - For none neither. 
  Ham.:  - Who is to be buried in't? 
  Clow.:  - One that was a woman sir, but rest her soule shee's dead. 
  Ham.:  - How absolute the knaue is, we must speake by the card, or 
 - equiuocation will vndoo vs. By the Lord *Horatio*, this three yeeres I 
 - haue tooke note of it, the age is growne so picked, that the toe of the 
 - pesant coms so neere the heele of the Courtier he galls his kybe. How  
 - long hast thou been Graue-maker? 
  Clow.:  - Of the dayes i'th yere I came too't that day that our last king  
 - *Hamlet* ouercame *Fortenbrasse.*
  Ham.:  - How long is that since?  
  Clow.:  - Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that, it was that 
 - very day that young *Hamlet* was borne: hee that is mad and sent into *England.*
  Ham.:  - I  marry, why was he sent into *England*? 
  Clow.:  - Why because a was mad: a shall recouer his wits there, or if  
 - a doo not, tis no great matter there.  
  Ham.:  - Why? 
  Clow.:  - Twill not be seene in him there, there the men are as mad  
 - as hee. 
  Ham.:  - How came he mad?  
  Clow.:  - Very strangely they say. 
  Ham.:  - How strangely?  
  Clow.:  - Fayth eene with loosing his wits. 
  Ham.:  - Vpon what ground?  
  Clow.:  - Why heere in Denmarke: I haue been Sexten heere man  
 - and boy thirty yeeres. 
   Ham.:  - How long will a man lie i'th earth ere he rot? 
  Clow.:  - Fayth if a be not rotten before a die, as we haue many poc-kie 
 - corses, that will scarce hold the laying in, a will last you som eyght 
 - yeere, or nine yeere. A Tanner will last you nine yeere. 
  Ham.:  - Why he more then another? 
  Clow.:  - Why sir, his hide is so tand with his trade, that a will keepe 
 - out water a great while; & your water is a sore decayer of your whor-son 
 - dead body, heer's a scull now hath lyen you i'th earth 23. yeeres. 
  Ham.:  - Whose was it?  
  Clow.:  - A whorson mad fellowes it was, whose do you think it was? 
  Ham.:  - Nay I know not. 
  Clow.:  - A pestilence on him for a madde rogue, a pourd a flagon of 
 - Renish on my head once; this same skull sir, was sir *Yoricks* skull, the  
 - Kings Iester. 
  Ham.:  - This?  
  Clow.:  - Een that. 
  Ham.:  - Alas poore *Yoricke*, I knew him *Horatio*, a fellow of infinite 
 - iest, of most excellent fancie, hee hath bore me on his backe a thou-sand 
 - times, and now how abhorred in my imagination it is: my gorge 
 - rises at it. Heere hung those lyppes that I haue kist I know not howe 
 - oft, where be your gibes now? your gamboles, your songs, your fla-shes 
 - of merriment, that were wont to set the table on a roare, not one 
 - now to mocke your owne grinning, quite chopfalne. Now get you 
 - to my Ladies table, & tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this fa-uour 
 - she must come, make her laugh at that. 
 - Prethee *Horatio* tell me one thing.  
  Hora.:  - What's that my Lord? 
  Ham.:  - Doost thou thinke *Alexander* lookt a this fashion i'th earth? 
  Hora.:  - Een so. 
  Ham.:  - And smelt so pah.  
  Hora.:  - Een so my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - To what base vses wee may returne *Horatio*? Why may not 
 - imagination trace the noble dust of *Alexander*, till a find it stopping  
 - a bunghole? 
  Hor.:  - Twere to consider too curiously to consider so. 
  Ham.:  - No faith, not a iot, but to follow him thether with modesty 
 - enough, and likelyhood to leade it. *Alexander* dyed, *Alexander* was 
 - buried, *Alexander* returneth to dust, the dust is earth, of earth wee 
 - make Lome, & why of that Lome whereto  he was conuerted, might 
  - they not stoppe a Beare-barrell? 
 - Imperious *Caesar* dead, and turn'd to Clay, 
 - Might stoppe a hole, to keepe the wind away. 
 - O that that earth which kept the world in awe, 
 - Should patch a wall t'expell the waters flaw. 
 - But soft, but soft awhile, here come the King, 
 *Enter K[ing].  Q[ueene]. Laertes and the corse.* - The Queene, the Courtiers, who is this they follow? 
 - And with such maimed rites? this doth betoken, 
 - The corse they follow, did with desprat hand 
 - Foredoo it owne life, twas of some estate, 
 - Couch we a while and marke. 
  Laer.:  - What Ceremonie els? 
  Ham.:  - That is *Laertes* a very noble youth, marke. 
  Laer.:  - What Ceremonie els? 
  Doct.:  - Her obsequies haue been as farre inlarg'd 
 - As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull, 
 - And but that great commaund ore-swayes  the order, 
 - She should in ground vnsanctified been lodg'd  
 - Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers, 
 - Flints and peebles should be throwne on her: 
 - Yet heere she is allow'd her virgin Crants, 
 - Her mayden strewments, and the bringing home  
 - Of bell and buriall. 
  Laer.:  - Must there no more be doone?  
  Doct.:  - No more be doone. 
 - We should prophane the seruice of the dead, 
 - To sing a Requiem and such rest to her  
 - As to peace-parted soules. 
  Laer.:  - Lay her i'th earth, 
 - And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh 
 - May Violets spring: I tell thee churlish Priest, 
 - A ministring Angell shall my sister be  
 - When thou lyest howling. 
  Ham.:  - What, the faire *Ophelia.*
  Quee.:  - Sweets to the sweet, farewell, 
 - I hop't thou should'st haue been my *Hamlets* wife, 
 - I thought thy bride-bed to haue deckt sweet maide, 
 - And not haue strew'd thy graue. 
  Laer.:  - O treble woe 
  - Fall tenne times double on that cursed head, 
 - Whose wicked deede thy most ingenious sence 
 - Depriued thee of, hold off the earth a while, 
 - Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes; 
 - Now pile your dust vpon the quicke and dead, 
 - Till of this flat a mountaine you haue made 
 - To'retop old *Pelion*, or the skyesh head  
 - Of blew *Olympus.*
  Ham.:  - What is he whose griefe 
 - Beares such an emphesis, whose phrase of sorrow 
 - Coniures the wandring starres, and makes them stand 
 - Like wonder wounded hearers: this is I  
 - *Hamlet* the Dane. 
  Laer:  - The deuill take thy soule. 
  Ham.:  - Thou pray'st not well, 
 - I prethee take thy fingers from my throat, 
 - For though I am not spleenatiue rash, 
 - Yet haue I in me something dangerous, 
 - Which let thy wisedome feare; hold off thy hand, 
  King.:  - Pluck them a sunder. 
  Quee.:  - *Hamlet*, *Hamlet.*
  All.:  - Gentlemen. 
  Hora.:  - Good my Lord be quiet. 
  Ham.:  - Why, I will fight with him vpon this theame 
 - Vntil my eie-lids will no longer wagge. 
  Quee.:  - O my sonne, what theame? 
  Ham.:  - I loued *Ophelia*, forty thousand brothers  
 - Could not with all theyr quantitie of loue 
 - Make vp my summe. What wilt thou doo for her. 
  King.:  - O he is mad *Laertes.*
  Quee.:  - For loue of God forbeare him. 
  Ham.:  - S'wounds shew me what th'owt doe: 
 - Woo't weepe, woo't fight, woo't fast, woo't teare thy selfe, 
 - Woo't drinke vp Esill, eate a Crocadile? 
 - Ile doo't, doost come heere to whine? 
 - To out-face me with leaping in her graue, 
 - Be buried quicke with her, and so will I. 
 - And if thou prate of mountaines, let them throw  
 - Millions of Acres on vs, till our ground 
 - Sindging his pate against the burning Zone 
  - Make Ossa like a wart, nay and thou'lt mouthe,  
 - Ile rant as well as thou. 
  Quee.:  - This is meere madnesse, 
 - And thus a while the fit will worke on him, 
 - Anon as patient as the female Doue 
 - When that her golden cuplets are disclosed  
 - His silence will sit drooping. 
  Ham.:  - Heare you sir,  
 - What is the reason that you vse me thus? 
 - I lou'd you euer, but it is no matter, 
 - Let *Hercules* himselfe doe what he may 
 - The Cat will mew, and Dogge will haue his day. 
  *Exit Hamlet and Horatio.* King.:  - I pray thee good *Horatio* waite vpon him. 
 - Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech, 
 - Weele put the matter to the present push: 
 - Good *Gertrard* set some watch ouer your sonne, 
 - This graue shall haue a liuing monument, 
 - An houre of quiet thereby shall we see 
 - Tell then in patience our proceeding be. 
  *Exeunt.* *Enter Hamlet and Horatio.* Ham.:  - So much for this sir, now shall you see the other, 
 - You doe remember all the circumstance. 
  Hora.:  - Remember it my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Sir in my hart there was a kind of fighting 
 - That would not let me sleepe, me thought I lay 
 - Worse then the mutines in the bilbo, rashly, 
 - And praysd be rashnes for it: let vs knowe, 
 - Our indiscretion sometime serues vs well 
 - When our deepe plots doe fall, & that should learne vs 
 - Ther's a diuinity that shapes our ends,  
 - Rough hew them how we will. 
  Hora.:  - That is most certaine. 
  Ham.:  - Vp from my Cabin,  
 - My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke 
 - Gropt I to find out them, had my desire, 
 - Fingard their packet, and in fine with-drew 
 - To mine owne roome againe, making so bold 
  - My feares forgetting manners to vnfold  
 - Their graund commission; where I found *Horatio*
 - A royall knauery, an exact command  
 - Larded with many seuerall sorts of reasons, 
 - Importing Denmarkes health, and *Englands* to, 
 - With hoe such bugges and goblines in my life, 
 - That on the superuise no leasure bated, 
 - No not to stay the grinding of the Axe, 
 - My head should be strooke off. 
  Hora.:  - I'st possible?  
  Ham.:  - Heeres the commission, read it at more leasure, 
 - But wilt thou heare now how I did proceed.  
  Hora.:  - I beseech you. 
  Ham.:  - Being thus benetted round with villaines, 
 - Or I could make a prologue to my braines, 
 - They had begunne the play, I sat me downe, 
 - Deuisd a new commission, wrote it faire, 
 - I once did hold it as our statists doe, 
 - A basenesse to write faire, and labourd much 
 - How to forget that learning, but sir now 
 - It did me yemans seruice, wilt thou know  
 - Th'effect of what I wrote? 
  Hora.:  - I  good my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - An earnest coniuration from the King, 
 - As *England* was his faithfull tributary, 
 - As loue betweene them like the palme might florish, 
 - As peace should still her wheaten garland weare 
 - And stand a Comma tweene their amities, 
 - And many such like, as sir of great charge, 
 - That on the view, and knowing of these contents, 
 - Without debatement further more or lesse, 
 - He should those bearers put to suddaine death,  
 - Not shriuing time alow'd. 
  Hora.:  - How was this seald? 
  Ham.:  - Why euen in that was heauen ordinant, 
 - I had my fathers signet in my purse 
 - Which was the modill of that Danish seale, 
 - Folded the writ vp in the forme of th'other, 
 - Subcribe it, gau't th'impression, plac'd it safely, 
  - The changling neuer knowne: now the next day 
 - Was our Sea fight, and what to this was sequent  
 - Thou knowest already. 
  Hora.:  - So *Guyldensterne* and *Rosencraus* goe too't. 
  Ham.:  - They are not neere my conscience, their defeat 
 - Dooes by their owne insinnuation growe, 
 - Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes 
 - Betweene the passe and fell incenced points  
 - Of mighty opposits. 
  Hora.:  - Why what a King is this!? 
  Ham.:  - Dooes it not thinke thee stand me now vppon? 
 - He that hath kild my King, and whor'd my mother, 
 - Pop't in betweene th'election and my hopes, 
 - Throwne out his Angle for my proper life, 
 - And with such cusnage, i'st not perfect conscience? 
  *Enter a Courtier.* Cour.:  - Your Lordship is right welcome backe to Denmarke. 
  Ham.:  - I humble thanke you sir.  
 - Doost know this water fly? 
  Hora.:  - No my good Lord. 
  Ham.:  - Thy state is the more gracious, for tis a vice to know him, 
 - He hath much land and fertill: let a beast be Lord of beasts, and his 
 - crib shall stand at the Kings messe, tis a chough, but as I say, spaci-ous 
 - in the possession of durt. 
  Cour.:  - Sweete Lord, if your Lordshippe were at leasure, I should  
 - impart a thing to you from his Maiestie. 
  Ham.:  - I will receaue it sir withall dilligence of spirit,  your bonnet  
 - to his right vse, tis for the head. 
  Cour.:  - I thanke your Lordship, it is very hot. 
  Ham.:  - No belieue me, tis very cold, the wind is Northerly. 
  Cour.:  - It is indefferent cold my Lord indeed. 
  Ham.:  - But yet me thinkes it is very sully and hot, or my complec-tion. 
  Cour.:  - Exceedingly my Lord, it is very soultery, as t'were I can-not 
 - tell how: my Lord his Maiestie bad me signifie to you, that a 
 - has layed a great wager on your head, sir this is the matter. 
  Ham.:  - I beseech you remember. 
  Cour.:  - Nay good my Lord for my ease in good faith, sir here is newly 
 - com to Court *Laertes*, belieue me an absolute gentlemen, ful of most 
  - excellent differences, of very soft society, and great showing: in-deede to 
 - speake fellingly of him, hee is the card or kalender of gen-try: 
 - for you shall find in him the continent of what part a Gentle-man 
 - would see. 
  Ham.:  - Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you, though I 
 - know to deuide him inuentorially, would dazzle th'arithmaticke of 
 - memory, and yet but raw neither, in respect of his quick saile, but 
 - in the veritie of extolment, I take him to be a soule of great article, 
 - & his infusion of such dearth and rarenesse, as to make true dixion 
 - of him, his semblable is his mirrour, & who els would trace him, his  
 - vmbrage, nothing more. 
  Cour.:  - Your Lordship speakes most infallibly of him. 
  Ham.:  - The concernancy sir, why doe we wrap the gentleman in  
 - our more rawer breath?  
  Cour.:  - Sir. 
  Hora.:  - Ist not possible to vnderstand in another tongue, you will  
 - doo't sir really. 
  Ham.:  - What imports the nomination of this gentleman.  
  Cour.:  - Of *Laertes.*
  Hora.:  - His purse is empty already, all's golden words are spent.  
  Ham.:  - Of him sir. 
  Cour.:  - I know you are not ignorant. 
  Ham.:  - I would you did sir, yet in faith if you did, it would not  
 - much approoue me, well sir. 
  Cour.:  - You are not ignorant of what excellence *Laertes* is. 
  Ham.:  - I dare not confesse that, least I should compare with 
 - him in excellence, but to know a man wel, were to knowe himselfe. 
  Cour.:  - I meane sir for this weapon, but in the imputation laide on 
 - him, by them in his meed, hee's vnfellowed. 
  Ham.:  - What's his weapon?  
  Cour.:  - Rapier and Dagger. 
  Ham.:  - That's two of his weapons, but well. 
  Cour.:  - The King sir hath wagerd with him six Barbary horses, 
 - against the which hee has impaund as I take it six French Rapiers 
 - and Poynards, with their assignes, as girdle, hanger and so. Three 
 - of the carriages in faith, are very deare to fancy, very responsiue to 
 - the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberall conceit. 
  Ham.:  - What call you the carriages? 
  Hora.:  - I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had  
 - done. 
   Cour.:  - The carriage sir are the hangers. 
  Ham.:  - The phrase would bee more Ierman to the matter if wee 
 - could carry a cannon by our sides, I would it might be hangers till 
 - then, but on, six Barbry horses against six French swords their as-signes, 
 - and three liberall conceited carriages, that's the French  
 - bet against the Danish, why is this all you call it? 
  Cour.:  - The King sir, hath layd sir, that in a dozen passes betweene 
 - your selfe and him, hee shall not exceede you three hits, hee hath 
 - layd on twelue for nine, and it would come to immediate triall, if  
 - your Lordshippe would vouchsafe the answere. 
  Ham.:  - How if I answere no? 
  Cour.:  - I meane my Lord the opposition of your person in triall. 
  Ham.:  - Sir I will walke heere in the hall, if it please his Maiestie, it 
 - is the breathing time of day with me, let the foiles be brought, the 
 - Gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose; I will winne 
 - for him and I can, if not, I will gaine nothing but my shame, and  
 - the odde hits. 
  Cour.:  - Shall I deliuer you so? 
  Ham.:  - To this effect sir, after what florish your nature will. 
  Cour.:  - I commend my duty to your Lordshippe. 
  Ham.:  - Yours doo's well to commend it himselfe, there are no  
 - tongues els for's turne. 
  Hora.:  - This Lapwing runnes away with the shell on his head. 
  Ham.:  - A did so sir with his dugge before a suckt it, thus has he and 
 - many more of the same breede that I know the drossy age dotes on, 
 - only got the tune of the time, and out of an habit of incounter, a 
 - kind of histy colection, which carries them through and through 
 - the most prophane and trennowed opinions, and doe but blowe  
 - them to their triall, the bubbles are out. 
  *Enter a Lord.* Lord.:  - My Lord, his Maiestie commended him to you by young 
 - *Ostricke*, who brings backe to him that you attend him in the hall, 
 - he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with *Laertes*, or that  
 - you will take longer time? 
  Ham.:  - I am constant to my purposes, they followe the Kings plea-sure, 
 - if his fitnes speakes, mine is ready: now or whensoeuer, pro-uided 
 - I be so able as now. 
   Lord.:  - The King, and Queene, and all are comming downe.  
  Ham.:  - In happy time. 
  Lord.:  - The Queene desires you to vse some gentle entertainment 
 - to *Laertes*, before you fall to play. 
  Ham.:  - Shee well instructs me. 
  Hora.:  - You will loose my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - I doe not thinke so, since he went into France, I haue bene 
 - in continuall practise, I shall winne at the ods; thou would'st not 
 - thinke how ill all's heere about my hart, but it is no matter.  
  Hora.:  - Nay good my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - It is but foolery, but it is such a kinde of gaingiuing, as  
 - would perhapes trouble a woman. 
  Hora.:  - If your minde dislike any thing, obay it. I will forstal their  
 - repaire hether, and say you are not fit. 
  Ham.:  - Not a whit, we defie augury, there is speciall prouidence in 
 - the fall of a Sparrowe, if it be, tis not to come, if it be not to come, 
 - it will be now, if it be not now, yet it well come, the readines is all, 
 - since no man of ought he leaues, knowes what ist to leaue betimes,  
 - let be. 
  *A table prepard, Trumpets, Drums and officers with Cushions, King, Queene, and all the state, Foiles, daggers, and Laertes.* King.:  - Come *Hamlet*, come and take this hand from me. 
  Ham.:  - Giue me your pardon sir, I haue done you wrong, 
 - But pardon't as you are a gentleman, this presence knowes, 
 - And you must needs haue heard, how I am punnisht  
 - With a sore distraction, what I haue done 
 - That might your nature, honor, and exception 
 - Roughly awake, I heare proclame was madnesse, 
 - Wast *Hamlet* wronged *Laertes*?  neuer *Hamlet.*
 - If *Hamlet* from himselfe be tane away, 
 - And when hee's not himselfe, dooes wrong *Laertes*, 
 - Then *Hamlet* dooes it not, *Hamlet* denies it, 
 - Who dooes it then? his madnesse. Ift be so, 
 - *Hamlet* is of the faction that is wronged, 
 - His madnesse is poore *Hamlets* enimie, 
 - Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill, 
 - Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts 
 - That I haue shot my arrowe ore the house 
  - And hurt my brother. 
  Laer.:  - I am satisfied in nature, 
 - Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most 
 - To my reuendge, but in my tearmes of honor 
 - I stand a loofe, and will no reconcilement, 
 - Till by some elder Maisters of knowne honor 
 - I haue a voyce and president of peace  
 - To my name vngord: but all that time 
 - I doe receaue your offerd loue, like loue,  
 - And will not wrong it. 
  Ham.:  - I embrace it freely, and will this brothers wager  
 - Franckly play. Giue vs the foiles.  
  Laer.:  - Come, one for me. 
  Ham.:  - Ile be your foile *Laertes*, in mine ignorance 
 - Your skill shall like a starre i'th darkest night  
 - Stick fiery of indeed. 
  Laer.:  - You mocke me sir.  
  Ham.:  - No by this hand. 
  King.:  - Giue them the foiles young *Ostricke*, cosin *Hamlet*, 
 - You knowe the wager.  
  Ham.:  - Very well my Lord. 
 - Your grace has layed the ods a'th weeker side. 
  King.:  - I doe not feare it, I haue seene you both, 
 - But since he is better, we haue therefore ods. 
  Laer.:  - This is to heauy: let me see another. 
  Ham.:  - This likes me well, these foiles haue all a length. 
  Ostr.:  - I  my good Lord. 
  King.:  - Set me the stoopes of wine vpon that table, 
 - If *Hamlet* giue the first or second hit, 
 - Or quit in answere of the third exchange, 
 - Let all the battlements their ordnance fire. 
 - The King shall drinke to *Hamlets* better breath, 
 - And in the cup an Onixe shall he throwe, 
 - Richer then that which foure successiue Kings 
 - In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne: giue me the cups, 
 - And let the kettle to the trumpet speake, 
 - The trumpet to the Cannoneere without, 
 - The Cannons to the heauens, the heauen to earth, 
  - Now the King drinkes to *Hamlet*, come beginne. 
 - And you the Iudges beare a wary eye. 
  *Trumpets the while.* Ham.:  - Come on sir.  
  Laer.:  - Come my Lord. 
  Ham.:  - One.  
  Laer.:  - No. 
  Ham.:  - Iudgement.  
  Ostrick.:  - A hit, a very palpable hit. 
  *Drum, trumpets and shot. Florish, a peece goes off.* Laer.:  - Well, againe. 
  King.:  - Stay, giue me drinke, *Hamlet* this pearle is thine. 
 - Heeres to thy health: giue him the cup. 
  Ham.:  - Ile play this bout first, set it by a while 
 - Come, another hit. What say you?  
  Laer.:  - I doe confest. 
  King.:  - Our sonne shall winne, 
  Quee.:  - Hee's fat and scant of breath. 
 - Heere *Hamlet* take my napkin rub thy browes, 
 - The Queene carowses to thy fortune *Hamlet.*
  Ham.:  - Good Madam.  
  King.:  - *Gertrard* doe not drinke. 
  Quee.:  - I will my Lord, I pray you pardon me. 
  King.:  - It is the poysned cup, it is too late. 
  Ham.:  - I dare not drinke yet Madam, by and by. 
  Quee.:  - Come, let me wipe thy face. 
  Laer.:  - My Lord, Ile hit him now.  
  King.:  - I doe not think't. 
  Laer.:  - And yet it is almost against my conscience. 
  Ham.:  - Come for the third *Laertes*, you doe but dally. 
 - I pray you passe with your best violence 
 - I am sure you make a wanton  of me.  
  Laer.:  - Say you so, come on. 
  Ostr.:  - Nothing neither way. 
  Laer.:  - Haue at you now. 
  King.:  - Part them, they are incenst.  
  Ham.:  - Nay come againe. 
  Ostr.:  - Looke to the Queene there howe. 
  Hora.:  - They bleed on both sides, how is it my Lord? 
  Ostr.:  - How ist *Laertes*? 
  Laer.:  - Why as a woodcock to mine owne sprindge *Ostrick*, 
  - I am iustly kild with mine owne treachery. 
  Ham.:  - How dooes the Queene? 
  King.:  - Shee sounds to see them bleed. 
  Quee.:  - No, no, the drinke, the drinke, o my deare *Hamlet*, 
 - The drinke the drinke, I am poysned. 
  Ham.:  - O villanie, how let the doore be lock't, 
 - Treachery, seeke it out. 
  Laer.:  - It is heere *Hamlet*, thou art slaine, 
 - No medcin in the world can doe thee good, 
 - In thee there is not halfe an houres life, 
 - The treacherous instrument is in my hand 
 - Vnbated and enuenom'd, the foule practise 
 - Hath turn'd it selfe on me, loe heere I lie 
 - Neuer to rise againe, thy mother's poysned, 
 - I can no more, the King, the Kings too blame. 
  Ham.:  - The point inuenom'd to, then venome to thy worke. 
  All.:  - Treason, treason. 
  King.:  - O yet defend me friends, I am but hurt. 
  Ham.:  - Heare thou incestious damned Dane, 
 - Drinke of this potion, is the Onixe heere? 
 - Follow my mother. 
  Laer.:  - He is iustly serued, it is a poyson temperd by himselfe, 
 - Exchange forgiuenesse with me noble *Hamlet*, 
 - Mine and my fathers death come not vppon thee,  
 - Nor thine on me. 
  Ham.:  - Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee; 
 - I am dead *Horatio*, wretched Queene adiew. 
 - You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance, 
 - That are but mutes, or audience to this act, 
 - Had I but time, as this fell sergeant Death 
 - Is strict in his arrest, o I could tell you, 
 - But let it be; *Horatio* I am dead, 
 - Thou liuest, report me and my cause a right  
 - To the vnsatisfied. 
  Hora.:  - Neuer belieue it; 
 - I am more an anticke Romaine then a Dane, 
 - Heere's yet some liquer left. 
  Ham.:  - As th'art a man 
 - Giue me the cup, let goe, by heauen Ile hate, 
  - O god *Horatio*, what a wounded name 
 - Things standing thus vnknowne, shall I leaue behind me? 
 - If thou did'st euer hold me in thy hart, 
 - Absent thee from felicity a while, 
 - And in this harsh world drawe thy breath in paine 
 *A march a farre off.* - To tell my story: what warlike noise is this? 
  *Enter Osrick.* Osr.:  - Young *Fortenbrasse* with conquest come from Poland, 
 - To th'embassadors of *England* giues this warlike volly. 
  Ham.:  - O I die *Horatio*, 
 - The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit, 
 - I cannot liue to heare the newes from *England*, 
 - But I doe prophecie th'ellection lights  
 - On *Fortinbrasse*, he has my dying voyce, 
 - So tell him, with th'occurrants more and lesse 
 - Which haue solicited, the rest is silence. 
  Hora.:  - Now cracks a noble hart, good night sweete Prince, 
 - And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest. 
 - Why dooes the drum come hether? 
  *Enter Fortenbrasse, with the Embassadors.* For.:  - Where is this sight? 
  Hora.:  - What is it you would see? 
 - If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search. 
  For.:  - This quarry cries on hauock, o prou'd death 
 - What feast is toward in thine eternall cell, 
 - That thou so many Princes at a shot  
 - So bloudily hast strook? 
  Embas.:  - The sight is dismall 
 - And our affaires from *England* come too late, 
 - The eares are sencelesse that should giue vs hearing, 
 - To tell him his commandment is fulfild, 
 - That *Rosencraus* and *Guyldensterne* are dead, 
 - Where should we haue our thankes? 
  Hora.:  - Not from his mouth  
 - Had it th'ability of life to thanke you; 
 - He neuer gaue commandement for their death; 
 - But since so iump vpon this bloody question 
  - You from the *Pollack* warres, and you from *England*
 - Are heere arriued, giue order that these bodies 
 - High on a stage be placed to the view, 
 - And let me speake, to yet vnknowing world 
 - How these things came about; so shall you heare  
 - Of carnall, bloody and vnnaturall acts, 
 - Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters, 
 - Of deaths put on by cunning, and for no cause 
 - And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke, 
 - Falne on th'inuenters heads: all this can I  
 - Truly deliuer. 
  For.:  - Let vs hast to heare it, 
 - And call the noblest to the audience, 
 - For me, with sorrowe I embrace my fortune, 
 - I haue some rights, of memory in this kingdome, 
 - Which now to clame my vantage doth inuite me. 
  Hora.:  - Of that I shall haue also cause to speake, 
 - And from his mouth, whose voyce will drawe no more, 
 - But let this same be presently perform'd 
 - Euen while mens mindes are wilde, least more mischance 
 - On plots and errores happen. 
  For.:  - Let foure Captaines  
 - Beare *Hamlet* like a souldier to the stage, 
 - For he was likely, had he beene put on, 
 - To haue prooued most royall; and for his passage, 
 - The souldiers musicke and the right of warre  
 - Speake loudly for him: 
 - Take vp the bodies, such a sight as this, 
 - Becomes the field, but heere showes much amisse. 
 - Goe bid the souldiers shoote. 
  *Exeunt.* FINIS. The Tragedie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke.
