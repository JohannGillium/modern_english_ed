# LADY FREEDOM AMONG US

   - don't lower your eyes
 - or stare straight ahead to where
 - you think you ought to be going
    - don't mutter *oh no*
 - *not another one*
 - *get a job    fly a kite*
 - *go bury a bone*
    - with her oldfashioned sandals
 - with her leaden skirts
 - with her stained cheeks and whiskers and heaped up trinkets
 - she has risen among us in blunt reproach
    - she has fitted her hair under a hand-me-down cap
 - and spruced it up with feathers and stars
 - slung over one shoulder she bears
 - the rainbowed layers of charity and murmurs
 - *all of you   even the least of you*
   - don't cross to the other side of the square
 - don't think *another item to fit on a tourist's agenda*
   - consider her drenched gaze   her shining brow
 - she who has brought mercy back into the streets
 - and will not retire politely to the potter's field
   - having assumed the thick skin of this town
 - its gritted exhaust its sunscorch and blear
 - she rests in her weathered plumage
 - bigboned     resolute
   - don't think you can ever forget her
 - don't even try
 - she's not going to budge
   - no choice but to grant her space
 - crown her with sky
 - for she is one of the many
 - and she is each of us
