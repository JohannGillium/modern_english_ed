# THE RED FLOWER OF THE MADMAN.


 	 	BY M. GARSHINE. "IN the name of his majesty, the Czar, Peter the First, I order an immediate inspection of this asylum for the insane!" 

These words were uttered in a shrill, sharp voice.  The secretary of the establishment seated before a table stained with blotches of ink, and about to inscribe in an enormous register the name, age, etc., of the new patient, could not restrain a smile.  As to the two young men that accompanied the madman, they did not feel  much like laughing; they were hardly in a condition to keep on their legs, owing to the two nights they had passed on the railroad with the patient.  At the station before the last, he had had a furious attack, and they had been obliged to procure in all haste a straight waistcoat in the city, and to force him into it with the assistance of the gendarmes and several employés of the road.  In this manner they had brought him to the asylum. 

His appearance was repulsive.  A blouse of coarse cloth, widely open at the breast, covered his gray suit, which he had torn into shreds during his late outburst of frenzy.  The long sleeves drew his arms across in front and were tied behind his back in a large knot.  His red, inflamed eyes (he had not slept for ten days) glared with a fixed and haggard look; his lower lip writhed, jerked by a nervous spasm, and his curling hair hung in disorder over his forehead.  He strode up and down the office with rapid steps, making the pavement resound loudly under his boots, casting defiant looks around him—on the boxes stuffed with dusty papers, on the furniture covered with waxed cloth, and on his companions. 

"Lead him into the apartment to the right!" 

"I know, I know!  I was here before, last year.  We passed in review the entire establishment.  I know all; it will be difficult to conceal anything from me, no matter what," said the patient. 

He turned towards the door.  The guardian opened it for him. With the same automatic step, firm and resounding, and holding high his uneasy head, he left the office and walked rapidly to the right where the cells reserved for the insane were placed.  His companions found it hard to keep up with him. 

"Ring the bell!" 

"I can't.  You have tied my hands." 

The attendant opened the door.  They entered the mad-house. 

It was an old building in massive stone and antiquated style. There were two immense halls.  The dining room and a room common to the quiet patients, a wide vestibule with a glass door, leading into a flower garden; then about twenty separate cells, where ordinary patients were kept, formed the ground floor. Besides these, there were two other gloomy apartments, the one padded and lined with thick cushions, and the other, wainscoted over the entire wall where the patients were carried during their mad fits, and finally a vast room built with a cupola, and the bath-room, with several huge bathing tanks.  The upper story  was for women.  A fearful noise of howls and cries could be heard. 

The house had been arranged for eighty patients, but as the surrounding districts had no institution of this kind, there were at present three hundred packed within its walls.  In each of the narrow cells were four or five beds.  In winter when the patients could not go into the garden, and when the barred windows were hermetically closed, the air in the asylum was pestiferous and insufferably heavy. 

The new patient was introduced into the bath-room.  This apartment could not fail to make a painful impression on a man of sound mind; how much more painfully must it impress a diseased and irritable imagination.  It was large and paved, with the ceiling in the form of a cupola, and lighted only on one side by a small window.  The walls and arches were painted dark red. 

In the dirty gray soil two enormous basins were hollowed out. They looked like two graves of an oval form.  A big copper furnace with cylindrical reservoir and a complete system of pipes for douching, occupied a space opposite the window.  Every thing in this room had a strange, lugubrious aspect, as though contrived to produce a vivid impression on a sick brain.  The attendant at the baths, a coarse and powerful Sokal, who never spoke a word, added not a little with his sinister face to the horror of the apartment. 

When they had led the madman into his chamber to bathe him, and (following the sanitary method of the head physician) to apply a huge blister plaster to the back of his neck, the patient was seized with horror and fell into a terrible rage.  Mad fancies, each one more horrible than the other, hurtled and clashed in his brain.  His hair stood erect; he was bathed in cold sweat. 

What was this?  A chamber of torture?  A place of execution where his enemies wished to get rid of him?  Perhaps even—hell! And if it was hell!  Then the idea shot through his brain that he was going to be questioned as in the Middle Ages. 

They undressed him in spite of his desperate resistance.  With a strength rendered triply great by his malady, he tore himself loose from the attendants and overturned them.  At last he was thrown to the ground by four strong men, seized hand and foot, and lowered into the basin filled with hot water. 

The water seemed to him boiling, and his poor sick brain engendered the insane thought that he was being subjected to the torture of fire and water.  The warm water entered his mouth.  He stiffened himself and dealt blows and kicks about him, although held by the attendants.  And in the midst of howlings interrupted by endless lamentation, prayers burst from his lips at one moment, and at the other, blasphemies.  He shouted until he could speak no more, and ended by moaning pitifully with great burning tears rolling down his cheeks. 

"Great and holy St. Gregory, into thy hands I commit my body. As to my spirit—no—oh, no!" 

The keepers did not let go of him, although, thanks to the warm bath and the bladder full of ice that they had placed on his head, he had become a little calmer.  However, when they had taken him out of the bath, and seated him on a stool in order to apply the big blister to the back of his neck, a remnant of his vigor re-appeared and the mad fancies took possession of him with renewed force. 

"Why?  Why?" he howled.  "I don't want to do harm to any one.  Why do you torture me?  Oh! oh! oh! God!  You martyrs that have gone before me, deliver me!" 

The burning of the plaster carried his madness to its climax. He beat the air anew with his feet and hands.  The attendants could not master him.  They stood there disheartened. 

"There is nothing to do," said the attendant that directed the operation.  "All must be destroyed." 

The patient started at these words.  He was frightened.  A trembling seized him. 

"Destroyed?  Destroy what?  Me," he thought. 

Frightened to death, horrified, he closed his eyes.  The attendant took a coarse napkin at both ends and rubbed him with it rapidly, pressing hard on the back of his neck, and tearing the plaster off with the skin.  It stuck to it so well that a large and bleeding wound was formed. 

The pain that the patient suffered, and that would have exasperated a healthy man,  seemed to the miserable madman unspeakable.  With a desperate wrench of his back he escaped from the hands of the nurses, and threw himself on the stone pavement. Then he imagined they had beheaded him.  He wished to cry and groan, but he could not.  The keepers laid him on a litter and bore him away.  He fell into a deep sleep, a sleep so long and heavy that it was like death.

     
# II.

  WHEN he awoke it was night.  All was quiet.  In the neighboring chamber the deep respiration of the slumbering patients could be heard, and farther away, a madman that had been locked up in a dark cell talked loudly with himself in a monotonous tone, his voice pitched to a strange key.  In the upper story where the female department was, a contralto voice was singing an obscene song.  He held his breath and listened.  He felt weary; it seemed to him all his limbs were broken, and he had such an agonizing pain at the back of his neck. 

"Where am I?  What has happened to me?" he thought. 

Suddenly his mind became clear.  He recalled distinctly every thing that had happened to him during the last year of his life.  All, even to the minutest detail, came back to him.  He knew that he was ill at that very moment, and he understood the nature of his disease. A procession of fantastic ideas, of insane words and actions defiled through his mind.  He recalled every thing, and a horrible chill shook him from head to foot. 

"Well, it is finished at last," he murmured.  "God be praised!" 

And he fell asleep again. 

The open window, guarded with iron bars, opened into a narrow and tortuous way that extended between the great buildings and a stone wall.  This path was unused.  It was invaded by a wilderness of wild bushes, among which an enormous thicket of lilacs stood in bloom at this moment.  Behind the bushes, just in front of the window, rose a high, dark wall, over which the trees of the garden stretched their branches, lit up by the pale moonbeams. 

To the right, a wing of the asylum could be seen, quite white in the shade, with its grated windows behind which shone a light.  To the left could be perceived the dim walls of the dead house silvered with soft radiance.  The moonbeams passing through the bars of the window shone dazzlingly upon the large stone flags of the floor, and bathed in a sparkling haze a part of the bed and the livid face and closed eyelids of the patient. 

At this hour nothing in his appearance betrayed the madman. He was sleeping the profound and tranquil sleep of a martyr, without a dream, without the least movement, almost without breath. 

He woke at moments with a perfectly sane and lucid mind. Then in the morning, when he re-opened his eyes, he was mad.

    
# III.

  "How do you feel?" the doctor asked him the next day. 

The sick man had just awakened.  He was still resting under the bed cover. 

"Very well," he answered, rising. 

He slipped his feet into his slippers, and took his dressing gown. 

"Perfectly well.  Only one thing—here." 

He touched the back of his neck. 

"I can't move my neck without pain.  But that is a trifle.  Every thing is all right when one understands, and I understand." 

"Do you know where you are?" 

"I'm in a mad-house.  But when you can reason about such things, you feel perfectly indifferent, perfectly indifferent!" 

The doctor gave his eyes close attention.  His handsome rosy face fringed with a carefully-kept beard, and its two gentle, blue eyes shining behind gold-rimmed spectacles, was absolutely calm. He examined his patient. 

"Why do you look at me like that?  You cannot read my soul," continued the sick man, "while I can read yours clearly.  Why do you do evil?  Why have you imprisoned these unfortunate creatures here, and refuse to give them their liberty!  To what purpose are all these torments?  A man possessed by a grand idea, an idea inspired by genius—ah, well! such a man is entirely indifferent to the surroundings in which he lives, and to what he experiences—even to the sensation of being and of not being.  Is it not so?" 

"It is possible," answered the physician, establishing himself on a chair in a corner in order better to observe the sick man, who was walking up and down the cell so fast  that his calfskin slippers, a size or two too large, flapped with a clatter on the pavement, and the skirts of his dressing gown with its red stripes and clusters of big flowers blew to right and left.  The surgeon and the nurse, who accompanied the doctor, remained at the door immovable and as straight as ram-rods. 

"My soul, my soul, has been possessed by an inspired idea too!" cried the patient.  "And from the moment that I became aware of it, I have felt like one born anew.  The sensitiveness of my nerves has become so acute, my brain works more than ever.  Formerly I used to arrive at a knowledge of things by syllogisms and hypotheses; now, it is simply by intuition.  And really, I have attained to that at which philosophy aims, that which it has striven after so long.  I have come to comprehend this grand thought—that space and time are merely figments.  I live in eternity.  I live without space—everywhere and nowhere, which ever you please. Therefore it is indifferent to me whether you detain me here, or give me my liberty, whether I am free or imprisoned.  But I am not alone in this house.  Many people share my lot.  For them, such a state of things is horrible.  Why do you not give them their liberty?  What good does this do any one?" 

"You said," interrupted the physician, "that you lived outside of time and space.  You will agree, however, that at the moment we are in this room, that it is—" here the doctor drew his watch—"that it is half-past ten and the 6th of May, 18—.  What do you say to that?" 

"Nothing.  When or where I live is indifferent to me.  That is to say, I am eternal and everywhere." 

The doctor smiled. 

"Droll logic," said he, rising.  "Still, you are right.  Good-bye. Would you like a cigar!" 

"With pleasure, thanks." 

He stopped, took the cigar, and bit off the end of it nervously. 

"That requires reflection and much reflection," he said.  This is the world, the microcosm.  One extremity encloses the bases, and the other the acids.  This is also the pivotal point of the universe where the most opposite principles neutralize each other.  Good-bye, doctor." 

The physician withdrew.  The patients stood at the end of their beds and waited for him.  No superior enjoys so high an esteem and respect as the psychologist in the presence of his patients. 

As to our patient, he continued walking up and down his chamber.  They brought him tea.  He swallowed standing, at two draughts, the contents of a big cup, and a large piece of white bread in a few mouthfuls.  Thereupon he left the cell, and for several hours without an instant's pause kept running through the entire house. 

The day was rainy.  The patients did not go into the garden. When the surgeon sought his patient he was pointed out to him at the end of the corridor.  He was standing before the door leading to the garden, his face pressed against the glass, and he was looking fixedly at a patch of green.  His attention was wholly concentrated on a flower of a strange burning red color, a kind of wild poppy. 

"You are going to be weighed," said the surgeon. 

The madman turned round.  His questioner started violently, and recoiled with fear, so terrible were the madman's eyes with hatred, so sparkling with savage rage.  But when he noticed the surgeon, his expression changed suddenly.  He followed him quite docilely, without a word of revolt, and as though absorbed in a reverie. 

They entered the doctor's cabinet, where the patient placed himself upon the platform.  He was weighed, and the surgeon inscribed in the register, "one hundred and nine pounds."  The next day his weight was one hundred and seven, the day after, one hundred and six. 

"If this continues, he won't last long," said the doctor. 

He prescribed for him the strongest kind of nourishment.  But in spite of that, and although the sick man had an excellent appetite, he grew thinner every day.  He did not sleep any more, and was morning and evening in a state of feverish delirium.

   
# IV.

  HE knew that he was in an insane asylum.  He knew that he was mad.  Sometimes, after a feverish day, he would wake during the night with weary limbs and a horrible headache, but entirely rational.  Perhaps it  was the lack of impressions during the darkness and nocturnal silence; perhaps it was the too great feebleness of his brain, the absence of the restless creatures by whom he was surrounded, that occasioned such moments during which he comprehended his condition and became lucid. 

But the morning would come, and from the dawn when the house was again in commotion, the strange and weird sensations crowded upon him.  His diseased brain did not have the power to master them, and madness resumed its sway.  His case presented a curious mixture of rational and insane ideas.  He knew that he was in the midst of madmen.  All the time while knowing it, he saw in each one of them a being—some one who was in hiding or who had been kidnapped, some one whom he had known formerly, whose name he had read, or heard spoken.  The establishment seemed to him filled with people of all times and all countries.  There were there, the living and the dead.  There, were to be met with illustrious personages, celebrities, soldiers fallen in the last war, people that had been hanged and resuscitated.  He believed himself in an enchanted circle, a mysterious place, that contained in itself alone the power of the entire universe; and he himself (very proud of it) imagined that he was the center of this circle. 

All his companions in misfortune had combined for the accomplishment of a great work, of a thing that he considered an important and inspired undertaking—the annihilation forever of evil on the earth.  He did not know in what this undertaking consisted, but he felt in himself a tremendous force to accomplish it.  He could read the thoughts of others.  When he looked at objects he knew their history.  The great elms in the garden related to him the events of former times.  He took the hospital, which, it is true, dated many years back, for a construction of Peter the Great, and he was sure the Czar had inhabited it at the time of the battle of Pultawa.  He read all this on the wall, on the stucco falling in dust, on the fragments of brick, on the stones in the garden.  The history of the establishment was engraven from one end to the other on these scattered objects. 

He peopled the little house that served as a morgue with hundreds of dead men, dead for many years, and scrutinized the narrow skylight of the vault in a corner of the garden with unwearied attention.  He saw in the vague light projected through the dust-stained windows, well-known faces of men he had seen or the pictures of whom he had contemplated. 

However, fine weather with its genial warmth returned.  The patients passed the whole day in the open air.  The little umbrageous place that was their favorite haunt was literally covered with flowers.  All that were able worked under the surveillance of a guardian.  They weeded the walks from morning till evening, and carpeted them with fine sand, spaded the beds, and watered the plants, cucumbers, and melons that they had sown themselves. 

One corner of the garden was all in leaf with cherry trees. Here began an avenue lined with elms.  The middle forming an artificial mound, was adorned with an immense bed of beautiful flowers of brilliant and varied colors, over which towered a cluster of rare tulips, a gorgeous flower of a golden yellow color flecked with red flame. 

The tulips formed the center of the garden, and many of the patients attributed to them a peculiar and mysterious significance. 

The walks were lined with pretty shrubs and plants.  There all the flowers that are to be found in Little Russia teemed: tall and brilliant geraniums, bright petunias with delicate petals, big tobacco plants with pale leaves, and little pink flowers, curled mint, amaranths, cresses, and poppies.  Not far from the stairway three wild poppy plants of a curious species, grew.  Their flowers were very small, and were distinguished by their fire-red color and extremely vivid lustre.  They looked like tufts of glowing embers. These were the flowers that our patient observed from the first day of his arrival at the asylum when he looked into the garden through the glass door. 

When he entered the garden for the first time, he contemplated for a long time before descending the stairs, the wild poppies with their dazzling red petals.  There were only two flowers, separated by a considerable space.  The place not having yet been weeded, had been invaded by a thick covering of wild grass and by a swarm of white fringed daisies. 

The patients passed through the door, one  by one, near which one of the keepers stood, who handed to each of them a knit cotton cap, white and pointed at the top, with a red cross in front. The madman immediately attributed a peculiar and mystic significance to the red cross.  He took it off, looked at the cross that adorned it.  Then he gazed at the poppy; its flowers were of a much more vivid scarlet. 

"That is what bears it," he murmured, "only for us two." 

And he descended the stairs.  He walked through the grounds without having been noticed by the keeper standing behind him, and stretched his hand towards the flower.  Yet, he couldn't make up his mind to pluck it. 

All at once he felt in his extended hand, painful, burning prickings that spread from his arms through his entire body.  A magnetic fluid of unheard-of power emanated from that red flower and invaded his whole organism.  He stooped lower; his fingers almost touched the flower.  But it defended itself, it resisted, vomiting, as it seemed to him, blasts of fetid odor charged with poison.  He turned his head aside, and made a last effort to seize it. Already he held the stem pressed between his fingers, when a heavy hand came down upon his shoulder.  It was the hand of the keeper. 

"Mustn't pluck it!" said the old Sokal, "and you mustn't walk in the flower beds.  For if there were many of you madmen who had that fancy, it wouldn't be long before every flower in the garden would be gone." 

He added the last sentence in a persuasive voice, without taking his hand from the patient's shoulder. 

The sick man looked in his face, freed himself from his hold without a word, and began to walk up and down the garden in great agitation. 

"O you unfortunates!" he thought.  "You see nothing.  You are so blind that you defend it.  But, at all costs, I shall reach it!  If it is not to-day, it will be to-morrow.  We shall measure our strength with one another.  And even if I must die for it—well! what matter?" 

He walked in the garden until evening, making many acquaintances and pronouncing strange discourses, which were taken by those with whom he spoke as answers to their own lucubrations—these lucubrations in turn being considered by our madman as mysterious revelations of the highest importance.  The sick man walked now with one, now with another of his companions in misfortune, and when evening came he had reached the perfect conviction that "all was ready," as he repeated to himself in a low voice.  Soon, yes, soon the iron bars would fall in fragments, the prisoners would quit the place to spread themselves over all the countries of the world.  The earth would tremble, would be despoiled of her ancient garment to be re-clothed resplendently in new and youthful beauty. 

He had hardly thought any more of the flower; but when he was preparing to mount the stairs, he perceived on the sward, heavy with large pearls of dew, two burning embers of a vivid red.  Then he remained in the rear, letting all the other patients pass before him, hiding behind the keeper and watching a favorite opportunity. No one saw him cross the flower bed, pluck the flower, and hide it in his bosom under his shirt.  When its moist and cool petals touched his skin a mortal pallor covered his face and he opened his eyes, all big with horror, while an icy perspiration pearled his forehead. 

They were lighting the lamps in the asylum.  The patients for the most part, stretched themselves on their beds waiting for supper, while a few uneasy madmen walked feverishly through the corridors and halls.  Our patient with his flower was among the last. He crossed his two hands convulsively on his breast.  He seemed to wish to smother that flower and to crush it.  When he met one of his comrades he sprang from him with a bound, fearing to touch him with his garments. 

"Don't come near me!  Don't come near me!" he cried. 

But it was in an insane asylum where words like these are considered of no importance.  He walked more and more rapidly with automatic steps.  He walked one hour, two hours, lost in a somber fury. 

"I shall destroy you!  I shall smother you!" said he in a hoarse voice and with mad gesticulations. 

From time to time he ground his teeth terribly. 

Supper had been served in the dining hall.  On the great bare tables were arranged big bowls of yellow wood with red figures traced  on them, filled with thin vegetable soup.  The patients took their places on the benches and received each a round loaf of coarse bread.  About eight ate from the same bowl, from which they helped themselves with wooden spoons.  Those for whom more nourishing food had been ordered, ate apart.  Our madman, who had swallowed quickly the portion brought to him in his cell by the keeper, had descended, still ravenous, into the common hall.  He tramped about, here and there, apparently much discontented. 

"Will you permit me to take a seat here?" he asked the inspector. 

"Haven't you had your supper yet?" this official asked, busily engaged filling fresh bowls with lentils. 

"The fact is, I am literally dying of hunger.  I need a great deal of nourishment.  That is the only thing that sustains me.  You know I cannot sleep, even for a minute." 

"Eat, my friend, and much good may it do you.  Taras, bring him a bowl and some bread." 

He seated himself near one of the dishes and swallowed a great quantity of soup. 

"Enough, now, enough," said the inspector at last, when all the patients had quitted the table, and our madman remained alone, still helping himself eagerly out of the bowl, holding the spoon with one hand and the other pressed convulsively against his breast.  "You are going to make yourself sick." 

"Ah, if you knew how much strength I need, and what strength?  Good-bye, Nicolas Nicolaïewitch," said the unfortunate, rising from his seat and pressing the hand of the inspector.  "Good-bye!" 

"Where are you going, pray?" asked the inspector, smiling. 

"I?  Nowhere.  I shall stay here.  It is possible, however, that we may not see each other to-morrow.  I thank you for the great kindness you have shown me." 

He pressed the hand of the inspector a second time forcibly. His voice trembled and big tears stood in his eyes. 

"Calm yourself, my dear friend.  Do not disquiet yourself," replied the inspector.  "What good do all these sad repinings do? Go to bed and have a good sleep.  You ought to sleep more.  If you sleep you will soon be cured." 

The poor wretch began to sob.  The inspector turned round and ordered the table to be cleared.  A half hour later all were asleep in the house except one, who lay stretched on his bed with his clothes on.  He trembled as though in the grip of a fierce fever, with his hand pressed strongly to his breast, where he seemed to feel the embrace of poisoned flames running in fiery undulations.

   
# V.

  ALL that night he did not close an eye. 

He had plucked the flower, believing to have performed thereby a heroic action, which was imposed upon him, and which he wanted to accomplish regardless of consequences.  At the first glance he had cast through the glass door, his attention had fixed itself on this red flower, and from that moment he had comprehended what was his mission. 

In this red flower with incandescent petals were concentrated the evil, the sins of the whole world.  He knew that poppies are used in the making of opium.  Perhaps it was this thought, distorted by a morbid imagination, that took on monstrous forms and developed in him fantastic ideas of an exquisitely acute morbidness. 

In his eyes, this flower was the incarnation of evil on the earth. It was steeped in blood, in all the blood shed wrongfully in the world!  Gorged with the blood, the gall and the tears of humanity, it stood triumphant.  This flower was a terrible and mysterious being, the adversary of God, Arimanes, who had clothed himself in a form of innocent and modest seeming.  The flower had to be plucked and bruised to powder. 

But that was not all.  It was necessary when it died to prevent it from exhaling among men its last poisonous breath.  Therefore he had buried it in his bosom.  He hoped, if he kept it there until morning, it would have lost its destructive power.  Evil sin would enter his bosom and would filter into his soul, and in this manner would be vanquished.  As for himself, he would be lost, but would die in a heroic struggle.  He would be humanity's noblest martyr, because until now there had been no one found to dare the combat, body to body, with the personification of evil, that bad genius whose power was so great. 

"They did not notice.  I have seen that.  Ought I to let it live?  No.  It must be destroyed, annihilated forever." 

He writhed, extended on his couch, bathed with sweat, his hair erect with fright, his strength growing less little by little.  In the morning the surgeon found him nearly dead.  In spite of his weakness the patient arose, sprang down from his bed, and ran through the whole house in great agitation, holding with his companions conversations more incoherent than ever.  He spoke with himself also, in a vibrating voice, gesticulating wildly.  He was not permitted to go into the garden, and the surgeon on weighing him found his weight diminished by several pounds.  He ordered strong injections of morphine to be administered.  The madman made no opposition.  At this moment he had happily a short interval of lucidity, which was favorable to the operation.  He soon dropped asleep; his nervous gesticulation ceased, and the perpetual buzzing in his ears, which had occasioned his jerking and noisy step, and which he tried to escape in his feverish journeyings to and fro, completely disappeared.  He became oblivious of all things, and dreamed of nothing, not even of the second flower, the task of plucking which he had imposed upon himself. 

At the end of three days, however, he succeeded in tearing it from its stem, and that under the very eyes of the keeper, who did not have time to prevent him.  The keeper pursued him into the corridor.  The madman ran to his chamber, uttering a loud cry of victory. 

He had hidden the flower in his bosom, and pressed it passionately against his heart. 

"Who permitted you to pluck flowers?" cried the keeper, when he caught up with him. 

But the sick man, stretched on his bed with arms folded, answered with a flood of words so incoherent that he contented himself with removing from the patient's head the cap with the red cross, which he had forgotten to take off in his flight.  Then an attack of furious madness broke out.  The patient felt the flower disgorging torrents of poison, which became solidified and took the form of venomous serpents.  These serpents entwined him, covered him with sharp bites, imprisoned his limbs in their steely coils, spewed over his whole body a burning and foul saliva, whose corrosive action wounded him cruelly.  He wept in a loud voice.  He called upon God to help him, and cursed his enemies. 

Towards evening the flower was withered.  The madman crushed the blackened plant under his heel, stamped on it, and collecting its smallest particles, carried them to the bath-room. Here he threw them in the glowing furnace on the embers.  And looking at his enemy writhing and hissing in the flames, he saw it curl up and transform itself into a tiny flake of snowy whiteness. He blew upon it, and every trace of it disappeared.  Then he drew a long breath. 

The following day his condition had become much worse. Pale as a sheet, with cheeks fallen in, his eyes fixed and burning in their inflamed orbits, he dragged himself from morning till evening through all the rooms, without rest, staggering and faltering at each step, a mad race accompanied by feverish discourse and haggard gesticulation. 

"I am afraid to use violence with him," said the head physician to his assistants. 

"However, it is in the highest degree necessary.  He weighed only ninety-three pounds to-day.  If this continues he will be dead before forty-eight hours." 

The head physician reflected a moment: "Morphine? Chloral?" he murmured undecided. 

"Yesterday the morphine injections produced no effect." 

"Well, have him bound, though, I doubt if we shall be able to save him." 

And the sick man was bound.  He was put in a straight waistcoat and laid on his bed, to which he was tied by means of broad canvas bands.  But the furious madness persisted.  It increased in violence.  He was dreadful to look at, his face a livid blue, and jaws firmly knit together.  During several hours he continued the most unheard-of exertions to break his bonds. 

Finally, stiffening himself in a supreme convulsive effort he succeeded in rending some strips of canvas and freeing his feet. Then he slipped from under the other strips that were crossed over the bed, and went up and down his cell with tied hands, walking with long steps, and declaiming an incoherent discourse interrupted with savage growls. 

"What the devil!" cried the keeper on  opening the door.  "What demon has come to your assistance?  Grizko!  Ivan! Come quick, the patient has broken loose." 

The three threw themselves upon him, and a terrible struggle took place, a struggle that exhausted the keepers and robbed the patient of his last remaining strength.  Finally, they got him on the bed, and tied him more securely than before, doubling the number of canvas bands that held him. 

"You do not know what you are doing," cried the patient in a strangled voice.  "You are consummating your own perdition!  I have seen a third one of them.  It is just half open.  It will soon be in full blossom!  Let me finish my work!  I must kill it!  Kill it!  Kill it! Then all will be finished, all will be saved.  I would send you for it, but I alone am to accomplish the task.  If one of you were so rash as to touch it you would fall blasted by lightning!" 

"Silence," said the keeper. 

The assistants withdrew.  He remained near to watch him.  The sick man became suddenly silent.  He had decided to make use of a ruse.  He remained tied the whole day, and when night came he was kept in the same condition.  The nurse gave him his supper himself; then he prepared a bed on the floor near the patient, and lay down. In a few moments he fell asleep. 

Then the madman set to work silently.  He twisted and stiffened his body, forcing it to bring his hand enveloped in the long sleeve of the straight waistcoat in contact with a rough iron bar that extended along the middle of the bed.  He succeeded in rubbing forcibly and rapidly this sleeve against the rugosities of the iron. After some time the coarse canvas cloth yielded, and he was enabled to pass out his index finger.  From that time the work went on more rapidly.  With wonderful cunning and dexterity he untied the knot that held the sleeves together.  Then he held his breath for an instant, and listened to the snoring of the nurse.  The old man was sleeping profoundly.  The patient took off the straight waistcoat and unknotted the straps that bound him to his bed.  He was free. He tried to open the door, but he found it locked inside.  The key was probably in the keeper's pocket.  The madman was afraid to awaken him if he touched him.  He decided to go out by the window. 

The night was still and dark.  The air was warm and balmy. When he opened the window, myriads of stars were shining.  He raised his eyes to heaven and looked at the glittering constellations, and rejoiced that they seemed to comprehend him and approve of him with their soft lustre.  He beheld with blinking eyes the rays they sent down to him, and felt strong in his determination. 

Now what he had to do was to separate the iron bars of the grating by bending them, to slip through the narrow opening to the lane beneath, and to climb the high wall in front of the window. There a final struggle awaited him, and then—and then—  Or, perhaps it would be his to encounter death! 

He tried to bend the thick bars with his two hands, but the iron did not yield.  He then twisted the coarse sleeves of the straight waistcoat into a kind of a rope, attached it to a bar and suspended himself by it heavily, with all his force.  After several fruitless efforts in which he employed a strength much more than that of ordinary men, he succeeded in bending one of the branches of the grating.  Then he slipped softly through the narrow aperture, first his shoulders, his elbows, and his knees, and crept along the lane and through the bushes as far as the wall.  Here he stopped.  All was quiet.  The light of the night lamps illuminated the windows from the interior of the asylum.  He saw no one.  No one noticed him. Without doubt the old keeper was still sleeping profoundly at the foot of his bed.  The stars were shining brightly; their pale beams inundated his heart with a sweet joy. 

"I come," he murmured, looking up at the sky. 

His first attempt at climbing the wall failed; he fell to the ground.  With torn nails and hands and knees bleeding, he sought a more favorable place.  There where the wall ran along the morgue several bricks had fallen and the mortar was gone.  The madman profited by these breaks in the smooth surface.  He clung to them, scrambling up the wall, and succeeded in seizing hold of the bough of an elm tree planted in the garden.  He lifted himself into the air by this, and let himself glide softly to the ground. 

He ran towards the stone stairway.  The flower, of a somber color in the night, held  erect its half-open calyx in the midst of the fresh, dew-covered sward. 

"The last!" he murmured.  "The last!  It is now victory or death!  But that is indifferent to me.  Wait," said he, with eyes raised ecstatically to the sky, "I shall soon be with you." 

He grasped the flower, bruised it, and crushed it slowly between his fingers.  Then he regained his cell by the same way he had left it.  He dragged himself painfully to his bed, and fell upon it in a faint. 

They found him dead the next morning.  The expression of his face was calm and serene.  His emaciated features, his thin lips and closed and deeply sunken eyelids were transfigured and as though illuminated with a joyous and triumphant radiance.  When they laid him on the bier one of the keepers wanted to take the red flower from his hand.  The hand was closed in a vise-like grip.  The madman carried his trophy with him to the grave.
