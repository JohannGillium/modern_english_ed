# THEMES

  Loss is a constant theme in Louisa's Diary in both her personal life and that of the slaveholding South. Louisa's losses climax with Southern defeat in April 1865 and four rapid personal tragedies in January/February, 1866: the exit of all but a handful of the freed Pantops slaves; the out of wedlock pregnancy of her "sister," Nannie Anderson by their first cousin, David Anderson; the death of Eliza Macmurdo, the eldest Anderson grandchild; the death of Louisa's Mammy Eliza, mother of Nannie and grandmother of Eliza.

  Two theses explaining the Old South are substantiated by Louisa's Diary. The enclosing garden of kin and religion does circumscribe Louisa's life and the majority of her reactions to events. Each loss must be explained by God's will and must be borne with patience and expectancy. Louisa repeatedly cautions herself to "wait and hope." The religion explanation for Southern defeat is evidenced in admonitions from the pulpit because of so many engaging in personal merriment while Southern armies are absorbing large losses and irreversible defeats and also in Louisa's fear that the Southern people are under God's rod because of their lack of humility and virtue.

  Louisa describes in detail: Preparations for attending a wedding including making the clothes for an extended visit. Beaux and dancing parties. Several weddings both before and during the war. An excursion to Monticello. Four deaths are described in detail: her brother-cousin Jim Anderson, her brother James Minor, her sister-cousin Maggie Anderson, her mammy-cousin, Eliza Leitch Anderson. A meeting of the Washington Society and the address by Edward Everett on the "Character of Washington." A visit to the State Agricultural Fair. A tour of Richmond prior to the war. The passage of armies. The Delevan Confederate Hospital in Charlottesville. Civilian fears and attitude during the war. A raid by Yankee soldiers who ransack Pantops. Small glimpses of slave life and relations with slaves before, during, and after the war. The freeing of 76 slaves by her great uncle's will and their departure for Liberia. Yankee school teachers in Albemarle County and her friendship with several. Plantation-education and the literature read.

     
# September 1st 1855 Commencing this Journal

   
## Sept. 1 and 2. 

  Cousin Lucy Anderson, her little daughter, Molly, and Sally Price with us. Also Lizzie Wood and her brother, Charlie. We are interested in Miss Pettit's new novel, *The Shadow of Later*. It does not speak much for the refinement of the writer. Sally gives us some nice music in the evenings. Hensons, "Home Again," "Sleeping I Dreamed Love," will, whenever I may chance to hear them, call forth a thought of her.

   
## Sept. 3

  Jim [Anderson] leaves for school at Bloomfield. Hope he will study hard and distinguish himself.

     
## Sept. 4 

  A letter from B. [Betsey] Bankhead.

     
## Sept. 5 

  We are very indignant at the conduct of a certain cousin of ours early this morning. Hear Brother Jim has sold his home in Orange County to Dr. Taliaferro. His move, no doubt, will be beneficial to his children and then he is doing nothing but his duty to come to Uncle Jimmy and make him comfortable during his few remaining years.

     
## Sept. 6 

  Cousin Lucy and Little Molly leave. Tom Davis and some of the young ladies take a pleasant ride to Mrs. Craven's peach orchard to see a beautiful view but finish off by eating peaches.

     
## Sept. 7

  Jimmy Lewis calls. Says the gypsies are encamped in the neighborhood. Tom, Sally and I have a ride to Thurmond's Mountain. The view from the top passed the description. All around looking so calm and grand. Surely one dwelling amidst such scenes must have purer feelings than those whose way leads them amidst the battles of the world.

    
## Sept. 8 

  The girls leave us. We go as far as town with them and call at Dr. [James A.] Leitch's where we are introduced to a very pretty young lady, Miss Lelia Carter. It is rather lonely at home after so much company. We parted with the expectation of meeting at Christmas, if all is well, at Locust Hill, but three months is a long time to look forward to in the life of "chance and change;" however, we hope for the best.  Lizzie Dee and Robert [Lewis] have been with us since the lst of Sept.

    
## Sept. 9

  Sunday I went to church. In the evening I wrote a letter, contrary to my rule.

    
## Sept. 10 

  Commenced school. The children are very bright. Make peach pickles in the morning; very tired from fanning kettles, weighing sugar and spices and measuring vinegar, etc.

    
## Sept. 12 

  Tom [Davis] leaves for a trip over the [Blue Ridge] mountains-expected back tomorrow. I think the young man will be delighted when the University [of Virginia] begins. He seems heartily tired of holidays.

    
## Sept. 13 

  Mr. Tom and Lucien Michie call in the a new buggy. Mr. T M tells us his engagement with Miss Tompson is all off and he is ready for another love affair. He seems desperate about marrying. Sue gives him B. Bankhead's legacy. Mr. Michie declares he will write to the young lady if she will only tell him where to direct it. Mr.L M discourses about the Staunton girls, daguerreotypes and rings.

    
## Sept. 14 

  This is glorious Friday and I can rest from my labors teaching school for a whole week. Milk and peaches for dinner.

    
## Sept. 15 

  Have a delightful ride on [the horse] Tammy Elpha.

    
## Sept. 16 

  A rainy Sunday brings a fine opportunity for reading, but I can read equally as well by Sun light. We all feel great unease about Tom. Should imagine he needed a change of clothes by now, as he took none with him.

    
## Sept. 17

  Commenced Rollin's *Ancient History* for a second time. Read *Henry VI*. I think I shall be friends with Shakespeare for sometime. Wrote to B. Bankhead and described a cat scene by candle light. One of the cats was caught in the very act of stealing some ham off the table. Ann [a black slave woman] wished to administer corporal punishment but I pleaded his case so well, she contented herself with a few taps.

    
## Sept. 18

  Read *Henry V.* Made some more pickles and then tied up flower seeds for Sister Sue [Minor] to be sent by Mr. Goodman. Tom returns to say in his travels he visited Staunton, Lexington, "The Bridge," and Lynchburg.

 Finish Tom and Henry a needle book. Have concluded to send off the gray kittens by the market cart.

    
## Sept. 21 

  Little Margaret [Anderson] is sick. The first turkey of the season. An invitation to cousin Mary Bankhead's wedding.

## Sept. 23

  A sermon from Mr. Meade.[Rev. Richard Kidder Meade]

    
## Sept. 24 

  Commenced school this morning after a week's holiday. I feel much discouraged about it. I wonder if I'm doing the children any good. Carry Walker and Cousin Mildred [Meriwether] are with us. Carry gives me news of the Oranges. Sue and I get "such a love of a bonnet."

    
## Sept. 26

  Daddy is sick in bed. Carry relates some of her love affairs. This is cousin Mary Bankhead's wedding day. Surely "the heavens smile upon the act" for it is beautifully clear ....

    
## Sept. 27--

 Carry and Cousin Mildred leave us today. Mr. Meade dines with us.

    
## Sept. 28

  Busy in the garden: Finish *Romeo and Juliet*: Hear Mrs. Arrowsmith [Aunt Ria who lives in New York] thinks of spending the winter in Virginia. Her cheerful company would be of great service to Aunt Sally [Mrs. Robert W. Lewis]. Daddy still poorly. A letter from brother Peter [Minor]. He tells me of the birth of his third son on the 13th of Sept. He weighs 10 pounds.

    
## Sept. 29

  The beginning of "a week of Saturdays" as I'm free from school next week. Jim at home with a friend. Teach him the accomplishment of making "a rabbit on the wall."

## Oct. 6

  Go in the morning to Kinlock and the [next] morning Go to Uncle Bob's to see Aunt Ria. She looks like real old times. At the Brick church bear a sermon from Cousin Albert Holladay. In the evening walk to Music Hall to see cousin Sarah.[Mrs. Howel Lewis]. Miss V[allant] reads us her journal from her trip this summer with her English friends.

## Oct. 9 

  A letter from Sally Williamson.

    
## Oct. 12

  Sue and Aunt Ria take a ride, on their return Sue feels pale and takes to her bed for the rest of the day. She thinks it proceeds from Old Mose's manner of trotting

    
## Oct. 13 

  Miss Vallant and Henry [Lewis] with us. Tom also gets in later in the morning. He begs me to write and make an offer of his heart and hand to "the one he adores." I agree at first but after duly considering the matter, I conclude it best to let him do his own courting. I would not like such things to come second hand. He thinks I'm right but still wishes me the "write" person. I agree to send the lady a rosebud which he fixed up. I would not be surprised if something came of it. Miss Vallant is very angry with Jimmy L[ewis] for talking about her this summer. Speaks of giving him a bit of her mind.

    
## Oct. 14 

  We go to church. Henry and Miss Vallant in the rockaway. Have a sermon from Richard Davis from the same text Mr. Holiday used on last Sunday. Flowers were scattered in profusion after church. I see William Williamson. Had a little chat about Oranges. He declined our invitation to come home with us as it was Sunday. The boys leave after dinner. Henry gives me a kiss at parting and Jack [Louisa's dog], no doubt considering it an act of possession on his part, took occasion when I lay sleeping on the sofa to lick the spot.

    
## Oct. 15-18 

  Very quiet times. Making dresses. Take some nice long walks, some of them "daring exploring expeditions" on a small scale... Enjoy hunting hickory nuts very much.

    
## Oct. 19 

  Ma sends the cart with Tom's Turkey, apples, bread and pickles. Presume he will have a banquet (a la petit) tonight. I wished to put in a cat, to take care of the goodies knowing there were some "big rats" at the University this session. How glorious the woods are now clothed in all the gorgeous tints of autumn. It seems indeed as though nature had donned her holiday attire to make herself all the more charming before taking her leave; that one reflection of her might be pleasant. "The melancholy days" are fast approaching, the "saddest of the year." Winter has many delights but the merry summer teases for me. How much we have to be thankful for this fall! the barns all full to overflowing, a prospect of plenty for the winter.

    
## Oct. 20 

  Much interested in *Ten Thousand a Year* .... There is a chance for some of us losing our affections on [the hero] Gilbert Grovernor, especially as he has the great attraction of "ten thousand a year."

    
## Oct. 21-27

  A sermon from Richard Davis. Mr. Goodlow we hear has lost one of his school boys. Poor fellow to drop away from honest friends. What a sad father. Ma very poorly. I feel so uneasy about her. Mary Walker [Meriwether Randolph] has another son. Frank [Mary Walker's son] lacks one day of being a year old. Wrote to Brother Peter ....After dinner, Friday, we are much surprised to see Miss Vallant come walking up. She had a chance to come in a carriage to the gate and from there she walked up. Daddy goes to Richmond to

 attend the Fair. Bob [Lewis] gives us a call

    
## Oct. 28-Nov. 3

  Sunday hear Mr. Meade preach. A letter from S[ally] W[illiamson]. She doesn't understand the rosebud. Met [David Meriwether Anderson] "catches it" this morning. Hope it will be beneficial. Cool, fix up the flowers for winter. They look very comfortable in their winter wrappings. A letter from Daddy-NEWS! Prissy Macmurdo is to be married to a Mr. Pemberton of Goochland. I hope she will do well. 	A letter from Miss Betsey Cattlett. She is troubled about giving up brother Jim [Minor] and his family, particularly little Dick. I meet with a loss; drop my best pin in the woods but find it in a day or so. I receive an invite to Mary Holladay's wedding but do not accept as Sue is not included and then I'm not fixed in the way of wearing apparel]

    
## Nov. 4-10 

  Tom romances us...read "Longfellow." An applause by Tom. Daddy gets home. He says we may go to Prissy's wedding if we can get ready. Aunt Ria leaves us for Castalia. Ma and Maggie [Mary Eliza Lewis Leitch Anderson and Margaret Douglas Anderson] also go down with her to Uncle Bob's. They will return on Saturday. I'm housekeeper while Ma is away.---Sue has letter from Prissy inviting us to her wedding. We have not decided about going; it will be such an expensive trip-Sue thinks our cloaks are out of date but I don't intend that the cloak shall keep me at home. Mammy Eliza [Leitch Anderson] finishes a new carpet for the parlor. It is a great improvement to "the best room."

    
## Nov. 11-17 

  Go to church and stay with sister Betty [Brown] until Wednesday. Am introduced to a cousin from Fredericksburg, Lou Young, who is visiting sister B. Rose Bankhead is also staying with her so I have a gay time. See quite a number of their beaux. Attend a meeting at the Baptist Church. It is not to my taste.

  Lou and I have quite a scene one night. We hear a noise, as we imagine, and rush down to Sister B's room where we take up our lodgings for the night as Mr. B[rown] was away. Wednesday Mammy E and Sue come up to do the shopping for the wedding and to take me home. We each get a handsome silk and a white tarlatan [as yard goods] and when finished off will be quite good enough for Richmond. Two letters, one from Aunt Ria and the other from cousin Mildred. Wrote two-S P W [Sally Williamson] and Miss Bet Catlett. Tom is with us Saturday evening.

    
## Nov. 18-24 

  Sunday...Mat Leitch comes home with us from church and brings her new silk dress for us to look at. Tom tells us about University times. Have a Yankee Bee this week getting ready for the wedding. Aunt Ria and Lizzie [Lewis] come up to help us. Lizzie comes up to learn the art of making good bread from Aunt Polly. Mat leaves us early in the week. On the 20th Mr. Davis, the new overseer, is inaugurated. Hope he may prove a faithful steward. It is stitch, stitch, stitch from morning til night getting the wedding fixings ready. Aunt Ria is a treasure. I expect Uncle Sam [Mr. Arrowsmith, Aunt Ria's husband] has found that out long ere this. The dresses are really extra. The tarlatan is made with two skirts trimmed with white satin ribbon stitched on both skirts. The body is [made the] same way with ribbons trimmed in lace. The bows are numberless. Aunt Ria made them all and some of the lace touches. The silk dresses are also handsome. Mine is a dark blue, Sue's green. They are made with folds on the body. The sleeves are very large, bound with white silk and edged with a quilting of white satin ribbon. The dresses are trimmed with luck lace and "other antiques." The collars and underdresses match. We have very pretty white cloaks to wear to the church. I will have to remember, "fine feathers do not always make fine birds," and not think too well of myself. It is indeed "all vanity and vexation of spirit." Well, I've been toiling hard for more than a week all for the enjoyment of a few days and what good will come of it?  None I'm afraid. It may give me some insight into the ways of the world, but I don't know whether that will be any advantage. Aunt Ria says I may catch a beaux. She may answer for the intent, not the event. Well, it never yet did hurt to lay down likelihood and force of hope. Time, which proveth all things, will show what my visit to Richmond did for me. We are having a merry time getting ready. Aunt Ria wages war upon the dogs and cats. She won't allow Jack a rest of the sole of his foot and Pets fares nearly as bad. On Saturday night Lizzie and I make a chicken salad for supper by way of a treat. It causes very remarkable dreams.

    
## Nov. 25-Dec. 3 

  On Sunday a strange preacher. [The sermon] was severe in the extreme but too true. (Text: There is no peace saith my God for the wicked.) Aunt Ria commits to memory that beautiful hymn of [Joseph] Addison's, "The Spacious Firmament on High." Sue, Lizzie, Aunt Ria and I agree to commit to memory a piece of poetry every month .... Nov 2óth we think the work all finished when Aunt Ria persuades us to remodel the old silks, which we do and succeed in making them very nice dresses for the evenings. After 12 o'clock at night my trunk is packed for Richmond and I lay my aching head upon my pillow for a few hours rest. "Oh, bed, bed, delicious bed, that heaven on earth for the weary head." Nov. 27th Up early. Say good bye to the loved ones at home. Aunt Ria and Lizzie go as far as Shadwell with us. John Macmurdo meets us at the cars [in Richmond]. We are warmly welcomed by cousins Sop, Ann, and the rest of the [Macmurdo] household. Get into a host of girls, all of them. Macmurdo's or Picket's. We get on very well. Get into just such a fuss as we had on Monday at home. Most of the wedding's fixings not yet finished and for all my vows that I would not touch a needle for a month to come, "fellow feeling made me kind." I called for needle and thread and went to work in real earnest. Find cousin Jim Trice in Richmond . ... How strange to see him and Daddy greeting each other with a kiss. I'm introduced to Prissie's intended. [I'm] not prepossessed in his favor; hope she is doing well and may be happy.

    
## The 28th. 

  This is Prissie's wedding day. It is cloudy early in the morning but by 12 o'clock the beams come out very brightly. We hail them with joy for "Happy is the bride that the Sun shines on." The house being in great confusion, Sue, Dutchie and I go down town. Go through the square to see the monuments and the bronze forms of Jefferson and Henry, the only two that have come. When we get back, have a nice chat with Mrs. Williamson from Williamsburg while she dresses the candle sticks.

  The ceremony takes place at 7 o'clock in the Monumental Church. The waiters are fourteen in number.	They are all taught their parts in the church yard so there is no confusion in the church. It is a very solemn ceremony joining two people together for better for worse, for richer for poorer, till death do they part. To me the scene is rendered still more solemn by the Old Church and the painful associations connected with it. Well, the die is cast. There is no Prissie Macmurdo now. It may be selfishness in me but	I'm sorry to give her up. She can never be to me what she has been but it's no use grieving, for we would all go and do likewise if the right one came and I don't believe anyone that says to the contrary. 

  On returning from church the party at home began. Oh what a sea of strange faces. I feel like a stranger in a strange land. Don't think any one would be likely to comment on my "amiable visage" this morning for I'm perfectly savage in consequence of being patronized by a gentleman that [I] don't admire. He is anxious that I shall see something of the city and invited me to take a drive with him the next day. I get off by pleading a prior engagement. Prissie had great many handsome present, 42 in all, and it speaks well for her popularity. The supper table is very pretty. Prissy has direction of affairs. [The 29th is a] beautiful day. *Lue Baffi*, Mag Bryce and I go out for a walk. Visit the gardens of two houses and feast our eyes and noses on the loveliest japonicas. See some strange looking plants from foreign parts. Eat dinner by gas light -- quite a novelty for country girls.

 [On the 30th] the bridesmaids all dine together .. at Cousin Sops. Sue and I go with Daddy and Cousin Jim Trite to the theatre. This is my first night. I'm disappointed -not being acquainted with the play and the actors were bad. Find quite a party assembled on our return. Get up a dance. The bride's cake is cut. I'm shocked to see how the gentleman down their drink in the presence of ladies. They would not be considered gentleman in Albemarle.  These are town ways, no doubt.

  	[The next day] Daddy calls early for Sue and I to go downtown to have our likenesses taken. On our way meet Mary B. Williams and Cousin Mildred on their way to see us. M B calls again later in the morning and we have a nice talk about old tines. Cousin M goes with us to the gallery and we have a pleasant time. Compare Richmond and Albemarle boys. Think the former suffer by comparison. Get some lunch and dinner on our return. The latter is late as the gentlemen dine to themselves today and the ladies have to wait. We are to attend a party at Mr. Wirt Robinson's tonight and as Mrs W R is considered the leader of the horse in Richmond, I presume it will be a brilliant affair. We get to the scene of action about 9 o'clock. How I wish I was quietly in my bed. Feel sorry for the poor dresses in such a crowd. They will be mussed a la Aunt Ria. The rooms are prepared for dancing and there is a fine bunch of musicians but no room for tipping on the light fantastic toe. Some of the belles succeed in keeping the floor in spite of the rush and crush. About 12 o'clock we are ushered upstairs to the supper room. You might imagine yourself in Fairy Land. How could any man's brain ever conceive such sweet things. It was like some of the feasts we read of in *The Arabian Night.* Such beautiful fruits, flowers and birds as I never saw before in candy. 

  	Get back to cousin Sops after 2 o'clock [AM]and after looking at a fire for sometime betook ourselves to our pillow and "morpheus rigors" until 5 o'clock when Daddy came to take us to the cars. We were soon ready, the goodbyes said, and we are off for home again. What a delightful sound! Have to walk from Shadwell as there is no carriage to meet us. Sleepy and hungry, having known no breakfast and but little rest, find all at home glad to see us. What a long week this has been. What strange, what passing strange tales we will have to tell of our visit of four days. Now I am in the Lodge once more with the cats and dogs all around me and I feel as happy as a king.

    
## Dec. 2-9 

  Sunday hear Mr. Meade. Seems dull after the excitement of last week. All spare time devoted to nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep. Get unpacked. Settle down quietly to teach school. I will have to confess to Aunt Ria I did not catch a beau. Don't believe I made the least impression on any of the smart set and for myself, I can say I returned home in maiden meditation fancy free. Sue and I pass a law expelling the dogs from our room. Have an extra supply of cats in consequence for Pets not only comes up himself but he brings up the two kittens. A letter from Brother Peter.

    
## Dec. 9-15 

  A rainy Sunday. A quiet day. Finish reading *Baxter's Saints Rest*.[Richard Baxter's *The Saint's Everlasting Rest*, 1650] Hope I'm improved by its perusal. Murderous proceedings in the hog pen. How we will feast on hog tails. Jimmie Magruder is married and I did not get an invite-think it very strange. A letter from Betsy [Bankhead]. She invites Sue and I down to Orange for Xmas. Have to decline as we have promised Sally Price. Wrote to Miss Vallant and B. Bankhead.

    
## Dec. 16-22 

  Another rainy Sunday. Tom with us all day. A letter from S[ally] P. Williamson. She gives me an invite to spend Xmas with her. It would be bliss beyond all that the minstrel hath told to me ,to spend this Christmas in Orange. On the 19th,Brother Jim calls early. We settle some business, such as housing the darkeys, etc. Says [his family] are very comfortably fixed in their new home only sister Mary has not room to turn around conveniently. [On the 20th] Sue and I go on the cars to Woodville, where Sally Price meets us with the carriage. Receive a warm welcome from Cousin Mat and Lucy. Some beaux in the evening, Mr.[Charlie] Price, Campe Goodloe and Henry [Lewis].

    
## Dec. 21st

  Friday attend a party at Mr. Goodloe's which was very pleasant. Have several acquaintances among the gentlemen and make some new ones. Dance some but did not enjoy it as the music was so bad. The supper very nice. Tom sets a story on me about a glass eye.  Thinks I'm taken. He loses his black beaver. What a laugh we get on him for supplying the country with beaver hats. Get back after one o'clock after a pleasant evening. Saturday morning call on Kate. Find her in bed. Messers Price and Roberts call in the evening and the latter gives Sally a lecture on the classics. We are much edified. Mr. Whitehead to tea. We are entertained by a G-a-li-thr-omp [sic] tonight.

    
## Dec. 23-29 

  Sunday but no church. Visitors all day. At night at Mr. Woods. The beaux are Messers Charles Wood, Terrel and Whitehead and Oh what a stiff set we all are. One might suppose we had dined on four barrels washed down with ram rod tea. Spend Xmas Eve with Kate at Cousin Fieldings [Lewis]. A pleasant time playing games and dancing. Stay until after 12 o'clock so we have an opportunity of claiming Xmas gifts.

  	Xmas Day very disagreeable. Raining hard. We are expected at Cousin Fieldings and go in spite of the bad weather and enjoy ourselves. Leave early in the evening for Mr. Woods where there is to be a party. A very small company in consequence of the bad evening.

  	Have a charming time. The girls all complain very much of a certain young man (J. W.) [Joe Woods]. He is too fond of squeezing hands. If he would only confine his attentions to any one of us, the rest, no doubt would feel envious, but he is not at all partial. Meet with some more students. One of them, Mr. Brooks, plays delightfully on the piano. Kate goes back to Cousin Mary's [Lewis] with us. She is quite sick. Joe W. pops in about dark and spends the night. [On the 28th] a party at Cousin John Lewis'. Kate is too sick to go and Lizzie Wood's father thinks her too young to go to such places without him. We are afraid it will be dull but on arriving we are revived by hearing that there are several young ladies expected from Mr. "Devil Jack" Michies." We are nearly dyked when the Michie party arrive. Oh the fuss and talk. We soon leave them and find our way to the parlor where there are two distinct sets of beaux, our acquaintances and the gentlemen who accompanied the Michie party. At first we seemed not at all inclined to mix but Cousin John insisted that we should be introduced to the Devil himself so we had to give in. Without my flattering myself, I must say ours was the most aristocratic looking part of the crowd. Had a very pleasant evening; danced until 2 o'clock.[AM] The opposite faction afforded us a great deal of amusement. Mr. Whitehead, our champion. A quarrel between two of the gents which ends in one of them taking his leave before the reels come off.  [The next day] get back to Locust Hall in time for dinner. A quiet evening. This is the winding up of Xmas. Talk over the events of the last week. Conclude that Mr. Michie's party acted very foolishly, that a certain gent made a goose of himself and that some of us would like kisses for "our Joe" and that we enjoyed ourselves superlatively. We were invited to Mr. D.J. Michie's to a dance but decline as it is Saturday night.

    
## Dec. 30-31 

  Sunday a beautiful day. Jack Frost has been busy at work all night marking the earth with an icy robe. Lizzie Wood stays the night with us. We have the company of a returned Californian. He entertained us with some accounts of that El Dorado.

  [Dec. 31st is] a bitter cold day. Take the cars for home. Call at Dr. Leitch's. Cousin L[ou) treats us to some of her Xmas goodies. Hear Mat Leitch has joined the Presbyterian Church. I know how much pleased Cousin Lou is. Have a hard road to travel getting home. The roads are covered up in ice and the poor horses slip at every step. The old folks say they have had a nice Xmas. Get my trunks unpacked and house in order and now I am ready for the New Year. I surely feel sorry to bid the old year good bye. Altogether I've been happy; have had no great sorrows; have been blessed with health and comforts; made some new friends and I hope, no enemies. But many of my air castles have melted into air, into thin air, and disappointments have cast their dark shadows before me, but that bright star of hope still cheers me on and bids me not look mournfully into the past but wisely improve the present for it is mine, to go forth and meet the shadowy future without fear and with a stout heart.! Old year, farewell! It grieves my heart, to feel we now so soon must part. Amid the changing scenes of earth, where sorrow befell, or cheerful mirth enjoyed the hour, I've walked with thee and shared thy blessed sympathy at home, abroad, with friends new found, as those to whom I've long been bound. I've traveled side by side with them, and now to part is grief to me.

      
# LIGHT FANTASTIC TOES AND "GEESE" 
 1856

   
## Jan. 1

   - 	"New Years! 
 - 	Thy proffered hand I take. 
 - 	With thee thy pilgrimage to make 
 - 	As ere thy hastly months have fled 
 - 	Perchance to slumber with the dead. 
 - 	What ere my fortune lot may be 
 - 	Which thou canst not reveal to me 
 - 	To him who rules o'er earth and sky 
 - 	Cheerful I yield my destiny. 
 - 	May He my footsteps live attend 
 - 	And crown me at my journey's end."
  New Years Day bright and clear, a fair promise for the future. As a matter of course everyone turns over a new leaf desiring that another year may find them wiser and better. My good intentions are countless. Oh, that they may not all go to swell that myriad that already pave the way to a bad place! Hear Sue Bacon has arrived in Virginia. Made some molasses pies .... Hear also that Uncle Sam [Arrowsmith] has appeared among the Castalians and they all with Sue Stanford [Bacon] purpose coming to see us on Sunday. Henry (Lewis)came down to meet the party from the lower neighborhood but we are all much disappointed to find it snowing hard on Saturday. We will miss seeing Uncle Sam as his stay in Virginia will be short . ....

Sue gets a Philodendron from Mr. Hall, one of the Xmas acquaintances. Plan to go down Saturday to see the good people at Castalia, but when the time comes, it is snowing fast.

  Snowing hard so we cannot go to church .... Several sleigh rides. Go out to Mr. Maury's in a sleigh with Cousin Lucy, Mr. and Mrs. Charlie Price and Sally P. Stay a day and night, enjoy myself, only I can't keep warm. Sore eyes very much affected. Mrs. Price brings us home in the sleigh. Find Ma sick. For the last two weeks, the weather has been ....almost equal to a Canadian winter. The whole country is still covered up in snow. The ice on the river is very thick and at one time the thermometer stood as low as 21 degrees below zero. How thankful we ought to be that we have a roof to protect us and plenty of wood to burn. Wrote to Cousin Peter Carr. A letter from Lizzie Dee. She tells me Cousin Mildred and George Macon are warming up old coals. Tom Davis and Willie Meriwether spend Saturday night and Sunday with us.

## Feb. 10-16 

  Go to church at The Cathedral. Hear Mr. Boyden from Acts 17:30. Sally Price, Sue and I spend the night at Music Hall; too muddy to get to Castalia.

Uncle Jimmy gives me much help. Shows me Parson Douglass' Register, also his mother's Bible from which I get many dates. Have merry times around Miss Vallant's fireside. Sue writes a petition to Henry to hang his Dog, Moses. It is signed by a large number of respectable people. The crime the dog is guilty of is growling and looking cross. Dine at the Creek.

Finish reading *The Pilgrim's Progress*. This morning [Match 18] at 20 minutes before three o'clock, my dear old uncle [James Hunter Terrel] was ushered into "The Spirit Land." Poor old man! His suffering were very great during the last 14 days, but he is now we know "where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest." How little we thought when he took leave of us on Monday, 2nd of Match, it would be a last farewell, but in the midst of life we are in death. His remains were interred at Music Hall on Match 19th. Daddy gets home from Richmond. Sally and Betsy Price arrive on Thursday and our Easter commences. A letter from Lizzie Dee telling us they will not come. Miss Vallant is too sick to come out.

This is also Good Friday but we do not go to church. Saturday attend church and hear Bishop Johns ....Tom comes after dinner and brings with him Mr. Whitehead. I suppose we ought to feel honored. A sorry evening.

  A beautiful day. Go to church to hear Bishop Johns again ....Uncle Hatter was confirmed today. He is Mr. Meade's first colored member and I believe him to be truly pious. Jim and Mrs Maury dine with us on Easter Sunday. Monday, in the evening have a call from the two Mr Michies. [On the] 25th We all go to the University to hear Edward Everett make his address "The Character Of Washington." It is introduced via the ladies of the Mount Vernon Association. The speech surpassed any I ever listed to. The flights of his imagination were sometimes too lofty for me-but still there seemed a kind of fascination in his voice, so that the two hours that he spoke appeared scarcely so many minutes. Spent the night at Mr. Maury's. Have a jolly time talking, dancing, etc.  Mat Leitch has been with us since Saturday the 22nd... today [the 26th] we all have to say goodbye for our Easter is over, and its cakes and its pies are visible only to memory's eyes. When will we all meet again? I've had a happy time and believe the guests enjoyed themselves. My only regret is that Miss V and Lizzie Dee could not be with us. Have the "quality" [slave workers from the community] to dine with us as they are busy on the new road. On Saturday, Tom, Sue and I go out to dinner at Cousin Sarah Gilmore's by invitation.

Willie has bid adieu to the university and is now on his way home.

    
## April 6-12 

  On Sunday hear Mr. Cashman [preach] ....Miss Vallant is still very sick. Go to a concert at The Town Hall and hear Strakosch and his wife and Parodin perform. "The Star Spangled Banner" and Marseillaise Hymn" was very fine; the first made me feel very patriotic. Strakosch's fingering on the piano was surely wonderful. Finish another Vol. of Rollins. Spring has come upon us in such earnest. The trees are beginning to look quite green and flowers are abundant. Jim and Campe with us. We spend Saturday morning fishing.

It made me feel quite young "tripping on the light fantastic toe." Make some pleasant acquaintances among the gentlemen.

    
## April 27-May 3 

  On Wednesday, we go over to town to see the corner stone of the new Presbyterian Church laid. A great day and one that will long "be green in the memory" of the good people of Charlottesville. After the ceremony of laying the stone and two addresses were delivered in the Baptist Church, the Masonic fraternity formed into a very long procession and paraded the streets decked out in all their finery; purple and gold, long blue sashes, white aprons (very much like children when going to dinner), carrying long poles, swords, goblets, candles and blocks of wood. They then proceeded to the Town Hall where a dinner [was] in readiness for them. Whitehead and Terril call in the evening; also our Orange friend, William Williams. I'm so put out by that pigmy Terril. Go to a supper at the Town Hall. Am escorted by Terril. A beautiful present from Dr. Lea, my brother-in-law. Wrote to S. Williamson. Hope she will make all clear.

    
## May 4-10 

  ....On Saturday quite a party of young people to dine with us. Mat and Ellie Adams, Sally and Juliet Minor, two Mr. Bronaughs, two Mr. Meads, Mr. Coleman, Mr.Stewart, Mr. Locket and my handsome cousin, John Skinner. Had a very pleasant day. None of the party at all troubled with stiffness. Sue and the old Bronaugh get on famously together. I intend to pay him off for some of his treatment to me ....

    
## May 11-17 

  Whitsuntide. Go to town on Monday; meet, with many acquaintances, particularly among the darkies. Get two new dresses. [On the] 17th, Sue Bacon and Miss V come up to make us a visit. Miss V is very poorly ....

Have "a grand good time:" danced every set. Had pleasant partners, also some very personal ones. "The Scotts" (a group of free black musicians) were the musicians and discoursed some of their sweetest sounds. The supper was excellent and we did not leave the festive hall until three o'clock in the morning.

    
## May 25-30 

  Get the rest of my fortune from Missouri ....

    
## June 1-7 

  On Monday a call from brother Jim and Miss Bet Catlett. The news has arrived that Billy Fish [William Hunter Meriwether] and Kate Meriwether are actually married. No one need despair now [about being too old to get married]. I don't envy her. My nose cold very bad .... Cousin Peter Johnson is...with us. We have nice talks about the Oranges. On Saturday, cousin Peter, Sue, Miss V and I go down to Music Hall. Find Henry there. He has left school; studying does not agree with him. After dinner Sister Mary and I go out visiting. See some beaux.

    
## June 8-14 

  Having a pleasant time. Use our influence to make up a match between cousin Peter and Miss V. The latter seems to be in much trouble. What vexing creatures boys are.

A letter from Dr. Lea. Wrote to Sally Williamson.

    
## June 21-28 

  Jim comes home for his vacation. Dull times. Hear Mr. Meade [preach] ....An old acquaintance. [Louisa has heard the sermon before] On Monday had a terrible hail storm; much damage was done to the crops. The hail stones were as large as partridge's eggs. Read *Rob Roy*. Go to the University on the 26th to hear Mr. Broaddus speak. Also at night to attend the celebration of the Jefferson Society. Can't say I was much edified by the speaking as I could bear but very little. Terril on the carpet again ....Sue and I spend the rest of the week with Mat; have a nice time; pay some visits. Spend a day with Sister Betty. On Saturday, 28th, Tom takes his leave for home. Poor fellow, he seemed to be really sorry to say good bye and we were no less so to give him up. Shall miss him much particularly this winter. Well the best friends must part! Hope we may meet again.

    
## June 29-July 5 

  Sunday bear Mr. Joseph Wilmus from Philadelphia. In high fix for Music Hall when a letter comes from brother Jim asking us to put off our trip until the children are better from the whooping cough. A great disappointment but we must expect crosses in this life. Fans in great demand ....Wrote to Dr. Lea. Tom sends his complements from Washington. We are amazed.

    
## July 6-12 

  Sunday hear Mr. Meade....A visit from Mr. Pemberton and Dr. Thoming, from Goochland. Mr. P is looking out for a farm; we recommend Mr. Michie's as we would like to have Prissie for a neighbor. It is decided that Mary Lewis [Anderson] shall go from home to school. Sue and I go to Ridgway to call on the Misses Maurys and Harrison and Mrs. Gibbs. The ladies are very agreeable. Sally W and Betty Bankhead come up on Wednesday.

  	I go to met them at Shadwell ....Friday have the young ladies from Ridgway to dine with us ....Betty B and I have a race for a kiss; I get it. Having a pleasant time but all our gatherings are "dove parties" for "Not a beau pretends to show his head within our door." Saturday Daddy and Jim go to "the club," so we have the house all to ourselves. Make a little noise. A letter from Lizzie Dee and Aunt Ria. The latter says Miss Vallant has had her head shaved.

    
## July 13-19 

  Mr. Meade gives us a sermon from Matthew 19, verse 16 thru 22. I prefer short texts. After supper go over to hear Bishop Johns. We are all delighted. Sermon from John 11, verses 28 and 29. "The Master is come and calleth for thee. As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto Him." Mr. Meade [Rev. Richard Kidder Meade, the rector of Louisa's church] goes to Clarke this week so we will have no preaching for some time to come. On Wednesday by appointment we dine at Ridgway. It is too warm for dinner parties. A singular coincidence occurs. Mr. Corbin makes his appearance. I feel sorry for some present. I'm very poorly. Take a shower ... which does not agree with me. A good deal of sickness in the black family. Several of the house servants very ill. Little Ellen [Anderson] also very sick. The girls leave us on Thursday for Sister Betties. They will return sometime next week when we will start for Music Hall if all is well. Sue and I spend a day or so with Mary Walker ....Conclude we ought to see more of each other and propose hereafter making an effort so to do. Mary W's little baby is a sweet little fellow, much prettier than Frank [her older son]. The warmest weather I ever felt. We are all in a melting mood. Read lst vol. of *Macaulay's Essays*.

I'm up in the course of the day as cousins Sarah Gilmer, Juliet Minor and Mr. Willie Pegram come by to dine on their way to convocation. We arrive at the sage conclusion that Juliet is one of the odd Minors. A letter from brother Peter, also one from Tom Davis ....[On the] 26th up very early. Saw the sunrise the first time for many months. Say good bye to the good folks and are off for brother Jim's ....To the Journal, I also have to say Farewell, as there is no room for it in the trunk. Expect to have some very interesting matter for it on my return. Till then, adieu.

    
## August 12th, 

  Well, here I am after 17 days absence again scratching away on the old Journal, feeling very much at home. July 25th, the day we got down, found the convocation going on. I attended only two days and heard in that time three sermons. [One from] Mr. Earnest and two from cousin Dabney Davis ....The girls set their caps at Carter Page. He seems determined on the life of single blessedness. (Place Grace Church. Time the 26th) ACT lst, Scene lst "Much Ado About Nothing" I'm not pleased!!!

    
## July 27-Aug. 2 

  Too sick to attend church. The commencement of a week of sickness. [Her brother James H. Minor is a physician.] I suffer much but thanks to brother Jim's doctoring and Sue's and the other girls' good nursing in a week's time I'm able to sit up and creep about the house. I miss all the fun. The girls go out dining, talking and calling and am obliged to content myself with the descriptions they give me of their entertainments. The neighbors are all so kind, most of them have been to see me and Aunt Sally [Sally Craven Lewis of Castalia] sends such loaves of bread. On Saturday Ma comes down to see me.

    
## Aug. 2-9 

  I'm better but still very weak. Wednesday evening take tea at Clover Fields. I enjoy the supper as my appetite at present, to use Mr. Willie Pegram's expression, "is quite faltering." On Thursday Sally and Betty take their leave for home. Oh, how lonely I feel wandering about these deserted halls. We have now been together a month and one day and I really feel lost without them. Well, it's no use sighing. Hope [there are] many happy meetings in store for us yet. Sally is a girl "after my own heart" and I consider her my first warm friendship out of my own family. Betty, too, has her good points and for good nature, I never say her equal. She has rather too much Minor blood to be exactly comfortable. She acts the Dutchman to perfection!!! [The Minor's are descended from the dutchman, Doodes Minor.] After the Oranges leave, Sue, Lizzie Dee and I go over to spend a day or so at Kinloch. (Place Kinloch, Time Aug. 7) ACT 2nd -Scene 2nd "All's Well, that End's Well."

 Stay Saturday night with Lizzie Dee. Try Uncle Bob's recipe for getting fat, nearly a pint of cream, a quart of clabber, butter bread and meat in proportions for supper. Read *Vase or The Child of Adoption*.

  No church. Get home Monday. Lizzie Dee comes with us. I'm very poorly again. The pill box and I on intimate terms.

Brother Jim and Sister Mary call to see us. The former says he will have some torches next month ready to light us to the church. He thinks they will be needed as the ceremony will be performed very early in the morning. Ma very sick. The doctor to see her. Lizzie also on the sick list. Read *Purist of The Peak*. A letter from Dr. Lea. "The Club" met at Pantops while we were away. And Mammy E made a John Bull pudding for the occasion which weighted 17 lbs. I was not sorry [we were away] as they [the all male club of which Daddy and Jim Anderson are members] are not very agreeable to ladies. Henry comes by on his way to look for his room at the University. Two Mr. Lipscomes to dine saith us. I miss their company being too much of an invalid to dress. I'm heartgrace the table today.

    
## Aug. 17-23 

  Too poorly for church. Daddy goes off to Fredricksburg to bring home Jack [black servant] who, in a trance, saw fit to take himself off. Cousins Hugh and Mary Ann Minor and some of the children spend a day or so with us ....Daddy gets home very tired. [Presumably with the retrieved slave man, Jack.]

    
## Aug 24-30 

  On Tuesday Sally Price and Charlie Wood dine with us. Sally tells us all the plans for the wedding. We are invited to go several days before hand. They are to be married early in the morning, [then] remain at Locust Hill for a day or so. There will be but little company as cousin Lucy's [Price] health is bad to allow much fixing. How Sally will be missed at Locust Hill. Hers is such a bright happy disposition that she seems indeed "the light of her home." She must have a large stock of courage to go so far from all her kith and kin with one who has yet to be tried. Hear a very romantic story about Charlie Wood and a "charming fair." No wonder he is always dreaming. A letter from B. Bankhead. Says she is counting the days until September court at which time we though of going down to see her and Sally. I'm afraid we are to be disappointed but intend to make an effort. Mr. J. Walker is to be married on Wednesday night. What will the girls do for someone to talk about? Not a word from Sally. What can be the reason. Finish reading [Nathaniel Parker] Willis' new novel *Paul Fane*, a very trashy affair. A letter from Miss Vallant. She is staying at Lake Mahopac in New York. She tells me of the fall of "The Old Charter Oak" on the 21st. As the newspapers express it, "another land mark in our colonial history has passed away."

   - 	"The Charter Oak! The Charter Oak! 
 - 	It tells us a tale Of the years that have flown 
 - 	Like the leaves on the gale 
 - 	For thou bear'st a brave annual 
 - 	On the brown root and stump 
 - 	And the heart was a casket 
 - 	For Liberty's years."
   Miss Vallant will be back the lst of Sept. Finish reading *Macaulay's Essays*  in 5 vols. Henry spends Friday night with us, says Tommy Macon has been very ill. Cousin Lou Meriwether, Mr. Christian and his little daughter from Richmond come in late Saturday night ....

    
## Aug. 31-Sept. 6 

  Hear, Mr. Nelson [preach.] Call to see Mat Leitch who has been sick some time. See Nannie Southaker; she is in great trouble having lately lost her father. On Tuesday go down to Music Hall so as to be in place for Cousin Mildred's wedding. Find sister Betty and her tribe there already. I feel quite like an old fogy with so many nieces and nephews around me. Take a peep at the Castalians. See Miss Vallant's bald pate.

   Caps are decidedly becoming. About dark after having dressed go over to Kinloch to the party. Find quite a company assembled. The bride and groom elect, the visitors and a good many relations. Talking is the only amusement; have some No. One performers at that game. Dr. Macon [the groom's father] makes some very sweet speeches . Have a very nice supper and leave about 12 o'clock. Find Miss V and Lizzie reposing peacefully on our return. Early the next morning, Sept 3rd, the knot is tied at the Church by the Rev. E. Boyden. All things passed off well. The bride looked interesting as all brides do and the groom was the picture of happiness. His "I will" was as big as himself.   A few tears were shed. The usual number of kisses given and received and the loving pair were off for a bridal tour month. My best wishes attend Mr. & Mrs. George Macon. May they find their journey through this world of sunshine and shade all that their fondest wishes have pictured in their happiest moments. Daddy in Richmond on business. Ma very poorly. Dr. Leitch to see her.

    
## Sept. 7-13

  Hear Mr. Meade....On Monday go up to Ivy Creek where we are expected to see Mr. Pride and Sally made one... Kate Whitehead joins us at the University. Have a warm walk from the Depot to Locust Hill. Find the natives as busy as bees. Sally shows us all the wedding dresses. They are pretty and in good taste. Sue and I in a great dilemma about acting as bridesmaids. Sally has changed all her plans since we saw her. She is to be married at night and our dresses are morning but Sally is so anxious we agreed to lend a hand if she will take us as we are and make no more ado about it. The house full of young company in the evening. The girls ornament the parlor very prettily with greens. After tea, Kate and Henry Lewis, Lizzie and Charlie Wood and the groom elect come in. We are all eyes to see how the lovers will behave. He takes Woods' advice to put a bold face on the matter and hands Sally off onto the porch, where they have talk enough to settle the affairs of the nation. We have a nice time after supper. Lizzie Wood and I discourse on the effects of love. She gives a practical observation of the hard blows its followers sometimes receive. Sept. l0th [is] Sally's wedding day. A beautiful day. I make the bridal favors. We are in great excitement all day. Lizzie Dee comes on the cars. We are all very uneasy about a minister as Mr. Pride has none positively engaged. Cousin Met tells Sally she will have to choose between cousin Fielding (who is a magistrate) and Uncle Isaac ( a darky preacher). Sally gives the preference to the latter. Cousin Dabney Davis; however, drops in about the 11th hour and is welcomed by all. The bride and her attendants are dressed more than an hour before the groom and his men arrive. They are late in consequence of tight shoes and gloves. Mr. Pride has been at great expense and trouble in selecting his bridal trousseau, so of course he is dressed to kill, but a $5.00 breastpin outshines all the rest. Sally's dress is very simple but pretty. At last all is ready and we are told to forward.  lst Betty and Mr. Lackey, a Kentucky greenhorn; 2nd Lizzie Wood and Henry Lewis; 3rd, your humble servant and Mr. Charlie Wood; 4th Sue Moore [Anderson] and Daniel Pride. We all get through our parts but Lackey who will insist on standing in the wrong places. He is right in a few moments and the wedding proceeds and the vows are now recorded by an angel's pen on high. We enjoy the supper. Charlie Wood and I take a social stroll together. Charlie gets the ring-thereby hangs a tale. [On] Sept 11th dinner at Mr. Woods. Not much company, only the bride and groom and their attendants, Kate W. and Jim Anderson. A pleasant day.  Dinner a little stiff. My escort to dinner had lost his appetite (by later context, this is Henry Lewis)  and I was ashamed to indulge mine without company. Go back to Locust Hill for the night. This is the winding up of the frolic for us, as tomorrow we turn our faces homeward. Suppose it will be the last we shall see of Sally for when she returns from her bridal tour, she will go South. I feel sorry to give her up. She is a person that I have [enjoyed] much being so perfectly sincere. Oh happy and bright may the destiny be of a creature so artless and tender as she. [On] Sept 12th bid adieu to the festive halls and take the cars for home. Lizzie Wood and Kate W. bearing us company, also Henry Lewis. Find a letter waiting me at home from Sally W., also another for Sue and I from Tom and a Missouri cousin who is personally unknown to us. Tom talks of going to Kansas to fight the abolitionists. Dull times after so much gaiety.

     
## Sept. 14-20 

  Sue, Kate, Lizzie D. and I go to Church in the morning and hear Cousin Dabney Davis preach ....Go again after supper and have a beautiful sermon from Mr. Joseph Wilson ....Monday Kate leaves for the University and Lizzie Wood, Mary L [Anderson] and Nannie [Anderson] go down to Uncle Bob's and Sue and I are left to take care of the housekeeping. A terrible dog fight tonight. I'm awakened by the most horrible howls; rush to the window and see there are four of the men servants, [and the dogs,] Bruno, Jack and Parr, all after one poor dog. Bruno does the biting and shaking, Jack the barking and Old Parr stands off a silent spectator of the scene. The poor dog gets a most unmerciful beating and makes for home, no doubt resolving in his mind never to visit again such inhospitable neighbors. Jack got a very bad bite from a hog the next day, a judgment on him for his bad treatment of the poor wanderer. Read such a delightful book by [Nathaniel] Hawthorne called *Miss Travis, An Old Maide*. [On] Sept 17th go with Sue and Daddy to Mr and Mrs. George Macon's reception at his mothers. Get there about 2 o'clock PM and find a number of persons assembled, some 35 or 40 ladys and half the number of gentlemen. About 3 o'clock we are invited into the dining room where a very nice repast is spread out-cold meats, bread, pickles, etc on a side table and a long table set out with goodies and ornamented with flowers so that anyone who felt too ethereal for such substantials as bread, meat and ice cream might follow Dr. Macon's prescription and sip the dew from the rosebuds. Cousin Mildred seemed much at home and was bobbing around saying something pleasant to all. George looked happy and lazy. Get home by dark-very tired. [On] Sept 18th put up some tomatoes in cans. Wrote to Sally W. and Lizzie Dee. We are disappointed in our trip to Orange with Brother Jim. It cost me a few sighs. Finish reading *Natalie* by Julia Kavanagh. A letter from Miss Vallant. Ma and the children get home on Saturday. I deliver up the keys in good form. No tears shed on the occasion. Ma much improved in health by her trip.

    
## Sept. 21-27 

  Sunday hear Mr. Meade....We are visited by a Missourian cousin, George Meriwether, a son of Aunt Jane Meriwether. He tells us of the death of his brother Montgomery, Aug 25th. The weather quite cool, a slight frost on Tuesday night.  Ma begins to gather the apples. Sue, Mammy E and I call at Castalia. We are introduced to Miss Jimmy Picket.

    
## Sept. 28-Oct. 4

   Hear Mr. [James Allen] Latane ....Presume it is his first sermon. Henry comes by and spends the night on his way to the University. Get a new bonnet and cloaks. A visit from Mr. Henry from Tennessee. Cousin Jim Trice sends us by him a picture of his place in Clarksville, Tennessee. Wrote to Miss Vallant.

   -  "There are gains for all our hopes
 - There are balms for all our pains
 -  But when youth the dream departs
 - It takes something from our hearts
 - We are stronger, we are better
 - Under manhood's strenuous rigours
 - Still we feel that something sweet,
 - Followed youth with flying feet
 - And will never come again!
 - Something beautiful is vanished
 - And we sigh for it in vain
 - We behold it everywhere,
 - On the earth and in the air."
     
## Oct. 5-11 

  With Sister Betty this week. Have a pleasant time, pay some visits and receive some visitors. Find Mat Leitch very weak, feel very fearful about her. Beautiful weather-Indian Summer in perfection. The leaves already have a slight tinge of autumn on them. In a few days the roads will present a sea of flowers. Oct. with its deep and crimson streak has been the "month of my heart." Mary Lewis leaves home this week for school in town. Hope she will study hard and make up for lost time.

    
## Oct. 12-18

I ride to town Saturday evening to see about Sue's bonnet which is not quite to her mind. Mr. Dudley [one of her cats] gets entangled in the hoops; thinking them not quite in his line beats a retreat. Henry spends Saturday night with us. How much we miss Tom [Davis], particularly Saturday evenings as he was most always with us at that time.

    
## Oct. 19-25

   Hear Mr. Meade....Hear of the death of cousin Albert Holladay, which took place last night (18th).Have some charming weather this week. The woods are like a piece of tapestry ....As Woods says, "The look of nature geteth short of leaves."  In a few weeks not a vissage will remain of summer and then "stern winter comes apace with bellowing storms and frosty face." Make the Mexican pickles. Jack [one of her dogs] is suspected of sheep killing. I'm much troubled about it. Believe it all comes from being so friendly with Old Pam who is no novice in the art of killing and eating a poor innocent sheep. Miss Bella Nelson and Dr. Gardner were united in the holy state of matrimony on the 22nd at Clover Fields. Miss Vallant comes up on Friday with brother Jim to spend a day or so.

    
## Oct. 26-Nov. 1

A great deal of fever in town.

## Nov. 9-15

   Hear Mr. Latane....Finish reading [Philip] Doddridge's *Rise and Progress [of Religion in the Soul*.] A letter from Lizzie Dee. Wrote to Aunt Ria, Dr. Lea and Betty Bankhead. Finish a new scarf which Ellen [Anderson] admires extravagently. Tie up the flowers in their winter wrappings. Do some burr work. Dull times.

  At Church in the morning. Mr. Meade reads a letter from the Bishop. Find Henry at home on our return. He tells us of the sale at Music Hall. [The estate sale of Uncle James H. Terrel.] I'm invited to Bella Rives wedding next Tuesday night-don't think I shall go. Too much trouble to get ready and then I don't believe weddings pay. Read *Woods on Infant Baptism*. Sue and I take the Orange fever. A letter from Tom Davis. He is now teaching school in Boonville, Missouri. Has another love affair in hand. Speaks of the fair one as a "perfect angel."

    
## Nov. 23-29

   Hear Mr. H.B. Scott, a returned Missionary from Africa, preach in the morning ....Go again at night to the Baptist church and hear a sermon ....Sunday night was spent with Sister Betty who is poorly. Get home early Monday morning and find Jack missing. Jack came back late Monday night and the whole family rejoices with me. Henry is very poorly, comes to us to recoup for a few days ....

A letter from Tom and Jim Lewis, also one from Sally Williamson. She tells me her mother has decided to sell her farm and go into the village to live and take a school. A great change for them all. Wrote to Miss Vallant. Sue and I will go to Music Hall next week if all is well ....

    
## Dec. 7-13

   Hear Mr. Meade....[Take] my first communion. God grant that I was worthly of that precious feast. Help me to watch and pray And on Thyself rely Assured if I my trust betray I shall forever die.

  Go down to Music Hall on Monday. Find Sister Mary alone, brother Jim having taken the freed servants to Norfolk to ship them for "Africa's sunny clime." He gets back this week and has so many amusing stories to tell of their trip down. Poor things. To many of them their freedom will prove anything but a blessing. My kindest wishes attend them to their new home. Miss V spends several nights with us. Charlotte and Lizzie call. At the Creek for a day and night. I get roused on "the goose question." [slave insurrections] ....

    
## Dec. 14-20

  A rainy Sunday. Divide the week between Uncle Bob's, Kinloch and Music Hall. Talk politics with Uncle B

 and Miss V. The excitement on the goose questions (insurrections among the darkeys) continues. Brother Jim has some horrible stories to tell me of Mad Dogs, Bears and Wolves. Thinks I will be frightened from the neighborhood. While at Kinloch, Sue, Charlotte and I lodge in "Nebraska." Cousin Tom [Dr. Thomas Nelson Meriwether] interests me in his...letter. Wishes me to find out who Mildred Thompson was. There is an air of mystery about the letter which I do not like. I fear the young lady is trying to play off some prank on the old Dr.

    
## Dec. 21-27 

  Another Sunday without church. Have the service read at home. Also a sermon. Get back to Music Hall on Monday and find Lilly Brown [Sister Betty Brown's daughter] and Tommy Minor [Brother Jim's son] very sick with pneumonia. They get better toward the last of the week. We then begin fixing for the Xmas Tree for the children. Cousins Th[omas] and Lizzie Watson arrive with their five and with the six already in the house, makes quite a bunch. Henry comes down. Finds himself unable to study on account of the above. Xmas Day bright and beautiful-almost as mild as a spring day. Spend the morning fixing for the Tree. We cannot have it on Xmas Eve because the sick children cannot enjoy it. Tomorrow  night (26th) is the time now fixed.  After dinner Lizzie Dee sends for us to spend the night with her. She has a houseful of young people stopping up with her so we have a merry time. "The Captain" and his company are called out after supper to "hunt geese." [Slave patrollers out looking for wandering slaves.] Friday night the tree is ready and the children are invited into the parlor to see it and receive their presents. All went off well. The youngsters seemed highly delighted with the shipes, dolls, monkeys, candies, etc. I believe it will be a bright spot in the memory of the young ones for some time to come. Saturday we are at the Creek. [Creek Farm is the home of cousins Howel and Sarah Lewis.]

    
## Dec. 28-31

   I am too poorly for church. Go to Clover Fields. Find Miss J.T. Gardner and Mary Walker there. Quite a dinner party on Tuesday. The good folks from Kinloch, Mr. Geiger and ourselves spend the night at Castalia. The last day of the old year. Spend it at Music Hall. Well another year has rolled over my head and I feel so thankful to be able to say that no changes have occurred that have caused me real sorrow. My many dear friends have all been spared to me and my days have rolled on serenely free from sorrow's tin alloy.

   - "What is a year? Tis but a turn
 - Of Time's old wagon wheel.
 - Is but a page upon the book
 -  Which Death must shortly seal.
 - Tis but a step upon the road,
 - Which we must travel o'er.
 - A few more steps and we shall walk
 - Life's weary road no more!"
       
# 1857

   
## Jan. 1-3 

  The New Year 1857 is ushered in by a snow storm. Made a bad beginning, not ready for breakfast. Brother Jim absent. Quite a merry party of us at Music Hall. Miss V(allant), Lizzie and Bob Lewis, Sue and I besides Sister Mary and Cousin Lizzie Watson and the host of children. I had a call from all my darkies. Brother Jim and Cousin Thomas [Watson] get home on Saturday. A letter from Dr. Lea and one on business.

    
## Jan. 4-10

   Came up home on Sunday bringing Lizzie Dee with us and find all the good folks right glad to see us after an absence of four weeks. Sue and Lizzie commence a course of study comprising Moral Philosophy, Mathematics and French. Don't think I shall join them. My poor little dog Jack was shot today, Jan. 6, for killing sheep. I never thought I could love a dumb beast so much. Farewell friend Jack. The recollections of the many merry romps and pleasant walks we had together will long keep your memory green in my soul. I've almost decided never to have another pet. Get a pretty writing desk for Sue and myself. Read   "The Hills of the ... " aloud. Mary Lewis is home for Saturday and Sunday. Lucy Wood with us.

    
## Jan. 10-17

   Go to the Baptist Church and hear Mr. Summers....Go home with sister Betty after church to see Rose and Ellen Bankhead who are staying with her. Such a crowd of belles and beaux. Spend a very unprofitable Sunday. Call to see Mat [Leitch]. What a great change since I last say her. Poor child she is not long for this world. It makes me feel so sad to think that a few short months since she was all life and spirits and now so near her end. Get home on Monday, hear Sue has had a "serious call."  Get a sneaking guess who.  Having a quiet time with Lizzie reading, working etc. Hear Mr. Meade has sent in his resignation; says his health is too bad to have the care of such a large church. Some busybody has been at work, no doubt. I signed a petition presented by the ladies of his congregation to the vestry not to accept his resignation ....Bob Lewis with us Saturday . ...the ice on the river over 10 inches thick, skating very fashionable.

    
## Jan. 18-24

  A great snow storm. It continued over 36 hours. The snow much drifted. A ridge of snowy mountains on a small scale around three sides of the yard fences. Each of the drifts are higher than the fence. We are put out of our room by the snow which finds its way on through the ceiling. Bob did not get off until Saturday. Lizzie Dee still with us. The cars do not run for more than a week. Sue and I busy over Daddy's collars.

    
## Jan. 25-31

  Dear Mat [Leitch] has gone. She breathed her last on the 25th about 2 o'clock PM. How hard to see our  friends snatched away by death's hand but we mourn not  as without hope for she knows in whom she he giveth his beloved sleep.

  - The storm that wrecks the wintry sky
 - No more disturbs her deep repose
  Write to Brother Peter, also to Sally Williamson. A letter from Miss V telling Lizzie Dee there is no chance for her getting home as the track to Keswick is now broken so we may count on having our cousin Lizzie Dee with us for some time longer much to my joy. Cousin Skinner Minor to breakfast with us this morning. His mind is in a very wandering state. His friends intend taking him to Baltimore ....Get a mail on Thursday for the first time since the 17th. Feel great aggravation not having had any news for more than a week. Tom Maury's sentence, 70 years like the last two for our Southern honor, is a hard one. I heartily hope although his reputation may suffer that his calculations are inaccurate. Finish a revised and corrected edition of my Family Tree.

    
## Feb. 1-7

   Finish reading *The Priest, Puritan and Preacher* by Ryle. Like it much. Also Miss Rives new work *Home and the World*, which I consider very indifferent and [Anna Sophia] Stephens' *Mrs. Massies* in 1 vol with which I am both edified and amused. Lizzie Dee leaves us on Friday. We both feel very lonely without her . ....A letter from S P Williamson, also one from Betty Bankhead. Mary Lewis at home the last of the week. Hear Aunt Ria talks of visiting Virginia in the Spring. We will all give her a hearty welcome. Old Tammy Elpha, the horse, sleeps his last sleep. Some foggy mornings might imagine yourself in England.

    
## Feb. 8-14

   Roads too bad for church ....dull times. Wrote to Lizzie Dee and Dr. Lea. Still mud bound. Henry here Saturday.

    
## Feb 22-28.

  Go to my own church for the first time since Dec. 7th. Hear Mr. Meade...a beautiful sermon. How sad it made me feel to think we so soon must lose him. The warm weather seems to have set in for two flocks of wild geese pass on Sunday. Ash Wednesday the 25th Cousin Dabney Davis preached for us ....Call to see cousin Lou Leitch-a sad visit. How I missed Mat's ready smile and kind welcome. Cousin Lou seems gratified by our visit. Spring seems to have set in such earnestness some few bright crocus and violets have had their rashness to put forth their blossoms. I feel as if there will be a killing frost in store for them yet. Wrote to S P Williamson. Mary Lewis at home the last of the week. Ellen spends the night with us in the Lodge. Finish reading Walter Scott's *Critical and Miscellaneous Essays* in 3 vols. Pets met with a sad accident which I fear will be injurious to his beauty-had the tip of his tail wisked off-his back also much hurt. How unfortunate I am with my pets.

    
## March 1-7

   Spend this week in town. Hear Mr. Meade on Sunday morning ....Go at night to the Presbyterian Church and hear Mr. Wilson....Had "Longfellow" to escort me. We were so fortunate as to get a seat very near Miss Gibbs and had the benefit of her voice. My head suffers in consequence. Had some friends to call and paid some visits myself. Attended one of Miss Gibb's concerts at the Hall. She has a fine voice but not powerful enough for a public singer. She was aided by Messrs Fry and D'Alfonces. Mr. Fry is a splendid performer on the piano and Mr. D'Alfonce sang "The Marseillaise" with a great deal of feeling. Have several glimpses of Henry. Cousin John Martin also spends an evening with us. On Saturday I visit Sue at Dr. Leiches when we are expected to dinner. Spend the night at Mr. John Woods. Have a pleasant time. Joe Perkins "yarns" for our amusement about Lizzie Wood being a belle at Xmas. Charlie gives us the "grass hopper in the garden." The dear little flowers that a week ago were so bright have all been snapped by an untimely frost and are now languishing and low. A slight snow storm on Thursday. The largest flakes I ever saw but this is an age of wonders. A letter from Tom Davis. Poor fellow, he seems to have been badly dealt with lately-his letter was very unsatisfactory. A letter also from Miss Vallant. She says Aunt Sally's health is very poorly.

    
## March 8-14

   In the morning heard Mr Meade ....At night hear Mr. Smith. At Mr. Woods for dinner on Sunday. Spend the night at Dr. Leitch's. Sue and I get home on Monday. Find Pets much improved. I'm much afflicted with deafness but thanks to Mammy E's good dosing on Saturday my hearing is restored. Miss V up on Friday. We enjoy her company very much. She says Henry is in another "fit of the blues." I'm afraid he is passed hope as he has again left the University. Wrote to Betty Bankhead.

    
## March 15-21

   Hear Mr. Meade....Miss V leaves on Monday. Sue and I get independent and go visiting our neighbors by ourselves; Sue driving the buggy. My reading this week has been of a very miscellaneous character-History, Harpers [Magazine], poetry, etc. A letter from Sally Williamson. I'm much interested in the garden which begins to look quite spring like. Mary Lewis at home the last of the week and brings one of her school mates with her, Miss Artie Moon, from Mississippi.

    
## March 22-28

   Hear Mr. Meade [preach] ....Get the garden nearly "done up." Mrs. Macon sends me a fine supply of calacanthus, yellow jasmine and a root of white peony-great treasures all of them. Tom and Mary Walker Randolph spend Thursday and Friday with us. Little Jeff [their son] is a sweet little fellow. It almost puts one in the notion of getting married to see such an example of conjugal happiness as Mary Walker and Tom. They seem so devoted to each other. Brother Jim and Mr. [Francis K.] Nelson dine with us. Wrote to Aunt Ria and Tom Davis. Sue and I heard a joint communique from James Lewis. He says he is just about embarking upon the sea of matrimony. Gives us a bid to the wedding. I've given up the idea of visiting Missouri now as I hear Sally and her husband [Sally Watson Minor and Dr. Edward Lea] have left there. She was the attraction for me. My brothers, I think, might come to see me. Hear some very bad news about Sister Sue, [Susan H. Lewis Minor the wife of Louisa's brother, Peter Minor] that she is fast losing her mind. What an unfortunate family hers has been!

    
## March 29-April 4

   Hear Mr. William M. Nelson preach on influence. His text was "Am I my brother's keeper?" See Henry for a moment. He is much better, says his appetite is fine. Wrote to Miss V and Sally Williamson. Sue and I dine at Mrs. Macons. Have a nice visit. Mrs. Macon's garden makes me quite envious it is so nice. Cousin Mildred's advise to us is, if we can find one like her George to get married by all means. Sue and I get our Summer bonnets; white ... with a great many flowers. Finish reading Prior's *Goldsmith's Poems*. Very cold weather for the season-fear the fruit is all killed. A letter from Lizzie Dee. Sue, Jim and I am invited to a dancing party at Mr. Early's. Declined it as we have have neither dresses or inclination to accept. It is given to Mr. Tom Michie and his bride. Well we've lost another chance! Uncle Hatter thinks we did not pay him attention enough. I'm glad we are to have a neighbor but that she is a northerner!

    
## April 5-11

   Dr. Sparrow preaches for us on the liturgy ....Think such sermons are very edifying occasionally. Sue and I pay the party call at Mr. Early's, find the ladies very chatty. The rich Miss Fanny Michie was present. Find on our return we had missed a visit from two beaux, Messrs Adams and Coleman ....The fruit is certainly all killed but berries, perhaps. Mary Lewis gets home Thursday bringing Lizzie Wood and Sue Taylor with her. Sue T. is a real beauty. [On] Good Friday it rained hard all the morning so we could not get to church. In the evening Miss McPherson, Jane Taylor and the two Miss Moore's call. Miss Cora Moore remains until Saturday evening when the company all leave. Saturday Lizzie Wood, Sue and I go over to call on "Mrs. Bridal Michie." She has plenty to say. Expressed a great desire to be good neighbors with us ....Judging from her conversation I should suppose she intended introducing a number of reforms in the neighborhood-proposed a novel plan for keeping chickens from scratching the garden--vis chaining them to the trees in the woods.

    
## April 12-18

   Mr. Meade discourses on foreign missions, not very suitable for Easter Sunday, I thought. Easter Monday it snows hard all the morning. It seems a pity on the darkies' account, as it prevents the full enjoyment of their holiday. It clears off later and as Miss Taylor has sent us an invitation to spend the night at Midway and attend the proceedings at the University, we conclude to go and set off after sun down. We get there after supper is over; however, get some coffee and are in full time for the celebrations of the Jeff[erson] Society where we are escorted by Mr. John Robinson. Hear a very fine speech from a Fluvanna orator! The Declaration of Independence was badly  read, I thought. The music fine, only objected to the

 quantity. Saw a good many acquaintances. "Longfellow"  presented me with his badge, a chic cockade. On the way back, had what Mr. Robinson called a smash up. Nothing hurt but the carriage, horse and dresses ....Sue and I return home the next morning after a very pleasant time. Settle down very quietly after the Easter holidays. How sad to think of our last Easter party. What a separation there has been of friends! Sally and Mr. Pride in Alabama; Tom in Missouri, perhaps California; and dear Mat gone to her long home. "Friends meet but to part."  Hope we may one day all meet in that Home where parting is not know n !

    
## April 19-25

   A rainy Sunday so no church. Wrote to James Lewis. Finish reading a memoir of The Rev. Sydney Smith by his daughter, Lady Holland, in 2 vols. It is very entertaining. The Michies call ....A letter from Miss V. We think of going to that neighborhood next week to see Aunt Ria and Miss Betsy Catlett who is at Music Hall. Hear some sad accounts of the servants who were sent to Africa. Some ten or fifteen of their number are already dead. Mary Lewis at home, poorly.

    
## April 26-May 2

   Mr. Meade gives us a beautiful sermon on the shortness of life .....Go down to visit Music Hall and Castalia. Find Miss Betsey at the former place and Aunt Ria and Betty Hansborough at the last mentioned so we have quite a number of friends around us. Miss Betsey discourses about Orange and "the inhabitants thereof."  Aunt Ria is her own little self. We have some warm talks about Yankees. Aunt Sally has a sewing bee. We get through quite a number of shirts. Have an ice cream for dinner for being so industrious. Hear *John Halifax, [Gentleman*, by Dinah Mulock] read aloud.

    
## May 3-10

   No church the weather being much warmer. A real old fashioned rain. Nature is fast donning her Spring attire and in a few weeks summer will be upon us in all its glory. Get home on Wednesday accompanied by Aunt Ria. Find Daddy poorly. Our convocation commenced 6th but we do not get over until Thursday when I remain with Sister Betty as I find my friend, Sally Williamson, there. Have very select company: Cousin Fanny Hart, Cousin Fanny Meriwether, Edward Mead, Sally W. and I staying in the house. Lots of cousins and friends calling in at all hours. Plenty of beaux and some of them, Number One. Had a great deal of good preaching. Attended twice each day and on two occasions went to the sunrise prayer meetings, for which I think I deserve praise, as I prize my morning nap so highly .....

    
## May 11-16

   Mr. Brown [her brother-in-law, Andrew J. Brown] brings me home early Monday morning. Find Aunt Ria and Sue much disposed to sass me about being so anxious to stay over Sunday. On Tuesday evening, the 12th, at five minutes part 9 o'clock by Aunt Ria's watch, the little baby boy [Richard Warner Lewis Anderson, the son of Daddy and Mammy Eliza] made his appearance into "this vale of tears." A  name has not been found for him yet. Ellen says he is none of her kin folks but on a better acquaintance she seems much inclined to take the little fellow to her heart.

    
## May 17-23.

  A beautiful sermon from Mr. Norwood.... Sue and I were confirmed today by Bishop [William] Meade.

   - "High heaven that heard that solemn vow, 
 - That vow renewed shall daily hear, 
 - Till in life's latest hours, I bow, 
 - And bless in death a bond, so dear."
   Miss V and Lizzie call for a few moments on their way home and carry off Aunt Ria much to my regret. My pet cat, Juba, sleeps with her fathers. She died while I was away last week. Charlotte [Macon] spends a few days with us ....Mary Walker and Tom Randolph also dine with us. A letter from Sally Williamson. Call to see Rose Bankhead; she says she is such a belle.

    
## May 24-30

   Mr. William Nelson preached. Summer at last and along with it my nose cold. A sweet long letter from Brother Garret. [Louisa's brother Garrett Minor] I wrote to Lizzie Dee. Read *Old Mortality*. Lizzie Dee, Aunt Bia and Miss V come up on Friday to spend their Whitsunday holidays with us. Have a pleasant but quiet time. Some nice rambles in the woods for wildwood flowers. Aunt Ria takes a turn at "the fine arts;" imagines herself one of the "old masters." We call her "the gentle Paula"...at which she is highly indignant. We build a castle for the summer at the Rawley Springs.

    
## May 31-June 6

  Hear Mr Meade...on Infant Baptism. The Castilians have me on Tuesday. I write to Sally Williamson. Adeline's [a slave woman] little Ria died on Friday.

    
## June 7-13

  Hear Mr Meade ....Little Andrew Laurie is christened. [her sister Betty Brown's son]. I stand sponsor for him. A letter from brother Peter. Hear brother Jim is very poorly. Sue and I have a table mania. Two new ones added to our stock of furniture. Read *Quintin Dunward*, *The Vicar of Wakefield*, *The Black Dwarf*. Mary Lewis' School had a picnic at Mr. Robinsons. We are all invited. Sue and the little girls go, but [as] I had such a bad nose cold, I declined going. Had company at home to dinner, Cousins Lou and Isabella Leitch, Giny Poon and Sarah Leitch. I'm very poorly this week as my nose cold worse then it had ever been before.

    
## June 14-20

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach] ....Wrote to Brother Garret and Miss V. A letter from Lizzie Dee. She stirs Sue up on the cat question. An old friend to dine with us, Charlie Straws. Mr. Nelson is with him. Hear Jimmy Lewis from The Creek has gone to Iowa to see a little of the world. Henry takes his place at home. A letter from Tom Davis to Sue which brings news from Missouri. Brother Dick Anderson [Dr. Richard Anderson, brother of "Daddy," Meriwether L. Anderson] and Aunt Jane Meriwether are married-what a funny match. Tom has a niece. Cousin Howel makes us a visit. Aunt Ria with us again. She makes a gay sack of 18 cents [of] gingham. Uncle Sam [Aunt Ria's husband] is expected soon.

    
## June 21-27

  Hear Mr. Meade...on prayers. Henry comes to see us once more. He looks badly. Wednesday Sue, Aunt Ria and I take our departure for town. I go to stay with sister Betty. Aunt Ria, Miss V and Lizzie...are with me part of the time. I attended a commencement of the Baptist Female Institute at their Church. There was a long speech from a Rev. Mr. Jones which was a beauty as he used that word about 75 times in the course of an hour. His subject was "Woman, what she could be made by education."	  Then there was a concert, the performers being Mr. Dunn's scholars and fine music it was. I was much pleased with the whole proceedings, only objected to the place. The certificates or diplomas were given out to the young ladies in real University style. On the 26th attended the celebration of the Washington society at the University and heard a fine speech. Did not enjoy the talk as much as the...soda. Get acquainted with a new cousin, Charlie Minor from Hanover [County.) I .... Am very poorly towards the last of the week. Take to strong drink for my stomach's sake.

    
## June 28-July 4 

  Too sick to go to church. Do not get home until Monday evening. Take a turn for novels this week. Read three, Hawthorne's *Blithedale Romance*, *The Forest Rose*, and *Aubrey*. Wrote to Lizzie Dee. Had a letter from Betty Bankhead and answered it ....Harvest going on. The wheat very fine. Get all the tulips and hyacinths up, a full half bushel of each.

    
## July 5-11

  No church. Sister Mary and Brother Jim spend Wednesday night with us. They are driven in again the next night by stress of weather .... Mr. Hart also calls to escape the cloud. Hear Jimmy Davis is coming to the University next session. He has a great passion for curtailing cats of their fair proportions. Think I shall have Pets' ears and tails insured. Have my hopes much raised about visiting the Rawley Springs. Brother Jim thinks my health will be improved by a jaunt over the [Blue Ridge] mountains, but where is "the almightly dollar" to be found. Mammy E says we have nothing to wear. I would be quite willing to go without the dresses. Read *Castle Avon*. Also finish *Little Dorrit*. What a delightful book it is. I always feel in a better humour with myself and the rest of the world after reading one of Dicken's stories. A note from Lizzie Dee telling us Uncle Sam was expected on the 9th. Suppose he has now come and Aunt Ria is all "Nods and becks and wreathed smiles."

    
## July 12-18 

  Mr. Meade gives us an old sermon ....On Tuesday Aunt Ria, Uncle Sam, Miss Vallant, Aunt Sally and little Maggie arrived and the next day about dinner time Uncle Bob and that "lenghtened sweetness" Lizzie Dee drive up in "The Black Warrior." I have my first kiss from uncle Bob. We have a real jolly party. "The Myth Uncle Sam" is very English in his looks and rather reserved but very entertaining when drawn out. They all leave on Thursday, Aunt Sally and Uncle Bob for home and the rest of the party for the Springs while Sue and I, poor forlorn ones, are left behind. Still it's no use grieving but I'm much disappointed. Hear of the death of poor Mrs Taylor. How mysterious are the ways of Providence when a mother is taken and her children are left but He knowns all things well. Mary Lewis at home on Wednesday; suppose her school is over now for the session. On Saturday, Mary Lewis, Nannie and I attend Mrs. Taylor's burial at Monticello. A letter from James Lewis. He talks of visiting Virginia this summer; wishes me to recommend him to some Virginia ladies as Miss Ghose, his own, has slipped her bridle and left him in the lurch. A present from Aunt Ria of a set of gold buttons for our dresses.

    
## July 19-25

  Have cousin Dabney Davis to preach for us .... Cousin Howel and Little Charlie [Charles Warner Lewis] take dinner with us. Cousin Howel seems to have great hopes for the Iowa settler. Mr. Meade calls, such an unusual circumstance, concluded to make note of it. A letter from the Rawley Springs party .... They are pleased-have not yet exercised their powers of sanction to its fullnest extent as none of them have exceeded seven glassfuls a day. Sue, Ma and I attend old Uncle Sam Leitch's funeral on Thursday. The sermon was preached by Mr. Smith in the Baptist Church. ..His remains were then taken to the grave and buried with Masonic honors. He was above 90 years of age. Wrote to Miss Vallant. A large contribution to the Family Tree from cousin Minor Meriwether. He seems much interested in the work. A note from Cousin Fanny Hart who also offers to assist me in any way she can. Wrote to Brother Peter.

    
## July 20-Aug. 1

  Have Mr. C[leland K.] Nelson to preach today ....On our return from church find Miss Vallant at home. The Springs did not agree with her so she left the party and came to us ....She gives us all the news about the visitors at the Springs. Says those gorgeous tulips under the magic touch of the "Gentle Paula" are progressing rapidly. An affair of the heart on the prospect. Parties concerned two of my friends. What a funny world this is. Materials sufficient for another Vol of "Records of the Heart." Wrote to Lizzie Dee. Had a letter from Betty Bankhead. She tells me Georgiana [probably Georgiana Bankhead Moncure] has a son. Hear *Kenneth or the Rear Guard of the Grand Army* read aloud, a tale of stormy times.

    
## Aug. 2-8

  Had our new minister Mr. Butler to preach for us today. Quite a good sermon ....Hope he may make full proof of his mission and be a great comfort both to Mr Meade and his flock. A long letter from Tom Davis. Finish reading Sydney Smith's *Critical and Miscellaneous Writings* in 3 vols. A letter from Lizzie Dee with a stray leaf of wintergreen from The Rawley. Miss McPherson spends a few days with us. We find her very agreeable. Ma, Sue and I have an invite to Sue Watson's wedding on the 11th and as we ( that is Sue and I) thank of accepting we are very busy getting ready. Make a new dress for the occasion which is very pretty and wedding like. Cousin Sarah Gilmer, Juliet and Sally Minor are with us for a day and night. Cousin Sarah is a charming old lady. The young ladies are very amusing. Saw Walker Gilmer on Sunday. He told me all about my brothers Garret and Peter-seems to know them well.

    
## Aug. 9-15

  Go down early in the morning to Uncle Bob's --find him very poorly -confined to his bed. Attend church at the Cathedral. Hear a sermon from the Bible agent, Mr. Lyon....After church go to Music Hall. Brother Jim is very poorly. He starts on Monday for the Springs. Sister Mary and the children go to the Green Springs [Sister Mary's family lived there] to be taken care of while he is away. Hope they will all be back in a week or so. Brother Jim leaves me to report the progress of things at home. I feel of great importance. A "leap in the dark" in consequence of eating too much of Aunt Sally's sausage for supper. Hear cousin Jim Missouri has arrived in Virginia. Our curiosity is on tip toes to see him. On the 11th attend Sue Watson's wedding at Clarksville-had a nice time. Col. Harris [a Mississipian] is a fine looking man. He and Sue were a very handsome couple. The entertainment was some up town; the yard beautifully illuminated with colored lamps. For prominading lots of moonlight sentiment and soft illusions-nonsense talked. Cousin Jim got to Uncle Bob's in time to go to the wedding with us. We are much pleased with him. He calls us scamps and a great many other pet names. Treats us in a very cousiny manner. Lizzie Dee and Aunt Ria get home on Wednesday much improved in health and looks. They have much to relate to us of their adventure by "flood and field." Aunt Ria, Aunt Sally and Miss V start for New York on Monday next. We must look out for the Castilians as Aunt Sally is going to New York. Sister Betty, Mr. Brown and all the children are here so we have a houseful. We think the "wigs are bothered" not a little. A happy termination to the long joke. Hope. I shall hear no more of it, for I'm heartily sick of such stuff and nonsense. Letter to Brother Jim and Mary Lewis. Fear the servants at Music Hall are behaving very ill. Feel ready to write and tell brother Jim and come home. Aunt Ria and I have a ride on horseback before breakfast which knocks me up for the day.

    
## Aug. 16-22

  Too hot for church. Call to see Mary Walker and her little girl which is now over two weeks old. She is called Margaret Douglas. Aunt Sally, Aunt Ria and Miss Vallant start on Monday for New York. We will miss them all much. Aunt Sally gave us a great many charges before leaving-such as taking care of Uncle Bob, the children, chickens and cats. This latter are left especially to my care. As we keep the keys while she is absent we expect to live like Queen Vic and the bill of fare for the next two weeks will be equal to The St. Nicholas unless perhaps too many cooks may spoil the broth and our goodies turn out badly. I'm sorry Aunt Ria has gone from among us for I feel much attached to her. What a pity that she cannot live near to us. Spend two days at Kinloch. Have a merry time-the house full of company. Quite a number of their Yankee friends. Met [David Meriwether Anderson] is very homesick until he gets back to Uncle Bobs. Johnny laughs at him very much for crying after Lizzie Dee and Tommy [Lewis, Uncle Bob's children.]. Cousin Tom takes me on a nice long ride on horseback. We go through the Tarleton Wood [named for the British colonel, Banastre Tarleton, who raided Albemarle County in 1781.] We had dinner at the Creek on Thursday. Find Cousin Sarah in bed but in fine spirits. Molly and Mr. Fry [Mary Carr Lewis and John J. Fry, Cousin Sarah Lewis' daughter and son-in-law] are with her. They leave for their home in the far west on Saturday 22nd. A letter from brother Jim. He thinks his health has improved. The Dr. says he ought to stay longer. He talks of sending for Sister Mary and little Dick. Things are improving at Music Hall. The little riots have been quelled without any difficulty. The servants insist that I will not go home until their master or mistress return, as they must have someone to look up to. I wrote to Aunt Sally and brother Jim. Get a letter from Mary Lewis. She talks of joining us here very soon, also hear from Mammy E. Sally Pride, she tells me, has a daughter. Ma is very poorly. I feel as if I ought to go home. Finish reading *Hedley Vicars Life*. What a real hero he was. Lizzie Dee and I have a ride in "The Black Warrior" to Keswick. The weather cool and pleasant.

    
## Aug. 23-29

  Go to Grace Church and hear a sermon from Mr. Boyden but owing to my defective hearing, I'm not much edified. Mary Lewis and Jim get down in time for church. Mary Lewis remains with us. Jim returns after dinner taking Met with him. Poor little fellow, he wanted to see home and is animated very much. Mary Lewis brings us word Ma is better. They have known lots of company since we left home. Spend a day and night at Clover Fields.  Mary Walker seems to be uncommonly well considering all things. [She was dying of tuberculosis.] Cousin Peggy [Nelson] and I talk of kin folks. Mr. [Francis K.] Nelson is away. Also stay a day and night at cousin Fanny Hart's and such a merry party as we have. Miss Betsy Hart from Richmond and May Hart and our party included Lizzie Dee Lewis, E. Craven, Sue, Mary Lewis, John Sinclair, Robert Lewis, Hugh Nelson and I. It surely made me feel quite young to be with such a frolicing set. Bob takes his first lessons in flirting. Miss Betsy "puts him through." We walk home and on our way make the wedding call at Clarksville. -cousin Jane took us for a crowd of beggars,  such a rowdy look crew as we were with borrowed shoes, old cloaks and chicken bonnets. Brother Jim and his whole family get back on Wednesday. He is not as much improved as I had hoped for. Looks very feeble. Hope the full benefit of the water, is yet to be felt. Spent one day with them intending going over the next day bag and baggage but the rain prevented. "The night of terror." A mere matter of moon shine, however. Put up at Music Hall on Friday. Quiet happy times.

    
## Aug. 30-Sept. 5

  No church. Read Mrs. Scott's little book on Africa. Have William Terril to dine with us. Don't think age improves him. A visit from Uncle Tom; he discourses about the issues. Miss Walker is quite entertaining with her stories of bygone times. Some visiting this week. Go down to the Creek by especial invitation to meet cousin Jimmy on Monday evening. The next day Sept. lst was spent on Peter's Mountain. Oh for the pen of a ready writer to do justice to [the] glorious prospect that spread itself before my eyes but as I have none of that spark divine in my commonplace nature, do what I would, I could not inspire any muse to help in [writing] the thoughts that filled my heart. Truly there is beauty all around our paths. In the dim distance were pointed out to us two peaks clothed	in their azure blue and said to be the Peaks of Afton but I have my doubts as to whether they were the bona fide Afton Peaks. Our party consisted of Sue, Mary Lewis, Nanny and Julia Lewis, my niece Lizzie [Minor], Cousin Jimmy [from Missouri], Henry and Nicky Lewis and myself. We got back to the Creek about 5	o'clock in the evening and after getting some cold dinner go up to Music Hall to tea. Spend a day at cousin Fanny Meriwethers and am introduced to the two Miss Pegrams. At Clover Fields for another night. Quite an exhibition of babies. Cousin Jimmy accompanies us in our processionals. On getting back to Uncle Bobs Thursday morning we are much surprised to find the New York party returned. They got back the day before. Aunt Sally is much delighted with all she saw. She brings Sue and I a nice present and Miss Vallant does not forget us. We have lots to talk to Miss Vallant about. An invitation to tea at Uncle Bob's on Thursday night. I conclude to spend the night. Next evening have the Castalians to tea with us at Music Hall. Mr. Dabney spends the evening with us. Cousin Jimmy commits a great indiscretion-at least it seemed so to us Virginians. He; however, was repentent and we forgiving as we are first cousins. I think we Virginians are the oddest people with such notions of propriety. A letter from home. Ma is much better

    
## Sept. 6-12

  No church. Take a peep at Grandpa Douglas' [Parson William Douglas of Louisa County] library. What a collection of musty old volumes--some of them over two hundred years old. Bob Lewis is anxious to be librarian to them. Uncle Hatter arrives about eleven o'clock to take us home. Brings word cousin Ann Macmurdo and Prissie and their babies are at Pantops. Pack in double quick time and get home to dinner. Cousin Jimmy comes with us. Prissie is a good deal altered in her looks since her marriage but with the same warm heart. Her little boy is a sprightly little fellow. His name is Johnny. Cousin Ann is as charming as ever. We enjoyed seeing Cousin Sop [Cunningham Wardrop Macmurdo] as he made a short stay. Take Prissie and Cousin Jimmy to the University to see the picture. It is my first sight of it by daylight and though no judge of such things, to my dull fancy it was beautiful exceeding. Do a good deal of sewing this week as there is a chance for our going to The Fair. [The Agricultural Fair held in Richmond.] Cousin Ann has invited us and the old folks seem to encourage the idea. So me mean to be ready. Jimmy left us on Friday. Hope to see him again before he has to leave for Missouri.

    
## Sept. 13-19

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach] ....Spend a very pleasant week, sewing, talking, etc. Cousin Ann and Prissie leave on Saturday. A panic seizes the household about the Sick Maid. Read "Oliver." Wrote to Aunt Ria and Betty Bankhead. Cousin Fanny and Mr. Hart with us for a day. I forgot to note the death of Old Pam [one of the dogs]. He was gathered to his fathers while I was in the lower neighborhood. I'm glad he has gone for his great age, nearly 13 years, made him unable to enjoy life. Now Bruno is the last rose of summer. Both of his companions have forever gone.

    
## Sept. 20-26

  A beautiful sermon from Richard Davis from the text, "Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of Life."....Cousin Jim Trice spends a day and night with us, a very unexpected pleasure. He is getting to be such a stout old gentleman. He is very anxious to take Sue and I out to Clarksville with him. Says we must write him word when we are ready and he will come for us. I think it a very fair offer. Get the hyacinths and tulips put out. It is quite a job. Lizzie Dee comes Tuesday and spends the rest of the week with us; as a matter of course we enjoy her company, such kindred spirits as we are. Cousin Jimmy back again for a night. Hear he is thinking of going to the University this session. Hope he may do honor to the Lewis name. Cousin Howel and Henry to dine with us. Ma very poorly. Got lots of togs for the Fair, among them a nice silk dress which is pretty and genteel. How I will have to stitch, stitch, stitch with fingers weary and worn to get ready in time.

    
## Sept. 27-Oct. 3

  Hear Mr. Butier [preach] ....A letter from Miss Vallant, Betty Bankhead and Tom Davis. The latter has made another move and is now living in St. Joe [St. Joseph, MO] clerking for his Uncle William. Seems as much in love as ever with "somebody." Betty B[ankhead] tells me Rose is to be married very soon but does not give us the name of the happy man; presume it is Mr. Richard Winston. Ma spends this week in the lower neighborhood. Hope the change may benefit her health. Cousin Jimmy on the carpet again. He has come to say goodbye for he leaves for Missouri next week having decided or rather had it decided for him that he shall not remain at the University. I'm glad we have seen each other and hope we may meet again at some not very distant day and that his impressions of Virginia and his kin have been favorable ones. Make lots of pickles, both sweet and Mexican. Dress a doll for cousin Lou. Sue, Mammy E and I go visiting. Call to see Mrs. Barker and her daughter, but find them out. We then call to see Mrs. Massie and find her very agreeable. Wrote to Miss Vallant. Trim the fall bonnet.

    
## Oct. 4-10 

  Hear Mr. Mead in the morning ....A sermon from Mr. Latane in the evening on Christian Charity...Go at night with Lizzie Dee, Sue and Cousin Jimmy to hear Mr. Broaddus [preach] .... We are well repaid. I stay with Sister Betty until Thursday. Cousin Jimmy is also her guest until Thursday morning when he bids us all farewell; takes Sue, Lizzie and I away in his lockets. He also leaves us his picture. On Monday I stay at Dr. Leitch's while Sue is shopping up. Cousin Lou invites Jimmy to take tea with us and we have a pleasant time. How much it reminds me of bygone hours, of the many, many, happy evenings I've spent in that same parlor with dear Mat.

  "And where'ere I turn my eye Back upon the days gone by Saddening thoughts of friends come over me Friends who closed their course before me."

  Mary Lewis comes to town this week to commence school. She has put up at Dr. Leitch's for the present. Will go to Midway as soon as it is thought there is no danger of fever. Read *Hansford*, Mr. Tucker's new work. A letter at last from my friend Sally Williamson. She makes many excuses for her long silence, none of which I think sufficient but she seems sorry for her neglect and begs me not to think anything of it. I intend to write soon and show a forgiving spirit. Much to our distress Ma is busy gathering apples. The cold weather will soon be upon us. The maple has already donned its bright red dress reminding us that the Mighty Painter is abroad and with a few waves of his magic pencil the emerald green of our forests will be changed to the thousand gorgeous dyes of autumn.

    
## Oct. 11-17

  Hear Mr. Butler [preach] ....Ma very poorly. Dr. Leitch is sent for; she is better by Saturday. I'm housekeeper, work I don't at all enjoy. A great deal of rain. Read *Miss Murray's Letters from the United States, Cuba and Canada* and find it very entertaining. Had a letter and the sweetest rosebud from Miss Detsey Catlett. Wrote a long letter to Sally Williamson. Brother Jim dines with us on Saturday. He is looking much better. Finish pickling. Put up about 28 gals.

    
## Oct. 18-24

  The service was very interesting this morning. The Service was read by Mr. Butler. Mr. Meade preached a beautiful sermon ....Mr. Latane was then admitted to Priest's Orders by Bishop Meade, a very impressing ceremony and one that I witnessed for the first time. The communion was also administered.

   - "I love thy church, 0 God 
 - Thy works before thee stand 
 - Dear as the apple of thine eye 
 - And graven on thy hands 
 - Beyond my highest joy 
 - I prize his heavenly ways 
 - The sweet communion, solemn vows 
 - And hymns of love and praise."
   Little Ellen quite poorly. Ma about again. A letter from Aunt Ria. She says the New Yorkers have a panic about broken banks. Think it has extended South for the gentlemen talk of nothing but bank suspension. They say such times were never known before. I wrote to Tom Davis. The children are all very poorly with kind of influenza which is traveling through the neighborhood. Cool weather. Ma sick again. Johnny [Macmurdo] gets up on Saturday to escort us down to Richmond. If Ma is not much better, I will not go.

    
## Oct. 25-31

  Hear a beautiful sermon from Mr. Butler.... Cousin Sarah Gilmer sends me a nice book, *Morning and Night Watches*. Little Dick has his first tooth. Such barking times as we are having with the bad colds. Ma is much better so we conclude to go on Monday 26th. Have a nice time going down. Meet Mr. B. Williams, an old Orange friend. Got down in time for dinner and are kindly received by the household. Find Mr. Pemberton there but am much disappointed when he tells us Prissie and Johnny Pem. are left at home; however, cousin Sop sends off for her in the evening and she is with us to breakfast on Wednesday morning; also Kate and Henry Eustace. Matrimony has made a decided change for the better in the latter. He charms me as a cousin, is much of a gentleman in his manners and is as kind as possible. Seems fond of his Minor relations and says some of his sunniest hours were spent in Albemarle. I'm introduced to his father, a pleasant old gentleman. Have a very bad cold the day after I get down but with the help of a mustard plaster and hot bath and keeping very closely in doors for a day on Wednesday I'm well enough to go to the fair. Visited the grounds again on Thursday and Friday and saw all that was to be seen. Some of the horses were very handsome, particularly Red Eye and Kosseth. The racing was exciting and seems the greatest attraction for both ladies and gentlemen. The display of needle work and fancy fixings were very small but some of the articles were exceedingly pretty and ingenious. Chickens were abundant from Shanghais as tall as a three years old child to the dearest little bantams not larger than pigeons. A great variety of ducks, geese and a pair of milk white turkeys. I had also a glimpse of a very sinister looking Buzzard feeding upon some kind of a fowl that looked and smells as if it might have been killed during the Dog Days. Two beautiful rabbits, a number of Guinea Pigs, White Bats, Pigeons and other small game were near neighbors. There was a great show of big potatoes, beets, onions and every variety of vegetables. Met with a great many friends on the Fair ground and many of them I have not seen for three or four years. The crowd of people was about the greatest sight I saw. Very cold damp weather. Have a merry time at Cousin Sops. Prissie and Mr. Pemberton, Kate and Henry Eustace, Bolling Picket and a part of the time, John Picket and May Bryce, beside Sue and I, making it great quarters. Mary, Molly, Betsy, Saidy, Gertie and Helen Macmurdo have also been with us. Hear several times from home. Ma is much better. Cousin Mildred and her big man George have made us a visit of a day and night, so Mammy E writes us. Betsy Hart calls to see us; she is the same smart little creature we all fell in love with last summer. Miss Hartley Graham and Mrs. Wirt Robinson also make us a call. Miss Hartley takes my fancy very much. I cannot help weaving a little web of romance about her. There must be some story of the heart connected with her life's history. On Saturday we went to the Mechanics Fair and what a treat it was. So many curiosities from foreign parts. A large collection of pictures, some of them very handsome and ingenious. One a picture of Washington crossing the Delaware on the memorable Dec. 25, 1776, and the blocks of ice were all formed of rock candy. Such a sweet picture. Then there was Hiawatha's wooing of Minnehaha Laughing Water, "handsomest of all the women in the land of handsome women." A great variety of fancy work, of leather, burrs, sheets and needle work of every description. I could fill a whole page and not have begun to list all of the strange, the passing strange sights that were before my eyes but I must not forget the American Eagle, a noble looking bird with his wings extended in real spread eagle style. Met with Cousin Peggie Nelson; quite a treat to see a familiar face among so many strange ones. On our return found Mr. Pemberton gone. See several of the Richmond beaux. They have such FFV [First Family of Virginia] names.

    
## Nov. 1-7

  Go in the morning to the Monument Church and hear Mr. Woodbridge [preach] ....In the afternoon a party of us walked over to Old St. John's [Episcopal] Church and hear a sermon from Mr. Kepler....Felt it a great privilege to be able to worship God in its hallowed walls. The sight of its grand old pulpit and sounding board and altogether its look of the olden times carried me back to the "days that tried mens souls" for it was here that the immortal [Patrick] Henry hurled forth his thunders against the tyranny of Britain declaring for "Liberty or Death." Around the old building and up to its very doorstep lie the sleeping dead. Some of the monuments date back a long way. Here repose some of the men and women who peopled all the city streets a hundred years ago, who filled the Church with faces meek a hundred years ago. It is a dear old spot and I was so gratified that I've been to see it. After the service was over we wondered about the yard looking at the monuments and reading the inscriptions until the day was far spent and we had a bright unshrouded moon to light us home. After tea attended services at St. Pauls [Episcopal Church] and had a sermon by Mr. Minnegarode....Called to see cousin Peggie, Charlotte and Mary B. Williams but found none of them at home. Go to see Barber's "Coyster" which is said to equal the "Greek Slave." We are invited by Messrs Kennon and Byrd to visit the Athenaeum to see [William J.] Hubard's new picture of Washington copied from the statue in the Capitol. It is said to be a very fine painting. I saw there a great collection of old pictures, books, etc. One of the most beautiful faces was reputed to be one of the beauties of Charles 2nd's Court. Then was also a very fine portrait of Pocahontas, another of Black Hawk and of all of Virginia's distinguished sons. The old books were a rare collection; some of them such treasures. I never spent a morning more to my satisfaction. Go at night to the African Church [First African Baptist Church] to hear a brass band. The performers [were] little darkies, the smallest not five year old. They were led by a white boy about nine. Go out to Hollywood [Cemetery] in the morning but start too late to see much. Go back to town in a hack with seven in and four out. Find Mr. Gus Haxall and lady at cousin Sops. We are all introduced to the wife. Go out teasing to Mr. Clarks and Mr. James Macmurdos. At Mr. C's have quite a dove party until late in the evening when some of the many brothers and cousins come in. The girls are much interesting in "Noobins." Sadie Macmurdo sings like a nightingale. At Mr. J. M's, quite a company of ladies and gentlemen; among the latter was the free and easy Mr. Willie Empie. Prissie leaves us on Wednesday. We are so sorry to give her up but duty calls and she ought to obey. Cousin Ann, Miss Rose, Sue, Kathleen and I take a ride in the horse car to Egglin's Garden late one evening and find ourselves benighted. Mr. E kindly offers to see us safely on the cars and we find our way back to Richmond sometime after the gas is lighted-quite an adventure for country girls. Saturday the weather was so warm I had to give up. Took a glass of porter and spent the day on the bed. After tea, Gertie Macmurdo and Mr. Mason come in; get quite well acquainted with Mr. Mason as we have many mutual friends. Good news from home. Ma is about again. Dick has two teeth. He is as forward as a cucumber. Had a letter from Miss Vallant. She writes in better spirits. Hope she is taking a right view of things at last.

    
## Nov. 8-14

  A very warm day. Go in the morning to St. James [Episcopal Church] and hear Mr. [Joshua] Peterkin ....After dinner go to the Catholic Church but get in just as the congregation was turning their faces homeward. At night go to St. Pauls [Episcopal Church] and hear Mr. Minnegerode on "visiting sins." What a fine sermon it was and not one in his congregation but what felt a home thrust. Gentlemen visitors all day. A bad arrangement for Sunday. Monday was spent in returning calls. Have a pleasant visit on Gambles Hill made to Mrs. George Kennon. She is very chatty. While there her brothers and their friend Mr. B. B. made their appearance. When we left they would not see us off although they knew it was disagreeable for the wind blew a perfect gale; very rude in them, I thought.  Call to see Miss Hartley. What a sour old maid she is. A large party of us take a ride in the omnibus to Rocketts [probably Rocketts landing.] On the way cousin Ann points out everything to be seen of any note; among the most noted is the Old State House on Main Street. Its glory has now departed and it would never be noticed by the side of the handsome structures all around it and its associations with the past alone gives it any interest. "In days long gone" it was honored by the visits of Washington, Jefferson, Lafayette, Madison, Henry and many other distinguished personages. Go to the glass blowers and see such beautiful specimens of birds, ships and flowers of glass. Walk out to Hollywood [Cemetery] on Wednesday evening. What a lovely spot it is! Death is robbed of many of its terrors when we see our last resting place looking so calm and beautiful. Some of the monuments were very handsome; too fine in my opinion. It seems a kind of mockery for can "flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death?"

   - 	"There is a calm for those that weep 
 - 	A rest for weary pilgrims found,
 - 	They softly lie and sweetly sleep 
 - 	Low in the graves."
   Go one evening to see Signor Blitz and his wonderful Canary Birds. The Signor did not afford me much amusement with his slight of hand tricks, but the birds and rabbits were something very wonderful even in this age of wonders. Walk out one evening to Gambles Hill to see the view which is very fine. Call at the Armory and see the big guns; also have a peep at Pratt's Castle. What a little gem it is! Walking back that evening by the moon's pale light I could not help in imagination peopling the castle with some of those stern old warriors of old clad in their suits of mail [sic]; of course some of the guns I had seem at The Armory guarded the battlements and in my fancy made it a complete Castle Dangerous. There was a "ladye fair and her squire of low degree" and all such stuff and nonsense as waking dreams are made of. Thursday before we leave call on Mrs. Wirt Robinson and Aunt Sophy. Find the former out. Have a nice long chat with Aunt Sophy about home and the darkies. Go down town to buy goodies for the little ones at home. Start back with six big bundles; are relieved by Mr. Willie Empie. He spends the rest of the day at cousin Sops. Sadie [Macmurdo] is also there. After night many of the other girls are also with us so we have a merry time dancing, talking, etc. So it is after 11 o'clock before the goodbyes are said. Friday very early Sue, Johnny, and I are off for "home, sweet home." Cousins Ann and Sop go with us as far as Ashland where we get a nice hot breakfast and are off again. Find the old folks at home well and right glad to see us. The Lodge has been nicely fixed up during our absence and the mice have taken possession. Ellen is charmed with her doll baby and the other children are much pleased with their Richmond presents. Hear of the death of William Page and Elisa Nelson. Truly as a flower of the field, we flourish then the wind passeth over it and it is gone. Mary Lewis is at home.

    
## Nov. 15-21 

  Johnny leaves us for home. Hear Mr. Slack [preach] . ...Find on my return from Richmond a letter from Jimmy postmarked 19th Oct. containing a piece of evergreen from Maggie. Quite a treasure. Also a letter from brother Garret announcing the birth of another daughter which he thinks of calling Mariola Garret. A long letter from S.P. Williamson this week. She gives me the news of Rose Bankhead's marriage to Mr. Winston last week. A letter from Jimmy after he got home. Miss Ghose is married to his brother John and Jimmy has concluded to "love her as a sister" as he could not as a wife. Tells us Thursday the 19th of this month is set as Tom's wedding day. Get things in order for work. Met has been introduced now to the spelling book and multiplication tables. Hope he may make great headway this winter. Very cold and blustering weather. It seems quite strange when we left home the last of Oct. all nature was clothed in its rich and varied dress and on our return the middle of Nov. to find all cheerless and barren and gray forlorn.

   - 	"November's sky is chill and drear 
 - 	 November's leaf is brown and sear."
   Sue and I go out making visits. Call to see Sue and Jim Taylor; also cousin Lou Leitch. Find Miss Virginia Sampson with her. She gives us a very laughable account of an adventure she had with the gas. Miss Vallant comes on Friday. We enjoy her company very much. Seems  in good spirits; gives us the latest news which was satisfactory ....

Sue and I go out to see Sue and Jane Taylor and also cousin Lou Leitch. Sue has a letter from Jimmy Lewis (NOT of the Creek) telling us his sister Emma and Tom Davis were married the 19th of November. Finish a second revised and corrected edition of my family tree. The paper on which the other one was made was too small to get down all the twigs, so I had to draw it off again on a larger sheet of paper. It is now ready to be lithographed when I get the where-with-all to do it with ....Times dull. Cousin Peggie and Mr. Nelson spend a night with us. Friday morning cousin Peggy invited us to ride to town with her. Sue and I go and dine with Cousin Lou Leitch. Have a pleasant time. Hear it reported that cousin George Meriwether has married another first cousin. If true this will be the third one and last two were sisters. [Inserted below] It was a mistake. A letter from Lizzie Dee, she and Miss Vallant talk of spending Xmas with us. Wrote to Jimmy Lewis. Mary Lewis and Miss McPherson [probably M.A. McPherson, a teacher at the Piedmont Female Institute] with us the last of the week. Daddy still in Richmond. On Saturday morning Miss McPherson, Jim and I take a jaunt on horseback to Thurmond's Mountain and indulge our eyes in a magnificent prospect. Find Tom Davis' name cut in a rock. I feel for the next day or two as if I was 80 years of age.

    
## Dec. 6-12 

  A rainy Sunday. Miss McPherson and Mary Lewis leave on Monday. Finish reading *Lee's Memoirs of the Wars*. Read also *The Old Homestead* by Mrs. [Anna Sophia] Stephens. A letter from brother Peter.

I have a novel introduction from my niece, Lily [Brown]. While in town I get acquaintd with Miss Betty Lewis [of the Piedmont Institute]. She is a sweet creature. I'm anxious to have some relationship between us.

    
## Dec. 13-19 

  Mr. Meade preaches from Matt 3:19. I come home after church and find Daddy has returned. He made his appearance very unexpectedly on Saturday. Mary Lewis at home sick. The hogs are killed this week; a pig tail feast for dinner. Hear of Ellen Gilmer's death. She died on Sunday morning about four o'clock. Her last end was peace. Wrote to Sally Lea, brother Peter, Betty Bankhead, Miss Betsey Catlett and Lizzie Dee. Get the Xmas Tree all ready-at least find it and get the articles all ready to be hung on. Saturday, Sue, Mammy E and I go over to call on Mrs Michie and are introduced to her sister Miss Budd; quite a pretty looking girl. We also call to see Cousin Lou Leitch. Sue has a letter from Ellen Macmurdo telling us she will be up on Thursday next. Kathleen [Macmurdo] has to stay at home and play darkie during the holidays.

    
## Dec. 20-26 

  Mr. Smith preached Ellen Gilmer's funeral sermon in our church this morning ....Cousin Howel with us. Miss Vallant gets up on Wednesday in time to mutter her incantation over the John Bull pudding for Xmas. I can't say whether she calls up spirits from the very deep but her spiel seems to aid the mixing. Mary Lewis' friends, Peggie Carr, Peggie Taylor and Sarah Leitch with Johnny Macmurdo, Sam and Nannie Leitch, Miss Vallant and we Pantopians make up our Xmas party. We were disappointed that Ellan Macmurdo could not come. Xmas Day it snowed forth until two o'clock. The tree came off at early candle light and it was very handsome. Ellen [Anderson] was in a perfect whirl of delight. Seemed not to know what to do with herself. At last got down on the floor and rolled. The old folks and children were much pleased with Santa Claus' offerings. Mine was a little brown jug filled with sweet breads. Sue, Miss Vallant and I decked off the parlor very prettily with greens in honor of the season. On Saturday, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Michie and her sister, Miss Budd, dined with us. We are soon to lose them as neighbors as Mr. Michie gives up the place the first of the new year. We join in a few Xmas games with the youngsters in the parlor but Miss Vallant, Sue and I take our real enjoyment up in the Lodge around a nice Xmas fire. A joint letter from Aunt Ria wishes us all a merry Xmas. A letter from Sally Williamson. She tells me they are going back to Woodville to live. Will move this week. Ellen Bankhead is to be married sometime in January to Mr. Merideth.

    
## Dec. 27-31, 1857 

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach a]...beautiful Xmas sermon. Johnny Macmurdo leaves today and the rest of the company by Tuesday except Miss Vallant. We have such great enjoyment reading, working, etc. Sorry Lizzie Dee could not be with us but she had company at home .... Well the old year is fast waning. In another hour (now 11 o'clock) it will be gone and forever. I'm looking back through the last 12 months, for I find it vastly wise to talk with my past hours and ask of them what report they give of me to Heaven. How much I feel and know has been done that should have been left undone and as much undone that should have been performed. Will another year find me better? With all my short comings, how much I've been blessed. Around me "death's hand" has been on many homes but my Household Gods have remained unshakened. I hope I have a thankful heart.

     
# 1858!!! 

   
## Jan. lst. 

  A beautiful day. Miss Vallant and I take a nice long walk. Am invited to Ellen Bankhead's wedding the 5th of January. Finish little Ellen a red cloak made a la Red Riding Hood. We intend taking the young lady out some with us this winter.

    
## Jan. 3-9 

  A sermon from Mr. Butler....Miss Vallant leaves us on Monday. I go as far as town with her. Have a peep at brother Jim and Lizzie. Call to see sister Betty who is poorly. Our maid, Kitty, goes out of office this week and Aunt Eliza takes her place. Don't we have scrubbing and brushing but a new broom sweeps clean. Read the lst vol of *Henry Mitour*, commence Gibbons' *Rome*, Read Longfellow's *Evangeline*, a beautiful example of patience. Sue and I call at the University to see Kate Whitehead and Lizzie Barton. Take dinner with Lotty Sinclair and bring Lizzie Dee home with us. A letter from Tom Davis.

    
## Jan. 10-16 

  Hear Mr. Boyden [preach] ....Stay in with sister Betty. Sunday night hear a sermon from Mr. Butler. On Wednesday I'm much frightened to find I've been exposed to measles. My maid Louisa has them and was in the house until they were fully out, we not knowing what was the matter. Well I can't go home until I see whether I'm going to have them for it would never do to give them to all those children so I must bear it with patience for I know I will be well taken care of if I am sick. A quiet but pleasant week. Sister Betty very unwell, I feel so uneasy about her. [Sister Betty was once again pregnant.] Have lots of notes from home. The good folks are all so sorry for me, it is indeed a hard trial to me but it must be all for the best. A letter from Aunt Ria. Saturday night I came near having the blues, one consequence of Lizzie not coming near me all the week, expect this was a slight mixture of homesickness and stress. Attend the burial of Mr. Meade's little baby, Betsy.

    
## Jan. 17-23

  A beautiful sermon from Mr. Meade....Mr. Butler at night gave us an ending to a sermon he preached some Sundays ago ....Go up to Dr. Leitch's to spend a few days. Cousin Lou and I have pleasant times together. We take a walk to Orange Dale and then make a number of calls. Have the Prussians to tea. Giny and I are much entertained. Decline going back to Mr. Browns this week as I hear the two youngest children have the measles and I have felt no symptoms as yet. Hope I may come off free and conclude with cousin Lou's invitation to finish out my quarantine at Dr. Leitch's. Monday if I'm still well has been fixed upon for me to go home.

    
## Jan. 24-31 

  Mr. Stack [preaches] in the morning ....At night a sermon from Mr. Butler....Daddy comes for me early Monday morning but Dr. Leitch thinks I had best stay a day or so longer. How disappointed I am. Mary Walker is at home and will stay for a week and to think I won't see her. Daddy has hardly left before I begin to feel badly. However, in the evening I feel well enough to go to the Town Hall to see a collection of Paintings. They are pretty but not very fine specimens. Tuesday morning in bed with measles. Remain there for a whole week. See a good deal of the old folks from home; the younger ones are forbidded to come near me. The disease makes me feel very sick but Dr. Leitch and Cousin Lou say they are not hurting me. What a kind heart cousin Isabella Leitch has; she comes to see me every day. Cousin Lou says I'm a great patient. She and the Doctor are as kind as possible to me. I don't think I could have chosen a better place to be sick away from home. No one could be better nursed and Mary Anne is such a good Mammy.

    
## Jan. 31-Feb. 6 

  I'm up this week. Brother Jim calls. He is very deaf. Suffer much with headaches and earaches from the measles which affect my hearing. Get down in the sitting room by Saturday. Found myself reading, sewing and entertaining callers. Bad news from home. Poor Bruno has met with an untimely fate; was killed by a tree falling upon him while with the servants in the mountains. He was a dear old dog and we will miss him much on our walks and romps. Poor Sue, I know her heart is heavy at the loss of her pet. Little Dick very sick and Dr. Leitch goes to see him and puts a blister on his back, a severe remedy for so young a child. Ellen is also sick.

    
## Feb. 7-13 

  Not able to attend church. Dine with Cousin Isabella this week. I'm still very poorly. Suffer much with my head. Have several visits from Charlotte who is staying in town. Friday, Daddy comes for me and although it is snowing we set off. Find the Pantopians right glad to see me and I feel so thankful to be among them once more. It seems regretful after all the kindness I've received from cousin Lou and her household to be so anxious to get away from them, but it was not because I was not fond of them but, "It's home, it's home I fain would be." Little Dick is much better though he has fallen off very much. While in town read the following books, *Life of Mr. Jackson*, *Boys at Home*, a child's book but very entertaining, *Rose Clark* by Fanny Fern and the following by C.B. Taylor: *May You Like It*, *Thankfulness*, *Earnestness*, *Anael's Song*, *Margaret or The Pearl*, *Record of a Good Man's Life*, *Mark Wilson*. Beautiful books all of them. I attend Ellen Adams marriage in the Episcopal Church on the 19th of Jan. The groom, Mr. Price, was my cousin. Had letters while away from S.P. Williamson, B. Bankhead, Lizzie Dee and Jimmy L. He sends me a tuft of Pluto's fuzz with a blue ribbon. Quite a fall of snow this week. Fear our chances for getting ice are bad. Oh, to think of the long, hot summer without any!

    
## Feb. 14-20 

  No church. Finish reading *Eliajah the Gishbit*. Sister Betty has another son born last night, Saturday, 13th. I'm puzzled about a name for the young man unless she goes back to the old Dutch ancester and calls him Doodes. Hear the marrying man [Louisa's cousin, Henry Lewis] is positively to be "off the carpet" next week. Sue, Mary Lewis, Jim and I have an invite to the affair at Glen Castle [the Creek Farm] on the 25th. Mary Lewis at home. Jim goes to Richmond on Friday to see the inauguration of the statue of Washington on the 22nd. Expect Richmond will be a gay place about that time. Sue and I had our invitation but declined as we made such a visitation in the Fall. Finish reading Hugh Miller's *Schools and Schoolmasters*. His style is simplicity itself. Wrote to Miss Vallant, S.P. Williamson and brother Peter.

    
## Feb. 21-27 

  A beautiful sermon from Dr. Sparrow from the text "How long halt ye between two opinions?" ....Hear a sermon on Wednesday from Mr. Butler. Have a look at my new nephew; can't say much for his beauty. Little Maggie Brown still very poorly. Read *Devils*. I'm charmed. Wrote to Aunt Ria and Jimmy Lewis. Miss Vallant and Lizzie Dee come up on Friday. They give us all the news of Henry's wedding. A find writing desk comes for Sue but where it comes from and who sent it is a nine days wonder. I get a fine supply of nice writing paper out of it as Sue takes pity upon us that have no such kind friends.

    
## Feb. 28-March 6 

  At church on Sunday and hear a part of a sermon from Mr. Meade but he had to give up before he finished on account of sickness. The weather very cold. Get the ice house filled from Col. [Thomas J.] Randolph's and Dr. [Charles D.] Everett's pond. A letter from Sally and Dr. Lea. They are much pleased with their house in Mississippi. Sally tells me her dog weighs 110 lbs and is very intelligent. Saturday, Mary Lewis comes home and brings Lydia Wood, Peggie Carr and Peggie Taylor and Mr. Jeff Taylor with her. They are prevented from returning in the evening by a snow storm. Stay until Sunday morning.

    
## March 7-13 

  We are disappointed in going to church as the carriage has to take the company home. Wrote to Lizzie Dee, Tom Davis, and Betty Bankhead. On Wednesday we have a sermon from Mr. Meade on Prayer ....Call to see sister Betty and Cousin Lou. Find little Maggie Brown much improved; she has been very sick since she had measles. See Mat Leitch's portrait at Dr. Leitch's. It is not a pleasant likeness of her ....On Saturday, Sue, Maggie and I go down to Music Hall. Find the roads very bad. We are four hours on the road. Find Sister Mary in bad spirits. She has lately lost her mother and her brother James. The children are all much grown. Dicky [Richard C. Minor] has donned the jacket and pants lately and as his Pa says, "looks not unlike a young Galihad." Miss Vallant is with us Saturday night.

    
## March 14-20 

  Go to Grace Church [and] hear Mr. Boyden....Lizzie Dee stays Sunday and Monday night with us. We have such nice times looking over old Grandfather Douglas's letters and papers, some of them nearly a hundred years old. Some of the almanacs are as old as 1760. Think a number of the letters are from my great uncle Charles Meriwether while attending lectures at the University in Edinburgh, Scotland, others to and from his daughter, Margaret Douglas, several from a Scotch cousin who writes badly and spells worse and some from a great many kins folk and friends which are grim specimens of the epistolary art. I have a letter from brother Peter. Hear they have a measles panic at home. The overseer has it so suppose it will spread. Dread to think of it but will try to bear in mind we are all in the hands of a true and just Providence and whatever he decrees must be right for he wishes all things well. At Uncle Bob's on Tuesday. Real Spring weather. The birds are singing merrily and the flowers blooming out never remembering that one swallow does not make a summer and that these bright spring days may soon be followed by a killing frost. But enough of this cackling. We should make the most of the sunny hours and recollect "sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." Go Friday evening to the Creek with Miss Vallant, Lizzie Dee and Sue. We are introduced to Henry's wife [Sarah Robinson Clegg Lewis]. She is quite a pretty looking girl. Seems much in love with Henry. The next evening in spite of rain we get back to Castalia escorted by Jimmy and Nicky [Lewis]. A letter from B. Bankhead. She is anxious for us to pay her a visit; report says she is soon to be married. A letter from my friend Sally W. She did not write in good spirits. Also one from Jimmy L; he seems to be hard at work.

    
## March 21-27 

  No church. Go in the morning to Music Hall. Miss Vallant and Lizzie Dee put up with us for the night. On Wednesday we get letters from home saying our presence is needed as there is so much sickness and on the next day Uncle Hatter arrives and takes us up in the evening. Find them all ailing. Jim sick in bed with measles. Sorry our visit was cut so short. Suppose it will be our last visit to the Old Music Hall house. It seems almost like sacrilege to touch its time honored walls. How many of our kindred now numbered with the dead have been sheltered beneath its venerable roof. What tales its old walls could give us of days long gone if they could only be possessed to be communicative. To think of the times when the old Grandmother, Peggie Douglas, [daughter of Parson William Douglas] came a bride to the place and then Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Sue [James Hunter and Susan Bacon Terrel] settled themselves at the Old Homestead and the numbers of nieces and nephews who have there found a home and friends. These are all gone. Many of them have been gathered to their long home, some scattered abroad while the old house remains a dumb witness of the past. The lst of May has been appointed to pull it down. I only hope there may be as much happiness in store for its members in the new house as was enjoyed in the old.

    
## March 28-April 3 

  Very good but twice told sermon from Mr. Meade. Read *The Little Pilgrim* and *The Giant Killer or The Battle That All Must Fight*. Books rather of the juvenile order but very interesting. Also Ryles' *Living or Dead*. On Wednesday have Mr. Wm. M. Nelson preach ....Cousin Ann Dotson and Isabella Leitch to dine with us. The last of the week, Sue and I go in to spend a few days with cousin Lou. I stay one night with Sister Betty. Have Betty Lewis to keep me company. The baby's name has not quite been agreed on; we think of Charles Augustine Lewis. Miss Betty L. has the naming of him. Preaching going on in our church. On Thursday Mr. Nelson gave us an extravagant address suitable for the occasion [and again on] Saturday ....

    
## April 4-10

  Dr. Dabney Davis [preaches in the morning and] at night cousin Dabney again ....I attend prayer meetings on two occasions. Get home on Monday; find some of the children with all the symptoms of measles. The garden is looking lovely. Some of the house servants are down with measles. Poor little Dick is badly off without his Mammy. [His black Mammy was apparently one of those sick with measles.]	Wrote to Sally Lea and Sally Williamson.

    
## April 11-17 

  A sermon from Mr. Butler....A nice long letter from Tom Davis.  Mary Lewis at home expecting to have measles. Read *Judahs Lion*. Saturday 17th poor Jimmy [a slave woman] died today after an illness of 11 days. A letter from Aunt Ria, Miss Vallant and Lizzie. Had a letter from brother Garret, he called his youngest daughter Maria Louisa, the last name is after ME.

    
## April 18-24 

  Sue and Mary Lewis very poorly with measles. During the course of the week they are better but poor little Ellen is very ill. On the 20th and 21st she was so ill we almost felt as if there was no hope for her. Dr. Leitch is very kind and stays with her almost constantly. Cousin Isabella Leitch is also with us and nurses her so kindly. I consider her some of the salt of the earth.

    
## April 25-May 1 

  Had a snow storm in the morning. The mountains around are white for several days. Fear the flowers will suffer. On the 26th Ellen is pronounced better. Poor little thing, she has suffered much, had too large blisters. A letter from Miss Vallant telling us Aunt Sally has another daughter [Lydia Laurie Lewis] born April 17th. She says it is much like Uncle Bob. Miss Vallant also gives us the particulars of the late troubles at Castalia. [The reference is apparently to a minor slave insurrection.] How troubled Aunt Sally will be when she hears of it all. Cousin Ann Meriwether died today, the 26th. What a loss she will be to her family but I feel most for Charlotte. Wrote Lizzie Dee and Jimmy Lewis and Brother Peter. Read Charles Reade's new novel *Jack of Al1 Trades*. Very indifferent. Also Leyk Richmond's *Letters and Comments*. He must have been one of the pure in heart. Ellen still improving. Cousin Isabella leaves us today. Beautiful weather. The tulips are symphonies. The frost not so much injured as we feared.

    
## May 2-8 

  Mr. Wm. M. Nelson gives us one of his very fine sermons ....He is earnestness itself. There has been much interest shown for some time past in our church on the subject of religion and there has been much good preaching and prayer meetings every evening and people are beginning to consider seriously their latter end.

    
## May 9-15 

  Another old sermon from Mr. Edmonds. Bob Lewis comes home with us. We have a charming walk on the river bank after dinner. Aunt Sally has called her new baby after my mother, Lydia Laurie. I feel as if I could give her an extra share of my affection. On the l0th, Sue, Lizzie, Bob and Jim and I go to the University to hear Edward Everett make his speech on Washington. This is my second hearing and I would not object to a third. The interest is still high up in the church and the preaching continues. I might almost say the church added many members. Quite a number to be confirmed when the Bishop makes his annual visit. [On the] 12th Ellen takes her first ride. She is much reduced by her sickness. A letter from my friend, S.P. Williamson. I have a very bad cold, the commencement of my nose cold. On Saturday, the 15th, attend church. A sermon from Mr. Meade. Dinner with Sister Betty. See Brother Jim. He says things have got comfortably fixed in the kitchen. The old house has been pulled down. Brother Jim is very complaining.

    
## May 16-22 

  A rainy Sunday. On Wednesday finish a christening dress for little Dick. Read *Isafals*-it is perfectly charming. Miss Vallant comes up to spend the Whitsuntide holiday with us. Friday Miss McPherson, Sue Taylor and Mary Lewis dine with us. Beautiful weather but too cool for the season. I am very poorly.

    
## May 23-29 

  Lizzie calls for Miss Vallant on Monday. I'm sick in bed. Richard dyked out for the first time in short dresses. They are very becoming. Read a *Biography of Whitfield* by Belcher. An invite to Mr and Mrs. B.L. Winston's affair at Linley, their home in Hanover County, the lst of June. A visit from brother Jim. Wednesday 26th confirmations are adminstered to 41 persons, among the number Mary Lewis. She has early shown that "better part" and I trust she may so watch and pray that like Mary of old it can never be taken from her. I was unable to attend in consequence of sickness. Mary Lewis at home the rest of the week.

    
## May 30-June 5 

  A rainy Sunday ....The sun seems in a bad humor and frowns continually. Jimmy's [the slave woman who died earlier] little baby Catherine died on Saturday. It seemed a mercy that it was taken, little sufferer that it was. Read *Jackson on Baptism*. The last case of measles is now out making in all among blacks and whites, 32 cases. Wrote to Miss Vallant. Had a nice long letter from Dr. Lea. Sue, Jim, Nannie and I spend a day with Mary Walker. She is much improved by her trip South. Some visitors this week, Mrs Wood and cousin Lucy Maury. Saturday evening, Mary Lewis, Jeff and Peg Taylor walk over and make us a call.

    
## June 6-12 

  A sermon from Mr Meade. The church is in a shabby condition as one of the walls has been pulled down and the pulpit much reduced in size to make way for the addition. The breach in the wall is very roughly plastered up for present use. Mammy E, Sue, Maggie and I dine at Ridgway. Have such a pleasant day. Cousin Sarah [Gilmer] is such a dear old lady. Brother Jim and Sister Mary call in the new rockaway. The weather very warm. Write to Aunt Ria, Dr. Lea and S.P. Williamson. Uncle Bob and Cousin Howel spend the night with us. Wednesday we go to prayer meeting. They are so pleasant. I remain with Sister Betty for a few days and am poorly the whole time. I find a houseful of ladies visiting with Sister Betty. The weather very warm. Get acquainted with Miss Metcalf from Fredricksburg. She turns out to be a cousin. Also meet Mrs. Walker from the same place. She instructs us much talking about my Minor kin. Seems to have known the whole clan. Seems she knew my Father [Samuel Overton Minor who died in 1838] well as a young man and that he boarded with her when he first went to Fredricksburg to begin life. She had some old stories to tell of some of the Minors. Was of the opinion that they were "a peculiar people."

    
## June 13-19 

  Hear a sermon in the morning from Mr. Broaddus [and] at night hear cousin Dabney Davis. Monday, Sister Betty has invitation company. The Fredricksburg ladies, Mr and Mrs. George Garrett, Betty Lewis and Mr. Broaddus. I have a delightful evening. My cousin Metcalf is so agreeable; Mr. Broadus is also very pleasant. Betty Lewis spends the night with me. Get home early in the week. Kate Whitehead, Lizzie Benton and Lizzie Wood spend a day and night with us. The little New Yorker [probably Lizzie Benton] sings like a bird. I've lost none of my admiration for Kate. She is a little charmer. Sue goes back with them to Mr. Woods and I'm left a poor lorn creature. It is the first time for several years that I've stayed all night at home without Sue. Take Maggie into the Lodge to keep me company. Sue gets back on Friday evening. Mary Lewis with her and is sick. Ma stops cutting asparagus, much to my joy. She has made by it this season, $99. Read *She Stoops to Conauer*. Had a letter from my friend S.P. Williamson. Hear of the arrival in town of some of the Douglas kin. I'm afraid their glory has departed and the only honor now belonging to them is the name. Sue and I make some very fancy screens for our room and Ma's. Saturday Sue and I go over to spend the night in town as we want the children to come over tomorrow to see Dick baptized. I spend the night with Sister Betty. Bob Lewis takes care of us as Mr. Brown is away. Have a serenade.

    
## June 20-26 

  Dick is baptized on Sunday morning by Mr. Meade. Mary Lewis and I stand sponsors for him. He behaved pretty well. God grant that we may be faithful to our vows and when asked upon to give an account of our lives, we may be able to say we "have done what we could." A beautiful sermon in the morning from Mr. Butler. Sue, Mary Lewis and I dine at Cousin Betsey Masseys. Have a pleasant day. Cousin Betsey is a charming old lady and one of the few relics of a bygone age that is fast flying away. Cousin Lucy is a cheerful little body and seems to enjoy life. We find the Misses Bensons there. A letter from Lizzie Dee. A visit from Mr. Bass. We get a new supply of good books from him. Sue gives me a copy of Richard Valentan's Sermons. Miss Vallant comes up early on Saturday morning. She leaves for the north on Wednesday next. Read *English Hearts and English Hands*, also Miss Southworth's [Emma Dorothy Eliza Nevitte Southworth] *Lost Kisses*, a trashy affair but quite deep enough for such warm weather.

    
## June 27-July 3 

  Miss Vallant leaves early this morning. Harvest commences. The warmest weather I ever felt. Nelson, the servant, died in the harvest field from a sunstroke. Truly in the midst of life we are in death. On Sunday, Mr. Meade preaches. Three infants are baptized today. Read *Peruvians* by W.J. Coreybean. A very reasonable book but one that I'm rather suspicious of though it proposses to have been written for a good purpose. Friday Sue and I go to town to see the Military companies turn out for the 4th of July which is this year celebrated on the 3rd. We stay until after Sunday. I spend my time at Dr. Leitch's and Mr. Brown's. At the last place on Saturday I dine with quite a juvenile party as there were many children. Brother Jim was also there. A letter from my brother William [Woolfolk Minor of Missouri.] He sends me a picture of his youngest child and a fine looking fellow he is. Emma Bailey stays with us at Dr. Leitch's. We enjoy her company much. We are introduced to The Happy Family.

    
## July 4-11 

  Sister Betty's little Charles Warner was baptized today by Mr. Meade. I stand sponsor for him. Three godsons. My responsibilities are great but I've vowed and with God's help will endeaver to perform them. Wrote to Brother Garret, S.P. Williamson and Tom Davis. Camp Goodloe staying with Jim. Thursday, Sue and I start early for Music Hall. Get down in time for church as the convocation is going on. The new house is progressing very fast. It has five gables; I advise two more as then some romance might be connected with it being a "House with Seven Gables". We find very comfortable quarters in the kitchen. Hear some very good preaching. There is a prayer meeting every morning at 10 o'clock, then a sermon, generally a short address on one of the missions. [The preachers were] Mr. Dabney Davis, Mr. Latane (Acts 7:56), Mr. Meade, and Mr. Butler....See a good many of the neighbors. Call at Mr. Boydens and see all the preachers. The ladies are very agreeable. On Saturday Mr. Butler dines with us.  In the even have quite a salee on the porch.

    
## July 12-17 

  At Kinloch until Thursday. Find Mrs. Philip Nelson there. She is so pleasant. Some nice music in the evenings. She and her husband both sing well. Wednesday, Charlotte, Sue, Lizzie and I dine at cousin Fanny Meriwethers. Find Cousin Fanny Hart with her also the Misses Pegram and their fascinating brother William. Quite a band of music, piano, flute, and fiddle. Thursday stopping up at Uncle Bobs where we remain for the rest of the week. There is a prayer meeting in the house. Quite a number of the neighbors attend. Mr. F[rancis K.] Nelson conducts the meeting and Mr. B. Page gives us a beautiful extemperaneous prayer. Wrote home. Read a novel called *The English Orphans* by Miss Johns. Lottie Sinclair and her brother John are down for a day or two. We take a huckleberry hunt in the Lonesome. Aunt Sally thinks us very industrious until she finds out the tricks of the trade ....

    
## July 18-24 

  No church. Take tea at Music Hall; a dark walk back. Lizzie, Sue, Bob and I make a visit of a day and night to Clover Fields. Have the Misses Pegram to dine with us there. See Cousin Mary and Chiles Barker. They are but little changed in their looks. Bad news from home. Pets has disappeared very suddenly. I fear that he has gone forever. It will be a sad loss for me for I've set my affections on him. Wrote to Brother William and Mammy Eliza. Dine at the Creek. Find cousin Sarah [Lewis] much better. Saturday Lizzie and I have a real John Gilpin ride. Beat the northern brothers. A letter from Nannie, Mary Lewis, brother Peter and Miss Vallant. I record little Lydia Laurie's birth in the Bible at Uncle Bob's by young Bob's invitation. Pleasant weather. At Castalia the rest of this week.

    
## July 25-31 

  Hear Mr. Boyden [preach] ....At Music Hall again. On Monday evening have quite a company in the porch that's being their parlor at the Kitchen: Dr. [Charles] Meriwether, Mr. Fish [William Hunter] Meriwether, Lizzie, Bob and Alice Lewis, Mr. Slaughter, Cousins Thomas and David Watson. Wrote to Miss Vallant and Mary Lewis. Jim down this week. Says Daddy will certainly start for The Springs in a few days. Read *The History of a Pocket Prayer Book*, *The Woodcutter of Lebanon* and *Exiles of Lucretia*. Spend a night a Mr. K[eating] Nelson's; such a merry time. Lizzie and I call to see the Misses Boyden. Lelia give me such a pretty kitten, much like Pets, but [the kitten] struggles so hard I have to let it drop. Attend a Prayer meeting at Kinloch which is very interesting. We have Charlotte, Lizzie Dee and the Pegrams and Mr. Slaughter to spend the evening with us at Music Hall ....[On] Saturday 31st go with a party of 18 to Peter's Mountain. They are Mr. and Mrs. Billy Fish [William Hunter Meriwether], Charlotte Meriwether, Mary and Sally Pegram, Sue, Lizzie and I with Robert, Jimmy and Nicky Lewis, Hugh Nelson, Edward Mead, Fredrick Page, Mr. Slaughter, Mr. D. Nelson, Mr. Cooke, Mr. C. Page. We carried our dinner and had a gay time. In the evening a rain came up and we found shelter in the house of a Mr. Carver where we played games to wile away the time while until the storm was over. Fine fun watching Billy Fish and his young wife. How ridiculous they make themselves. Lizzie makes their picture which is recognized by us all. Some fine singers along and they give us some music that might have "created a soul under the ribs of Death." [On] Aug. 4th Sue and I get home from the lower neighborhood after a visit of four weeks but one day. Find Daddy at the Springs . ....No news of pets; fear I've seen the last of him. [On] Aug. 8th at sister Betty's; Mr. Brown is still away. Call to see Miss Lizzie Watson from Holly Springs. She gives me all the points about Sally and Dr. Lea. Witness Lotty Sanders' marriage on the 12th at the church. Get a new cat. He is much like my poor lost Pets. Call him Peck after a cat in a book. [On] Aug. 14th Lizzie Dee comes up to visit us.

    
## Aug. 17-21 

  Sue, Lizzie and I visit Ivy Creek. The first visit since Sally's [Sally Price Pride] marriage. We find few changes as the Woods are up at their country home for the summer and the Locust Hill family are exactly the same with the addition of Sally's little girl, Lucy, who is a sweet little creature. Sally is but little changed by being married. She is the same sincere sweet woman. Mr. Pride makes a very devoted husband and father. Make several new acquaintances, among them Cousin Martha Thomas and her daughter, Jane Lewis Perkins, Fanny Woods and Maggie Wood from Washington City ....Have some very well conducted charades. Maggie Wood and Lizzie Dee are chief movers in this. [On]

    
## Aug. 18th 

  Lizzie Dee leaves us ....A part of the time we spend with some very entertaining novels over which I muttered a few brassy words. Among them was *Dr. Antonio*, *Daisy Chain* and *Iris.* [On] Aug. 25th hear through a letter from Miss George Carr of the death of Willie Williamson [Sally Williamson's brother.] Suppose he breathed his last on Monday 23rd. His poor mother and sisters, how I feel for them. He was their sole stay and support. God's ways are indeed mysterious but we have his word that it is not in wrath he afflicts us. Mr. W's friends have such consolation in knowing that when he was called, he was found ready.

    
## Aug. 31-Sept. 1

  A visit from Sally, Mr Pride and little Lucy. Cousin Lucy Maury and Betty Price also are with us. We have a nice trip to Monticello. Mary Lewis and I in the carriage with Mr. Pride and Sally, and Sue and Jim on horseback. We, the carriage party, have three breakdowns. We are admitted to the house and shown some of the best rooms. The house and all around it are in a sadly dilapidated state. Surely the Southern Matrons ought now to get up a Monticello Association and rescue the house and grave of the Author of the Declaration of Independence from the hand of the spoiler. [On] Aug. 24th hear of the death of Brother Peter's youngest child, little Peter Carr. His spirit took its happy flight August 12, 1858 aged 1 year and 12 days. Sept. 2nd spent the day with Mrs. McGhee. She expects soon to leave the neighborhood as her farm is to be sold. Sorry to lose her as our neighbor. Sept. 4th Daddy gets home very unexpectedly [after a six weeks absence at the hot springs.] He is much improved in health and looks and is quite straight again ....

    
## Sept. 5-12

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach] ....Sue, Daddy, Jim and I go down in two buggies to Uncle Bob's to see Miss Vallant who has just returned from her summer trip north. While there she did some shopping for us which we find to our satisfaction. Aunt Ria sends Sue and I a pretty picture for The Lodge, some of her own work. Have a pleasant day with the Castilians. Mary Walker and Tom R. call one evening. Mary Walker looks so frail. A refreshing shower this week. It is much needed. Sept. 15th hear of the death of Cousin Jim Trice. He died on the 9th in New Orleans of yellow fever. Dear Cousin Jim, some of the happiest of my sunny childhood hours are associated with him, the memory of which will ever be bright. Sept. 17th Miss Vallant, Robert [Lewis] and little Maggie come up in the Black Warrior and spend Saturday and Sunday with us. Pay Miss Vallant back for the New York purchases.

    
## Sept. 19-25 

  Lizzie Dee comes up to town today to start to school again. She has a strong resolution to turn on again after having acted the young lady for more than a year .... The crocus so bright and pretty. It seems almost a mockery of the season with their bright yellow flowers while all around them the leaves turn.

    
## Sept. 27-Oct. 2 

  Ma, Maggie and Nannie in the lower neighborhood. We miss them much.

    
## Oct. 7-8 

  A visit from Cousin Sarah Gilmer. I wish I could see more of her. She is such a truly good woman and her kind Christian spirit shows through in her every action and sentiment so that it is really refreshing to be with her.

    
## Oct. 14th 

  My dog Dirk sent away for making his exit through the dining room window. I can but wonder what will be the fate of the poor wanderer now.

    
## Oct. 23rd 

  Phil Haxall, one of the friends of our youth, spends Saturday night and	Sunday with us. He

 is now at the University and has changed much from the little boy we used to be so free	with. Sue and I make a jar of Pepper Pickles. Our hands suffer in consequence; in a perfect agony until late at night.

    
## Oct. 31-Nov. 3 

  With sister Betty. See my little Cousin Lou Waller. Make a number of visits.

    
## Nov. 1-10 

  John Macmurdo up with us. Phil over again for several days. We have a houseful of company. Aunt Sally, Miss Vallant, Maggie and Little Lydia come up to stay a night, Nov. 4th, but the bad weather kept them until the following Wednesday with the exception of Sunday night which Aunt Sally and Maggie spend with her other relations. Lydia [Aunt Sally Lewis' youngest child] and Miss Vallant are left to our charge. Robert and Lizzie Dee over Saturday and Sunday so all together we have a merry time. Miss Rose sent me by Johnny a

 piece of Powhatan's pipe stem found at James Town, also some mosses from the old church tower at that place. They are precious relics and I prize them much.

    
## Nov. 25th 

  A letter from Mr. Buckner to Daddy telling of the death of brother Dick Anderson [Daddy, Meriwether L. Anderson's brother] which occurred on the 14th of this month. The disease was typhoid fever. He leaves behind a large number of sorrowing friends who will long feel his loss. That very memory is the finest eulogy he can have

    
## Nov. 26th 

  A letter from Tom Davis telling me he has a son and heir. Sends to us for a name-something pretty and appropriate. I'm nonplussed as family names have all run out. Suppose he will have to be content by a fancy thing that I shall propose, Claude or Thackeray.

    
## Nov. 28th 

  Get in the new church for the first time and have a very fine sermon both night and morning from Dr. Minnegerode. The Bishop is also present. He came to admit Mr. Butler to Priest's orders but some of the necessary papers not being forthcoming the ceremony had to be postponed till a more convenient season. The church is much improved and if not pretty is very comfortable and there is plenty of room and the spire is the handsomest in town.

    
## Dec. 2nd 

  Cousin Hugh Minor has been gathered to his fathers. He has long been a great sufferer but we trust he is now where the "weary are at rest."

    
## Dec. 18-19 

  Spent in town and attend some such delightful preachings. The ministers were Bishop Johns and Dr. Minnegerode. Mr. Butler was ordained Priest. The ordination service was preached by Dr. Minnegerode...and was very superior. He certainly pointed out very clearly Mr. Butler's duty. On Sunday night the Bishop confirmed ten persons. I put up at Sister Betty's house. My cousins, Lou Waller and Edgar Crutchfield with me most of the time. Got home Monday morning and commenced fixing for the Xmas jaunt. Such a confusion as the Lodge is in. 

    
## Dec. 22nd 

  Sue, Mary Lewis, Nannie and I go down to Castalia and find Aunt Sally and Miss Vallant busy about the Xmas preparations. Miss Vallant is very poorly.

    
## Dec. 23rd

  Call at Music Hall and take a look at the house; it is quite to my fancy. Sister Mary has two arrivals today, Cousin Lizzie Watson [Sister Mary's twin sister] and her tribe and some young ladies from Orange who are visiting Lizzie [Minor, Sister Mary's daughter.]	There are only sixteen children in the house at present so I intend to keep at a respectful distance until some of them leave. Lizzie Dee gets down today, also Bob, so we have a merry party.

    
## Dec. 24th

  Miss Fontaine and two Miss Bibbs from Charlottesville join our party. We amuse ourselves decorating the parlor with greens for Xmas. Bob insists that we shall have a mistletoe bough though he is the last one to take advantage of it. Xmas Eve we have a quiet time. The juveniles are all agog about Santa Claus. We are all visited during the night by that notable personage. Xmas Day roused early by all kinds of music ....Attend services at Grace Church and have a sermon from Mr. Boyden suitable for the season ....After Church Sue Stanford [Bacon], Mr. [James Terrel] Bacon and Miss Emily Griswold [a northern woman who is teaching the children at The Creek] go back to Uncle Bob's with us. Fall in love with Miss Griswold at first sight. Should like much to have her as a friend. I am well aware that such sudden friendships are dangerous trials and often end in pain to both parties but I think I could trust her. We pair off the first day of our meeting and are looked upon as lovers by the rest of the company. Xmas night have some very amusing charades. Miss Emily proves herself a fine actress.

    
## Dec. 26-31 

  Sunday, church in the morning. Have a sermon from Mr. Boyden. Sue Stanford has a bad headache so we have a select tea party in Miss Vallant's room. Mr. Bacon is a model husband. He adds to my curiosity shop a label from Sevastopol. We have some very pretty tableaux. The company all leave on Tuesday except the Pantopians. Tuesday night John Macmurdo and Jim get down. Suppose Johnny found it dull with only the old folks at home and I knew Jim was glad of an excuse to get with our Xmas party again. On Wednesday Sue Stanford and Miss Emily return. I enjoy her company so much. She is perfectly charming although she is from the north. We attend a party at Mr. Keating Nelsons. I enjoy it very much as I have my new found treasure by my side. We have such pleasant talks together. On our return have quite a scare in the waggon which prevents our returning so spend the night with Mrs. Nelson and don't we have a merry time, 9 in one room and 17 in the next. New Year Eve Miss Emily leaves us for The Creek. She wanted to watch out the old year all by herself. How sorry I am to see her depart. Hope; however, we may spend tomorrow night together. After she leaves I commence a letter to my friend Sally Williamson which kept me up until after 12 o'clock and I hear the old year go walking out.

      
# 1859

   
## Jan. 1

  1859 is ushered in with tears. How many thoughts present themselves when looking over the last twelve months. What has the Recording Angel written of me in his--book of -deeds. It is a saddening though--to remember for how many evil deeds and sullen words I will have to given an account. At Music Hall my first night in the new house and Emily is with me. The New Year has made us fast friends. What a cozy chat we had together that night over the fire. We both felt better acquainted before retiring for the night.

    
## Jan. 2-8 

  Sue and I stopping up at Music Hall this week. Brother Jim, Dicky, William [brother Jim's sons] and I spend a few days in Orange. I'm truly delighted to be among my old friends again. Meet with a very warm welcome. Divide my time between Mrs. Catlett, Miss Betsy and my friend, Sally Williamson ....We had a long talk of bygone hours. She tells me of their late afflictions, how much she suffered and how hard it was not to rebel but I feel that she has come out unscathed from the fiery furnace. It is a great privilege to be with those who can suffer and be strong as it shows me the power of religion over our human passions. Sally has a comfortable little home and she seemed so pleased to have me with her. See a good many of my old friends. The place is little changed since I last visited there. Mrs. Catlett is beginning to get very feeble. Get back on Friday and go in the evening to the Creek. I'm taken right to Miss Emily's room where we have some joyous times. She tells me of her friends and home. We agree on church matters which is one bond between us. She is just my idea of what an Episcopalian ought to be

    
## Jan. 9-15 

  Walk to church and hear a sermon from Mr. Boyden. In the evening have church in the parlor. Nicky [Nicholas Hunter Lewis] conducts the meeting .... Cousin Howel and the neighbors around getting ice. At Music Hall the last of the week. On Saturday I go down to the Creek to bring up Emily to spend the day and night with me at Uncle Bobs. Have such pleasant company to dinner but who knows what a night may bring forth.

    
## Jan. 16-22 

  Miss Emily vey sick with cramps. Send off for brother Jim and in the evening as she gets worse, Dr. Meriwether is called in and he remains all night. Toward morning she is better but still quite sick. Monday was set for us to return home and Miss Vallant had intended to come with us as her health was too bad to allow her to attend to her school but Miss Emily was too sick for us all to leave so it was decided by the wise ones that as I could be of no use as a nurse, I must come home and bring the young ones and let Sue stay and take care of the sick. It is a hard trial to me to leave my friend sick but duty calls. I wish I knew which was right. Inclination certainly prompts me to stay but some one must come home and Sue will be of so much more use than I. I say farewell with a sad heart. Get home from the Depot in Uncle Hatter's waggon as the roads are too bad for the carriage. Find all glad to see us but I feel such a load on my spirits I can't shake it off. I lay it to leaving my friend in such a suffering condition and to Sue's being away for home is not home without her. It is so lonely in The Lodge, especially at night. Find quite an increase in the dog family. Jim has two new ones, Phil and a little puppy called Molly. Peck has grown and improved wonderfully. He still haunts The Lodge. Jan. 18th a letter from Sue to cheer me in my solitude. Miss Emily is better but still in bed . ...I commence my school and the 3rd vol of Gibbon. Saturday night quite late Robert and Mr. Slaughter come in to spend the night. Mr. Slaughter and I have a long chat about Oranges. I can give him the latest news, having been so lately to that land of happy memories. Bob brings me [a book] to read.

    
## Jan. 24th 

  Sue, Miss Vallant and Sue Bacon are with us. I meet them in the waggon which is the only means of getting about as the roads continue so very bad ....

    
## Jan. 30-Feb.6

  Bob spends Sunday with us. Sue Stanford sick in bed with a headache. Brother Jim dines with us. His family are in town but owing to the state of the roads they cannot get over. Sue reads *Gents* and *Imelda* aloud for the benefit of the household. I enjoy a second hearing of them very much. Make Lydia her first short dress. Miss Vallant improving both in health and spirits. Thy will be done. Feb 6. Go to church in the wagon. See the Xmas decorations for the first time. They are so pretty. Sue Stanford leaves us today to make Cousin Fanny Sheppard a visit. She will be back again soon ....Find Jimmy at home on our return from church. He brings me a letter from my friend, Emily. How happy it makes me.

    
## Feb. 11th 

  The news has just reached us of the sad fate of Old William and Mary College. It was destroyed by fire on the 8th. The 19th of this month would have been its 167th anniversary. To think of what treasures were consumed in its old library. It seems indeed as if all the landmarks of our past glory are being swept away and in a few short years we will have nothing to show of what we have been but passing away is written upon all.

    
## Feb. 21st 

  Sue Stanford and Miss Vallant leave us.  We shall miss them much having been together with exception of a few days time since Xmas. Miss Vallant was not improved as much as we hoped she would. Her spirits too are not good. The doctor is decidedly against her teaching now. I hope much she will not have to leave Virginia. She has been so long among us and seems so interested in our welfare that we would surely miss her from our circle.

    
## Feb. 23rd

  ...the Spring crocus showed their bright faces today for the first time. It makes me feel so glad and happy to see them again.

   - 	"They have sprung in joyous beauty 
 - 	 From the all was dead and dreary 
 - 	 They have brought their new born mirth.
   [There are no diary entries between February 23 and April 1, 1859.]

    
## April 1-4

  I'm much afflicted with one of the Egyptian Plagues. In bed for a few days

    
## April 6-10 

  Cousin Mildred and Charlotte with us, the first for three days but Charlotte stayed longer. It seemed "the light of all days" to have Charlotte with us again. We take such pleasant walks together.

    
## April 16-17 

  With Sister Betty. Take a walk out to the farm.

    
## April 20st 

  Sister Mary, brother Jim, Alice and my Niece Lizzie spend the night with us. Good news about Alice as she is to join the church on Easter Sunday.

    
## April 21-27

  Have my friend Emily with me. Her friendship has been a source of much happiness to me. I believed she understands me better and we have many thoughts in common than most of the people I know. She is the pattern of what a Christian ought to be, so self-denying and anxious to be about her Master's work. I feel that it is good for me to be with her and I consider it a privilege to be called her friend. We attend church together on Good Friday and Easter Sunday and have some nice chats ....Aunt Ria and Miss Vallant come up at the same time but they remain until May 9th. Aunt Ria is the same dear little person charming up all around her. We have some gay times walking, reading and sewing. Miss Vallant's health is much improved. I hope she may be able to come back to us next fall but she seems doubtful about it. 

    
## May 9-16 

  I'm in the lower neighborhood. Make a visit for the first time altogether for pleasure without Sue. Miss her very much; however, she and Mary Lewis come down for me in about a week to take me home. We have to say good bye to Miss Vallant as she leaves Virginia about the 18th for good. How sad it makes me feel to think we shall not see her good, happy face next fall. She will not be able to teach and her friends wish her to come to them at the north and rest. I hope she may be happy with them. She leaves behind her many warm friends who will always be glad to learn of her welfare. Have some such nice talks with Emily. What a comfort she is to me.

    
## May 30-June 7 

  Had visiting us Sam Anderson and his bride and Charlie Barker. Sam is an old acquaintance and has married a nice western girl. We get well acquainted with the whole party. Charlie is very lively and takes great interest in the flowers. He is quite an improvement on most of the western boys I'm sure. Matty [Anderson] is quite sick while with us. She had several chills and was confined to her bed for several days. June 2nd a call in the evening from Mr. Arrowsmith, Aunt Ria and Lizzie Dee. Take our farewell of Aunt Ria, she will leave on Monday next. "When shall we all meet again, Aunt Ria, Miss Vallant and the Southern party." We have enjoyed so many pleasures together and have been so much interested in the same things that it makes me feel sick at heart to think how widely separated we will now be.

    
## June 10-14 

  In town shopping. A visit from Bishop Meade [on Sunday the 12th.] A good many confirmed Sunday night hear the first sermon from Mr. Nelson since he became our pastor

    
## June 18-20 

  Have my last look at Emily for some time to come as she is to leave Virginia on Monday next for two months vacation; hope to meet at the end of that time in the lower neighborhood.

    
## June 28 

  The sewing machine arrives and Sue is the operator. Hope in time we will all learn.

    
## July 8 

  Cousin Lou and Isabella Leitch with Sarah and little Lewis are with us. The sewing machine is all the fashion. We have pleasant times working in the Lodge. Very cool weather for the season; sleep under two blankets. The 4th was such a cool day it seemed to freeze all the patriotism up in every one and from its quietness no one would have supposed it was out great national jubilee

    
## July 11 

  Commence my silk quilt

    
## July 23

  Daddy starts for the Hot Springs

    
## July 29 

  Rose Macmurdo comes up to make us a visit; remains nearly three weeks and during the time we have a crowd of company. Helen Macmurdo is with us for several days. She give us The Irish jig one night in The Lodge. While Dutchie is with us, we are invited to dine at Castle Hill. Oh what would I live in such a big house for and have to pay so much attention to what I say and where I point my hands and feet--so much form and ceremony. It is well for me that invitations to such formal dinner parties do not come often or I do not believe I could pass the ordeal with patience.

    
## Aug. 17-Sept.15

  In the lower neighborhood and have such charming times. Get acquainted with a cousin from the South, Bab Clampton. I'm so much pleased with her for she is so affectionate and nice and has proved herself such a true friend to my little sister Sally. The little daughter, Clara, was a nice little child. We found Cousin Sarah Gilmer in the neighborhood and saw a good deal of her. Kate Whitehead joins our party on the 29th of Sept. "Katie Darling" is in high favor with my young cousins of the male gender-indeed she is the pet of us all. She loses some of her sweetness by better acquaintance. Poor child, she is quite sick for a whole week and suffers much with her mouth. Bob is very smitten. I never saw my long cousin in love before. On Thursday, Aug. 25th Missouri Jim appears again among us. He only remained with us for a few days as he has come on to be married. His intended is a Miss Hackett of Louisa County and the ceremony is to come off on the 6th of Sept. His visit on the whole was unsatisfactory. I'm not very much pleased with the match but hope for the best. While he was with us, the fancy ball at The Creek came off. Kate and Sue were the two principal characters. It was a hastily arranged affair but we enjoy it much. Brother Jim's school opened while we were with him. The teacher [Samuel J. Coffman] seems a pleasant person. The little boys are all beginning Latin and it seemed hard work for them. The two Lizzies [Lizzie Dee Lewis and Lizzie Minor] also take a turn at the classics in the evening from Mr. Coffman. Sept. 7th.my friend Emily gets back much to my joy, ....Her health is much better and she looks really pretty. Her friend, Miss [Carolyn] Morrill, who is to teach at Ridgway, stops with her at the Creek for a few days. She seems a nice ladylike person but has much more of the yankee manerisms about her than Emily. She expresses herself much pleased with Virginia. The little darkies afford her much much amusement. Sept. 15th get home after a visit of four weeks. While away Daddy returned from the Springs much improved in health. Dick is talking so smartly.

    
## Sept. 17 

  A great fresh [overflow from heavy rains] in the river. We walk down to see it. What a grand sight. Such a mass of water--smoking and frothing its tumult and wrath in. It hastens along conflicting strong now striking and raging, as if a war waging.

    
## Sept. 18-19 

  Cousin Fielding [Thomas Fielding Lewis of Locust Hill] send me the long promised dog. He is a real baby dog and cries continually. I call him Bruno after our old pet. A visit from cousins Howel and Sarah. We have a cozy time. Cousin Sarah loses her carpet bag on her way from Ivy Creek and in it one of her best dresses. I began my school and have determined to put my heart more into the work. It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the to house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart.. I attend today the funeral of Miss Lizzie Pom. The sermon was preached by Dr. McGuffey....Truly it may be said of her, blessed are the dead who died in the Lord, that they may rest from their labors and their works do follow them.

    
## Oct. 2-8 

  Hear Bishop Payne discourse on African Missions. Oct. 3rd Ma makes her annual trip to Uncle Bob. She takes Nanny with her. Jim starts to school today to Bennett Taylor [who opened a classical and mathematical school in 1859.] Lizzie Dee and I resume our correspondence. Oct. 4th Bob Lewis leaves Virginia to a home and employment in the sunny south. How much I hope he may succeed for he is one of my pet cousins.

    
## Oct. 15 

  Sue, Mary Lewis and I go to Ridgway [the home of cousins Franklin and Lucy Minor where a girls school is being held] to see Miss Morrill. We are introduced to Miss Brown and Miss Gibbs. Don't find my cousin J[uliet Minor] very plesant .... she will not make a pleasant old maid. Spend the night with cousin Lou [Leitch] and have a nice time.

    
## Oct. 16-22 

  Mr. Meade preaches from ....Oct. 18th Mr. Nelson makes his first call; hope we shall get to know him well. Are much excited about the Harper's Ferry affair. The Goose Question [slave insurrection] being revived, I fear. Oct. 20th Cousin Fanny Shepherd with Fanny and Belle Beasley dine with us. Bella tells us about her life in Texas. She is a brave girl. Oct. 21st Lizzie Dee up with her bag of work to be put through by the 'chine. Miss McPherson and Betty Robertson come over Friday evening and stay until Sunday.

    
## Oct. 23-29

  A sermon from Dr. Sparrow.... While pickling, take fire, have a narrow escape but get off with a burnt hand and a third of my dress consumed. Such a treat in the evening, Jim brings me from the office a letter from Emily and Sally Williamson. The latter is teaching at The White Sulphur Springs and says she has a pleasant home and only one little girl to teach.

    
## Oct. 30-Nov. 5

  Mr. Meade [preached] ....Jim is sick in bed. Sam [Leitch] and Dr. Leitch with us. Hear of Sister Sue's [Sue H Lewis Minor wife of N. Peter Minor] death .... on the 14th of Oct. Death comes as a kind friend to her for she had long been a great sufferer but she is now in the enjoyment of that sleep which remains for the people of God. My poor brother  Peter has been sorely tried but I trust he feels that it is God's doing and therefore must be right. Nov, 2*,* 3 ,4, we are all in great trouble about Jim -- he is very ill. Dr. Leitch comes hurredly and brings Dr. Gooch with him. Dr. Gooch puts up with us until there is some change. Dr. Leitch spends most of his time here. Cousin Isabella also comes to us. She is always a friend in need. People are all so kind, so many have sent or come to inquire after Jim, among them Mr. Meade.  Friday the 4th a letter from Emily. We cannot get

 together today as we had planned. Jim was too sick so I wrote her word not to come today. A note also from Miss Carry Morrill proposing to defer her visit until we were all well. Sue and I have an invite to Mr. Brown's affair. Jim is thought to be better this morning--we hope for the best. **

    
## Nov. 5th

 -- My dear brother breathed his last, today, Saturday about 3 o'clock PM.**  His suffering during the short week of his sickness was very great but his end, thank God, was peace. When he felt the approach of Death, he accomplished a few words to us all separately and in language that seemed like inspiration. In passing through that "Dark Valley of the Shadow of Death" not a doubt of fear seemed to disturb him.  All was peace. Oh, how much we have to comfort us in knowing he has now found the joys of heaven and is one of the angel choir. Oh, that my last end may be like his! Poor Mammy Eliza, it is a bitter trial for her for Jim was such a darling with her but I trust she is resigned and the Comforter has not left her comfortless; indeed He has been with us all for it is in the dark hours of life that His soothing peace is felt.

    
## Nov. 6-12

  A beautiful day, Nov. 7th, when dear Jim's mortal remains were committed to Mother earth. How well the season accords with death; all was change and dreary. But Dear Jim's at rest and I will try and not think of him in that dark lonesome grave. It is a hard trial for us to go about our daily duties and feel one missing from our sides. Time only can help us heal and then we must keep in remembrance that this separation is only for a season, that we too seek a better country where we will meet those loved ones who have gone before. Kind friends come to us and give us all the comfort that earthly sympathy can but at such times we can but feel how frail are all the friendships of this world for although they may love us much, still in the dark hour of trial, and death comes into our homes they have no power to stay the foe. We must lean on a stronger arm and He has promised to be with us through the days ahead of affliction. The following lines were sent me by my friend of friends, Emily and I think them not in appropriate here.

   - "Over the River" 
 - "Over the River, they becken to me 
 -  Loved ones who've crossed to the other side 
 -  The gleam of their snowy robes I see 
 -  But their voices are lost in the dashing tide. 
 -  There's one with ringlets of sunny gold 
 -  And eyes the reflection of heaven's own blue 
 -  He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold 
 -  And the pale mist hid him from mortal view 
 -  We saw not the angels who met him there 
 -  The gates of the city we could not see. 
 -  Over the river, over the river, 
 -  My brother stands waiting to welcome me."
     
## Nov. 14 

  Cousin Lou comes to spend the rest of the week with us. She is a dear kind friend and one in whom I feel the greatest confidence. Little Lewis is quite sick while she is with us ....So much company. We did not know we had so many friends and well wishers. Dear Cousin Sarah Gilmer comes to tell us how much she feels for us all; she brings such a supply of nice books.

    
## Nov. 15

  Johnny Macmurdo up to see us. He was one of Jim's most intimate friends; the sight of him brings back our loss so freshly. Sam Leitch has been such a comfort to us in our late affliction; seems to consider it his duty to take dear Jim's place  to us as much as it is in his power. He is so gentle and affectionate, I feel much attached to him. He and I have always been good friends, but now there is a stronger bond between us. He loved Jim.

    
## Dec. 2-3 

  Lizzie Dee, Nicky [Lewis] and my darling Emily come up to spend Saturday and Sunday. What a treat it is to me to be with her again. We have much to talk about and my heart feels considerably lighter after seeing her. A long letter from brother Peter. He tells me of the death of cousin Peter Carr on the 18th of Nov. Dear cousin Peter, to think I shall no more see your kind face and hear your cheerful voice again. Oh, how heart rending to see so many of our friends snatched away by Death's hand but-it is the Lord's will and therefore must be right. He has told us, "What I do, thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter." Brother Peter tells me of the desolation of his home. Says he, cousin Laurie and Little Lewis  (his wife and his child) will now seek a new home far far distant. Their plans are not yet settled.

    
## Dec. 4-10 

  Sunday a rainy day so Emily and the rest cannot get off. We are also kept from church. The rain continues so long that on Wednesday they conclude to start off in it. The Marms think they cannot be away from their schools any longer. I'm sorry to see them start away in such bad weather but I know they do not feel satisfied to stay.

    
## Dec. 11-17 

  A very interesting discourse from Mr. Robert Nelson on the China Mission ....Mary Lewis and I call to see James L. Leitch and his bride. She is a young looking girl. Hope Cousin Isabella may like her: Take dinner with cousin Lou. Cousin Howel spends the night with us. We have some talk about Emily. A note from my niece Lizzie [Minor]. Friday evening I go over to spend the rest of the week with sister Betty and have a pleasant time. It has been so long since I had seen any of her family. Betty Lewis spends an evening with us. The children are all much grown. They give me a warm welcome. I hope much I may be able to exert a good influence on them as they all seem to feel such confidence in me.

    
## Dec. 18-25 

  A sermon from Mr. Meade....Come home after church and find all well. A letter from Emily, one of her dear sweet epistles that always give me pleasure. Receive a picture of Sally and Dr. Lea from Mississippi. To think of having a niece married!  I will soon have to sink down into the Spinster Aunt.  A note from Lizzie Dee.  Dec. 21st, Wednesday, Mr. Butler's wedding day.  Bright and Beautiful.  Happy the bride that the sun shines on. Write to Lizzie Minor.  Very quiet times.  Sue and Mary Lewis spend several days this week making goodies for Christmas.  I take things very quietly and as I can neither beat eggs or mince, they excuse me. Johnny has written that he will be up on Monday. It will be a sad time to us all and I wish much it was over. Sad memories will come thronging up and our winter shadow will be ever present at my side .

    
## Xmas Eve!

 How little we thought one short year ago, when this season returned it would find one of our members missing--a cleft mark in our home circle but I must not repine.   Think of that precious promise to those who sleep in Jesus, "Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty. They shall behold the lamb that is very far off." And my heart ought to be filled with thankfulness at the return of the season which my beloved church commemorates as the birth night of the Saviour of men "for unto us a saviour is born, unto us a son is given and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace." Sam is with us until Monday night.

    
## Christmas Day

 have a beautiful sermon from Mr. Meade suitable for the occasion. The church is beautifully decorated with greens. What a beautiful custom this is of dressing our churches for this season of rejoicing and then we have proofs of holy writ to sanction it. "The fir tree, the Box tree and the pine tree together to beautify the place of my Santuary." The mass was taken from the text, "Let us now go even unto Bethlehem."

    
## Dec. 26-31

  Johnny arrives on Monday. It makes us feel the worse for seeing him for he has been with us for several years past at this time which was always meant to be one of merry making and seeing him makes the recollections of my loss all the stronger. Write to Emily, Dr. Lea and Sally and to Miss Vallant. Johnny leaves on Friday. The weather is very cold.

   - 	The Old Year's gone! I look no more 
 - 	Upon its numbered days 
 - 	Nor spend again departed hours 
 - 	Whose shadow round me lays 
 - 	I'm older now and sadder 
 - 	Then I've ever been before 
 - 	And the shape of many a faded joy 
 - 	Comes freshly as of yore.
   -       And what, old year, I ask thee what
 -       They rolling months have borne
 -       From off the ebbing tides of life
 -       And left me here to mourne?
 -       What hast thou heavy friend of mine
 -       Stolen away from me
 -       And "laid within the silent grave
 -       Whose depths I cannot see?"
   -       All this and more -one year has brought,
 -       What will another bring?
 -       E'en while I pause the wirling wind
 -       A requiem doth sing.
 -       I'll mark it out the last day's gone
 -       The calendar thrown by
 -       For useless now, their work complete
 -       The daily records fie.

## Jan. 1-7

  New Years Day. Too cold for church so spend the day very comfortably at home reading, etc. Get the ice house filled this week... Making scrap books-quite the fashion ....The Lodge in consequence in great disorder. A present from Sam of a nice copy of Tennyson's *Idyls of The Kinq*. I enjoy it much. Finish reading *Dairy of a London Physician*. Such a collection of horrors. A sweet long letter from Emily. She tells me some news which makes me feel sick at heart but it ought not so to be. I must be brave. What would my little friend think of me if she knew with what feeling I received the intelligence of the near accomplishment of the dearest desire of her life. I ought to rejoice with her. She tells me my niece Lizzie [Minor] was baptized on Christmas Day and was admitted to the Lord's Table. Dear Lizzie, she is a young soldier of the cross but God's words tells us that those who seek him early shall find him ....

    
## Jan. 8-14 

  I did not go to church being not very well. I'm much interested with a book cousin Sarah Gilmer sent us to read, *Blount On the Articles and Saint Peter* ....[Letters written and received.]....I'm very poorly for several days in bed; have some medicine from Dr. Leitch which does me good. How good for nothing I'm getting to be-sick so often . ....[Visitors for dinner and overnight.]

    
## Jan. 15-21 

  Too poorly for church. Some nice reading at home. Monday the carriage arrives and we fix up and start off. Get down to Music Hall by sundown ....Charlotte [Nelson] is there and very soon Lizzie Dee steps in. It is so pleasant to be near her again and to have so many around me that I love so well. Emily and Lizzie stay Tuesday night with us. Emily and I have so much to talk about. She has almost entirely given up her plan of engaging in the African Mission. She meets with such opposition from friends but still desires to join the sisterhood in New York City. What a brave little woman she is. I return to The Creek with her on Wednesday to spend the day. Quite a miserable thing happened this morning. After we had both mounted Suzy, the Old lady concluded that both were too heavy so after one or two kicks she succeeded in throwing us both over her back onto the ground. Fortunately we are not hurt but much frightened. I find cousin Sarah quite poorly but she gives me a warm welcome. I stay with her until Emily is out of school. About dinner time I'm quite sick so it is impossible for me to turn out in the evening, so I conclude to remain until Friday when Emily's labors will be over for the week and she can return with me. Thursday Emily is quite sick so Nannie [Lewis] takes her place in the school room and Emily is put to bed. We have nice times being sick together. We have such pleasant chats about things that interest us. Read Miss Alice Cary's poems and she tells me about that singular personage .... Friday brings a letter from Bishop Payne to Emily giving her great encouragement to return with him in May to Liberia. He invites her to visit him in Alexandria in a week or so. I think her mind is made up now. She says she does not think she has any right not to harken to such a call. She has long desired and prayed that she might be the humble means in God's hands of distributing the bread of Life to the poor benighted heathen and now that an opportunity offers itself, she feels it her duty to accept. The dear little woman, she is well fitted for such work in mind and heart but I fear much her health will not bear up under such a climate and the hard work .... I feel certain that she would willingly give up many years of her earthly journey that the few remaining ones may be spent in her Master's cause. We stay Friday night at Uncle Bob's and have a nice evening. Little Lydia is so much grown and is so pretty and sweet. Young Bob has returned from the South heartily disgusted with the Southern life. He thinks he will be quite well satisfied to remain in old Virginia now. I fear the South has not done him any good judging from the way he talks but I hope and feel that there is too much good in Bob for him ever to be spoiled by his associations with the world ....Go back to brother Jim's Saturday evening. Mr. Coffman makes himself very entertaining by reading to us while we work. I have a nice long letter from Cousin Walker Miller [with]... the information required for that branch of the Lewis Tree. I will have to go to work now.

    
## Jan. 22-28 

  Attend service at Grace Church. Mr. Boyden is sick so we have lay readings. Brother Jim reads the sermon, which I think he does well. Emily's Christmas decorations still look very pretty though Cousin Julia's [Julia Lewis] letters are very crooked. Emily remains at Music Hall while we are at church as she is poorly. On our return she lays her plans before brother Jim and he both sympathizes with and aids her by lending her books that treat of the subject and offers to go with her to meet the Bishop in Alexandria as he too has business with him. [James Minor as executor of his uncle James Terrel's estate, had sent eighty-six freed servants to Liberia under the auspices of the American Colonizational Society.] Her mind and spirit both seem more at rest after talking with him and I feel so glad I witnessed it. Sue and I have a plan of going with them but after talking it over and taking a hard look decide it best to remain as we would stay such a short time it would not be worth the trouble and expense. Emily leaves on Sunday evening and Sue and I are alone for the first time since the evening we came down. Have quite an interesting conversation in the School Room with brother Jim and Mr. Coffman on Infant Baptism. Monday we stay very quietly at Music Hall, Sue and I making needlebooks. Tuesday we go over to Uncle Bob's to stay a day and night. Sister Mary comes there with us. We have a pleasant time talking, working etc. Lizzie Dee is engaged in her school all the morning but we have her company after dinner and at night. We get on a very interesting topic after we say goodnight to the old folks which keeps us up very late. Wednesday at Music Hall, again. Attend Prayer meeting at Kinloch in the evening. We are introduced to our new cousin, Charlotte Macon, [baby daughter of Mildred Nelson and George Macon] a very young lady .... Thursday Brother Jim, Sue and I look through an old box of letters that belonged to Uncle Nick Lewis. [Nicholas Lewis of The Farm b. 1728.].... Get some very valuable autographs: one of President Washington, of Meriwether Lewis and Thomas Jefferson. Quite a number of letters from my great Uncles Nicholas and Robert Lewis who went westward and a number of other kinfolks that I know nothing about. Charlotte spends the night with us and we have a cozy time. I call to see Emily. She seems better both in mind and body. Found quite a sick family at the Creek. Emily and I make arrangements for being together at the end of the week ....We spend the night and next day at Uncle Bob's where Lizzie Wood is putting up ....Lizzie is so full of life and spirits I almost envy her. She gives us some very sentlemental songs. Aunt Sally has a nice joke on us about the Custard and Romeo. Saturday morning the two Lizzies, Emily, Sue and I go back to Music Hall to spend the night. Bob is with us, also Mr. Coffman and after supper Jimmy Lewis [of The Creek] drops in so we have quite a company. Emily and I retire early and as brother Jim's says "after the old folks leave the young ones have gay times." I'm willing; enjoy myself much more with my friend all to myself. There is such a feeling of sadness mingled with the pleasure of being with her now for the thought of how soon I may be called upon to give her up, is always present with me. Sad news from town. Our beloved pastor has sent in his resignation and it has been accepted. It will be a hard task for his congregation for I know of no minister who is more beloved than Mr. Meade. There is much to attach him to our family for with the exception of me (I'm not certain about Sue) he has administered the ordinance of baptism to the whole family and has performed the last solemn rites for our beloved church over the graves of two of our loved ones. I will not feel quite satisfied to see anyone in his place but such feelings are wrong and I must call to mind that changes and troubles are our material heritage and sent to remind us that this world is not our home and we must not set our heart upon thoughts below. [Note at bottom of journal page ---"It was a mistake, he did not resign."]

    
## Jan. 29-Feb. 4 

  Attend Lay Reading at Grace Church. The sermon is read by Mr. William C. Rives and I enjoyed it much more than Mr. Boyden's preaching. Emily leaves me after church. Sue and I spend a day and night at Kinloch this week and have a pleasant visit ....Get back to Music Hall Tuesday morning. Find sister Mary busy getting ready for Lizzie's candy pull which she is to have in honor of her 15th birthday (the party is to come off on Friday and the birthday on 7th.) Cousin Fanny Hart [visits us and .... gives me a list for the Lewis Tree ....Thursday and Friday we spend helping Sister Mary about the party-have such times stirring the candy-have four different kinds. Sue and I help to get all things in readiness. Set the table, which is much adorned and prepare the meat supper and get everything in order to receive the guests. Then we take our departure for The Creek where we spend the night with Emily who declines attending the party as she expects to leave early in the morning for Alexandria. She and I do not feel in the mood for parties and company and so Sister Mary excuses us. I am very much hurt at the conduct of my cousin Bob Lewis. Hope; however, he will think better of it and make an apology which I consider due to brother Jim, sister Mary and myself. Have a nice time with my friend Emily. Poor thing, she has much to try her but faith upholds her in all trials and the words, "No cross, no crown," seem ever before her. Cousin Sarah is very nervous and very amusing. Emily and brother Jim get off early on Saturday morning. Sue and I get back to Music Hall before dinner and find the house full of party guests. We have our share of the party goodies ....

    
## Feb. 6-11 

  Feel too poorly for Church. Lizzie Dee stays with me. A comfortable chat together. Finish reading *Mary Lyon*. Sing hymns all the evening. Monday Sue and I have our Oyster Party. Cousin Howel, Jimmy [Lewis] and Lizzie Dee are the only people who accept our invitation. Uncle Bob and Aunt Sally thought it too cold to come out. Brother Jim and Emily do not get home today as we expected. The Bishop must have disappointed them. However, the next day brings them back to us. Brother Jim gives me all the particulars of the trip. He thinks Bishop Payne's impression of Emily was a favorable one. Emily spends Wednesday night with me. She gives me all the points of her trips to Alexandria. How kindly she was interviewed by Mr. J. Wilson Gordon and what funny questions the Bishop asked. Dear little woman, she will go now if the Board of Missions in New York [of the Episcopal Church] will accept her and not in May as she first thought but in April; however, in either case she would leave Virginia the first of March. I must hope she will go for her heart is set on it. It is a sad time for me, for I feel in all probability I'm with her for the last time during this our earthly pilgraimage but there comes the comforting thought that me may hope for a meeting in that House of Many Mansions when there will be no more parting. We both think it best if she should be permitted to go that she should not come to say goodbye as it would only give us pain so we agree not to take leave of each other. Oh, how sad my heart feels, but I must not give way to my feelings ....A letter from a little niece in Missouri, Lizzie Minor, [and other letters.]....Old Suzy sleeps her last sleep. She died on Thursday night after a short illness. I had the last ride on her. Friday we get home ....Home seems quite sweet after an absence of nearly four weeks. Cousin Lou and the children have been stopping up here for several days past ....Jimmy Lewis comes up on the cars with us and stays Friday night with us. He seems much afraid he frightened me the last night we were at Music Hall. I must confess I was much frightened but did not choose to let him know how much. Saturday Sue and I go over to town shopping. Have a cold time.

    
## Feb. 12-18 

  Emily's 22nd birthday. I hear she has put on the spectacles. I do not go to church, am very poorly again. Indulge in some novel reading, *Love Me Little, Love Me Long* and some others .....[Guests to dinner.]....[A letter] from Emily. It is very comforting. Nothing can be decided about her going until the 29th of this month. Get hard to work in my school ....

    
## Feb. 19-25 

  No church-such a long day. Met gives me so much trouble with his lessons I administer the rod for the first time. It was very hard to bring myself to do it, but I felt as if I was neglecting a duty not to punish him. Hope I will not have to do it often for it upset me for the rest of the day. A visit from Dr. Leitch, he puts me on Cod Liver Oil and Iron. Ash Wednesday, Feb. 22nd it rains [so] hard all the morning that we could not get to church. Wrote a long letter to Emily. [Friends call and letters written] ....

    
## Feb. 26-March 2 

  At my own church for the first time since Xmas Day. A sermon from Cousin Dabney Davis . ....See Sister Betty; she says they will not move before sometime next month. Ma very poorly. Jimmy Lewis calls and brings me news of Emily. Don't know whether I ought to consider it good news. Her mother and uncle have positively forbidden her going out to Africa as a missionary. I feel so anxious to hear from the little woman and know how she bears the disappointment, for disappointment it must be to her ....Get on quite fast with my block work . ....Saturday go over to church but find Mr. Meade too poorly to preach. I go with cousin Lou to her church and hear a fine sermon from Mr. Brock....After church I go to sister Bettys and stay until the next day and come home after church. Mr. Brown and I arrange all our business. They [it is unclear if Louisa's is referring to her slaves who are hired out by the year or to her sister Betty's family] will perhaps move next week. Ma better but still confined to her room. I'm still very poorly ....

    
## March 4-10 

  Mr. Meade too poorly to preach but he adminsters the communion. [Supper guests.]....A letter from Emily, poor child, she seems to be very much let down. I wish I knew what to advise for her. I can't encourge her to go when her friends oppose it so bitterly for I can't think a blessing will attend her efforts. But are they right in their disapproval? Dear little woman, I can only pray that God may guide her to do what is his will and if she is defeated in this darling project she must find some other field for inspiration for I feel assured that her's will not be a life of idleness. Sue and Mary Lewis go off dining at one of our neighbors. I stay at home on the bed all day sick .... [Calls received and letters written.] Uncle Bob and brother Jim dine with us on Friday. They bring no news. Brother Jim thinks there is but little chance of Emily's going. Says Mr. Coffman has a learned article on cats to read me from Heroditus. I'm quite curious.

    
## March 11-17 

  At church and hear Mr. Latane. He is very interesting. Sue and I stay in town visiting. I go to church again at night. Poor Sue is in bed sick with a headache. Attend Mr. John Tool's [the artist's] funeral. He was buried with masonic honors. It was a very impressive ceremony but it does not seem right to bury our dead out of our sight without a prayer or a word from one of God's ambassadors. Attend several lectures on Sunday Schools by a Mr. Hunter who calls himself the children's friend. He certainly has the happy facility of engaging their whole attention while addressing them. He must be a good man for I don't believe one whose heart is not in his work could talk as he does. Maggie and Nannie [Anderson] are much interested and stay in town until he leaves. Sue and I make a visit of two days and two night to Orange Dale .....Get the whole household interested in my block work. All the old trunks and boxes are ransacked to add to my stock of materials. Aunt Rebecca gives me quite a treasure, a piece of a dress she and Ma had when they were young. Get back to town on Thursday morning ....[Pays many visits.] Saturday attend church and heard a sermon from Mr. Meade....

    
## March 18-24 

  ....Mr. Meade not able to preach so we go with Cousin Lou .... A fine sermon but I was suffering too much to enjoy it. Take to my bed when I get from church but am well again by dark. A quiet talk with Sam while Sue and Giny are at Church. It rains too hard for me to go out ....Work on my quilt which is beginning to make quite a show ....Wednesday evening attend prayer meeting and then come home. Ma has quite recovered her health ....Bob Lewis spends a day and night with us this week. He brings me the news that Emily was to start making preparations to go to Africa on Thursday. I feel so troubled that she should leave Virginia without sending me a word of farewell. Think Bob must be mistaken. I can feel and think of nothing but Emily. Dear little woman what is to be your fate ....Mary Lewis from home all the week helping Mrs. Meade to sew. Mrs. Meade has a sewing machine but does not know how to use it and she has such a host of children Mary Lewis went over to do some work for them ....

    
## March 26-31

  Ma's birthday; she is 67. Today hear Mr. Meade [preach] a very fine sermon. Miss [Carrie] Morrill and I have a talk about Emily. I wish much I could see more of her for I know I would like her ....On Monday have a letter from Emily. She has not yet left Virginia but I think it but little doubt now of her going. May God guide her to do His will ....[Letters

 written and received.] Read such a sweet book lent me by cousin Ann Gilmer, *The Lord Our Shepard*. Nanny and I commence Irving's *Life of Columbus* ....A note from ...Emily;...she will hear her fate tomorrow .....Thursday evening the 29th a note of farewell from Emily. She left for New York today. Dear little woman, my heart feels so heavy to think I may never see you again in this world. I fear I'm not a cheerful giver for I cannot feel reconciled to your going to that "Land of darkness as darkness itself" even though it be about your Master's work but I must look upon the bright side and pray that her labors may be blessed and that she may be spared to come back to us and should that be impossible we may indulge in the hope of someday in that home not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Oh, dear, it does seem hard to me-weak mortal that I am-that I should just have the dear little woman long enough with me to know and love her so well and then for her to be taken so far away but it must be all for the best and I will try to see the hand of God in it . ....[Much company all week.] Attend church on Saturday and hear a sermon from Mr. Nelson....

    
## April 1-7 

  A sermon from Mr. Meade...on fasting and a beautiful spirit. Church every day this week but Monday, it being Passion Week ....Wrote to Emily in New York. A note from Cousin Fanny Hart and some materials for the Lewis family tree ....A kind note from Miss Carrie Morrill-our subject is Emily ....Good Friday (6th) go to church and have a sermon suitable for the day from Mr. Robert Nelson,...returned missionaries are not generally eloquent preachers. John Macmurdo comes up today. He brings some such beautiful flowers from cousin Ann ....Mary Lewis is in high fix for Richmond. She will return with John. How she will enjoy herself! I almost envy her the novelty of the first trip to a city.

    
## April 8 -14 

  Easter Sunday a sermon from Mr. Meade....How many thoughts of the past this season calls up. Last year I had my darling little Emily with me and I was so happy. This year we are widely separated and with little prospect of our meeting on earth again and there are other sad changes for me, some that will have great influence on my future life but I must try to bear up bravely under them all. May God help me so to do. Lizzie Dee spends a night with us. She gives us all the news of the neighborhood. Mary Lewis and Johnny leave on Wednesday. Mary Lewis will perhaps be away three or four weeks. Brother James and Sister Mary come up shopping. They call by for me and we spend the day together in town. Dine at Kellers. [Visitors.]....Mr. Coffman called. Mignon brought in one of her new kittens to the parlor to show him.

    
## April 15-21 

  A beautiful sermon from Mr. Nelson....Read ....Sue and I spend a day and night with Mary Walker and have a nice quiet visit ....[Letters received and written to friends and kins near at hand and in Missouri.] Thursday I go over the church (the Convocation is going on) expecting to meet sister Betty there but she does not come in so I stay with Cousin Lou and have an opportunity to attend church again at night. Sue comes in the night very prepared to stay and I remain with her until Saturday after church when I go out home with sister Betty. Friday night, Sue and I spend together at Mr. John Woods.... Lizzy and Lucy were very kind but I felt out of place *now *with girls who talk and think much about beaux. The preaching during Convocation was so good and I enjoyed it much ....A letter from Mary Lewis; she seems to be enjoying herself much. Get up to sister Betty's Saturday after church and have a warm welcome from the whole household. It is my first visit to the new house [Rugby] and I like it very much. There is so much room and it is so convenient. I find cousin Howel there and we have a long chat about our darling Emily. Dear little woman, she sailed today (21st) with Bishop Payne and his wife from Baltimore in the ship, Mary C. Stevens. Dear little Emily, to that eternal God who alone spreadest out the heavens and smoothest the raging of the sea, I commend thee. That He may guard you from all ills and give you his peace is the prayers of one who loves you very dearly.

    
## April 22-28 

  Sunday hear Mr. Martin in the morning and at night go to the University Chapel and hear Mr. Scott, the former chaplain ....I have a nice time this week and read, sleep and visit. Dine one day with my cousins Lucy and Mary Terrel and have such a pleasant stay. They are such agreeable old spinsters ....Oh, how many old memories come thronging up at the sight of them-some of those happy days when life seemed so bright before me-but enough of this, I've much to be thankful for. Read Miss Murdock's *Life For A Life*-what a book it is! She must have studied the human heart wel1 ....I find [the visitors at Rugby] rather young to be much of a companion for me. Oh, seems how I wish I could make myself companionable for all ages. I feel so lonely sometimes and can get up an interest in so few people ....

    
## April 29-May 5

  Hear Mr. Omen from I Timothy 3-16. Get home after church and am very poorly again, not able to sit up for a day or so .... I can do nothing but lie on the bed and read. Oh! if I could only be strong again. A letter from dear Miss Vallant. What would I give to see her but she says she cannot come as she has promised Sue Bacon to go to her in Boston this summer and she cannot make two trips. She sends me such a nice lot of flower seeds. Aunt Ria is still with the Doctor-poor little woman! I fear much she will never be well again. I indulge myself this week to an excess in novel reading. Hope to do better soon ....On Saturday quite an unexpected pleasure. Quite early in the day, Miss Carrie Morrill comes in and spends the day and night with us ....I feel as if I could love her for she is Emily's friends and thus is no everyday character. We sympathize with each other over our loss of dear Emily. In the evening, Carrie and I ride to town, do some work and then return. On calling at the office I am delighted to find a letter from Emily sent from Savannah, where the Mary C. Stevens stopped to take on emigrants from Augusta. She writes with a sad heart but with not one word of regret for the steps she has taken. Says she is very happy that she has been permitted to go.

    
## May 6-12 

  Go to church and hear cousin Dabney Davis [preach.] Say good bye then to Miss Carrie. Hope to see more of her before she leaves Virginia ....Today a meeting was appointed. Nothing is talked of now but Convention. My nose cold is very bad. Mary Lewis comes up on Wednesday and as a matter of course John Macmurdo comes too. It is now fully decided that John is to be my brother and I must learn to love him for Sue's sake. Oh, dear, I wonder why I'm so blind, but such an event never took the shape of a possibility with me before. It is a hard hard trial for me to give up my very own sister but the change may be for her happiness and it seems selfish in me to put any obstacles in the way. For last six months my trials have been many and when this last one came, I felt indeed as if my cup of sorrow was full to overflowing but thank God I can both think and talk of it now with calmness and see and feel a wiser providence in it all by showing me how vain are all the loves of this world. I've long feared that my happiness depended too much upon the love of earthly friends and my Best Friend seeing these breakers ahead will seem fit to aim his blows at my idols and lo how vain they have proved themselves. This world with its joys and sorrows would be a barren world without human sympathy but we must not think too much of that for there is but One to whom we can look in all times of our tribulations ....[Letters written and received.] Finish reading Irving's *Life of Columbus*. Mary Lewis brings me such a nice copy of Mrs. Brownings poems from Richmond. Mary Lewis seems much pleased with her trip. She was as far as Washington where she spent about ten hours; saw the fine buildings ....

    
## May 13-20 

  ....Bishop Meade makes his annual visit and confirms some 17 or 18 people, three ladies and the rest young men in [the confirmation] class ....[Letters written.] My nose cold very bad; feel better in other prospects. Sam stays Saturday night and all day Sunday. Too pairs of lovers in the house, I feel quite in the way. Johnny Macmurdo leaves on Monday. On Wednesday Sue, Nannie and I go over to Dr. Leitch's where we are invited to stay during the convocation. Meet with some very nice people there ....There's such delightful preaching and I meet with so many old friends among them several from Orange. Take breakfast with Juliet Gilmer on morning and meet there the returning missionary, H.B. Scott. We have some talk about Africa and he gives me much hope of my dear Emily. I am also introduced to Mr. Davis the pastor of the old church in Alexandria where Emily brought me the Ivy leaves, from. Mr. Scott gives me some treasures from Jerusalem; a piece of Evergreen from the site of Solomon's Temple and some seed corn from the Holy City. Breakfast one morning with sister Betty and have my first day with my friend Sally Williansom ....Saturday. Sue, Mary Lewis...Nannie and I dined at Mrs. Sinclair's where we have a nice time ....Sunday night is the closing service of the convocation. Both Bishops made an addresses and that of Bishop Meade's drew tears from many eyes.	He spoke of his ministry of almost fifty years; of the first Charlottesville Convocation at which he was present; of the many changes and improvements since then; of those who have since entered into their rest and concluded with the solemn question, "Where would we like to be at this next convocation in this place ten years from now?"	 It would be impossible for all those present to be together at that day, for himself, he could almost say with certainty he would not be there for his alloted time of years was already spent. (Thought: how many changes are in store for us all in the next ten years but though changes come and we are called to give up many who are near and dear to us, still we have a promise of a meeting in that better land where there shall be no more coming or going out. After the benedictions, the convocation hymn was sung, "Oh how grand, how glorious is the voice of true grace to every son and daughter of adoration." Oh that we could all be made to feel its promises and perfect power to save!...Mr. Hoffman's sermon was one in favor of missions and was the best one of the kind I ever heard him make. Such a delicate and beautiful allusion to dear Emily. He will return to Africa in November. Dr. Sparrow's sermon on Sunday morning was on the millenium.

    
## May 21-26 

  Monday go home and take a peep at them all. Pack up my clothes and in company with Nanny start off for Music Hall on Tuesday. Meet sister Betty, brother Jim, Sally and Bert Williamson on the cars. They got on at the University. Find sister Mary and all glad to see us. Have such a merry time. Breakfast at Uncle Bob's. I miss Sue so much It does not seem right in me to be away from her as she is so soon to leave us for good and all but I feel so miserable to see all the preparations going on for her departure and I know my long face does her no good. Oh!, that I could feel happy in her happiness but I hope and pray for better feelings in this matter. Sister Mary tells me some news. [Louisa is to be godmother for Sister Mary's baby, Lydia Laurie who was named after their deceased mother.] I'm not surprised ....Brother Jim goes driving [and] Sister Mary and I am almost alone. A severe hail storm in the evening.

    
## May 27-June 2 

  Whit Sunday Lydia was baptized at Grace Church by Mr. Boyden. Brother Jim, Alice [Lewis] and I standing sponsors for her. The little lady conducted herself with great propriety-only pouted out her mouth a little when Mr. Boyden put the water on her face. Dear child, may the vows we three made for you be faithfully kept. When in our daily supplications at The Throne of Grace may we never neglect to ask for her the blessing of His Holy Spirit that fit may shine in her heart as to cause you evermore to rejoice in His holy comfort through Christ our Lord . ....Tuesday Sister Mary and I go down to The Creek to dine. Oh, how everything about the place brings back dear dear Emily to me. I would like to go off and think and even cry, baby that I am but I must be brave. Kate [Whitehead who is visiting at The Creek] is a dear little woman and I enjoy being with her. She comes home with us and we spend the night together at Uncle Bob's. Lizzie Dee is very busy getting ready to go to Staunton on Thursday to attend a big meeting of her church. I've seen a good deal of her since I've been down. Brother Jim away all this week until Friday in Charlottesville serving on the jury ....I have entirely forgotten to note the death of cousin Martha Minor. She died very suddenly at her farm, Machunk on Wednesday the 16th of May, aged 67 years. Brother Jim and I found her birth in the old Register: born 1793 ....Charlotte and Cousin Tom call by on Friday evening and take me to The Creek where I spend the night with Kate. The young people are all away attending a June Dance at The Green Springs. We have a quiet pleasant evening and night. Saturday spent at Clover Fields. Cousin Peggy [Nelson] is so sweet and kind ....[letters received and written.]

    
## June 3-9 

  The service and a sermon read by Mr. W.C. [William Cabel] Rives. After church met with some of the Macmurdo clan, Helen and Sadie (Mrs. Rives). They seemed glad to visit with me. Monday morning brother Jim and I go to Castalia to breakfast. On returning home get into a box of old Grandfather Douglas's books and papers. Such a treat. I get some additions to my books of valuable letters; also the certificates of the Parson's ordination to the offices of a Deacon and Priest of the English Church by Bishop Shirlack in the years 1748 and 1749 and the seals attached. Kate comes up early and cousin Sarah also calls. Kate and I have a very confidential chat over some black blasphemers. Spend the night at Kinlock-have a nice evening. Mr. Coffman and I talk about dear little Emily. I have discovered I have a ready listener whenever she is the topic of conversation. Tuesday we make a morning call at Mr. Nelson's....In the evening we go to The Creek, where we are invited to visit the Pegram party and eat ice cream. The ladies and gentlemen are very pleasant but I'm too poorly to enjoy the goodies. Nicky [Lewis] brings me home early in the morning and I take to my bed until after dinner. Lizzie Dee and Betsy Nelson to spend the night with us ....Thursday morning Nanny and I take our departure for home and find a host of friends in the cars and meet Sue and Mary Lewis in town and soon get home where I find all well and glad to see me. The garden is a perfect wilderness of weeds. The cherries are nearly over. All hands and the machine are very busy at work on Sue's wedding clothes. Such a quantity being made up. John Macmurdo up on Saturday. I am very poorly; spend most of my time on the bed.

    
## June 10-16 

  Do not attend church. Commence a long letter to my Emily. Dr. Leitch to see me. Sam to supper. He and I have a pleasant chat. I hope he will turn out right for I like him very much. Finish my letter to Emily . Wrote [letters]... and do some novel and history reading. Not able to help much about the sewing ....

    
## June 17-22

  Have a good sermon from Mr. Meade. See my cousins Lou and Sara Young and Nora Bankhead. I'm sorry not to be able to go out to sister Betty's and stay some with them but I cannot bring myself to leave home as Sue has such a short time to stay and then I'm too feeble to be companionable for young girls. See Miss Carrie for a conversation; perhaps she will not return to Virginia. Troubles for Sue this week. 	The News of Mr. E. Robinson's fall. We all fear it will affect cousins Sop and John. [Sop and John Macmurdo are employed by the railroad of which Robinson had been an officer.] Poor Sue is so miserable. John is up on Saturday but some of their plans cannot be finally decided until it it known whether cousin Sop will retain his office [with the railroad.] I am so interested in *Villetta*. What a great book and how interesting it is. What sufferings and trials Charlotte Bronte always indulges her heroines in. Her books have a great effect on my spirits. I sometimes doubt if they do me any good. My new bookcase comes home and I'm much pleased with it ....

    
## June 24-29 

  Have an old sermon from Mr. Meade-After church we find Mr. Arrowsmith at the carriages. He is very pleasant and tells us of Aunt Ria and Miss Vallant. We have quite a long chat. He seems much interested in politics-thinks this fair country is rapidly drifting into ruins. I agree with him-it is really alarming to think of the present state of this country. On Monday, Mary Lewis and I go over to town on a shopping expedition. Call to see Mr. Arrowsmith at the Hotel and have a pleasant chat. Bring Cousin Isabella and Sarah home with us. The weather so hot and dry. Harvest begins. I am improving in health. Dr. Leitch sent me some appropriate pills which I think does both spirits and health good. Much company this week ....At one time we all feared [Sue's] marriage would have to be given up altogether but the course of true love never runs smoothly but on Saturday John comes up and by night matters are made right and the wedding is decided for Tuesday July 3rd. Sue is all smiles but Oh, dear, down deep in my heart I wonder it is only selfish in me but I can't see any bright side to the picture. My prayers to God that she may be happy as she deserves to be. Sam with us Saturday night. Also John Macmurdo. Bob and I have to take to books by way of entertaining ourselves as the engaged ones have eyes and longings only for each other. What a change being in love makes in people!...much talk about the wedding apparel. Sue, I think has a very handsome stock and in great enough quantities to last her for some years to come. I can't feel any pleasure in looking at her beautiful clothes when I remember our mourning hearts and deep garb of woe but a few short months ago for our dear boy. Sue does not take off her black but there is so much finery mixed with it to set it off that it seems a kind of mockery but perhaps I'm too old fashioned in my taste.

    
## July 1-7 

  We do not attend church as Uncle Hatter is too tired from the harvesting. Monday cousins Ann and Rose [Macmurdo] are expected but do not come as it storms. Some strangers come in to get out of it. The hail stones are very large.

  Tuesday July 3rd Sue's Wedding Day. Cousin Ann and Rose get up to dinner. We are all very busy. I feel quite strong today. Feel so thankful for it, for it would seems very unkind in me to let my aching heart to be seen. Sue had decided to be married in a black dress as she had heard a white one would be expected to be married in church. In consequent I objected to the black dress very much. Could not think of a bride in black but as no one else in the family thought it amiss. I was alone in my objection and I'm inclined to think they all considered it a kind of Minor kink but when Cousin Ann got here and she was told the color of the dress, she objected to it so much that Sue agreed to wear a white muslin of mine. I felt so much relieved. It was a very quiet affair, no one being present but the family, Cousins Ann and Rose, Bolling Picket who came up with them and remained until Thursday, Sam, John and Mr. Meade. I don't believe the marriage could have gone on without the two last. Sue had some very pretty presents. John gave her a beautiful little watch. The Macmurdo clan sent some handsome articles of silver and her Leitch kin all sent some token of love. Ma gave her such a beautiful pin of pearls and jet. All of us children gave some little thing: Mary Lewis a Prayer book, Nannie some buttons for certain garments and the other little ones some suitable remembrances. My gift was a set of hair ornaments made of the hairs of the whole Pantops family living and dead, from Pa Anderson to little Dick. The bridal party stayed until Friday and had calls from quite a number of friends. Thurday evening, Dr. Leitch, cousin Lou and Isabella and Sarah take supper with us. I am so glad that I'm able to bear up through it all. Indeed, now that the die is cast I really feel better about it. Sue seems so happy and every one speaks so well of the man of her choice, I begin to see light behind the clouds and think it is so selfish in me to wish her to stay and be with me. My prayer to God for her is that she may be happy in her new vocation and that His blessing may be upon her and John. The parting Friday was a sad, sad one for us all. Oh dear me, I feel as if I could almost bear anything now, to think that my darling Sue has gone from me and I'm never to have her all to myself again. Oh, it makes my heart ache so badly every way I turn brings up my loss in a new light, that I feel almost wild but that is weakness in me, and I must remember it as one part and lot in this life to be tried and that it was right to be resigned to receive from ones Father's hand many cups of bitter wine. Both John and cousin Ann give me a very kind invitation to return to Ashland with them but I decline as I was not ready and then I'm too feeble to be visiting. I hope in time to be able to visit them this winter. Black Emily goes with Sue as a maid. Little Dick is much troubled about giving her up. On Saturday Mary Lewis and I get settled in our closets. [Mary Lewis has moved into the Lodge with Louisa.] I don't feel much at home. Sam [Leitch] is with us and he is so kind and thoughtful of me. He is really more like the Sam of years ago. I am thankful for my heart is very heavy.

    
## July 8 -14 

  Do not attend church. Sam stays with us. Monday, Mary Lewis and Mammy Eliza go over to town shopping and bring back Katie Whitehead with them. I'm so pleased for I love her so much. She is among the few that I count as my friend. We have such nice times together, reading, sleeping and talking. A letter from Sue; she seems happy in her new home. They are all kindness and attentive toward her. On Wednesday Lizzie Dee joins us. She gives me all the particulars of Miss Carrie's sojourn at Ridgway. Poor little woman, I fear she was not very kindly cared for. What a world this might be if people would only consider the comforts of others a little more and exercise some Christian charity towards those who many think differently from them. I'm afraid Miss Carrie will not carry back to Maine very exalted ideas of the kindness of Virginians to strangers. Lizzie and Kate stay until Friday evening. When they are gone I feel a kind of lonely. A letter from Brother Jim; he and sister Mary are about taking wing for the Green Springs. Saturday I answer it. Mary Lewis in bed all day with a cold. Sam to supper. I'm poorly again; had quite a time from the aches of moon this week. Mammy very sick. I feel so troubled about her. Wrote Sue a long letter early in the week, propose to exchange a weekly epistle with her ....

    
## July 15-21 

  Too poorly to attend church. Read Mr. Slaughter's new book *Man and Domain* ....What a work he proposes for the men of the present day! Who will be the ones to begin? Do some letter writing this week. I had neglected so many of my correspondents for such a time that I may seldom have such a treat as a letter. A letter from Lizzie Minor in Missouri. She is very anxious to come to Virginia to go to school. Wants some information on the subject. I shall write to brother Jim about it. Do a good deal of sewing this week although I'm very poorly. Teach school. Take Ellen for a while so as to get her to reading a little .....Such a lovely sweet letter from Sue who tells me of her present from "Mike", a pair of beautiful Canary Birds. Wants me to name them. I propose Paul Emanuel and Lucy Summer. Wrote to her a length, 12 pages, the next day. Read *Tales of the Alhambra*.

    
## July 22 -28 

  Go to the Methodist Church there being no preaching at my own and I hear such a sweet sermon ....It cannot be wrong to allow our thought to dwell upon the glories of the New Jerusalem and to remember that we too may one day behold its glories! That beautiful hymn of Montgomery's as so expresive of my feelings.

  	"My Father's house on high 

 	Home of my Soul, how near 

 	At times, to faith's foreseeing eye 

 	Its golden gates appear!

  Cousin Lou keeps Nanny for Company. Sam gives us his company back. Do some reading and letter writing. Get to work on the quilt again ....[Visitors.]I'm much improved in health. Cousin Dabney Davis and Miss Mary Anderson were married on Monday at Miss Leaton's. The ministers must have great confidence in her as this is the second one that had taken a wife from under her roof. [Misses Anne and Jane Leaton operate the Piedmont Institute for Women.]  Brother Jim agrees with me that we ought not to encourage Missouri Lizzie Minor's coming to Virginia to school on account of the expense. Finish my big scrap book. Sam with us Friday evening until Saturday. On that day David Anderson from Missouri arrives on his way to school [the Virginia Military Institute] in Lexington. He is a good looking boy. I hope we shall be good friends. He knows most of my nieces; talks to me of them. A letter from Sally Williamson and Sister Mary. I am thinking of going to Music Hall soon [as I] want to go as far as Orange with Brother Jim.

  	[At this point in the journal, Louisa fills four pages with poems that she has copied. The poems are about death and mourning for lost loved ones.]

    
## July 29-Aug. 4

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach.] Monday Mammy Eliza and I go to town shopping. A rain comes up and we go with Mrs. Holladay to get out of it.  We are kindly entertained by both Mrs. Holladay and her son Waller. Aunt Sally, Maggie and little Lydia make us a visit of a day and night ....Aunt Sally and I have many things to talk of ....Aunt Sally leaves Maggie with Ellen for a few days; she picks her up at the barn on her way home on Thursday morning. David leaves on Tuesday for Lexington. He is a delicate looking boy for such a

 school. He seems an intelligent boy; takes me through on History, Poetry and Novels ....[Letters written.] Sam with us Thursday night. He goes to Norfolk to get a look at the great wonder of the Navy "The Great Eastern."....[Visitors.]

    
## Aug. 6-11 

  Hear Mr. Meade...on Christian charity and a beautiful sermon suitable for the occasion too, it being communion Sunday. Have brother Jim to breakfast on Monday. I'm anxious to go down to see Lizzie [Minor] if I could only know when Sue will be up for a visit; I don't want to miss her. He sends Jimmy [Minor] up for me. Hear Miss Vallant has been invited to come back to Uncle Robert's to teach school. Hope much she may come. Brother Jim tells me Susan [a slave woman owned by Louisa and hired out] is better [and has] gone home. He thinks she has been very sick ....[Visitors.] News from Sue! She will perhaps be up on Saturday week. What a lovely time to look forward to. I give Met and Maggie a little vacation as the former has company and Mag does not enjoy study by herself. Walker Macmurdo comes up on Wednesday. Sam spends the evening with us ....He saw the big ships and went to see Sue. I turn Yankee and ply him with questions. Emily [black] sends Dick a little present by Walker. The young man is highly delighted and forthwith has a tea party .... On Saturday, Jennie Toole and her sister Nannie arrive. They are Mary Lewis' friends. I do my best to instruct them but expect but little pleasure from the effort. Jennie, I believe, is a nice lady like girl but she does not seem herself in my company. Sam comes in Saturday night

    
## Aug. 12-18 

   A continuation of Mr. Meade's last Sunday sermon...Jennie Toole and her little sister leave on Tuesday evening. Kind of lonely this evening; such feelings often come over me now. Daddy very sick this week. Dr. Leitch sent for in the night to see him. Sam, our friend in need, is with us for a day and night. Daddy is much better by Friday. I'm very much troubled at not having a letter from Sue. Cannot think she would neglect me so long. On Friday the letter comes. It has been missent and was written a week ago. Sue and John will perhaps be up on Tuesday. Hear that Miss Carrie Morrill will teach school at Mr. Maury's. I'm real glad; hope she may find a pleasant home and they may like her. I'm very busy with my block work. Sam watches it with much interest. Have a good many of my flower roots taken up and some of them put back again. I write to Sally Williamson to tell her I could not visit her at this time. It is a disappointment to me but I hope still to make it out at some future day. A walk with the children to see a Ground Hog dug out. Quite an exciting scene; the dogs barking and the children screaming. On Saturday I go over to meet Sue and John at the Depot. They arrive in due season. She is looking well and happy. Seems much pleased to be with us again. She brings me a beautiful copy of Tennyson's poems and a picture of herself that I prize much. Everyone at Ashland seems to be very agreeable to her. They are all so kind and do everything in their power to make her happy and comfortable. She gives us an account of poor Prissy. She deserves a better fate. How little we thought when so happy as school mates that in a few short years one of our little band would have to experience such trials as have been her lot but such is life. It is indeed good and kind in the wise one above to fling destiny's cloud o'er the face of our years so we may not know the sorrows that we have in store for us and so enjoy the bright moments as they pass. Sam is with us. Daddy is much better.

    
## Aug. 19-25 

  We are at church and hear Mr. Herrick... He is a young beginner but I like the sermon. Company in the evening. Not agreeable for Sunday evening but they came to see Sue. Have a quiet chat with her before we go to bed. On Wednesday they are all off for home. I'm on the lookout for Jimmy [Minor] and the Rockaway. He gets up quite early and we start off soon after dinner. A very black cloud keeps us anxious the whole way down. Several times I though we would have to put into a near port to avoid a soaking but the rain respected our helpless state and held up until we arrived at Music Hall and got the baggage secured, then it came down in torrents. Find them all well and glad to see me; all lamenting that Sue is not along. Sister Mary has been waiting for my arrival to make her round of visits, so this next morning we start out, she driving us in the rockaway. Our first call is at Mr. Pegram's to see cousin Sarah Gilmer. We dine at Clover Fields and also make a call at Mr. K[eating] Nelson's and Kinloch. Tidings reach us this week of dear Emily. Julia Lewis(of the Creek) had a long letter and I was permitted to read it. She had not when she wrote landed at Africa. The coast was in sight. Not a word of her health. Wrote in good spirits. Bishop Payne in a letter of a later date mentioned that she was well and he thought pleased. Emily wrote a very instructing account of her voyage out and her school of little boys on the vessel. Some of them were so intelligent that she thought there was certainly a future President of Liberia among them. Cousin Sarah Lewis makes us a visit of several days. I enjoy her company very much. I'm at Uncle Bob's two night this week. Lizzie Dee has concluded to go back to town this session and turn school girl. I feel sorry but think if she intends to make a teacher of herself she ought to be prepared. Miss Vallant has not been heard from. I write for Kate Whitehead to join me. A note from her on Saturday telling me she is sick in bed and does not think she can come. I'm so disappointed for I do love Kate. Two letters from home. Finish off such a big piece of block work.

    
## Aug. 26-Sept. 1 

  At church but not sermon, a discourse from both Mr. Boyden and Mr. Lyon on the subject of the Bible Society. Mr. Boyden comes to dinner. Cousin Howel(Lewis) also joins Cousin Sarah and we have a jolly time. Monday evening some company to tea. I do not enjoy it very much as I had to play the part of introductions and some of them are strangers ....Friday sister Mary, brother Jim and I go down and dine with Minor Page... They had such a sweet little house and such nice little children. Call at Miss Pages on our return and have a very pleasant time. Miss Ellen is so kind and seems so glad to see me, she is one of the few pleasant old maids. While there a hard rain comes up and we have to stay until almost dark; are very late getting home. Find niece Lizzie at Uncle Bob's and I stay up stairs with the maid Sarah to guard me.  Miss Vallant has been heard from. She will accept Aunt Sarah's offer [to teach at Castalia] but will not be able to come for a week or two yet. The letter was from Portland, Maine, and she had to go to New York to make some few preparations before she could start for Virginia. I fear I can't stay down to see her. Wrote to Mammy Eliza and brother Peter. At Uncle Bob's for a day or two this week. Lizzie Dee and I go out visiting together. Spend a night at Cousin Fanny Harts and am introduced to Mag's friend Miss Spenser from Charlotte County ....We try to trace out some relationship between us as her grandmother was a Miss Lewis of Albemarle but it is soon made clear she was none of our set. Friday night we go to Kinloch ....A quiet time ...as several members of the family are away ....Brother Jim has a long letter from Emily. She was really in Africa and pleased. Her health and spirits are both good. The dear little woman expresses both joy and thankfulness that she had been allowed to go to Africa in that work of lowly love for her Lord and Master. Begs brother Jim, as he helped her so much, that he will put it in the heart of others to go where there is so much to do and so few to do it. Sister Mary and I return to The Creek to call on Miss Jones [the new school teacher.] She is a sharp looking little woman, rather pretty. No danger of my forming another friendship with her. Dr. Boylan comes today with his son Jimmy. Oh, how he can

 talk. None of us have an opportunity to get in a word often, just now and then. Mr. Coffman seems low in spirits.

    
## Sept. 2-8 

  At church and hear a sermon read by brother Jim. Lizzie Dee spends the night with me. Some singing and a discussion with Dr. Boylan on African Missions after supper. On Monday it is really confusion, utter confussion all day. So many arrivals of new boys-most of them have either fathers, brothers or mothers to introduce them. Among the first is the Orange Millionaire, Mr. George Debuis and a real gentleman he is. I feel so sorry for his little son, he seemed so troubled to give up his father. It is his first trial of life from home. Cousin Frank Carr also brought his son and stayed for a day or two. On Tuesday Mrs Morris arrives with her boy. It is my first acquaintance with her and I'm so pleased. She is so pleasant and lady like ....The house is over flowing with boys now but when they all get to work in real earnest I imagine there will be very little noise and confusion. The last news from home very astonishing; that Daddy and Mammy Eliza had gone down on Friday to Ashland to see Sue. Mammy Eliza's first journey on the cars! Daddy's eyes are so bad that I fear he is not able to take care of himself and for that reason Mammy Eliza was induced to go. Oh, how troubled I feel to think of Daddy's being so blind and I fear there is no hope of their getting better. We will all have to exert ourselves and be eyes for him as we can and let him feel his loss as less as possible. Oh that he may be able to see God's hands in his affliction and to feel that He wishes all things well. A long letter from Sue but it was written before the arrival of The Pantopians at Ashland. They returned on Monday . ....[Letters written and received.]Mammy Eliza...is perfectly charmed with her visit to Ashland. Says Sue has such a sweet home. She met with one of her childhood friends. I will have much to hear when I get home again ....Sister Mary and I walk to The Creek and call. Miss Jones walks a part of the way back with us. She is not troubled much with diffidence. On Friday night after prayers, Bob and I have the school room to ourselves and take a long confidential chat. How I wish I could do something to turn his thoughts to the right channel, to aid him in his search for that "Pearl of Great Price." Call at The Creek. Miss Jones and I have a swing together. I have a long chat with Jimmy [Lewis] and he tells me of his troubles. I wish I could help the poor boy but it is a matter in which a third party would do no good so I can only give him my sympathy. A letter from Nanny Anderson. She tells me David [Anderson from Missouri] has left [Virginia Military Institute at] Lexington. I'm very sorry ....[Letters received] ....News from Miss Vallant. She will be here the last of next week so I conclude not to go home on Monday but stay to meet her ....

    
## Sept. 9-15

  A sermon from Mr. Boyden from the text "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do." The Holy Communion is administered. Finish reading Kostis book On That Holy Faith ....A quiet walk in the morning with sister Mary and Mr. Coffman. Monday a call from Mary Walker and Miss Sara Terrel. Mary Walker has commenced knitting a counterpane and she is such a machine to knit that it will no doubt soon be finished ....[Letters written

 and dinner guests.] Cousin Howel comes for me on Red Eye Wednesday morning and I go home with him where Aunt Sally and I have planned to dine. Have such a jolly day. Both Cousin Sarah and Aunt Sally seem to try themselves to make me laugh. Miss Jones and her school are all busy so I have the old folks all to myself. Sister Mary comes for me in the evening in the waggon and we go to prayer meeting. I spend a day and night with Aunt Sally this week. Alice [Lewis] and I ride to Cobham hoping Miss Vallant might possibly arrive, certainly expecting a letter but returned without either. The letter does not arrive until Saturday and then she says nothing about the time she will arrive. I'm very disappointed for I had so hoped she would come while I was down. Saturday evening we all go chinquapin hunting, succeed in getting about a dozen. Go to Uncle Bob's to supper but am so tired that we conclude to stay all night and Aunt Sally invites me to write to Miss Vallant for her. Have a very satisfactory talk with both Bob and Jimmy today. I heartily wish them both success.

    
## Sept. 16-22 

  Go to the brick church and heard such a fine sermon from Dr. McGuffey, "Let die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his." The charateristics of both Balaam and Balak were viewed from several new points to me. Monday I feel quite low as it is being too hard for me to go home. I do not get off until evening when brother Jim takes me up in the Rockaway. Get home before night and find them all well as usual and right glad to see me. Are inclined to grumble that I should have stayed away so long. David and Sam are both here. David soon got enough of Lexington and gave himself leave to take up the march for home. I found a very long letter from Sue waiting for me which I answer in the next few days. Both Peck [her cat] and Bruno [her dog] have improved very much during my absence. Bruno has had a long severe spell of sickness but it seems to have ended in his improvement. I go to work in real earnest as Sue talks of coming up the middle of October and says I must be ready to return with her. Do a good batch of reading. Robert comes by and spends a day and night with us. His fate has been decided. He is braver than I thought him. Oh, if it would only make a man of him ....Go to town on Saturday and do some of Sister Mary's shopping. Dick has his likeness taken, which is very good. [At this point in the journal, Louisa h copied four pages of poems about the death and burial of a child.]

    
## Sept. 23-29 

  Sunday, dear Jim's 21st Birthday. Have the old Bishop to preach for us today. The 2nd sermon I have heard from him and it was very fine. Subject the true joys of a Christian. Hear that Miss Vallant arrived at Castalia some day last week. How I want to see her ....News from Sue. She and John will be up on Saturday next. Friday evening I was roused from a nap by the arrival of Miss Vallant, Alice, Ellen and Lizzie Minor. I was so delighted to be with Miss Vallant again. The many things to talk of. The sixteen months that she has been absent from Virginia have seemed long and eventful. They have seemed a lifetime to me. Miss Vallant looks well and expressed great pleasure at being among her old friends. She is a dear good woman and I wish much she would always stay among us. The girls came up on a shopping expedition. I went on to town with them and helped Lizzie. Sue and John get up on the cars this morning and I go back [to Pantops] with them. I'm very glad Sue and Miss Vallant had an opportunity of meeting. Sue has come to make a visitation of some weeks. John expects to return the first of the week. Saturday evening Miss Vallant and the girls leave. I'm sorry they cannot stay until Monday, especially Miss Vallant. Feel as if I had hardly seen her. So many thoughts that I want to talk to her about but I am thankful to have seem her even for this little while. Poor Uncle Hatter's wife, Aunt Maria, died on Friday night. She had been long sick. The old man was very much distressed.

    
## Sept. 30-Oct. 6 

  ....Sam is with us, so with Sue and John we form quite a party. John leaves on Monday and we all go to our regular employments. I can scarcely realize that Sue has ever left us. She seems so natural now that John is not with her. On Wednesday we all go to prayer meeting. Sue and I stay in town as we want to visit some of our friends; spend the next night and day with cousin Lou. Such rainy weather but we manage to wade through the mud on Thursday evening to Cousin Isabella's where we put up for the night and the next day. Spend one night at Orange Dale ....Take tea with Miss McPherson in her own house. She is very pleasant. See something of my dear little Katie. She is soon to leave the county and perhaps be gone all the winter ....We propose a correspondence which I know will be a pleasure to me. Do all my shopping for my trip to Ashland. I think of going down with Sue the last of the month for a visit of several weeks.

    
## Oct. 7-13 

  A sermon from Mr Meade ....Communion Sunday. After church I walk out with the children to sister Betty's; find her poorly ....It has been so long since I saw any of them that we have much to talk of. Go back to home on Monday morning early when I find the carriage, Mammy Eliza and some of the children ready to take me home. Lizzie Wood goes back with us and stays until Tuesday evening when Charlie Wood comes for her.. I love Lizzie very much and would be glad to count her as one of my friends. A letter from Missouri Lizzie Minor. She has concluded to stay in Missouri and go to school. A wise thinking in my opinion ....I'm very busy this week pickling. Get enough for the year. Daddy, Sue, Mary Lewis and I dine at Mr. Taylors...Bob and David arrive soon after we get home. Poor David! I feel very sorry for him. He has not done what is right but it is a forlorn condition to be cast off, orphan as he is. I hope matters may yet be made up between him and his Uncle Bob. Bob has given up his place as manager at home and has accepted a situation as teacher at Dr. G. Michies in the country. I'm pleased at the change and hope he may be satisfied with his new occupation. Have Mary Walker to dine with us ....[and] cousin Howel and the boys to spend Friday. I had a letter of 12 pages from my darling Emily of the date of the 9th of July. She was fairly settled in her African home in Cavalla and well and happy in her work. She has found a true friend in Mrs. Payne. She does not mention having received my letter written the first of June. John comes up on Saturday for a week's visit. Sue is in the best kind of spirits. What a change getting married makes in people! Indeed I feel quite inclinded to grumble about Sue. We all seem such secondary considerations to John. He is ever foremost in her thoughts. Well it is right, I suppose, but it is not agreeable. We are all much amused at Bruno's attemps to play the agreeable to John's dog Marco. Bruno really shows a great deal of intelligence; shows so much feeling about Marco's being confinded and does every thing in his power to cheer him in his solitude. Lizzie Dee comes Saturday night and the rain keeps her until Monday morning. We have a cozy time.

    
## Oct. 14-20 

  A rainy Sunday. Tuesday we are all invited to Tom Randolph's. I'm too sick to go; have a quiet day at home with Ma, David and the young ones. A call in the evening from Mr. and Mrs. Meade. Very busy getting ready for Ashland. Cousin Isabella with us and good kind souls as she always is helps us through a difficulty. I get the fixings for the Williamsburg Fair ready; also sister Mary's needle books for Grace Church ....Wrote to Emily Griswold this week...A letter from sister Mary and a sweet note from Carrie Morrill thanking me for the favor of seeing Emily's letter. Jimmy Lewis spends Friday night with us. He seems in good spirits; showed much pleasure in seeing Sue. I like Jimmy, he has some fine qualities. Saturday is a rainy day but we get off and arrive at Ashland to dinner .... Ashland is a much larger place then I had expected to find it. The cottages are around the Hotel and very picturesque and make quite a scene. Mr. James [George Payne Rainsford James, the writer]'s house is pointed out to me. It looks like the abode of a man of letters. I'm heartily received by the whole family but a kind of lonely feeling has taken possesion of me and I find it impossible to rally my spirits. Hope it won't last. Cousin Ann's flowers that have escaped the late frost are very beautiful but flowers at this season make me feel sad. The gentle race of flowers will so soon be lying in their lowly beds but Spring will come when we may again expect the flowers. Sue is very nicely fixed up. Her room is handsomely furnished and she has so many new books, enough to keep me busy all the winter. The birds are looking well. Both Prissy and Mr. Pemberton are away. Old Mrs P. very ill.

    
## Oct. 21-27 

  Sunday and no church. A beautiful day. Some reading and singing in the evening. Monday, Sue, Ellie [Macmurdo] and I go down by the train to Richmond and take dinner at Pizzini's: Oysters, Beef steak, bread and coffee. How very elegant his saloon is ....Get back to Ashland to supper and find the household in a great state of excitement. Dutchie was working on the sewing machine by lamplight and by some means the lamp was upset, the fluid blazed up and being near the curtains and bed they both took fire. Fortunately help was near at hand and it was extinguished before much real harm had been done. The curtains were burned up, some of the bed clothes and the furniture much injured but it was all insured so there will be no real loss. The room looked so forlorn with the blackened walls, burnt curtains and bed clothes and deformed furniture and when it is all before our eyes how can we help feeling the great mercy that was shown toward Dutchie. The flaming element all around her and she escaped unhurt. How comforting to feel that in times of greatest danger He cares for us and His protecting hand is ever stretched out to save. I attend the fair two days but am too tired to really enjoy it. Did not see many of the horses or the trotting.

  The show of needlework, knitting, and fancy work of all kinds was very good but the greatest sight I saw at the fair was a bonnet made in Richmond in 1830. The style was rather different from that of the present day; a great waste of silk and other materials. Saw a procession of The Knights Templars; it was a grand sight with their black dress, waving flourices and glittering lances glistening in the sunlight. One might have imagined the age of chivalry had returned. I do not meet with many acquaintances on the fair grounds though the crowd was very great. None of my friends attend fairs. Wrote home and to Missouri Lizzie Minor. Thursday night stay in to go to a concert given by [Amelia or Adeline] Patti. Her voice is wonderful but I do not enjoy the music. She sang l'Homell but I like to hear Sue sing it. Have a nice time at Mr. Charles Macmurdo's. Mag and Betsy are so sweet and kind and Uncle Charles treats me just as if I was kinfolks .... Go back to Ashland Friday evening to get ready to come in to stay Sunday. Quite a lonely night as I left Sue and all the girls but Nanny in town. Go down on Saturday at two o'clock and find so many girls at Mag's. Spend a quiet evening. Finish reading *The Mill on the Floss* [by George Eliot.] What a horrible ending! It makes me feel very unconfortable to read such books.

    
## Oct. 28-Nov.3 

  Betty Scott and I go in the evening to old St. John's Church to hear Mr. Butler read an old sermon but I like it none the less for that. After church I had a shake of the hand from the little man and his wife. He seemed really glad to see me so that I felt repaid for my long walk. The old church is much fixed up. Had lost all of its antiqued looks. I must confess I felt rather sorry to see the changes. It looked so like dresing up one's grandmother in the garb of a modern day. Take tea at Mr. James Macmurdo's and go to hear Mr. Wilson at St. Paul's [Episcopal Church] at night. He gives us such a very fine sermon ....Such sermons must do good. Go back to Mag's to sleep. Go back to Ashland at two o'clock. Prissie got home last week. Mr. Pemberton also came back for a day or so. His mother is better. Wrote to Mammy Eliza and Miss Vallant ....We have such nice sewing parties. I also do some novel reading. We are all much excited on the subject of politics. The election will soon be here and our fate as a nation will be decided. The signs of the times predict of evil days to come upon us. May He who alone doth all things well be with us in this our hour of need ....How often my thoughts go back to this time one year ago, dear James last week on earth. How vividly all the sounds of that dark time are impressed upon my memory. "He, the young, the strong, who cherished nobler longing for this strife by the wayside fell and perished weary with the march of life." Yes, it is weary and not many of us but feel willing at times to lay down and perish when we think of "our Father's house on high" and of the joys that await us there. But we must toil on and in His own good time, the Golden Gates will be opened for us. I'm beginning to feel quite anxious to see home and its inmates. I don't think I can stand it longer then the 1Oth ....Ellie and I get ready and go down by the one o'clock train. Poor Ellie has a terrible fall from the cars after we get to town. We put up at Uncle Charlies ....Some company to tea; they are strangers to me so I'm not much entertained. Ellie and I in trouble about the dykes. John did not send our trunks.

    
## Nov. 4-10 

  Attend church morning and night at St. James and both times have a beautiful sermon from Mr. Peterkin....After service Betsy, Mag Bryce and I went to the Roman Catholic Church but I did not feel much edified from any thing we saw or heard. Early Monday morning Cousin Ann and Sue come in to go downtown shopping. At twelve o'clock attend a Union Prayer Meeting in one of the Baptist Churches, the object of which was to cast all our cares upon our Heavenly Father for his guidance and protection in these trembling times. Heard some beautiful prayers and addresses from several men of different denominations. Surely we have need of many prayers now when people of this same nation are thirsting for each other's blood. After Church Sue goes home and cousin Ann and I start off on a long tramp. We first go to see Mrs. Richardson. Poor old woman, she looks so feeble, seemed almost childish. She showed much pleasure that I should have thought of her and gone to see her. Cousin Ann took me round by the new poor house and then through the city burying ground. It is a lovely spot and it accorded well with my feelings when wandered through the City of the Dead to remember the scenes which I witnessed that day just one year ago. We too may soon be sleeping that long slumber. Oh, that we may wake up in His likeness. Dine at Pizzini's and get home by eight o'clock. Have two nice letters from home and one from Aunt Ria. I've decided to wait until next week to go home as John is going into the encampment and I would have no one to see me on the cars. I do want to see home quite badly though I'm enjoying myself and all are very kind. Thursday Sue, Dutchie, Miss Rose and some of the others go off to town early in the morning. We have a quiet day to ourselves and finish it off by a coffee dinner. I'm much interested in *Lord Montague's Prize*. The book was waiting at Ashland which makes it all the more entertaining to me. Friday cousin Ann, Sue and several others including myself go down to town to the encampment. It is at the Fair Grounds and we go out in the cars which are crowded as usual. The encampment is a grand sight; about a thousand horse soldiers and several companies of Infantry dressed out in all the pomp and circumstance of war. It is a solemn thought that very soon these very men may be called upon to lay down their lives in their country's call. Great events are on these gates and each hour brings a varying task. Saturday cousin Ann, Kathleen, the children's maids, and myself go down in the evening to hear blind Tom. He is one of the wonders of this wonderful age. Plays the most difficult pieces on the piano after hearing them played once. Composes himself and even plays on the piano with his hands behind him. He does not know a note; plays altogether by his ear.

    
## Nov. 11-17

  I'm sick in bed all day...but better toward evening and down in the sitting room. Monday get packed up in order to send off the trunks to the junction by the four o'clock train. Take quite a long walk after dinner; see more of the country around Ashland than I've done in the whole time that I've been down. It does not bear comparison with our blue mountains and red hills. Oh, how I want a sight of them. How can Sue live away from them? Tuesday morning bright and early, John and I set off in a buggy for the Junction where I am to take the cars for home, sweet home. Have a cold miserable ride of nine miles in an hour and ten minutes and get there just in time. Say good-bye to John and ride off. It is my first trip by myself. Miss Leaton [from The Piedmont Institute] is the only familiar face I see around me but I get on very comfortably and find Dave and Met waiting for me at the Depot. Mary Lewis and Dick are also in town to welcome me. Dick's joy at the sight of me is quite remarkable. Dear little fellow, I believe he does love sister Lou .... Reach home in due time and Oh, how happy I feel. How I wish Sue was along but hope to have her at Christmas. Get unpacked. The children and old folks are all pleased with their presents from Richmond. Mary Lewis and Nannie express great admiration for the pitchers so I'm not singular in my taste ....[Visitors and letters written and received.] A letter from Miss Vallant. She tells me little Maggie has had Scarlet Fever which prevented her being with us this Saturday. She may perhaps come next week. Commenced school and some regular reading. I had a niece born while I was away, sister Betty's ninth child but as I did not know the exact date waited to put it down but it seemed a difficult thing to have it correct and I do not know it yet.

    
## Nov. 19-24 

  I'm too sick for church. Some reading on the bed. Sam to dinner and supper. Go over to town one evening and get my bonnet and dresses fixed. Call to see Cousin Lou. Miss Vallant is up on Saturday.

    
## Nov. 25-Dec 1 

  Too cold for church. Have a quiet nice day with Miss Vallant. Sam here all day. He and our little Englishman have a very animated discussion after supper on the policy of the English government towards Ireland. Poor downtrodden Ireland. In considering, think that under any other rule, the Emerald Isle would be the finest portion of this globe and show that the Irish are Not capable of improvement Allow them as many indulgences as you will. Very quiet times this week. I make acquaintance with Miss Jameson. Her style of writing is very sprightly and agreeable though there is little originality about her. Finish Dr. Mahan's *Church History * and am highly pleased. Get to work on my numerous counterpanes. Commence one of worsted pieces. Mary Lewis at Mr. Maury's all this week. Very lonely in the Lodge by myself ....[Letters written and received.]

    
## Dec.2-8

  Advent Sunday. A beautiful sermon from Mr. Nelson. After church go home with Mr. Brown and am introduced to my new niece. She was born October 21, 1860. As yet no name has been decided on for her. Want it to be Mary. Spend Monday with cousin Lou and get home in the evening ....The hogs are killed this week; plenty to eat now. Mary Lewis comes home Wednesday and brings Nanny Maury who stays all the week.

    
## Dec. 9-15 

  Sunday hear Mr. Meade preach....Sam with us as usual. Cousin Sarah Gilmer and Cousin Lucy Ann Minor dine with us, an unusual procedure for cousin Sarah as she so rarely leaves her home after winter sets in. Sue sends word she will perhaps be up this week. John cannot come until Christamas week. Cousin Sarah [Gilmer] brings me a sweet book .... Wednesday Ma, Nan, Maggie and I dine at Orange Dale and have such a quiet happy day ....Find a letter on my return from Sue telling us she will be up on Friday next ....Get through with Miss Jameson's four volumes; enjoyed it much. Friday Sue and her maid Emily appear. We are so glad to have Sue with us. She is in fine spirits. Saturday we have a heavy fall of snow. David spends the day with me in The Lodge. I'm busy with the block work. Sam to supper. Rather an uncomfortable evening in consequence of unfriendly feelings between Sam and David. At least the unkind feeling and treatment is all confined to David. Sam does not know what it means.

    
## Dec. 16-22 

  No church on account of the snow and bad roads. Sue and Mary Lewis busy nearly all the week on Xmas goodies. Cousin Howel spends a night with us. I always enjoy seeing him. Some other visitors. Saturday Miss Vallant and Bob arrive. I feel very happy to have Miss Vallent with me. She is one of my few friends now. I'm glad that Bob too is willing to stay with such a quiet party as we are. Poor boy, I wish I could help him in some way but it is a hard matter to tell how to go about it. He is looking badly and I think out of spirits. Thursday the 20th South Carolina goes out of the Union. She is a gallant little state but I fear in this case she has been too hastly. When is it all to end? Troubles are beginning and we are soon to feel them ....

    
## Dec. 23-29 

  At church and hear Mr. Latane,.. "The Lord looketh in the heart." A good sermon and I enjoyed it as it agreed with a book I've been reading, *The Throne of David*.  

    
## Xmas Eve.

  Company with us: Bob, Mr. Coffman, Miss Vallant, John and Sue besides our home circle. Do not feel at all satisfied with myself. Too many hard thoughts felt and expressed against our northern neighbors at a season when we ought to feel peace and good will to all mankind. Oh, what a want of Christian charity there is in us all! What hatred in our hearts towards our own country people and we dare to ask God to prosper our side? It is true we are not the aggressors in this case but there is too much bitter hatred churned up for us to hope for a blessing.  Prejudice has taken away all of our patriotism. We have need of many prayers to ask our Friend of Friend to still the tempest in our hearts and give us the grace to see and act now as friends toward each other .

 	....[Visitors.] Panic Terrors two evening this week and we are	 all much frightened but it is all incredulous when we come to think it all over the next day. Mary	Lewis takes the part of The tragic Muse and acts her part to perfection. We all dine at Dr. Leitch's on Saturday, the only visit I pay during 	Christmas [as we] had a houseful at home during the whole time. Enjoy Miss Vallant's company much. We have such a cozy time in the Lodge. John does not get up until Xmas Day so we have a good chance at Sue before he comes and it is well we do for after he comes all other persons sank into very secondary affairs in her eyes. It made me feel very badly at first but I tried hard to keep off the green eyed monsters and I can now think of it and see it with calmness. Miss Carrie [Morril] dines with us on Friday. I was very much pleased to see her but was sorry on account of some of the others that she came. The times are too troubled to have Yankee visitors.

  	North and South don't mix well. The day she is with me, I'm gladdened by a...letter from my own dear Emily. The letter is not more than two months old but the dear child does not mention her health. I cannot help feeling that it is intentional [and] that she is not as well as she would like us to think. A great change has come over her since she settled in her new home. She has been led to think more charitably of the Low Churchmen and included all denominations of Christians since she has been working among them. The thing has proved itself. Lou, she says, "I have not changed my stand point in the least for myself but the Low Church doctrine is the only one for converting the heathens." Oh, how rejoiced some of her friends will be. Says she is very happy. Frieds write her sorrowing letters and talk of the sacrifice she has made of herself when to give up the work would be the only sacrifice she would know. The Taylors to supper one night. Jeff [Jefferson Randolph Taylor] gets in very excited on politics. Don't I wish I could never hear anything more of them again. It seems to call up all the evils in my very evil nature. Finish such a very pretty hood. The color is lavender and it is made by Miss Vallant's directions. She does the fancy part for me. She also did one for Sue and another for Sam. He intends it for a friend. Ma thinks it will be very comfortable for him when he goes from here home after suppers these cold nights. Dave is beginning to come out of his shell. The boys, Bob and Sam, play off a Xmas trick on him which seemed to hurt much at first but did good in the end. All's well that end's well.

    
## Dec. 30-31. 1860 

  Quite a party indoors: Miss Vallant, Sue, John, Sam, Bob and our household. Monday Dec. 31st the old year is spent. 

   - Tis a time for memory and for tears. 
 - Within the deep still chambers of the heart 
 - a spectre dim whose tones are like 
 - the wizard voice of time heard from the tomb of ages 
 - points its cold and solemn finger to 
 - the beautiful and holy visions that have passed away 
 - and left no shadow of their loveliness on the dead wish of life. 
 - That spectre lifts the coffin lid of Hope and Joy and Love 
 - and bending sorrowfully above the pale sweet forms that slumbers there 
 - scattered dead flowers over what has passed to nothingness. 
 - The year has gone and with it many a glorious throng of happy dreams. 
 - Its mark is on each brow; its shadow in each heart.
        
# The New Year 1861

   
## Jan. 1-5 

  January lst comes in bright and beautiful but which of us do not feel that there are breakers ahead for us? Clouds rest upon our country and in another twelve months there may be in our homes many sad changes. In all our troubles we must look to "Him who is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble." Sue, John and Miss Vallant leave us early. Bob takes his leave in the evening. Oh, how lonely it seems. Write a long letter ....Do some reading and commence school again. Wish I could get up a supply of energy and go to work in real earnest but feel feeble in health and low in spirits. I am content to let the world run on and I make no effort beyond that which is necessary to get through my daily round of tasks ....

    
## Jan. 6-12 

  No church. Roads too bad so spend a quiet day. Read *Leila Ada*, a sweet book. Commence the Lewis Family Tree though I have not yet succeeded in collecting all the materials for it. Finish reading *Charles 0'Mally* and am highly entertained. It is too good to be enjoyed all alone [so] refresh Daddy's recollections of some of the most laughable points and over them laugh together. A letter from Bob, poor fellow. It is not a satisfying letter; he does not know where to go to find real peace. Oh, that I might direct him ....[Letters written and received.] I'm in somewhat of a worry about [her sister and brother-in-law in Mississippi] Sally and Dr. Lea's letter. 'The day after it was send the words come that Mississippi had gone out of the Union. She is the third that has seceded and old Virginia remains unmoved. What can she mean?...

    
## Jan. 13-19 

  No church, a very quiet day. A letter from Aunt Ria, also from Bob written in such a more hopeful spirit. Daddy has an epistle from Mr. Douglas Forest setting forth his claims to kinship with the Meriwethers of Albemarle through the Old Parson Douglas. I am fixed upon to answer it and give Mr. Forest all the points that I know anything of. Hope he is edified. Find my dear Ma sick in bed. Bob and Sam to spend Saturday night. Nothing is talked of now but the troubled times.

    
## Jan. 20-26 

  No church. Roads too bad. Bob leaves before dinner. Sam stays until night. A long weary week to me being too much of an invalid to attend to my duties or even to enjoy reading so lying still and silent thought are my only occupation neither of which is happy, bodily or mentally. It is a great trial to have such a weak poor body and at the same time to feel the energy and spirit to be up and doing. So much bad weather but not cold enough yet for us to get ice.

    
## Jan. 27-Feb. 2 

  No church on account of the roads. I'm rather better in health. Write Bob a long and serious letter; hope he will take it kindly. Also send Aunt Ria one of my lengthy epistles. Expect she still thinks I'm very warm on politics but I can't help writing about them for nothing else is talked of around me. I've been sadly out at heart at Old Virginia's slowness in this contest for our rights, she who once rejoiced in the sobriquet of the "Flag Ship of the Nation" seems perfectly indifferent as to whether we should stay with the Yankees or go with our own brave little Southern neighbors. But I was hasty in my judgment of the dear old Commonwealth and though she is slow I feel assured the Old Spirit has not left her and when she does move her influence will be felt far and wide. Hope great things from the Washington meeting when some of our wisest men will be sent and our States Conversations will soon follow to decide whether we shall stay in the Union. I believe we can trust Old Virginia that she will secede sooner than yield one inch of what we demand as our rights. What impertinence! presumptions! in the North to imagine they can force us to stay in the Union. It is easy to conceive now what our forefathers felt when Old England wanted to make them drink tea and it did not agree with them ....[Letters received.] I am reading some very interesting essays by Peter Beyers. Read one of GPR James' [George Payne Rainsford James] novels, a tame affair. I'm deep in Mrs. Browning and "Ossian" [a third century Gaelic poet] now. Rather lonely at times, nothing to excite me but the newspapers. Taking to "Ossian" again. A long letter from Sue on Saturday ....Sam and Bob spend Saturday night. Bob does not get in until about 10 o'clock at night and was off before breakfast Sunday for home

    
## Feb. 3-9 

  No church. Some bright weather this week over head but too windy for exercise. I'm much interested in "Ossian"; what a collection of ideas but it appears to me to lack order. I would like it better to be in verses, it would be easier to keep the mind upon it. I'm low in the reading here and Sam lends me Cumming's Apocalyptic Sketches. How charming they are. His conclusions seem to me to be based upon very strong and clear arguments. Of course I can make no objections within but I have a vague indefinite idea that he makes that sealed book too plain for us mortals. It is intended to puzzle us. A letter from brother Peter who is sadly out at heart at the gloomy prospects before us. Says he expects nothing from Missouri; she is completely Yankeyed from St. Louis and [except for] one loan graveyard and the sacredness it holds he should be in Mississippi for he feels he can do nothing for Missouri. A note from Carrie Morrill enclosing a letter to her from dear little Emily; such a charming instructive letter. It made me feel so happy to read it. The dear girl has had two attacks of fever but they were slight and she soon recovered and then her health was better than it had been for two years. Gives a short sketch of her fellow laborers in the Cavalla Mission. What a worthy collection they must be. A letter from Miss Vallant. The little woman seems much quieter in mind. I wish I could be near her and see more of her for I love her very much. Answer all the letters, also write to niece Lizzie at Music Hall and a long one to Sue. Uncle Bob spends Monday night with us. Says his neighborhood is very dull. We hear that Lizzie Dee is going to give up school and return home; leaves in the hands of the Almighty when to go to school. I know it will be a hard trial for Lizzie. Ma is better and has taken possession of the keys again. She really seems to enjoy having the direction of household affairs again.  Sam here Saturday night. He brings me another book.	 I've a good supply, enough to last until the 4th of March.

    
## Feb. 10-16

  No church on account of the bad roads. The 13th is Ash Wednesday the beginning of that holy season set apart by my loved church for repenting and humiliation which calls for many prayers. Oh, that I may so live during this precious seasons that it may not pass without leaving me a blessing! Mary Lewis, Nannie and I go to town the last of the week and stay with cousin Lou and I am thus enabled to get to church once more, the first time since the Sunday before Xmas. Spend the day at Orange Dale. Also get out to sister Betty's. The little baby has grown so much and is such a sweet little thing. She is called Aurora Cornelia after two Miss Lewis friends of the family....David and Met were at Mr. Brown's Saturday night and we had a truly pleasant time. Handsome Boylen (the Bishop) was very agreeable. Mr. Brown and I have a settlement of our affairs and I pay all my debts which makes me feel quite comfortable.

    
## Feb. 17-23

  Walk down to church. Mr. Meade reads the services but is too unwell to preach. I'm much disappointed; however, hear a good sermon from Mr. Nelson at night. Monday have such a pleasant call at Mr. Nelson's asking him to interest himself about Robert, to advise and direct him in his search after the worth of the religion of Christ and he kindly promised to do all in his power.	 Get home Monday to dinner ....I'm busy getting ready for a visit to Music Hall. Mammy Eliza has agreed for Maggie to go with me. We have set next

 Tuesday (26th) if all is well to start. Dave will be our escort. 	Cousin Howel with us one day this week. Read a life of Mrs. Hoffman, the African missionary ....What testimony it bears of the power and joyful happiness of the Missionary's life. The time allowed her to work for God was short but in that short time many many were raised up and call her blessed. Finish Cummings on *The Apocalypse*. What beautiful books they are. The harmony between the prophecies and the signs of the times is very wonderful and shows a vast amount of labor and thought. Oh, that he may be correct in his opinion that the coming of our Saviour draweth nigh when our habitation shall be a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness ....Disgusted with politics and have determined not to look at the papers for Old Virginia is acting an undignified part.

    
## Feb. 24-March 2 

  We go to church in the waggon and hear Mr. Meade preach....Sam comes home with us. We have a long walk in the evening. I'm improving much in health. Monday evening Dave, Maggie and I go over to Dr. Leitch's to spend the night in order to be on time for the cars the next morning. After tea I go with Cousin Lou to her prayer meeting and hear such a fine address from a Mr. Vass. Tuesday morning take the cars for Music Hall. Sister Betty, niece Betty, Maggie Brown and little Cornelia are of the party. Find brother Jim in Orange but he returns Wednesday and brings me word that my friend Sally Williamson will perhaps join me here next week ....Do so much visiting. Go to The Creek Thursday Feb. 28th in honor of Jimmy's birthday and have a charming time. Cousin Sarsh is so well in health and spirits. She give us sherry puddings for dinner; great extravagence for the hard times. Miss Eatin was among the guests so Jimmy was pleased. We all walk home in the evening. Such beautiful weather; quite warm enough for May and it continues during the whole week. Spend Friday and Saturday at Uncle Bobs. Saturday (2nd March) Lizzie Dee's birthday. Aunt Sally and Miss Vallant out driving so we have the house all to ourselves. Bob appears very unexpectedly among us Friday night. He is looking much better; seems happier and well he may. I was mighty glad to see him at home. A letter from home this week; they are all sick. Poor little Maggie Lewis very homesick. I can well sympathize with her for I know the horrors of homesickness. I will send her up by David next week if he goes.

    
## March 3-9 

  Attend Lay Reading at Grace Church. Such very warm weather. It makes me feel very weak. I walk a great deal and I think it helps me much. The 4th of March, the Ides of March, are past and Lincoln is our President. Oh, what a disgrace! How are we even to hold up our heads again? Oh, that Virginia would only secede even now. Sister Betty and her children leave on Tuesday. Lizzie Dee is also going up so I get Maggie ready to go with her. The dear child is so anxious to get home. Feel very quiet after they all leave ....[Letters received.] Tuesday Miss Vallant and I walk to The Creek to spend the night. Cousin Howel has promised me a fish the next day at The Watson's hole but the weather turned cold very suddenly and we had to give it up; hope to have it yet before I go home. Such a nice time with Cousin Sarah. We talk much of Emily. Dear Little Emily, will we ever meet again on earth? God knows what is best for us and to his will must we submit. Come home Wednesday evening after Prayer Meeting at Church. Miss Vallant stays all night with me. Thursday night Miss Vallant and I spend together at Kinloch and Friday we are at Clover Fields where the rain keeps us all day Saturday. I enjoyed myself much at both places for it is a great pleasure to me to visit around among my friends and kin ....On my way home from Clover Fields I meet with quite an accident or rather adventure. Miss Vallant and I were walking gaily along talking on a very amusing subject when coming up to Jack's Branch which was much swollen by the late rain I was trying to jump over, fell in and got such a soaking. I did not mind getting wet but I spoiled my new calico dress; however, we had a good laugh. Saturday, the day Sally fixed upon to be up but it seems too hard. Had a note from her in the evening and she seems doubtful about coming at all. I am much disappointed. I write that I will take no excuse. Miss Vallant is with me Saturday night.

    
## March 10-16 

  At Grace church and hear Mr. Boyden....Cousin Fanny Hart told me such news from Missouri. Cousin Laurie Carr is married to a Mr. Vaughan. What will be done next! I've no right to object but I was very sorry to hear of it. Poor human nature cannot stand such tests. Well, what will we hear of after this event. I'm ready for any news from Missouri! I'm at Uncle Bob's Sunday night. Dave leaves for home on Monday. Brother Jim writes to Mr Forest today [with the family information that Louisa compiled.] Wonder if we will ever meet. I'm much interested in a *Life of Havelock*. Hear from home. Bruno is very ill with distempers. I'm in aggitation about him. Every dog of my acquaintance is either sick or has been with the same disorder. Cousin Howel fears Thomas has died as he is nowhere to be found and when last seen appeared to be suffering much. On Wednesday Miss Vallant, Lizzie Dee and I walk to The Creek to be ready on the spot for a fish the next day but this capricious weather seems determined not to give us an opportunity for by morning it has turned very cold and we have quite a severe storm during Thursday. This weather keeps Miss Vallant from her school and we all stay until Friday evening and have such a happy time. Talk politics, some work, etc. Cousin Sarah entertains us with sketches of the hours that have past. Friday Lizzie Dee stays with me. The young people have their Friday evening gathering at Music Hall and such a ball. The little boys are bashful and Lizzie Dee and I are requested to draw them out and such a frolic as we had. Oh, to think of the days when I too enjoyed such games but it's no use grieving, I've no wish to recall the past. Another letter from home. Bruno is better. How comfortable one of Mammy Eliza's long nice letters always make me feel. Miss Vallant with me Saturday night and Sunday.

    
## March 17-23 

  Lay reading at Grace Church. Brother Jim reads one of Dr. Hungerford's beautiful sermons; subject, "The Christians resting and waiting on the Lord." Sunday very cold and looks like snow. Hope they will fill up with snow at home for we are among those who got no ice. Monday the 18th did some important work .... Made my will. Feel much more comfortable in mind in organizing my temporal affairs. Oh, that I could feel as well fortified about my eternal inheritance. How unworthy and unfit for this I must ever feel. No worthiness of my own can ever gain it for me. By God's graces alone, can I hope to dwell among the blest ....Julia Lewis is with Lizzie. The snow prevents her getting home Sunday and on Tuesday she is still at Music Hall. I'm reading Hugh Mulen's *Impressions of England* and am much entertained. Tuesday night Lizzie Dee, Alice and Jimmy Lewis come by for me to spend the night at Castalia as they wish my opinion and help about a Seccession Flag that Lizzie intends raising on some high point at Castalia. I agree to go with them and have a ride behind Jimmy on Fairy. We decide that the Flag should be a facsimile of that of the Southern Confederacy with the additions of a black star for poor old Virginia!!!. It is very humiliating. As some of the demon spirits around us consider it an act of rebellion we fix upon Patrick Henry's famous words for our motto, "If this be treason make the most of it!" It is raised on Saturday evening the 23rd with quite a company of ladies, gentlemen, boys and children and dogs. It was 45 feet high and made quite a show from the public road. Take supper at Uncle Bobs and have a chat with Lydia.

    
## March 24-30 

  At church and hear Mr. Boyden....Miss Vallant is with me all Saturday and Sunday night. Lizzie Dee spends Monday night with me. My visit is now ended. Tuesday brother Jim takes me home in the Rockaway and I find them all well. Set in right to work. The garden needs me much; also my school. Cousin Lou Leitch makes us a visit this week with all the children ....Good Friday, March 29th, I attend church and hear such a beautiful sermon from Mr. Meade....Willie Meade read the service. The holy lenten Season is now past and has it brought me a blessing? Oh, how bitterly I've desired one. How few of the resolves made at the commencement have been acted upon and how many of them have come to naught. Feel that this greatest of Christian virtues, Charity, has been but little practiced by me. May God give me strength to keep a strict watch upon my thoughts and doings. Letters this week from Sue and Aunt Ria. Finish reading Prescott's *History of Persia*. Sam with us Saturday night.

    
## March 31-April 6 

  Easter Sunday. Mr. Meade preaches ....Bob and Sam come home with us from church. A walk in the evening and some chat with Sam. Easter Monday have two hands to work my flower garden but it is such a bad rainy day get but little accomplished. Cousin Lou leaves in the evening ....[Visitors.]Read *Rutledqe* this week; it is very entertaining but would never do for real life. Write to Miss Vallant, Katie and Sue. Saturday get the flower garden finished, much to my joy. The hyacinths are very fine this year. It makes me feel very dissatisfied with myself that each returning spring brings to me less of that old feeling of gladness. Oh, the Spring hath less of righteousness every year and why is it? It is that there are many cares upon my Spirit just now that may account for it in part but I'm inclined to agree with Tom Mooney that "Time who steals our years away, steals our pleasures too." Saturday Sue and John appear among us very unexpectedly ....[Letters written.]

    
## April 7-13 

  No church in consequence of the rainy weather. Do some reading to the children and to myself. The young ones are much instructed in *The Pilgrim's Progress*. In the evening I'm charmed and made so happy by receiving a letter from my own Emily; the Dear child is well and happy. It is such a nice long letter, 12 pages, and did my heart good. Oh, how interested she is in her work. A letter also from Lizzie Dee; she tells me she missed me. No particular news. Miss Vallant has some chickens and Sue Stanford [Bacon] was expected in Virginia either Friday or Saturday. I'm so glad Sue is coming among us again for we all love her much. Sue and John with us all the week. They had fixed upon Wednesday to go home but with a little begging agreed to stay until Saturday. It was well they did for it rained hard Saturday the 6th to Wednesday and the water was so high there was no crossing it and a part of the railroad was washed away so they could not have gotten off. We spend a happy but quiet week. Mammy Eliza gets Ellen ready to go home with Sue. I hope she may be satisfied for I think it will do her good to go. Sue will teach her and manage her too. Saturday they start off but do not get away from town in consequence of the railroad being washed up and soon after dinner they found their way back to Pantops. We are so glad to see them again. News Today! Fort Sumpter has been taken by the South Carolinians. The War has commenced and What is Virginia about? why won't she move?

    
## April 14-20

  No church as the old carriage has given out. Spend a quiet day at home. Uncle Alfred was buried today by his colored breathren. Some of us went up to the grave yard to hear the singing, praying and preaching and I enjoyed it all. Sue, John and Ellen get off on Monday. Sure enough, Strong News reaches us this week. War and Rumors of War! Two of the Charlottesville companies are ordered off on Wednesday night but where to no one can say. Harper's Ferry and Fortress Monroe possible points. Virginia's moving at last!!! Better late than never. Many of us are to witness some stirring scenes now. I trust the time has come to call forth all the bravery of the women as well as that of the men. The former will be called upon to give up for their country those dearest to them and this means many of them never to return until man's worst conquest is over. Oh, may there be none found who are not willing to give up all in such a cause as this. Our convocation is going on. Wrote Emily a long letter this week but am doubtful as to whether it can reach her with this country in such an unsettled state. We all expect daily to hear that the communication is cut off between North and South and my letter must sail from New York for Liberia. Do all sis Mary's Spring shopping for her but don't enjoy it. Feel too excited about the times and it seems wrong to be thinking of dress now. Attend church on Saturday and hear a beautiful sermon from Mr. Martin ....A great number of reports reach us from the scene of war but none that can be relied upon [for] people are so excited.

    
## April 21-27 

  Hear Mr. Martin again. The waggon is the only mode of conveyance and the old carriage is much finished off. We will not have many more rides in it. Sam to Supper. News today very gloomy. Promise, Daddy's beautiful horse died last night and he will be a great loss to him. Lizzie arrives to make us a visit on Monday. We have very exciting talks about the times. We are all busy at work for the soldiers. I make Jimmy Lewis and Bob a little Noah's Ark of a bag. It holds needles, thread, buttons, thimble, scissors and every thing required for mending, etc and also a little linament which I hope may not be required. Go to town several days this week to hear the news. It is a very gay place now for many bright uniforms to be seen at every turn. One day get caught in the rain and take shelter with Cousin Isabella. Lizzie is with us until Saturday morning. It is a queer kind of visit to me. I can't exactly realize that she is with us. There are so many things that I was laid off to talk to her of and show her and the whole week passes and I forget all about [them] and don't know when I'll have another opportunity ....

    
## April 28-May 4 

  No church today. Poor Uncle Stepney found dead in his bed this morning. Went to bed well Saturday night and found a stiff corpse in the morning. Truly there is but a step between us and eternity. Bob Lewis with us a good deal this week. One evening we walk to the old graveyard at the big Poplar Tree. What a scene of desolation and neglect is before us but with all its dilapidation it is a sweet spot and when remembering all the cares and troubles and heartaches that have found us, I could but envy the sleeping dead their quiet peaceful spot. Go to church on Tuesday. Bishop Meade with us. He confirmed 8 persons. The sermon is preached by Mr. Richards....It was a plain but interesting and edifying discourse. Richard Davis reads the service and I hear for the first time the President and Vice President of the Confederate States prayed for. I responded "Amen" from my heart. The old Bishop gives us an interesting instructing address. Touched very feelingly and appropriately upon this troubled times. A quiet peaceful week with the company of the last. Get some socks knit for Sam to go to the wars. Rather lazy about my reading. Begin some history; also for light reading, *The Queens of Society*. On Friday go to town. The place more quiet today than a week ago.

    
## May 5-14 

  Go to church. Mr. Meade is sick, so a Mr. Ingles (a student) reads the services and a sermon...Sue's long looked for letter came to hand on Monday. The young woman shows her colors, with a Secession Flag. Thinks it not unlikely that the epistle has made a flying visit to "Old Able." Hope he was edified, gratified and instructed in its contents. I had written to Sue the day before it appeared telling her of its non-arrival ....[Letters written.] We go to town on Thursday for the news and to do some shopping. Hear all our companies have been ordered off. The Infantry started off this morning. The Cavalry are to go Saturday-so every thing attending the ladies and machines are busy getting things well fixed as the short notices will allow. Final destination is supposed to be Culpepper Court House to guard the railroad. Jimmy and Bob come by for their shirts, bags, etc. I pack them all up and a sad task it was. They may never return but if they do it will be as a noble cousin. Mary Lewis remained in town to help on the work for the soldiers. A great deal has been done by the Charlottesville ladies and much praises are due them. A long letter Saturday evening from Sue who gives some very terrifying instances of the ill and cruel treatment received in Washington and some of the other cities by people holding Southern sentiments. By people of a Christian land? The newspapers are filled with such atrocities but these instances were told her by eye witnesses of the facts. Alas for this society of Christian charity. Sue tells me they have over 600 soldiers quartered just across the road from them and a more orderly set she never knew. Several more companies are expected up daily. Ashland must be quite lifelike just now. Saturday night 1300 troops from the South pass through Charlottesville. They are friends and have come to help us to fight for liberties.

    
## May 12-18 

  At church and hear a sermon from Mr. S1ack...The service was read by Mr. Johnston from Alexandria. Dick's fourth birthday [who] had a letter, a treat for him, on Saturday with which he is highly delighted. How little it takes to make a child of his years happy. Mary Lewis comes home from church but goes back again Monday evening to help more about the work .... On Friday I to over to sister Betty's and make her a visit of several days ....We take some long nice walks; go visiting. My nose cold is very bad. Make a good many acquaintances among the students. They are some of them very pleasant but beaux have long since lost all their attractions for me. One very young boy, Fergus Farquham, I take quite a fancy to. I'm old enough to pet little boys now. He seems to have associated altogether with ladies judging from his characteristics and there is so much simplicity of character about him. He and I get to be good friends. I'm quite surprised to see the ease with which my nieces entertain beaux, especially Susie. They are much too young in my opinion

    
## May 19-25 

  Sunday we hear Mr. Johnston preach .... At night go to hear Mr. Granberry at the [University] Chapel ....Nothing is talked of now or thought of but the soldiers and their news. From the signs of the times we must expect strong news soon. A letter from Robert but on opening it found it is to Alice and he has sent mine to her. I'm so disappointed for I felt very anxious to hear something from him. Get home on Wednesday and find Ellen there. John brought her up on Sunday. He went back the next day so I did not see him. I'm very poorly for a day and night. Friday evening I was roused up from my afternoon nap to see a gentleman who had asked for Miss Minor and on going into the parlor was quite taken aback on being greeted with a kiss by a perfect stranger. Seeing my surprise, he said, "Don't you know me, your brother, Dr. Lea?" It was all right then and oh, how glad I was to see him. He is so pleasant looking and is so affectionate and treats me so like a real brother that I feel that I can take him right to my heart. He is on his way to Harper's Ferry were he holds the office of Assistant Surgeon to one of the Mississippi regiments. He spends an hour or so with us and then I go back with him to sister Betty's where I am a fixture as long as he is with us. At Rugby we have quite a family meeting as brother Jim and Lizzie [Minor] join us Saturday. I'm charmed with my new found Brother. He talks much about his little wife. Tells me of their first acquaintance and spring time of love. It seems a hard chore to leave her so far away. Saturday sister Betty and I prevail on him to write her himself and let us add on a note. I beg little Sally to come to us while her husband is at the wars. If she comes to Virginia she may have an opportunity of taking a peep at her good man occasionally. Oh, I hope and trust she may come. How my heart has yearned toward this dear sister and how I have hoped and prayed that we might one day meet. Quite a crowd of strangers to tea Saturday night but my brother Jabe Lea accompanies all my thoughts. Hear from Lizzie Minor that Miss Vallant and Sue Stanford (Bacon) left Virginia for the north this week. I think it is best that they are away for their own comfort. [Miss Vallant is a northerner and Sue Stanford Lewis is married to at Massachusetts man, James Terrel Bacon, and lives near Boston.] The news came Friday that Alexandria had been taken by the Federal Army. The enemy have now another foothold upon our soil. This seems a strange move for General Lee to allow. Time will show which side gains by it.

    
## May 26-June 1 

  Have a soldier, Mr. Griffin, to preach. He is a private in the Amherst Company which is now quartered in our town. He gave us a good and suitable sermon ....His company filled the gallery. Brother Jabe leaves us today. It is very hard to give him up but this is not a time to keep back any treasures no matter how dear they may be to us. Sunday night I go again to the Chapel but do not get there in time to hear Mr. Granberry's text ....Get home early and go hard to knitting for the soldiers. Peg Taylor and Mary Lewis as busy as bees making shirts and pants for the Paddy Whacks. They were mustered into service on Saturday. Mr. Bennet Taylor is Captain and Sam next in command. They are a ragged looking set and the new clothes will be a decided improvement. They expect to be ordered off this week. Wrote a long letter to Sue but the mails are so scrambled that it is doubtful if she ever receives it. My nose cold still very bad. Our prospects for freedom are not so bright just now. The enemy hold Alexandria and Hampton. It is to be a hard struggle, I fear, but we have the Spirit of Right to contend with their mercenary hordes and may God in His mercy give us the victory. The Father of Lies is certainly abroad and is received by us all for of the many reports which we have heard and repeat, hardly one has even a shade of truth in it.

    
## June 2-8 

  Do not go to church. Mary Lewis away until Wednesday working for the soldiers. News from the absent. A long sweet letter from brother Jabe. He seems very busy nursing his men through the Measles. Tells me something of his camp life, its lights and shades. The heroine of the Bouquet is there. I don't know her name. A note from Bob; he seems very well satisfied with a soldier's life. Tells me he has been in six miles of the Potomac. Both Dr. Lea and Bob say that a big fight is expected in the next few days and think it's time we were dealing some blows. The dear ones tell me it's all right but I must confess to a want of faith in the judgment of our leaders when we hear of these coward Yankees creeping into Virginia at so many points and so little effort made to keep them back. Capt. Taylor's company are not to leave Charlottesville. They are to be encamped above the University. The new clothes for the Paddy Whacks have all been finished and they decidedly improved the looks of the company. A large body of Cavalry passed down the road this morning. They numbered 1800. Bedford Charlie Meriwether was one of the Officers. Their destination was Manassas Junction ....[Letters received and written.] Fergus is to leave this week for his home; his mother has written for him and his brother, Gary the silent. I'm sorry my little friend Fergus is going. Hope we may meet again in the brighter and more peaceful times. A call from brother Jim.

    
## June 9-15 

  No church. Too warm to try the waggon. Sam with us in the evening. So many trains of cars today; soldiers being sent West-East. Gen. [Harry A.] Wise in command. Hope he will fight both with his tongue and hands. A letter to Mr. Brown from brother Jabe. There is some possibility of the army at Harper's Ferry taking up the line of march for Baltimore when they get a little stronger. In a few days they expect to number 50,000. He was still busy with the measles. On Wednesday the letter from Bob written at Culpepper Court House comes to hand. A letter from Sue and the last of the week we hear from my dear little Sis. She seems very anxious to be with us but thinks she will have to wait until lst of July as she will not be able to get an escort before then. Oh, how happy I am at the prospect of having her with us so soon. Two whole weeks yet, but I must be patient. Finish reading the *Queens of Society* and *The Dolls and Beaux of Society*. Enjoy them much. Throw myself away on novels this week. Don't feel at all satisfied with myself-it is so much time yet. The Montgomery Guards leave tomorrow the 15th for Manassas

    
## June 16-22 

  Hear Mr Slack [preach.] Go to sister Betty's. We talk and think much of little Sally's coming. Go at night to the chapel and hear Mr. Granberry. Stay Monday with Cousin Lou. Find Tatiana very poorly. Pet her up; the dear little pet seems to understand all about why I care for her. Lewis has gotten quite sick again. Have a letter from Bob and Sally. Bob has moved to Occoquan; advancing on the enemy. Writes in good spirits and requests that if he falls I will see that he is buried by the side of his great grandfather Lewis under the Big Poplar. Dear boy, may I never be called upon to perform such a sorrowful task for him. Little Sally still thinks she cannot come until July. She write me a sweet loving letter. Oh, that no cloud may rise to dim our happiness in this eventful time. Cousin Howel with us Tuesday and in the evening Jimmy Brown arrives in the Rockaway bringing me word that Sally has arrived and I'm sent for. Oh, what joy. I get ready and go up to Rugby with him. Little Sis gives me a sister's welcome. My heart's desire has been accomplished. I've seen this sister that I so often pictured to myself in my sleeping and waking dreams. How many blessing are granted me! Oh, that I may be truly thankful to my Heavenly Father for them all. Sally looks much as I had imagined she would. Is a little slip of a woman but full of life and spirit. The old people all say she looks like our mother. She seems full of love for us all. I am fully satisfied with my share. I'm very happy with my two sisters. On Thursday brother Jabe arrives very unexpectedly. What a happy party we have now. He is looking badly; has a bad cough. Oh, what a dear Brother he is. I never though I could love him as such and feel so much at my ease with him. He brings me some dear trophies for the curiosity box. We are very anxious for brother Jim to make his appearance; fear Sally and brother Jabe feel slighted that he has not been	to welcome his little Sis after so long a separation. I feel satisfied that there is something of importance that kept him. Try to explain it to Sally but she doesn't know him as I do. Hope she may learn to love him as I do for he is worthy of all the affection we can bestow upon him. Saturday brother Jabe, Sally and I dine at home. I feel much gratified at the way my little Sis and brother Dr. Lea are received by my home people. Know they do it for my sake now; hope it will be for their own when they get to know them well. Go back to sister Betty's to supper. What a happy time I'm having. My sisters and brothers around me to my heart's content.

    
## June 23-29 

  We do not go to church in the morning. Have a quiet day at Rugby. Brother Jabe and I look over the letters together. What a dear brother he is. Sunday night we go to the Chapel to church and hear Mr. Granberry....My enjoyment is complete if brother Jim was only with us. Brother Jabe leaves on Thursday. His brigade is now stationed at Winchester; Harper's Ferry having been evacuated by General Joseph E. Johnston and his forces on the 16th. Brother Jabe had some funny stories to tell us of his run from Harpers Ferry. It seemed a strange move but we all assumed it was all right. Sally and I feel as miserable as rats after he leaves. Brother Jim comes up on Saturday. He seems poorly. Makes arrangements to send up for little Sis and I next week. Sally and I go to town with him on his way home and have a gay time. Lizzie Dee spends the night with us. Sally seems to take right to her. Our nieces have a levee nearly every evening. Sally and I, like thoughtful old Aunts, object much to them. They are much too young to be thinking about beaux. They had much better be at their books.

    
## June 30 - July 6

  A rainy Sunday.  A Happy day.  Sally and I come home early Monday morning.  I do so much work getting ready for Music Hall. Write to Emily and Sam. A letter from Bob. He seems contented; nothing to trouble him but his Captain. I'm very sorry they have not a more efficient one; fear they will never distinguish themselves with such a leader as Capt. D. Some more fighting this week. A sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction. Harvest is going on; the wheat is very fine. 4th of July. I am much exercised on this subject. In my opinion it ought to be buried along with the stars and stripes. Think it would be as well to give up the far famed Declaration of Independence too, for most of our present grievances may be traced to a misinterpretation of that said document and we have proved beyond a doubt the falsity of the clause that "all men are born free and equal." I can never feel any exultation for the 4th of July now. As a historical day it may still be worthy of memory but we have no further use for it as a national festival. The Comet appears! What does it purpose for us; war or peace? It is not for us to know only to watch and wait. Many rumors from the Seat of war but not reliable. Friday, brother Jim's carriage comes up for little Sis and I. We get down to Music Hall before night and feel so happy to be down home once again. Find Mr. Coffman there getting ready to go soldering. He is to be sent West with the new company from the University. I make his needle book. The love affair progresses, I think. Sally and I call at Uncle Bob's. Little Sis is much pleased with her new found kin .... [Letters received.]

    
## July 7-13 

  Go to the Brick Church and hear Mr. Nelson [preach.] Find many friends and introduce them to little Sis. Monday cousin Fanny Hart comes and spends the day and night with us. So many of the neighbors to call in the evening ....[Letters written.] We are hoping to have brother Jabe with us sometime soon. Sis and I at Uncle Bob's for a day and night. It is real fun to see Sally and Aunt Sally smoking together; they get quite sociable and chatty. Sister Betty and little Cornelia make us a visit of a few days and we enjoy seeing them much. Have a letter from Sue this week. She talks of joining us in this neighborhood if she can bring herself to leave John long enough. Bless these husbands. Says she has a button from battle for me cut from a Yankee's coat. A letter from my brother Jabe. Tells me he has found Nicky Lewis and has advised him to try and get into a private house until he can get leave to come home which he strongly perscribes as the measles has left him weak and unable to play soldier. Brother Jabe says they are all packed and ready to start at a moments notice but when or where he knows not. No chance for his making us a visit anytime soon for he would not on any consideration miss the engagement which most everyone is looking for. I'm very poorly this week but Sally nurses and pets me up so that it don't go very hard with me. Letters from home ....No news.

    
## July 14-20 

  At church and hear Mr. Boyden [preach.] See the Prince Polignac [the Frenchman, Camille J. Polignac who becomes a general for the Confederacy], the first live Prince I've ever seen. He is a real gentleman in looks. He has come to cast in his lot with us and help us to fight for our liberties. May he prove another Lafayette. We are all cast into the depths of woe by the news of Monday. The President has issued the order calling out the military. It comes too close to home this time, as my dear old Brother [Jim] thinks he will have to go, and besides being in very feeble health his family will be left so unprotected. It seems a very suspect order for we have foes around which must be kept in awe as well as Yankee enemies at a distance. Great complaints against Jeff Davis but I'm in hopes he will listen to reason and revoke this order before anybody's hurt. Monday is such a blue day. We all feel so heavy at heart. So many people imagine they hear the guns at Manassas and our hearts fail when we think of the fate of those among them who are near and dear to us. May The God of Battles be with them. On Monday evening Sis and I go up to Cousin Fanny Hart's where we stay until Friday evening and have such nice quiet times ....One day while there cousin Fanny takes us to Clover Fields to dine ....Poor Mary Walker [Randolph]. I feel much for her. Her health is very feeble; has such a cough and seems to take Tom's absence so much to heart. One morning we go down to Kinloch to call and in passing the Church remember it is prayer meeting evening. We have dinner with the good people of Kinloch and say we must go to church and set out for the occasion. Sally, as the distringuished guest, is give the handsomest bonnet that could be found and very becoming it proved. I was dyked out in a very fanciful hat with a plume. Altogether looked very ridiculous for one of my years. Cousin Fanny choses to stick to her chicken bonnet and was vastly admired for her independence. Our entrance into Church caused no little talk. Get home Friday evening and find everyone in better spirits. Brother Jim has been exempted from going to the war, indeed the order has been revoked in a great measure and according to the present interpretation Albemarle has very nearly if not quite furnished her number; she has some 21 companies in the field. The news from Manassas for last Monday was false but we had a battle the last of the week in which 900 of the Yankees are supposed to have fallen. Our loss was very small in comparison. This may be the beginning of a Waterloo fight which we expect in the next day or so. On the 11th and 12th, I think, we met with a serious loss in North Western Virginia; could not be said to be routed, only overpowered by superior number. Col . Garritson's own sister was killed. We all shed tears but cannot always expect to come off without any loss. A letter from Dave. He tells me of an increase to the cat family. Says Grandma pronounces them perfect beauties. A letter also from Jimmy Lewis written on the eve of the fight at Manassas ....[Letters written.] Finish such a big piece of block work; also help about some work for the soldiers. A great many sick soldiers in Charlottesville now. A large hospital has been established for them in Charlottesville; also at The University.

    
## July 21-27 

  Attend Lay Reading at Grace Church. Hear Nicky Lewis has come home. After dinner Sis and I go down to call on him and heard the news from Jabe. Have a pleasant visit. Nicky tells us a good deal of correspondence. It is true that Johnston has left Winchester and is ordered to join Beauregard with his forces and everything promises a big fight soon. News on Monday. We have met the enemy and they are ours. The largest battle ever fought on our shores [the battle of First Manassas or Bull Run] came off on Sunday the 21st. The loss on both sides very great but that of the enemy supposed to be three times as great as ours. We are supposed to have lost in killed and wounded at least 2,000 (no certainty about it). Truly it was a glorious victory and I hope that good may come of it at last in spite of "little Peterkin" for we hope much it may cause our recognition abroad as one of the nations of the earth and it is proof positive to the Yankees that we are able to take some care of ourselves. It seems that we can cut up the Grand Army which was enroute for Richmond via Manassas. Large quantities of provisions, military stores and implements of war were captured by our soldiers from the Barbarians. They were said to have handcuffs ready for us so sure were they of conquering us poor rebels but Holy Writ says the battle is not always delivered to the strong and so they have found it. How comforting to us that so many of the lessons appointed by our beloved Church are so appropriate to the times in which we live and in every case we could be the favored people. Surely this is not chance but to show us the salvation of our God. The night after the great battle, the lesson read in our church and in many of our home circle was Moses and Miriam's song of triumph after the overthrow of the Egyptian host. We too could sing that song for we had triumphed gloriously and God had dashed in pieces our enemy. Oh, that our Faith and Trust may ever be in Him and if He is with us we fear not what men can do unto us. Hear several letters from our boys read. They were in the fight and behaved gallantly. None of them hurt, thank God. Bob writes words that Billie Williams [his horse] has immortalized himself. Our boys took twenty big guns and about 100 Yankee prisoners. Spend the day at The Creek and at Uncle Bob's. Sally has news of brother Jabe. One of his subs, Dr. Minor, was wounded and sent up to the University to his uncle J.B. Minor and brother Jim, by accident, found him out at Gordonsville. He had a note for little Sis written from the battlefield to tell her Jabe was safe and whole. The next day came another note saying he was on his way to Charlottesville with the wounded of his brigade and after getting them set up he would come down. We are much excited. Bed time comes but no brother Jabe and we retire with heavy hearts but before we get to sleep he makes his appearance. Oh, how thankful I feel to have him among us once more. He has some very amusing stories to relate of the battle as he was on the field from the beginning until the last gun was fired. Oh, how blest a brother he is. How many blessings I enjoy; so many brothers and sisters and dear ones around me. May I be truly grateful to Him who gives them to me. Aunt Sally and some of the cousins come to see Jabe. On Friday go up to Charlottesville and spend the day at Keswick. The cars won't take me up until dark. [It is] after supper time when we get to Rugby very tired and hungry. Saturday get home bringing little Sis and Jabe with me. We have such happy times. Forgot to say had a nice letter from Sue this week. She has fixed upon Tuesday to be with us but John feared the cars would stop carrying the mail and passangers and so she gave it up. How disappointed I was, indeed all her friends were. It hurts me to thing of the long time we've been separated ....Ma a little complaining. So many beautiful kittens.

    
## July 28-Aug. 3 

  No church. A happy day. Little Sis and brother Jabe leave me Monday morning. I'm lost by myself; the first time Sally and I have been separated since she came to Virginia ....[Letters written.] Tuesday evening brother Jabe comes for me in the Rockaway. I'm so glad to be with him and little Sis once more. Go one evening to see the sick soldiers at the University. I'm also introduced to Jeff Davis, not the President but a perfect beauty of a little dog. He belongs to the 11th Mississippi boys and was one of the heroes of the battle of Manassas, being in the whole of the fight. The poor wounded sick soldiers are kindly cared for but they look so wretched it made my heart pain to see them. Saw one of the Yankee Captains who was wounded and taken prisoner. One of brother Jabe's subs took tea with us at Rugby. He was a talking chap. Thursday we try the cars again and get to Keswick and walk from there to cousin Fanny Hart's and find quite a number of the kindred there. Have a pleasant time. In the evening get down to Music Hall and take them all much by surprise but we are warmly welcomed. Do some dining out. Very quiet pleasant times with my brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews. Mary Walker has another daughter which I hear she calls Jane after Mr. Randolph's mother.

    
## Aug. 4-10 

  Attend Lay Reading at Grace Church. Quiet enjoyment. A nice long chat in the evening with Jabe and Sally. I'm afraid I'm very sadly spoiled by them; never was as much petted before and I don't know whether it is doing me any good, poor weak human nature as I am. Monday we come home in the carriage with Aunt Sally's company as far as Charlottesville where she has come to see after Lizzie Dee who has been up sometime nursing sick soldiers. The one she came particularly to care for has died. He was staying at Dr. Leitchs. Spend this week at Rugby. Brother Jabe in Richmond for two days where he went to see his Colonel who was wounded. Brother Jabe looked out John Macmurdo and made himself known to him and cousin Sop. He does not have time to go out to Ashland and see Sue which we all regreted. Saturday evening take tea with Miss Carroll ....Have a dark walk home and then sat up late getting Jabe ready to start off the next day.

    
## Aug. 11-17 

  Jabe leaves us today for his Brigade at Manassas. What changes may happen before we all get together again but we must hope for the best and trust One who ordaineth all things right. No church, spend a quiet day at Rugby. Monday I go over to town enroute for home where I do not arrive until Tuesday evening. Brought Tatianna [the cat] with me. She is very sociable and interesting; seems to know she is at home. I do not mind being slow enroute for I have an opportunity of seeing something of Cousin Lou and we have been such strangers to each other for some time past. She has been so busy with soldiers' clothes and now the sick take up most of her time. Find them all well at home and glad to see me. Ma is much better. Go hard to work as I find so many things needing my attention. It is a hard trial to being separated from Sally. When I remember how near she is and there is a possibility of her leaving us soon, it makes me feel so badly . If she does not soon come to me I must go to her. I sometimes doubt if seeing her has done me any good for she has become so necessary to my happiness and how low and sad I must feel when she leaves me for good and all but this is a wrong feeling; I must mask it. God's blessings, which he shows with so bountiful a hand along my pathway, must be enjoyed while they last and when they are gone I must have a thankful happy heart they were ever given me. Alice and Jimmy Lewis are visiting us. A note from little Sis enclosing a letter she has had from Jabe. He is regularly in camp and finds his dog Buc quite companionable. The letter made me feel rather blue. Such a bitter feeling nourished by the Mississippians towards the Virginians whom they imagine have not given them much honor for their bravery in the fight at Manassas. Hope things may be settled to the satisfaction of all parties and that right soon. A letter from Sam. He tells me of the fight and the part he played in it. Read *Indians and Sultans*; it is a strange story but so entertaining. Have done a good deal of other reading in the last few weeks but it has been mostly light reading. I can't settle myself to anything that requires thought.

    
## Aug. 18-24 

  A rainy Sunday. So lonely. Oh, if I only had little Sis with me. She is only waiting until she has her teeth taken out, then she will come to me. It seems hard for her to screw her courage to the sticking point. Well it does take some bravery to sit down and have three teeth drawn. Tuesday evening I get a note from Sis and she tells me she is sick and is pining so to see me so I conclude to go to her. I fix up and Dave drives me to Rugby in the buggy. I find Sally in bed and suffering very much with her head. She is so glad to see me. Really I feel as if I was of some comfort to her. Find sister Betty has two convalescent soldiers staying with her, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Taylor, both of them belonging to the 1lth Mississippi Brigade. They seem to be gentlemen and add much to our little circle. Poor fellows, my heart aches for them when they talk of their far off homes and kindred and how they hope and watch for the time when they can return to them. Little Sis is soon well enough to leave her room. I tell her she was only sick to see me. Have three Miss Minor's to dine with us. Sally and I have several walks to town and on one occasion go with our two sick soldiers to the University to see the Cadets drill. It is a beautiful sight. My heart is made glad this week by a letter from dear Miss Vallant. It comes by Adams Express. She does not touch our politics and tells me I must observe the same rule when I write otherwise the letter might not be permitted to pass. She and Aunt Ria are well but so uneasy about us all. They know nothing of the fate of our boys at the Manassas fight but fear some of them must have fallen. Her heart seems full of love for all her old Virginia friends. My dear old Friend, may we live to see each other in happier times. She will have a school in Williamsburg [New York] and live with her sister (Miss A) who is houskeeping. Miss Vallant tells me Sue Bacon is very miserable about her brothers. Does not know if they fell in the battle. How I wish they knew how her brothers and the others of our kin, as well as friends, were all spared. Dear Miss Vallant, I wish much to write and tell her of us all but the papers say all communication by express is stopped. A long letter from Sue, she tells me we may look for her any day. How glad I am. Enjoy myself much at Rugby. Sister Betty and brother Brown are so kind and good to me. The two oldest girls are away until Thursday when they get home escorted by Lewis Thomas. He was not killed as we at first heard but turned up some two or three weeks after we left cousin Fanny Harts. He is quite agreeable and tells me of his soldiering in Western Virginia.

    
## Aug. 25-31 

  At church Sunday morning and hear Mr. Meade [preach.] It is a great treat to go to my own church and hear my own pastor once more. In the evening Dave appeared very suddenly and tells me Sue and John have arrived and he has come for me as John will leave early in the morning and he wants to see me. So I say goodbye to my sisters, the two soldiers and the other inmates of Rugby and start for home again. Sue and John seem very glad to see me and I certainly enjoy the sight of them. John leaves early Monday and leaves Sue to us for a while. Dave brings down little Sis early in the day and I'm so happy. Am feeling very badly in health but Sally pets me so that I can't complain much. Found two invalid soldiers staying here: Capt. McFarlane of the 4th Alabama Regiment and Lieut. Clinchscalis of the 7th South Carolina Regiment. The Capt. leaves on Monday. He is a paddy boss and as a matter of course is witty and entertaining so am sorry to give him up. The lieutenant hangs fire all this week. He is very quiet and gentlemanly. I'm poorly for several days but have Sue and Sally around me so do not come to complain much. A letter from Bob; he sends me a lock from Bill Williams tail which I shall treasure up in my curiosity box. Also a long letter from my dear old friend Sally Williamson and one on Saturday from Brother Jabe. He is much pleased with his mad dog Buc. Saturday little Sis has to leave me as brother Jabe has sent for some clothes and she has to go back to see about getting and making them. [She] promises either to come back to me or else send for me the week after this coming one if all is well. It goes hard with me to be away from her even for a short time but I've Sue with me now and ought to be satisfied.

    
## Sept. 1-7 

  At church and hear Mr. Meade....See Dutchie; she talks of visiting us. I'm much interested in a *History of the Mexican War* [by] Frost . ....[Letters written.]Read this week Dr. [Joseph Holt] Ingraham's *Pilar of Fire or Israel In Bondage*. It is very fascinating like his other two but in my opinion is not equal to either of them. He allows his imagination a very wide scope .... Sue is poorly in bed for a day or so in consequence we do not see very much of her. A note from little Sis. She is wishing much for me. She sends me Jabe's fair locks for Sue to have done up for her in Richmond. Saturday Rose [Macmurdo] comes for a short visit. Another note from Sis with news from Missouri. The Federals are in Auburn and some of our kin have been badly treated by them. I'm afraid to think of the next news we may have from them. Little Sis has had the teeth taken out. Oh, how glad I am and hope to have her with me next week. Lem Clinchscalis left on Sunday the 8th. He was with us just two weeks and expressed great regret at leaving. I'm glad he was pleased.

    
## Sept. 8-14

  John comes up today for Sue. They are off early Monday. It is a mightly feeble little visit from Sue; I wish she had been satisfied to stay longer. Oh, if I only had Sis with me now. I'm very poorly again but I must not notice. She gets Jabe's box off. Monday evening little Sis comes in very unexpectly; tells me she looks for Jabe tomorrow and his orders are that I'm to be at Rugby ready to see him as he may not stay but a day or so. I'm poorly and expect the Doctor but somehow I manage to get off from the old folks by promising to go myself to see Dr. Leitch. Find a happy party at sister Betty's and all glad to see me. Jabe comes next day and is very poorly. He is confined to his room and a part of the time to his bed. We feel so uneasy about him, so fearful of fever but by Saturday decide it is nothing worse then chills and fever. I don't enjoy seeing him sick but am glad to have him with us on almost any terms. He is not himself when sick and it is most impossible to get a word out of him. We have a gay time; lots of soldiers and they play the violin so nicely. All belong to the 11th Mississippi Brigade. Two Mr. Fasts and Mr. Dorgood I get best acquainted with. Wonder if we will ever meet again. Get a letter from Jimmy Lewis, Charlotte and a note from Sue enclosing a scrap of General [G. P. T.] Beauregard's pants. Miss Rose sent it. A note from home telling me Daddy has been very poorly again ....[Write letters.]

    
## Sept. 15-21 

  At church and hear Mr. Butler....Jabe and I have some serious talk after tea. Very quiet time. Jabe poorly and out of spirits. Soldiers arriving every night; a chinquipin hunt sometimes in the evening to relive the summers of our life. Read *Romance of The Forest*; perfect trash. Jabe leaves on Thursday (mistake Friday) morning and we, little Sis and I, take our departure in the evening. Get home before night ....Find two soldiers quartered here. They belong to the 7th South Carolina Regiment: names Mr. McGhee and Mr. Moore. Both seem gentlemen in my opinion. They are quite agreeable and add not a little to our quiet circle. Find a letter waiting me from Bob; he writes in find spirits. They are now quartered at Fairfax Court House. He has been in sight of the Federal City and has seen the Stars and Stripes waving from the dome of the Capitol. I have happy times with little Sis.

    
## Sept. 22-28 

  No church. quiet walks long letter the former; kept quiet. I'm rather poorly. Do some shopping, some reading and working this week. Wrote a long letter to Jabe and also one to Sue. Had one from the former; says the movements of his Regiment are all kept quiet.

 Presume he is near Dumfries. Complains he has nothing to do in Camp [with] only two on the sick list. Sad news from Ashland. Walker Macmurdo, while out hunting on Tuesday (I suppose) in handling his gun accidently shot himself through the head and throat producing instant death. Poor Walker, we little thought when you were with us last summer your days were numbered. Truly in the midst of life we are in death. It must be a great shock to his family; the first death among a family of 11 brothers and sisters. Sally leaves me Thursday morning. How I miss her but she has promised to return in a week or ten days. She is going on Saturday to a visit to cousin Fanny Hart. I feel so useless and troubled when Sis is not with me. Captain Bennet Taylor to tea Thursday evening. He gives me hopes of our Army going into Maryland; seems to like Camp life and I'm sure it must suit him for he is a perfect picture of heath. Had forgotten to say that last week while at sister Betty's I call an evening at The Delevan House [the Delevan Hospital was the major military hospital in Charlottesville during the Civil War] to see Lizzie Lewis who is there acting as nurse in the hospital. Lizzie seems happy in her work. She took me in her storeroom which serves as Parlor for her visitors; invited me to go and see her patients but I declined [as] it looks so much like curiosity to be prancing around if I do not intend to help to nurse. I can but respect Lizzie's motives and intentions but cannot bring myself to imitate her example. Friday the day was cold and dark and rainy and not feeling in the humor for work or reading wrote long letters to Jimmy, Bob and Sue. I'm out of debt now, don't owe a dime to anyone. Bennet Taylor takes my letters to Manassas.

    
## Sept. 29-Oct. 5 

  Mary Lewis, Dave and I walk to church and hear a sermon from Mr. H.R. Scott....I enjoy both church and the walk. The papers of the last few days bring news of a glorious victory gained by our forces over the Federals at Lexington, Missouri. A large amount of money, stores and prisoners taken. Victory has now crowned our army in Missouri. The battle comes off Sept. 16th. Reports reach us that a fight is daily expected at Manassas and the region round about but up to Saturday it has proved nothing but report. Friday a long letter from Jabe. He has at last visited that time honored place, Dumfries; thinks its glory has departed. He is trying to get the appointment of full surgeon to the 17th Regt of Mississippi Volunteers. I hope he may succeed; don't want to have anyone over him and the pay is better too. That is no objection in the world. He talks of running up to see us for a day or so next week. Mary Lewis and I take a notion for quilts this week and commence two, a Chessboard and a medallion, intended to adorn the beds in the Lodge when they are finished.

    
## Oct. 6-12 

  I am too poorly for church. Such a miserable cold keeps me up in the Lodge for two or three days. Oh, how I'm pining for Sally. Such cold gloomy weather; it makes me blue. Monday a letter from Bob. He is of the opinion that Delay is fighting us a battle. Differs from me in wishing for a "dashing campaign."  Well he may be right; hope he is at any rate but I'm getting anxious for action. Doing nothing is not the best work for soldiers. Times are getting harder than I ever expected to see them. Coffee not to be had. Tea from three to three and a half dollars per pound; sugar twenty to thirty cents per pound. We have now nearly come to living on what we can make at home. All luxuries must be given up and I believe we are all willing to give them up cheerfully provided our end is accomplished vis. we are free from the Yankees. Read Charlotte Bronte's novel, *The Professor*, this week. What a mind that woman must have had. She-Miss Bronte and Mrs. Browning my two pet heroines must have had many points of character alike. Neither was really happy either in their domestic or literary avocations and while I may admire from a distance and enjoy the efforts of them mightily enough I cannot envy them. Friday Mary Lewis, Nanny, Dave and I walk to town and hear that the carriage has really been bought. What a comfort it will be to us. Get my dress fitted at Mrs. Ayers. Do some other work I have to see to and get home to dinner. Find dear little Sis here. She has come for a visitation this time. Letters from Jabe this week tell us of his promotion as head surgeon to the 17th Mississippi. He will try and take a peep at us in the next week or so. Saturday night Tom (Jabe's servant who has been up on a visit to the home of his boyhood) calls by on his way back to camp to take any parcels or letters we may have for "Master Doctor." Sally and I both write a letter, fix up some books, included a sermon and a bag of apples; hope Jabe may enjoy both sermon and apples. Had a letter from Sam.

    
## Oct. 13-19 

  No church as the new carriage has not arrived and I've lost my fancy for long walks. Do some reading and have a nice long walk with Aunt Sally in the evening. The fields and woods are now looking so lovely; some slight signs of Fall upon the vista. Nature seems to be trying on her Fall attire. Do some sewing this week. Have a long letter from Sue and sent her one in return. Friday Jabe comes and aren't we glad. I'm so glad to have him at my house this time for a visit of more than one day or night. Invite him up into the Lodge and show him my pictures and books. He and Mary Lewis get on very cousinly terms, take a kiss both at meeting and at departing. We take some pleasant long walks and he, Sally and I have such satisfactory confidential chats to ourselves in the Guest Chamber. A letter from niece Lizzie [Minor]; she tells me her Pa is better and he will try and come up to see us this week if he can. No especial news in the neighborhood. Brother Jim has heard from Sue Stanford Bacon. The letter was an answer to one brother Jim sent by Mr. Morris through Kentucky. Sue could not write anything of The Times, could only express her joy at the good news from home, the first she has had since she left in the Spring.

    
## Oct. 20-26 

  Go to church for the first time in the new carriage. Jabe, Sally, Mary Lewis and I hear Mr. Norton of the Alexandria refugees ....Monday Jabe, Sally and I go up to Rugby to finish out Jabe's visit and find them all right glad to see me from brother Brown to Cornelia. Tuesday Gen. Buc, Jabe's dog, comes up and we make his acquaintance and find him quite a well mannered dog and very good looking too. It is really funny to see Jabe petting him; pays Buc much more attention than any of the little children. News comes on Tuesday of battle at Leesburg on yesterday-21st. The victory was again ours. The papers report a large loss on the Federal side; on ours 300 including killed and wounded. Jabe's brigade was engaged. I'm sorry he was not at his post as he might have had opportunity to be noticed. He gets off on Wednesday so sister Betty, Sally and I go to the Depot to say good bye. I'm sorry we did go for the scene I there witnessed made it all the harder to say good bye. A poor woman came down on one train and her husband's corpse was brought down on the other. They met at the Depot. The distress of the poor wife was heart rending. She was on her way to nurse him and did not know of his death until she met his remains on the cars. She had a little infant in her arms, a few months old. Hers is but one of the many many sad hearts made desolute by this cruel war. After dinner, Sister Betty and I go to see cousin Lucy Terril. I'm introduced to Mr. Peters, the wounded soldier. Thursday I meet Ma in [MISSING]

  She is talking of a visit home; sent up a pretty Setter puppy to Daddy. Everyone in the house claims it and names it, consequently the poor dog's name is not decided upon for some time. A letter from brother Jim and with it some money. No news yet. They are expecting to see Mr. Coffman soon as his company has been transferred somewhere East. I would like to see him play the lover. Mary Lewis comes home Thursday. We are glad to have her back again. Ginny was not married [as] Mr. Tompkins did not appear. The times are more cheering than they have been yet. The papers say the late storms scattered the Yankee's Armada with several vessels lost. The war is getting very unpopular North with the masses. Oh, that this terrible war may be brought to a speedy termination!

    
## Nov. 10-16

  Dave spent yesterday at Uncle Bob's and comes home early this morning and brings good news. Sister Mary has a little daughter born Nov. 9, 1861, I suppose last night. Ellen Lewis writes me a note to tell me, the good news. Now a new niece born in The Southern Confederacy during the administration of Jeff Davis. Hope if she lives, she may prove a true saint, a great woman. On Sunday hear Mr. Norton preach .... a lovely sermon ....He sought to prove that those who called themselves Christians had not sufficient faith and trust in the power of His might now in this time of trouble; that the great multitudes of Christians now in the Valley of Decision were passing though a fiery furnance and while many would fall many would come forth seven times purified. I wish some of our soldier boys could have heard it. It might have brought comfort to their ears ....Ma is off on a visit. Make Met a new Cap; not pleasant work. Sally very poorly in health and spirits. Friday the 15th [is] the fast day appointed by President Davis. Sally and I take a walk to town escorted by Dave on foot and Daddy on Pat horse; have a hard time. Ma gets home Saturday and brings word they have a sick family at Music Hall; measles and fever and other ailments. David Crocket [a servant] is very ill with fever. The baby is to be called Annie Laurie after her two grandmothers. Brother Jim and some of the children wanted her called after me but the majority were in favor of honoring the Grandmothers. Brother Jim thinks Sally and I had better not come down now as we could be of no use in the way of nursing and there is danger of our taking the fever. I feel much trouble about them all to think of the dreaded measles and so many to have them; all the children and most of the servants. But we must not grieve too much o'er coming evils but trust all to Him who does not willingly afflict any of his people.

    
## Nov. 17-23

  At church and hear a Mr. Quimby [give] a very practical discourse. Letters this week from Bob and Sam. They are both at Centerville. Sam's brigade is now stationed there. Bob has been detailed from his company to the commissary department and was left at Centerville while his company went on to Leesburg. Both were in good spirits; seem to have an earnest desire to see home and its inmates once again. I hate to think of Xmas coming and our boys so far off and likely to be at that season of festive merriment. For my part I would like Xmas to pass unheeded for there will be so many missing and so much to sadden us all. Sally and I walk to sister Betty's on Friday and stay until Sunday. It was a long walk for two such feeble people as Sis and I but we felt no inconvenience from it and had a nice visit. All the household was glad to see us .....[Visits made.] We them call at the Delevan to see Lizzie Dee. She seems much pleased at the sight of me; says to see any of her kin and home friends does her so much good. She spends Saturday night at Sister Betty's with me and we have much to talk of. She tells me of her work, its heights and shadows; seems to be happy though there are trials connected with it but she says so long as she feels and sees that she can do any good she means to persevere and truly she will have her reward. The cup of cold water that she administers to poor suffering humanity will, I doubt not, be returned to her sevenfold. Her deeds of love and mercy are all recorded by One who never allows a word or deed of kindness to go unrewarded. Find a merry party at Rugby Saturday night ....Have some nice music. Brother Brown has a corn shucking so it would be hard to decide whether there was more noise in or out of doors. News! Edward Mead and Emily Burgoyne were married this week. What a funny match, as sister Mary would say.

    
## Nov. 24-30 

  At church in the morning and hear Mr Meade. A regular stir up (the Sunday after Stir Up Sunday) about the indifference shown to attending church; such a slight excuse serves so often to keep one from church. He was right. After church Mary Lewis and I go to Dr. Leitchs to stay until Monday. After dinner little Sis joins us and we have a nice time together. Go to church after supper and hear Mr. Nelson....I'm very poorly after I return. Dr. Leitch sends me up a composing draught which quiets me for the night and am better by the morning. Walk home Monday to dinner and get to work. Little Sis does not return with me; she goes back to sister Betty's but promises to come to me again next week if all is well. Get along nicely with my work. Make a dress for Mammy Nelly and work up all the materials for the calico quilt. A letter from Jabe. His Regiment is now about two miles from Leesburg and he wants to come to us for Xmas and then take Sally back with him; is anxious for me to go too but the old folks won't hear of it so I don't expect to see camp this winter. [He] reports General Beauregard is sick. Consoles with me on the death of my pet Peck. He thinks I ought to find much comfort in knowing he Peck died in harness. A martyr to the rat cause, he died battling bravely in a cause to which he had been early dedicated. Wrote Sue a long letter. A letter from brother Jim. Good news! Crocket is better though not yet out of danger and no new cases of measles and as now two weeks have passed since the first, hope the rest have escaped it. Brother Jim thinks of coming up Monday if the invalids continue better and writes for me to met him at Rugby Monday night as he wants to see something of me and he can only call by on his way home. I must try and get there from Church on Sunday ....Mary Lewis and I read a good deal in "Motley." Work on the quilts. Expect to get out of work this winter; not finish the quilts but work up the materials I have on hand. The times are rather gloomy. Yankees getting all around us; our commissioners, Mason and Slidell, prisoners in Fort Monroe. It is so doubtful if England notices the insult offered by boarding her vessel and taking off the Southern Commissioners. For a similar offense, she fought the War of 1812 but as policy not regard for the right governs The Court of St. James it is doubtful whether she resents this insult or not.

    
## Dec. 1-7 

  Hear Mr Meade preach ....a good sermon. Advent Sunday and communion day. Go afterwards with little Sis to Rugby to meet brother Jim by his appointment Monday night. I'm glad to be with my sisters. On Monday Sally and I go out visiting ....How much pleasanter this life would seem if we would all study good natures, always to have a kind word for our fellows brings It don't cost anything and how much lighter hearted we feel after a friendly greeting. Sally, sister Betty and I suffer a severe disappointment in the non-arrival of brother Jim at the time appointed. We look for him until dark. There is one comfort, it may be a pleasure deferred. We hope for some day this week. Brother Brown brings us home Tuesday evening and go to my usual work-teaching, reading and sewing. Walk to town one day this week. Good news from Jabe. He hopes to get a leave of absence for 30 days soon so we hope to have him with us at Xmas. Wrote a long letter to Bob and had one from Sue. She is talking of coming up soon ....[Other letters written.] Poor little Sis has such a terrible headache tonight; not able to appear at supper ....

    
## Dec. 8-14

  Hear Mr. Quimby [preach.] I like the sermon. Say good bye to dear little Sis with a heavy heart. Oh, how I wish we could be together all the time. Feel blue when I get home; try hard to shake it off. Monday just as I finish school brother Jim's carriage drives up. He stops long enough for me to fix up to go with him to Rugby and to get a snack from him and Tommy [his son, Thomas S. Minor.] We stop in town to do some shopping for sister Mary. Brother Jim reports her as well; tells me Annie Laurie is fast growing into the good graces of her kin. Lizzie did not know what to do about her at first, she has no fancy for infants but her little sister is gaining ground in her love and good opinion. Sister Mary sends for Sally and I to spend Xmas with her and we want to go but feel troubled about going right into the fever. John and Crocket [slaves] both have it now. Hope; however, they may be much better and no new cases and then we may visit during the Xmas week or else soon after. Oh, how shocked I was to see brother Jim's altered looks; face so thin, eyes sunken and a stoop in his shoulders, quite like an old man.  It makes my heart ache to think about him. I'm so uneasy and troubled. I must go to him as soon as possible. So glad to be with little Sis again. We enjoy ourselves. Brother Jim and I have much talk of each other, business, family matters and every day concerns. Arrange some money matters. Stay at Rugby until Wednesday when we go back to Pantops. He takes a snack and then is off for home. I go to my work, school, sewing etc, etc. Mary Lewis, Nanny, Dave and I walk to town one morning this week and do some shopping. I get a new silk dress to answer in the place of calico. Meet my two sisters and have a chat and a laugh.  No news as yet from Jabe; hope he shall turn up in the next day or so. Write Sue a long letter and a letter from her this week. She has set tomorrow week to come up. I want to see her very much. A letter from Bob. He has seen Jabe.

    
## Dec. 15-21 

  At church and hear Mr S1ack ....A beautiful sermon and suitable for the season, Advent, the coming of our Lord .... See little Sis; no Jabe yet but she has heard from him and he has not yet gotten a leave of absence, which is the cause of his delay. Mentions having seen several of the Albemarle boys. Sue writes she may be up this week. I do some work, make my dress. Am also poorly. Hear on Sunday of another victory for us over the Yankees, a Battle on the Allegheny at Ghost Mountain on the 13th. Our loss small compared with the Yankees. News from England. She demands the surrender of Mason and Slidell. What is to be the next move I wonder? Conjecture is busy at work; can but hope it may lead to a rupture between Johnathan and John Bull. A letter from Music Hall. Brother Jim is in bed. The servants are better. Mr. Coffman is with them as his company has disbanded. I'm very poorly. On Friday Jabe appears. He got to Rugby on Tuesday. He spends the day with me and is looking much better than when last with us. He has a furlough for 20 days so I hope to see much of him. Saturday Sue and John come ....but John has to leave the next day. He has a right hard time of it. Had hoped Jabe and Sally would have joined us today but they do not come. Hear afterwards they go to brother Jim's as he is thought so poorly. Hear we have had a small fight at a place called Dranesville in the neighborhood of Centerville on Friday 20th in which a small number of our forces were engaged against three or four times their number of the cavalry in which we were considerbly worsted. We hear it is thought as many as a 150 killed and wounded. The loss of the enemy is supposed not to be as large. Hope that estimate may reach us soon.

    
## Dec. 22-28 

  At church to hear Dr. Quimby....I'm so unhappy about brother Jim; hear he continues poorly. Monday go up to Rugby to meet Sally and Jabe who come back from Music Hall on that day. They leave brother Jim more comfortable. We decide to go down to him the first of next week. Hope Sue will decide to go with us. Spend Xmas Eve at Rugby. The nieces have some beaux, a dance, some games, an eggnog and altogether a gay time. I'm happy to be with my sisters and brothers but can't get up anything like gaiety. That feeling has long since departed ....Xmas Day go to church and hear Dr. Harold....The church is very pretty with the Xmas greens. The motto "The Prince of Peace."  After church leave the Rugbyites and go home. Such a quiet Xmas, even the children seem to make less noise. Beautiful weather which I'm glad of on the darkies account. Sally and Jabe dine with us on Friday. I enjoy them as a matter of course but they are not to stay all night. Decide upon a meeting at the Depot in town on Monday morning to take cars for Music Hall. Sue and I think of spending Sunday night with Cousin Lou so as to be on the spot Monday morning. No improvement in brother Jim. Jabe takes up his pickle with him. We are having such happy times with Sue. Can't help thinking and grieving very much about brother Jim's sickness. I fear I am not long to have him with me; he is soon to be called to his rest. May my Father in Heaven help me to bear up under this heavy burden without murmuring and to feel in my heart His will be done. Finish [John] Motley's *Rise of the Dutch Republic*; it is deeply interesting. Mary Lewis and I read most of it aloud.

    
## Dec. 29 -31 

  Sunday at church and hear Dr. Harold.... Sue and I go to Cousin Lou's to spend the night but after dinner she has a message from home that John has come up and the carriage is sent for her so I'm left all by myself. Have a pleasant night with cousin Lou and Nanny. Meet Jabe and Sally at the Depot the next evening and in due time arrive at Music Hall. Find the invalids more comfortable. Brother Jim looks very badly but he thinks there may be some improvement in his case from *strong drink*. He is confined to the sitting room; rides out warm days but is very feeble. Sister Mary is in the dining room to her meals. The new niece is a little beauty, minus Tommy's nose but there is room and time for improvement in that. Sam comes to us Tuesday and altogether we have a select party. Our friends call. We have invitations to go out. All hands from Uncle Bob's and the well ones from Music Hall meet at The Creek one night to welcome Jimmy home; have a gay time. We have eggnog and oysters. Jimmy seems but little changed to me; is the same gay hearted boy that he left and seems so happy to be at home. Sally, Jabe, Sam and I dine one day at Kinloch ....Leave Sam all night and I go back with Jabe and Sally. We expect to have a frolic at Uncle Bob's Saturday night but the weather is too bad to go out. Finish off, with Sam's help, Jabe's monkey cap. He is pleased with it; hope it may be a comfort to him during this cold weather while in camp. We have a call on way from Gen. Buc, assisted by Tom. I had forgotten to say that Lizzie Dee was down .... The New Year! Ah, such a feeling of hopelessness comes over me, a dread of looking forward, as though the burden of looked for trials were more than I could stand up under but this is sinful. Where is my Faith in that Strong Arm which can make every cross light?

  -        "There is a cross in every lot
 - 	     And an earnest need for prayer."
       
# New Years 1862

   
## Jan. 1-11 

  Mr. Coffman comes back on the 3rd of January. He, Sue and I had some of the old hymns in the sitting room after supper. He has many stories to tell us of his camp life. Opens his school on Monday, for scholars has Uncle Bob's and brother Jim's children and William Black; some others are expected. Jabe leaves early this morning (5th) for Leesburg ....Poor little Sis, it seems a harder trial this time than ever ....No church....Sue says good bye for home on Monday ....Sally is duly installed housekeeper this week. Sister Mary is not so well and brother Jim is poorly again so we have quite a blue household. A wedding on the carpet. Alice and Jimmy [Lewis.] The latter tells us about it Sunday but he has not asked the old ones yet. Our sympathies are much excited this week by the receipt of a letter from cousin Laurie Vaughan to brother Jim telling him she was again a widow. The town in which she lived, Occola, was burnt to ashes and her husband shot down in the streets and she, her step daughter and a daughter of brother Sam's who was living with her were obliged to fly to Fayetteville, Arkansas from which place she writes telling him they are there without friends, money or means and asks that he will send her the means to get here or else to Holly Springs. Wants him to keep Lydia Minor [brother Sam Minor's daughter] until she can be sent to her father; says there is no communication between the place in which she is now and Pike County [Missouri, where Lydia's father lives]. It is indeed a sad case and one which we have no right not to respond to for in these times of war and desolation we, none of us, know how soon we too may be needing the charities of this cold world. Brother Jim sends her the required aids through a friend of his in Memphis, Mr. Royster. I write to cousin Laurie to stay where she is until the money reaches her as there was of necessity some delay in sending it off as he had to hear from cousin John Thomas in Richmond .... Well the wooing has sped bravely. Jimmy and Alice are to be married Saturday morning and he goes off to the wars again. Sally and I dine with the Pegrams this week; have a good dinner and a pleasant day. The Creek people to visit us. The evening before the wedding (Friday) Sally, Lizzie and I spend at Castalia where we have a merry time. Quite a number of young friends of Alice's to see the last of her. Saturday morning as soon as Mr. Boyden could be got there, they were married. Mr. Boyden made the service as short as possible and he blundred surprisingly little for him. They did not have a ring. Such a liberty, I think, with our beautiful service but Jimmy said the town of Charlottesville did not offer one that he was satisfied with. After the ceremony breakfast came on; then a large cake was cut up and then they were off to the Depot to say goodbye to Jimmy. Poor fellow, I felt sorry for him, but he knew all before he took unto himself a wife. Said he did not expect any of his comrades would believe him when he told them he left a wife at home but the wedding cake he carried would prove it. How events have crowded themselves in this week; a death, a wedding and aching hearts. Ah, well, such is this life, dark and bright. My dear brother seems worse again. Don't believe he has any hope for himself. [He] seems to be making every arrangement considering his wordly affairs, literally setting his house in order. All his thoughts seem to turn on dying and so truly does he know in whom he believes that the King of Terrors seems to have no terrors for him but oh the aching hearts he shall leave behind. May God in his mercy spare me now this bitter cup but if so it seemeth good in His sight not mine but thy will be done.

    
## Jan. 12-18 

  At church and hear Mr. Boyden....A solemn warning of mis-spent times. Spend Monday night with Aunt Sally enroute for home. Sally and Alice have to come up to do some shopping and it was proposed that I should come by home and take a peep at them all. The morning is bad, so we do not get off until the middle of the day. Get home before night and find them all glad to see me but Sue and Mary Lewis are in town which is a great disappointment to me. I had been much troubled about Bruno, as I heard he had been caught on a sheep. Daddy does not think he had anything to do with it and was only in company with the other dogs. The low bred curs were punished but my pet was allowed to go scot free. Hope he won't offend again; shall advise him to be more choice in his company hereafter for evil communications etc. etc. Sue and Mary Lewis get home Wednesday evening so I have a peep at them. The carriage comes by Thursday for me and we get back [to Music Hall] sometimes before night; find the invalids better.

    
## From the 17th of January to the 16th of March I kept no Journal.

  [I] could not take it with me; am sorry now I did not make a note of the many events that were daily occuring around me as their exact dates would be a gratification to me now. I can only sum up the most important:

  Sister Mary is very poorly most of the time. She gives up the the baby to Miss Pidy Johnson who keeps her up in Lizzie's room and cares so kindly for her. The little thing grows fast and is so sprightly. Sally acts as Brother Jim's nurse and is of so much comfort to him; indeed, I don't know what the household would do without her. She is all things to them all-servants, baby and the dear sick Brother. After the first few weeks she stays in his room at night as it is necessary for Sister Mary to get regular sleep in her weak condition. Little Sis and I have some hours of real enjoyment ....There is so much that I can talk so freely to her about. We have nice times in our room when she is not needed to attend to the invalids; do some little visiting but our hearts are too sad about the Dear Brother to enjoy it fully. I fear I'm but little comfort to him in the way of nursing or help, being poorly in health, but he seems to like to have me near him and talks very confidentially to me. Indeed I flatter myself that I'm one of the few that really know him. I do a quantity of writing both for him and Sister Mary; notes for her and letters and papers of all kinds for him. When I first got down at Xmas he seems to have no hope for himself, has made every preparation to die but we tell him it is sinful and it is his duty to make every effort to live, for the doctor tells us the worse symptom of his disease is his bitter despondency, so he seems to try and cheer up and at one time I believe he really thought himself better and talked so hopefully. At one time, about the middle of Feb., took a notion that visiting would do him good so we went to The Creek one Saturday, the 15th if I remember rightly, and stayed through Tuesday. He seemed to get better in spirits if not in body. Cousins Sarah and Howel were so kind and did all in their power to make our stay pleasant. Indeed cousin Sarah seems to look upon him as an elder son and she never missed an opportunity of doing him a kindness and Cousin Howel too was so kind. He came two or three times a week to see him. Indeed the neighbors all were very attentive. Mr. Pegram, in particular, was of such comfort to him. He came often and always made it a point to talk to him of his soul's welfare and to a man who believed himself nearing that point "where we lay our burdens down" this talk was most acceptable [as] he told me .... Mr. Boyden too was so attentive, indeed all were.

  We were all very hopeful of him-some symptoms of his disease were improved but still he seemed to grow weaker. Sometime about the first of March [he] took to the chamber. Heretofore he had always stayed in the sitting room; had a couch in there that he could lie on when tired but finally got too weak to move from the chamber. Every day or so he would walk, if strong enough, to or be lifted in the rocking chair into the sitting room for a half hour or so but soon wanted to be carried to the chamber. His patience during	the whole time commanded my admiration. He talked to me so often about dying; seemed to know no fears for himself for he had long since set his house in order and all seemed right to him. He knew he had much to hope for, for few men have as happy a home as he but	if it was God's will he was willing to give up all. All he feared was that he was not patient enough under the trials of sickness. One Sunday night I remember his talking so much about dying and concluded by repeating that beautiful hymn of Moores, "There is nothing true but heaven." The last verse seems to strike him more.

   - 	"Poor wanderers of a stormy day 
 - 	From wave to wave we're drive 
 - 	And fancy's flash and reasons ray 
 - 	Serve but to light the troubled way. 
 - 	There's nothing calm but Heaven."
   Yes, he has now found that calm. I never saw him give way to his feeling but on one occasion when his little baby girl was brought to him. He took her into his arms and burst into tears. That upset both sister Mary and I and he never saw the child that he did not say "I love little baby, poor little baby." Often Sally and I would say, "Why do you call her a poor little baby for I'm sure she seems to be in the enjoyment of every comfort?" but he would never reply. We felt and feared that he meant she would so soon be left without a Father's care but tried to persuade ourselves that he meant she had not so much attention paid to her in consequence of his receiving so much care and attention. He talked so much to his children about dying; begged when he was gone that they would not cease to talk about him, to make his name a household word, to visit his grave daily and put flowers in their season on it. Oh, how thoughtful he was of me, imagined when he got worse I suffered more. Indeed it always so happened. I tried to be brave and not give way but he seemed always to know when I was suffering. And on more than one occasion when I was feeling so miserable about him, I was called into him and he asked me either to go to Charlotte, Aunt Sally or Cousin Sarah and spend the night for him [as he] would feel better satisfied about me and I've gone with such an aching heart but I felt it my duty to do anything he asked. I sometimes thought I had better be at home for any comfort I gave him but he now seemed willing for me to leave him. I believe he liked to have me about him though I was of no use. I believe I was the favorite sister though both the others could be of more account to him but I considered it my right, not that I believe I was more deserving of his love, but both the others have husbands to care for them and I was all alone. His wife says he thought more of me and my comfort than anyone in the house. I feel that it was a great comfort and privilege to be with him and to see how calmly he could prepare to visit the King of Terrors for he seems to have lost all fear of him. So convincing is it to me that a Christian alone can feel this. God grant that this trying time may be to my soul's good! About the last of January or first of Feb. (I don't remember exactly) we had a visit from Mr. Buchanan of Missouri. He came on public business. Quite a triumphant coming back for him for he left Virginia a poor wanderer and returned as a colonel in the Confederate Missouri army. I never imagined I could be as glad to see him but he brought us the latest news of our Missouri friends. My brothers he says are all right and most of the other kin. Brother Peter is in [Sterling] Price's Army; was wounded in the foot in the battle of Lexington, [Missouri.] He left Cousin Laurie Vaughan in Arkansas; seems to think her condition was not so bad as she had imagined it. He expected to find Lydia Minor with us as Cousin Laurie had started her some time since. We feel a little uneasy about her but know not what to do. Mr. Buchanan seems very hopeful that Missouri will finally succeed in gaining her independence with Price for her governor. It was a great treat to Sally seeing anyone from Missouri as she had so many to ask for. Some few of her friends she heard were on the wrong side but most of them are right side up. Soon after Mr. Buchanan's departure we had a long letter from the dear old Col. Brother. He wrote from Arkansas where he had gone to look after Cousin Laurie. He writes in fine spirits about the future; still belonged to Price's Army. Gave a desolate picture of the ravages the Feds had practiced upon the Missouri homes wherever they had been. As there is a just God in Heaven, what a long reckoning theirs will be at that day when all men will be called upon to give an account of their actions! In the meantime we hear from Lydia she is in Amherst county with Mrs. George Vaughan and her friends. We expect her over but sister Betty stops her in town and she stays at Rugby for about three weeks. I'm sorry she was stopped for I felt anxious for her to see her Uncle Jim while he was well enough to enjoy her. During this long time I've had frequent letters from the dear home ones. They say they all want to see me much but still think it my duty to be here. Oh, how often I am with them in thought and would be there if I followed my own inclinations but I know I ought to be here and if my dear Brother does not get well it will be a consoling thought to me that I was with him through his sickness though I do often sigh for home. Mr. Coffman commences school the first of January. The children all get on so well. Willie Black is the only boarder but the school was given up about the lst of March as the militia was called out and Mr. Coffman, not wanting to go with them, joined Carrington's Artillery.

    
## March 16-22. 

  Sally and I spend the night at Castalia ....No church. Young Bob got home from the wars late Saturday night-15th. He had been sick and came home to recruit. He paid us a visit at Music Hall early Sunday morning; is looking well and seems glad to be among us again. He and Sally have quite a pass of words as to who is the rightful hero of the Leesburg fight. Sally goes up Monday to town to visit the new niece ....She comes back on Wednesday bringing Lydia with her. We are all much pleased with the little stanger. She is about 16 but is a perfect child in manners and feeling; is anxious to do all we recommend. Brother Jim is rather more unwell this week. Does not improve as fast as we hoped. I fear we are too hopeful. Have some nice little visits to Uncle Bobs. It revives my spirits to go over there; we are all so sad at home. This week we had a great many reports of The Army of The Potomac falling back from Manassas. What can it all mean? On Saturday evening I take Lydia to Castalia to spend the night and to see her kinfolks ....

    
## March 23-29 

  No church. The roads this winter have been very bad; hardly possible for a carriage to get over them. I'm afraid I will get to be quite a heathen so seldom have an opportunity to go to church. A lecture from brother Jim on some of my short comings. Mean to try and do better. Also a very confidential and comforting chat with him which set my mind much at ease ....Dave came back Monday from a trip to Cousin Peter Johnson's where he had been visiting. Brother Jim lent him a horse and he was to have been back more than a week ago. We concluded he had been pressed into service at Gordonsville. I wrote to Cousin Peter to know something about him but he, Dave, turned up before my letter had gotten far. Dave saw Jabe in Orange and he sent word he would be with us in a few days. A large part of the Army from Manassas are now quartered in Orange. People all around are getting very uneasy for fear we are to be overrun by the Yankees. I feel no fear myself with the Army of the 21st of July between us. Great excitement about the militia being called out. Mr. Carver [the overseer of Music Hall] will have to go though brother Jim is trying to get him off. Mammy Eliza writes me word Mr. Dowill [the overseer of Pantops] has not gone and they think they can get him off as a police is necessary in the neighborhood so few gentlemen are left around them and there are so many blacks ....As I can't go to church this Holy season, I try to make my reading as profitable as I can; have read some beautiful books, among the *Susan Wilborne*, a book that I've wished much to read as my dear Emily recommended it to me while she was living in this neighborhood. I read also *Divine Contentment*, a dear little volume and which gave great comfort to brother Jim, *Practical Reli*g*ion Exemplified*, an interesting and edifying book, though its tendency was towards high churchism. I'm now reading *Precious Thing of God*. Brother Jim better the last of the week and in good spirits. Sally and I look all the week for Jabe and wonder why he is so long in coming. Sally is uneasy, as she has had no letter but the cars and railroads belong to Jeff Davis now and letters are very uncertain.

    
## March 30-April 5 

  Sunday a bad day. The heaviest sleet I can remember. Quite an excitement Sunday night. After we had retired for the night, a knock was heard at the door. We concluded at once that Jabe had come. Lydia and I rushed down stairs in our night riggin but we jumped at the conclusion too soon and was doomed to disappointment. It turned out to be one of the young Magruders. Brother Jim thinks I had better make a little visit home now as he is much better and Jabe writes word he sees no chance for him to get off, so I fix on Tuesday but Monday night Jabe arrives very unexpectedly so I give out going just now. Jabe is very poorly; is confined to his room part of the time. Indeed he got off on sick leave. We are so happy to see him but sorry to see him so poorly but better have him sick then not at all. Brother Jim not so well from the middle of the week. He is more feeble then I've seem him yet. Jabe's won't give me much satisfation about him. I believe he thinks it a hopeless case. For a week past some symptoms of his disease have changed entirely. He has now terrible vomiting spells. It is difficult to keep anything on his stomach. I fear it is a change for the worse. A letter from home and one from Bob. He is now near Warrenton. A visit from my Black Mammy. It made me feel real happy, the sight of anything from home .... Miss Pidy leaves us Friday as her mother is sick and needs her care ....I'm sorry on the baby's account but she is a good little thing. Seems almost to know there are aching hearts around her and it was expected of her not to add to them. Mr. Coffman back for a few days, he is trying hard to get Mr. Carver off. Jabe, Sally and I take tea at Uncle Bob's one evening, the only visit he makes during the time he is up. We have nice times after we go upstairs at night. Lydia's and my room we use as a parlor; have a nice fire. He and Sally sit around and enjoy their pipes and we talk and read until bedtime. Since Brother Jim has been so sick we have to go to our rooms about dark so the house can be quiet so we got quite in the habit of entertaining our lady visitors in our chamber. Jabe was the only one of the male tribe who was permitted to invade our sanctum.

    
## April 6-12 

  Sunday a bright day, but no church ....Feel very anxious about brother Jim, he is certainly getting weaker every day though his spirits are good. So much rainy weather this week. Jabe does not get off until Thursday. He hears at Gordonsville that his Regiment has gone to Richmond so he has followed on horseback. Hope he will not get into any trouble. Thursday Brother Jim seems to be about the same. He seems anxious for me to have that visit home but says I must come back soon. Friday he arranges for Jimmy to drive me up Saturday. Talks very cheerfully about it. I'm with him a good part of the day but in the evening Sally and I go to Aunt Sally's and take supper as I want to see them all before I go up. We get back about sundown and Sister Mary tells us brother Jim has been suffering much while we were away. Still we did not apprehend that he was worse. Sally stayed with him during the night and as was her habit came several times to my room. Now early in the night she carne up and told me brother Jim talked and looked very strange; had had a terrible vomiting spell after which she thought he fainted. I tried to believe it was the effect of the opium which he took in quantities. Sally said if he did not soon get quiet she would send off for the doctor. About two o'clock she came up again and told me he was sleeping very sweetly. I felt satisfied then that all was right. On going down to breakfast the next morning I found Sister Mary and the rest as cheerful as usual. Sally reported that brother Jim had rested badly early in the night but had been sleeping soundly since before two o'clock. He was then still asleep rather an unusual thing for he generally took his breakfast early. In the meantime my things were packed for home and the carriage at the door but I felt that I could not start until I had told the dear Brother, Good Bye. Had been into his room several times but he still slept. In a little while I was sent for in the chamber and on going in saw directly that something was the matter. Sister Mary and Sally were both weeping. Sally said to me, "Lou, you must put off your going home now. We fear brother Jim is very much worse." She said sister Mary concluded it was time he had his breakfast and said he must be wakened but when they tried to rouse him he was perfectly unconsious of all around and then for the first time we felt that the sweet sleep was the sleep of death, that his awakening would only be in a brighter, fairer world. How glad I felt I had not started. The house was soon filled with kind friends and though their sympathy was sweet they could bring no real comfort to the many aching hearts. The doctors said he had been dying all night. Dr. Douglas as soon as he saw him seemed to feel there was no hope but cousin Tom [Meriwether] with his kind heart worked on him to the last. All through his sickness, his only fear was that when called upon to "cross that dark room" his flesh would rebel and there would be a hard struggle ere his spirit could take its flight but, Thanks be to God!, his last hours were as calm and peaceful as the sleep of happy childhood. It seemed like going to sleep and waking in heaven. We watched by him all day and though his breathing was very perceptible he was not conscious once; lay in this condition until after sundown when his breath left him and all that was left to us on earth of that much loved Brother was the emaciated tabernacle of clay. Wood's poem on "A Death Bed" was now a reality to me.

   - "We watched his breathing through the night 
 - His breathing soft and low 
 - As in his breast the temor of life 
 - Kept heaving to and fro! 
 - So silently we seemed so speak 
 - So slowly moved about 
 - As we have lent him half our powers 
 - To eke his hiving out. 
 - Our very hopes belied our fears 
 - Our fears our hopes belied 
 - We though him dying when he slept 
 - and sleeping when he died 
 - And when the eve came dim and sad 
 - And chill with earthly showers 
 - His quiet eyelids closed-he had 
 - Another morn than ours."
   We have much to comfort us in giving up this dear Brother for he was a Christian not only in name but in thought and deed. He had long since put his house in order and only waited for his Master's call and when that call came he was found ready. The voice at midnight came. He started up to hear. A mortal arrow pierced his frame. He fell--but felt no fear.

  We committed to the earth all that remained of him on Monday the 14th of April. Lizzie and I picked out a sweet spot for him in the little graveyard in the garden. He sleeps by Uncle Jimmy's [James Hunter Terrel] side. We thought that would be his choice. Had our beautiful church service read. Mr. Boyden made some very pretty and appropriate remarks on the Chapter read. Lizzie and I requested he would not preach a sermon as we had so often heard him say he did not wish any. Lizzie through it all acted like a brave woman. I know how dear her Father was to her and bitter it was to her giving him up but for her Mother's sake she seemed to try to keep up and she acted her part nobly during all of that trying scene. Poor Sister Mary. Hers is indeed a loss. She tried hard to bear up but at times her burden seemed too heavy for her but few wives had such a husband as hers. She looked to him for advice even about the most trivial matters. So much more now will she feel her loss. I trust the Comforter is with her and has left some of his sweet peace in her heart but time alone can heal the wound. May God in His mercy not leave her comfortless. The dear boys grieved much at giving up their Father for they were tenderly attached to him. They cannot know now what a loss theirs is. May they ever have before them his good example and precepts and follow in them. One of his dying wishes was that his children might be raised Christians. Dear little Annie Laurie, to think she can never know the blessing and happiness of a Father's love. But our Heavenly Father has promised His protection of the fatherless. Cousins Sue and Thomas Watson are with us and real friends they have proved themselves. They are both such comforts to Sister Mary. Brother Jim loved and trusted them both. I feel as if I never knew Cousin Thomas before. He has acted more like a brother to Sally and I then a cousin; seems so anxious to assist us in any way in his power, indeed it seemed balm to the wound in our hearts in giving up our dear Brother to find we have another friend raised up to us in our need. And Sally, dear little Sally! What a brave little woman she has proved herself! What a comfort she was to the poor suffering brother. Gave up so many of her own comforts and pleasures so willingly to minister to his needs. I did not know what a real woman she was until I saw her tried. It will be a sweet thought to her to remember how faithfully she nursed him so long. Who can doubt the hand of God in bringing her to us in the hour of need. Dear little Sis, and how much I owe you too for how often have you acted as nurse and comforter to me. When I think of brother Jim's family and what they lose in him I feel as if I had hardly a right to grieve for myself but Oh, who will I ever find who will take the place of the Brother, Friend and Teacher he has ever been to me. So ready as he ever was to listen to all my troubles, my fears and my joys and to aid me with his council. Oh, what a feeling of desolation comes o'er me when I fully realize he is no longer among us. Thank God I've many and dear friends left but it is very hard to give up my Brother but God is good and just and Himself hath done it; therefore, it must be right. The servants all show much feeling at losing their master. A true friend he has been to them all.

    
## April 13-19 

  A rainy Sunday. There are sad hearts indoors today. I take my last look at my dear brother. Oh, how calm and peaceful he looks even in death. On Monday as I've already said he was given back to his Mother Earth. Oh, what a lonely desolate feeling filled my heart on returning to the house; its light and joy was gone. Truly there is a desolate hearth stone now. Sister Mary's friends think it best for her to go back with cousin Sue for a few weeks so it is decided that she is to go tomorrow and take the baby and Lizzie with her. Sally and I will go to Uncle Bob's until we can go up on the cars. Mary Lewis comes down on Sunday to see me ....Tuesday all is stir and bustle until they all get off. I'm sorry to see sister Mary go for it will be so hard when she comes back. It will be almost going over the whole thing again. Poor thing, she seems almost broken hearted; often wondering over the house. Oh, how sad it looks and feels. We too take our departure. It is locked up. Cousin Sarah Lewis and Miss Pidy will clean up before sister Mary returns ....Wednesday, Sally, Jimmy, Willie [Jimmy and Willie Minor are brother Jim's two oldest sons] and I go over to the dear old house and go in. Oh, what a chill I feel at my heart at the sight of its deserted rooms. I go for a little while to see Cousin Sarah. She has been a real friend to us all. Thursday we start home. Oh, what a joyful sound that is in my ear! Have to walk to the Bridge on account of the bad roads where the waggon is waiting for us. Little Sis goes on up to sister Betty's where she will stay a few days and then go back to Aunt Sallys and wait for sister Mary. I feel so sorry we are to be separated; have been so much together of late that we are almost necessary to each other. I find them all well at home with their hearts full of love and sympathy for me. It is a good happy feeling to think I'm once more at home. Little Dick says, "please, sister Lou, don't ever go away again." Good Friday, the 18th, I did not get to church. Find a great deal to do around me and try to take hold at once ....

    
## April 20-26 

  Easter Sunday and a rainy day. Very quiet, happy times. Begin school....[Letters received and written.]

 [Sally]has gone back to Castalia. The little woman is restless and uneasy about Jabe. She has [not] heard from him since he got to Yorktown. Saturday evening our eyes are gladdened by the sight of Bob. His Regiment is between here and Gordonsville and he has been up twice in the last week or ten days. Reports reach us this week that the Yanks are very near us on the west but we have Stone Wall Jackson to watch them so I can't feel very much frightened ....

    
## April 27-May 3 

  A beautiful Sunday over head but we have no way to get to church. It is too muddy to walk. Monday we walk over [to town] and I do some shopping. Get a letter from Mrs. Pegram which troubles not a little. It is about Susan [Louisa's slave woman who is hired out.] I get Daddy's advice. He thinks I ought to see Mr. Brown so accordingly I walk over Tuesday and get him to meet me at Dr. Leitchs. Would have gone to his house but it rained. I write a very nice note to Mrs. Pegram. Also a letter to Sally asking her not to let Susan suffer. Wednesday morning feel used up by my two long walks. So much to do in the garden but I do not feel equal to it .... Mary Lewis, Nan and Dave out dining so I'm all alone . ....[Letters written.] Get the garden finished .... The news is confirmed the last of the week of the surrender of New Orleans. The whole affair is a mystery -traitors in the camp, I fear .... [Jabe] came Thursday and back again Saturday. He is poorly. The Peninsula does not agree with him. Sis is thinking strongly of going to Richmond as there she may have an opportunity of seeing him oftener. She wants me to come down in case she does go and I will go for a day or so if she sends up the carriage. Sister Mary and the girls still in The Green Springs. She does not think of returning for a few weeks yet. Getting on with the quilts bravely. Read this week Canlincourt's *Napoleon and His Times*. Saturday evening have a nice walk on the river with Dave, Nan and Bruno. The times very exciting. We hear Stone Wall Jackson is in Albemarle. Can't imagine what is intended.

    
## May 4-10 

 Go to church and hear such a beautiful and warming sermon from Mr. Philip Slaughter ....A quiet happy Sunday. Read some of Kingsley's Sermons. At home all by myself this week as Mary Lewis stays in town with cousin Lou. She is much interested in the soldiers kitchen where the girls around in town go to cook. A letter from Bob which causes me much heartache. Someone seems to have been meddling between us. I write at once and make some explanations which I think are due to both of us. Frequent notes from little Sis. She is still hoping to send for me. Sister Mary still away. How I do want to see Sally. The news is confirmed this week of the surrender of New Orleans. Our prospects seem dark just now but we must never give up while there is a man, woman and child left in the South.

    
## May 11-17 

 Do not go to church. Too warm to walk. Monday Dave brings me word Sally and Aunt Sally will be up on the cars Tuesday and she wants me to meet them in town and go up to Rugby with them so I go over. We met at the Depot and after some shopping go up to sister Betty's .... I did not care much as I wanted to see sister Betty, brother Brown and the young ones. Sally and Aunt Sally could not keep quiet longer than Thursday morning, so they started off in the rain. I thought there was no necessity for me to go so I hold on until Friday, 11 o'clock when the rain has stopped and some blue sky appeared, so I went to town and got Jimmy Leitch for an escort and proceeded home; had a muddy walk but nothing to hurt me ....We are all excited about Richmond this week. Hear it is in danger. Hope it will not be given up without some show of resistance, as was New Orleans, Norfolk and some other places. I do not believe it will fall. A long letter from Sue. She seems in a troubled state of mind; is too despairing I think ....A letter from Bob Saturday evening which puts my mind a rest. All's right now. I can but wonder who the busy body is; have my thoughts about it which I will not trust even to you, Old Journal. Vegetation is looking so lovely now but a sadness will come o'er me whenever I look around for how soon may the hand of the spoiler make our beautiful country a wreck? But God is good and just and even though he may allow our enemies to desolate our land, in His own good time He will make it seem right to us. May we look to Him at all time of our tribulation and feel that He works all things well.

    
## May 18-14 

 No church again. It is too far to walk and my nose cold is so bad; worse then I've ever had it before. I have done much reading. Some of Dr. Cumming's books. In a letter from Sue this week she writes us the good news, I don't know the authority, that Virginia is to be defended at all costs. General [Bradley T.] Johnson it seems had a hand in this move. Every preparation is now being made to resist the enemy getting to Richmond. Some hard fighting is expected in the next few weeks. May God give us the victory. A letter from Sis. She tells me Sister Mary is expected up this week. I hope much she will come for many reasons. Sally says Jabe is about 18 miles from Richmond; has been having hard times. For two days his whole Regiment, officers and all lived on parched corn, one ear and a half per day. He did not complain and wrote in good spirits. I'm very poorly this week with my nose cold; in bed one day.

    
## May 26-31

 No church. A letter from Bob. He is sick at Madison Court House. We hear Old Jackson is clearing Western Virginia of the Yankees. It is generally believed we are soon to go into Maryland. A great battle is expected to come off in the neighborhood of Richmond. We feel very uneasy about Sue but Friday she, John, Kathleen, Ellie and Emily [Kathleen and Ellie Macmurdo are John's sisters and Emily is Sue's slave maid] make their appearance among us. They have been driven off by the Yankees from Ashland and have come to stay with us until the fate of Richmond is decided ....Sally sends me a letter from Jabe; he is in six miles of Richmond. He has lost Buc. [Jabe] is acting Senior Surgeon of the Regiment. Seems anxious for the fight to come off; is very certain of success. Sally is talking of coming to see me as soon as she can get any one to stay with Sister Mary; does not like to leave her by herself.

    
## June 1-7 

 No church. Roads too bad. Do so much work this week. Fighting all around us. Old Stone Wall in the West and Johnson before Richmond. The River is now so obstructed...they cannot get up to Richmond in their boats so they will have to fight us on land. Thursday night we are all roused up to hear the bad news that Dr. Leitch is dead (June 5.) He died very suddenly Thursday night after he had gone to his room. His death is a public calamity; hardly any man could be more generally lamented both by rich and poor for he was a friend to all .... Dr. Leitch was buried on Sunday with masonic honor. Poor Sam [Dr. Leitch's son, who is in the Confederate army] did not get up.

    
## June 8-14 

 I did not go to the funeral being too poorly. Kat, Elie and I have a quiet day at home. Bob comes Monday. He is very poorly. Brings me a letter from Sally telling me she started for Richmond today. Oh, I'm so troubled that I have not seen her; had just planned to go down and bring her up. She had written the middle of last week to tell me Jabe had sent for her and she would go in a few days but the letter did not reach me until Tuesday evening. She sends me a letter from Brother Peter. He is in Arkansas; has been in Arkansas since sometime in the winter. [He] was too feeble to be with the army now but as soon as he gets better will join Beauregard. Says the Feds had committed great excesses in Pike County [Missouri.] ....Mammy Eliza and I go down to Edge Hill to see Mary Walker. I fear she is not long for this world. Have some troopers to dinner. They give us the news of Jackson's march through the [Shenandoah] Valley and back again. Old Stone Wall has been

 reinforced now and we hope he may soon clear western Virginia of the hated foe. We hear he sent to Jeff Davis for 10,000 more troops and no orders. The brave veteran, General [Turner] Ashby was buried at the University Cemetery on Sunday last. He was shot by the enemy in one of Jackson's fights of last week. A call from Jimmy Lewis. He intends to leave the Lighthorse [Cavalry Brigade of Albemarle County.] Dave is to take his place. Bob with us very poorly .... [Letters written.] Wednesday I'm very poorly; am troubled in mind as well as body. Nothing doing before Richmond. Say the mud is too deep. Oh if we only had a Jackson there to overcome difficulties.

    
## June 16-21 

 Hear Mr. Meade [preach.]....Jabe [writes he] has seen General Price and he told him of brother Peter. Said he knew him well. Friday the 13th Jackson's army passed on their way down. No one knew where they are to go but General Jackson and what a day of excitement it was. The whole place seemed to belong to the soldiers: house, yard, garden, indeed the whole farm. I was feeding soldiers from early in the morning until late at night. [I] had to give up my bed to some of them. We were visited in the parlor by Generals [Richard Stoddert] Ewell and [Arnold] Elzey and Major Ballard and a number of other officers. General Ewell was such a funny old fellow. I enjoyed him. He seemed to have the simplicity of heart of a child but was dressed very rudely while his sub Elzey dyked out in all his finery looking as if he felt so fine. Major Ballard was very pleasant and good natured; promised me a button from General Jackson's fighting coat. We tried hard to get the Generals to tell us where they were going and what was to be done but they got off from all questions without satisfying our curiosity or committing themselves. We all go up to the gates at the "Persimmon Tree" to see the passage of the Grand Army. Truly the sight of those poor tired ragged soldiers lessens my fancied pictures of the pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war. Surely our cause must be good that these men engaged in for it caused them to leave their homes and many comforts and endure all this suffering to gain it. "The conquest we must for our cause it is just. And this be our motto, 'In God is our Trust." The Battle Flags looked faded and tattered and torn as though they had braved the battle and the breeze but soiled and stained as they were their bearers bore them aloft with a proud step. Cousin Howel was here the first of the week on his way from Ivy Creek. He give us the particulars of Cousin Fielding's [Thomas Fielding Lewis] death which occurred on the 13th or 14th, I don't know which. Poor Cousin Howel looked so sad. He was a devoted brother.

    
## June 22-28 

 At Church and hear Mr. Meade....Soldiers at all hours coming in, the rear guard of the Army. A bloody battle is expected about Richmond. Oh, that it may end the war and give us back our homes and dear ones. Bob and Dave go off to join the Light Horse on Monday. It is with a heavy heart that I say good bye to them ....May the God who neither slumbers nor sleeps keep them both in his keeping and bring them back to us in safety. I make Jabe's preserves this week. Sugar is getting very high-75cents for very dark brown ....[Letters received.] Also one from niece Lizzie telling me David Crocket [a slave at Music Hall] had gone off, they suppose with the army. Mr. Brown goes to Gordonsville and gets him back. The great battle at Richmond has begun-June 27.

    
## June 29-July 5 

 At church and hear Mr. W. M. Wilson....Reports come to us that we are whipping the Yanks about Richmond ....We have driven the Yankees back some distance down the river from Richmond, 30 miles I believe, but they are not routed yet. Their loss has been very great but notwithstanding they made a masterly retreat which speaks well of [General George B.] McClellan's generalship. We too have lossed heavily some of our bravest and best. Among the number is my young friend Joe Prentes. He was too noble a boy to fall a prey to Yankee bullets but the cause in which he was engaged inspired him to a martyrs' death ....The papers say Jabe's Regiment was in the fighting and that his General (Richard Griffith) was mortally wounded; killed. A note from Bob. He is sick at a Mr. Tally's in Hanover County. Dave is with his Regiment.

    
## July 6-12 

 Hear Mr. Slaughter preach ....[Visits made.]

    
## July 13-19 

 Hear Mr. Meade [preach.] We hear Old Stone Wall Jackson is in motion again. Hope his road don't lie in this direction again. On to Washington is my hope now. [If we] don't the Yanks will try us at Richmond again though McClellan does promise his braves that he will yet have that hold of rebeldom. I imagine there will be some skidoodling when they hear Old Jackson is on the wing. Oh, if we could only burn Washington and carry fire and swords to the enemies camp and let them feel the horrors they have been inflicting on our poor people perhaps they might be brought to their right minds. But the God of Battles alone can decide our cause and to Him must we trust that when He wills it all will be right. A letter from Sally at last. She has not been sick but just put off writing first because she was unsure about the fighting and then she felt so little like writing; says she won't do so again. Finish piecing my silk quilt. I'm much rejoiced for I've been at work on it off and on for three years. Lizzie Dee makes us a visit of a day and two nights this week. Quite an event! Another note from Bob; he is again with his company. Dave is pleased and Capt. Gibbs thinks he will make a good soldier ....Mary Lewis and Kathleen up at the Delevan kitchen all day Friday though it is raining hard. Mary Lewis goes generally rain or shine. She in much interested in the work. It is no doubt a just institution for poor sick soldiers. I've been invited to take a day at both the kitchens in town but declined thinking there were others better able for the work then myself ....

    
## July 20-26 

 No church. The roads too bad. Some sober reading for the day ....[Letters received including one from] Bob written Friday l0th. He was on his way to the Rapidan to meet the Yankees who were said to be 50 or 60,000 on that river ....The army news of Saturday is that the Yanks are at Orange Court House in force and a battle was expected there.

    
## July 27-Aug. 2 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....Have a ride to town with John and Sue. Treat myself to a copy of Byron, bad speculation now as the Yankees may be upon us at any time. On Wednesday 30th, Sue, Kattie and Ellie leave us. Oh, what a void their departure makes both in my heart and the house. We have been together long enough to be quite necessary to each other. I love the girls both much but Kathleen's my pet. She seems to suit my fancy best; is ever confiding with me and may not the mystery surrounding her birth draw her to me by exerting my sympathy and interest ....I sometimes, in thinking of her fortune's lot, fear that there must be breakers ahead for her in her voyage of life ....Quite a panic about the manners of the Yankees under the barbarian Pope this week. They are at Stewartsville and are expected in Charlottesville at any hour. Old Stone Wall must be thoughtful just now for not even a report of him is heard. He has some plans in his mind. No doubt we will soon know something of it .... We hear Lizzie Dee has left The Delevan. Something unpleasant happened in the house and she thought it right to leave. Don't suppose she will ever return there.

    
## Aug. 3-9 

 At church and hear Mr. Slaughter.... After church Mary Lewis and I go to cousin Lou's [Lou Leitch, the widow of Dr. Leitch] to meet Sam who comes up for a short visit. It is a sad coming back for him and he seems to feel it much. Monday evening I go up to Rugby; find them all glad to see me. Two of [Turner] Ashby's Cavalry are staying there. One of them interests me much in that lamented Hero .... I've no work now. Feel quite strange. Everything in the way of clothing is so dear don't know when I will be able to get anything more. Calico now is a dollar a yard and everything else as dear. I'm thinking of a visit to sister Mary. Have written to ask her to send for me if convenient. Saturday get a letter from her telling me the boys are in hourly expectation of the measles and she does not like to send them from home. I am sorry for her when I think of what is before her. Would like to go down and help her to take care of the children but suppose I must put it off now for I've no way to get down. Also have a letter from Sally Williamson. She and Bert are now at Music Hall. They have been run off from their home in Orange by the Yanks; will stay with their friends in Lynchburg and Cumberland until it is safe for them to venture back to Orange. They did not leave that place until the small battle had come off in the Village of Orange Court House when our forces were driven back by the superior numbers of the enemy ....

    
## Aug. 10-16 

 I do not go to church; am feeling bad ....We hear there has been a battle near Culpepper Court House at Cedar Mountain on Saturday the 9th in which we whipped the Yanks though our loss was very great. So many wounded in town. Sam sends me some Yankee Trophies .... Working busily on the scrap book. No sewing to do ....

    
## Aug. 17-23 

 At church and hear Mr. Slaughter.... Reading Macaulay and Miss Esphasth's novels. I write out a revised and corrected edition of my will. All right now just as I want it ....

    
## Aug. 24-30 

 I do not go to church ....[Letters received and much company.) Hear Sally and Jabe are at Rugby. I go up early Friday morning ....Sally brings me some Yankee Trophies. I do not enjoy my visit to Rugby much. Things are not as they should be. It makes me sick at heart to see and know all ....

    
## Aug. 31-Sept. 6 

 I do not go to church. Tuesday Jabe, Sally and I come home .... Dave goes up Tuesday evening for Lydia. I'm glad she is here and will get acquainted with all my folks. Dave leaves us for his Regiment Wednesday ....Glorious news from the Army! On the 28-29-30 of August we shipped the Yankees again on the plains of Manassas [Second Manassas or Second Bull Run.] We are now fully enroute for Maryland. Our Cavalry made a brilliant charge.

    
## Sept. 7-13 

 No church. We hear Bolling Picket was wounded in the last fight and John Mac writes to Daddy to look for him in the hospital in town. He cannot be found; Suppose he was sent to some other place ....Tuesday night the 9th we hear that Cincinatti and Lovington have been surrendered to the Rebs under General Kirby Smith. How blessed our armies have been lately. God grant that peace may soon spread her wings over. (It was a mistake.) We hear that our Army under General Lee are certainly in Maryland. Thursday Jabe, Sally and I start for the lower neighborhood. Walk from Keswick to Mr. Hart's. Find Mr. Hart sick and also little Richard Morris. See a new western cousin, Nick Thomas. We leave in the evening for Uncle Bob's. Aunt Sally gives us such a warm welcome. Lizzie Dee and Ellie are away but come home the next day. Mrs. C. L. Smead is boarding with Aunt Sally. She has some pretty little children but they don't good much. Mrs. Smead is a real lady. I like her much. Saturday I go to visit for the first time my dear Brother's grave. It is hard to realize that green mound holds now all that is left of that once cherished form. A peaceful calm seems to fill my heart while visiting this dear spot. The remembrance of the many happy hours spend with this dear Brother fill up the past. I can think of him ever as one of the Redeemed in That World of Light where I may one day join him. Sister Mary is at the Green Springs so we put up at Castalia until she comes home.

    
## Sept. 14-20 

 At Grace Church to hear Mr. Boyden.... Make some visits this week. Dine at The Creek with Henry and his wife [Henry Howel and Sarah Clegg Lewis.] I'm glad to see them both. Sally Lewis teaches me to plait straw. Call at Clover Fields. Cousin Peggie looks so old and sad. Mr. Nelson is no better; he cannot last much longer. Cousins Charles and Lou were there. They take me for Sally. It makes quite a laughable story as they think Sally has improved much in her looks, in the few weeks time she left them. Mrs. Pellet is making them (at Cloverfields) a visit. She is so handsome. Talks so beautifully of Music Hall in by gone times. It seems she went to the old place on coming into the neighborhood and it was hard to realize the many many changes since she was last a guest under its hospitable roof. Aunt Sue and Uncle Jimmy sleeping quietly in their corner of the garden.

 The old house gone, both yard and garden so changed. Nothing she recognized but old Aunt Rachel! [Aunt Rachel is one of the slaves owned by James Hunter Terrel and freed by his will. She, being very elderly, chose to remain in Virginia in bondage rather than go to Liberia.] ....Jabe leaves us Monday for a visit to Richmond to try for a transfer South ....Thursday the 18th [is] Thanksgiving Day we go to church in the morning and return thanks to our God who has been with us in the late battles. The services were conducted by Mr. [Edward S.] Pegram. Mr. [William Cabel] Rives read the sermon. The Psalms appointed by the church were very beautiful and appropriate being the Psalm of Hymn of Thanksgiving after a Victory appointed in the Prayer Book. "For

 The Lord hath done great things for us for which we ought to rejoice."	 Lizzie Dee and I take a ride to Cobham. Fairy concludes to kick up and I take a graceful turn over her head. Fortunately I escape with a few bruises. It occasions Lizzie Dee much merriment ....

    
## Sept. 21-27 

 We go to hear Mr. Beach. A good sermon....[and] such a beautiful prayer. He spoke so feelingly of Cousin Mary Ann Minor's family; the afflictions they had lately suffered. She has lost her daughter Annie and one of the younger ones is very ill now. Sister Mary comes home today. I go to see her after dinner; find her quite cheerful and glad to see me. I move over next day to stay. Sally is with me. Jabe comes back to us for a few days. He cannot get ordered South; say they have need for him in Virginia but they promise him a post (settled). Music Hall is so changed; the light of the house is indeed gone. I'm glad I've come back, feel better for it; think Sister Mary is gratified too. Little Annie is such a bright beautiful child; she is the pet of all. What a God send she has proved. Sister Mary seems to be trying hard to be interested in all her affairs. I never thought to see her so active and busy. The boys will go to Lizzie Dee's school. Sister Mary and I settled about Lydia's schooling for last year. She will not go another year. Sally and I am in much trouble. Someone has been very busy talking about the little sister. Well trouble is our lot in life but I little though it could have come from this quarter. How will it all end? Jabe leaves us Wednesday for Culpepper Court House ....Read so many novels ....Bob at home this week very poorly. He brings me a letter from Dave. Bob was in all of the hard battles since the Maryland campaign commenced. All agree that it has been warmest part of the war. Our Army has been terribly cut up but we hear it is rapidly being filled up. Sam, we hear, has been taken prisoner but we suppose he will soon be set at liberty.

    
## Sept. 28-Oct. 4 

 At church and hear Mr. Boyden. Spend Monday at The Creek ....Tuesday Jimmy brings me home. I'm so glad to get back but feel badly about leaving Sally so lonely. Dear little woman, she is so poorly in health and spirits. I wish she could go to Jabe. She seems to feel my leaving her much. Jabe is now in Lynchburg; hope he can settle there and send for little Sis ....Go right to work teaching school ....Letters from Sue; Cousin Sop [Sue's father-in-law] is very ill. They fear he cannot get well. Oh, what a loss he would be to his family but God knows what is best and may they all bow with submission to His Will .... Such very dry weather. Hard times for the farmers as they cannot plough for seeding wheat and it is getting very late in the year. On Friday we see by the papers that cousin Sop is dead. Oh, his poor wife and children. How they must grieve for I never knew a man more idolized then he was by his whole family. Mary Lewis in town staying; I miss her much. Am trying to be a very strict school ma'am. So very dry. It really begins to look scary. The farmers have not been able to sow any wheat as yet and it is getting very late in the season.

    
## Oct. 5-11 

 We cannot go to church as Uncle Hatter is so poorly. I have a meeting at Mammy Nelly's house with the darkies and enjoy it. Uncle Hatter and Uncle Gabriel have a warm discussion. I'm edified....[Sally] sends me a letter from Jabe of the lst of Oct. He was then in Lynchburg but he did not seem to think there was a chance for his being kept in that place. Don't think he has given up hope of being sent South yet. A letter from Sue to Mary Lewis giving particulars of cousin Sop's death. She says Friday the 26th of Sept. he went down to his office but return in the evening very ill and on Friday the 3rd of Oct. he was taken down to Richmond again to that last resting place of man where he must sleep until that great Resurrection Morn when the Lord Himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout; with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trumpet of God. He breathed his last about the day dawn Thursday Morning Oct. 2, 1862. Sue says the distress of his family is terrible to witness. He was a truly devoted husband and father. Poor cousin Ann! May God send His comforter to her and to them all. He alone can help them in this their hour of woe. Poor John! The responsibility resting on him now is very great. Sue tells us his friends are trying to get his Father's office for him; hopes they may succeed. Mary Lewis comes home Wednesday evening. Mrs. Southall has diptheria at Cousin Lou's and it is not thought safe for Mary Lewis to stay in the home with it. Sam is expected every day as he is supposed to be among the prisoners lately exchanged. Sally tells me Cousin Thomas Watson has put Lydia to school with Lizzie Dee. It is very kind in Cousin Thomas. I wanted her to be at school but did not feel that I could afford to send her and I did not feel that Sister Mary could either. Nannie and I begin a course of reading together. We will include all kinds of literature. We want just now to make the acquaintances of Byron. I finish this week the two last volumes of Macaulay's *History of .England*.... Friday Sally comes very unexpectedly. Jabe comes with her as far as town. He has been ordered to Harrisburg to establish a hospital. I'm so glad to have Sally with me. She brings me such a dear little coffee pot out of Jabe's Mississippi Chest. have such nice little coffee parties. Sam with us Friday night. He brings me some trophies from Fort Delaware. [Fort Delaware is a Union prison for Confederate prisoners and Sam has just been exchanged after being a prisoner there.]

    
## Oct. 12-18 

 I do not go to church. Sally very poorly this week. Mammy goes to Ashland Friday to be with Emily who is quite sick and to help Sue to nurse her. Sam with us very often. Such cold, dry weather. The wind sighs around the house with such a mourning sound and the leaves are falling, falling. All tell us that the reign of summer is past.

    
## Oct. 19-25 

 No church ....No news from the army. Mammy Eliza has a letter from Dave. He was in Stewart's Raid [probably means J.E.B. Stuart's Cavalry raid] into Pennsylvania. He hopes soon to come home ....[Visits made.]

    
## Oct. 26-Nov. 1 

 A rainy Sunday ....Make my pickles Monday .... On Oct. 22nd Sam, Sally, Mary Lewis, Nannie, Mag, Met and I went on a tramp to Monticello. Got over the river in a boat and then footed it up the mountain [and then] got into the house. Went through the best rooms. Did not see anything new to me as I had been there often before. After walking over the Yard and visiting the grave yard we took down the mountain toward the river and on reaching a moss grown fountains we opened the lunch and refreshed ourselves. Got home sometime before sundown, tired and soiled stained. I met with quite an adventure; fell into the canal and got very wet. Sam thinks it all comes from a spirit of independence which he thinks it wrong for me to encourage. I get a calico dress this fall and for ten yards pay $15. Eighteen months since, $1.50 would have bought me the same. Everything is very high now. Spool cotton 50 cents per spool, cotton cloth such was we formerly paid 

 6 1/4 cents is now 70 cents, very brown sugar 75 cents and every thing else in proportion. Wednesday Oct. 29th Mammy comes home. She has had a nice visit to Ashland. Left Emily about again ....

    
## Nov. 2-8

 At church. No sermon only the communion service as Mr. Meade's voice is almost gone... [Letters received, among them one from Sally.]	She tells me Sister Mary has lost another of her servants, Sarah. Nanny and I are very busy on scrap books.  Sam and Daddy have both given us one ....No news from the Army. A part of it has fallen back to Culpepper ....

    
## Nov. 9-15 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....Ma and Nan go to Uncle Bob's for a week's visit. We miss them much especially Ma. Have a letter in the evening from Sally by Uncle Hatter .... Jabe is still in Harrisonburg. Start for a visit to Rugby but meet brother Brown in town. He does not think it safe for me to go then as they fear some new cases of fever. We attend to the business and he paid me a part of Louisa's hire. Says the children have all been very poorly particularly little Cornelia; fears she will not get over it ....Read such a nice book by Bishop [William Ingraham] Kip called *The Lenten Fast*. Enjoy his views on The Intermediate State. They are both forcible and convincing. Friday I go down in the carriage with Met for Ma and Nan. It is a pleasant little change for me. Dine at Clover Fields. Sleep at Music Hall Friday night and take dinner with Aunt Sally Saturday. Get home before night. I'm so glad to see Sally. Sister Mary is talking of going off with her family both black and white if the Yanks get any nearer. She intends to go with Cousin Thomas [Watson] to Henry County. Hope there is no necessity for her going. Sally seems very well satisfied. Sister Mary has fixed up her and Lydia very comfortably.

    
## Nov. 16-22 

 No service at my own church so I go to hear Dr. Hay; a very fine sermon ....Dave comes home sick. He is looking badly. [He] brings us some Yankee milk and raspberries which we don't enjoy .... A letter from Sally. She tells me that much wished for tea has arrived in town and she wants me to send there for it and when I get it to help myself to a part and take care of the rest until I can get an opportunity to send it to her ....Finish the 5th Volume of Scrap Book ....Read *Waverly*....

    
## Nov. 23-29 

 I do not go to church; not feeling very well. Hear sister Betty has another daughter born Friday 28th. This makes ten children for her. Oh, what a weight of responsibility she has resting upon her! The rearing up as they should be [of] ten human beings. When called upon to give an account of her trust will she be able to say she has done what she could? Hear today of Mr. [Francis K.] Nelson's death. He died yesterday-22nd. Poor man. Death must have been a happy release. Such a sufferer as he has been for such a long time, over two years now I believe. He has ever treated me most kindly and affectionately and I've ever felt towards him as if he were a near relation. Oh! I can see so many of those I loved and cared for are passing away but this world is not our home. Oh, that we could take those words home to our hearts and feel the truth of them. Sister Mary told me when I was last at Music Hall that my old friend Ned Fry fell in the last battle of Manassas. Poor Ned. We have had some happy times together. Monday Mammy Eliza, Nannie, Daddy and I go down to Grace Church to attend Mr. Nelson's funeral. Mr. Boyden preached a very suitable sermon from the words, "I know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living." Mr. Boyden, I think, is always exceedingly happy in his remarks on funeral occasions. He seemed much agitated at this time for he felt, no doubt, poor man, that he was putting away a friend. After the services at the church we all followed the body to the Belvoir Grave Yard and there buried it out of our sight. Mr. Nelson lived and died a Christian so it is well with him.

   - 	"Servant of God well done 
 - 	Thy glorious warfare spent 
 - 	The battle's fought-the race is won 
 - 	And thou art crowned at last."
   Call for a moment at Music Hall; see Sister Mary and all the children. Little Annie is walking about. Have a kiss and hug from little Sis. She has gotten the tea and promises to save me some. Don't have time to have any news from her of Jabe. We are very near staying all night but Uncle Hatter thinks he can get home by dark so we all agree to come. Get back by sundown very tired and sick with headache but a cup of tea sets me up again. Fix up the flowers for winter. Some of the hogs are killed so we have plenty to live on now. Am reading again some of the Waverly novels and enjoy them much. Doing little or nothing in the way of work. Have accomplished something in the way of knitting. In the last year during the early spring and when the cool weather set in this fall I've finished off 6 pairs of stockings for myself, 6 pairs of socks for different people, done a good deal of the knitting on my counterpane besides a good deal of other knitting; hope to finish off two or three pairs of cotton stockings for Mag before Xmas comes yet.

    
## Nov. 30-Dec. 6 

 We have such a beautiful sermon from Mr. Slaughter on Advent Sunday ....Monday Mammy Eliza, Mary Lewis and I go visiting ....Tuesday Mary Lewis and I spend with Mrs. McGhee....shows me some such nice home made cloth. I wish much I had a dress of it. Wednesday the 3rd Jimmy Minor arrives in the rockaway for me; brings me word that my darling little Sis will start for Mississippi in a few days and they have sent for me to see the last of her and Jabe. I get ready and start off before dinner. Get to Music Hall before night and find Sister Mary in the Green Springs. I'm so glad to be with Jabe and Sally once again but it makes my heart ache when I remember what a long separation it may be. Jabe has been ordered to report at Jackson, Miss.; hopes he may get a post and not be obliged to go into the field again. Think he is much pleased at the thought of going South again and Sally too, though I can see how much she feels at leaving her many friends in Virginia. We have some happy times together in Sally's room talking over the past and making plans for the future. Our favorite one is that when the war is over for me to visit them in their Mississippi home. Oh, and what am I to do without out my sister? It seems as if all the affection that ought to have been hers during the long years we have been separated had all been expended upon her since she came to me, and dear Jabe, if we had been children of one mother, he could not have been dearer to me. They make many promises of coming back but in these changeful and stormy times I feel as though the chances for meeting again were few. God knows best what will be right for us and I trust all to Him. We do no visiting but to call at Uncle Bob's and we spend the night there. Jabe has to come to town Saturday and he spends the night at Pantops. Most of Sally's friends call to say goodbye. They all seem sorry to see her go. Poor little Lydia; she seems so grieved at her aunt going. Sally seemed a link between her and her Missouri home. Sister Mary gets back Thursday. Little Annie is so sweet and pretty. I feel proud of all those children. They are so affectionate towards each other and so attentive to their Mother. It shows that the good early training of their Father has not been lost. Sally and I have such nice little tea parties. Jabe won't join us in the beverage but he does in our chats. They are mostly on family affairs. There is one thing that troubles us all three much and will ever cast a cloud upon this visit to Virginia. Oh, that there was a little more of that charity in the world that "thinketh no evil."

    
## Dec. 7-13 

 We do not go to church. The cars miss Jabe so he stays another night at Pantops. He gets home Monday and then the packing commences. He brings me a letter from home from Sue. She seems to think she will not be up at Xmas. John cannot come and she doesn't want to leave him. His work is very heavy now since our Army have occupied Fredricksburg. Cousin Lizzie [Watson] and some of the young children get to Music Hall Monday night. They have come to say good bye before leaving for Henry County. Cousin Thomas [Watson] has hired a farm there to take his servants to in case the Yanks get here. His white family will be at the Court House. They all seem unwilling to go. We hear Henry [County] is quite out of the world and they will have to leave all their comforts behind. The servants have [already] started. Cousin Lizzie and the children will go in a week or so. I feel so sorry for Sister Mary; she looks so much to Cousin Thomas for advice. Jabe and I have fear out of the news. Fear Lydia will get herself in a love scrape; don't know whether I ought to meddle or not. Am very glad she tells her Aunt Mary all her difficulties; feel sure Sister Mary will always tell her what is best to be done. I feel much better satisfied about Lydia now. She seems very happy and Sister Mary and Lizzie [Minor] both take so much interest in her. Lizzie Dee reports that she is studying well. I think she is truly thankful for any kindness showed to her. Monday night we take supper with Aunt Sally. It is a sad-happy evening for I have to see little Sis take leave of Aunt Sally and her household. Aunt Sally has been a good kind friend to Sally and as much as I loved her before she has larger claims upon me now for her kindness to my darling little sister and at a time when she needed friends. I can never forget it. Tuesday morning Dec. 9th the trunks are all packed and we start off; I for home and Sally and Jabe for Mississippi. We go together as far as Charlottesville when the last goodbyes are said and I see the last of my dear Brother and Sister. Oh, when and where will we meet again? In the stormy and changeful times in which we live, the chances are few of our meeting again on earth but we may look forward to and hope for a meeting in our Father's House when there will be no more going out. May God speed them on their way and may His protecting eye watch over them and may the trials of separation from them only increase my faith in Him who has proved to me that He does not willingly afflict any of us. Brother Brown goes with them as far as Lynchburg; hope he and Sally make all right. Brother Brown and I decide that Susan and her whole family shall go to him for another year. It eases my mind not a little. I get home before night with an aching heart. Teach school the rest of the week. Am busy on the War Scrap Book. We are much excited about Fredericksburg. The two armies are both there now ready to fall upon each other. Toward the last of the week some severe fighting is done. On Saturday the loss of life was very great. The fighting around Fredericksburg is called "heavy skirmishing" and it must be truly heavy to cost the lives of so many of our brave men but the enemy's loss is greater so that is comforting.

    
## Dec. 14-20 

 At church and hear Mr. Nelson....After church go up to Mr. Brown's and see my new niece. She is a tiny little baby and not very healthy. No name has been given her as yet. I voted for a fancy one. Sister Betty has not yet been out of her room. She looks badly. The children all have been very sick since I saw them. They are all well now but Cornelia. She is, I hope, on the mend. Poor little thing, she seems all eyes now ....I get back Monday to dinner. Very quiet times; teaching, reading and knitting and any work I may find to do. Wrote to Lydia. She expects to spend her holidays with me and maybe Lizzie [will come also.] Had a long letter from Sue. She seems to feel much sympathy for me in giving up Sally. Says they are all much interested in the fight at Fredericksburg for they know their fate if we are driven back. She wants me to visit her after Xmas .... [Sue] seems to think it will not be very long before Kat will be married. Dear child, I hope she may be happy ....

    
## Dec. 21-27 

 We go to town but have no church; cannot warm the church. The big battle at Fredericksburg has come off. We have to record another glorious victory. The Yankees admit that they were terribly beaten. The fight commenced on Thursday Dec. 11th and continued through the next five days. Poor old Fredericksburg, it will never rise again. Its homes are desolation and its people scattered now. Lydia comes Wednesday. I go for her to the Depot ....Xmas Day! I feel so little like it ....I do not go to church; stay at home and have a quiet time ....I have been enjoying some of Scott's novels. Like them quite as well as I did the first time I read them. Mary Lewis has been all excitement about the dinner given to the soldiers at The Delevan Hospital on Xmas. Contributions were sent by almost everyone in the county and they had the nicest kind of a dinner. Over 1200 soldiers were dined and then the darkies of the establishment were treated. Friday evening the Surgeons of the Delevan gave a supper to the ladies who had assisted in nursing and cooking for the hospital during the last year. Mary Lewis was there and had a gay time. The nicest kind of a supper and plenty of beaux. I write Sally a long letter. It seems so little like Xmas and I cannot wish for a merry one.

    
## Dec. 28-31 

 I stay at home. We hear Mrs. Meade [wife of Rev. R. K. Meade] is dead. Her poor children, how I pity them for she was a good mother. For her, I believe all is well. Monday I spend in town and attend Mrs. Meade's funeral. How sweet and hopeful sounded that beautiful hymn "Asleep in Jesus." Our church was not dressed for Xmas this year and it seemed almost ominous for there were four funerals among the congregation during Xmas week. Hangings of black would have been suitable instead of the fir tree, the pine tree and the box tree together to beautify the sanctuary. The quietest Xmas I almost ever spent. Do some work on my War Scrap Book.

      
# 1863

   
## January 1, Thursday-New Years Day 1863. 

  Bright and beautiful over head. The past year has been one of peculiar trials to me; I feel that it has been a turning point in my life. In the last twelve months I have been under the rod. I have lost the brother of my heart and there have been called upon to say farewell to the pet Sister and the darling Brother for I know not how long but in these trials there is hope left me. What troubles me most is that the voice of slander should have been raised against me and that friends who I believed true should have turned away. This comes of loving too well earthly mould. Oh, will I ever learn the lesson not to love and trust frail human nature so far? It seems that years do not make me any wiser. But I've a Friend of Friends still left me who I know will never desert though earthly friends should fail and may these trials make me look more to Him. I ought not to look for too much sympathy and love on earth. There are those who do love me and I feel I can trust, those of my dear home, but there were others of whose friendship I was vain and anxious to keep but they have but added proof to the wisdom of the "Wise Man" that all is vanity and vexation of spirit. May this year be spent in thinking less of earthly friendships and making more of a friend of my Heavenly Father. What a saddening thought comes to me when I remember how little I have done in His cause during the past year.

   - "Hark! hear a secret whisper say 
 - Each night where hast thou glanced today? 
 - What kindness hath by thee been shown? 
 - What hast thou gathered for Thine own? 
 - What pearl of wisdom hast thou found? 
 - What blessing freely scattered round? 
 - Oh, happy if thy soul hath brought 
 - An a ephemeral home of winnowed though.
   I feel that the winnowed thought has been but small. Oh, may another year find me nearer my God even though it be a cross that hast brought me. A New Year's Gift in the mail in the form of a letter from my darling little Sister. It was left in town by Jabe who added a line to tell me he was on his way to Richmond. It seems the day after he got to Jackson, orders came for all Surgeons in Mississippi to report to the Surgeon General in Richmond. It seems very hard for Jabe but he fares no worse then the others. He hopes to get back to Mississippi. Little Sis remains as she hopes to get to Cousin Bab and Jabe thinks he can go right back. Sally says people are much excited South. They have no confidence in [Earl] Van Dorn and many say they will not fight under him. The enemy have such a large part of the state that many of the people have no homes and those who are still in the possession of them think it will only be for a short time for they believe the state will be overrun this winter but Jeff Davis and General Johnston have gone out now and I hope they may do something to inspire the people with more confidence. Jabe tells me he will either see me or write in a few days. Cousin Bab and her family have had to run to Calhoun County where they are living in a cabin but she sends Sally word there is room for her so the little Sister concluded to go to cousin Bab and let Jabe come to Virginia by himself hoping he may be sent right back. The little woman says she missed me so much. Lydia leaves us Saturday. Dave goes with her. Maggie quite sick with dyptheria. Dr. Nelson sent for.

    
## Jan. 4-10 

 We go to church and hear Mr. Slaughter from the text "God is Love"...a sermon from which those who are now passing under the Rod may find much to comfort them. When we get in from church find Mary Lewis has dyptheria. She is not very ill. Monday Cousin Lou comes to us and is the comfort she always is at such times. Poor little Maggie is very ill. Her throat is so swollen she can scarcely breath and the remedies used are so severe and disagreeable. We are very unhappy about her. I don't feel as if I could cheerfully give up Mag, she is so dear to me. Tuesday Harriet [a slave woman] is taken down. No more cases until Thursday when Ellen is taken sick but it is a very slight case and I hope by being taken in time it will soon be well. Wednesday night Mary Lewis was very sick. Her worse symptom is weakness. How I wish Sue was at home. Well, Sue comes Friday. She is much comfort to us all. Dr. Nelson is a nice gentleman and I expect a good doctor but we have to try him yet. He comes every day. Maggie does not think she will get well. The dear child prays so earnestly and talks so much about dying. She says she would like to live but if it is God's will she is ready and I believe she is. It gives me much comfort to hear the dear child repeating the Psalms and Hymns that I've taught her. I little thought when they were committed to memory they would serve to console her dying bed. I have often felt discouraged about Maggie. She never expressed any opinion about anything taught her but it seems the seed fell upon good ground and my work was not in vain. I shall try and have more faith and believe that any work done for my Master is never lost, though in many instances we may be "many days in finding it." The dear child suffers so much and it is truly distressing to hear her prayers to be gone. A letter from Sally, from Grenada [Mississippi.]

    
## Jan. 11-17 

 Sunday [Maggie] is more comfortable and we have much hope for her ....Mary Lewis is mending slowly. Maggie's throat much better, but there are some other unfavorable signs now. Her whole body is much swollen. Still we believe her better. Mr. Nelson [the minister] comes to see her and reads and prays with her.

    
## Jan. 18-24 

 We are all in better spirits for we think the invalids are better. Nannie has dyptheria but is not very sick ....Monday evening dear little Maggie begins to sink. She is very low all night. About 3 o'clock in the night we all gather around her bed to see her die. She tells us she is perfectly willing to go and she knows God will take her. A short time before she breathed her last, she told Sue she saw some Angels waiting for her; with her last breath repeated hymns and expressed her perfect trust in her Saviour. Just before 4 o'clock AM her spirit took its flight for that "schooless shore." It is a hard trial giving up my pet, for I did love her best. Ma feels it so much for Mag was her favorite too. She said to me, "We have both lossed our darling, Lou." But we sorrow only for ourselves, for Maggie is far better off than she was with us.

  - "She is not dead, the child of our affections 
 - But gone into that school 
 - Where she no longer needs our poor protection, 
 - And Christ himself doth rule."
  Oh, that her death may be sanctified to each and all of us. May we consider it a warning sent by our Heavenly Father to remind us that we too must die. Oh! That we may live so that in death we may find Him! She is "put away" in the little grave yard on Thursday, 22nd, a cold damp day. Mr. Meade is with us, also Mr. Nelson. They sing the hymn she was so fond of repeating, "I would not live all way." Some few friends were with us and their sympathy was sweet but Oh, what a void in our home and hearts. "A shadow on the household rests and memory and sorrow come." Mary Lewis and Nanny are both getting on very well. Ellen does not improve as we hoped she would ....John tells us Jabe's business to Richmond was to appear as a witness at a Court Martial and that he expected to go back South. I'm so troubled not to hear from him; believe he has written but the mails are so uncertain there is no saying what has become of it. I write a long letter to little Sis on the 16th. Had a letter from Jabe on Friday from Raleigh, N.C. at which place he has been sent to examine conscripts. He expects to go back to Mississippi as soon as he gets through this work. He expected to have spent a week with me but was hurried off from Richmond at two hours notice ....Mammy Eliza and Ellen quite poorly with dyptheria. Mary Lewis and Nan getting quite smart.

    
## Jan. 25-31 

 Very quiet time. Two new cases this week, Dick and Dave. Neither of them sick enough to go to bed. A kind note from Lizzie Dee. She offers to come and help us nurse. Such offers are scarce now [as] everyone seems afraid of the disease and I can't think hard of them for it as it is a terrible sickness ....

    
## Feb. 1-7 

 We do not attend church. Dick very poorly this week; the rest are getting well again. I'm teaching school very regularly. Oh, how my heart aches for Maggie; books, lessons bring her so freshly to mind.

    
## Feb. 8-14 

 A letter from Lydia. She tells me someone saw her Uncle Jabe on the cars going South so I suppose I'm not to see him ....A call from Bob; he has left the Light Horse and has joined Carrington's [Artillery] Battery. Little Dick is very ill. I'm so troubled about him. Sue leaves this week. We are sorry to see her go.

    
## Feb. 15-21

 Another quiet Sunday. Met taken with Dyptheria. Hope he may not be very sick. Uncle Hatter plasters up the room this week making it much more comfortable ....[Letters written.]	I'm very poorly with an old fashioned cold. Can't get up a dyptheria. On Monday there was a change for the better in Dick and we hope he is now in a fair way to get well. Dear little fellow, we could ill have spared him. Feb. the 18th is Ash Wednesday; another Lent begins. Will its close find me more patient, more faithful, more diligent in the performance of my duties? With God's help it shall. Saturday move round to Ma's room taking tables, books, pictures, etc with me. I don't enjoy the change but believe I could make Ma more comfortable so I though I ought to come. Have a visit in the evening from little Dick. The first time he has been out of his sick room. The little fellow seemed so delighted to be with us again ....

    
## Feb. 22-28

  The "Do" of last Sunday. I'm interested in Cumming's *On The Morales: A Struggle with Self*. I'm conqueror!!! ....Wednesday a letter from Bob. Such a long long time since my heart has been made glad by such a sight. Well, I have not written in vain. I felt he would at sometime do me justice and think better of me. Hope and Wait-may it ever be my watchword. Have a nice long walk on Friday, the first for a long time. Saturday have the box bushes trimmed. A great improvement ....How many deaths we hear of round us. yet strange we lay it not to heart ....

    
## March 1-7 

 Sunday the first day of Spring; rainy in the morning but a bright day. Some sad little crocus in bloom. They tell of bright days to come ....[Letters written and received.] .... [Sally] tells me she has not had a word from me of any one in Virginia since she left. The dear little woman seems so troubled not to hear from me; says she thinks so much about me. She is with Cousin Bab and seems satisfied except being separated from Jabe. He is still in N.C. so Lydia was mistaken ....[She] seems to regret much she did not come back with him. Thinks if they ever get together again she will never leave him. Tells me Jabe has heard of a brother and nephew in the Southern Army which pleases him much .... Dave leaves us for his regiment on Wednesday ....His brigade is now at Culpepper Court House and it is thought they are in route for the [Shenandoah] Valley. The day after he leaves we have a visit from Mr. Knight from Missouri who came on purpose to see Dave, being an old friend. He wants to get Dave off from the Army in Virginia and take him back to Missouri with him. I'm so sorry Dave missed him [but] I'm not anxious for him to take Dave away. Mr. Knight belongs to the Army in Arkansas but he could give me quite a lot of news of my friends in Missouri. Tells me brother Peter is still "in the brush" and has become an expert dodger. If the Feds could only catch him he would swing. The only mode of warfare practiced there now is bush whacking and it tells on the traitors too. He thinks Missouri is all right if she ever has a chance to be heard fairly. I hope so. Says a lot of our blood kin are right in spirit. Sam Eastin [her niece's husband] is with General Price in Mississippi. Little Sam Minor [Louisa's nephew], when he last heard from him, was prisoner in the house of the Feds and in the Penitentiary in Jefferson City; a Yankee Prison.

    
## March 8-14 

 No church. I'm reading a memoir of Dr. Johnson. Monday go up to Rugby. Mr. Brown and I settle all about the darkies. Find that Susan [Louisa's slave woman who she hired out] has lost her little baby. It has never been healthy. Sister Betty has some Irish boarders, a Mrs. 0'Conner and her mother ....They are refugees from New Orleans ....Treat my self to some new books ....Tip [a dog] has been hung for sheep killing.

    
## March 15-21 

 Still not able to go to church ....We hear Sue is better. I've felt very uneasy about her. [Sue is pregnant.]....Dave turns up. He was in the last Cavalry fight in Culpepper on the 17th; had his horse killed under him [and] got his wrist badly hurt so he is disabled for a time. He ought to feel thankful that he came off so well. At one time he was a prisoner in the hands of the Yanks but was so fortunate as to escape from them and also took from them a fine war charger-an Old Campaigner too, having belonged to the old United States Cavalry service. I'm so glad Dave has the horse as he will not need to depend on a certain true? friend ....Dave brings us some Yankee coffee which we enjoy with Daddy's birthday dinner.

    
## March 22-28 

 A bright day. Monday morning about four o'clock old Uncle Peter died. Poor old man. It was in mercy that he was called home by the One who does all things right. Life to him for the last six months has been "labor and sorrow" by reason of years and he was not only willing but anxious to be gone. I believe he was a Christian and has now gone to his reward. Uncle Peter was a very old man-near a hundred the old ones think. He has been a good faithful servant and ever a firm friend of mine. I wrote his wife, Aunt Mary, a long letter telling her all the particulars of his death ....Wednesday the 25th Ma's birthday-70 years old today; the three score and ten of the scriptures and is still an active old woman and enjoys good health. May God spare her to me for a long time yet. Numerous notes from Music Hall. I've concluded to go with Dave in the cars Saturday. Working in the garden. Friday the 17th is a Fast Day we go to church and hear Mr. Meade....Saturday a bad day so I can't go to Music Hall.

    
## March 29-April 4 

 No church. We are all much troubled to hear that Sue is no better. Wish much some of the family could go down to see her. Feel troubled too about Dick. He does not seem to get his strength; has constant pains in his limbs. It is the effects of dyptheria, I suppose. I wrote Sue a letter. Had one from Jabe to my joy. He is still in N.C. and has had quite a tramp around the Old North State looking after conscipts. He has sent me several letters but they have never come to hand. Seems to be hurt that I would allow myself to think he would pass on his way home without taking a peep at me. His work in N.C. is now finished and he will be ordered off in a week or so somewhere else. Mississippi he hopes and then if he has to come to Richmond will see me. He hears but seldom from the little woman; seems troubled in mind about her. Hope much they may soon be together again. Sam sends me an autograph letter of General Lee's which I shall put in my Old Curiosity Shop ....I believe he really cares for me and does not look upon me only as a trouble. On, dear me, I'm getting to such an unpopular age that I must feel shy of asking favors of boys particularly .... Dave had put me off Monday so I'm still at home. I'm busy with nothing-making scrapbooks, reading, knitting and sewing a little ....Wednesday April lst I get to Sister Mary's. Find Sally Williamson there ready for me. I'm so glad to see her once more. A warm welcome from Sister Mary, the two nieces and all. They seem glad to see me. Find Bob Lewis with them. News!!! A love affair in the making. I'm surprised and pleased. I'm taken into the confidences of all parties. Sister Mary and I discuss Lydia's affairs. Think she has made a fortunate escape. Capt. B.B. of Company H will be caught yet if he don't mind ....Good Friday the 3rd we go to church but I'm not able to hear anything [being much afflicted with deafness.] . Saturday Nannie and Tom Page and the baby, little Ella arrive. We have quite a houseful of pleasant people ....

    
## April 5-11 

 Easter Sunday-snowing hard and very cold. We have a pleasant happy day. The Bishop at Grace Church on the 8th. He gives us a beautiful sermon ....The old feeling of loneliness now takes hold upon me. How my heart fills with thoughts of my darling little Sister. Oh, that I could see her!!! Sister Mary is so kind and good to me. Seems to know how much I miss my little Sister. Sister Mary and I call to see cousin Peggie and Charlotte. There has been a sad void made in both their home circles since I last visited them, the heads of both families gone ....[Other visits made with Aunt Sally and cousin Sarah at The Creek.]

    
## April 12-18

 A sad anniversary to me. This day one year ago I saw my dear Brother [James Minor] breathe his last. Oh, that long, long weary day and with all that heavy weight upon my heart I could not realize then what my loss would be. Thank God I'm stronger now. Peace has come to my heart for I can feel that all is well. A sad,	 calm and I may almost say a happy Sunday. Go to church and hear Mr. Boyden from the text "Do this in remembrance of me" and then we gather around the holy table	 and have our spirits refreshed by that rich banquet of His flesh and blood. Sister Mary at church for the first time since her widowhood. Letter from home this week. Nanny was confirmed on the 11th-Easter Sunday. On that she may have well counted the cost and firmly resolved in her mind to make all needful sacrifices to Him under whose banners she has now enrolled herself ....Thursday I get home. Oh, I'm so happy. I did want to see Ma so much. A long letter from Sally. She is still with Cousin Bab. Dear little Sister, she seems to be pining to see me. I send her a long letter-intended it as an answer to one Aunt Sally had had from her. Get the garden all finished this week, it looks so nice.

    
## April 19-25

 Hear a new preacher, a Mr. McGill....A good sermon....Making up my home made cotton dress. A letter from Jabe.  He is still in N.C.  He thinks there is a chance for his being with me in a few days....

    
## April 26-May 2

 At church and hear such a beautiful sermon from Mr. Williams of Leesburg.  Subject  "The Hidden Talent."....In town on Saturday and hear the Yankees are at Trevilians Depot.  They are nearer to us then they have ever been before.  Makes me feel anxious....

    
## May 3-9

 We start to church but hear on our way that a dispatch has come saying we may look out for the Yanks during the day. They have left Travilians and it is supposed they intend to try and burn the Rail Road Bridges. [This incident is called Stoneman's Raid.] We send Met back in haste; he is on horseback. We also turn back. When we get home find them busy packing away the horses, guns and silver. Spend an anxious day. The whole country seems to be alive. It is determined to defend the Bridges but at night all is quiet as no Yankees have come. They are aiming for some other point. Tuesday Lucy, Sally and John Robertson come in very unexpectedly. They were running from the Yanks; were at their uncle's in Louisa and the horse gave out so they stopped with us and spend the night. We also have a soldier to stay all night and he proved a very pleasant gentleman. Tuesday morning another alarm of Yanks. Dave goes off and stays for two days and a night. Don't believe we are to have a sight of them here. They seem to be partial to the "State of Flee" for whenever we have heard of their whereabouts in the last few days they have always been in the place. Last Saturday and Sunday, May 3 & 4, 1863, we fought the Yankees in Spotsylvania County [Chancellorsville Campaign] and gained a great victory but it was at the expense of our great Old Jackson's left arm. Thank God it was no worse. These are exciting times. The band of Yanks that have come in upon us from Trevilians have spread a panic on all the region round about. They have been to Ashland and destroyed quite an amount of stores besides damaging the rail road. We hear reports of their doings in all directions but many of these rumors are no doubt false though I believe they are capable of any kind of cruelty and meanness and will only be prevented from committing their lawless work by want of time. It is said that Mr. Divers, the old music teacher of Charlottesville, is an officer in this band of Feds ....Friday the 8th a large part of the Hampton Legion pass down the road; another fight brewing. Reading some of Scott's novels, *Redgauntlet* and *St. Ronans's Well*. They are old acquaintances. Finished Good's *Book of Nature*, it was both interesting and profitable. Have commenced Ferguson's *Rome* ....

    
## May 10-16 

 Do not go to church-roads too bad. Monday the 11th News. A great man has fallen! The great and good Jackson is no more. He died on Sunday the l0th at past three o'clock PM. With our weak faith and short sight it is hard for us to feel it is well and that we can do without him at such a time but God knows best and may He not think we are trusting too much in that "Arm of Flesh" forgetting that our Jackson was but a tool in His hands and for that reason He thought right to take him from us to remind us what we leant on and bring us back to look only to Him. It will in His own good time raise up others to us to free us from our enemies. General Jackson was a good Christian and has now gone to his reward. He has fallen in a good cause. His life for the last two years has been one of toil and tempest but he's at rest now where the wicked cease from troubling. No sound can awake him to glory again. A letter from little Sis. She is still looking or rather hoping for Jabe. Is still with Cousin Bab. Write to both her and Sue and also to Jabe. A letter from Lydia. She tells me Caroline [a slave woman at Music Hall] is dead. Sister Mary is so unfortunate. Henry Lewis calls to see us. Great excitement about corn. The government takes a good deal of Daddy's.

    
## May 17-23 

 Do not go to church; am too unwell. Henry Lewis to dinner ....[Letters written.] I'm very poorly with my nose cold. In my room most of the week, such a bad cold ....Bad news from our Army in Mississippi. It is said we have been badly whipped between Jackson and Vicksburg. Oh, if I could only hear from Sally and Jabe.

    
## May 24-30 

 Too poorly for church ....Jimmy Lewis calls Tuesday tells us he has a fine boy some two days old. A letter from Bob-says he has been doing some march lately that would do credit to Jackson's Foot Cavalry. Is still near Ginney's . Also a letter from Sue. She tells me of General Ewell's marriage to Mrs. Brown [Lizinka Campbell Brown.] Says she has seem a map of Stoneman's raid and that Charlottesville is marked one of the points they visited. Still very poorly with my cold; never knew it to be so bad before.

    
## May 31-June 6 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade from....an old sermon. A new cousin to see us today. He is from Louisiana and is named Marks and is Kin through the Meriwethers. He belonged to Taylor's old Brigade [General Richard Taylor's Louisiana's Brigade.] He was disabled by a wound in the wrist and is now unfit for service. He seems a nice little fellow; is quite handsome and talks well. 

  Mr. Macon and Charlotte to dine with us on Monday. Mr. M. pays me the interest on cousin Tom Meriwether's bond [which was part of the estate of brother Jim Minor and had apparently been given to Louisa for her support.]....wrote to Jabe and Bob. I had a letter from Jabe on Sunday. He is still in N.C.; still hoping to get off and to see me on his way home. Says his work in N.C. will certainly soon be finished but where they will send him then he can't say. I'm getting much better of my cold .... [Letters written and visitors call.]

    
## June 7-13 

 Willie Meade preaches ....Go after church home with sister Betty ....A letter from Sally. She has had to run from Calhoun. Is now in Grenada with an old Missouri friend. Hope Jabe may soon get to her or send for her to come to where he is. Saturday such a tribe of town girls to dinner. The cherries were the attraction no doubt. A great hue and cry raised against the cats for killing Turkeys which end in all being sent off but Tittums. I beg for him.

    
## June 14-20 

 Hear Mr. Meade [preach.]....Sue, John, Helen and cousin Ann get up on Saturday. Cousin Ann is so changed in looks. Poor woman, hers is a heavy heart now ....Thursday Jabe comes in just at dinner time very unexpectedly. Oh, how happy I am! Wonder if I would love my own brothers any better if I could see them. He is so affectionate towards me. I believe he does care a good deal for me. He is very hopeful about going South. If he is not sent then he will send right off for Sally. We talk over family affairs. Are both highly indignant at the conduct of one whose behavior is outrageous. Jabe gives me some interesting particulars of his sojourn down in North Carolina ....

    
## June 21-27 

 At church and have such a beautiful sermon from Bishop Gilmer ....A new sermon and a very fine one too. A letter from Lydia. She wants to come up. John leaves Monday morning. Wednesday Jabe and I go down to see Sister Mary. Carry Annie a big doll. She is so pleased. We return again on Friday after taking a peep at Aunt Sally and Cousin Fannie Hart. I'm introduced to the young rebel-Alice's baby. He is Jimmy [Lewis] in miniature ....Much excitement about Yankee raids. We hear Richmond is in danger from a force which is coming up by The Peninsula. They have really burnt the bridge across the South Anna River on the Central Rail Road. Expected Prissie, Mac and Emily up on Saturday but they did not come. Don't know whether the weather, it was a bad day, or Yankees stopped them ....

    
## June 28-July 4 

 Sunday a bad day. Jabe goes tomorrow ....We are all much excited by the war news. Hear Richmond is threatened again. The Yanks think Lee and his warriors are so far off now they can easily whip us. They had better try. Monday say good bye to Jabe. A heavy weight he is on my heart. When am I to see him again and will I ever get with my darling little sister again? Wait and Hope! Prissie Pemberton comes on Tuesday with her two little babes. Mac is quite poorly. The last of the week have a letter from Jabe. Tells me he is in luck; has been ordered to report at Jackson, Mississippi, so I hope he may soon be with Sally now ....

    
## July 5-11 

 At church but am too late to hear the text. Get home in a rain ....Sue and Co. did not get off today, Monday, as they expected as there is a report of a Yankee raid on the railroad ....A blue week we have; such bad news from all around. Vicksburg fell on the 4 July so all our hopes of peace from that quarter are nipped in the bud. Early in the week we get news of a great victory gained by General Lee at Gettysburg in Pennsylvania on the lst, 2nd and 3rd of July but later in the week we hear our Army has fallen back and it turns out one of those victorys in which a great deal of glory is gained but nothing more lasting. Our loss is very great; so many from around here have fallen. Among them are George Geiger, Bennet Taylor, Peter Minor and others. There is hope for some of them yet as many of our wounded were left in the Yankee lines. They may come to hand yet. How many many sad hearts are around us. It is hard to bear these sorrows with a proper spirit but it seems that God sees it necessary to cross us. We have been too puffed up with out continued successes of late. The Mac's leave us Saturday. The house seems so empty when they leave. I take solace in *Bulwer* ....

    
## July 12-18 

 At church and hear Mr. William Nelson .... Rainy weather and bad news. Such sad accounts of the slaughter of our poor men in Pennsylvania .... On Saturday we hear General Lee has crossed the Potomac and is again on Virginia soil with his Army. About ten o'clock Saturday night Dave comes in-brings two other soldiers with him. We are all real glad to see Dave once more. He gives us some hope of George Geiger, but thinks Peter Minor and Bennet Taylor are certainly dead.

    
## July 19-25 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....Some bright weather at last; fear it is too late to save the wheat crop. It is nearly all ruined by the long spell of hot weather we've lately had. Monday, Julia [Lewis] and Lydia come ....Have some nice walks with them. Sam sends Mary Lewis a carpet sack of Yankee goods which prove very acceptable to her as her wardrobe need replenishing just now. I fall heir to a lot of sewing silk and darning cotton; quite a treasure in these times ....

    
## July 26-Aug. 1 

 At church and hear Willie Meade preach ....We hear George Geiger is not very badly wounded and is a prisoner in Washington County. I feel so glad of it for Cousin Fanny's sake. Sam sends me some Yankee Pictorials which are amusing. Oh, how I want a letter from Mississippi; not a line since Jabe left Virginia. Some nice reading, Charles Lamb's *Letters, Essays,* etc. What a sad picture his life presents to us but he seemed to enjoy the brighter spots when they did come. His devotion to his poor afflicted sister was truly beautiful and when thinking of it can excuse his vices however revolting they may seem in a man of his genius and taste. In town with Lyd on Saturday and get her shawl. It is very handsome.

    
## Aug. 2-8 

 I do not go to church. Julia still with us. She could not get off as the cars were full of soldiers ....A long letter from Jabe and Sally. They are living in Lauderdale County, Mississippi. Jabe has a hospital in [Maj. General Samuel G.] French's division and Sally is with him. The sick and all live in tents in the midst of the forest. Say they have not only a comfortable but a very pleasant home in their "Tent in the Greenwood." There are some 5,000 sick and wounded around them all belonging to six divisions and most of the Surgeons have their families with them so there is plenty of nice society. Sally tells me her tent looks really elegant and she is so happy to be with Jabe. We hear George Geiger is certainly dead. Cousin Fanny had a letter from the minister who was with him. He died in Gettysburg. Poor cousin Fanny. What she cared for most in this life is gone from her forever here. [George Geiger had been adopted by Louisa's cousins Peter and Frances Tapp Meriwether who had no children of their own.] Mr. Poor is not dead, but badly wounded. Bennet Taylor is wounded and in Baltimore; His father thanks with his friends. Mr. Dowel [the overseer at Pantops] and his family leave this week. He will have to go into the Army as a conscipt. I feel much for them. They will feel the hard times now, I fear. Julia and Nan leave on Thursday. Lyd and I intended going too but sister Mary was busy and could not send for us. We hope to go on Monday. Dave left for the Army on Thursday ....Sally writes me that she has heard that brother Sam has raised a Company of Bush Whackers and has taken to the woods. I'm very sorry; had hoped he would keep quiet for the sake of his family ....[Letters written.]....

    
## Aug. 9-15 

 I do not go to church on accounted of an afflicted eye. Lydia and I have a cup of coffee ....Lydia and I go as far as Keswick on Monday; at Music Hall by dinner time .... In the evening we are invited to Castalia to eat ice cream in honor of Bob's birthday. The birthday came off last week, I believe, but he could not leave then, so they delayed the treat. Bob and Mr. Coffman are both up from Camp, which is near Gordonsville just now, for the night. We are up until about two o'clock in the morning. I don't enjoy visitors during the small hours of the night. A very quiet week ....Spend a day and night at The Creek and enjoy it much; am also at Uncle Bob's for short visits ....Lizzie [Minor] and Ellen Watson go off to "Frescuti" on Friday so Lyd, Sister Mary and I have a quiet time [with] nothing to excite us but soldiers. The cry is "still they come." We are quite overrun. Our Army is now scattered from Gordonsville to Fredericksburg so we have full benefit of the stragglers. The soldiers all think there is no chance for a fight just yet ....

    
## Aug. 16-23 

 No church ....On Monday evening cousin Howell comes by with some news for me. Sue has a daughter born Friday night, Aug. 14th. [Note at bottom of page -mistake, Saturday Aug.15th.] Cousin Howell saw Mammy Eliza, Dick and my black Mammy going down to Ashland this morning. It is quite a surprise. [The baby was premature.] I'm glad the event is over, am anxious to hear how Sue is ....Spend Wednesday at Uncle Bob's and have such a charming time. House full of soldiers from the hospital. They are Lizzie Dee's friends. They all seem to be gentlemen and some of them very pleasant. They were from Louisiana and North Carolina. There is also a very agreeable refugee lady from Baltimore, a Miss Gearing .... Lizzie Dee is down this week. She looks badly. I write to Mammy Eliza and Mary Lewis and also had letters from both of them. Mammy Eliza says Sue is very smart and the baby weighed four pounds. What a mite it must be ....Nanny Anderson with us the last of the week. On Friday the 21st, a Fast Day we attended church and heard a good sermon from Mr. Boyden....Bob gets home Saturday night from camp sick with fever.

    
## Aug. 23-29 

 At church in the morning and hear Mr. Boyden on the Manifold wisdom and goodness of God ....In the evening call to see Bob. He is sitting up but looks so wretchedly. Am introduced to Colonel Smead. Make another visit to The Creek this week and find Mr. [Aurelius King] Shay there. We have a gay time. Call at Mr. Pegrams; am introduced to the Rev. Mr. Calloway. Go one morning to see Mary Walker (Randolph). She looks so frail; has such a bad cough. Her baby is a fine boy born August 15th. She calls him George Geiger. Call to see Bob nearly every day. He is very poorly tho not dangerously ill. Jimmy Minor, too, is very sick. Nannie and I leave for home on Thursday with an escort made up by Mr. Shay, Lewis Fry and Charlie Lewis. [Lewis Fry is the grandson of Howel and Sarah Lewis and Charlie their son.] The two last are going to make Met a visit. At the Depot in town we find our two hospital acquaintances Levy and Smith. The "man of letters" is roughly handed. Get home to dinner; feel quite comfortable to be back again but such a blank in the household by the absence of Mammy Eliza and Dick. Mammy E writes that the baby is better. At one time they did not think it would live. Sue is doing well. Saturday I have a letter from Lizzie Minor. She tells me Jimmy and Bob are both better. Jimmy has gotten the Cadetship at [the Virginia Military Institute at] Lexington and will go over as soon as he gets well ....

    
## Aug. 30-Sept. 5 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....He is down on the extortioners and speculators who are now draining our land and it is time for all who have any patriotism, any Christianity in their hearts, to come out boldly and denounce them for without help from on High it must be the rock on which we must split yet. May God turn from us this evil and put it into our hearts to do right ...[Letters written.] Read [Joel] Barlow's *Strange Story* . It's well named for a stranger one I never read. Think he, Barlow, is about to loose himself in the mazes of his great learning, for in my humble opinion, his foothold is anything but sure in this sea of isms and ologies ....Go to town frequently and see our hospital friends ....[Visits made.]

    
## Sept. 6-13 

 At church and hear Mr. Slaughter....[Letters received.] Lizzie tells me Bob is much better. Jimmy is well and has been up to see me. He goes to Lexington this week. Sally and Jabe are still in Lauderdale and are very happy. They say they don't get any letters from me which must be the fault of the mails for I've written. I'm busy with the Scrap Book .... [Sue] tells us the little baby has been very poorly again. I fear she will be very delicate. Dine on Friday at Ridgway and have a pleasant time ....Read a letter (to Lydia) from Missouri of the date of July 27th. It is from her Father and Mother. Tells her of the death of Cousin Laurie Vaughan. Sister Lizzie speaks of brother Peter and brother Will's being in Illinois. I can't understand it. The letter comes through Vicksburg ....

    
## Sept. 13-19 

 A beautiful sermon from Mr. Meade.... Mary Lewis goes to Mr. Maury's....Paid $35 for a pair of garters. Think it time to do without shoes ....[Letters received and written.] Sue, John and the baby get up on Saturday. We are all so glad to have them with us again. The baby is a wee little thing, the smallest piece of humanity I ever saw but it has plenty of time to grow and in all probability will make a big woman if she lives to grow to womanhood. Sue is such an anxious mother. Well, it will require great attention and care to raise the little baby ....

    
## Sept. 20-26 

 At church and hear Dr. Harrold....Early Monday Sister Mary and Lizzie call by for me in the carriage to go shopping with them. We spend the day on the street and have a pleasant time; so much to hear from and say to her. Call to see Lizzie Dee and am introduced to Lizzie's friend, Mr. Cahill. Nannie A. is with us. Bob with us for a few days this week. He has gotten over his spell of fever but is not quite strong enough for the Army yet. Say goodbye to some of my soldier friends this week. They have been ordered to join their Regiments. Will we ever meet again and will the association have any influence on my life? The Father only can answer the question. Sister Mary tells me Lyd starts to school today ....Mary Lewis very sick. She is brought home from Mr. Maury's on Wednesday quite unwell and continued to get worse until Friday when there was a change for the better. We have gained a great victory out West lately. [General Braxton] Bragg and Co whipped [General William S.] Rosecranz [sic] near Chattanooga on the 27th ( I think) badly. May we give Him all the glory for without the help of His Almighty Power our enemy must trample us in the dust. Cool pleasant weather.

    
## Sept. 27-Oct. 3 

 At church but have to leave as I'm quite sick. Have cousin George [Macon] to see me get home and get better. Missed Dr. Sparrows sermon which I was sorry for. A visit this week from a cousin of Daddy's from Culpepper, a Mr. Gaines. He is a refugee from his home now for the second time since the war commenced. They have now burnt and carried off everything belonging to him but his land. Poor refugees, they are much to be pittied. Met Mac is up for several days ....Sue's little baby very poorly. I'm enjoying such a nice book, *Mrs. Hannah Mores Memoirs*. Will speak more at length of them when I get through. Bob spends Saturday night with us. We have a talk that is not altogether charitable.

    
## Oct. 4-10 

 Hear Mr. Meade....Go home with Sister Betty after church. In the evening Sister Betty and I go to The Delevan hospital to see Jimmie Watson and hear from Johnnie Watson who was very badly wounded in the last fight in Orange County. We saw Jimmie and Cousin Fannie Sheppard ....Poor Johnnie, I fear is mortally wounded and the poor boy is entirely unconsious of his danger. Get home Monday to dinner. Mary Walker Randolph died Sunday night. Why is it that the young and beautiful and those whose cup of happiness seem full to overflowing should be called home whilst those whose cross is very heavy and their most earnest prayer is to be gone, should be left to watch and search on? It is not for us to question. God knows what is right and best and will one day make it plain to us. Tuesday I'm at Clover Fields and see the body of my old and dear friend given to its mother earth. She is the first of our little band of five who lived so happily together as school mates that has been called home. She died as she had lived, a Christian and is home in the enjoyment of that perfect peace ....

    
## Oct. 11-17 

 Hear Mr. Nelson preach from the text "And they made light of it." Monday the 12th sent Emily's verses on "Counting the Cost" to the *Churchman*. Hope they may be appreciated by Mr. Sprigg and they may be given a place in His Poet's Corner. I think they deserve it. Oct. the 13th sent off poor Tittums to the mill. It made my heart feel sad to see him start for I've had some pleasant hours with him. Poor puss! I can but wonder what will be your fate. Write Bob Minor to ask if he can clear up the mystery about brother Peter (vis his being in Chicago practicing his profession.) Wednesday the 14th Ma, Nannie, Ellen and I go down to Uncle Bob' s for a visit of one night. Call in the evening to see Sister Mary. Lyd and I talk over business matters including her dresses for the winter and how she should spend the money she got for her red merino dress. Cousin Ann Mac sold it for me in Richmond. I got about $30 per yard for it. Lyd has had another letter from her Mother and Father and I feel much relieved about brother Peter as brother Sam tells Lyd he is proud to say he is doing good service to our cause-so the report was false as I thought it. My heart feels lightened of a heavy load. Aunt Sally tells me a secret. A heavy rain comes up Wednesday evening so we do not get home until Friday about dinner time. Bring some of the new Molasses with us to treat on. Uncle Bob has gone largely into the business this year. We take down Peggy, the cat, to Aunt Sally so Peck II is my only cat pet now. Find Sue's little baby very poorly. I have many fears for it. Have a very kind letter in the evening from Dr. Sprigg, he accepts my verses; says they will appear in the next week or two-requests me to send more. An era in Met's life. He aimed a successful shot for the first time and brought down a squirrel on Saturday the 17th. He killed four squirrels and a bird. I hardly think the house will hold him now. News of two cavalry fights this week, in both of which we were victorious. Oh, that so many laurels would only conduct us to the Olive Branch! Am thankful to hear Dave is safe.

    
## Oct. 18-24

 Such a beautiful sermon from Dr. Wilmer....The Christ of History. Visitors this week .... Finish reading *Mrs. Hannah Mores Memories* in two vols. I'm much entertained with what ease she writes. Think I shall recommend her letters as speciments of epistology art. Late Friday evening Dave comes home. He has been slightly wounded in the fight on Monday at Buckland [Mills in Prince William County.] He brings me the bullet that hurt him ....Buy a new Calico dress and for the 8 yards, English Goods, pay $56, and a pair of grey flannel gloves, pay $10 for. Did I ever believe I should live to see such times! "Counting the Cost" comes out in the *Churchman* this week.

    
## Oct. 25-31 

 No church, it is too muddy ....Winter is coming fast upon us and I fear it will be one of suffering and want to many. May we all be willing to suffer much and be cheerful under it all for the sake of the great cause (our liberties) for which we are contending and may God help and strengthen us. Go on Friday to Orange Dale for a visit of a few days ....We have such nice tea parties. Uncle Elijah tries very hard to make a Baptist of me. Lends me "The Voice" with the hope it may lighten my darkness on the subject of water and the quantity necessary to save.

    
## Nov. 1-7 

 Sunday is All Saints. Hear Mr. Meade....A beautiful discourse on the duties and responsibilities both of sponsor and child at the Font. I come home after church much against my will [as I] wanted to stay with cousin Isabella but found I could not get home when I wished as the carriage was in use ....

    
## Nov 8-14. 

  Hear Mr. Meade [preach.]....Dave and I walk over to town Friday, met Lydia by appointment at the Depot and go up together to Rugby where I spend the night ....Dave and Lydia tell me a secret. I'm not altogether pleased; had hoped she would have waited until she got back to Missouri to fix up such affairs; fear some trouble will come of it. Get home Saturday to dinner and have a long letter in the evening from my darling little Sis. She is still in Lauderdale and expects to be there all the winter ....

    
## Nov. 15-21

 At church and hear Mr. Slaughter....Sue, John, Mary Lewis and the little baby leave us on Wednesday; quite a gap made in the home circle...Read Uncle Elijah's book *Theodosia*.  A bigoted uncharitable affair; fear I've not been edified by its perusal.

    
## Nov. 22-28

 Do not attend Church. Cousin Howel has had a letter from Mr. Bacon. [James T. Bacon, his son-in-law, who lives in Brooklyn, New York.]  He tells of the death of Miss Vallent's brother. [Louisa inserted below, mistake it was his brother who died] I feel for the dear little woman for I know how much he was to her. Send Mr. Sprigg some more poetry and another letter. Hope he won't think me troublesome. A good story on Mary Lewis. John sent a telegram to Sam informing him of Mary Lewis' and Sue's arrival in Ashland and by some means, it got into the papers. News this week that we've been whipped out West at Chattanooga. General Bragg has had to give up (his command).

    
## Nov. 29-Dec.5 

 No church. Roads too bad. Some nice reading. Write to Lydia and Mary Lewis. I'm very much fascinated with *Horace Walpole*. What beautiful letters he writes but is decidedly too fond of scandal and is at times anything but delicate .... Quite an era in my monotonous life. Saturday I go out visiting in town and call at Mr. Meade's....

    
## Dec. 6-12 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....An old sermon....Hear often from Music Hall by Dave who is a very frequent visitor. He tells me Dick [Minor] has had measles and it was thought Annie was about ready for them. I hope some of them may come off scott free. What a lot of courting must have been and still is going on at Music Hall, Castalia and the Creek. Bob and Lizzie [Minor] until very lately, Dave and Lyd, Lizzie Dee and Mr. Cahill, and Julia [Lewis] and little Mr. Shay. An interesting place just now. My friends are anxious for me to spend Xmas with them but I am not in the spirit for gaiety so I'll stay at home quietly ....I have to be nurse and housekeeper too. Mary Lewis writes word the baby is improving fast with her black mammy (The Doctor prescribed a Black Mammy for the young Lady after she returned to Ashland). Poor little thing, no doubt she was half starved was what the matter with her while with us. Saturday Dave leaves us.

    
## Dec. 13-19 

 A bright Sunday but I can't leave Ma to go to church .... Henry Lewis to visit us. We talk over old times; the merry happy days we've spend together. Seeing him recalled some of the happiest days of my life. Dave back again Wednesday night. He has a tale of woe to tell me. All's off between him and Lydia. Well, I can't say I feel very sorry for it for I trembled for the result. Feel sorry for him; can't think Lydia has treated him exactly right. He finds his company has gone to The Valley so he has to join Co. Q for awhile. The Camp is near Mr. Browns. He is at home again the last of the week. Sell my hog this week. He weighed 158 and brought me $316, quite a windfall ....Ma is much better by the middle of this week. Insists upon taking the keys ....

    
## Dec. 20-26 

 Do not go to church as Uncle Hatter is visiting his daughter. John up for a night. Reports them all well-that Miss Eliza is beginning to show a bright face; laughs, takes much notice of affairs going on around her. Mary Lewis does not even talk of returning home. Go to town on Monday and see Mr. Brown and get my money for the Pig, $312. Pay all my debts and treat myself to a whole lb of tea for which I paid $35. Give Ann [a slave woman who was probably caring for the pig for Louisa] for her share $150; made Nanny a present of $20, Ellen $5, Met $8 and when Mr. Hornsey and the others to whom I owed money were paid off there was not very much left. I feel very perfectly satisfied to know that I owe no man anything though I've nothing left. Dave brings me a cousin from Camp to spend a night with us, Frank Meriwether from Bedford County. He is very good looking, agreeable too ....The 2nd Regiment is disbanded for the next 30 days, the men all sent home to feed up the horses and get them in better order. A letter from Lyd. She is spending her Xmas at Rugby; wants to see me very much, says she is in much trouble and needs my advice and sympathy. I must go to her for I feel it right ....Xmas Day is cloudy. Dull times but I enjoy myself with my books, writing etc ....

    
## Dec. 27-31 

 Sunday a rainy day-also Monday. Tuesday I go to town enroute for Rugby. A letter from Dave. State Secrets. He thinks there can be no reconstruction of the union. Spend several days at Rugby. See Lyd and hear all her troubles; fear I can't help her ....Wednesday the children have a dance. I join them. The music was from two fiddles and the piano. The beaux were plenty but a scarcity of girls. I had my fun. The quiet life I had at home makes me feel that I had no desire for gaiety but I find when I get a chance I get into a merry party and the old taste returns and I enjoy a dance as much as ever ....[Visits paid.] I'm in much trouble about the servants; think they are very unreasonable and troublesome. [The end of the year is the time when Louisa must make arrangements for her slaves that she has been hiring out, as the contracts all expire at the end of the year. ]

## Jan. 1-2 

  The New Year comes in bright and blistering. How many changes are in store for me this year? I can and will trust all to Him who alone can direct all events. Spend the day with cousin Isabella ....Get home late in the evening after the coldest ride I ever had (was in the waggon). Saturday set my house in order which means my closet, drawers, shelves, etc.

    
## Jan. 3-9 

 No church. A quiet Sunday. Monday begin school ....[Letters written.] Am in great worry about the servants. Mr. Brown and I have a meeting at Uncle Sam's on Friday where he makes me an offer [to purchase Louisa's slaves] which I'm much inclined to take. It will be decided soon, I hope and then I will not be troubled any more with the darkies ....

    
## Jan. 10-16 

 No church. Bad roads again. Have an invite to a real dancing party at Rugby on Friday night. It was Mr. Brown's party and not a starvation. I do not go. The present seems no time for such gaiety and yet such an amount of merry making was never known around here and I hear its the same thing all though the Confederacy. To any one who though about it, it is plain we are now under God's frown and is such indulgences of our animal feelings a way to appease Him? Does this look as if we are humbled and we looked only to Him for help? Dave attended the party and gave me the points. Wrote to Mary Lewis. Finished reading *Horace Walpole's Letters*. I'm alternately entertained and offended; pleased and disgusted! Nannie and I have begun reading aloud *Little Dorrit*. I proposed it, because I though it would bring us more together and she seemed to feel so lonely since Mary Lewis left .... We missed getting ICE. The river is too full.

    
## Jan. 17-23

 A bright day but I'm sick and can't go to church. Begin *Gregory's Evidences*.	The hen house is in operation, at least we, Met and I, have commenced in Ma's duck house. Mr. Pemberton makes us two visits this week. His Regiment, the 4th Cavalry, was disbanded on Thursday and the men sent home for a rest until some time in April unless they are needed. On Friday, Nannie and I attended a party at Mrs. McGhees. I enjoyed it but my conscience did not feel quite easy ....[A letter from] Cousin Bob [Minor who] was one of the band that lately made an attempt to liberate our brave men imprisoned on Johnson's Island. Tells they were betrayed in the hour of success and their plan failed.

    
## Jan. 24-30 

 I'm at church and hear Mr. Nelson....He is hard on the gay times. Well, he's right but I don't believe preaching against it will mend matters. A long letter from Sally and Jabe. They are very comfortably fixed at Shelby Springs, Alabama .... I'm in trouble about the darkies. Have Uncle Bob and cousin Howel to advise me ....

    
## Jan. 31-Feb. 6 

 At church and have sermon from Mr. Meade....He too is down on the gaiety of the people at such a time as this; says it is a spark of madness. Thinks we compare well to Nero's fiddling while Rome burnt. There was but too much truth in all he said ....It was decided on Monday that my darkies should be hired for this year. Something may be done next; perhaps it is all right for the money is worth so little now ....

    
## Feb. 7-13 

 A rainy Sunday so no church. Ash Wednesday the l0th we attend church and have a very suitable address from Mr. Boyden. Dr. Douglas Meriwether and Miss Nannie Page were married on the 9th. They get home this week. I make a visit to cousin Sarah and Aunt Sally. Have a private chat with Sister Mary, Aunt Sally and Lyd and make matters all right .... [Letters received and written.] Lyd is in great excitement about getting home [to Missouri.] I hardly think it practicable.

    
## Feb. 14-20 

 At church and hear Mr. Boyden read the Bishop's Letter. Find sister Betty at Music Hall on our return. Monday I spend with cousin Peggy Nelson. Am quite sick this week with a cold. Bad news from home. Peck has been caught in the Steel Trap and lost a leg. Make the acquaintance of a nice little soldier while down, Lieutenant Smith. He is Aunt Sally and cousin Sarah's pet. His health is very bad. Get home Saturday after quite a number of adventures. Among them was the non-arrival of the cars which obliged me to stall all night at Cobham which was much against my will as there was a large party going on in the house all night. However, I did not appear in the ball room. The next day coming up I mashed my hand badly with one of the car windows. Do not get home til near night .... Peck is getting much better but his leg is clean gone. I'm glad to be home again. Nanny is confined to her room with a frostbit foot. Great excitement everywhere about the new money arrangements. It will fall heavily on Mary Lewis as her pig money had all been paid in large notes. It was afterwards satisfactorily arranged.

    
## Feb. 21-27 

 Do not go to church as I can't wear my glove. Am in bed a day or so this week with my cold ....We get some ice during a cold spell last week which will be appreciated next summer.-A letter from Bob Minor. He thinks there is no chance for Lydia getting to Missouri.

    
## Feb. 28-March 5 

 At church and hear Mr. B. B. Nelson....An eventful week. The Yanks are making a raid on us. [This is Custer's Raid or The Rio Bridge Raid.] On Monday there was a little fight at Rio where they burnt the bridge and mill and did much other damage and carried off many servants. We heard the cannonading very plainly and at night saw the light of their destroying fires. Not much sleep all Monday night. Met and the Taylor boys [from Lego, the neighboring plantation] were sent off with the horses to a safe place. The cattle and sheep were in a state of readiness to be driven off if the Yanks got any nearer. The next morning our soldiers arrived and what a feeling of security they brought with them but it made me feel as if the war was being brought to our very doors. The cannons were drawn before the front gate and placed upon the two highest points overlooking the railroad bridge and the whole place swarmed with soldiers. The house was HeadQuarters and we had some nice officers to stay with us; among them Kate Whitehead's brother, Col. [Whitehead.]....Wednesday evening we got news that the Yanks had gone back so our soldiers moved too and by Thursday morning not one was to be seen but we were not allowed to be quiet long for in the evening two brigades from the Valley camped on Pantops and Lego [the home of Jefferson Randolph Taylor] for the night. As a matter of course we had many visitors and some of them not altogether agreeable. Officers to supper. Stragglers for several days afterwards. Thursday night the camp fires were the prettiest things I ever saw. They seemed as countless as the stars in the heavens. It is generally supposed we are on the eve of a great battle. The Yanks, we heard, did much mischief in the county. The raiders seem to have confined themselves to thieving. From negroes and horses to the rings off the ladies hands nothing seemed too trifling to escape the notice of this heroic noble band of braves!? A letter from Bob. He tells me he has found the truth as it is in Jesus and has not been ashamed to confess Him before men. He was baptized and admitted to the Holy Communion on the lst Sunday in February. May God give him grace to keep his lamp trimmed and burning so he may be found ready when his Master calls.

    
## March 6-12 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....Such perfect quiet after the exciting scenes of last week. Would not imagine a soldier had been in a hundred miles of us ....[Letters written.]

    
## March 13-19 

 At church and hear Mr. Meade....Subject: Fasting. Finish my War Scrap Book to March 1864. Do some work in the garden ....Read several letters from Missouri to Dave.--Brother Peter is certainly in Illinois but can't know what he is about. Well, I can trust him!...[Letters received and written.]

    
## March 20-26 

 At church and hear Mr. Magill....Passion Week. Church every day. I stay with Lizzie Wood and other friends that I may attend. Meet a Missourian and a cousin, Mr. Dabney Carr. He tells me not to feel uneasy concerning Brother Peter, that he is as true as steel . .... Thursday Lydia comes. Her health is not as good as I could wish ....Good Friday the 25th is Ma's 71st birthday. Snowing hard all this evening.

    
## March 27-April 2 

 At church and hear Dr. Sparrow....John comes today. We are surprised not to see Mary Lewis with him. Monday he and Lydia leave together ....

    
## April 3-9 

 No church. Some rain and hail this week ....Dave gets in from camp Sunday evening and is off again on Monday making ready to join the Missourians in Alabama. My nephew Sam Minor from Missouri with us. He comes from Illinois where his Father (brother Will) and family are now living. They were driven from their home in Missouri by the Union force. Sam says brother Peter is there and is battling gravely with his longing for the South. A note from cousin Lou Leitch. She intends going to roomkeeping in her old house. 

    
## April 10-16 

 No church. Roads too bad. Dave and Sam with us. Letter from Sally and Jabe this week. They do not seem settled. Jabe has not been well treated by the Medical Director. Get the garden fixed up and it looks really pretty. We look for Sue and Mary Lewis but they do not come. [General James] Longstreet's Army is passing through on their way back from Tennessee. All seem to think we are to have some war this Spring. Our men are in fine spirits and confident of success. May the God of all power and might be with us and give us the victory.

    
## April 17-23 

 No church. The Army still passing. How sad to think of how many of the soldiers now so full of life and hope but marching to certain death. Many heads will soon lie low and Oh, the aching hearts at home .... Sue, Mary Lewis, John, Eliza and Co. get up on Monday. The baby has grown some but she is still a very small bit .... Sam says goodbye to me on Saturday as he goes to Western Virginia to join his company. He is in [General Micah] Jenkins Command. I feel quite attached to the boy. I hope he may be safe.

    
## April 24-30 

 No church ....Willie Minor up today. He tells us Nelly [a slave at Music Hall] is dead. The disease was typhoid fever. The army still passing by night and day.

    
## May 1-7

 A bright day but parts of the road too bad for the carriage to get up ....[Letters written and visitors call.] A letter from Sam. [He] is with his command near the Warm Springs. Expects soon to start west on his expedition. A dangerous undertaking. I feel uneasy about him. The fight on the Rapidan [The Wilderness Campaign] commenced this week on Thursday the 5th. I believe up to Saturday we were successful but oh, 	the suffering around us. Charlottesville is full of the poor wounded soldiers and the cry is "still they come." Col. Warren, Jennie Magruder's husband, is among the killed ....

    
## May 8-14 

 No church. The fighting continues and Lee still victorious. We also hear that General [Frederick] Steel[e] and his army of 9000 Yankees have surrendered to our brave old General Price in Arkansas. General Dick Taylor has also been successful in Louisiana. Oh, that so many victories would but bring us peace ....Hear of the death of David Watson and James Magruder. The former died from wounds received in battle; the latter was killed instantly while commanding The Light Horse. We are in doubt as to Bob's fate. His company had been nearly all taken or killed. The [Scottsville] Greys are taken but were afterwards recaptured. Anxious times for all. I'm very poorly with my nose cold.

    
## May 15-21 

 Spend Sunday at home again ....We are still in anxiety about the result of this long weary blood battle. So far we believe our arms have the ascendancy but what will the end be? God only knows and in Him only can we look for deliverance from our foes. Jimmy Lewis up this week and tells us Bob is safe. He managed to make his escape when the Guns of the Battery and so many of the men were taken. The Cadets [from The Virginia Military Institute] have been sent down to General Lee with Jimmy Minor among them. It seems hardly right to put such boys, almost children, in the war. In the late fight in western Virginia [The Battle of New Market] under [General John C.] Breckinridge they were highly complimented for their bravery. Poor fellows, they suffered much too; had a good many killed and a large number wounded. We are in constant expectation of the Yankee Raiders. No trains running so we can get but little news.

    
## May 22-28 

 Still watching and waiting the end of the battle. Both armies in motion toward Richmond ....Ma very poorly.

    
## May 29-June 4 

 Ma too sick for me to go to church. She improves; however, in a few days so as to be able to go about. She is getting very feeble ....Some more company too. A Battle [The Battle of Cold Harbor] on Friday near Richmond. We were victorious, killing a large number of the Yankees. Sue and the baby very poorly. No news from absent friends. How I want a letter from my little sister. Feel anxious too to know of Dave's whereabouts.

    
## June 6-11 

 At church and hear such a beautiful sermon from Mr. Norton....Early Monday morning I get a note from Lydia bringing sad news. Dear little Annie Laurie has gone to join her father in the Spirit Land. She died at three o'clock Monday morning June 6th. She was buried on Tuesday. I was not able to be present as we are in hourly expectation of Yankee Raiders. Dear little niece. I little thought when with you in February that it would be my last sight of you on earth. It is hard to give you up, so bright and beautiful as you were but God knows best and He will someday make it all plain to dim faith. Poor Sister Mary, she is indeed tried sorely. May the Holy Spirit comfort and guide her so she may not faint in this day of adversity ..... I go down to Music Hall. Oh, what a blank the bonnie Annie Laurie has left in that household! Sister Mary is very sad. She makes an effort to be busy about her duties and though so calm I can see the anguish at her heart. Everything and place brings her lost darling back so plainly. May God help her. She talks much about little Annie. Tells me all the particulars of her sickness and death. I enjoy my visit with the exception of the fright I had in hearing the Yanks were so near us. On Saturday the 11th was alarmed by being told that I was really out of Dixie as we were out of the lines of pickets.

    
## June 12-18 

 At Grace Church and hear Mr. Boyden.... Great excitement about the Raiders on the 12th. They fought us near Travilians in Louisa and we whipped them well. Anxious times for us poor women. All the men in the neighborhood have gone to the fight and we can get no news of anything. All we can hear and see is the heavy cannonading and the thick black smoke which tells us the vandals are at work. There are no news either up or down and we hear such wild rumors that I begin to feel troubled about home and its inmates. However we gradually quiet down. On Wednesday General [Jubal A.] Early's corps passes up the road. A party of us go up to the Shop to see it, the Army, pass. We have a very pleasant time. Major General [S. Dodson] Ramseur introduced himself and his staff to us and who should be of it but my old acquaintance, Mr. Tom Taliaferro. He recognized me. We had quite a pleasant chat of the old times and the people who were then young. General Ramseur was very agreeable, also his subs. Through Major Douglas the General gave me a S.C. button off the coat in which he was wounded. Altogether I had a very pleasant day. Made quite a number of visits while down .... Sam Minor comes one day this week. Says the Yanks came in too fast in Western Virginia and did not give him a chance to get out. However, he hopes to do so yet.

    
## June 19-25 

 In church. Monday I get home in Cousin Peggy's carriage. Find the Yanks had not hurt any of them. John still here. A deal of company this week. We are all quieting down about the Raiders. The mails are coming in again and we have the good news that they (The Yanks) had been whipped at all points. Oh, how blessed we have been. All around us we may say they have gone but we have been spared and spared oh, how much, for the heart sickens at the account of outrages committed by the barbarians, for they well deserve the name, in all places that have been visited by them.

    
## June 26-July 2 

 At church and hear Mr. Latane....Monday say goodbye to Sam. He hopes to get off to Illinois this time. We hear from Dave he is in Shelby Springs and is with Sally and is sick. Uncle Bob calls Thursday morning; tells me Gandy Lewis was killed near Petersburg, on the 26th of June I think, while acting as a sharp shooter. Captain Gibbs also falls in battle last week. Such hot dry weather. A hard season on the crops and so much depending on them. Write a long letter to Sally and Jabe. Hear from Sam when he got to Staunton. His Regiment is at the Warm Springs ....

    
## July 3-9 

 Mr. Slaughter preached for us ....Go home with sister Betty where I stay until Wednesday. Have a pleasant time. She and I go visiting. One evening we are invited to take tea and eat ice cream at Mrs. Dukes and a very sociable time we had. I spend Wednesday and Wednesday night with cousin Lou. Enjoy being with her once more. Ma and I spend a day together at Orange Dale. I get home Thursday evening .... The dry weather still continues. Get a message from Miss Morril [Carrie Morril had left Virginia and gone north to her home in Bangor, Maine] ] in a letter from her to Lucy Butler about my friend Emily. It amounted to the fact that Emily was still in Africa and would not return to America until failing health obliged her. So far she had been blessed with good health and strength for her work a fact unknown of in all the history of the mission for the first trial of the climate. God watches over and kept his own ....

    
## July 10-16 

 At church and hear Mr. B.B. Nelson.... Another letter from Sam. He has been sick but was better when he wrote; was then in Bath County and expected to start the next day for the West. The drought continues. News from our Army. We have crossed the Potomac again. It is thought there is a plot in hand to take Point Lookout and liberate our brave men imprisoned there. The affair must have been decided in this but events are kept very quiet as to (General Jubal) Early's movements. Little Eliza very ill. John comes up the last of the week. Cousin Isabella and Sarah come to help to nurse Eliza. I'm sick enough to see cousin George. Write a long letter to Dave.

    
## June 17-23 

 No church. Poor little baby still very ill. The dry weather still upon us. It is fearful to see vegetation all brown and dry but we must not forget that a wise and good One sends the drought upon us and tho the fields and crops be parched by scorching beam yet our trust must be in Him for though His power is just, His mercy is Supreme. The Cockade City [Peterburg, Virginia] holds out bravely. There is some chance I should suppose for U.S. Grant changing his Vicksburg laurels for Chickahominy willows. Old Jubal [Early] may well be dubbed the Hot Boy of the war for it seems he went into Maryland with no intention of fighting but for the sole purpose of driving off cattle and horses and picking up anything in the shape of provisions that came in his way. Well! Perhaps it was the wisest policy for we can very well afford to rest upon our Laurels just now, but short rations are not altogether comfortable. We hear Saturday of a great victory gained by us at Atlanta. General [John Bell] Hood has made a good beginning. The baby is much better this week; has engaged a Nanny Goat to supply her with rations. Ma quite poorly for a day or two this week. Two slight showers of rain but it benefits vegetation but little. Had a letter from Dave. He is with the Army of Tennessee and is having a hard time in the trenches. Has found some kin way down South. Wrote to him in reply on Saturday.

    
## July 24-30 

 No church. Might say with Mrs. Browning, "A week which perished silently," so little of incident was there in it. A good rain Sunday night (too late I fear to help the corn) ....The baby better. Old [General Jubal] Early has gone into Maryland again. [Louisa is probably referring to Early's Washington Raid, July 2 thru 13.] This time it is said to fight. Hope he may get as far north as Pennsylvania. I'm rather conscientious about any depradations committed South of Pennsylvania. A letter from Sally. Jabe has been ordered to Atlanta. She is still at Shelby. She thinks Jabe will return when the battles are over. Nannie and I have some reading together. No more at present-Yawns etc.

    
## July 31-Aug. 6

  No church. A good rain today ....Some...company....

    
## Aug. 7-13 

 At church and hear an old sermon from Mr. Meade....The baby poorly again. Poor little thing, her trials of this world and its pleasures has been naught but bitterness so far. A Vale of Tears in reality. Late Saturday evening Dave gets home from the South. He has had fever and is off on sick furlough; looks very weakly ....

    
## Aug. 14-20 

 No church. Fine rains this week ....A letter from Sally. She is still by herself. Jabe is at Covington, Georgia, but expects to go back to Shelby. Also a letter from Lydia; she is at Rugby.

    
## Aug. 21-27 

 No church. Do some work for Dick. Make him four jackets. Niece Lizzie and Bob Lewis to dine with us. The light of other days is faded and all the joys are passed. Well such is the way of the world. Will I ever learn wisdom by sad experience? [I] fear not.

    
## Aug. 28-Sept. 3

  At church and hear Dr. Sparrow....A visit from three cadets-all from Mississippi-friends of Dave's.Nannie and I read Ivanhoe aloud.

    
## Sept. 4-10 

 At church and hear a sermon from Mr. Meade. Early Monday morning Madam Nanny Goat and her two infants arrive. They are friends of Elizas ....Atlanta has fallen. We evacuated it on the 3rd. Well, Old Abe, no doubt, considers it another feather in his cap. It seems a hard matter for those southern cities to stick.

    
## Sept. 11-17

 No church ....Mary Lewis and I go to Sister Mary's on Thursday [where] Sally Pride joins our party ....Arrive at Music Hall to dinner and find all glad to see me. A wedding on the carpet! In consequence of the tale of Atlanta, Robert thinks that he and Lizzie ought to hurry up things. Sister Mary finally consents and Wednesday of next week is fixed upon. I do some visiting around and enjoy myself ....

    
## Sept. 18-24 

 At Aunt Sally's. A rainy Sunday so we do not go to church. Monday at The Creek with Aunt Sally and Sally Pride. Cousin Howel comes in after dinner with a report that the Yanks are near at hand via Gordonsville. We hasten home and oh, what excitement. After dark it is thought advisable that the younger women should be sent off to the mountains, so we are roused up from our beds. I decide to stay with sister Mary at the house. About midnight our fears are quieted and we hear the Yanks have all gone back so the household subsides into quietness. The idea of taking to the woods was very ridiculous to me. It originated in Bob's fears for his treasure. All busy getting ready for the marriage. There is but little preparation but even little made work. Wednesday the 21st of September-Lizzie's Wedding Day! A gloomy day out but I trust it is not ominous. By night it is rainy. The only guests were Uncle Bob's family including Sally Pride, cousins Sarah and Howel, Nannie, Julia, Nicky, [Sarah, Howel, Nannie, Julie and Nicky Lewis of The Creek] Mary Lewis and I. All is done very orderly and quiet. Lizzie and Bob are made man and wife by Mr. Boyden who uses my book. A nice plain supper; ice cream and cake afterwards. Well the young people have my best wishes for their welfare but I can't help wishing it was put off until times were more settled. Thursday night we are at Uncle Bob's to supper and have a pleasant time. Jimmy Minor is at home now and is so much improved. I enjoy myself laughing at him and Julia. Poor Sister Mary, it seems a hard trial to her giving up her daughter into another's keeping. Quiet times after the wedding. Some few callers [and calls made.] ....Nanny Anderson comes down Friday and stays until Saturday. Says Eliza is much better.

    
## Sept. 25-Oct. 1 

 At church and hear Mr. Boyden. A quiet week. Mary Lewis leaves for Uncle Bob's; also Alice and Co. Monday I go to Mechunk to see Cousin Lucy and enjoy my visit though it was a sad one. Feel that it is good for me to go to the house of mourning for it opens my heart and arouses my sensibilities. Am introduced to the teacher, Miss Wilson from the Cockade City. Alice's little boy George very sick from Tuesday with dyptheria. Saturday night he died. Poor little child, his sufferings were great through the whole of his illness but it is well with him now. He was put away on Monday Oct. 3rd at Music Hall by the side of dear little Annie Laurie.

    
## Oct. 2-8 

 A big Yankee fight. We hear early in the day they are certainly in Charlottesville and were then on their way down the main road. Never did as much hiding before. Put away all our clothes. Sent all the provisions to the mountain, also the stock of all kinds and after all our trouble about 3 o'clock in the evening hear there have been no Yanks near town though the people there were as much frightened as we were. Well we sleep well that night after our hard work. It certainly had not been a day of rest to any of us. A "Stir Up Sunday" though out of time. Mary Lewis very ill Tuesday night in consquence of over working herself nursing little George and helping to hide things from the Yanks. Doctor sent for in the night to see her. Sunday, Uncle Bob's house was a scene of strange confusion. Everyone excited to the highest pitch, running to and fro putting out of sight as best they could everything valuable. Jimmy Lewis and Uncle Bob in the mountains afraid to venture back and little George [George Lewis was the toddler son of Jimmy and Alice Lewis] a corpse in the house. Truly these are sad trying times when we are not even permitted to bury our dead in quietness. By Wednesday, Mary Lewis is quite well again so I come up home on Thursday. Music Hall will be quite short of males soon. Bob [Lewis] and Jimmy [Minor] (the cadets have been ordered to report for duty in the field until the lst of Nov) in the Army; Jimmy Lewis with the Reserves and Willie [Minor] at school. Only the two little boys at home. Find all well at home. Mary Lewis does not come with me. Ma is busy with her apple harvest. A long letter from Sally and Jabe. The Yanks have run them from their late home. Jabe has a post in Cuthbert, Georgia, which both he and little Sis like as a home very much ....Sue left Pantops while I was away. John was afraid the Yanks would get her up here so took off Sue, Eliza, Emily and Nanny Goat. Quite a void they make in the household.

    
## Oct. 9-15

 Do not go to church. Have diptheria for the first time; a mild case, however. Nanny acts the Good Samaritan and tends me most carefully but I can't say that her caustic felt like oil to my tender throat. A visit from my nephew Sam Eastin from Missouri. He has come to join the Army of the South. [He] is a great big man and rather good looking ....

    
## Oct. 16-22 

 I'm too poorly for church. Monday my throat is well enough for me to go anywhere I like. Begin school. Write to Mary Lewis. Finish Dick's jacket which will set off the new shirts finely. Nanny and I call at Mr. Taylor's. We are introduced to Mrs. General Trimble, [the wife of General Isaac Ridgeway Trimble] a pleasant lady. Merry Anderson [Meriwether L. Anderson son of Dr. M.L. Anderson of Locust Hill was a member of General Fitzhugh Lee's Cavalry] was killed in one of the fights last week in the Valley. [Sheridan's Valley Campaign.] His body was brought home and buried. He was a noble boy. On the 27th of September died my friend, relative and Godmother, cousin Sarah Gilmer. None knew her but to love her. It grieves me to think I shall see her sweet kind face no more but my sorrow is selfish for hers is perfect enjoyment now being joined to that multitude which no man can number who sing the praises of God and of the Lamb forever and ever. She was over 80 (in her 82nd year) years of age. A letter from Nicky Lewis.

    
## Oct. 23-29 

 Hear Dr. Sparrow....Working hard at my school and knitting all the week. A visit of two days from Sam. Write to Sally and Dave. We hear from the last he is in Montgomery, Alabama, with his cousin Mathews. Mary Lewis still away ....

  No church. Go Saturday to Rugby ....Mr. Brown and I arrange about the servants for next year. Hope they may all get comfortable homes.

    
## Dec. 18-24 

 A rainy sunday. Go in the evening to prayer meeting in the University Chapel. Get home Monday and that night get very deaf. Can scarcely hear at all. Have to give up my school. A letter from Lydia. Jimmy [Minor] is at home on a furlough. He will join the Army after Xmas. A long letter from Sally. She and Jabe are still at Cuthburt, Georgia. Jim Buckner turns up this week. He belonged to Sam Eastin's party but was wounded by bushwackers in Western Virginia and had to be left. He got well and succeeded in making his way here. He seems an intelligent boy. He will try to make his way to the Trans-Mississippi Department; commands a Company there.

    
## Dec. 25-31

  Xmas Day. I'm too deaf to go to church. John and Nannie Macmurdo come up Monday. A dull Xmas. Had the Taylor's up one evening and we get up a dance in which Mammy Eliza and Daddy join. My deafness still continues. Feel uneasy about it.

## Jan. 1-7 

  New Year's Day, Sunday. Bright over head. Dull times. Stay at home, teach school, knit and read. Write to Nicky, Sally and Lydia.

    
## Jan. 8-14 

 Keep close at home on account of my deafness. Finish reading *Josephus*.

    
## Jan. 15-21 

 I go to church but am not much edified as I do not heard a word that Mr. Meade says....[Visitors and letters received and written.]

    
## Jan. 22-28 

 Spend Sunday at home. Get the ice house filled. Mr. Coffman with us last night. He is quite agreeable. Another letter from Nicky, also one from Lydia. She tells me Robert [Lewis] and Jimmy Minor are at home for the winter as they promised to winter a horse for the battery ....Eliza is very poorly. John comes up Friday. He does not leave until Feb. lst when Nannie goes home with him to make a little visit.

    
## Feb. 1-7 

 News from Missouri [in] a letter from sister Lizzie [Minor] to Lydia. She says Sam Minor has been back to Missouri. Also says brother Garret is living in Pike [County, Missouri.] The first news I've had of him since the first year of the war. Sister Lizzie is anxious for Lydia to get home with J.B. Henderson, Federal Senator from Missouri. It would be a fine opportunity it she could get to Washington. There is another plan afoot too for her to go with Cousin John Thomas to Kentucky and from there she could easily reach home but her going either way is very doubtful as yet.

    
## Feb. 8-10 

 Had my dog Bruno shot. He had got to be a burden to himself and was very disagreeable about the house so I thought it right to put him out of the way. Feb. 9th Charlotte [Charlotte Nelson Meriwether] was married to Mr. T.J. Randolph, Jr. She had quite a wedding I hear. I had an invite but did not attend as I had no wedding garments.

    
## Feb. 10-20

 I'm on a visit to Music Hall .... Sister Mary is so cheerful.	 Jimmy and Robert both there. I make a short visit to The Creek and spend two days at Uncle Bob's during my stay, both of which visits I enjoy. Nicky was at The Creek sick. I see him for a few moments. From Feb. 9th to Feb. 13th is some of the coldest weather I ever felt. I enjoy sleding on the snow very much, a new amusement to me

 .

   
## Feb. 20-March 2

 Get home and find Ma has had a fall on the ice which confines her to her room. 	Feel troubled about her. Glad I'm at home to attend to her. Thursday February 23rd about 7 o'clock in the morning, Sue's little boy was born. He is to be called Little Sop [after his

 paternal grandfather.] He was born on Sue's 32nd birthday. Feb. 25th Nannie gets home. John is along to see his son.

    
## March 3-5 

 We were passing through a fiery furnace; had the Yankees upon us and oh, the horror of those three days! Had news early Friday that they were approaching but did not realize it until we saw the Depot blazing away. It was burnt by our own people to prevent the Yanks getting the stores. Daddy and Met started off with the horses and some provisions with several of the servants to the mountains but before they could get out of sight the Philistines were upon us. Four Yankee villains came to the house and from the yard and garden took deliberate aim at Daddy and Met before our eyes. Declared that they [Daddy and Met] had shot at them from the hills above the Iron Bridges (where the Yanks were posted.) Our scouts had been in that direction and a few shots had been fired. The wretches said we lied when we told them Daddy had nothing to do with it and declared they would have his head. But he and Met succeeded in getting out of the way with the horses and three of the servants. Those with the carts had to stop and they came back to the house. The four Yanks after walking through the house as if it belonged to them treated us as only cowards would; ate up our dinner and departed. Daddy came back after dark but we begged him not to stay as they said they would kill him, so he went back and got the carts off too. That night the Yanks burnt the factory and set fire to the Iron Bridges. The last were burning for several days. The fire was a grand but awful sight. Saturday, March 4th we did not see much of [the Yankees] until the evening when a large body of them went up the mountain to hunt out the "Johnnie and Black Boys" as they called our people. Our hearts sank when we saw them returning with our horses. Soon received a call from some of them and they said they had Daddy and Met prisoners, describing those persons, clothes and horses so accurately that we thought there could be no doubt of it but we did not know then how perfectly regardless of the truth they are. Said they had the servants too. We were in great distress until about nine o'clock when Lewis [one of the servants] got home and told us they were all safe. About bed time a number of Yanks rode up to the front door and called for Uncle Daniel who had been domiciled in the chamber as our protector. He went out and had quite a long and confidential talk with them. When he came in, told us they wanted him to direct them to Shadwell, Keswick, etc but it afterwards proved that they were making arrangements for taking him off for in the morning he was missing. Four of the other boys went off today. John Trice is also missing. Sunday the 5th. This was a day of terror! The enemy were coming in all day long. Searched Mammy Eliza's room, broke up and carried off the guns and other arms in the house, stole most of Daddy's clothes, went through every drawer in the room, searched the press, broke into the desk, carried off Bonds and other papers of value, were mean enough to open papers of needles and scatter them with spools of cotton about the Yard. Only one set came up stairs but they had their minds so diverted by getting Sue's and Mammy Eliza's watches that they contented themselves with a slight rummage through Ma's drawers, a peep in my book case and some other little boxes, stole the baby's playthings ( a box of Dominos) and so made their exit. Some of them behaved so badly downstairs that I went to the door and called for a gentleman if there was ONE among them. An officer walked up and asked what I wished. I told him how some of the men were acting, asked him to come in and stay and protect us. He and another one came in and said they would stay as long as they could. Others afterwards came in and I made the same appeal to them. We had several sets of protectors and so got off pretty well for the rest of the day. We had some quite animated chats with the Yankee gentlemen? both sides expressing their sentiments very plainly but all in perfect good humor. One asked me if I had seem the Old Flag as it passed early in the morning. I said yes and it would have given me exquisite pleasure to have trampled it in the dust. He seemed to think it was terrible thus to speak of anything so sacred.

    
## March 6-10

  Early this morning, Monday the 6th, we saw their tent struck and the Yanks depart with the most earnest wish that one yet might never more behold them again! How long, oh! Lord! wilt Thou thus afflict our land? He has said, "Fret not thyself because of evil doers, for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and withered like the green herb." We have faith and wait patiently for Him and in the end He will deliver us from our foes. We ought to have thankful hearts when we remember we are all safe and unhurt. Our losses are considerable but we have enough left to support us. Terrible accounts reach us of their treatment to others in the country so we must feel that we have been spared much. Our losses of much value were as follows: five men servants (and we think John Trice too for he has not come home yet,) all the horses that were of any value but the two that Daddy and Met rode, about half of the year's supply of meat, some flour, all the turkeys but five, the two watches, a good deal of corn, most of Daddy's clothes, all his guns, pistols and papers, some other little things. The servants that did not leave were so kind and attentive to us. Don't know how we would have come through our difficulties without them. Believe they saved us much and we have now full proof that they care for us for the Yanks offered them every inducement to go with them but they declined the honor. On Tuesday the 7th Daddy and Met come home. Daddy's sojourn in the mountains tells on him for he looks very badly. They were so closely hunted by the enemy in the mountains, had to take refuge in the Flat Woods. Have made some narrow escapes from the Yanks. Thank God we are all together again and safe. I had forgotten to say we set fire to the Free Bridge the first day the Yanks appeared but it was burnt so badly that the enterprising rogues soon fixed it so they could cross and thus were enabled to do much mischief all the way down the road from the Rives' [Castle Hill the home of William Cabell Rives] to Keswick, even below that place as we hear they treated cousin Peggy Nelson very badly [at Clover Fields.] The morning they left they fired the Bridge well, so we have no means of getting to town but by crossing in a little boat near the ruins of the Iron Bridge. The Yanks have done much damage on the railroad, burning the Depots at Shadwell and Keswick, also some above town, but have not heard how many. We feel uneasy about Met and Daddy being at home as we know nothing certain as to the whereabouts of the raiders so after they get some clean clothes get them to go off again to the Flat Woods. They come back; however, the next day, Wednesday the 8th, and stay as we hear the Yanks are all gone from about us. Thursday the 9th John Mac comes up to see what has become of us all. He had to walk from Cobham [as there was] no train running higher up the road.

    
## March 10-13

  Lizzie Minor ( or rather Lewis) is very sick. John Lewis and Jimmy and Tommy Minor come by on their way to town to get a doctor to go down but they do not succeed in getting him til Sunday morning [the 12th] as the river is so high. Dr. Nelson on his return, spends Sunday night with us and he tells me Lizzie is better. Monday the 13th I get a note from Sarah Leitch telling of the mischief done by the Yankees to some of my friends. Her family, as well as most of the other town people, came off very well, as they had guards but many of those in the country were treated shamefully. Mr. Brown, I hear, has suffered much. The low dogs even broke up the furniture and tableware. Hear my two boys, Davy and John, are supposed to have gone with them. The Orange Dale family were completely broken up. Everything in the way of provisions was carried off, the house searched about twenty times and all their silver taken and they treated in the rudest manner. They are all in town now. Suppose it is a temporary thing [and] that they will go back to Orange Dale when things get quiet. Oh, these are troublous times. We seem to have fallen upon these evils days spoken of in holy writ. How many happy homes have been broken up and how many hearts have been made to ache by the merciless foe!

    
## March 14-18 

  We have no certain news of the enemy. Hear they are going towards Richmond. We have no mails from that place as the Yanks are somewhere on the railroad. We hear our Cavalry are after them. We hear a rumor that we have whipped Sherman south. God grant that it may be true. John starts for Richmond the middle of the week, via Lynchburg. He will have to do some walking on the way as the road has been much injured. Little Eliza very sick after he leaves. Poor little thing, she suffers so much. It would be a mercy for her to be taken. Ma is getting much better. Spring is coming on very fast. The flowers are blooming out and looking so charming and hopeful.

    
## March 19-25 

  A bright beautiful day but no church as we can't get over the river. Fear we will get to be very heathens as I see no prospect for attending church for a while. Eliza continues very ill. Sue and Peggie Taylor both help to nurse her. Monday John Trice comes home. It seems he had no intention of going to the Yanks but high water and sickness kept him away so long. Eliza is better after Monday. Do some gardening during the week. Thursday the 23rd Dave arrives from the South. He is off on sick furlough and has been very ill and still looks badly. Tells us much of the Southern kin, their kindness to him, etc. Saturday the 25th is Ma's 72nd birthday. She is getting slowly over her fall; fear she will never be so active again.

    
## March 26- April 1

  A bright beautiful Sunday. We walk with Dave to see the ruin of the Iron Bridges. What a wreck of nature?

    
## April 2-8 

  Sunday Richmond was evacuated by our Army. The Yankees occupy the city Monday morning at nine o'clock. Our fate is pretty well decided for the war at least as we may now consider ourselves out of our lines. Hope; however, we will not be honored by a visit from the Yanks very soon as we have not much to tempt them in the way of provision, valuables, etc. Tuesday night the 4th about midnight John Mac gets in. He has made the trip from Richmond partly by cars and the rest of the way on foot. Friday the 7th John and Dave start for the Army. John returned the same day as he hears good news, so concluded he need be in no hurry. Suppose we have seen the last of Dave for the war as he will not feel safe to return home now. Sad, sad, times.

    
## April 9-15 

  Dark Days are upon us! Oh for one day of light. Sunday the 9th of April, General Lee surrendered the remains of the Army that left Richmond to General Grant at Appomattox Court House. This is a dark chapter in the history of the Old Mother of States and in the place of our proud motto we may well write *Ichabod* for our glory is gone. Our Hope seems to have bidden us adieu; may it be but for a season. We must learn to bear the yoke with meekness and patience and trust to the Good God to make it all right for us in His own good time. And our brave Old General, how his heart must ache for his country and all his brave men who have been with him through so much suffering. But both General and men must feel that no want of valor on their part has brought about the present state of affairs. Wednesday Dave gets back home as he finds he cannot get to The Army of Tennessee.

    
## April 16-22 

  Easter Sunday. This joyful season is one of gloom and dread to us this year. May our present trials lead us to look now to Him who alone maketh wars to cease. Cadet Hugh Fry with us several days this week. We have some nice walks with him and Dave. Monday the 17th John Mac starts for Richmond. Thursday the 20th Dave says goodbye again, hopes he is now enroute for Missouri. Many rumours of help from the French this week but it all amounts to nothing. Get my flower garden worked up. News comes to us on Thursday the 20th that Abe Lincoln has been assassinated at the Theatre in Washington on the evening of the 14th by [John Wilkes] Booth, the actor. Seward [William H. Seward the Secretary of State] is also badly wounded.

    
## April 23-29 

  No church. Monday Lizzie Dee, Lyd, Jimmy Minor and Nicky Lewis dine with us. Lyd tells me Mr. Coffman is living at Rugby attending lectures at the university and teaching the Rugby children. He is a paroled soldier ....[Visits made.] John Mac was heard from this week. He was three days getting home. All right at Ashland.

    
## April 30-May 6 

  Sundays all spent at home now. Quiet times but we feel restless to hear what is to be our fate. Aunt Sally with us.

    
## May 7-13. 

  The Yankees are about quite often now but they seem to have had their fangs drawn for they disturb no one and appear harmless. Dave sends us a supply of newspapers both Yankee and Richmond Yankee. The whole North seems to be howling over Lincoln's death. The Army of Tennessee under Joe Johnston surrendered to General Sherman on the 26th of April at Raleigh, N.C. Dave has turned up in Albemarle again. He did not get off to Missouri as he hoped [and] is waiting for funds. He has not been home yet. My nose cold is very bad, makes me really sick. Much stir and talk among the "people of color" about their freedom. May it prove as great a blessing to them as they anticipate .... [Had visitors and] Dave at home again.

    
## May 14-20

  John Mac with us for a few days this week. Calls at night on two occasions from our Yankee neighbors which causes a panic terror to the woman kind. We live in a state of constant excitement caused by the insolence and bad behavior of the darkies but poor, ignorant creatures they are hardly to be blamed. Their Kind Friends the Yanks have sadly disappointed them and the much talked of freedom has proved anything but a blessing so far. I'm very poorly with my cold; never had it so badly before.

    
## May 21-27 

  Sunday at home as usual but it is anything but a day of rest. We all feel so uneasy and troubled in mind about the servants. The Yanks meddle so much with them and put such high notions in their heads. They (the servants) have an idea, say the Yanks told them, that we are to be driven off and all we have to be divided among them. Poor things, they'll soon find out that their share of anything the Yanks take from us will be but a small part, the Yanks taking the Wolf's share and the negros must be content with what the little lamb got. John leaves the middle of the week. He expects to return soon. I'm still very poorly with my cold.

    
## May 28-June 3 

  Another Sunday of unrest. Oh, for some of the quiet peaceable days of yore!!! Fear they are never to come to us in our poor down trodden oppressed land. Charlotte and Mr. Randolph call one evening this week. My cold is no better. The news reaches us that [General Edmund] Kirby Smith has surrendered his command [all the Confederal Troops west of the Mississippi] to the federal govenment on the 26th of May. Well our last show for fight in the Southern Confederacy has gone now and we much acknowledge, galling as it is, that we are an over-powered and conquered people. The cherries are ripe and fine. A visit from Mr. Beach, the minister.

    
## June 4-10 

  We are quieting a little; suppose we are getting used to the times. [This is] another proof of the wise Saul that we can get used to anything, even to taking off of our skins .... My cold quite well, it seemed to disappear in a night. My sympathies are all roused for our fallen Chieftain, Jeff Davis. The papers tell us that his captivity is attended with every severity and petty meanness that a Yankee can devise but the fallen hero will, I doubt not, rise above their indignities and show to the world how a true Patriot can suffer for his country. John arrives on Saturday.

    
## June 11-17 

  Dull times ....On Wednesday the 14th, Dave says goodbye for Missouri. Believe he is really off this time. Emily and Tim [who had been slaves of the Anderson's] leave us this week. It makes me sad to see them go. It seems such a breaking up of old ties. I truly hope it will be for their good. Five of the women have left and nearly all the men so our household is much smaller.

    
## June 18-24 

  Sick in bed all day Sunday. So much wet weather all this week which is bad on the harvest now in progress.

    
## June 25-July 1 

  Dull times and warm weather. The Confederate Colonel Lady to dine with us this week. We are all of the opinion that he was nothing more or less than a Yankee. Make a visit to Rugby this week. Mr. Brown came for me in the little carriage on Wednesday and I have such a pleasant visit. They were all so glad to see me. Lydia comes up so we have quite a meeting. She has heard from home and her father has sent funds to carry her back so she is only waiting now for an escort. The dear child seems so happy at the prospect of soon being with her loved ones at home. Make some visits with sister Betty. Find Mr. Coffman, Mr. Shay and Dr. Moses numbered among the Rugby household. Am as much pleased with the last named gentleman as the rest of the family. Wonder how it will all end? [Dr. Moses will marry Louisa's niece, Betty Brown.]

    
## July 2-8

  At church for the first time since the winter. Have no sermon but Mr. Meade gives his reasons for using the prayer for The President of the United States and all in Authority.	Put it on the sense of duty and supports his opinion by Bible authority and the true teachings of Christianity. I think he is all right but there are some among his congregation that do not agree with him.	 Mr. Meade and Miss Ann Leaton [principal of the Piedmont Academy] were married on the 27th of June.	 I get home from Rugby on Monday. Ellie Macmurdo comes up this week.

    
## July 9-15 

  Quiet times at home. Mary Lewis and I walk one day to town to do some shopping. John goes off to Richmond this week. Eliza is very sick. Hear that Sue Bacon has arrived in Virginia [from Brooklyn, New York.] Can imagine the rejoicing over her at The Creek. Do some sewing. Make Ellen's dress and some other jobs. Read *East Lynne*.

    
## July 16-22 

  A letter from sister Betty this week enclosing one from brother Peter written 30th of June. He has gotten back to Missouri; also brother William and both the Sams have come in. Little Sam surrendered with [General Kirby] Smith's army in the South. Sam Eastin was taken at Mobile and paroled. Brother Peter says he finds Missouri much changed during his four years absence .... Eliza is very ill all this week. On Wednesday we thought her dying but she revived a little towards evening. Mr. Meade was sent for and baptized both her and the little boy. John got up Wednesday.

    
## July 23-29 

  Eliza is better. The cars run to town this week for the first time since the raid in March. The bridges have been rebuilt ....A long letter from sister Betty, also from Dr. Moses. They are very anxious for me to come up so Wednesday morning early I start off and walk up ....So much company but I don't enjoy it as they are really all strangers to me. Dr. Moses will leave on Tuesday next. I like him very much. Hope we may meet again. Lydia left Albemarle July 9th and as Dr. McGuffee met with a friend going direct to Missouri who took charge of her suppose she has reached home long ere this. I hear that Miss Vallant has arrived at Uncle Bobs. Oh, how I would enjoy seeing her. Don't know whether I am to have that pleasure. There seems to be so much bitter feeling afloat. I can't see or feel how and when she has done us so much wrong. I get home Saturday morning and find Eliza no better ....

    
## July 30-Aug. 6 

  A dull quiet week. Nothing to note but John's departure on Wednesday for home. He may go as far as New York before he returns. I read *Joseph II and his Court*. It is very entertaining.

    
## Aug. 6-12 

  Quite an unusual proceeding in the family. Mary Lewis and I walk over to church with Met for our escort. I stay the day with Cousin Isabella. We walk home late in the evening and are much surprised to find what a small undertaking it proved. Mr. Meade gave us a sermon ....Get a letter from Rugby telling me of Dr. Moses' departure; also of Lydia's safe arrival in Missouri.

    
## Aug. 13-19 

  Go to church in the waggon and hear Mr. Meade.... See my old acquaintance Carrie Walker. She was in Yankeedom during the troubles. A letter at last from Lydia written a few days after her arrival home-July 28th. Must have been a long time making the trip. Says she had a pleasant trip home. Her brothers and sisters she found so much grown and changed. She would never have known them. Her father and mother both look older. Her Uncle Peter she thinks will be married soon. Lyd thinks Missouri "don't do to live in" after Virginia. Says the people are so Yankeeized there she thinks she will never be satisfied to live among them. A letter was also received in the house from David dated July 27th informing us of his safe arrival in Missouri. Said he was living on the fat of the land and enjoying himself much ....[Letters received and written; visits paid and received.] Sister Betty sends me a long letter which she lately received from brother Peter. It is very satisfactory for he gives an account of himself and his peregrinations during the last four years. He laughs at the report of his taking unto himself another wife but did not positively deny it. Says he must leave Missouri. Thinks something of Danville, Kentucky.

    
## Aug. 20-26 

  At church and hear Mr. Meade...Go after service to Mr. Woods to eat watermellons. Tuesday Mammy Eliza, Met, the children and I take a peach hunt. Have a nice ride but find but few peaches. Wednesday go down to Music Hall with sister Betty and Jimmy Brown. Have a gay time. Sister Betty is in such fine spirits. See Miss Vallant and Sue Bacon. Miss Vallant has improved in appearance and health. Sue is the same cheerful happy body of old. They both seem very glad to see us all again. Miss Vallant tells me of her plans and prospects. She seems to be doing well; has a large and growing school and lives with Mrs. Arrowsmith in Brooklyne. Mr. Bacon has made money during the war. Sue talks of buying a part of The Creek Farm and building on it. Says she can't live among the Yanks any longer. I don't think any of us Rebs can hate the Yankees any harder than she does. We have some pleasant little gatherings at Music Hall, The Creek and Castalia. Robert's friend, Mr. Ford, is stopping at Music Hall and we find him very entertaining. He repeats poetry so beautifully. His brother is also down; he is a pleasant old man. Saturday, sister Betty leaves me .... George Macon calls to pay me some money [this is probably interest from Tom Meriwether's bond] which is very acceptable.

    
## Aug. 27-Sept. 2

  No church. I'm with Miss Vallant then at Music Hall or Castalia until she leaves on Tuesday when Lizzie and I take her to the Depot in the ox cart a la King of Dahominy. Sunday evening Sue Stanford [Bacon] and Nicky [Lewis] join us at sister Mary's and we have a quiet happy time. Mr. Ford makes himself very interesting. We propose that he and Miss Vallant should "join forces" and fix up matters between them. [With their] being compatriots it seems very suitable. Well, I'm glad I've seen the little woman. She is just as dear to me as she ever was. My friend Emily Griswold, I hear from Miss Vallant, has been in New York and is still in America. She expects to return to Africa again this Fall when she intends to take herself a husband who is a missionary, of course. Aunt Sally and I take a jaunt to the Flat Woods to see Alice and Jimmy [Lewis.] They are living in a tiny little house but large enough for the times and their family. There will be quite a Lewis Settlement in The Flat Woods when Sue Bacon and Willie [William Stanford Lewis] both pitch their tents there as they both expect to. Find Mr. Coffman at Music Hall when I get back in the evening. He is making a visitation in the neighborhood before commencing his school at Rugby. Thursday I get home escorted by Mr. Coffman and Jimmy Brown. Find Ma very poorly. She has been quite sick while I've been away. Daddy is off on a trip to the Blue Ridge. John is up. A letter from Dave waiting for me at home containing a very pretty picture of Maggie [Dave's sister, Maggie Anderson.]

  Friday, Ellen and I go shopping, an unusual proceding these hard times. Mary Lewis is staying in town having her teeth fixed. Daddy gets home Friday. The children quite sick ....

    
## Sept. 3-9 

  No church. Quiet dull times. Bully [son of Sue Anderson and John Macmurdo] very poorly. I do some sewing and begin to dry apples for winter. As warm weather as I've ever felt. Met starts to school on Monday to Jeff Taylor at Shadwell. Make my new calico dress and commence Ma's. The baby is better.

    
## Sept. 10-16

  No church. Monday cousins Howel and Sarah and Sue Bacon dine with us ....Sue will wing her way northward soon but she hopes to come back sometime soon and live in Virginia. Wednesday Mammy Eliza, Daddy, John, Ellie and I go to dine at Shadwell by invitation. Find Mrs. Bennet, Helen Carlton and Mary Meriwether there. Have a pleasant day. Charlotte [Randolph] is very sweet and kind in her own house. A letter from Sister Betty enclosing one from brother Peter. Sister Betty says they commenced their school with 23 pupils; could have gotten forty if they had only made arrangements in time. [Mr. Coffman is the teacher.] The lovers have all been heard from lately. Dr. Moses was at the White Mountains. M.H. Frank and his sister expect to be in Albemarle in October. Susie's Folkes [Susie Brown's friend, Mr. Folkes] has just left Rugby. Brother Peter's letter was to Susie. He had just returned from a trip to Kentucky and Tennessee attending to the settlement of Cousin Laurie Vaughan's affairs. Finish Ma's new calico this week. Get on finely with the apple drying. Dave has been heard from. He expects to go into the mercantile business ....I can *see* Dave behind a counter measuring off Calico, tape, etc. How are the mighty fallen!...

    
## Sept. 17-23 

  No church. A little touch of Fall this week; cool enough for fire. Write to Dave. Had a long sweet letter from brother Peter. He tells me dear little Sally is at Holly Springs and very poorly off in the world. Jabe lost everything he had with the Confederacy. Sally is selling her clothes for the necessaries of life. Brother Peter intends helping her. He seems to have determined to stay in Missouri. Will go to his farm and stay. Says he is now much the Ban of the Empire. Cannot practice law but he can't give up Missouri. Will stay, hoping for better times. Will keep Lewis [his son, Nicholas Lewis Minor] at home with him. Has engaged an educated north to instruct him. I read *The Adventures of Philip* by Thackeray and enjoy it ....

    
## Sept. 24-30 

  Such an excitement during the night and early Sunday morning. The stable was broken open early in the night and one of the best horses taken out. John Mac and Daddy start off in the night to try and overtake the rogues. They return about night fall-bring no tidings of the horse. Don't suppose she will ever be heard from again. This is the second fine horse Daddy has had stolen from him since the first of July. Mary Lewis gets home on monday with a fine new set of teeth which are a great improvement to her appearance. Saturday John and Ellie start for Richmond. Poor little Bully, I don't know how he will exist without his "Ministering Angel." We will all miss Ellie for she is a sweet good girl. Very dry weather.

    
## Oct. 1-7 

  Ma, Ellen and I go down in the waggon to Uncle Bob's on Monday to spend a week. Mammy Eliza and Dick are also of the party but they return after dinner. Ma seems to enjoy herself. I make sister Mary several visits; also call on Cousin Peggie Nelson but Uncle Bob's is Head Quarters. We return on Saturday. Quite a motly crowd in the waggon vis the White Folks, Ann, Uncle Hatter, two turkeys, a goose and sundry bags, bottles, jugs, bundles, etc. Find a letter for me at home from Dave. He has decided to make a doctor of himself which profession I imagine will be much more to his taste than that of merchandizing ....

    
## Oct. 8-14 

  A dull Sunday. Monday, I hear my cousins Frank and Lou Ellen Anderson have arrived at Rugby. Sister Betty sends me word to come up. Wish I could go. Make my pickles this week ....Friday John Mac comes.

    
## Oct. 15-21 

  A dull rainy Sunday. Chilling winds tell us that winter is at hand. Monday I go up to Rugby to see Frank and Lou Anderson. Find them away on a visit to cousin Fanny Hart but they return in time for me to see them. They are both as affectionate and sweet as I could wish them. Both  say, "Aunt Lou." While at Rugby sister Betty and I take a tramp to town  visiting. Dine at Cousin George's and call at several places. The young folks at Rugby have a a gay time-company every evening. Susie's old beau Julian Pruitt is married. I feel glad of it on his account. Get home Thursday evening. A letter from Sally. She is living at Holly Springs and though poorly off in the world thinks she will be able to get along. As usual she finds kind friends who help her. Jabe is practicing his profession and hopes to make a living in time. A note from Lizzie Dee. She is a real friend. I feel thankful to her for her interest in me.

    
## Oct. 22-28 

  Do a good deal of sewing this week. Have our neighbors ....to dine with us ....[Letters received and written.]

    
## Oct. 29-Nov. 4 

  Go to church. Mr. Meade being sick we go to the Presbyterian Church but are too late to hear anything but the conclusion of Dr. McGuffie's sermon. See sister Betty and Frank. Have a kiss in the church door. Finish Ma's chemises and do some other work. A letter from brother Peter. He is down on Robert Lewis for some of his impertinent meddling. Get my flowers in winter quarters. Start a hen house again ....

    
## Nov. 5-12 

  On Saturday the 1lth, I had a letter from Ellen Lewis telling me Lizzie Minor Lewis had a daughter born on Thursday, Nov. 2nd. They think of calling her Annie Laurie after sister Mary's dear little lost darling. Lizzie is doing well. A quiet week at home teaching, reading, sewing etc. I'm reading over some of [Sir. Walter] Scott's novels. Write to brother Peter and Lydia.

    
## Nov. 12-18 

  Spend most of Sunday reading *Cardophonia*. Go on Tuesday to Rugby to attend a party which the young folks have on Wednesday night. I enjoy it much, especially the dancing and supper. Make some nice acquaintances ....I get home Thursday feeling tired and stiff which is not surprising when such old people indulge in such gaieties. A letter from Dave. He is working hard; wants to accomplish in 18 months what usually requires three years. While at Rugby see Mr. Shay who has called on his way to New Orleans to say good bye. Believe he was really grieved to take leave of his Virginia friends. [He will return and marry Julia Lewis of The Creek.]....I forgot to mention that while at Rugby I was introduced to Susie's betrothed, Mr. Folkes. He is pleasant looking and is agreeable. I think I shall like him on better acquaintance. Write to Ellen Lewis.

    
## Nov. 19-26 

  Dull quiet contented times. Finish Ma a calico dress and do some knitting for Mr. Brown.

    
## Nov. 26-Dec. 2 

  Go to church and hear Mr. Meade....An old sermon but one I had wished often to hear again. Mary Lewis and I spend a day this week with Charlotte [Randolph,] at least I stay one day, Mary Lewis several. Read *Lyrelea *aloud to Ma. It is fascinating but a very uncomfortable kind of a book. Ma gets so nervous towards the end that she declines listening .... [Letters written.]

    
## Dec. 3-9 

  A Sunday at home ....[Letters written and received including one from] Ellen Lewis. She tells me Lizzie Dee has gone to New York to see Miss Vallant and Mrs. Arrowsmith. I think I should be afraid to venture among the Yanks unless I was certain their claws were cut. Our convocation going on. I attend Wednesday and hear a good sermon from Mr. Latane .... Also attend Saturday and Sunday ....Come home in the snow ....[Letters written.] Mary Lewis staying from home. We have quiet dull times. John Mac leaves for a visit to Ashland Saturday.

    
## Dec. 10-16 

  Hear Mr. Latane....Finish reading *Cardiphonia*. Letters from Lyd and Dr. Moses. Lydia's is quite a family letter as she tells me about each member of her family circle. Dr. Moses was still in Yankee land, but expected to be in Tennessee by the New Year. He expresses many kind wishes for my welfare and hopes we may meet again, in which I heartily join. Sue and I call at neighbor Taylor's. Sue Taylor lends me a supply of books.

    
## Dec. 17-23 

  Do not go to church. Read *The Lives of the Three Mrs. Judsons*. A very readable book. A letter from Dave. He tells me *The Conquered Banner* is by a lady of St. Louis, a Miss Irene Schomberg. John Mac comes home Tuesday. The hardest times I ever saw. Even in the days of the Confederacy money was never as hard to get. No one seems to have any. People really appear to be living without money but it is right hard to do. Hogs killed this week.

    
## Dec. 24-30 

  A very quiet Sunday at home. Monday is Xmas Day but we are dull in the superlative degree. The Freedmen seem to be having all the fun and goodies. We find it very hard to get them to attend to any of our wants. They seem to think we have no right to ask any favors of them for they are as free as we [while] at the same time they are getting their daily allowance from the whitefolks. This is a sad change for us, certainly, but we must be patient and hope for better things. I spend my Xmas writing and reading .... Mary Lewis comes home Thursday. She seems to have had a nice time. Brought us a piece of wedding cake. Our only visitor during the holidays was Met Macmurdo who spends a day and night with us. He has now a place on the Central Railroad ....

    - 	One year ago-what loves, what schemes, 
 - Fan into life!
 - 	What joyous hopes, what high resolves, 
 - What generous strife!
 - 	Lord of the living and the dead! 
 - Our Saviour dear,
 - 	We lay in silence at Thy feet 
 - This sad, sad year.
   Yes, it has indeed been a sad, sad year but may we have faith to believe it will be all right in the end. God is now afflicting us for some wise purpose, I doubt not but if we fear the rod and Him that appointeth it, in His own good time He will deliver us from our oppressors.

## Jan. 1-6 

  Monday Jan. lst. A letter early this week from sister Betty. They had a gay Xmas ....Lily [Brown, Louisa's niece] and Frank have desolved partnership. I'm, really sorry to hear it for I liked the match. John Mac leaves for Richmond on Wednesday. Dull times.

    
## Jan. 7-13 

  Letters from my niece Lizzie and Ellen Lewis. Ellen says they had a gay Xmas though without servants. Uncle Bob was helping to wash and to bring water. Lizzie tells me they had company Xmas night when Miss Annie Laurie [Lewis] made her debut and was introduced to the gentlemen ....I read aloud to Ma Dickens' *Tale of Two Cities* and Cooper's *Lionel Lincoln*. Very cold weather and plenty of ice but we have no hands to get any. It is very tantalizing. Quite an exodus of the Freedmen from the place since the New Year came in. Adeline and her family left the 6th and Nancy and her tribe the 13th. They both go to homes provided by their husbands and I hope will do well. It is very sad to see the servants we have been living with all our lives moving off. It is such a breaking up of old ties and affections for we were attached to them both for past kindnesses to ourselves and to our loved ones now sleeping beneath the sod. It was very hard for the children to give up Nancy for she had been a faithful Black Ma to them all both in sickness and in health but now they are free it is right for them to consult their own interest and it seems proper for them to follow their husbands as they will have to look to them now for support. Anne and her children will leave soon. Mammy and Aunt Peggy are the only remains of the old set left us and I do not suppose they will tarry very long.

    
## Jan. 14-20 

  Go to church and hear Mr. Meade....The Xmas decorations are very pretty. The motto "In Fashion as a man" ....A long letter...from little Sis and a note from Jabe. They are living in Holly Springs and manage to make out on the proceeds of Jabe's profession. He says the Glorious Union is no place for a white gentleman and he intends to be off as soon as he makes enough-proposes Brazil. John Mac turns up again on Tuesday the 16th. Ellie has returned to nurse Bully which causes rejoicing through the whole house. She is such a good "Mammy" to him. The hogs belonging to the female part of the family are killed on Wednesday. It creates quite an excitement in the household from the fact of scraps of green paper being more plentiful in the family then they have been for some time past.

   *Friday the 19th, Troubles of the Darkest Kind* come upon us. What a wicked world this is and what a constant need we have to pray that we may not be led into temptation. Saturday is a day of woe to us all. [It has been learned that Nannie Anderson is pregnant and very near to full term. The father is cousin David Anderson.]

    
## Jan. 21-27 

  Monday the 22nd John Mac and Nannie are off on their long and perilous journey. May that Eye that never sleeps watch over and protect them. A long long weary week. Write to Lizzie Minor and Ellen Lewis. The juveniles all have whooping cough.

    
## Jan. 28-Feb. 3 

  On Tuesday the 30th a telegram from John-"All's Right." On Friday the 2nd letters from John and Nannie. The best news we could hear vis Nannie and Dave were married on Sunday the 28th of January at two o'clock in the day in St. Louis by the Rev. Mr. Morris.

    
## Feb. 14-20 

  On Monday the 5th Rose Sheppherd has nine puppies .... [Letters received and written.]Little Eliza is very sick.

    
## Feb. 11-27 

  Mary Lewis and I go to church and hear an old sermon from Mr. Meade....On Monday the 12th John arrives. We are so glad to see him back and to hear that affairs have turned out so much better than we feared they would. He left Nannie comfortable and in kind hands. Her Aunt Bet says she means to take care of her. Dave is kind and attentive to her. I believe he will try and make amends for the past. Nannie's little babe was born on Friday the 2nd of February. My kindest wish for it is that it may not long sojourn in this world of woe for being the child of sin and shame naught but misery can be before it. She called it John after John Mac. Poor Nannie! She has indeed fallen from her high estate. What poor frail creatures we are, every hour turning aside. Oh, for more faith in the daily prayer that we may not be led to temptation! John Mac had only a peep at the Pike neighborhood and the natives. He got to sister Bets in a "storm party" and was introduced to a number of the clan. Brother Peter among them. He saw Sam Eastin and his new wife, [and] Sam and Lizzie Minor. John thinks Missouri a great country .... Daddy gets me such a nice shawl in the place of mine that Nannie carried with her. It is a perfect beauty. A letter this week from Lyd. She tells me some bad news. Brother Garret's oldest daughter [Bettie Minor] was burnt so badly that she died immediately. It happened on the 3rd of Feb. The child was in her sixteenth year. Brother Garret was also badly burnt trying to help her. Poor little Eliza very sick all the week. Friday night the 16th at about nine o'clock her sufferings ended for God called her home. Dear little babe, it ought to be a matter of rejoicing to us all for you to be called away from your sufferings for your whole life has been one of misery. It is hard for Sue and John to give her up but they both say they cannot wish her back afflicted as she was. She was two years, six months and one day old and in all that time I don't suppose she even enjoyed a whole day of perfect ease. This world was in reality a vale of tears to her but she is at rest now.

  "Another little form's asleep 

 And a little spirit gone 

 Another little voice is hushed 

 And a little angel born 

 Two little feet are on the way 

 To the home beyond the skies 

 And our hearts are like the void that comes 

 When a strain of music dies."

    
## Feb. 18-24 

  Raining hard all day Sunday. Little Eliza was buried on Monday. No one here but Mr. Meade and a few other gentlemen. Write to brother Peter on business this week.

  "Disasters come not singly but as if they watched and waited, scanning one another's notions; when the first descends the others follow, follow, gathering, flocking round their victim sick and wounded. First a shadow then a sorrow till the air is dark with anguish."

  Such seems to be true of our household. On Friday night at about ten o'clock, the 23rd of Feb., my dear Mammy Eliza was taken from us. Her death was very sudden. I had spent the evening with her and Daddy in the dining room and thought she had been unusually cheerful. I left her about nine o'clock and after getting to bed an hour later heard such a stir in the house that I got up and went down to the chamber and found her a disfigured corpse. Daddy and Mary Lewis were standing by her, begging her to speak but it was all over. The spirit had returned to God who gave it. The voice was hushed and the life gone. Daddy said she had gone to bed quite well but soon jumped up and complained of a feeling of suffocation; had gone to the out door to get some fresh air but in a few moments sat down and said she believed she was dying and never spoke again. When Mary Lewis got to her she was dead. We rubbed her with different things, put her feet in hot water and Daddy bled her but could only get a few drops of blood. Dr. Nelson came in about two hours but he said we could have done nothing for her for she had heart disease and he knew she would die suddenly though he did not think it would be so soon. Well, I believe she was ready to go and it is all well with her now but it would have been consoling to those she left behind to know her last wishes but God knows best and we must all feel that our loss is her gain for her troubles were many and very grievous to be bourn and yet how meek and uncomplaining she was under them all. She is now at rest with those who have gone before in that house of many mansions and may this sudden warning not fall on us unheeded [but] reminding us to be also ready, "For what hour ye know not the Son of Man cometh." Poor Daddy seems crushed and I can't wonder at it for a more devoted wife a man never had. May this heavy blow prove a message from God to him causing him to consider his ways and to turn unto the Lord God with all his heart. This is a mysterious Providence. The Stay and Prop of a whole family taken and so many entirely dependent on her left but God's ways are not our ways and we must believe it was all done in kindness. Poor Nannie. How bitter must be her grief. May God help her. Ours is a sorrowing household now. A desolate hearthstone. The children all feel their loss much but it is heavier on little Dick and Ellen, they being the youngest of the flock. Ma stands it bravely but she feels that her earthly sojourn cannot be much longer when she will join the Loved and Lost. Mammy Eliza was in her 51st year being 50 years old the 23rd of last August. Our neighbors are very kind; stay with us and do all in their power to help us. Cousin Isabella, Cousin Ann Watson and Sarah get to us early Saturday and are such comforts to us all. John Mac also gets home Saturday morning. He knew nothing of the trouble that had befallen us until he got to the house.

    
## Feb. 25-March 3.

  On Sunday we buried our dead out of our sight. Quite a number of friends were present and among the number cousin Lou Leitch. She remained with us until Friday and was such a help and comfort to us all. Mary Lewis will take the management of affairs. I will act as one of her subs. I had a letter from brother Peter last week. He is living in Fulton, Missouri and practicing law. He sent me a picture of himself and Lewis ....I do some trimming in the garden.

    
## March 4-10 

  Sunday, such a lonely day. The vacant place in our home circle is felt more and seen plainer today then ever. Mammy and Ann [former slave women] have concluded to remain with us. They will change their place of abode as it will be necessary for them to be near the house. On Monday wrote to brother Peter and sister Mary. Busy trimming in the garden ....[Visitors call and letters are received.] I write a long [letter] to Nannie; also a note to sister Betty. Nannie is pleased with the Missouri clan. They are very kind and attentive to her. Tom Davis [a cousin] has been to see her and is very friendly in his offers of assistance. Poor Nannie, she has heard nothing of the late sad event in her home.

    
## March 11-17 

  Ellen and I go to church and hear Mr. Meade.... Busy in the garden. Saturday morning go up to Rugby and spend a day and night .... Sister Betty has much to tell me of family matters. The part relating to Frank is a sad affair. I'm disappointed in him. Lily made a fortunate escape though I was vexed with her at first for turning him off. My faith in mankind is shaken generally for so many have proved that they were not to be trusted that I once thought "all right."

    
## March 18-24 

  At church and hear Mr. Meade....I'm so busy in the garden. Tommy and Dick Minor come for the puppy. I've sent off all now. [Visitors call, letters are received and written including one] from brother Peter. It is so kind and affectionate. Says he will send me some help soon; seems gratified that I asked it of him. Letter received from Nannie this week. She has not heard the bad news from home yet. Poor child, she says the Missouri friends are so kind to her.

    
## March 25-31 

  Spend Sunday at home ....Am reading *Kitty Trevylyan's Diary* to Ma. It is very interesting. A letter to Daddy from Nannie. She has heard of her mother's death ....On Wednesday John, Mary Lewis, Ellen and I walk to town. We females attend church and have such a good sermon from Mr. William Nelson ....Go again on Friday and hear Mr. Butler....Get my flower garden worked up this week and it looks so nice ....Sunday, Ma's 73rd birthday.

    
## April 1-7 

  We walk to church and hear Mr. Meade.... A good sermon but one I've heard on a former Easter Sunday ....John Mac leaves for Richmond on Easter Monday.

    
## April 8-14

  A rainy Sunday but the rain is much needed for it is very dry. A call from cousins Howel and Sarah and Nannie Lewis. Some other company this week. Mary Lewis and I take a jaunt to town on Friday. We find it rather a hard matter making the trip as the horse works so badly ....

    
## April 15-21. 

  At church and hear Mr. Meade....Write to Nannie. A letter from brother Peter this week in which he is confidential. Says he will soon send me some aid in the form of money. I answer it the next day after receiving it. Ma, Ellen and I dine with Mrs. McGhee. We all enjoy the visit. Charlotte [Randolph,] cousin Peggie [Nelson] and the children are with us to dinner on Saturday. Cousin Peggie gives me the news of the lower neighborhood. Ellen Lewis and Lunt Smith [Andrew Jackson Smith] are to be married soon. I always thought it would be a be. Affairs at Music Hall, I fear, are in a sad condition. Just what I expected. Poor Sister Mary. What a change for her. Nurse Ellie leaves this week. Poor little Bully. He don't fancy the new mammy ....It is really sad to see him . ....I have a flock of 19 chickens.

    
## April 22-28

  No church. Daddy very sick this week. Dr. Nelson to see him. Ellen starts to school this week to Jeff Taylor [at Lego Plantation.] She seems much pleased to go; hope it may improve her both in mind and manners. Dick is my only pupil now. He is a bright chap and I enjoy teaching him. Commenced reading history this week and is nearly perfect in his Catechism. Lizzie Dee and Jinnie Sinclair to dine with us. Lizzie Dee has just returned from New York. Her health is better and she seems to have had a nice visit and seen wonders but I don't perceive she brings back any increase of brotherly love for the hateful Yankees. She met with some big hearted southern people who could sympathize with her. Miss Vallant is in poor health and unable to attend to her school most of the time. Cousin Isabella with us Friday and Saturday. She is a ministering spirit always coming whenever help is needed. Daddy is suffering much Friday and Saturday. News from Missouri. Brother Peter and Pinkie Rootes [Lizzie Rootes] are engaged to be married. He wrote and told sister Betty of it and asked her to send me the letter which she did. He says it will take place sometime during the summer or fall. Well, I like the match though I had hoped to see him before he took unto himself another wife ....A long letter from little Sis and Jabe. They are getting along. No one can expect to do more now. Jabe is as hard as ever upon the Yanks. He thinks they have given the Country entirely over to "The Gentleman who has charge of the fire works." Indeed  it looks as if such a personage might be at the head of affairs now. The chicken excitement is at its height. Sue, Ma and I are the interested parties and Mary Lewis says we do not talk of anything else. Ma begins to send the asparagus to market. Mary Lewis is sending milk every morning.

    
## April 29-May 5 

  I'm in bed all day Sunday ....Reading history and knitting. Aunt Peggy [a freedwoman] is installed as Mammy for Bully. They seem to be on very amicable terms. Letters from brother Peter and Lydia. They both are contemplating matrimony. Lyd thinks her intended perfect. She does not give his name.

    
## May 6-12

  No church. Wrote to Lydia and sister Betty; also to Mr. Brown on business. Sue and I spend Monday morning with Charlotte [Randolph.] Walk with Met and Ellen to school and back. Have a pleasant time. Discourse much on the subject of raising fowls. Charlotte is as much interested as we are. A letter from Nannie. She writes cheerfully. My nose cold beginning. Get some money from T.J. Randolph for interest in part of Dr. Meriwether's bond this week so Saturday Mary Lewis and I go to town shopping. I pay all my debts and buy a few necessaries ....Saturday May 12th [is] Dick's 9th birthday.

    
## May 13-19 

  Go to church and hear Mr. Meade....Go after church with sister Betty home where I remain until Monday morning ....Attend service in the University Chapel at night and hear a good sermon from Mr. Lindsey....Mr. Coffman tells me he expects to live next year at Mr. Keating Nelson's and teach school. Get home Monday evening. Am very poorly this week with my Spring cold. It keeps me in bed for several days. Read Dicken's last *Our Mutual Friend*. John makes a visit of three days this week. He is busy at work engineering in Princess Anne County. Is really raking among the oyster beds. Says there is not much down there but sand and fish. Begin teaching Ann's little Sue. [Sue is the daughter of the feedwoman, Ann.]

    
## May 20-26

  Whit Sunday. Hear Mr. Meade....Write to Nannie, brother Peter and Aunt Sally. Mary Lewis and I are among the bidden guests to Ellie Lewis' wedding on Wednesday May 23rd. The invite did not come to hand until the very day. We could not have gone; however, being in the lamentable condition of Miss Flora MacFlimsey having nothing to wear ....

    
## May 27-June 2 

  No church. Monday write to little Sis and Jabe. A visit from Uncle Bob. He brings Ma a present of some money from Aunt Alice and Aunt Jane[ who live in Missouri.] Uncle Bob tells me Ellen left for her new home in Fauquier County the Friday after her marriage. Friday Ma and I start out visiting. We dine with Cousin Isabella and go in the morning to Orange Dale. While in town, Ma has her picture taken and Cousin Isabella and I do some shopping for her. We have a nice time at Orange Dale. They are all so glad to see Ma.	Come home Saturday evening in such a hard rain. I met with a great loss while I'm away. Nearly all of my fine chickens at one full swoop are carried off by those blood thirsty monsters, the rats. They played sad havoc with the chickens that night. Sue lost nearly all of hers. I'm really disturbed about mine for they were out of danger and were so handsome.

    
## June 3-9 

  No church. Mary Lewis kept in town by high water. She gets home on Wednesday. Daddy makes a visit to The Creek. He finds Sue Stanford [Bacon] there. We have some company to dine this week ....Ma gets such a nice present from Miss Vallant by Sue Bacon-two beautiful calico dresses, handkerchiefs, caps, etc. The old lady is in luck of late ....Write to Miss Vallant on Sunday.

    
## June 10-16. 

  No church. Mary Lewis and I go to town shopping. Buy me a new black dress for which I paid $12. Coming home we get fastened in the ford by a rock. Have to stay in the river some fifteen or twenty minutes. It seemed a perfect age to us for it was anything but pleasant to be in the middle of the river and unable to move and night at hand. George [Cousin George Meriwether from Missouri who is visiting] succeeds at last in extricating us. I write to Aunt Alice, a letter of thanks for her and Aunt Jane's nice present to Ma ....

    
## June 17-23 

  A letter from Nannie this week ....Read, sew and teach school. John Mac gets home Saturday night. A letter on Saturday from brother Peter. He tells me he and Pinkie are to be married on the 26th of this month.

    
## June 24-30 

  No church. Such warm weather. Go Wednesday evening to church and hear Bishop [John] Johns .... Some 40 persons were confirmed by him. Thursday Ma spent with Charlotte [Randolph.] She is getting to be quite a gad. We hear Uncle Robert is very poorly so on Saturday Ma and I go down to Castalia and find Uncle Robert in bed. Have a warm welcome from all. Go in the evening to see sister Mary and Lizzie. Am introduced to my great niece, little Annie. She is not pretty but very bright.

    
## July 1-7

  At the brick church and hear Dr. Jones....Such a beautiful sermon. It did me good. Dr. Jones and his two sons are friends of Robert's and are putting up at Music Hall. They are nice people. The Dr. is an elegant gentleman as well as a scholar. He is a native of South Carolina though he lives in New Jersey; is a true Southerner in feelings. I was much pleased with both Father and sons. I divide my time between Castalia and Music Hall. Ma and I spend a night with Alice [Lewis] and a day at The Creek. Lizzie Dee is at home and gives me the benefit of a very interesting correspondence she has lately had with a genuine Yankee. It is very amusing. She gives him fits. See Sue Stanford. She is so cheerful and pleasant. She spends a day and night with me at Music Hall. On Saturday Ma goes home. I expected to go too but sister Mary and Aunt Sally say they have not (seen) anything of me so I conclude to stay a week longer. Jimmy Minor takes Ma home. She seems improved by her visit. Only wish she would be satisfied to stay longer.

    
## July 8-14. 

  Go on Sunday to Grace Church and hear Mr. Boyden. Uncle Bob starts on Monday for the Springs. He could get about a little before he left. Jimmy Lewis went with him. A Convocation at Grace Church this week. There were two sermons each day but I was never in time to hear but one ....They were all fine sermons and I would have enjoyed them more but for the weather which was the warmest I ever felt and we had to walk to church each day. On one occasion I really feared that I had had a sun stroke but I got over it. Sister Betty, Betty 0 [Betty 0. Brown, Louisa's niece] and some of the young ones are down at Music Hall this week. I enjoy seeing them though the house is most too full for comfort. Dr. Jones and his rebel son still remain. The other son left last week. Lizzie Lewis and I spend a night at The Creek. Have a gay evening. there are so many real young people there. Am introduced to Florence Benton. We take a kiss and agree that we are not unknown to each other having so many mutual friends. She tells me that I remind her of Kate, which of course please me. Cousin Sarah is rusticating on William's Hill, [at her son William Stanford Lewis' home in the Flat Woods] so the young people have entire possession of the house. Sue Stanford keeps them in order. Nicky is at home and in bad health. Read two new novels which are lent me by Mr. Chester Jones (the rebel), *Hand and Glove* and *Sans Merci*. A letter from Sue. All well at home. Ma has improved in health since her trip. How I miss dear Mammy Eliza's long newsy epistles that I always had from her during any stay from home. It was always such a pleasure to receive them.

    
## July 15-21 

  Convocation ends today. Mr. Meade preached an old sermon ....''It is time to seek the Lord." Such a warm day and we foot it to church. In the evening sister Betty returns from Aunt Sally's where she and the children have been staying for a day and night. We have a pleasant quiet evening. Dr. Jones is so agreeable and has so little bigotry for a Presbyterian. He talks so beautifully of our trials and troubles in this life; why they are sent and how they should be borne by us so that in the end they prove themselves blessing in disguise. I feel it a great privilege to be in the company of such a godly man. Monday Dr. Jones and Son and the rest of the Music Hall family are invited to Castalia to breakfast. We have a most sumptuous repast. About 10 o'clock say good bye to my friends all and start for home. Sister Betty and Co. are with me as far as town. Find Mary Lewis at Dr. Nelson's waiting for me. We do not go home until later in the evening on account of the heat. All well at home. I'm right glad to be back though I had a very pleasant trip and those whom I care for seemed really glad to see me once again. I've promised Aunt Sally and sister Mary to try and visit them again in the fall. Music Hall is a sadly changed place to me but sister Mary and her children are still and ever will be very dear to me and I shall always try to see something of them even though I feel that I'm not a welcome guest to all in the family. From sister Mary and my brother's children I'm always sure of a welcome. Find a letter waiting me at home from Lydia; also one from my dear old friend, Miss Vallant. She is in very bad health. Fear much she will never be well again. She writes very affectionately and says we have her heartfelt sympathy in all our troubles. She sends me a picture of Mrs. Arrowsmith and herself which I shall prize much. A call this week from Mr. Bennet Taylor and his bride [Lucy Colston.] The warmest weather I ever felt. Some nice rains the last of the week which makes the crops grow. Write to brother Peter and Nannie. Ma very poorly.

    
## July 22-28 

  A Sunday at home. Ma very sick all day. The doctor to see her. By Monday she is relieved but in a weak condition. A note from Susie Brown telling me Mr. Folkes will be at Rugby this week and wants me to be with them. Ma is too poorly for me to leave her .... [Visitors call.] Ma able to get about the house by the middle of the week. Read Hawthorne's *Scarlet Letter*, a strange story. Saturday Sue and I go over to see Mat Woods and her new baby. It is a girl and was born on Monday the 23rd. Mat is very smart.

    
## July 29-Aug. 4 

  No church. Ma much better. Mary Lewis had a letter from Nannie. She has been very sick with fever but is about again. She says brother Peter and his bride are in her neighborhood so he is really married. Tuesday evening Ellen returned from her visit in town bringing Carrie Minor, Hattie and Nannie Meade with her. They seem to enjoy their visit. I had a letter from Sally, also one from Lizzie Dee. She tells me Uncle Bob has returned home much improved in health. Dr. Jones and Son tarried some days after I left. Sister Mary, Lizzie and some of the children are in the Green Springs neighborhood [with sister Mary's twin sister, Lizzie Watson.]....Friday take breakfast with cousin Lou, also dinner. Have such a pleasant day. Almost like old times ....After tea at cousin George's [George Macon] I walk up to Rugby with Susie and Jimmy. Sister Betty and all are glad to see me. Mr. Brown is away at his mother's. Mr. Folkes is stopping at Rugby for a few days. I like him so much. Enjoy seeing he and Susie together ....

  At church and hear Mr. Meade....Get home Monday evening. Find Kate Powell staying with Ellen. She is a nice ladylike little girl. Ma is very poorly again this week. She has the doctor to see her once. John Mac is up again. Thursday John, Sue, Mary Lewis, Bully and Ann go down to The Creek to dine. They conclude to remain all night. The next day John, Mary Lewis and Ann return and left Sue and Bully. John and the nurse Ellie join her Saturday. Sue and Bully will make a little stay in that neighborhood. John was enroute for Richmond. A letter from brother Peter. He and Pinkie are really married. Have been on a bridal tour to the Prairieville [Pike County, Missouri,] neighborhood. Kate Powell was with us Saturday when her mother sent for her as her little baby brother has died. Such dry weather. Call on Monday to see my old friend Kate Whitehead. She has just come up form Suffolk. [She] is looking thin and badly. Says her health is indifferent. The Yankees have behaved shamefully towards her. It is shocking to hear of the indignities she has been obliged to submit to. Also saw Cousin Mary Lewis. She has been a fellow sufferer with Kate from Yankee insults, roguery, etc. How long, oh , Lord, how long wilt Thou thus allow our enemy to trample us in the dust.? Of thy mercy hasten the time of their punishment.

    
## Aug. 12-18 

  No church. Ma sick again....[Letters written.] Make a new screen last week for our room which as a Work of Art is much admired. Put on some horses for Bully's benefit ....

We make arrangements for a correspondence this winter ....

    
## Aug. 26-Sept. 1 

  Am kept from church by a sore eye ....Read *Prison Life of Jefferson Davis* by Dr. Craven. It works me up to the highest pitch of indignation against the cowardly mean Yankee nation. Their treatment of this Hero will be a lasting stain of Yankee History. Monday we have the Miss Macons to call and Ellen Smith and Willie Minor to dinner. Ellie seems very happy and is looking really pretty .... Company to dinner on Saturday ....Mammy [the freedwoman has apparently been visiting her daughter Emily] returned from Ashland Wednesday.

  No church. A quiet day. Write to Nannie this week. The children, Met and Ellen start to school on Tuesday to Mr. Jeff Taylor. John Mac taking for a model wise old King Soloman has intruded into the lumber business. Sue thinks he may go into winter quarters either in the Flat woods or perhaps in the Royal State of Fluvanna in which case she may join him for a time at least. Kemp [a dog] disappears very mysteriously. He has not been seen since last Saturday, Sept. lst. We feel troubled about him for thought too old to be of any use yet as a part of the establishment we miss him. He has no doubt gone off and died for he had long been ailing.

## Sept. 23-29

They were all of the Black Republican stamp so we committed all but four to a watery grave. The four saved were for friends. Company this week .... John Mac goes to Richmond on Saturday. There is a probability of his getting some work there.

## Oct. 7-13 

  At church and hear Mr. Meade....We are all in the depths of woe when Sue, Bully and John leave us Sunday evening. They spend the night with Cousin Isabella [and] go off on the early train. I'm truly glad that John has got work but it is a hard trial giving up Sue and Bully. Dear little fellow, he is indeed a gleam of sunshine in our broken house. Ah, well, we must believe it is all for the best. She has been with us now over three years. Cousin Howel and Sarah and Alice with us Tuesday. I enjoy cousin Sarah. Made my Mexican pickles this week. So much rainy cloudy weather ....

## Nov. 4-10 

  No church. Mary Lewis, Ann and I make a visit to town Tuesday and do some shopping. Wednesday Ma and I start in the carriage for the lower neighborhood. We dine at Cousin Fannie Meriwether's and are introduced to Mrs. Geiger and Mr. Gamble. Have a pleasant day. Get to Aunt Sally's about night. She gives us a hearty greeting and a good supper. Uncle Bob is in town. It seems strange with such a small family at Castalia. All the children away but the four youngest. Lilla Boyden [the daughter of Ebeneezer Boyden, the rector of Grace Church] teaches Mag and Lydia. She is very pleasant. I spend a day with sister Mary and enjoy seeing them all at Music Hall. Little Annie has grown much and is getting to be quite accomplished, talking, walking, etc. Uncle Bob gets home Thursday. He is much improved in health. Alice [Lewis] is up Friday night with Warner, [her son, James Warner Lewis.] We get home Saturday to dinner. It was a short but pleasant visit ....

## Nov. 25-Dec. 1 

  The Bridge is ready for use now. We all feel very thankful that we are no longer at the mercy of the river for whenever we had a hard rain we were unable to ford the river and very often the ferry was not manageable at high water and it was truly a serious matter to be so entirely cut off at times from town. Begin my rag carpet. Wonder if it will ever turn out anything. I shall try to make it. Spend Monday at Shadwell. Charlotte has such a sweet pretty little baby. It is my first visit there since cousin Peggie [Nelson, Charlotte's mother] has been one of the family ....

    
## Dec. 2-8 

  Write to Nannie this week. I'm suffering much with a boil on my arm. A letter from sister Betty. Quite a family bulletin as there was news from all. Ellen and I go to town Saturday. Find the little city all excitement about the two fairs vis The Memorial and Mrs. Rives. They are to come off next week. I don't expect to attend either as I'm low in finances just now. Cross the bridge for the first time.

    
## Dec. 9-15 

  Dull times. Mary Lewis and the children attend the fair on Wednesday night. I stay home with Ma. She brings us some cake and oysters. Mr. John Carter of Missouri spends a night with us this week. He brings but discouraging news of Nannie. Poor child, I fear sorrow is to be her lot now. Mr. Carter gives me a good many points about the Missouri clan. Sell my hog this day but only get $11.30 for it which amount was far below my expectations. Go to town Saturday and spend most of the money.

  A Sunday at home. Letters on Monday from Sally and Jabe. They are uneasy at my long silence ....Write Sally a long letter on Xmas Eve. Go to church on Xmas Day and hear Mr. Page ....The church is very prettily decorated for the season. The singing was cheering. After church I go up to Rugby and stay until Thursday morning. Have a pleasant time. Wednesday is Susie's 21st birthday so we have a dinner party in honor of it. Only some young men invited. Plenty of good cheer and a dinner in the evening. Thursday I take dinner with cousin Isabella and see cousin James Watson. He was released by order of the President. [James Watson was a postmaster under the Confederacy.] He and his wife and daughters are now enroute for home. Ma and the children dined with them at Orange Dale on Xmas Day. I get home Thursday evening and am suffering with toothache. Mary Lewis in town for a day and night. Such----

  [Here the diary ends abruptly. There appears to have been a last page which is now missing. The last word, "such" probably introduced the phrase "Such quiet times or such dull times."  Missing from the year 1866 is Louisa's usual New Years Eve appraisal of the prior twelve months. Surely she looked back at the three big tragedies, Nannie and Dave's "child of sin and shame,"  little Eliza's death and Mammy Eliza's death and concluded that the rod was still upon them. She may also have though of the freedmen and freedwomen who had left Pantops for their independent lives. Louisa may also have wondered what the year ahead would hold for her and the reduced household. Times had changed, responsibilities had passed to new hands, the family must now pick up work done in former times by the servants. With all the changes, two things remained. The inportance of family had not diminished and the religious faith relied upon for courage was more necessary then ever.]
