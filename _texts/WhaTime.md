##                                  I 

   MRS. LIDCOTE, as the huge, menacing mass of New York defined itself  far off across the waters, shrank back into her corner of the  deserted deck and sat listening with a kind of unreasoning terror  to the steady onward drive of the screws.  

She had set out on the voyage quietly enough,—in what she  called her "reasonable" mood,—but the week at sea had given her  too much time to think of things, had left her too long alone with  the past.  

When she was alone, it was always the past that occupied her.   She couldn't get away from it, and she didn't any longer care to.   During her long years of exile she had made her terms with it, had  learned to accept the fact that it would always be there, huge,  obstructing, encumbering, much bigger and more dominant than  anything the future could possibly conjure up.  And, at any rate,  she was sure of it, she understood it, knew how to reckon with it;  she had learned to screen and manage and protect it as one does an  afflicted member of one's family.  

There had never been any danger of her being allowed to forget  the past.  It looked out at her from the face of every  acquaintance, it appeared suddenly in the eyes of strangers when a  word enlightened them: "Yes, *the* Mrs. Lidcote, don't you know?"   It had sprung at her the first day out, when, across the dining-room, from the captain's table, she had seen Mrs. Lorin Boulger's  revolving eye-glass suddenly pause and the eye behind it grow as  blank as a dropped blind.  The next day, of course, the captain had  asked, "You know your ambassadress, Mrs. Boulger?" and she had  replied that, No, she seldom left Florence, and hadn't been to Rome  for more than a day since the Boulgers had been sent to Italy.  She  was so used to these set phrases that it cost her no effort to  repeat them.  And the captain had promptly changed the subject.  

No, she didn't, as a rule, mind the *past*, because she was  used to it and understood it.  It was a great concrete fact in her  path that she had to walk around every time she moved in any  direction.  But now, in the light of the dreadful event that had  summoned her from Italy,—the sudden, unanticipated news of her  daughter's divorce from Horace Pursh and immediate remarriage with  Wilbour Barkley,—the past, her own poor, miserable past, started  up at her with eyes of accusation, became, to her disordered fancy,  like the "afflicted" relative suddenly breaking away from nurses  and keepers and publicly parading the horror and misery one had,  all the long years, so patiently screened and secluded.  

Yes, there it had stood before her through the long, agitated  weeks since the news had come,—during her interminable journey  from India, where Leila's letter had overtaken her, and the  feverish halt in her apartment in Florence, where she had had to  stop and gather up her possessions for a fresh start,—there it had  stood grinning at her with a new balefulness which seemed to say,  "Oh, but you've got to look at me *now*, because I'm not only  your own past, but Leila's present."  

Certainly it was a master-stroke of those arch-ironists of the  shears and spindle to duplicate her own story in her daughter's.   Mrs. Lidcote had always   fancied somewhat grimly that,  having so signally failed to be of use to Leila in other ways, she  would at least serve her as a warning.  She had even at times  consciously abstained from defending herself, from making the best  of her case, had stoically refused to plead extenuating  circumstances, lest Leila's impulsive sympathy should lead to  deductions that might react disastrously on her own life.  And now  that very thing had happened, and Mrs. Lidcote could hear the whole  of New York saying with one voice: "Yes, Leila's done just what her  mother did.  With such an example, what else could you expect?"  

Yet if she had been an example, poor woman, she had been an  awful one; she had been, one would have supposed, of more use as a  deterrent than a hundred blameless mothers as incentives.  For how  could any one who had seen anything of her life in the last  eighteen years have the courage to repeat so disastrous an  experiment?  

Well, logic in such cases didn't count, example didn't count,  nothing, she supposed, counted but having the same impulses in the  blood; and that presumably was the dark inheritance she had  bestowed upon her daughter.  Leila hadn't consciously copied her;  she had simply "taken after" her, had been, so to speak, a  projection of her own long-past rebellion.  

Mrs. Lidcote had deplored, when she started, that the *  Utopia* was a slow steamer, and would take eight full days to bring  her to her unhappy daughter; but now, as the moment of reunion  approached, she would willingly have turned the boat about and fled  back to the high seas.  It was not only because she felt still so  unprepared to face what New York had in store for her, but because  she needed more time to dispose of what the *Utopia* had already  given her.  The past was bad enough, but the present and future  were worse, because they were less comprehensible, and because, as  she grew older, surprises and inconsequences troubled her more than  the worst certainties.  

There was Mrs. Boulger, for instance.  In the light, or rather  the darkness, of new developments, it might really be that Mrs.  Boulger had not meant to cut her, but had simply failed to  recognize her.  Mrs. Lidcote had arrived at this extraordinary  hypothesis simply by listening to the conversation of the persons  sitting next to her on deck—two lively young women with the latest  Paris hats on their heads and the latest New York ideas beneath  them.  These ladies, as to whom it would have been impossible for  a person with Mrs. Lidcote's primitive categories to determine  whether they were married or unmarried, "nice" or "horrid," or any  one or other of the definite things which young women, in her youth  and her society, were of necessity constrained to be, had revealed  a familiarity with the world of New York that, again according to  Mrs. Lidcote's traditions, should have implied a recognized place  in it.  But in the present fluid state of manners what did anything  imply except what their hats implied—that one couldn't tell what  was coming next?  

They seemed, at any rate, to frequent a group of idle and  opulent people who executed the same gestures and revolved on the  same pivots as Mrs. Lidcote's daughter and her friends: their  Coras, Matties, and Mabels seemed at any moment likely to reveal  familiar patronymics, and once one of the speakers, summing up a  discussion of which their neighbor had missed the beginning, had  affirmed with headlong assurance: "Leila?  Oh, * Leila's* all  right."  

Could it be *her* Leila, the mother had wondered, with a  sharp thrill of curiosity and apprehension?  If only they would  mention surnames!  But their talk leaped elliptically from allusion  to allusion, their unfinished sentences dangled over abysses of  conjecture, and it was one of the marks of their state that they  gave their bewildered hearer the impression not so much of talking  only of their intimates, but of being intimate with every one  alive.  

Her old friend Franklin Ide could have told her, perhaps; but  here was the last day of the voyage, and she hadn't yet found  courage to ask him.  Great as had been the joy of discovering his  name on the passenger-list, and seeing his friendly, hirsute  countenance among the throng against the taffrail at Cherbourg, she  had as yet said nothing to him except, when they had met, "Of  course I'm going out to Leila."  

She had said nothing to Franklin Ide because she had always  instinctively shrunk from taking him into her confidence.  She was  sure he felt sorry for her, sorrier per- haps than any one  had ever felt; but he had always paid her the supreme tribute of  not showing it.  His attitude allowed her to imagine that  compassion was not the basis of his feeling for her, and it was  part of her joy in his friendship that it was the one relation  seemingly unconditioned by her state, the one in which she could  think and feel and behave like any other woman.  

Now, however, as the cloudy problem of New York loomed nearer,  she began to regret that she had not spoken, had not at least  questioned him about the hints she had gathered on the way.  He did  not know the two ladies next to her, he did not even, as it  happened, know Mrs. Lorin Boulger; but he knew New York, and New  York was the sphinx whose riddle she must read or perish.  

Almost as the thought passed through her mind his stooping  shoulders and grizzled head detached themselves against the dazzle  of light in the west, and he sauntered down the empty deck and  dropped into the chair at her side.  

"You're expecting the Barkleys to meet you, I suppose?" he  asked composedly.  

It was the first time she had heard any one pronounce her  daughter's new name, and it immediately occurred to her that her  friend, who was shy and inarticulate, had been trying to say it all  the way over and had at last shot it out at her only because he  felt it must be now or never.  

"I don't know.  I cabled, of course.  But I believe she's at—  they're at—*his* place somewhere."  

"Oh, Barkley's; yes, near Lenox, isn't it?  But she's sure to  come to town to meet you."  

He said it so easily and naturally that her own constraint was  relieved, and suddenly, before she knew what she meant to do, she  had burst out, "She may dislike the idea of seeing people."  

Ide, whose absent, short-sighted gaze had been fixed on the  slowly gliding water, turned in his seat to stare at his companion.  

"Who?  Leila?" he said, with an incredulous laugh.  

Mrs. Lidcote flushed to her faded hair, and grew pale again.   "It took *me* a long time—to get used to it," she stammered,  forcing a smile.  

His look grew gently commiserating.  "I think you'll find—"  he wavered for a word—"that things are different now—altogether  easier."  

"That's what I've been wondering—since we started."  She was  determined now to speak.  She moved nearer, so that their arms  touched, and she could drop her voice to the lowest murmur.  "You  see, it all came on me in a flash.  My going off to India and Siam  on that long trip kept me away from letters for weeks at a time;  and she didn't want to tell me beforehand—oh, I understand *  that*, poor child!  You know how good she's always been to me; how  she's tried to spare me.  And she knew, of course, what a state of  horror I'd be in.  She knew I'd rush to her at once and try to stop  it.  So she never gave me a hint of anything, and she even managed  to muzzle Susy Suffern—you know Susy is the one of the family who  keeps me posted about things at home.  I don't yet see how she  prevented Susy's telling me; but she did.  And her first letter,  the one I got up at Bangkok, simply said the thing was over,—the  divorce, I mean,—and that the very next day she'd—well, I suppose  there was no use waiting; and *he* seems to have behaved as well  as possible, to have wanted to marry her as much as—"  

"Who?  Barkley?" he helped her out.  "I should say so!  Why,  what do you suppose—"  He interrupted himself.  "He'll be devoted  to her, I assure you," he said.  

"Oh, of course; I'm sure he will.  He's written me—really  beautifully.  But it's a terrible strain on a man's devotion, a  terrible test.  I'm not sure that Leila realizes—"  

Ide sounded again his little, reassuring laugh.  "I'm not sure  that you realize.  * They're* all right."  

It was the very phrase that the young lady in the next seat  had applied to the unknown "Leila," and its recurrence on Ide's  lips flushed Mrs. Lidcote with fresh courage.  

"I wish I knew just what you mean.  The two young women next  to me—the ones with the wonderful hats—have been talking in the  same way."  

"What?  About Leila?"  

"About *a* Leila; I fancied it might be mine.  And about  society in general.  All their friends seem to be divorced; some of    them seem to announce their engagements before they get  their decree.  One of them,—*her* name was Mabel,—as far as I  could make out, her husband found out that she meant to divorce him  by noticing that she wore a new engagement-ring."  

"Well, you see Leila did everything 'regularly,' as the French  say," Ide rejoined.  

"Yes; but are these people in society?  The people my  neighbors talk about?"  

Ide shrugged his shoulders.  "It would take an arbitration  commission a good many sittings to define the boundaries of society  nowadays.  But at any rate they're in New York; and I assure you  you're * not;* you're farther and farther from it."  

"But I've been back there several times to see Leila."  She  hesitated and looked away from him.  Then she brought out slowly:  "And I've never noticed—the least change—in—in my own case—"  

"Oh," he sounded deprecatingly, and she trembled with the fear  of having gone too far.  But the hour was past when she could be  held by such scruples.  She must know where she was and where Leila  was.  "Mrs. Boulger still cuts me," she brought out with an  embarrassed laugh.  

"Are you sure?  You've probably cut * her;* if not now, at  least in the past.  And in a cut, if you're not first, you're  nowhere.  That's what keeps up so many quarrels."  

The word roused Mrs. Lidcote to a renewed sense of realities.   "But the Purshes," she said—"the Purshes are so strong!  There are  so many of them, and they all back each other up, just as my  husband's family did.  I know what it means to have a clan against  one.  They're stronger than any number of separate friends.  The  Purshes will *never* forgive Leila for leaving Horace.  Why, his  mother opposed his marrying her because of—of my situation.  She  tried to get Leila to promise that she wouldn't see me when they  went to Europe on their honeymoon.  And now she'll say it was my  example."  

Her companion, vaguely stroking his beard, mused a moment upon  this; then he asked with seeming irrelevance, "What did Leila say  when you wrote that you were coming?"  

"She said it wasn't the least necessary, but I'd better come,  because it was the only way to convince me that it wasn't."  

"Well, then, that proves she's not afraid of the Purshes."  

She breathed a long sigh of remembrance.  "Oh, just at first,  you know—one never is."  

He laid his hand on hers with a rapid gesture of intelligence  and pity.  "You'll see, you'll see," he merely promised her.  

A shadow lengthened down the deck before them, and a steward  stood there, proffering a wireless despatch.  

"Oh, now I shall know!" she exclaimed.  

She tore the message open, and then let it fall on her knees,  dropping her clasped hands on it in silence.  

Ide's inquiry roused her: "It's all right?"  

"Oh, quite right.  Perfectly.  She can't come; but she's  sending Susy Suffern.  She says that Susy will explain."  After  another silence she added, with a sudden gush of bitterness, "As if  I needed any explanation!"  

She felt Ide's hesitating glance upon her.  "She's in the  country?"  

"Yes.  'Prevented last moment.  Longing for you, expecting  you.  Love from both.'  Don't you *see*, the poor darling, that  she couldn't face it?"  

"No, I don't."  He waited.  "Do you mean to go to her  immediately?"  

"It will be too late to catch a train this evening; but I  shall take the first to-morrow morning."  She considered a moment.   "Perhaps it's better.  I need a talk with Susy first.  She's to  meet me at the dock, and I'll take her straight back to the hotel  with me."  

As she developed this plan, she had the sense that Ide was  still thoughtfully, even gravely, considering her.  When she  ceased, he remained silent a moment; then he said almost  ceremoniously: "If your talk with Miss Suffern doesn't last too  late, would it be indiscreet of me to ask to see you when it's  over?  I shall be dining at the club, and I'll call you up at about  ten, if I may.  I'm off to Chicago on business to-morrow morning,  and it would be a satisfaction to know, before I start, that your  cousin's been able to reassure you, as I know she will."  

He spoke with a sudden, shy deliberateness that, even to Mrs.  Lidcote's troubled perceptions, sounded a long-silenced note of  feeling.  Perhaps the breaking down of   the barrier of  reticence between them had released unsuspected emotions in both.   The tone of his appeal moved her curiously and loosened the tight  strain of her fears.  

"Oh, yes, come—do come," she murmured, rising.  The huge  threat of New York was imminent now, dwarfing, under long reaches  of embattled masonry, the great deck she stood on and all the  little specks of life it carried.  One of them, drifting nearer,  took the shape of her maid, flanked by luggage-laden stewards, and  signing to her that it was time to go below.  As they descended to  the main deck, the throng swept her against Mrs. Lorin Boulger's  shoulder, and she heard the ambassadress call to an interlocutor,  over the vexed sea of hats: "So sorry!  I should have been  delighted, but I've promised to spend Sunday with some friends at  Lenox."      

   
##                            II 

   SUSY SUFFERN'S explanation did not end till after ten o'clock, and  she had just gone when Franklin Ide, who, complying with an old New  York tradition, had caused himself to be preceded by a long, white  box of roses, was ushered into Mrs. Lidcote's sitting-room.  

He came forward with his shy, half-humorous smile and, taking  her hand, looked at her for a moment without speaking.  

"It's all right," he then pronounced affirmatively.  

Mrs. Lidcote returned his smile.  "It's extraordinary.   Everything's changed.  Even Susy has changed; and you know the  extent to which Susy stood for old New York.  There's no old New  York left, it seems.  She talked in the most amazing way.  She  snaps her fingers at the Purshes.  She told me—*me*, that every  woman had a right to happiness, that self-expression was the  highest duty.  She accused me of misunderstanding Leila; she said  my point of view was conventional!  She was bursting with pride at  having been in the secret, and wearing a brooch that Wilbour  Barkley'd given her!"  

Franklin Ide had seated himself in the arm-chair of green art-velvet that she had pushed forward for him under the electric  chandelier.  He threw back his head and laughed.  "What did I tell  you?" he exclaimed.  

"Yes; but I can't believe that Susy's not mistaken.  Poor  dear, she has the habit of lost causes; and she may feel that,  having stuck to me, she can do no less than stick to Leila."  

"But she didn't—did she?—openly defy the world for you?  She  didn't snap her fingers at your husband's family?"  

Mrs. Lidcote shook her head, still smiling.  "No.  It was  enough to defy *my* family.  She did that, almost.  It was  doubtful at one time if they would tolerate her seeing me, and she  almost had to disinfect herself after each visit.  I believe that  at first my sister-in-law wouldn't let the girls come down when  Susy dined with her."  

"Well, isn't your cousin's present attitude the best possible  proof that times have changed?"  

"Yes, yes; I know."  She leaned forward from her sofa-corner,  fixing her eyes on his thin, kindly face, which gleamed on her  indistinctly through a sudden blur.  "If it's true, it's—it's  dazzling.  She says Leila's perfectly happy.  It's as if an angel  had gone about in all the cemeteries lifting gravestones, and the  buried people walked again, and the living didn't shrink from  them."  

"That's about it," he assented.  

She drew a deep breath, and sat looking away from him down the  long perspective of lamp-fringed streets over which her windows  hung.  

"I can understand how happy you must be," he began at length.  

She turned to him impetuously.  "Yes, yes; I'm happy.  But I'm  lonely, too—lonelier than ever.  I didn't take up much room in the  world before; but now—where is there a corner for me?  Oh, since  I've begun to confess myself, why shouldn't I go on?  Telling you  this lifts a gravestone from * me!*  You see, before this, Leila  needed me.  She was unhappy, and I knew it, and though we hardly  ever talked of it, I felt that, in a way, the thought that I'd been  through the same thing, and down to the dregs of it, helped her.   And her needing me helped *me*.  And when the news of her  marriage came, my first thought was that now she'd need me more  than ever, that she'd have no one but me to turn to.  Yes, under  all my distress there was a fierce joy in that.  It was so new and  wonderful to feel again   that there was one person who  wouldn't be able to get on without me!  And now what you and Susy  tell me seems to have taken my child from me; and just at first  that's all that I can feel."  

"Of course it's all you feel."  He looked at her musingly.   "Why didn't Leila come to meet you?" he then inquired.  

"Oh, that was really my fault.  You see, I'd cabled that I was  not sure of being able to get off on the *Utopia*, and apparently  my second cable was delayed, and when she received it, she'd  already asked some people over Sunday—one or two of her old  friends, Susy says.  I'm so glad they should have wanted to go to  her at once; but naturally I'd rather have been alone with her."  

"You still mean to go, then?"  

"Oh, I must.  Susy wanted to drag me off to Ridgefield with  her over Sunday, and Leila sent me word that of course I might go  if I wanted to, and that I was not to think of her; but I know how  disappointed she would be.  Susy said she was afraid I might be  upset at her having people to stay, and that, in that case, she  wouldn't urge me to come.  But if *they* don't mind, why should  I?  And of course, if they're willing to go to Leila, it must mean--"  

"Of course.  I'm glad you recognize that," Franklin Ide  exclaimed abruptly.  He stood up and went over to her, taking her  hand with one of his quick unexpected gestures.  "There's something  I want to say to you," he began—    THE next morning, in the train, through all the other contending  thoughts in Mrs. Lidcote's mind there ran the warm undercurrent of  what Franklin Ide had wanted to say to her.  

He had wanted, she knew, to say it once before, when, nearly  eight years earlier, the hazard of meeting at the end of a rainy  autumn in a small, deserted Swiss hotel had thrown them for a  fortnight into unwonted propinquity.  They had walked and talked  together, borrowed each other's books and newspapers, spent the  long, chill evenings over the fire in the dim lamplight of her  little pitch-pine sitting-room; and she had been wonderfully  comforted by his presence, and hard, frozen places in her had  melted, and she had known that she would be desperately sorry when  he went.  And then, just at the end, in his odd, indirect way, he  had let her see that it rested with her to have him stay if she  chose.  She could still relive the sleepless night she had given to  that discovery.  It was preposterous, of course, to think of  repaying his devotion by accepting such a sacrifice; but how find  reasons to convince him?  She could not bear to let him think her  less touched, less inclined to him than she was: the generosity of  his love deserved that she should repay it with the truth.  Yet how  let him see what she felt, and yet refuse what he offered?  How  confess to him what had been on her lips when he made the offer:  "I've seen what it did to one man; and there must never, never be  another?"  The tacit ignoring of her past had been the element in  which their friendship lived, and she could not suddenly, to him of  all men, begin to talk of herself like a guilty woman in a play.   Somehow, in the end, she had managed it, had averted a direct  explanation, had made him understand that her life was over, that  she existed only for her daughter, and that a more definite word  from him would have been almost a breach of delicacy.  She was so  used to behaving as if her life were over!  And, at any rate, he  had taken her hint, and she had been able to spare her  sensitiveness and his.  The next year, when he came to Florence to  see her, they met again in the old friendly way; and that till now  had continued to be the tenor of their intimacy.  

And now, suddenly and unexpectedly, he had brought up the  question again, directly this time, and in such a form that she  could not evade it: putting the renewal of his plea, after so long  an interval, on the ground that, on her own showing, her chief  argument against it no longer existed.  

"You tell me Leila's happy.  If she's happy, she doesn't need  you—need you, that is, in the same way as before.  You wanted  then, I know, to be always in reach, always free and available if  she should suddenly call you to her or take refuge with you.  I  understood that—I respected it.  I didn't urge my case because I  saw it was useless.  You couldn't, I understood well enough, have  felt free to take such happiness as life with me   might have  given you while she was unhappy, and, as you imagined, with no hope  of release.  Even then I didn't feel as you did about it; I  understood better the trend of things here.  But ten years ago the  change hadn't really come; and I had no way of convincing you that  it was coming.  Still, I always fancied that Leila might not think  her case was closed, and so I chose to think that ours wasn't  either.  Let me go on thinking so, at any rate, till you've seen  her, and confirmed with your own eyes what Susy Suffern tells you."      

  
##                            III 

   ALL through what Susy Suffern told and retold her during their  four-hours' flight to the hills this plea of Ide's kept coming back  to Mrs. Lidcote.  She did not yet know what she felt as to its  ultimate bearing on her own fate, but it was something on which her  confused thoughts could stay themselves amid the welter of new  impressions, and she was inexpressibly glad that he had said what  he had, and said it at that particular moment.  It helped her to  hold fast to her identity in the rush of strange names and new  categories that her cousin's talk poured out on her.  

With the progress of the journey Miss Suffern's communications  grew more and more amazing.  She was like a cicerone preparing the  mind of an inexperienced traveler for the marvels about to burst on  it.  

"You won't know Leila.  She's had her pearls reset.  Sargent's  to paint her.  Oh, and I was to tell you that she hopes you won't  mind being the least bit squeezed over Sunday.  The house was built  by Wilbour's father, you know, and it's rather old-fashioned—only  ten spare bedrooms.  Of course that's small for what they mean to  do, and she'll show you the new plans they've had made.  Their idea  is to keep the present house as a wing.  She told me to explain—  she's so dreadfully sorry not to be able to give you a sitting-room  just at first.  They're thinking of Egypt for next winter, unless  of course, Wilbour gets his appointment.  Oh, didn't she write you  about that?  Why, he wants Rome, you know—the second  secretaryship.  Or, rather, he wanted England; but Leila insisted  that if they went abroad, she must be near you.  And of course what  she says is law.  Oh, they quite hope they'll get it.  You see  Horace's uncle is in the Cabinet,—one of the assistant  secretaries,—and I believe he has a good deal of pull—"  

"Horace's uncle?  You mean Wilbour's, I suppose," Mrs. Lidcote  interjected, with a gasp of which a fraction was given to Miss  Suffern's flippant use of the language.  

"Wilbour's?  No, I don't.  I mean Horace's.  Oh, there's no  bad feeling between them, I assure you.  Since Horace's engagement  was announced—you didn't know Horace was engaged?  Why, he's  marrying one of Bishop Thorbury's girls: the red-haired one who  wrote the novel that every one's talking about, 'This Flesh of  Mine.'  They're to be married in the cathedral.  Of course Horace  *can*, because it was Leila who—but, as I say, there's not the  *least* feeling, and Horace wrote himself to his uncle about  Wilbour."  

Mrs. Lidcote's thoughts fled back to what she had said to Ide  the day before on the deck of the *Utopia*.  "I didn't take up  much room before, but now where is there a corner for me?"  Where  indeed in this crowded, topsyturvy world, with its headlong changes  and helter-skelter readjustments, its new tolerances and  indifferences and accommodations, was there room for a character  fashioned by slower, sterner processes and a life broken under  their inexorable pressure?  And then, in a flash, she viewed the  chaos from a new angle, and order seemed to move upon the void.  If  the old processes were changed, her case was changed with them;  she, too, was a part of the general readjustment, a tiny fragment  of the new pattern worked out in bolder, freer harmonies.  Since  her daughter had no penalty to pay, was not she herself, by the  same stroke, released from the long toll that life had taken of  her?  The rich arrears of youth and joy were gone irrevocably; but  was there not enough left to accumulate new stores of happiness?   That, of course, was what Franklin Ide had felt and had meant her  to feel.  He had seen at once what the change in her daughter's  situation would make in her view of her own.  It was almost—  wondrously enough!—as if Leila's folly had been the means of  vindicating hers.      EVERYTHING else for the moment faded for Mrs. Lidcote in the glow  of her daughter's embrace.  It was unnatural, it was almost  terrifying, to find herself suddenly standing on a strange  threshold, under an unknown roof, in a big hall full of pictures,  flowers, firelight, and hurrying servants, and in this spacious,  unfamiliar confusion to discover Leila, bareheaded, laughing,  authoritative, with a strange young man jovially echoing her  welcome and transmitting her orders; but once Mrs. Lidcote had her  child on her breast, and her child's, "It's all right, you old  darling!" in her ears, every other feeling was lost in the deep  sense of well-being that only Leila's hug could give.  

The sense was still with her, warming her veins and pleasantly  fluttering her heart, as she went up to her room after luncheon.   A little constrained by the presence of visitors, and not  altogether sorry to defer for a few hours the "long talk" with her  daughter for which she somehow felt herself tremulously unready,  she had withdrawn, on the plea of fatigue, to the bright, luxurious  bedroom into which Leila had again and again apologized for having  been obliged to "squeeze" her.  The room was bigger and finer than  any in her small apartment in Florence; but it was not the standard  of affluence implied in her daughter's tone about it that chiefly  struck her, nor yet the finish and complexity of its appointments.   It was the look it shared with the rest of the house, and with the  trim perspective of the gardens beneath its windows, of being part  of an "establishment"—of something solid, avowed, founded on  sacraments and precedents and principles.  There was nothing about  the place, or about Leila and Wilbour, that suggested either  passion or peril: their relation seemed as comfortable as their  furniture and as respectable as their balance at the bank.  

This was, in the whole confusing experience, the thing that  confused Mrs. Lidcote most, that gave her at once the deepest  feeling of security for Leila and the strongest sense of  apprehension for herself.  Yes, there was something oppressive in  the completeness and compactness of Leila's well-being.  Ide had  been right: her daughter did not need her.  Leila, with her first  embrace, had unconsciously attested the fact in the same phrase as  Ide himself, as the two young women with the hats.  "It's all  right, you old darling!" she had said; and her mother sat alone,  trying to fit herself into the new scheme of things which such a  certainty betokened.  

Her first distinct feeling was one of irrational resentment.   If such a change was to come, why had it not come sooner?  Here was  she, a woman not yet old, who had paid with the best years of her  life for the theft of the happiness that her daughter's  contemporaries took as their due.  There was no sense, no sequence,  in it.  She had had what she wanted, but she had had to pay too  much for it.  She had had to pay the last bitterest price of  learning that love has a price: that it is worth so much and no  more.  She had known the anguish of watching the man she loved  discover this first, and of reading the discovery in his eyes.  It  was a part of her history that she had not trusted herself to think  of for a long time past: she always took a big turn about that  haunted corner of her conscience.  But now, at the sight of the  young man down-stairs, so openly and jovially Leila's, she was  overwhelmed at the senseless waste of her own adventure, and wrung  with the irony of perceiving that the success or failure of the  deepest human experiences may hang on a matter of chronology.  

Then gradually the thought of Ide returned to her.  "I chose  to think that our case wasn't closed," he had said.  She had been  deeply touched by that.  To every one else her case had been closed  so long!  *Finis* was scrawled all over her.  But here was one  man who had believed and waited, and what if what he believed in  and waited for were coming true?  If Leila's "all right" should  really foreshadow hers?  

As yet, of course, it was impossible to tell.  She had  fancied, indeed, when she entered the drawing-room before luncheon,  that a too-sudden hush had fallen on the assembled group of Leila's  friends, on the slender, vociferous young women and the lounging,  golf-stockinged young men.  They had all received her politely,  with the kind of petrified politeness that may be either a tribute  to age or a protest at laxity; but to them, of course, she must be  an old woman because she was Leila's mother, and in a society so  dominated by   youth the mere presence of maturity was a  constraint.  

One of the young girls, however, had presently emerged from  the group, and, attaching herself to Mrs. Lidcote's side, had  listened to her with a blue gaze of admiration which gave the older  woman a sudden happy consciousness of her long-forgotten social  graces.  It was agreeable to find herself attracting this young  Charlotte Wynn, whose mother had been among her closest friends,  and in whom something of the soberness and softness of the earlier  manners had survived.  But the little colloquy, broken up by the  announcement of luncheon, could of course result in nothing more  definite than this reminiscent emotion.  

No, she could not yet tell how her own case was to be fitted  into the new order of things; but there were more people—"older  people" Leila had put it—arriving by the afternoon train, and that  evening at dinner she would doubtless be able to judge.  She began  to wonder nervously who the new-comers might be.  Probably she  would be spared the embarrassment of finding old acquaintances  among them; but it was odd that her daughter had mentioned no  names.  

Leila had proposed that, later in the afternoon, Wilbour  should take her mother for a drive: she said she wanted them to  have a "nice, quiet talk."  But Mrs. Lidcote wished her talk with  Leila to come first, and had, moreover, at luncheon, caught stray  allusions to an impending tennis-match in which her son-in-law was  engaged.  Her fatigue had been a sufficient pretext for declining  the drive, and she had begged Leila to think of her as peacefully  reposing in her room till such time as they could snatch their  quiet moment.  

"Before tea, then, you duck!" Leila with a last kiss had  decided; and presently Mrs. Lidcote, through her open window, had  heard the fresh, loud voices of her daughter's visitors chiming  across the gardens from the tennis-court.

##                            IV 

   LEILA had come and gone, and they had had their talk.  It had not  lasted as long as either of them wished, for in the middle of it  Leila had been summoned to the telephone to receive an important  message from town, and had sent her maid to tell Mrs. Lidcote that  she couldn't come back just then, as one of the young ladies had  been called away unexpectedly and arrangements had to be made for  her departure.  But the mother and daughter had had almost an hour  together, and Mrs. Lidcote was happy.  She had never seen Leila so  tender, so solicitous.  The only thing that troubled her was,  indeed, the very excess of this solicitude, the exaggerated  expression of her daughter's annoyance that their first moments  together should have been marred by the presence of strangers.  

"Not strangers to me, darling, since they're friends of  yours," her mother had assured her.  

"Yes; but I know your feeling, you queer, wild mother.  I know  how you've always hated people."  (* Hated people!*  Had Leila  forgotten why?)  "And that's why I told Susy that if you preferred  to go with her to Ridgefield on Sunday, I should so perfectly  understand, should so patiently wait for our good hug.  But you  didn't really mind them at luncheon, did you, dearest?"  

Mrs. Lidcote, at that, had suddenly thrown a long, startled  look at her daughter.  "I don't mind things of that kind any  longer," she had simply answered.  

"But that doesn't console me for having exposed you to the  bother of it, for having let you come here when I ought to have *  ordered* you off to Ridgefield with Susy.  If Susy hadn't been  stupid, she'd have made you go there with her.  I hate to think of  you up here all alone."  

Again Mrs. Lidcote tried to read something more than a rather  obtuse devotion in her daughter's radiant gaze.  "I'm glad to have  had a rest this afternoon, dear; and later—"  

"Oh, yes, later, when all this fuss is over, we'll more than  make up for it, sha'n't we, you precious darling?"  And at this  point Leila had been summoned to the telephone, leaving Mrs.  Lidcote alone with her conjectures.  

These were still floating before her in cloudy imprecision  when Miss Suffern's tap on the door roused her to the lapse of  time.    

"You've come to take me down to tea?  I'd forgotten how late  it was," she said.  

Miss Suffern, a plump, peering little woman, with prim hair  and a conciliatory smile, nervously adjusted, as she came in, the  pendant bugles of her oddly elaborate black dress.  Miss Suffern  was always in mourning, and always commemorating the demise of  distant relatives by wearing the discarded wardrobe of their next  of kin.  "It isn't *exactly* mourning," she would say; "but it's  the only stitch of black poor Julia had—and of course George was  only my mother's step-cousin."  

As she came forward, Mrs. Lidcote found herself humorously  wondering whether she were mourning Horace Pursh's divorce in one  of his mother's old black satins.  

"Oh, *did* you mean to go down?"  Susy Suffern peered at  her, a little fluttered.  "Leila sent me up to keep you company.   She thought it would be cozier for you to have tea here.  She was  afraid you were feeling rather tired."  

"I was; but I've had the whole afternoon to rest in.  And this  wonderful sofa to help me."  

"Leila told me to tell you that she'd rush up for a minute  before dinner, after everybody had arrived; but the train is always  dreadfully late.  She's in despair at not giving you a sitting-room; she wanted to know if I thought you really minded."  

"Of course I don't mind.  It's not like Leila to think I  should."  Mrs. Lidcote drew aside to make way for the housemaid,  who appeared in the doorway, bearing a table spread with a studied  variety of tea-cakes.  

"Leila saw to it herself," Miss Suffern murmured as the door  closed on the housemaid's efficient figure.  "Her one idea is that  you should feel happy here."  

It struck Mrs. Lidcote as one more mark of the subverted state  of things that her daughter's solicitude should find expression in  the tenuity of sandwiches and the piping-hotness of muffins; but  then everything that had happened since her arrival seemed to  increase her confusion.  

The note of a motor-horn down the drive gave another turn to  her thoughts.  "Are those the new arrivals already?" she asked.  

"Oh, dear, no; they won't be here till after seven."  Miss  Suffern craned her head from the window to catch a glimpse of the  motor.  "It must be Charlotte leaving."  

"Was it the little Wynn girl who was called away in a hurry  just now?  I hope it's not on account of illness."  

"Oh, no; I believe there was some mistake about dates.  Her  mother telephoned her that she was expected at the Stepleys, at  Fishkill, and she had to be rushed over to Albany to catch a  train."  

Mrs. Lidcote meditated.  "I'm sorry.  She's a charming young  thing.  I hoped I should have another talk with her this evening  after dinner."  

"Yes; it's too bad."  Miss Suffern's gaze grew vague.  "You *  do* look tired, you know," she continued, seating herself at the  tea-table and preparing to dispense its delicacies.  "You must go  straight back to your sofa and let me wait on you.  The excitement  has told on you more than you think, and you mustn't fight against  it any longer.  Just stay quietly up here and let yourself go.   You'll have Leila to yourself on Monday."  

Mrs. Lidcote received the tea-cup which her cousin proffered,  but showed no other disposition to obey her injunctions.  For a  moment she stirred her tea in silence; then she asked, "Is it your  idea that I should stay quietly up here till Monday?"  

Miss Suffern set down her own cup with a gesture so sudden  that it endangered an adjacent plate of scones.  When she had  assured herself of the safety of the scones, she looked up with a  fluttered laugh.  "Perhaps, dear, by to-morrow you'll be feeling  differently.  The air here, you know—"  

"Yes, I know."  Mrs. Lidcote bent forward to help herself to  a scone.  "Who's arriving this evening?" she then inquired.  

Miss Suffern frowned and peered.  "You know my wretched head  for names.  Leila told me, of course—but there are so many—"  

"So many?  She didn't tell me she expected a big party."  

"Oh, not big: but rather outside of her little group.  And of  course, as it's the first time, she's a little excited at having  the older set."    

Mrs. Lidcote considered this.  "The older set?  Our  contemporaries, you mean?"  

"Why—yes."  Miss Suffern paused as if to gather herself up  for a leap.  "The Ashton Gileses," she brought out.  

"The Ashton Gileses?  Really?  I shall be glad to see Mary  Giles again.  It must be eighteen years," said Mrs. Lidcote,  steadily.  

"Yes," Miss Suffern gasped, precipitately refilling her cup.  

"The Ashton Gileses; and who else?"  

"Well, the Sam Fresbies.  But the most important person, of  course, is Mrs. Lorin Boulger."  

"Mrs. Boulger?  Leila didn't tell me she was coming."  

"Didn't she?  I suppose she forgot everything when she saw  you.  But really the party was got up for Mrs. Boulger.  You see,  it's very important that she should—well, take a fancy to Leila  and Wilbour: his being appointed to Rome virtually depends on it.   And you know Leila insists on Rome in order to be near you.  So she  asked Mary Giles, who's intimate with the Boulgers, if the visit  couldn't possibly be arranged; and Mary's cable caught Mrs. Boulger  at Cherbourg.  She's to be only a fortnight in America; and getting  her to come directly here was rather a triumph."  

"Yes; I see it was," said Mrs. Lidcote.  

"You know, she's rather—rather fussy; and Mary was a little  doubtful if—"  

"If she would, on account of Leila?" Mrs. Lidcote murmured.  

"Well, yes.  In her official position.  But luckily she's a  friend of the Barkleys.  And finding the Gileses and Fresbies here  will make it all right.  The times have changed," Susy Suffern  indulgently summed up.  

Mrs. Lidcote smiled.  "Yes; a few years ago it would have  seemed improbable that I should ever again be dining with Mary  Giles and Harriet Fresbie and Mrs. Lorin Boulger."  

Miss Suffern did not at the moment seem disposed to enlarge  upon this theme; and after an interval of silence Mrs. Lidcote  suddenly resumed, "Do they know I'm here, by the way?"  

The effect of her question was to produce in Miss Suffern an  exaggerated access of peering and frowning.  She twitched the tea-things about, fingered her bugles with a flurried hand, and,  looking at the clock, exclaimed amazedly: "Mercy!  Is it seven  already?"  

"Not that it can make any difference, I suppose," Mrs. Lidcote  musingly continued.  "But did Leila tell them I was coming?"  

Miss Suffern looked at her with pain.  "Why, you don't  suppose, dearest, that Leila would do anything—"  

Mrs. Lidcote went on: "For, of course, it's of the first  importance, as you say, that Mrs. Lorin Boulger should be favorably  impressed in order that Wilbour may have the best possible chance  of getting Rome."  

"I *told* Leila you'd feel that, dear.  You see, it's  actually on *your* account—so that they may get a post near you--that Leila invited Mrs. Boulger."  

"Yes, I see that, of course."  Mrs. Lidcote, abruptly rising  from her seat, turned her eyes to the clock.  "But, as you say,  it's getting late.  Oughtn't we to dress for dinner?"  

Miss Suffern, at the suggestion, stood up also, an agitated  hand among her bugles.  "I do wish I could persuade you to stay up  here this evening.  I'm sure Leila'd be happier if you would.   Really, you're much too tired to come down."  

"What nonsense, Susy!"  Mrs. Lidcote spoke with a sudden  sharpness, her hand stretched to the bell.  "When do we dine?  At  half-past eight?  Then I must really send you packing.  At my age  it takes time to dress."  

Miss Suffern, thus decisively projected toward the threshold,  lingered there to reiterate reproachfully: "Leila'll never forgive  herself if you make an effort you're not up to."  But Mrs. Lidcote  smiled on her without answering, and the icy light-wave propelled  her through the door.      

  
##                             V 

   MRS. LIDCOTE, though she had made the gesture of ringing for her  maid, had not done so.  

When the door closed, she stood a moment motionless in the  middle of her soft, spacious room.  The little fire which had been  kindled at twilight danced on the brightness of silver and mirrors  and sober gilding; and the sofa toward which Miss   Suffern  had urged her heaped up its accumulated cushions in inviting  proximity to a table laden with new books and papers.  She could  not recall having ever been more luxuriously housed, or having ever  had so strange a sense of being out alone, under the night, in a  wind-beaten plain without shelter.  She sat down by the fire and  thought.  

A tap on the door made her lift her head, and she saw her  daughter on the threshold.  The intricate ordering of Leila's fair  hair and the contrasted negligence of her draperies showed that she  had interrupted her dressing to hasten to her mother; but once in  the room, she paused a moment, smiling uncertainly, as though she  had forgotten the object of her haste.  

Mrs. Lidcote rose to her feet.  "Time to dress, dearest?   Don't scold!  I sha'n't be late," she said.  

"To dress?"  Leila hung before her with a puzzled look.  "Why,  I thought, dear—I mean, I hoped you'd decided just to stay here  quietly and rest."  

Her mother smiled.  "But I've been resting all the afternoon!"  

Leila shone on her apprehensively.  "Yes, but—you know you *  do* look tired.  And when Susy told me just now that you meant to  make the effort—"  

"You came in to stop me?"  

"I came in to tell you that you needn't feel in the least  obliged—"  

"Of course.  I understand that."  

There was a pause during which Leila, vaguely averting herself  from her mother's scrutiny, drifted toward the dressing-table and  began to disturb the symmetry of the toilet implements laid out on  it.  

"Do your visitors know that I'm here?" Mrs. Lidcote suddenly  went on.  

"Do they—  Of course—why, naturally," Leila rejoined,  absorbed in trying to turn the stopper of a salts-bottle.  

"Then won't they think it odd if I don't appear at dinner?"  

"Oh, not in the least, dearest.  Really, I assure you they'll  *all* understand."  Leila laid down the bottle and turned back to  her mother, her face alight with reassurance.  

Mrs. Lidcote stood motionless, her head erect, her smiling  eyes on her daughter's.  "Will they think it odd if I * do?"*  

Leila stopped short, her lips half parted to reply.  As she  paused, the color stole over her bare neck, swept up to her throat,  and burst into flame in her cheeks.  Thence it sent its devastating  crimson up to her very temples, to the lobes of her ears, to the  edges of her eyelids, beating all over her in great waves of red,  as if fanned by some imperceptible wind which blew back the words  from her lips.  

Mrs. Lidcote for a moment silently watched the conflagration;  then she turned away her eyes with a slight laugh.  "I only meant  that I was afraid it might upset the arrangement of your dinner-table if I didn't, at the last, come down.  If you can really  assure me that it won't, I believe I'll take you at your word and  go back to this irresistible sofa."  She paused, as if waiting for  her daughter to speak; then she held out her arms.  "Run off and  dress, dearest, and don't have me on your mind."  She clasped Leila  close, pressing a long kiss on the last afterglow of her subsiding  blush.  "I do feel the least bit overdone, and if it really won't  inconvenience you to have me drop out of things, I believe I'll  just basely take to my bed and stay there till your party scatters.   And now run off, dear, or you'll be late; and make my excuses to  them all."      

   
##                           VI 

   THE Barkleys' visitors had dispersed, and Mrs. Lidcote, completely  restored by her two days' rest, found herself, on the following  Monday, alone with her children and Miss Suffern.  

There was a note of jubilation in the air, for the party had  "gone off" so extraordinarily well, and so completely, as it  appeared, to the satisfaction of Mrs. Lorin Boulger, that Wilbour's  early appointment to Rome was almost to be counted on.  So certain  did this seem that the prospect of a prompt reunion mitigated the  distress with which Leila learned of her mother's decision to  return almost immediately to Italy.  No one understood this  decision: it seemed to Leila absolutely unintelligible that Mrs.  Lidcote should not stay on with them till their own fate was fixed,  and Wilbour handsomely echoed her astonishment.  

"Why shouldn't you, as Leila says, wait here till we can all  pack up and go together?"    

Mrs. Lidcote smiled her gratitude with her refusal.  "After  all, it's not yet sure that you'll be packing up."  

"Oh, you ought to have seen Wilbour with Mrs. Boulger," Leila  triumphed.  

"No, you ought to have seen Leila with her," Leila's husband  exulted.  

Miss Suffern enthusiastically appended, "I *do* think  inviting Harriet Fresbie was a stroke of genius!"  

"Oh, we'll be with you soon," Leila laughed.  "So soon that  it's really foolish to separate."  

But Mrs. Lidcote held out with the quiet firmness which her  daughter knew it was useless to oppose.  After her long months in  India, it was really imperative, she declared, that she should get  back to Florence and see what was happening to her little place  there; and she had been so comfortable on the *Utopia* that she  had a fancy to return by the same ship.  There was nothing for it,  therefore, but to acquiesce in her decision and keep her with them  till the afternoon before the day of the * Utopia's* sailing.   This arrangement fitted in with certain projects which, during her  two days' seclusion, Mrs. Lidcote had silently matured.  It had  become to her of the first importance to get away as soon as she  could, and the little place in Florence, which held her past in  every fold of its curtains and between every page of its books,  seemed now to her the one spot where that past would be endurable  to look upon.  

She was not unhappy during the intervening days.  The sight of  Leila's well-being, the sense of Leila's tenderness, were, after  all, what she had come for; and of these she had full measure.   Leila had never been happier or more tender; and the contemplation  of her bliss, and the enjoyment of her affection, were an absorbing  occupation for her mother.  But they were also a sharp strain on  certain over-tightened chords, and Mrs. Lidcote, when at last she  found herself alone in the New York hotel to which she had returned  the night before embarking, had the feeling that she had just  escaped with her life from the clutch of a giant hand.  

She had refused to let her daughter come to town with her; she  had even rejected Susy Suffern's ministrations.  She wanted no  viaticum but that of her own thoughts; and she let these come to  her without shrinking from them as she sat in the same high-hung  sitting-room in which, just a week before, she and Franklin Ide had  had their memorable talk.  

She had promised her friend to let him hear from her, but she  had not done so.  She knew that he had probably come back from  Chicago, and that if he learned of her sudden decision to return to  Italy it would be impossible for her not to see him before sailing;  and as she wished above all things not to see him, she had kept  silent, intending to send him a letter from the steamer.  

There was no reason why she should wait till then to write it.   The actual moment was more favorable, and the task, though not  agreeable, would at least bridge over an hour of her lonely  evening.  She went up to the writing-table, drew out a sheet of  paper, and began to write his name.  And as she did so, the door  opened, and he came in.  

The words she met him with were the last she could have  imagined herself saying when they had parted.  "How in the world  did you know that I was here?"  

He caught her meaning in a flash.  "You didn't want me to,  then?"  He stood looking at her.  "I suppose I ought to have taken  your silence as meaning that.  But I happened to meet Mrs. Wynn,  who is stopping here, and she asked me to dine with her and  Charlotte, and Charlotte's young man.  They told me they'd seen you  arriving this afternoon, and I couldn't help coming up."  

There was a pause between them, which Mrs. Lidcote at last  surprisingly broke with the exclamation, "Ah, she *did* recognize  me, then!"  

"Recognize you?"  He stared.  "Why—"  

"Oh, I saw she did, though she never moved an eyelid.  I saw  it by Charlotte's blush.  The child has the prettiest blush.  I saw  that her mother wouldn't let her speak to me."  

Ide put down his hat with an impatient laugh.  "Hasn't Leila  cured you of your delusions?"  

She looked at him intently.  "Then you don't think Margaret  Wynn meant to cut me?"  

"I think your ideas are absurd."  

She paused for a perceptible moment without taking this up;  then she said, at a tangent: "I'm sailing to-morrow early.    I meant to write to you—there's the letter I'd begun."  

Ide followed her gesture, and then turned his eyes back to her  face.  "You didn't mean to see me, then, or even to let me know  that you were going till you'd left?"  

"I felt it would be easier to explain to you in a letter—"  

"What in God's name is there to explain?"  She made no reply,  and he pressed on: "It can't be that you're worried about Leila,  for Charlotte Wynn told me she'd been there last week, and there  was a big party arriving when she left: Fresbies and Gileses, and  Mrs. Lorin Boulger—all the board of examiners!  If Leila has  passed *that*, she's got her degree."  

Mrs. Lidcote had dropped down into a corner of the sofa where  she had sat during their talk of the week before.  "I was stupid,"  she began abruptly.  "I ought to have gone to Ridgefield with Susy.   I didn't see till afterward that I was expected to."  

"You were expected to?"  

"Yes.  Oh, it wasn't Leila's fault.  She suffered—poor  darling; she was distracted.  But she'd asked her party before she  knew I was arriving."  

"Oh, as to that—"  Ide drew a deep breath of relief.  "I can  understand that it must have annoyed her dreadfully not to have you  to herself just at first.  But, after all, you were among old  friends or their children: the Gileses and Fresbies—and little  Charlotte Wynn."  He paused a moment before the last name, and  scrutinized her hesitatingly.  "Even if they came at the wrong  time, you must have been glad to see them all at Leila's."  

She gave him back his look with a faint smile.  "I didn't see  them," she replied.  

"You didn't see them?"  

"No.  That is, excepting little Charlotte Wynn.  That child is  exquisite.  We had a little talk before luncheon the day I arrived.   But when her mother found out that I was staying in the house, she  telephoned her to leave immediately, and so I didn't see her  again."  

The blood rushed suddenly to Ide's sallow face.  "I don't know  where you get such ideas!"  

She pursued, as if she had not heard him: "Oh, and I saw Mary  Giles for a minute, too.  Susy Suffern brought her up to my room  the last evening, after dinner, when all the others were at bridge.   She meant it kindly—but it wasn't much use."  

"But what were you doing in your room in the evening after  dinner?"  

"Why, you see, when I found out my mistake in coming,—how  embarrassing it was for Leila, I mean,—I simply told her that I  was very tired, and preferred to stay up-stairs till the party was  over."  

Ide, with a groan, struck his hand against the arm of his  chair.  "I wonder how much of all this you simply imagined!"  

"I didn't imagine the fact of Harriet Fresbie's not even  asking if she might see me when she knew I was in the house.  Nor  of Mary Giles's getting Susy, at the eleventh hour, to smuggle her  up to my room when the others wouldn't know where she'd gone; nor  poor Leila's ghastly fear lest Mrs. Lorin Boulger, for whom the  party was given, should guess I was in the house, and prevent her  husband's giving Wilbour the second secretaryship because she'd  been obliged to spend a night under the same roof with his mother-in-law!"  

Ide continued to drum on his chair-arm with exasperated  fingers.  "You don't *know* that any of the acts you describe are  due to the causes you suppose."  

Mrs. Lidcote paused before replying, as if honestly trying to  measure the weight of this argument.  Then she said in a low tone:  "I know that Leila was in an agony lest I should come down to  dinner the first night.  And it was for me she was afraid, not for  herself.  Leila is never afraid for herself."  

"But the conclusions you draw are simply preposterous.  There  are narrow-minded women everywhere, but the women who were at  Leila's knew perfectly well that their going there would give her  a sort of social sanction, and if they were willing that she should  have it, why on earth should they want to withhold it from you?"  

"That's what I told myself a week ago, in this very room,  after my first talk with Susy Suffern."  She lifted a misty smile  to his anxious eyes.  "That's why I listened to what you said to me  the same evening, and why your arguments half convinced me, and  made me think that   what had been possible for Leila might  not be altogether impossible for me.  If the new dispensation had  come, why not for me as well as for the others?  I can't tell you  the flight my imagination took!"  

Franklin Ide rose from his seat and crossed the room to a  chair near her sofa-corner.  "All I cared about was that it  seemed—for the moment—to be carrying you toward me," he said.  

"I cared about that, too.  That's why I meant to go away  without seeing you."  They gave each other grave look for look.   "Because, you see, I was mistaken," she went on.  "We were both  mistaken.  You say it's preposterous that the women who didn't  object to accepting Leila's hospitality should have objected to  meeting me under her roof.  And so it is; but I begin to understand  why.  It's simply that society is much too busy to revise its own  judgments.  Probably no one in the house with me stopped to  consider that my case and Leila's were identical.  They only  remembered that I'd done something which, at the time I did it, was  condemned by society.  My case has been passed on and classified:  I'm the woman who has been cut for nearly twenty years.  The older  people have half forgotten why, and the younger ones have never  really known: it's simply become a tradition to cut me.  And  traditions that have lost their meaning are the hardest of all to  destroy."  

Ide had sat motionless while she spoke.  As she ended, he  stood up with a short laugh and walked across the room to the  window.  Outside, the immense, black prospect of New York, strung  with myriads of lines of light, stretched away into the smoky edges  of the night.  He showed it to her with a gesture.  

"What do you suppose such words as you've been using—  'society,' 'tradition,' and the rest—mean to all the life out  there?"  

She came and stood by him, and looked out of the window.   "Less than nothing, of course.  But you and I are not out there.   We're shut up in a little, tight round of habit and association,  just as we're shut up in this room.  Remember, I thought I'd got  out of it once; but what really happened was that the other people  went out, and left me in the same little room.  The only difference  was that I was there alone.  Oh, I've made it habitable now, I'm  used to it; but I've lost any illusions I may have had as to an  angel's opening the door."  

Ide again laughed impatiently.  "Well, if the door won't open,  why not let another prisoner in?  At least it would be less of a  solitude—"  

She turned from the dark window back into the vividly lighted  room.  

"It would be more of a prison.  You forget that I know all  about that.  We're all imprisoned, of course—all of us middling  people, who don't carry our freedom in our heads.  But we've  accommodated ourselves to our different cells, and if we're moved  suddenly into new ones, we're likely to find a stone wall where we  thought there was thin air, and to knock ourselves senseless  against it.  I saw a man do that once."  

Ide, leaning with folded arms against the window-frame,  watched her in silence as she moved restlessly about the room,  gathering together some scattered books and tossing a handful of  torn letters into the paper-basket.  When she ceased, he rejoined:  "All you say is based on preconceived theories.  Why didn't you put  them to the test by coming down to meet your old friends?  Don't  you see the inference they would naturally draw from your hiding  yourself when they arrived?  It looked as though you were afraid of  them—or as though you hadn't forgiven them.  Either way, you put  them in the wrong, instead of waiting to let them put you in the  right.  If Leila had buried herself in the desert, do you suppose  society would have gone to fetch her out?  You say you were afraid  for Leila, and that she was afraid for you.  Don't you see what all  these complications of feeling mean?  Simply that you were too  nervous at the moment to let things happen naturally, just as  you're too nervous now to judge them rationally."  He paused and  turned his eyes to her face.  "Don't try to just yet.  Give  yourself a little more time.  Give *me* a little more time.  I've  always known it would take time."  

He moved nearer, and she let him have her hand.  With the  grave kindness of his face so close above her she felt like a child  roused out of frightened dreams and finding a light in the room.  

"Perhaps you're right," she heard herself begin; then  something within her   clutched her back, and her hand fell  away from him.  

"I know I'm right; trust me," he urged.  "We'll talk of this  in Florence soon."  

She stood before him, feeling with despair his kindness, his  patience, and his unreality.  Everything he said seemed like a  painted gauze let down between herself and the real facts of life;  and a sudden desire seized her to tear the gauze into shreds.  

She drew back a little and looked at him with a smile of  superficial reassurance.  "You *are* right—about not talking any  longer now.  I'm nervous and tired, and it would do no good.  I  brood over things too much.  As you say, I must try not to shrink  from people."  She turned away and glanced at the clock.  "Why,  it's only ten!  If I send you off, I shall begin to brood again;  and if you stay, we shall go on talking about the same thing.  Why  shouldn't we go down and see Margaret Wynn for half an hour?"  

She spoke lightly and rapidly, her brilliant eyes on his face.   As she watched him, she saw it change, as if her smile had thrown  a too vivid light upon it.  

"Oh, no—not to-night!" he exclaimed.  

"Not to-night?  Why, what other night have I, when I'm off at  dawn?  Besides, I want to show you at once that I mean to be more  sensible—that I'm not going to be afraid of people any more.  And  I should really like another glimpse of little Charlotte."  He  stood before her, his hand in his beard, with the gesture he had in  moments of perplexity.  "Come!" she ordered him gaily, turning to  the door.  

He followed her and laid his hand on the door-knob.  "Don't  you think—hadn't you better let me go first and see?  They told me  they'd had a tiring day at the dressmaker's.  I dare say they have  gone to bed."  

"But you said they'd a young man of Charlotte's dining with  them.  Surely he wouldn't have left by ten?  At any rate, I'll go  down with you and see.  It takes so long if one sends a servant  first."  She put him gently aside, and then paused as a new thought  struck her.  "Or wait; my maid's in the next room.  I'll tell her  to go and ask if Margaret will receive me.  Yes, that's much the  best way."  

She turned back and went toward the door that led to her  bedroom; but before she could open it she felt Ide's quick touch on  her arm.  

"I believe—I remember now—Charlotte's young man was  suggesting that they should all go out—to a music-hall or  something of the sort.  I'm sure—I'm positively sure, that you  won't find them."  

Her hand dropped from the door, his dropped from her arm, and  as they drew back and faced each other she saw the blood rise  slowly through his sallow skin, redden his neck and ears, encroach  upon the edges of his beard, and settle in dull patches under his  kind, troubled eyes.  She had seen the same blush on another face,  and the same impulse of compassion she had then felt made her turn  her gaze away again.  

A knock on the door broke the silence, and a porter put his  head into the room.  

"It's only just to know how many pieces there'll be to go down  to the steamer in the morning."  

With the words she suddenly felt that the veil of painted  gauze was torn in tatters, and that she was moving again among the  grim edges of reality.  

"Oh, dear," she exclaimed, "I never *can* remember!  Wait a  minute; I shall have to ask my maid."  

She opened her bedroom door and called out briskly: "Annette!"
